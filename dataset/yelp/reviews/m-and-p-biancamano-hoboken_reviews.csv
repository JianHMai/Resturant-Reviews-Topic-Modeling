2021-09-26,5,The best sandwich in Jersey. I started going here 20 years ago when the Hudson Tea building opened up and I was one of the first tenants. There isn't anything close to the quality and value.
2021-09-18,5,All world Italian sandwiches and the nicest people!   We usually go for something wit prosciutto, Mutz and peppers but they are all god.  Great selection of old school Italian cookies.
2021-09-13,5,Best Fresh mozzarella in North Jersey. Maybe the entire State
2021-09-06,5,These are literally the best sandwiches! Very big and good enough to share as well! Even as a vegetarian I love the veggie sandwiches they offer. My husband raves about the turkey sandwich and I am a regular for the veggie sandwich! Try the eggplant parm too either on a hero or with pasta it's to die for! The couple that runs m&p are also a delight!
2021-08-21,5,We stopped by yesterday to get our lunch. We got #C and roast beef with fresh mozzarella and grilled red peppers. Both sandwiches are sooo crazy good!!! The mozzarella is a killer!! It's one of my fave mozzarella thus far. Good texture and good taste, and they put a generous amount of mozzarella on your sandwich as well.The bread is also good and at par with other Italian deli shops in the area. Quite chewy but not tough chewy even when it's cold. I wish the bread is warm (who can resist fresh breads right out of the oven), but then that's rather typical among Italian deli shops. And the size - oh my!!! Even for $12, with the amount of meats and cheeses that they put, it's so worth every penny. This shop is thus far my favorite Italian deli shop in NYC/Hoboken/Jersey City area. I would definitely come back here without any doubts!!! There are several excellent Italian deli shops in the area that I have personally tried, but this one is definitely very special and win my heart. It's somewhat a smaller shop. It's an honest, old school, and no frills shop. Not sure if it's COVID-19 era thing and they're running with minimal staffs, but when we're there, the shop / counter was run by only 2 people; possibly a husband and a wife. I felt that I was getting my sandwich from the old country - which felt like a legit thing!!By the way, for a first timer (like myself) ordering your food could be quite challenging and intimidating, especially with the add-ons like roasted peppers, basil, and etc.  You can't also spend 15 mins wondering what to order. You gotta order your sandwich pretty chop-chop. You have to appreciate the fact that they're only 2 people working in the shop and there might be customers waiting behind you. You can enjoy your order outside. There are some limited 3-5 outdoor tables right by the entrance door. There is no service though. The indoor dining area appears to be closed.
2021-06-25,5,I would give my left kidney just for one of these sandwiches. Best mozzarella in town. Make sure to grab lunch. Sandwiches are big enough to split, but that probably won't happen. Bring cash or get ready to use their atm.
2021-06-01,5,The best of the best!! These sandwiches are amazing like literally the best sandwiches that you'll ever have! This sandwiches are enormous by the way, you can't even fit it into your mouth I can only eat half because it's that big also definitely get the sundries tomatoes they are out of this world! This place is a small  mom and pop place they close I believe by 2/3pm they also have street parking and located on twelfth and Washington
2021-04-18,5,Old school deli run by a husband and wife that have been doing it right for a while.  This is a straightforward spot that has all the bells and whistles of your typical deli. They have huge sandwiches at an insanely reasonable price so you are covered.  I will say sometimes the sandwiches are so packed with meat and cheese that it is hard to eat but its better than skimping on the ingredients.I went with the chicken cutlet with american cheese mayo, lettuce, and banana peppers. So good and it was more than I could eat. The mozzarella is also a just order and they make it fresh daily.  When you order it on a sandwich is comes packed on there. Perfectly silky and milky and done just right. They also have hot food that sells out quick if you don't come early! The chicken parm is beautiful but they also have eggplant parm. The chicken cutlets are also solid so get them on a sandwich. I love Mom and Pop shops that do it right. I hope they stay here for many more years.  Highly recommend when in Hoboken.
2021-02-24,5,Hands down, the best mozzarella I've ever had. Came here with high expectations and they delivered! Usually delis are in a rush and don't have much time for small talk or providing top tier customer service, especially if they're really good and know it. But the person behind the counter was very entertaining and friendly too!We had gotten the Italian sandwich and breaded chicken and mozzarella sandwich. The Italian sandwich was delicious, meats were fantastic. However I would highly recommend the chicken and mozzarella sandwich simply based on the fact that you can really taste the cheese. And they are not shy with it at all! Definitely at this point my favorite deli in all of Hoboken. And one of the best quality sandwiches I've had.
2021-01-19,5,Food is so fresh and the portions are huge. I recommend trying the mozzarella and roasted red peppers they're good with any meats!
2021-01-15,5,Great mom and pop sandwich shop . Heaps of meat and fresh mutz.Next time I will ask to add the sweet peppers, olive oil and vinegar on my C large.(my fault as a newbie customer )
2021-01-13,5,What's not to love here? The sandwiches are MASSIVE with healthy portions of whatever you request. Made mine with prosciutto, hot capicola, mortadella, hot peppers and fresh mozzarella which took 3 sittings to finish . They are handling covid very well also with only 3 people allowed in the deli at a time. My favorite mozzarella in town hands down!
2020-12-19,5,Omg.  This muz/moz/mozzarella is out of this world.  We overdid it our first time and ordered way too much to take home.  But don't worry, none was wasted.  If you're looking for fresh mozzarella for your holiday platters, sandwiches or if you just love mozz and want to eat it by itself, this is the place to go.  Their chicken cutlet sandwich is solid as well if you're looking more than just mozzarella. We're back for our second time, stocking up for the "holidays"  aka we just needed an excuse to make it acceptable to eat another lb of mozz.  Def give this place a try and support this small business !  #shoplocal
2020-11-24,5,Hands down THE BEST Italian deli in Hoboken!!!My new favorite go to place!!!  The service this husband & wife duo provide is above par!
2020-09-30,3,Been in (downtown) Hoboken 25 years and love me some Fiore's and Vito's heroes. I eat there weekly. But often I would hear people singing the praises of M&P's. I decided to order an Italian Hero. I didn't spell it out, I figured they must have a standard Italian Hero on the menu. Asked for sweet peppers. They had in ready for pickup in 20 minutes.Basically it was boiled ham, salami, mutz, lettuce, tomato, roasted red peppers & oil/vinegar. No offense, but I kinda was expecting a bit more. I read reviews about how the sandwiches are "LOADED". I would agree - it was a big slab of ham & salami with two teeny-tiny slices of mutz on it.The mutz was delicious, no doubt. But they really were cheap with the amount of mutz on the sandwich. The meats - just your standard cold cuts. My guess it was Thumanns. I was thinking maybe they would have capicola or mortadella on the sandwich versus just a ham and salami sandwich.Also it was a bit soggy. Drenched in oil and vinegar, sitting for a bit, and it was a mess to eat. Was it good? Sure, I would rate like a 7 out of 10. But for my time and money, i'd pick Vito's over M&Ps. They just craft a nicer sandwich with the Vito's Hero. Probably won't come back. I don't get the "wow factor" everyone gives this place. It's okay.
2020-08-07,5,The Mutz melts in your mouth! The owners are pleasant.This Deli is a gem.Cash only!
2020-07-29,5,Absolute BEST mozzarella in Hoboken! The sub was HUGE, delicious, and super fresh! The owners were very friendly and attentive too. Highly recommend and definitely will be coming back! FYI, cash only
2020-06-27,5,Awesome amazing perfect place when you crave Italian sandwich! The best Italian deli place. I love their mozzarella!!! Recommend to everyone who likes Italian deli meat, mozz, anything!
2020-06-10,5,Ummm..I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHO'S BEEN KEEPING THIS DELI A SECRET FROM ME THIS WHOLE TIME?? Seriously? Incredible. Easily one of the best subs I've ever had in my life. Ham, cappicola, prosciutto, pepperoni, fresh mozz, a I had him addsundried tomatoes. Loved loved loved every bite I smashed into my face. Amazing sub, lovely staff, cute dog..do you need anything else? Nope, they got it all.
2020-06-05,4,As advertised, they really do have the best mutz. Has the feel of 1975 with everything fresh fresh fresh. Good quality salamis and prosciutto along with red sauce sandwiches
2020-05-23,5,Amazing, enough said. Best fresh mutz in hobokenJust remember,  cash only....................................
2020-05-21,5,This is Hoboken's little secret, the biggest most delicious sandwich in all of NJ, this place is with the likes of Katz's or Harolds deli, fresh mutz made daily, and L O A D E D sandwiches, no joke the average human can only eat 1/4 a sandwich in a sittingThey don't deliver so call ahead and pick up CASH ONLY but they have an ATM inside Seriously if you only have one day in Hoboken, make this your lunch stop
2020-04-18,5,The best mozzarella in Hoboken, the best mozzarella I have ever had.  The meatball and mozzarella sub is a thing of wonder - enough to feed a small family for under $10, amazing.I don't know if this place has changed much in years - I hope it does not change in the future...  I am not sure if there is anywhere I would rather get my lunch than here...
2020-03-07,5,These guys are the best! The best mozzarella in Hoboken, possibly even NY. The sandwiches are HUGE and fantastic. Italian gourmet products and the most awesome eggplant Parmigiano anywhere. Hands down the best Italian deli in NJ. Pete and Theresa are the best as well.
2020-02-18,5,This place has the best mozzarella in Hudson County. My family comes from nyc's upper west side to get mozz from here. The sandwiches are also great. There's no fancy add one like avocado as this is a classic old school Italian establishment - and believe me when I say that's how you want it!
2020-02-11,5,Best deli in Hoboken for sure. Huge super stacked subs for only around eight bucks! That's difficult to beat in this town. Make sure you get their award winning mozzarella. Always fresh and delicious.
2020-01-13,5,Just the most delicious fresh Italian food you could ever ask for - delightful warm and friendly people -we will be regulars !
2020-01-08,5,My Italian relatives come all the way up from North Carolina just to have these sandwiches. They are GINORMOUS and so delicious; if you're on a diet, definitely don't go here! Very old school NJ deli vibe like right out of the Sopranos. Great people who work there and endless combinations of Italians meats and of course the fresh mutz! Definitely get the roasted red peppers and sun dried tomatoes on top of your sandwich, game changer.
2019-11-18,5,After the unexpected closure of Fran's Deli, I tried several other Italian delis in town.  M&P will now be my go to.  Cholesterol levels be damned.
2019-10-25,2,I wanted so much to like this place. I went in around 1pm on a a Friday and ordered a 1/2 meatball and mozz sandwich. No go, out of meatballs. The guy behind the counter is friendly, authentic and been there 30 years. When he offered me the chick parm option I thought - ohhh chicken Parm is one of my favorites! Yes! No. No, chick parm. The hot sandwich was cold, the chick parm was soggy and bland. The crispy bread was not what I had hoped either. I'm hoping I can come back to update this review with better news in the future. Maybe by 1pm the steam tables were off and they were cleaned out from the lunch rush. Unfortunately, I'm just not inclined to go back.
2019-10-21,5,My favorite sandwich is Hoboken. Great Italian deli serving some huge sandwiches with great ingredients. The fresh mozz is worth getting every time!
2019-08-02,4,I can see why they won best muzz in Hoboken.Sandwiches are great.Two thumbs up.I'll be returning with bigger pants
2019-07-13,5,Hoboken is full of great sandwich options (Vito's & Lucas other top two) but this place wins hands down for a cold cut sandwich.  Unbelievable bang for the buck too.  Same or less price than anywhere else and probably 50-100% more sandwich.
2019-06-24,5,BEST MUTZ ON THE PLANET!!! The sandwiches are delicious, I've been dreaming about them since I had them last time which was a few years ago.
2019-06-15,5,There are a lot of really good Italian delis in Hoboken that are worthy of a trip. But this could be the best of the best.Went a couple of times recently and was blown away every time. The mozzarella is epic. The ingredients are great. The owners are welcoming.This is a place you can bring your friends from the city.. or from Italy and know they'll love it.
2019-06-06,5,Wonderful deli. Visited the morning my daughter and I were flying home to Houston.  The owner took special care to double wrap a sandwich so I could take it home for my son. It was delicious. The fresh mozzarella, the meat - just amazing. Do yourself a favor and eat here!
2019-06-04,5,Amazing sandwich! Two people could easily share a "half" size. I ate mine open-faced since it's filled to the brim with meats and cheese. The mozzarella is INCREDIBLE!
2019-05-09,5,I looooove this deli! I've been going here since I was a kid. My entire family loves it! It's our favorite Italian deli in Hoboken! They have the freshest mozzarella, made by hand the family daily. The family who owns the deli are amazing and dedicated to making quality fresh mozzarella and other delicious Italian dishes.
2019-05-07,5,My absolute favorite growing up and still is!!! They have the best salami and mozzarella!! Family oriented, great bread and also love their ziti!! My go to place when visiting NJ!!
2019-03-21,5,Old-school amazing!  Giant, overstuffed sandwiches with super-fresh ingredients run by the nicest Mom & Pop team you'll meet.  Very generous portions.  Everything is delicious here.
2019-03-20,5,I absolutely love this place.  I used to live a block away from here back in the early 90's and went here all the time.  I went out for lunch today with a friend visiting from Salt Lake City.  He said he was hungry so I said we need to go here.  He loved the chicken parm with fresh mutz.  I got the prosciutto with roasted peppers and fresh mutz. Delicious!!    What is even better is the same couple still running the place and serving up delicious sandwiches 20 years later!  Truly a mom and pop shop that takes great pride in their business !!
2019-02-22,5,In town from Alabama for a wedding and the bride had this place on the tip of her tongue as a place we should try. Oh My Goodness!  We arrived about 3:30 on a Saturday to find a short line. As our turn came up, we were presented with "I'm out of bread. It will be 20 minutes before the bakery delivers more."  I'm all about eating local when I travel and this place is clearly local, so my wife and I decided to wait. After a short time, they started stacking chairs. They explained that if they didn't close by 4:00 folks would come in and hang out until midnight, so we were the last customers of their day. The bread arrived on time, and my wife and I ordered a half sandwich each. We should have shared one half between us! I barely finished half of my half and my wife had 3/4 of her half left when she cried uncle. Never in my life have I had a sandwich with this much meat on it. Enormous portions, fresh bread, delicious meats, what more could you want?This is all buildup to the mutz-yes, I learned a new word today. [Mutz - Noun. Short for mozzarella]  I love cheese!  These folks make fresh mutz everyday. Because we had to wait, we were treated to a large slice one one of the best fresh cheeses I've ever eaten before we got our order. We Americans often describe our travels in terms of the foods we eat.  If you find yourself in Hoboken, this is a great place to make a food memory!
2019-02-22,5,It doesn't get much better than M&P Biancomano's sandwiches. Walk in and you'll find a shop that hasn't changed much over the years. You can expect a wait but it's worth it. My fiance and I heard the sandwiches were big so we each ordered a half. If you had told me it was a whole sandwich I would have believed you, though! The way they load up their sandwiches, even a half is massive!It's hard to choose which to order, all sound good, and all are good. Whatever you do, make sure you have mozzarella on yours. Theirs is amongst the best I've ever had. So soft and fresh. Regardless of what you get you'll love it and you'll be full!
2019-02-13,5,Life changing! This is the softest, creamiest, perfectly salted pillow of mozz you will ever have. Light years beyond any fresh mozz I have tasted. We each got a "whole" sandwich (meaning whole baguette) to make it worth our while. We got there on the early side because I hear they typically run out of ingredients by 3pm (or earlier)!We tried the prosciutto/mozz/roasted red pepper and the mozz/tomato/basil/balsamic (they were out of fresh basil so they used pesto instead). They serve it open faced with thick slices of mozz so they can get pretty unwieldy (not a bad thing!). The sandwiches were great but the real star was the mozz - I could eat it plain or as a caprese salad any day. The mozz was still warm, so if you take leftovers home it will harden up a little in the fridge and won't be the same as eating it right then and there.They also have some imported Italian groceries/snacks/drinks (san benedetto teas) and hot food. It's a small place so seating is limited.On the way home, I slipped into a cheese coma like never before - sleepy, calm, content, and not a care in the world!
2019-02-10,5,What a freaking sandwich!!! Had heard a lot about m&p and it surely lived up to the reputation. Walked in around 1pm on a Saturday for lunch. We saw how enormous the sandwiches were on yelp so we decided to split one half, which was absolutely the right call! There was only one person in front of us when we came in so we ordered very quickly. We went with sandwich C - ham, salami, prosciutto, capicola, mozz and then we added roasted red peppers and oil and balsamic.I've literally never seen so much meat or mozz stuffed into a sandwich. It was impossible to get one bite with everything in the sandwich because it was that wide. Definitely messy to eat! The mozz was the best part of the sandwich. The meats were great too but damn that mozz is on another level. The soft bread was good too but nothing to write home about. The sandwich was $10.50 - perfect size for two. Would definitely love to come back and try other sandwiches, bring home mozz, and get some of the hot food!
2018-08-16,5,I had a sandwich from here last week after living down the block for a few years. It was quite an amazing and satisfying sandwich at a great price! However I was a bit pissed after I ate it. I was pissed that I ever stepped foot in Vitos. Wasted 4 sandwich experiences of my life in that place. Italian Cuban? Pffff.... I can't wait to go back to M&P.
2018-06-22,5,Ordered the #8 with roasted red peppers and was in sandwich heaven - no words can describe the level of deliciousness. A close feeling to the level of happiness is like winning the lotto or finding treasure it's that good.
2018-06-08,5,This deli is the real deal. Serving "Sang-Wiches" so huge they're "UUUGE". Buy an extra roll, slap a slab of their homemade "Mutz" in the your Hoboken "Stick" and make two sang-wiches out of one! And Peter the owner will provide all the extra local flavor; a true Hoboken institution.
2018-05-31,5,I have been eating here since the late 80s, it is truly the best fresh mozzarella I have ever eaten! Most of the time when I order a sandwich with fresh mozzarella on it, just when I think he's put enough on, he excuses himself goes in the back and get some more and its still warm because it's made fresh on the premises! Everything there is fresh, authentic and the owners and staff are very friendly and accommodating.
2018-05-12,1,Ordered the chicken parm sandwich. After I ordered it I noticed they just got 4 pieces of already made chicken and put them in a sandwich without heating it, this threw me off since I didn't expect it to be cold. Got a huge sandwich so I'll give them that, but when I opened the packaging I noticed that the entire sandwich was very messy, which is normally not a bad thing, but here it was ridiculous. The sandwich started off good, but about 15 minutes in, the cheese and sauce had become cold and were being soaked up by the bread of the sandwich. At this point everything was becoming messy and nasty and was not worth it for me to finish the sandwich. Will not be going here again.
2018-05-05,5,Best sandwich in Hoboken . Love it lady at counter.  It's a must go. Hot Peppers were superb. Motz can't be beat. This pic is a MOTZ and Posuto sandwich can't beat it
2018-03-29,5,Hands down, the best Italian Deli in hoboken and the most delish mozzarella. We drive 30 minutes to get our mozzarella from M&P and wouldn't have it any other way. Their deli meats are fresh, the chicken cutlet has the perfect amount of breading, and the sandwiches are decadent and you can easily get two meals from a half sandwich. Plus, it's always a nice experience there!
2018-03-20,5,Been a True Customer throughout the Years . There sandwiches have Always been double the size of all competition in Hoboken! Where can You buy a sandwich that you can make 2 out of 1 and the quality and price is The Best ! Cold Cuts and Bread !!!!!!! Awesome
2018-02-26,5,In a town with some of the best delis, M&P can hold its own. The subs are massive and I think they have the best Italian style in Hoboken. Also, very nice staff.
2018-02-11,5,Uhhhhh, TO DIE FOR!The level of these sandwiches are unreal and you just can't beat the husband wife team serving you.  Hot subs and cold are equally amazing.  Home made daily mozz is something to be seen, look at the pics.....Get a half sandwich, it is MORE than enough.Also, great Italian grocery options....load up in pasta if you are local.What a place and can't say enough about how wonderful the owners were to us texans!
2018-02-05,3,Was very grateful that they were willing to take my order on Super Bowl Sunday so last minute. Always a great sandwich and HUGE portions!!!
2018-01-16,5,I love this place. It is a staple of uptown Hoboken.  The "Mutz" is top notch and one always receives a humongous helping. The cold cuts are of high quality, especially the roast beef which is cooked fresh every day.  The chicken cutlet sandwiches are to die for and they put about 9 cutlets on half a sandwich. A half sandwich is all you need which is a very large lunch. Do yourself a favor and split the half sandwich with a friend, you'll be full and satisfied.The husband-wife team behind the counter are very friendly and roll out sandwich's quickly. Be sure to give M&P's a try
2017-12-26,5,This review is long overdue. We were visiting NYC in December 2016 and a local we know took us here before our flight back to Seattle. The owners were very nice and the food was delicious. They even made us special sandwiches packed with various meats and cheeses for the flight home (which I'm sure everyone on the flight within smelling distance was jealous of us at this point). Anyway, I highly recommend this place!
2017-12-21,4,This place is great.  The food is top quality.  The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because you pretty much can't eat the sandwiches the way they are made.  The toppings fall out as soon as you try to bite down and the cold cuts slide off the bread.  You can't complain about the awesome amount of food they pour on their sandwiches but I'm dead serious they are impossible to eat like a regular sandwich.  You gotta move stuff around, take stuff out, break the bread in a few places and then finally you can squeeze the deliciousness into your mouth.
2017-12-08,5,The best Deli in all of New Jersey Mutz down. I get my fresh mozzarella here every Christmas, it melts in your mouth and doesn't last around my family. The sandwiches are made to order and have a generous portion of meat. What makes this place exceptionally special is the family, the make you feel like family. I've used them for catering parties as well. The hot food is as great as their sandwiches with very good pricing, especially for their quality.
2017-11-13,5,I went to college in Hoboken and would come here all of the time. Now, I'm a seasoned "adult" in Brooklyn and I still make a trip at least every month for a king sized sandwich accompanied by the best mozz you've ever tasted. I love the owners and I love everything about this place. That's it. Perfecto.
2017-11-08,5,The freshest cold cuts, the thickest slab of fresh mozz you can imagine and a sweet face to serve it all up to you. This place absolutely can not be beat. My only regret is not trying it sooner. There's no doubt this should be on top of your go to list for Hoboken. I mean who doesn't love a good Italian hero. When you walk in you get that incredible aroma that tells you you've made it. That overwhelming mix of cheese and meat ready to put all 5 of your senses on overload.
2017-11-04,5,My co-worker and I stopped in for lunch since we were in the area.  We happened to be walking by and it quickly got us in the mood for an Italian sub.  It's located on Washington Street near the quieter side of the main drag.   It was my first time here and it won't be my last.  WOW!  What a great local mom & pop deli/grocery.  This place appears to have been here for decades and it's no surprise why.Look for the board above the counter for the great variety of subs they offer.  I ordered the "E" on a half.  It's either a half or a whole.  A whole was basically a whole loaf of Italian bread.  I can eat with the best of them and a half was perfect for me.  The "E" consisted of salami, prosciutto, ham, provolone, and possibly something else.  It was incredible.  They don't skimp on the meat.  Just as impressive was the bread.  It held up perfectly the entire time.  The two nice older people behind the counter were the nicest people.  Very welcoming and polite.  It's also a nice little Italian market with different varieties of pasta, cheeses, etc.  There are several tables inside the deli and several tables outside as well.  The price was a bit higher than other spots but it's well worth it.  I will go out of my way to come here again.  It had to be one of the best subs I've ever had.   Cash only!
2017-10-05,5,I'm not italian, but I feel I should have been in another life because I freaking love italian food. This place seemed so authentic and exactly what I was looking for as someone who has just moved here from the south where it's virtually impossible to find tasty italian food. It was a little daunting walking into the shop and it seemed like everyone there was a regular. I just sort of stood there doe eyed staring at the menu overwhelmed until I just came up with something to get. There are a lot of options and it seems like basically you just order whatever you want from the meats and toppings available. I got a ham, prosciutto, mozzarella, and red pepper on the crispy bread. I will probably plan my sandwich a little more next time, but it was DELICIOUS. My husband and I shared this and...trust me unless you're an extremely voracious eater I would share it with someone. I ate like 1/4 before I tapped out. This is definitely the kind of sandwich that can keep you going all day and for the price (under $15) it can't be beat. I plan to come here regularly!
2017-09-16,5,This small Italian deli and grocer is without question my favorite spot in Hoboken. It is located on Washington Street and is easy to walk by, which would be a mistake. The homemade mozzarella (mutz) is out of this world! Clearly others are fans, as they have won Hoboken's Mutz Fest multiple years. My go-to is the meatball sub. Homemade meatballs are enormous, moist, and full of flavor. The bread it comes on is a buttery and soft ciabatta sub roll perfect to sop up the extra sauce - you can also request "crispy" bread which I recommend if you're taking the sub to go. Top with some of their homemade mutz and it's perfection!!! Unless you are incredibly hungry or sharing with a friend, the half sandwich is plenty. Their other subs are just as delicious, using beautiful meats and fresh ingredients. The staff are super friendly and old school, adorably speaking Italian to one another behind the counter. One note: it is a cash-only establishment.
2017-09-09,5,I can't say enough GREAT things about M & P Biancamano.  The hidden gem of Hoboken.  The subs are AMAZING and the couple that owns the store are the nicest people ever.  When you walk into the shop you are transported to what Hoboken used to me, family owned, mom and pop shops.  You can tell they put love into everything that they do and they love their customers.  The owners are so polite and friendly with customers, great people.   Everything is fresh and you must get the homemade fresh mozzarella on whatever sandwich you get.The subs are huge as well.  My favorite is the "C" - Ham, Capicola, Prosciutto, Pepperoni, and Fresh Mozzarella.  Throw some oil, vinegar, lettuce, and tomato on and it's a dream.  I love big portions and this sub is honestly enormous.  You'll either be splitting it or putting half in your fridge for tomorrow.. it's that big.  Tastes just as great though coming out of the fridge.Love supporting this place and recommend to anyone looking for a great bite to eat in Hoboken.
2017-07-28,5,Biancamano's is always a go to for great sandwiches and yummy mozzarella! As everyone knows, their sandwiches are HUGE! You can literally make 2 out of 1. I wish they delivered because sometimes they get so busy! But the family is always really nice and very friendly every time I go in.
2017-06-08,5,Everything about this Italian deli is perfection. From the ambiance, to the authenticity, down to that first bite of homemade mozzarella and delicious imported prosciutto on a crispy roll with balsamic glaze. Everything is pure perfection. Not to mention the value. A ten dollar sandwich lasts you the entire day. Seriously, I can't eat this sandwich anywhere else without comparing it to M and P. Easy 5 stars.
2017-06-06,5,Great family run joint. Friendly owners looking to take your orders. Sandwiches are great (but HUGE), which can make it challenging to stuff into your mouth. In any case, a great local spot, but it can get really busy during certain hours.
2017-05-29,5,A few years ago, I heard some of NFL broadcasters say that before a Giants or Jets game they always get something to eat here on Saturday. I understand why. Had a sandwich from here and it made me think of the "White House" in Atlantic City. I will be back.
2017-05-23,5,Best lunch hero I have ever had!!!  I highly suggest the chicken cutlet with roasted peppers and fresh mozzarella and you have the option of picking a crispy or soft piece of bread. Great and friendly atmosphere and you really can't go wrong with any type of sandwich.  This is my go to spot in Hoboken. Remember to bring cash!
2017-05-13,5,Hoboken, NJ  is known for its history, waterfront views, bars, and of course "mutz."M&P has been not just mine but my entire family's go to spot for Italian style sandwiches and mozzarella. Yes. There are many other places in town that others are loyal to but trust me when I say no one serves it up like Pete and Teresa (the owners).If you decide to get a sandwich anytime after 2:00pm you might be pushing your luck and get the sad news they're out of bread. That's because people line up early to get their hands on one of the signature sandwiches with mutz. I keep it simple and always order a ham, salami, and mutz sandwich. If I'm feeling daring I'll add some roasted red peppers. You can get your sandwich on a roll, half Italian bread, or a whole Italian bread both offering hard and soft. This sandwich is HUGE. They are known to load it up with the cold cuts and mutz. I always get a roll sandwich and at times when I've gotten a half it was to split it with someone. M&P has been around since it was "Old Hoboken." It's a true Italian family place filled with so much culture. They truly appreciate their customers and that's what makes you want to come back. I'll always be an M&P girl and wouldn't trade my loyalty for any other Italian spot.
2017-02-24,4,I've been hearing that the sammies here are bomb and one Monday afternoon, I finally got to try it. I ordered a prosciutto and mozzarella Sammie ($11.50). It sounds pricey for a sandwich but trust me, with the amount of meat and cheese they stuff in there, it's completely worth it. My boyfriend and I shared it as we were both stuffed! My only gripe was the bread. It was super chewy. I'm not sure if it was because I went midday and I got the second to last piece of bread. But I'm willing to go earlier next time and give it another try. Their mozzarella is just too good to pass up.
2017-02-22,5,Zomg their sandwiches are AMAZING.  I don't normally get super excited about Italian delis...but this place is above and beyond.  I've been a fiore's loyalist for years (and still think their roast beef special is fantastic), but I just tried M&P for the first time recently (and like every day thereafter) and I'm in love.First of all, their sandwiches are ginormous.  I had read reviews before going that said a full sandwich is easily two meals, but my husband didn't believe it, and insisted we each get a whole.  Boy was he wrong - each half was more than enough - and he's a big eater.  The half is about the size of a large sandwich elsewhere, and even the quarter alone is enough for lunch.  So already, hubs was super happy with this place.  What makes the sandwiches so filling though isn't the bread - it's that they're ridiculously generous with their fillings.  We always get a sandwich with fresh mozz and either ham, roast beef (my personal favorite), or prosciutto.  Their mozz is delicious- so fresh and creamy, and they give you giant slices so you can really taste and appreciate the cheese itself.  I never know how to tackle their sandwiches, because they're so large.But it's not like they're big to make up for a lack of quality - all of their ingredients are phenomenal.  My favorite part is the bread - they have two types: soft and hard.  Haven't bothered to try the soft, because their hard bread is literally perfect - crunchy on the outside, soft and pillowy on the inside.  It truly makes the sandwich (I'm not sure why fiore's doesn't use the same bread??)On top of all this goodness, what I love about M&P is that the people are the friendliest I've come across in Hoboken.  They clearly care about their customers and their product, and I love that they've preserved that mom and pop shop vibe, and they're old school Italian in the best way possible (they're always speaking to each other in Italian).I can't believe I hadn't heard of M&P all these years, and I sadly discovered it just as I was moving out of Hoboken, but I might be back frequently just to have their sandwiches.  So good!!
2017-01-28,5,They have REAL ITALIAN products and their Mozz is awesome. I come here for the fresh roast beef, Mozz and gravy hero's which always makes a mess and have taken out more of my ties than any other source lol. There is almost always a huge line here so call your order in advance or you will have a significant wait. The food I highly recommend!!!!!
2017-01-24,4,I don't know what the hell to tell you it's the best damn saingwich place in town yes better than Fiore even though I love them too. The sandwich is the size of my head and I've got a head so big I was once a world globe for Halloween. Amazing place I don't think I really need to go into much more detail because if you've been to an awesome Italian deli this place is like that place but a better place.
2017-01-16,5,I love great subs and sandwiches and this place does it for me! Their chicken parm sandwich is nothing less than amazing. The couple behind the counter are the sweetest too! I found it a little inconvenient that they only take cash so remember to have cash with you! Great place !
2017-01-08,5,The reviews are right!  They have THE BEST mozzarella!  HUGE sandwiches and great people.  We ate here as our "last" meal before heading to the airport to go home to Seattle.  We'd never been before, but a friend had read the great reviews.  They truly were right.  The homemade mozz was amazing, and I say that having had mindblowing fresh burrata mozz in Southern Italy.  It was that beautiful balance of moist, soft, and just the right touch of salt to pop the flavor.  The "half" sandwich is truly like a whole sandwich in most of the world.  I think there was over a 1/2 inch of meat in it.  The thing that I loved the most was to see local people who clearly were regulars and neighbors come in and out.  I can tell this is a part of that community.  I'm writing this review about a month after we ate there, and I'm still wishing I could go back.  I don't remember the names of the owners, but I do remember how nice and friendly they were.   This is the kind of place that makes a community and neighborhood give you that warm fuzzy feeling.  I wish them all the best.
2016-12-04,4,First and foremost, this place is CASH ONLY.  There are a few delis close by that have an ATM, but they're not easily found, so just bring cash.  The line was relatively long, and for good reason - the sandwiches were amazing.  For ~$12, you get a ginormous sandwich, with amazing cuts of meat and of course, MUTZ!  Excited to return to try other things!
2016-11-08,5,What can i say that hasn't been said?  Simply the best cold hero shop in Hoboken, run by the best owners in town.  I have never come here and not seen the two same owners slicing every sandwich perfectly to order.  Not only are they fresh and delicious but positively enormous. With great salads and Italian specialties to take home - you can't do any better anywhere.  Try them for catering!
2016-10-18,2,Hugh sandwiches and fresh delicious ingredients! The only downside of this place is no one is wearing gloves!! My boyfriend did become a little sick after eating a turkey sandwich. I really wanted to love this place but I will not return.
2016-10-03,3,They seemed to be just closing @ 5:15 on a Friday and were quite annoyed to take my very small order of a 1/4lb of mozz, which was solid.
2016-09-29,5,THE BEST.  Hoboken knows how to do Italian food right, and M&Ps has the absolute best Italian sandwiches.  Their outside awning says they have the best mozzarella and its true!  Not only is the food so fresh, but the sandwiches are fully loaded with a generous pile of meat.  My fiancé and I always split the sandwich and are completely stuffed.  You can mix it up with Italian or balsamic dressing.  Go here and you won't regret it!
2016-09-22,5,Stopped in at the bakery down the street and was referred by a local to this joint for a Mutz. Had no idea what that was but found out it was a sandwich. They also had homemade pasta with Alfredo and chicken parm. We were traveling that day so had the pasta and chicken parm for lunch and then ordered the Mutzs to go.  Everything was fantastic. A Mutz is a sandwich with loads of meat and fresh mozzarella.  (they make the mozz themselves on site.). Best mozzarella I've ever had and the sandwich was huge. One was more than enough for three of us. I had ordered two before I knew  that so we had the other for lunch the next day. It kept remarkably well.  Many places to choose for dining in Hoboken. We were glad we ended up here!
2016-09-16,5,Best place to get sub. Their mozzarella is to die for. Very friendly service . Franchise places need to take lesson from them in what true sandwich test like.
2016-09-15,5,Simple review.  Amazing turkey sandwich.  It is HUGE!  They are not open at night, but this place is awesome.  It is cash only.  If you see it open and want a deli sub, go!
2016-09-14,5,Probably the best deli subs in town. A half sub is good for lunch and dinner. A little pricey for your standard sub spot but they don't go short on ingredient and quality.  Classic Italian join ran by an elderly couple- self seating dining area. Cash only but they have an ATM next door. Must try their fresh mutz and variety of antipasta!
2016-07-26,4,Congratulations. Your purchase of a sandwich here is actually enough food for two meals; maybe three. Sandwiches run $10 - $11 a piece, and are loaded. Like, seriously loaded to the point of ridiculousness. The mozzarella is on another level here. It's sliced to order for each sandwich, and is so moist that when the sandwich is sliced, you can see the milky juices oozing out of the side. Doesn't get any fresher than that. Huge portion, fair price, excellent ingredients. Come hungry, and prepare for leftovers.
2016-07-21,5,I live on the same block as M & P, and its quite the treasure to have that close by. Older, friendly Italian couple runs it (I was $0.50 short my first time and she was all 'just bring it next time'). Sandwich I have bought there are always absolutely murdered in homemade mozzarella. Brought my parents here once and they won't stop talking about how we should go back.Of all the Italian delis in Hoboken, these guys have to be top 2 if not the best.Only wish they had better hours and were open more on the weekends but good for them for living la dolce vita.
2016-07-11,5,Omg! This is the best Italian sub I have ever ate in my whole entire life...nothing is compared to the roast beef salami ham and mutz...that was well worth the $10..if he didn't close so Early I'd be eating it alot more but sadly 9-5 ruins that :(...
2016-06-23,5,The hype is real, the hype is real!! Let's talk about my 2.27lb sandwich with the fresh "mutz". Look, I am a New Yorker that grew up eating a lot of ltalian heros from Arthur Ave in the Bronx and this sandwich from M&P just topped every hero I ever had and I feel like I am disgracing my neighborhood Italian Grandma or something by saying that but it's so good. Got a similar sandwich from Vito's but M&P is way better. If you stop by... Bring cash-- they don't take credit cards. It'll be worth it.. I promise.
2016-06-03,5,Their sandwiches are giantic! They certainly have the best mutz in Hoboken and their meatsbare delicious
2016-05-02,5,Wow, this place is amazing. Walked in for the first time after reading great reviews on yelp, and they were right! Small, but amazing Italian deli. I got a Roast Beef, Ham & Mozz on a sub with lettuce, tomato, onion, and roasted red peppers. The Mozz was amazing, just like all the other reviews say! The sandwich and a bottle of water was around $12, but the sandwich could last you 3 different meals. This food is very underpriced for what you are recieving. The people working there were very nice and seemed to really enjoy work, I believe they are the owners as I saw them in someone else's Yelp review pictures. Definitely recommend this place, and will definitely be going back.Side note, it is CASH ONLY, but there is an ATM in a pizza shop next door.
2016-04-14,4,Biancamano in my opinion is the 2nd Italian Deli in Hoboken - which is no slight as they had to best quite a few others to acquire that distinction. Only Fran's ranks above them. While they offer very similar sandwiches as the other delis, Biancamano definitely does have some delicious mutz that puts them on an elite level. I've had their mutz & prosciutto hero and it definitely left me with a smile. You can't go wrong with a sandwich here.
2016-03-23,5,A quick trip to Hoboken for a meeting started with lunch here. I've officially had the best mozzarella in Hoboken according to the people's choice award and I concur. Creamy fresh and full of flavor. I'm a south jersey guy so it's a hoagie to me, but the hero, sub or whatever it's known as in Hoboken is definitely the best I've ever had. We were greeted promptly and treated like old friends by the staff. When I'm back in town I will definitely start here.
2016-02-20,5,Everyone will tell you Vito's Deli is the best in Hoboken but they have absolutely nothing on M & P. These sandwiches are to die for! I've tried quite a few subs in my life and the first one I had here (roast beef and fresh mutz) was the best sandwich I've ever had in my life; the roast beef was so juicy and flavorful you need no condiments and the mutz...wow. The best mozzarella I've ever had. Also they load that bread up so high with your choice of meats and cheeses that the damn thing can't even close! A typical sandwich like I got today--roast beef, turkey, mutz and L/T--ran me $10 but it's by far more than one meal. Got through almost half and had to stop myself and get the rest wrapped up haha. Also, the family that runs it are such kind, sweet, helpful people. Definitely good people; the kind you feel great about supporting. I can't praise this deli more...my new obsession when I'm in Hoboken.
2016-02-11,5,BEST MOZZ EVER! I love mozzarella and I try it at almost every deli I go to. Their sandwiches are huge and you definitely get your money's worth. I've had their pasta and other hot sandwiches which are also very good. I want one right now. thanks guys.
2016-01-04,5,There is one complaint I have heard from others about this place...."The sandwiches are TOO BIG!". That is the most awesome complaint you could hope for in the food business. Anyway, this place is on my block. The mutz is award winning, with good reason. All the sandwiches are high-quality, but I tend to go with more tradition Italian specialties like mortadella, as a compliment to the mutz. If you don't know what mortadella is, you should maybe re-examine your life priorities.
2015-12-16,5,Rarely leave reviews, but this place is by far the best deli I've ever gone too.  The workers are straight from Italy, amazing genuine people who run the shop like an actual deli in Italy.  Sandwiches are affordable with a tonnnn of cheese and meat loaded on there.  The mozz is literally award winning out of this world and the prosciutto is the most fresh I have EVER had.  I have friends who visit me in Hoboken solely for this deli.
2015-12-12,5,Totally rediculous sandwiches at this joint!  I have been eating sandwiches for here for years. These are not your typical deli sandwiches. I call them "lip splitters" for good reason, they are over stuffed with the best meats and cheeses on incredible Italian bread.I can only speak to their sandwiches but I am sure the other deli items are on point as well.Tip. Street  parking only and hard to findTip. They cook their own roast beef. Usually ready around 1100. Goes fast so get in early.Tip. If the have the hard Italian rolls left they are what takes the sandwich to the next level.Tip. Just order a half. It is gynormous. The whole could feed a family.
2015-12-11,5,Meats? More meats. Meats? More meats. Meats? Meats.My most sincere apologies to Bova's Bakery in Boston - your reign of "best Italian sub" ended the moment I took my first bite.A good measure of any deli like this is how strong of an Italian they have - and believe me, it is AMAZING. For $9, I got a fully loaded Italian piled so high (with some of the tastiest Italian meats i've ever had) that the bread wouldn't even close . It lasted me two lunches, though it was so good I'm surprised I didn't kill the whole thing in one sitting.And this was just ONE sandwich. I still need to try the roast beef, the mutz, the various parms...but I know they will be amazing, because this one sandwich...it's hard to find the right words to accurately describe it's greatness. I'm an Italian guy through and through, so I could come here every single day.Even if you aren't in the market for a sandwich, they have other Italian food, Italian sides, and a lot of Italian groceries to buy.I was the only one in there (late lunch) and had time to stare at every single thing they sold and chat with the awesome owners (who spoke, of course, Italian) while I ate my food.There are a lot of places to go in Hoboken for food like this, and many of them are fantastic - but M&P, at this moment, tops the list for me.Go here. Eat sandwiches. Be Italian.
2015-12-05,5,A friend was working in Hoboken & asked me to meet him for lunch. He wanted to go to M & P Biancamano, a Hoboken institution. 30 years ago he lived directly across the street and although he moved out in 96, he still considers this place to be like home. It's really old school & every year they win the Best Mutz contest. Food is great, sandwiches are pricey but worth it. The sandwiches were around 10 each but they can feed a family of 4. My buddy's sandwich was sopressata, mozzarella & peppers.  He inhaled half. Me? I ate 1/4 of my roast beef, ham & mozz and wrapped the rest. Ate another 1/4 at home, shared some with the husband, and then the evil dog made off with the last of it.Delicious! They haven't sold out to the Boar's Head mafia!
2015-11-29,5,Could this be the best sandwich in town? No wait, in the city of Hoboken?  Could I go as far to say It might be the best sandwich in the WORLD???  Abso-MUTZ-ely. They really put the time and love into making your sandwich. Just watch them do it and you'll see.
2015-11-05,5,Best sandwich and Been nominated for best mutz for 3 straight years can't ever go wrong here they give you a good sandwich...it's a must go spot
2015-10-29,5,True story. I carried their meatballs on a plane all the way back to Los Angeles and they were still amazing.
2015-10-25,5,The best mozzarella I've ever had or as they would like to call it "mutz" staff was helpful and friendly and the sandwiches are good also! Nice piece of history
2015-08-29,5,Oh my goodness - what a fantastic deli! I have been living here for 3 years and always wanted to try a traditional Italian sandwich! The service was perfect, the meat and mozzarella fresher than any other deli I have ever been to. Don't get me started on the bread - I could eat ten loaves! We got the C it was A++
2015-08-26,5,Very busy during rush hours but well worth the wait. Cash only and good luck with parking, dont double park and lose your spot on line.
2015-08-10,5,Stopped in for lunch to try this place out. I am glad I did ! The sandwich they made was delicious!!!  The Mutz is to die for and the sandwich was huge and wide. Made to perfection. Highly recommended to all for lunch and dinner. Hot foods are also available
2015-07-30,5,Mom & Pop shop to the core, and it's worth every dollar. The half of sandwich you can easily split with another person, just remember to bring cash!
2015-07-28,5,I was doing errands and wanted to try something different for lunch so I decided to get a sandwich here. I got chicken and mozzarella which technically wasn't on the menu but the guy helping me, I assume the owner, had no problem with that and was very friendly. The portions were very generous. The mutz was cut thick and was amazing. I could only eat half of the sandwich it was so big, I can't wait to eat the other half! I will definitely be back!
2015-07-20,5,This is probably one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten.The mutz- OH EM GEE!!!! It is literally THEE BEST!!! I got the roast beef, turkey, mutz, roasted pepper, and onion and it was sooooo filling... Got the half, and you can literally split it with someone and still be full. I stuffed it down b/c it was soo good. The couple working there (I'm guessing the owners) were super friendly.It is a bit pricey but worth every penny. I paid $13 for my sandwich and a water.Seating outside and inside.MUST HAVE THE MUTZ HERE!Cash only!
2015-07-11,5,My absolute FAVORITE place, hands down. My father and grandfather went here for lunch. When my dad brought home 1/4 of his lunch sandwich left over me n my brother would literally fight each other over it-it's that serious. Pete and Theresa are amazing people, I hope n wish you stay there forever. They are a beautiful family and when you walk in, it's like walking into their kitchen at home. Best Italian deli in the U.S. whether you order hot or cold, hard or soft, huge portions, best hand made mozzarella and you will NEVER leave hungry. Thank you M&P xoxo
2015-07-08,5,Favorite Italian deli in Hoboken. So so so good. We drop in for sandwiches, mozzarella to take as a hostess gift...if it doesn't get eaten by us. Humongous sandwiches, great to take home or sit inside or outside with.
2015-06-23,5,Want a real italian sub with real deli meat? Come to M& P Biancamano. I have come here a couple of times before but this time was a little different. My wife went into the store and ordered a prosciutto and mozzarella sub as we originally planned. Guess what? They run out of bread and mozzarella. No problem though, the prosciutto, the swiss cheese and the vast array of cured meat more than make up for the inconvenience. We just went to a bakery for bread, problem solved.The prosciutto is heaven on earth and at this place, the quality is excellent. I will come back again and again. Great customer service as well, even when the mozzarella is all gone which just happens to be the best in hoboken.
2015-06-16,5,You know your sandwich is great if a random stranger on the street walks up to you to ask where you got it from. Prosciutto, soft take-apart mozzarella, hot peppers, sweet peppers and mustard. All for $10.75.
2015-06-03,5,Excellent. Very friendly folk. Food is awesome. Fresh mozzarella is what they're known for but everything is good here. Sandwiches are huge. Definitely a big bite so be prepared.
2015-05-27,5,So I just saw a write-up on Yelp on local Italian delicatessens.  And guess what? My favorite was listed first.  My husband and I haven't lived in Hoboken for many years, however, we know where THE BEST Italian deli is. We've been going to Biancamano's for many years- even back when Peter's parents owned and ran the business. The best Italian deli, hands down ( and there are a lot of Italian deli's in Hoboken). Teresa and Peter are very hard working and cook the best authentic Italian food.
2015-04-23,5,This place is everthing you would expect from an Italian deli.  I ordered a sandwich which must of had a half pound of assorted cold cuts.  The bread was fresh and tasty.  The best part was the fresh muttzarella. Huge tasty sandwich at a reasonable price.  Hiny. You should probably share a sandwich with someone.  It really is a lot for one person.
2015-04-03,5,This is my new favorite lunch spot since moving uptown and took a job working from home most days. This is an old school place, simple as that. It's deceptively spacious inside with seating inside and out. I teetered on 4 stars because they don't take credit cards, but I couldn't bring myself to do it, I love it that much.They don't have a billion options but what they do have is outstanding. The mutz is divine. It is probably one of the only places in town that rivals Fiore's mutz. It is quite literally mom and pop. The couple that runs it are the nicest people and always smile and say hi. That is why I love it.The sandwiches are ginormous. When I saw that in other reviews, I thought pfft I can eat a whole one...Not happening. One half is enough for a meal. And each sandwich runs $8-10! One of the best values in town. When I have cash on hand, this is my only choice for lunch.You absolutely will not be disappointed grabbing a hoagie here.
2015-03-20,5,Best value in all of town.  The portions are insane. Take a look at the pics here to get a sense.  Personal favorites for me are the Chicken Parm, Ham,Cappicola,Prosciutto,­Pepperoni & mozzarella, and also Turkey, Mozz and roasted peppersMr and Mrs B are very nice as well.  I'm always shocked by Hoboken people who have not tried this place.  I highly recommend a visit
2015-03-19,4,This review pertains to the 'Hoboken Mozzarella Tour' I took last week!  This is not an official tour--just something I decided to embark upon during my visit up North.It is a comparison between 5 different Hoboken delis that make fresh mozzarella cheese.Growing up in Hoboken I feel like I know a few things:  Good pizza, good bagels, and the best mozzarella cheese on Planet Earth.I admit I was, and am, biased.  For the last 28 years I've gone primarily to Vito's Deli. It's always been my, and my mother's, favorite.This time around my boyfriend (who had never had any Hoboken mozzarella cheese before) and I decided it was time to put the cheese to the test.  I'm sure we missed a few places but we had limited time so we decided to try 5 of the highest rated, longest standing, and most renowned in town.My boyfriend never had fresh mozzarella before, so he didn't even recognize this as mozzarella cheese.  Of course I told him, 'this IS mozzarella cheese. Everything else you've had packaged to date is an imposter.'I think it's important to know exactly what you're tasting, so I recommend you taste the mozzarella in each location by itself PRIOR to/INSTEAD of just ordering it in a sandwich.  The taste by itself will really show you what the mozz is made of.Here's how the tour went and brief feedback for each location's mozzarella. My feedback and ratings (above) are solely based on the caliber/taste of mozzarella cheese, not the quality of everything else they sell or the service they provide.They are ALL in comparison to Vito's since that was my baseline.  Vito's is made fresh 4 times daily.  After tasting some of the best choices in Hoboken, I've come to the conclusion there is simply no better fresh mozzarella cheese in town than Vito's. Or anywhere in the world as far as I'm concerned. It's still my favorite. Stop 1: Vito's: Buttery, soft, warm, wet, salty, and literally melts in your mouth Stop 2: Biancamano: Great mozzarella taste overall, a little chewier than Vito's, nice amount of salt and a little wet from the brineStop 3: Lisa's: Great taste inside, but not salty with each bite on the outside.  Also a bit chewier than Vito's Stop 4: Fiore's: The saltiest of all 5 mozzarellas.  Also was the coolest (temperature-wise) and was slightly chewier than Lisa's and Biancamano 5: Luca Brasi: Coldest (temperature-wise) of them all, nice amount of salt, not too buttery however.  Unfortunately I found the texture to be more like cottage cheese once you start chewing it.*This exact review is posted across 4 different locations on my 'Hoboken Mozzarella Tour.'
2015-02-17,5,Their Sandwiches are the BEST. large portion of cold cuts on your choice of bread soft or hard. the mutz is fresh and soft. Their  hot food is freshing made every day. and the prices are fantastic!
2015-02-07,2,My first experience here was too bad to go back, maybe it was an off day, I'll never know. I ordered the chicken parm sandwich, unlike any I've had in that the sauce seemed dull in color and taste and the cutlets were breaded more like a floury francaise then parm. I also tried the capicola, prosciutto, and mozzarella hero with peppers. Each item was nice on its own, but it was drowned in salt, that you could see all over the sandwich interior, each item is inherently salty, so maybe you add a pinch for the cheese, but this was way too much.
2015-01-29,2,The sandwich is amazing!I was so happy to find this place BUTthen i went today n saw the owner making my sandwich w bare hand no gloves...he just handled the cash n scratch his back n touched salami n lettuce w all bare hand!!!YUK!!!! I lost all my appetite... It's sad ~~This place was sooo good! Really wish these lucky old couple have awakening on hygiene for their customers.
2015-01-24,5,Best sandwiches and meals around. Nicest family that owns the place and serves you great food.Never had a bad experience there. More people should go there.
2015-01-24,5,Outrageous sandwiches, generous portions of delicious high quality meats, cheeses and fresh mozzarella all cut right in front of you, generous portions of delicious high quality meats and fresh mozzarella. A true mom and pop shop.
2014-12-23,5,Love this italian deli.  large portions for what you pay and delicious! best muttz in Hoboken.
2014-11-07,5,The sandwich is massive, cheap and high quality.  Mutz is homemade, in the saltier and heavier side - very delicious and satisfying.I can't wait to go back tomorrow.
2014-10-11,5,It really doesn't get any better than Biancamano's.  I've been coming here since I was a little girl and it has been my dad's favorite place since the 80s.  Mozzarella is out of this world and sandwiches are always overflowing.  I always order turkey, mozz, and tomato.  Mario and Teresa are the sweetest!
2014-09-27,5,Fantastic little deli on washington. Highly recommend it and definitely coming back again. Food is amazing and the owners are so nice. Come here and you won't be disappointed
2014-09-16,4,Huge sandwiches with great cold cuts and excellent mozz
2014-09-01,4,The portions here are ridiculously huge. I ordered a half sandwich and barely finished half of it. I got ham, cappicola, and fresh mozzarella with lettuce, tomato, onion, hot cherry peppers, and extra oil and vinegar. They charge you 25 cents for each topping so being the condiment queen that I am, it added up pretty fast. Other than that it was friendly service and I loved that we could actually sit down (inside or outside) unlike most delis in Hoboken.
2014-08-25,5,Best Sandwich in Hoboken and that is saying a ton. I love sandwiches and the "C" is the best I've ever had. I cannot comment on the others though, I'm sure they are awesome too but I don't have the will power to even try any other sandwich than my true love. Frankly any one giving less than 5 stars is clueless and should sober up. The Italian couple who operate this gem are great people and I wish them nothing but continued success as they deserve it and more as well.Check it out, I guarantee you will not be disappointed!!
2014-08-22,5,I stopped in here for a sandwich upon recommendation of a friend. Wow, just WOW. This place is amazing! I wish I could give it 6 stars!!!!!!Decor: It's a legit Italian deli so there isn't much room for anything but ordering and waiting. They do have a few tables inside and outside, however, so that is nice. Everything is clean and inviting and you can smell the freshness of ingredients.Bathroom: I'm going to guess that they do not have one for customer use.Staff: They man and woman working the counter, I'm assuming the owners?, are awesome. They are very friendly, eager to take your order (and make your food), and, at least for me, seemed to read my mind of exactly what I wanted. You can tell they care about their customers, it shows in everything they do.Food/Drink: I had a classic Italian sub w/ two bags of chips. The sub was incredible. I have never had anything like it. The meat was fresh, the mustard and vinegar really popped and the mutz... my god, THE MUTZ! There is definitely a reason they won Best in Hoboken. Honestly, I am not exaggerating, this place has changed my sandwich life.Value: You get a sandwich that is ridiculously delicious, and HUGE!, and it's just a couple bucks. I think my whole lunch was just over $10 and that is fantastic (because there was enough food for two meals, no joke). You get MORE than your money's' worth here.This place is, hands down, the best sandwich shop in Hoboken and, without a doubt, the best sandwich shop I have every tried. I will always order from here from now on, there is no other place in my opinion.
2014-08-19,4,Very cheap, MASSIVE sandwiches. I saw one guy leaving with a pretty large sandwich, and ordered the large thinking that's what I'd get. Little did I know it was twice the size! The owners are nice, and the sandwiches are completely overstuffed, and to the people complaining about that: that's a very happy problem to have. Their mozzarella is fresh and you pretty much get a brick of the stuff. I left very full. Love it.
2014-08-17,5,Hoboken's hidden Gem.  BEST SANDWICHES IN HOBOKEN!!  And I say that with confidence.  BE HUBGRY, sandwiches are HUGE and very inexpensive.  They could charge double for the sandwich and it'd still be worth it.  If you haven't made it here yet, YOU ARE MISSING OUT.
2014-08-13,5,I've grown up going to this family owned and run deli and I can honestly say it's the best deli in the area. Like everyone has said before the mozzarella is amazing and the sandwiches are so big one could feed you for the whole day. Finally the husband and wife team that work behind the counter couldn't be nicer.
2014-08-13,5,the BEST cheese. We had a cheese competition- got mozzarella from Fiores, Vitamia and M&Ps. The cheese here was our favorite by far- texture and taste. The owners were very friendly as well. My recommendation: go to M&P for cheese, Fiores for garlic red peppers and bread. You won't regret it.
2014-08-11,4,Love sandwiches and this is one of the best places in Hoboken ever! A sandwich actually fills me up but of course I can eat another
2014-06-24,5,This place is so good that no joke I started salivating as soon as I even decided to write a Yelp review.I love sandwiches. Truly, I could eat them every day 3x a day. I think the turkey, peppers and mozzarella sandwich I had here was the most delicious sandwich to pass my lips. There are no condiments. Zero. It's just fresh baked bread, flavorful marinated peppers, the most delicious melt-in-your-mouth mozzarella and turkey that should win a prize. Seriously. I live in Brooklyn and will now cross two rivers just to get a sandwich here- that's how good it is.Also- this is one of the those places where everyone seems a little skeptical to walk in but once you set eyes on your sandwich you fall in food love and one bite in and boom- turns out it's true love.
2014-04-22,5,Now I know why M & P Biancamano won the Hoboken Mutzfest last year!I find it so much easier to come to Italian delis in Hoboken during the week after work.  The parking seems to be better, got one right out front today.  This is strictly a take-out place though there are a couple of tables out front.  The sandwich WOW!  It was so big I only ordered 1/2 and had some when I got home and the rest was dinner for me and the wife.  The sandwich was the Super C special on the recommendation of the woman behind the counter.  It was a great call, I  enjoyed it immensely.  Trust me.. all you need is 1/2.  It was packed with ham, cappicola, prosciutto, pepperoni, and can't forget their award winning fresh mutz topped off with lettuce, tomato, spicy mustard, oil and vinegar.  Total price for the sandwich, $ 8.75, such a deal!Also, they have a small selection of salads and hot daily specials.  Definitely worth a look if you are in the area.Mangia Bene!
2014-04-17,5,Very delicious Italian sub. I was never a fan of sandwich but this got me addicted.
2014-04-07,4,I'll preface this by saying I've grown up with delis everywhere around me consider myself a deli connoisseur. With that said, now that I moved here to hoboken from ny I didn't know what to expect from the delis here. So far so good!This place is great. The owner was very friendly (gave me a sample of muttz) attentive and accommodating. I'm not a huge mozzarella guy but certainly I can distinguish between good muttz' Meats galore, everything galore, the term overstuffed is an understatement here at this place! I can eat....but I couldn't finish my half a meat sandwich. Normal ppl can split a half sandwich and get two sodas for around $10! That's a deal!Next time I go (and there will be a next time) I will have to get something with a more even vegetable to meat ratio! Lol
2014-04-01,5,Best Mutz in the STATE food and people are excellent, clean and very professional. Mom and pop place, worth every penny and a Whole sandwich is a whole loaf of bread. Highly recommend you try it, I know I will be back.
2014-03-31,4,The Mozzarella is the best I've ever had.  I love fresh mutz, but I often find it a little on the bland side, but this was perfect.  As far as the sandwich, it was a mountain of meat.  It was definitely delicious, but woah.  They put on so much meat, it was impossible to actually close it and eat it like a sandwich.  I'm normally totally fine with lots of mean, but I think if you're going to use that much, you really need bigger bread, and perhaps cut the bread all the way through so there can be a top and bottom, and then you can actually taste the ingredients together, like you're supposed to.  This was more like an open face sandwich. If I had a fork and knife, maybe it would have been OK, but I'm not really an open face sandwich type of guy.  I'll definitely go back, though and I'd still recommend it to anyone.  It's worth a visit, even if only for the cheese!
2014-03-22,4,This place did not disappoint. The mutz is really great and the lunchmeat was tasty. We shared (seriously, trying to finish one seems close to impossible) mutz, ham, pepperoni, prosciutto with roasted red peppers and lettuce. Honestly, I could have left out the lettuce and the peppers because the sandwich was so stuffed it was impossible to taste them at the same time as the cheese and meat. Speaking of stuffed, I actually didn't like how stuffed the sandwich was. It was almost impossible to eat and just seemed a little excessive. I would have been fine with half the meat.But, it was delicious and the owners are so very friendly. I will definitely be back.
2014-03-21,3,The sandwiches are good and huge. Mozzarella is great. It stops there.My latest trip really turned me off.  The husband and wife that run the place are nice but I think they need an updating on health codes.  I'm usually not one who cares about this stuff.  I eat anything from anywhere.  I eat off trucks, in greasy spoon places, off street carts, dirty water hot dogs, nothing really phases me.  But the last time I went in here, they have the vegatables for the sandwiches sitting out in the open.  Peppers, onions, tomatoes, lettuce.  All out.  They use one cutting board for everything.  And they handle money and food at the same time. I don't care that they don't use gloves to make the sandwiches. That's not a big deal. But turning around, handling cash, making change, and going back to making sandwiches is a no-no.  Money is one of the dirtiest things out there. Hire someone to work only the register or wash your hands in between.  Why am I complaining?  Well last time I ate there, everyone in my house got sick.
2014-03-15,5,Just had the best sub I've had in Hoboken in the four years I've lived here. I got turkey and mozzarella and it was jam packed for $6.50! I could only eat half due to how much turkey and mozzarella they put on and am looking forward to eating the other half for another meal. The customer service was really nice too. Just beware it's cash only.
2014-02-05,5,Great sandwiches and the best mozzarella in Hoboken!!! Sandwiches are huge so you can defintely share with another person.
2014-02-05,5,Exceptional sandwich!!! stuffed, mozzarella is the best in Jersey, and the price is right !! 5 stars!!
2014-01-31,5,Washington street doesn't have too many gems, but when it comes to subs... There is no other place like it!!! They are but gusting, tummy luving, taste bud huggin, subs...you'll take bite after bite after bite never wanting it to end... This is the only place to get a sub...only!! Mutz is a must!
2014-01-21,5,Even if I'd have wanted to I wouldn't be able to give this place less than 5 stars. The quality and amount of food you get for the price is just ridiculous. Massive sandwich for $8, can satisfy you for at least 2 meals, and probably the best mozz I've ever had. Great kind and friendly owners. Easily 5 stars.
2014-01-12,3,The owners were friendly and made me feel at home. I went for lunch and had the #1 -- an Italian sub that came with fresh,  delicious cold cuts. My only issue was that the sandwich was TOO LOADED. I couldn't enjoy it as a sandwich. I had to eat the cold cuts separately from the bread. I went for a sandwich and had a meal of cold cuts with a side of bread. Some people might be OK with that, but I wasn't. While I was tackling this behemoth of a sandwich, two different parties came in and both left with at least 2 lbs of the MOZZ. Judging by the previous reviews, the mozz may be the main reason to come here. I'm making this conclusion based on those two customers AND the fact that after I asked for the other half of the "monster" to be wrapped up so I could take to go, the owner told me, "Next time-ah come fo' da Mozzarehhllaa!"  I'm sure it's legit. I'll for sure be returning for the mozz and my 3 stars will likely jump to 5 :)Pic of my sandwich below (could've fed an African village; I don't mean to be insensitive, but it was huge):
2013-12-30,4,Visited this place because I saw the reviews were extremely good. They weren't lying. The sandwich was great. If I would have know It was as big as it is I would have only got one to split between my wife and I. Instead I got one for each of us. Wow!!! That was a lot of food. Good for leftovers. The owner was extremely nice and made you feel very welcome. Will definitely be coming back.
2013-11-18,5,I can always tell if an Italian deli is good if, despite being full, I can't resist finishing the second half.  M&p is one of those places- one of he best Italian subs I've ever had with generous portions of incredible mutz.  The owners are down to earth and put out an amazing product
2013-10-30,5,This is the only five star rated Yelp place to eat in Hoboken...Can you believe that and it is a deli!This place will not disappoint, great Italian sandwiches, cold-cuts, pasta, and delicacies! A sandwich is not cheap but even a half of sandwich can fill two people!Possibly the best Fresh Mozz ever!!!There is a reason that this place has the highest rating in Hoboken, and it isnt hype!In fact it is probably more of an untold secret in the land of the trendy hipsters who thrive on superflous narcissistic notions and blatant materialism...
2013-10-03,5,Nobody makes an Italian sub like they do on the east coast. At least that is what I have come to find out. I was visiting NYC from the west coast and had a friend introduce us to this fine establishment on our way to the airport. I ordered a combo A to share with my boyfriend. Let me tell you! My boyfriend can eat like it's no one's business. We ordered a whole sandwich thinking it would be no sweat to polish it off before our flight. The thing was STUFFED TO CAPACITY with sopressata, salami, mortadella, capicola, mozzarella cheese, lettuce, tomato, hot peppers, and oil/vinegar. The owner sliced the sub into quarters, rolled them up in wrapper, and bagged it for us. Carrying that bag around was like carrying a brick. It was dense. It was heavy. Upon first bite, we realized that we were in WAYYYY over our heads. I couldn't even take a bite of everything at once. I had to take a bite of bread, then bite the meats and cheeses, and then bite the other side of bread. There is just no way to smash that thing into a good biteable size. I swear. Albeit, we were both able to finish a quarter each and save the rest for after the flight. It was delicious and very well priced.
2013-09-27,5,I'm a little biased because I know the Biancamano family fairly well, living across the street from them the first 7 years I lived in town (1999-2006).  I'm now about 10 blocks away but I ALWAYS make the trip when I'm going to a deli.  I pass Lisa's on the way, which is a perfectly fine deli but not Biancamano's.I tend to be a creature of habit, and here is no exception.  I always get the turkey, provolone and roasted red peppers on a crispy.  The turkey and provolone are high-quality (as is everything from Bianco's) but the roasted red peppers make the sandwich and are awesome.  We've also gotten hot food over the years here and it's all good also of course.  While you're waiting (it won't be long) grab some Italian candy.  The sandwich is huge and incredible.  Heck, I might head over there today.The Biancamanos are great people, care about the customer and are always friendly and a great part of the community.  I know the other delis in town are super good also, but Biancamano's deserves more local fame than they have now.
2013-09-16,5,M&P Biancamano is simply world class. I went here to buy some subs for a tailgate at MetLife stadium. The subs were just beautiful. I promptly took pictures of them and sent them to my friends in Seattle, they were blown away. We just don't have these types of places on the West Coast.
2013-08-26,4,One word... MEEEENK!!  Little old deli run by what seems to be a husband and wife team... They move quick and the sandwiches are on point... I had a sandwich with prosciutto, soppressata, fresh mozzarella, lettuce and tomato... The fresh mozz is delicious and they don't skimp on the amount they give you or the fullness of your sandwich... Just might be my new favorite deli in Hoboken... A home run!
2013-08-24,5,That's a damn fine sandwich.  So huge.  So perfect. Get a half, have half of the half now, then the other half later.  And that's all you will need to eat for the day.I got ham, salami, mutz ltm and the bf got the B.  the roast beef is made in house and nice and rare.I wish I could go here more but I would be so obese.
2013-08-22,5,5 stars for this place...what a little gem. The mozzarella was amazing!! Definitely worth a trip...I went with the "Special C!"
2013-08-19,5,I came here on a Friday afternoon for lunch, since I work really close to Hoboken and got myself the C since it seemed to be the sandwich to get at this establishment. As I waited on line, I noticed signs that read "Cash Only" and I thought I had enough cash on me without checking. It turned out that I was a few dollars short and had to scramble back to my car and dig up coins out of my cup holder. When I got back to the store and it was finally my turn to order, the lady asked me what I wanted and walked away, so I was left with a confused look on my face. The husband then joked about it and reassured me that she wasn't ignoring me, but was waiting for the new shipment of fresh bread. We got a good laugh out of it. When she finally started making me the sandwich, I saw her just load on fresh cut meat right on to the bread. It was overloaded, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. The half sub is more than enough and more. I ate half of the half and the rest of it a few hours later.This place is delicious and you get a lot for your money. On top of that, the old couple were extremely friendly. Another small note, there's a little old grandma that can barely walk making the hot food in the back kitchen. That's how you know the place is real Italian!
2013-08-07,4,I can see how they won the Mutz fest in Hoboken.  Very tasty mozzarella.  Adds a great flavor and texture to the subs.  Can't wait to come back.
2013-07-26,5,The mutz is the best in Hoboken (People's Choice award winner at the Hoboken Mutzfest). Very good French baguette style bread. And loads of deli meat. AND I MEAN LOADS. The owners are an Italian couple that's always there, and they are really nice people. The mutz! The mutz! The mutz!
2013-07-14,5,Hands down the best mozzarella I've ever had.  It's fresh as can be with the perfect blend of salt.  Slip that bad boy on a fresh loaf of italian bread along with a few basil leaves and olive oil and get ready to be transported to paradise instantly.
2013-06-17,5,i found this place in 1996 looking at nj monthly in 1996. they had the 10 best places to eat at. when i read it this place was only 1/2 block from my friends place the hair cult. so i tried it my god it is huge it is 4" tall by 20" long and weights about 4 lbs. the mozzalella cheese he make fresh everyday & the prosciutto he makes himself. the monster sandwich cost today $16.50. where is it? m & p biancamano 1116 washington ave hoboken, nj between 11th & 12th. ps you can buy a 1/2 sandwich for about $8.50
2013-06-16,5,Kind of obsessed. Upon hearing that it was my first visit, the owner immediately handed me a giant complimentary piece of fresh mozzarella, which seriously is the best in town. I ordered a sandwich that was literally stuffed to the gills with ingredients. I got a half sub and half of that was more than enough for me to handle. The whole visit was so pleasant and delicious that I absolutely cannot wait to return!
2013-06-11,5,I've always been a fan of Vito's and Fiore's, but had never been here.  All I can say is wow.  Amazing Mutz, and they sure aren't stingy with it on a sandwich!
2013-04-02,5,This is by far the best Italian deli in Hoboken. Sure people will jump to say Fiore's, Vito's', Lisa's or Lucas' because they're popular and most likely don't live in Hoboken and/or haven't tasted M & P's. I have been going here since I moved to 12th street and Hoboken in 2008, being right around the corner. I have moved 3 times since, but always make it a priority to get here at least once a month. Anytime friends come to hang out, help me move or spend the day going out and want to grab a sub, I always make it a point to bring them here. I've lived throughout Hoboken and near the other places, having tried them all multiple times when in a rush or walking home after work yet I always feel that they are subpar to M&P. I always get the C with Balsamic and oil without lettuce or tomatoes b/c the sandwiches are so packed and typically get 2 whole subs, which are $8 each, so I can bring one to work. If you haven't been here, be forewarned, the sandwiches are HUGE! I barely eat a half in one sitting. I was thrilled when Pete (the owner) told me they were open on Sundays this past football season and if I was not going out, would get there before they closed at 1. If you really enjoy an Italian sub and a real Italian deli, you have to try here. You cannot find a better place for the money and the friendliness of the owners.
2013-03-28,5,This place makes the most ridiculously sized sandwich I've ever seen. They load it up with so much meet that I need a different eating strategy than other sandwiches since I literally can't even close the sandwich or fit it into my food hole. It's also the only place where I can't finish the entire sandwich in one sitting and always split it up for two meals.Definitely my top deli choice for cold sandwiches (haven't tried a hot sandwich from here yet so no comment on those) I just wish it was closer to my apartment so I can go more often.
2013-03-13,4,Of all the Italian deli's in Hoboken this one was always my favorite.  Best sandwiches, best mozz, best all around.  I think it is better then Vito's or Fiore's or Lisa's, Fran's and all the others.  Plus the owner is very nice and helpful.  Just don't ask the wife to cut the sandwich is half or otherwise piss her off. I'm not bad mouthing the other deli's as they are 100X better then almost anywhere else.
2013-02-15,4,Oh man, what a great/huge sandwich.  I could only finish half, which is saying a lot considering my appetite.  M&P is one of those hole-in-the-wall places I love.  The interior is old-school Italian Deli with a few chairs and tables for "dining" in.  The people behind the counter seemed really nice and had a great rapport with the other patrons.  All in all, I loved the vibe.  The sandwich definitely lived up to expectations (try the "C" [yes, they are listed by letter]).  It was tremendous.  All of the pictures on Yelp! accurately depict just how massive the heroes are here.  My sandwich was delicious; almost as good if not just as good as my favorite Hoboken Deli Luca Brasi's.  My favorite uptown deli.  I'll be back as often as possible!
2013-02-13,5,Best sandwiches and best mutz in Hoboken. They slice the meat fresh for each sandwich, and a half lasts at least 2 meals. The owners are also very nice, personable and hard working Italianos! Magnifico!
2012-09-26,4,I have been to this place one time and thought it was great.  I had a mozzarella and prosciutto sub that with plenty of meat and mutz.  The mutz in my opinion rivals Fiores in terms of Hoboken deli's.  If you want a ton of meat and cheese on your sandwich this is the place for you.  I would definitely highly recommend at least trying their mutz, it's great.
2012-09-10,5,Possibly the best Eggplant Parm I've ever had! I love this place. Get a sandwich and eat for days!
2012-08-08,5,This place brings the real Italian flavor to Hoboken. My family and I have known Terry & Pete (owners) for years; even having traveled to their hometown in Italy by chance.  They are hard working pleasant people that simply want to serve you amazing Italian food.  I always get the sausage sandwich sans peppers and it's GIGANTIC but hits the spot too well...if you know what I mean.  There's outdoor seating so you can enjoy people watching at its best.  It's very reasonably priced and they even sell some real Italian food staples.  They definitely cater and for an event I had two years ago for my mom's retirement party, we used their services.  Needless to say...the trays were empty before the party ended.  I can't recommend them enough!
2012-07-25,5,Their sandwiches are amazing! For the price they give, it's a steal. Awesome service and without a doubt good variety of sandwiches.
2012-07-12,5,I had to make an account just to review this deli.First off the guy who works there is extremely friendly,I just ordered a ham + fresh mootz with extra mootz...it was 8 bucks for the half..but man let me tell you that sub was just FILLED with equal amounts of ham and juicy cheese...I am still in a bit of shock on how delicious it is plus the quantity I received is just mind blowing!!!I've never eaten a better sub for the price IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.
2012-07-02,5,This deli has the best fresh mozzarella around. The owners are there all the time and they are really nice people. The sandwiches are piled high with meat and cheese and the roasted peppers are great!
2012-06-09,3,This place is good but in a town crowded with Italian Delis I'd have to rank them behind Fiores, Vitos and Luca Brasis.
2012-06-04,5,They load on the meat and mutz like no other.  Order a ham, salami, and mutz with roasted red peppers, and you just might not be able to find the bun underneath.  Or go for a turkey, mutz, roasted red peppers, with lettuce and a little oil and vinegar.  Unreal.  This is a small, old school italian family owned deli that doesn't try to be fancy and doesn't look like much from the outside (or inside, for that matter).  You won't find a ton of gourmet sides or spreads here, just a the necessities for making some of the best sandwiches in town.  The sandwiches don't come standard with lettuce or tomato, so be sure to ask for it if that's what you want.  Basically you have to tell them everything you want on the sandwich.  I also like that you can choose between a hard or soft roll.  Bring a friend....you probably won't be able to eat one sandwich by yourself.They also offer an incredibly affordable catering menu, which I have not tried yet but plan to try soon.
2012-05-30,5,I moved out of the area years ago but till this day, I will make a trip to this deli for the best fresh mutz ever!  Combined with there fresh roast beef and hot peppers, this sandwich is worth having to stay longer at the gym!
2012-05-19,5,My family and I have been coming here for years. Not once have I had food that was mediocre. This deli is the Amazing! Other places try to replicate it, but in my opinion M&P's just surpasses them. If you are in hoboken, hungry or not, you must try this place.  5 Stars *****
2012-05-11,5,The BEST sandwiches in Hoboken, or anywhere for that matter...the freshest mozzerella on the planet & great bread= absolute perfection!!!!!!! Huge sandwiches that cost around $7 and can easily feed two people make this a place you have GOT to try!
2012-04-28,5,Love the place. Huge sandwich and great hot plates. I have never order any thing which  I did not like. Many people orders together from work.
2012-04-27,5,By far the best homemade mozzarella in Hoboken.  The sandwiches are so huge it's impossible to finish them.  The quality is phenomenal!
2012-04-23,5,I may be bowing to the peer pressure here but whatever. I think M&P Biancamano is part of the reason why my brother had such a great time visiting me a few weeks ago. We just did not have delis like this in Denver. The couple who runs this place are so freaking sweet. And you really cannot beat the prices here with a stick. I let my baby brother order and I don't remember what it was called but we split a half sandwich for around $8 and I could only eat half of my half. It pretty much had every Italian meat possible, as well as a pound of Provolone. Everything was really delicious, there was just a crazy amount of it. It was funny to watch him put it all together. It was equally funny watching my brother trying to finish his half of the half-sandwich. It was a good effort. Cash only.
2012-04-09,4,So I had been wanting to try this place for a while in my continuing journey of trying to find the best sandwich in Hoboken. What pushed me over the edge this past weekend to finally make the walk was hearing Artie Lange talk about it on his radio show and how awesome the sandwiches are.  So Friday we took a walk to check it out for lunch.The deli is a cool little place with a wall of Italian dry goods on the left hand side and the deli counter on your left when you walk in.  I think the M&P stands for mom and pop because it's an old Italian couple who are there to service you.  They have a few daily hot specials, on Friday they had shrimp parm and eggplant parm I believe. Both specials seemed to be selling quickly.  I was there for the sandwiches though so I stayed the course.  I ordered two half sandwiches which ended up being way too much food for 2 people.  2 people can easily split a single half and be totally satisfied.  The sandwiches are stuffed with meat and fresh mozzarella and they are well worth the price.  Take note that if you want any toppings such as tomato, lettuce, peppers, etc make sure you ask for them.  Otherwise you sandwich will comes with nothing but meat and cheese.  They also cost a bit extra but the price of a sandwich is still reasonable for how big it is.The sandwiches can get a bit sloppy because they are so big but the rolls hold up well to all the punishment all the meat does when you are trying to eat it.  The meats were sliced fresh while assembling the sandwich and the fresh muzz is cut in huge chunks and tossed on very generously.Bottom line is the sandwiches are very good and filling but so far my favorites sandwiches are still coming from Vito's in Hoboken a few blocks down.
2012-04-03,5,I found this place on Washington when I noticed the firemen and police like to eat here for lunch. Old school Italian. Fresh mozzarella. Sausage and peppers. Meatballs and gravy. The place has been here forever and the sandwiches are to die for. The husband and wife team behind the counter always make you feel welcome. No shortage of sandwich choices: Mortadella, salami, prosciutto, and all the usual suspects. Personal favorite: Turkey Mozzarella on a soft roll with lettuce, tomato and mayo. Warning: These are not small portions.
2012-03-09,4,Was told by a friend that I HAD to try their mozz. Was absolutely amazing. Fiores is overrated and overpriced. !
2012-02-09,5,Top notch sub shop.I usually go with the Prosciutto de Parma and fresh Mozzarella.  Simply Amazing and geat price.
2012-01-18,5,This place is a solid 4.5 stars sandwich but, alas no half stars on Yelp, I'll bump this bad boy up to five stars since the guy behind the counter was just so amazing and that Mutz.  That Mutz could solve wars in the Middle East. Well, that may be an exaggeration but, it is super, duper good. I ordered the chicken cutlet with fresh mutz, roasted and hot peppers.  The half sandwich might I add.  IT WAS HUGE and so delicious.  What I didn't know was that it didn't come with lettuce, tomato or any sauce (i.e. mustard, mayo, oil&vinegar), you must ask for those items. So that was a little sad.  However, it was still amazing and I think it came in at about $7.  I could only eat half.My main squeeze ordered the heart attack on a roll.  It wasn't called that but, that was really what it was.  It seriously was like 4 lbs of various deli meats - roast beef, prosciutto, salami, pepperoni, the list goes all topped with fresh mutz.  With the fact that we were unaware of having to order the lettuce, tomato or any sort of condiment, his sammy was a big ole red block of meat with blocks of fresh mutz and it was extremely overwhelming and intimidating.  So overwhelming was this sandwich, that my bf was completely turned off by this almost life sized submarine.  I will be back M&P armed with the knowledge to order the works on these bad boys.
2012-01-17,5,Italian delis like these are the reason I love Hoboken.Sandwiches with copious amounts of high-quality deli meats and fresh mozz. Old world Italian bread. Pretty sure you can't go wrong with anything here.The "C" was a standout, but be sure to add some hot/sweet roasted peppers to top it off. The owners could not be nicer about special requests.Note: they close at 6 pm during the week, so plan accordingly (even if that requires sneaking out of the office early...)
2012-01-12,5,Sandwiches here are absolutely stacked. One whole is good for three meals even for a large appetite. The husband/wife team behind the counter are very friendly as well.
2011-10-07,5,OMG...I finally got a chance to come here today after hearing nothing but rave reviews, and I can't what I've been missing out on! They couldn't have been nicer, my sandwich was HUGE (I ended up getting the second half wrapped up) and the thick slices of fresh mozz on the sandwich were delish. And what a bargain for such a huge sandwich! A place like this makes me so happy to live in a town with quality Italian delis...although after only one visit, this place is already sitting at the top of my list. Can't wait to go back!
2011-07-18,5,I've been coming to M & P for over 20 years. I probably only stop in a few times a year.......if I hit this place on a regular basis I think the buttons would start popping off my shirts. Their sandwiches are are a handful and most will be stuffed after eating one. They offer soft or crispy bread and your typical Italian deli sandwiches. I'm a big fan of their muzz...very tasty. I usually get prosciutto, salami with muzz on crispy bread.....soo good and soo filling.  They also have hot food specials every day. They have some outdoor seats in the summer and a few tables inside. One of the the great delis that make up Hoboken......M&P, Fiore's and Vito's.....you can't go wrong with any of these places.
2011-04-29,5,Eating here is like Thanksgiving, only better because it comes at least once a week. It's best to fast before and after this meal for at least 2 days. They only serve one size hero - ginormous. If you're the kinda person that likes Subway where the shekel out slices of cheese for you, then this is not your place. Mozz doesn't come in slices, it comes in slabs which are added to the top of the tower of meat they serve you. You shouldn't be driving after this either because your vision starts getting real foggy around bite number 7-8. I've already tried trading in my girlfriend for the Mrs. behind the counter but the Mr. Biancamano is too smart for those rookie tactics.
2011-04-18,5,Home made mutz, best sandwiches in town (besides maybe Fiore's and if you're close by here, you're far away from there.   They take cash only so be prepared.
2011-03-12,5,This spot brought me out of a Yelp hiatus.  As you can see, nobody gives this place a poor rating.  It may get a few 4  stars at worst, which I can't even understand.  Maybe Yelp can suspend those individual's accounts.If there was a Hoboken Kumate tournament, where every single deli in Hoboken was invited to participate in a fight to the death, Biancamano's would play the role of Van Damme.  I've already decided if 2012 is the apocalypse, Biancamano's is on the way to my parents so I'm going to make sure to save the owners of this store en-route to the fam.  I've been to almost every Italian deli in Hoboken now and it just doesn't make sense to say any deli is better than this.  I assume other posters that claim deli x is the best just haven't been here yet.  IT'S THAT GOOD.  I almost don't want to post anything to keep this on the down low as the lines aren't too bad right now.  Noteworthy:- Incredibly fresh everything- Huge portions (Walking Dead status after consuming)- Cheap- Only open until 6- Personal favorites include their italian and meatball mozz sandwiches
2010-08-15,5,Fresh Moz and Roasted Red Peppers from M+P Biancamano is the perfect sandwich.
2010-07-08,5,Best sandwiches ever.  Substantial and sensational without draining your wallet.  Perfect for transporting a block or two to a riverside park for a ready made picnic.
2010-02-19,5,I love the healthy & generous sandwich (any order), which goes well with the Orangina drink!  Huge & not pricey at all.   It's a MUST TRY place!
2009-06-15,4,It's been 9 years since I was last at Biancamano and the sandwiches seem even better than my faded memory, and the space has definitely been spruced up. I got a sopressata with fresh mozzarella and hot chillis, and it was superb. The mozzarella is nearly on par with famed Fiore's and the bread is better, which makes it now my favourite sandwich place in town. A must stop, although I say this with hesitation - I'm worried about spoiling the relaxed atmosphere. One last bonus are the husband and wife proprietors, who make you feel at home.
2009-06-08,5,Been going here for 30 years and the food hasn't changed it's the best. Really can't understand how it hasn't been on food tv ? Before traveling on the plane we have them specially wrap them. Well when we open them on the flight passengers just stare. It's nice to see husband and wife working together and their kids grow. Best Mozz in the U.S.
2009-04-03,5,OMG, OMG, this place is AMAZING!!!!I was visiting Hoboken for a week in February, and was told by many many people I have to get a sandwich here. And boy, oh boy I was NOT dissapointed! The sandwiches are HUGE, and the moz was the best I have EVER had in my LIFE. The bread is soft, and chewy, and crusty all in one. I honestly can't even imagine a better sandwich. I am craving it right now as I write, and I am getting depressed that San Francisco doesnt have a place that can even begin to compare what I had there...This place is a MUST!!!
2008-06-30,4,Biancamano's makes delicious, HUGE sandwiches at their deli.  The fresh mozzarella they make is fantastic, creamy, and smooth, especially when paired with salty slices of prosciutto and some roasted red peppers.  I've been meaning to stock up on some of the (dry) pastas they sell there, but keep forgetting to do it.  They have a decent, but small selection of Italian imported foods in addition to the deli selections.The eggplant parm is also really good!
