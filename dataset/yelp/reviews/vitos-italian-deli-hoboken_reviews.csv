2021-11-08,5,Had a 7 hr layover in New Jersey so I had time to leave the airport to get something to eat. Decided to try Vito's and I was very glad I did. It was busy, but the service was great and the food was even better
2021-10-11,5,Loved the vibe and especially the sandwiches.  I should have looked at more pictures, however, because I feel I really missed out on not ordering my roast beef with mutz with gravy instead of the gravy on the side.  I think the gravy mixed in would have really melted that mozzarella cheese and made the sandwich even more mouth watering!
2021-09-27,4,First and foremost, my Cuban was OUT OF THIS WORLD.Parking is an issue but if you're a local you either know how to get around or live close enough to walk. Not that they need more business but anyone coming in from out of town should be aware that it's worth the wait and you're lucky if you get parking. The place is legitimate. Italian everything. My Italian cousin who critiques every place no matter - she would validate this place.I feel like the man who helped us ...is a lifer. Part of the experience with no offense given. I appreciate it - especially when I'm not too sure about what to order. I don't like feeling rushed but if I could go back I might take more time to order & get some side items. I will say I was a little envious that the little lady got to get a few true deli items from a real deli and take them home to her probable apartment. That doesn't quite exist where I'm from. Thanks Ginger Z's husband for Rec.
2021-09-20,4,Stopped here on our way out of NYC. Had seen the place featured online and on TV and wanted to stop in and get lunch on our way out of the city. This is located on a nice recently updated street with diagonal parking and large sidewalks. The inside of the deli is pretty small and could be overwhelming if you're from out of the area. I would say if possible familiarize yourself with the menu so you don't stand looking at the menu boards. Staff was friendly enough - not overly pushy they could smell we were from out of town. But nice enough. There was so much stuff I wanted to try and buy - they have premise pastas and sauces you can buy which I should have gotten, as well as meatballs and salads, cutlets etc etc. Ended up getting the Smokey hero which has two types of mutz (mozzarella) pesto spread and tomato. This was really good - would've liked to have more spread though. Would come here every time we are in the area and try something new. Also brought some mozzarella back to have this week. Looking forward to that.
2021-08-31,4,The Italian Cuban Hero was more enjoyable than a normal sandwich, but maybe 12% less exciting than an average Cuban sandwich. With impressive components like pork loin and sharp provolone, my anti-fusion vibes disappeared within seconds, but is strange that I think it might have improved with a higher pickle ratio?
2021-08-21,5,Amazing amazing amazing sandwiches and matz. A must go if you're visiting the Hoboken area.
2021-08-20,3,The mozzarella is literally the best in NJ. It's fresh and creamy.Sundered peppers were delicious.Sopressato was very bland and not worth the tripVito hero was ok. The bread was chewey.Place is tiny$ 2 charge for credit card15 cent for bag
2021-08-08,5,I can eat a Vitos Special everyday. Actually, I almost do eat one everyday ‚Äç. Great hero's. The best Mutz. Try to go on off hours or you'll be waiting on line for a while.
2021-08-02,5,Can't go wrong with takeout from this classic Italian deli. In my opinion, they have the best mutz in town- ultra fresh, and they have it in the smoked variety as well! I have tried their chicken cutlet sandwich with fresh mutz, marinated peppers and pesto and it was just so spot on, especially with the perfectly crisp Italian hoagie roll it came on. The Soprano sandwich (same concept except switch out the chicken with some fresh, hand cut Italian meats) also knocked it out of the ballpark for me. EVERYTHING is good here, so come
2021-07-20,5,The Vito's Italian Sandwich with sweets (house made sweet peppers) is phenomenal and has been a top choice for over a decade. Everything on the menu is worth trying. We feel so lucky to have this in our neighborhood!
2021-06-27,5,Literally one of the best subs I've ever had!! The bread is perfect and soft. I had a Turkey, salami, ham and mozzarella sub. Delicious!!
2021-06-07,5,Vito's has a great reputation in Hoboken and it's rightfully deserved. I've been a few times to grab a sandwich here and there and was always impressed. But this last weekend is when they won me as a loyal customer forever! I had a tray of sandwiches catered for a party and everyone raved about how delicious and fresh their subs were. The customer service was excellent as well-- the staff in the store took their time with me to pick out the best subs and arrangement that would work for me and not only was my delivery on time but a few minutes early!!!! It's the little things like this that go a long way. I cannot recommend Vito's enough! Thank you Vito's team!!!
2021-05-31,5,Vito's fresh mutz is my favorite vegetarian sandwich in the world. The mutz is so flavorable and the balance of the pesto and roasted peppers masterful. Sorry to say I love it so that I haven't ventured to try the rest.  By the authentic look of it though I would think all their standards are worth a detour.
2021-05-22,1,Decent food but awful service and staff. I called ahead so that I could pick up my sandwich in 10 minutes or so. Seems reasonable to me but Vitos kept telling me I had to wait 30 minutes if ordering by phone but that it would only be 5 minutes if I order in person. Furthermore, they said nobody was in-person waiting so it would be extra fast. That might seem logical if you are a small child but to any adult, I think they see will see the massive flaw in that reasoning. The woman on the phone proceeded to get very rude and nasty. There is no reason to treat customers like this, especially when there are Italian deli's every two blocks in Hoboken and Vitos isn't even the best one. I ended up getting a delicious, less expensive sandwich from Lisa's, where the people were incrediably kind and made it for me in 10 minutes after I called ahead. See Vito's? Its not hard and you are losing customers because you don't treat them well. Encourage your staff to treat customers like people and accomodate their requests, and please get rid of this policy of taking 30 minutes to prep orders on the phone. Side note: Vito's is always closed for half the week. Along with the way they treat customers, do these guys just not need money? Screams "front for italian mob"  to me
2021-05-09,4,Can't pass up the trip to Vito's when we are in the area. There has been a huge completion for years in Hoboken between the Italian deli's. When you walk into Vito's they have a lot of imported Italian items as well as homemade. We normally come for the fresh mutz but have had a sandwich there before. A lot of people come for the sandwich's and I notice the famous roast beef is a crowd favorite too. When I go in there a lot of customers are ordering it. The fresh mutz is very good, well salted and a good texture. Way to go Vito's!
2021-04-29,5,The review literally no one asked for:Constantly looking for additional Italian delis because I've become too dependent on Fiore's.So here it is. Apples to apples.1. Roast beef- (Fiore's) has more flavor2. Mozz- (Vito's) softer / feels fresher although no smoked mozz option.3. Delivery- (Vito's)4. Accepts cards- (Vito's)5. Availability- (Vito's) not just Thursdays / Saturdays for roast beef.6. Brown gravy is where I think it splits. Vito's is thicker, like a velvety brown gravy. Really hides the fact that the roast beef is essentially flavorless. But Fiore's is a loose like au ju with chunks of meat and TONS of garlic. Neither sauce would go well on the others sandwich, IMO. So this really determines my mood on who to order from. **pro tip: I suggest to get either with the gravy on the side.7. Roasted red peppers- (Fiore's) since they're house made and full of garlic not just popped out of a jar.8. Bread- Fiore's has more choices either a hero or Keizer, but Vito's has softer heros and they aren't as thin.So Vito's wins for mozz, which is hard for my to admit but the facts are the facts. They also have convenience on their side if you don't have cash or need delivery. The food always arrive hot (am I'm in Weehawken) portions are great. It's less messy overall -if that matters to someone. Happy to have been able to order from here a few times and see it's consistency. They have cold cuts and regular sandwiches but let's be real, who cares about those??
2021-04-28,5,Got Vito's for the first time this weekend. How have I not been here sooner?!Got the Vito's Hero and the Chicken Sorrentino. Both were delicious! Vito's Hero is definitely going to be a re order. We also grabbed the Buffalo chicken pasta. That was phenomenal. Don't pass that up!
2021-04-25,5,My favorite Deli store in Hoboken!Have to say I like their roasted beef mutz with gravy hero more than Fiore's, and they have it available any day! Really good selection of subs and the service is really friendly and efficient. They also got a nice freezer with tons of homemade ready-to-cook dishes.Cannot wait to come back and try more things on the menu!
2021-04-16,5,I stumbled across Vito's on Yelp looking for a source of authentic antipasto makings to ship to Utah as a birthday surprise for my new & Italian son-in-law.  I saw gift baskets offered by other establishments but they looked too packaged & offered little for my vegan daughter.  I called this place & after talking to Danny, I found what I was looking for.  He was so, so helpful.  While they deliver locally, they don't ship.  But Danny guided me through the process of arranging it through UPS myself.  The Italian, veggie & cookie/cannoli platters arrived today.  My son-in-law said it was the best mozzarella & cannolis he ever had.  The cannolis weren't too sweet, for example.  My daughter raved about the artichoke hearts & about the veggies being on a bed of marinated arugula.  How they managed to nail the presentation of items that had to be boxed for shipping is beyond me.  Everything was beautifully contained.  The pepperoni was shaped like a rose!  Sure, the shipping was expensive but UPS delivered it in a refrigerated truck.  Extraordinary personal service & delicious food.  Thank you, Danny, for making this a special experience for my family.
2021-04-09,5,I never thought I'd write a review about a salad but here goes. Stumbled upon this restaurant by pure luck through Grubhub. I'm on a diet, so I wanted to order a salad. Absolutely delicious! I ordered the Vito's house salad. It comes with mutz, roasted peppers, sundried tomatoes and onion. Fresh and plentiful. Salad is one size and is enough for two. I on the other hand, devoured the entire thing. Honestly, some of the best mutz, sundried tomato's and roasted peppers I've ever tasted. I asked for croutons and even they were great. Pretty sure there homemade. Well done! The "sangwhiches" look ridiculous too and I 100% will be trying in the immediate future. The hell with a diet.
2021-03-06,4,Obsessed with this place. Time after time it is just delicioso. My only complaint is it can get a lil stressful in the small space at busy times (could add to their charm though?) and also sometimes I observe and am not sure how hygienic it is behind the counter.  There is definitely a reason it remains a Hoboken staple though.
2021-01-22,5,Breaded chicken cutlet with red peppers, mutz, and balsamic from Vito's...  My favorite sandwich I have ever had (yes I said it...).  Amazing spot with great selection.  Pasta is unbelievable and plenty of variety of sauce and necessities for your next Sunday dinner.  Best Italian deli in Hoboken!
2021-01-19,3,I have to admit I was a little disappointed with the chicken parm hero. There was plenty of chicken and mozzarella cheese but the chicken didn't seem like it was super fresh and the cutlets were thick, which made it hard to eat. I have never tried any of the other sandwiches, so maybe I'll give them a try and have a better experience next time .
2020-12-30,5,Just the best deli in Hoboken and it ain't even close.  Happy hour special is the best deal I've ever come across .  Best mozz in town!
2020-11-21,5,Just amazing... i dont even really like sandwiches but i still LOVED it. My favourite is eggplant parm since im not huge on meat but my bf loved the chicken cutlet
2020-11-17,1,I ordered a sandwich and tea and took me forever to get it. There weren't any customers in line. After a long time of waiting they asked me who's order I was waiting for, and I said my name that's the only time I saw them make my order! Poor customer service, and overpriced. I wasn't even satisfied with my food.
2020-10-22,4,*Catering review*I recently ordered two platters for catering and had a great experience! Vito's uses a site called EZCater, which is basically like a Seamless but for catering. The process was very easy. I picked what I wanted, chose a pick-up time (you can also opt for delivery), and paid ahead of time. When I got to Vito's, my order was ready and waiting.I ordered a platter of penne vodka and chicken parm, each serving 8-10 people. The penne was a bit weird because they had different sized penne mixed together, but still delicious nonetheless. Chicken parm wasn't the best chicken parm I've had but it was still pretty good. They didn't skimp on the mutz, which I LOVED! They also give you some bread to go with the food, and by some I mean at least an entire loaf, already cut up for your convenience.Overall, it was a great experience. Prices are very reasonable. In fact, they were $15-$20 cheaper than other comparable places in Hoboken.
2020-10-11,5,Love this place!!!!!! This will be my go to spot whenever I'm in the mood for Mozz and forget about the Swedish meatballs. Off the chain.
2020-09-22,1,I just paid $17.00 for a stale prosciutto Parma  sandwich and ice tea.....I know that everyone is hurting do to Covid-19....not fair to take advantage of your customer's.
2020-08-27,5,To be honest this review could easily come down to one word "WOW." Amidst all the deli options in Hoboken, hands down they're the best. First and foremost I don't care what anyone says they have the best MUTZ (Mozzarella) in Hoboken...sorry Fiore this is not intended to downplay other good businesses, but these guys are the real deal.I work for Citibank and we had an event for my employees where I decided to work with the best deli in town and I have always got catering from them for my teams Christmas parties. The owner and his son are awesome and I asked them if they could do a sandwich in the shape of my business name, "Citi." They said they would make it happen for me. My employees, my boss and people from other branches even came to my office to visit because they heard we got food from Vito's.I was a business banker before being a branch manager and let me tell you this place is ran very well and produce such good quality. Their pasta salad was delicious, every sandwich we tasted was so fresh and you could tell they make their food with such care. I could go on and on, but I want to thank Vito and his son Danny for being professional and making food that makes you feel good. If you're in Hoboken check it out.
2020-08-20,1,I used to love this place, but they have been beyond lax with safety measures during COVID.  Not only is the staff not wearing masks properly, but they also allow customers in the place without wearing a mask at all.  Very disappointing, but I'm done with this place now.  There's other good delis in Hoboken.
2020-07-18,5,Can't go wrong here.Authentic Italian EatsWalk in - wait in line - and get the vibe.After picking your sandwich, pluck a side or two.You'll be enjoying for days.
2020-07-05,5,I have ordered specialty sandwiches from Vito's and they never disappoint. BUT yesterday I used Vito's Catering service for a close family 4th of July celebration. OMG - everything was outstanding. We had baked ziti, Vito's specialty salad, and chicken fingers. I'm addition to great food Vito's followed our requests for salad dressing on the side, extra tomato sauce on the side and BREAD! They even provided plastic serving tongs. My family was delighted with the quality of the food and I couldn't have been happier. Thanks Vito's for all the special attention - and wonderful delivery service! Please keep up the good work
2020-06-26,5,I'm from New England and we know Italian too, and this my friends is the real deal. Best Grinder I've had in all of Hoboken. Brought all our visitors here too! We have only been here a few months and got it way too many times already. So good!
2020-06-17,5,Was beyond thrilled to find out they deliver to Weehawken.  Got the Vito Hero (pictured) which was the best cold hero I had in the last year easily.  The fresh mutz is what makes it.  Still thinking about it.Also got roast beef and fresh mutz (not pictured), saving for another lunch.  The nice lady on the phone recommended the hot roast beef so eager to try next time.All in all, with tip, out of neighborhood delivery (which imo is a better deal then takin light rail or Lyft), total was ~$34.  Will definitely want to order again.  Might have to become a regular occurrence...
2020-06-16,5,Great sandwich with fresh mutz. Be sure to check out their Happy Hero Hour deal for $5.50!
2020-04-26,5,"The Vito" is the pinnacle of sandwich making and you absolutely need to try this if it's your first time to Vitos. The real secret is the mix of hot and sweet banana peppers, but you'll need to request it. The hot roast beef and mutz with gravy is also outstanding, but that's stepping on Fiore's toes.There is usually a 15 minute wait on weekends but it's well worth it. When you go in, be sure to check out all of the cool memorabilia around the place.
2020-03-14,5,A great sandwich spot! They have so many menu options in the store. The mozzarella is fresh and the service is quick! Whenever I get these sandwiches I can't wait to go back again and try something else because each sandwich is better than the next!
2020-01-24,5,Place is legit . Chicken cutlet/ prosciutto w fresh mozz and roasted Pepps is the go to .
2020-01-23,5,The best Italian deli in Hoboken!! You literally can't go wrong with anyone in this place. The sandwiches are to die for. The service is great and they have more options of drinks to choose from then you can even comprehend. This is a true old school NJ Italian deli and it's the best in this area.
2020-01-09,5,I haven't been inside, I've only ordered on Uber Eats, but the sandwiches are great and the Caesar Salad is the bets I've had in Hoboken. They're also on Uber Eats so it's one of my favorite places to get delivery from.
2019-12-26,4,Vito's is my go-to deli in Hoboken. I've been here countless times, and they provide a consistent and high-quality sandwich every time. They accommodate both of my favorite "make your own" sandwiches. Chicken cutlet, Mutz, LTM is one, and Turkey, Salami, Mutz, LTM is the other. The sandwiches are slightly smaller than some other delis, but again, the quality is always top notch. Knocking a star off because I personally think this deli lacks some pre-made sides. I'm a fan of a rice ball or some macaroni salad, pesto Mutz, tomato salad, etc. in addition to my sandwich. My hometown deli always had so many fresh sides to choose from in their showcase - I wish they would increase their offerings a bit. Again, Vito's is delicious and high quality, so I do recommend!
2019-12-19,5,I've been looking for a good sandwich delivery place (living in jersey city heights), and this is my knew GO TO. Soooooo so good. Great quality meats, mutz and bread. I ordered on Uber Eats. Delivery was quick and I had a very satisfying lunch.
2019-12-17,5,One of the best, if not the best, Italian heros I've had in my life.  The fresh Mozzarella is amazing.  Hot Roast beef and Muzz is unreal.   Great great deli.
2019-12-07,4,Sandwiches never disappoint! From catering orders to single subs, I always leave happy and waiting for the next opportunity to come back. Staff is very friendly and helpful for catering orders, and while it may take a bit when lines are long for sub orders, I still recommend Vito's to anyone looking for a delicious, hearty sub. Love just about any prosciutto or breaded chicken sandwich, also love the olive tapenade. Delicious!
2019-10-27,4,I work in Hoboken and decided to get some Italian hero's for dinner at my moms. Very delicious!
2019-10-26,5,My husband and I love to look for the best Italian deli. We have tried several places and they have been amazing, we have ordered fresh mozzarella in different deli's in the area ,  we never thought we would find another place we would like more, this is definitely the best mozzarella in Jersey. And hats off to their mozzarella and roast beef sandwich. Trust me when I say it's the best in town, I have compared with all the acclaimed one in Jersey. We will be back here.
2019-10-25,5,My first Vito's experience was an important one - it NEEDED to be great, and it WAS!  I was moving in and used the online order option to get lunch for the movers (the fate of my STUFF hindering on deli-ciousness) and fortunately it was a HIT! A few chicken hero's, the Italian Cuban hot hero and chicken salad were all home-runs to the hungry crew. The orders were fast, correct and most importantly - crazy good. These hero's made me the hero!
2019-10-25,5,I go to school near here and I've never tried this place but after one of my friends telling me they had $5.50 specials from Tuesday to Thursday (2-6 pm) I went right after class. I got the prosciutto mutz (basic hero) and it is soooo worth your money.  The portion sizes are big and they don't skim out on meat. All the ingredients were super fresh and the mozzarella in my sandwich was delicious. It was super soft and went very well with the sandwich. I also got the balsamic glaze and it made everything taste even better!!There's not alot of seating. There's two tables on the outside of the business but that is it. Also they take card but there will be a small fee if you decide to use credit card (no fee for debit or cash)
2019-10-12,5,BEST FRESH MUTZ EVER!!! The fresh mozzarella is the best I've ever had. They have delicious sandwiches and sides also. We tried the Swedish meatballs which are incredible and moist with a delicious thick sauce. We tried the porcini mushroom penne today, it's delicious and creamy. We tried the lobster and crab cakes today. There was a shell in one and they were a little on the dry side so wouldn't get them again. Most everything from here is delicious! And they sell imported grocery from Italy. My favorite is the glass jars of Nutella ( no hydrogenated oils! ). Stop in and try their mutz!!! You won't find better. Prepare to spoil your taste buds! :) We usually buy a pound at a time in the water. Today we got 1/2lb. Always fast friendly service!
2019-10-04,5,I didn't know I could be in love with a deli but here we are.I got the hoboken and my mom got the chicken sorrentino panini with grilled chicken and we both loved our sandiwches! The artichokes in my Hoboken sandwich were so delicious and so was everything else - the pesto, eggplant, mozz, red peppers, and olive tapenade spread I added.I can't wait to go back and bring home some eggplant parm they had selling in the refrigerator. They also have some groceries like fresh and dry pasta, cookies, crackers, and spreads. 5/5, the perfect deli (though seating would also be great!).
2019-09-21,5,Flawless Classic New Jersey Deli. You can travel all over the world but you will never find anything like a Italian deli. But if you are in Hoboken you have to give this place a shot
2019-09-02,4,This place automatically gets a good review from me because it's open on Sundays, when most other Italian delis in the Jersey City/Hoboken area are closed. I came here the Sunday of Labor Day weekend to buy some last-minute ingredients for a pizza and the guy helping me let me sample some pepperoni and delicious, spicy sopressata. Vito's also has a pretty wide selection of meats, tomatos, cheeses, pastas -- you name it.The place itself is kind of small so I'm sure it can get pretty crowded, but don't let that deter you -- the quality of the ingredients and the friendly service here are top-notch. I will definitely come back for any ingredients I might need and for sandwiches, which I have heard so much about.
2019-09-01,5,A lot of places claim to be authentic, but Vito's is the real deal. The mutz (mozzarella) is fresh. The meat is juicy and delicious. The sandwich is twice as big for the same price as it would be in Manhattan. There is not much room to sit and eat within the building physically, but that is what the waterfront is for.I will be back next time I go to Hoboken.
2019-06-09,5,This is the best Italian deli in Hoboken, and my favorite that I've ever been to. Freshest ingredients - the Parma prosciutto and mutz sandwich is absolutely to die for. All their food, from the sandwiches to the homemade pasta and frozen dinners, have been 5 star quality. Definitely recommend going to this spot if you're in Hoboken
2019-06-03,4,Vito's is my default sandwich shop in hoboken. I've eaten there many times for lunch, used them for catering, and larger group orders. Have never been disappointed. What I like best about Vito's is the quality of ingredients. Everything is top notch, which really makes for some flavorful food. Second, they offer a true variety of stuff to order. Tons of different sandwiches and lots of different hot foods and salads too. There's definitely a reason there's always a line on Saturday's.
2019-06-02,5,The best Italian sandwiches in Hoboken. That's saying a lot with steep competition in this town. The classic Vito's sandwich is always solid, but anything featuring their house made mozzarella is a winner.Besides the sandwiches, they also sell great premade meals  - things like chicken parm, lasagna, baked ziti - that come in super handy on lazy dinner nights.The guys working the place are always super friendly and warm. I always leave happier than when I arrived.
2019-06-01,5,Okay so it goes without saying that Hoboken has a strong deli game. They all bring something to the (deli) counter for sure, but if you want that little extra magic, Vito's is your spot. The subs are fantastic (and have fun names), their hot and cold salads and pastas are mouthwatering you can't not get at least two to go with your sandwich order. And most of all, the entire Vito's crew treats everyone like family, they're so genuine, kind, and the passion they have for what they do comes through every single time. If you want Hoboken's finest, you pay Vito's a visit, don't settle for anything less.
2019-05-28,3,Vito's is second best of course next to fiore's. But the best part is that Vito's delivers and Fiore's does not as far as I know.Vito's is better than all other sandwich places in Hoboken.  The cheese might be better uptown on Washington,  but the sandwich over all at Vito's is better.Thanks
2019-05-20,5,Great sandwiches you definitely have to get the fresh mozzarella on everything. Staff is very friendly and helpful when you arrive their takeout order or prepared as soon as you put in your order
2019-05-19,3,Had two sandwiches, the Soprano and an Italian tuna - both had very good fillings but bread was disappointingly doughy, and actually distracted from the quality of other ingredients.   I might be willing to give Vito another try but doubt I will given the many other options nearby.
2019-05-09,5,Honestly, the Vito's sandwich is the best Italian hero my husband and I have ever had. After moving to the area from Brooklyn, we both really missed access to really good / reliable old school Italian sandwich shops. Vito's has satisfied that craving, and far exceeded our expectations. Recommend you get it with the sweet peppers, flavor explosion!
2019-05-04,5,Fugetaboutit Pal...  Remember those old school places your Mom and Dad took you to when you were a kid?  Well this is that place.  Old school, authentic Italian charm while keeping pace with modern food expectations.Fast, friendly and deeeee-lish.
2019-04-19,5,Loved this place! Came on a Saturday around 11am and not too crowded...I'm sure we beat the rush! We were getting 2 sandwiches for an early lunch. We also got these Italian bread rings that we love with chili pepper and a few frozen raviolis for a fresh pesto the next day. Only one of the raviolis was actually made my Vito's (goat cheese) and the meat ones were made by another brand. For the sandwiches we did the soprano and then a prosciutto mozz and red pepper. They accidentally put the red pepper on the soprano instead of the spicy peppers. Honest mistake and both were still amazing so we didn't care! Sandwiches are a normal size and manageable compared to some other delis in the area. Mozzarella was to die for. Absolutely coming back!
2019-04-13,4,One of the best deli's around! Can be a little hectic when you walk in as the place might be a little crowded. There's a lot to choose from as they sell all kinds of stuff, cheeses, meats, homemade prepared food (frozen and non frozen), drinks and of course subs. I tried the Sinatra and they put a lot of meat and mozzarella on their subs, trust me there is no need to ask for extra. Their mozzarella or mutz as they call it here is freshly made and believe will go on almost every single sub they sell. I also had them put their homemade olive spread On my sub and that just added that little extra flavor to it. Only thing that could be improved to my taste was their bread, wish it was just little bit crunchier. They have a happy hour 2pm-6pm from Tuesday to Thursday so will definitely come back to try some more as they sell certain subs for 5.50$ during those times. Would give 4.5 stars
2019-04-13,5,If you haven't been to Vito's Deli, Hoboken - run, walk, crawl - whatever you need to do it just get there!! In addition to their far from 'basic' heroes they also have a variety of 'specialty' ones. Also many choices of deli selections, spreads and Italian specialty goods. Delicacies of homemade marinara sauce, chicken Parm and many other greats!! The fresh 'mutz' is bombbbbbb. Yummmmm
2019-04-11,4,Love this place. You don't get more authentic Italian deli than this joint. Really great sandwiches. Filling and piled high. Great items in the deli case and a small section of Italian groceries too. This place has interesting hours so you have to double check when they are open but it's a great spot for lunch. I come in for a chicken cutlet sandwich on most occasions. My wife love's their panini's. It's also a great spot to get some Ricotta Salata (which is easily on my Top 5 favorite cheeses list.) Service is decent. You have to be quick. There's usually a line or two and they move fast. If you're too slow, they could pass you by. However the food is always prepared with care and you're bound to find something that'll keep you coming back for more and more.
2019-04-10,5,AWESOME deli.It is on the pricey side but I love it. There deli sandwiches are great but the breakfast was just as good. I also had the buffalo chicken pasta salad which was fire AND the traditional stuffed rigatoni salad, even better!  Delivery is a while so if you can just go pick it up
2019-03-30,4,Very classic Italian deli with all the usuals that you'd expect. I asked for a chicken caprese, wasn't on the menu but they offered right away to make it. Mutz, chicken, pesto and tomatoes, all pressed. Great sandwich and great customer service, very pleased. Only negative is long wait time for one sandwich when I got there, I was the only one
2019-03-27,5,Number one deli sandwich in Hoboken. Fresh mozzarella is amazing! Sandwiches are large portions with a generous amount of deli meat. Nice selection of dinners (shells, chicken parm, eggplant etc) for quick family meals.
2019-03-02,5,Time to update my review! I withdraw my previous review and happy to report that I have not gotten sick since the ONE incident 3 years ago. This is my go to sandwich place which I normally order chicken cutlet with mutz, prosciutto with mutz, and any sandwich with mutz. Always be on the look out for their daily counter special - buffalo chicken pasta salad and burrata are my favorites but not offered daily.
2019-01-17,4,Came right before they closed on a Sunday and there was a little line. That is always a good sign and although I normally dont do lines I was starving so I waited. This is your classic nj deli with all the fixings. The buffalo chicken pasta salad on the counter looked awesome so I definitely wanted some of that.  The guy I ordered from even gave me a bigger container than what I ordered because they were closing and were probably going to waste it. It was a great gesture and I appreciated it. For sandwiches I got the roast beef with mutz and hot gravy. It is good but not in the same ballpark as Fiores. I also tried the smoked mozz sandwich.  It has both smoked and fresh mozz on it with some pesto. I didnt particularly care for the smoked mozz it has a weird flavor that didnt play well with the other ingredients. In the end, Vito's hit the spot with both the food and the service. I will definitely be back and I recommend it to anyone.
2018-12-10,5,Oh my goodness, what a place!   I saw this place on a TV show and I have been waiting to go there for about four or five years, and I finally was in the area and got over there!   And let me tell you, it was WELL worth the wait!   The strangest thing in Hoboken is the parking.  All of the slot seem to be backwards, encouraging people to back in.  That's fine and good, when you don't have a bunch of people behind you and seemed to be in a hurry with all of the tailgaiting (that's all over Jersey though).  But once I got parked, I went in to the Deli, and the smells were unbelievable.  It's a VERY small place and I didn't notice any place to eat outside (it was too cold anyway), but there's definitely no tables inside.  But I was taking the sandwich back to Connecticut with me anyway.  I got "The Smokey", which is Smoked Mutz (Mozzarella), Pesto, and Tomatoes on a fresh Italian Hoagie Roll.  I had it hours later, but it was still one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten.  I kick myself for not buying like five of them and bringing them back to Las Vegas to freeze and eat later.  I could go for one right now!  But honestly, everything they had looked good.  The entire Deli case behind the counter where they take your order, was truly the most epic deli case I've ever seen.  And the fact that one of the workers was wearing a Mets hat, instead of a Yankees hat, was enough to give them five stars (just joking of course).  I plan on being in Jersey again next October, and this will be one of my first (and last stops) on the trip, and I will be getting extra sandwiches.  If you're in that area, get over to this place.  I promise you, it is WORTH IT!
2018-11-24,4,I would give Vito's a 5 for the quality of food but I would give it a 2 because there is no seating and that one point constantly bothers me. On the quality of food - they do everything well and the mutz every year is ranked #1 In Hoboken which says something because this is a city that prides itself on Italian heritage.
2018-11-09,5,Great deli and amazing food. Intimidating line but it goes pretty quick. Friendly staff go there about 1-2 times a week.
2018-10-21,5,FIVE STARS for the event they catered for us!!! Mozzarella , salad, chicken franchise, cannoli, shrimp,pasta, all awesome.  We hosted 15 people and they brought everything in a very organized manner!  George and Hope were great helps with the menu!
2018-10-03,5,Our firm just catered food from Vito's and it was amazing. The food was right on time, hot and delicious! They were even kind enough to include a utensils for serving and a whole bottle of dressing for the salad. Everyone loved it and got seconds and thirds! Thank you Vito's, we will be ordering from you again!
2018-10-02,4,A solid spot for post activity of any sort in the Hoboken area. They have a small seating area right outside the deli (2 couches & two chairs, and a coffee table). I got the Vito sandwich and the mutz was fresh and plentiful. Although the sandwiches here are a bit pricey, they do not lack in sustenance and will have you stuffed for a long time. They have a weekday happy hour special, which is all original sandwiches for $5.50 from the hours of 2pm - 6pm ($6.95 with a 20oz drink) - now that's a deal!
2018-09-20,5,I bought pasta here tonight.  Really good.All of their food is authentically Italian.The only problem is that it's really expensive.  They also close extremely early.But great place to go for Italian groceries and food.
2018-09-02,4,This is one of the two spots I absolutely must visit when I go to Hoboken. It's one of those iconic places that would be a shame to pass up. They make the most excellent turkey and mutz sandwiches. The bread is firm on the outside and soft on the inside. The mutz is so fresh and flavorful. With the bread, turkey, mutz, tomato, lettuce, onion and oil/vinegar... you leave a very satisfied customer. They added couches outside so you can enjoy your sandwich (since there's no seating and limited space on the inside). The prices are high for a sandwich ($10) but so glad to treat myself with this. DEFINITELY will come back!
2018-08-20,5,Great neighborhood deli. Like the ambiance. Got Vito and Parma Prosciutto sandwiches, and they're very good. Saw somebody ordered eggplants platter and it looks super delicious. Will definitely come back!!!
2018-08-18,4,Their sandwich is huge..... I got salami + mutz sandwich for breakfast, and ended up eating it whole day.... They gave good amount of food, but that's just too greasy to me... and the cheese was not as good as expected.I will come back and try other stuff next time.
2018-07-30,5,Literally amazing sandwiches! And their weekday $5 sub deals is great. :) I love coming here because they are also always sooo nice and friendly!!
2018-07-27,2,I've lived a few doors away for a couple years now. Smells great inside and of course I've had a few sandwiches. One was great, was one dry and the other was made incorrectly. A few minutes ago I called for a simple pickup of a sandwich. 45 minute wait for a pick-up, OR can come as a walk in stand and wait the whole time. This makes absolutely zero sense. The last two times I was there I had to wait just to have the young counter person get off their cell phones behind the counter. I obviously have issues with food place. I'm sure the foods good and Yelp says I live 256 feet away, I'm sure I do. What a shame.
2018-06-03,4,There are plenty of good sandwich shops in NYC, but Vito's in Hoboken is no joke. I suggested grabbing some sandwiches here as I met up with some folks in Hoboken prior to departing down to Ocean City, MD. Having heard the buzz about this place (and no, I haven't been to Fiore's yet, but it's on the list). Nonetheless, yes, do as you are told and whatever you get (which seemingly can't be bad), make sure your sammich includes the mozzarella. While, generally, I die a little inside when I hear it referred to as 'the muzz', Vito's mozzarella is delight. I had it with grilled chicken, peppers, broccoli rabe, with balsamic glaze and mustard. Goddamn delicious. Vito's is a no frills italian deli that's putting out some great muzz and bangin sanguichs.
2018-05-15,5,Vito's....Whoah oh oh oh.  Best deli in Hoboken/Jersey city by far.  The tuna fish is so good i over order and take the rest home because one of my daughters loves it so much. Great bread, awesome broccoli rabe, a delicious italian hero [although i build my own from scratch rather then order off the menu: ham, salami, coppa, provolone, LTO, O&V, oregano & pepper and smothered in hot peppers (they use the banana kind)], and solid salads.  The thing i love about it is its CONSISTENCY.  Out of the fifty+ times we've ordered from our office, we've had one bad meal.  That happened to be today.  So i called to tell them about it just as a courtesy, not asking for anything, just to let them know it was a little "off" today.  And this is why i love the place so much.  The manager or owner called back 15 minutes later completely distraught wanting to know exactly what was wrong.  He wasn't angry, he generally cared about his product.  Vito's is part of the old school, and they put that love into the food they make every day.  So order something from Vito's and order ONE MORE FOR THE ROOOOOOOAAAADDD.
2018-04-03,4,Absolutely phenomenal Italian sandwiches.  If I were alive in the early 20th century then I imagine this is what I would have eaten for lunch.  Classic deli sandwiches made with quality ingredients.  It's so authentic that they don't have any indoor seating.  Would be nice to if they had at least one table or something but this is still one of the best options in this part of town for lunch.
2018-03-23,2,Unfortunately I'm giving this rating for their food. I ordered a chicken wrap with bacon and hot sauce and mayo- not only was the chicken cold but it felt they dumped half a jug of buffallo sauce. barely could eat without my mouth being on fire and barely any mayo.... plus charged nearly $12 for a wrap that in Manhattan costs 9+tax. .. so for food it's a 1 star but very nice atmosphere and the customer service is great. very pleasant people. but here only judging for their food not personality.
2018-03-13,5,Excellent Italian Cuban, bad thing I forgot to take a picture because it was sooo delicious, thanks Vito's
2018-02-26,5,The best overall option of sandwiches around. The food is can't miss and if anybody is visiting they need to check it out. You cannot go wrong with any choice.
2018-02-17,4,Wow  Stopped in to grab a sandwich during their happy hour (2-6pm during the weeks), which discounts most of their basic sandwiches to $5.95. I grabbed the turkey mutz sandwich  which was HUGE, filled with mozzarella chunks and some hot sauce. Turkey was fresh, mozzarella had great texture and taste, and the bread was fresh and crunchy, as expected from an Italian deli.I also picked up a box of Italian chocolate cookies for $6-7, and with limited shame devoured them in like 2 days. I'd do it again...All in all, would stop by again if in midtown Hoboken.PS: they charge a 3% surplus for credit cards, so have a debit card or cash on hand.
2018-02-11,2,I'm not really sure why this places has such high reviews. Went there on a Sunday afternoon to pick up two sandwiches and ended up getting an pepperoni and provolone sandwich and a turkey and mozzarella of course had to add the topping lettuce tomatoes etc. Also ended up getting 2 Italian balls I forgot the correct name. The place was way over priced about 30 dollars or so for average sandwiches and alright balls on top of waiting for like a half hour. Idk why I decided I was gonna stay a wait but I was disappointed I will not be returning with so many mouth watering deli's with better sandwiches around. No point of over paying and waiting for something not worth the time and money.

It's also one of the top 5 in Hoboken. That sounds weird, but it's a testament to how good the delis are here. Vito's is one of my faves, and makes a truly delicious, tasty sandwich.The guys that work here are real Italian Jersey guys. They're also really cool. The sandwiches are just off-the-charts spectacular. You cannot get better than a Vito's sandwich. There may be others in town that are just as good because this is the town of delis as I said. And this may be a little pricey. But Vito's is just perfect. I am absolutely in love with the sandwich and you will be too - once you try it.Another really great thing about Vito's is that they will put all kinds of delicious veggies and dressing on your sandwich which some other delis don't do. The fresh mozzarella as amazing as you would expect in Hoboken. You simply must try Vito's.And hey, I just met youAnd this is crazyBut here's my number (it's a Jersey number)So Corleone me maybe?So let me tell you, there's a secret. The best Italian delis in the world are not in New York City. They are not in your hometown of whateversville, Missouri. They are not in Italy or France (although there's some damn good sh** over there). Forget Long Island. Sorry Chicago. Nope. The best Italian delis in the world are in Hoboken and Jersey City. Yes, it's true. Don't ask me why, they just are.There are 5 spots in Ho-broken, all vying for the title of the world's best Italian Deli, I can't decide which of the 5 is best, and people I've taken to them have differing opinions. Although one thing we all agree on is: if the other 4 didn't exist, then the one remaining would be the best in the world. That's how good these 5 are.Fran's, Andrea Salumeria, M & P Biancamano, Vito's, and Fiore. I've been going between the 5 as my fave for the longest time, but if I had a gun to my head and I had to pick one: I'd pick all 5. And so should you.The selling point of all 5 (and all good delis in this area) is that they have Fresh Mozzarella. I mean fresh, fresh. It's literally fresh, like, still gooey, warm, squidy, just made, and absolute heaven. Their imported meats are the best of the best. Their breads and seasonings, incomparable. You can't get any better than these sandwiches. Come and try for yourself. They have ruined all Italian delis everywhere for me, forever. For a traditional Italian sandwich, nothing will ever compare to Hoboken.So Vitout further ado, let me sign off this review with Peter Gabriel's hit song about Vito's.original song (one of the most important songs ever)youtube.com/watch?v=luVp...original lyricsazlyrics.com/lyrics/pete...September '17Hoboken weather fineIt was lunchtime as usualIn area code 201Oh Vito's, Vito's, because Vito'sOh Vito's, Vito's, because Vito'sMutzarella, MutzarellaThe sandwich is deadThe sandwich is deadWhen I try to sleep at nightI can only dream of breadThe outside world is all Mutz whiteWith roasted red pepper redOh Vito's, Vito's, because Vito'sOh Vito's, Vito's, because Vito'sMutzarella, MutzarellaThe sandwich is deadThe sandwich is deadYou can gobble down a half subBut you can't eat an entireOnce the mutz begins to digestThe appetite will expireOh Vito's, Vito's, because Vito'sOh Vito's, Vito's, because Vito'sMutzarella, MutzarellaThe sandwich is deadThe sandwich is deadAnd the eyes of Yelp are watching nowAnd the mouths of Yelp are salivating now
2017-12-13,5,I've been to a lot of Italian delis in north jersey and Vito's is by far one of the best. Their Mozz is hands down the absolute best. We get a full sub on Saturday mornings - half in the morning and the other half for dinner!
2017-12-03,4,Went to vitos-italian-deli-hoboken last night. Amazing place. Great restaurant.
2017-11-26,5,I think Vito's is super neat-oMakes no sense , no? I guess it makes it seem like I'm speaking nonsense...But that's what a prosciutto and moZZarel' sandwich will do to ya . ZzZzZ seriously though, you can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches here. Their fresh moZzarella is A1.
2017-11-16,5,Oh Vito's how I love thee. A staple Italian deli in the heart of Hoboken, this place is always packed, for a reason. Literally everything they make is good, from salads, to sandwiches, to the hot food specials made each day. The staff is always ready to greet you with a smile and execute your Italian delicacy of choice to art form. While it is pricey, you get a great bang for your buck. Sandwiches can definitely last 2 meals, same goes for the salads. Such a great place - highly recommend!
2017-10-29,5,Best sandwich in Hoboken, hands down. Wish it was open later so I didn't have to rush to get there after work
2017-10-18,5,Best hoagies or heros in town. I went during an off hour after my mani next door so I didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes for my sandwich. I opted for the Vito hero which is basically an Italian. The deli carries an assorted array of Italian snacks which includes Pizelle's and vanilla wafers. The portions are generous and the bread is soft, even when you order one at 3 in the afternoon like I did. Their heros are just as good as the ones I've had back home in Philly, maybe even better.
2017-09-29,2,Food was good, but customer service and attitude very bad. Just went in and pointed to a hero sandwich that was on the board for 10.99. I asked if I can "get half of one of those sandwiches". They said sure and when ready said it was 10.99 (Plus tax). When I questioned them, they said "we don't make half sandwiches" and showed me the very large roll that they cut the sandwich from. I suggested that they should have mentioned that when I ordered the "half sandwich" and they dismissed me completely. They need a bit more common sense when dealing with customers!
2017-09-17,5,Know what you want because they move fast. The staff is friendly, helpful, just quick. Also love how they are open on Sundays when most of the good mutz delis aren't. They have plenty of options to choose from. We got the Italian Cuban and Soprano. Mozzarella in both was delicious. They are really generous with how much Mutz they give. The bread was really good (a bit hard). They stuff the sandwiches with a bunch of ingredients. I loved the peppers and garlic spread in the soprano. It goes well with the ham and hot cappi. The Cuban was my favorite. Pork loin and ham with pickles, garlic mayo, and ooey gooey provolone. I definitely want to come back and try some of the sides.  They have a nice and cozy outdoor seating area.
2017-09-11,5,I have never had anything less than mouthwatering from Vito's. My friends and family back in Philly actually send me muzz and burrata orders when they know I am heading back their way. I ordered a large cheese tray for Christmas that could have fed an army and that army was super happy to be chowing down on that delicious cheese on Christmas Eve (and even happier that I didn't attempt to cook anything.) Their jarred sauce is happily welcomed in my home and is even up to the standards of my Italian fianceÃÅ who has only known homemade sauce his entire life. He goes there for sandwiches when he has half days from work and spends days salivating over his future order. CALL AHEAD FOR ORDERS! This place in bumpin most days and the last thing you want is to be waiting 45 minutes (not exaggerating that wait time.) Vito's is a Hoboken staple and my muzz preference is always theirs!
2017-08-27,4,The mozzarella (mutz) is really good here! The bread used for the sandwiches was a bit too hard for me so next time I think I'll go for the panini version. I got the veggie mutz, which had portobello, roasted red tomatoes, and grilled eggplant. The veggies weren't bad but the mutz was truly the star. Definitely ask for a side of hot peppers - they make a world of difference! Also bring cash - there's a 3.99% charge for credit cards.
2017-08-25,5,If I could give this deli more than 5 stars I would. From upstate NY visiting and this is the best hero I've ever had in my life. On top of the awesome food the customer service was super friendly and a great  place to be. I wouldn't change a thing, thank you for the great experience!
2017-08-20,5,I don't write a ton or reviews but felt compelled to recognize the outstanding crew at Vito's.  They always make you feel like family.  They go the extra step to let you that they appreciate your business and do so with a smile.  It's often crowded and hectic but it never takes me an inordinate amount of time and my order is always right. It's nice to support a local business that truly deserves it.
2017-08-16,4,I love Cuban sandwiches but was a little skeptical about ordering the Italian Cuban sandwich that was recommended from the Mutz Festival. I should not have been! It was delightful and satisfying. I thought the price was a little steep but the bread was good and Vito's did not skimp on the ingredients. I took half home and it was just as delish five hours later.
2017-07-21,5,This place is the real deal, I'm Italian and always appreciate when a place keeps it traditional..  they've got the goods.. ordered a bag full of food and headed to central park for picnic with friends...
2017-07-12,2,The Buffalo chicken sandwich was very ordinary the chicken was bland and very chewy I would definitely not get this sandwich the next time
2017-07-08,1,This place is not worth the hype. RIDICULOUSLY OVERPRICED. Ordered a chicken cutlet sandwich with broccoli rabe on a hero and it came with a single, thin piece of chicken... FOR $11.70. Seriously this place is half the portion of anywhere else in Hoboken for double the price. Luca Brasi's blows this place out of the water. Will never return.
2017-06-23,5,Love love love this place! I grew up in Hoboken eating Fiore's and Biancamonos. Not sure why, but I never really tried Vito's until a few months ago. Now, I'm OBSESSED. First, the sandwiches aren't skimpy like Fiore's and not crazy gigantic like Biancamanos. They're right in between, which I like. My main go to sandwich is the fresh mozz, roasted red peppers and balsamic drizzle sandwich. Pair it with their Kettle chips and omg you'll be addicted!!
2017-06-19,5,This place is the real deal. The Italian hero is so fresh "especially with homemade mutz"- bread incredible- i bought a bunch of dishes to serve for Father's Day- every loved it.
2017-06-08,5,Easy review: Delicious food, the best sandwiches and really nice staff.   Great for breakfast too!
2017-05-28,4,My daughter picked up sandwiches and a macaroni salad to dine in. Sandwich was  big. Nice bread.  Good quality cold cuts.  Macaroni salad was ok nothing spectacular. Over all a nice Italian sandwich.
2017-05-04,5,I am absolutely in love with Vito's. I happened into the Italian deli while in town from Boston visiting a friend who had just moved from the West Village to Hoboken. What a find! The lines can be some what long in the small space, but they usually get you through quickly, and regardless, it's worth the wait. I had a roast beef sub and it was amazing. The bread was nice and crusty and the portions generous. While waiting in line I was enticed by the jars of homemade roasted garlic marinara and bought one to try. It is UNBELIEVABLE!!! On subsequent trips I stock up on multiple jars to use at home or to gift. Not to be out done, they have been voted "Best Mutz" (homemade mozzarella) at Hoboken's Mutz Fest... Sometimes you are lucky enough to get a sample while you wait, but make sure you get some on your sandwich or to take home if not.
2017-03-23,5,I'm from Chicago. I accidentally ended up here last time I was in the area and I thank my lucky stars that God delivered this gem of a deli into my life. The mutz is outta this world and the customer service is great too. Five stars and I will definitely be making the pilgrimage back sooner rather than later
2017-03-20,4,Another fantastic Italian sandwich shop / deli in a centrally located part of Washington Street in Hoboken. Parking is next to impossible in this area. Plenty of options to choose from, ingredients are all fresh / delicious. You will get an authentic Jersey / Hoboken / Italian deli experience here. Mozzarella is delicious - though I do take issue with the fact they have a sign they crowns them "best mozzarella in Hoboken" when M&P's has won the "Hoboken Muzzfest" competition the last several years.Solid deli - just not #1 in Hoboken.
2017-03-08,5,Seriously the best Italian Deli in town.  You won't go wrong stopping here. I always end up buying more than I can eat because I stand there waiting in line getting hungrier and hungrier and things in the display cabinet always has amazingly fresh veggies.
2017-03-08,5,Really, I can't say anything negative about them. The first time I had Vito's my brother, who lives in Hoboken, introduced me and Mr. C. to the hot roast beef with mutz and brown gravy. Made me wish he got a *whole* one just for me and not cut into thirds to share (*eye roll*). He also introduced me to my very first cannoli which was heavenly. So decadent that you really should be satisfied with one even though you're tempted to have half a dozen.Fast forward to today and I made it during their happy hour which brings down the price of the subs significantly. It was around 3pm and I was there with only two other customers. Everyone was helped quickly and efficiently. While I was waiting for my two hot roast beef with mutz and brown gravy (I'm not making the same mistake of *SHARING* one this time), I was having a casual conversation with a gentleman with a goatee (damn, I forgot to ask for his name). I mentioned that I was from California and I loved their sandwiches and cannolis. He was so nice and generous that he included a delicious cannoli on the house! From the excellent sandwich to the excellent staff, I will be sure to continue to visit Vito's every time I come to visit and recommend them to visitors to the area.
2017-03-06,5,Just want to say how much my wife and I enjoyed the delicious sandwiches I got a prosciutto, mutz with roasted peppers She got grilled veggies with mutz. Both were delicious and ample sandwiches.I highly recommend you order in advance especially on a Saturday. The line looked incredibly long and we avoided it.
2017-02-22,4,Great sandwiches, I have tried many and never had a bad one. They had some Florence lace cookies was so good. Ate the whole container of cookies in one day.
2017-01-29,5,This place is one of my favorite places for an Italian sub. I've tried so many of their subs and they're all amazing. I love their fresh Mutz. The guys behind the counter are always friendly. Most time there's a line at this place but it moves pretty fast. Love me some Vito's!
2017-01-15,5,Simply the best. There's nothing like a Turkey Mutz on a weekend afternoon. Worth the line every time.
2016-12-09,4,I get the roast beef mozzarella sandwich from here with grilled veggies on top. They're super generous and the sandwich tastes great too. Minor gripes: the bread they use is really hard to bite off and chew and I could use a little more salt (but the last one is a personal preference...)
2016-10-30,5,The best heros in Hoboken! The staff are always friendly and don't skimp on toppings. I am a vegetarian and having all the veggies available for my hero is the best thing ever. Cheese selections are the best. Can't wait to explore their delicious menu further. Highly recommend.
2016-10-19,5,Absolutely delicious. Just moved to Weehawken and I was told to try Vitos so I gave it a try. The best sandwiches and mozzarella that I have ever had and will return here every week now.
2016-10-08,5,Godbless Vitos.  Everything that staff touches is gold. My favorites include the italian hero and the Cuban.  They always have amazing sides as well like broccoli rabe and the buffalo chicken pasta salad.  It is expensive for lunch but for how good it is it's not expensive it's just worth it. Vitos your worth it
2016-10-08,4,Great food, but prices getting out of hand!  Sandwiches can easily go over $10 ea.  Vito needs to appreciate that inflation has been low for several years and his prices need to reflect this. The often long wait can also add a damper on a good sandwich.
2016-10-05,5,Man, I think I might have to put this place over Frans and Fiore! The hot roast beef w/ gravy hoagie is just out of this world. The bread is perfectly soft, but holds its form. The roast beef is tender and goes perfectly with the gravy. Top it off with some fresh mutz and you have this amazing soft melty delightful sammy. The Italian cuban is delicious as well. Get either of these two sandwiches and you can't go wrong!
2016-09-03,4,Best deli in Hoboken. Whether your looking for hot food, cold salads or subs, this is the place to go. Their Swedish meatballs and macaroni and cheese are great to. Staff is also extremely friendly. Only gave it 4 stars, because delivery is sometimes a little slow, but the food is well worth the wait.
2016-08-27,5,One of the best Italian subs I've ever had!! And to top it off amazing customer service. Definitely will be ordering from them again!
2016-08-11,5,Where my love of Italian deli sandwiches began. Thankful I was introduced from young age, frustrated so many places can never compare since. It's the best pure and simple. Whatever you want they can do. This spot is legendary.
2016-07-31,3,Ordered from here for my first time today. Woke up super hungover so obviously my first instinct was a fatty sub. Decided to create my own sub and ordered chicken cutlet, prosciutto, mozz, pesto spread, sundried tomato spread and tomatoes. (You're welcome). I had to get a drink and chips also for them to deliver it since it was only one sandwich so all together came to $20. A little pricey I know. Once it finally arrived I couldn't unwrap it fast enough but then saw the grilled chicken and not cutlet and pretty much almost teared up. I was going to let it go till I looked into the sandwich to see NO Muzz and regular sundried tomato instead of their spread. I'm not one to ever call to complain about food but for 20 bucks no Muzz and no cutlet I had to. The woman was super nice and said they would send me over a new one immediately. (Thank goodness). Once the second one arrived I did get grilled chicken for a second time instead of cutlet but at this point I was eating it anyway. The sandwich itself was BOMB but had to take a star away for the two wrong deliveries. Will definitely be back here but next time might be best to pick up.
2016-07-22,5,The best fresh mozzarella on the planet, hands down.  They've won a bunch of awards in Hoboken and they definitely deserve it.  Their sandwiches are killer.  They also make amazing arancini (rice balls) and I dream about their pasta salad.  Everyone that works there is friendly, helpful, and quick.  They have a nice outdoor seating area.  It can get very busy at lunch time, so be prepared to wait, or come in earlier! Whenever we are back in town we stop in and get a little bit of everything to bring home with us.  Mouth Watering.
2016-07-18,5,Amazing sandwiches!!! The place gets pretty packed, so be prepared for a line but it's definitely worth the wait. Make sure you get fresh mozz as it's to die for !Huge selection of sandwiches, sides and plenty to go items (I.e- desserts, homemade jarred sauced, etc). No indoor seating but there is some limited outdoor seating in front.Will definitely be returning soon!
2016-07-16,5,I'm new to Hoboken and have never been to Vito's before. I was nearby trying to order a sandwich a few doors down, but that shop had run out of ingredients, so I took a walk and stumbled upon Vito's. When I walked in I knew this was the real deal. I started to study the menu and couldn't decide what to get. I guess I looked new because the great guy behind the counter said hi to me and asked if I had ever been there before. When I told him I was new to Hoboken, he welcomed me and told me that I must try the Mutz, and brought me a plate of the most delicious, fresh, amazing mozzarella I've ever eaten. He helped me to pick a sandwich, and I was floored by its size and great price! I was there at "happy hour" and what a deal!! I took my sandwich to go, and ate outside by my apartment. From the first bite, I was amazed. It was the best sandwich Ive ever had. The bread was delicious the meats and veg crisp and tasty, and the dressing and spices were on point. If you live in the Hoboken area, you don't need to go anywhere else to get subs. This place is perfect. I'll be going back again and again and again and again. Thank you Vitos!!!
2016-07-14,5,Great sandwiches, and love the folks who work here.  Always pleasant to deal with, and quick to get your order ready.  Vito's is always a stop for us when our friends come to visit!
2016-05-18,5,Amazing sandwiches! Try the Sinatra, you won't regret it. The service is a little confusing due to the small space and large number of costumer during lunch time, but with a little bit of patience you are rewarded with very tasty food.
2016-05-10,4,Great DeliThe sandwiches are always more than enough for me.  They put hearty pieces of mutz and never skimp out on the meat either.
2016-04-28,5,The "Vito's" sub. Their mozz is killer, and they have friendly, quick service.Enough said.
2016-04-24,3,Moved to Hoboken somewhat recently and have been really wanting to check this place out. There was a pretty decent line on a Sunday afternoon but it moved promptly as the service is quick. They have plenty of options and you get a great old school vibe while there. Decided to try their version of an italian sub "Vito's Hero". The ingredients were fresh and tasty for the most part. The only thing really lacking from the sub was the concrete bread they use. Also, the fact they use italian dressing instead of oil/vinegar is pretty lame but I decided to stick to the menu and not ask for the adjustment (Regret). I'll def try this place again ordering something new and maybe they have another option for a roll/bread.
2016-04-18,5,My Sunday indulgence for sure! This is probably the best Italian deli in Hoboken. Their only downside is the delivery time and order time when you call over the phone. Your best bet is to go to the store to order.
2016-04-14,3,Vito's Italian is another entrant into the already crowded Italian deli lineup that Hoboken features. Right up there with Biancamano's and Frannie's, it is a popular lunch joint. Get there early otherwise you'll be stuck on line. Vito's differs a little bit in that they only offer the one sandwich for each particular day. Like Thursdays is strictly tuna sandwich day with no other sandwiches available. Of course you can get pasta any time you want but for the sandwich, be aware of their sandwich menu. However, due to lack of selection it just doesn't reach the heights as its competitors.
2016-02-27,4,Vito's sandwiches are no joke. A few bites in of an Italian classic will take you down (in a good way). There's plenty of selection to choose from, but I always default to the ham, salami, cappy style sandwiches with some mutz and peppers. I wish the bread was a tad bit softer, but it's always delicious. Every so often, I will buy a pound of their mutz for myself and devour it because it's addictive. A little pricey, but addictive.They also have a vast selection of Italian specialty items which line the shelves of their store. If you're ever in need of some rich balsamic, this is your spot.
2016-02-16,5,Visiting from Chicago, we were looking for a quick snack before heading into dinner and came across this place. Just saw the sign and went right in, not realizing what a gem this place is. First of, when reading the chalkboard menu and seeing MUTZ as an ingredient we were embarrassed to ask what the heck MUTZ is. Clearly it must of been some great ingredient because it was on everything. We even saw flags out on Washington St advertising a MUTZ festival....The deli also sold various salads, jarred pasta sauces, cookies, and more. But nothing gave me a clue as to what MUTZ was. So, we finally pick out our sandwich, the Italian Cuban, some chips and drinks. There's no place to eat in, so we took it back to our hotel room. After examining the sandwich, variety of meats, cheese and condiments, I could not figure out what the MUTZ was. The sandwich was delicious. Fresh ingredients and so tasty but still couldn't figure out what part is the MUTZ. Was it the bread, was it how it was wrapped. What!?!?A day later while visiting with family in the Bronx, we asked if they new what MUTZ was. Still no answer but after some discussion we figure it out to be the MUUUTZARRELLA!! Oh goodness. This is why I love traveling. Always learning and experiencing new things
2016-02-15,5,Chicken cutlet, roasted peppers, with extra balsamic on a hero from Vito's is the closest F'ing thing to magic that I've ever seen. 100 out of 10. Every one of my friends made Vito's a staple during their visits to Hoboken.
2016-02-09,5,Their food is absolutely amazing. I order from here often especially during my lunch hour. Customer service is also really good. Looking forward to going back.
2016-02-06,5,This place has the best prosciutto di parma and mozzarella sandwich in hoboken and if you don't know that already then you should really just go try it.
2016-01-17,4,Hungry for a solid sandwich, I yelped for a nearby deli and Vito's came up. There is a rather high step in front of the entrance, desperately looking for a way to maneuver my stroller in, one of the workers saw me struggling and came to my rescue! The menu has plenty of options, I spotted a prosciutto & mutz so I ordered that. YUMMY! So good that I brought the family back a few months later and ordered the same thing. I do believe the secret is out though because the line on a weekend is quite long. Even after we placed our order, it took about 10 minutes for the sandwiches to be made.
2016-01-17,5,A bacon egg and cheese will never compare after you've had the prosciutto and egg breakfast sandwich. Do yourself a favor and get it with some fresh mozzarella, and it honestly cures everything in your life as you're eating it. A sandwich so good it's borderline disrespectful.
2016-01-14,5,I tried their fresh muzz about two months ago after a four year rut: really delicious stuff. Only two items give me that 20 second head buzz after eating: the o-toro at Taro Sushi, in Brooklyn, when prepared by the owner Sano. And the muzz at Vito's. We're talking tongue to the point of your head. Better than whippits. The only drawback is that you need to finish it in one day. It loses its taste and texture soon after. Sometimes I'll cover it in EVOO; this helps somewhat and can actually compliment the salt bath if the EVOO is buttery rather than grassy. I look forward to trying their made to order burratta.
2016-01-03,4,I really enjoyed Vito's.  I tried the "Vito's" traditional sub and it was packed with meat and Mozzarella.  I have to say though the taste was pretty bland overall.  I wanted hot peppers on it and they loaded it with banana peppers, which have a kick but no where near satisfying.  Not being biased but the place down the street (M&P Deli) is much better. The Italian sub their out-weights Vito's sub in both scale and dollar. Overall 4 stars.  Still for an Italian sub in NJ, it's in my top 5 category.  Definitely worth it to try another sub their.
2015-12-27,5,Great selection of sandwiches and sides. Thanks for teaching me what mutz is and what an Italian grinder should taste like. This place is outstanding to grab a takeout lunch if you don't mind the wait.
2015-12-23,5,This place is great, definitely my favorite sandwich place in town.  The Chicken Sorrentino is possibly the perfect hero, although the Sinatra is pretty awesome too, or just the roast beef and mozzarella.  I don't know, they're all great, you can't go wrong!
2015-12-20,2,This place has really good food. I've been a loyal customer as a Hoboken resident. However, when it comes to take out and delivery they have awful customer service. They will tell you it's a 2 hour wait for delivery and if you try to call in an order for pick up they will tell you it's an hour wait . Today I got hung up on when trying to order a to go order. They said they didn't have time to take my order because of a big catering order and hung up on me. As much as I love the food at Vito's I refuse to give them my business. Very disappointed.
2015-12-18,5,If you can deal without di parma, get regular prosciutto--it's very pricey. Watch the lines, slow service during busy times. Order ahead of time for holidays and football Sundays.Nothing compares to the fresh mozzarella. I love the smokey, the garden state, and just plain prosciutto and mozzarella. The long stem artichokes are ALWAYS great.Vito's is my favorite Italian Deli in Hoboken--and trust me, I've been to them all.
2015-12-03,1,Despite having decent food (with the occasional stale bread) the service  terrible. This is the third time they've messed up in charging me for my order. You have to specify EVERY aspect of your order because if you don't they will give you the more expensive option without asking you (for example if you ask for chicken you will get chicken cutlet instead of plain grilled chicken). During their happy hour where the sandwich is supposed to be $4 off they didn't give me the discount and when asked about it afterwards they made up a quick excuse and rudely rushed me off the phone. This will be the last time that I order from here. You are better off going to Lisa's Deli on 9th and Park where the food is better and the staff doesn't try to swindle you.
2015-11-29,1,I've given this place many chances due to location however the men working there always use their hands to make sandwiches. Some where gloves but even when they have a glove on one hand they make the sandwich with the hand without the glove. Pretty gross considering they most likely due not wash their hands. Over priced for a dirty sandwich.
2015-11-05,5,The sandwich was so good!!! I got the turkey with fresh mozzarella so yummy! I also picked up a few things from the olive bar along with some stuffed peppers and artichokes !!! All looked amazing.
2015-10-31,5,People are incredibly cool that work here. Best Italian Sub I've had in A LONG Time. Vito's or bust!!!
2015-10-27,5,Come for the mozzarella, leave with a hero.The heroes are huge and they are generous with meat portions. The bread acts as a perfect vessel -- not too soft and not too hard. The mozzarella is perfection. I love the Sinatra and the Soprano heroes. Awesome staff and as others have noted, the service is excellent considering there is always a line out the door. Vito's lives up to the hype and more.
2015-10-24,5,Amazing mozzarella!!!! Had the best mozzarella, basil and tomato sandwich!!!!Excellent, quick and friendly service!!!!!!Definitely will come back again!!!!
2015-10-14,5,Vito's is quite possibly the best Italian deli in NJ. Their fresh mozzarella is the best I have ever tried. Their warm meals are delicious and reasonably priced. The chicken Marsala is particularly good. The best thing at Vito's is their specialty sandwiches. The meats are delicious and the mozz is always fresh and glorious. Get the soprano, add prosciutto and a lil balsamic. The best sandwich I've ever eaten. Try it and thank me later.
2015-09-26,5,I am always looking for a quality quick breakfast in Hoboken and I finally found it! This place actually has real eggs and perfect portion sizes. Quick service at 9:30am on a Saturday was impressive. I will definitely be back
2015-09-18,5,Vito's Italian Deli has the Best fresh mozzarella I've ever had!! There's no wonder it's been voted best mozz in Hoboken: it's soft with that light texture and great flavor and is perfectly balanced in all ways mozz should be. I walked into the store to a super friendly staff who all in unison yelled, "Oklahoma!?!?" when I told them where I was from. They then proceeded to tell me about the awards they get year after year for their mozzarella and sandwiches. All every helpful and friendly, I had them prepare me a "simple" mozzarella, salami, basil, and garlic spread hero.  Even though it was only a a few ingredients, it definitely is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life. Not only was it piled high with salami, they also didn't skimp on the mozzarella.  I also grabbed a few different stuffed peppers and about a pound of that great mozz and some bread to go.  This cheese is a great snack with simply some olive oil and salt and pepper on bread or a cracker.  It's been about a month and I still dream of that delicious sandwich. I will make it back there for sure on my next visit to JC!  So if you're ever in the are, be sure to stop in and grab one of their specialties and any number of other already prepared dinners and entrees. This place is great and I'm so glad I found out about it.
2015-09-10,4,Get the meatballs!!!! This review is based on them alone. Amazing amazing. The only downside to this place is the weird hours (close early, etc).
2015-08-28,4,Had the Sinatra hero and it had excellent flavor. The "mutz" (which is apparently mozzarella) is awesome and they make it fresh there! The bread was a little tough, but maybe I am just not used to that type of bread. Overall I enjoyed the sandwich.
2015-08-21,4,Homemade lobster ravioli and vodka sauce makes it worth the drive. They certainly don't skimp on filling the ravioli with lobster. The sauce is always so fresh and some of the best I've had. I've had their red sauce as well (they were out of vodka sauce) and it was good (I'm not a red sauce fan in general).
2015-08-10,4,I love their sandwiches and their fresh mozz. Don't order for delivery because you'll be waiting a LONG time. There is always a long line there too, but its worth it. They also have outdoor seating which is nice.
2015-08-06,5,I stopped over for a sandwich was enjoyed it VERY much!(full disclosure, I had to come here b/c M&P was closed... But I'm very glad I did!)DeÃÅcor: It's your typical Italian deli in Hoboken. There is a small waiting area, a counter full of delicious meats and cheese, and a menu that you can't miss. They have everything you could want on, or for, a sandwich. I stayed and ate by sitting at one of their (few) outside tables and it was very nice.Bathroom: I doubt there is one for customers.Staff: Everyone was very friendly and accommodating.Food: My sandwich, a s classic Italian hero, was fantastic! It was just the right size, which is to say it's BIG, and the fixings were very, very tasty. It was served on hard bread, which I prefer soft, but I didn't think to ask for soft... my fault. I also had a bag of chips and a water.Value: All in I didn't spend more than $10, which is solid. Really good value for your dollar.I am now a huge fan of Vito's and I will certainly be back in the future. I still think M&P is king but Vito's is a VERY close second in my book.
2015-08-05,5,This is my second time eating at Vito's in two days! Finally decided to give it a try and now I just can't stop. The Parma Prosciutto is to die for, pesto, artichokes, basil, oil and vinegar, and oregano! My favorite sandwich to date. Not only is the food delicious but the people are so friendly! Great service, everything is made to order and it shows! Highly recommend this place to anyone who comes through Hoboken.
2015-07-05,4,Oh Vito, you know the way to my heart!  MUTZ!  So good and fresh.  No rubbery Mutz here, only premium cheese for a premium place.  Ordering can be a bit of a challenge.  They will not let you pay before your order is 100% ready, so don't rush them.  When it is very busy, they offer some apps to the customers that make you want MORE!  I have had two of their heroes and I will keeping going back for other new experiences as long as they stay open.  I would only suggest they have an option to toast the bread to make it less tough, or offer softer bread. It can get messy when you are ripping apart the bread and juices fly all over the place.  They have a large selection of oils, vinegars, and other Italian delicacies for sale.  They have won multiple awards for the best Mutz in town, which is why I say this place is above the rest!! Drop in and ask for the special of the day, I know you will not be disappointed.  If the weather is nice, be sure to sit on their patio in front.  People watching and eating the best Mutz in town is the LIFE!
2015-06-19,5,This is the Hoboken that I fell in love with when I moved to town to go to school and all these years later, i'm still pleased every time that I go.... Great sandwiches with fresh mozzarella. Truly a treat for the taste buds!
2015-06-17,5,Rave! The best!  Best sandwiches. Massive heroes. Award-Winning mozzarella. Astounding hot dishes. Imported Italian goodies you can't find anywhere except Italy. Daily specials, salads, pesto sauce, olive spread, dried tomato spread, top notch catering, great service and great value. Yum
2015-06-17,4,Authentic, old school original and one-of-a-kind! Try the roast beef sandwich special on Wednesdays only. Delicious!
2015-06-02,5,This deli is the real deal. I ordered a Turkey and Mutz sandwich with Pesto to-go. I ate it on the PATH train and wanted to exclaim how good it was to my fellow riders, but they probably already knew by the speed at which I was scarfing it down. I reside in Brooklyn where delis lurk on every corner, but the only deli sandwich I've had that's as good is from Graham Avenue Meats And Deli in Williamsburg. Super fresh, super tasty, super simple. Perfectly full.
2015-05-20,4,This Italian deli in Hoboken is pretty solid.  I've read great things about the Mozzarella Sandwich so I had to give it a test-drive and it was good.  Not, "Wow!" but definitely good.There's so much going on in that small deli that it's hard to focus.  Meats, cheeses, breads, sauces, wines, pastas . . . it was hard to focus.It's definitely a great place to stop for a sandwich or even get some ingredients to go home and cook up your own feast.  Four stars.
2015-05-07,5,This place is amazing! This past Friday I ordered 6 feet of sub and 100 wings from them less than 24 hours before i needed it delivered, for the Mayweather fight. They arrived exactly when they said they would be there and everything was great. We are still eating the sub today (the next day) and it is just as good as when it arrived. This is the first time ordering from Vito's but definitely not the last.
2015-05-03,5,Wow, this place truly lives up to the hype! The sandwiches are delicious! I had the fresh mutz hero which is fresh mozzarella, roasted peppers, basil and Italian dressing. It was out of this world good! Seating is very limited and parking is hard to find but its worth it!
2015-04-08,5,Wow. 0 complaints. Amazing customer service. Amazing bread. Amazing meats and of course amazing mutz! I don't really need to say more.
2015-04-07,5,Delicious and friendly. The Turkey Meatball Parmagiana is more than fantastic. 10 stars for this place. Really delicious. I only wish they had an eating area so i wouldn't have to drive my hot sandwich 3 miles to go but. It's worth every penny! Great seasoning, great bread, perfect amount of marinera! Truly a Hoboken Gem.
2015-03-26,5,I ordered a hot roast beef sandwich with fresh mozzarella. It was delish!! I also ordered some of their macaroni salad, which was also fantastic. I loved the atmosphere here, and the people working there were all very nice. They have a lot of different choices to choose from. The prices were on point too! Not too pricy by any means. Good classic Italian food!
2015-03-14,5,There is NO better mozzarella ANYWHERE! Considering another deli? Fuggedaboutit! Vito's is the best. I've taken a mozzarella tour of Hoboken and tried 5 famous spots. None hold a candle to the warm, salt briny, buttery, melt in your mouth, perfectly addictive mozzarella that Vito's churns out fresh 4 TIMES DAILY!I have loved Vito's for years--28 years to be exact!I grew up in Hoboken spoiled with this mozzarella. Now I live in TN and I cannot find anything that even remotely resembles Vito's cheese. It's just not fair.When in Hoboken you do as true Hobokenites do. Eat Vito's mozzarella. Doesn't matter how long the line is. Wait. I had the mozzarella (salt brined, wet, warm) with roasted red peppers, sundried tomatoes and a light drizzle of balsamic vinegar sandwich. I've been getting this sandwich most of my life and every time is just like the first. Dom's Bakery provides the bread and it's also, like Vito's, perfect.I cry their mozzarella is SO good. It's worth a flight from TN. Or worth having them ship it overnight or 2 day express.
2015-03-12,5,Classic classic Hoboken - from the vibrant storefront awning resembling the Italian flag, to the food. You cannot go wrong with fresh mutz on any hero. You can guarantee a great experience almost every single time. Just make sure to call 1 1/2 hrs ahead of time if you want delivery!
2015-03-04,5,Best deli in Hoboken.  The folks that work in there, including the namesake, are real nice and will make sure you get what you want.  The line can be a beast - don't go before football on Sundays.  I've eaten here twenty times and never been disappointed.
2015-02-16,5,Came here on a recommendation from a friend, and boy am I happy I did.  I got the "Garden State" which is spinach, broccoli rabe, garlic and mutz.  AMAZING.  Literally the best thing I have ever had.   The vegetables were fresh, the garlic spread and mutz on point... just heavenly.   I also got a piece of chicken cutlet plain on the side - was also tasty.  The folks in there were super friendly and made everything quickly.  Highly recommend.  A tip - there is nowhere to sit and eat that I saw, so just know this is an order and eat elsewhere place.
2014-12-31,4,Ordered the Parma Prosciutto and Hot Roast Beef heroes. Waited on line for about 25 minutes, but everyone was friendly, the mutz is unbelievable and the heroes were delish!  I think my fave wad the parma prosciutto.
2014-12-19,5,I'm surprised this place doesn't have more reviews. It is hands down one of my favorite delis. The sandwiches, broccoli rabe, fresh noodles, and I could go  on and on. There is nothing that isn't amazing.
2014-12-01,4,I work in Weehawken, NJ and we frequently order from Vito's and it has yet to disappoint. The mutz is always super fresh and the sandwich portions extra generous. My favorites include a pressed Panini with grilled chicken, fresh mutz, spinach, roasted red peppers, and balsamic vinegar or another made-to-order on a hero this time with chicken cutlet, mozzarella, avocado, garlic spread, sun dried tomato.If you like Italian delis and you get the opportunity to eat at Vito's I'd definitely recommend it.
2014-11-29,5,This was a favorite of mine in the 90s when I attended Stevens Tech. I've been living in Virginia since graduation. Nineteen years later, we (wife and 4 kids) were in the area and stopped in for sandwiches. You'd be hard pressed to find any restaurant that could keep up the quality over such a long time, Vito's did not disappoint. Great bread, the kind you can only get in New Jersey or New York, silky smooth mutz made fresh daily, and the salty goodness of prosciutto d Parma. Yum. Delicious. If I was on death row, and given a last meal, it'd be a no brainer, prosciutto & mutz from Vito's. If you can only get one meal in Hoboken, go to Vito's.
2014-11-08,3,I ordered the Rock Mutz-iano Panini and was surprised to find it had a white sauce on it, seemed like horse radish, but it wasn't clear. All the other strong flavors on the panini were completely masked. I called to find out, the woman who answered didn't know it had sauce and asked to confirm, apparently they weren't aware that all internet references to their menu, including their own site lacked this detail. I was pissed because it has to be one of the most obnoxious flavors, to omit it is a mistake sure, though why even include it at all, it doesn't fit the flavor profile. They offered to make me another, but it was delivery and I didn't want to make them come back out for one sandwich. I've picked up different sandwiches from here before,which were solid, but overall not much difference between this place and the 3-4 similar spots in Hoboken.
2014-10-24,3,The staff at Vito's is very nice the food is fresh and taste good I can't say the best ever but it is a bit pricey which I am not too crazy about come lunch time
2014-10-21,5,I do not think that Vito's makes the best mutz in Hoboken (that honor goes to Fiore's).  However, Vito's is still an excellent deli.  What separates Vito's from Fiore's and Lisa's (the other two outstanding Italian deli's in town) is that, unlike these others, Vito's has several legit vegetarian hero option.  My favorite is the Garden State.
2014-10-12,5,Best mutz in Hoboken.....hands down one of the best deli ' s in the area...the service is always great despite the long lines....Vito and his staff always make you feel at home....there is never a time I don't stop in when ever I'm in Hoboken!
2014-10-10,2,Vito's.... What a let down. All this talk about their mozzarella, and it's barely even noticeable in my sandwich. I ordered Prosciutto di Parma and Mozzarella, that's it, nothing else (the Italian way). I was very excited to devour this almighty sandwich, but it fell short. Here are my reasons:1. The bread is not your typical Italian deli 'tear your gums apart' bread. It's soft rectangle-ish and yellow, whereas I'm used to the long pointy BROWN crispy bread for my sammiches.2. The mozzarella was barely noticeable in the sandwich. Fresh homemade mozzarella, is supposed to be warm, juicy, and... MILKY. Taste like nothing. 3. I paid $14.50 for the sandwich and a SnappleThe Prosciutto was a tad salty and I'm not sure it was exactly Parma, considering it was bright red as to a more browner color in that of Parma Prosciutto. But either way the taste was good. I won't go back, although they have a nice market selling packaged Italian foods/novelties I can go elsewhere for that. I strongly recommend M&P Biancamano Deli a few blocks uptown. Best mozzarella in Hoboken. If you want GREAT mozzarella go to Giovanni's in Secaucus. Buon Appetito
2014-09-15,5,Love this place. Come here for my specialized Italian items to cook with (cheeses, pasta, meats, condiments,etc).  I usually get anything with mutz (fresh mozzarella).. my favorite sandwich though hands down is the Parma Proscuitto with fresh Mozzarella and the garlic spread!  I can eat two of those although one is large enough to eat for lunch and dinner.
2014-09-13,5,Best in north jersey. Get the mutz salted. Even betterEverything is great. It's priced like the rest of Hoboken
2014-09-03,5,There are not many times in ones' life that a sandwich can be so stand out, that I would take my time to post about it.  Vito's has all the right stuff.  I love how they craft each sandwich and how it is artfully done with a huge case of authentic Italian meat serving as the artists tool. This is a must go for all Hoboken residents and visitors. 5 stars!!'
2014-09-02,4,It's all about the Mutz!I have to say its rare when an eatery lives up to the hype. I mean really what could possibly be so amazing about a deli sandwich? In this case...everything!I went to this staple of Hoboken, NJ to have one of the famous, artisan crafted Hero Subs. The staff were very friendly and even offered a nice piece of freshly made mozzarella (Mutz) for me to try while they prepared my sandwich. Everything on the menus looks good, but I hade the Sinatra with homemade garlic spread and roasted red peppers. Delicious!They also have an assortment of other non-sandwich goodies if you're in the mood for something different. This place is great, and is definitely worth a visit if your in the city.
2014-08-19,5,One of the best delis I've ever! The Sinatra hero is my favorite, Italians meats and a huge slab of fresh mozzarella cheese. The heroes are so big I can make too meals out of it. Definitely have to spot by in your eating in Hoboken!
2014-08-19,1,STAY AWAY - DO NOT COME HERE!I purchased a $5 for $10 coupon through LivingSocial for Vitos. Right before it expired last week, I went to visit Vitos to use it but they were closed all week long for vacation. They were opening the deli back after the coupon expired (suspicious, right?). Thinking that they'd honor the coupon the following week since they closed their establishment for a full week without warning. Well that was not the case. They only would honor the $5 I paid for the coupon. This was not only disappointing since I go to Vitos all the time without a coupon but this not my fault as I couldn't use the coupon before it expired since they closed the deli!!! They should have honored my coupon - instead of throwing a fuss, I just used the stupid $5 I put in plus a little more (b/c i just wanted to get a sandwich and get out). I will never come here again and spend a penny here. I will tell all my friends, family, coworkers and anyone else that will listen in Hoboken, Jersey City, and New York City to NEVER come here. Instead I recommend going to Fiores on Adams st, M&P Biancamano on Washington, or even Tony Bolognas on First - they have better sandwiches anyway. How dare they pull a fast one on their customers like that. They have absolutely no respect for their customers. Yes, I used a livingsocial coupon, but they also forget customers like me come to Vitos many times without one. Way to retain your customers Vitos. You should learn some retention marketing and maybe also get some lessons in customer service. NEVER EAT HERE!!!
2014-08-09,5,One of the best delis I have been to. Fast, friendly and food is killer. Order the "mutz" ie mozzarella! You won't regret it! My boyfriend and I ordered the turkey sandwich with mutz, tomatoes and lettuce. It was really good but I think that next time I will order something that is more Italian like meatballs or prosciutto. Sandwich was still very tasty though. A bit pricey at $11 but well worth it! I can't wait to come back and try other things.
2014-07-25,1,I would be reasonable and give them a 3 to average out the disappointment for service vs the food itself, but nah... I'm too mad. So I went in yesterday after work to pick up my sandwiches, a roast beef+mutz with gravy and a Parma Prosciutto. The Roast beef sandwich was delicious (shared with my gf), but then I was given the wrong prosciutto sandwich and when I found out it was too late. I tried calling them but they had already closed. I understand these mistakes happen and I know the guy in front of me ordered a Prosciutto+mutz+pesto sauce (which cost $1 less and I was not a fan of the pesto), so I'm really not too upset about a minor mistake. I called them up this morning when they opened to see if they would apologize or compensate me for giving me the wrong sandwich, but all I got was a laugh in the face... hahaha very funny (not...!)It's not even about the money, its the principle behind how they handled the situation. Even though $11 for a sandwich is rather excessive compared to the other deli's in the area, the $1 is nothing. I can't tell you just how excited I was for that Parma Prosciutto. It was a such a huge let down. Ok. I'm done venting and I won't be back.
2014-07-15,4,Wow, that mozzarella is faboulous! I should have eaten more. I got the Vito and I loved the flavor. The service was friendly and they went the extra mile to make the tourist from ATL feel welcomed! It is a walk up counter with no seating, but perfect for an on the go lunch.
2014-07-10,5,This is one of my favorite places to eat.  They have the absolute best mozzarella, and they make it themselves!  I love their prosciutto and mutz hero and the ravioli in the fridge when you walk in.  Sometimes I get a chicken parm hero and that is amazing too.  They're also so funny and friendly despite it being a tight space and often being crowded!
2014-06-28,3,Got a turkey and cheese sandwich for $8.95.  It was on a roll about 10-12 inches long.  Enough for two meals.Sandwich was good, but the service is a bit rushed and the service system disorganized. For such a long standing establishment you think they would have some kind of clearly labeled line system worked out.When you enter you'll see one line on the right and another spattering of people on the left, that sort of looks like a line as well. It's unclear where you should stand - who had ordered - where to go if you want to quickly grab a packaged item and go. Which line do you wait in? Why does it take 10 minutes to serve 5 people when there are more than 5 people working behind the counter?When I finally got to the end of the line on the right - that I discovered was the line for ordering a sandwich, I told the man that I would like a turkey and provolone cheese sandwich on whole wheat bread with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and mustard with no oil or mayo.  He asked it I wanted vinegar and oil, which I found strange. I told him please no oil or mayo. He said he'd only put on the sandwich what I told him.  Then he asked me to repeat my order.When I opened the sandwich it was on white bread.Ok.  I understand they are busy, but that was strange.Also it would be nice if the cashier hustled a little but because everyone else around her is in constantly in motion, while she stares ahead - not proactive about trying to assist people that are either waiting in line or looking confused. On a side note, they are a bit gruff on the phone.  I had tried to order a sandwich at 8:30 over the phone - half hour after their posted opening time.  The man that answered said, "Lady, do you just know we opened?" when I tried to place an order with him.So. All in all good food. Questionable care for customers.
2014-06-18,5,The Vito's sandwich is delicious!!! Make sure you are ready to wait in line, but it's worth it!  I've had other sandwiches here which are also good, but the Vito's sandwich is the best by far!
2014-06-09,5,Loved Vito's. Perfect NJ Italian Deli. Vito himself was there helping with the customers and making sure everyone was taken care of. We got the fresh mutz, and the smokes mutz, both very good.
2014-05-28,3,Food is pretty good but delivery is inconsistent. Today I called to order at 4:50 (they stop delivering at 5) and was told the delivery guy had already left.
2014-05-25,5,This place has nearly a 5 star review and for good reason. The food is absolutely off the charts. From the bread to the cheese, it is as advertised, the best in hoboken. Possibly the best part about the place is Vito himself. You couldn't ask for a nicer guy.
2014-05-22,5,Best fresh mozzarella i've had in a while. Nice place with good selection. Breakfast offerings as well.
2014-05-04,5,I had a sandwich with mozzarella cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, arugula, and balsamic. soooo good!!! best mozzarella I had in a long time!
2014-04-22,5,One of the best delis I have ever been to. Granted I am Irish and not Italian so I'm not the most well versed or most experienced when it comes to delis, but I'd be hard pressed to name other delis that would be in the same league as Vito's. I really want to try something other than the classic Italian hoagie (I'm from PA), but why would I waste my time when I know what I would be missing out on. Sorry - I like what I like and this is my review - not yours. Another cool thing about this place is that a couple of the dudes are Raider fans like I am (you'll see them rocking a silver and black cap on Sundays). I'd like to believe I get an extra slice or two of ham or something for our common bond - but probably not. Plus - they have a big flat screen staring you in the face with an NFL game on Sundays so you don't miss a beat when you're satisfying that Sunday afternoon craving or nursing that Sunday afternoon hangover. As Ben Stiller says in that oscar winning remake of Starsky and Hutch ... 'Do it, do it' and hit up Vito's.
2014-04-19,5,My absolute favorite place in Hoboken. Service is spectacular and the subs are ridiculous. If there's a long line, its for a reason and it's worth the wait. I would eat here every day if my girlfriend would let me!
2014-04-15,5,Quality fresh muz Italian sandwich- fresh bread, nice hot pepper spread, & thinly cut meats. The place is a must for anyone visiting Hoboken. The guys behind the counter are friendly and the line does move quickly.. Great Italian deli!
2014-04-06,5,Just landed in EWR and headed straight to Vito's for roast beef sandwich with mutz and gravy...one word - AWESOME!
2014-03-24,5,Vito's is fantastic - we're new to the area and were looking for a good Italian pork store, and this is by far the best spot in the area for homemade mozzarella and sandwiches. Highly recommended. Get there early though, because there's always a line (and for good reason)!
2014-03-18,5,just an amazing experience anytime you get something to eat
2014-03-10,5,Wow.. Wow. Wow. I thought I've been to a true Italian deli until I came here. The mozzarella is to die for. Their bread- amazing. Roasted red peppers are better than the ones I had in Italy. And the prosciutto.. I'm still drooling as I write the review. Put those 4 "simple" ingredients together and you have the best sandwich you'll ever eat. I actually ate this so slow because I wanted to savor every bite. I thought Luca Brasi's was good, but Vito's is the spot... Dreaming about my next sandwich...
2014-02-26,2,Ugh, this place basically ruined my Super Bowl Sunday. From all the crazy reviews and lines at this place I had such super high expectations. Firstly, I've had better mozzarella at my local shitty market. This mozzarella was rubbery and tasteless. I also wasn't too impressed with the bread our hero was on. Also pretty tasteless and hard. I prefer a semolina or at the very least seeded hero bread. I thought the cold cuts weren't great either. Super disappointed.
2014-01-26,5,Best deli in Hoboken! The Vito's Hero is by far my favorite lunch in all of Hoboken. Bread is perfect, fresh mutz is amazing, and the culcuts are always fresh. Highly recommended!
2014-01-25,5,Upper echelon of deli's in Hoboken, in my opinion in the top 3 for sure.I haven't been in a long time, but that's a result of my meager attempts to stay healthy and not indicative of the pure awesomeness of this place.  In terms of mutz, there's is in the premieÃÄre league, and like the other great deli's of Hoboken it's complimented with fresh, high quality bread and meats.  Vito's like most places have signature sandwiches or if you are picky you can order whatever you'd like.  I split my time in this regard, but if you want to make it easy and get a signature sandwich the Soprano is freaking great.Also like most Hoboken delis you can find great Italian cooking ingredients and goodies which you'll not see in ShopRite or A&P.
2014-01-19,5,Just stumbled into Vito's and I was amazed at how good the sandwiches are. I guess I was just Lucky to find Vito's ! I will return every time I visit Hoboken... This Is a place every City should have. DELICIOUS !!
2013-11-26,5,One sandwich. Six Words. Roast Beef Sandwich With Fresh Mozzarella. The bread is soft and the perfect vessel for this delicious creation. Just the right amount of gravy, muz creamy and delicious, roast beef perfectly seasoned. My mouth is watering as I write this review. I highly recommend it. One tip though, make sure the deli is open when you go. I tried going one Monday all excited for it only to find out Vito's is closed on Mondays. Do not make my mistake! Enjoy!!
2013-11-24,4,I don't get to Hoboken much, but when I do, I have to go to at least two places I have never tried. Since I have had this place bookmarked and it was only a block away from Amanda's (where we just had brunch) I knew I had to try it.  It is definitely a must try if you are in the neighborhood.  My wife probably could have spent a lot more time there just looking at all the Italian groceries and frozen pasta items they have.  I told her she was like a kid in a candy store.The lines were very long, but moved pretty quickly on a Sunday afternoon.  I knew we had to have our orders ready when we got to the front counter.  So many options, but we came up with two subs.  The Imported Parma Prosciutto with Fresh Mutz, Basil and Italian Dressing.  The other sub was the smoked turkey, fresh mutz, roasted peppers and balsamic vinegar.  We brought them home with us to have for dinner.This place is an old school Italian deli with everything you can imagine from the aged cheeses to salads.  It has been featured on ESPN Fanwiches and the Food Network.  It has also won the best mozzarella in Hoboken contest.
2013-11-08,5,Amazing chicken sorentino and buffalo chicken sandwiches.
2013-11-07,3,I used to like Vito's a lot, but now the experience is kind of exasperating. The food is excellent but it's not worth dealing with disorderly lines, unavailability of items, bad hours, and high prices. And for that many people behind the counter, the long waits make no sense. It's a shame, but at least there are other delis in this small town.
2013-10-29,3,Food is 5 star. Service is 1 star so I'll average. There are 3 separate instances where the customer service by the person at the cash register has just driven me nuts.  This, for the most part, has nothing to do with the guys who make the sandwiches. 1) refused to let me use my debit card on a $9 purchase even though I used to go 2/3 times a week. I understand the $10 minimum but really to bust my chops over a dollar?  I had to have them up charge me to $10 because I had no cash. This all is understandable. What blows my mind is the next time I went the person had the ridiculousness to tell me "sorry about last time you're a regular we shouldn't have done that". I said "no problem just take $1 off today's order."  I received a chuckle and was charged full price. 2) They never charge the same amount for the same order. Mild pet peeve. 3) I was off a few days during the week and went in the afternoon to get a sandwich. They apparently have or used to have a special deal on subs in the mid afternoon. When I go to get rung up, the person who made the sandwich tells the person at the cash register to give me the "special" price to which she responded "he's 3 minutes early" and proceeded to ring me up full price. Really bad CS in my book. I should have left without paying and come back 5 minutes later but I was so befuddled I just paid and left. Needless to say, I still go to Vito's every once (amazing subs) in a while but no where near the volume I used.
2013-09-06,5,Got the Parma and Meatball. Huge sandwiches and very good. Neat little place, you could tell it was a local favorite as I noticed the employees addressed many customers by name. Come hungry. Great little park a block away, near the water to take away to - great view of NY skyline.
2013-08-25,5,The mutz must be the most delicious I've ever had. The specialty sandwiches are amazing. Grab some sandwiches and walk down to the waterfront. Bam! A perfect afternoon.
2013-08-12,4,I love it, the fresh mutz is amazing! extremely filling.  I could only eat half.  only gripe is that the bread is too hard, but still amazing
2013-08-03,4,This place is great. Their fresh mozz is GREAT... i loved it. I got the smoked turkey with fresh mozz roasted peppers and pesto and it was soooooo good. i was only gonna eat half of the sandwich but i ate the whole thing. The staff was friendly and helpful. I prefer this place over fiores.. This will be my go to deli in Hoboken. YOU MUST TRY!! the only reason why i didn't give it a five is b/c i do think it is a bit pricey..also, there is some seating outside if you want to eat it there.
2013-07-29,5,Went here last week and discovered amazing Italian Bologna called Mortadella. So delicious! Def changing my regular from plain Bologna to Mortadella
2013-07-13,5,One of my favorite sandwich places in the world.  I think pretty much all of the sandwiches come with mozzarella, and it's fantastic! The Hot roast beef is one of my favorites here.
2013-07-05,5,Get the vito with garlic spread and hot peppers- it's amazing
2013-07-01,4,* 4.5 Stars.Second only to Fiore's Deli, the heroes at Vito's are ridiculously good.  The bread was fresh, the meat (I had prosciutto & mortadella) was delicious and of excellent quality.  The inside of the deli is actually really nice.  They have all of the imported Italian foods all over the place.  Nicest part is it's really clean and bright.  The chalkboard menu is an awesome touch, it's just a little tough to read (losing my eyesight at 29).The service (aka guys and gals making sandwiches behind the counter) was pretty good despite the long line and the outdoor seating area is great for people watching.  Only downside: it's kind of expensive.  My hero cost about 10 bucks, but I guess you get what you pay for (they take credit card on all orders more than 10 bucks).I will be back whenever I'm uptown.
2013-06-28,5,Just experienced Vito's for the first time and I am in LOVE. Such a wonderful deli. Everyone inside was friendly, especially Vito's cousin who checked on me at my table outside and offered to bring over some napkins. The shelves are stocked with authentic Italian products, many of which I recognized from my few months in Italy.The prosciutto and mozzarella sandwich with sun-dried tomatoes, oil, and vinegar was huge and divine. I will absolutely come back here next time I'm in Hoboken!
2013-06-27,5,Friendly, Filling, and Fast -- If I had to describe it. Whenever I go there I end up getting what I call the $16 sandwich: proscuitto, mutz, brocolli rabe, sun dried tomatoes. Pretty...pretty...great.
2013-06-05,5,How does Vito's only have 4 1/2 stars? They couldn't disappoint if they tried.I've been going here for as long as they've been in business. If I had a complaint it would be about the prices, not the food, but as Hoboken has risen, so has Vito's, and deservedly so. It's one of the local institutions that made Hoboken desirable in the first place.
2013-05-13,4,The best proscuitto and fresh mutz! I am a big fan and it's worth the wait.
2013-05-06,4,Vitos is pretty good. I would probably go there a lot more if it was cheaper and could accept duckbills. Anyways everytime I go in I come out happy. I usually get what I feel like eating. Most likely a sub chips and creme soda.
2013-04-09,4,Obviously, Vito's is pretty freakin good.  My sister lives in Hoboken so we stopped by here to pick a few things up.  We bought some of the fresh "mutz".  How can you not?  The mutz was on point - it was very good.  It was pretty stringy and tasted incredibly fresh.  We also sampled one of the vegetable slider sandwiches that they had made sitting behind the counter.  That again was very good.  The fresh veggies tasted great and even the bread was nice and fresh.  I am envious of all you people living in Hoboken, because you have so many great italian delis to stop at and get your fill of great stuff.  Vito's is definitely up there.
2013-03-09,5,Great sandwiches, good salads and pasta salads, enjoy the rice balls...underrated but also good are the raviolis and sauces.   Not available all of the time but something we get during the playoffs/Super Bowl is chili mac and cheese, which is sooooo good.
2013-02-26,5,Me, upon entering Vito's, two words: "Whoa, noms."...and I start to salivate.Looking around this inconspicuous little deli - which from the outside, does not appear to house very much, but oh...oh, there is much to be discovered inside - I am amazed... the sheer amount of Italian-Deli-crap that makes EVERY Italian deli jealous is currently present.  Home-made pastas in the freezer, twenty different varieties of Italian chocolate candies, licorice, fresh bread, more deli meat than you can shake a stick out of...FRESH MUZZ....The sandwich I had, a meatball-mozzarella-marinara-daily special delight was consumed firstly, in about the 20 seconds of a drive that it takes to get from the deli to the transit, and secondly, on the train home......and this thing was absolutely beast.  Like, hold it with two hands, still does not quite fit, shove it in your mouth (foul, I know, get your mind out of the gutter).....and it was enjoyed.She came, she saw, she ate..........she passed out in mozzarella (or meatball?) heaven.  God dayum.Lovely companion of mine was kind enough to share a bite (just one) of her basil/artichoke/red pepper/mozz sangwich.  It was divine.  It was vegetarian - and therefore, healthy.  Even though it was the size of Lurch's dome-piece.Nom nom nom nom.
2013-02-22,5,I'm fairly certain that heave is made mostly of Vito's mutz. Serious these sandwiches are COCO BANANAS! My only complaint is the weird hours.
2013-02-21,5,My buddy had the Mozzarella out for a get together last night and it was absolutely FANTASTIC. Great flavor and high quality when it comes to mozzarella cheese there is a huge difference from the everyday supermarket and average deli stuff in comparison to Vito's ...like night and day.  Stuff is amazing!!! sandwiches are delicious as well great old school classic italian north jersey/ny deli with high quality products.
2013-02-02,5,The wait in line is well worth it. Everything is perfect. They make each sandwich with care and truly take pride in what they do.
2013-01-25,4,I've eaten at Vito's a few times and they really make some high quality italian sandwiches. some are a little heavy on the ham for my liking, but the hot roast beef is one of the best I've had
2013-01-21,5,I dare you to find a better sandwich than the Parma Proscuitto with fresh Mozzarella and the garlic spread! Vito makes the best melt in your mouth mozzarella in Hoboken.
2013-01-12,4,Great sandwiches. I would recommend the chicken parm, which is usually exclusive on Tuesdays.Keep in mind, they are closed on Monday's and have a $10 minimum for cards.
2013-01-12,4,I have to say, the first time I came here I was disappointed. Well, they have redeemed themselves and now I am a fan!I got their Hoboken--it was grilled eggplant, fresh mutz, artichokes, roasted red peppers and balsamic on a hero. And i got it on a whole wheat hero--just so I could feel like i was being "healthy" ;). It was delicious and I am looking forward to going back and maybe trying something else...although knowing me I'll probably just get the same thing over and over again...
2012-12-21,4,my last day in NJ... stopped by got the Vito special...drove down to Sinatra street/road/ave.Sandwich was good..Service was good..salami... not over salty..big sandwich, so i ate the mutz on the side..Mutz was good..nice way to end my trip...
2012-12-13,4,I live directly across the street from Vito's, thus my Vito intake is quite high.  It is what you would expect from an upscale Italian deli.  Sandwiches are excellent.  High quality ingredients all around.  Staff is cool.  Yet to be disappointed.  If you want a very large and very flavorful sub, albeit on the upper end of the price scale, you wont leave unsatisfied.
2012-10-12,5,Do not operate heavy machinery after consuming the Vito's Special!Love this place for that sandwich alone, I'm sure they make other things really well, but I'll probably never know. Its like a ten inch hero roll, and they have to scoop the bread out of the top of it just to fit all the components of the sandwich in. Its got prosciutto, ham, capocolla, lettuce, tomato, hot or sweet vinegar peppers, and of course 1/2 inch thick house made Hoboken Muuuuttzz. And it is delicious.
2012-10-02,5,One cannot simply describe Vito's.  Vito's is a phenomenon, a force of nature.  Its a collection of the mutziest fresh mutz, the perfect subs, anything and everything that is Italian and delicious.  Don't know what you want?  Check out the chalkboards on your left and pick from some of the best sandwiches you will ever have for under $10.  I don't have a favorite; they are all tremendous.  You can also buy hot food like chicken parm and purchase some Italian goodies imported from across the sea.But people, learn the system!  One line is for ordering, the other to wait for your sandwich and pay.  RESPECT THE SYSTEM.If you live in Hoboken or work uptown and have not had some Vito's yet, just leave.  Or join us.  One of us, one of us......
2012-08-20,4,Awesome deli.  My new favorite in Hoboken.  The meats are tasty, the mozzarella is fresh and the service is fast.  I also like their hot pepper shooters (they have 3 different kinds).  I want to go back here and try all of their dishes.  If I lived uptown, I would probably frequent this deli more often.
2012-08-20,3,I am so done with this place.  Not only has their sandwich gotten smaller and more expensive, but today, they sent sandwiches with no mutz.  How do you charge 8.95 for a little sandwich and forget the one thing you are allegedly famous for?  Time after time my orders have been screwed up, and they never make it right.  I am off Vitos, there are so many other Italian delis in the area that are more reliable.  The food is good, but way overpriced, and getting smaller.
2012-08-02,4,Vito's makes amazing sandwiches! I tried their Vito, with fresh mozzarella, and it was delicious! I can't wait to go back and try a different signature sandwich. Try their wheat roll too!
2012-07-19,5,We usually go to Vito's for the sandwiches -- perfection, with the high quality fresh-slced meats, homemade mutz and awesome bread.  But sometimes we remember that they also have wonderful daily Italian food specials.  Our son is visiting, so we got 3 dishes to share:  lasagna, sausage-and-peppers, and veal parmesan.  Yumm, Yumm, and Yumm!
2012-06-30,5,Best Deli Ive Ever Been ToIf you want mozz head up the road a little further to M&P Baincomo or Fiores for the best
2012-06-19,5,Amazing mutz.Fresh bread, great meats, and that mozzarella is just perfect.  It's an old school place with a old school vibe.  There's usually a line but it goes pretty quick.  Great place!
2012-06-18,5,there are a LOT of amazing sandwiches here, but I think my favorite is the hot Roast Beef and Motz.  The Italian Cuban Panini is also pretty incredible.  Don't miss this place!
2012-06-13,5,great place, great food.  line goes quick and the guys behind the counter know what they are doing.  i usually get the same thing, as there is no need to experiment when you know what you like.  roast beef, mutz and roasted red peppers!
2012-06-04,4,I don't go here very often because there is usually a long line and a long wait.  But that is not surprising because the sandwiches are very good.  In addition to deli meats, they also have all different kinds of grilled chicken prepared (balsalmic, buffalo, etc), grilled vegetables, and more.  They also have all kinds gourmet sides, spreads, etc.  And of course excellent mutz....soft and almost buttery.They don't load up your sandwich as much as M&P Biancamano's, and their sandwiches are also a bit more expensive.  Vito's takes a bit more of a "gourmet" approach and it is no wonder why they've been so popular for so long.
2012-05-31,5,I'm not going to call it the best, but it deserves 5-stars.Excellent bread compliments the high quality ingredients.  Very consistent and delicious.  There are other great Italian deli's in Hoboken, but you would be doing yourself a disservice to not at least try Vitos!
2012-04-27,5,Another superb lunch from Vito's. I can honestly say that the "Vito" w hot peppers is the perfect Friday lunch. Fresh mutz, great meat, perfectly prepared.I've been going to Vito's for over 20 years, have tried sandwiches, salads, prepared food, just about everything on the menu. I've never been disappointed. There's nothing better than getting the warm fresh mutz and just snacking on that.On top of the great food the guys behind the counter are always friendly and have a smile or laugh even when the line is snaked out the door.If you're in Hoboken to fawn over reality stars, stop by Vito's and you'll be happier for it!
2012-04-27,4,I really like this deli.  It is hard to find a good deli around and this one is one to keep on the list.  There will normally be a line so please be prepared to wait a bit before getting served.  There is no place to sit and eat so this is order and run basically.  Their deli sandwiches are really good and their salads are fresh.  If you are looking for a good hero this is the place to go.
2012-03-25,3,Vito's is a very good deli.  Unfortunately, it's located in Hoboken, where I'd probably rank it 4th overall.  There are just some better options which make going here unlikely unless it's close or you want to mix things up.  That being said, I've had the Steven's Duck sandwich which is very good and I'd recommend it.  Their mutz is also tasty so you can't really good wrong with a make your own sandwich as long as you throw some mutz on it.
2012-03-06,5,I haven't been to every sandwich place in Hoboken but Vito's has the best sandwiches hands down in the city.  Their fresh mozzarella is for sure in the top 2 in Hoboken with Fiorres and I guess I'll throw Lisa's in the mix as well.  The line is usually pretty long when I go in for sandwiches around lunch time on the weekends.  Don't expect speedy service but all sandwiches are made to order so you will be rewarded for waiting.I usually get some rendition of the same sandwich every time I'm there; Turkey, fresh mozzarella, lettuce, tomato and mayo on a hero. The bread is always fresh and has a great chewy crust.  As I said, the cold cuts are always sliced fresh to order and I believe they are Boars Head products if that means anything to anyone (it's more marketing than anything).  Another great option I choose sometimes is the chicken cutlet which is another good choice. This is all topped off with fresh veggies and an amazingly awesome fresh mozzarella that they hand cut in large chunks and put on your sandwich.  The sandwiches are so big they have to jam all the goodies in with the back of a knife to close them up.Vito's offers a number of "spreads" such as olive, pesto about a dozen others to put on your sandwich.  They also have panini's, a large number of varying salads and some rotating daily options.  I got the bean salad this past weekend and it was pretty darn tasty.  They also offer a number of hot option including aroncini and empanadas which I believe are made fresh on a daily basis. Vito's also has a decent looking selection of frozen pasta's made at the store and dry goods but I haven't tried either.Again, this is one of my favorite options for lunch on the weekends, check it out!
2012-03-04,4,Very good Italian deli. Sandwiches are stacked and never disappoint. Bread, meats, cheeses are all fresh and delicious. I definitely recommend
2012-02-25,5,Seriously, I don't even like sandwiches. If you asked me what my ideal lunch would be, a sandwich would be nowhere near it. And yet. Vito, you may have changed my mind, when you showed me what a sandwich really could be. For $8.95 I received a sandwich that was not only as big as my head and could have easily been two meals, had I not been totally famished and also just a glutton for sandwich punishment. The bread was crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. The chicken, well it was chicken, but it was good. The roasted red peppers were flavorful. And the mutz, well WTF. I don't know why they call it that but it was truly life-changing. Now I am just thinking about when I can get another sandwich. Soon, definitely soon...
2012-02-09,5,There's a difference between an "amazing" sandwich and a "perfect" sandwich. To those of simple-minded palates that give out 5 star ratings like charity, Vito's is an Italian deli that is actually worthy of a 5 star rating. I have found the perfect sandwich, and it's in Hoboken.Jersey is pretty well known for having good subs but I had no idea I would ever find a place to rival NY. I went with a pretty standard italian sandwich and ordered one of their signature sandwiches, the Prosciutto de Parma. Every single ingredient used was flawless, right down to the bread. This place is known for it's "mutz." That's what they call their fresh mozzarella here in Hoboken. Ever had mozzarella at a fancy italian restaurant? Well the mutz they use here is ten times better and they only charge you about $8.50 for a huge sandwich. You have to get a sandwich with mutz, trust me. They weren't any slouches on the amount of meat added, either. Of course, that was top quality as well. They also didn't overdo it with the oil or vinegar like a lot of places do. This is an establishment where you probably won't go wrong with whatever you order. When you come here, you come to the Holy Grail of sandwich shops. Part of me is torn as I write this because I live in NYC but I have to give credit where credits is due. I'm not one of these people that has to hype up a place just because they live in the immediate vicinity of it. That's for rookies. I keep it real. There's great food all around. You just have to know where to seek it out and find it. I found a place that is right up there with Defonte's of Brooklyn. Yeah. I will be back.
2012-02-07,5,Vito's never goes wrong. Ever. I always swear that I will only eat half of my sammich and save the rest for later, but it's honestly just too delicious to put down.  Expect to wait in line, but the staff is friendly and moves quickly to get you your eats. Maybe it depends on the time of day that you go, but my bread was the best part of the whole sandwich, really soft and warm. A close second was the mutz, so good. Warning: these sandwiches are practically guaranteed to induce a food coma.
2012-02-05,4,Sandwich was good - however the bread is a little too hard for my taste.  I'm sure that the vinegar and oil soften it over some time, but I like to dig right in. I will definitely come here again but just gotta walk around Washington st a little while the bread is ready to eat.  Enjoy!
2012-01-22,5,I honestly haven't had a Vito's sandwich in about 3 years...and today was a blissful reunion during a meeting I had in Hoboken.we placed our orders well ahead of time and they delivered exactly when we needed them. baller status.this time I decided to branch out and try the Sinatra sandwich. I never actually had it before in all my years...and hey, you all know that I like to dare to be stupid. this beast consists of sopressata, salami, sun dried tomatoes, the infamous Vito's fresh mozzarella, and your choice of spread...I went for the roasted garlic and peppers. YEAHHHH BUDDY! amazing blend of flavors. I am glad to see the quality of sandwiches has not decreased from "EPIC DELICIOUSNESS".ten bucks for a monster sandwich...which counts as a full meal and you probably won't need to eat again for several hours. yeah, worth it.get yo ass to My Cousin Vito and scarf on a piece of heaven.
2012-01-09,4,Best Italian deli in Hoboken by a mile. Get the hot capacola, hot sopresetta, chicken cutlet, sun dried tomatoes, muzz, and garlic spread. Macaroni salad is solid there as well. Just be prepared to wait 30 minutes around lunch time.
2011-12-12,5,aggghh.. i miss my mutz and parma!! sooooooooooooooooooooo delicious.... i can't wait to go back!
2011-12-09,4,Parking can be a hit or miss in hoboken but don't let that deter you from some great sandwiches.They have perfected the meat/cheese ratio to bread. I have never seen such a neat (either definition is appropriate) sandwich. It was not messy at all to eat which is A+ in my book. I had the sinatra which included sopressata, salami, mozzarella, sun dried tomatoes and pesto spread (your choice of homemade spread). Great sandwich! Best mutz I have ever eaten by far.The boy always enjoys the roast beef, mutz with gravy. I look forward to trying more off their menu.Staff is friendly and helpful and very efficient which works well for the lunch rush.
2011-11-17,4,C'mon! this is vito's people!!! this is the mecca of subs in hoboken, this places is very unassuming and small, has soon as you are inside you are overwhelmed the feeling of a small italian deli. they have a huge selection of subs. My faviorate is a Smoked Mozzarella, Peppered Ham and Pesto Spread. Like stated before, place is small, when you enter it will be packed but the service is super fast and they have a great staff.If you live in hoboken or just visiting, It is a must-go-place no doubt about it.
2011-11-13,4,People often compare Vito's to Fiore's. Yes they are both Italian delis in Hoboken but that is where the similarity ends. If you went to Fiore's and asked for half the ingredients they have at Vito's they would probably punch you in the face. Vito's is nice for whole wheat, wraps, and veggies when you want to be "good."  The line is long but the sandwich slingers are fast. Another plus- its open Sundays.
2011-10-10,5,A BANGIN' deli!   Seriously, tried numerous sandwiches and all are bomb.  Homemade muzz is phenom and the bread is a great compliment to the sandwich.  Quality cold cuts used.  Sides are quality as well and the prices are reasonable.  For some reason there seems to be more quality Italian delis in Boken compared to parts of NYC but hey, if I'm in the area, it's either here or Biancamano for me!
2011-10-09,4,Hoboken seems like it is the mecca for Italian subs and sandwiches. You can find anything you are looking for and any style. There are a bunch of places where you can go, but there are a few that stand out more than others. Vito's is one of these really good deli's in Hoboken that you cannot go wrong with. It has a wide variety of food choices but you should mainly come here to get your Italian sub fix of the day. They have different choices for subs so you can order one of their specialty sandwiches or just create your own. I ordered the roast beef and mutz with gravy and thought it was very good. The bread was warm and soft, and the roast beef was of pretty good quality. None of that hard to chew stuff. The mutz was also pretty good and the gravy topped it all off. Just typing this up is making me crave another one.The shop is not very big but its a deli so it really does not matter The only issue is that during the lunch time rush, it can get a little hectic and crowded as people order and wait for the sandwiches. But I would say you are in and out the door in five to ten minutes tops. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful and can answer any questions you have.Overall I gave Vito's four stars because of their delicious subs, the good quality of their subs, the friendly staff and the small Italian deli feel it has. I suggest it to anyone on the northern end of Hoboken who is looking for a good sub.
2011-09-24,5,Love this place.  It's quite small and crowded as you stand in line and order at the counter.  They make everything to order and have quite a few specialty sandwiches as well.  I ordered a Parma Prosciutto and a Hoboken sandwich.  It was so good and not dry at all.  The olive spread was delicious.  They make their own mozzarella there and call it mutz and it's a MUST have.  The bread was on a long french bread-like roll.  Quantity is great and the price is awesome, but the sandwich itself is amazing.
2011-09-24,4,Great place if you need your Italian sub fix.  Let them show you the size of the sandwiches before you order.  They make nice fresh muzz, and every sandwich on the chalkcboard is with muzz, so they are a little robotic with it. I had a sandwich there with provolone, and the guy started to put on fresh muzz before he remembered.  A couple of outdoor seats good for a Fall day.  Find a good place to take a nap and watch football after your sandwich.
2011-09-15,5,Vito's is one of several amazing deli's located in Hoboken (the others are M&P and Fiore's) They have great italian sandwiches made on awesome brick oven bread. They have daily hot food specials that are also good. The salads are great too, especially the antipasto salad. The mutz is very good and should be tried. All items are top quality and the staff is great.
2011-09-13,5,After a very busy and unsuccessful day looking for apartments in Hoboken, I needed to get a quick bite to eat.I stumbled upon this place and ordered the Soprano sandwich. This sandwich was awesome. Really good meat quality and the employees were very helpful.Great place.
2011-09-08,5,Vito's is amazing! Their fresh mutz is sooo good and comes on pretty much every sandwich on the menu. My fave is the chicken sorentino (grilled chicken, mutz, proscuit and eggplant), optional garlic spread is great on it. They have a bunch of different spreads to choose from, garlic, roasted red pepper, etc. Portions are big, I usually eat half and save half for later. They are super busy most Saturdays and Sundays from about 11am-3pm so try to call in your order if you can. Btw, recently I did this (rather than wait in the line that sometimes goes out the door) and when we picked up our order, both of our sandwiches were missing mutz : ( I called and they apologized immediately, I asked if they could just give me some mutz on the side and they said they would slice it up right then and I could pick up whenever. I live nearby and showed up in 5 min and it was all ready for me (huge portion), and they apologized again. Considering how crazy busy they are on weekends it was forgiveable and they handled it nicely.
2011-08-15,4,My cousin found this place on yelp. what a find!! We shared two different sandwiches. (def  had left overs) They were both delicious! The mutz was the freshest I have tasted in the area. The only semi complaint was the bread was a little harder than I like it.Def recommend this place and you must have some mutz!!!
2011-06-12,5,It is easy for me to give Vito's 5 stars.  This is by far my favorite Italian deli in Hoboken.  I usually get the same thing: turkey, pepperoni, mutz with the works.  It has the perfect amount of everything.  The Italian bread is amazing.  The mutz is delicious and I think it trumps Fiore's.  I know, I know...most people don't agree with me.  I just like it better.  I have not had the hot roast beef and mutz in order to compare that with Fiore's, but friends of mine think Fiore's beat Vito's on that sammie.  But for a regular sub, Vito's it is!
2011-06-08,4,Excellent sandwiches and mozzarella.  I have been here a number of time, my only small complaint is that they're a little on the pricey side with a sandwich approaching $10.
2011-06-06,5,The Vito Hoagie and The Italian Cuban Panini- both are absolutely fantastic.Seriously some of the best sandwiches I've ever had.
2011-06-05,4,Outstanding. I haven't gone to another Deli in Hoboken in 12 years. Not because the other ones are bad, but because this one is so good. Be sure to give a tip (just a buck) after you get your order. These dudes deserve it!
2011-03-15,5,Love this place!The fresh Mutz here is the best. I usually try to get something off the specials menu, but everything is awesome.The sandwiches are huge. You could easily split one or save half for later.
2011-03-01,5,I can go 5 stars on this pretty easily.  Mainly if I'm going to rank it against other delis in the tri state area, it will win overall. This place makes the sandwich perfectly.  They actually understand to not cut the bread all the way through, so when you eat it doesn't spill out the sides.  There isn't anything overly creative here but the ingredients are first rate and the execution is perfect of how a sandwich is made.Otherwise what can I say?  First rate mutz, prompt service, and delicious food.  My recommendations are this:The Vito, which is their Italian combo basically is legit top to bottom.  The fact that they default to mozz in the sandwich shows you they know whats up.  If I go to a deli in NYC they put thick sliced American cheese in a sub...gross.  This place drizzles it with oil and vinegar and also uses lettuce that went through the meat slicer so its all stringy and crunchy.  I always hate eating a sandwich and the entire lettuce piece falls out.  You can eat this while driving and texting and somehow not get messy.My custom, you can steal itChicken cutlet sandwich with provolone, balsamic glaze, bruschetta and lettuce.  Unreal, and their meat is tender and perfect.  Why cant my cutlets taste like that?!their Muzz and roast beef is good but Fiores is better, no hate, but Fiores is some freak invention of food that I can't explain unless you eat it.  I think the mozz is just milker and the meat more tender..BUT the Vito's roast beef still trumps 99% of other establishments Ive been to in the area.  So that's a nice way of saying 2nd best.
2011-01-15,5,This place makes the best grinder in the world.  The mozzarella and prosciutto sandwich is the best.  A must stop.
2011-01-12,4,VERY good deli but you cannot compare this place with Fiore's Deli on Adams Street. Walk or drive the extra few blocks off Washington Street and go to Fiore's - one of the best sandwiches in all of NJ.
2011-01-04,4,This place is so much more than just a deli. But seriously, these sandwiches are awesome! The mozzarella is amazing and they cut thick slices on your sandwiches. The sub prices are very reasonable. Haven't been to all the Hoboken Delis but this one is def one of my favs.
2010-10-29,5,GREAT STUFF!!Ordered a SIGMA sandwich yesterday.  It was pretty damn delicious.  Everything about it was perfect - the amount of meat, cheese, peppers, and seasoning... FANTASTIC!  It was pricey (a $10 sandwich) but completely worth the splurge for lunch.  I'd totally recommend this place to fellow Hoboken-ers with an appetite.Try it out if your ever in the area - you'll walk away happy (and full)
2010-10-26,5,Before Vito's, I had no idea sandwiches could taste this good. Ordered a Vito's Hero and had my socks knocked off.  The combination of fresh mutz, sweet peppers, fresh bread, lettuce, tomatoes, and meat melded into the perfect symphony in my mouth. And as much as I wanted to eat more, I could only finish half of the sandwich. For the amount of deliciousness you get, the prices are more than reasonable. But now, life after Vito's is hard. I don't know if I can ever look at other sandwiches the same way again. Vito's, you'll always be in my tastebuds.
2010-09-22,5,Good price, good food, good deli.This is our go-to stop before Jets/Giants games to grab a bite.  The food is always fresh and made to order.  Good pricing seals the deal.  Can't really beat this deli in Hoboken.
2010-05-30,5,Thanks to my fellow yelpers, I gave Vito's a try today for lunch.It was better than I imagined.I've had Fiore's before and that was delicious... but Vito's would be my #1  pick between those two. I had the "Vito Hero" with hot peppers and it was a burst of deliciousness in my mouth. I think they are reasonably priced... it's a big sandwich, they don't skimp out on the meet or "mutz"... so no one should be complaining about their prices. The service was, helpful, and friendly. We enjoyed sitting outside, eating our hero's under red umbrellas. The outdoor area is really nice, wouldn't expect a deli to have seating so that's definitely a plus! Can't wait to go back!
2010-05-18,2,Ordered fresh mozzarella with tomato, and Italian (vito's sub) sandwich. The mozzarella has to be made there, but I expected more- felt like I got if from a supermarket and it was too mushy.  it was so expensive too. They charge by the pound or something like that. The Italian sub was good, not too bad, but again, it was too expensive. I would only order a sandwich from them again, but will skip the appetizer.
2010-04-22,4,Without getting into too much detail, I had pick up 17 sandwiches for some very hungry people at Stevens Tech, and since this was the nearest of the old school Italian delis in Hoboken, I decided to come here.  The place looked like a modernized version of Fiore's, with a constantly long line to match.  The staff was very friendy and acccomodatin, and the sheer selection of items was second to none Although the sandwiches won acclaim from everyone who got one, I'll stick to commenting on what I got.I got a special with mixed grilled veggies (eggplant, red and yellow peppers, zucchini, and portobello mushroms), homemade mozzarella, tomato/lettuce/onion, garlic spread, and I also added some homemade roast beef.  The bread here was by far the best part, as it was delicious and perfect for a sandwich.  The mozzarella was great (not quite as good as Fiore, better than Lisa's), as was the roast beef.  The veggies could've been better however, as the grilled gave them a generic smoky flavor which obscured their normal flavors.  Also, they went light on the veggies, as I also saw with one order I placed for a regular veggie special.  This was a great sandwich, and while its not the best I've had even in Hoboken, it is definitely worth a special detour.
2010-04-06,5,I have been a customer at Vito's for about 16 years. One of the best Italian delis in Hoboken. Friendly service from a dedicated staff of employees, or even Vito himself, there to assist with every need. I'm a huge fan of their London Broil with mozzarella. Also can't get enough of the tricolored tortellini pasta salad. The "Vito Hero" is a must try for any new customer, a classic Italian hero, with Vito's signature homemade mozzarella ("mutz!") and on a classic Hoboken fresh roll. Only downside is that Vito's can get VERY busy on the weekends, and there can be lines out of the door during the lunch rush on Saturdays or Sundays. If you have a large order, you can always call ahead or have them deliver. I have found that the delivery can take 45 minutes to an hour, but it is often worth the wait.
2010-03-14,4,AMAZING FOOD+ GREAT PRICE= AMAZING and a painfull wait! This place is so good it had a line out the door almost every hour on the weekend. This place is really amazing, homemade "mutz" (fresh mozzarella the real way it should be made), quality deli meat, bread, and italian grocery. I have a slice and bennys before going out, and then a sandwhich from Vitos the day after. It always works well.... the only thing that doesn't is the line. All good things come to those who wait, especially behind a yenta with a huge bedazzled bag that hits you in the nuts everytime the line moves. Gotta get that pastrami!
2010-02-21,5,What can you say the lunch in Washington street. The vito's with sweet peppers is my fav.  Try the different spreads well worth every bite.  Oh one last thing I tend to get a salad with my lunch.  The pasta salad and the marinated mushrooms are great.  If there is a line don't worry it's worth the wait.
2010-02-16,5,I've only really had one sandwich here: "the Sopranos" and it is the best deli sandwich i've ever had... the mutz, the cold cuts and amazing garlic paste used is soooooooooooooo.... GOOD.
2010-02-09,5,Hands down the best subs I have ever come across! Their fresh mozzarella is outstanding, the service is good and the prices are very reasonable!
2010-01-12,5,This place makes me proud to be Italian. Best cold sandwiches in Hoboken. Great bread and tasty Italian imports. Was my primary supplier for Nutella during my college years. Go Stevens!!!
2009-12-20,4,Over this weekend, we used Vito's to cater a 100 person party we had at the Elks Lodge.  Over the course of working out the catering menu, down to the food delivery and deposit return, was handled expertly.The staff was attentive when working out the menu with us and the food was excellent and received great responses from the party goers.  Delivery was right on time, and even though it was delivered during the active party we didn't even notice the staff going about their job of placing the trays and lighting the sterno.We will definitely use them again.
2009-10-17,5,Fantastic sandwiches, amazing fresh mozarella.  Make sure you get there before football starts on Sunday's -- Vito's closes so the crew can catch the games.  A great neighborhood touch, if slightly inconvenient.
2009-09-13,3,I understand why everyone loves Vito's but the fact is that it's overpriced when compared to the other italian deli options in Hoboken (Fiore's, Lisa's, Luca Brasi's).I thought my chicken with Mozz (Mozz is better than Luca's but not Fiore's or Lisa's) and spinach was good, but 9.95 for a half sandwich is retarded. Will give them credit that they have the most creative menu of all the delis I've been in around Hoboken, but the prices are still too high.
2009-07-31,5,I must have had Vito's everyday for most of my senior year of college. You can't find a deli like this anywhere else! they have an amazing roasted pepper spread that's great on any sandwich. this place is by far way better than the other deli's in the area.Also, the staff there is great! and try to get there before or after the lunch hour bc I've seen the line out the door on several occasions!
2009-03-18,3,First things first: I came here for the free mozz did not bother with their fancy sandwiches etc. Bottom line: Fiore's is better. Much better.
2009-03-08,5,Authentic and good! I went here a couple times to get a lunch sandwich. The roll couldn't contain the moz and roast beef. I think I ended up eating the second half for dinner. I'm not sure whether I like Vito's or Fiore's better.
2009-03-08,4,like I said I  was coming back ..after a sat night in midtown I stopped by vito's w/ a couple of friends and grab a proper breakfast. The line was long as we stood behind a young man with the hairiest neck i ever saw dressed up like a leprechaun and an old italian gentleman w/ the hairest earlobes I ever saw purchase 140 dollars worth of mutz and subs. The long wait was worth it though b/c I am proclaiming Vito's as having the best chicken cutlet sandwich eva.
2009-03-02,4,Mmm...meat.Though Peter D graciously blessed us with tickets for the NY Wine Expo last Sunday, I was a bit concerned about the following equation; noontime drinking + empty stomachs = bad math.However, right before entering, my own Peter whispers seductively in my ear, "I've got something for you, baby." And with a flick of his wrist, he spun me around the main floor of the Javitz center, threw me down on a bench, looked me dead in the eye, and growled, "D'ya think you can handle it? I know that this is your first time"At this point, I got *really* nervous, because he was standing up, while I was sitting, and in this position, the first thing that came to my mind were the many talents of Bella Donna and the subsequent misdemeanor we'd receive for committing an inappropriate act in public...on a Sunday afternoon, no less.But sensing my anticipation, he subtly gestured towards the bag in his hand.  And with every heaving exhalation of my chest, slowly my love pulled out...12...inches...of pure, Italian meat.It was a hoagie from Vito's. Two, to be exact; The Original was virginal and innocent, overflowing with succulent ham, tangy salami, creamy *HOMEMADE* mutz (Jersey speak for mozzarella), fresh lettuce and tomato, yet dripping with fresh extra virgin olive oil and briny vinegar, oregano, and pickled sweet peppers. However, the Soprano went downright 'Dirty Jerzey' on my taste buds; violating it with tender ham, spicy cappicola, and the same creamy *HOMEMADE* mutz from the Original, but when combined with the peppery homemade garlic spread and sweet peppers on the crusty Italian bread :::eyelids flutter::: My GAWD it is good.Because he believes in mutual pleasure, we devoured 6 inches of each respective sub, while masticating side by side and moaning loudly "This is *SO* good!"I've never been so satisfied and so full...from a sandwich.*Please note:* Vito's is not Quisnos, or Subway, or even old-school Blimpie's. This is food porn in the form of heros. And I've got a lifetime subscription.(This review is based solely on take-out, but you bests believe I'm stopping by during my next stay in the 'boken.)
2009-03-02,5,quick, awesome service, all the guys are hot there and there sandwiches are amazing! lol need i say more..
2009-02-24,5,Great sandwiches... possibly the best in Hoboken. If you go on a Sat morning, expect there to be a line - but it's worth the wait. Just about anything I've gotten there is simply great. Make sure to try their different spreads on the sandwiches. A little pricey compared to fast food options like Subway, but an excellent choice nonetheless.
2009-02-05,4,Great deli, fresh meat, and creative sandwiches. They pile the meat on high and it is extremely hard to finish even a half sandwich. The mozzarella is good, but nothing compared to Fiore's. Definitely an authentic, Italian deli except for the fact they call their Mozzarella "mutz" which absolutely drives my Italian roommate bonkers.
2008-08-31,5,My dear friend, Steven is a deli lover. He made me get a sandwich here because he said they had the best mozzarella in the tri-state area. There was a line going out the door when we got there, and the sandwiches are damn good.
2008-07-05,5,Vitos is everything you expect from a truly authentic Italian deli in Hoboken.  All of the meats are fresh, especially the prosciutto which just melts in your mouth.  Vitos is also known for their fresh mozzarella, which they commonly refer to as 'muzz'.  A great place to grab a sandwich (Italian combo, sausage and peppers, etc) or to just order some fresh meats and cheese.  My only gripe is that their not open very late.
2008-03-12,5,the guys who work here are happy and speedy and everything i imagine a "guido" to look like! haha! after a day at the pre-st paddys day celebration i took down a vito's special with hot peppers. buffalo mozzarella is sooooooo good. the bread is a bit  hard to eat on a bench on washington as everyone who walked by watched me unsuccessfully bite into it. softer rolls would make this sammich just that much better. but until then ill settle for the hard roll.they close early and have random hours. so make sure you get there in time to feed your need.
