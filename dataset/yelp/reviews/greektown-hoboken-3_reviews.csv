2021-08-11,3,Great service. Average food. First time there, so will give it another try but the Gyro meat was pretty dry and not very tasty.
2021-08-03,5,Delicious! Best Greek food in Hoboken. And hugeeee portions for the price. Would definitely recommend :)
2021-07-22,5,Greek town is honestly one of the best Greek food places in nj. We go into Hoboken specifically for Greek town and we are never disappointed!
2021-06-23,3,Yeero sandwich was delicious. Really nice staff. Place smelled like burnt oil. AC was not on blast for a day where it was 90+ outside. The grilled calamari was undercooked and no flavor. It might have just been bought frozen and put on the grill.Greek salad was good but way too much tomato and not enough red onions. Maybe they're catering to the clientele. Overall? If I ever crave a yeero, that's my spot.
2021-06-07,4,Solid spot for Greek food. We usually order via Uber Eats (yeah yeah I know....we'd go pick up but are all the way uptown). My husband and I always get the Greek Combo which comes with a ton of proteins, salad, pita, tzatziki and fries. It is literally three meals and is the best deal on the menu. If you haven't been to Greektown, put it on your list!
2021-05-15,4,We were craving Greek food last weekend and honestly just did not want to cook. We placed an order roughly around 6pm on a Sunday and were quoted an hour wait via UberEats. It ended up being roughly around 35 minutes, so win for us. I had the lamb pita and X had the mixed beef and lamb yeero. I think my lamb pita was the better of the two because the lamb kabob was super moist and tender. The combo yeero needed more tzatziki - I recommend ordering some more on the side if you're a big tzatziki fan. We also split the spicy feta dip, which came with some pita on the side. Amazing - not too spicy and a great snack for later in the week.
2021-05-12,4,Probably the best hummus I've ever had.  Whipped and fresh.  The tzatziki was also very good.  Thick with fresh cucumbers.   I always enjoy the Greektown chips which is fried zucchini and eggplants and my friends usually order the chicken yeero.   I left off one star bc if you order fries with your order, it's $6.00!
2021-05-08,5,Ordered delivery from here a few times in the past couple months.  This place feels under the radar.  Salads have always been very fresh and tasty.  Portions for entrees are large.
2021-04-24,4,Great food and good portions. Got an always packed gyro and greek fries. Fast, hot and tasty. Only issue is just a lil bit pricey. One of my favorite hoboken eateries
2021-04-24,5,Ordered for lunch yesterday through Uber eats. I got a lamb gyro and an avgolemono. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! Fresh & authentic. Will be ordering again
2021-03-25,4,Got Uber eats delivery and the food arrived pretty quickly!  Uber eats was really expensive though so I wouldn't recommend that delivery!Greek Salad - was good!  I just wish I got another grape leaf.  They give you one and it was cut in half.  The dressing mixed in was good.Chicken Kebab Platter - very large portion!  The chicken was really good and the rice had a lot of flavor.  They also give a large pita to go with it.  Under the pita was tomato and red onion slices.  I wish they didn't charge the $1 for tzaziki sauce, but it is what it is.Grilled seafood - the salmon and shrimp were my favorite!  Large portion as well!
2021-03-25,4,Ordered some food for takeout on a Wednesday night with friends. We all ordered yeero's. The order was ready at the time that was estimated and the food was packaged well, in individual plastic containers. We all enjoyed the yeeros, which came with tomato and red onion. The tzatziki sauce was sort of like a thick spread rather than than a thin sauce like I am used to. But it tasted the same as other spots. The tzatziki sauce came on the pita but I wish there was more of it, or even wish that some extra was included on the side. I will ask for extra sauce on side next time. I also wish that some greens were included in the yeero (like cucumber)Overall, it was an enjoyable dinner. Wish there was more sauce included but I will ask for extra next time!
2021-03-20,5,Amazing food. They closed for a month due to a small fire and I literally called every day to see if they re-opened. I even left a voicemail asking if they could call me to let me know once they got back up and running (they didn't- but they were most likely busy lol). Spicy feta dip, zucchini and eggplant chips with taziki (best I've ever had), and their lemon chicken soup are my favorites!
2021-03-18,2,Not a fan! We ordered takeout the first time and I was really craving a gyro which is why we ordered from greek town. We ordered:1. The greektown gyro 2. Hummus3. FelafelI specifically asked for it to be spicy but there was no flavor at all. Everything was so bland. Didn't satisfy any of my cravings unfortunately!
2021-03-11,1,I would've like to give this place a better review although when I went in there I was the only customer I was easily attended to but my food was cold not even lukewarm but cold they did not reheat or cut my meat fresh they took it out of metal tin used for storing food so I did not have a good eating experience the over all establishment was clean Everyone wore a mask but I was not satisfied with the food I couldn't get the true taste because my food was not made fresh and I would've like that my food been made fresh since that was the first time I ever dined there and I explain that to the young woman that was working the register all I had was a simple Gyro nothing extra some things as simple as a-year-old that could've been me quickly which it was made quick just not fresh
2021-02-24,5,I love greek food and this place did not disappoint. I wasnt sure what to expect since the food is priced exceptionally well and the inside of the restaurant is pretty bare bones appearance wise (definitely because of COVID, but hey we eat with our eyes first right?), but I was pleasantly surprised! I had the garden street pita ($10) which came with grilled chicken, lettuce tomato onions and feta. Grilled chicken was delicious, veggies fresh, pita soft, and feta was very nice quality. Also, this is a big sandwich! I had skipped lunch and was starving and still couldnt finish it. You could definitely split this with someone plus a shared side/appetizer and be satisfied. Speaking of add ons, i split the greektown chips with my friend, which is fried zuchinni and eggplant, also very delicious. And the tzatiki was super yum too! Definitely would recommend this place to all lovers of greek food.
2021-02-20,5,Amazing. Had the Greektown Chicken Yeero. It was fantastic. It has fries in it and it makes it amazing. Like a fat sandwich. Highly recommend.
2021-02-12,4,We've been ordering from here since we moved to Hoboken and the service and food has always been consistently delish and great, up until our order yesterday which was delivered on time but the gyros were missing the tzatziki (a main ingredient) which made them dry and the gyro meat was so burnt parts of it had to be picked out of the pita. Hoping this was a rare fluke because we love ordering from here regularly.
2021-01-23,5,Absolutely delicious Greek food! Delivery quality is consistently great and fast. Their salads with a meat are a bit pricy, but definitely worth it and a very good size portion - highly recommend the chicken shawarma. Gyro's, fries, hummus, spicy feta dip, and tzatziki are also incredible.
2021-01-19,5,This place is awesome. I can't believe in all the years I have lived in Hoboken I have never tried this place. I recently stopped in to grab a quick lunch. I shared the Greek fries with my boyfriend and we each ordered the Garden Street Pita. The fries were great. They were not too overpowered by the seasoning. The Pita was delish! The ingredients were so fresh and the grilled chicken on the inside was so tender and juicy. I also ordered a side of tzatziki sauce which by the way is amazing!!We are definitely going back and I can't wait to try more items on the menu. The restaurant employees are very careful and wiped everything down. I felt like it was clean and a safe place to dine.
2021-01-14,5,Delicious greek salad with chicken, and kind service to boot! Absolutely loved it.
2020-11-20,5,The falafel pita is to die for. The prices are good, the food is great! This is my go to neighborhood takeout lunch spot.
2020-11-10,5,So happy my favorite gyro place is back open! Been back 3 times already since they opened! Once to dine-in and twice to-go. The gyros are even better than before and bigger! The taziki sauce is so good I had to order extra! The owner Kat is so sweet and her Dad is the chef and her mom is the waitress! Everything my family and I ordered was so delicious and generous portions and priced just right! Definitely try the rice pudding for dessert. So glad they reopened!
2020-10-26,5,Love this place! I am Greek and this is the closest gyro to the original Greek hero. Very fresh and light with lots of flavor! Always a good choice!
2020-10-17,5,This is my FAVORITE! I never think twice about ordering from them because it's ALWAYS GOOD! They are my go to and I would recommend to anyone confidently!
2020-10-06,1,Food is good, although the appetizers are small and overpriced. Food was 45 mins later than scheduled. Called the restaurant said the driver would be there in five minutes. Driver called ten minutes later saying he was caught in traffic, even though the restaurant is a mile away and he was on an e-bike, hmmm. Don't want to put my faith in the quality of a restaurant that lies to me. Driver shows up with cold food, doesn't say hello, have a nice night (despite me saying it to him), or apologize for the delay. Suffice to say, they won't be getting orders from me anytime soon!
2020-10-01,5,Really good food, quick and reliable service. Highly recommend! Gyro is a must
2020-09-26,5,Every time we have gone to this place, it's been absolutely amazing. Everything on the menu is delicious. The staff is so kind and accommodating. Best Mediterranean food in Hoboken.
2020-09-10,5,This spot serves up tasty take out in a hurry.My gal & I were hangry on an recent Saturday afternoon.We're both into good quality food, just tasty doesn't do it.  Healthy, nutritious & satisfying is what we want.This place checks all the boxes.We went with the quinoa bowl w/grilled chicken & the Greek pita wrap with ... you guessed it, cluck cluck.  The grilled chicken is juicy & cooked just right.A nice surprise, fresh hunks of shredded cucumber mixed into the greens on some of the best pita in town. We'll be back!
2020-08-26,4,Ordered takeout on a Wednesday afternoon. I got a yeero sandwich. Everything was delicious and fresh, however I wouldn't say it's the best gyro I've had in my life. The pita was soft and not too dense. There was minimal veggies so if you're a big meat eater this sandwich might be perfect for you. Personally I would've preferred a bit more tomatoes and red onions. It felt like I was just eating bread and meat. Also I felt like they skimped in the tzatziki sauce on the gyro. There was a very thin layer at the bottom of the gyro. I ordered extra sauce and it came in a small condiment container but it still wasn't enough for my liking. The order was prepared quickly and promptly. Upon arriving it looked like there were a lot of pick up orders. Everyone in the establishment was wearing masks. Outdoor tables appear to be properly spaced.
2020-07-19,1,Greek is my favorite food. Given the fact that they are the only Greek restaurant in town I always give them "a last chance". They never cease to fail me. I have gotten stones on the lentil soup, dressing when I asked for dry, fries inside my yeero because they were short, cold yeeros and raw chicken on the breaded chicken. Today was officially their final chance. I got my three year old a chicken yeero and it was pink and my yeero had chunks and liquid dripping that I hope was tzatziki. Ultimately THE worst ever. I have had greek in Greece, Astoria everywhere even in Vegas and nothing has ever been remotely this awful. So disappointed!
2020-07-07,5,Hidden gem in Hoboken! I moved to Jersey City and still order from here. I must say the prices are a little bit on the expensive side but it is worth it considering the amount of food you get. I've tried a good amount of items on their menu and everything is always delicious!
2020-06-25,4,Ordered the Gyro with fries. Gyro meat tasted great and had a very nice crisp to it. Tzatziki tasted good but was a little thick. Wished it was creamier. Overall very good!!
2020-06-16,4,Hidden gem in downtown Hoboken. The food here is great. I've tried the chicken, lamb and yeero and all of them are delicious. My go to is the lamb pita. It's BYO if you decide to dine in, but service is a little slow in my opinion. It's better to just grab takeout from here.
2020-06-12,5,Great Greek salad. Have gotten take out a few times during quarantine. Fresh, hot and good!
2020-05-27,5,One of my favorite restaurants in the world!!! Nice and casual with the most incredible food and awesome portions. May seems expensive for a moment but a meal lasts me 2-3 meals in leftovers always. Takeout is great and always fresh and i love eating here in person as well. One of the most low key GEMS in Hoboken.
2020-05-16,5,Manny was the best! Great customer service. He helped me out as much as he could ! Manny is great. Thanks so much!
2020-05-08,4,Good food, quick service. I got a gyro which was good but a little bit dry- not enough sauce/inside meat- too much pita. My combination platter was also really good. And I love their salad!
2020-04-21,2,Recent downturn in food quality and increase in prices.Last time I got a gyro the kitchen had clearly ran out of meat and tried to hide it by stuffing my gyro with tomatoes and half of an uncut union! Gross. There was no more than 2 pieces of meat on it for $11. For the price it was also small and the bread was stale.Used to be a great spot. Gyros were delicious, fresh and fairly priced.Now this place is over priced and over rated. $11 GYROS?! $8 Fries!? $20 GYRO Plate?! You're on a side street in Hoboken not midtown.
2020-03-29,5,Excellent Greek Food! I have never even at the restaurant but the delivery is always quick and still warm. The Greek salad is delicious as is the yeero hero. I probably order almost once a week! Love this place!
2020-01-27,1,Baffled by the reviews on this place. Maybe they had an off night but over an hour for delivery on a Monday (I live .7 miles from this place) and food showed up stone cold. Pita and fries were soggy, chicken is completely cold. I could maybe look past this if it didn't cost $50 for 2 platters but really the grilled chicken platter is just pathetic. We'll go with Mamoun's next time, at least it'll be half the price.
2020-01-14,5,I just moved to Hoboken a few months ago and this is hands down my new favorite spot! Not only is the price good, but the food is OUTSTANDING. I have enough food for two more meals and only ordered two dishes. They have made a permanent customer out of me and I'm excited to share my love for their food with everyone!
2020-01-12,2,We got Greektown delivered tonight and it was TERRIBLE. The food was cold (and yes we can blame Grubhub for that) but it was also a completely messed up order (no tomatoes or onions on our yeeros), literally 5 fries in all FOUR orders, NO tzatziki sauce on any of the yeeros - so disappointing. This used to be a fave of mine and I def won't be coming back.
2020-01-11,3,ooooppppaaaaa!!!!!! What a place for a birthday party!!!!!! Came here with 30 people for my friends birthday. Not many places in the boken can accomodate this crowd but they did. BYO and huge portions!! Win win! Recommending the platter for two. Stay away from salmon it was dry however rice was very good. If you need a light bite go for one of the many salads with shrimp! Shrimp so tender and good melted in my mouth YUM!
2019-12-28,5,Excellent authentic Greek food!We're Israelis, so we know good Greek food when we taste it! GreekTown has authentic flavorful fresh food, we loved it and will DEFINITELY come back.We also loved the authentic vibe in the restaurant - the Greek music in the background and the pictures of Greece on the walls.
2019-12-23,5,Love the food at Greektown. Best authentic Greek food in Hoboken/jersey city. We've gone there a few times with big parties (7+ people) and they are very accommodating.
2019-12-19,2,Pretty disappointed in this place right now.  Have ordered from here before and the food was pretty good.  It's unfortunate that they took my delivery order and then 25minutes after the estimated delivery time they called to say that they were running very late and the driver would be in touch in a couple of minutes.  They closed the restaurant at that point and then failed to deliver the food or call me back at all.  Left a really bad taste in my mouth, especially since they knew we were waiting for the food and just left us hanging. Really a shame.
2019-12-19,5,Greek town delivery Gyro platter is great . The platter is pricey but totally worth it, my finance and I actually split the platter and are full. The lamb is thinly sliced and cooked perfectly. Comes with rice, tomatoes and onions, and a side salad. Great dinner delivery, definitely recommend this spot!
2019-12-12,4,My favorite place in Hoboken for a fresh Greek salad with grilled chicken. You can tell the chicken is made to order- it is never chewy!!!! I love the Greektown chips and soup too!!!
2019-12-12,2,This place used to be better, but it's been very disappointing the last 5 or 6 times I've been here.  I live nearby, which is why I would go to a place that I'm not thrilled with so many times.  The food is ok, but inconsistent.  The service has been pretty poor, though.  I no longer go here nearly as frequently as I used to.  I hope they improve because it's the only Greek restaurant within a few blocks of my apartment and I generally like Greek food.  Considering it's been poor quality consistently for many months now, I'm not confident they will improve.  Any improvement needs to start with some turnover of their staff.  If someone comes into a restaurant and the staff is annoyed because a customer has the nerve to interrupt their time staring at their phone, they shouldn't be working in this industry.
2019-11-07,5,Definitely a hidden gem! All of our food and appetizers were delicious. Six of us at the table;  everybody was happy! A nice BYOB option. Our waiter, Christian, was attentive and friendly,  knowledgeable, courteous and efficient. We couldn't help but give him a very good tip! :)A nice neighborhood, friendly atmosphere and easy to walk from PATH. The food was authentic  and the portions were very big. Most of us brought food home. I highly recommend it.
2019-10-15,5,I cannot wait to come back here! The portions are large, the food is delicious and the service is great. The grilled octopus was so flavorful, lemony and fresh and the Greek salad makes you fall in love with salad all over again. You will leave here well fed and craving Greektown all week! Best of all this place is BYOB :)
2019-09-28,4,It's a hidden gem by Garden and Newark. All the gyros are amazing and it's a BYOB too.
2019-09-22,1,Just painfully bad service. We've ordered a few times from them. We consistently have issues with getting the order correct and delivery time. This time, when I asked for no onions in the salad, they must have misread and put extra onions because that is what I got. We ordered Greek fries and they weren't even included. The best part is we placed the order at 7pm and had it delivered by 9pm even though their posted delivery times are 35-55 minutes. I can't wait to find another option for Greek food in Jersey City/Hoboken.
2019-09-19,4,I always order the lamb kabob in pita. The food is really good, but watch out for the slow service
2019-08-26,4,Delivery arrived faster than estimated! Love it! I ordered the Yeero Lunch $11.95 and spinach and artichoke dip $8. Delivery man was nice. The Yeero lunch comes with fries. The fries are not crispy. They do have seasoning that's good, oregano. The Yeero is a gyro and it's delicious. Great portion size for lunch! I didn't even need to get the dip. Very filling. Fresh onion and tomato. The tzatziki sauce is delicious, wish there was more! I would definitely order the Yeero again. The spinach artichoke dip I would not order again. It wasn't really a dip. I couldn't dip the pita bread in it. I used the spoon and spooned it into the pita bread and just ate it like a burrito. More spinach than artichoke. Not for me! I've had better. I'd try something else on the menu next time. Great quality of food. I'm satisfied.
2019-07-29,5,I love this place. It's BYOB, but there is liquor store right across the street. The atmosphere is great, and their service is on point. The food was very good! I'll definitely go back.
2019-07-14,5,Fuqqqqqqqq meeeeeee uppppppp. This place omfg. I got take out after climbing because you know like healthy and whatever. Normally I don't touch pita from Greek places because it's store bought nonsense. The PITA HERE IS LITTY AF. Tbh I could have had an entire meal with just the pita. Carb life is the best life. But the octopus was also phenomenal. Very tasty. Worth the price tag. The grilled chicken entree was typical Greek chicken. Aka slightly overcooked but seasoned well. Also they gave a cup of Tzatiki without making a big deal about it like every other Greek place. So I didnt have to destroy their life. Good people. Great food. Will come again
2019-07-09,2,How does this place have 4 stars? Mediocre at best. Spanakopita wasn't flaky, gyro meat was blah. Super super average there are such better Greek places.
2019-07-02,4,Adding to my go-to rotation.  Good food, on Seamless, and is BYOB.  Only reason not 5 starts is I think the prices for the entrees are little high, but I'll admit you get good amount of food with it.  Check it out.
2019-06-13,4,Greektown is the only classic Greek restaurant in all of Jersey City and Hoboken (at least that I know of?). I finally got to stop in the other day and am happy to report that it's pretty damn tasty. The spinach and feta stuffed crispy chicken is phenomenal. The dish is a little pricy ($18) but can easily feed two people. It comes with two large golden fried chicken cutlets with a thick layer of spinach and feta in between and is topped with yet even more feta. The dish also comes with a large side of fries. Pro tip - order an extra side of tzatziki for dipping action. I also tried the classic gyro which was just okay, a little underwhelming if I'm being honest. The meat just didn't feel super quality. The last time I had a gyro I think I was in Greece, so I honestly shouldn't be comparing. All of the pita was fresh and soft baked. The pita wrapped around the gyro and the pita served with hummus were fantastic, as was the hummus which was smooth and creamy.The menu features all of the classic Greek restaurant staples and runs the gamut from salads to dips to gyros and kabobs. All topped with feta and tzatziki, of course.Byob with a liquor store across the street. Grab a bottle of your favorite and be sure to try if you are a Greek food fan.
2019-06-11,5,My husband and I truly enjoyed our meal. The price for the quality was awesome. Service was excellent, and the liquor store across the street had great prices on our lovely Prosecco and Pinot Grigio because this place is BYOB. The most tasty salad -- just like at home! And the quantities were copious. The best thing about the meal though was the baklava -- absolutely delicious, clearly made recently by talented human hands.
2019-05-31,4,Wow is all I have to say. Satisfied everything I was looking for in a Greek salad with chicken. Good price on lunch special of around $11.70. Will definitely be back. And it's a huge portion. So yea I ate a salad for lunch, but now I'm stuffed to the brim. Highly recommend. Excited to try the yeero next
2019-05-30,4,Quick and healthy for the area. Service is nice and friendly. Wait for food was about 10min, which is pretty reasonable.
2019-05-20,5,The Best foood in town!!! i come here 2-3 times a week ! food is amazing ! portions are insane ! quality fresh food EVERY TIME I VISIT THE GREEKTWON!! i will say this loudly this is the best restaurant in hoboken! service is always outstanding! food good as it's can get !!

Thank you Greektown for amazing outstanding Food and service!Grilled chicken platter is my favorite! comes with salad and french fries  ! and Yes the dessert BAKHLAVA OMG !!! just OMG !!!
2019-05-11,5,Attentive and fresh Greek food!Portions are large and delicious. Me and my wife forth 2 appetizers and 2 plates. Which we ended up taking home and resting for next 2 days The place is BYOB and a liquor store is conveniently located across the street making this spot a great for dates or friend get togethers.Service was quick and attentive.Overall we would be coming back here.
2019-04-24,5,Fresh, delicious food. Lots of options on the menu. Many healthy options which is good. The portions are big, which means left overs. :-) There is outdoor seating available for nice days and the staff is friendly.
2019-04-17,5,Great restaurant delicious Greek salad and chicken soup was so good. Nice quiet spot for lunch or dinner. Byob and a nice staff
2019-04-15,5,Outstanding Greek restaurant, quick service, smiling staff. Excellent menu, made fresh and fast if you're ordering to go. Great seats by the windows for people watching, easy spot to dine alone or with a group. Highly recommended local spot on the corner of Garden and Newark, one block away from Washington.
2019-04-14,5,Had am amazing meal at Greektown.. we eat here often Hamida is the best ..always has a wonderful smile.. we are always happy when she is serving us..
2019-04-13,2,Food was sub par and underwhelming. The service was absolutely HORRIBLE. The whole experience was beyond frustrating. Came here on a Saturday night around 8pm for dinner and they had one server for the entire restaurant. Took forever to just get some waters for the table. I asked for lemon for my water and the server never brought it so I had to ask again 20 mins later because that's how long it took to get her attention. We ordered a Greek salad and octopus for appetizers that took almost a half hour to come out. The octopus was completely flavorless and dry. For $15 they charge for octopus it better be on point. The Greek salad also states that it comes with "grape leaves" however when we received it there was only one grape leaf in the entire salad! The salad was pretty flavorless as well. Probably the worst appetizers we've had in a Greek restaurant. We each got a gyro for our main dish and they were alright but not impressive. The gyros also don't come with a side of fries which I thought was unusual. Finally I had to get up and ask for the bill because our server barely checked in with us. Main point- save your time and money there's MUCH better Greek out there.
2019-04-05,5,I love Greektown. The gyros are always delicious, the Greek salad is always fresh, and the spicy feta dip is one of my favorites. Every time I order from them they are always here in half the expected delivery time and the food is always hot. Not to mention they are very generous with the pita and it's always toasted and delicious.
2019-03-24,5,I always order Greektown for delivery. When I'm in the mood to eat a healthy and filling meal I always order from here.  I get the Greek Salad with shrimp and it's perfect for a healthy and light lunch/dinner, I used to get it with chicken but I found the chicken is sometimes a bit dry. The shrimp is the perfect size and is seasoned well, over chopped iceberg lettuce with feta, onion, tomato, olives and a very light lemon oil dressing. It comes with a two fresh hot pitas and I also get an order of the homemade hummus. I love it and would definitely recommend it especially to the fitness community!
2019-03-13,1,Found hair in my food & over charged for "salad" that doesn't have any lettuce. Very disappointed
2019-03-05,4,This place is always my go-to for Greek food. For my most recent visit, we tried the new dish, which the stuffed calamari that was stuffed with spinach and cheese. It reminded me of the spinach pie, instead of the crispy pastry shell, it was a tender squid. In addition, we also had the planter, which had the grill meats, pita with dip, salad, and fries. And of course, it was too much food for one meal. We were able to bring back the dinner for the next day.
2019-02-20,3,This place was great the first time I had it, but a bit of a letdown the second time. My food was supposed to include chicken and only one piece was provided. Also dressing/sauces are not included.
2019-02-03,1,Oh dear. A very unsatisfying meal in every respect. The lamb pita had 4 small pieces of flavorless lamb, each about half the size of my forefinger and it just looked empty inside the pita. The gyro with mixed lamb and beef contained quite a lot of meat but this had obviously been sliced off the rotisserie about an hour earlier and consequently the meat was extremely dry. The fried calamari was soggy and the hummus was very bland and tasteless. The Baklava didn't even look like Baklava so we left it alone. Dreadful food and we will not be ordering from here again.
2019-02-01,5,Hands down best Mediterranean in Hoboken.  Everything is fresh and delicious.  The pitas are AMAZING, not that store bought crap that some other unnamed Hoboken establishments use.  You will not be disappointed!
2019-01-03,4,Greektown is a great no frills restaurant off the beaten path of downtown hoboken.  Portions are gigantic and waitstaff is super friendly.   Things are a little underseasoned imo, but it's cooked to perfection (never overcooked).  Love that it's byob and there is a liquor store across the street.  It's pretty easy to get a table, so it's a good go to spot for the last minute/spontaneous dinner. The last time I came I ordered the octopus appetizer and grilled seafood entree and again, a little underseasoned but really nicely cooked - not chewy at all and nothing that some lemon and salt couldn't fix.  The stuffed chicken looked great from across the table - I heard that was seasoned nicely and tasted great, but i was not able to try.
2019-01-01,1,$17 for their kebab entree was a total ripoff. It was like 5 one inch pieces of chicken and a ton of rice. New Year's resolution is to get better value for my money. BYES!
2018-12-28,4,We ordered takeout and was VERY pleased. Our food said it would arrive in 65 minutes but instead came in 20!!!! That's a big deal in Hoboken. Our food was still hot and tasted great. It was our first time having Greektown but definitely won't be our last! Buffalo chicken Yeero and fried calamari tasted great!!!
2018-12-05,4,I have been obsessed with Greektown since they opened. Everything is fresh and delicious. I was in Greece this past summer for the first time and when I can back I realized how close to authentic their food is and made me love it even more. My only criticism is it can be a little pricey and sometimes their proteins are hit out miss; I love the Greektown chicken entree and sometimes the chicken not great (lots of fat/gristle). Def recommend this place, the tzatziki is AWESOME.
2018-12-03,5,Love this place! The only Greek restaurant in town, and we frequently order takeout. Delicious, fresh ingredients that never disappoint. So glad to have discovered this gem!
2018-10-08,4,I'm always in the mood for good Greek food and this place hit the spot! Decided to try somewhere other than our usual spots and ordered from delivery.com. I ordered to share with my husband the beef and lamb platter (which comes with a side salad)and also an order of spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer. The salad is large enough to share and was delicious! The dressing was nice and light and there was PLENTY of feta! The platter has pita, onions, tomato and a yogurt sauce. We were actually so full from the salad and platter that we ended up saving the artichoke dip to snack on later. The platter was so delicious I would highly recommend it to share. I only took away one star because the artichoke dip was $8. The portion I felt could have been larger (surprising as the platter is so filling) or priced lower.
2018-08-27,4,Very poor service. i regret giving the tip at all. i came in for lunch at 12:40. ordered to go food with my 13. m old baby. i am also 7 m pregnant. 40 min later- no food. they all went on break besides the server. i could see them chewing food, taking coke from the freezer but my food is still not ready. sorry guys, 1 star !
2018-08-26,5,DELICIOUS!!! I got the lamb gyro, Greek salad, and hummus. Best hummus and pita bread I've tried. The salad tasted super fresh!! Open on sundays. A block away from Washington street so easy to get to but I found parking right infront and it's busy inside. The waitress was also super nice and attentive. Kept making sure we were ok and asking if we needed anything. Highly recommend!
2018-08-18,5,Best Greek food in Hoboken! Been coming here for the past 2 years and am now a frequent customer. Their Greektown yeero is delicious and a must try. The service is always super friendly and the restaurant is spotless clean. This is a BYOB restaurant but there is a liquor store conveniently across the street.
2018-08-17,2,My fiancé and I love this place. And probably come/order at least twice a month. It's definitely pretty pricey (for a Greek salad with grilled calamari $18) but we keep coming back because the service is good and the portions are usually generous. However, the past few times both have been lacking. Still paying almost $20 a salad but literally getting 7 small pieces of calamari. Hoping for a new Greek place to open up and Soon. Service has clearly been lacking.
2018-08-17,5,Neighborhood place. Friendly staff. The grilled octopus is among the best we've ever had. Comes with red peppers that are tasty. Perfectly cooked and nicely seasoned. Also enjoyed the Pear salad. It had a very generous amount of pears. Falafel was good as well. We'll be coming back for the octopus.
2018-08-06,1,Absolutely terrible place from the food to the service, and I ordered take out. I order a lamb gyro, took over 20 minutes to make. When I finally got it, there were 3 pieces of meat the size of a quarter at best. I would not recommend this establishment, Malibu diner has better gyros and they aren't a speciality green restaurant. First time at GreekTown, and last time. Don't waste your money and most importantly your time.
2018-07-21,5,Nice place. Delicious grilled octopus and yeero chicken. Friendly waitress and service was very good.
2018-07-21,3,Ordered takeout lunch from here. We ordered a salad and a yeero. Salad was amazing, but the portion was SO SMALL and there was no option for a bigger portion. Would definitely order this again but probably in conjunction with something else. Yeero was very good and although we ordered extra tzatziki, it still could have used more. Fries were amazing and traveled really well. Would probably try out Greektown in person, to see if portions are more filling.
2018-07-17,5,Cute local spot with nice outdoor seating too. The Greektown chips appetizer is a must every time :)The more I come here the more I like it. It is pretty close to the path station and light rail for easy access. The Gyro platter's are really big portions and absolutely delicious, it is something I regularly crave. If you're looking for a smaller dinner or lunch, you can also get the Gyro in a pita which is smaller but still a good size. The french fries have such a good seasoning on them that really accentuates the flavor and makes them much better than any standard fry. They also have a fried cheese app that is so good! Also worth noting that Greektown is BYOB! There is a liquor store right across the street from them which is so convenient. Easy to have an affordable night out here.
2018-07-11,4,Our waitress was fantastic. Accommodating and friendly. Knowledgeable of the menu and gave great recommendations.My boyfriend and I ordered the Hummus (8) to start. Very creamy in texture and light. We got a very well size portion and asked for some pita to finish it all off.For dinner we ordered the Grilled Seafood (27) which came with salmon, calamari, shrimp and octopus served with rice and sautéed spinach. Delicious! This dish wasn't heavy. The sautéed spinach was mixed with tomato which was really tasty. The salmon was cooked perfectly. Melted right in my mouth. I heard the octopus was a seller as is (appetizer) and I can see why. Very good, grilled just right, not chewy or hard to eat at all. Shrimp was seasoned very well also.We ordered cappuccinos to go. I can't really review on it because it should be served in a mug but because we were on the go we ordered it in foam cups. Making the coffee experience less notable. Nonetheless our waitress, again, was very accommodating to us and even brought out cinnamon to top off our foam! :)My boyfriend and I enjoyed our experience and can't wait to go back for some gyros!
2018-06-24,1,The women on the phone was super friendly and helpful for my first time ordering and the food arrived right at the expected time BUT everything from there was downhill. I was surprised to see it cost $52 so I was hoping for some quality after that. We ordered a lamb platter. I asked for pita on the side and no onions. It had both inside the box. The lamb was cold and so chewy I couldn't eat some pieces. It also had no flavor so the pieces I did eat weren't enjoyable. The fries were decent but also cold and a little soggy. Salad was fine. NOT worth $19. Can get better quality for $10 elsewhere. Calamari was subpar. Lamb gyro was dry and the pita it was in wasn't soft. Will not order again, don't recommend. Biggest waste of $57 with the tip for the driver.
2018-06-20,5,This is the best spot for Greek food in Hoboken. My wife and I usually order or dine in here once every two weeks. The servers are very nice (and held onto our credit card when we left it once!). We get a good variety here - if you're in the mood for healthy: the salads have generous portions and great dressing- if you're feeling more indulgent: the french fries are nice and crispy here- if you're just snacking: the warm pita and dips are very tasty and satisfying- if you're on the go: get a gyro with the french fries inside (just like in Greece) and you have the perfect meal (meat and veggies too) wrapped in a single pita.The hardest part is trying new things on the menu because the things we have ordered previously (tzaziki, hummus, falafel, gyro, greek salad, greektown salad, gyro platters, rice, french fries, everything) is so good you want to go back for but your belly is too stuffed to cram anymore deliciousness down. Also, in the summer you can eat on the sidewalk, people watch and just grab drinks across the street and BYOB to the restaurant. The only thing better is being in actual Greece.
2018-03-14,4,Ordered delivery and was VERY impressed!! We ordered 3 gyro sandwiches which were delicious, even my husband liked them and he is hard to please when to comes to Greek food!The spinach pies were still warm and crispy not soggy at all, my mother and I thought it was fantastic! My mom got the Lemmon soup which she said was delicious and the FF were really good too!!Also would like to mention delivery was sent in a reasonable time (about an hour) for a Sunday night in Hoboken which is not bad but the impressive part was that everything was still hot and NOT soggy!! Well, FF were soggy but it's almost impossible to keep them crunchy when your getting delivery, I expected that and was totally fine with it! This is the first time I'm ordering from them which is why I only gave 4 starts but if we keep getting service like this we I will def increase to 5 stars!!
2018-03-12,5,I love this place. I order regularly (a couple of times a month since they have opened), and the food is consistently fresh, prepared well and delivered promptly. They have the best Greek salad in Hoboken, in my opinion. They have only messed up my order one time, and upon calling to inform them of the mistake I was quickly delivered a replacement salad with a free dessert AND a hand written apology note. Their customer service is excellent. I highly recommend GreekTown.
2018-03-11,5,Finally a good Greek restaurant in Hoboken! The food is fantastic, the service is great...I've been tons of times and it has never disappointment. Highly recommend!
2018-03-01,5,Much healthier option than most restaurants in Hoboken.  Plus the food is mostly pretty good. Most of the entree dishes are good.
2018-02-25,2,My go-to is "It's Greek to Me" in Hoboken. This place get's better reviews so decided to give it a go. Ordered gyro sandwich and sautéed broccoli side and wife ordered Greek salad. My sandwich was very blah and the broccoli was so under cooked, couldn't eat it. They also didn't provide any tzatziki sauce side. Only giving it 2 stars because wife said her salad was decent.It's Greek to Me is def better and they give you extra tzatziki sauce for free and their sauce/meat tastes way better.Will not be ordering from here again.
2018-02-09,5,The crispy crispy crispy crispy zucchini and eggplant chips are heaven on earth.  This is deep fryer black magic.  I always get the yeero and am never disappointed.  The food here is consistently good, fast, and those chips honestly I may still extoll their virtues on my deathbed.
2018-01-04,1,This place is a joke. Placed an order on seamless, waited for 1.5 hrs, called them and was told that they're not delivering to our area. Get your sh*t together...
2017-12-28,5,We finally got here and so glad we did!  The place is cozy, the people are welcoming, the service was stellar and the food was delicious.  The chicken avgolemono soup was by far the best we ever had.  We always order the soup as a staple to judge any greek place and I am serious here, it really was the best.  I tried the greek chips which are fried zucchini and eggplant "chips" with grated cheese and tzatziki.  Wow those two cheese meld gorgeously together for a flavor bomb I loved.  We tried a Yeero ( that's their twist on the name) and it was delicious.  I plan to try the platter next time as this trip we had no salad.  I ordered the seared pork chops with grilled veges and greek fries. Our waitress Hamida recommended this dish. It served with fresh lemon wedge.  The only thing I would say is give more lemon (which I know they would absolutely accommodate.  As i said at the start stellar service.  Hamida is very attentive and took great care of us.  The pork is a very hard sear which personally I would have liked slightly less cooked but the lemon made the dish.  The grilled veges are quite good too and again i liked the lemon on them.  It was zucchini, eggplant, red pepper and tomatoes.  Never made it to dessert this trip, too full.  I plan to come back very soon as I will be dreaming about that chicken soup.  All in all so glad we finally have a decent greek place in Hoboken.  We live in Weehawken and yes they said they would deliver to us...YAY!  Great place, make sure to stop by
2017-12-03,4,We got the lamb pita platter and the grilled octopus appetizer. When you're reading the menu you're like why is the platter close to double the price... but the portions are huge! The two of us were full off 1 main and 1 app. The lamb pita platter came with salad and rice (or fries). The lamb comes on skewers. It was pretty good. The grilled octopus was what made the meal. It was so delicious. It was tender, juicy, and smoky. We loved the fresh tomato mix it came with. It really completed the dish.
2017-11-12,2,Let's me just say this would easily be a 4 or 5 star review except for 2 things. The first being I believe a lot of the menu is over priced. I got a yeero pita and fries and it was nearly $10 after tax when in my opinion based the amount of food and what it is should be closer to $7. I also ordered online and there should have been no confusion but they forgot the fries so all I got was the yeero which was delicious and had plenty of meat which is a plus. But a yeero and fries isn't worth $10. Not to mention they forgot the fries.
2017-10-29,2,From one greek to another... this is a very average greek place... the gyro meat was dry and bland. It looks like they have cut it from the circular mound of meat and let it sit out. The tzatziki is ok but nothing special. It has a lot of garlic in it.  The chicken gyro was better but still not up to par with some of the better greek food i have had.We also ordered the greek salad which was not bad.  I tried this place on 2 occasions and both were below par. Your best bet is to go to astoria/manhattan to get your greek fix.
2017-10-19,5,Living in the city I have the chance to have lots of Greek food and Greektown is on par if not ahead of the curve. I got the grilled chicken platter and was shocked with how much food you are given and could have easily split it into two meals. You can tel that all the food is good quality and their space was very clean with attentive service. Will easily be a regular whenever I'm in Hoboken
2017-10-17,2,It's a Tuesday 5:30pm 10/17/2017I've ordered gyro platters from here before and they've always been delicious. This time I ordered one for my other half and decided to try something new for myself. For myself I ordered the Stuffed crispy chicken for $18.00 & an appetizer to share The spinach pie for $7.00Since when is sticking cheese and spinach between two fried flat pieces of chicken called "stuffed chicken"? &Spinach pie came completely burnt and inedible. Really disappointed...
2017-10-08,1,Food was delicious, but the waitress was letting people smoke in the outdoor seating area, and when we brought it to her attention she's like "oh well it's outside it's probably ok". It's a shame because we wanted to enjoy the food and weather outdoors on the patio. Something like that just ruined the whole experience, and while the food was good, we just couldn't get over it. Probably won't return.
2017-09-29,5,Great, placed a last minute take out order. This was a large order for 15+. Expectations met at every level. Great food. Thank you.
2017-09-12,5,This place started off average, but really seems to have stepped it up over the past few months.   The chicken dishes are huge and tender, with ample rice and veggies.  The pita is always amazing as well.  I went from going here very occasionally to at least once a week (we often order in). The lunch menu also has some great deals.
2017-08-28,5,Delicious!!! This is the first time I've ordered from this place. Delivery guy was on time and friendly. I got the chicken pita platter, with fries, and Greek side salad. The Chicken kebob was perfectly seasoned, fries were amazing. Was too full to eat the salad, but had a few bites and it was good. There is nothing bad I can say about the food or service. Would definitely order again.
2017-08-26,4,I liked it! Ordered the yuerbo with Greek salad and the chicken yuerbo with pita and rice and salad. The meats wee tender and flavorful and the rice was also excellent. Will definitely be ordering from here again.
2017-08-24,5,My coworkers have been raving about this place so I decided to give it a try. I got the Yeero lunch special which was more than I expected because it came with a side order of fries. I also ordered the tzatziki with pita appetizer (again, not expecting the fries). In any event, everything was phenomenal and fresh. The tzatziki was the best I've had in a long time.  The young lady working the register was very friendly and I will definitely visit again.
2017-08-17,5,This place is so underrated! Best BEST Greek food in Hoboken.  In all honesty, probably best Greek food I've ever had. The service is warm and welcoming. You really get your bang for your buck here. The quality of food for the price is OUTRAGEOUS! Gotta check this place out.
2017-08-16,5,I recommend this place highly. The staff is great and the chicken avgolemono soup is outstanding.
2017-08-06,4,Greek town is the Greek spot in Hoboken! A few friends and I stopped in for a quick bite and unfortunately the gyro meat was 86ed! Karina, the host, was more than accommodating, giving me and my indecisive pals solid recommendations. I had the grape leaves and the grilled lamb plate, both were delish! I will definitely be returning here, and now that I live in Hobo, I will be ordering deliveries too!
2017-08-06,2,We've been passing by this restaurant for quite some time and always wanted to try it. Today we finally stoped in and ordered a few items off the menu.  The two stars is really only because the food was actually really good and the servers were amazing and welcoming.  However, if it wasn't for that this rating would be a zero, the manager present was horrible. Her attitude was simply disgusting, unwelcoming, condescending, snobby, and RUDE. I wish I knew her name to put it out there but I couldn't even approach her because she was too busy outside speaking with her friends instead of assisting her staff. So sad to see someone like this running a restaurant and "leading" employees that clearly care more about their clients than her.
2017-08-01,3,I've been meaning to go to this restaurant for awhile now, and finally was craving Greek tonight. My boyfriend and I went around 8 p.m. and was offered outdoor or indoor seating. The food overall was above average than other Greek place I've been to. I ordered the SHRIMP PITA and my boyfriend got the YEERO PLATTER with side of french fries. The platter also comes with a Greek side salad. The meat was pretty juicy and just the right amount of greasy. The shrimp pita was delicious and they didn't skimp out on the shrimp. The place is BYOB, which is pretty nice -- there's a wine & liquor store right across the street. Now, about the service...it was not great at all. There weren't that many customers, but all the empty tables were still dirty from previous customers. We had to wait to be given menus, water, and silverware (even after we had gotten our meals). We had to ask twice for wine glasses, and the servers just seemed a bit frantic. I think I'm going to just order pick-up next time, tbh.
2017-07-16,1,Ordered food 1 hour and 35 minutes ago. The first time I called to find out where my food was, i was told the driver made a deliver and was on his way. 15 minutes later I called and was told the cashier left with an order, they think it was mine. 10 minutes later I called and said my food was at the restaurant. Told them to keep it and enjoy eating it.
2017-07-09,3,Had the chicken gyro and a couple of appetizers. Food wasn't bad but nothing memorable. One plus is outdoor seating for nice days. May or may not return to this place but when I'm craving a great gyro there are better options.
2017-06-24,4,Hands down best humus I've had! Great first time to Hoboken, and we were able to get reservations same day for four outdoor seating. We Ordered the  tapas sampler, octopus (delicious and very generous! Highly recommend). Service was terrific, you can BYOB (we brought 3 bottles of wine). We stayed for a couple hours and were actually the last table to leave and the staff never rushed us. Very friendly, would come all the time if I lived closer! To top it off, the bill was only $88 for 4 people!
2017-06-14,3,I was craving Greek food and didn't quite get what I sought. It's a nice and simple place with indoor and outdoor seating. It stays busy with takeout and delivery business.The hummus and pita were excellent. We liked a Greektown salad and grilled octopus. I was underwhelmed with the shrimp entree.  The entree was big: loaded with orzo and shrimp but it lacked color and flavor.There's a wine shop across the street if you want to bring wine.The server was good but a one man band. He works the phone and the tables.
2017-06-12,1,Well our usual go to place is Its Greek to Me but my wife decided to try something new and thus began our finest hour yikesWe ordered a Lamb and a Chicken YeeroThe food was cold, the tzatziki sauce was non existent and very watery whatever was thereI was hungry so i ate it, my wife didn't bother since it was really blandThe vegetables were cut in a haste Pathetic to say the least. oh yeah and they also have a $3 delivery feeAvoid at all costs!!!!
2017-06-03,3,THE best hummus I think I've ever had. Flavor was amazing, can only wish that it was a little chunkier (texture preference). Had a chicken yeero which was also great on flavor. Had a section for outside sitting that I didn't get to take advantage of, but will definitely be back soon. Also, I think it's BYOB....perfect! Looking forward to going back for a "healthy" option for lunch.Taking off stars for service. First time there they forgot the French fries. 2nd time they forgot the hummus. It was empty both times so I can't say they were busy or short handed, just not listening.
2017-05-07,3,Kudos to the restaurant.  We showed up late; near closing time.   But they sat us down and we ordered.    Overall the food was good.  Service was decent.    Prices were as expected - very affordable.   We ordered the baklava.   Biggest pieces I've ever seen from a restaurant.  Good flavor too.
2017-05-04,3,I went to this place a couple weeks ago and while it was not horrible, it was not the greatest Greek I've ever had. I think the staff was very friendly and helpful but I was expecting more from the menu and food itself. The spicy feta dip tasted like they put canned chili in warmed feta but the main dishes weren't bad. Very typical Greek fast food. I'd go there again but it wouldn't be a ritual.
2017-04-30,5,Absolutely amazing! I had my First Communion & Confirmation Brunch at GreekTown and it was the best decision ever. My boyfriend and I have been coming to GreekTown since it opened and at first I was worried that it might not fit my party (I had 17 people) but we really LOVE the food so we went for it! Michael, the owner, was extremely helpful and accommodating. He helped me put together a menu of family style appetizers and sides and gave each of my guests the option of choosing their own entree from a small selection. For apps they prepared a variety of dips for us, as well as Haloumi and Greek salad (one of the reasons why my Boyfriend and I regulars). For entrees my guests chose from either a Yeero, Greek burger or grilled chicken pita (almost everyone went for the Yeero). And for sides we had fries, rice (so good!) and vegetables. All of my guests loved the food and couldn't stop raving about how delicious it was! Our server, Aveda (hopefully I am spelling that correctly) was super attentive (as always) and made sure everything was going great the whole time. We brought our wine and dessert and they helped me coordinate everything. Not only is the food DELICIOUS here but the staff and Michael are great! Thank you, GreekTown!!!
2017-04-05,5,I rarely write reviews but this place merits one. After seeing so many business in & out of this location, Greektown finally arrives and it's clear it will stay here. Every dish on this menu is satisfying, and most tend to be pretty healthy as well. My husband is from the Mediterranean & now refuses to eat regional cuisine unless it's from here. The crispy stuffed chicken is a must have. Not to mention...it's BYO and across the street from a liquor store.
2017-03-24,3,To sum it up, not a bad spot. I've been here several times, given the convenience and close proximity to the path. However, time and again I pass this place with my friends and we simply elect to go elsewhere 9 times out of 10. That being said, this is not a bad option and absolutely worth trying out if you've never been there before. Just keep a few things in mind.The food will not "WOW" you. The presentation is nice, but don't let that fool you, as quality leaves something to be desired. I suppose it is cool that the menu is translated to English. For example, spanakopita is simply called "spinach pie" on their menu, which is guaranteed to reduce confusion.I'll give it an extra star than I would have otherwise for the BYOB with the liquor store across the street.
2017-03-11,4,Such great food! Had the spicy feta dip and the chicken gyro platter and it was a lot of food and it was so good! Definitely recommend coming if you're in the mood for good Greek food! Also, the staff were so friendly and helpful! Loved it here
2017-03-08,5,This place is amazing!! Totally recommend going for lunch.  Plenty of food options to choose from. Love the atmosphere!  Very clean and love all the different Greek products you can purchase too!
2017-03-04,4,First time trying this place. Good stuff the salad was fresh and plentiful. The gyro meat was cooked nicely and it was not dry. I will definitely be going back. My new Greek spot in Hoboken
2017-02-26,5,So glad that we stumbled upon this place on a Sunday night !  We walked by and the restaurant was totally empty, but there seemed to be tons of delivery orders going out, so we decided to give it a shot. The staff were immediately very welcoming.  Our waitress (I wish I could remember her name) gave us recommendations and answered in detail any questions that we had about the menu. She was even sweet enough to bring us an on the house dessert at the end of the meal. We had the rice pudding and it was delicious - the perfect end to the dinner. The consistency was creamy and it wasn't too sweet!  About the dinner:  We started with the grilled octopus. ORDER THIS DISH!!! A large portion of perfectly grilled octopus on a bed of roasted red peppers, capers, onions and chickpeas. There isn't much to say about the appetizer other than it was amazing. The char of the octopus blended so well with the saltiness of the capers. The octopus was also so fresh and perfectly cooked to tender and not chewy. We followed the octopus with the grilled chicken with spinach and rice entree and the grilled chicken kebab platter. Both were delicious and were huge portions. We both took food home, enough for a second meal. The chicken on both dishes was well seasoned and not at all dry. Needless to say, we will be back!  I would definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a simple yet delicious, casual, BYOB restaurant.
2017-02-19,5,Super fresh food. Awesome service. Love the outdoor seating. Delicious local place. We usually get the soup and a platter for two people to share. Portions are a great size and the food is delicious.
2017-01-30,2,Thought I'd try this place for lunch given the decent reviews. Ordered the Greek burger medium-rare, and it came out too much on the rare side of things. The eggplant was also not grilled enough, I was looking for the melt in your mouth eggplant consistency.
2017-01-26,5,Love the Greek salad with grilled chicken. The dressing is perfect. Just wish they gave 2 grape leaves vs 1. Yeeros are good. Foods always fresh. Order the yeero and fries separate , less expensive than the platter. ;)
2017-01-15,2,Not terrible, but had flaws.Service was cool, food came out timely. Downsides were: greek salad lettuce was a little brown, seemed old and I also found a hair inside.The chicken kebab also didnt taste totally fresh,More like it was cooked an hr or so before and warmed up. A little dry.Tzatziki sauce was weird, watery, not full of much flavor. I've had better.Fries and Pita were fresh.Gyro was okay, I was told not filling however and a little misleading being offered with fries. Fries dont come as a side but a few stuffed inside the gyro.I'd probably try again sometime down the line, but for good Greek food this wouldnt be my first choice in the area for sure.
2017-01-11,1,It takes something really serious for me to give a 1-star rating, especially for a local small business. But pretty much everything about our experience a couple of months ago was terrible and I don't want others to waste their money. We tried this place because of the overwhelmingly positive Yelp reviews. But of the 3 things we ordered, only one (the octopus app) could even be called mediocre (and that would be generous). I got the Shrimp Santorini and it was just awful, especially because instead of shrimp, they gave me chicken; note that there is no version of the dish with chicken on the menu. The accompanying orzo was super mushy and the whole dish was totally bland -- worse than cafeteria food. I don't think I've ever sent food back, but the chicken error was egregious enough that I did this time. The waiter eventually came back with a plate that had shrimp on it, but also still had quite a few pieces of chicken. When he finally came back near the end of the meal, I complained about the dish again, noting all the chicken that had been left behind. He did not offer to take the $21 item off the bill and I didn't want to be a jerk so I didn't demand it. But we certainly put them on notice that we were not happy customers. Overall: bad food, bad service. Don't bother. Not sure what others are raving about.
2017-01-06,5,Great addition to the neighborhood!  I've been meaning to try this restaurant for awhile and I'm mad at myself for not getting there sooner.  Everything we had was excellent and the price/size of the meal was great.  We'll definitely be back.  For an app, we had the spicy feta dip.  For our meals, we had the greek salad and the gyro platter.  The spicy feta was served cold with warm, fresh, pita and was a great starter.  The gyro platter was very flavorful with more than enough rice, pita, and a greek salad on the side.  I still had a full dinner to take home.  The salad was fresh and flavorful.  All of that and it was under $35!
2016-12-20,5,I had never even heard of this place, but when looking for something close to my apartment in this cold weather, I found this place on Yelp! I was two blocks from my apartment, but had never seemed to walk in this direction. The service was excellent; it wasn't too busy on a Friday night but not sure if that was because of the location or the cold weather. We ordered the appetizer samplers, which was absolutely delicious. A good size for 2 people. We then both ordered the platter (one veggie and one chicken). There was more than enough food that we took home because we couldn't finish it all.The restaurant is BYOB, and the waiters were very attentive to pouring us water, making sure we had everything we needed, and answering all of our questions.I will definitely be back, and love that I found a new place so close to my apartment.
2016-12-17,5,Great Greek place with a good range of options. You can grab a cheap Gyro (or "Yeero" as they call them here) for $8-10 or get a fancier Greek meal with entrees in the $20-30 price range. Everything I've had has been fantastic. Will definitely be back here!
2016-12-16,5,Ordered delivery from Greektown. Everything arrived warm. The quinoa salad with yeero meat is huge! We are really happy there is another Greek restaurant in Hoboken!!
2016-12-13,4,Really good.  I got the Greektown Yeero which was lamb and beef but also with french fries (fat sandwich style).  It was delicious.  The absolute perfect mixture of vinegar and flavors that really complimented the food.  Reasonably priced for take out as well.
2016-12-08,3,Found this place on Yelp, and called in a pick up order. I got the chicken yeeros which was pretty good. Nothing CRAZY like some of these reviews mention, but it was good and I'd probably order here again for some quick food, or some post bar food. Total was $9.95 which I think is a bit high for the quality of food. I can get a Rafiqi's Food Truck platter for $5.75; more food and tastes better.
2016-12-03,5,Wow- so much better than all of the other Greek places in town. Delicious hummus and pita. Got the chicken kebab platter- so on point with the rice, moist chicken and tatziki. The Greek salad that comes with it stole the show for me- so yummy. Just moved downtown from midtown and we definitely just found our new spot!
2016-11-24,5,My girlfriend and I had been waiting to try this place for awhile now, and we are so glad we did.We got there about 7 on Weds night, place was pretty much full when we got there. We were quickly attended to by the waiter. The calamari was what we settled on to start off with. The texture was perfect and the taste was VERY fresh.For our entrees we both went with the chicken yeero platters, since we were quite hungry. The order came out in nice timing and wow was our hunger no match! The big plate had half chicken with all the extras underneath and the other had french friend. In addition to that we were also given a greek salad on the side, which was also so fresh and tasty. the tzatziki sauce was also amazing.Overall the atmosphere was nice and the food was amazing. The staff was also very helpful and attentive. We spoke with the owner for a few minutes who was also very nice. We will definitely be going back!
2016-11-21,3,Simple restaurant with well known basic dishes on generous portioned plates. I liked the Avgolemono (lemon and egg soup), which was more filling than I anticipated. Good place for lunch.
2016-11-12,4,BYOB Greek in Hoboken. Intimate dining spot. Had family in from out of town they loved the food! Portions were HUGE. Would return again. Also moderately priced.
2016-11-06,2,I'm giving this review two stars instead of one only because the waitress was kind after I called attention to the fact that the chicken in the gyro was raw and undercooked.  She apologetically explained that it had never happened before and offered me anything else free of charge; however, after having partially eaten chicken that wasn't cooked properly, I just couldn't think about eating.  Chicken, unlike other meats or fish, should never be served undercooked to a customer.  We came here excited to try something different in downtown Hoboken and left wondering whether I'd get sick.  If you eat here, check your food carefully.
2016-10-22,4,This place is great! I came here with my friend the other day, and we ordered a bunch of appetizers for dinner. Everything was amazing! We got the cold appetizer sampler, spinach dip, grilled octopus, and fried eggplant and zucchini chips. The portions are huge, so it was way too much food for the two of us, but we loved everything! The zucchini and eggplant chips were a little too breaded for me, but I would definitely recommend the other 3 things. My favorite was the cold sampler. It came it hummus, spicy feta dip, tzatziki sauce, eggplant dip, grape leaves and beets, and it was served with so much warm pita. I loved our waiter, too. He was so attentive and sweet. It's BYOB and prices are fair. I will definitely be back!
2016-10-19,3,I was excited to try this newish Greek restaurant in Hoboken, and while I didn't enjoy my entree, I will definitely give it another shot as the dip sampler and spinach pie looked pretty good and I'm dying to try there artichoke salad, which they were out of when I visited.  I ordered the tzatziki (which was good) and Shrimp Santorini ($21 shrimp / fresh tomatoes / spinach / feta cheese over orzo) which I did not care for at all.  I think the supporting ingredients were probably fine, but the shrimp didn't taste very fresh or flavorful.  My fella had a chicken and orzo entree and found the chicken to be completely unseasoned.In terms of my one experience I would rate two stars, but as there are other dishes I want to try, they are new, and it's byob, I'm rounding up to 3 stars.
2016-10-12,4,I have to say, I have a hard time eating chicken lately.. but not from this place. The food is fresh and cooked to perfection. I really enjoyed my experience. The place is CLEAN and the food tastes awesome. The staff was very nice and everything came out promptly. I will be back.
2016-10-08,4,Ok.... so do you want to go to a place better than ITS GREEK TO ME in Hoboken? because I was dying for another greek spot in this town and we GOT IT.Spinach pie is far superior to greek to me...and insanely freshI had a chicken/rice dish with tomatoes and feta and basically licked it clean lolmy husband got a gyro and he loved it... and said it was better than greek to meplus this is a byob restaurant... I mean come on people cant get better....great service on top of it!
2016-10-07,5,We ordered through seamless for pickup, and will definitely order again.  We had the stuffed chicken, the salmon entree, and the gyro.  Everything was delicious but we were especially impressed with the little details like the cloth/net over the halved lemon so the seeds wouldn't get into the food or the fact that the side broccoli was actually green and had good texture and taste.  The food in general was well presented even in the pick up containers.  The portions are also very fair for the price.  Highly recommend
2016-10-07,4,I had always enjoyed Hoboken's outpost of the local It's Greek to Me chain, but I was thrilled to see that it now had competition from the quaint Greektown.  A similarly casual and BYOB spot, Greektown also offered a comparable level of satisfaction.  The service was fantastic, and the food was enjoyable.  The positive seasonal weather enabled us to grab comfortable, cushioned seats at one of the outdoor tables.  We were regaled with a basketful of warm, flavorful pitas to enjoy while we waited for our meal.  We started with the Meatball Appetizer, which we sadly found dry and tasteless.  In fact, they did not appear fresh at all.  While that dish literally put a bad taste in our mouths, the Greektown Salad blew us away.  It did not contain any lettuce, but included large chunks of tomato, cucumber, and soft feta.  It was bold, fresh, and simply delicious!  We could not get enough of it, and even thought it was one of the best we had ever had.  My Chicken Kebab entrée included only 2 skewers, but each had about 8 chunks of meat on them!  The chicken was tender and well-marinated.  It was served with another salad, even more fluffy pita, and some buttery rice.  Overall, it was an above average experience worthy of 3.5 stars, but the exceptional service led me to round up to 4 stars.
2016-10-02,3,It's a nice place, we really liked the atmosphere there, the stuff is nice. Everything was cooked very well, a Greek salad, a pork and a mixed pita platter. But unfortunately we didn't like the quality of the rice and the pork meat at all. I wish this place well but in Hoboken where people probably prefer better quality food, its better to use better products.
2016-09-25,4,So happy we Found this place. Delicious!!!! All of it. Great healthy Greek food. Authentic and delicious
2016-09-22,1,Food trashy and of cheap quality. This is why it's on the cheap side. The service is  the same. No professionalism and no efficiency. We were there last Saturday, the waitress did not offer us to drink anything besides the tap water, nor did she offer coffee, dessert. She barely spoke English. I just have wander where did this owner find this staff to work for him. We won't come back again.
2016-09-20,4,Place was nice and cute. The appetizers and salads were amazing! The gyros weren't great at all tho. I would def go back for a greek salad w chicken or some apps :)
2016-09-12,4,Good food. Quick service. The Lunch Specials have great prices. We had a group of 6 for lunch and were served promptly and each of us enjoyed our meals. I had the Gyro & Fries lunch special (ordered an extra side of their Tzatziki), my wife enjoyed the Greek Quinoa Salad (which I can attest is awesome, I had a couple of bites). The only gripe is that once we got the bill, they never returned. No offer of water or refills once it was presented. Otherwise a nice addition to the Hoboken culinary scene.
2016-08-27,5,Loved the appetizer sampler and the lentil soup. Generous portions for everything's, I barely had room for my entree. It's always a plus that it's byob and a liquor store across the street.
2016-08-21,4,Our new go- to Greek spot in town!  My husband always gets the gyro platter and it even comes with a huge side salad. I typically get the Greek salad with grilled chicken or salmon and it's delicious. I've had the shrimp before but I wouldn't recommend the shrimp- they tasted a bit rubbery. Greek fries are fantastic as is the hummus for an appetizer.
2016-08-15,1,On Friday night, three of us decided to try this place, as we were all Ina mood for Greek food. It was boiling hot inside, this is an open kitchen/restaurant concept, which made the place look really tacky and cheap. It's seemed that their AC was not working at all! We felt we might have as well been outside! Nonetheless, we still decided to stay and try the food. The prices are very affordable(on a cheap side), which makes me alway doubt the quality. If the owner buys good quality food how can he sell it with such a low prices, unless they frozen Junk, and add MSG to enhance the flavor! I've decided to try their shrimp Santorini, which was a fake version of the real shrimp Santorini. The original dish is baked in the oven with feta, and without spinach. Yeero platter was awful, the taste didn't resemble the meat. Maybe the meat was left years and years in the freezer, before being bought and cooked. On top of that it was brought to us cold! Their  so called "Greek Fries" tasted worse than Mac Donald's. None of the servers were pleasant nor smiling. No greeting at the table and no apology for keeping us wait from drinks, food, to paying our check. She was unable to answer any of our questions. Even though the restaurant was not busy, none of the servers offers us anything to drink besides asking us if we want tap water. We had to ask if they have soft drinks/juices(this is BYO). The waitress was holding our glasses by the rim, which were all dirty of fingertips, and it made us feel disgusted to drink anything here! She was not the only one doing that, the others were doing exactly the same. It's was obvious to us that none of these girls have ever worked in the restaurant industry, before getting a job here. With so many great choices of Greek food in the area, we will definitely not be coming back here. In reply to the owner:If you wanted to make the same restaurant concept as in Greece, it is a great tale for someone who has never been to Greece.  However, I've been, and none of it resembles Greece. Not the open kitchen/restaurant concept nor the food. Your yeero has nothing to do with the taste of yeero I've had in Greece! It tastes like it's been frozen for many years(ready made cones of meat).  I don't know about not using MSG as you say, as one of you waiters said that you do use it on everything, because it tastes better. Who is interested to look at the cleanliness of your kitchen, when your staff is walking around with dirty shirts and aprons, sweaty, with bad odor?! Please don't tell me that the same waiters also work in Greece. Don't attack customers, but rather work on the issues brought to your attention, and  find the ways to improve your restaurant and food/staff quality.
2016-08-14,2,My buddy said he was having dinner here. I was feeling Greek too, but after seeing this place listed as a "hot new business" on Yelp having only been open for three months, that solidified my plans to join.My first impression is that the place is very casual and affordable. The most expensive thing on the menu is $24 (lamb chops). BYOB is also a plus. I can only speak for the lamb pita platter, which was quite filling for $17. They give you a choice of gyro or kebab. I opted for the gyro, but was pretty disappointed when the meat was served to me chopped rather than shaved. I've never had a gyro with such thick chunks of meat. If I had wanted thick chunks of meat, I would have ordered the kebab. To add insult to injury, the meat was cold. As for the side option (fries or rice), I saw the fries were in all likelihood frozen so I opted for the rice, which turned out to be perfectly cooked and delicious.The tzatziki sauce, which I also can't speak for, is probably a bit too garlicky. My buddy kept popping gum all night. The night we went here, it was 100 degrees outside. Inside the restaurant, it might have been 99. This was evident by the fact that our ice bucket for our wine caused flooding reminiscent of that from Hurricane Sandy, which brings me to the service ...Either our waitress was having a really bad day or else she needs a new profession. I have never encountered a more unenthusiastic person whose income is dependent on tips. I'm still scratching my head over how it took so long for my table of 3 people to get served when there were only a handful of other people in the restaurant besides us. We must have waited 30 minutes for our food, so I'm guessing she either forgot to place the order or else the kitchen was having an equally bad day as our server. When my cold lamb finally was ready, there was absolutely no sense of urgency in delivering it to the table, nor was she the least bit apologetic.For the amount of Greek options in the area, I can't imagine Greek Town will be in town for too long if they don't get it together.
2016-08-12,3,3 stars but it has potential.  I love greek food and before Greek Town opened up there was only one other greek restaurant in town, so I had to give it a try. Greek Town sits on a corner a few blocks away from the path.  It is byob and there is a liquor store conveniently located across the street.  We sat outside on a summer night and the chairs have cute blue and white striped pillows which played nicely with the greek theme.You really get a bang for your buck here because the portions were huge and the food was pretty good.  We got the grilled octopus (much bigger portion than other restaurants), shrimp orzo, crusted chicken with potatoes and baklava (don't remember the specific dish names).  I would definitely return to try the other dishes on the menu however, like the other reviews mention, the service is very slow.
2016-08-06,3,I was really excited when I walked by this because I'm always down for a good gyro, especially if it's close to me. I got a shrimp gyro and my fiance got a chicken gyro. The sauce was tasty, the vegetables were crisp and fresh, and the protein was cooked well. However, at $8-9 a gyro (no fries, rice etc.) , it's on the expensive side for fast casual. I would totally pay that price if there was fries, rice, or a small salad on the side (or a combination of those) to make for a more filling meal. The starters and desserts are also on the expensive side. I'm conflicted because it's too expensive for a casual take out place. I will probably continue getting gyros elsewhere.
2016-07-31,5,Delicious. Had the assorted cold apps. Each of them was incredibly tasty. We also had the chicken pita and the Greek chicken salad. Each was outstanding. Prices are very reasonable. Will definitely be back!
2016-07-29,5,This really is delish! Casual dining (so not a first big date spot) but the food is so good. I've been a few times and the quality was great each time. If you like dips and pita, get the assortment platter--it's a little pricier but you get a good amount of everything. You can sit outside and BYO, which is always a plus. Liquor store right across the street. So happy about this addition to Hoboken and am happy every time I walk by and see the tables filled.
2016-07-27,4,A coworker recommended this place and I was really happy to see it had good reviews on Yelp (is it bad that Yelp community review trump coworkers' opinions?). They usually do takeout, but we decided to sit to get out of the office for a bit. The space is really open, bright & clean-- with huge windows. There's some outdoor seating, but we took advantage of the A/C. The lunch special is awesome. I got a Greek salad with grilled chicken for $8.95, my friend ordered the salmon (and absolutely loved it), and my other friend ordered the chicken pita. My salad was a really good size for a lunch portion, but didn't have olives and had very limited chicken & feta. I really liked the dressing. It was a very light greek dressing. The salad also came with a side of pita and I asked for a small side of tzaziki, which the waitress gladly brought over for me. I would definitely come back for lunch, but I would probably order something else next time (unless I was trying to be healthy, like today). The service was pretty slow. We were there for like an hour, so I'd probably try takeout next time. But, really, really glad this place opened up and that we have a good greek food option in the neighborhood.
2016-07-22,5,Greek Town is fabulous! The service was top notch as well as the food. We had a dipping appetizer which was great. The shrimp and orzo was delicious. Dessert was incredible--some apple cake--yummy! A great spot!!
2016-07-18,4,Delicious and affordable Greek food.  We had the tzatziki, octopus, and a Greek salad w/ gyro meat.  Everything was really tasty and the portions were very generous.  We'll definitely be going back soon.
2016-07-16,4,Greek Town is a hot and new restaurant to Hoboken! And, boy am I glad there is some Greek food in the neighborhood. Though not authentic, the food is delicious. I had chicken gyro and my brother had the beef and lamb gyro. Nostimo! That means delicious in Greek! You've my stamp of approval. The frappe was amazing!!!!!
2016-07-12,5,Absolutely terrific Greek food thank you for arriving. You finally figured out what to do to cater to the Greek food lovers in town. Everything they have figured out works perfectly for Hoboken including the liquor store across the street for the BYOB experience. The mediterranean food is second to none.
2016-07-08,5,What a good new place ! This is BYOB which is wonderful for people who are picky about their drinks. The food and service are both very good- the crispy stuffed chicken is especially good  (and has dill which I LOVE). There is outdoor seating for the nice weather days. The bonus is that they play good greek music inside (please never change this). They don't have Greek coffee at the moment but I was told that in the future they will  (and I can't wait!) . We will definitely be back here, I'm so happy to have this restaurant as an option.
2016-07-03,5,This was my first time here. I don't think I've ever left a Yelp review, but this place deserves one. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive, the food was delicious, portions were especially generous, and pricing was very reasonable. I will definitely be back. It has a very casual atmosphere and is great for an easy lunch or dinner with friends or alone. I had the octopus appetizer which was amazing and the greektown salad (traditions horiatiki salad) which was also fantastic. I highly recommend trying this place out!Update: even though they don't appear on the menu they have several traditional Greek desserts. The owner graciously treated me to the Rice Pudding and...wow! Definitely homemade and delish. Leave room for something sweet!
2016-06-29,3,Service was ok. Chicken pita was delicious but really need some structure here. Baklava was not good. I will give it another chance...
2016-06-22,4,My kids and I had the lunch special ( chicken sandwhich) with greek fries. My little picky eaters ate all of it. I would have preferred smaller chicken pieces ( I am just picky with my meat). I ordered them the  Baklava for $6.00 I thought it was a little pricy but it has a lot of nuts and was delish.
2016-06-20,4,Spicy Feta dip is so good I would probably order that alone for dinner. BYO, causal, good for a girls night dinner. Didnt feel like it was a "date spot" but I was also there on a Tuesday night.
2016-06-19,4,Very happy to have a nice Greek spot in our neighborhood! We sat outside on a Sunday night, and our serve Mike was very attentive and friendly. We had the cold appetizer platter that can be seen in the photos, then split the seafood platter and yeero platter. The food came out REALLY fast, while still having a nice presentation.  Some standouts: In the appetizer platter, the spicy feta was really great, as were the stuffed leaves and dense tzatziki. The octopus was very tender and juicy, with a wonderful smokiness. Mike pointed out that the lamb is fresh and not frozen, and it was definitely delicious. Portions were VERY ample, so feel free to share. Our bill came to $55 for the cold appetizer combo, seafood platter, and gyro platter. They were out of the cheese appetizer we wanted, as well as the lamb skewer, so that was a bit of a disappointment. That said, it was a Sunday evening (Fathers day), and if that's all they're out of, they're doing pretty well. We'll be back for the stuff we missed, and we'll try delivery once it's available (it will be a few weeks as of this review).This is a delicious, friendly and welcome addition to the neighborhood!
2016-06-14,4,A new restaurant opens on my walk to and from work?? I just had to try it.The waitstaff was attentive, almost to the point of impatience. They accommodated my group by putting together tables on their outdoor patio, for which we were very appreciative. The prices were standard for a good Greek restaurant. The portion sizes were large (I actually had the grilled octopus appetizer as my main course and it was enough for dinner), and the food came out reasonable quickly. The gyros (yeeros for the Greek) and salmon entrees were also large and [I was told] quite tasty.To top it off, it's BYOB! Overall, the ambiance is lacking for anything except dinner with friends or with family, but I'd still come back if I was in the mood for Greek.
2016-06-12,5,Amazing!! So happy to see an authentic Greek restaurant open in Hoboken! The place is BYOB its great for small plates or a regular entrees. My boyfriend and I sampled the cold apps, calamari and octopus and we couldn't get enough of it!
2016-06-12,5,My girlfriend and I went here for dinner last night and we had a great time! The staff was very attentive and the food was delicious. Greektown is an authentic Greek restaurant worth visiting for a casual dinner.
2016-06-11,4,Have been waiting for a new place to open and was looking forward to trying Greek Town.  Finally got to try it last week and was not disappointed.    Not super fancy but decent tasty options which I think is just what this location needs.    Loved the appetizer sampler and the salads were really fresh.   Low key and BYOB which are 2 things that I love.  I understand that they'll be serving breakfast soon as well which will be a nice option.    Overall I think great potential to be a solid local option.
2016-06-10,5,Always exciting for new restaurants to open in the area. Tried this place for the first time, and will definitely be going back.We had the Calamari appetizer which was delicious and fresh. For entree had the chicken kebab platter with fries. Great portion size and everything was served hot. It is also byob which is a plus!
2016-06-08,3,I hate to give the first 3 star review, and let me first say that I really think this place CAN be a 4 or 5 star. Also, let me preface that I would return to eat here.  We sat outside & were immediately greeted by our waiter. He quickly asked if we wanted anything to drink & if we were ready to order (literally sat down for maybe 45 seconds). He came back a minute later (I'm not exaggerating) & then again a minute later. We still weren't ready to order. Then it took 10 mins for him to come back. Food took about 40 mins to come out, and our waiter was very apologetic about that. I think this is a great takeout place, but not a date spot or the best Greek food in Hoboken. IT DEFINITELY HAS POTENTIAL!
2016-06-05,5,Just tried for the first time and loved it! Casual byob with outdoor seating and friendly staff. The appetizer assortment was delicious and fresh-6 small portions of cold apps-tzatziki, spicy feta dip, hummus, beets, eggplant dip and stuffed grape leaves. Also tried a yeero and chicken pita-very good! Will definitely be back soon!
2016-06-04,5,Fantastic! Stopped by with the fiance for dinner and it was delicious. Started with the cold sampler which I highly recommend, the tzatiki, hummus and eggplant in particular stood out. Seemed small but by the end we were nearly stuffed, could comfortably be an appetizer for four. As our entree I had the yeero patter and she had the chicken platter. Yeero was perfectly seasoned and the accompanying rice was perfect. Her chicken was perfectly cooked, juicy and tender with a nice touch of lemon.Will definitely be a regular!
2016-05-31,3,Went for lunch with my wife, they got both our orders wrong. Food was decent, small portions for price. We will be sticking with the other Greek place in Hoboken :)
2016-05-21,4,Solid Greek spot. We came here for lunch on a weekend because we wanted to seeing this new place was any good. It's byo which is a huge plus. The hummus was good but could have used some spices on top. The meat was good and the pita was very yummy. The waitstaff was friendly but maybe a little slow. The prices are very good. We will be back for sure.
2016-05-19,5,We were waiting so long for a nice restaurant to open in this location, and prayed it would be a delicious one, well someone up there heard us because this restaurant opened :) the food is delicious, we ordered the yeeros with extra side of sauce, and it was all we expected and more. It is a BYOB, and right in front you have the best liquor store of the Mendoza family, so you can run across and get some wine to relax with. Service is wonderful, fast and kind, 100% recommended!!! Good addition for the hoboken foodies like us!
2016-05-19,4,Really promising new spot. I had a pita and my boyfriend had the yeero -  both were enormous, fresh, and delicious. We split the best baklava I've ever had. It's also BYOB and when the weather is nice, it will be great to sit outside. Good service, too.
2016-05-15,4,Tried this new place last night and we will surely be back. Great service, good food, and reasonable prices. Their tzatziki is great, and their gyro meat is well-seasoned. The platter is worth the extra few bucks.They're BYOB and they'll put your wine bottle on ice or keep your beers in the fridge and bring them out to you with chilled glasses.The waiter said they're getting outdoor seating next week, and after memorial day they're planning on offering brunch (both greek brunch - whatever that is - and regular brunch). BYOB outdoor brunch. Sold.
2016-05-14,4,Solid Greek food. The salad was amazing, pork chops huge and delicious and baklava to die for. French fries perfectly seasoned. Service was very attentive and friendly.This place is new and I would expect them to ramp up soon. Tables opening up outside any day now, I was told.And, BYOB with a liquor store across the street, which is nice.
2016-05-13,4,I love Greek food and it's really one of the cuisines with which Hoboken struggles. While the restaurant still has some work to do, I will attribute the hiccups to being only a week old. For takeout, we ordered the lentil soup (excellent), Greek salad with shrimp, and the grilled chicken platter. The grilled chicken platter came with a decent sized Greek salad, tzatziki  and fries (although I had ordered the rice). The grilled chicken was flavorful and juicy, and the Greek salad was balanced and tasty.  Compared to similar Greek restaurants, the prices are a bit steep. I was also surprised that they don't offer any dessert (who doesn't love baklava with their meal?). But I give this restaurant 4 stars because I can't argue with *very* good food!  I think with some price adjustments, Greek Town has the potential to do really well! Or at least, I am hopeful...
2016-05-13,4,Wife ordered the chicken gyro ($8) and I got the pork chops ($18).  This was for take out.The chicken in the gyro was pretty good. The chicken chunks were large and juicy. The vegetables on top were fresh and appetizing. This was a good price for the gyro - unsure about the platter though, which adds $7 for fries and salad.  Maybe it's a deluxe salad and not a wack iceberg lettuce tomato salad.The pork chop dinner was great. 2 large thicker cut pork chops were juicy and perfectly cooked. It could've used a bit more flavor, but I'm willing to give it a thumbs up. It came with French fries and grilled vegetables, which were really good. It has a good assortment - asparagus, peppers, onions... Perfect.I'm definitely willing to go back - I thought it was a worthwhile try considering they just opened.  We will definitely return!
