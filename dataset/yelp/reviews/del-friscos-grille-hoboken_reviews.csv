2021-10-26,4,Came here on a Sunday at 7pm for my friends going away gathering. My friend reservations and we're seated promptly. The place has a warm atmosphere. I got the fried chicken sandwich with bacon ($3 extra) and honey mustard on the side. My sandwich came with fries. The chicken sandwich was ok, probably get something else if I came back. The shaved steak sandwich looked really yummy. The honey mustard was great. All in all, would probably come here if someone wanted to meet here. The parking sucks per usual. Would give 3.5 star but for the reasons below it's 4 stars. * great service * honey mustard is a must
2021-10-25,3,I recently visited Del Frisco for the second time in the pandemic. This time we took a couple of our friends. We called in advance to make a reservation, as there is always a wait in the Hoboken location.We ordered Crispy Artichokes, Cauliflower steak and Fillet Mignon for the very first time. The food is definitely pricey and the portions are good for one person. The flavors were just fine, nothing stood out or impressive. However the atmosphere is always great and the restaurant is right across the New York skyline, which is an added bonus.
2021-10-20,1,I've been to Del Frisco's a few times & I've always had a good experience however today I ordered a steak through Uber Eats & it arrived completely RAW!
2021-10-16,3,Came to Del Friscos in Hoboken on a Sunday afternoon for a girl's brunch. There's no parking, so you will need to street park or find a garage. The inside is big and sophisticated. Gives a very upscale American vibe. Unfortunately, this didn't translate to the food.We all ordered off the brunch menu. I ordered the short rib hash and everyone else got the eggs in purgatory. There was barely any short rib in my dish. lt felt like I paid $24 for a bowl of potatoes with a sprinkle of leftover cubed steak. I didn't try the eggs in purgatory, but the presentation was so weird! They literally squeezed a line of guacamole down each pita which looked extremely tacky! Would've looked much more classy with sliced avocado on the side. Aside from the appearance, everyone said it tasted fine. My overall experience was average. Not awful, but not amazing. It felt on par with Bonefish Grill or Seasons 52. I may consider returning to give the lunch or dinner menu a shot.
2021-09-16,1,I WISH I COULD GIVE ZERO STARS THE ENTIRE STAFF IS RACIST THEY RUINED MY BIRTHDAY DINNER!!!! From the moment me and my friends got there the waitress we had didn't tend to us at all had to ask multiple times can we place our order, as i watched her walking around to the white people tables asking if they're enjoying there food mind you didn't even take our order , on top of that got our order wrong even after waiting so long to order .. So now they knew it was my birthday we're sitting waiting after finishing our food over 30 minutes i expected them to bring me the cake so my friends could sing happy birthday instead they walked right past me and went to the white people's tables and sung happy birthday to this lady and brung her dessert ...after my friend complained about why they didn't do the same for me they tried to say they "forgot" wow way to treat your customers smh at that point i was over it cause the whole time there i just noticed we weren't being treated the same as everyone else so i just wanted to leave , they didn't even care mind u we just spent over 400$ on food smh i would never go back to this place too much discrimination!!!!!
2021-09-12,5,I had dinner here for the first time since the pandemic, and the food is as great as ever. The ribs are some of the best I've had, and the Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich is delicious and tender. Their sweet potato fries are also some of the best I've had in any restaurant. The appetizers and drinks were great as well. The service was very friendly, as always. Prices might be a little steep, especially for some appetizers like the crabcake which have pretty small portion sizes, but overall the food is well worth it.
2021-09-11,1,Horrible service. Went here with friends for brunch. The manager (man in vest) refused to check if one of their 5 patio tables were open, saying "let's wait for the hostess to get back" ... then took 15 minutes to sit us. Then stuck his head out of the door to bark at us that our 5lb baby dogs were an issue because we were trying to give them water . Never go here!
2021-09-09,2,I visited this establishment with my family for dinner. Our service was pleasant and friendly, however the dining experience as a whole was subpar. The first warning sign came when the steaks arrived on a blank white plate, lacking any sort of side, garnish, or sauce. It honestly felt like we were patients in a hospital being served a sanitary meal. The steak had good flavor but could have been more tender. Of note, the knives given specifically for the steaks were incredibly dull, which made the eating process arduous to say the least. Went in with high hopes as I had only heard good things, but left unsatisfied. (Side note: a family member more familiar than I with various cuts of meat claimed the NY strip looked atypical; I do not have the steak experience needed to confirm.
2021-09-03,4,Food was good as was the service.    Location is a bit dated. But in these times it's more about supporting our local eateries
2021-08-25,1,RACISM ALERT!!So this is a beautiful place in Hoboken with a hell of a racist server! The server had no courtesy to offer us the menu and when we asked for it he said- too late sorry u have to order now.. ( I assume it is because we are Asians) .. and then with a heavy heart he gave us the menu And then he was hardly interested in noting what we wantedHe was rolling his eyes and was extremely rude and made us feel unwelcome. It has been 6 years in USA but never have we felt so unwelcome at a place ! I wish the place hires better servers
2021-08-25,1,Had a bad experience with waiter. He was speaking in Italian accent and was a big time Racist. Rude and arrogant. Very bad experience.
2021-08-22,4,I came here for a birthday yesterday so we had a fixed menu. We were served the Ahi Tuna tacos and Cheesesteak eggrolls - the tacos were more avo than tuna so 7/10 for skimping and the cheesesteak eggrolls were great so 8/10. We had a caesar and their signature salad, pretty good but not the best salad ever so 7.5/10. my steak was ordered medium but it was more on the rare side, not the best steak i've ever had but it was decent so 7/10. the pairings were truffle mac and cheese which was a 10/10 and the mashed potatoes which were average, my mom makes them better so 6/10. the waitress also had attitude, which you think wouldn't happen when shes getting a $200+ tip but what can ya do?
2021-08-09,2,Beautiful setting with the NYC skyline as your background. Food was very good, got the filet with roasted mushrooms and it was very delicious. Everyone else at our table enjoyed their meal as well. Now here are the cons... very sneaky. They will try to upsell you in everything! Everything is at an additional cost but they don't tell you that, they don't explain anything to you and make it seem like it's part of the meal and when you get the bill, you are shocked by the prices. Our waiter was good for the most part, but never explained anything to us. Told us about specials but never mentioned anything about price. He ranted on about toppings but made it seem like it was part of the meal, not at an additional cost. My sister did not want any topping but he kept pressuring her to get it. Now we know why, it's an additional $4 for every topping! Then when it came to the bill, he told us we would get $50 off if we signed up for some rewards card... never explained that it was $50 for a future meal or that the rewards card cost $25! He mentions it later on after he had already added it on our bill. Very sneaky and scammy tactics. Paid for the food and left, later when we looked at the receipt again... he added on a side of bread with garlic butter for $4 which we never ordered or received. It was never about money to us, but it would have been nice if he explained everything to us so we were aware. We had a great time while we were there but realized how the waiter swindled us for more money later on and really left us with a negative feeling about this place. Never again.
2021-08-07,1,Been here several times over the last few years. Just long enough in between to forget how bad this place is. Service is fine. The food is terrible. Every time I come here the food just feels like it's old, and reheated but not even hot let alone warm. Just a terrible experience
2021-08-06,1,Ambiance was nice, food however was less than mediocre. Lobster Mac and Cheese sorely lacking in every aspect. Steak was literally burned and not worth the expense. Drinks were good but too pricey for the size. Wasn't happy with the service either, could have been great $200+ for a two person outing and did not enjoy any part of the meal for either party. Was not impressed.
2021-07-31,1,You could not chew the shrimp to save your life and the risotto was .. unbearable. I had to send it back. If you're sensitive to mushy texture or you need seafood a certain way, do not order this. Long story short everything was cooked terribly. To make matters worse our waitress could not have been any slower with her service. You would of thought the restaurant was at max capacity with how badly she checked in on us. But, it wasn't.. it was low capacity because of covid. Cmon yall.. do better.. you can't have a nice location and have low quality food/service.
2021-07-29,3,They didn't have ribs :( something about a butcher . The eggroll cheesesteak was yummy tho
2021-07-24,4,Haven't stopped by in quite a while so I was glad to stop back in for a late dinner Friday evening - we sat at the bar. Eric the bartender couldn't have been nicer, there was also other people behind the bar who were happy to grab us anything we needed. Overall solid experience! We started off with drinks (dirty martini &  pinot noir) and the ahi tuna tacos - perfect to share. We both ordered salads and side of fries. I'm not sure why reviews are so mixed- yes it's a little pricey but it's still a great spot so I'm happy to support! I would highly recommend sitting at the bar and enjoying dinner or drinks!
2021-07-23,5,I recently had dinner at Del Frisco's for the first time since COVID started and forgot how delicious the food is!I came with a group of 6 and we had a great meal. This is definitely a spot that you can't really order "wrong." I've tried a good amount of their menu items over the years and have enjoyed everything. The wild mushroom flatbread was packed with Arugula and mushrooms, a perfect appetizer to split with one other person. They can also make it on gluten free crust which is always appreciated! This was my first time trying their crispy artichoke appetizer and certainly won't be my last! They're lightly breaded with Parmesan cheese and come with a decadent caesar dressing on the side. Another must-order appetizer. In the past the steakhouse salad has been my go-to entree (it's the most filling salad on earth, comes with a generous portion of steak and a bunch of other toppings). However this time I decided to try their grilled salmon entree, which is served on top of asparagus. It's a very light dish but still really delicious and filling!
2021-06-29,5,Excellent fine dining establishment with a good view of the Hudson & NYC Skyline across the street. Came here to relax and unwind after a stressful 2020 and spend time with family and we were not disappointed. Service was fantastic, and food and drinks exceeded expectations. If you pay visit, be sure to try their Cheesesteak Eggrolls, Truffle Mac & Cheese, and any of their steak options (seasoning and tenderness is perfect). Can also never go wrong with Red Sangria either. Overall, Del Frisco's Grille checked all the boxes for a fine dining restaurant close to the Hudson. Will definitely be back soon for a special occasion!
2021-06-28,3,I've hesitated leaving a review because I chalked the first time up to one bad server. At this point it's a pattern and it's disappointing because I liked this location but I won't be back. I went this past Saturday for brunch, it took forever for someone to come over to take our order. When she finally made her way over she barely introduced herself, never came back to check on us once the food arrived so we started eating (two different people brought our meals out at separate times and the restaurant wasn't busy so no clue where she was)I needed Mayo and ketchup and had eaten half my meal before she made her way back. Came back without the Mayo saying "we don't have any that's so weird" (you didn't know that before u walked off to get it?) Never offered to refill our waters and we had to ask for another round of drinks. I could go on but you get the idea. This is the 3rd occasion I've gotten trash service at this location. The hostesses are always amazing but it's Disinterested wait staff generally. No thanks, there's too many places in that same area with much better service.
2021-06-07,2,In general, I like Del Frisco, but this was a disappointing experience. Would knock out one star for food (my steak salad was way too salty), and knock off two stars on service. Still a nice location and host was helpful, so 2/5On service: ordered a steak salad, in 10 minutes they brought me a salad without a steak (so I asked for it); 15 minutes later got my food, and by that I already finished my ice-tea, but no one thought of a refill; no one checked on me after I got my food; was waiting on my server for a while, but ended up asking the host for the check.Will likely not dine there again, even though it is next door to my office.
2021-06-05,1,The food was good but bc of the rude waitress, I will not go again. If the restaurant wants the price of Peter Luger, they should educate the waitress how to serve first.
2021-05-23,4,Went here for brunch and had a good experience! The food was tasty and the weather was very nice. We sat at an outdoor table which was in the sun so I had to wear my sunglasses but otherwise enjoyed our meal.
2021-05-14,1,Started off with by far the rudest waitress of my life, extremely rude, not even a hello. Not once did she even see if we were okay or would like more water. Ordered an expensive bottle of wine, took a half hour to get it. Then when we finally got our meals, the orders were completely wrong. Manager threatened both my fiancé and my best man at our dinner. We proceeded to tell manager we would not pay for screwed up orders then proceeded to say after 2 hours of being there "I'll have my bouncers down the road handle you". Terrible service and completely unprofessional . Please fire manager Jason Hall. I was at the Boston location Wednesday and had outstanding service. This Hoboken location and manager were terrible.
2021-05-08,4,Let me start by saying that the bone-in ribeye that I had at Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse was one of the, if not the, best steaks I've ever had.That said, we came to Del Frisco's Grille for my brother's 30th birthday /mother's day celebration.My cocktail was great and we really enjoyed the salads (wedge, heirloom tomato burrata & brussels sprouts kale) and Cajun Lobster Mac & Cheese (special) appetizers. I love their truffle mac & cheese normally so I was excited to try the lobster mac, and it was SO GOOD and full of lobster.There was a bone-in ribeye special which I split with my sister-in-law. It was cooked perfectly rare and I assume would have been very enjoyable if not exorbitantly covered in processed black pepper (not freshly ground, mind you). This is not something I experienced at the Double Eagle Steakhouse, or any other of the high end steakhouses I've been to. Normally they will come around with a pepper mill and ask if you'd like freshly ground pepper on your steak, but the overwhelming amount of processed ground pepper made it hard for me to even tell what the steak might have tasted like.Skip the asparagus side and get the brussels sprouts (bacon makes everything better).My mom ordered the burger after much deliberation once the waitress told us that it could not be cooked medium rare and would only be cooked medium well. It was very crispy which gave it an interesting texture but the patties were insanely dry. I thought the flavor was decent though lackluster, so due to the texture/quality of meat I wouldn't order again.The waitress & the bartender were lovely, by the way. Once we were finally seated (after waiting 20 minutes even though the restaurant was empty AND we had a reservation, just because 2 of the 8 of us were stuck in traffic) we had wonderful service.The wine menu could use a little more diversity. I'm partial to low intervention wines but I would have been happy to at least see one Gamay or lighter red available.
2021-05-05,5,Went here tonight with a 4 adults and 3 kids and had a really nice time! I've been to all of the restuarants on the Hoboken waterfront and can confirm this is the best resturant there is. GREAT service! The waitress was really sweet, fast and got everything right. Even the kids ate all of their food. I can't wait to come back!
2021-05-04,5,the brussel sprout kale salad was delicious! ordered it with the salmon for lunch. perfect portion! outdoor seating on a beautiful day and friendly, attentive service made for a perfect dining experience!
2021-05-03,2,I'll give it 2 stars because our waitress made up for the whole show.I made a reservation with Del Frisco's for a party of 12. When I arrive the hostess (I'm assuming who hates her job) tells us she can't seat us until the whole party is here. I understood that but not on a Sunday when they're dead.If you're having dinner for a Birthday it doesn't make sense that I can't set up and start ordering appetizers to have out once everyone arrives. Because when we sat it took awhile for someone to even come and ask us what we wanted to drink. Not only that but once everyone arrived the hostess with the mostest sat all of the other parties before even looking at mine. I felt she was being spiteful. The only customer service I experienced here was the guy who made my reservation. I wished he was there when I came in.They messed up my boyfriends order. He ordered a 10oz sirloin and they brought out an over cooked Filet Mignon. I cut my Filet in half and only ate the top part because of how cooked it was. It's over priced and in all not worth it. The service took forever. Nothing was phenomenal. I mean even the chef at chili's understands what medium rare is. The only good thing I had was the coconut dessert. If you're going to order one thing order that but if you're between Del Frisco's and another spot I'd choose the other spot.
2021-04-30,1,Had a 7:15 reservation. Arrived 15 minutes early and asked to have a drink. They said bar not open. We asked to be seated and have a drink at the table while we waited and were told they would not accommodate that either even though restaurant was not full at all. As we walked out we said we would grab a drink elsewhere and this was a silly policy. The host followed us out and told us they are cancelling our reservation. Was for my brother in laws birthday and they were outrageously rude. Would never go. Clearly not friendly service.
2021-04-24,2,Food and service were average at best.  Prices were as if it was upscale dining.  Waiter was kind of a... not a nice guy.
2021-04-24,2,I ordered the short rib stroganoff. Got take out and when I arrived home, the dish had no sour cream and no tobacco onions. Just not a stroganoff. Very disappointed. It isn't cheap to dine here and the carelessness ruined dinner.
2021-04-22,5,Amazing food and beautiful service, make sure you try the bone in Ribeye! It's to die for as well as their lobster mac and cheese, manager Jason was great at making sure all of our needs were met! P.s yes! Order that white sangria
2021-04-20,3,I give it 3 stars for our great server who was nice and kind. We ordered steak and ribs and side of Brussel sprouts, which were all decent but I was curious about what "Oscar style" is on the menu and our server explained it is lump crab meat with asparagus on top of your steak. Oh boy was that a mistake, the whole plate wAs disappointing and tasted bland and it was only a spoon full of food. The sauce was just awful with no seasoning or even salt and pepper.
2021-04-18,3,I came here a little before closing and the service and food was good quality. I love the opened and exposed kitchen area. The Mac and cheese was probably the one of the best and the steak was ok. I prefer the bone-in but I did not see that option. The menu did not specify that it was a boneless ribeye although I still devoured it. I would return, I would just ask for more steak options.
2021-04-17,3,Staff was great, very helpful and on point. Had steak sandwich and chicken sandwich and was pretty disappointed in food quality. Every bite of steak sandwich had parts I had to discreetly pull out.. chicken sandwich wasn't tasty, over fried. Mediocre salad . Will go again (for the bar) but not order what we did this time.
2021-03-28,2,First time eating there last night. Very slow service, not the waitresses fault. My husband ordered a filet, they brought it out butterflied which he did not request so they had to redo it. I ordered the Kale and Brussels sprout salad, it came with no Brussels and no Kale, they redid it but still no Kale (it was spinach).   Would not go back.
2021-03-27,5,I had a little lunch date with my husband in this place. I had salmon with asparagus and roasted broccoli and he had steak with Mac and cheese. We had a reservation and didn't have to wait at all. Lady that was taking care of us was very nice. All together it was a nice experience and will come back :).
2021-03-22,3,Was super excited to try Del Frisco's this past weekend but was not as impressed as I was hoping I'd be. We started with the tuna tacos and cheesesteak eggrolls which were great and a real crowd pleaser. However, when it came to brunch the menu only had 2 breakfast items - a small steak skillet and steak and eggs. I got the steak and eggs off the limited menu which was $34. For the price I was not impressed. It was a pretty small piece of steak and the eggs were a bit too runny for my liking. That being said, I would definitely give this place another go to try their dinner options since that's what they're known for!
2021-03-06,5,I love this place! Been there like 6-7 times already and I was never disappointed. Service is always impeccable, food is good and the ambiance is great. This is literally my go to when I want to have a good time. Eric is the best! He is funny, knowledgeable and always want to make sure we enjoy our experience. Well done y'all!
2021-02-26,3,first let me say, the place is nice but its not what i thought it would be. there is no parking which is inconvenient. i had the cheese steak rolls & they were very salty. they don't have many options on the menu so you don't have many choices. the mashed potatoes was not fully mashed & they got hard after a while of eating. they seated me & my date in the back of the restaurant by the bar but everyone else had a regular table, which was very weird. over all the food was good, the customer service was good also. oh & they only have boneless steak & that turned me off lol. its not really worth visiting if your a real foodie. we are basically just paying for the name, the view & the location. the food & menu could be much better.
2021-02-17,3,Have been to Del Frisco's on Brookfield Place in the city plenty of times, always had a good experience. Tried out their Hoboken location and was very disappointed. Drinks and service were both very good, unfortunately most of  the food was subpar at best. We ordered the Ribeye & Filet Mignon , Cheesesteak egg rolls, mashed potatoes, asparagus, broccoli. The steaks were good, nothing memorable but good. Would definitely say the cheesesteak egg rolls were the best part of that meal. As for the sides, asparagus were oily and didn't have a lot of flavor, mashed potato's were dry and completely flavorless again, and the broccoli was by far the worst part. We ordered them thinking they would be steamed or at the very least seasoned, but no, they came completely unseasoned and were not prepared in any way, were hard and looked like they were literally served raw out of a bag. Not one to knock down a business but honestly at least from my experience, definitely not worth the price tag, specially with so many other great options around Hoboken.
2021-02-14,4,The steak here was really good. I got the rib eye with a Cabernet goat cheese butter. Was not a fan of the truffle Mac & cheese. The pasta was so over cooked that it no longer even had the spiral shape, it was just pieces of broken pasta. I got fries, don't go wrong with that although for $9 that's a bit steep for French fries. The cheesesteak egg rolls were good too. Got the ahi tuna tacos and wish they did more to it, maybe cut the meat smaller and mix it in the sauce. The service was good.
2021-02-07,5,This place is yum. From the smell of the soap in the bathroom... to the food we ate. Loved loved loved the wings. We also had the deviled eggs. They were good, but I am scared to say they are good enough and don't need the truffle. Sorry, I know truffle is a thing right now.We also got the steak salad, the salmon and the filet mignon. We also had the asparagus and the fries, all lovely. Also the coconut cream pie. It was loved completely. Nothing to complain about. We ordered the VIP drink with the pineapple their signature drink. Everything was fun. Thank you for showing what is gluten free friendly on the menu. Just need you to do the same with dairy. Either way, well done.
2021-01-05,1,Had the worst dining experience I've ever experienced last night at dinner. Took 20 minutes for our waitress to come over to us to ask if we wanted waters. Took even longer to put our drinks/menu items in. Food came. Subpar. I got the steakhouse salad- mediocre at best. Steak was cold but was fine since it was overtop a salad. Deviled eggs on the side of the salad tasted like SOAP. Just awful. Boyfriend said his meal was fine. We were there for an anniversary celebration so we figured we'd order dessert. While waiting for chocolate cake to come out, a MOUSE ran through the restaurant right in front of us. Other patrons saw, too, and questioned whether to finish their food or to leave. We ended up staying since we had already put in our dessert order. Our chocolate cake tasted as if it'd been in a bakery case for a week. It was cold, hard, and tasteless. The only star was for Rachel, a different waitress who seemed to be the only person helping us, or any other tables around. Our waitress was clueless to us and other patrons she was supposed to be serving. When the mouse was brought to the managers attention by our waitress, she said "Oh well". I will never go back.
2021-01-03,3,Came here again and about the same result . Mediocre food .. I wish we could go back to the way it used to be.... I've been there 3 times since 2017 and unfortunately it has not demonstrated its original taste and quality
2020-12-30,2,Very disappointed to hear that Meal Kits are not being offered for New Years Eve.  I was told they didn't have enough steak supply, but was also told I could order takeout (literally the same items but cooked, and at a substantial $$ mark up).  Seems contradictory and like a money grab for the holiday.  Back in the pre-COVID times, I was always a big fan of this restaurant.  The food is always good, and service was typically above average.  Unfortunately due to my latest experience I will not try ordering anything from here again in the near future.
2020-12-22,4,This place is super friendly. Before we weren't allowed to sit at the bar, my friends and I were regulars there and Eric always too great care of us. Sometimes you wanna go where the bartender knows your name...and the chef cooks a great ribeye!
2020-12-20,5,Came here for my boyfriends bday. We thoroughly enjoyed it. We weren't that hungry but I got the cheeseburger and my boyfriend got the 10 oz steak with truffle butter. We liked our meal and our waiter was super friendly and personable. I'd come back to this location.
2020-12-11,4,We went on a random mid-week dinner and enjoyed the food! It wasn't crowded and allowed for indoor seating. Cocktails are great and service was very fast.
2020-11-08,1,We were in Hoboken on a gorgeous day, and saw Del Frisco's and figured we couldn't go wrong... well we could. This place is filthy, I walked past a piece of broccoli on the floor on my way to the bathroom. This should have been a sign, as the bathroom was more like one to would find at a highway rest stop, absolutely filthy.  The food we ordered was average at best, and the drinks and wine over priced. Honestly, I have a better experience at Chili's. They really need to do a better job.
2020-11-03,3,Ordered takeouts. Food was good in general but didn't meet my expectation which was high...- Cheesesteak Egg Rolls: very yummy. Highly recommend. - Grilled Prime Cheeseburger: was okay. Normal size. - Charcuterie Board: quite disappointing. The cheese selection was way too normal and cheese itself was just so so. - Steakhouse Salad: pretty good. Very good steak and enough veggie.
2020-10-17,5,Love this restaurant. Great ambience. Great food. The tomato pepperoni flatbread pizza is good. The roasted chicken dish is amazing. And my favorite drink is the white sangria. The sangria comes with a popsicle in it and the popsicle is sooo good.
2020-10-04,4,Grabbed lunch with a friend and was extremely impressed with the service and quality of food we got from Del Friscos grille. We started with drinks and I have to say they were strong and had amazing flavor. I would definitely recommend a Bloody Mary if you're doing brunch. For apps we ordered the cheesesteak egg rolls and the pizza flat bread. If I went back I would probably Just get 2 orders of the egg rolls because the flat bread was just ok. My entree was very good. I ordered the steak sandwich with sweet potato fries. Definitely received 5 star service and I loved the food but would switch my order up if I ever came back. All in all it was a great experience.
2020-09-27,5,If you are looking for a good glass of wine and a banging burger this is your spot! Best burger in Hoboken! Love this place. The bar tenders are also amazing. Highly recommend.
2020-09-21,1,Honestly that was the biggest rip off dinner I've ever had the displeasure of having. I spent $188 last night with my girlfriend not including tip. We both ordered our steak medium rare, hers was well done, my rib eye was half well done half medium well. Dry shoe leather is a better word for it.  Her dish was one of the combos. A tiny sirloin with 3 shrimp with crab meat for $48 no sides included. Really you pay for the location here not the food. So disappointed we will never go back. You can have a way better steak and meal in general at Longhorn for less than half the money. Waste of time and money.
2020-09-21,3,After stumbling upon this restaurant due to picking the wrong Del Frisco's my best friend and I decided to give it a try . The app was the best thing we ordered . Philly egg rolls . Too heavy on the sweet chili sauce but it was good . They should of just drizzled cheese on it not the sauce . The glass of champagne was 25 dollars a cup so not worth it . We sat and waited over 50 mins for a " well done steak " for it to come out medium well !! The salmon with dill sauce was okay . Just okay ! The sides were ehh too . What took me back was the owners attitude . " You could wait or leave " . Very inconsiderate keep in mind it was cold  & outdoor dining !! We were the last to leave . The steak had to go back to the kitchen because my friend wasn't satisfied . For a first time it was ok the guys attitude sucks so we will never return to this restaurant . His response was enough !! Oh the olive oil chocolate cake was nasty as well
2020-09-20,1,Avoid this place at all cost.During my brief visit this past Friday, my friends and I witnessed a mouse roaming inside the restaurant around dinner time. Imagine our horrified expression when we saw the animal zooming in and out between the bar stools looking for food or shelter. Several other patrons saw the mouse too, and we spent quite some time heatedly discussing what we should do - should we even finish our food, or just leave immediately in disgust?Funniest thing is that the manager thought a small dust pan will catch the mouse. Also, she claims it came from the outside... I don't know, I don't buy it. My friends were so disappointed - they even told me this is their favorite place in Hoboken for date night. I on the other hand know this will be the first and last time dining at the restaurant.
2020-09-12,3,I am not sure if it is because of the covid adjustments in dining but this place didn't exactly wow me and family. There were a few things that made me knock down a few stars. First is the bathroom; in a time where sanitization is key, I was so shocked that such a highly rated place had such disgusting conditions for its restroom. It was clear that it hadn't been cleaned in months and the odor was so off putting. Anyways moving on, I got their NY Strip and sadly it was like chewing rubber  My sister got the shrimp and turmeric rice dish and she really enjoyed it. They even made it spicy upon her request! My cousin got their surf and turf dish with shrimp stuffed with crab and it was delicious but she had the same issue with her rubber steak sadly. The sides were pretty basic, nothing that would excite most --we got truffle Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. Drinks-wise, my cousin was disappointed in her mojito saying it tasted like cough syrup but hey alcohol is alcohol xD. Overall, the staff was super friendly and we had a decent time but the food was lackluster and didn't seem to be worth the price in our opinion.
2020-08-30,5,I came for a late lunch two weeks ago and the service was awesome and the food was to die for. Our original party of 4 turned into a party of 5 and we were accommodated quickly. We had that Cheesesteak Egg and the RollsTruffle Mac for the appetizers and let me tell you they know how to make a truffles Mac and cheese it was delicious. I then had the special Chilean Sea Bass with the Tomato and Buratta Salad on the side, the presentation was beautiful and the fish was super fresh and savory! The only thing the salad was missing was a little salt and pepper but that was quickly remedied, I would definitely go back
2020-08-25,4,Thoroughly enjoyed my first outdoor dining experience since the onset of COVID-19. It is easier to make a reservation by calling as opposed to a reservation app. While I was placed on a 8 minute hold, the receptionist was very pleasant and answered all of my questions. A text was sent confirming the reservation. We arrived about 15 mins. early but we were seated immediately. (You have to go inside the restaurant to check-in.) The outdoor area is sectioned off nicely. There are umbrellas over the tables and there was plenty of space between parties; it was quite comfortable. All of the staff had on masks and gloves. My date and I ordered from the Mix & Match Menu. The filet mignon was cooked to order (our server ensured this by checking by light which was a nice touch). The Petit Lobster Tail was in fact petit, so beware if you are hungry. It was delicious. We ordered asparagus, truffle Mac & cheese and sweet potato frites as sides. All were as good as expected. Overall it was a great dining experience with nice views of the Hudson and NYC in the background.
2020-08-14,3,Food is great but the service kills it.  The hostess they have aren't the brightest- or lets just say lack any sort of common sense.  Called before coming if they had outdoor seating- hostess said no.  Came by to pick up my order..saw people sitting outside eating.  I asked the hostess about it and she said 'they made reservations'.  WOW One time before, a different scenario but still felt leaving they got nothing in their heads.  It's not just looks that managers should be basing hiring on.. not that looks really pertain here- but intelligence is attractive for any business.
2020-08-07,1,I came to the restaurant after driving over an hour to be told that they can't seat us due to the rain. I called a few minutes before my reserved time to say that my group would be 5 minutes late. After arriving we were told they wouldn't seat us. A complete waste of time and energy. It was a friend's birthday. The policy should be to communicate at least an hour before a reservation.
2020-08-03,5,This place is always pretty solid. It's on the expensive side, but the drinks are great, food is high quality, and the outdoor space is perfect in the summer. Brunch is great, too!
2020-07-31,4,After starting multiple drafts of my Del Frisco's Grille review from various visits, I am finally completing one based on my recent trip.  Since we are still dealing with the "post-COVID-19" fallout, we were thrilled that the restaurant was offering outdoor dining with comfortable seating and beautiful views of the New York skyline across the Hudson River.  Upon our arrival, however, we were disappointed that there was no host staff outside, leaving us to have to open the door and speak to the staff inside the restaurant.  They also offered paper menus, which I tried to read without touching them, but to no avail.  Lastly, while many other Hoboken restaurants had hand sanitizer on each table, they only had two bottles inside.  Despite all of those issues, we mainly enjoyed our experience based on good food and service.  We started our meal with some drinks - a Huber Sparkling Rosé for me and a Manhattan for my boyfriend.  He found his cocktail strong, but flavorful, and I simply LOVED my bubbles.  The rosé had notes of strawberry, the perfect amount of sweetness, and a very subtle dose of acidity.  (Apparently Huber makes 2 sparkling rosés: one denoted as "Hugo" from the Niederösterreich area in Austria and the standard one from Traisental.  I am not sure which variety this was.)  We skipped appetizers on this visit, but in the past, I was taken with the gooey Cheesesteak Eggrolls with chili sauce and the fragrant Wild Mushroom Flatbread with caramelized onions and white truffle oil.  The Ahi Tacos had previously been another sharable option, though the tuna tartare, avocado, and spicy citrus aioli would have been better served without the heavily-fried taco shells.Since I had been eating a lot of meat recently, I opted for the Lemon Dill Salmon, rather than a steak.  The grilled salmon was prepared exactly as I liked it with a lightly salted, crisp top and a just cooked through center.  I had asked for the lemon dill aioli on the side, and they also threw in a dill pesto, both of which were very complimentary dipping sauces for the fish.  The accompanying asparagus was also roasted to perfection and not the slightest bit greasy.  In the past, I had also enjoyed the salmon over their Kale & Brussels Sprout Salad, which included roasted almonds, dried cranberries, orange segments, shaved manchego, and a creole mustard vinaigrette, but I thought a fully cooked dish would be a wiser choice during the pandemic.  Lastly, I ordered a side of the Wild Mushrooms, which had been roasted with cloves of garlic and sprigs of basil.  It seemed like the server had forgotten to include that in our list of plates to the chef, so I had to inquire about its whereabouts with the food runner.  When the dish later arrived, it had some extra oil, but was aromatic and flavorful.While I stuck with fish and vegetables, my boyfriend ordered another of my favorite main courses, an 8 oz. Filet Mignon.  As always, when you are presented with a steak at DFG, they insist you cut it open in front of them to confirm it had been prepared to your liking.  Sadly, this piece of meat was overcooked, but my boyfriend turned down their offer to make a new one.  However, he did ask for his barely cooked French Fries to be crisped more, and the second batch was excellent.  And, finally, no meal at the Grille would be complete without a Peanut Butter Bar finale.  The rectangle-shaped treat started with a graham cracker crust, which was followed by a thick layer of peanut butter mousse and a topping of Callebaut Fudge Sauce.  The rich dessert was sheer heaven for any fan of the nutty-chocolate flavor combination.Overall, this particular meal might have had a few more hiccups than usual, but, as mentioned, the service was largely fantastic.  In fact, our server gave us a complimentary round of drinks to make up for the late arrival of my mushrooms and the disappointing cook on my boyfriend's steak and fries.  I still find Del Frisco's Grille to be a much better steakhouse than one might expect from a lower-tiered steakhouse chain.
2020-07-26,4,Great place to dine and bring the group together.  They have a 3 filet mignon dish that is just amazing.  Get the mushrooms for the side.  The best thing about this place is the view.  You step outside and see the  New York City skyline and it is amazing.  So the whole experience is worth it.
2020-07-23,1,Terrible steak. Was either over cooked or undercooked.. we advised our waiter.. bill was over $300 for hard chewy steak. They didnt even offer to compensate for this terrible experience will not be returning
2020-07-20,1,Good food but NO REGARD FOR SAFETY. Not only was service terrible (left waiting 15+ min while the waitress chatted with friends, forgot our drinks, then brought the wrong main dish) but to my horror, our appetizer was delivered by a food runner that was not wearing a mask at all, and the waitress dipped the tip of the communal water jug in each of our glasses that we had already drank out of when refilling them. Half of the staff were wearing masks incorrectly with their noses out, and our waitress in particular was constantly touching and readjusting hers and then touching items on our table. To cap it off, we were forgotten a second time when we asked for the bill. It's pretty unfortunate because the location is beautiful and the tables appear appropriately spaced, but do not be fooled!! I will not be back.
2020-07-18,1,Awful service and overpriced food. They charged us $17 to add FIVE shrimp to a salad -- the overall salad cost $27! It was a normal sized salad too. On top of that, when we asked for an explanation as to how a shrimp salad could cost $27, the manager shockingly started yelling at us saying it's obvious on the menu that adding 5 shrimp to a salad costs $17.Service was slow and completely inattentive. So many better options in Hoboken than this. Will not return.
2020-07-15,5,I'm so sorry this post took so long, but it is well deserved. In May 2020 my wife and I were set to celebrate our 10year wedding anniversary. Covid epidemic grounded us, because we had plans to visit Napa Valley but those were obviously cancelled. We wanted to salvage our special day so we made a plan B, we were going to order in a very special meal and celebrate at home. Del Frisco's flagship location in the city is where we have spent our last 8 Christmas eves, so we thought ordering from the Del Frisco's Grill in Hoboken would be a good alternative. The staff was very helpful when placing my order, but truly went out of their way when I told them how special this dinner was for us. I mentioned we LOVE the 7 layer lemon cake (just amazing) and it would mean a lot to have that for dessert. Scott, who was helping me place the order, told me the cake was sold out, but they had the materials to whip up the same type of treat in cupcake form since it was so meaningful for us. Lindsay then made the cupcakes for us and they were terrific. The staff really went out of their way to make our day special and I can't thank them enough. I wish I could give 10 stars on this review. Quality of the food is always important (and the food rocks) but that extra care displayed by their staff will never be forgotten.
2020-07-03,2,Ok this place is overpriced plain and simple. But the food is good- average. You won't be disappointed when you leave, it's just not incredible. Cocktails are good but nothing special, and we usually come for dinner. Like I said it's OK for all meals of the day. This time around we came for brunch and sat outside (social distanced of course). I did appreciate that, since it was rather gloomy out, we were given a "what to do if it rains" paper that explained how we wouldn't be allowed into the restaurant but they can pack up our order to go. At least they think ahead. I do like their pineapple crush cocktail. It's like their signature, so if you go there, definitely get it just to say you have.Future husband was in the mood for a sandwich so he got a shaved steak one and the au jus came on the side as did the horseradish - this was good and we liked that because horseradish is the type of thing you're just never sure about. If you want to put it on, good, spread some.I got a salmon salad which was a nice size for a lunch portion. I enjoyed it. But again, this stuff was all very average and expensive for being a step above bar food. Don't @ me when I say it's a step above bar food because if your iced coffee is watery, you can't even call yourself a café, am I right? Not that this place was trying to call itself a café, but I think if it had to describe itself it would say it was a "chic waterfront eatery" and I would correct it and say, "no, you are a chic waterfront overpriced eatery."
2020-06-21,5,I've always seen this restaurant when walking around in HoBo but I never had the chance to dine here...until my first wedding anniversary and graduation came around and because COVID-19 was happening I had limited options but I decided to give their takeout a try since it had been bookmarked on my Yelp for months. I emailed the manager Scott right away to see what options they offer and they had a great graduation meal that included many options. Scott was very attentive and friendly throughout the ordering process. And when I went to pick up my order they greeted me and said congratulations which was very nice!!The food was absolutely delicious, we had Ahi Tuna Tacos, Crab Cakes,Truffle Mac,Filet Mignon, Salmon, and Asparagus +2 Caesar salad's. I was absolutely surprised because takeout sometimes is a hit or miss but they certainly were a hit. I can't wait to be able to come back here and actually dine in the restaurant..
2020-06-12,5,What can I say? The prime rib sandwich Is unlike I've ever come across. Wow wow wow! Thank you all for the amazing service, food and ambiance!
2020-06-06,4,Crab cake is good, real crab meat. Taco good. I'd reorder crab cake and taco. Pizza and caramel taste decent but pizza is not worth $18
2020-05-10,2,So it's Mother's Day and obviously the choices for a good meal are short.  My wife and I have had good burgers and fries for lunch here since the pandemic started and that was fine.  Today we thought we'd try something different.  My wife had the 10 oz sirloin and fries I had the baby back ribs and fries.  The sirloin was overcooked and definitely not 10 oz my ribs were ok but they forgot the fries.  The prices are high and we gave a generous tip considering all tips were to go to furloughed hourly staff and  its all take out I guess we expected more.
2020-04-19,1,While im waiting for my food in the restaurant for pickup there's a delivery person walked in to ask about his delivery order and the manager inside told him to get out only one person allowed inside and he embarrassed him so badly they need to be more professional and learn how to talk to people better than that we all human being and never again ordering from this restaurant ever again
2020-04-19,4,A little pricey but it's right on the water overlooking the city. We enjoyed our drinks, apps, and entree.  Will definitely be back.
2020-03-15,5,Heck this is a seriously tasty option for all of you food freaks that enjoy ethnic fare at a very reasonable price.The staff is pleasant and well versed in the many options on the menu.         I would strongly suggest you that you try the cocktails as they are very well mixed.
2020-03-09,2,Staff was friendly, nice rustic look, managers stopped by to check on our meal and wished us a good day, a nice wine list. Food: :-/Deviled eggs as an appetizer seemed like they would have an interesting spink or take on them. Nope, just regular deviled eggs. Ahi Tacos were ok, not bad or good. It was lunch time so we got two burgers (unfortunately they are small patties and didn't ask for the temperature). Tried the mash and truffle mac and cheese. Don't do it. Burger is grease as it is  and mac and cheese was just drenched in truffle oil, I had only a few bites and it made me a bit turned off, even though I love the dish, in general. The only dish that was amazing was the Coconut Cream Pie, we couldn't finish it and even took the rest home, which we hatdly do.
2020-03-04,5,We celebrated my mother's 85th birthday this past Sunday in a private room in the back of the restaurant. The room was great, the staff was great and the manager Scott who was our local contact was very accommodating. The food was fantastic and a great time was had by all. I never thought that I could find a perfect place in Hoboken to have a private party for 20/40 people but Del Frisco's Grille came up BIG!!!!!!!
2020-03-04,1,SHOCKED that people are saying this place is good. Have you eaten good food? Have you ever had good service? We came here for my daughter's birthday and the service was horrendous and the food was way worse. Complained and they didn't care. Wrote a letter and they ignored it. Are you kidding me -- the food was mush, uneatable and expensive. The service wasn't service, it was some one who came over, took an order, brought the food and left. DON'T GO  HERE if you want to celebrate or enjoy!
2020-02-23,1,I've been to this location many times. Last night was an awful experience. We waited 1/2 hour past our reservation time, they suggested we have a drink at the bar. The bar was 2 deep with waiters climbing around you to to serve people. One couple apparently waited 45 mins and walked out angrily. The waiter seemed to be trying his best, but the kitchen was a mess. The food took forever and our sides came out after we ate our main course. The sides were undercooked, roast broccoli dry and tasteless. Bathroom was a MESS. No hand towels, Someone barfed all over one of the stalls. For what this place charges I would expect more. This place is singlehandedly going to ruin the Del Frisco Brand (and I've been in the original steakhouse). I gave it one star for two reasons, one you can't give no stars and my cheeseburger was pretty good.
2020-02-16,5,The food is exceptional the service as well. Extremely consistent. So many dishes are just amazing and better than the same dish elsewhere. They really have it all figured out.
2020-02-08,2,Staff is polite and friendly, but service is very slow and poor. Dishes aren't cleared. Food doesn't come  hot and isn't amazing. Been here for 2.5 hours and still waiting for dessert. Don't expect anything amazing if you decide to come.
2020-02-02,1,My family went here for dinner for the first time and what a horrible experience. We booked a reservation a week in advance, 14 people total for a special occasion. We were a group of adults and children. My sister got there early to ensure we would be seated on time, while the rest of the party were parking our vehicles. They made my sister wait until everyone in the party was present. Never experienced that at any other restaurant we've been to. When everyone arrived, the hostess advised that our table was not even ready. We had to wait an additional 20 mins to be seated. How could you not prepare for a large party ahead of time?! Very poor customer service from the door,  should've known at that point this place would suck, sign #1. After being seated, I went to the restroom, not sure if anyone judges an eating establishment by their restroom cleanliness but I do, the men's restroom was disgusting. One urinal had a black bag over it and there was a stall that was clogged, the sink and surrounding area looked like they have not been cleaned in weeks. My wife told me that the women's restroom was equally as disgusting with urine all over the floor, sign #2. Waiter was polite but was not very attentive. Took forever for simple appetizers to be served, sign #3. We had to order drinks from the bar because they took forever to get to the table when we ordered with the waiter. Ordered our entrees, which took over an hour before it came out, thankfully we ordered the kids food with the appetizers. The manager came over and said our order was messed up and thanked us for our patience, left and never came back. Up to this point, all would've been forgiven if the food was good. The straw that broke the camels back, the food was horrible. Everyone's dish was extremely salty, from the steaks, to the seafood, even the brusselsprouts were salty. The best thing we ordered was the truffled mac n cheese. The waiter did not even come back to offer water, which we all needed. At this point, it was already late in the night and we were all so hungry from waiting so long, we just ate the food. Huuuuge mistake!!! My Dad immediately got a sick after eating his dish, poor guy was sick all night from the food. Some of us didn't even finish our dish because it was so salty. At this point we just wanted to get out of this place. The waiter attempted to make up for the food coming out late by comping some of the drinks we ordered, but the damage was done. We paid the bill and ran out of there. We would never go here again. We've been to Delfriscos in NY which was great, obviously we know this location was a grille but expected the same level of service or close to it. Absolute disappointment. Not to mention we chose this place to celebrate my Dad's retirement. Sorry Dad we'll make it up to you!
2020-01-25,2,Don't expect to quickly dine in; food prep here is consistently slow. Give yourself 2 hours to dine in here. If you're very hungry, I would stay away from the Ahi Tuna Tacos. They're much smaller than the photos show and not filling. If also stay away from the York Strips Steaks. They're still learning how to cook medium rare, because ours came out well done.
2020-01-17,5,We went to the Xmas show at radio city and then walked over to see the tree at Roc center. It was miserable out n pouring so we walked into del Frisco's grille to see ifvtgey would sit is earlier then our reservation. They were able to sit us pretty quick. So to start the place was very busy I'm sure a liil extra busy due to the holidays. We started with cheesesteak egg rolls not bad. Then I had a wedge salad which was very good but I got to say thE bacon cheeseburger was sooo good. Thick cut bacon , two patties , just perfect. The best part was my daughter didn't finiidh hers so I kindAA got 1.5 burgers! My dad hadd thE fish n chips which he eNjoyed highly. This place is a home run. I would def return.. sidee note , the bAthrooms  are unisex and private do they have like  6 or 7 separate bathrooms for privacy.  Almost forgot For desert we had a molten chocolate cake and a peanut butter chocolate pie which was crazy... if you like peanut buttEr u got to try this...
2020-01-04,2,The food was okay but was ruined by the terrible attitude of the server. I made a reservation for 8 and they seated us about 10 minutes early. Our order was placed shortly after being seated. We waited about 50 minutes for our food to arrive. A warning when we placed the order would have been nice so at least we would've considered some appetizers? The highlight of the negative experience came when the food arrived. The insistence from the waiter that the burger with no cheese was actually my order was humorous. He wouldn't listen to me that it wasn't my order and that it was actually my father in law's order. When he basically shoved it in my face, he got even more agitated that I was trying to pass it down to my father in law. He then snapped "what burger did you order?!". Well here's the funny part, I ordered the chicken. After a wild game of entree switcharoo, we were settled. I'm not complaining about this, it's a very easy thing to pass around dishes to get it right, so then why was the server so pissed off about it? I don't know. But by the time my mom's roasted mushroom side came, he exclaimed "who ordered this!?", and then proceeded to drop the plate on the table. Okay whatever. The food was okay, I ate it, but it wasn't good enough to negate that service experience. How can anything taste good after being treated like that? He never came back to ask us how the food was or if we needed anything, I suppose that was the level of pissed off he was. Safe to say I'm never coming back here. Come here if you like to wait a long time for food and be treated like filth.
2019-12-29,3,Came in for a birthday dinner. We were going to go into the city but everyone was tired so we had to make a last minute change. Were able to make reservations 2 hours before and were seated right away without any problems. Lay out is pretty open with a modern look, not unlike every other del Frisco's I've been to.We ordered a filet mignon, a salad, a burger, and a pizza and the cheese steak egg rolls from the appetizers. The food was just ok. The birthday boy devoured his steak so I assume that was pretty good. The pizza was just ok, I would describe it as bar food pizza. The steak rolls were a little salty but had some great flavor. The burger was over cooked, more medium well as opposed to medium rare. The fries here are a tragedy, soggy not crispy, and old-ish. Just avoid the fries at all costs. We had a couple of glasses of wine and it was just ok.
2019-12-26,2,We chose this place for a special Christmas Eve dinner. The service was good, but the food was below average. For appetizers we ordered deviled eggs (without truffle oil), and a wedge salad. Deviled eggs were bland-I could have made better myself. The wedge salad was the best course of the night. For entrees, we We ordered the salmon-cooked perfectly but not a lot of flavor. We also ordered the lobster tails. They give you 3 tiny pieces-this dish should be an appetizer not an entree! For the side we ordered the brussel sprouts-it was dry and over cooked, so we asked if we could get mashed potatoes instead. They brought out cold mashed potatoes! We ordered a bottle of sauvignon blanc from New Zealand that was $52. It was really good-but later we looked on vivino and the bottle costs $16 retail! Way overpriced for what it's worth. Wouldn't go back.
2019-12-11,4,After being in Hoboken for many times for customers visits, we decided to take the client out for steaks. Del Frisco is a prime steakhouse chain that does not disappoint. Clearly the location is not as fancy as in Manhattan or other cities but also less pricey. We had two nice bottles of wine along with some shared sides and nicely grilled steaks. We will be back!
2019-12-06,5,This place has a place in my heart! I booked a table for my family and I as I was celebrating my birthday. I had made reservations for 4 at 6:30pm but we arrived 30 minutes early. The friendly hostess said it was not a worry and had us sat down immediately. Once seated we were treated by one of the friendliest servers I have ever met. My mom and i love our cocktails and  seeing that we had issues on which one we should get, our server was more than happy to select really good ones and boy did he NOT disappoint!It did take a while for us to get some water, which was crucial since we were planning on drinking a ton, but I figured that having three large parties  in the dining room would require some extra hands so it wasn't a problem. Our food was soooo good, even my mothers salad that she ordered was amazing! At the end, our server also came in handing in recommending some desserts for our table. Because it was my birthday he gave our table TWO desserts on the house! What a guy! Overall it was an amazing experience and time! I would definitely recommend this place and will definitely be back again!
2019-11-29,5,My son and I and I had a Thanksgiving dinner there yesterday and it was one of the best Thanksgiving dinners we've ever had. The steak was juicy and the Turkey was delicious, We ordered dessery and I have to tell you the service was absolutely on point. A wonderful experience will go back for any holiday.
2019-11-25,5,This was such a great place to get together with some friends to catch up or go on a date night. The service was amazing and i regret not getting my servers name. My table shared a bottle of wine and 3 appetizers of truffle mac and cheese (must try), mushroom flatbread, and fries. For entrees we got 2 different burgers, the ribeye, pan seared scallops, and the halibut. Everything was incredibly enjoyable  and I will definitely be going back to try the roasted prime rib (which they ran out of that day) Highly recommend for any occasion!
2019-11-10,5,Del Frisco's Grille in Hoboken is Fabulous & the Food & Staff are Amazing! Absolutely Luv the Atmosphere in this Restaurant! U must eat @ this Restaurant! The Prime Rib cut like butter & cooked 2 Perfection! This Restaurant is a must 4 any Meal!
2019-11-08,3,Our waiter was exceptional and he did his best to make my birthday dinner one to remember. The place is great place for those who love steak. My husbands steak was cooked to perfection. I am not a steak lover but I did also enjoy my chicken dish. My favorite thing was the Nutella bread pudding with ice cream, it was to die for. I still rave about it and want to return just for it. The place was super loud though, not my kind of crowd, was kind of hard for my husband and I to have a pleasant conversation. But I'll say, I will return just for that Nutella bread pudding.
2019-11-07,3,Filets are good. Had to send back because we ordered med but it was very very rare and the mashed potatoes were cold. Both came back quickly and were tasty. I personally like the char on the outside of the filets but some people do not.  The sliced prime sandwich was REALLY good. Meoimi pinor noir went great with the meat and the espresso martini was tasty. 200 dollar bill but was a good night.  Desserts were good but wasn't blown away.
2019-10-29,2,Meh.... went here tonight with our logistics people for dinner. I just wasn't impressed at all. Our server was weak at best. I was waiting for a little bread and butter to be served...nada! Shared a couple ok apps, Philly cheesesteak rolls and deviled eggs. Then we got our mains, can't speak for the others but my $41 dollar 8oz filet (came with nothing)was over cooked and not a quality cut of beef. It was just edible, would have sent it back but was with clients. Had to ask for everything including the bill. Did I mention no bread and butter?....
2019-10-29,1,so disappointed I came here for my birthday dinner visiting back home  ready for a great meal and it was a complete disaster! Our waiter was rude and no where to be found for almost the whole dinner.  He didn't want to serve my boyfriend for whatever his problem was! My meal was cold and gross I had to send it back poorly seasoned. The time I got my new entree everyone at the table was finished and the manger never came over to see what the issue was ! The restaurant was not even busy they did not even offer a complimentary dessert. The host also was aware it was my birthday and nothing was done. For the prices I will never ever return ! Go to Arthur's on Washington or capital grill! Thank you Delfriscos for ruining my birthday dinner
2019-10-19,5,Had another great meal at Del Frisco's. It's the total package - great food, great views and quality service. Thanks to our waiter AJ and manager Daniele for their attentiveness!
2019-10-18,5,This location is in the building that I work in and I've never gone there for lunch until yesterday. I was missing out! I ordered the "THE PERFECT MATCH" for $16 and it was well worth it! I had SWEET CORN BISQUE with half of a  HAND-SHAVED PRIME STEAK SANDWICH. It was so good! If you are in Hoboken for lunch, check it out. Call me...I may join you.
2019-10-06,3,I dined at Del Frisco's in Hoboken with a large group (~14 people) and overall I thought it was a good dining experience but for the price, I thought the service was quite subpar. The location is very convenient being about a 7 minute walk from the train station. I ordered the baby back ribs ($29) and thought they were tasty and cooked well. A few problems though: nobody refilled the water at the table the entire meal-- I asked twice. Also, people who ordered steak were provided with a steak knife, but I was not provided a steak knife for my uncut ribs-- I thought it was a bit challenging to cut my ribs with the regular knife they provided. Other highlights: many people in my party ordered the special consisting of three filet mignons each with different types of topping-- all enjoyed. I tried some of the brick chicken dish and it was quite tasty as well. I would certainly return to try their steak offerings in hopes that the service is better.
2019-09-21,4,This restaurant is in a great location- right by the water with a great view especially if your sitting outside. I came here for a date night and sat outside, so it was really nice. I ordered one of the burgers, which was okay. My boyfriend got another burger which tasted much better. We also ordered the truffle Mac and cheese which I would recommend!
2019-09-20,4,Del Frisco's has a great location in Hoboken. They offer inside as well as outside dining. Outside has a beautiful view as it is along the water. This restaurant is impeccably clean and the service was outstanding. Most historic Burgers what you're absolutely delicious. Cooked to perfection delicious flavor and the presentation was very nice.
2019-09-19,5,Food was great! They were very accommodating and attentive. Our server Lindsey was friendly and helpful. I had been to the one in NY and had a great salad, and was really looking forward to having it again. It was not on the menu here for dinner (just lunch) but I was told if they had all the ingredients that they would be able to make it for me. I did get the greens and grains salad again and it didn't disappoint. My husband and daughter both enjoyed their meals. We will definitely be going back.
2019-09-16,1,We went to lunch yesterday at the frisco grill hoboken, to start we wanted to be on the terrace and the plants smelled like pesticides, then they assigned us a table inside where they never put the cutlery until 10 minutes after the meal arrived, we had to ask for breads because  the table did not arrive that service, we asked the waitress that if there were or not breads, she replied "we put them when they ask for them" the potatoes we ordered arrived full of oil we asked them to change them and they brought us a worse than the previous one, we asked  the meat ended up medium rare and they brought it rare, filleted and the same, the menu says that the meat is chosen and valued by its star restaurant of the double eagle Frisco, but who is in charge of this I ask, a meat without flavor, full  of nerves and lasts for 42 dollars, what a disaster of place, so much that the desire to eat meat for several days was taken away from me ..
2019-09-09,2,Fruit flies! We had a $100 lunch and were bombarded by fruit flies. Wait staff was great. Drinks and food were good.
2019-09-08,4,I've been here a few times and have had a wonderful experience each visit. I think my favorite part about this restaurant is the location and ambiance; it is located on the water in Hoboken and the restaurant is spacious with high ceilings and has a clean cut industrial-modern feel. There is also outdoor seating. Their menu offers a wide variety of options including gluten free flatbreads which are so delicious! I've had the flatbread both times I've been here; the first time the menu offered a regular flatbread and then a gluten free option but when I came in last week the waiter said that guests enjoyed the gluten free crust more so they only have that option now, which says a lot! I've had the guacamole and chips, wild mushroom flatbread and the heirloom tomato and burrata salad - all delicious! The VIP cocktail is a tasty martini style drink that has a pineapple flavor... and  is unexpectedly strong :) The only downside is that I feel like this place is a little pricey for what it is, but that matches the other restaurants on the water in Hoboken.
2019-08-28,4,I was here in May/June of 2018 when I lost a bet to my roommate. The stakes were a steak dinner...Cheesesteak Egg Rolls were as great in taste as they were in aesthetic. Highly recommend this.14 Oz. Bone-in Filet was excellent. I reluctantly allowed my guest to order it medium, but it turned out to be pretty tasty. Seasoned and cooked perfectly too.16 Oz. Prime Ribeye was my choice, and the right one. Great flavor from the fat, liberal seasoning, incredible cook (medium rare); Ribeye is generally my go to at a steakhouse and so I recommend thisTruffle Mac and cheese - solid side dish; would like to try something else next time
2019-08-28,5,The staff makes this place amazing. The food & drinks are great but the staff is the hardest working and friendliest I've come across at a restaurant. Would recommend this place to anyone. Eric the bartender is the best bartender I've come across.
2019-08-14,4,Beautiful location on the waterfront. Came on a weekend evening so it's wasn't too crowded. We had the ahi tuna tacos and the burger with sweet potato fries. The tuna tacos were great. Excellent crunch, good tuna to guac ratio, and not too salty. Burger is excellent, the meat was very flavorful and the mustard is a great touch. Would definitely come back!
2019-08-11,5,The food is delicious! Loved the steak & cheese egg rolls! I could've easily ordered another order of them! Our food was good to our liking and tasted delicious. Service was very good as well! We sat outside on the patio, you get a beautiful view of the Hudson River. It's certainly a relaxing and delicious dining experience. A must try if you haven't tried before.
2019-08-06,1,Very disappointing dinning experience. My family and I came here before the kitchen closed and I know by this time the staff wants to go home. We were seated and our server informed us the kitchen was closing in 10 minutes so we would have to put in our order ASAP. After we got our food she never came to check on us and didn't even refill our water glasses not even once. My mother had to get up and ask for more water because the servers were to busy on their phone and eating ice cream. After that we got up a few more tables to ask for straws,napkins, more water. The server didn't bother coming back once after we have gotten up looking for her. Used to love coming here for the friendly staff and food but after this experience def won't be back.
2019-08-06,5,Came here for Hudson Restaurant Week with a friend - had an amazing lunch. From the food to the service to the interior design, you can't ask for a better place to dine.Food (5/5)- For appetizers, we ordered the Artichoke Beignets and Devilled Eggs. The artichoke beignets are a must-have! Never had anything like it before and the sauce is amazing.- For entrees, we ordered the Hand-Shaved Prime Steak and the Simply-Prepared Salmon. The Citrus and Herb Vinaigrette on the salmon was honestly the best part of the meal and that's saying something. The Hand-Shaved Prime Steak tasted more like a french dip to me and I would probably order something different next time.- For a side, we ordered the Zucchini Parmesan which is so simple, but delicious! But what made the meal, was the service. Our server was attentive, accommodating to any dietary restrictions, and checked in constantly to make sure we were enjoying our meal. While the view of the river isn't the best from Del Frisco's Grille, the food and service outmatched any restaurant on the same block. Would love to return for another meal!
2019-08-04,2,I went on a Sunday during brunch time and the women's bathroom was gross. No toilet paper on any stall and no hand soap. Please check your bathrooms often. A few women in the restroom were complaining about the conditions in the bathroom. A staff was addressed about the situation. Bathroom checks at a restaurant should be mandatory.
2019-08-01,4,Perfect Date Spot..The Reviews wasnt lyin when they said no matter how you say you want it cooked..its comin out bloody lol..But It was DEF rocking..Will be going again for the bar food #MarKnowz
2019-07-30,4,Must haves:1. Their artichoke beignets is a must have appetizer! 2. Their signature sangria really is umm-aaa-zing. Makes sense why almost every table had one or more of these drinks. 3. Beef Stroganoff. I was feeling spontaneous and decided to give this a shot. This is something I would generally get. But boy do I make the right decisions sometimes. Hehe. We came here for dinner on a Sunday night during restaurant week. At first I wasn't impressed with the ambiance but the food blew me away!!
2019-07-29,3,I've tried the Del Frisco's in FiDi and thought it was meh. I don't know why I thought this one would be any better, but it was really the Hudson Restaurant Week lunch deal that convinced me to give it a try. For $20, you get a choice of an app (deviled eggs with truffle chive vinaigrette, artichoke beignets with sweet basil dressing, iceberg lettuce wedge) and an entree (grilled prime cheeseburger, hand-shaved prime steak sandwich, kale and brussel sprouts salad with chicken, or salmon). The apps were pretty lackluster. I had the deviled eggs, and I really didn't taste any truffle. My BF has the artichoke beignets, and I didn't taste the artichoke. The only thing good about that dish was the sweet basil dressing, which I ended up using for my deviled eggs to add some flavor. For the entrees, we decided to do the burger and the sandwich and just go halfsies on each. The burger was good. It reminded me of a fancier version of a Shake Shack burger. The hand-shaved steak was just dry and bland. Both come with fries (which the menu does not mention) but the fries taste old and greasy. I don't think I'd come back, even with another Restaurant Week deal. I also don't think I'll go back to Del Frisco's in general. The food is just okay and it's overpriced, if there is no deal.
2019-07-24,5,This is my favorite spot for takeout in Hoboken, I love getting filet mignon to go! The filet mignon is always cooks perfectly for me.  The outside of the steak is always nicely seasoned with salt and pepper and nicely crispy. If I decide to start with an appetizer, my favorite is the cheesesteak eggrolls which are unique and also delicious. I side dishes go I enjoy most of them including the truffle mac & cheese as my favorite and the Parmesan fries, although there is a zucchini side dish when I am trying to be healthier that is less calories and still tasty. When I have time to eat there, the Sunday brunch menu is particularly good. I wish that menu was available more often. They have an excellent waterfront location really close to the path station in Hoboken so it is great when guests come from out of town through transit.
2019-07-16,2,Went for my brothers birthday. Our server was so bad, the sommelier had to take over. My dad frequents the Del Friscos in NYC and although i understand the difference, he was incredibly disappointed. My steak had to get sent back to the grill twice until it was ready. The server wrote all our orders down wrong so the sommelier had to come back and re-take our orders. I would give it one star but the drinks were amazing the sommelier was the nicest guy ever. Wish this place had more potential.
2019-07-04,1,We have never had such a bad experience at a Del Frisco's establishment. We have been to Texas and to NYC and we had wonderful experiences at both.Jason, who was the manager, actually refused to serve us. I'm a registered nurse, my husband a retired firefighter and our cousin a very successful business owner. We are courteous and respectful clients and the way we were treated was disrespectful in every way.Do not enter this restaurant, if you want to be treated correctly.We will be escalating this complaint.
2019-07-03,3,Great service and food, but cleanliness is very poor.  Floor is always sticky and there is always fruit flies.
2019-07-01,2,I'm only giving 2 stars because the customer service was good and the sweet potato fries were delicious. Everything else I ordered was horrible! The truffle Mac and Cheese was so bad. Do not order if you go. It was honestly the  worse I've ever  had at any restaurant. It was very dry and tasteless. I also ordered salmon and asparagus and it was way  too salty. I took 2 bites and couldn't eat the rest. It was definitely a waste of money!
2019-07-01,1,Terrible disappointment. I've had better service at fast food restaurants. You can't charge steakhouse prices and provide less than fast food service and marginal food quality. I'm not talking about flavor profile. I'm talking about the quality and freshness of the product.
2019-06-30,2,So many better options in Hoboken, including food trucks. Always be concerned if the hostess seats you at a bare table - no set ups, side plates, water glasses or standard table-top. This means they have no "SOP" in place for what the service goal is - it's like "whatever, they got sat." If after you have ordered your steaks, salad and shrimp cocktail and it's been 10 minutes and you now have to ASK for silverware, and side plates and water, you realize you were correct in being concerned about sitting at a bare table. And if you won't ask for them, you will have appetizers sitting in front of you with no way to eat them and again, you will be waiting. If you never one see a manager doing walk throughs, if your Diet Coke glasses sit empty even after 10 passes by your server, again, right on target for first impression.  Also, did not see one single employee "hurry" the entire hour we were there. NO sense of urgency which matches everything else. Shrimp cocktail comes, no horseradish like I asked for, have to ask again, and then wait. Diet cokes still empty. Steaks finally come - MR is over-cooked to Medium plus and the med filet is almost raw (we will call it rare, almost blue (extra rare.))I went inside after deciding we would just go and Asked the hostess to get a manager. She disappeared for 5 minutes so I went back to the table and asked for the check with the steaks taken off, which surprised the server. Apparently he was totally pleased with how the would-be $200+ dinner was going. The fact that no manager ever surfaced was perfect. Of course the place is a total shit show, there is no supervision. He was probably in his office, on his cell phone, fucking around, instead of doing his JOB which hopefully he doesn't have for long.  If this is actually part of Del Frisco's Double Eagle, they should be embarrassed.  I am 95% a great review guy because I want people to have great experiences. The only time I write bad reviews is literally when I feel like I am saving someone else from taking a bullet.
2019-06-28,4,Great location with views of the New York skyline. Service is very good. Steaks in the upper $40 range are Prime and well cooked but not aged. Steaks do include a side. Tuna steak was perfectly rare.  A good wine list with wines starting around $40 a quickly going up. Full bar with a number of specialty mixed drinks. Can be a little noisy but a good place to dine with friends or just a couple.
2019-06-24,3,Oh man. I wanted to like it. We went to celebrate my son's birthday last night. Service was VERY slow even though the place was basically empty. I asked for my burger without blue cheese. After the second bite , guess what I found on it ? My wife called the day before to request a candle on a dessert for my son. When we walked in the hostess whispered " candle".  All good -right ?My son ordered the lemon cake to which our server said"it's the best "!  She came back to tell us it was sold out. Then he ordered the coconut cream pie ---also gone. They probably should have sent somebody to 7-11 to pick up an entenmanns cake. How do you sell out of 2 of your 5 desserts at 7 pm on a Sunday?  Needless to say there was nothing to place a candle in.
2019-06-23,4,Love Del Friscos- however this is a different vibe from the one at BFP- Food always exceptional- Service is too notch but not as reserved as BFP -  we had a great time- but on a Saturday evening- the service although not bad is busy and the volume is much louder
2019-06-18,5,How on earth does this place only have 3.5 stars???  Are there really people who dislike DFG?  The atmosphere is fun, the food is spectacular, the wine and cocktails are terrific.  What am I missing?In case it was not already obvious, I absolutely love this place.  I highly recommend the egg-rolls, the truffle mushroom pizza (best you will ever have), the burgers (all terrific) and you really cannot go wrong with the steaks.  Lest I forget to mention the best item on the menu, unless you are literally allergic to lemons, you must GET THE LEMON CAKE.  It is the best dessert ever made in human history.
2019-06-16,1,Horrible service took forever gave our food to the other table and when called over for wrong order. They took the food from that table and tried to bring it to us. When we requested new meals that were not touched she rolled her eyes and her manager ended up serving us including having to bring us the correct drinks. My sister asked a question about the meal and when she went to find out and because my sister chose something else she made a snarky comments towards my sister.food was not hot. After messing up our food offered complimentary deserts to the table left us with menus and when time to order them told us that only 2 people from a table of 5 can have free desert for messing up everones food. I ask for my cake to be put in a container kept the container upright and flat not dropped or anything come home to eat it and it is messed up. She literally dumped the cake into the container.
2019-06-15,1,On June 11 I celebrated my birthday with my boyfriend at this location and I was nothing short of disappointed after the hype I've heard surrounding this restaurant. I heard how great the food was especially the Mac and cheese. First of all the macaroni and cheese in which I placed 2 orders was disgusting. It was bland and tasteless and a waste of money.  I had to take it home and season it to actual be able to eat it. We asked for bread and received one roll for two adult people to share and nothing more. I get more than enough at less expensive restaurants and diners and to spend almost 200$ at your establishment and not be satisfied was absurd. The chicken wings were over salted and the Mac and cheese had none. We ordered the cheese steak egg rolls for 15$ and got 2 egg rolls split in half. This makes no sense and from the website the food looked better than it really was. This was an awful birthday experience and a place I wouldn't reccomend revisiting.
2019-06-09,3,I'm not going to say the place was bad but I'm guessing outside of Manhattan, Del Frisco's are held to a less of a standard. Felt the same about the one in Nashville
2019-06-08,5,Awesome food and service. Our waitress was great and very attentive. Will definitely be back.
2019-06-08,3,Del Frisco's in Hoboken is just your average chain steak restaurant. It's not nearly my favorite restaurant in Hoboken but I end up there from time to time with friends for dinner. Last night I went with friends and overall the appetizers were delicious, we got the cheesesteak spring rolls and flatbread, and the entrees were just okay.I personally didn't have the cheesesteak spring roll but from what I saw they looked nice and cheesy on the inside, fried with a nice flakey crust, with a sweet chili sauce drizzled on top. And the flatbread which I did have two pieces of was great, it was topped with 4 cheeses with a layer of green salad on top which personally I love. The crust was crispy and overall it was a good plate.For my entree I got a tuna salad which was overall decent, the tuna was cooked with sesame seeds and the lettuce component was tasty. If I could make a suggestion I think the salad needs a touch of lemon juice or orange juice to elevate the taste just a bit more. My boyfriend got the shrimp pesto bowl and said the shrimp was great too! Only fault is that it took 1.5 hours to get our entrees which isn't ideal. I'd recommend this as a "safe" restaurant if you're looking for a nice buzzing atmosphere and decent food.
2019-05-26,4,Had a reservation for 7PM, but had to wait a bit before we were seated. Once seated our server was there taking our drink orders. The drinks were very good. We had an old fashioned, a Spanish gin and tonic, and the youth serum, all were very good, not too sweet. For dinner we had a nice bottle of Boudreaux.    We asked him for a recommendation for appetizers; he suggested the artichokes. This was very light and tasty. Not too filling.    We all ordered the filet mignon, which were cooked to order. The outside had a nice crust and the inside was cooked to perfection. Perfect portions as well.   The sides were the only disappointment. We got four sides and two were bland. I would recommend that you not order the broccoli and mashed potatoes, which, sadly, are two sides you'd think get right at a steakhouse. However, two other sides were delicious, the Parmesan zucchini and the truffle mac and cheese.    Overall we had a very fine experience and I will definitely go back. The bill came to $280 before tip, kind of what you'd expect.
2019-05-25,1,Horrible. Started out by 3 different employees telling me that they were "not the host" and didn't point me to the host. Sat for 15 minutes and no one came to the table despite it being not that crowded. Our waiter made repeated trips to the table next to ours and didn't even look over at us. Was it because we had 2 kids? Maybe you should have a sign saying kids aren't allowed. For the prices on the menu, we should've had someone at our every beck and call. Note to everyone reading this: go to Union Hall up the street, especially if you have kids. Del Friscos NOT KID FRIENDLY and abismal service all around.
2019-05-24,2,The food was great, so was the beautiful day. The service couldn't have been worse.  Still tipped the waiter 22% even though the experience as a whole didn't warrant that. Ordered drinks with our food and it didn't come out until after our appetizers were finished. Biggest pet peeve is when we ask for a check and it takes longer a trip to bathroom to get it. Filet Burger was Bomb.
2019-05-19,4,Nice people, good service, decent food. I come here all the time. People are courteous and professional. They bother to remember regulars. The staff turnover is low.
2019-05-17,4,Went here during the week. They have amazing crab cakes!! Oh my so delicious.  I had the short ribs with the Mac and cheese. It was very tasty but so heavy! I think the crab cakes with Mac and cheese would he enough for next time! Not the healthiest meal.. but hey, live your life! The service was great and there is a nice view and of city skyline.  I will definitely be back!
2019-05-14,5,This is getting to be my favorite local restaurant. It really has everything: a bar scene, amazing food, great ambiance, and even kid friendly. I've been for birthdays, dates and family dinner for Mother's Day. Each experience was the same: top notch.The VIP cocktail and the sangria are both excellent, and strong. You can't go wrong with any appetizers but the cheesesteak egg rolls are off the charts good, and the artichoke beignet is also. Those are my go to's. I've had the steak, the impossible burger, and the short rib bourgignon(spelling??). Nothing fails to impress. That's why it's my favorite place to eat when I have something to celebrate around here.
2019-05-10,3,Food is 4.5 stars. Been hear three times. Twice at a table and once at the bar. I don't know what it is but the sense of hospitality and service is just not there. Oddly enough all three times we've had multiple courses and all three times we've never been checked up to see if there was anything the server could get for us or how we are doing. Empty wine glasses and beer bottles only get a refill after asking for one and that's sad considering this is a sellers environment, but maybe this side of the river it's just order takers wrapped up in a fancy establishment. Unfortunately the tip has to reflect the lack of actual service. Taking our order barely warrants 20%  it is what it is
2019-05-04,5,Staff is always professional and goes above and beyond to make every experience a great one. Never had a bad meal here: food is consistently delicious. Have been to other locations but I think this one is the best!
2019-04-22,2,First clue was that the restaurant was empty.  Poor customer service and a dry steak that had a burnt exterior.  The staff seemed more concerned that the owner arrived than actually serving the few customers that were there
2019-04-12,2,First time we stopped in to eat here. It will also be our last. We were greeted at the bar we sat at immediately which was nice. We got our drinks quickly. Both were good. We started with the Artichokes and the Ahi Tuna tacos. The artichokes were tough to eat. Not worth it. Did have good flavor for the parts that were edible. The ahi tuna tacos were delicious. Nice crunchy shell, avocado was fresh, tuna was fresh, and the flavors blended nicely together. Not worth $18 though. But it was the best thing we had on the menu. Both appetizers came out pretty quick. We ordered the burger with bacon and it comes with hand cut fries. We always order our fries very well done and crunchy. Not a tough request; leave em in the fryer a few extra minutes! Our burger came out fine. No requests are taken on doneness of the burger..which we thought was odd. Asked for fresh jalapeños on the side and they were put on the burger. The fries were underdone. They re-did the fries and they came back underdone again. We were told they looked more cooked. They weren't. They did them a third time and still the same. We ate them anyway, frustrated of the thought of asking yet another time. This whole fry ordeal took 20min!!! Ridiculous. And our bill was $78. So not worth it. This place is a rip off. And bathrooms were dirty. One toilet was broke. Much better restaurants in the area.
2019-04-09,5,Sometimes, it's best to start at the very beginning, but in this case. I'd like to start with the end of our meal.The nutella bread pudding? It's downright unfair how delicious and perfect this is.Imagine a chocolate cake doughnut, chewy, crunchy, ooey, and gooey, with a beautifully rich and dark coffee ice cream on top. I needed to be pried away from this dish. It was so good. Yum. Anyway, to the rest of the meal. The restaurant is super conveniently located, about a two block walk from the path train and right on the water. It's also plenty spacious inside. One thing I really appreciated during an evening out with people who had some dietary needs, the gluten free options here abound. There are tons of options and they are labeled really clearly.We started with the grille dip duo. It's a creamy avocado dip, which was tasty, but surprisingly spicy, and sweet potato hummus, which was quite lovely. They also give you a variety of veggies to dip, plus some gluten free flatbread. It's not your run of the mill crudite either. Imagine radishes and endives, all beautiful!I ordered the grille prime cheeseburger. Definitely a solid burger. Would come back to order something more adventurous.
2019-04-08,3,Came here for birthday celebration and left disappointed.  Plates on the table were dirty and the food and drinks were just ok.  We picked this place for the location but wouldn't go back.
2019-04-03,1,Service was terrible.  At first out waitress came 3 times in 5 Minutes. After that it took about 30 to 45 minutes for her to check on us again - meanwhile we could see her chatting to the other waitress at the back of the bar.  The food was passable but dessert seemed to come from the frozen food aisle. Then the bartender came to our table to clear up after our meal. He tossed the boxes on our table for us then snaps the paper bag open and leaves. The table next to us asked to get the food wrapped and their waiter wrapped it for them like you'd expect a restaurant claiming status such as this one.  I've been here in the past (a few years ago) and service was great but has clearly has gone down.
2019-03-14,3,Went for brunch on Sunday. Service was good. Food was way below expectations.  Ordered the crab cake eggs benedict and it was basically two hard boiled eggs on a not fresh crab cake. Tasted like they made it yesterday.  Prices are a bit high for what you get, but it's Del Frisco's so kind of expected. Will not return.
2019-03-08,4,So it started out where we waited 15 minutes after being seated to even get waters which was a bit odd considering it wasn't that busy and servers passed us multiple times. Considering the prices, the food here is fine. Nothing about the food is exceptional, you're mainly paying for the ambiance and proximity to the water. We ordered the Philly cheesesteak egg rolls which were good, but I've also had ones just as good as a $5 happy hour item at a random bar. I got the bbq shrimp Cobb which was actually really good! I would highly recommend, even though it's a bit overpriced. My group also ordered the ribs which were pretty dry, so not great there. And the salmon, which was okay. Overall I probably wouldn't go again, but it was a special occasion and we couldn't get a table at any of the other upscale American restaurants around Hoboken.
2019-02-21,2,What a disappointment, we were meeting our friend for brunch. We placed our orders , everyone got theirs except for the poached eggs, 10 minutes later the poached eggs came out cold and almost hard boiled ???In addition to this, the waitress never checked back so another server took the eggs back. We ordered POACHED EGGS again which came out warm to cold??? No apologies in any way shape or form.The waitress although sweet needs to know about the drinks and not respond with : I'm 20 I really don't drink ,but it's the most popular brunch drink.
2019-02-17,5,This is probably one of the best restaurants in Hoboken. What I love about it is that it's a great spot for so many occasions. I've come here on a date night, and this time came for my birthday with a bunch of friends.As a note, this is a Del Frisco's Grille, And has a different menu that the regular Del Frisco's restaurant, which you can find in NYC. I actually prefer the menu at Del Frisco's Grille. The truffled Mac and cheese is a MUST! I usually get crab cakes, because I'm a pescatarian, but this time I went with the Kale and Brussel Sprouts salad with Salmon, and it was amazing. The white sangria is also one of the best drinks I've ever had. Definitely order it! The service is also great - everyone is attentive and friendly.
2019-02-17,4,Made a dinner reservation here on a Saturday night. Table was ready upon arrival and we got seated immediately. I ordered their salmon. It was cooked perfectly. Only downside to the plate was that it didn't come with any potatoes or side other than asparagus. (I should have realized that reading the menu though). Our server was helpful and overall experience was great. I'd come back here again and try the steak next time!
2019-01-26,4,I mostly just come here for the cocktail that comes with a frozen pop in your wine. But the location is great too especially if you can get outdoor seating.
2019-01-26,5,Never had a bad experience here. Even on the very off chance something goes wrong with the meal or service, they correct it immediately. Personally love sitting at their bar or one of the bar tables - gives you a little more of a casual vibe but still getting a great meal and great drinks. The bar staff is always really great too and knows about their wine. I don't think it's always on the menu, but you have to get the corn chowder if you go and They also have the Impossible burger is a great vegetarian option!
2019-01-24,4,Fantastic views! The sprawling views of the NYC skyline from here can't be beat. Great service. Waitress was great & bartender friendly. Great space - nice ambience. I am not a fan of booths that seem to be popular in NJ, but they accommodated my request to change to a table. The beet salad was awesome & the rib eye good. It can't compare to the Double Eagle steakhouse in the city in experience, flavor, or options. It is more casual experience than the NYC branch. From my observation, the burgers are the popular order here. When we visited, it was empty (Sunday night)... but it was unusually cold out. We had an awesome Oregon bottle of pinot noir. I bet brunch is pretty awesome here in the spring/ summer if you are lucky enough to snag an outdoor table.
2019-01-21,4,Food was delicious. The wings were a little different style than I'm used to but the avocado ranch was amazing. We both got steaks and delicious mac and cheese. I would try the peanut butter pie ! Sooo goodThe waitress was really nice and helpful. The white sangria was also delicious. There is parking garage right next store. Great views of NYC.
2019-01-10,4,Came here on a Saturday night around 7p and the bar was open. Decided to sit there vs grab a table. It was not very crowded but gradually more people came in for their dinner reservations. Ordered a few craft cocktails which were very tasty - Spicy Margarita and a mint cucumber cocktail. Started with the Caesar Salad and tuna tacos - salad was great and would probably not order the tacos again. We both had the Cheeseburger which is one of the staples at Del Frisco's Grille. It had special sauce, pickles, lettuce and tomatoes. You can add bacon for an extra charge. I personally did not think the burger needed 2 patties but overall it was a good burger. Good place to get a drink and an app. A little pricey for 2 drinks, 2 apps and 2 burgers.
2019-01-03,4,Came with my 8yo son for a quiet weekday lunch.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  We both got cheeseburgers which were excellent.  Possible my new fave in Hoboken.  I got mine with the works which was delicious.  My son got it with no toppings which looked awesome as well.  Will be back soon.
2018-12-31,1,This place was no good at all, seem like they couldn't get my meat done as I wanted.  I ordered no pink! Not burnt or over cooked, had to return it twice.  Went from ordering a NY strip to a ribeye just cause the chef couldn't handle my order of no pink.  After a ordering twice it took me about 2 hours to finally have meal together. Never again!!!!
2018-12-28,3,Food: Steak Salad and Steak sandwich always consistently tasty. Philly Cheesesteaks rolls are good, not great. Lemon Cake which everyone raves about, the portion, makes you hate it after 5 bites. Service is forgetful to say the least, yes we want to enjoy our lunch, but remember we have to get back to work. DF is on the water, expect an expensive okay meal.
2018-12-21,5,Went for Hudson Restaurant Week LunchFood - 5/5. The artichoke beignets were wonderful puffs of joy. Each bite started with a satisfying crunch followed by the soft doughy center.  Shaves of Parmesan gave it a rich saltiness while the sweet basil dressing was creamy and complimented the fried flavors well with its earthy tones. The steak in the sandwiches reached a great balance in thickness where it was easy to eat but still had that meaty texture. The rolls were nicely toasted and soft enough to chomp down. Au jus and horseradish sauce made the sandwich even more umami with a little zing to balance all the fats. French fries were crispy and a beautiful golden brown. The nutella bread pudding was very rich with plenty of chocolaty flavors in the bread pudding itself. The coffee ice cream was at a great temperature where it held its shape but was still easy to spoon. Awesome food.Service - 3/5. The server made it a bit too blatantly obvious she was disappointed in the amount of people taking up a booth spot and the service quality reflected it. It wasn't awful but it did affect the dining experience.Value - 5/5. The regular menu item prices are on the higher side but the food quality justifies it. During restaurant week, they offer three courses for only $20 at lunch time. Great time to experience their amazing food!Parking - Street (Metered)
2018-12-12,4,Great lunch meeting. The servers were very accommodating and helped cut the tension. The food came out on time and all the plates were warm. Only complaint is the darkness in the dining room. With all those windows I wish they would have some better lighting!
2018-12-09,5,WoWza. They had the best steaks ever. Def go for the tuna tacos. Amaze balls !! Service was seamless Although it took a few min to get our waters refilled. We were so thirsty from those pretzels !!
2018-12-02,5,The service is excellent! The food is amazing and the atmosphere is great. Perfect for group or private eating
2018-11-24,5,Absolutely wonderful.  We were looking for a place that was open on Thanksgiving Day.  We didn't have a reservation but they went ahead and seated us.  We had the crab cake appetizer and it is definitely worth the $17.50!  I had the pork tenderloin dish with mashed potatoes and green beans.  My sweetie had the salmon with asparagus and sweet potatoes.  Very very very good!  And guess what.... Coca-Cola on tap!  YEAH!!!!! #PepsiSucksDefinitely recommend to anyone wanting an upscale place to eat and don't mind the more expensive menu select.  Server very nice.  Restaurant really clean.  Quick service and delicious food!
2018-11-18,2,The location is great, but the food was overpriced for its quality. The steak was okay, the sides were great (good portions and tasted delicious), and the chicken was terrible (over cooked, chewy). The manager accommodated us by exchanging the chicken for another meal at full price. Our waitress provided great service but the food took a little while to brought to the table. Overall I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone.
2018-11-09,1,Service was very polite and accommodating.Burger was actually decent too. Not sure exactly what did us in but both my fiancee and I got THE WORST FOOD POSIONING of all time the day after at the exact same time. Prolly wanna take better care of your "tuna tartar" tacos. Use ice chef, it helps preserve shellfish.
2018-11-08,5,We had a colleague from London visiting New Jersey for the first time. So I decided to take him to this place as I have been to this place once. I remember in London we used to drink and eat a lot so this place was perfect for it. This is my second time visiting Del Frisco's Grille, I like the service, food and ambience!We ordered few drinks, appetizer and main course!I had white wine raiseling and my colleague ordered beer. It was delivered to us quick!For appetizer we had sushi taco which had tuna as meat! It was delicious! Rating 5/5Mains:Short baby ribs- the dish was pretty and delicious. My colleague said they have ribs cooked different in London and meat falls apart but that was not case with this dish but he loved it! Rating 5/5Market catch for the day- i had halibuts grilled with nice charred and grilled asparagus. I wasn't sure if it was perfectly cooked or medium. It tasted goood! Rating 4/5Dessert - molten chocolate cake: this one is delicious. It comes with its chocolate cake, vanilla ice cream and wiped cream! It is devil's cake , I just loved it! Even my first visit here I had same chocolate cake! Star of the meal for me. Rating 5/5Ambience - fancy and elegant so rating 5/5Service - top notch so rating 5/5Parking - there is no dedicated parking for this restaurant so park on street wherever you get. We parked at Hotel W being a guest. Do visit this place if you get a chance! I will update the review once I remember the dishes I had from this place as I came here for team dinner once ended we nicked all fresh for the day including appetizers for group menu!
2018-10-15,5,Absolutely incredible food, outstanding service and a beautiful view. One of the best steakhouses I've been to in Hoboken.
2018-10-09,4,Great restaurant! Dining room has an open concept with the grill in view. A bit noisy since it is all open, but pretty decor. Food was awesome. Wine was picked out with the help of the wine steward. Service was great. Steak on point, with yummy seasoning. Desserts were very tasty. We had a large party so we were able to sample everyone selections. All was great! I would definitely go back again!
2018-10-07,2,This place is like Applebee's but with a better name and higher prices.Everything I ordered was cold.The flatbread was basically an Ellios frozen pizza, the crust was stale and chewy.The steak came out cold.The cheesesteak egg rolls were drowning in sweet and sour sauce. Won't be back, save your money - go to Applebee's if you want Applebee's quality food.
2018-10-07,4,Ribeye was perfect! Truffle Mac n cheese needs a little help, but not too bad. Bread pudding was one of the best I've ever had!
2018-10-01,2,The service is really terrible at this location. The food is alright, but when the waiter takes your order wrong a few different ways and there is an hour gap between apps and entree it kinda takes away from the meal.
2018-09-22,2,Was expecting to go to Del Friscos steakhouse (the one like the city) but apparently its different. Started off with the burrata salad and a white sangria, that was delicious. However, had the babyback ribs and the prime rib with truffle mac&cheese and all of it was just inedible. The flavors were not good at all. Ribs tasted frozen and dry with excessive amounts of bbq sauce thrown on top. Prime rib had a weird seasoning and covered in some kind of juice that did not have good flavor. Truffle mac and cheese had way too much truffle flavor. Was disappointed and definitely expected better.
2018-09-18,5,This place is fantastic. I recently came in with a party of 20 and they were so accommodating. Excellent service! Our glasses were never empty and the food was fresh and delicious, very well-prepared. Everyone was happy. Thanks to Jeffrey the manager for a wonderful evening and his kind attention! We will be back.
2018-09-15,3,Their dining room is lit up like a cafeteria. No way could we eat there.   So we went to the bar and it was darker than any bar should be.  Crazy. We came for dinner but decided on just a couple of apps and drinks.  We had the ahi tacos and the cheesesteak spring rolls.  Both were excellent.  And the bartenders were great too.  Would never eat in the cafeteria though.  Unless we brought a few grammar school kids with us.  What are they thinking ????
2018-09-13,3,Extremely disappointing. Sat in a booth near the bar and had the bartender as a server.  As soon as the bar began to get crowded she was MIA.  Had to track down another waitress to get our bill.  The filet mignon was perfectly cooked but EXTREMELY salty.  Mashed potatoes were nothing to write home about.  Not worth the $$.
2018-09-09,2,This place was extremely disappointing. I've been to the grille in nyc and it was great however this one is falling short. The bright spots : our server/bartender was very personable and friendly. The cheesesteak egg rolls were delicious! Awesome app. Negative : our server was completely over whelmed. There were way too many people in the bar section and bar for him toHandle. I felt bad for him, wish he had more help.My 45$ ribeye steak came out very cool, odd. I got t medium ware but it wasn't even warm. Flavorless and Chewy. My girlfriend's steak salad was kind of interesting. It looked good but the steak was super chewy. It was like leather!  Bill was pretty fair. A steak, an app, an entree salad, and 2 glasses of wine, a beer and a cocktail. $129. Eh. This place was over rated, Double Eagle would be ashamed.
2018-08-31,2,The place aims to be a fancy stake joint, but feels like a diner, smells like fish, and has a fruit fly problem... I killed about 4 of them during a single dinner there. Otherwise, the location is nice, and they have some outside seating (which is nice, if you arent bothered by cars driving by your table). The tuna tacos are indeed good. The cheese stake eggrolls are greasy, but novel.  Dinner portions are small.
2018-08-21,4,Pretty solid option for lunch and very kid friendly. Cheesesteak egg rolls are great. Service is quick and attentive. Exactly what we were looking for on a busy Hoboken day.
2018-08-15,4,All dishes were great, nice atmosphere, open-clean kitchen and friendly staff. The food takes a bit long to serve us but I could understand for a famous restaurant in the peak dinner time.
2018-08-08,5,Very good ahi tacos excellent and and steakhouse salad was great good service was in and out quick
2018-08-07,4,Finally after all the years of hearing about this place I ended up here on date night for dinner and let me just say EVERYTHING was amazeba?!s From the service of Kayla I believe her name was she was so helpful and enthusiastic at 10pm mind you it was unbelievable lol ... she helped me choose my cocktail which I loved and the roasted chicken wings YUMmmmmm I'll def be back Frisco...
2018-08-06,4,My husband and I were looking for a new restaurant to try, in our search, we came across Del Friscos! We made a reservation for 7:30 on a Friday night. Arrived a few minutes early, and were seated right away.  It's a pretty big restaurant, very family friendly, but the ambience and atmosphere is classy, and modern.  We started with two appetizers, the tuna tacos, and the artichoke beignets. The tacos were stuffed with ahi tuna, they definitely didn't skimp on the amount of tuna that went into those tacos but the beignets were amazing! And the basil cream sauce that comes with them, I could have eaten with a spoon! For dinner we went with the shaved steak sandwich and the Asian Ahi Salad. Both were equally yummy. The steak on the sandwich was cooked perfectly! The salt just needed an extra pinch of salt, but other that that, the tuna was nicely seared and the salad was far from soggy! There's nothing worse than mush lettuce!! Our waiter was very attentive! Made sure our water glass was always full, made it a point to ask us how everything was, and was diligent and fast in bringing us our food/drinks. Ashley the manager was also a gem! Stopped by, checked in on us, and made some recommendations. All in all we had a great experience, food and service were both excellent! Stop in and enjoy!
2018-08-05,4,Great for a dinner with friends in Hoboken rather than heading into the city. Sangria comes with a strawberry ice lolly, which is fun! Apps were bought out very fast which was great. Ribs were plentiful, Mac n cheese was crunchy on the top and gooey and oozing at the bottom!Fillet was herb crusted, depends what you like so watch out!
2018-07-29,5,Ashley's service was great! Food and drinks was amazing. I loved the experience for my first time at the restaurant and this location. We will be back!
2018-07-29,4,They have theeee best cheesesteak egg rolls. I've come here a handful of times & only order them. Hubby has ordered other entrees & no complaints. They make fabulous drinks, my favorite is the VIP. Perfect balance between sweetness & the amount of alcohol. My only complaint is this foul order, sticky floors, and gross bathroom. The sinks in the bathroom are atrocious!
2018-07-27,1,Probably the worst service I've had at a restaurant, ever. My friend is vegetarian and a couple of us went to dinner for restaurant week. The restaurant week menu we were given did not have vegetarian option. When she asked if what they had for a vegetarian option she was told the restaurant "can not accommodate vegetarians" that set our waitress (Nicole S) off for the rest of the night. She was rude, short, and flat out unpleasant. The manager came out and talked to us and got my friend a vegetarian option but then proceeded to gossip about us with the waitress in the corner: we voiced our opinion about Nicole S to the manager and the manager apologized but did nothing about it. The manager checked in on us one time after we spoke to her (about 10 minutes after talking) and that was it, the rest of the night she was gone. the waitress and some of the other servers at one point were standing by the register pointing at us and obviously talking about us. We all felt so uncomfortable and could not wait to leave. For a restaurant with a great reputation we were all so disappointed and definitely will not be returning.
2018-07-25,5,I visited here for lunch to celebrate my anniversary and it was so worth it. The food was amazing. The items that stood out the most were the deviled eggs, mushroom flatbread, kale salad, and of course the ribeye was seasoned and cooked to perfection. WAIT!  TRUFFLE MAC AND CHEESE...Go for it!!! Our server Raven made the experience even more fulfilling. She was attentive and ensured that our lunch date was special. I will definitely be returning with friends for another enjoyable experience.
2018-07-08,2,Waited about 20 minutes for someone to take our order. Food took a very long time to come out and was decent, but the staff was unfriendly and demeaning. Will not be coming back
2018-07-07,4,I attended this place for my husband's birthday and it was a great place to host an intimate place for his friends and family. Food was good! My husband enjoyed their Mac n Cheese. I ordered the ribs which was okay. Everyone ordered their choice of food and enjoyed it. I would recommend it as they are very accommodating for large parties.
2018-07-05,5,In the words of my friend from Hoboken, "Frisco's never lets me down!" And he's correct, every time I go to Del Frisco, I leave completely satisfied. The steak, Mac n cheese, drinks and atmosphere makes this place one of the best places to eat at in Hoboken! I've been there a couple times, and I will continue to visit!!
2018-06-23,5,First time here & loved it right now we just finished our dinner & waiting on dessert....apps were awesome...flatbread love mushrooms hmmmm hello , ( hen of the woods ) , steak & truffle Mac n cheese yes !!!!!!!!    Pretty much everything was awesome awesome!!!!........enjoying my margarita & my time in Hoboken....nice
2018-06-18,3,It took awhile to contemplate writing this review but at this pricepoint it is unfortunately a three star. We were referred here by our hotel in Jersey City. We Ubered over but the address listed is deceiving so our driver dropped us off on the next block. Thankfully it was still daylight and after asking around finally found this place. We had made reservations on Open Table and got a great table outside looking at the water. Our server came by with menus and we made our wine selection. The only issue is the water glasses they use to serve the wine. The sommelier after begging him sought out proper glasses said they were all in use by a large party. You would think this was their opening night and they still had bugs to work out. To start we shared the crab cake appetizer which waa freshly made as it didn't hold it's form which was good because it was mostly crab little if any filler. The sauce that waa served with it complimented it very well. We ordered our filets which other reviews mentioned they were highly salted and I agree. But still managed to eat my dinner. The wine helped greatly. Served with mushrooms my side was Parmesan zucchini my dinner companion had french fries. But couldn't eat them as they were over cooked. The waitress credited us for the fries. Too full for dessert we passed and just asked for the check. Location is a 5 in the warmer months nice to enjoy the views. The food overall for the money and the service a 3. It lacked any "WoW" factor. When you are spending $$$$ this is definitely warranted.
2018-06-17,5,Thoroughly enjoyed Father's Day with my daughter and son-in-law here!!!!  Had the crab eggs Benedict brunch. The bread was a bit heavy, but the flavors were wonderful. Try the Bloody Mary. Very spicy but delicious.
2018-05-19,3,Meh. Not my first choice for a good filet mignon.. third time back here and it's so so. Tonight the steak was overly peppered and charred. Fries tasted soggy. I can't say much of anything for this place.
2018-05-18,5,Great upscale casual place to grab dinner. The staff is always attentive and provides great service. I highly recommend the truffled mac and cheese!
2018-05-12,1,We live in Hoboken and tried this restaurant for a mother's day dinner. 4 adults and a 9 mo old. We walked in and two of our guests were at the bar, I asked if we could grab them on the way. The hostess says "yes and follow me". We then get to the table and then she says "oh no this table is actually for another party". Then we are seated 10 mins later and are told there are 4 people ahead of us for a high chair for our child. Please note that I specifically requested a high chair for my daughter when confirming the reservation (This is a steakhouse, eating a steak with a 9 mo old in your lap is not really enjoyable if even possible). Didn't get a high chair till half way through the meal. The waiter was not even sympathetic and told us "yeah it's basically like first come first serve" and went along his way to try to up sell us with a side of truffle Mac and cheese. When the filets came they were so overly seasoned and salty that everyone cut the edges off and all agreed it was the worst steak they ever had. I made the waiter aware and they did nothing but say "sorry about that". Needless to say don't waste your time or money (its very expensive for an awful steak). We will be spreading the word in town.
2018-05-12,5,Was always a fan of the standard Del Frisco Steakhouse locations and am pleasantly surprised by Grille . The key items from the main locations were there - including steak of course and the lemon cake dessert. Saw a few reviews mentioning poor service experiences. Hasn't happened to me, but I've never been there while jam packed.I will say I wasn't a fan of every appetizer I tried - the chicken lolipops could be done better (see Burger & Barrel in soho for an example of perfection).  But otherwise food was great. Prices are reasonable considering location and quality. An easy go to for a great meal.
2018-05-09,2,Came in on a Saturday with my wife and newborn. THE WAITRESS WE GOT WAS A DUMB IDIOT. She barley helped us.  The other waitress felt so bad that this moron was not helpful that she helped us with EVERYTHING. FOOD WAS LATE and DUMBA$$ only helped when bill was being paid, but of course the idiot overcharged us. I brought up the mistake to the other waitress who was SO NICE AND HELPFUL and she fixed it.  I asked her if she would get the tip and she said NO. Unfortunately I did not have cash on me to give her. I TIPPED IDIOT $2 on a $60 bill. I actually should have complained to manager about idiot. IDIOT didn't do anything and never came to help. WE HAVE A NEWBORN IDIOT. She really got me angry.
2018-05-06,5,Great food, Great drinks, Great atmosphere. Thanks to our server Sam ( Samantha). She was terrific.
2018-05-01,1,Came here on the first nice warm early evening of the year. We wanted to sit outside. Looked like an few outdoor tables were open. We went to the hostess, and she said that there were no tables available, but she could take down our info and it would be about 20 minutes. We didn't go someplace else because we thought it would only be a few minutes. An hour later, it's dark out, so we leave. Ten minutes later, I get the cal that our table is available. Sorry, too late, we went home.Next time be more honest about how long the wait is.
2018-04-22,1,Terrible service, undercooked food, hair in water, hair on steak, horrible
2018-04-22,2,We were a party of 6.  We were seated in a booth like awe were eating at a diner. No waitress for drink order until we finally got a manger to get us a drink.  We three courses each time the food was either room temperature or cold. Waitress played a disappearing act but apologized three times for the bartender, kitchen etc.. glasses and dirty dishes piled up on our table they were taken away in drips and drabs. At one point it felt like a Greek restaurant all around you could hear so many waiters and waitresses breaking dishes, cups glasses we counted 9. Mind you our reservation was in a Saturday at 7 pm and did not get completely served all the cold food until 10:25. Two Managers apologized two separate times but nothing actually changed, we did get a free drink because it took an hour (yes an hour) to get the second. "Bartenders overwhelmed" place was not busy just full. Bathrooms were not clean, second time papers on floor but none for hand, Puddles around urinals. Believe it or not I tipped 20% because....I DON'T KNOW! the bill was $600.00 plus funny thing though the accounting was perfect, they did not miss a bread stick!  Sloppy and hectic restaurant. Slow to bad service. Cold food. Not what I expected my first time and probably last visit to Del Frisco's. Go to a Chili's or if you really want to top that, as one person walking by our table said go to the Outback.
2018-04-21,3,The location is lovely right on the water but everything else is a bit mediocre. Certainly no better than The Cheesecake Factory. Unfortunately, the service was pretty bad. We only saw our waitress when she was bringing our food or drinks. No check in to see how we were doing. I'm not quite sure if they understaff busy hours or do not properly train their waitstaff, but either way they service is sub par. It also took a really long time for our food to come out. The waitress commented that the kitchen was backed up. There are way better places to eat in Hoboken than here, don't waste your time or your money.If you really want to come here, come for drinks and the Nutella Bread Pudding (the dessert was the saving grace of our meal).
2018-04-15,1,The location is really great especially on a nice day (since it's right on the water). The inside was really nice also.We had reservations for 7:45 and we were seated at that time. We originally had reservations for 7:15 but were stuck in a lot of traffic- they were so accomidating and moved it down for us. I have to be honest. We waited FOREVER for everything. Drinks. Appetizers and then actually waited over an HOUR for our entrees. The resturant was busy but I have seen way more busy places with better service. The whole time we waited for our meals (1+ hour) no one came over to us to apologize or ask if we needed more drinks etc. This place is not worth it for the money. What-so-ever. I have paid less for beyond more impressive food. It was so so so soo seasoned it was hard for everyone to eat. The fries that came were sobbing in oilAND someone else at our table got a pasta dish and the noodles were HARD. I also don't care how much I pay for food as long as it's good. Again- not worth it for the money. Don't waste your time.
2018-04-15,2,I came here for brunch on a Saturday afternoon, and probably won't be back. First, they said our party of 7 was too large to seat outside, which was the main reason we went there, and got there early.  They could easily have moved two tables together. Second, we ordered carafes of mimosas, and it was 99% orange juice, 1% champagne.  We kept asking for extra champagne to add to the carafe.  Third, the food was ok, nothing to rave about.  I ordered the burger and it was fine. I got mixed greens with the burger and had no dressing. Fourth, the staff/management/kitchen seemed hectic and unorganized. The service was incredibly slow, and we could see that other tables around us were complaining also.I don't see many reasons to come out of your way for a meal here, other than the fact that is near the water.
2018-04-14,4,Had a great meal today - short ribs with noodles and my husband had the best spareribs! Sooo sorry they don't serve the red sangria anymore!!!! I had the white sangria and it was just ok!
2018-04-11,3,You are probably paying more for the view, rather than the food - located right in the water. Ordered the grilled prime cheeseburger and it was good; however, nothing that will blow you away, especially for $16. The starlet of the dinner was the truffle Mac and cheese. It was decadent, silky, melt in your mouth Mac and cheese. Highly recommend, even though the side is $9.50. The place is large and good for groups with plenty of seating; swanky uptown ambiance. The bar gets crowded and service was sub par. Overall, acceptable time at Del Frisco's, just expensive.
2018-04-10,5,Probably one of the best-prepared steaks in Hoboken! From the service to the atmosphere to the offerings, everything about this place is worthwhile.
2018-04-02,5,Great service ( thanks to Hope ! )Plenty of tablesFast serviceLots of choices on the menuClose to the water ( great view of Manhattan )Highly recommend
2018-03-31,5,Great view, friendly server, delicious food (we ordered Wild Mushroom flatbread and Lemon Pancake), reasonable price. There is really nothing to complain about. We have been living in Hoboken for 2 years but haven't tried this place until today, mainly due to the mediocre reviews on Yelp. We normally go to Halifax but the service there has been going downhill (we had to wait longer and longer for the food, especially for the weekend all-inclusive brunch). I'm a little surprised why this place does not have a higher Yelp rating because based on our experience today, this place deserves nothing but a 5-star.
2018-03-30,5,What a great restaurant! Service was attentive and very helpful.  Drinks were great and the food even better.  I had a filet mignon with mac n cheese and broccoli sides.  Broccoli wasn't charred enough but it didn't deter us from eating.  Desserts  and starters were all yummy! I would definitely go here again.  My boyfriend's ribeye and mashed potatoes were one of the best he's ever had.
2018-03-15,4,steaktip salad was amazingly good -- truly a deloght with the salad, deviled egg, steak, tomatoes and mixed greens.service was decently attentive but not as on the ball as other steakhouses I've been to, but it was lunch hour in hoboken...drinks were ok but not amazingagain, that salad was pretty off the charts so everything else, byegones.
2018-03-12,5,Came here with a girlfriend on a Thursday night for apps and drinks. I was pleasantly surprised how good the food and service was considering their yelp reviews were not the best. Our waiter was friendly and helped me make drink decisions when I was being indecisive. THE DRINKS ARE AMAZING. I would love to come back here to try more food from their menu, maybe even some dessert.
2018-03-10,5,Amazing experience! the place is nice, the staff are amazing, the atmosphere is magnificent! Thank you so much!
2018-02-26,5,LOVE this place! Everything is always delicious. The management and servers are AWESOME. We had a bit of a wait for our drinks because they were out of martini glasses. The manager Chris A. brought them over, introduced himself and informed us they were complimentary! He is very hands on and truly cares about their customers experience. At the end he gave us his business card along with another card for a free appetizer on our next visit. This is the BEST dining experience in all of Hoboken.
2018-02-18,5,Delicious food & excellent service!! We had seafood and steak and both were spectacular. You definitely need a reservation!
2018-02-15,5,Every restaurant looked empty tonight except for here... so we knew it had to be good! The cocktails were great! We didn't end up getting entrees because we split 4 appetizers. All soo yummy! And we've never had a better waitress - Natalie is the best! P.s. the Nutella desert was amazing.
2018-02-15,5,Four of us came here on Valentine's Day, and we all left this place with full bellies and very happy. We made reservations the day before with no problem, and when  we arrived we were seated immediately. Lilly was our waitress and she was very attentive and possessed great customer service skills. We received our appetizers and main course quickly despite the fact that the place was packed. Everything we ordered was flavorful and very filling. The white sangria with the popsicle was deeelicious!! What a great experience! I wish I could give this place more stars
2018-01-29,2,Good service, nice atmosphere but the food is hit or miss.  At my table (for brunch) the eggs were overcooked but the meats were tender.  The ham on the eggs Benedict was way salty but the drinks were good.  Some of the bacon was crisp and some was awful chewy.  I expect better consistency for the prices they charge.  I would argue even Cheesecake Factory has better food overall.  I do not recommend unless you're just having drinks.
2018-01-28,3,I shouldve read the reviews on this place before we came because its nice, the service is great and i love the location but the food is what everyone else is saying, its decent but nothing to write home about.We started with the steak eggrolls which were good, really liked the sauce.I had the salmon with broccoli and my husband had the steak sandwich for our main courses. I didnt find the salmon very tasty, my husband thought his was good but probably not worth the price. It was a sort of expensive price for an okay meal.My husband did love the red sangria drink he had though!

2018-01-25,4,It's a HUGE, casual restaurant that can accommodates large groups. It was a super busy night when we went but was accommodated to our table right away since we had a reservation. Instead of ordering A La Carte, we decided to do restaurant week 3 course menu for $40 per person. The food was good but my entree took about an hour to come out since the kitchen was backed up. The minute I was about to lose my patience, the food came out. (Thank God) The service was great and I had nothing bad to say about the service we've received. The parking was hard to find so we decided to park in the structure for $17 for 2 hours. The moment we came out from parking and walking towards the restaurant, that's when we saw all these empty parking spots in the street. (Talking about timing) The view all around was beautiful. With all NYC skylines and water, I'm starting to love New Jersey even more and more each day. They even have a small pier/bridge where you can take some good pictures of NYC. I would probably go again near the area to try out different restaurants nearby prior to dining here again.
2017-12-23,3,A very weird vibe at this restaurant. The lighting is way too bright. Almost like eating at food court in a mall.  The cocktails were average. My wife and I each had a steak. Both were cooked to the right temperature but they are very over-seasoned. It's like eating a pile of pepper. The service was also average. Overall- average
2017-12-13,2,I've been here a thousand times before but typically just walk in (I'm local and the restaurant is big). But earlier this month I knew a bunch of friends were visiting for a holiday party in town and scheduled a large brunch reservation ahead of time. I started for 8 people on open table, then a few days later even more people wanted in so I tried to increase the reservation online but open table kept saying Del Frisco's was FULL. So I went old school and I called about my change request and was dealt with without a problem by the hostess. On the day of our brunch reservation, DF called ahead to confirm my reservation (I thought, wow they must be crazyyyy busy) and I said yes the party was still attending but it would be 7 People instead -- no problem. When my friends arrived first they were met with resistance about being seated ahead of the rest of the party being there. BUT THE PLACE WAS 93% EMPTY. So they ended up being seated after some insistence. By the time I arrived, our meal and service were great -- until the end, it took a good half hour to get our check as the day got busier (casually looking for the waitress turned into really needing to flag her down). So my complaint is really about why they're so off with reservations (I still love the food and service and will go back) but something on the backend really needs to be figured out.
2017-11-28,3,The food is good here but the service is spotty. We've had situations where people have been seated or served before us that came in the door after we did and other times where the waiter or waitress disappears. Other than that the food is consistent and prices are fair
2017-11-24,5,I do a lot of corporate lunches here and so far calamari appetizer is my favorite, the philly egg roll and tuna tacos are delicious also .  My favorite meal so far is the burger ( I can get away with it sometimes ) and the crab cake is one of the best I have had but there cream is spinach to date is my favorite from any steak house .
2017-11-13,3,This review is very simple....This place looks the part but the food just misses the mark. The one exception is the cheese steak egg rolls which are one of the best appetizers you can have.Other than that the food is very average. The burger was overcooked (i ordered it medium). The fries were cold as well.My wife got the salad with steak in it and it wasnt very good either. The steak was chewy and overcooked.The layout is great... open, chic, modern.... however the food is not up to the same standard.
2017-10-28,3,I have come here several times, sometimes with the girls and sometimes on a date. It's very hit or miss. Sometimes things come out quickly and well prepared and other times the same dishes come out cold, over cooked and advice is lacking. They have a good vibrant bar scene if you go on the right night. The restaurant is overlooking NYC so if you are sitting outside or near a window you have a great view. The tuna tacos are solid. Cocktails are pretty good. Deviled Eggs are probably my favorite. Guacamole is a pass but then again it's not a Mexican restaurant. The wild mushroom flatbread was good, well cooked and tasty.Place is on the more expensive side for Hoboken, but still very reasonable.
2017-10-27,2,Just OKI do not know (and it probably was just me), but I just got a weird vibe from this restaurant. First, upon arriving the hostess mentioned that the restaurant was really busy and that it would be a wait for a table. Ok, no problem that was to be expected on a nice Friday night during the summer. But . . . many of the tables were empty. Ok not a huge deal, because the tables probably were reserved. Throughout the night many of those tables filled up; perhaps, many of the RSVPs were no shows. Perhaps, the waitstaff was a short for the evening, but the food and drinks seemed to take SOOOO long to arrive to the table. Our waitress was really nice but it seemed like something was off, because she was somewhat forgetful. Again, she could have been stretched thin. I had the fish n chips, and the dish was really basic, because the dish kind of tasted like fried air.The food was edible and the place is very good for accommodating large parties (especially parties with children), but it was nothing out of this world amazing.
2017-10-21,3,I like sitting at the bar at most places you get a better feel of the aura and vibe.   This time it was very fruitful.     The bar was very busy as I sat near the entrance/exit for the bar staff.      It was packed with all sorts of people so a lively place.   The high tops and booths around the bar were always filled.     Bartenders were attentive but very busy and had little time to do what bartenders should do: converse with the patrons.       I had a drink then ordered the lettuce wedge and the prime rib (MR).    I was interested to see what that looked like as I have known it to be a cut that is usually clean... meaning not charbroiled.     Well I was a little worried after the couple next to me had to send their prime rib back 2 Times.   Once Over cooked then under and third time they kinda settled,  they asked for Med Rare.    I had my food before they got their steak (on a side note they ordered before me).    They had every right to send it back because it was not cooked correctly and I could see the color of the steak each time they cut the meat.     Of course a manager stepped in and comped the whole meal but said they would have to pay for desserts if they wanted them!!!!   That blew my mind.   Any way, my steak was perfect with the broccoli side.    The cut was charbroiled a first for me but  a good different.    All in all I was pleased with the meal.   I think the menus needs some shrimp cocktail and I would be there more often.     The ambiance and the feel of the place coupled with the NYC skyline view was a plus.     Allow the bartenders more interaction with patrons is advised.  The establishment keeps the feel of an upscale eatery in NYC while you are in NJ!!!!!   Other than the mishap of my neighbors  meat temperature it would be a 4
2017-10-16,4,I came here to celebrate my birthday on a Saturday night. First off, the restaurant is not right off of River road. It is at the corner of Frank Sinatra. It's a cool, swanky place from the outside but when you walk past the hostess stand, you get a mixed feeling of the restaurant's vibe. It's a little higher end but there are a mixture of booths and tables. The booths were small for a group of 4 people. It felt like a regular chain restaurant incorporating booths into the dinning room. I dont know,  just a weird layout to the place in my opinion. (Mind you, the booths are located in front of the open kitchen. It was hot in there! ).. Food: it was good...The cheesteak eggrolls- a must! The signature VIP drink, truffle mac and cheese, and jalepeno-bacon mashed potates are alll excellent!!! ...Everything else was okay. (Prime rib & chicken dish are among the "okay" category)... overall a decent place if you want to try something different... won't be going out of my way to come back here though.
2017-10-06,1,I went here for my boyfriend's birthday. The food was pretty good, but they rushed us through our appetizers to our entrees to dessert. We didn't end up getting dessert because we felt so rushed through our meal. Will not be back, we expected a much more intimate experience.
2017-10-04,5,I came here with one of my friends after scrawling through Hoboken to see what to eat. Atmosphere    was excellent not to loud music was on beat, service was amazing, food was mouth watering  and most importantly drinks were heavenly sweet  red wine of course I am a wine girl :) any-who, I would recommend trying this place out I will definitely be coming back :)
2017-09-16,4,We had a great date night dinner. The location next to the river with NYC views just steps away, makes for a great after dinner walk and chat. But the dinner, was great. If you like Rib-eye, then you need to try this place. I can very honestly say it was the best steak I have had since we move to the greater NYC area. Seasoned and cooked to perfection, great char and overall texture. A very good, super prime cut. The steak was 5 star and everything else 4-5 star, including the service and attentive management. Recommended.
2017-09-10,2,Was very excited to try this place. Was our first time there. We waited a very long time for service. We finally got served drinks and our appetizer. We finished our drinks and our app. Plates and empty glasses sat on the table for 20 minutes. At this point we wanted to order dinner but our server was no where to be found. So we went online to look for another place to eat dinner. Server finally came around and asked if we wanted another drink. We asked for the check instead. I will not return or recommend this place.
2017-09-06,3,Del Frisco's is decent. Your experience will depend greatly on the night you select and the food you order. My review is based solely off dinner experiences over the last 6 months.There are some excellent food items on this menu. In my experience, the meat-based items are good -- burgers, steaks, chops. I've found they're cooked well, seasoned appropriately, and pretty dang tasty. The seafood items on the other hand, meh. I would personally avoid those when dining here. Can't speak for the salads myself, but I appreciate the options provided and they do *sound* tasty. Wait staff is hit-or-miss. For every knowledgeable and attentive waiter/waitress, there's another that chats idly by the register while I watch my food get cold from afar. Again, this stuff is nearly impossible to prevent but just good to be aware of.Otherwise, the atmosphere is cool, and the cocktails are good. Overall, it's a decent place but nothing to write home about.
2017-09-04,4,One of my boyfriend and I's go to restaurant for date night. Great selection of wine, liquor and beer.Fast service. The cheesesteak eggrolls are our favorite but for $8 appetizer the amount of steak in them recently has been scarce. They are delicious though!As for entrees my favorite is the prime steak crusted in mushrooms or the brick chicken. The nutella bread pudding is to die for if you can make room for dessert. Overall a fav for dinner. Wish they would switch up some of the entrees though and keep the favs like the eggrolls.
2017-08-31,4,I went here on a Wednesday night with a couple people and we had a great time! I've lived in hoboken for a while now, but have yet to try this place out. They were accommodating from the start. They let us sit on the couches for drinks while waiting for our table (also outside) to be ready. I had a Moscow mule and the Redeemer, both excellent. My friend got the white sangria and said it was to die for. We were seated in less than 20 minutes. We shared the cheese steak egg rolls (amazing) and truffle mac and cheese. I ended up getting their classic burger and was so pleasantly surprised. Great food, cool atmosphere, fun drinks. Our waiter, Alexis, was friendly, honest, helpful and attentive.Food recommendations:The grille burgerSteak saladMushroom Pizza
2017-08-29,2,Nothing was -bad- just nothing was that -good-.  Call it two and half stars....Service was great. Great location on the Hoboken waterfront with plenty of outdoor seating.  Food is just meh,  the shrimp on the shrimp and grits were overcooked and dry, meatloaf is  over-herbed with sage, tasted like stovetop stuffing.    Grilled artichoke was very nice,  deviled eggs are served cold enough to have little flavour, other than a dose of truffle oil.    White sangria with an fruit ice-pop was very good.   Pretty expensive for the what we got, but that's to be expected waterfront.   ~100$ for dinner for two with two drinks each.
2017-08-16,4,Delicious salad with seared tuna. Perfectly cooked. Waitress made great wine recommendation.  Very comfortable seating and friendly staff.  Nice view of water and NY skyline. Definitely recommend.
2017-08-16,3,We ate here last night for the first time.  Nice, open setting on Sinatra Dr.  The steak and roasted corn chowder got positive reviews, but the salmon (and/or the vinaigrette dressing) was ridiculously salty.  I'm usually not one to complain about saltiness, but this was almost unpalatable.  We had a Rhone-style Grenache-centric wine from Australia that was inexpensive and satisfying.8/15/17: Six of us here for dinner last night (we've been here many times between Yelp posts).  Service was very good and especially cheerful.  Appetizers were great -- especially the cheesesteak spring rolls and crab cake.  Sangria was a popular beverage choice and our Qupe Syrah was just OK.  Dinners consisted of the meatloaf, brick chicken, steak salad (conveniently halved) and short ribs; all were well received.  This place is a little loud and a little expensive, but still a nice spot on the river.
2017-08-13,5,Great food and great outdoor space!  fun drinks - good apps and meal.  Great  friendly service.  Didn't rush us out - we got to enjoy the beautiful weather.  We will definitely be back!
2017-08-03,2,If it wasn't for the amazing location on the Hudson River, with a breathtaking view of Manhattan, Del Frisco's would probably be out of business. The food was below mediocre- I had the roasted chicken which was like eating a piece of cardboard and the potatoes were equally uninspiring.  The service was inconsistent, friendly but would go long stretches without checking on the table (a large group but pretty low maintenance).  The Truffle Mac'n Cheese was amazing!!! One star for that, one for the view - that's it.
2017-07-27,5,This is one of my favorite steakhouses in Hoboken. It's perfect for a date night, as it's atmosphere is more polished than your average bar. Their cheesesteak eggrolls are a must have and if you like seared ahi tuna, they prepare theirs just right.
2017-07-25,5,This place is amazing - it's right on the water and is a large restaurant with a beautiful ambiance, which is not the norm for Hoboken. We had a New York Strip Steak and a Steak Sandwich, and both were phenomenal. They have a full bar and all the drinks are amazing (especially the sangria). Pricing is high, but the food and portions make it worth it. Highly recommend!
2017-07-20,3,It takes an hour to get mediocre food which is sad. Too bad because the bar is cool :(
2017-07-14,3,There are just some "chain" restaurants that know how to provide a good overall experience for their diners - Del Frisco's Grille is one of them.  My sister and I went for an unplanned girls night out and we were told that a table for two on a Friday night would be a 30 minute wait.  Not bad, so we gave our number to the hostess and walked across the street to wait by the water.  Unfortunately, after 40 minutes we weren't given a call, so we walked back to the restaurant to inquire about the status of our table.  The hostess who had taken our name down didn't know what to do, so the hostess to her right searched for our name in the system and that's when we were told that a table was just getting cleaned and that they would seat us at that table once ready.  So about 5 minutes later we were seated.  Total wait time - 45 minutes.We were seated in one of the booths by the kitchen, and to start our evening, my sister had a glass of rose and I had the sangria.  The sangria came with an ice pop, and the ice pop had fruit frozen into it that were released as the ice pop melted into the drink.  Unfortunately, I had ordered the sangria thinking that it would be more like the drinks available at the Loopy Doopy Rooftop bar in the city, and this was nothing like it.  It tasted fine, but the drink was weak, and would have fared better had it been a regular sangria with the right amounts of fruit and alcohol already in the glass.For started we shared the Cheesesteak Eggrolls and the Truffled Mac & Cheese. The Cheesesteak Eggrolls tasted great, but I would have preferred if they hadn't already been drizzled with sauce upon plating.  The sauce was a sweet and sour sauce which I could have done without, and having the sauce on the side so the diner can dip to taste would have been nicer.  The Truffled Mac & Cheese was delicious - the cheese was gooey, and the scent of truffles matched the taste of truffles that was infused into the dish.  I personally love a good mac and cheese, and this was delicious!For our entrees my sister and I respectively got the Shaved Prime Steak Sandwich and the Ahi Tacos.  The roll on the Shaved Prime Steak Sandwich looked doughy to me, and there was only a bit of au jus in the cup, but my sister enjoyed her dish.  Unfortunately, we had so much to eat as appetizers that she wasn't able to finish and packed the rest to go.  Our server was a doll however giving extra au jus dipping sauce and packing up the left over Truffled Mac & Cheese as well.  The Ahi Tacos were small, but just the right amount given all the starters that we had munched on.  There was no skimping on the tuna tartare, it was a very generous portion in fact, and just the right amount of avocado.  I was very pleased with the tacos, and happy that I had chosen to eat them as my entree instead of as an appetizer.  Finally, the service.  Our waitress reminded me of your stereotypical "surfer girl."  A bit space cadet like in her demeanor, but very friendly and attentive to everything that we needed.  Unfortunately, we needed to ask for everything we need from place settings, glasses of water, and extra napkins.   Wish I could give Del Frisco's Grille a 4/5 stars, but while the food was good, unfortunately the service as a whole from start to finish was a tad subpar.  I would definitely go back though as overall, my experience was good.
2017-07-11,2,Came here with some friends for dinner. The food was good but very slow service. We ordered drinks when we sat down but they weren't brought to our table until after we got our entrees.
2017-07-04,4,If you go to Del Friscos, you MUST get the cheesesteak egg rolls. They are out of this world!! Filet mignon never disappoints, but their sandwiches are also a great alternative if filet mignon isn't in the budget. I'm also a huge fan of the short rib stroganoff - fantastic! Reasonably priced drinks, excellent service, and a swanky ambiance round out this place to be an overall slam dunk dinner spot!
2017-06-30,5,One of my favorite spots in Hoboken. Awesome location, great food, and an even better staff!Everyone (bartenders, managers, servers) is so nice and extremely attentive.
2017-06-29,4,Really really solid spot for food in an upscale but casual atmosphere.  Service is always fantastic, and it has offerings for both steak and non steak lovers.  Wine list is exceptional if you like California wines, and prices are very fair for wine by the bottle.
2017-06-28,3,Solid 3 stars-wish it was a 4 like some of its counter parts in NYC.  We've come here for dinner and lunch (as well as drinks and apps) several times over the last year.  Here's the review of what those experiences added up to...Pro's:  outdoor seating (and lots of it), bar area with tables (that are first come first serve in case you get shut out via open table), a pass through kitchen (so you can see them at work), great view of NYC from the front, and nice bathrooms (spacious, clean).  Drinks are a short turnaround time, and their menu has a decent number of options.Con's: every time we've gotten a steak, it hasn't been cooked correctly (so we've had to send it back-they fixed it though), the prices are a bit high for what you get (it'd be more worthwhile to go to the city and go to a regular del frisco's vs this more casual and limited menu grille iteration).  It's decent, and worth it for apps/drinks, and outside seating.
2017-06-19,4,Went to lunch with a group of work people.  Food came out very fast and fresh.  I had the steak sandwich and it was great.  Very fresh and tasty fries very hot and fresh and perfectly cooked.  Great spot for work lunch if in the area
2017-06-15,4,This is my favorite place in Hoboken for drinks/apps at the bar. They have a big wrap around bar that looks out over the river and lots of fun cocktails on the menu. They even have something called the "adult milkshake" which is a decadent boozy treat. The beer selection is a little light but not bad and they have plenty of wine to choose from.
2017-06-10,2,Loud place. They also seem to make you wait past your reservation time for no reason. Appetizers (mozzarella and kale salad and spring rolls) were good. Entrees were blah. Porkchop was tough and dry, even though I asked that it be cook medium. By the time waiter checked back, everyone in my party was done eating, so I was not able to eat. He was nice enough and gave us dessert in the house. The desserts were all very good. Not sure that I would come back here though. Too many good places I. The area or across the river.
2017-06-08,3,Honestly this place is pretty overrated. The location is the only thing that I love about this place. I wish the menu would have more options (especially the salads)
2017-06-07,5,Amazing food and service!!! I have eaten at high end restaurants and I have yet to experience the service I received at Del Frisco Grille. Ley was our server and she was the best! Hands down! Our appetizers came out really quick as well as our food. We had the Cheesesteak Egg Rolls and the Prime Cheeseburger which were delicious. What made my experience so great was not just the food but the service we received. Ley, not only took care of us but even sent us a personalized thank you card to our home. I have never received something like that anywhere else. I will definitely recommend this place to everyone I know.
2017-06-01,4,Impeccable service and food. They make you feel like family! The food came out quick and it literally melted in my mouth! We had the crabcake, steak eggroll, steak, and pork chops. The coconut cream pie was to die for!  Each dish was enough to share with another person. The only down side was the bathroom. I went into one of the unisex bathrooms and it was horrific!!The toilet paper was not in a wall dispenser. It was sitting on the handicap rail. The floor around the toilet was soaked with urine. The room is scantly lit so its very hard to see. Anyone with low vision would have a problem. For an establishment at this level, basic sanitation should be maintained in the restrooms. The toilet paper should be in a dispenser.
2017-05-31,4,Love this place. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because their steaks are too salty. They are cooked to perfection, but they have too much salt rubbed into them. MUST try the truffle mac and cheese, HOLY SMOKES.
2017-05-28,2,The food is comparable to a good chain restaurant like houlihans  except the prices were astronomical. Don't order the salad with the thick cut bacon. That was a joke, it was 2 thin pieces of cold bacon on top of what looked like bagged lettuce, the steak was good but not worth the 65 they charged. Server was in la la land brought out salad with no dressing waited 30 minutes for dressing and when it arrived it was the wrong one! This place is bit of a noisy hot mess with staggering prices, your better off going somewhere else.
2017-05-27,4,Fantastic location on the Hoboken walkway . Great location if you want to have a great view of the NYC skyline , River & Harbor. Parking is 2 hour max at local meters that are scarce. Restaurant is extremely well maintained and a nice conducive space. The food was above average, nothing over the top. Service was extremely insightful and friendly . Professional staff and presentation. I found the menuOverpriced for the quality of food they serve . They absolutely  make up for it with service and location. Average dining experience in a wonderful town. Explore Hoboken! ! !
2017-05-19,1,This was probably the most unpleasant encounter we've had at Hoboken and we regularly go to this area. People who came to be seated after us  received priority before us even though we waited our 30 minute wait time! No these people did not have reservation as I was standing there for the conversation and they were walk-ins just as us. We watched people before and after us get seated while we foolishly waited. Let's just say we were the only colored people in this restaurant and it was not a good look. One star was provided for the kind waitress who served us. Will probably never go back or recommend this place.not rating the food as our appetite was lost after this experience; had our meal and left baffled.
2017-05-15,5,Service was great, food was also awesome. Loved the truffle Mac and cheese! And their cocktails are yummy
2017-05-07,5,My first visit. What a nice dining experience. The ambiance was alive but stylish. Staff was pleasant,  helpful with choices due to food allergies. The Rib eye steak and sides were perfectly cooked. Will definitely return and recommend!
2017-05-03,1,Awful. Finishing up lunch here bc my friend wanted to go here. I did not. She was rude, short and literally threw share plates at us for our appetizer. (Female Asian bartender). We still left a 20% tip even though the service did not merit it. I gave 2 stars because I came here once before and the bartender was very sweet and knowledgeable. Even though I only grabbed a salad during a quick lunch. Won't be coming back, the wine and bartender were gross. P.S. the people leaving great reviews here don't even live in Hoboken.
2017-05-01,4,Not bad! Went here on a Sunday afternoon for dinner. Place was empty. Service was pretty good- Could be better and more attentive. Food was excellent! Steaks were cooked perfectly! Sides were very good. We both had New York strips steaks with asparagus. For starters we had a crab cake and fresh tomato mozzarella salad. Very good and fresh. Dessert - the coconut cream pie was to die for. The lemon cake was a bit gross- way too sweet. Would recommend and will come back!
2017-04-24,5,I'm so scared to write this because I don't want to jinx it but this is one of the best places I have ever eaten but definitely the best place in Hoboken!! The service is impeccable, the food is outstanding, the ambiance is wonderful, and the views are enchanting. I seriously would give this place 6 stars if I could (and I am a tough grader hard to get more than 4 stars out of me). Definitely check it out and see for yourself!
2017-04-24,5,Everything was great and our server Sam was exceptional the atmosphere and service was outstanding
2017-04-17,5,Very nice view of New York skyline, very friendly staff. Cheesesteak egg rolls were incredible. My wife had steakhouse salad which she loved. A lot of homemade fare; guacamole, etc. son had burger which was very fresh and daughter had flatbread pizza, also very fresh. I had crab cake which was very tasty and fresh. Overall good experience.
2017-04-17,3,Went to Del Frisco's on Eater Sunday for brunch/lunch. When someone recommended this restaurant to me I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews about service. Well unfortunately my concerns were confirmed. We had a 2:15 reservation and we were seated promptly after arriving. Our waiter came by shortly after to take our drink orders and put in our appetizer request. The cheesesteak eggrolls are very good and so is the spiced guacamole. After we finished our appetizers they cleared the table and came by a couple of times to take additional drink orders. Not sure what happened to the drinks but they never showed up. After about a 15 minute wait our server came by and said he was sorry for the delay but our food would be right up. About 15 minutes later an ass't manager came by and apologized again for the delay but said our food would be coming soon. About 10 minutes later the manager came over to apologize for the wait and said the food would be coming soon. The food did eventually arrive and was very good (not great) but very good. I would have expected the manager to somehow compensate for the long wait for our food but no such offer was extended. While Del Frisco's is a nice place, there are way too many other great dining options in Hoboken to go back and deal with the slow service again. Read the reviews carefully for this place, they are very accurate.
2017-04-16,4,Had a great dinner! Had the prime rib special and that was the best I have had in a long time. The service was great for a grille! Will definitively go back again.
2017-04-15,5,This place is amazing. The food tastes great & the drinks are tasty. I would like to thank Megan for being soooo accommodating to me and my friends -- you are so amazing ! I would also like to thank Marlin our waiter for being awesome. He is knowledgeable about the menu and personable as well.Thanks for making our night rock!!!
2017-04-15,5,Extremely nice staff. Very accommodating. Great service! Drinks are strong! Location is perfect and so is the ambiance.
2017-04-10,3,It was ok, not sure if I would go back wasn't that impressed. I ordered the crab cake which was exceptional, I had the filet mignon meatloaf, wasn't good at all. My only thrill of the night was the coconut cream pie which was AMAZING.
2017-04-06,5,Came back for a girls brunch, and I think I'm officially addicted!  Definitely one of the hidden brunch gems in Hoboken! To start, we split the wild mushroom flatbread on gluten free crust. The fontina cheese, caramelized onions, and mushrooms are a winning combo, and the crust was fantastic- I would not have known it was gluten free if I had not witnessed my gluten free friend eating it without scrambling for her epi pen. Note to self, order an entire flatbread for just me next time, it's THAT good. I went sweet the last time I brunched here, so i (hesitantly) opted for savory this time around and had the scrambled egg tacos for my main. They did not disappoint. The accompanying roasted tomato salsa and honey Serrano salsa (!!) were so good I had to ask for more (I love dipping!). All in all, will definitely keep coming back, and bumping It up a star.
2017-04-05,4,Solid american food. Thier burgers are really good. Had a steak one time and was happy with it. Nice ambiance and view.
2017-04-04,4,I got the salmon and it was amazing. The Philly egg rolls were really good too. The mushroom flat bread pizza was chewy. The service was excellent and the atmosphere was delightful. We had a party of seven and the server did a great job of managing our table.
2017-04-02,4,I made a last minute reservation here last night, all they had was an 8:45 but we got there a bit earlier and were seated by 8:30. Service was super quick which was great because I was starving and hangry. I had the "perfect margarita" to drink, ended up getting 2 because it was literally the perfect margarita! For starters we had the chicken lollipops which were really delicious. They are doused in Buffalo sauce which I loved but if you aren't a fan of spicy, you should probably ask for a little less or on the side. I had the ahi tuna salad for my main which was quite large and filling, and the ginger sesame dressing was really yummy. My boyfriend had a burger, don't recall the name, but I obviously stole a bite and it was So. Good. Something about the meat was really flavorful and it was just overall a solid burger. Only thing is they didn't ask what temperature he wanted it cooked, but it ended up coming out to his liking anyway. We got the molten chocolate cake for dessert and it was melty oozy and deeelish. Perfect way to end the meal.I really enjoyed everything about my evening, the GM came around to make sure we were taken care of and was very sweet. The views from this place are unbeatable as well. Would be happy to return when in the neighborhood.
2017-03-29,4,Been here a few times for work lunches and haven't been disappointed! Super friendly service and generally quick. Its quiet around 12pm but does get busy around 1pm. I recommend the seared Asian tuna salad - so fresh and great flavor. Ordered the lamb burger today and while flavor was great, it was a little overcooked.
2017-03-27,4,My sangria had an icepop in it. I REPEAT: my sangria had an icepop in it.Great experience for one of my best friends birthdays. We arrived early, so we grabbed some drinks at the bar before the rest of the party showed up. My white sangria had this strawberry fruit infused icepop sitting in it and when it melted wwoooooaaah. So great. Love the atmosphere, love the location. So conveniently located close to the train and the views of the city and the water are spectacular.We were immediately greeted by Raven once we sat down to get refreshed on drinks and answer any questions we had about the menu. Decided on a few appetizers to start us off: philly cheesesteak egg rolls, pepperoni flatbread, truffle mac and cheese, and the burrata to share. All super fantastic, especially the eggrolls. They had this insane caramelization on the outside, crunchy and delicious. Also the mac and cheese might be in my top 3 mac and cheeses of all time. MUST TRY!For dinner, I ordered the steak salad cooked medium. Only negative thing I will say was that the steak was crazily seasoned. I appreciate a good pepper/salt rub combo, but this was on the border of too salty. The bacon and blue cheese only added to saltiness. Still ate it all though.For desert, you NEED to get the adult milkshake. So yum. We moved back over to the bar once we were done with dinner and it was nice to be comfortable in a Hoboken bar and not trampled on to get a drink. Would absolutely come back to Del Frisco. Thanks for a fun Saturday night!
2017-03-26,5,Great food. Truffle mac and cheese was to kill for. Filet cooked to perfection. Wine deflection excellent. And don't forget dessert. Nutella bread pudding and warm chocolate cake was a great end to a wonderful dinner. Service was amazing. Waiters were on top of everything from the beginning. Excellent atmosphere and great views of the city. Would recommend this place to anyone that wants an amazing steak. Prices a bit high but it's worth every penny.
2017-03-25,5,One of our favorite places in Hoboken. For good food and atmosphere,  they are extremely accommodating to babies/kids. The restaurant seats a large amount of people so it isn't too hard to get last minute reservations. Also, for a steakhouse it is easy for pescatoreans and vegetarians to find something on the menu. The mushroom flatbread is delicious and their ahi tuna meal and salad will never disappoint.
2017-03-12,4,Great place to grab a drink as their bar has a really nice view of the city with those floor to ceiling windows!  Perfect spot to sip on some cocktails and watch the sun go down.The cocktails are pretty good and I would definitely recommend ordering "VIP".  It's infused with pineapple and really well balanced.  They also have a pretty good selection of brews on tap and in bottles as well.Have also tried a few of their food offerings and they are pretty good as well.  The fish tacos have a nice and crunchy shell.  The burger was also massive.  The flavor on everything was pretty decent, but nothing ground breaking.  I would focus on the drink and atmosphere here more than the food.
2017-03-08,5,Amazing bartenders! Amazing food! Great place for the over 30 crowd! Strongly recommend!
2017-03-04,3,Ah, disappointing recently. We used to love this place, my boyfriend and I went there on Sunday before presidents day and half of the menu was unavailable. We attempted to order steaks but they were all out.Upon getting there we sat there for at least twenty minutes waiting for a waitress/waiter and some water. It was pretty discouraging. Went from fans, to not going back. They did realize we were annoyed and gave us our appetizer for free which was good for customer service, but just not worth going back.
2017-02-26,1,I've had the pleasure to eat at Del frisco's double eagle in the city on many occasions.  This place is the exact opposite.  We were seated and not given menus, water or acknowledged by staff for over 20 minutes.  Servers,  would walk by and ignore us like we weren't there.
2017-02-24,4,Nice place is Hoboken by the waterfront. Good selection of vegetarian food. The mac and cheese and the mushroom flatbread was really good.
2017-02-16,4,Bartenders are splendid.  Always have a good time, plus you have a view of the water.  Very sleek place to visit.  The menu leaves a bit to be desired. I can eat almost anything, but I found it difficult to find something I really wanted to eat.
2017-02-15,3,I had been wanting to try it out. Finally got the chance. The appetizers are good but a little over priced. Tried the lamb burger. But of a bummer I would say. Do try the tacos. The cocktails also are worth trying. Try to get a reservation before hand. The waiters are really nice and friendly.
2017-02-03,2,Mediocre food, mediocre hit or miss service, and ludicrous prices sum up this place.  I am not going back.  Also, don't order food to take out.  They make you pick it up at the bar, so you have to fight through the crowd, try to get a disinterested bar tender's attention in order to pick up your food.  On top of that the bar tender decided she deserved a tip for handing me a bag and took it out of my change without even asking me.  I don't care about $1, but it's the principle of it.  The only reason I am not giving it 1 star is because the food isn't terrible (just mediocre) and the waiters (not the bar tenders) are ok (mediocre).  Normally I would give a mediocre restaurant 3 stars but they lose a star due to the prices and the bar tenders.
2017-02-02,3,Had a very disappointing lunch at Del Frisco's recently. Everything was pretty much in the okay to meh category. Ordered the lamb burger, ahi tuna tacos and pasta for my friend's kids. The lamb burger was over cooked and my friend said it had too much cinnamon. Tasted some of the pasta with tomato sauce that the kids were having and the sauce tasted like it came out of  a can. Not expected from Del Frisco's. The tuna tacos were decent as usual. Giving it an extra star as the service was warm and this is one of the few child friendly restaurants in Hoboken.
2017-02-01,2,This restaurant is in a great area, right on the Hoboken riverfront. We stopped in there for lunch around 3pm on Sunday and it was surprisingly busy. First strike when we walked in was the lady at the front was clearly hating life and didn't want to be at work that day. That's cool, I can deal with that. Our waiter came around and eventually took our order. We ordered 2 of the chicken wraps and a side of broccolini. Our wraps came and we had no cutlery - luckily being wraps we could eat with our hands. Our waiter literally disappeared for 20 mins and we couldn't find anyone to give us some cutlery to eat our salad with. Finally our waiter showed up and we asked him, and he acted like it was more of an inconvenience rather than a mistake on his part. By this time we'd almost finished our meal and asked about our side of broccolini since it still hadn't come out yet. Eventually we'd finished our meal and it still hadn't come, so we flagged down the waiter and he said "Oh, the kitchen hasn't brought it out yet?" .... yes, i'm sure it was the kitchens fault. He said he'd go check but when he came back we told him not to worry about it because at this point who wants a side when the meal's done? We just wanted to leave. The wrap was average and the server just made the experience more annoying. Not going back to this place!
2017-01-26,4,I've been dying to come here since it opened in Hoboken and finally convinced my boyfriend to take me.Overall, it was a good experience although slightly overpriced.  We split the cheesesteak eggrolls which we devoured in less than 3 minutes- SO GOOD!!  They come in drizzled in this chili sauce that made it even better.  Definitely a must try if you come here.  For dinner we both had the steak sandwiches, which we were able to sub the fries for the truffle mac and cheese and the jalapeno mashed potatoes for only a few extra dollars (instead of the 8 dollars each if you order them alone).  It is HUGE inside.  I'm not used to seeing restaurants that are so spacious in Hoboken but they definitely have a cozy spot with a pretty large bar area as well.  Good spot- check it out if you're tired of the same old places in Hoboken (and willing to spend a few extra dollars).
2017-01-15,3,Service here is hit or miss .. the food is decent but not comparable to the real del friscos which isn't that far from this location ..
2016-12-19,3,I've had a drink at the bar, and even though it's a little crowded, it's still a decent spot to bring a date.  I had the food for the first time, a burger, and while the service was very good and friendly, it's still a little pricey for what you get.  If I order a burger and fries, I don't enjoy paying $15.50 for it.  Still, if you're ok with paying that amount, then you'll enjoy the food, it was pretty tasty.  It's a nice crowd of customers too.
2016-12-12,4,Came here for a vendor dinner recently. Crowd is a bit older, with most being a part of the business-y crowd. Drinks were a bit on the lighter side. Ambiance was nice (minus the puke in the bathroom), and can definitely fit a variety of settings. Food was pretty good and reasonably priced for the area. We sampled the ahi tacos, steak eggrolls, wings, truffle mac and cheese. I got the grille salad with a hatch green burger and liked the fact that they had lettuce wraps. The desserts were amazing, especially the coconut cream pie which was huge. Would definitely come back to try their other offerings. Only drawback is no happy hour but you can go to any of the bars next door for that.
2016-12-06,4,The thing with Del Frisco's is that there isn't another restaurant like it in Hoboken. It's large, well decorated, and has a solid diverse menu. So many of the higher end restaurants in Hoboken try to be too fancy and over complicate their menu. Del Frisco's is a solid steakhouse with options for folks who might not like steak. They have a great bar area and wine list.It's been a welcome addition to the Hoboken restaurant scene that often feels like one clone after another.
2016-12-03,3,I've been here with my friends on several occasions. We have tried all of their appetizers. My favorites are the cheesesteak egg rolls, ahi tuna, and the lollipop chicken sticks. This place was great when they first opened but I have noticed that the food has gone downhill since their opening. For the prices they charge they food should be more consistent. Unfortunately, we have not been back since our last visit about two months ago.
2016-11-20,4,good food, good atmosphereonly four stars because i wish they had a bit more on their menu, slightly overpricedwould definitely come back
2016-11-12,3,I really want to like this restaurant so much. The location is convenient for me, there's a nice view, it's never too packed, the bar is a nice spacious area to hang out in, and the food is a near disaster. To be fair, some of the food is quite good, but bearing the Del Frisco name mean's people should expect quality steaks. Unfortunately, these are some of the most expensive mediocre steaks I've ever had. Tonight I had some dry aged bone in strip that was a special. I ordered medium rare per usual which tonight meant perfectly crisp on the outside, a bit overdone on the outer layer, and raw in the middle. Last time I was there my steak was overdone and sent back...then raw...then on the third try cooked OK but still flavorless.I've heard the tacos and flatbreads are good but never had them myself. The burger, which I've never order but tried my friend's is pretty damn good. So overall nice space, nice view, some food is quite good but I can't get over the lousy steaks. For the same price you could go to Dino and Harry's and have one of the best porterhouse steaks I've ever had.
2016-10-20,2,Came here for a business lunch meeting. The ahi tun salad was too rich as it's consisted of tuna & noodles. Great conversation but the food won't be memorable. The best thing about the place is the look out to the river view.
2016-10-17,5,Amazing steak. We had the ribeye,prime rib! The rib-eye was packed full of flavor and I enjoyed every morsel.We also enjoyed the pineapple infused vodka. The service was on point. We loved the dessert too!
2016-10-01,3,Food was good, the drinks were not that strong. Service was ok, we were sat all the way in the back. Overall good but not great.
2016-09-17,4,Del Frisco's doesn't disappoint. Great place for lunch - for business or with friends. The fish tacos are my favorite along with their burgers. Great location - right along the river for the best views of the Manhattan skyline.
2016-09-16,4,I really love the food at Del Frisco's - it never disappoints! DF's is a go-to lunch and dinner option for my boyfriend and I and the perfect place to bring parents/grandparents who are in town visiting as it's in a great location right near the water. Their specialty cocktails and wine options are great as well. The only reason I give it a 4 not 5 star rating is because I have had a handful of really poor servers here.
2016-09-15,3,Food is great.  Service is painfully slow.  2 hours to get through the meal is much too long.  I'll be back but not again if its that slow again.
2016-09-12,2,We came here for dinner this past Friday night.  We had reservations for 8:30pm and were not seated until after 9:00pm with no acknowledgement of the wait. Our waitress was very friendly, but service was extremely slow.  It took over an hour to get our food after we had placed our order.  Several sides were missing from our order, but since we didn't want to wait another hour for them we didn't bring it up (we were not charged for them).  The food was pretty good.  Overall, the food was not worth the slow service and I will not be rushing back to this location.
2016-09-09,5,Went with 7 family members. The food was EXCELLENT, 3 filet mignons, my first bit was a little fatty, but the other 2 were saying how great it was. As I was looking down inspecting, our waiter appeared and inquired if everything was OK? I stated it was a little fatty and in a heart beat a manager appeared, wisked it away and profusely apologized, and had a whole new filet brought over. Then I knew what the others were so excited about, you could cut it with a fork and flavor to savor.  Excellent, waygu patty melt, delicious, beef stroganoff,  Amazing Lava cake, to DIE for!!! Worth finding parking in Hoboken for!  On top of the that, Great service, I love the 'swarm', the table gets cleaned off in one big swoop. Best server ever,Greg,truly enhanced our visit, laughing with our crazy group, so nice, so attentive, so genuine and HAPPY!!! And even sent a thank card afterwards. I'll be back even if I have to pay for parking.
2016-09-08,3,Friendly servers, decent food, slightly overpriced menu sums up my review for them.We go there time to time when the weather is nice.  Restaurant is big and staff are very friendly to both adults and babies, so it makes it a bit easier for us to go there compared to some of the small Hoboken restaurants.We had different items off the menu including burgers, salad, crab cake, dips, veggie burger (biggest mistake).  They are all fine except for the last one on the list.  Cocktail was fine, nothing that will either blow your mind or disappoint you.  Usually walk away with $70-$80 bill for 2 adults and a baby!
2016-09-06,1,I've been to plenty 5 star steakhouses and this is the worst by far. The service was not very good, and the food was terrible. They also only have one type of steak sauce- A1. Disappointing experience, especially for someone who has never dined at this restaurant before and had only heard great things!
2016-09-04,2,Food was great, but they ran out of coffee??? Does that makes any sense??? The service was good. The food was very good, but I found it incredibly odd that the waitress came back and said that the restaurant ran out of coffee! Now how can a restaurant that is charging a premium for your food run out of coffee??? I am actually shocked. Do you think they should invest in a coffee machine??? I heard nespresso is having a sale.
2016-09-04,3,Food was good, drinks were great, service was nice, but they ran out of coffee??  How does this happen?  All around, the service was great...very accommodating and kind, but telling us that there is no more coffee (when there is a supermarket next door for emergencies) is kind of like saying there is no more water!!!!
2016-09-04,2,Very easy to find a seat and excellent service (Sunday around 6pm on holiday weekend). My friend and I were a bit excited to catch up and share a meal.First off,  margaritas were ice with a hint of tequila. Terrible cocktail, my water was better tasting. Popcorn chicken appetizer was not amusing and tasted like a dive bar plate of wings after the kitchen closed. We ordered the lamb burger and the regular burger...never thought you can get worse than mcDonalds. At least the waiter was nice.
2016-09-04,5,Love this place! Visit it at least once a week. Love their lollipop chicken wings, flatbread pizza, burgers, and ahi tacos. Great customer service as well. I enjoy sitting outside and enjoying the view on beautiful days. Staff always remembers me and even comes over and says hello if they are not my waiter for that particular day. Can't go wrong here.
2016-09-04,5,We were a group of 7 and all raved about our meals. Dessert and drinks were fabulous also.  Staff was excellent
2016-08-31,5,Came here for my first wedding anniversary dinner. We had an 8:30pm reservation, but got there early at 7:45. They had us early, but it shouldn't have been an issue since they had plenty of room. Our host and server was great. The food was delicious. Only complain was...we ordered whiskey and a glass of wine and it came to our table with less than a normal amount. We got that, two appetizers, two entrees (one of the entrees was the steak rib eye for about $48), and a dessert...with tip, it only cost us about $150. So can't complain about that.
2016-08-29,5,My husband and I went here for the first time and were hooked. The bar is our favorite. They have creative well made cocktails. The food is outstanding. Have the Ahi Tuna. And Nutella Bread Pudding. The bartender Chris was friendly and awesome. He really made our experience special
2016-08-29,3,3.5 stars to the steak house grill on Hoboken's River front.  Del Frisco's offers both indoor and outdoor seating. Inside the cooking area is exposed which is nice because you can actually SEE what the chefs are doing in the back as opposed to being left in the dark. Let's talk about my favorite part of this place. The appetizers! If you go here (dinner or after work drinks) you have to get the Cheese Steak Egg Rolls. This app is the first one on the menu and for good reason. It is their best selling appetizer for its uniqueness and tastiness. The egg roll itself is sweet on the outside. Inside the egg roll wrapped up along with the cheese and steak is a honey mustard sauce. Trust me this is the best item to order on the menu. Another great side that we ordered as an app was the Truffle Mac and Cheese. I liked this order a lot because it wasn't overly cheesy and had a nice seasoning to it. Very light which would make it a good choice for ordering as an app or a side. Del Frisco's loses 1 1/2 stars from me for two important reasons: 1. Long wait time for our food (35 minutes after we finished our appetizers) and 2. The Filet MignonI have never ordered a Filet Mignon in my life and had an excessive amount of fat to go along with it. Isn't that the point of ordering this steak? Also, the Filet Mignon was drowned in Pepper Corn. Every bite was a gooey piece of steak with a pepper corn taste. The side of Mashed Potatoes it comes with is ok. It's not your traditional creamy mash that some might be used to. This was very rough with still big pieces of potato in it. Their main seasoning for this side is green pepper so for my Garlic Mashed Potato people this isn't what you will get. For the price of everything and quality we received I wasn't overly satisfied with this place. I would come back to sit by the bar for a drink and order some apps but I don't think I would come back for a steak. There are other better steak restaurants in Hoboken and the surrounding area if that's what you're in the mood for. Hopefully the other entrees on the menu are better than the Filet Mignon!
2016-08-25,2,While searching for a place to eat on Sinatra drive, my friend and I tried this place.  I wasn't in the mood for a huge steak but the menu does have a bunch of salads, fish, sandwiches, and flatbreads to satisfy the non steak eater.  Location, location, location.  The outdoor seating has amazing views of the Hudson River and NYC. We sat outside and I was very satisfied with my view and people watching. Service was attentive though it was hard to find our waitress after we paid. I got the lamb burger on a lettuce wrap with a side salad for $15.50. The burger could also come with a variety of fries but I opted for the salad. Lamb burger was good, not great. It seemed overlooked and the seasoning could have been stronger.  Lettuce wrap was overpowering as the burger came with lettuce already so I felt like I was eating lettuce with a side of lamb burger - wish they had just cut down the amount of lettuce. Side salad was fine albeit tiny. My friend got a veggie burger and had the same comments as me. All in all - food is mediocre but great views and nice place to catch up with a friend.
2016-08-23,5,I didn't know this place existed until a friend took me here.  The restaurant is right on the water in Hoboken so it's a great location.  We were seated immediately.  We both had the VIP which was a special and OMG so GOOD!!! The food was delicious and the server kept checking up on us.  It wasn't a long wait for the drinks or food.  I plan to go back ASAP and have already told several people about it.
2016-08-13,4,Came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch with my girlfriend. We both got the chicken avocado wraps. She had hers with the tortilla wrap and I had mine with a lettuce wrap. Both variations were excellent. Also make sure you get the sweet potato fries as they were out of this world. We highly recommend people stop by to get some good food and service.
2016-08-13,4,This is my new fav place! It was great river view and good food. We ordered stake and tuna taco. There had great cocktail too. We sat on the bar. We will back here soon!
2016-07-31,5,Went to brunch and had the French toast and white sangria. So good! Great atmosphere too!
2016-07-24,4,Great food, great price!! I'm not one to nit-pick at stuff, but some of the younger waiters come to the table every 5 minutes asking if everything is ok... yes, nothing has changed since you were last here let me enjoy the awesome food!
2016-06-27,4,Another Del Frisco's Grille - this time in Jersey!Went for a late Saturday dinner. Sat down at 10pm and they were still serving food, but minus points for taking an hour to get it to us. I dunno what could have taken so long when the place was half empty.But everything we ordered was delicious! Regular burger is a double burger with double cheese - good. Wagyu patty melt with sauteed onions on rye toast was excellent. They forgot the thousand island dressing it was supposed to come with, but I didn't even mind bc it probably tasted better without it. Could've used some more fries though, they beefed up the fry side by stuffing it with tissue paper.Truffle mac and cheese was great too! But the standout that really surprised us was the flatbread pizza. I did not expect it to be as good as it was! For a flatbread, that one left an impression.The drinks were meh and overpriced, so don't bother boozing it up here. Just pig out!
2016-06-27,1,my wife and I came here sat. 6/25 around 3:00  went inside and ask the hostess if it was ok to just sat at a table outside, she said yes, how many. so after we sat done we watched 2 waitresses look at us and walk past us 3 times each without acknowledging us; one even went to the end of the patio to look around then on her way back looked directly at us and walked inside; there were only 2 other tables with 2 and 4 people there; so with this I went inside where the waitress was just standing there and a different hostess came up to me and asked if she can help me so I said why have we been sitting out there for 10-15 mins. without anyone taking care of us; the same waitress says "where are you sitting"  I said the same place that we have been sitting the last three times you looked at us; so of course we left; I frequent both restaurants in nyc  with customers of mine for years and spend a nice amount of money, and have always been treated with respect; we could have eaten anywhere else in Hoboken but I chose del frisco's because I know the restaurant and the food but never will myself and everyone else I mention this to will come back here to be treated like this again
2016-06-26,4,Awesome spot in Hoboken. Great view of Manhattan right across the water. Great service, huge booze selection, and wonderful Friday night destination atmosphere. Make reservations!
2016-06-19,4,Loved the appetizers- had the tacos and the lumpy cake.   the sirloin steak was seasoned to perfection. The stroganoff was okay. It did not seem to have enough sour cream or sauce.  So full that we had no room for dessert
2016-06-16,4,Went to Del Frisco Grille on a Sunday night with a buddy for a test on how great a steak would be on this side of the river. My buddy and I are foodies & great cooks. The hostess...well I will remain positive to focus on the waitress service and food....smile....The atmosphere is cool with a scenic view of Manhattan. The waitress was awesome, articulate, knowledgeable & personable. We ordered the lump crab cake (A must do) and the rib eye steak. The steak temperature was perfectly prepared. We were asked to cut our steaks in the middle ensuring that it was correctly prepared. The peppercorn sauce was a perfect compliment for our succulent steaks. We also ordered cognac's to finish off our super tasty meals. I also recommend the Mac & cheese. I would absolutely go back as a substitute if going into Manhattan for a steakhouse is not an option. Really Great place!
2016-06-14,1,I gave this one star - which is two stars more than it deserved.  I spent 60 bucks on their Philly cheesesteak egg rolls, and their double cheeseburger and fries and two drinks at the bar.Lets start with the staff, the bartender, female with long blond hair and some ink who had the attitude of I am trying my best to ignore the customers but I want a tip so let me occasionally ask if they need anything.  Not attentive at all.Now for the real star of the show - the food.The egg rolls which came highly reviewed were microwaved, and not cooked consistently.  Which is a crime because they would have cooked in the fryer in 5 minutes and came out perfect.  But Del Frisco's chose to pre-cook them and microwave to order, by the time I got to the last piece they had the consistency of a hardened plastic.  Then there is the burger which wasn't bad, the fries however were left over from last week, stale and served at room temperature.  I think I ate two of them, the first was holy crap that sucks, the second was  - there is no way they could be that bad, they were.  Frozen fries right out of the bag would have been better.The good news however is the three different bars on my walk home that also made money from Del Frisco's as I had to stop in, buy a drink, and destroy the men's room.In the future - pre-mix a drink and go to Five Guys, and save 50 bucks and enjoy a meal without spending the rest of the night curled up in the fetal position.Avoid at all costs!!!
2016-06-11,4,We went to Del Frisco's with our two year old son and our friends who also have a two year old daughter. The restaurant is very spacious and had space for strollers. The food was great, I had a lamb burger with Parmesan fries. The burger was awesome, would definitely recommend it. We also tried the Mushroom, Tomato Basil, & Pepperoni Italian Sausage Flatbread pizzas and they were all great even though it was Gluten Free bread. Also our server AJ was fantastic, and ensured we had a great dinner. We would recommend this restaurant to other families with children who are looking to have a nice meal.
2016-06-07,4,I've visited the midtown location for dinner, and the Hoboken location for lunch. I went with a group of coworkers for a business lunch, and was really impressed by the food. We shared the Philly cheesesteak egg rolls, which were incredible (highly recommend!), and the deviled eggs (not a huge fan of deviled eggs, but co-workers loved them). The Cobb salad for lunch was delicious, and the portion was really big & filling. Honestly, was much more impressed with this Hoboken location for lunch versus the midtown location for dinner. I'll certainly be visiting again!
2016-06-04,5,cheese steak egg rolls are delicious! Drinks and egg rolls are the way to go for a quick bite after work! Management there is super nice! Great culture!
2016-05-30,4,Came back for a second visit and we were glad we did. We love that the layout is very spacious which allows stroller parking. It also doesn't hurt that it's located right on the waterfront.We went with the cheesesteak rolls ago. Crispy and fill of flavor, they were just as good as the first time. We also had apps of fish tacos and pork baos. Both were very good. For entrees we had kale salad, salmon taco and the hanger steak. The steak was cooked perfectly, medium rare of course, and so moist and tender that it just melted in my mouth. The loaded potato side was equally delicious. Tasty Bellinis and mimosas kept us lubricated and happy.
2016-05-30,1,Um NO. With the Del Frisco's name, expectations are high. Maybe it's because this one is in Jersey, maybe it's because the place is poorly managed, maybe the food just sucks, but I left here feeling like I wasted my money. The only thing my husband and I enjoyed was the roasted corn bisque. Everything went downhill from there like so many other cliché YELP reviews read. Steak salad was too salty, greens were soggy, medium steak came out rare. Chopped chicken salad came out flavorless, chicken pieces were too big, hard and overcooked. My daughter's chicken tenders were greasy and soggy, not crisp, French fries were cold, she didn't eat them. Server was bogged down, too many tables, only saw her 3 times the whole meal. She seemed nice enough to me, but hubby felt her tone was condescending and phony.  Whatever... Good, memorable service is almost impossible to come by lately. Overall spent $90 before tip for two cups of soup, two salads, two watered down "signature" white sangrias and a kid's chicken tenders. Lame. I enjoyed dinner at my local diner more than this meal and spent less. We won't be back.
2016-05-24,3,Came here on a Sunday night and sat near the bar area. Nice place with a beautiful view.. Service - on the other hand -fell very short. I asked the waitress what she would recommend & looking over my head (rudely) - she answers "uh.. Everything." Ok... Let me get one of everything. Haha.. No. & so I ask "Well, if you had to choose one thing.." & she recommends something that they didn't have any more of for the evening. Geez.. So I order a porterhouse steak, Mac and cheese , and sweet potato fries. Everything came out at different times. The food was ok- but nothing to write home about. The server was no where to be found and 20 minutes later when I finally spotted her to ask her about our food .. She acts clueless and blames the food runner for not attending to HER tables..! Our server was careless - leaving a bad taste in my mouth .Maybe it was an off night. Maybe it was just my off server. I would give them another try.. But I would come earlier.. And definitely request a different server if I had her again.
2016-05-19,5,Great experience! This location is right by the water and the view of the city is ah-maxing...day, sunset and dusk. The manager, Quenton, was super nice! He recommended the ahi tuna tacos and the cheesesteak egg rolls which were scrumptious and super filling. He also recommended the steak which I'll try next time (I was too full). The VIP cocktail was yummy. I consumed everything so fast that I forgot to take a picture . I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in NY.
2016-05-18,3,Dear Del Frisco's Grille,Does anyone there know what's going on? Does anyone care? It just seems like no one had any clue or cared. It started when we called 15 minutes before coming in. We asked if a nearby garage would validate parking, and if we could walk in for 2 with a baby. We were told the garage directly across would do free parking with a receipt, and there were plenty of tables, no problem. Parking in the garage, we were told they did not validate for any of the local restaurants. Ok, annoying, but fine, we'll deal. We walk into the restaurant and see easily half a dozen open tables, and the hostesses said all of the tables were for reservations. Then they more less stared at each other saying they didn't know what to do. A manager eventually showed up and found a table for us within about 10 seconds. He was apologetic for the confusion. On to the food. I ordered the crab cake eggs Benedict. When the food finally comes, it's the regular eggs Benedict. I immediately the server (who was not our waiter) and he says he is going to check and be right back. 15 minutes go by, and no one has come to the table to say a word. No "sorry for the mix up," no "your correct order will be right out." Nothing. Eventually the food did come back out and the crab cake Benedict does not actually have crab cakes. It's eggs on focaccia bread with crab meat. While this was not what I was expecting, I will say it was actually really good. The good points? The restaurant itself is really nice; one of the classiest in Hoboken. It feels spacious and elegant, and not just another cramped bar. The food, when they eventually got it right, was really good. Prices were actually pretty reasonable and in line with what you would expect for Hoboken. The manager did strike me as someone who knew what he was doing, cared, and wanted to take care of his customers. Will I be back? Yes, I will because the food was good, prices were in line, and the restaurant itself is really nice. That being said, this place needs to start trying and not rest on its laurels. The fact that the restaurant is named Del Frisco's does not mean you do not need to try to do the basics (i.e. Seat people at tables or send correct food orders out).
2016-05-13,5,CHEESE STEAK EGG ROLLS! Get one whole order for yourself yes they are THAT good! Everything is great The VIP martini hits the spotThe kale and Brussels salad is always fresh and filling. I've never had a bad meal here! ask for Sebastian as a server he is great!
2016-05-11,4,Came here with two friends and enjoyed our meal immensely.  The decor is appropriate for an upscale chain restaurant and our waitress was great.  We ordered a bunch of appetizers and the kale salad.  Everything was delicious, especially the cheesesteak egg rolls and Brussels sprout/kale salad, both of which were amazing!!!  Drinks were well made.  I am coming back to try more dishes off the menu.
2016-05-10,5,It makes sense that a steakhouse would make a great burger, but with the bevy of options in Hoboken, I was surprised to determine that Del Frisco's Grille serves up THE best cheeseburger in town. If you don't drool over the two juicy patties set atop the perfect combination of lettuce and pickle, jammed between a soft on the inside, toasted on the outside bun, then you're not human. Though I return frequently for this perfect meal (always with a side of sweet potato fries), my favorite experience at Del Frisco's yet has been for brunch. It was love at first sight for me and the Bananas Foster French Toast. I fell further though once I took a bite into the buttery, flavor filled concoction and "mmm"-ed with every consecutive forkful. It was a hard decision that day for my date and I, however, as our palates also yearned for the Cheesesteak Egg Rolls. The menu warns you that its "food to fight over", but even that doesn't do the appetizer justice. Sure, cheesesteak in a fried wrapper bathed in a sour and sweet glaze may not sound like a good complement to breakfast food, but that couldn't stop me. I've come to consider myself a regular at this spot, and I can't wait to get back over there soon!
2016-05-09,5,Took my mom and dad here on Mother's Day and we were able to snag a spot outside. The service was a little slow, though it was expected as they were slammed and we wanted to hangout a while anyway so worked out well.The food was fantastic. Our server Alyssa (not sure of spelling) was great as well. They accidentally threw out my mom's leftover when they went to wrap it and made her a brand new one to take home without even asking. She also received a dessert on the house for Mother's Day.The manager even hand delivered the newly cooked dish to take home as leftovers and the server gave us a free appetizer card for another visit. Safe to say we'll be back here.
2016-05-09,2,No, this isn't Del Frisco's Steakhouse (a nice steakhouse in other locations).  Instead, this location is Del Frisco's "Grille" brand, which bills itself as an "upscale bar & grill featuring modern American cuisine with handcrafted cocktails." Despite this not being Del Frisco's high-end steakhouse brand, I still had high expectations. Unfortunately, I wasn't very impressed. We ended up waiting nearly 15 minutes just for the server to come greet us, and when he arrived, he gave us a quick "do you know what you want to drink?" without saying anything else, as if I were at a casual pub rather than an "upscale" restaurant. He came back eventually with the drinks and recommended the cheese steak egg rolls (which were fine, but very greasy). Our main courses weren't very memorable, except that our server asked us if we wanted any side dishes like asparagus even though our dishes came with asparagus -- which was confusing -- but it turned out our meals came with 2 thin stalks of asparagus. Disappointing. And again, the service was lackluster. My drink sat empty for most of my meal because we couldn't find our server anywhere, and for the higher prices and supposedly upscale atmosphere, that's pretty frustrating. I really wanted to like this place since it's in a great location, but I don't know if I'll be returning.
2016-05-07,4,Service was wonderful and attentive, good for groups.
2016-05-06,2,Appetizers were chicken wings, crab cake, and cheesesteak egg rolls... Mediocre at best. Dinner 3 of 5 ordered steak... 2 steaks were sent back for being under cooked. Drinks were slow to get to the table. Not impressed at all with this place. Should have went to Dino & Harry's..
2016-05-01,4,Let me preface this by saying that I am NOT a fan of chain restaurants--but holy cow, Del Frisco's defies all expectations. Their cheesesteak eggrolls, lollipop chicken wings, and gluten-free flatbreads were welcome surprises. The sangria was tasty and strong (generous serving, too). The atmosphere is nice with a good view on the water--it seems like more of a place to go with some friends than a date night place.
2016-05-01,2,I am giving two stars because the service was really good. The wine our server recommended was also good. The food is another story. My friend and I both ordered the 16 oz Ribeye prepared medium. They both arrived medium well. The manager who dropped them off, apologized and offered to replace cooked as we ordered. However, I have an issue wasting a good cut of beef even though the chef cooked them too long. So we opted to eat them. They were ok but definitely left me with my craving for a good steak unfulfilled. Then we were given a dessert menu and told our waitress we didn't want anything, as my friend and I are not dessert people. I specifically told her I was not a dessert person and don't like sweet things. The manager proceeded to bring over two complementary desserts to make up for the steaks. While the gesture was appreciated, they were barely eaten for reasons mentioned above and wasted. Everything else was left on our bill, even the post dinner coffee my friend ordered. So in conclusion the dining experience was ok, even though they sat us right by the kitchen, but the food was below average especially for the price. And I find it slightly irritating that you bring someone two desserts who tells you they don't like sweets and ate an over cooked steak because they also have an issue wasting food. I would maybe go back here for lunch for to try another dish but I will definitely get my steak fix somewhere else.
2016-04-30,4,This is my go-to lunch spot near the office.My favorite thing to get here is the kale brussels sprouts salad with chicken. It's the perfect dish to get when you want to eat healthy but still want to have a really great, filling meal.The service was on point. They totally understand that the lunch hour is an hour. Super fast and friendly! If the salad doesn't suit you, you can also try the veggie burger, half and half deals.... Although I haven't tried EVERYTHING on the menu, I don't think you can go wrong here.Would highly recommend if you are in the area!
2016-04-29,5,Ate at the bar with my boyfriend. The bartender Carrie was awesome she let me try the sangria before ordering. Sangria was a little sweet but it went well with my meal and I really liked! Started off with cheesesteak egg rolls which were amazing and I would eat everyday!! Then we had the wedge which they split for us!! Wedge was perfect for sharing!! Ribeye was cooked perfect and loved the sweet potato fries!
2016-04-28,1,Food = consistently good qualityMenu = fresh and interestingDecor = modern with clean linesKitchen = immaculateWaitstaff = lovely and attentiveHosts = DEPLORABLENo matter what time, day of the week, level of crowdedness, etc, you will undoubtedly wait to be seated as the inattentive waitstaff care more about their inappropriately short skirts than they do about their customers. There are always 4-6 open tables that can be utilized, but the extraordinarily unprofessional hostesses with the seating charts either ignore their eyeballs or more likely don't care. The managers are aware of the problem yet do nothing to improve the situation or enhance the customer's experience. It's a pity because with a few tweaks, I this place could be great. Instead, it's destined to fail after the Hoboken crowd has had enough of the piss poor front of the house. PS:  I replied to Del Frisco's management's request for more information about our experience and never heard back. Figures! All show and nothing to back it up! DON'T EAT HERE!!!
2016-04-23,4,The little casual brother of Del Friscos - it's pretty solid. We came on a Saturday for brunch - but they only serve brunch on Sundays. That was okay. We ordered pomegranate margaritas which were tasty and went down quickly. The Moscow Mule looked good as well. I ordered the prime burger. Double patty, brioche bun, with fries. Excellent. These guys know how to make a burger - juicy and just the right amount of salt, meaty cheese and sloppy sauce. The fries were also excellent - hot and crisp with a mini ketchup dispenser that was perfect for precision ketchup application. We didn't need to make reservations and there were plenty of seats and the place was definitely kid and baby friendly. We will be back.
2016-04-15,4,GREAT addition to the Hoboken waterfront.  Shaved steak sandwich is amazing.  Drinks are well priced, service is great at the bar.  One time I did go for dinner and thought that the table service felt a little to be desired in terms of speed to get drinks, but they were nothing but polite and food was well prepared.
2016-04-11,5,Fantastic food! Really cool, chill, hip atmosphere with fantastic view. Was not as pricey as you would think. Great value!
2016-04-02,3,Not to be confused with the steak house. Food was good but nothing out of the ordinary. The steak was the best option. Well prepared and seasoned. Temperature just right. Lamb burger was also good. The meatloaf was nothing special however. Too much sauce. The flatbread was... well... flat... Casual atmosphere. Our server was great and kept checking in on us. Nice location by the river and the park.
2016-04-01,3,Rib eye steak, filet mignon cooked to perfection on how we liked it. Ahi tuna tacos and lump crab cake with Cajun lobster sauce highly recommended. White sangria was really good. It will be my go to place if I want steak and I'm lazy to drive to New York .
2016-03-26,2,Pretty establishment with Mediocre food and inflated prices. Got the wrong order but ate it anyways. Steak was burnt on the edges. The corn chowder was too sweet. Sad lunch and empty wallet. One of my few ragrats in life.
2016-03-21,4,Went to Del Frisco's this weekend for date night with me lady and we enjoyed it. The setting was perfect for a night out, not to mention you have the awesome city view feet away on the waterfront. For a Saturday night the wait wasn't crazy we got there around 9pm and waited maybe a half hour which isn't bad for Hoboken. The menu isn't big but has just the right amount of variety you need. I had the meatloaf over mash potatoes and the baked mac and cheese on the side. the meatloaf was seasoned to perfection and the mac and cheese was amazing. I highly recommend the mac and cheese as a side. My lady had the chicken which was also great, it didn't need any addition toppings or anything seasoned just right.I'll be going back real soon as soon as the weather improves just to take that nice walk on the waterfront after dinner.
2016-03-19,5,Del Frisco's Grille in Hoboken is hands down my favorite restaurant right now. I literally dream about the food.. oops, just drooled on my keyboard... I've been to Del Frisco's Double Eagle in Manhattan a few times, which is incredible, but ever since they opened the Grille in Hoboken, I actually prefer it over the Double Eagle. The atmosphere here is more inviting for me personally. Its fun, beautiful, hip and in a great location. They have outside seating too, which will be great in the summer!Ok, now for the food. Everything I've ordered here thus far has been absolutely amazing. The corn bisque is out of this world. I know, you're probably like "corn bisque? Really?" Yes, really. I would have licked the cup when I was done if I wasn't in public. The tuna tacos are fantastic, as are their flatbreads. Truffle mac n'cheese is soo delicious. Seriously, everything is fantastic.  Wines are great, even by the glass. Service is on point.Even if you're so full after all this delicious food, you MUST order the Nutella bread pudding. Trust me, you won't regret it. This is literally the best thing I have ever put in my mouth. It's a little crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside, topped with a big scoop of hazelnut ice cream. It's heaven.Go. Eat. Enjoy!
2016-03-17,3,This restaurant needs work.  Maybe since it is still working out opening kinks, but we found it very average.  I love steak houses and although I was not expecting the level of the double eagle I expected more.  The food was good, not great.  The service is in dire need of help.  The expense of the meal was not worth the overall experience.  If you are in Hoboken and want a great steak one should head over to Dean & Harry's.  If I'm going to spend this amount money, and I don't mind, it better be great.  It is also very loud which I have grown to hate in any restaurant.
2016-03-15,3,Every year, I get a gift certificate to Del Frisco's from my boss. The only Del Frisco's near me used to be in NYC and was a hassle to get to. So when I found out a Del Frisco's was opening in Hoboken, I was a little excited. Of course, it's Hoboken - and I hate driving to Hoboken. Almost as bad a NYC. But, since it was going to be a free meal, I decided to take an Uber there and back with my bf and make a date night out of it. We got there around lunch time, but asked to order off the dinner menu. That may have been a mistake. We both ordered our steaks medium, but they were overcooked and dry by the time they came out. And it took a LONG time for them to come out. And there were not a lot of people in this place. It was empty. So maybe next time I won't get the steak. I'll go for a burger instead. And maybe I'll order off the lunch menu, should it be lunch time.But the one rule I always follow when going to Del Frisco's: Get the Mac & Cheese.
2016-03-14,1,I've given this place a few tries. No matter what I order, I always feel "uncomfortable" a couple of hours later. The burgers are greasy and the menu is limited. With very few decent food options in Hoboken, I had high hopes for this place. Disappointed...
2016-03-12,5,We went for a brunch on Sunday and it was great. Very family friendly as we saw tons of other kids there along with ours. A great menu for brunch where there were so many options I wanted to try.
2016-03-11,5,It's no wonder the Del Frisco's brand is so successful. Everything from the decor to the general vibe to friendly service and of course the food is on point. I've been here half a dozen times since it opened and have had a consistent 5 star experience each and very time. As far as people complaining about the wait, just make a reservation. Like some other popular places you may have to wait 15-20 minutes on a busy night but it's well worth it.
2016-03-10,3,Nice decor and location.  Very NYC style look and good for groups.  However food was "okay"
2016-03-02,3,In one word: Underwhelmed. The cheesesteak egg rolls which were recommended by our server were nothing special. When it came to entrees our side of truffle mac and cheese had a giant hair in it. There was an issue with my boyfriends entree as well. The cherry on the sundae was that not one thing was removed from our bill despite the issues, not even a cocktail. Only perk was our attentive server. i was looking forward to bringing clients here since I work nearby but that wont be happening any time soon. #disappointed
2016-02-29,2,Awesome location. Plenty of garages to park in.Very family friendly. Server was nice. Ordered two burger specials. Both were way overcooked. Service was slow.I have had better burgers at my local bar. It should not take 25 minutes to get served. Nice bar with spectacular evening view of the city.
2016-02-27,1,Well, we had reservations but that really didn't seem to matter. This couple walked in with no reservations and they were given a table immediately. The ambiance is lovely and the bar is packed. However, if you happen to be of a darker melanin your service may take longer and your table just may happen to take longer to be ready. The cabrenet savignon was quite delish though. But after this experience I think I'll take my business elsewhere.
2016-02-27,4,Came here for Valentine's Day since we're always looking for a new place to try for brunch. I'll start with the good:- The food is excellent. I ordered the Chipotle Eggs Benedict- they came out as soft boiled eggs instead of runny poached, and were served on fresh ham and scallion biscuits, which I thought was a great play on the original dish. Very pleased. BF got the Chicken & Waffles, and for his first introduction to this dish, he said he hoped it always tasted this way! There is a spicy maple syrup that you have to ask for while ordering, so make sure you do.- The mimosas were great, very strong and the right proportion for a boozy brunch- get the carafe for the best deal.- This place sits right on the river, so you get great light and views during the day.Would I come back here? Definitely. My only gripes:- When I originally made my reservation on the site, the menu was much more extensive. Maybe it was because it was V-Day, but they only were offering 6 menu choices. I wish I knew that going in as there was no specific V-Day menu on the site.- If you look at the site alone, it seems to be more of an upscale place, but I was kinda confused when I walked in and it had a very casual feel. I'm not sure if this place knows exactly the type of brand they want to portray, because there were some managers in suits while the waiters/waitresses looked very casual. Maybe the ambiance is different for dinner, I will come back and see!
2016-02-21,1,Service was really terrible.  See pic attached that shows we had an 8:15 VIP reservation through open table and arrived at 8:10pm. The bar didn't have any open seats or place to stand so we waited standing by the wall for 45min! We inquired about several open tables but were told that those tables were reserved for a party of 6 and we were only 4.  Being suspicious of the several couples seated at 4 person tables we inquired again to no avail.  When we were finally seated (at the 6 person table in the corner) no one came to take our drink or food order.  It  took 15 minutes before we hailed a waiter running by who was reluctant to help us because it wasn't his assigned table. We convinced him to take our order then didn't see him again until our cold flatbread pizza app came out.   When our entree came out the steaks were undercooked and had to be sent back. We tried ordering more wine but he forgot and had to be reminded. This was by far one of my worst dining experiences ever! I really expected more from the Del Frisco brand.
2016-02-20,5,Highly recommend! Parking garage right across the street!! Service was great! Birthday party of 10... 9:30pm reservation, seated right away- hostess was very professional and welcoming. Drinks were really tasty- sangria comes with frozen fresh fruit popsicle stick! Great food- must get cheesesteak egg rolls and crab cake for apps! I ordered the hangar steak with Mac and cheese as a side- simply delicious!! A little on the noisy side-  very busy Saturday night! Happy to see this restaurant doing well!! Can't wait to go back!
2016-02-19,3,My boyfriend and I came here on Valentine's Day for dinner because I've been eager to come since it opened.We were seated quickly, and the hostess was friendly. Our server arrived really quickly after we were seated but immediately asked for our appetizer order. We were seated maybe a minute before and he hadn't brought waters or asked for a drink order. After finishing our apps, which came relatively quickly and were pretty good, we ordered 2 glasses of wine. Our dinner came out about 10 minutes later (still no wine) and my steak was undercooked so we had to send it back. We asked for waters in the meantime as they still were not brought out.After I received my steak, we reached a point that we stopped eating our meals because we would have finished them before the wine came.We wanted to drink our wine with dinner and as a result we waited about 20-25 minutes after ordering it, all the while our entrees were getting cold.Originally, when ordering my meal, I asked if I could sub green beans for the mashed potatoes. Our server responded that he needed to check with his manager but he never got back to me. My entree then came with no green beans or the standard mashed potatoes. When the waiter came over 10 minutes later to check on us, I mentioned this to him. He responded with another line about asking his manager and then ducked out, seemingly to get me a side of some kind. A side never came. The waiter showed up after we finished to offer dessert menus and casually said "the mashed potatoes came, right?". When we told them they hadn't, he offered to go get them so I asked for them to go. He left to get the mashed potatoes and give us time to review dessert options.We planned on getting dessert here as they looked good, but after waiting 15 more minutes with no sign of our waiter we decided to pay and leave. He showed up, dropped the check and the mashed potatoes, and we left.We really wanted to like Del Frisco's but because the service was so slow, we felt like the experience was overpriced for what we were getting. The mac and cheese side was delicious, as was the smoked pork chop but sadly we will not be returning.
2016-02-18,1,Went here for Valentine's Day this year. We had a reservation for 9:30pm, and got there about 15 minutes early. They told us to go sit at the bar, and we would be seated closer to our reservation time. After a half hour, my boyfriend went to go check when we would be seated. The hostess said they were just waiting for people to get up and we would be seated right away. 20 minutes after that my boyfriend went to go check again. This time we were seated. When we got seated, I saw there were empty tables all around us. When the manager came over, I asked why it took us 50 minutes to be seated when there were so many empty tables. The manager said "we made a mistake, but we will be sure to take care of you". In my mind that means at least our drinks would be comped for their "mistake". Nope. The bill came with everything on it. I would have preferred that the manager didn't come over at all. After the meal I messaged the restaurant on Facebook about what happened. They read my message and did not respond. I then sent an additional message saying "Thanks for the response. I see your social media is much like your management" Overall, this place is a lot of hype with an inexperienced staff. My advice is to save yourself the hassle and go somewhere else.  There are a million better places Hoboken.
2016-02-15,4,We had a great experience here! We made reservations on a busy Saturday night and were seated immediately when we arrived. Everything we had was delicious. I'm a vegetarian and my biggest pet peeve is when you order a veggie burger and they give you a frozen patty - so not the case here! One of the best veggie burgers I have ever had with yummy well-seasoned sweet potato fries on the side. Our order came out quickly, and our waiter and a manager came over frequently to check on us. You can't beat the view of the NYC skyline on the waterfront, and the decor inside was clean and modern. A wonderful dining experience start to finish!
2016-02-09,2,Food was mediocre at best , drinks tasted watered down, service was amateur.  First review and last review for Del Friscos, Hoboken.
2016-02-06,3,Nice décor & location, but overall it's more TGI Friday's without the 2 for $20 menu than steakhouse destination.The menu was fun, with a variety of interesting items, which I would like to return and try more of. The corn bisque and ahi tuna tacos were great apps, and they do a good job with the drinks.As far as meals - ribeye was good, not great, and overcooked. Cheeseburger was also cooked more than I'd like for a steakhouse type burger but it was still solid. The fries were pretty weak.the mac and cheese side was good, but everything ordered was exceptionally salty, aside from the fries which could have used a bit more.Fantastic service - I'd return here but not for a steak dinner.
2016-02-06,4,We came here on a Thursday night and had reservations. With that being said, we had to wait 20 minutes for our table which was odd because although it "looked" busy, you can tell they accommodated one too many walk-ins. But it;s fine, Eric over at the bar is always a great guy to hang out with. When we got seated, we were greeted by a server (sorry forgot his name). He made a few recommendations, We started with the Guacamole. Probably one of the worst I have ever had to be honest. I am from California so I was spoiled at a young age with good Guac so this wasn't authentic by any means. You can tell it was made fresh but it lacked 2 essential ingredients; onion and cilantro. It also needed salt and pepper as it was so bland and only tasted like avocado. We then had the truffle flat-bread which was pretty awesome. The arugula was a nice touch. Nothing that hasn't been done before but still very delicious. My friend got the pork chop which was really tasty. Nice rub on it, very sweet. I got the veggie burger. Very good veggie burger, sweet potato fries were also really good. We also shared a truffle mac n cheese which was delicious. We ended the meal with the adult milkshake which was amazing and a good size as we were so full. Overall, it's nice they put a Del Frisco's Grille and not their high end steak house as it's nice to have a good eatery that is affordable but provides a nicer atmosphere than a dive bar like Hoboken is full of.
2016-01-24,2,Gave this place 3 tries. Steaks are way overpriced given there overall quality  (my friend and I both ordered the ribeye and they looked like 2 different cuts) drinks are pricey drafts were uninspiring. Wine  list is very good however food is really lacking. Lunch was really pricey  ( 2 adults and 2 teens no  liquor 2 apps 3 grill cheese and tomato bisque and 1 veggie burger 4 soft drinks  $100 smackers ouch! Tomato bisque was awful) I'm done here!
2016-01-24,2,I guess I am biased because I love the REGULAR del Friscos steakhouse. This place is simply a giant impersonal corporate shell with only a  few steaks on the menu and NO raw bar. Wassup? Isn't Hoboken good enough for a REAL Del Friscos?  Del Frisco grill? Just pass! Go to a really Dek Friscoes.
2016-01-24,4,Have eaten here a few times and the food has been really good. Especially liked the bloody Mary's at brunch. The tuna tartare tacos appetizer is really delicious too. Would recommend.
2016-01-18,4,Went there for my sister's birthday as she has Celiac Disease and they have Gluten free food. Place was kinda busy for a Sunday evening/night, though I believe she made a reservation ahead of time so once we go there we only had to wait maybe a minute or two to get seated. It was kinda dark were we were sitting, but that really only bothered my dad who wanted to take photos, it was fine for eating and talking and such. I felt the menu was sort of limited and pricey but to be fair I don't usually go to restaurants like this very often. I didn't like how the Menu was labeled though, for example appetizers where "Food to Fight Over", I don't usually fight over appetizers at a restaurant. Anyway, got the Green Chili Cheeseburger, and it was pretty good. It wasn't the most amazing burger experience I've had in my life but it was tasty burger. The French fries (not sure still if the regular fries came with the burger or if you had to pay extra as the sweet potato fries on the bottom seemed to be extra) were actually really good, probably the best regular fries I've had in a while and the little Ketchup bottle that came with the fries was completely adorable to the point where I had to point it out to the waitress who told me many people love those little bottles. Wait staff was very nice, when they thought they lost my sister's birthday cake(which was my mom's fault for not explaining she had the cake the whole time) they were completely awesome about, doing their best to get it all resolved as best they could. Very nice. However it felt like we were waiting longer than we needed to after dinner, which made me a little antsy as the only place I found to park was a parking garage and I didn't want a huge parking bill to pay. Overall, I'd say it's a nice place to eat, food is good, a little expensive though and wasn't amazing enough for me to go back "just for the food" so I probably wouldn't eat here unless for a special occasion. The view of NYC is gorgeous btw, check that out as you leave!
2016-01-18,4,Good local place in the Hoboken area. Big space, nice choices for lunch and good quality steaks. Service is attentive. Recommended if you are in Hoboken
2016-01-17,3,Seated an hour late at 9:30 for our 8:30 reservation, then waited another 5 minutes before even seeing a server. Food was mediocre to good depending on what you ordered. Unfortunately the restaurant's inability to manage expectations regarding seating time overshadowed the food. All in, OKAY experience. Would probably avoid this place on a weekend, even with a reservation.
2016-01-16,1,My husband and I frequently went to this restaurant when it first opened and loved it. Unfortunately, tonight was not as expected. Service was so slow, food came out late, our waiter had way too many tables to tend to...as a well respected business I expect more. Our waiter Anthony was great but was completely overwhelmed with tables to be able to attend to our table the way it should have been. Hopefully if we go back next time things will be better.
2016-01-16,4,Classy place for a business lunch of 6 - fortunately a late lunch on a cold weekday, so the place was mostly empty and we were seated as soon as they set the table for us. Everyone enjoyed the food, which included the deviled eggs, tuna tartare taco, philly cheesesteak egg roll, shaved steak sandwich au jus, roast chicken, lamb burger, salmon and steak. Honestly, my only complaint was that the place was very cold. I had to roll down the sleeves on my flannel shirt (work shirt, wasn't expecting to be at a nice place for lunch) and was pondering putting on my hoodie. One of my coworkers pulled the trigger on that and was sitting in a nice, dimly lit, semi-formal eating establishment in a patterned hoodie because it was hovering around 60 if that. I felt bad for the hostess and waitresses in short skirts on a slow day like that.
2016-01-15,4,This is a welcome addition to the neighborhood, considering the only other steak houses are Arthur's Tavern (3rd and Washington) and DIno and Harry's (14th and Garden).  The vibe of this place is more similar to dino and harry's as it's "nicer." This is the hipper version of a steakhouse - it's not "old" and stuffy and it's not divey either.  [I think the Del Frisco's Grille in Rock Center is nicer tho]. I sat at a booth by the kitchen.  Honestly, I think the restaurant can't make up it's mind.  The lighting isn't dim enough for it to feel super swanky.  But I love the way the circle lights overhead look.  I also liked that the booth had hooks for coats.  They also have a coat check at the hostess stand if you are put at a table. There is a bar with a pretty large bar space tucked in the front corner behind the host area.  Might be a good place to catch a game or grab pre-dinner drinks also. I wasn't super hungry this time around so only ordered a spicy pork flatbread and the signature ahi tuna entrée. Both were really delicious and the portions were surprisingly larger than I would expect them to be at a place like this.  Hanger steak is $25 / A 16 oz. rib eye will set you back $41. The clientele was mostly post-business happy hour hang-arounders and younger people ready to go out on the town.  So when you visit here, don't dress like a bum.  While you will be allowed in, you'll generally stick out because everyone else is put together nicely. Obviously many people come for the steak and other hearty entrees.  But it's also nice that they serve lower priced items as well such as sandwiches, burgers & salads all the time.  Some of the appetizers looked large enough to fill someone up also.  Everyone can come here and have a great meal regardless of their budgetary restrictions.
2016-01-13,5,Everything i've tasted at DF's has been great. The NY Strip was awesome - really one of the best i've had, perfect char, medium-rare+ and melt in your mouth, with great seasoning. I've had it twice, and both times it was bangin. The cheesesteak eggrolls are also the best i've ever had, they are plain addictive. The special wagyu burger was very good - but needed to be juicier and and a bit better seasoned. Still I crushed it, so it was good. And the Sirloin Steak Salad to-go, that was a big winner with the Mrs. Worth the high price tag. It's great to have 2 legit steakhouses, both unique, in the Boken.
2016-01-12,3,Food was phenomenal however the hostess told us an hour wait for our table on a Saturday night. We were sitting at bar until we got our seats ... An hour and a half later ...still nothing so we just ate at bar. An accurate time would have been helpful. Also she never got us for our seats so we could have been waiting all night!
2016-01-12,4,A great new place in town. Food was delicious, service was good (not exceptional). Fantastic view of the New York City Skyline and definitely a more scene-y crowd for downtown Hoboken.
2016-01-10,4,Let me start out by saying that I would have given it a 3 star if it wasn't for the amazing service! Our server AJ, was great! So friendly and gave us recommendations that were spot on!! I used to work in the service industry so I always like to ask the staff what there recommendations are since they know the food. We started off with the ahi tuna tacos and philly cheese steak rolls which were amaZing!! I also would say the Mac and cheese was a favorite. When it comes to the steak you can tell it's the "grill" not the best steak. Their steak cuts are not as good as the main Del Friscos, but still tasty. We kept getting checked up on by management and staff throughout the whole night and got Brussels sprouts comped because it came out a few mins late! Great service!! The ambiance is nice accept I hate how bright it is!! They need to dim the lights. It's also hard to look at the light cement flooring  that makes the space a little cheap. I would def come back if you want high end bar food with a more trendy vibe!
2016-01-03,4,I'm a huge fan of the 'regular' Del Frisco's in NYC et al.This does a good job of being a more casual version of Del Frisco's.  There's a good amount of overlap.  VIPs, some of the steaks... both delicious.Service is younger and less formal.  A bunch of cheaper apps and sides make it much cheaper, easier to do on a regular night than Del Frisco's.Steak quality is almost as good as the original.  Service is a step down but solid.Really like this place, have been a few times and will continue to go.
2016-01-03,2,I'm just not down with Del Frisco's. Last night was my 4th trip there, and I don't foresee a 5th visit in my future. The food is pretty good, but the service and value isn't there.Received the wrong salad not once but twice. Annoying. Didn't receive silverware until requested, and after my husband had his salad in front of him for 15 minutes. He also had to send his steak back because it was cold. I don't think I've ever seen him return food to the kitchen, ever. No paper towels in the ladies room. My rare tuna came out medium. That's a lotta strikes.Service needs polishing. Atmosphere needs work (dim those overheads and provide candles on the table, maybe?) And food runners need to read the tickets before bringing incorrect orders to the table. Would love to see a shrimp option on the menu. Also, not trying to be mean, but I don't need to hear ahout those cheesesteak eggrolls from your servers every single time I eat here. Not necessary. Next time, going elsewhere.
2015-12-31,3,This was our first time at Del Friscos grille. When we walked in, we loved the decor and ambiance. The wait staff was friendly, and attentive (as you would expect at a steakhouse) We ordered the prime cheeseburger and the 16 oz prime New York strip. The cheeseburger was flavorful and worth every penny. The steak and potatoes came out room temperature and needed to be sent back to be reheated. There is no comparison to the meat quality at the Double Eagle Del Friscos in Manhattan. Overall, the food was very good, however, this deserves at 3 star rating due to the fact that the food is expected to be better for the price that is paid. We would come back here for "bar food" but we will not be returning for a upscale/steak dinner.
2015-12-30,2,Considering the location and the service you would have thought they would have done a better job with the food. I had the lamb burger and it was ok. The roll was spongy yet toasted which meant old. My brother had a nice chicken dish however the string beans were waxy. The service was good however a little too pushy in ordering specialty drinks, apps and desert  and everything we ordered was to "die for" per our waiter. Now I understand ownership wants her to push certain items but please don't be that transparent. Trying to be NYC chic in Hoboken aint workin.
2015-12-29,4,It's exactly like the chain, Houston's, and has great service. You can tell the waiters have been extremely well trained being that they memorized everything and give recommendations for every course without being asked. It gives hearty meals with loads of herbs and sauces. The portions are pretty decent bring that they fill you up, but you won't have any left to take home.I definitely recommend the crab cake appetizer. It's three words: the bees knees. I also got the salmon which was pretty big and comes with a brussel sprout /quinoa salad. The only downer to this place is that it's super loud and the tables are so big that it makes it especially hard to hear people. But hey, an over crowded restaurant is a better problem to have than an empty one
2015-12-29,3,The food is ok. For the price, I would rather have gone some place else and saved money
2015-12-29,2,I went to Del Frisco's Grille last night for dinner for my birthday. I made a reservation and updated it when I knew my party size grew. Due to the hail and having a 7 month old we were 15 minutes late for the reservation, but part of the party had arrived at 7 and we met at the table. Before I could even take my coat off and sit down the server tried to take my drink order as well as the others at the table. We said we need a bit of time to get settled, and she came back 2-3 minutes later and took our order. 5 minutes after that she came back to take our appetizer and dinner order, and within 15-20 minutes we had our main courses in front of us. This may appear as efficient and great service, but this was a birthday dinner and we felt rushed out the entire time. I understand the majority of the party was 15 minutes late for a reservation, but it was a Monday night and there was no wait when we left around 8:20PM. The food itself was okay. I had the Deviled Eggs which were good, and the Parmesan - Lemon Sole which didn't have a ton of flavor, but wasn't bad. My mom got the steak and it came with chips and fries. Our table was cleared when the majority of us were finished, and my mom's plate disappeared before she could say if she was done or not (she wasn't). Before we saw the dessert menu (I had been thinking about the lemon cake since I read the menu online) we were brought a chocolate cake with a candle in it for my birthday. I don't eat a ton of chocolate so I passed it around the table. I only had room for one dessert and appreciated them putting a candle in it, but I didn't order the chocolate cake and it was brought out almost immediately after our entree plates were cleared. We were soon brought the check and we headed out. I really wanted to enjoy my birthday dinner, and while the company was great, and the food was decent I couldn't help but feel rushed, and a bit of a nuisance. I truly hope this review does not come across as spoiled as this is not my intention; my husband and I don't get out a ton right now since we have the baby so any time we do go out we like to savor the moment.
2015-12-27,5,Absolutely wonderful meal I had the mesquite smoked pork chop and it was great. Also please try their signature white sangria it has a popsicle in it a freaking popsicle people....SO GOOD!!! Dessert was the butterscotch pudding jar....HEAVENLY!!!!
2015-12-25,3,Popped by here - plenty of elbow space, and yes, the only entry is on the River Dr., don't try to go through the W hotel (they redirect you). There's street and lot parking nearby, but nothing valet or similar (the valet there is for the hotel, so be warned).Staff is friendly and young (quite interesting set of tattoos on a few of them, they seem to have quite a few goth-loving servers that night based on the dark make-up and piercings), but set up quickly and off to our seats. The wine and drinks were quick, then they came back multiple times as we tried to figure out the menu.Starters:- Ahi tuna tacos: so-so, a touch spicy so that was a nice kick. Never been a huge fan, and these didn't wow me as anything to order again.- Cheesesteak eggrolls: Ah, these are good, hot and delicious with just the right amount of savory steak that's juicy and a mix of cheese and a BBQ sauce on the side to useMain:- Prime Beef Short Rib Stroganoff was good - could have done with a bit more al dente pasta to balance the rib meat. Meat was very salty, but was soft and fell apart without the knife. - Others at the table had the Mignon and they enjoyed it (I did not try)Sides like the shaved brussel sprouts w/ bacon was a little dry, and the fries were fries, but helped balance out the meat.Dessert: - Nutella Bread Pudding was fantastic. Highly recommend - we were the envy of the tables in the area. - Lemon Doberge Cake - only get this if you like lemon/lime meringue pie. Otherwise, skip.Overall, a good experience and moved up a touch just because of the friendly service and will have to go back and try some of the other dishes!
