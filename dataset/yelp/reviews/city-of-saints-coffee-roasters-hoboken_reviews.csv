2021-07-06,2,Never was a fan of their coffee (and I LOVE coffee). Their cold brew was fine, their cappuccino was awful. I went in the summer sometimes because it's super close. Now, they won't let you buy coffee without a mask on. I don't even have a strong stance on the political aspect, but I just wasn't even allowed to buy coffee and had no warning. You can buy one from them, but if you feel that strongly as a business, just give them away. Frustrating, won't go back, and will be recommending my friends to many other local coffee shops that need business.
2021-03-24,5,Much like any other American I too find my cup of coffee an imperative part of my day. Needless to say, a perfect cup of coffee in its many forms can enhance your day at any point but, a warm embrace(considering all COVID restrictions and rules, obviously) and friendly conversation can turn the unimaginable dread of a Monday into a brand new outlook on life. If ever I walk in and find Ricky behind the counter, I know I'm in for a treat. Aside from a perfect cortado with oat milk, I'll always find a well versed conversationalist just waiting for a spark of conversation. Even if one person reads this, it's important for you to know; quality coffee, a variety of dairy and non dairy choices, and an amazing staff with exceptional costumer service skills await. Beyond pleased with Saints coffee and plan on enjoying my oat milk cortado for the foreseeable time.
2020-08-13,5,Oh freaking livia! WE love Olivia, she is one of the kindest baristas ever. She never fails to make the delicious Cinnamon Vanilla Oat Ice Latte. I am so grateful I stumbled across this place and when Olivia is there I'm even more grateful! Love COS!
2020-05-01,5,I went there a couple of months ago when Covid just started. We couldn't sit there but had a latte to takeout. It was really good! Maybe because it was cold and drizzling and the hot latte was melting my body but it was really good! I'm going to return when all this craziness is over and try other things on their menu. Also they gave me a $5 coupon so that's a plus!
2020-04-01,4,Small coffee shop that packs a punch!  When I say small I mean tiny.  Probably only 4-5 people can fit in here comfortably. It isn't the place that you would come to hang out anyway. It seems like more of a grab and go.  You can be in and out quickly too so the efficiency in here is on point.  The place is clean and has a modern hipster vibe to it. Cool spot. I do love the matcha in here! My favorite! The coffees are also on point.  So many options. I also tried the different croissants too. I don't think they make them in house but they were fresh. The true test of a croissant is the flakyness and this one passed the test.  Ultimately though you come for the coffee/tea and that is the star of the show. The staff are kind and the prices are right around what you would expect from a cool coffee spot like this. I would come check it out since there aren't a ton of coffee options on 14th/15th street.
2019-12-30,4,Great coffee spot in Hoboken! I was coming out from watching a movie at the Bow Tie cinemas and wanted an iced latte. I found this place nearby and it did not disappoint! I got an iced latte to go and enjoyed it. They also have an assortment of pastries and other things. You can also add cbd to your drink. Definitely recommend if you are in the area.
2019-09-02,5,I've gotten a double shot of espresso at almost every coffee shop in Hoboken and this is the place I return to most often. Baristas actually know what they're doing and the beans are high quality.
2019-08-14,2,Cute shop, friendly barista at the counter, but the coffee was disappointing.The other barista that was crafting my drink ended up making a really watered down iced latte. The coffee shop itself is quite tiny.  There are a few barstools, but I wouldn't recommend hanging out in there.  They do have a couple of outdoor tables which is nice.Try the other local coffee shops around the corner.  I'd skip this one unless you're enthused by drinking some overpriced H2O.
2019-08-04,1,This place is overrated and overpriced. Walked in with my husband today to give it another shot, since he had a $5 promotional coupon. Initially ordered an iced americano. The coffee was SO sour. I said something to the barista who very kindly offered to redo my order and I went for a down the fairway double espresso order instead. He also again very kindly asked me to try my drink to make sure it was to my liking. I sipped and kindly nodded yes because honestly there was nothing to be salvaged here. The espresso was marginally more digestible in taste but simply put the coffee is sour, and the roast terrible. To the owner- fix your product. It's not as sweet as you think it is and get your employees an AC for crying out loud. If you can charge $5 cold brews you can afford an AC unit. You officially have two less customers. To fellow Hoboken residents- save your money and take it to another local business that is worth it.
2019-06-28,1,So the reason why I am writing this review is not about rating their coffee but for the fact that the owner of this place has his employees working in a 95 degree weather with no ac. I walked in today for my morning coffee and the people who are working there work under inhumane conditions. This is a shame!!!! And a reason why I actually wouldn't return!
2019-02-17,5,Love this spot! Staff is super friendly and coffee is delish! I love the mochas, and they have many sweet treats!
2019-01-21,2,Great coffee... but poor to terrible customer service by the girl with colored green hair.. she completely killed it for me and since I have not been back.. I had an important meeting, went to Saints to show off a Hoboken local coffee shop.. story short she tried giving me a box of coffee without anything .. no cups, cream, sugar .. nothing ... I get better service at Starbucks .. so that's where I get coffee for meetings now .. disappointing..
2018-12-28,5,Great strong latte which is just what I needed for a Saturday morning post workout Efficient and pleasant service by the baristas
2018-12-24,1,I honestly don't understand how this place stays in business .  You have one mission which is to sell coffee ,  and what do most people want with their coffee is milk.  I went twice this week and both times they didn't have skim milk,  my god there  are two bodegas a stones throw away and you can't go and buy skim milk for your customers ?  What a joke .  Only a matter of time before this place goes out of business.  Also don't waste your money on the dough doughnuts they are stale and disgusting .  Shame on you for selling old expired products.
2018-11-05,2,Usually have a pretty good experience here, but yesterday got a terrible cold brew.  Tasted like dirty water with really no flavor.  Was in a rush, so didn't have time to go back in the store.  Ended up having to throw the coffee away as it was undrinkable. Not sure what happened.  Their Dough donuts and other pastries are delicious. Coffee seems to be very hit or miss for me.
2018-09-15,5,I've traveled all over the world and this coffee shop hands down has the best espresso and cappuccino I've ever had!
2018-08-13,5,What a lovely little coffee shop, what lovely baristas'. Our baristas name was Olivia. What a friendly person, what a beautiful smile! And by the way, she pours a mean cup of Joe, with a cute heart made out of foam. I hear she can write your name in foam, ask her, tell her Jackie sent you!Support your local shops.
2018-05-06,5,Love this coffee shop! Always great featured blends , delicious lattes , and donuts too . Staff are always super friendly and quick . One of the best coffee shops in Hoboken !
2018-04-09,5,Amazing coffee; nice sitting out front; good friendly staff...if I had one gripe, I wish they had more room to sit inside! But if you are in the area you can pop in and grab coffee on the way to the bus or read out front in the sun. This place makes me happy and is my favorite in the area.
2018-04-03,5,It's definitely a good choice coffee in Hoboken especially when they offer oat milk for the choice. It's a chain store and they also have locations in nyc. The barista in this coffee shop is always very nice and their service is very good. I would say this coffee shop may not stand out in nyc but I tried a couple times already and they're definitely improving. The price is very reasonable and affordable for a cup of coffee with good quality. We need more coffee shops like this in Hoboken. Otherwise there are so many coffee shops in Hoboken are overpriced with bad quality.
2018-01-02,4,Had the cinnamon vanilla latte great coffee in Hoboken. Was waiting for the bus in the freezing cold but kept warm in this cute coffee shop. Haven't tried their pastries yet, but i heard they are scrumptious
2017-10-28,4,This is a tiny coffee shop but they have a nice amount of outdoor seating, the staff are friendly and helpful, prices are good and the coffee is very good. They also sell Dough doughnuts which is a giant plus. I'm giving them four stars rather than five only because they don't have a restroom.
2017-10-01,5,The Misty Valley started my morning on the right foot. Constantly evolving as it cooled. The baristas pointed me in the right direction with their suggestion. The cafe is located in a great little neighborhood of Hoboken. Quiet on the weekend mornings, and a scenic place to sip.
2017-07-22,2,This place is way overpriced for what you get. Ordered a vanilla chai for $6. It was small, mostly ice, and lacked flavor.
2017-06-28,2,Cold brew is not good. sorry to say.   Pastry selections are also lacking.  Their donuts look appealing but once you bite into it you realize it's mostly just dense and cakey and hard to choke down. I've given this place so many tries because of the convenient location for me, but it's extremely overpriced and just not good at all.  I sincerely suggest they step it up because I hear choc o pain is opening a new location near by.
2017-05-01,1,I really wish this place was better. I've given it so many try's, its way over priced and sadly their green tea lattes taste like water. I couldn't even drink it. For $4 got 8 oz... and it's just steamed nonfat milk tinted green. Yuck :( needs more matcha, not a pre mixed water based mix. Sorry guys!
2017-04-18,5,These guys are amazing .as soon as I walk in they know my order . Friendly clean prompt . Best neighborhood coffee spot . Since coming here I've ordered many diff styles of drinks . Outdoor seating too .
2017-04-09,3,Hoboken has so many awesome coffee shops it's hard at times to keep up with them all. City of Saints is located on 14th street near shipyards which makes it a great area especially for those entering Hoboken from UC or Weehawken. Inside is very cozy but narrow and they offer a few stools if you want to stay and enjoy your order. I found my iced vanilla latte to be ok but not one of the best. For me it was lacking any flavor. I guess I could've added some sugar to sweeten it up but I was on the go and skipped that possibility. However their glazed donut was delicious and huge! Baked fresh daily they offer a small variety of donuts but boy oh boy if you're a donut lover like me you'll go in just for the goody. City of Saints has me sold on their donuts and muffins but not so much on their coffee. I'll be back to scoop up one of those for sure in the future but maybe pass on their coffee.
2017-04-03,5,Great coffee! Friendly baristas! Haven't had a drink I don't like. Sadly there is no indoor seating area. Other than that it's the perfect spot to get your caffeine fix!
2017-04-02,4,If you gave up pretty much all desserts for Lent, but then forgot to include donuts, and then decided that donuts are okay, sometimes you're going to want to get a donut.And when you get that donut, you're going to want it to be a really good donut. Nothing DD has could come close. You'd go to Dough in NYC, but there's a river in the way and you need that donut right now.Coffee would be a nice complement, but you're really focused on this donut situation. Good thing City of Saints has delicious donuts in a tiny display case inside their very tiny store.Get there relatively early on the weekends; "i'm sorry we are out of donuts" has been uttered to be once or twice before. Get a coffee, get literally any donut. I got a glazed on Saturday and it was the best brunch appetizer i've ever had. Don't be dissuaded by a line that goes to the door; their place fits about 6 people at a time so it's actually barely a line.To summarize - coffee. donut. donut. donut.
2017-04-02,5,This is our go-to coffee shop in the neighborhood, and while I don't want other people to discover it, I want to support this local business and help it stay in the neighborhood! Yes, it's small, but super cute and you can tell that the staff/owner put their heart into the shop. I always get served with a smile, and they make delicious coffee and cappuccinos that taste significantly better than normal chain coffee shops. If you get bothered at having to wait for more than 1 minute for real espresso and frothed milk as some reviewers below, by all means go down the street to starbucks for some brown flavored acid water and burnt milk. If you want real artisan coffee, treat yourself here. As a side note, they also sell fresh coffee beans and I buy a box from here every week any they even grind it for my french press! Much tastier than what you buy in the supermarket.
2017-03-25,4,Been here for a few times already. Very friendly and cozy. Like their expresso a lot yet they have good pour over and latte too.
2017-03-10,5,Good coffee and they even have some bakery stuff (which are great too) ! It's very tiny and have 2 window seats, which I really like. Waaaaay better than the burned Starbucks coffee and you pay half the price lolLove it ! Will be back!
2017-02-20,3,Cozy spot to grab a quick cup off coffee. The prices are high for an average offering of coffee and espresso drinks (I.e. $4.50 for a cold brew), which is disappointing considering other cafes in the area with lower prices.
2017-01-16,5,I love the coffee here. They make awesome lattes, I get a 4 shot skim milk latte and they nail it every time I come. The price is within normal range, my friend and I ordered two lattes and a donut to share and the total was under 13 dollars. The doughnuts come from the Plant and are massive and very doughy so if you prefer lighter doughnuts don't get them here but they are still pretty stellar. Parking is pretty tough in this area, so take a walk over instead !
2016-10-11,5,Great neighborhood place with outdoor seating. The people here are always pleasant and extremely knowledgeable about their coffee. They make any flavors they use in-house as well. Couldn't ask for a better neighborhood coffee spot
2016-07-10,5,This is a great little coffee place. It's perfect every time and they do some lovely coffee art too when you order a latte. Nice pastries as well. You can sit outside and enjoy your coffee or walk around town or down to the Hudson.
2016-03-22,5,I went in to get a coffee, order my drink and went to pay and realized I didn't have my wallet....told the guy to cancel my order and he's said that's ok, it's on him today! He was very nice for doing that, I will def go back! Coffee was great as well!!
2016-03-06,4,I truly enjoy tasting the different coffee selections in the area and thoroughly enjoyed City of Saints. Their cold brew is superb! In the summer, they offer a honey ginger iced brew that will knock your socks off. I appreciate places that give thought to the craft.... And really, just sugar and milk (different varieties) make for a great cup of Joe. Price point is average for the location...the spot is quite small, but adequate for a nice grab and go. I'm actually surprised there are only a few reviews for this place...stay around and give them a chance. I'll certainly be there often.
2016-02-16,2,I have driven past this place so many times and never stopped in to visit! Yesterday, I finally had a chance to try their coffee. I ordered a hot latte with almond milk. My coffee was around 4-5 bucks. I don't exactly remember. Price was pretty average for fancy coffee shops. There was a significant wait to receive my order. Coffee: it was luke warm. The taste was rich and bold but I couldn't get over the lack of hotness. I might be back to try their iced coffee. So far, I'm not too impressed.
2016-02-15,5,Love this place so much. The staff are so nice and welcoming, drinks are made well - quality of the coffee is great and things aren't overly sweetened. Not to mention their delicious pastries! Dough doughnuts are heaven (obviously) but their savory baked goods are amazing as well. Would come here every morning if I could!
2016-02-06,5,The best coffee shop in Hoboken in terms of bean quality, drink quality and service. I happily bypass the Starbucks on my block en route to City of Saints for my coffee on a regular basis.Seth, the proprietor of this location, is very knowledgable and passionate about coffee, and he shares both freely. Ask him about any of the beans they brew or sell, and he'll provide tasting descriptors and background on where they were sourced.When you have a few extra minutes to spare, order a pour over. They take the process seriously, and it's worth the wait!
2016-01-02,4,The coffee is super creamy. That has to be the best way to describe it. Stopped here on the way to the city and was super pleased with the service and the cups of coffee. Would love to come back in the summer and sit outside and enjoy. We will definitely be back.
2016-01-02,3,Cute place if small. Ordinary coffee was bitter and not very hot. No real seating inside besides a few uncomfortable stools. Nice outdoor area.
2016-01-02,2,LOL as I walked in, a man was complaining about his watered down latte... Then I too was plagued with a crap dirty chai that, despite adding their house vanilla syrup to, tasted like water.
2015-10-04,2,The coffee is delicious. Smooth, creamy, wonderful!The service is unnerving. Don't come here if you are catching the bus to work because you will not make it. Takes at least 10 min to get your cup of coffee. I understand artisan coffee takes time but when the tiny cafe is packed with customers, then the pace at which the staff moves will give you anxiety. I have just run out, sans my paid for coffee, to make the bus.
2015-09-06,5,Cannot get enough of this place! The outdoor seating is clutch when it's nice out. The inside is a little small but there's counter space to enjoy your coffee. The wooden decor inside makes for a calming place to do some work. There's the perfect amount of drink selections. They don't get crazy...just coffee and tea basics. I also really like how they ask which milk I'd prefer in my coffee. There's a small selection of treats and yogurt as well, some with gluten free options. The workers are also super chill. Just an overall cool vibe.
2015-08-12,5,I wasn't thrilled about having to spend my birthday at work. And I was extra not thrilled about having to travel to Jersey from NYC. That all changed when I walked in here. The staff was so friendly and helpful. The inside is a bit tight but there's nice outdoor seating. There was a gentleman whose name I didn't catch making drinks, and he made me a yummy almond milk matcha latte. I was really overwhelmed with how good it was. I think my partner got annoyed after about the 5th time I insisted he try it. I wish I could've taken this place back with me to the city, but if I'm ever in Hoboken again in the future, I'll be sure to stop in!
2015-08-02,4,The coffee is absolutely delicious and I am loving their featured vanilla cinnamon iced latte.Good to know: place is very tiny, there isn't much food or variety in the menu - it's all about the coffee and they do it right. Also nowhere to really sit except outside.Service can be a bit slow.
2015-06-25,5,Once Red Lion it's become my favorite hang out. Staff are friendly and comfortable to enjoy a cup of joe, when there is seating. Keep up the great work you provide to us loyal customers
2015-04-16,5,Seth took care of us while getting our coffee, he's awesome. My capuccino was just perfect, didn't need sugar at all. They are also making this delicious Mint Matcha Latte, didn't expect it to be this good. The croissants were pretty great as well. Prices are decent, i didn't feel like I was paying too much. I'm glad this place is around, would hate having to go to a Starbucks.
