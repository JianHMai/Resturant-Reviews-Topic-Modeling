2021-11-15,2,The service was great but the portions were tiny and well overpriced! The fries potstickers tasted similar to what I get at the frozen section at Trader Joe's. My friend got a lomein dish which looked and smelled amazing but $20 for lomein is a little much. I did like that they were BYOB though and the server was very nice. Dessert was tasty (we got the fried lava cake) but it was so small for the $9. If you're going and just want your own entree, either skip the dumplings or get them as an appetizer instead.
2021-11-11,5,I went to Touch the Heart on a Friday night. I made reservations the day before and was easily able to get a table, but I checked again the day of and there were limited options, so if you want to go on a weekend, consider planning ahead. It's BYOB so my friend and I brought some vodka for the mocktails. They were able to make the mocktail with our vodka, so we didn't have to pour it in ourselves. We got the pitcher of the strawberry smash and it was more than enough for two, and very yummy. The Chinese roasted BBQ Brussel sprouts we started with were absolutely amazing, I would go back just to have those. We also had the scallion pancakes, the pork gyoza, and the beef Dan Dan. Of those, the only one I wouldn't try again is the pork gyoza, but I could be skewed because it came out a bit cold. Overall, I loved dining here, would highly recommend, and will most certainly be back.
2021-11-02,5,This place is fantastic!! We hosted my sister's baby shower here and had the whole place to ourselves which was wonderful. It is BYOB but their mocktails are so so good and you can always bring your own alcohol to make it a cocktail. All of the food was incredible: ham egg and cheese bao buns, lox and cream cheese tea sandwiches, French toast, dumplings... all amazing! Highly recommend for any meal or an event!
2021-10-29,5,Great vegetarian friendly restaurant. Delicious cocktails and even better if you bring your own spirits.
2021-10-24,2,Incredible food--soup dumplings were amazing. However, the quality of service was unfortunate. Extremely slow and disorganized. I don't think this is the fault of the servers as I can tell the establishment is understaffed. Hopefully they can improve!
2021-10-19,5,I ordered the Crab Rangoon nachos and Sesame Chicken Lo Mein & both were delicious! I loved the cilantro and jalapeños with the Rangoon & the chicken was perfect with the Lo Mein.  I highly recommend this spot if you want great dim sum!
2021-10-13,5,Do not miss out on this cute asian fusion cafe in Hoboken! I decided to try this place out for my birthday brunch after passing by previously and seeing how cute the interior was as well as the menu. I ordered the scallion pancake eggs benedict, which the chef left off the crab for me since I am vegetarian and it came with a generous side of potatoes. The flavors were vibrant and the texture of the scallion pancake remained crispy even with the hollandaise and eggs on top. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffle dumplings, which he enjoyed. We shared the matcha french toast, which tasted great, but was a little bit burnt in someplaces- this did not stop us from eating the whole plate! In addition, the prices are reasonable, the service was quick, and the interior of the restaurant is very aesthetic.
2021-10-08,1,The menu looked so promising and I was excited to try many things on menu. However, Every single one of them was totally disappointing! Everything was either undercooked or overcooked. The flavors were off and the service was slow. Too many fried options on menu as well. Save your $$ do not come here.
2021-10-06,3,Used to be great but it seems like the quality has declined over the last year. At this point I don't think the food justifies the price. I wonder if a chef that's as there initially left.
2021-09-30,5,I have been wanting to try this place for months. I finally made the reservation and went with two friends. The atmosphere is beautiful- very boho style. We ordered 6 items off the menu and split everything. There was not one thing we didn't like. I'm still thinking about the pork bao buns. The crab Rangoon appetizer was also a hit. I will definitely be coming back here! If you're looking for Asian food with an American twist, I'd come here!
2021-09-23,3,Pork buns are only good when they have pork belly in it, which melts in your mouth. But here it was a chunk of pork medium rare. Also chicken bun had a unique texture of pork floss which gives looks good, but I didn't enjoy the taste. Scallion pancake - I would say please remove them from your menu as they are not at all good. So I'll have to pass on these 3 items next time. Best was sweet potatoes dumpling
2021-09-19,1,Food was horrible but the service was awesome so this feels bad. From what I hear the owner fired the chef.
2021-09-14,4,Was strolling down Washington and my friend and I decided to give this place a try since it just recently opened. It's BYOB and they have amazing mock tails and chaser to go with whatever you bring. We decided to start off with the crab Rangoon. I give the presentation 10/10. It was played very nicely and elegant. However I give the dish itself maybe 6/10. The pastry was very fluffy however they could have done better with the filling. There was barely any crab stuffed, just a bunch of cheese. I decided to get the hot honey fried chicken bao and the sesame chicken lo mein. My friend got the surf n turf fried rice. The bao was so delicious. Maybe my favorite thing on the menu so far. It's so rich with flavor and the hot chicken was very southern and perfect. However the sesame chicken lo mein was not what I expected; it was grilled chicken and nothing like the Chinese food however the noodles were very good with all the vegetables. The surf n turf fried rice was very good as well. The steak was very juicy and the jumbo shrimp as well. Well deff go back to try their brunch menu!
2021-09-10,5,Name something better than a restaurant that has incredible food, a great playlist, stunning décor, and a friendly, attentive staff. That's Touch The Heart for you. As a self proclaimed foodie I'm always looking for my next favorite restaurant and have been seriously disappointed by Hoboken's cuisine previously but this wasn't the case. It would probably be easier to list the things I didn't get off the menu since my friend and I came hungry and excited but let me tell you that the scallion pancakes are like nothing you've tried before (how did they mix two cultural staples so well?) they're light, fluffy, crispy, and so flavorful. I also LOVED the fried chicken bao - could probably eat the spicy mayo with a spoon. I am absolutely trying out the hot honey fried chicken bao when I come next. Also the mocktails- so many great reviews of them and they're all true. This is the only spot I haven't felt absolutely weird bringing in a small bottle of liquor. Love how they mix the cocktail for you behind the "bar" so it comes out perfect. Nick, the owner, also told us about the brunch which has a TOWER filled with all these yummy sandwiches and you can get tea out of the most gorgeous teapots I've ever seen. He also mentioned a brownie tempura which is also on my list of things-I-need-to-try-next.Congrats to Nick and the entire Touch the Heart staff. You really brought something new, fun, and delicious to this town and I can't wait to eat here again!
2021-09-09,1,Waitress took our orders but never brought out mine and then had the nerve to ask if I didn't want anything to eat like ma'am I ordered two of the same thing and you only brought one of it out!! The food was very bland as well and felt like a waste of money for a birthday dinner.
2021-09-01,4,Pretty popular new joint in town. We went there on a pleasant evening and liked the overall experience. One point of improvement is sticking to the ingredients of a dish in the menu - Not a big deal however, when my wife pointed out an ingredient that was on her dish, and not in the menu, the owner came out to talk to us and seemed to disagree initially after which my wife read out the ingredients. She acquiesced, and did give us complimentary dessert that was great!
2021-08-30,5,Great ambiance and decor in this restaurant. It is a comfy chic vibe. Perfect for date night or meeting up with friends. We made a reservation for 2 on a Saturday night but it seemed like you could also walk in as it wasn't overly packed.The service and food was amazing. Our server recommended we start with the general tso and chicken teriyaki dumplings. GET THE DUMPLINGS THEY'RE THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD. If ordering again I would get the general Tso as there was a little more flavor to those but depends on your personal preference. Both were so crispy and delicious.We also tried the pork bao buns which were very flavorful. The pork was tender and soft and the whole dish went together very well. Lastly, we tried the sesame chicken lo mein and it was good but not as stand out as the other dishes.I will 100% be back here for this amazing vibe and delicious food.
2021-08-28,3,Drink and food quality doesn't meet the price point.I ordered 4 dishes and the drink,  none of them were good. All the food look like lazy microwave food with no passion. You can see from the picture that they put whole scallions in the dish they not even pretend to cut it to make it look nice for $20 ,fried noodles test like under cooked noodles sautéed with very sweet teriyaki sauce right from the bottle, fried rice was very dry, gyoza fries was super salty because it was soaked in the sauce, the drink was made from concentrated fruit syrup.If you looking for cute place to hangout and pretty nice friendly service this might be good for you but big NO for food.
2021-08-21,2,Once I received my food it ok, however it 30 minutes before my food arrived. I only ordered the french toast. I was having lunch with a friend who order the Chicken & Waffle Dumplings. Her food came out after about 20 minutes mean while I still had nothing. Cute spot, cool location, but the customer experience could use some work.
2021-08-11,1,We were excited to go this place but ended up disappointed after we had a bad experience there. The food sucks...only the starter and drink that were ok...but the main course was terrible. Shrimp bao didn't go well with crushed peanut and pineapples. Kimchi Fried Rice was so hard and too dry. Sesame Chicken Lomein didn't have enough flavor and didn't feel like a sesame sauce at all. The bad thing is service. No server came to check up and ask us how was the food like or refill the water at all. Just took an order, made a drink and put a bill..(they gave us the wrong bill as well). No one took care of us. We won't come back again.
2021-08-08,5,Such a fun menu with a bunch of really great options! Loved ordering a number of different things and sharing! The Shrimp Bao were my favorite thing we tried and the Crab and Coconut Rice was absolutely delicious! Highly recommend and will definitely be going back! The service was also great! It's BYOB but they have mocktails you can add your own liquor to!
2021-08-04,2,Slow service, no water refills and very below average food. Had the honey chicken bao buns where the kimchi overpowered whole dish. Pork nachos were disgusting. Way too much sauce and pork badly cooked. Wanton was over fried but duck was fine. Basic fried rice did not cook eggplant well. Everything is presented well and pretty.
2021-08-04,5,Food was absolutely amazing and the staff was so accommodating and friendly. The atmosphere inside was great, perfect for a date night or a small group of friends. The food was perfect for sharing and all tasted incredible. Already planning what to order next time!Also BYOB which was great and they serve "mocktails" which can be turned into real cocktails if you provide the liquor.
2021-08-01,5,Food and drinks were awesome ! The decor was also super cute ! Definitely want to go back to try the rest of the menu !
2021-07-15,5,This is our new favorite spot!! We've been here several times and the service is always great! The staff is so friendly and attentive! The plates are tapas style which I love because we can try so many different things! The food is full of flavor and has a beautiful presentation! I also love that they have a mocktail menu, it's BYOB so you can add alcohol to them if you wanted to! The flower shop inside is also a pretty cool and unique addition! The flower arrangements are just beautiful! I highly recommend this restaurant!!
2021-07-14,2,My first visit was back in the fall for a friends birthday and had a less than enjoyable experience with several issues that were handled offline by management.A few months later, I decided to give it another try and still unimpressed. The best way to sum up the food...everything just tastes like soy sauce. The ambiance is nice and I want the food to have more depth to match the décor but food is the driving factor to an enjoyable meal out.
2021-07-11,2,They must have got a new chef since the last time I was there in April 2021. The dishes were different and of  lesser quality. The crispy beef was not flank steak, the shrimp bao with chopped up pineapple doesn't compare to the previous recipe a few months ago. And the chicken looked pink and was somewhat mushy. They changed up their menu and the quality of ingredients and it was noticeable. Bring back the California roll!
2021-07-10,4,Chinese American tapas - byob. Super cute decor and a good vibe. Worth going for a date or a group. Small plates to share but not small enough to be served as individual dishes. Avo egg roll and noodle dishes were the best out of the 8 things we tried.
2021-07-08,5,Great spot.  Food is so good, staff is excellent.  Love the BYOB.  My friends had a great time here and I'll definitely be returning.  Touch the Heart!
2021-07-08,5,Great food and service! Was excited to try and it lived up to my expectations. Noodles, dumplings and rice all very good.
2021-06-26,3,Service is good and nice food presentation. i like the ambiance of the resto but i thought the food is a bit pricey for the serving size. food is lacking authenticity.
2021-06-23,4,Found this while walking and had to try it.Went in for a date night and the ambience was lovely. Ordered the mango mocktail for drinks and it was perfect.Loved the hint of spice.For the food we orderedScallion pancakes-Good ,loved the sauce beneath the pancakes.General tsos dumpling-Yum..loved themChicken baos-Very tasty.Shrimp baos-Okay.Bland.Missing some sauce on topCrab and coconut fried rice-Wonderful.PerfectThe service was good....Check this place out if you live in the area.
2021-06-13,5,Such amazing service and food! Always enjoy my time here. BYO and a list of fun mock tails to get!
2021-06-07,3,I recently had dinner at this new spot. I had been noticing it for a while now because the decor was so beautiful and put it on my list of places I wanted to check out. Finally the doors opened and I had an opportunity to dine there. They have a romantic, bohemian garden vibe going on in there. They even serve you your water from a golden watering can which had me cracking upppp! The decor inside is beautiful. Everything is a vibe. The type of food they serve there is asian fusion. I do think sometimes with fusion anything it can be a miss because perhaps some old favorites don't need to be remixed. The pork baos were delish! I highly recommend. I was very excited to see crab rangoon on the menu because I have not had it in a long time and I love crab rangoon. It was ok but I prefer the original crab rangoon. I was a bit disappointed because I was so hyped about having crab rangoon and it wasn't quite what I expected. My friend ordered orange chicken karaage and we actually thought they brought the wrong order to the table because it looked almost black and unappetizing, which is very far from what we expected. Turns out it was the right order but it tasted burnt in an unpleasant way. We barely touched that dish so we decided to ask them about it and according to the manager it was supposed to be served that way so it wasn't a bad batch or anything. Very interesting take on orange chicken in my opinion... I'm not sure many people would enjoy something tasting so burnt. Luckily they offered to either bring us a new one or take it off the bill so we weren't too upset once they were able to remedy the situation. They do have many other items on the menu so if you just avoid the orange chicken karaage you should be good. Also a huge bonus is that it is a BYOB spot. It's the right ambiance to have a nice long meal catching up with friends over wine and tapas.
2021-05-14,4,Only wish they had a liquor license. Drinks and food were great. The place is adorable and can't wait to bring my mom there!
2021-05-01,5,This spot was great for our girls night! It is BYOB and we sat outside, we tried a variety of things on the menu, the gyoza truffle fries, chicken bao, and seafood rice were great. The staff was super friendly and helpful, and even brought us a dessert for a birthday! Can't wait to go back.
2021-04-30,5,This place is so cute ! I went for Valentine's Day . The food was great , BYOB , and they gave flowers at the end. Beautiful interior as well
2021-04-26,5,My wife and I stumbled upon this place walking down Washington St. We just moved to Hoboken from Manhattan and we've found it difficult finding a few to to restaurants for tasty food. This place is amazing, great food, simple refined and elevated Chinese foods that's super clean. The staff was amazing and super kind and the ambience and music were on point. Def out new go to place in Hoboken.
2021-04-25,5,Had a great meal here!! The fried chicken baos were a monthly special and were absolutely incredible. The food came out quickly and was all very delicious. Must try the brownie tempura for dessert, yum!
2021-04-18,1,I was excited to try this spot.  Very disappointed.  Worse Asian fusion food.  However, they have delicious non alcoholic drinks.
2021-04-07,5,Food was creative and delicious, the restaurant is so cute and has a good vibe, and the staff were so kind. Great experience!
2021-04-03,5,I have to say wow! Amazing food, decor and service! Definitely what Hoboken needed, i Recomended the place 100% just beautiful and the flowers are stunning and you can buy flowers in this place, definitely romantic! Love that is a byob, my friends and I had an amazing time. A+ from me and can't wait to come back!
2021-04-02,3,I really wanted to love this place but the food comes up short. Pork Gyoza fries sounds like something I'd take into bed with me but it was just meh. Beef noodles above average menu item. Duck dumpling I'd expect to be exceptional - again meh.
2021-03-21,5,My girlfriend and I love this place more each time we go.  Last night we took a group of twelve to thus restaurant. Again, spectacular. Because of the size of our group and the many interesting menu choices, we ordered family style.  Between the General tso dumplings ,angry lobster dumplings, various lo mein dishes,  crab Rangoon, Cali roll and my personal favorite, The orange chicken, our entire group could not stop raving about the place.   As for the mock tails, the "just add tequila" continues to be my favorite, but there are plenty others to choose from.   And to top it off, the service.   Chloe was wonderful.  Completely capable, sweet and accommodating.  We had two kids with us and in the midst of her serving all our different food, she had no problem accommodating the kids. She made zero mistakes and was quick and very efficient.  Best place in Hoboken whether you want a romantic spot or a great place for a group.  Keep it up!!
2021-03-15,5,A must-try new spot in Hoboken!!! They've got a healthy asian-american "tapas style" menu - the perfect spot to go with a small group so you can try the whole menu (we did!). Definitely not your typical asian food spot, you should stop by if you're looking for instagram-worthy, bougie, seasonal and uncommon creations. We loved the chrysanthemum hot tea but vowed to come back after learning this spot is a BYOB and that they serve fun MOCK-tails! Starters were easy to share with 2-4 pieces/bites per order. We went with scallion pancakes and ube dumplings (super unique and came with yummy orange honey!). Then we added a few mains (definitely sizable enough to share): sesame chicken lo mein, vegetable fried rice, asian mac n cheese, and shrimp bao buns. I knew we were taking a risk with the mac n cheese, but it was not my favorite - a bit spicy and a strange texture, however we licked the lo mein plate clean!!! Even though we were stuffed, we were talked into the s'mores egg rolls that were super fun to put together ourselves. The wait staff was very COVID friendly and accommodating to vegetarian/vegan restrictions. There is still so much on the menu I want to come back and try - and their menu rotates frequently which is another exciting reason to keep up. I would highly recommend stopping by :)
2021-03-12,5,Really love this spot. Food is amazing and BYOB. Keep in mind its meant for family style in big groups. So delicious.
2021-03-07,3,I want to start by saying I really wanted to love it here. Touch the Heart was high on my list of must visits since opening last summer. I can't say it lived up to the expectation set by the other reviews. Pros Ambiance: the décor game is strong. They did a fantastic job setting the tone. They also typically have an outdoor set up in the summer months that adds to the garden vibes. BYOB: It's also BYOB. The menu has a solid selection of mocktails. We decided to do wine. There is no corkage fee. Several tables around us ordered the mocktails. So Instagram-able! COVID: guidelines are strictly followed. Many tables have dividers between them. Five stars for this category. ConsNoise - I don't think I've ever included noise level in one of my reviews, but this needs noted... it is extremely loud inside. We visited for a girls night out and found ourselves constantly leaning closer or repeating each other to be heard over the volume of other tables. I would not recommend as a date spot. You won't be able to hear anything the other person is saying. Food - it's really the food that fell flat here. We ordered the Terriakyi Chicken dumplings, which were okay. They come with 5 in an order so a good size to share with the table. For dinner I had the Mongolian Beef Stir Fry and my friends has the Sesame Chicken. One order of the Sesame Chicken we replaced with shrimp. The staff was very accommodating! My dish was very sweet and the noodles didn't seem fresh at all. The two sesame dishes were so so salty. We were disappointed after we read so many great reviews to feel the food was lacking freshness and flavor. I've seen a lot of reviews talk about the rotating menu. I'd be willing to give it another go here in the future. Possibly in the summer when the patio is open.
2021-02-18,2,So first off my experience is based on delivery. So please keep that in mind. The food was good. Bougie beyond belief - real crab, etc. but really small expensive plates. The food was not worth it at all. $15 for four small dumplings. Way too expensive. I spent $90 on lunch thinking it would cover dinner as well for two of us. It doesn't. Except for the dishes which we didn't like. Overpriced. Good ingredients. Not worth the money. I could have eaten elsewhere and gotten my money worth.
2021-02-12,2,I really wanted to say something great about this place. The atmosphere was adorable and clean. It felt safe to eat even with the pandemic. However, both the surf and turf rice and the Mongolian beef ragu were super salty. It was hard to eat. I really wanted to enjoy myself because we barely go out because the pandemic but the food was honestly inedible. We would be happy to try it again it they decreased the amount of salt in their food.
2021-01-12,5,Love the fusion inspired dishes here but hate how my favorites rotate out - I'll survive though.  I have had the scallion pan cakes, summer roll, crispy lotus root, eggplant LOmein, tofu Bao, Ube dumplings, spinach mozzarella dumplings and god knows what else!  Some of the dishes are amazing some are ok. Scallion pancakes - fluffy and crispy. They do them welll Crispy lotus root - not a lot of flavor here. Just tastes like oil for the most partSummer roll: it's like a veggie burrito. Cold refreshing and I wish it was cut into smaller pieces! Lo mein - tastes mostly like soy sauce Tofu bao - it's pretty freaking good. I wish more restaurants provided a veg option like this one! Ube dumplings - sooo good. Spinach mozzarella dumplings - a perfect fusion of Italian and Asian food. I loved it and wish it was more permanently on the menu.  Oreo dumplings - also insanely unique and delicious!! Overall this place is great, it's byob. The non-alcoholic pitchers are a little pricier then I thought they would be. The only thing they are missing is a variety of sauces to add your own flair to what's being brought to you.
2021-01-11,5,We went to Touch the Heart on a Wednesday evening. We sat outside and there were outdoor heaters which made the space comfortable even in the cold weather. They sanitized the table and chairs before we were seated and all employees were masked. There was another party dining outside and we were socially distanced and there was plenty of airflow in the outside tent.It is BYOB which was really nice as we brought a bottle of wine for the table. I am pregnant so I was hoping for some mocktail options and this is a great location for that! The menu has a lot of mocktail options that you can get by the glass or pitcher and you can then spike with the alcohol you bring if you choose to. The table next to us had ordered pitcher mocktails and brought vodka with them, it seemed like a great option. I ordered the pineapple coconut matcha mocktail which was similar to a light pina colada, it was very good.The food was delicious!!! We started with the crispy green beans and the crab rangoon nachos which were both really great. The crispy green beans were not greasy and were well seasoned and the nachos were small but very tasty.  For entrees I got the Dan Dan Noodles and loved them, would definitely get them again. I also really enjoyed the Kung Pao Shrimp which doesn't appear to be on the menu anymore! A shame, they should bring it back as it was really good. I am looking forward to a repeat visit.
2021-01-08,5,The meal was unreal. The fried chicken bao buns are to die for. The vibes of the place are unmatched and makes for the perfect date night. Love the fact that you can buy a bouquet of flower before you go. The staff is super friendly and I will 100% be returning
2021-01-01,4,Touch the Heart brings some surely needed pan-Asian dishes to Hoboken. It's a step, realistically a leap, above the bottom bin Asian take out joints along Washington. Offerings from the scallion pancake, to the baos, and Asian inspired surf and turf give not only a variety of choices, but also quality in taste. Touch the Heart does not look like your typical Asian restaurant, nor is it managed by Asians, but it delivers a taste on par with finer expectations. Sure you can find cheaper Asian options, but definitely not in Hoboken at this level of quality, and you'd be hard pressed to find one anywhere with the same atmosphere.
2020-12-29,4,Love the concept of this place - it is absolutely beautiful inside and the food is great! Been here a few times and my favs have to be the crab Rangoon nachos, surf and turf fried rice, lettuce wraps, and the dumplings. Deducting a star because I feel that their price to portion ratio is pretty bad, for example the dumplings are $12-$14 for 4 dumplings which feels like a rip off
2020-12-28,4,Decor is lovely, staff is friendly, love that it's byob! The coconut rice was def my fav - excited to see new specials in the future
2020-12-17,5,Great place with great service, but make sure you know it is BYOB.  I definitely recommend getting the crab rangoon nachos and trying one of their desserts!
2020-12-14,5,We absolutely love this place. They have the best menu and the best food. They have a lot of fun things to try as well. For example, general Tso's dumplings and fried chicken bao buns that were so good!!! They also have a great aesthetic which is great for those insta photos!! They're also byob which is nice on the wallet when you can bring your own alcoholic beverages! This is the place to order a bunch of food and share everything to try as much as you can!! Great service and great food!
2020-11-29,3,The place was really cute and ambience was great.  Only thing is a lot of their food is fried.
2020-11-24,5,Even with Covid raging again, this place keeps pushing the boundaries or Asian/American cuisine. The Instagram promoted a new secret Tom Kha soup dumpling and it is delicious. Outside seating had openings due to the weather; soup was definitely the right choice. Very dare to be different kind of menu and look.
2020-11-22,3,The menu looks great and I would of tried almost anything. I only gave 3 stars because we ordered the Mongolian Beef Noodle dish and I would advise against it. It was drowned in sauce, way to much sauce and way to much salt! I drank water all night and still drinking it this morning to work it all out. The beef was tasty though. The lettuce wraps with the pork belly was tasty as well, they give you huge chunks of pork for the wraps. We had to make them smaller to fit the wraps and to have enough for each lettuce wrap they gave. If I used two chucks in one lettuce wrap, I would not have enough for the rest of the wraps. They were out of the eggs rolls, but that does not bother me. The Tacos were so very good and best part of what we eat. They are new so maybe they are working things out. I will try again hoping for better, but definitely has potential with working out the kinks.
2020-11-17,1,My girlfriend and I live in Hoboken and were so excited to try this place. Sadly this was some of the worst Asian fusion food we've ever tried. The ambiance was so confusing. Are you in line at free people or trying to enjoy food at a restaurant? Maybe you're shopping for a bouquet of flowers?? Maybe all of the above. Cant forget the amount of fruit flies that infested the dinning room, due to the fact that half the restaurant is a flower shop. To top it all off, we got very sick. Very very disappointed...
2020-11-17,2,I was excited for a more upscale Chinese food restaurant, but the food was very disappointing. I never would have imagined dan dan noodles with a cream sauce. I'm dairy free and had to throw them away--waste of $20. The kung pao shrimp were soggy with oil.
2020-11-16,1,Completely defiled soup dumplings. The whole point is for the hot soup to be inside the dumpling
2020-11-16,4,I finally visited Touch the Heart this past Saturday; I was able to make a reservation for 3 via Yelp about a week in advance for 7 pm.  It was a pretty blustery night so not every table was taken outside.  They did have a heat lamp nearby but it seems like they didn't have enough gas in it since the flame wasn't very strong (we asked the server to turn it up but she said that was as high as it went...).  Touch the Heart's interior and exterior setup are both very aesthetically pleasing.  It seems like a lot of attention was paid to the ornate details of the table settings, the decor, even the little copper watering can the server used to refill your water glasses.  Our service was very good throughout the entire meal.I came with two friends who dislike spicy food and one who does not eat red meat or avocado, so we were a bit limited to what we could order off the menu to share.  For our first round we shared the General Tso's chicken dumplings (4 in an order) and the Fried Chicken Bao Bun (3 in the order).  Both dishes were very good;  The dumplings had a nice kick to them and were a little crispier.    For our second/main course, we shared the Shrimp Udon and the Surf & Turf fried rice.  The Shrimp Udon was delicious - the shrimps were big and I loved the sweetness to it (more sweet than cayenne).  The Surf & Turf was just okay - too salty for our liking.  We were a little bit disappointed since the restaurant didn't have sticky rice that night nor did they have any dessert available.  It's pretty strange that on a Saturday night they wouldn't have prepared any dessert.  Overall we had a good time and I would go back again to try different items off the menu (spicier ones).  Bonus is that it's BYO.
2020-11-15,4,Went here for dinner and enjoyed it! Definitely a modern/fusion Asian American place but I liked the food. Most notable was their take on soup dumplings- the broth was served in a shot glass! The overall atmosphere and aesthetic is also very instagrammable, complete with a plants lining the walls and also available to purchase.
2020-11-04,2,Didn't love this spot. While they were very accommodating with our large party which was nice (especially with Covid), the food just didn't wow me. Everything looked great on the menu but nothing stood out to me. I wish the food were just more authentic on the Asian side. It feels like we ordered pasta dishes and not Asian noodle dishes. The pork and beef we ordered were also way too fatty and chewy and almost inedible which was disappointing. The only thing I really loved was the fried chicken bao. I believe this place is new so hopefully they continue in the right direction
2020-11-03,5,My boyfriend brought me here Friday oct 23rd for a nice dinner. We didn't make a reservation but they were still able to accommodate us. We sat at the bar inside. It was nice. Romantic ambiance. Great for a date. I love the color scheme and the settings. I love the fresh cut flowers in the restaurant too (it doubles as a florriService was excellent. We ordered a couple mocktails to start. He ordered the Berry Nice (Blueberry Purée, Ginger beer, Clove Syrup, Blueberry Kombucha). I ordered the matcha colada maybe? (pineapple, green tea coconut water, matcha coconut cream, 5 spice, bitters). Both were good but the berry nice was definitely the best.As an appetizer we ordered the Taiwanese popcorn chicken which is fried chicken with basil and chilies with a black vinegar aioli. 15$. This item was overpriced. The batter for the chicken didn't have much flavor but it was crunchy. The sauce was delicious and saved the dish. Wouldn't recommend it though. And we wouldn't get it again. Very small.We ordered the surf and turf fried rice. Marinated steak, ginger, shrimp, seasonal vegetables & scrambled egg tossed in their house soy sauce. This was delicious! Definitely recommend it!! Everything was cooked perfect. Flavors were perfect. Worth it. Good portion and very filling! Yummm.We also tried the special taste of the week of brownie wontons. They were surprisingly amazing!! Not sure if they will stay on the menu but they were so good. Warm, gooey chocolatey center, crunchy fried wonton shell and some fresh whipped cream and strawberries! Omg so yummy! We would get this again lol.
2020-11-03,5,We needed something like this in Hoboken, and I'm so excited it's finally here. Their dishes are so unique and delicious. This is now my go to place for when people visit from out of town. 15/10
2020-11-01,3,I want to start off by saying this place has an adorable set up both outside and inside, I love the flower shop as well, such a great idea. Service was wonderful, we had an excellent waitress and the mocktails were also fun - we brought a bottle of vodka and they mixed it for us. I'm giving it 3 stars because of the food. It really fell flat, there was a group of us and we ordered multiple dishes from each section of the menu. The kimchi dumplings were good, the general tso's chicken dumplings came out raw - the waitress comped the dish for us and made us a new plate. We ordered both the eggplant and beef lo mein and they were incredibly salty. The Asian Mac and cheese was a cool idea and tasted good but the portion size was way too small for the 17 dollar price tag. There was maybe 5 noodles on the dish. We also ordered the crispy green beans, popcorn chicken, the pork belly and chicken bao buns. Everyone really enjoyed the chicken bao's but the rest of the food was either bland or too sweet for most of the group. I had a fun time there but would probably never go back because of the food. Beautiful place though!
2020-10-31,5,The food and the ambience were absolutely amazing! Would recommend this place to anyone!
2020-10-23,4,100% coming back here. The bao buns and entrees were amazing. A place in town we would love to stay open. The surf and turf was the win of tonight dinner. The Dan Dan dish was amazing too!! 100% recommend to anyone looking for a different type of cuisine out in Hoboken!
2020-10-23,5,Finally something different in hoboken! Super cute decor and yummy dumplings! Will be back many more times!
2020-10-22,5,I fell in love with this place! Came here to celebrate our 20th Wedding Anniversary!! Great food, great service,,, fabulous flower arrangement! and it's ByOB!
2020-10-21,1,I want to preface this review by saying the staff was absolutely wonderful and the interior of the place is beautiful. It's the food I want to address. I want to begin by saying this is actually the worst Asian cuisine I have ever had in my entire life. As a matter of fact, the worst restaurant food I've ever had. With this quality of food at this price point, I don't understand how they are still in business. And as for all the great reviews, I don't know where they're coming from because not only are they misleading, my friends and I walked out of this place absolutely angry and appalled.Our group ordered about ten different items from the menu and only three were edible. It is so misleading how appetizing the food looks but once you put it in your mouth it is SO hard to swallow. The Peking duck was basically a thick pot roast duck which I couldn't even chew through and eventually spit out. My chow fun came out looking cold as if it was sitting out for ten minutes but what's crazier is that it was actually hot, it just looked that unappetizing. After powering through a few bites I decided my noodles were inedible. I at least wanted to eat the shrimp and even that was difficult. Mind you I love shrimp and I have never struggled to eat shrimp in my life. I don't know how you can go that wrong with noodles. Not only were my noodles bad, but every single noodle dish we ordered was not eaten beyond a few bites. We also ordered a fried rice and I don't know if the chef accidentally dropped the salt in there, but no normal person seasons their food like that. They might as well have served us rice and salt. We also ordered this coconut rice which tasted like you took food from the refrigerated section at the supermarket and microwaved it. Lastly, my friend and I ordered a mocktail which was so bad we were only able to take a couple sips. We were basically paying $14 for water with a spritz of citrus and a rosemary. I'm not even addressing all of the inedible dishes that were served to us. Not only was the food disgusting, it was ridiculously overpriced. Had I known the food tasted like this, I would very much rather have just gotten Chinese takeout instead. It was my birthday dinner and I was the one to choose this restaurant. Yelp reviews looked great as did the photos. At the end of the night I apologized to all of my friends for bringing them here and offered to go buy them Taco Bell. I was so sorry and embarrassed that they had to come here and spend that kind of money on food which we were barely even able to eat.Philip C also wrote a review which put my group's feelings into words perfectly.
2020-10-20,5,Seriously, what is there to not absolutely love about this new Hoboken GEM of a restaurant??? -creative and delicious Asian fusion menu. Definitely not your typical dim sum spot. -twinkle lights and heat lamps outside. -wall to wall flowers (all available for purchase) insde. -BYOB! I've been dying to try this place ever since I saw a sign that said something like "dim sum & flower shop, coming soon" - two of my favorite things, so I was quickly hooked. I went for dinner this past Saturday night with my friend and we had such a great night eating outside by a heat lamp with a bottle of wine. We got a few dumplings to start and then an entree to share. The menu mentions how tea pairing is a big part of the dim sum experience, but we never ended up getting a pot. It will be a requirement next meal here! We started with the sweet plantain dumplings, peeking duck dumplings, and the deconstructed soup dumplings (which sounds like something an Eagletonian would order for all my Parks & Rec pals out there). All were  really delicious! I loved the filling of the sweet plantain dumplings and everything about the peeking duck dumplings were so tasty. I do wish that they weren't both fried as I usually opt for steamed but still great nonetheless. Have you been wondering about the deconstructed soup dumplings ever since I said "deconstructed soup dumplings"? They come as basically a normal steamed dumpling stuffed with a little crab/pork meat mix and you get a soup shot on the side to sip after each bite. 4 dumplings and 4 little shots. Although I'd still prefer traditional soup dumplings, the broth was so incredibly delicious and I'll get them again next time I come here. Lastly!! We split the spicy pork dan dan as an entree and it was so insanely good. It comes in a thick tahini peanut cream sauce with bok choy (my favorite of all the greens). Anddd it wasn't spicy at all so that was great for me (the biggest baby when it comes to spice). Loved this place, cannot wait come here again and leave with a full stomach and also a new plant/flower arrangement.
2020-10-15,5,I'm so happy this new restaurant is in Hoboken. It's like a fusion Asian tapas place - the plates are meant for sharing and you should definitely go with someone else (or many other people) to sample their many menu offerings. I loved their spin on typical Chinese dishes and flavors and trying to reimagine typical combinations by switching up ingredients. If you're looking for traditional chinese takeout food, you should go elsewhere.I went about 2 weeks ago with a group of girlfriends with our wine bottles in tow. We sat outside under the awning which had lovely lights and set the mood so well. We ordered multiple things off the menu and most everything was a hit. I especially loved the crispy green beans and crispy lotus roots. The spring rolls were delicious and the eggplant lo mein was really good, too. The various bao buns are must tries on. The cucumber salad served as a nice fresh balance to the multiple savory dishes. I wanted to try the bok choy but they had run out!My tummy was comfortably full and my palate was happy, and I didn't feel grossly overstuffed. I'm definitely going back for the bok choy, to try other dumplings and to get repeats of the dishes mentioned above. Can't wait until they offer lunch hours! Sorry - I wish I had taken pictures of the dishes, but they all looked so yummy when they came out that we just dug right into them as soon as they hit the table!
2020-10-11,5,I think I found my new favorite restaurant in hoboken! This place is a beautiful! I got the pork Dan Dan and my friend got the shrimp chow fun and we shared the crab ragoon nachos everything was lovely but I must say the pork Dan Dan stole the show (it's not spicy so you may want to ask for something to make it spicy if you like). We got a mocktail pitcher and some tequila from a near by store and it was so yummy! *Enjoy*
2020-10-08,5,Our favorite place to go! We go almost every week. The sweet potato dumplings are the best!
2020-10-01,5,This spot is perfect for a night out with the girls or as a date night! They have so much to offer in terms of menu and atmosphere! They really pay attention to detail in ways that no other restaurant does! Their menu has something for everyone, including vegan, vegetarian and meat lovers! They have such unique options that you end up wanting to try everything! Crab Rangoon nachos are out of this world!  Their staff goes above and beyond! They have a florist that will make flower arrangements who is so kind and more than willing to make custom arrangements and tell you all about the beautiful plants inside. Did I mention the pots are hand painted!! Support local!  This place is amazing, and so fun.
2020-09-27,4,Sat outside on Friday night - beautiful ambiance and really awesome and attentive servers and wait staff. One item in our order was mixed up and our waitress corrected it, no problem. The best things we had here were the plantain dumplings, the couscous / quinoa fried rice (added 2 eggs). The chicken lo-mein was a tad bit bland, but they brought some chili oils and soy sauce which did the trick. I was a little taken back by the scallion pancakes as there seemed to be more scallions on top rather than inside the pancake - would skip next time. This place is really a nice place to go on a date, meeting up with friends, etc. next time I want to try their dessert too!
2020-09-26,5,Celebrated my anniversary here and they had cute name place holders and flowers set up on the table for us. We ordered the Cheeseburger Dumplings, General Tso Dumplings, Fried Chicken Bao, and Fried Oreo Bao. The food was amazing, service was amazing, and one of the owners took the time to talk to us. A great experience!!
2020-09-26,5,Wow! This place is a new favorite!! I went with my boyfriend and we did a few shared plates and an entree each. We got the sweet potatoe dumplings and OMG. They blew us away. Perfect balance of sweet and a lil spice with crunch. We also got the shrimp and fried chicken bao buns which were delicious. And then I got the lo mein, sooo yum. BYOB so that's always a plus for us but they also make kombucha mock tails which i deffinelty have to try! Prices were super reasonable and the inside is so romantic and cute/fun. The service was also excellent. Love love love.
2020-09-23,5,Amazing food, very friendly staff, and great atmosphere! Such a unique idea for an Asian fusion place in Hoboken! Highly recommend!
2020-09-21,4,Lovely byob spot for  much needed unique cuisine in hoboken.   This isn't your typical dim sum - it's more like culinary dim sum fusion.  There are some dishes that are elevated traditional and others that are just a full on play on dim sum themes.   Overall, a good concept. Went with a group of 4 on a weeknight and we had bottles of wine in tow.  Restaurant readily offered to bring wine glasses as well as the wine buckets to keep the wine at the proper temperature. Menu was accessible with QR code (due to covid, duh!).  Menu consists of small and large plates and, just like regular dim sum, everything is made to share. We ordered a smattering of things: baos, dumplings, crispy beef, green beans, lotus root, noodles, duck.   Everything came out nice and hot.   Some dishes were better than others, and there were two absolute standout dishes for everyone at m y table: the duck large plate (it's a play on peking duck where you make your own pancake roll, but this rendition is a make your own bao situation) and the crispy beef (awesome and delectable little nuggets of yumminess). Next time, I'll def try the cocktails - they're actually cocktails, you just need to bring your spirit of choice. Also, the inside looks so cute and cozy - hope this covid situation gets better so I can enjoy the beautiful space sometime in the future.
2020-09-21,5,This place is awesome. I am always looking for cool new fusion type food and this is it. They are a trendy American-Chinese dim sum restaurant, and let me tell you, they did it right. Everything from the decor of the restaurant to the presentation of the food, it's all just spot on perfect. I would recommend the Kung Pao Chicken or Spicy Pork Dan Dan but honestly, you cannot go wrong with anything. If you are in Hoboken looking for a cool new spot, this place is for you. Highly recommend.
2020-09-19,5,Food quality is excellent! The owners are great and very laid back. Place had a really nice vibe about it. Dishes were very creative. Can't wait to return on another crisp fall night
2020-09-19,2,This place is beyond frustrating. Food is good but not worth the headache. Went for outdoor seating waited over 2 hours. Tried ordering online today at 5 when they open and online ordering is turned off. Wouldn't you want business right now.  Never left a yelp review but this place is beyond unprofessional.
2020-09-19,2,Food is good, did take out once and out door seating once, but customer service is all over the place. Waited over hour and a half after being told only 30 minute wait to be seated where servers couldn't find out to drop off our food. Then we thought we'd give it another try for take out but apparently the kitchen turned off the online ordering because they are too busy at 5 when they open... hostess couldn't confirm if and when they would be doing take out. You would think they would want more business during this time.
2020-09-18,5,This is my favorite place right now! The service is exceptional! The food is amazing! The owner is absolutely gracious and so helpful!
2020-09-17,2,The venue is beautiful. Table settings and decor was cute. Really nice for a romantic date night. But very pricey. I don't think it was worth paying for mediocre food. Rather spend money on real dim sum.
2020-09-16,4,I was very excited to learn about the opening of Touch the Heart, an Asian fusion restaurant that also acted as a plant shop.  It was such a creative concept and innovative addition to the Hoboken restaurant scene.  In fact, their floral parallel business blurred the lines with their decor presentation, as seen in their elegant table-settings that made me feel like I was attending a refined dinner party.The new space had friendly service, but they still had a way to go in terms of the efficiency.  The host and co-owner allowed us to choose our table and quickly took our drink order.  However, when we asked for an extra minute to look at the food items, it took around 15 minutes for him to return to our table.  Once we placed the order, my food arrived in a timely manner, but 10 minutes later, my friend's meal was still not in front of her.  We asked the server about its status and were told that he would check on it.  A few moments later, he confirmed that her meat was just taken off the grill and was resting before being sliced.  Finally, her food was presented shortly after that.  So, yes, the dishes took a while to arrive, but, once they did, they sure were delicious!  My singular Shrimp Bao (sold individually) possessed a perfectly soft and sticky outer bun wrapper and was stuffed with plump grilled shrimp, a spring lettuce mix, zesty pico de gallo, fresh avocado, spicy jalapeños, and aromatic cilantro.  While I really enjoyed this starter, I think it would have benefitted from some sort of condiment or sauce.  For my main dish, I ordered the Eggplant Lo Mein, a substantial portion for its reasonable $14 price point.  The large bowl included pan-fried noodles, seasonal vegetables like asparagus and red pepper, as well as the namesake Chinese eggplant, all served in house-made soy sauce.  In terms of the eggplant, it actually seemed more like traditional eggplant with a darker skin than the purple skinned Chinese variety; in addition, the eggplant was sliced very thick, which likely led to its being undercooked and hard.  Aside from that aspect, I loved the dish!  It possessed the perfect amount of sweet and tangy soy sauce, and I simply could not get enough of it.  My friend had ordered the BBQ Pork, which was served over sticky rice and a slaw of cabbage and carrots, all playfully tucked into a banana leaf. The boneless pork chop had been grilled, lightly covered with the sweet barbecue sauce, and sprinkled with chopped peanuts.  I sampled a bit of the tender pork with its delightful marinade, and I know that she was as pleased with her bites as I was with mine.  When it came to the beverage selection, the restaurant was BYOB, but also had an extensive list of teas and local soft drinks, as well as fun list of mocktails, complete with recommendations on which alcohol would pair best with each one.  I selected the "Just Add Tequila" alcohol-free beverage, which included fresh grapefruit, kombucha, agave, sparkling soda, garnished with a sprig of fresh rosemary.  Despite the name, the restaurant noted that this drink would actually be a terrific mixer for vodka, as well as tequila.  I agreed with that assessment, loving the refreshing notes of citrus, herbs, and flowers.  I also noted that I would need to bring one of the two alcohol varieties with me next time, so that they could make it into a real cocktail.Though Touch the Heart seemed to be working out some kinks in their service, the rest of the space delivered a lighthearted and creative meal that I would recommend experiencing for yourself.
2020-09-15,4,Touch the Heart is a relatively new BYOB eatery that takes a spin on Asian cuisine and also duals as a flower shop.We had ordered the following for takeout:-Myo Pork Belly Lettuce Wraps-Fried Chicken Bao-Fried Red SnapperEverything we ordered was decent and cooked well.  My favorite was probably the fried chicken bao.  The chicken was not dry and the mixture of the pork floss, with pickled veggies, mixed greens was a unique take.  The pork belly lettuce wraps were good, though this was probably messy to eat since the sauce was sogging up everything in the takeout box.  I loved the pineapple chili sauce of the red snapper which the dish can easily be shared among two people.  I think if you're coming here expecting authentic Chinese flavors or dishes of dan dan noodles or scallion pancakes, this isn't the spot (nor at the price point for that).Staff is friendly and the decor of this place is really rustic and cute.  This would make a great date spot!  Overall, I'm glad I tried this spot....I'm not sure if I would go out of my way to come here if I had a craving for Asian Fusion.  However, I would recommend coming here at least once to give it a try.
2020-09-14,1,I feel bad giving this place a 1 star review, but it was truly the worst Asian fusion food I've ever tasted in my life. I honestly don't know where the glowing reviews are coming from.First of all, I blame myself for even trying this place. As an Asian, I feel like I betrayed my heritage by eating this food. I should have known from the menu since no one who knows anything about Asian cuisine would spell it "peeking" or "schezwan." But I wanted to give it a chance because I am a fan of Saku and I know that some white restaurateurs are able to do Asian fusion well. This is not one of those places.We ordered the scallion pancakes, Dan Dan noodles, Peking duck dumplings, fried chicken bao, and crispy green beans. Not a single dish was remotely edible.The scallion pancakes tasted like deep fried pita bread. It was hard as a rock with no flavor. You can get better scallion pancakes in the freezer aisle of an Asian grocery store.The Dan Dan noodles tasted like thick Italian noodles, which is a complete disgrace. The sauce wasn't flavorful and the texture was disturbing. I understand that this place is Asian fusion and dishes are supposed to have an "American" twist, but these noodles were absolutely disgusting, Asian or not.The Peking duck dumplings and fried chicken bao both sounded like great ideas in theory but neither were executed well. The texture of the dumpling skin was like cardboard. The bao part of the fried chicken bao tasted as it should I supposed but the chicken was soggy and not crispy. The green beans were also soggy and greasy, not crispy. Of all the dishes, it was the most edible.I know Hoboken isn't known for its Asian cuisine, but since the pandemic started, I haven't been going into NY as much. It's a huge shame that this is an addition to Hoboken's "Asian" food. If you are Asian or know anything about Asian food, steer clear of this place. The only positive is that my white partner thought the food was just as inedible as I did, which means I at least taught him a thing or two about what Asian/Asian fusion food should taste like.
2020-09-12,1,Businesses that charge you for things you don't get is a sad way to earn a living. This is a review re-write after the owner contacted me, I gave him the benefit of the doubt based on our conversation and he proceeded to not do a single thing he said.We ordered $80 worth of food online, and our order was accepted but never delivered. We called their phone number, nothing. We called their payment processor (Toast, kinda like Seamless) and they refused to do anything. Left a bad review.The owner calls me the next day, and apologies profusely. Says he just refunded the order and he's sending us a gift card in the mail for our trouble - also asks me to take down the 1-star review. I obviously say yes and take the review down - all I wanted was my money back.Now, it's a week later and nothing. The charge is still up. At $80 this is expensive social justice - but probably more expensive for him.
2020-09-12,1,The review is not about the food. I would have loved to try it but the food never actually came. We ordered through their website for delivery and after 1.5 hours still no food. We called the restaurants numerous times and turns out they were closed. However our credit card was still charged. We spoke to the owner the next day and said they would refund us......a week later...... still no refund.
2020-09-11,5,This spot had great dumplings and bao! Our main noodle dish did not live up to the expectations set by the apps but it was still good - that just goes to show how much better the apps were before hand!
2020-09-09,4,Let me start off by saying Daniel was the absolute sweetest! He along with his staff made sure my group and I were attended to and really made the experience memorable for us. I had a celebration dinner for graduating with my Master's and had such a great time! The only thing I think they could work on is some of the food. Their spicy cucumber salad was way too spicy (& trust me, I can handle my spice) & the noodles in the pad Thai were a little too hard. The dumplings, however, were perfect. I would definitely go back and give them another chance!
2020-09-07,3,Really cool vibe but I wasn't impressed with the value for quality here. It's a great place to bring a first date maybe but I won't be going back anytime too soon. Service was very good. Food was extremely mediocre.
2020-09-06,1,Ordered for delivery tonight and it never came. I called the restaurant 14 times with no answer, but online the restaurant says they are open. Unfortunately I likely will not be a returning customer.
2020-09-04,5,Truly touching hearts with their fusion food and innovative drinks (virgin). Its a  BYOB place
2020-09-04,4,Spontaneously ended up at this restaurant while in Hoboken because of all the great reviews. Honestly, I would give it a 3.5 if I could because of the food. I went at the time when only outdoor dining was allowed, but when I saw the inside of the restaurant, it was super cute and cozy looking. A very Instagrammable place! And, I heard that you could buy flowers from the restaurant. How cute!Staff was super nice and sweet. Even though we didn't have reservations, they didn't make us feel bad about not having one and seated us pretty quickly. The food. -It started off great with the ginger scallion shrimp chow mein, which was very clean and healthy tasting, but full of flavor. -Next, we had the kung pao chicken tempura, which was very delicious, but a bit heavy on the salt, so we had to order some rice to eat with it. -Then, we had the pork and crab soup dumpling. This is not your typical soup dumpling. The soup is in a shot glass next to the actual dumplings. The concept is a novelty, but we didn't enjoy it. The dumpling on its own was bland. And, the soup was too herbal for me.-Lastly, we had the crispy beef (I thought it was called shaking beef, but I must've heard wrong). It was tooooooooooo salty. We couldn't finish it.I saw the owner or manager walking around and was going to tell him what I thought about the food if he came around, but he must've had a sixth sense because he went to every table asking how their dinner was except ours. Would I come back again? Maybe if someone else really wanted to go, but not by my choice.Bathroom Tip: Memory was a bit hazy, but there were 2 bathrooms, both unisex, at the back of the restaurant, past the bar.
2020-09-03,5,Amazing spot!! So happy we stumbled by.  Everything was delicious and I will definitely be back to try more things on the menu.We ordered the cheeseburger dumplings, lettuce wraps and the spicy pork noodles.BYOB! And everything is served dim sum and is made for sharing.  They also sell bouquets of fresh flowers which adds to the already beautiful ambiance.
2020-08-31,4,Honestly, this place was good but not worth the hype that the locals give it. I'd do 3.5 stars if I could.We started off with cucumber salad. The flavors were great but you had this horrible burn from the chili's after eating it. 3/4 of us were crying and it made eating it almost unbearable. The waitress did warn us that it was spicy but HOLY COW. Next we tried a bunch of dumplings. All were good in terms of the flavors. My friends said the crab Rangoon nachos were too fishy tasting but i found them super pleasant and enjoyed the real crab instead of imitation meat. The absolute star of the show was the fried general tsos chicken dumplings. Best thing we ate.The crab and coconut rice left something to be desired. It tasted very earthy and that was about it. Coconut whomst? Lo mein with chicken was def a hit amongst us but why so little noodles? If i ordered noodles give me the noodles. Don't need no veggies. Finally, the king pao  chicken. WOAH! So good.Overall, staff was nice, decor was nice and unique. Someone was arranging flowers the whole night which was fun to watch. I'd say it's a place to go just to try it out but there wasn't enough dishes that wowed me.
2020-08-29,5,Great new spot in town! All the details from the steam ware to the ambiance are perfect! BYOB with creative mocktail options. Food was perfectly presented and lovely. Great spot for an occasion or just a girls night out!
2020-08-23,4,The food was outstanding! The service was friendly, attentive and incredible. Really cannot get over how delicious our food one. The waiter noticed that we didn't eat the cucumber salad as it was way to spicy, so they took it back and comped is for it. The only unfortunate part was that we went on a Sunday and there was a limited selection of flowers available to buy. Of course the flowers we wanted, weren't being sold. Apparently their stock comes in on Tuesdays so this is good to know for the future. However, if you want a delicious meal you will not be disappointed!
2020-08-18,5,Just came from Touch The Heart. Had the Spicy Cucumber salad ( very spicy but delish), Sesame Lo Mein, Surf and Turf Dumplings and General Tsao's Dumplings. Everything was so delicious!!  My husband  and I shared everything and it was the perfect amount. Service was great... didn't have to wait for anything.  Will definitely be going back and I purchased a beautiful plant to bring home:). Florist does a wonderful job too!
2020-08-17,5,Awesome service, awesome food. No where else in Hoboken with Asian fusion food that's this good.
2020-08-15,1,I hate giving restaurants one star but we didn't have a great experience. We walked in around 8 PM and waited about 15 minutes to get ice water. Around 8:45 we received our first appetizer. They then brought the main courses and forgot 2 of our appetizers so I requested that they were taken off the bill."Vegetarian" Dan Dan noodles with tofu: I am a huge fan of Dan Dan (Hao Noodles and Han Dynasty) are my favorite. This taste like watered down fettuccini Alfredo. Not an authentic taste at all. Returned.Tofu Bao: $4 per bao: Arrived cold and soggy. They used the same tofu as the Dan dan noodles which had no flavor. Returned. Fried rice: This actually tasted good. I am extremely picky with fried rice but it was balanced and I ate the whole plate. Plantain dumpling and Arugula mushroom dumpling: Both dumplings were ok. The plantain dumpling was fried so it did lose some of the flavor of the plantain. Overall, most people around us were upset with how slow the service was. The couple next to us asked for the appetizer to be packed but then ended up opening the to go box since their entrees took absolutely forever.
2020-08-13,5,So happy this place has opened in Hoboken.A unique menu with interest takes on classic asian dishes.Fried chicken bao, Crispy Fried Beef, General Tso Chicken Dumpling, and Sesame Chicken Lo Mein were all great!
2020-08-11,3,The restaurant is trendy, service is okay but food is mediocre. I did enjoy the crab rangoon nachos (a must) and the General Tso dumplings.I absolutely love scallion pancakes, so I was super excited to try them here. Unfortunately, I can make better scallion pancakes at home. The pork buns were stuck to the bottom of the dish and not flavorful.I would give this restaurant another try to taste some other dishes.
2020-08-08,5,Awesome food, great service, and chic aesthetic. It has it all! So glad they opened up.
2020-08-07,4,Great ambience, great service and delicious menu options! We brought champagne and red wine which they were able to chill for us. The owner came to our table and explained the concept and menu extensively, which we appreciated for our first Americanized dim sum experience. I ordered some of the vegan options, including the fried tofu (which is insanely spicy!) and the green beans which were out of this world!
2020-08-05,5,Service was so great and kind that they touched my heart. I wasn't a fan of the shrimp egg rolls but the waiter (who felt like the owner??) was kind enough to take it off the bill. Loved all my other dishes and would recommend. Not the most "authentic" but still super good!
2020-08-02,3,What we ordered for 3 people: Lettuce wraps Scallion pancakes Mushroom arugula dumplings Peeking duck dumplings Coconut crab rice 3 fried chicken bao Conclusion. Loved the lettuce wraps. Avoid scallion pancakes at all cost. Both Dumplings were average. Bao was sloppy and didn't have a lot of meat. Crab coconut rice was yummy
2020-07-30,5,The food was incredible - got the soup dumplings (so fun!) and coconut crab rice. I highly recommend both. Almost more impressive: service was on point! It's BYO and bc of COVID, only outdoor dining was available. It was about 86 degrees out at around 7pm last night and they asked if we wanted our beers in the fridge... I'm. In. Love.
2020-07-28,5,Adorable decor, awesome food, and outstanding service! We tried the crispy fried beef, crab rangoon nachos, cheeseburger dumplings, general Tso's chicken dumplings, Peking duck dumplings, pork and crab soup dumplings, fried chicken baos, and crab and coconut fried rice. Not a single bad dish is pretty impressive in this town!! Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu.
2020-07-26,5,I brought my family (parents, sister, and boyfriend) to Touch the Heart for my 32nd birthday dinner, and admittedly, was a little nervous beforehand, as my parents are pretty unadventurous and old school when it comes to food. To my delight, they not only LOVED the meal, but can't wait to dine here again.Our waiter was friendly, informative, and helped us decide what and how many plates to order. The Kung pao chicken, beef and broccoli, crab nachos, and general tso's dumplings were the highlights, but you really can't go wrong. Every dish was unique and delicious. Don't sleep on the cheeseburger dumplings either!! We brought beer (the restaurant kept it cold), and vodka for a cocktail, which was made up by the bartender, and was very refreshing on a hot summer night. All around, the dining experience (especially during COVID) was 10/10 - ambiance, service, and food. And icing on the cake? this restaurant doubles as a flower shop. I took home a very chic bouquet and my sister got a potted plant. Highly recommend Touch the Heart for a date night or family outing!
2020-07-25,5,Tried 10 different items with friends and every dish that came out was better than the last. Absolute must try in the middle of Hoboken
2020-07-25,5,The decor and ambience here is amazing! Love the flower/ florist concept and it's very chic. I ordered the Dan Dan noodles, scallion pancakes and split the soup dumplings with a friend and just wow. Super packed with flavor and absolutely delicious. I could eat the Dan Dan noodles every day . I really can't wait to dine inside and get the full experience of the restaurant and I'm so excited to have this spot here in hoboken now !!P.s you have to try a mocktail they're so yummy
2020-07-25,5,I can't say enough good things about this place! I have been living in Hoboken for 5 years and this may have been one of the best meals I've had...Especially during these times, it's hard to find a place with such amazing food, service and ambiance! Every single dish we ordered was delicious and fresh.
2020-07-25,5,Eat at this restaurant for the first time last night and it did not disappoint! Probably one of the most unique and delicious meals I have had in Hoboken to date and I have lived here for 3 years! Perfect place for any occasion! The aesthetic was perfect even down to the place setting! The owner came over and could not have been friendlier!
2020-07-24,5,One of my new favorites in Hoboken. From the food, to the drinks, to the service, everything was perfect
2020-07-24,5,This has been one of the best dining experiences I've had in Hoboken.  The food was spectacular...everything came out hot, so quickly, and incredibly delicious.  The atmosphere is gorgeous and incredibly Instagramable.  Nick and the team did such a great job with both the food and service, we can't wait to come back soon. A MUST visit if you're in Hoboken!
2020-07-24,1,What a disappointment. Scallion pancake didnt taste like scallion and was deep fried to the point it was a cracker. Soup dumplings with soup on the side? Sounds like wonton soup to me not soup dumplings. Dan dan noodles are supposed to have an almost oily sauce, the dan dan here had the texture of noodle kugel with the amount of tahini shoved into it. Really wanted to like this place. Biggest problem i had was wanting to seek a refund given we had to throw out almost $40 worth of our &95 order. No way to contact the restaurant though, and $95 for 7 dimsum dishes is beyond ridiculous especially if it tastes so bad.
2020-07-24,2,I think all of the other reviewers are either employees of the place or had their meals comped. This food really is not good. It was so disappointing because I was really excited to try it. The scallion pancakes were basically hard oily wonton crackers (not scallion pancakes), the dumplings were just meh, and the only main dish we ordered was basically inedible. The Dan dan noodles had a sauce so thick, it was basically the consistency of peanut butter (but did not taste good). The pork didn't taste good either and neither of us wanted to eat it after trying it. It was very disappointing and now both of us are considering ordering a pizza because we don't want to eat this very expensive and poorly made meal.
2020-07-22,5,There is no other restaurant like this one in Hoboken! Small dumpling plates and flowers and bouquets make this the perfect date night spot. The Crab Rangoon Nachos are INCREDIBLE, we ordered 3 orders and ate every bite. Can't wait to come back!
2020-07-22,5,Great new BYOB spot in town! I dined here on Tuesday evening. Appetizer sizes are HUGE- I got the cucumber salad (very very spicy), the green beans, and the spring roll (this is huge- the size of a burritto). BYOB is great- the waitress was attentive to our glasses and even chilled our next bottle in the fridge. The owner came over to do table touches and told us about the plants, very nice touch. Went inside to purchase a succulant, hand painted by @lightpinklace - she also does the interior design for some other restaurants in town. Only downside: the dishes come to your table as they come out, so we were almost done with all of our food and then we finally got our bao buns and dumplings that we forgot we ordered! I will most certainly be back.
2020-07-21,5,Awesome new restaurant on Washington with delicious American style dim sum. The ambiance is incredible - decorated to perfection. Cucumber salad, general tso dumplings, and noodles were all fantastic. BYOB with the most delicious mocktails! One of a kind concept in Hoboken. Will definitely be back!!
2020-07-18,5,AMAZING! Everything down to the silverware is just perfect. My husband and I went on a date night here and had the perfect experience. The food is to die for. The atmosphere is romantic and modern. We even left with a personalized flower bouquet that I still have in my living room. You can really see the love and detail put into making this new hotspot. It defiantly touched our hearts and we can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu.
2020-07-17,5,It was my first time here and definitely won't be my last! The food and drinks, the Matcha colada especially, were amazing and the owner was so kind and informative which made our time even more pleasant. I highly recommend anyone to stop here because the food and service you will receive is absolutely worth it and you won't be disappointed :)
2020-07-16,5,Excellent service and food! Gorgeous flowers! We cannot wait to go back :) love the idea of small plates and portion sizes were perfect for sharing.
2020-07-15,5,Great atmosphere. Great food. Great service. Trendy unique and cozy restaurant. Went with a group of 6 and was able to try a lot of the different dishes. Everything was so delicious. I am a dumpling and noodle fanatic and the unique take on the soup dumplings and the sesame lo mein were my favorite. The servers treated us like we were their best friends and we had so much fun. Really impressed with all of the businesses the owner has in town!
2020-07-14,5,What a cool new byob spot in town! We had the chance to come here the other night when it opened since there was a lot of buzz about it. They are right on Washington and a welcome addition to the street. The cuisine is american dim sum which I found to be pretty good.  They also serve mocktails that you can mix with alcohol you bring.  The byob option is awesome and you don't see a lot of those anymore. I came with a group of four and we each ordered 2-3 small plates since that is the how the concept of dim sum works. We started with the szechuan green beans, the kung pao chicken, cucumber salad, scallion pancakes, and summer rolls.  Everything was spot. The green beans were addicting to eat. The kung pao chicken is a must order but make sure to get the sticky rice with it. We then tried a few different dumplings and bao. The cheeseburger dumplings were surprisingly light and a unique play on dumplings. The sweet plaintain dumpling may have been my favorite.  Another must order is the fried chicken bao. Ridiculous. At this point I was stuffed and still tried the crab rangoons so I could get the full experience.  The restaurant also doubles as a florist shop which one of the servers explained. You will be able to pick up flowers or different bouquets if need be. The concept inside looks really cool so can't wait to dine inside too. I would highly recommend coming to check it out.
2020-07-12,5,AWESOME new restaurant in Hoboken. Went last night with my family and everyone could not stop raving about the food the whole night. Each dish that came out was to die for.  Just when we thought we had the best dish of the night we were proved wrong when the waiter bought out the next. Restaurant is a BYOB with a delicious mock-tail menu so you just need to bring your favorite liquor! The atmosphere is absolutely beautiful and the staff is exceptional. This is a must try for all - you will not be let down, trust me! Will be going back again real soon!
