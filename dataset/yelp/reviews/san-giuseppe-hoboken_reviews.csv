2021-10-31,5,Just moved from NYC, and I've been searching for good Italian food outside of some places in Little Italy. Found it in San Giuseppe's. Eat-in dining is very comfortable and friendly and 'upscaled' by tablecloths and settings (for dinner). Tried takeout as well - and the Vegetarian Pizza is to die for!!!Generous portions - be prepared to take home a doggie bag!Highly recommend this for couples or families. (BYOB).
2021-10-08,5,Visiting the area and this came up on GrubHub. Meatballs were excellent, as was the sauce. We also got a Margherita pizza and it was quite tasty as well. Could have used a little more basil, but I'm nitpicking. The crust was very nicely done, and was a great combo of crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The delivery was made by bike rather than car, which is definitely new to me (I'm from the suburbs). On the one hand I'm glad it was more environmentally friendly, on the other it certainly added a few minutes to the delivery. Again, I'm nitpicking. I would definitely order from them again.
2021-10-03,5,FINALLY! Found a great Italian spot in Hoboken! Absolutely delicious Italian food, tasty with authentic Italian flavors. We've ordered now about 5 times the past month and that's a lot for us city folks. Recently We ordered the large pasta primavera, fettuccine Alfredo, arrabiata pasta, calamari, eggplant rollatini, and for dessert the rainbow cake. Let's start with the salad. Pretty fresh, tasty Caesar salad with fresh in-house made sauce. The sauce was perfect. Not too lemony and just the right amount of tartness. The pasta oh the pasta was Absolutely delicious pasta dishes. Not too heavy in the sauce while still creamy and flavorful. The arrabiata pasta has a nice spicy kick, the Alfredo sauce is creamy, bursts of flavor while staying light and authentic. The primavera, although not always appreciated was super fresh, tasty and complimented the rest of the dishes. The eggplant rollatini was creamy and delicious. The ricotta cheese combined with the sauce was the perfect match. Last but not least, the rainbow cake. The cake was so good we all fought for the last bite, the only bad choice we made was order one slice of cake! We loved every bite here. Can't get enough of this place and come to think of it- I think I just made a family decision of ordering dinner tonight from Here  (I'll order an extra slice of cake and hide it just to snack on later ). Don't hesitate to go here, support this local place trust me when I say you will not Regret it - we'll only if you share you might
2021-09-12,5,I just had the most amazing baby shower! From start to finish everything was amazing. The staff made sure everything ran so smooth and they paid attention to every last detail! The food was incredible and there was so much of it. My guests loved the food so much they were ordering food to take home to their spouses. I can't say enough good things ! Best Italian restaurant in Hoboken!! Thank you for everything can't wait to go back for dinner
2021-09-01,5,I don't usually post reviews but the pizza here is amazing. I always order the salad pizza and just ordered the shrimp scampi pizza. It is amazing and they are quick to deliver and always call with any questions or changes to the order. Great place!
2021-08-25,5,A little hidden gem where the portions are generous. My friends and I were able to get outdoor dining on a Wednesday night and were welcomed by incredibly friendly staff. For appetizers, we ordered the crostini and the burrata. The burrata was incredibly fluffy and so decadent, great with the free bread. The crostini was packed with so much flavor, between the balsamic dressing and prosciutto,  and was a pleasant start to the meal.The calzone was huge. Incredibly huge. I ended up splitting it with a friend since there was no chance I could finish this larger-than-a-football-sized meal by myself. We got the funghi calzone, which came with a side of tomato sauce and was generously stuffed with mozzarella, ricotta, and mushrooms. Incredibly delicious and I would highly recommend to any mushroom lover.Lastly, the cannoli. It came with a drizzle of berry(?) sauce and did not skimp on the filling. It wasn't too sweet and surprisingly light. At this point, my stomach was so full from the calzone, but it made a very special spot for the cannoli.Overall, I'd highly recommend this place for anyone looking for some nice, cozy Italian cuisine. Guarantee you'll leave feeling full.
2021-08-07,5,I only tried the wings from this restaurant and they were amazing ! I'm very picky when it comes to wings but this place does not disappoint! It is a hidden Gem. I highly recommend them. I can't wait to try their other dishes  they get 10 stars
2021-07-13,5,My wife and I hosted our sons baptism reception this past weekend and it was nothing short of perfect. The owner, JG, was very attentive to my wife's needs for the event and always made himself  available to answer any questions that we had. Our party took up the entire restaurant and the team at San Guiseppe took it in stride. Everyone that assisted us throughout  the event was helpful, attentive and friendly. All of the food was really well made with care and there was something for everyone to enjoy from the pre-fixed menu items we selected which included the garlic knot sliders, eggplant rollitini along with sole and veal soltimbuca to name a few. Everyone enjoyed their meals immensely and we could not have been happier. A warm thank you to the entire San Guiseppe team!
2021-06-12,5,This place is truly a hidden gem in Hoboken.  We finally tried it last night because of their outdoor dining option and were pleasantly surprised by the delicious food, attentive service and friendly owner.  We shared a few appetizers based on other Yelp reviews and we can confirm the wings are excellent but would suggest ordering them well done to compliment the caramelized onions.   The stuffed clams were on point and the rice balls which can often be bland were great.  When ordering for our toddler with food allergies our waitress Ciara was very thoughtful with her recommendations and even double checked with the kitchen to verify that the oil used for fries is olive.  We of course assumed she was mistaken but she was absolutely right!  We later learned when Giuseppe himself personally came to our table to check on our dining experience that his niece also has a peanut allergies so he's very conscientious about not using it.  We ordered a personal size margarita pizza to share and it was delicious.   Next time we want to try the vodka pie because the vodka sauce in one of our entrees was SO good. Although a little off the beaten path on the north end of town under the viaduct there is plenty of parking and it's BYOB.
2021-05-25,5,Always know what you're getting here = really good pizza and elevated flavors! I got the Calabresa pizza and added fresh ricotta because WHY not, was sooo good. Garlic knots are huge, fluffy and the marinara is on point. Haven't had a bad meal here. Pro tip - get their wings and let your life be changed. Not pictured here (will do a separate review for those bad boys), but trust they'll be in your top 5 after. SauteÃÅed onions and tons of umami and the wings are fall apart tender. Get on over here already!
2021-03-22,4,Dined inside at SG for the first time this weekend.  They take reservations on resy.com but it seemed pretty slow there for a Saturday night.  I'm not sure if this was related to the fact that they had an electrical issue the day before,  but they weren't serving calzones or garlic knots on Saturday and they didn't give us much bread.  That was a bummer since we wanted to try the garlic knot special I've seen on IG with sauce, cheese and pepperoni.  To start, we got the mozz sticks and eggplant rollatini.  The sauce on the eggplant was really good.  The mozz sticks weren't hot so we had to send them back to be reheated.  For mains, we each got the same special - the chicken cutlet with vodka sauce & burrata on top. Was very good and a big portion.  Unfortunately, our waiter mixed up our leftovers when he boxed them up and gave us each other's meals.  They should let people box their own food for this reason.  Lastly for dessert, we shared a cannoli which was tasty - they put a candle in it since it was my friends birthday.  Overall, it was a pleasant meal and the service was good despite the leftover mixup.
2021-02-21,2,Ok, so I am slowly transition to veganism, and the last couple of items I'm weaning out of my diet are cheese and fish. I think Mr. Giuseppe just just helped me nix the latter. WHAT was the gray line going down the center of my filet? Idk man, idk. I also asked for it well done/crispy and it was so... not. We got a margarita pizza to share as an app which was a smart decision and this pizza definitely wasn't bad. I rate it a 6.9. The sauce was a little sweet and it was a bit oily, but of course I always appreciate the crispiness of a wood oven pie. The focaccia bread was... fine. I do like the rosemary infused olive oil but then again anyone can infuse olive oil with rosemary. I just wish they put fewer olives on my salad and infused their salmon with a little less pesticide. Future Husband enjoyed his pork special over risotto. I tried the risotto and it tasted Spanish-like to me. He said he liked it but to me it tasted like the base of a paella. Just saying, if you're trying to make the choice between this BYOB and any other one in Hoboken, I would just the other one. I've still yet to receive a piece of fish with a gray line down the center at any other restaurant. Also, I get what it is for the record - a shitty cut of salmon. But then when you see that, don't serve it. Unless the vegan gods were paying you to tempt me over to the light side. Then they did a good job. But the restaurant is still 2 stars. Also, tables were not 6 feet away during Covid which automatically deducts one star.
2021-01-29,4,Got the meat lovers tonight. Pizza was good- arrived cold so needed to be heated up- probably the door dashers fault but will definitely order from here again.
2021-01-28,4,This was my first time getting food from here and got the margherita pizza adding anchovies, olives and pepperoni. Small was decent size big enough for 2.  Toppings are same price for small and large so small is pricey if do many toppings.  Caesar salad does not naturally come with anchovy as have to pay extra.   Crostini with Balsamic was okay but not hard with prosciutto.  Overall decent choice for an above average pizza place.
2021-01-16,5,Light and flavorful pizza. Ingredients are fresh and premium. Off the path but what a find for those who do.. Their wings. *Chefs kiss*
2020-11-30,5,We have been eating here for years and have hosted several events here. The food is always fresh and delicious! You will not be disappointed. I especially like to support family run businesses such as this one.  You always get wonderful personalized service!
2020-11-29,4,Fast delivery and food was still piping hot. Veal marsala was delicious. Marinara sticks are long and seasoned well. Chicken cutlet sandwich was so good. Will definitely be ordering again.
2020-11-19,5,My review is for a delivery.. which as you know can be hit or miss... but San Giuseppe is super consistent. Their menu offers food that's safe for me to eat (I have celiac disease) and it's so super yummy. I highly recommend the vodka sauce pizza! If I could I would eat it every day!
2020-10-29,5,I have hosted 2 events and countless dinners from here.  Everything is always amazing, well planned, and nothing is rushed nor does it take forever.  The fettucine alfredo is amazing and the mozzarella sticks are a MUST.
2020-10-17,5,The service is great, very attentive and fast!  The food was even better, I had the Eggplant Parm and a Burrata with Prosciutto that was out of the world.  They don't have a liquor license so you need to bring your own booze or order from a shop down the street that will deliver to your table.  I loved this place.
2020-10-10,5,The food and service is so amazing.  I had a shrimp parm sandwich and my husband veal parm. We split both and a cannoli for dessert. Every bite was better then the last. This is a new favorite in Hoboken.
2020-10-01,5,First time going here and I'm already counting back the days till I can go here again! I was part of a large party of 7, and we were seated indoors. Our server was extremely attentive and well informed, she came back several times after she put in our order to inform us of any changes. The bread was more of a crispy focaccia cracker that was seasoned with garlic, rosemary, salt, and olive oil and I could not stop eating it. I  got the special ravioli in a pink sauce and it was excellent! The fried ravioli was the perfect combination of crunchy outside with a cheesy inside, the garlic bread was sooo buttery and tasty! For dessert I got the tiramisu which was also extremely good, and my friend got the pound cake and loved it. All the members of my party enjoyed their food and agreed that they would love to come back again!
2020-09-27,5,I have my bff to thank for this one. As a regular who lives around the corner from SG, she knew exactly what to order to make my belly happy. And that started with the pollo al forno - aka the most perfect wings smothered in caramelized onions. And I mean SMOTHERED. These juicy, tender wings are a big hit and for a very good reason. Definitely don't pass these up!We also ordered the insalata di campania, which encompassed all of my favorite flavors and textures in a  salad - creamy gorgonzola, walnuts, and apples on top of arugula - the perfect blend of nutty, sweet, and savory flavors. So friggin' good. The veal in my vitello marsala was thin and tender, served with an authentic tasting marsala sauce that was creamy and rich in flavor. Impressive San Giuseppe, impressive. Honestly, I didn't think they'd nail it with the dessert too, but damn, they proved me wrong. The cannolis are made in house and the one I devoured had a super crispy shell stuffed with creamy cannoli cream that was neither grainy nor too dense. I love me a perfect cannoli. The well deserved 5 stars isn't just for the food. Service was superb and the owner made his rounds greeting every customer, which is always a nice touch. Prices are super reasonable, they're BYOB with no corkage fee, and they even have parking, which is a hard find in Hoboken. What more can you ask for?
2020-09-12,5,Ok so I'm pretty impressed.  First calzone is like the size of a pizza folded in half.  Lots of cheese, could use a little more meat but the sauce is incredible.  All of my picky requests were met 100%.  I wanted the cannoli deconstructed so the shell didn't get soggy and 2 days later I was so happy I did that - the cannoli was my breakfast and yeah excellent.  Delivery was exactly as I requested as well - drop off in my vestibule.  I can tell you that even though there are plenty of places in Hoboken - this is going to be my go to from now on.
2020-08-23,5,I love this spot! Such a great, hidden gem.  I highly recommend it! Great food, consistently. Great service and friendlyyy owner. Wait staff is so pleasant. It's off the beaten path, under the hoboken (14th street bridge) but it's near Carpe Diem so not desolate. It is on such a quiet street that it gives you peace coming here. Parking lot available!  If you don't like dining amongst the foot traffic of people on 14th or Washington Avenue, this place is it.
2020-08-14,5,SLAMING!!!!  Been living on this side of the Hudson for a couple years now.  Have tried a million places.  This place is by far the best place. I only get the chicken cutlet and my wife gets the margarita pizza.   It ridiculous.  I've only talked on the phone for delivery but they are extremely friendly. I live in the next town and there delivery doesn't even make sense. They come super fast. Anyway.  If your looking for a place.  This is the only place we order from now.
2020-06-03,5,Hands down best pizza in Hoboken/Hudson county, and easily one of the best restaurants in the county period! By far the most underrated.I've been goin to these guys for years. They don't miss. My personal fave is the San Giuseppe Pizza.. Prosciutto di Parma, arugula, fresh mozz, and shaved Parmesan. Saporiteee!! Sometimes I'll even add fresh figs or dates to it when I get home to get that salty sweet savory combo. Im also obsessed with their wings (pollo al forno)- seasoning is perfect and they top the wings off with carmelized onions. Last week my girlfriend ordered the penne vodka pizza. Honestly didn't think I was gonna be a fan, but I shoulda known better. They don't miss. Oh, and if u want dessert, just ask Joe or Mario for one of their famous cannoli's, you'll thank me later (I dunno if the cannolis are actually famous, but they should be). Best cannoli I ever had.We ALL should be supporting our local businesses during these crazy covid-19 times. And if you are reading this review and live in Hoboken/JC/UC/WNY anywhere in Hudson county, go check this place out.. you'll be helping a local family-owned business, and maybe just as important, you will be helping YOURSELF out. Again, thank me later.. but you're welcome.
2020-05-09,5,One of my favorite spots in Hoboken. Ordered a vodka pizza and chicken parm and it arrived very quickly and was delicious as always! So happy they reopened during quarantine
2020-05-07,5,I really just love this place. I was super excited to see they recently reopened after closing for a bit during Covid. Anything I ever order is always out of this world and you can always rely on their delivery (an area I feel most restaurants in this area lack). They also have a good delivery radius (I moved from Hoboken to Paulus Hook and they reach me)! Once we can stop social distancing I also recommend them for parties. Joe hosted a birthday for me a few years ago and worked so patiently with my family to ensure everything was just as we envisioned. There was so much food and everyone had such a great time. Thanks for keeping me well fed and keep up the good work you guys!! Hope to see you in person soon.
2020-02-22,5,Had a lunch at San Giuseppe to celebrate our daughter's Baptism. Pizza and salad appetizer was delicious and everyone loved their entrees, which all came out together and hot. Italian cookies and their delicious coffee rounded out the meal.Giuseppe was very easy to work with and accommodating with menu, etc. Pricing and payment were straightforward and easy, no haggle no hassle.There's plenty of parking in the lot out front, which was perfect for our out of town family.And they're BYOB!All in all a great experience, will definitely be back for dinner and would certainly do another event here.
2020-02-16,2,Overall, this place is nothing more than average. To start, the ambiance here is just not it. Ugly yellowish colored walls with no decorations, tables way too close to each other, no candle or anything on the tables. No bread to start off the meal, as well. I enjoyed my rigatoni bolognese and the salad we ordered, but the burrata and prosciutto appetizer came with 3 little pieces of prosciutto and had way too much olive oil drenched on it. The vodka sauce pasta was soooo average, ive had better sauce from a Jar. With so much amazing competition in Hoboken, not sure how this place survives.
2020-01-31,5,The owner is amazing! He makes sure everyone is happy- you can tell how much he truly cares about his customers.
2020-01-24,5,The 40min drive from my house to Hoboken was well worth it! This place has great food & nice ambiance. Food was amazing. Pizza was delicious had that as a starter  & chicken parm as an entreÃÅe. Highly recommend a bottle of the homemade olive oil to dip bread or as a dressing. I was too full for dessert but I did have the espresso & it was perfect. Great service, parkIng lot & all around a good time. I'll definitely be back here with friends.
2020-01-24,5,Had my babyshower here October 2019 & it was beautiful! The staff was friendly & food was really good. The room is the perfect size for an intimate party. Set up was easy & stress free thanks to the staff.  Getting the attention of a waiter for any reason was a breeze & they were always happy to help. Private parking lot  was a plus!  I really enjoyed my time here & cannot wait to go back for a regular night.  Highly recommend this place for a private event or just whenever in Hoboken. The food is really good!
2020-01-21,3,Got delivery on a L sauce and cheese pizza and expected to get an awesome pie but instead got a Burnt and not that great pizza.  boo!The pizza was alright itself, but the fact that some of the crust was burnt turned us off.  Of course like other pizza's in NJ, the dough here is good.  Maybe we caught them on an off day?  I know other's have really enjoyed their pie.
2020-01-04,3,Average Italian and some real hit or miss dishes. The margarita pizza and spaghetti and meatballs were good. Chicken franchaise was gross. The worst was that after an hour, we were basically thrown out to give room for other diners. While we were eating our app, dinners came out. The whole thing was rushed. Would not recommend, much better Hoboken options.
2019-12-22,5,Great good and great service. I've eaten here and ordered take outs and food is great. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs. Meatballs were nice and tender. Margarita pizza was saucy. Great spot.
2019-12-16,3,I do not have the best experience here, I wrote on the reservation to please sing happy birthday to my girlfriend  as well as in person and they did not do so. On top of of that they weren't attentive to our table like the others . Note to self just because you have younger customers at a establishment as so doesn't mean we don't deserve the same quality of service like anyone else .
2019-12-04,4,I really think this is one of the best margarita pizzas I've ever had. The pizzas here is seriously always on point. The sauce is so flavorful, I love it. The meatballs are also really good, better than a lot of others in Hoboken. The Tiramisu is to-die-for delicious! It's light and airy, not too sweet, perfection!This a great local spot that is BYOB (and wine), and you can usually grab a table for a small party of 4 or so. Everyone is super friendly and welcoming. Delivery is great also, I never have any issues. Fresh ingredients, nice people, BYOB, you can't go wrong!
2019-11-27,2,SLEAZY! We used to go here all of the time and def will not moving forward. With all of the amazing Italian restaurants in Hoboken, we only go here because of the parking lot. We ordered a simple take out order of 2 pastas and a Caesar salad. They forgot the dressing - simple task. I called to get a credit because if I wanted a regular salad I could have made that myself. First the girl at the front desk tells me the dressing is "free", then the manager gets on the phone and tells me he wants to come pick up the salad! Then I get a call from delivery.com saying they will credit me 50% but they refuse to pay in full. A) who says that and b) customers be aware that you might get someone else's return!! GROSS! On top of it the pasta was dried out and the bread was stale. Go somewhere else!!
2019-11-17,4,A solid four star restaurant.   Table of 12 had we could hear our conversation without issue.  Very nice vibe.   Staff were excellent.  Past and meatballs were excellent.   Chicken Marcela veal parm also very good. Pesto gnocchi was not very good.  Salads and desserts were also excellent.  BYOB keeps the bill very cheap.
2019-11-10,3,Decent, unpretentious Italian cooking in uptown Hoboken with pleasant service. Flatbread is provided for the table (which the restaurant calls foccacia - it's not) and it's delicious and refills are brought out. The entrees are served with veggies, but a paltry amount. Between my girlfriend and I, I think there was less than 1/2 of one carrot and 1/2 of a stalk of broccoli as the 'veggie' side. Pretty disappointing.The chicken parm was delicious, but it could have done with some more mozz and - well - parmesan, which I didn't taste or see at all! My girlfriend's chicken francese was over battered - the coating was straight sliding off the chicken, and a tad bland for our tastes.The meatballs (which we got as a side) were delicious!Overall not bad and I could see myself coming back for comfort food, but nothing special.
2019-10-20,5,This was probably the best event we have hosted! We had our daughter's baptism here today and I can't say enough good things about our experience with Joe and San Giuseppe's restaurant from start to finish! Joe met with us to discuss the event and went into length about our options for the day. Then, he was available to discuss the final details and provided wonderful input and was very very fairly priced for the amount of food and high quality of ingredients. Every guest said such wonderful things about the event and the food was fresh, delicious, and served with such a lovely presentation. The servers were professional, attentive, and very kind! The restaurant has parking which is a HUGE plus, especially for our guests with kids and older guests. I highly highly recommend San Giuseppe's for your next event! Joe is the best!
2019-09-29,5,San Giuseppe's was the perfect place to host my parent's 30th wedding anniversary. Joe, the owner, and his staff were absolutely phenomenal. The food was delicious!!!! Joe made party planning so easy and stress free. He really goes above and beyond for his customers. I cannot thank him enough! The staff even played my parent's wedding song as they cut their cake.  It was such a beautiful evening. Thank you San Giuseppe's!!!
2019-09-06,5,The food and service was absolutely amazing. It's a nice little location for a quiet lunch or dinner.
2019-07-21,5,Hidden Gem! We've been coming to this spot for about 2 months now and we love it! Service is always great, never packed and clean bathrooms. The white table cloths are a nice touch to a cozy BYOB Italian restaurant.  The rice balls, vegetarian pizza, and the gnocchi pesto dish are unbelievable. We will be back for years to come and whenever family and/or friends visit, we always make sure to grab dinner here.
2019-07-14,5,We had my daughter's bridal shower at San Giuseppe this weekend. We booked the event sight unseen based on the location and a few conversations with the owners. The shower was wonderful. They could not have been more flexible and so nice! The food was wonderful and the servers were attentive. Giuseppe went out of his way to make it a wonderful party. Highly recommend!
2019-07-14,5,I can not say enough about this place!! The owner and the staff helped me plan a shower and he may have been more into in then we were!! He put so much attention to details and made sure no one needed a thing. If that wasn't enough the food was amazing and so much of it! He made the shower perfect. If you have a party book here!! They actually treated us like family!
2019-07-13,5,"Hidden Gem" is an annoying cliche, but that describes this place to a tee. Hidden on the backstreets of uptown Hoboken, SG is a FANTASTIC combination of food and hospitality. Italian classics literally sourced from Mama's own recipes, from appetizers to desserts you will be completely satisfied in every way. The owner is a wonderfully generous and friendly soul from Manhattan's Little Italy, where large portions and a festive atmosphere are table stakes. San Giuseppe is worth the walk, Uber or drive (they have parking!!). Go go go.
2019-06-27,4,I've only ever had take out from San Giuseppe but their pizzas are always on point. Most of the time I pick up, but I've done delivery a couple of times and their pies always arrive on time and hot.Their pizza is probably one of my top 3 favorites in Hoboken. A good, straight forward pie, made right with high quality ingredients!
2019-06-22,4,Reliably high quality Italian food. Fresh ingredients, nicely prepared. Calzone, pizza, chicken parm, eggplant, cannoli. All really good.
2019-06-20,5,Amazing service. Max the server was very kind and attentive. Mario the owner is very friendly and helpful. The food was very tasty. I would highly recommend this place whether you want to grab a bite with the family or a romantic date. One of the best pizzas I've had in a while. Prices are not expensive at all.
2019-05-12,5,I finally made it to this establishment after many recommendations. I love that it is a BYOB. We only wanted something light so we started with fried calamari which was done to perfection. Next ordered a side of meatballs which I enjoyed. Their pizza was delicious and I had a cannoli to finish the meal. Loved it and we booked for MotherJust had Mother's Day at this restaurant. Decided on veal and every piece melted in my mouth. Giuseppe was wonderful and I had the best experience on Mother's Day!!
2019-05-06,5,We had our sons baptism party here on a Sunday afternoon. It was great, the food was delicious and TONS of it.  Joe was very easy to work with and very flexible. The day went smoothly and worked out great. I would have another private event here in the future.
2019-04-26,4,I've been wanting to eat here for awhile now. I really enjoyed everything here. I came here with my husband and my daughter on a weeknight. The ambiance was so nice and quaint. I loved that they have a kids menu and we were pleased with the options. We ordered fried ravioli, Mac and cheese for my daughter and a small pie. Everything was SOOO GOOD from start to finish. My daughter's mac and cheese was some of the best we ever tasted. She loved it. The fried ravioli was amazing and a good size portion. The pizza was really good too!! We enjoyed our meal so much that we ordered dessert. Can I say they have some of the BEST ice cream!! Our server, Max, was so nice, courteous and personable.  Overall we really enjoyed our experience here. We will definitely be coming back. I highly recommend :)
2019-04-21,4,Came here on a Saturday for lunch. We got a pizza and vegetables pasta. The pizza was decent. Ingredients were fresh, and the crust was good. It's not as good as places like Razza, but the restaurant feels homey. The best was the tiramisu. Overall, it's a comfortable place to grab a meal, with friendly staff and unpretentious crowd.
2019-04-20,5,This place is amazing! The owner is so friendly and the food is out of the world. Must visit! PS - BYOB
2019-03-10,5,Awesome! Everything we ordered was delicious. The staff was very cool & friendly, 1 of the waiters even offered us his wine delivery guy since we didn't know it was BYOB. This spot has become our favorite Italian restaurant in Hoboken. We can't wait to go back!
2019-03-05,3,The fried mutz was amazing! But the pizza arrived frozen. I guess it would have all been great if we didn't have to reheat it.
2019-02-10,5,This is THE place to throw your private party!Joe is who you talk to and he is available and accessible anytime you need him. He was very accommodating which made the planning stress-free. The food was 100% amazing, delicious and fresh. I had my daughter in law's baby shower there, 34 women, yesterday.  All I heard yesterday, and often, was how fabulous the service and food were. A 4 hour event with many delicious courses, spaced out perfectly.  I am still hearing raves today from the guests about what a perfect party it was. The bonus is that there is parking onsite. I look forward to working with Joe again and having my special family events at San Giusseppe-  a gem in Hoboken!!
2019-02-01,2,This one is pretty simple. You can't serve somebody raw chicken parm and then not comp the meal. I thought that would be pretty obvious, but here we are. We enjoyed the food here once before, but this one was unforgivable.
2019-01-26,4,A great addition to uptown Hoboken, they are winners of the best buffalo wings in Hoboken with their grilled onions drizzled over their wings, they are known for their pizza  which cooks over 500 degrees Fahrenheit and takes under 2 minutes to heat up a pie. There most popular pizza pie is the San Giuseppe pie (prosciutto di parma, mozzarella, arugula and shaved parmigiano cheese  they host parties such as bridal showers, it is kid friendly and plenty of space for a group of people. The staff is very friendly and I would go back, normally take out on an early Friday night would take 10-12 minutes for pick up. They do have parking and they accept cash or credit. Highly recommend checking it out. It's just a matter of time til David Portnay (bar stool sports) will pop up and do the one bite challenge. Bon appetit
2019-01-15,5,Had our bridal party dinner there on Saturday and it was absolutely perfect. They seamlessly sat and fed 22 hungry guests with ease. From the appetizers to dessert, the food was never ending and couldn't be more delicious. Amanda and Joe were so easy and helpful. I would never hesitate to host another event here. Still dreaming about the pizza and rice balls! Thank you San Giuseppe's for helping us share a great night with our friends!
2018-12-29,5,Best service, best food, best atmosphere! The owner (Joe) has it going on!! He really gets it... best Italian food I've had in a long time. My family felt right at home and had a phenomenal time. BYOB which is an added bonus and there is a parking lot right out front!! Go to San Giuseppe.... You won't regret it.
2018-12-27,5,Unexpected lunch on a walk to  Trader Joe's.  I thought it would have been pizza by the slice but after we sat down, ended up ordering a 12" Margherita for the 4yo, a dish of meatballs, a salad with grilled chicken (Insalata di Campania), a side of broccoli, as well as 2 bottles of water and a cappuccino.  Everything was delicious and we ate more than we wanted to.  So much for keeping it in control after Thanksgiving!  :)
2018-12-21,5,My favorite hidden gem in Hoboken! One of the specials was burrata ravioli, it was unbelievable & so was the service! Felt like I was right at home. The owner was our waiter and he took the time to explain a lot of the dishes and the process behind making them. A lot of the menu items are homemade! Can't wait to come back.
2018-12-11,5,Amazinggggg! How have I not known about this place sooner? What a gem in Hoboken. Everything was absolutely delicious. So authentic and amazing service. This place is cozy and perfect for a girls night or a romantic date. Can't wait to come back!
2018-12-02,5,We just experienced the best restaurant and venue for my "future daughter in laws  bridal shower".... THANK YOU Giuseppe and staff for an awesome , relaxng afteroon at your place..The food was phenomenal authentic Italian. We had dined there prior but the quality was wonderful while 40 guests were being served. Giuseppe is so accomodating and allows you to turn his restaurant into the vision you want for the occasion you are celebrating. Would highly recommend! Bonus points in Hoboken to have the convenience of a parking lot.THANK YOU
2018-11-20,4,Ordered for pickup one Friday evening, because they had 25% off your first order via Grub Hub. Without the deal, it's a little pricey since it's more of a gourmet-type pizza place. There were so many pizzas that sounded really good, but we finally settled on the Quattro Stagioni (Prosciutto Di Parma, Fresh Mozzarella, Artichoke Hearts, Mushrooms and Kalamata Olives). We were a little late in picking it up, so it was a bit cold when we snuck a slice outside but even then, it was still really good. We also ordered a side of meatballs, which we enjoyed as well.Next time, we'll dine in so that the pizza will be nice and hot!
2018-11-05,5,We had my son's baptism party here this past weekend and it was amazing!  We did a price fixe menu and Joe is wonderful to work with.  The food was delicious!  We got balsamic salad and assorted pizzas for appetizers and the balsamic was thicker than others I've had and so good!  The pizzas were also delicious and we will definitely be back for those!  My husband even said they might be his new favorite.  The entrees were a choice of eggplant parm and chicken francese and for dessert we had assorted cookies, plus some cupcakes we brought in ourselves.  All of my guests raved about the food and it was very reasonably priced which made my husband and I happy!  The best part of this restaurant is the great space, BYOB, no corking or cake cutting fees and the owner, Joe, who was so accommodating and responsive during the planning process and while at the event.  Thank you, San Giuseppe!  We can't wait to have future events here :)
2018-10-26,5,Fresh ingredients. Hand made pizza you can see them make the dough right there! Veggie pizza was great! The penne pasta was great!!
2018-09-28,1,I was excited to try this place I ordered 45 minutes before they were going to close and they sent me essentially a raw pizza they were at my door 28 minutes after ordered. Friday night and there too lazy cook my pizza properly. Thanks for stealing my money. I'm prolly going to get sick from the raw dough of the 2 slices I ate.
2018-09-23,5,We had an amazing time for our sons 30th bday! Not easy to serve a group of 40 patrons and provide friendly service and a consistent great taste in every bite.  Everyone raved about the food from quality to quantity. Plan to go back for sure. Plus great bonus to have free parking and be a BYOB in Hoboken!!!!!!
2018-09-14,5,I don't know how I never managed to get to this uptown gem before. Dined with my husband, one year old and SIL. My SIL came from JC which worked out perfectly because they have their own parking lot. The owner was overly accommodating to my daughter immediately offering crayons and allowing us to fold up our stroller behind our table as they were not crowded. We started with the pollo al forno (wings with caramelized onions) and the Insalata di Campania. I was skeptical about baked wings with onions but based on Yelp I had to try them. I was not disappointed! You have to get a bite of chicken, onion, and the blue cheese that comes with it and it is heaven! What a great combo I never would have put together. My husband doesn't even like onions and was literally scraping the plate and dipping the onions into the blue cheese. The Campania salad was also extremely satisfying and again not like anything I've had before when it comes to arugula salad. I would go back just for the appetizers. The strips of seasoned bread that were on our table were delicious and was the perfect finger size to occupy my toddler.For dinner I had the rigatoni, my husband had the saltimbocca and my SIL had the chicken and sausage special. I was the only one with a pasta dish and definitely feel that the portion was generous. I thought I would be taking some home but ended up inhaling the entire dish. The rigatoni was cooked perfectly and was just right to share with my toddler. We were all happily stuffed but I demanded we share a cannoli for dessert because...duh cannolis! My husband who is a picky Italian said he loved the cannoli and would come back to order some to take away the next time we host an event. The cannoli itself was drizzled with chocolate, the filling was light and just the right amount of sweet unlike other cannolis that are dense and have A LOT of sugar.I will be back very soon, probably tonight because my stomach is growling as I write this review. Can't wait to try the pizza!!
2018-09-09,5,I worked with Joe at San Giuseppe to host a surprise engagement dinner and I am glad I chose this restaurant.  Joe delivered on everything we agreed on for the dinner and some more. The food was great and plentiful and the service was awesome.  Also, the parking space is a plus. I highly recommend this restaurant for an event or for just some delicious Italian food.
2018-08-22,5,We has our son's baptism party here and had amazing service!  Joe and Mario are great to work with and the food was amazing.  Everything was spectacular and reasonably priced compared to other places in town. They closed the space for us too. Highly recommend.
2018-08-18,5,Amazing amazing food! Everyone was super friendly and the service was amazing. The calamari was fresh and even had roasted grape tomatoes with it, I never had anything like it and I grew up in an Italian household. Their homemade red sauce was fire and the pizza is to die for. Not everyone can finesse Napoli style pizza but San Giuseppe pulls it off perfectly. Definitely coming back and bringing new people.
2018-08-12,5,This restaurant has such a home-feel vibe! The owner is very outgoing every time we come in. The food is great and it is BYOB. The mozzarella and prosciutto is to die for
2018-08-05,5,I had my daughters baby shower here in June 2018 for 50 people.The event was excellent from start to finish.  The appetizers were prepared tastefully, the selections of entrees was perfect and the portions were beyond plentiful.  The staff went over and beyond to make this day a special one.  Everything was yummy!!!! I would recommend this venue for a party or just for dinner.  EXCELLENT
2018-08-03,5,More than just a gourmet pizza restaurant.  We were looking for a good place to have lunch for my son's birthday (he attends nearby Stevens Institute of Technology).  We got there in the later part of the afternoon, so it was more of an early dinner and benefited from beating the crowd.  One of the owners was there and he gave us some excellent recommendations from the menu.  Fantastic meal!  Everything was exquisitely prepared.  Did I mention that there's a small parking lot (important factor for Hoboken)?
2018-06-29,5,We had a great meal after the movies next door. We haven't been here in about two years and I guess ownership has changed. They always had great pizza, but now they have expanded the menu and everything was great. I had chicken and my wife had salmon. Both were really good. The vegetables were perfect and the price was very fair. Our waitress did a great job. Of course you can spend much more and get great Italian food, but this is a little gem that is worth the trip and the price. We will be back often. By the way, they still have great pizza.
2018-06-29,1,Wish I could give zero stars, as my entire order is going straight in the trash. The attached photo is supposed to be mozzarella sticks. The cheese exploded and the breading itself was burned. The pasta dish I ordered tasted like store bought penne in a pan of burned oil without any garlic or seasoning. It tasted repulsive. I will not be ordering from here again.
2018-06-01,5,My husband and I had our son's baptism here back in April and it was fantastic!!  Joe was so great to work with and really made things easy.  The food and atmosphere were perfect and we got lots of compliments from friends and family about how good it was.  There was almost too much food!! We highly recommend!!
2018-05-21,5,San Giuseppe hosted my daughter's communion this past weekend.  We had been there multiple times before but never for a party.  Joe and his staff did an amazing job.  Everything went very smoothly from the early planning process to the execution of the entire party.The fried calamari appetizer is possibly the best calamari I have ever had.  The pizza was even better than I had remembered.  We also had the raviolis and the sauce was spectacular.I received many compliments from friends and family about how good the food, staff and location were setup.  While I loved hearing them, it is really all about Joe and his staff's flawless execution.My son is already asking us to book San Giuseppe for his communion next year.
2018-05-20,5,This place never fails. I've been at this amazing restaurant 3 times and the third time has been the most memorable one yet. I was surprised by my boyfriend, celebrating my graduation, with all my family and friends. Joe yet again made magic happen! He and his mom are such a great host. We had the pre-fixe menu where we started off with pizzas and calamari. Then two entrees - choice of bow tie alla vodka, or spaghetti with garlic oil and basil. The next entree was a choice between salmon and chicken parm. I ordered the bow tie pasta and chicken parmigiana - most delicious Italian food ever. You can taste the authenticity of their food. It's just that good. Don't even get me started with their cookies!!! Those melt in your mouth not too sweet pastries...I think the next time I come here, I have to meet the chefs/bakers. Thank you SO much to San Giuseppe. This fun, intimate spot is the best venue to hold parties with your closest friends and family. The location is perfect and easy to get to. Hands down never fails. We love our San Giuseppe family and definitely recommend it to everyone craving authentic Italian food!!!!
2018-05-08,5,I recently hosted a baby shower at San Giuseppe and it was perfect! Joe was a pleasure to work with from the start; he sent a bunch of pictures for possible layouts and was flexible with the menu, which allowed us to make the event our own. The food was amazing and you get a TON of it! Each person had 2 appetizers, a pasta dish, an entree, and cookies for dessert (in addition to our cake). The wait staff was wonderful and our guests were coming up to us throughout the day to compliment them. I would highly recommend this place for a private event or a nice dinner.
2018-03-17,5,Enjoyed our family dinner tonight. We ordered a few appetizers (calamari, burrata, wings and clams) to start off and then ordered the gnocchi in pesto sauce, farfalle in vodka sauce, ravioli and the 16" salciccia dolce pizza. We finished our meal with some yummy cheesecake and tiramisu. Everything was delicious- the gnocchi, burrata and clams were my favorite. My family loved the place! Great service, lovely ambience and delicious food- we will definitely come back. Thanks for making our dinner memorable!
2018-03-04,2,Was excited to return to San Giuseppe after an amazing dining experience my boyfriend and I had two years ago, in fact we raved to friends and family how amazing the pizza was. That was not the case for our latest visit. Needless to say, regardless our experience, the restaurant location and ambiance is wonderful. Tucked away from all the hustle and bustle of the main ave, one of the best attributes of this restaurant is that it has its own parking lot with plenty of parking spaces.After being seated, the waitress came over and asked for our drink order, we received our drinks and my glass had ice whereas my boyfriend's drink had none. Odd, but we looked past it. They also brought what seemed like pizza crusts as the "bread." They were very bland and definitely needed an oil/vinegar or marinara side. Upon making our food order, we asked if we can make our pie half bianca and half Italian sausage. Our waitress shouted over our table to the pizza maker asking if the bianca pie has red sauce. Mind you, bianca literally translates to white in which I couldn't help but giggle when she asked this question.We ordered the Melanzane Ripiene as an appetizer and while eating it, we realized it was missing the mozzarella as the menu stated and lacked any flavor. Disappointed with the appetizer, we waited to receive the main course, the pizza that we fell in love with 2 years back. When the pizza arrived we already knew something was different, just by the way it looked. And after eating it, we knew it was definitely not the same pizza. The quality of the pizza was not worth the $$, in fact there are plenty of pizza places in Hoboken that served better pizza than what we had last night. We gave it 3 out of 5 stars, mediocre at best.After reading others reviews, I learned that owners of this establishment have changed and leaves me to question if that's when the quality of the food also changed. Very sad we had this experience last night because this used to be a place we once truly loved. Last night will be our last visit to San Giuseppe.
2018-02-25,2,The food here is subpar. Tried here twice just to be sure it wasn't a one off thing since the reviews seem to indicate they have good food. The ambiance was also not great. Fake candles, brighter lights then you would expect. We weren't read any specials or asked if we wanted any water with our meal. A lot better places to go in Hoboken. Won't go back here.
2018-02-23,1,Extremely rude owner.Called in for a pizza, went to pick it up after 40 mins (per their ETA: 30 mins). Pizza was not ready, but they continued to serve other takeout orders. Was asked to wait 10 mins or cancel..... then 10 mins later the owner tells me the pizza got burnt ??.. waited some more time. Eventually questioned the wait and the owner was EXTREMELY rude and refused to even serve the order (never seen anyone do this before). I am better off elsewhere, they can have their pizza themselves. I was planning to have them serve a corporate order on a monthly base, well their loss. Highly recommend choosing another place with someone who is respectful to their patrons.
2018-02-17,5,Best place in Hoboken !   The food was amazing !   Great specials   The owners  treat you like family !   The cleanest bathrooms I ever seen in a restaurant !   Bring some wine and enjoy yourself !
2018-02-10,2,The food is terrific here but the service is terrible.  We brought our two birthday friends here and we made a reservation. The food took forever to come out and the birthday boy got his food last, after everyone else had their food for at least 10 mins.  We had to ask for ice, water, and bread multiple times before we finally got them. Finally, when I personally spoke to the owner, very politely, about doing something for the birthday boys as a courtesy for the poor service, he agreed but when I suggested an alternative to his proposed compensation, he got angry and gave me an attitude.  He accepted it in the end but this was just not an hospitable way to treat your customers. In addition the waitress had the audicty to talk to one of my friends at the table in Spanish about her annoyance with me speaking to her boss instead of her and gave me a dirty look. Overall, not a place I would come back since the staff collectively was just not welcoming.
2018-02-10,5,This place was amazing. We were in a time crunch before a movie and they took care of us in the middle of a big party. Most place would probably not have accommodated us. The owner came right over and make sure our food was made promptly so we could make our movie. The food was sooo good too. Can't wait to go back!
2018-01-16,1,Updating review since ownership changed.. Pizza is subpar, overpriced and service was poor.
2017-12-16,5,Place has a great new family taking over it. Food is amazing, updated, but classic. Apps were great. I had the whole branzino, perfectly done. We were in with a big group and they did an amazing job with the services. I would definitely come again.
2017-12-13,4,Had the opportunity to eat here on a Tuesday night with my girlfriend. The ambience is great. Low lighting, romantic, and soft rock from the 70's that'll induce almost any couple, young or old, to add to the population. There's even a parking lot which is an absolute rarity in Hoboken.The owner, Joe took care of us personally. Joe is incredibly passionate about what he does and it comes through in spades.Joe prides himself on his mozzarella, so we started with the Burrata. It was creamy and delicious.For entrees my girlfriend had a special, a veal rollatini with prosciutto. I had the pappardelle with duck ragu. Both dishes were excellent. Whenever I try out a new Italian spot that I can see myself eating at over and over again, I start by ordering some form of their ragu/bolognese. The duck ragu special did not disappoint whatsoever. The sauce was fantastic.The only reason I rated a 4 out of 5 stars was for the price of the meal. 2 entrees and an appetizer (no drinks - it's byob) came out to $70 before tip. On the other hand, it's Hoboken and these guys have bills to pay. Very satisfied with my experience and would highly recommend trying them out.
2017-12-12,5,This past Sunday myself and two friends met at San Giuseppe for dinner. Made a 5:45PM reservation, just in case, but there were a few open tables and a few large reserved tables. With visiting a new restuarant, always better to be safe then sorry reservation wise. First order of business: BYOB and there's a parking lot. Which as you know in Hoboken is a total win. Second: Atmosphere. Comfortable, not too pretentious, priced well. Service was exceptional. Felt like we were being welcomed into someone's home.Third: The food is fantastic. Seriously really really good. We wanted to try a variety of things so we ordered the buratta appetizer that came with very thin slices of prosciutto, roasted red peppers and tomatoes-DELISH. Also ordered a salad to start. Then the pesto gnocchi which was like perfect clouds and the capresa pizza. The pizza is really good. Overall, more than happy with my meal and would love to go back! Oh, and order the buratta. You will not regret it.
2017-12-05,5,We had a baby shower here this past Sunday and it was flawless.  Joe and his staff we extremely nice and very attentive.  There is ample free parking and a beautiful interior.  Joe helped us plan our event and was a pleasure to work with.  The food was fantastic, I've been to numerous Italian restaurants in Hoboken over the years and his fried ravioli and homemade burrata was the best of I've ever had.  Delicious homemade pasta and exceptional Chicken Francaise and Parmigiana.  We wish we were in Hoboken more often because we would be regular customers.
2017-12-03,5,Where do I start? First, I joined yelp JUST to review this place. I started out with a large party of 21 (that eventually became 16) for my husband's birthday dinner. I called San Giuseppe because the hubs and I had been there before, but not in quite some time. We wanted an Italian byob and this fit the bill. We did not know they had undergone a change in ownership/management. From the second Joe returned my call he was accommodating and had great ideas for how we could create a pre fixe menu for our large party. He let me come in early to decorate the tables. He introduced me to his mom and brother. I would have come back even if the food was just good. It was way better...We were blown away. Do yourself a favor and start with the bruschetta. So simple, yet so easy to mess up for other places. San G gets it SO right. Every bite of every part of our meal was better than the last. And they actually have parking! Do yourself a favor, grab a bottle of wine and head over there. Pizza or pasta, you won't be disappointed. The prices are reasonable and fair, the food is out of this world and Joe and his fam treated us like we were guests in their home. His mom was an absolute doll!  I'll see you there!
2017-11-29,5,I was in Jersey recently dog sitting for the night in Hoboken and decided to stop by San Giuseppe since it was near by for dinner and am so glad I did!! Not only was I veryyyy happy to see that the restaurant is BYOB but also the food was beyond amazing! It's very hard especially in NYC to find a restaurant serving true Italian dishes (not even in Little Italy!!) so I was happy to see an amazing menu with some of my favorite dishes and some new items as well! I tried the special which was a Lobster Ravioli with a really nice light sauce that was delicious and not too heavy. The pizza was very good too...I'm not a pizza person but I had a few slices of their San Giuseppe Pizza which I think is one of their signatures and I would come back for more! Even though I live in Manhattan I would 100% come back to Hoboken for dinner again at San Guiseppe. Ohhhh and the Tiramisu is on point...I could barely fit any more food in but one of the owners was so sweet and brought some over and I had to indulge!=======================================================
2017-11-28,5,I just recently went with my Dad and I honestly don't have enough good things to say about this place. First of all, the owners are great people and you can tell the heart they put behind each of their dishes. Second, the food was ON POINT. I've had a lot of burrata in my life and I can truthfully say this was the best I've ever had - you 1000% need to order this anytime you go. I had the farfalle alla vodka and it was to die for.  Definitely going back soon!
2017-11-26,4,I have eaten here several times and the meal is always delicious. The red snapper livornese is my favorite. The burrata melts in your mouth. The melanzane ripiene was fantastic. It is BYOB and if you forget, they can offer a phone number of a liquor store to call to have wine delivered. And there is a parking lot. All this, plus great service!
2017-11-19,4,Cute hidden gem in Hoboken! Owners are extremely nice, food is great, parking lot for customers, not too loud! All around a lovely experience.
2017-10-30,5,Neighborhood gem. Fresh homemade food. Pizza excellent. Pastas delicious. Appetizers wonderful. Staff friendly and attentive. Owner on site to make sure you have a positive experience. Been here once before and was so so but under new management will definitely be back.
2017-10-29,4,I had a yummy early dinner here at San G. The server recommended the minestroni soup and added a rave revue to it so I accepted the challenge. The home made soup was amazing, so you have to try it. The menu contains favorite italian dishes and pizza. I had the Chicken Francese and it was very tasty. It's BYOB also. Parking lot in front for your convenience.
2017-10-28,5,New owners are amazing and truly care about the overall quality and taste of the food.  The eggplant appetizer is amazing. The branzino compares to the best restaurants in the city.  The filet mignon specials are always delicious.  Makes for a very enjoyable, laid back evening full of great food.
2017-10-12,5,This family owned gem of a BYOB restaurant does Italian food the right way. Coal fired pizza oven, freshly made mozzarella, fresh seafood all cooked to perfection...the waitstaff was very friendly and attentive. Very warm, yet spacious dining room would be great for parties..All this, and a parking lot, which is a big deal in this area...we will definitely be back!
2017-10-08,5,This place is absolutely the best.  Their food is all good and they will accommodate your requests. All homemade stuff including desserts.
2017-10-04,5,Went there over the weekend on a date night with my wife. The pizza was delicious. I highly recommend the San Giuseppe pie. The Tiramisu was one of the best we have ever had. Friendly and courteous staff. The owner cared about the customers. He came over to all the tables to ensure the customers were having a great experience. Restaurant also has a parking lot. Can't wait to go back.
2017-10-02,5,Wish I knew about this place sooner! Great little BYOB hidden gem. The bruschetta was delicious, and pizza was spot on. The Chef/owners made us feel like we were having dinner at their home. Everything was great. Can't wait to come back!
2017-10-02,5,I was looking for a restaurant in the Hoboken/Jersey City area to celebrate my 30th Birthday and I'm so happy I decided on San Guiseppe. Of all the places I called, Guiseppe was the most personable and made it very easy to plan the dinner. The restaurant provided an intimate setting for my family and friends, and gave an authentic Italian feel. The food was delicious and all made in-house, I particularly loved the bruschetta and penna alla vodka. Everyone couldn't stop raving and we all left pleasantly stuffed. As well, the service was on point and very friendly. Bonus, they have free parking! Which was great for my guests that aren't use to the limited parking spots in Hoboken.
2017-10-01,5,We came here for a birthday dinner, family style (24 people).  The food was delicious and the portions were perfect. They did not skimp on plate sizes or quality of food.Everything tasted fresh and homemade. The wait staff was on point and kept the tables clean of dirty/ empty dishes. I will definitely return!
2017-10-01,5,Stopped in this cute neighborhood spot after work with my boyfriend and really enjoyed the food and atmosphere! We had a penne pasta special with sliced filet mignon that was delicious. We'll definitely be back.
2017-09-29,3,First, the positives of which there are several.  Very nice atmosphere, parking!, outdoor dining, white tablecloths, attentive staff, accomodating, BYO.  All good!Now, the food -  very mediocre.  Granted, we are particular, foodies even (hate that term but guilty nonetheless).  Gnocchi was heavy, pesto not beautiful fresh green but brown.  Chicken added to farfalle vodka definitely frozen and bland.  Fish special too salty.  Pizza pretty good.  Meatballs OK, but too soft.  Tomato sauce, eeh.Overall, OK but not great.
2017-09-27,5,As soon as I walked into the restaurant, I felt happy and loved the ambience. The decor of the place was out of this world. I was excited to see the lighting, candles and a beautiful table setting as I entered San Giuseppe. It felt very romantic and the owner was very attentive, delightful and pleasant to us the entire evening. The service was impeccable and the food was savory and delicious. I reside in the city and I will continue to come to this restaurant because it was one of the best restaurants I've ever been to because of the service, owner, food and the overall love i felt when I dined with me and my lady.
2017-09-23,5,My family all loves this place. The restaurant is lovely. The waitstaff and manager are friendly and the food is so good. Tonight 1 of us had a pizza, another had ravioli, 1 had rigatoni and a 4th had meatballs and spaghetti- all great. The desserts were amazing, loved the cheesecake w the lemon ricotta. It is especially helpful that parking is easy - so unusual in Hoboken. And it's BYO. What more could you ask!
2017-09-21,1,I used to order this place all the time. Warning - they changed the wings. I used to order them when they were a little cheaper but now they're definitely not worth the 15 bucks they're charging now. They added buffalo sauce or something - too bad bc they used to be the best in Hoboken. Chicken parm had good sauce. That's about it.  Price should probably be cut in half. Small piece of chicken that had an old oily taste and doesn't come with homemade pasta. M on Washington has the best - double the amount of chicken, awesome seasoning, and comes with homemade pasta instead of bland,cheap potatoes and carrots.  They also skimped me on the mozzarella and charged me 3 bucks extra. Spaghetti aglio was too spicy to eat and extremely small (it came in a small container instead of the dinner size). Very pricey given the size and that the pasta isn't homemade. Five stars for the delivery guy. He was fast and cordial.
2017-09-15,1,New ownership is ridiculous. This will be short and simple. My wife asked for penne arrabiata, aka tomato sauce and jalapenÃÉos or red pepper flakes. They tried to charge us $23. That is $7 more than any other pasta dish on the menu, but because it was a "special" order, the price is automatically $23. The owner then admitted that the server should have told us. Will not be back, suffice it to say.
2017-09-12,5,This has been a long time favorite of ours we often come and see Joe (the owner) he let's jax make a small pizza at the table and we always get the award winning wings etc. . So imagine our shock when we came last week asking for joe and we find out it was sold!!!!!  We are deciding do we stay or go is the menu the same? Omg the chicken wings WILL THEY STILL HAVE THE CHICKEN WINGS??!! ok let me tell you we decided to stay and thank god we did.  They did change the menu a bit but they still have the chicken wings (order off menu) and they not only let jax  make a pizza but let him do it at the pizza making station.  The chicken wings were actually even better if that's possible. The new menu items are fantastic and flavorful.  It's a family run business with Toni their mom as the weekend hostess who loves children and went out of the way to find us a table when they were booked.  So fear not San Giuseppe is still a delicious hoboken gem not to be missed.
2017-09-08,5,Great food. Great staff. Great atmosphere. Owner/Manager couldn't have been nicer. Definitely coming here again!
2017-09-08,5,Had a great dinner here with my family! The staff couldn't be nicer, they were all extremely helpful. The owner was great and came over to each table to check and see how everyone was doing. I highly recommend this place, great food and great people!
2017-09-05,5,San Giuseppe is kind of like one of those secret places not many know about and once you find it, you want it to be your secret!  It's a bit off the beating path but that comes with a great perk for those traveling by car - PARKING!   If you are driving this means you already enter the restaurant in a good mood!  Stress free!   Once you enter, the atmosphere is casual with a warm and elegant feel.  The owners and their team are extremely friendly and add to the sense of it being "your secret place".   Then comes the food!   For Pizza snobs like myself, this is among the very best Jersey has to offer.    Truly!   The burrata cheese is a special source of pride for the owners, and once you have it, you will know why.   Honestly, everything we ate on our recent visit was fantastic!    It's worth the car ride from outside of Hoboken or an Uber from within!   Check it out!
2017-08-21,5,Try the Name sake San Giuseppe pizza - it is amazing!  Probably one of the top five pizzas I've had in the area!
2017-08-21,5,Best pizza in hoboken hands down!!! The portion is a bit small but the quality is far superior to anything else, it is truly one of a kind perfect thin crust pizza
2017-08-20,1,Dreadful service.  Wretched food.  At least the men's room was clean!This place used to be good, but the last few experiences have been pretty awful.  We went there for dinner this weekend -- one of the two entrees we ordered was inedible.  We would have loved to have brought that fact to the attention of our waitress, but neither she nor any other staff member passed by our table for 15 minutes.  Then, when we told her the dish was inedible, that we were dissatisfied, and that we just wanted the experience to (mercifully) end by her bringing us the check, her response was to ask whether we wanted her to wrap the offensive entree, as though she didn't listen to a word we said.  But that's not the end of this story.  After another 15 minutes of watching the waitress ignore us, we had to get up and ask her, a second time, for the check.  She told us a manager was handling it.  For another five minutes (20 minutes after we first asked for the check), we watched the manager do absolutely nothing to get us our check.  Not wanting to spend the entire night in this restaurant, I again got up to ask for my check (our third such request), this time by speaking directly to the manager.  He was at the register, asked me if I was sitting at Table 19 (as though I worked there and knew the restaurant's table numbering system), and told me he would get me the check in a few minutes.  At this point, the sheer incompetence on display was as amusing as it was infuriating, so I shook my head, sat back down at my table, and pulled out my phone to write a review.  Then, a few minutes later, the manager came over and brought me a check ... for the wrong table!!! By the way, the restaurant was pretty much empty while all this was happening.  I can see why.
2017-08-20,5,Great place! We came in last night since they re-opened under new management. Food: amazing! We tried the Thin crust pizza, homemade pasta, delicious burrata cheese and cold fired chicken wings: all very good! Service: wonderful! Natalia was our server, very sweet and professional. We are definitely coming back soon.
2017-08-12,5,This has been one of the best Italian restaurants in Hoboken since it opened. It's now under new management and if you were worried that it might decline, you can stop worrying. The food and service are consistently good. We love to go there after we come out of the movies across the street. Try the pizzas and the gnocchi with pesto.
2017-08-09,1,I received a gc for San Giuseppe for Christmas.  I just called to use it and was told that they're sorry but theyre not honoring it because they changed hands. What a disgrace! The waiter wanted to apologize. I don't need an apology. I'm sure there must have been a clause in the contract when they bought the restaurant. I hope you can't just screw everybody and start new.  If anyone knows the laws please email me or let me know.Thanks, Bonnie Lee Bentley
2017-04-23,5,Went here with friends before heading to Mile Square Theater. Great dinner - I had the puttanesca pasta and the burrata. Fantastic! Thoroughly enjoyed my dining. Will return.
2017-04-23,4,San Giuseppe is a small quiet restaurant. They play an array soft jazz that makes you feel like this is the perfect place to go for date night. The food itself was delicious and to top it all of there was PARKING which is like finding a needle in a hay stack in Hoboken. The only call out I have is that you are not able to order a glass of wine, you have to order a whole bottle.
2017-03-23,5,We came with a groupon type deal. We ordered the wings which were unbelievable and a personalized pie to split. Really was delicious and great ambiance. Will be back!
2017-03-14,4,I've lived in Hoboken for 3 years and yet never knew this place existed.  My boyfriend took me here for Valentine's Day and I felt like I was entering a secret, hidden part of Hoboken.  It's way uptown by the movie theater and they even have a parking lot (which is unheard of in this town). It is SO nice inside with the perfect ambiance for date night.  The chicken wings were delicious and we had the arugula pizza and the margherita pizza.  They were both very good but the main issue is that it is SO overpriced.  The arugula pizza is 24 dollars!  I did enjoy it here but the prices just seem outrageous.  Our server was great and we had a great night, but I don't know that I would be back solely because of the prices.
2017-02-11,3,Owner does care about feedback. I did notice an improvement after my first review. The owner is very hands on here. The location and ambience (apart from the TVs) is quaint (God forbid if an American has to live 2 hours without a TV to gawk at). The only problem I have with the place is the wine. You can not order a glass; you have to order a bottle (I am a very light drinker so this means I just do not drink here at all :)Other than that, they have the best Arugula salad in Hoboken. Also, as I said before, they do not bring the Garlic. In other words, the sauces for pizza and pasta have zero garlic in them, which is something I crave when I eat at an Italian (that's because I am 50% Italian).
2017-01-31,3,We went here looking for Bresaola and was the only place in the area we were able to find it in so thats a plus! Great the fact that it is BYOB and has parking. Salad was ok, Bresaola was ok however Chicken wings were delicious! Coal fired wings with caramelized onions! As for entrees I didn't get to try what the others in my party got but one was Penne with Pesto and Chicken and she really liked it and a Margherita Pizza that was good too. I was disappointed with the selection of pastas, only 4 options. I got Spaghetti and Polpettes (Meatballs) and I thought it was just ok. If you are looking for pasta I don't recommend this place, come if you want Pizza!
2017-01-28,5,Had an amazing experience today! This is a small cozy restaurant with amazing food. Prosciutto de Parma pizza which was great. The fire coal oven gives the pizza a unique flavor I have not tasted before. I also had the coal fried chicken wings which were excellent. The staff was nice and attentive. This place is BYOB which is a plus always!
2017-01-27,5,In short. Incredible! My wife and I have been to this restaurant several times and it never fails to have us wanting more! I felt guilty for never writing a review until now. -Friendly & Knowledgeable service.-Fresh and Delicious.-Ample parking which is hard to find here in Hoboken.We recommend their Award Winning Coal Fire Chicken Wings, they're complimented with caramelized onions for a full rich flavor. (They are not deep fried). Also, to compliment the Wings for starters we had their Insalata Toscana w/ grilled shrimp which comes with romaine lettuce, chick peas, cannellini beans, cherry tomatoes tossed with extra virgin olive oil and topped with parmigiano reggiano.. fresh and zesty. For our entree we had an San Giuseppe Signature Pie, 14 inch L' Italiana Pizza with butternut squash puree, Fontina cheese, crimini mushrooms and my fave.. Truffle oil. It was an explosion of flavors!  Highly recommended. crispy and hands down delicious.We are super excited to go back. Definitely FOR Valentines day. So I have to make a reservation! Or we might go sooner. lol I dare to say. Don't miss out on the BEST ITALIAN food in Hoboken! Thanks Giuseppe!- Alfredo
2017-01-19,5,Amzing this place ,,, always very good service and the food is very tasty... it like u are eating in italy...its very acomadating.. i love the fat they are BYOB ... also the owner is very kind and always make sure that everything is ok... THE CHICKEN WINGS ARE AMAZING....
2017-01-19,5,I give the place 5 stars because is very good the varieties of pizza that they have.. also they're service is amazing and on point .. i love the BYOB... that's a huge plus as well as the parking lot.. I'll be back again... love it
2017-01-13,1,Have been ordering from here at least once per month for the past year or so.  After this last time, NEVER AGAIN.  Both my boyfriend and I suffered from severe food poisoning this week after eating their pizza.  I'm talking we were both out of commission for two full days. Not to mention, when we recently dined in at the restaurant (we usually order), the service was just terrible.  They also don't do wine by the glass when you dine in and the take out is incredibly overpriced.  As I said, NEVER AGAIN. You have lost our business forever.
2017-01-07,2,I used to love this place but they have changed their menu and do not offer as many entrees as they used to. Their pizza is good but it is a bit pricey and not necessarily what I used to like going there for. I also think the salads became smaller. The last time I was there, the portion was so tiny- certainly not worth what I paid for it. Bring back your old menu and portions!
2017-01-06,1,Pizza took 2 hours and came salty chewy and dry. Hoboken just reached another all time low for crappy food and service. Never ceases to amazes me
2017-01-01,5,Absolutely love this place. Must order wings and pizza. Service is excellent and prices are reasonable. So cozy inside. Love that it is family run. The owner really takes pride and it shows. Have never had a bad meal here.  Parking in front and BYOB really seal the deal.
2016-12-02,1,I was a recurrent customer, but I am extremely disappointed with the service recently. Last time we ordered, the quality of the food was not the same and today I ordered a pizza that was supposed to arrive at 8:20pm (the order was placed at 7:30). It is now 9:00pm and it has not arrived yet! I call the restaurant and they can't give me a precise answer on when they will arrive. This is unacceptable and very disappointing!
2016-12-02,5,I ordered pizza and it was good and owner was very polite and i like the atmosphere of the restaurant and i def like red lights. They seem like Turkish flag. I wish they could have orange juice or apple juice on their menu. Reason i am giving 5 star owner is very nice person and polite and he care about his costumers. As a restaurant owner i wanna be fair.
2016-11-06,2,I'm giving this place 2 stars because the food was really good,  the service was really bad, the server never came to check if the food was good or not and while we were eating another waitress star to sweep the floor near us. Cherry on the top, when he came to clear the plates he just gave us the check, never asked if we need it anything else, we wanted dessert and coffee but another place helped us with that.
2016-10-12,1,This review is being updated for the business under new ownership. Don't waste your time or money with this place. The service was terrible and there was an issue with both of our pizzas being served with the wrong ingredients and we were up-charged beyond listed prices anyway. Talking to the owner was a joke, he didn't even attempt to make it right except to argue that the ingredients they ended up using were more expensive than what we actually ordered. This is an empty shell of what san giuesppe's used to be.Previous review for original ownershipThis is my favorite spot for pizza in Hoboken! They have inventive gourmet pizzas with generous toppings and a delicious coal fired crust. The pizzas are large and good for 2-3 people. The owner and main chef is from Italy and truly cares about your experience and frequently checks in on you once you receive your order. As a vegetarian my go-to pizzas are L'Italiana and Mezza Luna. L'italiana is a rich flavorful choice with butternut squash pureÃÅe instead of sauce layered with fontina cheese and crimini mushrooms, finished with a drizzle of truffle oil. The Mezza Luna is a little lighter with eggplant pureÃÅe instead of sauce and fresh mozzarella, gaeta olives and arugula. Can't decide? They even let you do half and half!For the meat eaters in your party, you can never go wrong with the Prosciutto di Parma and Arugula pie. If you don't mind the extra carbs be sure to ask for the breadsticks for the table (delicious Parmesan focaccia).As for dessert, I've tried the nutella pizza and the Romeo and Juliet dessert pizza. Nutella is great but if you want to try something different, the Romeo and Juliet is really special. They use amaretto ricotta and top it with amarena cherries, pistachios and dark chocolate shavings. Great served cold if you have any leftover to take home as well!San Giuseppes is BYOB so don't forget the wine! They do offer to arrange delivery of certain wines if you do forget.They have a free parking lot if you come in from out of town!Things to be worked on: Bring back the penne vodka!Calzone is not the size you expectService can be slow but is always friendly (need more experienced wait staff).
2016-08-26,4,I really enjoyed my dining experience at San Giuseppe. My boyfriend and I tried the Margarita pie and added fresh onions and kalamata olives. The pizza was so fresh and mouth-watering. We also tried the tiramisu and cheesecake which was delightful. I loved the ambiance of the restaurant, it had a nice feel as it was lit with candles at each table and featured low lighting. The server was friendly, very personable and knowledgeable of the menu. Keep in mind it's BYOB.
2016-08-21,2,A neighborhood place with decent pizza but way overpriced in my opinion.  Plus, it was so dark inside that I needed to use my phone flashlight to see the menu.  Four of us came and ordered 2 pizzas with one topping each, 1 salad with shrimp and 1 order of wings  - nothing but tap water to drink and the bill with tip was $75.   Maybe they keep the place dark so you cant see the prices.  The waiter was nice but the service was slow,  at least he apologized but it bugs one to see people who came after us get served first who also ordered pizza.  Last, what was disturbing was that at a table near us, a wine glass shattered on the floor.  The staff was pretty good about responding but as we left, we saw that there were shards of glass still on the floor around the other table -  the party had already left.  We pointed out to a different waiter that there was still glass on the floor and he picked up the big piece but left smaller pieces.  Maybe he couldn't see it in the dark but he was more focused on other things and there was no manager to talk to.
2016-07-27,1,Specializes In Pizza and their menu!!!! Horrible!!!!! Bring your own water bottle- they serve water in a shot glass
2016-07-10,4,So- This is my favorite neighborhood place.  Great atmosphere, good food and nice people.  I love that they've added some options for folks who are gluten free or trying to watch their carb intake.  My only criticism would be that the chicken they put on the salads is really skimpy and dry!!!!  I brought my parents to dinner there tonight and they both ordered salads with chicken- their salads had dry, tasteless and skimpy portioned chicken.   And - my parents actually suggested we try another place to dine next time we come and visit.  Giuseppe- please add a nice piece of chicken to the salads- more flavorful and a more generous portion!  Even if you have to charge more money!  We want to come back!
2016-05-28,5,I just ate, paid and am ready to go. Only thing I think of is, "I have to come back to this restaurant again". Friendly staff, BOB, parking, etc. Even the chef came to our table to make sure my order was correct!
2016-05-26,5,Things were good the next time we went there. This place will accommodate you to your satisfaction. We are really enjoying going to this place. I highly recommend to come and dine here.
2016-04-28,2,Over hyped, over priced and not as good as others.Service was also slow for an Italian/pizza place.Hoboken has a lot to offer and a lot better. For example, go to Grimaldi's and get a lot more for your money.
2016-04-21,5,Great night for dinner! Food was amazing. Had penne vodka and my date had the lasagna but I think I picked the better choice. The Waiter Seven recommended the coal fried wings we'll have to come back and try. Service was great. Definitely a must go to.
2016-04-10,5,Perfect first date ambience, awesome pizza, especially the butternut squash pizza. Met the owner and chef Giussepppe. Very personable and friendly.  Made us feel like VIPs. Our server, Sacha, was the best. We wanted to invite her to sit down with us. Would eat here every night if I lived closer.
2016-04-09,2,Love how I was seated immediately and the fact that there was a parking lot. Cute decor. However, the food was bland and tasteless! The $15.00 "award winning wings" did not taste anywhere near better than Dominos' $6 wings. GF asked waiter for "seltzer" and waiter replies "no seltzer". She asked for "club soda" and gets a "no club soda reply". She asked for regular water with lime" and gets a "no lime no lemon respond". At that point, we were waiting for him to say "just kidding with you folks" but nope they didn't have any of that. When it was time to order, GF inquired about soup and sure enough, "no soup". The icing on the cake was when the "party" of 6 next to us asked to speak to the manager. Manager came and got chewed out by a customer saying "this is ridiculous to charge me $12 to cut my own birthday cake! Take it off! You got nothing to explain to me!" Apparently, they charge $2.00 per slice to cut cake.
2016-04-06,2,There are a lot of things that I loved about my recent trip to San Giuseppe. I loved the fact that it is BYOB with no corkage fee. I loved that there was a parking lot with plenty of spots. I also loved the beautifully decorated dining room, and the fact that when I came in with a group of 8 on a Friday night that they were able to set up a table for us in the blink of an eye. So, why two stars? The food was just not good. Me and my boyfriend split chicken parm and the pappardelle bolognese and both were not enjoyable. The chicken was rubbery and didn't have nearly enough cheese, while the side of spaghetti was overcooked and drenched in what tasted like canned tomato sauce. And that was the star of the show... The pappardelle was terrible. It tasted like some kind of weird beef stew and wasn't reminiscent of any bolognese that I've ever tasted. The noodles were also soggy and overcooked. I'd come in again but for pizza and nothing more. This is definitely not a good pick if you are looking for a quality Italian entree. For $15-20 a dish you can eat more enjoyable Italian food at any local pizzeria or red sauce joint around town.
2016-04-03,5,Amazing restaurant with delicious pizzas, entree dishes  and the best chicken wings ever. Parking is a huge plus.
2016-03-13,4,We had the L Italiana Pizza & Margherita Pie- both were excellent! Parking was a plus! Chicken wings are a must! Will definitely be back! If you are in the area definitely check this place out!
2016-03-10,5,So i have checked in here in the past, but have yet to write a review after several delicious experiences! So here it is folks - hands down best pizza in a coal fired oven no less! Crust had just the right amount of chew and crisp. We did the pepperoni and garlic and also the fontina and mushrooms. Both were delicious! As an appetizer we had the wings and a salad. The wings were also amazing. Carmelized onions and crispy wings with just the right amount of seasoning. We sat outside yesterday - first day of outdoor seating, which was a real treat. The owner was super sweet. Told us they do tapas on Wednesday and Thursdays, so we can't wait to come back for that. We had planned on having pizza night and didn't want to give up on that!  Overall my favorite place in town, so this review has been long time coming.
2016-03-04,1,Tried this place on a whim because Napoli's was closed. NEVER AGAIN. They told us delivery was 50 minutes (it ended up being 1 hour 30 min). While the pizza was decent, it was by no means worth $75 for 2 medium pies, a tiny salad with 90% greens/10% toppings and 2 canoli.
2016-02-28,3,Decent Italian in Hoboken. Good ambience and nice to have byob. Wings and burratta are good but $15 for apps?  the pizza is also quite pricey for average tasting. Pasta entrees are bland and lack any creativity. Overall the menu is just average- not sure if this is a pizza place with entrees or an Italian restaurant with pizza. Service also isn't great, seems like they are always understaffed. Has potential but leaves a lot to be desired.
2016-02-19,2,THE WORST DELIVERY SERVICE EVER. They get 2 stars because the pizza is good. But it will never get to your home so it doesn't matter.
2016-02-05,2,I try to find other items here besides the pizza (which I do love, if you are a fan of thin crust), however it seems to be the one the few things they get right.  My boyfriend and I ordered 2 salads, arugula and tri color.  Kind of funny that you add endive and radicchio to a salad and you call it a different salad.  The only other difference is the dressing.  I do love the honey vinaigrette, but sadly got the wrong dressing when we picked up the food.  We also got the wings to share.  The wings are great, nice to have something different then the wings you usually see on a menu.  They forgot the focaccia bread this time.  So sadly the salads are pretty weak, considering we just paid $11 for arugula, 3 grape tomatoes, one endive leaf and some Parmesan. 2 salads and an order of wings (missing the bread) costs $40, this is a bit pricy if you ask me.  At least put a little more substance in the salads.
2016-02-05,3,Pizza here is very good, pasta as well, wings were awesome but only if you order them in the restaurant. If you order wings home, they deliver them burned. It happens to us 3 times already, last time my wife specifically ask please do not burn your wings, but they didn't listen. Service is horrible, we use to live on 13 and grand and were very frequent visitors to this place. I do not recall a single visit where something didn't go wrong, and the owner always have to come and apologize.
2016-01-31,3,I wish I could give this place 4-5 stars. I really do. I respect that a grandfather took a leap of faith to start this business in town. Please accept this candid feedback from a customer that just wants you to make improvements so you get repeat business. The pizza and pastas are actually very good. That said, the service needs to get much better. Whether it's take out or dining in, no one ever thanks you for your patronage. It feels like I'm always thanking them. Every time I get take out, I'm just handed my food with a stark stare, no smile whatsoever, ever! The owner should encourage the cashiers to thank patrons as they are handing the food. So easy. As far as waiters go, they work hard but then they'll make the oddest and most obnoxious comments, such as "wow! you guys had a ton of carbs tonight" or "wow! you guys ordered a lot of food; is this your cheat night!?"  Seriously Mr Waiter? Does your boss train you to make comments like that instead of saying thank you for dining with us. It's uncalled for. And My wife, friends and I are fit. I can't imagine how a person struggling with their weight/health would feel if they heard these comments from their waiters. So please Mr Owner, train your staff to be a little bit friendlier and polite, and to show appreciation to your patrons. A smile and thank you goes a long way and it requires minimal effort. If you make these small changes, I have no doubt your ratings and business will increase.
2016-01-24,4,Pizza Bianca is just great!And BTW, your 15% discount on the first online order didn't work in chrome and ie. It said that I wasnt qualified for the discount even though I just registered.
2016-01-17,2,I ordered from here for the first time tonight. The menu sounds fantastic and the pics on the website look great. The food, however, not so much. Hoboken has a history of being quintessentially Italian-American and the worst casualty of that heritage is its food. The "Italian" food in Hoboken is notoriously bad. This restaurant is no exception. I ordered a pizza with butternut squash pureÃÅe and truffle oil. In theory, fantastic. I asked if it was thin crust and was told yes. It wasn't (although in all fairness better than most in Hoboken). The pureÃÅe was overly sweet and is muddled by the truffle taste. The whole thing is a mess.I also ordered a Bolognese which turned out to be the worst Bolognese I've ever had. I'm completely serious. It tasted as though it had taken 10 minutes to cook and was over-powered by a tomato taste. The pasta was over cooked and starchy. Really appalling. Those two items plus tip cost about $60. Ridiculous.Don't be fooled by the propaganda. This place is no better than any corner pizzeria, but costs about 4 times as much. Shameful.
2016-01-10,4,I was looking for a new pizza place on Yelp tonight. Stumbled upon this gem thanks to fellow yelpers. We ordered the insalata arugula and the l'italiana pizza. The salad was big enough to split and the lemon dressing was on point. Not a bad deal for $10.95 considering the size. Not going to lie, I was SHOCKED at how expensive their pizzas are but hoped that they were big enough to make up for it. While the butternut squash and truffle oil pizza is AMAZING, I'm just not sure it is worth the $24 considering it's on the smaller side and only has 6 slices.I will say that our expected delivery time was 8:32 and it was at our door at 8:10. 40 minutes-not too bad!
2015-10-04,1,This place is not worth it.  Horrible service. Our waiter was never to be found. We had to ask for everything three times or more, like water or bread.  We put in an order for an appetizer and we never got it Bc they forgot about it.  Even trying to remind them we ordered it, they had no idea what we were talking about.   Food was just ok, nothing crazy. But the service will prevent me from ever going back.
2015-09-25,4,Great times here with living social coupon. Really cute place, pretty okay service, good food. GREAT wings. Was hesitant at first about wings at an Italian restaurant but after reading reviews, figured we'd try it. These are not your typical buffalo wings. There's are like Italian-style crispy delicious juice wings topped with carmelized onions. You just gotta try it.  It will be a new flavor profile of wings and surprisingly delicious. They're also BYOB and have good pizzas. Will def be coming back.
2015-09-20,3,Update: the next day, the owner called to apologize and offer a comp of the undelivered meal.  I appreciate that he was concerned at the lack of service and took measures to amend.
2015-09-18,2,Based on rave reviews from my friend and all of the positives reviews on Yelp, I was excited to come here on a Friday night to try out their food. Unfortunately, this place left me wishing I went to my original choice of Napoli's*.Service: Came here on a Friday night.  All the tables were filled outside but upon entering the place, there were at least 4 tables available.  When we entered, a few servers looked at us, but continued with what they were doing; it took a good minute or so for someone to come to the door and acknowledge us.  When we were finally seated, our utensils, plate, and napkin came piecemeal - the waiter seemed visibly annoyed that it took me a few seconds to pick up my menu so he could put my plate on the table.  When a waiter finally came to take our order, they just said "do you know what you want?" - they didn't tell us any specials, what they'd recommend on the menu, or even just speak with a smile.  Likewise, the waiter was so busy cooing over another customer's baby, it took them over 5 minutes after we ordered to bring us water, and only after we asked twice.  The only time the waiter seemed to be nice to us was when we asked for the check, and instead of giving it to us, suggested we order dessert.Food: We ordered two different pasta dishes, that unfortunately were just mediocre.  The penne alla vodka dish was my favorite, although the chicken was dry and bland.  The gnocchi was too dense, with the same bland chicken.Ambiance: The decor in the restaurant was cute and had a rustic Italian feel.  The lighting was dim and would be a good date place, if you could get past the service.*to sum up my service experience: I essentially wrote this entire review while waiting for my check.
2015-09-05,3,Came here for the good review and friend recommendation. We ordered the popular wing appetizer, a pizza, and a special pasta. The pasta was good, pizza was bland, and wing was just okay. We sat outside in early evening and I got 6 huge mosquito bites on my legs that I had to cut my dinner short and go home. Don't think I'd visit again.
2015-08-10,5,This is one of our favorite places in Hoboken! The beet salad and shrimp appetizer are delicious. I love the Pesto and Romanza pies! It's also BYOB which is lovely. The outdoor seating is nice over the summer because it's in a quiet part of town.
2015-07-15,4,Lovely place, very mellow. Good ambiance. Highly recommend the pizza with butternut squash, fontina, mushrooms and truffle oil.  Sounds like a crazy combo but really worked. Sweet and earthy and salty. I was less impressed by the pasta bueno sera. It was good, just not as stellar as the pizza. Service was quite attentive (borderline too fast and pushy--for example, he came to take our order 3 times while I was clearly still engrossed in reading the menu!). However, I was disappointed that I had noted on my open table reservation that it was my boyfriend's birthday, yet there was no acknowledgement.  We only ordered dessert because I thought they'd need a vehicle for a candle!  Had I known they would ignore the birthday occasion I would have skipped the (quite average) cheesecake. Upshot: go somewhere else for a special occasion. Definitely come here for the pizza.
2015-06-29,5,BEST WINGS EVER! And the mushroom pizza is probably in my top 3 pizzas i've ever had in my life. Everything was delicious and we weren't disappointed. The pricing is pretty high but once we got the food I knew why. Definitely worth it.I am sure everything is good - but my top recommendations are the wings (we got two orders!) and mushroom pizza. Can't wait to go back!
2015-06-27,1,Called to see if they deliver and was told no then hung up on ... Guess we won't be trying this place !
2015-06-11,4,Pros: above average foodAttentive staffClean Good atmosphere Cons: on the more expensive sideSmall tables
2015-06-06,5,I kid you not when I say tonight was our third night IN A ROW that we ordered from San Guiseppe. It is that good. First night were the wings and pizza (prosciutto and arugula) as well as a beet salad and burata. Yum!!  Second night was pasta night (and more Burata).  Bolenegse and lasagna. Both incredible (and I'm Italian). Tonight we had friends over in our garden. We were going to go out for dinner but they hadn't tried this restaurant so we thought, why not again. Have to say we won't be ordering for at least a week or two but can't recommend this place enough. It's hard to find good Italian delivery but not anymore!!
2015-05-10,5,I came in on Mother's Day with another couple.  There were 6 of us (we each have 1 kid).  The place was booked solid and there was only a table for two available.  The owner told me that he would try to accommodate us, and with a few temp tables and tablecloths, we had a table for six !The food here is very good, and I have always gotten good service.  I have come in every now and then with small children and they always get us in and out with a smile before our children get out of hand.  I like their pizza, and tonight I had the penne a la vodka with chicken, which was excellent.  I recommend the place for anyone, and especially for young families !
2015-05-09,4,My husband and I decided to check out this cute BYOB one night. We loved the fact that they had parking and were close to the movie theatre. We spilt a calzone with prosciutto to start (special of the day). It was a little burnt, but very good. I had the ravioli with a side of meatballs which I enjoyed over the course of two days (portions were large). Overall, I thought it was a little pricey for the vibe/what you got but I did enjoy my meal.
2015-04-29,5,Great BYOB spot in Hoboken - and there's parking!The wings are a must! The burrata is to die for. I always get a pepperoni pizza which is divine, my husband's had several of the pasta dishes and no complaints. Some of the best pizza in Hoboken, friendly service, wonderful family run business that was hit hard by Hurricane Sandy.
2015-04-24,1,The food is good, the service sucks.... Between the hostesses and the delivery service, it's the worst in the area. We try every once and a while to give this place another chance, and they keep disappointing. There's always a new excuse for the awful service. Just don't bother....There are enough pizza places in the area that can handle the dinner rush. On this order we placed it on delivery.com at 6pm and at 8:30pm the food has still not arrived... The hostess blames the "new girl". They just don't have the staff or the facilities to keep up with orders.
2015-04-21,3,Came here a while back when I worked in the area and got their magharita pizza which is what everyone recommonds apparently.  It was good but not the best.  The pizza is def artisanal style pizza and is cooked at the right temp but the sauce was missing something.  I will def come back and try it again ..maybe get a different topping.
2015-04-01,4,If you're looking for pretty good Italian food, San Giuseppe is a good option.  For me, one of the best perks about this restaurant isn't even the food at all.  The fact that they offer a parking lot with free parking is pretty darn appealing if you ask me.  Another pro is the fact that it is BYOB.  So grab that bottle of wine you've been dying to crack open and head to San Giuseppe.I guess I'll get to the important stuff, the food.  After placing your order, they bring a basket of complimentary bread, which is quite tasty.  On our visit over the weekend, I decided to try the Gnocchi al Pesto.  And it did not disappoint!  The pesto was very flavorful and the sun-dried tomatoes added a nice touch to the dish.  I would definitely order that again.  The hubby had the Spaghetti al Pomodoro with Chicken.  He enjoyed his dish.  I tasted it, and while okay, it had nothing on that Gnocchi.On previous visits, we've had the Farfalle Mari e Monti, specials, and of course the pizza.  The Farfalle was okay, but I remember it being a tad on the bland side.  As for the pizza, you cannot go wrong there.  We've had both the Margherita and Quattro Formaggi.  I would recommend both of them.  The pizza crust is thin just the way I like it.Make sure to sign up for their birthday club either on their website or while dining at the restaurant.  You get a coupon to use during your birthday month for a free entree up to $16.95.  Now if that isn't incentive to try this place, I don't know what is!Make sure to save room for dessert.  The tiramisu and cheese cake are both quite good.Overall, a solid restaurant in NW Hoboken.  (And it's proximity to the movie theater can't be beat!)
2015-03-22,4,The food and service were great.  Went there for the first time and it was not what we were expecting.  Much nicer inside than I expected.  Our server was energetic and friendly, really seemed attentive but not hovering.  The coal oven gives everything a great texture and flavor - crispy on the outside, moist on the inside.  The wings are excellent (not buffalo though, even though they describe them as "spicy") and the pizza was fantastic - they do not scrimp on the toppings, including the prosciutto. Very tasty.  My only ding was that they are a wee bit pricey for what they are and do.  But that's Hoboken.
2015-03-20,4,My first time here and I had a really enjoyable dinner and experience. Pizza was very good and service was awesome! My friend and I were able to eat here in 20 minutes and catch a movie! I look forward to coming back and truly enjoying a meal instead of rushing to catch a flick!
2015-03-19,4,My family and I have been to San Giuseppe a few times and we have yet to be disappointed.  The food is very good and the service is amazing.  I grew up in Little Italy, where eating at a local restaurant was more like eating at a good friends house.  This restaurant has the same vibe.  Our server, Seven, made us feel right at home.  Some of our menu favorites are the Burrata, Romanza pizza and chicken cacciatore.  My only complaint is that it isn't open enough.
2015-03-13,3,Ordered delivery last night and thought the penne arrabiata was a bit bland and the rigatoni buena sera had a nice amount/mix of ingredients (sweet sausage, grilled chicken, red pepper, kalamata olives) but the sauce was just garlic and oil and the dish didn't really come together cohesively.  Went a while back and really liked the pizza, thought the "award winning" wings were just ok (breaded and baked wings are ok, but I like fried or grilled).  Great for pre-movies if you can get a table, but BYO means elevated food prices, so it's expensive for delivery ($13 wings, $15-19 pastas).
2015-03-08,4,We have eaten here and ordered from here a bunch of times.Great pizza...very friendly service.Top pizza in Hoboken for sure.
2015-03-03,5,The food is utterly delicious. The pizza, the pasta, even the bread. There's not a single thing on the menu that I wouldn't order. The BYOB aspect is fun too. The only slight drawback is that the restaurant is located a little off of the beaten path. That didn't stop it from filling up quickly though. I can't wait to eat here again.
2015-02-23,2,So after a long hiatus I tried again .. I'm all about giving things another chance. And the result was pretty much the same.We ordered the fig and prosciutto pie while it was tasty!! It was also lukewarm at best. I definitely don't order pizza to have to microwave it or reheat in the oven unless it for breakfast the following morning. It wasn't even a freezing cold night, the high of the day was 46 degrees and we had ordered by 8:15. If it was 5 degrees out, I could maybe give them a pass but this was NOT the case. I'm totally okay with the delivery fee but not for cold pizza, might as well walk there and work off the carbs if that's the case. Or order from somewhere else like I will next time, Napoli's always delivers hot pizzas.We also ordered a pasta dish, I didn't have any but I was told it was good but that it needed Parmesan cheese. I guess I'm confused why there was no cheese sent with the dish? It was a bolognese dish, if I was in the restaurant I certainly would have been offered parm cheese for the dish. Also no bread was sent, I've ordered plenty of meals for delivery and with pasta it's pretty customary for both cheese and bread to be sent alongside. I always feel this place is cutting corners and pinching pennies. That's okay to do in practice but it shouldn't shine through to the customer, it's not as if the food is particularly inexpensive. For the quality it's a bit more expensive than it should be, but in an appropriate range if the service and presentation were up to standard. I'm definitely done with ordering from here and can say I won't be coming in to try it in the restaurant. It's a shame because this place has potential but the consistent errors and the last time I had an issue management contacted through yelp and was more accusatory and defensive then apologetic. Not really the best customer service.I hadn't gotten around to responding to Joe, but here is the response. I ordered the caprese, I considered that a salad option and it was 13.95, also you reference your salads are from 8.95-9.95 this is clearly untrue its 8.95-10.95 if you are going to refute what I said and try to correct me, as the manager you should be familiar with your menu and have correct pricing. Additionally if you view the picture of the cheeses, there are about 9 small pcs of cheese, to me that isn't really a fair portion for the pricing. Point being Hoboken definitely has some better options, and I'd skip this place!
2015-02-15,2,They have very good pizza -much better than most places in Hoboken, Aside from that there is not much to rave about. To our surprise on Valentines Day it was a Price Fixe only Menu (no one mentioned it when the reservation was made the day before). When asked for the fig and prosciutto pizza that we order quite often we were told by the owner (*through the waiter) that they only had the ingredients that were on the price fixe menu. QUITE COMICAL considering there were 4 delivery people standing next to our table taking orders out throughout our meal. We considered just ordering delivery/to go to get what we came for but we mistakenly decided to stay for a $50 per person meal. The lasagna was reheated and a comical portion size.The creme breluee wasn't even torched and was not edible!!!  it was still in hard sugar form. Ive had no problem paying $20+ for their pizzas. Price Fixe on valentines day is always a rip off but this one certainly was the worst. Ive never felt so ripped off at a restaurant before - price fixe or otherwise.As regular customers we are extremely disappointed. If the owner so chooses to lie to his customers it would have been nice for him to come tell us himself. We won't be coming in again - even after sending plenty of business their way.
2015-01-31,5,We love this neighborhood spot.  Great Byob with nice staff and amazing food. Love the la Romanza pie, classic margarita and the quarto stagioni and the mezzaluna. We ventured to try some entres and loved the gnocchi pesto, shrimp parm and the pasta bouna sera. The owners and staff are very attentive and nice and it's fun to watch the pizzas being made. Don't forget to get a nutella and strawberry dessert. Worth the calories
2015-01-25,2,Came here on a Sunday night - the restaurant had parking out front which was a plus. Food was pretty good but pricey for what you get. After we got seated, it took the waiter 15 minutes to get us menus. 45 minutes after ordering we still had not gotten any of the food we ordered including the appetizer (the restaurant was not busy). We really just felt like we were forgotten about and were second class citizens. All in all the food was good but poor service will not draw me back.
2015-01-12,4,Had a bad experience with their takeout. Much better off sticking to dine in with this spot - get your takeout elsewhere.
2014-12-27,4,Good place with good food. BYO helps because the place isn't exactly cheap. However, you get what you pay for. Service is good
2014-12-12,3,i want to give this place a better rating but I can't.  I was there last Saturday night with my fiance and another couple.  I had made a reservation for 9:30pm.  When we arrived we were told it would be 15 minutes before we could sit, even with the res.  It ended up being 20 but what was ridiculous is that multiple tables had left and no one was clearing them or seating patrons.  At one point there were many tables open and 8 people waiting!  It was ridiculous.  Everyone was crowded around the computer in the back, including the hostess, and only the chef (assuming owner) came out and starting clearing wine glasses and plates.  Once we were finally seated, the waitress did apologize for the delay.  It's BYOB which I do love.  We ordered the wings with caramelized onions and I highly recommend them.  Very flavorful and the onions add a nice touch.  My fiance and I split a pizza, mine half with vegetables and his with sausage.  The pizza was good but one other thing I disliked is that the pizza was cut into 6 slices but 2 of them were part veg, part sausage.  They didn't slice the pizza in line with the toppings which was annoying.The other couple ordered bruschetta which was served on pita bread.  It looked odd but was apparently good.  They also ordered the white pizza with arugula and prosciutto which looked good.  Overall it was a just-average experience.  I have been here before when the service was decent but there are enough pizza places in Hoboken that I don't think I'd come back.
2014-11-26,2,Food is delicious but every single time we go the ambiance is awkward and the staff is mediocre at best- which is the main reason for the low review.  I would only order delivery from here going forward.
2014-11-26,4,I have eaten at the restaurant three times, picked up a to-go order twice, and gotten delivery once.First off, the ambience of the restaurant is great. I love the decor- it is cozy yet very well-decorated in an elegant fashion. I love the open view of the coal oven.As for the food, I have two things that are my regular go-tos and are consistently AMAZING: the coal-fired chicken wings, and the Prosciutto di Parma & Figs (or dates, if figs are not in season). Seriously, I have not yet been disappointed by either of these orders. I strayed once and my party ordered 2 different pasta dishes- I was disappointed and would not order pasta from here again.I am taking off a star due to the customer service. The first time I came here, we waited for a few minutes to be acknowledged even though the restaurant had just opened for the day, and there were multiple employees running around and no other customers there yet. The hostess finally addressed us, but it was like she wasn't having a good day- she didn't smile and seemed annoyed to be there. The entire time that we were there, I don't think I saw her smile or look remotely happy once.One of the times I ordered to go, I called ahead and got my usual (coal-fired chicken wings, and the Prosciutto di Parma & Figs (or dates, if figs are not in season). The time before, San Giuseppe was using dates on the pizza (not complaining-love them with this pizza). As I was on the phone with the hostess, I asked her if they were using dates or figs on that particular day. She said figs. When I picked up my order, it was the same girl as in the before mentioned description, but she was a little friendlier. When I got home, there were dates on the pizza. Again, I love the dates, but she clearly had no idea how to answer me on the phone and just gave me an answer for the sake of giving me an answer.BTW, the parking lot is a huge plus!!!! and it's BYOB!
2014-11-23,5,Best pizza in Hoboken. It's a little pricey but the pizza always hits the spot. Quattro stagioni is awesome. My kids love the margarita with pepperoni. I also really like the arugula salad.
2014-11-23,2,I've gotten delivery twice from here and feel it's not worth it.  Delivery always takes a little over an hour and food arrives cold or only slightly warm so it's cold by the time I put it on a plate and start eating.  The flavors in the pizzas are interesting but the quality of the food is really dimished since it's cold and not fresh tasting by the time it's delivered.
2014-11-16,5,My boyfriend and I go to this restaurant often, due to the convenience of a parking lot, BYOB and amazing food and atmosphere. I highly recommend this restaurant whether for an intimate date night or a dinner before/after the movie theater nearby. 5 stars!
2014-11-15,1,Food and service were below average. I would not recommend it. The pizza and pasta dishes had no flavor. They also rushed us out because it was apparent that they wanted to seat another table after us..not worth going to..
2014-11-12,3,Here's a one-line summary of my two visits to San Giuseppe: Excellently fresh crispy pizzas. Erratic service. One one occasion when we went in for lunch we are disappointed with the disinterested service and average pastas. Our waitress looked bored and conveyed the same vibe....water glasses weren't filled...the bread basket never appeared...the Gnocchi in pesto sauce arrived cold. It was all very disconcerting.The second visit was much more successful. We started with a shrimp appetizer that was on the special menu and it was really good - very fresh with great tangy flavor.We ordered the white pizza with arugula (no meat) and it was excellent. Crispy, melt in your mouth cheese, just perfect. The service was efficient.
2014-11-09,4,Hand tossed artisan style brick oven pizza Mmmmmmm pizzaThe melty saucy cheesy deliciousness is worth the trip.  This place boast and impressive menu of homemade pasta dishes and sauce like Mama makes on Sunday. Plus it's a byob. Tip: Sign up on their website and order online for a discount.
2014-11-01,4,We went there on a hungry Halloween night and indeed hoped to get something solid. Ordered pizza as suggested,   in my opnion definitely a must try, yet probably wanna add extra toppings on it and probably wanna get the second one if more than three people. Their dessert was cute as well! Overall a very nice experience, even for their appitizer salad!
2014-10-28,3,Food was ok. Had better gnocchi. Waitress asked if we wanted chicken or shrimp in our pasta. She never said anything about an up charge for that. Bill came and was higher than expected. They should make you aware of an additional charge when asking which meat you want to add. She made like it was standard.
2014-10-07,3,The prosciutto and fig pizza is amazing - the gnocchi and pesto is a little hard but I had it delivered so maybe that's why. The first time I ordered here I asked if they took cards and the girl said cash only yet I've been able to pay with a card so I guess she just thought that would be easier for her.  Not a fan of that.The pesto pizza is great here too!
2014-09-21,1,It took an hour to get here. It was cold. Ordered a large, pizza were freaking TINY. $26. Never ordering from here again. Terrible. Just terrible.
2014-09-16,5,The pizza here is to die for! The crust is thin and crispy and baked in a brick oven.  The tomato sauce is earthy and the mozzarella was  fresh and salty.  The fresh basil was a great touch.  The sausage was spicy Italian sausage. The tricolor salad and dressing was tangy and fresh. Enjoyed the sparkling water, the ambiance, and all of this great service.  It was surprising because we arrived as the restaurant was closing.Forgot about the BYOB.  We have to keep going so they can afford a liquor license.  My partner missed a good glass of wine.So happy for parking in Hoboken.  A movie at the Bow-tie cinema and a smashing italian pizza was a perfect date night.
2014-08-22,4,We had a delicious dinner here last night. Three of us sat outside and ordered a goat cheese and Beet salad and a veggie pizza. Both were fantasic. I loved the thin crust and the freshness of the vegetables. The garlic breadsticks they give you when you sit down are amazing too. The service was great and the entire bill came to $8 after a $30 groupon. It's a byo too! I can't wait to go back.
2014-08-14,3,3.5 stars, 0.5 for being BYOB.Location-wise it is definitely off the beaten path in terms of restaurants in Hoboken. It's in a building of 3 or 4 store fronts, almost like a mini strip-mall feel across the street from the Hoboken Movie Theatre. The plus of this location is that there is a parking lot if you don't feel like walking all the way to 14th street. I also think it's a plus because it's a little hidden, and therefore I never have to wait for a table ;)I've been to San Giuseppe's before and had a pleasant experience. However, you have to know what to order otherwise you might not have the same luck....What makes San Giuseppe's special is their coal fueled brick (assuming?) oven. Therefore, when you go make sure you order a coal-fired pizza, or the coal-fired wings or something that's cooked in said oven. The pasta entrees are rather over-priced and underwhelming. Their salads are fresh and satisfying, but not mind-blowing.My boyfriend and I came here for a date night (with a Groupon for $15 for $30 worth of food...in this case a TOTAL steal.) We arrived at 7:30PM on a Tuesday night. There were 3 out of 20 or so tables occupied: one table of two or three two tops pushed together to accommodate a family with small children, another table of 4 of adults, and a 2 top with a 20-something couple. We were seated at an awkward corner table by the window, but since there were so many other two-tops available I moved to another 5 ft. away in a more central location (not face-level next to the restaurants light switches and security system panel). As we sat down we were greeted with two servers, the one who's table we declined, and the one who's table we were sitting at. The young man who's table we moved from was obviously not happy that we had moved, and made some sarcastic remarks about not wanting to be served by him which got the night off to an awkward start because I honestly couldn't tell if he was joking or not.Luckily, our server was much more pleasant and made up for the other's unprofessional remarks. She was very sweet and knowledgeable of the menu. We ended up ordering the coal-fired wings ($13.95 for 10) and a large Margherita pie (14.50). The wings were delicious. Baked in the coal-fired oven, they had a spicy rustic flavor and were topped with delicious but not overwhelming caramelized onions. The wings were definitely not too oily and were NOT coated with anything (such as flour) before baking (according to our waitress) as other reviews have claimed. The pizza was great as well. The crust was thinner than the average "brick oven" slice, but wasn't cracker-thin. The sauce was rich and the cheese was very fresh. We finished the whole pie!In the middle of our meal the two tops next to us were seated and we ended up having to talk loudly over two other conversations in order to hear each other, which was annoying considering how many other open tables their were in the restaurant.Since we had the Groupon, we ended up tipping the waitress 50% of the original bill because she really was extremely helpful and pleasant. I will definitely be going back as long as the weather is nice enough to walk the 26 minutes to get to 14th street from my apartment on 1st. TIPS TO THE OWNER/MANAGER: The two 2 tops in the corners of the two windows of the restaurant need to go. No one wants to be sitting at eye level with light switches in their face. Either put ONE two-top centered against each window, so both guests can face each other and see outside or try putting a 4 top in each space. It's not fair for the servers who have that section.
2014-08-03,3,Came back to try those award winning wings. Don't get me wrong- they are good,handmade, with a little bit of flour dusting for some crisp, but then became totally mushy because of the plethora of sweet onion shavings they put on top. In fairness I got this to go, so that could definitely be a factor. I also had the Romeo and Juliet dessert pizza which had a fantastic combination of ingredients- delicious ricotta, amaretto, chocolate shavings, pistachio and cherries. The pizza gets a 3.5 star only because the dough was so so hard and chewy. I think I would bypass this to try another sweet pizza, and the Burrata, which I still need to try.
2014-08-03,5,The MOST Delicious pizza I've ever eaten! and I am not a guy who would say this lightly.I was astonished by how delicious this pizza is, although it was a delivery but the pizza was so hot that I couldn't touch it at first! I really recommend getting your next pizza from there.
2014-07-21,4,San Giuseppe is a great Italian / upscale brick oven pizza place in Uptown Hoboken.  It has a nice intimate vibe which is why it is not great for large groups or kids.  The wings are my favorite in Hoboken, and the pizza is really good.  It is BYOB so be sure to bring your drink of choice.  We enjoy eating here very much as the food is outstanding.  I didn't give full stars because the seating can be very close together.
2014-06-27,4,I consider this 3.5 stars and rounding up for interior/service/parking. The restaurant is very pleasant inside, tastefully decorated and comfortable seating. The wait staff is polite and attentive. There is a small parking lot. Recently, dinner for two included the burrata appetizer which was very good, and it was supplemented with fresh bread upon request (more like pizza dough triangles).  We ordered two pasta dishes. The pesto pasta was just ok but not memorable. I asked for a side of Pecorino Romano, and was brought something that looked/tasted more like a lifeless Parmesan. The other pasta choice was a Rigatoni with sausage and chicken.  Decent, preferable to the pesto.San Giuseppe also makes brick oven pizza which is tasty and what I would lean towards ordering in the future.  BYOB.
2014-06-12,5,We were staying in the Lincoln Harbor area while visiting New York and we were looking for pizza. To be honest, my main reason for choosing this restaurant over the other places with good Yelp reviews was the fact that it had parking. I'm so glad that I did! Our meal was fantastic!! We had the coal fired wings and a pizza. Both were excellent! There was a party of 20 in the restaurant when we arrived so I was concerned about the service, but Urszula was wonderful. We were in and out in less than an hour. Great way to end our hectic day in the city!
2014-05-22,1,So so so disappointed that I have to write this review to downgrade my previous rating, but I think Sunday night, I visited San Guiseppe for my final time after the experience.  The issues with service have been ongoing for a very long time and even though the food is mostly awesome, this continual service problem is just too hard to ignore. I've been to the restaurant around 20 times, and while the food is always amazing and the service is almost always disappointing, I continue to return because of the food quality.  Tonight, however, was the final straw after the worst service experience while going here, and the food was off a little as well.  After arriving, we were sat at a table with menus and we didn't even have anyone come over for a good 10 minutes until one of the waiters came over and said that our waiter would be over shortly.  She (the person who wasn't our waiter) took our drink order of 2 diet cokes and appetizer of coal fired chicken wings.  When our server finally came over about 10 minutes later, we gave him the order and asked for bread.  The first server then came back with cokes instead of diet cokes.  I didn't think it was a big deal but was hoping it wasn't a precursor of things to come, which it actually turned out to be.  Fifteen or so minutes later he (the actual waiter) came over with the bread, but only after I asked his co-worker server if she could please ask him for us.  Once that came, I figured our wings would be along for the appetizer any minute.  However, one of our dinners came out instead before the wing appetizer.  Normally we would send it back but didn't want to take a chance it would sit around since it was grilled chicken on top of a salad. Then eventually the wings came (which were actually a little dried out this night, which I've never experienced here), and shortly afterward the final meal.  The sauce on this nice in the main meal was also a little off and not the same quality as I'm used to.The server asks me, if I would like more bread to which I replied "yes."  So after this the guy never came back to the table to bring my bread, ask if we wanted more to drink, or even check in.  I had to literally walk up to the counter and find him and ask him to bring our check.  Then it was his co-worker and not even him who came to the table to wrap the leftover food and bring us our check.  Then it was also his co-worker who came to the table to take my payment and bring me back my receipt to sign.  Then this guy comes over near the table to stand nearby watching as if he's just waiting for me to fill out the receipt.  I waited until he left though because I was giving a very small tip.As a former waiter myself, I understand what it takes to wait table and give good service.  Knowing this, I often give $20 even on a $50 check.  But definitely not on this night!  The guy came to the table hardly at all and never checked back, and I had to track him down.  His co-worker helped us much much more than he did.  I would understand if the restaurant was busy, but there were 4 tables in the place w/customers - there was hardly anyone there yet.  And, the times he did come to the table, he was trying to be all cheery and joke around, as if he could sense we were unhappy.  Just better service would have done the trick instead of trying to pry a smile out of us by staring us down and continuing to try joking around.  It was actually a little creepy.Very very frustrated, I am, about this place.  I want to love it because of the food but just can't!  Now I know the owner will message me back here on Yelp and tell me they are always at the restaurant to speak to if there are issues, or they may ask me to call them.  The truth is though, until someone has better oversight over the waitstaff, nothing I can say to them will help the situation.  =(
2014-04-23,4,The wings are to die for!! They are made in the wood burning oven! They are honestly one of my favorite wings! I ordered the salmon which was cooked perfectly. The mashed potatoes were not good, however! They were totally instant mashed potatoes! I want to go back and have the linguini in white clam sauce. I've heard it's good. Will try this place again and let you guys know!
2014-04-16,4,Went here a while ago and really liked it. Very tasty, light and fresh pizza. Service was great too.
2014-04-05,4,San gieseppe brings me back to Sunday dinners with my fam. The Italian style chicken wings are original yet remind me of my own family recipes. pizza is very good and pastas are traditional in preparation which is a rarity in hoboken. Most places in hoboken lose their Italian flare as they end up hiring non Italian cooks. The only things I would like to see is delivery fri and sat and a couple of chicken/meat dishes on the menu.
2014-03-21,3,Amazing prosciutto pizza. Good bread, decent gnocchi, decor is rustic italian, awkward when you walk in no hostess, you have to find the hostess in the back of restaurant while she is busy with phone calls, and online orders. Not very busy and had to wait 10 min for a table (3 were empty)Waiter was friendly but you can tell he we preoccupied and couldn't multi task. Will order delivery next time.
2014-03-14,2,Great pizza, just don't trust online ordering.   We selected the first available order time - 1 hour.  An hour and ten minutes later I called to follow up.  They JUST got the order and would deliver in 30-40 minutes.  It's been 100 minutes since I ordered and counting, still starving.
2014-03-05,3,The pros:-great food- I'd recommend everything we ordered- burrata, wings, cheese plate. Margherita and L'italia pizza. Who would think of using butternut squash pureÃÅe instead of sauce? Perfect! The only thing I'd pass on was the Sugo Delle Nonna since the penne was boring and there were some tough chunks of meat in the sauce.  -byob!-parking!!-takes reservations on a Friday night!!!The cons:-they are unprepared for the volume on weekend nights. We had to wait for wine glasses because they didn't have enough. We were seated in a corner and we didn't have a server assigned to us until someone walked by and saw us sitting there. Once we got a waiter he was very friendly and personable. Would return on an odd night or maybe try takeout.
2014-03-03,3,I finally made it here on a night that wasn't packed to the gills. Well, I was disappointed in the pizza. It seemed to have no seasoning (the expected hints of garlic, basil, oregano, etc). So the flavor was pretty boring. The mozz. cheese had a nice flavor and texture, however, and the atmosphere and service were nice, so I'd be willing to give it another chance. That said, I probably won't for several reasons. It's more expensive than some of the other wood-fired pizza places, and it's way to hell and gone on 13th street and Grand (or maybe Adams?).
2014-02-25,2,Decided to give it a try. Expensive and disappointing. I've only had it once so I could try it again but for the price paid id say screw it - Better off going to napolis.
2014-02-23,5,Delicious pizza and it's byo! Also, if you forget your wine you can place an order to have your wine delivered to your table! Our server was Justin and he did a fabulous job.
2014-02-22,5,One of our favorite restaurants in Hoboken.  The Margarita Pizza is the best pizza we had in the area and is the only pizza we ever take leftovers home and eat the next day. Definitely recommend to take your date here it has very romantic ambience. One more thing, you HAVE TO get the tiramisu!! It's amazing!
2014-02-08,5,First time there last night and it was delicious! The place is quaint and seemed very clean. We made a reservation and were seated promptly.Visiting family in Hoboken, went  based on a reliable suggestion. To convince a Staten Islander to agree upon a good pizza review out of New York is not an easy task but this place stands up to the best of them. We ordered two different salads, wings and three different pies without one complaint. We will definitely go again. The date (fig not in season), prosciutto, and  goat cheese pizza was my personal favorite. Sweet, tender, and tangy all atop a very thin coal fired crust that snapped with every yummy bite.
2014-01-31,4,The servers and staff were extremely nice.  The parking lot and atmosphere makes it feel like you aren't in Hoboken.  It's a welcome treat to go to a BYOB in town and not be pushed out.  The open kitchen is very nice; you can even see the coals burning in the over if you are looking from the right angle.  Parking is a huge plus for out of towners.  I was definitely well fed with leftovers to boot.  Highly recommended.&
2014-01-10,5,Really amazing Margherita pizza. Great, chewy crust, fresh mozz, fresh basil. Could probably eat a whole large myself. Had it delivered via seamless, so it probably wasn't as warm or delicious as at the restaurant.
2013-12-11,4,I'd like to give this place 4.5 stars if I could. I was first here around Valentine's Day, but that was before I gave a crap about my Yelp account, so I'm writing about my more recent experience instead.I went here with my boyfriend and his mom for a Sunday evening dinner right before Thanksgiving (11/24) after we escaped from the madness of Elizabeth's IKEA. We got there a little after 5 PM and were surprised to see it was completely empty inside. (Later, we realized why: the restaurant opened at 5). Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, and brought us fresh bread immediately. I loved the texture of the bread: warm and crisp on the outside but mealy on the inside. For an appetizer, I ordered their arugula salad with mozzarella and grape tomatoes with a balsamic/olive oil dressing. I tore through it in minutes, mostly because I was hungry (shopping at IKEA is serious business, y'all), but also because it was extremely tasty. The mozzarella was soft but not mushy, with a sweet flavor, and the arugula was a vibrant shade of green with a tangy aftertaste.For our main courses, my boyfriend ordered the gnocchi pesto, his mom ordered penne alla vodka  (minus the prosciutto, because she's not a fan of ham), and I ordered the spaghetti al pomodoro with tomato and basil. It didn't take long for our meals to come out. (Again, maybe it's because we were the only ones in the place, but I'm not complaining). Our waiter made sure our water glasses were refilled, and he stopped by to check on us at strategic moments during our meals. (Meaning, he came to see how we were doing when our mouths weren't full or in the midst of swallowing water). I get annoyed at waiters who ask you how the food is when you're shoving a forkful of stuff into your mouth. This guy knew better.I can't speak for my boyfriend or his mom, but my dinner was fabulous. The sauce was served rustic-style (which I love), and the basil was a nice touch. It didn't overpower the flavor of the dish, but it added an undercurrent of fresh herbal zest to the sauce.I didn't think I was hungry for dessert, but it turned out I was. I decided to get the tiramisu and split it with my boyfriend's mom, while he tried the profitteroles (sic?).  The tiramisu was deceptively light and very good. I didn't ask, but I have a feeling it was from a homemade recipe. Also, I'm not usually a fan of profitteroles, as they're usually too lardy or hard, with way too much cream inside. But these were soft, light on the stomach, and with just the right amount of cream. They were also drizzled with chocolate sauce, which was a plus.So, if I really enjoyed myself at this place, why am I giving it four stars? It was chilly inside, and they sat us near the door, where the delivery guy kept running in and out. Oh well. I'll definitely be back for another delicious Italian dinner.
2013-12-10,5,I have eaten here 4-5 times now and feel confident saying this is the best pizza in Hoboken. All of their pizzas are excellent but the biggest standout for me is the Prosciutto and Date (or Fig if in season) pizza. I would also highly recommend the coal fired wings, they are crispy, perfectly seasoned and sauteed with caramelized onions.If you are looking for great pizza and wings I would highly recommend San Giuseppe. FYI it's a BYOB.
2013-11-28,5,My boyfriend, friends and I love this place! The ambience is perfect.  The service is good and the food is the BEST in Hoboken. It has unique flavors of pizza that will leave you dreaming for more in the middle of the night. The wings with the caramelized onions are outstanding! It's also BYOB so who could ask for anything more!?! A hidden gem in the back corner of town! Hit it up!!!!!
2013-10-23,3,Stars for the food! I'd say one of the best that I've ever had. Service is spotty AND SLOW.
2013-10-12,3,Parking is a plus.  Their location is bit away from the center of Hoboken so driving is a must.  It was an impromptu decision so we didn't have reservation.   I worked late and thought around 8.45pm on Friday we would be able to get a table relatively easy.  We called and they say it is a 20-25 minutes wait.  It's the kind of place where you eat and linger... And tables will be available for about 5 minutes before they seat people.  All this while we are watching about 5 parties got seated.  Finally it's our turn and again they had to wait I don't know for what and finally after about 5 minutes, she asked if we want to sit there.  ???  Seriously.I was so ready for my wine at that point.  And then our waiter came by to tell us and they ran out of wine glasses!! And told us to use champagne glasses.  Ok whatever.  Another 10 minutes passed, I'm drinking my wine in an empty stomach and finally someone gave us out menus.  I do enjoy the complimentary warm bread they serve.Food is decent, not mind blowing.  We got the chicken wings, pasta with vodka sauce and Sierra pasta.  Nothing too special.  Maybe we should have ordered pizza but I didn't feel like paying around $20 for pizza.And at the end, they didn't offer us dessert either.  Just felt we were second class citizens.  Maybe because we didn't have reservation or something.  Not sure.  Oh well.
2013-10-08,4,This pizza is legit.  Good crust and everything from your old school pizza to pizza with figs prosciutto and mutz.  I even enjoyed the shrimp fra diavolo which I was nervous ordering from a pizza place but that's was scrum too!  This place is my standby so far. Only drawback is they don't have gluten free...
2013-10-07,5,Outta this world.Ok, I ordered this pizza with figs, goat cheese and prosciutto.   Amazingly, it was so delicious.  The place is gorgeous too,  for a date or out with friends,  or whatever. And, the owner, Joe, walks around and makes sure that everything is good. And that, I love!I  wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone in the area!
2013-10-02,4,The wings are awesome. They are a must try. The pizzas are also good. Have had a few specials.  The regular items on the menu are surprisingly bland.
2013-09-26,5,First visit to San Giuseppes and we were impressed for sure! Low-key, relaxing vibe, contemporary decor with high ceilings, open counter with coal oven. Brought our own wine. Plenty of parking. My GPS led to the address which was not the entrance to the restaurant. You have to go past the address and make a left into the strip-mall. Now, on to the food. We had to try the wings, being that there was a trophy there and all. These are not hot wings; they are crispy, dry-rubbed wings covered in sauteed onions. I couldn't figure out how you're supposed to hold the wings and balance the onions on them, but believe me, you find a way. So good!My husband and I shared a margherita pie with prosciutto and hot cherry peppers. Very highly recommend. It was covered in thin slices of prosciutto and those spicy peppers were so sweet and delicious, they made the pizza. We saved room for a dessert pizza which had shaved apples, walnuts, brown sugar and vanilla icing drizzled over it. It really was so delicious.Our server, Nicole, was the best. She had great recommendations, she was professional, and she also was a very nice person. Nicole really wanted us to enjoy our time there. A true asset to the restaurant. The owner, Joe, came by to say hello and make sure all was well. A nice touch.Wish I lived in Hoboken so I could go back often. It would be one of my go-to places.
2013-09-22,4,Great pizza! We had a 14" w/ pepperoni and cherry pepper. The crust was nice and crispy. Just the right amount of cheese. Also had the spinach and arugula salads which were tasty, although the portions were small. We were there on a Sunday night and most of the folks there were older or families. Decor is pretty sterile - formulaic italian but without the personailty. Tab was $38 before tax/tip.
2013-09-09,5,After my second consecutive excellent meal at San Giuseppe, I feel confident saying that this is unquestionably the best pizza in Hoboken.Most recently, two friends and I hadthe prosciutto and date pizza.  It was truly phenomenal -  well cooked with top-notch ingredients (the goat cheese really takes it over the top).  We also shared a pepperoni and sausage pie which was just as good.Incredibly, as good as the pizza is here, the real star may be the coal fired wings.  They are served with excellent caramelized onions and will leave you wondering how you ever even enjoyed deep fried wings.  Also, the service is excellent.  A gentleman who I assume is the owner came out to ask how everything was.  This was a very nice touch which we really appreciated.I will definitely be back.
2013-08-19,4,I just wanted to provide an update on my most previous review. We finally decided to go back and give San Giuseppe's another try and I am glad we did!  The service was great as was the food.  If I had to find something to complain about, it would be that my pizza was a bit over cooked, but honestly our experience there was wonderful this time around!
2013-08-11,4,Very fresh ingredients.  I ordered delivery online and it came pretty fast, even on a Friday night.  Definitely a good bet for pizza in Hoboken.
2013-08-10,3,Finally checked this place out two weeks ago. Penne vodka is excellent. Need to go back to try the pizza. But will pass on the antipasto again as it was an odd combo/ overpriced for what was served.
2013-07-25,4,Note to self: Do not wait until the last day to redeem Livingsocial/Groupon vouchers.This is really a 3.5. rating based on the experience we had last night. The restaurant was pretty busy since it was the last day for redeeming the Livingsocial deal. We were able to get reservations, though had to wait for 10 min to be seated after we arrivedWhat bummed us out was the 10-15 min wait after we were seated. No one came in with water or the menu. The waitstaff walked by a couple of times without noticing, in the end I had to get their attention and ask for the menu. There also seemed to be some conflict going on between the hostess and the waitstaff. It was a little awkward to in the midst of that. Little disappointed by the service.Other than that, no complaints on the food. We had the pasta for the entree and it was good. The cannoli we ordered for dessert was yummy. Their pizzas looked really tempting. I definitely want to try the pizzas the next time. The food's a little pricy though.Other pluses - free parking and BYOB!
2013-07-17,4,After being lured here by a living social coupon, I really have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. This place is by far the classiest pizza / Italian place in Hoboken, especially compared to Dozzinos or Grimaldi's. you can actually have a conversation here too, if you are into that kinda thing. The place is BYOB, but be prepared, the nearest place to get liquor is the Shoprite, however, they do have a large liquor menu from Augies, which will deliver to the restaurant. They start you off with some delicious flatbread with cheese, oil, butter, and herbs. Really nice. We went with the wings and Tuscan salad to start. The wings are truly unique with the dry rub and smothered with caramelized onions. Can't say I've seen that before. As far as the wings go, they are good and worth trying, but I'm not sure I'd order them again. The salad was a bit different with the chickpeas, but let's keep things in perspective here; it's a salad. For our pizza, we went for the L'Italiana, which has fontina, butternut squash pureÃÅe, mushrooms, and truffle oil. This is a hearty and hefty pizza. The flavors were nice, but we were hoping it would be like all the other pizzas we saw that were super thin and light looking. If you order this, expect to take home leftovers. Near the end of the meal, the man who was cooking the pizzas, who I have to assume is either the head chef, owner, or both, came around to every single table to ask how everything was. This type of attention and reaching out to customers is worth so much to a business, and speaks so much as to the type of place it is. I really commend him for this, and hope he keeps it up as a regular habit. All customers appreciate this. We will be back, but next time we will go for a lighter pizza, and be sure to grab our drinks well before we get near the restaurant.
2013-07-15,5,Best pizza I have had in both hoboken and NYC. Very authentic italian style pizza.
2013-07-11,5,I use to be the assistance chef at san guiseppes untill i had to move and I love this place!. Joe and maria are the owner's. The fact that they come out to ask if the food is good, is a plus for me. Shows that they care about the customers experience. Most places, you wont even know the owners name let alone what they look like. It made me realize the value of service. And from the view of someone behind the scene.  Let me tell you that freshness, cleanliness and quality is a must when working there. I saw some reviews about the service and yes some servers mite be haveing a bad day but thats because the pressure of san guiseppes standards are high. If something aint right then you throw it away and make it right, and fresh at that. Some servers just cant cut it. Its nice to work at a place you love to eat.I even had my moms birthday there and it was special to me to offer a 5 star experience.  Till this day my friends still go there and continue to love it.  Pies to try: Something sweet and good: prosciutto parma de figsSomething for filling: quattro stagioniAnd also try there desert pie. Its a 10 in fluffy pie glazed with Nutella, strawberries and a sprinkle of powder sugar.  Yumm.
2013-07-09,4,The food was very good, we had a pizza with goat cheese and figs as well as pasta with lobster.   We would definitely come back for the food.We had a 9:30 reservation on a Saturday, their site stated it closed at 11PM.  We showed up on time, there were a few people dining still.  The food came within 15 minutes of ordering, and as we were eating around 10pm, the waiter brought our check and took things to wrap, while we were still eating.  We left at 10:25, they were already cleaning up the place.  It seems a bit rude to rush a group out when they are finishing their meal and the place is still open for another half hour.
2013-07-03,5,I gave San Giuseppe 5 stars for the simple reason that Yelp doesn't allow 6 stars.    Everything about this place is quality, most notably the staff and the food.   It's BYOB and no corking fee, in fact, we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table, and a waiter actually came outside with two wine glasses and uncorked our bottle for us while we waited!  Bless this restaurant and all the good people who work there!
2013-06-25,4,In my humble opinion, San Giuseppe is tied with Johnny Pepperoni for best pizza in Hoboken.  Ingredients were super fresh and nothing beats the flavor of coal fired brick oven pizza.  We had a large pie with roasted garlic and prosciutto.  They were really generous with the toppings, which is refreshing.Try the dry rub coal fired wings for appetizer.  Compared to regular hot wings, they're a bit dry, but a tasty change of pace.  The restaurant is brand new, so it's clean and very well decorated inside.  The service was very good, but like any new restaurant, they still have some kinks to work out.  Great place to have dinner before heading to the movies.  I'm looking forward to coming back soon!
2013-06-24,3,Our dinner at San Giuseppe was pretty good, and I'd say kick it up a star for sure if you live in uptown Hoboken, for the convenience factor.As you've read, the pluses of San Giuseppe are BYO (and they do have a liquor store that will deliver, which is pretty cool) and free parking.  The pizza was pretty tasty, though I like a little thinner crust, but that's a personal preference.  I did not like my gnocchi with pesto...something just tasted off in the pesto, though I couldn't put my finger on it, and the gnocchi was pretty hard (I like them like little mushy fluffy pillows).  The pasta arrabiata that my bf had was bowl-licking good, though.PS - Keep an eye out for deals, as I've seen SG participate in Living Social and Amazon Local.
2013-06-22,5,My family loved this spot in Hoboken. They enjoyed the vibe,  the food was delicious, the server was excellent and it was BYOB. We enjoyed our meal and the entire evening there.
2013-05-23,5,San Giuseppe, how I love thee. I"ve been teetering between 4 and 5 stars on this place and I've finally decided to give San G some five star love and here's why. Food = 4 stars.Value = 4 starsParking = 5 starsBYO = 5 starsWhat brings this bad boy up to five from 4.5 is the chef/owner who comes out to to thank his guests for eating and truly cares about his customers, the food and the community.Lets chat about the pros:1. Free parking in Hoboken. Yes, it's true.2. BYOB3. The food is fantastic. Very simple, light and amazing. I've sampled the pastas and the pizza. I find the pizza to be absolutely amazing. The eggplant puree and the prosciutto with figs have been my favorite but with this thin crust pizza, you can't go wrong. The gnocchi is amazing and the buena serra with chicken, sausage and a balsamic sauce rather than the tomato is out of this world. 4. Service is good. So friendly and amicable. The food does take a while to come out but, everything is served completely freshly made so, pizza takes awhile, I get it.5. Ambiance is nice. Far from trendy but similar to the food, it's authentic. Cons:1. I can say price/portion size may be a bit off. My one minor complaint was that the salad was pretty tiny for the price. It was filled with fresh parmagiana, olives and white beans but, not a lot of greens itself. I think that was my only disappointment with the meal. With both the pasta and pizza dishes, you can taste the quality ingredients. I also think I'm used to Jersey City prices which clearly, it's just cheaper. Overall, San Guiseppe's the perfect place for a carb loaded night out when you're looking for great eats, Go.
2013-05-14,5,Great pizza. Thin crust. Can't wait to return and try the dinners. Parking too!!!!!
2013-04-27,4,We had a group of friends together for a birthday dinner at San Giuseppe.  We ordered numerous appetizers, entrees and pizza - everything was delicious.  From the fresh bread, to the great service, we were very satisfied.Don't forget to BYOB!
2013-04-22,4,We've since been back and tried a few of their other pizza's and ALL were simply amazing! We must have just hit  a bad day our first time here, but we came back to try and again and are in love! Well done San Giuseppe! Keep making that delicious goat cheese and fig pizza....I'm hooked!
2013-03-18,4,I would give this place a 3.8... First of all, there is a parking lot which is very rare in Hoboken and it is BYO.. Those two things alone make it a place to go to in Hoboken. The ambience is very cozy and romantic. The waitress was super sweet, attentive, and also gave us our space. For an appetizer, we got the mozzarella with tomatoes- it was good,but the mozz didnt seem fresh. The bread was also not very fresh. However, the margherita pizza was really yummy! I really enjoyed the pizza. For dessert, we ordered tiramisu and cheesecake. I thought the tiramisu was pretty good- I would get it again, and the cheesecake was just ok. Overall, I had a good dining experience here and i would come again!
2013-03-16,4,A place I would for sure finding again once I drive by Jersey... My first time imprinted a good impression.. The owner Aka Chef.. Is excellent! Thanks.. I had a pix with you together during YELPS last event.
2013-03-13,4,Great wings, parking and the food was good.  I like the decor and it helps that it's a BYOB
2013-03-12,5,This place is a hidden GEM.  It's in a new "strip-mall-ish" building next to the Hoboken movie theatre.  It's BYOB, which is a plus.  It's got a dedicated parking lot RIGHT OUTSIDE the restaurant, which is outrageous in Hoboken.  The owner, Joe, is the nicest business owner that I've ever met.  He's straight from Sicily, and you can tell, based on the quality of the food.  Joe's right hand man on the pizza line, Lou, was awesome as well.  Everything I tried here was 5-star delicious.  The olives were great.  The cheese/meat/grape plate was great.  The homemade focaccia bread was great.  The coal fired pizza was great.  The pasta was great.  The chicken was great.  The sausage was great.  The pesto gnocchi may have been the best gnocci that I've ever had in my life.  The little meatballs were solid.  The cannolis and the tiramisu were f'ing extraordinary (and homemade as well).  If you live in NW Hoboken, or if you ever go to the Hoboken movie theatre, you MUST go here!  Even if you're out of town, it's worth it.
2013-03-11,4,I've been back to San Giuseppe's a few times now and it remands a solid restaurant and has improved greatly since my first few visits.
2013-03-09,1,The service is this joint's main problem--but not its only one. Going there on a Saturday night? Make other plans. This place can only operate at a solid level when there's another table or two occupied--try Thursday. It seemed as if everyone on staff was working their first shift of their first day. The women who are in charge of hosting should be asked to find employment elsewhere, preferably a horse stable. They are completely clueless and have the social niceties of junkyard scavengers. Have little kids? Hope they don't mind waiting till they're ready for college  to get their first course. And speaking of the food: Hoboken has enough good to excellent Italian restaurants that coming here is not worth the hassle. The pasta dishes are overcooked and mediocre while the pizza is obviously the place's main bread and butter. They should have stuck with just pizza--but why you would go there instead of a place like uptown pizza or whatever your favorite place is--aside from convenience to the Movies-is a mystery to me.
2013-03-04,4,What a great find! Came  here to celebrate my mom`s birthday. If an italian restaurant can make my parents who are from Italy happy, then it is a great place indeeed! I loved that there was a free lot right outside since my family drove in from out of town, a priceless feature for a Hoboken restaurant. The service was excellent. We really enjoyed the margarita pizza; thin crust and excellent sauce. They offer warm focaccia bread which was fresh and yummy. We ordered a few salads and  pastas and all the ingredients tasted fresh. The one thing I wasn't crazy about was the type of prosciutto used for the arugula and prosciutto pizza. And of course, love that it's BYOB. Good place for families and kids. Will be back.
2013-02-14,1,Had Valentines Dinner there. Complete disappointment. When I made the reservation I was not told it would be a Pre Fixe meal. It wouldnt have a been a big deal though. Lots of places do an OPTION for pre fixe. Well on this day it was the only option. I've been to hundreds of restaurants in my life and 90% of the time a pre fixe special is a deal not a rip off. Well this pre fixe was marked up 35%. It was $49.95 per person for a choice of 3 apps, 3 entres, and 3 deserts. I did the math, if I ordered the same 3 items off the regular menu it wouldve been $33. We only wanted 1 app, and no desert but didnt matter, we were stuck paying the $49.95. It was very disrepectful to offer these prices. Valentines Day isnt a holiday, its a special day some people celebrate but we shouldnt have to pay for it. I didnt say anything at the restaurant out of respect of our waitress, nothing she could do and no managers were there that night. And i'm sure they wouldve gave some lame ass excuse anyways. Its simple math and they screwed everyone that dined there that night. I heard it from everyone around our table that they were not pleased with the pre fixe only option. Never again will I go. And that is sad but I like thier food.
2013-02-13,5,I just went here for a pre valentines day dinner last night. Such great customer service and delicious food! Loved the ambience and the high ceilings. It sort of feels like a loft apartment.
2013-01-29,3,As far as coal fired pizza goes in Hoboken, this place is ok, but you can definitely find better options. I would easily put Grimaldi's and Johnny Pepperoni above this place and, they're a better deal too. Besides being a convenient location for uptown folks, it doesn't differentiate itself in anyway besides making a pain to use their groupon.
2013-01-15,4,I would say San Gueseppe is a solid 3.5 stars. It's really good Italian food but nothing amazing. I've been here a few times and I've never had anything bad.  It is BYOB which of course is always a win for me.The food is delicious it's mostly solid Italian dishes nothing too out there and crazy, but all what seems to be fresh ingredients. They have a brick oven which I like. I've had everything from the gnocchi to pizza and nothing has been "meh" but nothing has sent me screaming down Adams Street in joyous celebration. We got the prosciutto and arugula pizza one night and there was just too much arugula on it, it was hard to even see the pizza it was just thrown on top, not baked into the pie. So that had a perk that we were able to pick the excess off, but that seemed like it was just being called in when you throw it on top like a parsley garnish.  But, the service is pretty good. The big perk is they have a parking lot...in Hoboken, true story. So that's nice. The only thing I don't like about it is the interior it just reminds me too much of a suburban Olive Garden.But, it's way uptown, has a parking lot, BYOB and solid food. Give it a try.
2012-10-16,2,Hmmm maybe I came on an off night (based on all the good reviews)but this place might have been the worst Italian food joint I've ever been to in NY and NJ. I have had better at Mamma Sbaros for much less. Let me start by saying my significant other and I were seated in a crammed corner when there were plenty of other seats available. The people next to us had a child and the seat was touching our table. They knocked over a bottle of wine on me...that's how close together we were. Ok so it's Friday and I'm not trying to let that ruin my night so I suck it up and we order food. AWFUL! I mean the worst! How can you mess up cooking pasta??? Bf's pasta undercooked and the vodka sauce tasted like a package that you can open and mix with water. The chicken was dry and overcooked. I got veal Bolognese and it was tasteless and my pasta was overcooked!!! The only reason we consumed any at all was bc we were starving. Also, we aren't the type to complain but had to make an exception when the waiter asked how it was. The redeeming part of all this was that they do have good waiters and the chef came over and comped us dessert and coffee. The dessert was weird and covered with WAY too much powdered sugar. I think this place has been crossed off my list FOREVER! Ah well! Needed a good go to place in that part of Hoboken but will stay true to Cafe Michelina!
2012-10-02,5,I loved my first dine-in experience at San Giuseppe.  The atmosphere is lovely with candles, low grade background music, slightly dimmed lights, and the coal fired stove as the highlight.  The service was excellent, and we especially enjoyed a visit from the owner who asked us how we liked our food.  The bread they give you for starters was incredible.  I had a pasta dish with shrimp in a white wine sauce that was extremely delicious.  My husband had the gnocchi and liked it as well.  We will certainly return to this lovely neighborhood cuccina serving delicious food with an ambience!
2012-09-23,5,This place is fantastic and an example of Groupon working for a business. The restaurant is in a small strip mall tucked away near the Clearview Cinemas....I may not have known about it without the Groupon, but I'm really glad I checked it out. The ambiance is great, with a huge coal-fired oven taking center-stage inside. There is also ample parking and outdoor seating. The staff was great and the owner was accommodating and enthusiastic while he spoke with us and helped man the oven.First, it's BYOB...a Hoboken staple and great start to the meal. Bring whatever you want and enjoy it with your meals. No corking fees or issues. We started with the coal-fired chicken wings, a must-order if you like wings. The portion size was generous for two or more people to split...12+ wings. The wings are crispy, slightly charred, and moist on the inside. They come with carmelized Vidalia onions that provide a great sweet, soft complement to the wings.We decided to split a pasta entree and a pizza. The entree was a family recipe called Sugo Delle Nonne. The pasta had meatballs with raisins and pine nuts...a delicious and unique interpretation of an Italian classic. The pizza (Quattro Stagioni) had prosciutto and a variety of cooked vegetables. The crust was perfect and the combination of favors was very nice. We left the meal with leftovers, a rarity for us, and will definitely be going back. Check this place out....great people and a great place.
2012-08-29,5,We order the pizza and that's all this about.  This is the best pizza in Hoboken.  The crust is tastier that Dozzino's.  The sauce is not from a can like at Napoli's. Grimaldi's is good too, but that's a heavier, doughier product.  This here is as close to real pizza as Hoboken gets (and for me there is only one kind of real pizza and it's not the one at Filippo's).I do get faint when I see how much three pizzas cost, however.
2012-08-20,4,Showed up without resi's for a table of 5.  Given that it was on the later side, the place was quiet.  Cute restaurant with parking = score.  The waiter was a little odd, service was spacey.  What, no bread?  We weren't offered any.  Had no idea what we were missing (back to that later).  Maybe he didn't like us, who knows?  APP:Insalata Caprese - was okay.  Some pieces were dosed in salt while others were not.  Definitely have had better.PIES:Margherita w/ extra Mozzarella/Prosciutto di Parma & Figs/Prosciutto di Parma & ArugulaMargherita was good.  If you're debating between a 12" and 14", do yourself a favor and get the 14".  They are super thin to begin with and the 12" is TINY.  We learned the hard way.  Spend the extra $2.  You'll thank me later.  Winner by far was the Prosciutto di Parma & Arugula. Ding! Ding! Ding!  Thin pieces of prosciutto and fresh baby arugula layered over a crispy thin crust with tomato sauce, sprinkled with parmigianno reggiano.  Mmmm, mmm good.  The fig pie is worth a spin too.  I don't like figs but thoroughly enjoyed shoveling this tasty pie down.We ordered take out the other night.  Say what? You don't deliver to my area?! Blasphemy!  Prosciutto di Parma & Arugula pie - Need I say more?Veal Parm served with Linguine al Pomodoro - Good.   Probably would order it again.Last but not least, we were given pieces of soft warm garlic flatbread sprinkled with salt and parm.  How did you steer me wrong the first time?  Where were my delicious morsels of glutenous extra carbs?  If they don't serve these during dinner, then they are cray-cray.
2012-08-17,1,Wings were good like everybody says. My wife liked the pizza, I thought it was tasteless, asked for sausage on half, covered the whole thing with minuscule pieces. Paid for extra fresh parmigiana graded over the whole pizza. Not there. Basil looked like it was from a box store bulk container of shredded morsels. Tuscan salad was fresh as far as the lettuce went, but the other ingredients were old, soggy and tasteless. Wendy's and McDonalds have superior salads to this. Tortino's frozen pizza at Walmart beats these pizzas. Save your money and order a Domino's.
2012-08-05,3,I was there on a Groupon thing. Unlike some other people's complaints, we were treated very well and the portions were the same as those give to other patrons. The food was just OK. The place seems to be a big hit but not sure why. The pizza was fine but not exceptional. Pizza at both Johnny Pepperoni and Napoli is better. Also ordered chicken parm. Just OK also., slightly better than a diner.  Sauce is a lot better at Margueritas in town and well, at $17, spend a few dollars more and go to Augustinos and you'll have the best parm.
2012-07-25,4,A BYO pizza place in Hoboken with plenty of free parking, yes it's true, it does exist.  San Giuseppe is a bit nicer than most pizza shops, I would say its more of an Italian restaurant that specializes in pizza; never the less, we ordered wings and pizza.  The wings were wood oven baked and covered in caramelized onions, a win win in my book.  The pizza we ordered was good but we did not like the artichokes (they made the pizza 'wet') or the olives (might have been right from the can).  Overall a good dining experience but I had to go light on the BYO since we were lazy and drove (we felt like we were getting away with something having non pain in the ass free parking in Hoboken).
2012-07-22,4,Got the groupon and used it last week, was my first time to this place in hoboken. I have to be honest, it was good. I really had low expectations because for as long as I have lived in hoboken i have only gone to zafra, cuchamarma, anthony davids, bin and elysian and every time I venture to try a new place I am disappointed and am reminded never to try a new place. The groupon persuaded me and it was close to clear view so we figured we would swing in to try it out. We had the chicken wings, truffle pizza and the veal parm all on the groupon for only 25 bucks. Everything thing in my mind told me not to get chicken wings at an italian place but my husband was in the mood.....boy were we surprised, coal fired with caramelized onions...delish....amazing twist on the traditional and a good sized portion. Then came the veal, pretty standard, but liked that it was not fried or coated in batter, very good. Then the pizza, more then a hint of truffle so it wasn't like they cheaped out on the ingredient which I love. BEtween me and my date we agreed that the wings were def. worth the price, the other food was probablly a few bucks too expensive should be more in the 15 range and 18 for the pie...but listen it was good and quality and I am sure with time as they start getting more people in there their food costs will lower and the prices will come down a little. I plan to go back even without the groupon....happy to have found this place!
2012-07-18,3,BYOB.Went here last night to use a Groupon. The Groupon details were far too specific and confusing. The waitor seemed like he didn't enjoy his job and he wasn't very attentive. The portions are large, the food was acceptable, and the decor was nice. But if you ask me, the food is over priced. There's a parking lot, so that is convenient for out of towners.Be warned, they turn the AC off far before it closes, so expect to sweat at the end of dinner. A cozy new spot to try, but I think there are far better Italian places in Hoboken.
2012-07-02,4,Strolled in here this past weekend after watching a movie and it definitely lived up to the reviews! We ordered two pizzas-the margherita and the L'Italiana (butternut squash, truffle oil, mushrroms) and we were happy with both of them.  The crust was perfect, the ingredients tasted fresh. The L'Italiana really stood out to me and I am already thinking about when to go back, if I based my review on this pie alone I would give them a 5/5.  I read mixed reviews about the service but I thought it was good.  Our server was attentive and pleasant.  The decor of the place was simple and clean.  Nice ambiance.  We didn't have dessert pizza but I am definitely going to save room for next time, we saw some other patrons really enjoying theirs!
2012-06-23,5,Really good pizza and appetizers!!
2012-06-17,4,We visited San Giuseppe's to kill some time before a movie. Their Margherita Pizza is great. Slice after slice it seems to get better. The in house cheesecake Rivals my favorite of all time "Mikes Pastry" The perfect spot for dinner before a movie at Clearview across the street.
2012-06-16,4,Pizza with fresh tomato sauce, goat cheese, figs, and proscuitto...BRILLIANT. It's not cheap but worth the price. One specialty pie is enough to feed two and rings in around $18.  You will also have to pay a $2 surcharge for delivery (if you order via delivery.com)Since my order was a delivery, I cannot speak for the ambiance and service. What I can say is that for a gal that doesn't love pizza, I sure do love me a Prosciutto di Parma & Figs pie.
2012-06-07,2,So first I have to say, I was shocked that the reviews were as high as they are for this place on Yelp. Now that I am past the shock, on to the review. We went here on a friend's suggestion and we were really looking forward to it. He said he loved it and had been several times. We arrived and it was pretty busy, good sign. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant right next to a very large (loud) party, when there were several other tables for 2 on the sides of the restaurant. I was a little disappointed and thought about asking for a change, but the large party looked to be finishing up so we stayed. (They never left!) Anyway, so we ordered a salad and the chicken wings for appetizers. The tri-colored salad was okay, nothing exciting, bland dressing, but the coal-fired wings were really great. Had I known what was to come, I would have just ordered 2 more orders of the wings and left happy. We ordered two pasta dishes for our entrees. I ordered the farfalle Mari and by BF ordered the linguini Mediteranea. Both were really bad. I am a decent cook and I could have made both dishes 100% better without question. Mine had a white wine sauce that had zero flavor. The peas & mushrooms were absolutely previously frozen. The shrimps were teeny tiny, also previously frozen and not even de-veined (which is a huge pet peeve of mine). I added a significant amount of salt & pepper & parmesan cheese but it wasn't helping, the dish was just bad. So bad that I stopped eating and gave up and didn't take anything home. My BF's dish was also bad. The sauce was weak. No flavor, no texture. The 'lobster tails' were like crayfish. It was a total rip off for $24 or $25, which was MP. Another tiny issue I had was they gave us a large bottle of water fo the table which I thought was great and then two shot glass sized glasses. I had to ask for big people glasses, I mean, c'mon. I don't want to take two sips of water and refill it. I want a glass of water. What does this place have going for it? It's a BYOB which is always nice.  It's clean and pretty. I have heard the pizza is good but I don't see us ever going back to try it. We did not enjoy this place at all... and I told my friend that he's crazy.
2012-06-01,5,Ate here a few weeks ago. Beautiful place. LOVE the warm, cozy, rustic Italian decor and ambience!  The owners are there cooking and are very pleasant people.  Food is outstanding.  Unique menu selection.  I had the gnocchi w/ pesto sauce and sundried tomatoes. Delish!  Oh and try that Italian soda too!  And make sure to have a yummy dessert with cappuccino!!  Looking forward to my next visit!  PS ~ the place has its own parking lot too!  What more could you ask for?!  Ciao!
2012-05-17,3,I'd give it a 3.5 if I could. Nice setting, and really makes you feel like you're somewhere outside of Hoboken. Very different than the usual suspects in town.Enjoyed the grilled veggie appetizer here a lot... very tasty! I think we also had the caponata, which was quite good, too. Both of our pasta entrees were nice- I had the arrabiata, which wasn't very spicy but enjoyable. I liked the food and atmosphere, and the convenience of the location. My only suggestion would be to add more kitchen entrees to the menu, as I'm not sure how often I'll come with mainly pasta and pizza as dinner options.
2012-04-19,4,Wow! I really didn't know what to expect when picked up a menu for this place at ferry terminal and decided to try it out. It's tucked into a strip mall in uptown Hoboken (and has parking, which is rare for this town), and it's still pretty new, so I figured that it could be pretty hit or miss. But I was pleasantly surprised. After reading some reviews, we decided that we had to get the grilled chicken wings with caramelized onions. I'm sorry to say that that was the low point of the meal... they were okay, but kind of dry, and could use a little something else, like maybe Gorgonzola crumbles. We finished them, but I don't think that we'll be ordering it again. But our entrees more than made up for our appetizer. My boyfriend got the Sunday sauce, and I got the Bolognese. Each tasted fresh, delicious, and the portion size was perfect - not too much, and not too little. We were both really happy with our meals. We also tried the cheesecake and cannoli, and would recommend them to anyone.Also, it's a BYOB...something we need more of in Hoboken!
2012-04-06,4,I had been curious about San Giuseppe after going to the movie theater nearby. We went on a Friday night and were pleased. I loved the decor which has  a very Tuscan feel to it. The lighting is more on the dim side and gives the restaurant an intimate feel. We started with  a special- burrata cheese over greens-it was excellent and a good value. Next, we shared a margherita pizza. The sauce was light and a good pie overall. For our entrees we had gnocchi with pesto sauce-good pesto, not over whelming, but the gnocchi could have been cooked a pinch more. The papardelle with veal bolognese was very good. I would have loved a little more sauce. Our server was pleasant and had good follow-up. We enjoyed San Giuseppe and love the fact that it is a byob and offers parking- a rarity in Hoboken.
2012-03-27,5,In a town that has more mediocre restaurants than nail salons, this place is a true neighborhood gem. The chef/owner is on the premises (such a rarity these days) making the pizza and greeting the customers. As any true Italian pizza maker would do, he uses "00" flour which gives the pizza crust a nice texture with a light and airy consistency. In other words its like the pizza you get in Italy. Absolutely DELICIOUS! And after just coming from eating at DiFara's Pizza in Brooklyn and trying every pizza place in this town, San Guiseppe delivers the best pizza in Hoboken by far!!The modern yet homey restaurant, is a nice sized place with high ceilings and warm colors. It is beautifully lit by real tealight candles that are placed on every table. All these attributes make you feel welcomed. They start you off with homemade Parmesan flatbreads, again delicious. It's BYOB, so they cork and place your wine in large stainless steel buckets...is this place really in a strip mall and not on 5th avenue?! Such details like large wine glasses and a glass carafe of water on the table, make this place truly a welcomed pleasure in a town where restaurants constantly miss the mark.Besides the pizza, we also had the tricolor salad with fresh shavings of Parmesan (really nice honey dressing, they actually use good quality olive oil), the Nonna pasta dish (brasiole, small meatballs and sausage over ziti) and the Orrechettie pasta with fresh tomato, peas and sweet sausage in a light white wine sauce. Everything was extremely fresh and the quality you get here is way better than any restaurant on Washington Street. One thing I would like to see maybe as specials or eventually on the menu is a few more protein options. Doesn't have to be many but a chicken, fish and steak dish would be the perfect addition to the menu.Living right down the block, this place has become an instant favorite. I'm so glad to have a restaurant of this caliber "back here" in Uptown Hoboken. My family and I loved the food, ambiance and the cozy, warm feeling you got from the decor and the staff. We would gladly return any night of the week and will do so quite often! Yum!
2012-03-12,3,2.5 actuallyI was debating whether to have Italian or Latin@Cucharamama and even though Cucharamama should have been the obvious choice for some reason me and friends went to San G, well turned out be not a very good decision.Well first of all this place is for people in uptown Hoboken, if you are anywhere below 10th don't bother to walk up to this place just to eat here. The good thing is if you around and have booze this place is BYOB.Started with their famous and different style chicken wings. It was an interesting experience to have caramalized onions over wings, however I am of the opinion that wings should have a little bit of fire&kick in it. Not bad though.The main course bombed big time. The pastas were terribly bland and no great taste. I don't know if these are preparations of a specific area in Italy but all I can say is they didn't taste good. Pastas should be rich and not flat and boring.I am sure not coming back, atleast not for the food. Good ambience though. Nice warm and cozy. Good date spot if you have more that nice tasting food on your mind :)
2012-03-10,3,So much promise, but so little delivery.  The coal fired chicken wings sound nice in concept but, while tasty, ended up quite oily.  The pappardelle was one of the most boring dishes I believe I've ever had.  How can something with a tomato sauce end up so bland? Not sure.Well, the only redeeming part of our visit is that we didn't have the pizza.  I want to try the pizza and then I will report back.  If I'm dissatisfied again, I will downgrade appropriately.
2012-03-09,5,The ambience and food are FANTASTIC! First off, the decor is warm and inviting and very intimate. It is perfect for a date night as it provides an optimal setting to have quality conversation. Also, the location is very convenient if you are looking for a lovely, scrumptious dinner before or after a movie (i.e., the new Clearview Cinemas are right next door).So, when you go to San Giuseppe, you should be prepared to indulge on Italian food goodness! My friends and I started off with two appetizers- a cheese plate and burrata. Let me tell you, the burrata was creamy and delectable. Yum! And the cheese plate was a great starter for the main dish to come. For my main dish, I had the gnocchi with pesto sauce. The portion was perfect in that it was just enough for me to feel satisfied without being too full. The dish was creamy and seasoned so well. I definitely would have that again.We shared 2 desserts- the profiteroles and the Baci sweet pizza. We started with the profiteroles, which were amazing. Again, they were just right the three of us, a beautiful cap to a wonderful meal. But then, the sweet pizza came. Not only was it incredibly delicious, it was also aesthetically pleasing. The Baci pizza is made with nutella and strawberries sprinkled with powdered sugar. This dessert was very refreshing and big enough to be shared by 3-5 people (depending on how full you are) so no guilt about eating a dessert on your own:)I would definitely return to San Giuseppe. It is a great addition to Hoboken, one that has been long welcomed. I used to live in Hoboken and this restaurant is one of the reasons I would want to come back. But I'm just across the river and it is easy enough to come over. It is SO worth it!
2012-02-08,5,I can not be happier that a friend of mine suggested we try San Giuseppe's! Oddly I am a Manhattan girl that has visited many Italian restaurants in neighboring areas such as Stamford, White Plains, and now Hoboken. In comparison, as others have mentioned San Giuseppe's provides an upscale ambiance while offering a great value. I love the high ceilings which I believe added an intimate feel; obviously something that is hard to achieve at many NYC restaurants due to the close seating.Of course I wouldn't be this pleased if the food was not delicious! To start we ordered one of the Burrata, an appetizer special. This was my first-time trying Burrata which was so creamy and delicious with the warm bread provided. The Burrata was presented on a bed of salad which was dressed with a vinaigrette of sorts for those who did not want to pair it with bread. We also had the cheese plate and I was very pleased that there were apple slices to help cleanse your palate. Of course with all this cheese the Waiter happily provided us with more bread. I then ordered the pasta amore, which I must admit was based on a review I found online. I absolutely loved the inclusion of peas, and  unlike the reviewer I had enough sausage for the portion I took home. And I am very glad I decided to take some pasta home to save room for dessert. Now this was dinner with my girlfriend so we went big on dessert. We had the profiteroles and a dessert pizza. The profiteroles were yummy with the chocolate drizzle but nothing beats the fresh strawberries on top of nutella dessert pizza!I was so please with my dessert pizza I can not wait to visit San Giuseppe's again to try one of the savory coal fired pizzas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2012-02-03,4,Altogether an excellent experience.   I had a vision in my head of going to a quiet, cold pizza joint in a strip mall - this couldn't be any further than that.  It's warm, busy and has a great atmosphere.  At 9:30 on a Friday night, every table was filled. The coal-fired pizza is top notch - just enough char, but not too much.  The crust is the perfect combination of crispy and chewy and the tomato sauce is just a bit sweet.   It's not the slightest bit greasy or sloppy - you can eat it right out of the oven without being covered in juices.  Gramaldi's may have the history, but I think this pizza is better and its served in a ambiance that doesn't make you feel like you're offending them when you place an order.We also shared a pasta dish to start, which was very flavorful, cooked perfectly al dente and included a generous portion of excellent jumbo shrimp.The owner carefully watches over the pizza counter.  I think I only saw him peek into the main kitchen once or twice while we were there.   You can see that pizza is his passion and he takes great care in everything he touches.  He did take enough time to step into the dining room and make sure that each of his tables were happy and everyone genuinely looked as if they were enjoying themselves.Altogether a great addition to a town filled with mediocre pizza joints - it certainly stands out above the rest.  Relative to the other places in the area, it's certainly 5 stars...compared to some of the best of the best across the river, maybe 4.5.   Regardless, I'll be back.Hey, and it's got parking!
2012-01-08,5,This place made delicious pizza and pasta dishes. Service was excellent. Very good selection of food.  Nice size portions. This is not a typical restaurant it is a nice  cozy and relaxing place. Did not feel rushed. Was able to take our time and enjoy and that we did! Cooks, pizza man and waiter all were excellent. Would highly recommend this place.
2012-01-05,5,My wife and I went for an early dinner.  The restaurant is in a small strip mall with parking, right next to a nice movie theater.  The restaurant was very attractive, with a nice warm feeling.  The service was very good with many upscale touches such as small water glasses with a bottle of water brought to your table. (no giant water glasses so they can avoid refilling). The wine glasses for our BYOB were large and high end.  The salad was almost enough for the both of us to share. It had a subtle taste that my wife thought was delicious.  I prefer a salad with all kinds of Italian goodies, plain lettuce and a bit too much dressing with a big taste. We both had pasta dishes. Mine the grandma's sauce, Penne with meatballs and braised beef in a grandma's sauce.  Very very good, big portion, but my grandma used to put a bit of sauce on the top.  The coffee was great. The waiter who was also great told us that they carry the takeout orders to the parking lot.  Very useful when I bring my grand kids and we don't have to get out of the car.We will be frequent visitors.
