2021-11-17,5,This place is cool! We went in on a Tuesday night I felt like a Friday night. Before you know it it's 2am and they are kicking out us out.
2021-11-16,1,This is such a horrible place! The food is great although the environment is so bad! I went in and was accusing of saying a remark to a waitress! Now about the service. I have been sitting for so long here and I have never have been asked for anything! I've seen many waitresses there talking to customers forget about people having food. They were talking to people just standing there,not having a meal. 15 minutes of what was left of the  30 minutes I was there they had the audacity to ask me if I need anything.  too late for asking me for something. I was about to leave already. They also are racist!!! There is an article on them being racist
2021-10-26,1,This has to be the trashiest place in Hoboken. I'm grossed out every time I even have to walk by it. This place is the epitome of Hoboken trash.
2021-10-22,2,I ordered food through Uber eats. I called this place to make sure that they included sauces. The person from mad hatter was so rude about it and hung up on me. Like how do you just do that to a customer that's been ordering so many times.
2021-10-22,1,If I can give this place zero stars I would. I would never in my life recommend any one to go to this unprofessional bar it's trash the security guards shouldn't be walking freely they should be behind bars for physically & verbally assaulted me. Surprise business still running for bad customer service
2021-10-18,1,The manager of this place pretends to be an owner . He's such a tool it's nauseating. typical white boy that pretends to be black. Place is typical Hoboken bar pretending to be a nightclub on weekends . Nothing special.
2021-10-09,5,Breanna was an phenomenal waitress and made my experience at Madd Hatter incredible! Excellent and professional service, highly recommend her!
2021-09-29,5,Gabby is the best waitress ever! I felt really accommodated with everything I was ordering with her. Highly recommend her!
2021-09-29,5,Love the bar bites, Claudio, gabby and tony are exceptional. They've provided such a great service while my girlfriend and I were here. Love the fishbowls and the food here. Music is also a nice vibe as well!! It doesn't help that I'm right around the corner so I'll always be here
2021-09-20,4,Came Monday night for a birthday, vibes were great for a Monday and had all the games on music blasting, great service. All together would recommend!
2021-09-15,5,YO! Let me start by saying this place is the ABSOLUTE SHITTTTTT. In a good way of course. Fell in love with the margarita fish bowl. That thing was ridiculously huge AND, not to mention, my boyfriend and I could not finish it all so we had to take it to GO. This was our first time coming here and the staff & security were friendly and have manners unlike most places I've been to. I like the fact that they have games. It's giving dave and busters vibe but like more partyish. Did not try the food because we randomly came only for the drinks but deff going to come back and taste the food soo stay tuned for that update.
2021-09-13,2,The website is super outdated, a group of us specifically went there for what we believed was $3 mimosas (as said on website).  When we arrived there we came to find out they were $11 each, bummer. Also paid to make a reservation and was told if I wanted to stay longer I would have to spend an addition $75 a person, crazy to me. Overall the food was good but probably won't go back
2021-09-12,1,This is the first review that I've ever written, as I've never experienced anything as appalling as what we experienced today, neither as a customer nor as an employee of numerous restaurants. I recognize that every place has bad days, but this seems like a consistent issue after reading other reviews following our experience. I wouldn't want to turn people off to an establishment because I know that it is peoples' livelihoods, but I would not recommend this place at all with the current operations, solely based on the greed of this establishment. If you do come here, carefully review your bill and advocate for yourself! We walked up as a table of 7 to watch Sunday football and were told it would be $50 minimum per person ($350 for the table). This was the first red flag (especially for someone who does not drink alcohol thus likely will not spend anywhere near $50), but most other places were already full and Madd Hatter had plenty of open tables. After we gave a license, credit card, and signed an agreement for the monetary minimum, we sat down and were told there was a 1.5-2 hour limit. Truly absurd to ask 7 people to spend $350 in 1.5 hours when they came to watch a football game that is likely 3 hours minimum. They okayed us staying for one game, as it was likely clear that we were already aggravated. Once the bill came, we noticed that they added 22% gratuity -- another absurdity. I am completely fine with restaurants adding 20% to parties of 6 or more, but to add 22% as a requirement without even saying anything is pure greed. Myself, the people I was with, and I'd imagine many other people would happily tip over 20% for sitting at a table for a few hours if not being mandated to give more. Once it was agreed that the 22% service charge would be removed to give a cash tip, we noticed that more money was still added to the bill. This was subsequently explained as a credit card fee, but was not written on the bill as such. It was written on the bill that we would get 3.5% off if we paid cash, but apparently what that means is you will be charged 3.5% more if you are paying with a card. Madd Hatter -- I think that you might find that you would actually make more money and have much happier customers that repeatedly return if you were not as obviously trying to maximize profit at the expense of extremely negative customer experiences.
2021-08-30,1,This is my first review I've ever written on here, and I wish a review could go lower than 1 star. The owner of this joint thinks he runs the city of Hoboken. He and his bouncers push around people who ate minding their own business because they don't "look like they belong here". This owner is a wannabe promoter/ social media star who owns some concierge service, all to over-compensate for what he doesn't have. The place is a reflection of his personality and the essence of Jersey white trash. Avoid at all costs. There are so many other bars in Hoboken to have a great Saturday night at.
2021-08-28,1,I will never be coming back here again. I can't even say it's over rated because it's only has 3 stars overall which is what it deserves. I had the fish bowl drink and it tasted like lemonade. The alcohol was nonexistent. $55 drink down the drain. We left with no buzz at all. 4 shots and fish bowl drink, and the appetizer sampler(smh) bill was over $120 and majority of everything was left there when we were done. We barely ate and there was more then half of the fish bowl drink due to it being extremely sweet with no taste of alcohol. The food was mediocre and not to say that but the waitress followed me and my date out due to us not giving a tip. Low budget workers. Have more class as a restaurant. The best part was the flare candle that came in the drink. I wouldn't even say e for effort save you money and go to somewhere in the city (123 Burger to be exact) at least you'll get drunk from there drinks.
2021-08-27,1,This place sucks. It's a shame because 1 republic the club it replaced was the best spot in Hoboken. The manager is a joke. There's much better spots in town. Avoid
2021-08-20,1,My partner and I came here yesterday, spent about $40 on 2 bottled waters, fried calamari and fries that has a sprinkling of parm cheese and some type of garlic oil  the calamari was obviously some type of frozen brand so it was very underwhelming and tasteless to say the least. The prices are ridiculous for the food they offer at the quality they serve it. We more than likely won't be returning.
2021-08-14,5,Delicious drinks, amazinggg food and the management is so welcoming and friendly! Nice place to eat and drink with friends, music is a vibe too.
2021-08-14,5,We came to Madd Hatter for a friend's brunch and it was the most fun I've had in months. The food was delicious and the drinks were phenomenal. Jimmy hooked us up with a great bottomless deal and was so accommodating to our group's preferences. 10/10 recommend!!!!
2021-08-11,4,I came here with a big group and the food was good, a bit better than your typical bar food and the drinks were great. atmosphere was fun too, especially with a DJ!
2021-08-10,5,Great spot to have a drink and have a good time with friends! Love this spot! Best server here is Noika!
2021-08-07,1,Drinks are terrible. Went last night and ordered a Henny Colada. The colada wasn't creamy it was more icey and not that strong or tasty. My 2nd drink was a Mojito (highly recommended by our server - who was great), but this drink was disgusting. Way too much lime juice, I like mojitos but this wasn't it! Then the manager (who was very pleasant and professional) got me another one to go. I later realized there was dirt in the bottom of the cup. So gross.. CLEAN OFF THE MINT LEAVES before you put them in drinks!!! The place was jammed pack inside. Never returning, ever.
2021-08-02,1,I am disappointed to even give Madd Hatter one star as when it was formerly 1 Republik, it was my SPOT!To sum up my lengthy review: Disorganization, cards on file, pricey bar food, music can be better.My friends and I decided on Madd Hatter on Sunday around 2pm to catch up with each other. I decided to make a reservation online since I know it's a pretty popular spot. When making the reservation online, you have to pay a $5 reservation fee in which your card is on file just in case you try to cancel last minute they charge you $25 per person on your reservation. Usually when you're charged a reservation fee it goes towards your bill; in this case it did not. Even though it was only $5. I've been to places where they just ask for your card on file for the reservation and never charged me any "reservation fees."When my friends and I arrived, security checked our ID's and we were seated. We were given 3 different menus; brunch menu, drinks menu and a regular menu. After looking over the menu for 10 minutes one of the managers came over to tell us they're no longer serving brunch even though the menu says "every day," and we were given the incorrect menus. He then gave us a one page menu so things were very limited. Especially for me since I don't eat meat. The impossible burger on the "incorrect" menu was around $16 where as on this new menu it was around $22. Since this new menu didn't have many options I opted for the veggie burger for $16 which was literally a pre-frozen veggie patty on a bun with french fries. I always get disappointed when a restaurant serves the same veggie patty I can heat up at home for $5. My boyfriend ordered the chicken quesadillas in which he said they were great and my friend ordered the plain pizza which she liked as well. My other friend order the calamari which she took one bite of and didn't eat the rest. The drinks started around $14; fishbowls were around $45+.Now, our waitress was BARELY present I mean we were trying to get water for the longest and it took forever. My boyfriend asked for water for the table and she only brought him a cup. My friend asked for blue cheese and water (again) and she was waiting about 30+ minutes for. What made matters worse is that another waitress stopped by our table to tell us our previous waitress is leaving so she is taking over our table. Such a sweet waitress too but since we were pretty irked about our previous waitress our new waitress got the brunt of the issue. Our previous waitress was "leaving" but we saw her waiting other tables still 20 minutes later and still didn't give my friend her blue cheese or the table any water! Our new waitress also stated we needed to put a card on file as it is company policy which is also annoying. This place already had mine from the reservation and now my friends. Almost 40 minutes later and we finally got water; the manager brought us over bottled water which he did not charge us for. When we got the bill, it was over $200. Gratuity was 22% which was automatically added for groups over 6 people. Gratuity tacked on an additional $40+ which is crazy for the service we received. My friend also asked for her calamari to be taken off since it was gross. After many back and forths, the manager took off the gratuity and gave us 10% off of our bill. There was a DJ too playing music such as YMCA, Simple Plan, Panic at the Disco, etc. Music you hear at like a college orientation. You can barely hear each other talk but we would've stuck through it if the music was better.All in all, my friends and I will never visit Madd Hatter again.
2021-07-29,1,BEWARE angry bouncers that couldn't tell you your left from your right. Have no idea what they're doing and deny entry if you have out of state ID. Go elsewhere!!!
2021-07-26,2,I visited this spot for brunch on 7/25. I will never return due to the experience my family and I had. I felt racially profiled, by this establishment when asked to leave a card with the waitress " to ensure we don't skip out on the bill" I've never heard of such actions being taken. Also the fact that you have to pay $25 for a reservation just to get there and the restaurant isn't even busy. The Manager refunded that because he realized that its pretty unfair to charge such a fee, so I do appreciate that.  The drinks I'm assuming are what people go for and that was the best part. I ordered buffalo chicken eggrolls and asked the server was their cheese in it 3x she said NO.  I tasted cheese and asked for the manager he too confirmed there was no cheese. there was cheese in it I was very frustrated at this point and made up my mind I will never return. Another pro to this establishment along with the drinks is the atmosphere and music. Other than that this place is overrated.
2021-07-23,2,So let me rip Madd Hatter a new one!!! I have been to this establishment a couple of times and each time I had a blast and service was good. Vibes were great! However, this past recent visit on a Taco Tuesday was horrid!!! First off the waitress (her service sucked) tells me and my friend that one person has to give up their ID and debit card for the table. Mind you I NEVER was told this the other times I had been there. I find this very odd and was not comfortable doing that. So I speak to the Manager who explains that many drunk patrons have been dining and dashing and leaving the waiters with large bills. So I'm like I get it but....Still no way I want someone holding that valuable info during the whole time I am dinning. Mind you when they give you back your stuff from the Fanny packs they wear they pull out ALL the cards and the waitress I had goes what's your name???!! and I'm looking at all these other people info. I finally get mine and I'm like never again!! the icing on the cake is Taco Tuesday is TRASH. Again, our waitress failed to tell us that after the first round of tacos you do NOT GET ANY MORE CONDIMENTS!!! You will be eating a naked taco!!!!  We were like what???!! And once again the waitress did not give my table water, napkins, plates or utensils. Another waiter had to do so. Overall, getting good service appears to be a hit or miss there. TACO TUESDAY SUCKS!!
2021-07-19,4,Loved the vibe here inside and outside. We decided to eat outside. They have tvs at each outdoor Table showing a sports game! I've never seen that before streetside, definitely lures customers in. The calamari was meh the fries were yum. The wings were delicious. The server was great. Go, enjoy!
2021-07-18,1,Never EVER going back here again and PSA If you are a girl STAY CLEAR OF THIS PLACE. Last night the group I was with noticed a girl how was basically unconscious and a guy was feeding her drinks. One of the girls went over to check if she was ok and the guy replied with "you're the fifth person to ask her that, don't be a hero". So after hearing that we went to the staff to let them know and they didn't do a single thing about it.  Instead the staff and the (potential rapist) were all hugh fiving each other because get this he's a regular ! So we obviously made a scene about this while they were kicking us out due to them closing and then the manger or owner came up was like trying to keep it all hush hush. So bottom line is this place condones sexual assault knowingly and I guess proudly if they don't do anything when something like this is brought to their attention.
2021-07-13,1,I was forced to leave one star but this place deserves none. The service is terrible, our waitress had absolutely no personality and wasn't attentive. The food was not tasty at all and the drinks were super watered down. Anywhere else would be better.
2021-07-09,2,Very mediocre burgers. Only thing good was the fries, which makes it deserving of two starts. It was $50 for me and my grandpa to get two burgers and some sodas. There's no free refills and each drink is $2.50. A total scam. Not coming again.
2021-07-08,5,Loved my experience here and the huge drinks made by Noika were delicious! Maria was our server and she was amazing! will definitely be coming here again.
2021-07-02,1,Imagine a world where a sports bar doesn't play the sound for the game on.   Our waitress was great but ownership/management was too involved with with themselves to realize customers were literally walking out of the bar because they decided to play Carrie Underwood instead of the game.  You can't fix stupid and I guess this is why the bar next door was full and they were at 30% capacity.
2021-06-26,2,I could probably be here all day. Honestly I wouldn't come back here unless I wanted to watch football or basketball. The security guard Ace was probably the best server and that's not in his job description. Our orders kept getting messed up. None of the alcoholic drinks had alcohol. The mimosas tasted like Sunny Delight, the sangria tasted like Hawaiian Punch and the Margaritas tasted like 7Up. I feel like our server was in training.
2021-06-24,1,I love this place. It's lively, most of the time, the food and drinks are great. The bartenders are attentive and generous if you tip them well. The food is so good that I have actually ordered from Uber eats. They are pretty quick. So, the food is usually pretty warm when it's gets here. Now, the reason I gave one star. I found out from a very reliable source that when food is ordered from Uber eats, the restaurant takes the order and drivers that work for Madd Hatter only, deliver the food. . Fine, that's pretty smart if you thinks about. What I don't like is that if you tip the driver through Uber eats, mad hatter keeps it. Now, this really chafes my ass. How dare you mad hatter, where do you get off stealing from your employees. I hope that you rectify this situation and you give the tips to the people that work for them.
2021-06-15,4,Overall had a great night for my friend's birthday. Had to take one star off due to the overall rudeness of the staff. Front door man needs a chill pill, tried to start an argument with one of my friends and continued to talk about him to staff throughout the night. Don't know if I would return honestly.
2021-06-13,1,Seriously a Sunday afternoon and they have a dress code, no flip flops.... Didn't know you had to dress up for a beer. I'll never step foot in that place. You lost my business forever.
2021-06-04,1,This place sucks. Guy at the door asked us to come in then turned us away. Do not come here worst spot in Hoboken.
2021-06-04,5,Always good food, attentive bartenders, and a good crowd. A must stop if you're out in Hoboken
2021-06-01,5,Great bar! It's a lot of fun, and a good way to get your friends together in Hoboken.  There are a lot of good food options, both casual bar food and others, and it's good for brunch, lunch, or dinner.  They always have good music and fun DJs. If you're into sports, they have so many TV screens to check out the games.  It's a fun spot for a birthday party too.  Check it out!
2021-06-01,1,Absolutely awful. Overpriced, overrated, and so hard to get in touch with. Would not recommend at all. There are much better options around.
2021-05-24,4,SUPER LOUD if you dine inside. Outside was much better. Staff, service, food and drinks all A+. I will be retiring with a few of my besties real soon. We had the Buffalo chicken pizza, chicken tacos, Mac n cheese burger, panini chicken parm, penne with vodka sauce and shrimp and for drinks we shared a $55 Miami vice fish bowl. **Check out the pix
2021-05-22,1,This place is honestly a joke. It use to be One Republic but sadly it closed . It's now the Madd Hatter..first time I came we had to leave because of how awful the service was. I went back recently with my roommate from college and boy is this a place a joke. I had one drink with my friend and we weren't allowed "in" to have a table because of the beer belly manager in a stripped shirt  he was mad that we danced when we went to the bathroom..what a joke. Anyways place is high school drama and no fun. Go else where.
2021-05-20,1,Is it possible to give 0? As soon as we came in the sever never came to us for like 45 mins. When we got the sever the bouncer came and told us when are we leaving? After we got out, our group was trying to figure out what to do, and the bouncer comes out and tells us to move and get out. We are already outside, we are not getting in his way what so ever. This was the worst place to go to tonight, if you ever want to spend $1000 dollars and have a good time, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO GO!!
2021-05-13,5,Nice and clean. A lot of space and the music is good. Staff is a little slow but what can you expect on weekends when people can't go get their own drinks.
2021-05-11,1,Rip off -&17.60 fo ONE Tito's on the rocks on a Tuesday @ 5:30. No happy hour?! Server sad $3.00 up charge for ice! Seriously?! Plus tax. Ummm NO. I've been in this business a long time & That's More than any vodka I have Ever served in all the places I worked and poured in Manhattan. Nope, never gong there again !
2021-05-05,2,It is so dark in this restaurant. Felt like I was training to be a radiologist. Ordered a Madd Hatter Platter and a margherita pizza. They brought out the pizza, and we thought it was the wrong one because it did not look like a margherita pizza. They said it's the margherita pizza but they ran out of basil. That's like buying a car and the dealership tells you they ran out of keys. This is a good place to go when you're depressed and want to sulk in your sorrows. That's the vibe the environment gives off here. Needless to say, I do not like this place. If you must go eat at this place, I recommend going to the Aspen Market (89ft away) first to buy some basil for the chef.
2021-05-04,5,Enjoyed the night with my nephew & his fiance before their wedding. Thanks for the Henny Colada fish bowl, he wasn't ready for it.
2021-05-02,3,Visited this bar for the first time and was left feeling underwhelmed. The food was sub par and overpriced. The drinks were definitely overpriced and not very strong. There was nothing particularly terrible about my visit I just expected a lot more as this is a well known spot. In my opinion definitely overrated and there are better spots to go.
2021-05-02,1,This place would have been decent. Granted if they had better customer service. As soon as we got there ( a party of 18)  they were legit throwing a family of three out. And not the normal "can you please leave" I mean the manager walked up to this table no questions asked and said "Get tf out"! And started tossing her drinks and taking all of her belongs off of the table. On complete shock our server says he had that table but didn't have a reason for why they were getting kicked out. He just laughed....... our initial server complained about us giving him our orders to the point where he complained and said it I miss anything it's YALL fault .......after the fourth time he gave us a bee server. Now we didn't get any of our food till about 9. At 10:27 the security guard who had only said something to our table ( mind you were the only table with poc). Said you have 5 min and you need to go.... we hadn't even gotten a bill nor finished ordering because the staff was hardly around and always rude..... now they tell us they can only use 1 card and cash for a party of 18....... so as we are trying to work it out the mad persists on telling us we need to leave. If we paid we need to go. But the bill wasn't paid so how does that make sense. It is not the customers fault u over booked if that was the case. The customers are always right .... simple I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE HAD SUCH SHITTY SERVICE. AND not a single person from my group will return due to the continual disrespect and poor treatment.
2021-05-01,1,Really disappointed with my recent experience with MH. COVID rules were inconsistent, depending on your group. I was forced (not asked) to leave, couldn't even close out my tab, by an aggressive bouncer while others who broke the rules were treated differently.
2021-04-20,2,Wish the service was as great as the food. It took over 15 min, while sitting right out front near the entrance, for someone to notice I was sitting without a menu then another 20 for someone else to take my drink order. Food was good but prob won't be coming back here.
2021-04-19,2,I had high expeditions for this place and it definitely was not all that. The staff is AWFUL. One man I wish I had his name was extremely rude. I had 2 tables reserved, while one table got up to use the bathroom the man took all the stuff of their table and said I'm giving this table away your causing me to lose money. One waitress for about 10 tables took me forever to order a drink. Music was not great, wouldn't go back. Only good thing was the drinks was delicious
2021-04-17,1,Literally the worst experience. The drinks are super overpriced and not even high quality. The bouncer was not only rude, but aggressive. We were staying in our own booth and when my friend stood up, he shoved the chair into his legs and yelled at him to sit down. I've never experienced something like this at a restaurant. I understand it's Covid and they have regulations, but after spending $800 (their minimum for the amount of people) he could have just asked my friend to sit down. Unfortunately, we were there for my friend's 30th birthday and this place was so terrible it ruined the night. We will never be back and I hope management doesn't condone this abusive behavior towards patrons.
2021-04-11,1,we went for a friends birthday, didnt even ask for our main entrees when we had family style..i had to ask also kicked us out before even had desert.it was my friend's birthday and we didnt get desert.bad service and bad atmosphere.never would go again. waist of money
2021-04-10,1,Made a reservation to come here for a friend's birthday, had to wait in line, and when we got to the door was told that we were going to be kicked out, (before even getting in), for asking how long we had to wait since we had a reservation. I'm sorry, but I thought the point of having a reservation was to avoid lines and not be treated poorly and for the establishment to he prepares for our group. Yes we were on time.
2021-04-09,5,I am so happy with the service I have received here recently. Staff and management crew are hands on !! Everyone is 6 feet apart or even more. No dancing allowed. If not In table mask must be on. Strictly enforced. Thank you to Abe for my last minute reservations on a busy Thursday. I'll be back !!! Xoxo
2021-04-07,4,I recently came to Madd Hatter to celebrate my birthday dinner with my girlfriend.  I specifically chose this place because I was in the mood for beers, wings, and burgers; and this place looked like it had all 3 (with amazing reviews for all of these items). We came on a Monday night, and got seated right away. We started out having some beers. I went with a hazy IPA and my girlfriend went with a regular IPA. The beers were great and we ordered a second round.  Now it was time for the appetizer.  We ordered some wings, half BBQ and half buffalo.  The wings were amazing. The meat was cooked perfectly and the flavors were just great. I love a good wing, and this place definitely has them.  For our main meals, we ordered the Madd Hatter Cheese Steak and Madd Hatter Heaven Burger, and decided to split both of our meals, so we can each try them out.  The meals were both excellent.  I loved the Burger. With all the great toppings on it, it was just perfect.  The cheesesteak was pretty damn good as well.  What was really cool is that you can order your fires with one of their awesome ways they prepare it.  We went with Cajun and Rosemary Sea Salt.  Loved the fries. I would come back to try some more of them, thats how good they were.  Overall, I had a great time celebrating my birthday here.  The food was great and service was excellent. Definitely recommended.
2021-04-05,4,This is a pretty cool place. Good music, great service (THANKS RAYYYYYYYYY), and good food. Two of my girlfriends and I stopped by there to get some food and drinks. Ended up staying a little longer because of the vibe. All the way from New York, will be back soon! Ordered the Margarita Pizza, Buffalo Chicken Pizza, Calamari, Wings, and some mango margsssss ;)
2021-04-05,1,Good place if you want some privacy. We came during happy hour and they had unlimited wings and if someone on the table didn't order wings they will hawk you to make sure no one is sharing wings. Drinks are TERRIBLE. I ordered a Hennyade and I did not taste any Henny so I ordered a bulldog mango margarita thinking they can't mess that up. Apparently they did, the mango tasted like carrot and again I did not taste any alcohol. I paid over 50 dollars for two drinks and didn't make me feeling nice. There are way better bars in Hoboken.
2021-03-28,1,What an absolute laughable excuse for a business. Yesterday was two of my friends birthdays so we decided to have a combined birthday day of celebrations. We started our night off by getting dinner at San Giuseppe in the more northern portion of Hoboken. That restaurant was excellent and I highly suggest it. But onto this dumpster fire of a bar.I've never been the biggest fan of Hoboken in comparison to Manhattan but it's always nice to change things up and cross the Hudson here and there to check out their bar scene. Also, currently bars have no closing curfew in Hoboken and do in Manhattan so it's nice to be able to stay out later. Considering all of these factors, we OVER A MONTH ago decided to call Mad Hatter and schedule a private birthday event with them for our party. What a devastating mistake we had made.We get there last night after dinner and as we pull up in the car another member of our party, who had not come to dinner with us, was being screamed at like an animal by the bouncer of the bar (not wearing a mask I would like to add).  He was shouting at him telling him how he didn't care that we had made a reservation and actually even prepaid for the open bar, and that we should wait across the street in front of a bank for our entire party to arrive and then he would "see what they can do". We obviously did not listen to that asinine solution to the problem so we continued to stand on the sidewalk in front of the bar which is within our rights to do as the Mad Hatter does not own the sidewalk. Man oh man, the bouncer did not like that. He continued to scream and lose his mind telling us we need to cross the street. It was getting pretty funny at this point how mad he was getting. If he didn't have an aneurysm last night, one may be on the way if he doesn't get his anger issues under control. Anyway, finally someone with a brain came outside (a manager or owner I'm assuming) and began explaining to the woman in our party who had organized this all a month ago that they had "overbooked" and will not be able to accommodate us whatsoever. He then proceeded to refund the people who had already prepaid for the open bar and offered no other avail. At that point we just left the entire city of Hoboken and went back into Manhattan. Hoboken had a good one or two month run during the pandemic while they loosened restrictions quicker than Manhattan. But with New York returning to normal now, that streak is definitely over with this event as a clear exclamation mark.All around a very embarrassing show of accountability as a business that clearly hates satisfying their customers. They took what was supposed to be a very enjoyable evening for all of our friends, many of which had traveled from Philadelphia for this event, and turned it into a disaster experience for our friends 25th birthdays. A day that should be looked back on with joy, not one marked by some freaky bouncer spitting in our faces as he screams his lungs out with anger. I'll definitely be letting all of my friends know to stay away from this terrible establishment and their anger ridden watchdog of a bouncer.We should have gone to Texas Arizona or The Ugly Irishman instead and stuck to what we know and like.
2021-03-27,5,Saturday afternoon GO TO SPOT in HOBOKEN!! Mike and his staff are so attentive and accommodating. COVID regulations are followed throughout , food is delish and drinks are fantastic!!!
2021-03-20,1,The bouncers are so gross and entitled. Don't waste your time. I've never been treated so grossly by people.
2021-03-16,5,This was perfect for a birthday. They were so accommodating and we felt really safe during COVID- they're strict on masks and have plexiglass between the tables. The music was great, food was delicious, and workers (especially Abe!!) were super helpful. The whole atmosphere was so fun/perfect place to go with friends for a night out:) thank you again madd hatter fam
2021-03-13,1,The bar doesn't even deserve one star. A group of 8 gave a deposit for a table for a friends birthday and they were extremely rude to us and told us too bad if we couldn't get in. You would think with a reservation that they would be a bit more orderly, There was no organization and multiple parties were confused on what to do, especially those with reservations. Save your time and go somewhere else.
2021-03-11,3,Came here for brunch midweek. I was excited to try something new in Hoboken. This place really needs to get it together with their menus and pricing. Their website and the multiple menus they handed to us all conflicted with one another in both availability, specials and general pricing. Watch how you're being charged! The waitress was accommodating and the food was decent (cheesesteak and steak/eggs) which saved this place from getting 2 stars. Drinks were way overpriced for a midweek brunch ($11/mimosa and $14/margarita). We also ordered a side of eggs and they brought us another entire entree (eggs, fries, bacon and toast). We were told "it comes like that, but we will give you a discount" - what!? Willing to give this place another try, but not for a while. Seems like it could be fun to watch sports on the weekend.
2021-03-06,5,FANTASTIC SERVICE. Kelsey was our waitress and she and the rest of the staff were so attentive. If you are looking for a fun boozy brunch experience. This is it. The food was good but that wasn't the reason why we came. We came for the mimosa tower. We traveled from the UES and was worth the trek. We will be back!
2021-03-03,5,Excellent place with amazing music , ambiance  is great and the margaritas are amazing !!!
2021-02-28,5,Had a great time came for my boy Shant he's a resident dj  there, music was awesome and food was great. Had a great brunch where Noika made sure we had a great time, def coming again!
2021-02-27,1,Traveled from the Bronx to receive terrible treatment. Paid 65 dollars for an open bar, appetizers and entrees for 2.5 hours and only received two drinks within that time, not even an entree! It was a rip off! Service was horrible!!! We were also screamed at multiple times to sit down and when our reservation time was up we were yelled at yet again to leave. Then when I tried to come back in to use the bathroom the bouncer was rude and yelled at me. I will never return back here!
2021-02-27,1,I wish I can give this place 0 stars. The bouncers and security were so disrespectful and rude. I paid 65$ for an open bar when the waitress came around once in a while and I received 3 drinks by the time my 2.5 hours were up. LOLLL THEY STOPPED SERVING US AFTER 2 hrs. Then, when our reservation time was up they were yelling to get us out, I wish I was exaggerating but yes they were YELLING at my group to get out. Such a waste of money!!! Please save yourself and RUN. DO NOT GIVES THIS RIP OFF ANYMORE BUSINESS. I'm still so appalled at the treatment.
2021-02-27,5,My first reaction was wow this place is sick, from the decorations, to the lights, to the music, the vibes are insane. Noika was our server and she would bring sparklers and have the DJ shout us out consistently! Great place to celebrate honestly anything, we came in for my girlfriends birthday and it just changed our mind for how the rest of our day was going to be because we went out for a regular brunch but wanted to party all day long! Great vibes!
2021-02-27,5,Noika was an awesome waitress she made my brothers birthday a great time, brought out sparklers, bells bubbles everything it was amazing. Definitely suggest coming here for any celebration!
2021-02-26,5,The best place to go for a night out while still staying safe during the pandemic. The staff is amazing and super accommodating you go in meeting a server and will probably leave with them now being your friend! Club NYC vibes with bottle service right in Hoboken. Bottle service is the way to go for a full experience! They have theme nights that literally turn up on a Tuesday. Live DJ every night of the week. Whether you are looking for limo service or a drink bigger then your head they have it all. Not to mention yummy food that comes out quick!!! 10/10 recommended. Just remember to make a reservation!
2021-02-25,5,Came in for a couple of drinks and had an amazing  night music and service was great, Noika was our server. She was very efficient and effective! I will be back for sure. Thank you Noika!
2021-02-22,1,I have never posted a review for anything in my life, but I needed to say this because I have never been treated with such little respect in my life, and I've worked in the food service industry. While waiting in line for our reservation for our table, my friend asked to use the bathroom. The bouncers told her "to go down the street to McDonald's because it looks like she fits in more there." They also told us that "we think we're tough because we're from New York," and did not allow my cousin in. When we asked for our down payment back since one of us wasn't allowed in and it was way after our reservation, the manager and owner replied, "we don't need your money. Is this all about the money? What are you poor?" They lost out on a large that was willing to spend a lot of money and future business. If I could leave zero stars, I would.
2021-02-21,1,The owner doesn't know how to run a business... he does not enforce the time slots so large groups have to wait an hour or more beyond their actual reservation. The entire staff is confrontational when approached about this issue. We waited over an hour until we eventually decided to go home because the place smelt like vomit. They treat their customers like sh*t, I don't recommend unless you want to stand outside for over an hour (reservation or not).
2021-02-11,1,The food here is beyond nasty. I've given it three tries because I do like going here for a crazy night out.  I don't know why people eat it. By far the worst wings I've ever had - I couldn't eat them. Barely any meat, all fat and way overcooked.
2021-02-06,5,Noika was the best server!!! She catered us well as she was quick and responsive. Definitely recommend her! 10/10.
2021-02-04,2,I've always considered Madd Hatter to be one of the most fun bars in Hoboken, but my most recent experience there has just left a bit of bad taste. I completely understand how these restaurants and bars are going through an incredibly tough time right now; however, some things are inexcusable. To start, when I made my reservation, I was told there was a $75 minimum per person (I've previously had a $50 minimum there but I understand they need the money right now so ok). Then when I got there I was told it was a $100 minimum. I had said on the phone I was told $75 and they were like "sorry whoever you spoke to was wrong" ..if your own staff can't get your prices right you have an issue right then and there. Next I was told our reservation was for 3 hours, meanwhile our waitress tried to tell us it was 2 hours. I insisted if I was paying all this money I was staying the 3 hours since I already was mislead with their minimum amount. THEN, they bring us menus with no prices on them and we are told we need to buy a bottle to reach our table minimum. Ok. We pick a bottle of Tito's. Then come to find out they charged $245 for the bottle ...After we already purchased drinks and would have hit the minimum without that bottle considering they raised their prices drastically. AND to top it off when we ordered an appetizer it was so cold! Are you kidding me?! I'm sorry but if you're charging people a ridiculous amount of money then at least make sure the food is warm. It's a shame because I used to love this place, but I will gladly say I probably will not be going back after this most recent experience. They need to be more transparent with their prices and not trick customers by making them think one thing and then telling them another. Also, it's not like they are a prestige Vegas night club that they should be charging that much for ok service and cold food. Only good thing was the DJ who was awesome.
2021-02-01,5,Just ordered from here for the first time ever and everything was delicious!!Got the dry rub wings, Mac and cheese and cheesesteak.. enjoyed all of it!
2021-02-01,4,The steak mac n cheese was absolutely great! And the size was just huge - it was more than enough for me and my husband and I even had some left for a midnight snack. There was a lot of steak bites and the sauce was juicy and fatty. Unfortunately, the chocolate lava cake we took for dessert was very dry and there was well no chocolate lava in it just a little chocolateon top. It was an empty dry muffin instead of chocolate treat. Very disappointing. So mixed feelings
2021-01-31,1,Manager is an actual asshole, everything about this place is terrible, only reason why it's open is because NY is closed indoors. Not only that but the place is dirty, and doesn't follow any covid regulations!! Bad business
2021-01-26,4,Sean was the best part about this restaurant. Great service, entertaining, and fun. He told me to order a truffle cheese pizza and it was life changing. He didn't judge me when I ordered chicken fingers too. And when my friends had silly questions, he was polite and sweet. Did a great job especially given the setting of COVID19's restrictions and new ways of doing his job. I took one star off because I'm just not in love with the Madd Hatter like that.
2021-01-24,2,This place would be so much better if they didn't have such rude staff. Every time I've gone here so far they've been nothing but rude and unpleasant to their customers and money hungry.
2020-12-01,3,This place is expensive for no reason--two beers for $36.00. Geez, I might as well buy two cases at the liquor store around the corner. The staff is friendly and attentive; however, I don't think I would be stepping in here again, knowing the outrageous prices.
2020-11-29,1,Stopped by here for brunch after not being able to get a table at a few other places close by. We were greeted with a waitress who seemed like it was her first week there. Started off with the table that we were seated at wasn't cleaned properly. We were given a menu that said $2 mimosas on Saturday and Sunday- and Ofcourse me and my friends all got excited and ordered one for each. As soon as we got our mimosas, I confirmed with her that they were indeed two dollars each before ordering more. She said, yeah seems like it with what it says on the menu. Five minutes later, she came back out and said "I just confirmed with my manager And he said it's 9.50 each." I politely asked if they can adjust the bill according to what it says on their own menu, and I was told that's not possible. We ordered entrees, and vegetarian options are very limited. All I could find was the mac&cheese and would not recommend that. It looked great, but was very dry, and bland. On top of all of this, the waitresses there are walking around with lace masks- and being a physician, I know that is not safe! All in all, I will not be going back to this place and would definitely not recommend.
2020-11-23,1,A trash place where the manager has a nasty attitude and talks down to customers especially if you're a minority. The server said the manager was acting out because he was "stressed". I would never return to this disgusting place. The manager threw the menu at me and my friends. They are also trying to capitalize off the pandemic and charge $100 a person to sit inside their restaurant. Don't waste your time going here.
2020-11-09,4,Aside from our service which wasn't great, this place is a lot of fun. They have outdoor and indoor dining. My chicken wing dip was very good and piping hot. The fall cocktail I had was delicious as well. They offer cocktail towers, which I would like to try at some point.
2020-11-05,3,We walked by here, and it was the only place around that seemed lively.I only checked the rating after sitting down and ordering drinks. It was pretty low, three stars, so I didn't think it would be good. Most of the bad reviews were about service, loud music, and lack of social distancing though.The food was actually pretty good... much better than I expected, I got the hangover burger and it wasn't bad. The nachos and wings were alright and too.
2020-10-27,5,Renee is the best ! Great place and drinks ... the bartender was amazing. Dancing and smiling .
2020-10-25,2,Me and my sister came to see the vibe of this place because she wanted to see if it was a nice place to celabrate her 25th bday here. We wanted a big place that played good music mainly and did not have a budget.We explained to the manager before entering the reason why we were here and seated us in less then 10 mins. This place was big and had cool drinks but watered down (full of ice) $$$. For those wanting to know, We ordered only 2 fish bowls and 4 cups of water my bill was $200. OUR MAIN PROBLEM: DJ plays club music but you can't stand up from your chair to dance because their 1 security guard (checking the whole place by himself) will come and give you a warning to kick you out meanwhile other people were dancing from there table. The security guard kept picking at us (I thought it was RACISM). A few moments later the security comes with 2 other men (I am not sure if they had more than 1 manager) but their was one I believe he said he was the owner and cursed us out (seemed drunk to me) so professional right?! We had explain to the manager/owner that these accusations seemed unfair that they came to our table were only yelling at us meanwhile other tables were doing exactly the same things and they did not make a big deal. We ended leaving on our own. LISTEN we actually came to give you service lol never coming back here again.  There are so many other awesome places to do too!
2020-10-24,5,I'm so happy I stumbled across this place. My family I sat outside the view was good also the customer service and the food was great. A nice cocktail section my cousin had the fish bowl and I had the Long Island which was very tasty.
2020-10-21,3,The food was ok, but the service could have been a lot better. There were  some muggle games on TV which I was not too fond of. The loud music lacked strong bagpipes and backing accordion. After paying the bill I tipped in spice credits and a couple used metro cards. Advice to management:1. Please add more locking stalls to the men's room...I prefer to sit when I pee. 2. If barely anyone is watching a Gants gridiron ball game, please do not give an attitude when I request to watch Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.
2020-10-19,5,I've been coming to mad hatter since it was one republic. Never have I ever had service as great as I did today with Noika. She was attentive, mad us feel comfortable, and very knowledgeable with any food question we asked. I highly, highly, recommend asking for her to take care of you if you ever come here! PLUS she makes an AHHHHHHMAZING fish bowl!
2020-10-19,5,Noika is the best bartender. She recommended the party punch and the pizza pretzel and they were both amazing! Totally recommend this place. Also... WE ARE!!!
2020-10-19,5,Fantastic food. Amazing service. Noika is especially warm and friendly. Always come here for special occasions.
2020-10-19,5,I came here for brunch with my girlfriend and had the Buffalo chicken egg rolls as our app and it was fantastic!I also had the hangover cure burger and it was also really good, the burger was huge and delicious I had Noika as my server and she was really nice and outgoing, I would definitely come back here.
2020-10-17,1,went to mad hatter few weeks ago and tried extorting us indicating we had to spend another 100 per head when I had just gotten there for 1pm Sunday Nfl games or we had to leave. Never coming here again
2020-10-13,5,Had fun time for football Sunday night. All feels almost normal and great drinks served by  Maddie! Will be back
2020-10-10,5,Went to this bar with my friends and we got shots and and some food. The food came out fast and we had a great time! Our server Luba was the best! Very attentive and made great recommendations ! Will definitely come back!
2020-10-09,1,The host staff and "bouncers" were incredibly rude. Terrible customer service, cut me off while I was speaking, and then just walked away because they were fed up. We were told that we had an hour to dine before we'd have to leave for reservations coming in. We agreed, ordered our food, and proceeded to ask multiple times if we needed to be moving along. We were repeatedly told no, and continued ordering drinks thinking we'd be told when we needed to leave. Then out of nowhere we were told that there was now a $75 minimum per person because we made an agreement that we would be gone within an hour and we stayed longer than that. Yet nobody said a word the entire time we were at the table... Unprofessional, unclear, and no desire to return. Never have I been blatantly ignored or disrespected by restaurant staff. Will not be returning solely for how rude the host staff was. Unbelievable.
2020-10-06,1,Went there for football. we had a minimum of $75 per person to spend and was totally okay with that. once the one oclock games were over the manager came over and said its gonna be an extra $100 a head. sooo they wanted another $700 on top of our $500 bill we ordered from the 1 oclock games. he then proceeded if you guys dont want to do the $100 a head for the 4pm game you have to leave. so yeah place is expensive and then they try to extort you for $ without any warning. manager was extremely rude and dismissive. music was good...... never going there again.
2020-10-05,5,Had Ty as my waitress for Monday night football and she was attentive and overall great to have! 10/10 would recommend.
2020-10-01,5,Came for some drinks with my boys, had noika once before and we came back because she was so kind and welcoming. Anytime anyone comes I suggest you come see my girl cause she rocks!
2020-09-30,5,I have been coming to this bar for years. The customer service and the vibe in here is impeccable. Food, drinks, and our favorite server Victoria is the reason we keep coming back. If you are in the Hoboken area make sure to stop on by!
2020-09-29,5,Favorite Sunday funday spot in Hoboken. I've been here many times and never have been disappointed. Tyler is frequently our server and is always accurate and on top of our needs. Will be back soon!
2020-09-29,5,Love the pizza and the waitress is very friendly and showing good hospitality! The vibe is cool they have a dj on site and everyone is enjoying themselves here plenty of space to distance inside.
2020-09-29,1,Went out with a friend and our daughters on friday night.  The best part of the night was our frozen watermelon margaritas. I ordered the nachos without a protein and while they looked nice, it was mostly lettuce with some cheese and a couple of pieces of tomatoes and olives.  The rest of the table got an order of pretzels, an order of plain fries and chicken tenders. Our bill was $103 plus a credit card fee, not including tip. Our waitress, while she had a mask on, it was a sparkly blue MESH mask, which provided no barrier at all. It may be a good place if you're just going for overpriced drinks but in all reality, we won't be back. Hoboken has such a variety of places to eat and drink that are way better, and better value as well
2020-09-28,5,Ty is my favorite. She gives the best service and had the best time. Will come back
2020-09-28,1,The worst case of price gouging you're bound to find in Hoboken. "Any mixed drink" we found out, when we got the bill, was $14 plus tax and a charge for using a credit card! We paid CASH!! Server whispered," they're adding that on all the tabs" with a smirk. Like it's funny ripping off the public. The food is horrible anyway, so we just had drinks. So, if you want to go out with a friend for a couple of drinks, expect to pay almost 16 per drink! 2 drinks each, your tab will be $64.00 dollars plus tax and of course the "Credit Card surcharge" even if you pay CASH!!! So, a couple of drinks for 2 friends and then the tip.... about 80.00 bucks. Omfg what a Sleezeball this owner is! Go somewhere else.... anywhere!!
2020-09-27,1,I had fun here until the "partner" of the bar AKA a promoter asked us to leave because we were playing music. Our waitress was great!!!!! They gave us a hard time when we tried to pay. Don't go here if you're trying to have fun
2020-09-27,5,Sunday Funday at its finest. This place is aware of the COVID guidances and does the best job to accommodate. Thank you Noika for the top notch service!!!
2020-09-27,5,Had a great Sunday funday!! Noika was so attentive and quick with everything. Thanks to her I'll be back time and time again!
2020-09-27,1,What a nightmare. First the host promised us a table with a tv which we requested, so we wait 30 minutes and are told we were next on waitlist. Then another host (both grown men) walks up and tells us all the tables are taken and there are 100 people ahead of us and walks away. Luckily there was a manager I believe (in a white shirt) who stepped in and say we were next and gave us the table. Only good thing that happened. Then we get seated and are given what I believe to be (after working 15+ years in bar/restaurant management and hospitality) the worst server I have ever had. This ditsy blonde walks up and we politely ask to put on the NBA playoff game. She looks over with confusion and says "what?" "NBA?" "What's that?". Keep in mind this is supposed to be a SPORTS BAR!!!! So she walks over and grabs a guy with a tv remote who walks over and says "Your server tells me you guys are being annoying and rude about a game?" , before he turns around in a straight face to try to get the game on. The girls I was sitting with at first thought he was being sarcastic, until they tried thanking him multiple times for putting on the game, to which he was obviously ignoring them and annoyed he was having to change the channel. Then the blonde server comes back (keep in mind we have been sitting down for less than 3 minutes) and asks if we are ready to order food, to which we ask for just a couple more minutes. She rolls her eyes and says "You only have an hour and fifteen minutes at this table". I got up and walked out to go watch the game down the street. This place was a complete and total disaster. Covid may limit your ability to serve more people, but it sure as hell doesn't force you to hire only incompetent and rude employees...
2020-09-23,1,I left behind a very valuable and personal card that was made for me by friends for starting a new journey of life and the owner who I saw walk in before I even left told me "I just got here" which let me mention was many hours before. Then a young waiter went to go check for me about the card I left behind and told me it was nowhere to be found. So not only is this establishment full of liars, but they're also full of people who do not give a crap about you or your personal accomplishments. Another thing aside from them throwing out something so memorable to me was the fact that my spinach artichoke dip came completely cold and rubbery like it was straight out of the microwave and the shrimp tacos tasted like a freezer. This place has really gone down hill since covid has started m and they're looking for nothing but a dollar.
2020-09-18,5,The bartender we had, was Bianca! She was amazing!! Super sweet and on top of everything!!!Staff was really friendly and the music playing was very  lively! Food came out relatively quick and really good! Would highly recommend this place for anyone trying to have a good, casual time out with either their partner, friends, or themselves!
2020-09-18,3,This spot kind of reminded me of the restaurants that are on the strip in Miami, where they try to solicit you inside. I was glad I found a bar that was playing the game. The frozen margarita was kind of watery. The waitresses were nice. We ordered old bay wings and buffalo wings. They were ok. At the end the waitress overcharged my gf's credit card but told us it was a mistake.
2020-09-18,3,The food was great. Me and my partner got the trio I think it called where you get truffle fries, wings , onion rings and one more side. I gave this place 3 stars and not five because one of the waitress were rude and they weren't to pleasant. I had a drink that I had purchased else where and the way they spoke to me about it was really uncalled for so yeah it rubbed me the wrong way. The music was pretty ok kinda outdated more techno w/ a splash of hip-hop which I appreciated. The crowd was a pretty young- mature ratio. A cool little vibe. Maybe next go round I can update the review but for now no!
2020-09-12,1,This was a rip off!!! Made a reservation for my birthday, they forgot about the reservation. The number they provided to reserve was a random cell phone number. They made us spend about $50 per person with no table and a time limit as soon as we walked in! Ended up spending more than we were supposed to, waitress said absolutely nothing considering the tip was going to her. Security was overboard! Yelling to sit down when people were seated and my guests had their mask on. Music was alright, had some moments where it was good but doesn't cater to everyone inside. Completely disorganized and would never try to make a reservation again! Don't fall for it!
2020-09-12,1,I came here the other night with friends for drinks.  The server told us that we had to order food if we wanted to stay there. This is not a COVID law in Hoboken.  They were just trying to swindle us. We left and gave our business to a different bar!!!! Never going back there again.
2020-09-07,1,Food was over two hours late and very cold. They put cheese on my boyfriends food who is lactose oooooh intolerant after we noted it in the detailed section of his order. After the second time this has happened we wont be ordering again.
2020-09-07,1,Good for late night pre-covidBut I came here for food and drinks and it was not it.Ordered a frozen fishbowl for 2 and the machine was broken. So the waitress offered different non frozen optionsAlthough it sucked we drank it anyway bc we will be paying for it and did not want to complain.We then ordered food, burgers and sandwiches with waffle fries.None of us received waffle friesAnd it turns out fishbowls are $65So fuck me right Not worth it
2020-09-06,1,Worst bar and service ever! I went with a couple of my friend for a drink here and apparently just having a drink and a side of fries is not enough for bar. We went around 8:20pm and at 9 the server said that there is a limit of 75 mins at the table, which is okay. When we asked how much time we had spent there, she said we had spent an hour when we actually didn't even spend 45 mins. The server wasn't warm at all and was making fun if us not ordering anything more than just a drink. She tried to kick us out within an hour. We decided to talk to the supervisor to give him some feedback and he didn't even care what we were saying. I feel sorry for the server that we were blaming her, it's the owner himself who doesn't give a FU*K about the customers and just wants to earn money by kicking customers who aren't ordering enough. He literally asked us what did you order and when we said we got a drink and fries, he replies back, you have to order food and we usually have a minimum of $100 per person. Okay, do you mind telling us this before we sit down and order?. Yes, we're in a pandemic and businesses are struggling but that doesn't mean you disrespect and misinform the consumer and kick them out halfway while they're having their first drink.Worst experience I've had in the pandemic, I highly highly recommend to NOT go here!
2020-09-05,2,In times of COVID I understand that owners want to turn over tables quickly. However, I just spent $140 between my wife and I and we were sitting for maybe an hour when a few people, that were not our server, asked us if we wanted to-go cups or if we were ready for our check. Apparently they have 1hr and 15min table turnaround that we didn't know about. It felt rude and it was hard to enjoy our drinks while feeling rushed. So be aware of the table turnaround time.  Good fish bowl drinks ($55 each though).
2020-09-02,1,I came for my 21st with 3 out of state friends, and they said they don't usually accept those under 25 out of state. That is understandable, as there may be some people with fake IDs. However I tried to go back with my friends solely from New Jersey, and they still rejected us on my 21st. I literally cried on their property because I was heartbroken and wanted to celebrate my 21st birthday with fishbowls. The manager told me NO, even when I said I don't want the out of state people there; and my out state friends agreed to find another place to go. I was shocked they would still reject me and my group. It was my #1 place to go because i heard really good things about madd hatter and even though both my friends and i agreed to separate, i could not get in. One of the employees tried really hard to accept my group of New Jersey friends, however the manager apparently would not accept it. Disappointed is an understatement.
2020-09-02,2,I have some good and some bads. The organization in this business is not good. Was told the wait would be an hr... 2 hrs later we finally got seated. They continued to call parties after us all because of the size! As we sat down we were told we only had 75 minute limit. That was ok but i got annoyed when i got rushed toward the end but yet 1 table that was there a party of 7 was there when we first checked in to wait for a table and still there when we left constantly getting over served shots and drinks! The tables are so close to the speakers and the music is so loud you have to scream to talk to waitresses or even to the people in your party. Drinks were ok did not find them strong enough for the price they charge. Maybe once indoor dining resumes i will try and give them another chance
2020-08-30,4,Everything about this place was great, but the service. I got the Mac n Cheese burger - which was absolutely delicious! They have amazing fries btw. For appetizers - the spinach artichoke dip & chips is great and the mozzarella sticks are average.Something I do regret getting is the calamari. It was actually horrible & rubbery, do not recommend. As for the alcoholic beverages, the Miami vice and Mango fishbowls ( large slushi bowl ) were sooo good and will definitely get you lit. I recommend splitting it between 2 or 3 ppl . If you're having it on your own you probably won't finish it or won't be able to walk out of there on your own tbh. Finally, the service was really bad- and it's probably because of the automatic 18% gratuity that is included in the bill? Before coming to this spot I had been told by several mutual friends of the bad service but I had to check it out for myself... and they were absolutely right. The waitress forgot to give us water, ask what we wanted for appetizers, and forgot to bring us utensils and napkins when served the food. It's like we had to tell her how to do her job, we might as well picked up the food from the kitchen itself . The busers were more on top of it than anything. Also- when I was on my way back from the bathroom , I saw a waitress being obnoxiously loud,almost screaming about nonsense.
2020-08-20,5,Came in for some dinner and drinks, so satisfied and grateful for the great service we received. Our server Jack was so so kind, quick, and went the extra mile to make sure we had a great experience. Incredible menu, great drinks, and the experience overall was so good. Thank you JACK for making our dinner out so memorable!
2020-08-19,5,Madd Hatter is just as much fun during covid than before! Exceptional service from the staff and especially our waitress Noika. I would highly recommend trying the teriyaki wings and the buffalo chicken egg rolls. Always a pleasure to visit this restaurant!!!!
2020-08-15,1,I went to Madd  Hatter like i always do. I was waiting on my friend and the security guard sat me at a table. I sit down and my friends me she's running late . It was after I placed an order for my drink the waitress tells me there is a 75 min time limit . So I tell her my friend is coming from NY she's running late. She says it's fine she will give me extra time. Security tells me I got to go but he'll see what I can do. Then another waiter comes up to be aggressively and says I have to leave he's closing me out and I have to rewait in line, when I had about 10 min left. So told them to take my name off the list, I get a call two minutes later and I said I did not want to go back. There were other people there that were there longer and they were not pressured to leave. It was embarrassing and they didn't need three people to tell me to leave cus I was being nice about it I had already spent $50. I was trying to be empathetic due to the fact that we are in a pandemic. I used to go to Madd Hatter and would tell people to go there. I unfollowed them on Instagram and I will not longer spend my money there. This is  the second Hoboken bar that has treated me so negatively. I am not insinuating anything but I know what I felt. As a customer who goes there often I am disappointed in how I was treated. Please do better
2020-08-13,5,This place is electric. I love everything about it. Our waitress, Christina, was pure perfection. She was the most attentive and personable server I've ever interacted with. I would pay other people to come back here because of her.
2020-08-03,1,Madd Hater is a RACIST ESTABLISHMENT!! Do not give them your business!!! On 8/2/20 we (a group of 8) decided to dine at this establishment. Upon arrival we were told our table would be ready at 9:45pm. Once finally seated we then placed our orders. Our fishbowls came first followed by fountain drinks that were watered down (we did not make a big deal about it) . A short time after we received our food. Less than 10 mins after our meals came security then came over and said "you got 10 mins to get up from the tables" VERY RUDELY! He then came over a 2nd time telling us we needed to get up ! If we were on a time restraint why not tell us that before seating us!? As we proceeded to pay or bill and tip , we questioned why we were being rushed to get up & why we were notified before they agreed to seat us! Due to their curfew they would have been fined if we were still dining at a particular time, which we were unaware of. A manager (i believe) who was also very rude and nasty began to argue with us as we were leaving about our signed receipts. Telling us how things needed to be done in "America" & that we should follow what should be done . He then proceeded to call the Hoboken police . My sister then asked him why would call the police on a group of African Americans who was causing him no harm , especially with all the black killings being done by police . His response was that it was not his problem nor did he care . The owner decides to chime in but made the situation no better . The police arrived to diffused a situation the restaurant caused ! The staff at this establishment were very nasty and could careless about what was coming out of their mouths! This is not ok ! Do not support
2020-07-28,4,Real nice spot on Washington. Had the Mac and cheese burger really good. Drinks good and service even better. Will def be back.
2020-07-27,5,This place is awesome! They have the best outdoor set up in Hoboken - it's so cute (and shaded). Also, I love that they are open early for breakfast during the week. I have brought my laptop and worked from here a few times (they have wifi). Abe is great - goes out of his way to make sure you are enjoying yourself! Buffalo chicken tacos are a must!
2020-07-27,1,I was so disappointed, the food was not fresh at all, the plates was dirty! Disgusting... we didn't get even a good service ...
2020-07-24,5,Noika was a server for the night and let me tell you she was the BEST server we could ever receive. If you ever catch yourself there she's the server you want. She was attentive and cared for all of our needs (we were 8 people). Not only did she take care of us but she made my friends 21st birthday one of the best. Thanks for the service!!!
2020-07-24,5,I am so glad Noika works here. Noika is the best bartender I have ever met, super fun, chill, and respectful. Will be back every week as long as NOIKA is working!!!!
2020-07-14,5,THIS BAR IS AMAZING! ESPECIALLY THE SERVER NAMED MARIA, we love it here, she was so kind and sweet. Her service was amazing. Best customer service, I appreciate her!!
2020-07-11,5,Madd Hatter is always a good time! Music is awesome, the food is excellent all around, drinks are good and strong and the service staff is super accommodating. Abe was a great server and on top of everything. Highly recommend for brunch, lunch, dinner and late night!
2020-07-08,4,kelsey was an amazing waitress! she was very attentive, bright and bubbly! the steak appetizer that we had was amazing! AND they have outdoor tents set up ready for any weather !
2020-07-01,2,I came to this place for the first time last weekend and my experience was really poor. Our server (brunette) served us food and drinks that night and she was less focused on our table and was more focused on other people who weren't even seated by her. First of all, our meals took about 30 minutes to arrive when all I ordered was a appetizer ( shouldn't take that long to deliver) and barely checked on our table. Might I also mention that during our meal, I felt very rushed eating/drinking there as they were planning to use our table for another group of customers. Besides all that madness, I enjoyed my drink very much, it was a frozen drink with mango and tequila and it was so good...definitely would recommend that flavor and the instrument player was so great to hear too. Overall, I don't think I would return in a while and if I did it would definitely be with a different waitress.
2020-06-28,1,First time to madd hatter was not a good experience.  Omg. Gave me & my party some bullshit excuse that they couldn't seat us, but watch them seat another party of people that was larger then my party of 3. Ok  really not good service. Then we ordered our food to go get our bill & there is bullshit charges on the bill $3.00 COVID charge. WTF that got to do with me. Str8 bullshit. Then they charge us $14.99 for the wings but the menu show $12.99. Str8 bullshit again. Then a side of fries was $9.99 WTF R U SERIOUIS. Then the waitress tell us if we pay cash she can remove the $3.00 COVID charge I'm done. There scamming people. They will never see my money again. Please don't go here.
2020-06-28,5,We came to have a great time. Noika is always great and very attentive! She makes sure our food is brought on time! She is an awesome server! Great energy!! Makes people happy!!
2020-06-28,5,Noika is a waitress at mad hatter she is absolutely amazing great service caterer to your every need she brings great vibes and energy food music and drink aswell where great
2020-06-28,5,Great outdoor dining, short wait time, and great drinks! Quick service and friendly staff. I highly recommend!
2020-06-28,1,I would give this place no stars waiting more than an hour for a table for TWO. The hostess was some blonde chick and she kept saying how we were next, next where? It's ridiculous. Another couple was waiting longer than I was. There were groups of 3 and more that had NO RESERVATION and was seated, this place just cares about the bigger groups to make more money. I wouldn't recommend anyone to come here if that's all they care about. Very disappointing.
2020-06-23,2,Variety of American dishes but not far from fast food. Must be eaten quick or it won't taste good. I ordered the appetizer chicken nachos. They were dry and chicken had no flavor. Cheese was melted on making the chips stiff and dry. They had no taste. Buffalo chicken sandwich was over sauced with ranch, blue cheese is a better option with buffalo sauced chicken in my opinion. My friends chicken parm panini had too much cheese and wasn't melted completely. Outdoor vibe was great but I can see this place is mostly liked for its bar, loud music and barely dressed waitresses. Don't come here if you want to feel nourished afterward.
2020-06-12,1,Ordered through Uber eats and the "Truffle fries" came in a pool of oil. They are so soggy and so submersed in oil that they are NOT edible. Disgusting. Spent $50 for two meals and instead received plastic containers full of oil. Do not support this business.
2020-06-12,5,No line at the club yayyy. Just kidding! But Madd Hatter knows how to keep the party going despite social distancing. They have an outdoor area and a window where you can walk right up to order and a dj playing music inside. They had great to go drink specials - our green tea shots were delicious and only $5. Mimosas are $2 during the day on Saturday & Sunday. They prepared our green tea shots in a sealed to go bottle, definitely a first for that. I liked it though, it made walking around Hoboken with alcohol feel a little better. The service was great and the vibe of this place is always fun, corona can't change that! Definitely going to try a frozen margarita next time.
2020-04-04,4,So I've had myself A DAY - full on quarantine day ppl! Ordered carrot cake from here off Seamless. The gentleman working was nice enough to call me and let me know they're out. He asked me if I want cheesecake or red velvet cake. I asked what's better. He said "the red velvet is delicious." So I took it! The delivery guy was even nice enough to bring it to my door (which was doubly awesome considering I'm freezing in my PJ's lol). Opened the container to find TWO pieces and a ton of extra whipped cream which is my fav!!! Not sure if they're trying to get rid of cake - but it made me super happy. Thank you!!!!Ahh - so realized it tasted a bit off, lol. Still thankful for their kindness but cake quality was subpar :(
2020-03-10,5,Great atmosphere, amazing service, great food and drinks. Located right in the heart of Hoboken. I love frequenting back here for games, brunch, or just for a casual night out.
2020-02-20,1,I rated it 1 star cause my girl work here. This literally one of the most racist bars in Hoboken ,, it's sad I'm a paying customer and I was targeted by a bald headed security because he's a total creep and hits on my girl . A 40 year old man hating on a newly 21 year old . I've heard about the roaches and the baby mice in the place, having direct insight I hear what goes on behind the scenes and management is not only rude but racist.  I will never return to this place and I advise people to stay away. We were there waiting for an Uber and the manager "mike" was beyond rude,, it's 20 degrees outside he bust these girls asses and it's a problem they're waiting inside for an Uber. Overall one of the worst bars I've experienced besides all their flaws in the aspect of roaches and mice, management needs to work on their customer service because they are the reason many people will not be returning as myself. BUT if you enjoy baby mice and roaches this is deff you're go to !!
2020-02-07,1,place never delivered my food after hour and half wait had to get a refund by grubhub.
2020-01-25,1,The bartenders are so rude and unprofessional. I asked to close my tab and this woman couldn't find my name on the computer and just acted like that was it like "oh well! Can't find it!" Then ignored me and proceeded to serve other customers. So I guess I had to stand there and ask again? Then I walked over to a different bartender and asked him if he could find my debit card and close my tab. I proceeded to explain how rude the other bartender was since she ignored the fact that my tab wasn't being closed/card was missing. He ended up finding my debit card folded up in a receipt in two seconds. I was still mad but said I was going to leave a tip still. Then as im leaving the tip, the  female bartender I spoke to prior came over to me and yelled at me! I told her she was rude and not helpful at all. Then she yelled in my face, "bye! Bye! Bye!" And got another bartender to yell in my face the same thing. I left and I will never ever go back there. What mean and unprofessional workers they have there. It's unbelievable. Don't go there unless you're a fan of classless bartenders!
2020-01-17,1,I've gone to MadHatter a few times & i recall the final time that i went there, the wait staff didn't visit my table until i was finished.. I had to call the maintenance guy over to get in touch with the waitress to order more wings & drinks..As i was stating, the final time i was there the food made me gag..The staff/management don't know how to properly answer the phones..The WHOLE place needs to be retrained & needs new staff and management etc etc..I had to argue with 2 managers to get my money back which i finally did..I was threatened to not come back here again & i wasn't going to return there anywaze..
2020-01-13,1,Zero class. Bartenders were "twerking" on each other and acting ridiculous with the DJ. There is no real bartending here or class for that matter. Drinks & service are below average
2020-01-07,4,First things first, order the Mac and cheese bites. My friend and I almost ate the entire basket until I remembered to take a picture of it so I can load it to yelp. They are so delicious and they pour a generous amount. We had a bunch of friends coming in and out and the waitress was super cool about. This is where we went to watch Sunday Football. They have a ton of tvs everywhere in the bar and they definitely cater to the sports fans. Tons of drink specials raging from beer to margaritas. The place gets decently packed depending on the week. Then they have an upstairs VIP area where you can dance and stuff.
2019-12-31,1,This place sucks!! I wish I could give it 0 stars. First, they charge $10 cover charge to get in and in return offer you a FREE watered down drink that can only be redeemed at the bar regardless if you have a table or not. Then the waitress made me give her my debit/credit card to hold on to all night because we ordered alcohol. We ordered food and it was below average actually HORRIBLE along with 2 fishbowl drinks at $34 each which were so watered down they were probably equal to a capri-sun kid juice pouch. You would think for $34 they would have some type of liquor in them. Fast forward to the crappy service we received after our waitress walked pass our table over and over without even acknowledging us. My party of 4 decided not to leave a tip because of the lack of service and charged the bill to my debit card that the waitress had. 2 days later I see a charge for $173.30 when my actual bill was only $163.30 so the waitress took it upon herself to charge my card $10 for her tip. I called the establishment immediately and "the manager" rudely said (his exact words) "If your going to cry over $10, you could come back tomorrow and I'll give it back to you but today is NYE and I have more important things to deal with (followed by laughter)". So long story short I wouldve let it slide but now Im going back tomorrow and we'll have an even bigger issue.  DO NOT GO HERE!! The manager is rude, disrespectful, arrogant and will be dealt with.
2019-12-29,5,I am giving Madd Hatter five stars. I have never been to Hoboken before and was browsing for the perfect place to have a surprise party at.  I had a party of 50 guests to come here because it looked the most appealing, fun, and "lit" place in town to host a party. The manager, Abe, was very accommodating as he answered all of my questions efficiently regarding my party, the pricing, and different packages they have. He was extremely helpful and even hooked me up with their best VIP section to hold the amount of people we had. We did a holiday package which included an open bar for 3 hours and choice of appetizers for $50 a person which I thought was a no brainer, especially for a party. They have a ton of great packages for groups/parties that are unbeatable prices for what they offer. I liked during the party how much they attended to everyone and even myself  because they knew I was the official "host" of the party.  I guess if I really had to come up with some sort of "complaint," the only thing is I wish we got a little more food. More than half the party didn't eat anything as there just wasn't enough to feed the entire party.  However with that said, everyone including myself was extremely happy with the service and overall atmosphere of Madd Hatter. It's very well managed, staffed, clean, upbeat and more controlled than most bars. Very cool looking place too that will catch your eye even just walking past it. The food and drinks will not disappoint either! If you go to Hoboken, definitely make sure this place is your first stop. I had a really great time and enjoyed Madd Hatter a lot. 100% will be returning with friends many more times.
2019-12-26,5,Amazing wings. Such a fun place! It's become our favorite date night spot. I only go on weekdays so not  sure what the weekend crowd is like but it looks pretty  fun
2019-12-26,2,this place has a $40 card minimum at the bar.  Bruh the local Chinese takeout places don't even have a $40 card minimum
2019-11-29,5,Noika was our waitress for the whole day and she was ABSOLUTELY fantastic. she was extremely attentive to all of us and made sure all of our needs were taken care of. I definitely recommend her for anyone new to the area and looking for a fun time 5/5 stars.
2019-11-29,1,Do not go!!! What a waste of time! The staff and food are crap! 5 of us went there to grab a bite to eat and the food was terrible. The huge issue was that they charged $10 dollars for a glass of half lemonade and half ice tea. Then they charged 8 dollars for a glass of ice tea. Like what! So when we questioned it the attitude that came from the staff was unprofessional and unwilling to explain how a drink with no alcohol would cost that amount. Well needless to say they lost 5 customers. Don't waste your time!
2019-11-21,1,Went on a saturday night with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday, I am not the type to go out to Hoboken on a saturday night since i know there are far better places elsewhere nearby, but this place has a security guard on some type of roid rage & the white guy bouncer was no where better. Its alright, its a wack bar anyways, would never consider this a club. If you are looking to go to a club in hoboken on a saturday just go to Birch and save your time and money!
2019-11-20,5,I would give 10 stars if I could thanks to our waitress Nora for being so thoughtful and attentive. My girlfriends and I were out celebrating our sisterhood and my girlfriend's emancipation from a terrible ex. We walked in and Nora asked us if we were celebrating anything in particular as we were a group of six. We shared with her that we were celebrating sisterhood and freedom. We started off with Captain Crunch shots, Irish Car Bombs, and Salted Caramel tinis. We also had the appetizer pick 3 combo of Thai wings, nachos, and quesadillas. The food was great. The drinks were great. Nora was AWESOME! She was attentive, friendly, and very kind. At the end of the night she brought out a shot and a roman candle for my friend in honor of her emancipation. I hope she knows just how much that one small gesture totally boosted my friend's mood after a tough emotional week. Thank you Nora for your thoughtfulness, very much appreciated. We will definitely be back for another awesome night of shots and shenanigans!
2019-11-19,2,My first experience in a popular bar was graded a low C minus.  The company, music and football game kept my interest.  The VIP Party Package was a joke.  Seventy five dollars per guest was supposed to include elite roundtrip transportation, 4 hour open bar, five platters of food (to share) and champagne.  We got 2 platters of food; one which we had to beg for and a hostess who was unenthused about her job.  To top the night off, our transportation never returned and an Uber was called.  Six adults were packed in a small SUV like sardines!  Never Again! :(
2019-11-01,5,Charlotte was fantastic!!!! Highly recommend coming here for a bite to eat - the food was great and the service was even better
2019-10-30,1,Just got a delivery of 1 app and a cheeseburger; with the burger never showing up and whoever I spoke to at the Madd Hatter telling me it's the delivery apps problem.  The delivery app they use might offer me a refund after '3-4 days a review'.Lousy.
2019-10-29,1,Wish I could give this sad excuse of an establishment 0 stars. Purchased tickets for their alleged Halloween party only to be stuck outside on a line for what would have been 2 hours (had we been stupid enough to wait). The bouncer let us know that even though we spent money on tickets, that had no jurisdiction in determining when our group would get in. He let us know that the wait would be 1-2 hours (???). Do you think we would have purchased tickets to stand outside for hours on end? After attempting to wait with no movement of the line, we went to Tally-Ho, the bar next door without any issue. When contacting Madd Hatter about this issue, it took them days to get back and once they did they explained the "party" was put on by Eventbrite and they had no say in the matter in terms of refunds. Shouldn't you know who you are contracting? Do you want happy customers? Clearly Madd Hatter doesn't have their customers best interest at heart. They just took our money and called it a day. My suggestion for future customers? Take your money and flush down the toilet because that's the same thing as attempting to go here. Do that and you won't have to stand out in the cold.
2019-10-26,1,I wish I could give this place 0 stars. I came with a group of 15 people that ALL PAID $20 ONLINE. We waited 35 minutes and the line never budged, although every single person in that line paid $20 to get in. A friend got to the front and was denied after showing she paid online. A fucking scam. And they won't refund anyone who paid and didn't get in. Fuck this place they're scammers and don't give a shit about their customers. Thank you to tally ho for getting our whole group in immediately. Even the bouncers at mad hatter said it didn't make sense but it was out of their control. 15 of my friends got scammed out of $20 each and there were many other people in line that felt the exact same way. Do the right thing and refund every person that was denied. I've worked in bars before and if you're going to charge, charge at the fucking door if you can't let everyone who PAID ONLINE in.
2019-10-26,1,Shit service, messed up the check 3 times, took forever to seat us with our reservations in an empty restaurant... waitress spilled drinks on me. My FRIENDS were not impressed. -2 stars. Save yourself the trouble go somewhere else.
2019-10-19,3,Drinks are not that well prepared! Went for the $35 fishbowl drink and it didn't even get me tipsy, it maybe had 4% alcohol! Service was alright!
2019-10-15,1,Inept service compounded by an unfriendly staff. Food ranged from mediocre to cold and awful. This low quality service happened with next to no other customers in the bar. One of the least enjoyable brunch experiences I've had.
2019-10-05,3,It's a mash up of a sports bar, night club, and a Jersey shore experience. I passed by on a Sunday Afternoon because they had pop music pumping through the doors. Inside there is a huge bar, with cute young waitresses walking around, and tv screens all over the walls playing sports games.The bartender was very nice, I think her name was Lia. They also serve food and have a have a live dj on Fridays and Saturdays from what I hear. I stopped by a second time on a Saturday but still didn't catch the dj.Their drinks are a bit pricey running around $12+ and the bottle service runs around $300, which is a bit too much when other lounges nearby have bottle service starting around $150. Nevertheless, if you like fish bowls, good music, and want a little of everything then this is a solid spot!
2019-10-01,4,Service was good.  Our server was very nice.  Drinks were kept full and our family was free to hang out while we waited for our Airbnb.   Fries were great. Wings were great.   Soup was very good.  Philly cheese steak not to our liking.
2019-09-30,1,Came here on a Saturday night, waited on line for 20 minutes to get in. Cover charge was $10 a person but they give you a drink each, which sounded fair. Went up to the bar and was told that the drink ticket only covered certain drinks, this was never mentioned at the door but ok. Ordered 2 rum and cokes which were mainly soda and in a small cup. The bartender was terribly rude with everyone that approached him. He even flagged over a bouncer to escort a customer out simply because she was asking for clarification on her bill. The girl wasn't being rude, loud, or aggressive. Totally unnecessary. The music was also terrible so, we had our one drink each and left. Waste of time and money!!
2019-09-27,5,Great weekend bar.  Sunday's are crazy, especially for giants games.   Manage the customers well, and don't let it get too crowded.
2019-09-24,5,This is probably my favorite bar/restaurant in Hoboken. I went for Taco Tuesdays and had this wonderful server. I think her name is Yurrisa. She is super awesome and funny! Absolutely loved the service she gave me. Tacos were delicious and great drinks!
2019-09-20,5,I'm having a blast at Madd Hatter in Hoboken NJ  I'm in love with the atmosphere, drinks shall I repeat drinks it's not weak made with everything fresh. The staff is very pleasant and friendly. A must to check out.
2019-09-19,5,Great all you can eat wings on Thursdays! Great atmosphere and NFL games always on. Definitely worth going to
2019-09-15,5,Madd hatter is a great place for fun with friends! Great atmosphere. The food was great! My friends and I got the wing platter and loved it ! Highly recommend for football Sunday's
2019-09-12,5,Wow! This place is fun! The food was great (I ordered a salmon strawberry salad). The atmosphere is incredible. Can't say enough about this place! Definitely check it out if you are in the Hoboken area!!
2019-09-10,1,Sketchy ass place. Be aware because the waitress there scams your credit card. I went there for drinks and even though the service was incredibly slow we gave our waitress a nice tip and she decided to add her own on top of that onto the bill, which is illegal. If you use your credit card here please check your bank account because this waitress basically gave herself a 40% tip ! Not okay and never coming back here ever again.
2019-09-08,5,Always had a good experience at Madhatter. Food is great and the service is amazing. Always a good time on Sunday Funday.
2019-09-08,1,Went here going out for the night to celebrate a friend's birthday. After buying drinks and staying for the music, a guy started to pick on my friend calling her ugly and shouted homophobic slurs at my boyfriend who was standing up for her. The bar security came over, quickly removed our party, and did not do anything to protest the foul and outdated slurs of the other guy.Do not waste your time on this place which allows homophobic exclusion to contribute to their reputation. If I were the manager, I would seriously take some time to reflect on how to support the staff to understand identity and diversity in 2019.
2019-09-03,5,Beautiful & tasty cocktail  before summer is over , cant wait to comeback here  , i had an amazing day , thanks  for everything
2019-08-31,5,one of my favorite bars in hoboken! best bar food & all the workers are super friendly. definitely going to be one of my regular spots now!
2019-08-30,4,Sure Im a fan - The first time I came in a few years ago I sat at a table not greeted for 10 min so I leftCame back this year (2019) and had an AMAZING waitress!  SUPER knowledgeable and accommodating.  It was LATE and she was plesant and helpful - not rushing us at all.Food was good - we had wings and some rice thing in a pineapple (So fun!)
2019-08-30,1,This place is a rip off!  They charge $21 for a pitcher of sangria that only serves two glasses and $16 for a LIT!  Will not be coming back.
2019-08-29,4,Better food than you would expect and a pretty awesome brunch/football atmosphere!
2019-08-25,5,Vanessa is the most attentive server I've ever had. The most inviting and welcoming person I've ever met. Will keep coming back just for her!
2019-08-24,5,Place was great! The steak baguette was Amazing! And our server Vanessa was great! Definitely will be back!
2019-08-24,5,Noika took care of the gang. Hella props. I wish she was there every time I needed an ice cold teddy bruski. Much love shawty. Stay pimpin
2019-08-17,3,it's like a night club. service was great, beer could be colder, and the buffalo chicken dip was subpar.
2019-08-16,4,Okay.  So the ambience is good.  It's usually quiet during the week unless they have drink specials.  Weekends are usually packed.The food isn't bad.  It's bar food so nothing to brag about.  I had the honey sriracha quesadilla which was just okay.  Don't expect gourmet but it's good if you're hungry and need a snack.The drinks are a little watered down.  My friend and I split a pitcher of sangria once and there wasn't very much alcohol.  I usually stick with beer when I come here.The music is mixed.  They play mixed decades.  It's sort of hard to know what kind of crowd they want to attract.  The lighting is cool and fun on the weekends.Service is okay.  Some bartenders are nicer than others.  There are also tv screens all over the bar and an area where you can host a private party.  It's not bad.  Nothing special, but fun.
2019-08-11,4,The food, music, and ambiance was great. The service could've been better/more responsive. They were the only restaurant/bar on the block that was lively
2019-08-10,2,Extremely disappointed with my experience at Madd Hatter. The only positive is that the restaurant itself is pretty nice - indoor and outdoor seating and plenty of TVs. I imagine it'd be a fun atmosphere on a game day.BUT, brunch is an absolute no go. Our waitress took our drink orders. She came back after 20 minutes with no drinks and asked for our orders. We were a group of 5 and ordered 3 appetizers (wings, mac & cheese bites and pretzel sticks) and various entrees. 20 minutes later... still no drinks. When they finally came out, we immediately asked for another round knowing it'd take very long. Finally, food started coming out but it was not our appetizers - two entrees and one app came out! Then a few more started trickling out and wings was the absolute last thing to hit the table. All the food was tasteless and disappointing - the burgers were just like McDonalds (thinnest patties I've ever seen). In the middle of all of this, we saw all of the staff joking around. Between bartenders taking snapchats, putting on makeup, etc., no wonder why no drinks were coming out! Our table couldn't stop laughing.I definitely will not be back here.
2019-08-01,2,Service is slow, they take a surcharge on credit cards, and they don't give you the advertised promotions unless you challenge them on the bill.  Also, when we entered, the music was playing at a loud but tolerable level.  Midway during our visit, they decided to turn the music up so loud that we had to shout at each other to talk.  The restaurant was less than half full.  +1 star for the multiple TVs.
2019-07-28,4,I had the Citrus Shrimp. Shrimp were a good size and it came like a mixed veggie fried rice. I was surprised how good the flavors were. We had a good server who was very attentive. I recommend for a good late night meal.
2019-07-26,4,The variety of music played at this bar definitely develops and brings a good and special vibe that acconpanies the bar. The bartenders and waiters are the best. To single one out, waitress Jazzlyn is a darling and fun. Her personality is ohhh!!! so amazing
2019-07-26,5,I love this place. Good spot to have drinks with friends. I recommend it! Location is perfect too located next to bunch of food places. I highly recommend it!
2019-07-24,5,Live this place! Always great atmosphere and fun people! Especially great for sports events! I def recommend to sit at the bar! Claudio is the best bar keeper ever! His energy and client service is outstanding! Mixes nice cocktails while keeping up with the crowd! Can't wait to go again! Good to have a fun spot like Madd Hatter still in Hoboken!
2019-07-23,5,Awesome bar with the best bartender ever! Ask for Claudio by name and you are guaranteed not to be disappointed!
2019-07-23,4,great atmosphere, food is great also and staff are all very friendly . Claudio favorite bartender makes great drinks and can always make you smile when your having a bad day.
2019-07-12,5,Noika was are server and she was Awesome! Would recommend this spot! Oh,also great drinks great drinks!
2019-07-12,5,Noika was our server and she was super attentive and friendly! Excellent service! We enjoyed the lunch menu options and my kids loved the kids burgers. The Cobb salad was delicious and very large portion. The atmosphere was inviting and fun! We sat on the patio for a few hours and it was very pleasant.
2019-07-11,5,All I can say is wow, best food, drinks and night life on a Thursday night. Also we had the best server Noika, she was so sweet and energetic. Awesome spot !
2019-07-11,5,This was my first time eating at Madd Hatter but it definitely won't be my last. The food was delicious and plentiful, the drinks were on point nicely mixed. The servers and staff were very nice and attentive. I want to give a special shoutout to Abe, Doug and the wonderful Jazz.
2019-07-11,4,We came here on a Sunday for an early dinner and was not disappointed. They were giving out free drink vouchers at the door and there was a dj playing the latest hits. They had an extensive list of beers. I ordered the Mexico bowl and my husband got the pepperoni pizza. Food was definitely better than I expected. No complaints! Good staple to the neighborhood.
2019-07-09,4,I was pleasantly surprised by my delivery experience from Madd Hatter on July 4th. The food came within 30 minutes, as quoted - I guess everyone was probably at a barbecue instead of ordering food. I was a bit iffy about this place since it didn't have glowing reviews, but Seamless had a 25% off your first order, so I gave it a shot and I'm glad I did. We ordered the philly cheesesteak panini, Italiano burger (salami, pepperoni, fresh mozz, tomato sauce), and chicken bacon ranch pizza. The philly was pretty terrible. The description said it was shaved steak, but it was more like strips of flavorless steak, and there wasn't a lot of it. It was also served on this weird pita bread. If this is how all of their paninis are, I wouldn't try any of the other ones. On the flip side, the burger was actually very good. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and it wasn't too oily. The pizza was surprisingly good too, for a non-pizzeria. But just a warning, it doesn't really taste good the next day so I guess you'll just have to eat the whole pie at once. I wouldn't mind trying some of their other pies. The Hangover Burger sounds really good, albeit heavy (stuffed with bacon, american cheese, ham, sunny-side up egg, and hash brown). Maybe I'll stop in for brunch next time!
2019-07-05,3,Clean venue, good happy hour prices. The food was a bit cold when it came out & it took awhile to get served but I've been there before and its always a good time.
2019-06-28,5,Thank God you have a bartender like Lauren, cause all the country music made us want to leave. Change that lame ass music! YEEEEEEHAW
2019-06-17,5,By far the BEST spot in Hoboken!!! Planning your birthday can be tough sometimes but Mike and his team made it so easy and seamless. They have amazing birthday deals that you definitely don't want to miss out on. Everyone there treated us with so much respect and really made us feel special. Thanks again for making my 25th so memorable! :)
2019-06-16,1,When I arrived the waitress never came over I had to flag someone who worked there to take my order. I order the mojito pitcher which was extremely small and full of ice. We only got 2 drinks from that pitcher for $21! The cups the waitress gave us were disgusting and dirty, when I asked for new ones she brought them out and said they were just washed but still came out dirty. Despite the waitresses politeness the food and service was subpar. Definitely a disappointing experience will not be going there again .
2019-06-08,1,I give this place one more year and they're done...we walked up to the hostess stand and the girl saw us, made eye contact and walked away. I looked at my group and was like ummm should we leave? Do they not want us? A bus boy went and grabbed the girl who walked away and goes "oh hi can I help you? " yea you can, I'm trying to give you money!!! 25 minutes to get drinks, bar was empty and she claimed they got "backed up" didn't even bother ordering food. Bring back 1Republik!!!!!!
2019-06-06,1,I was really disappointed at this bar....my friends and I went to watch the soccer champions final game at this so called sports bar and they told us that they cannot put the volume on the TV because they had the music on.....how in the hell you watch a soccer event with no sound ?????? Especially soccer ..unreal..never again....
2019-06-01,4,I went here for brunch with one of my friends. Their drinks are super good and strong! Their brunch menu was okay. When I do come here at night I always get their taco salad! This salad is so bomb! I hope they will never take it off the menu!
2019-05-30,3,Had lunch here yesterday ordered truffle fries and chicken quesadilla. Wasn't impressed the fries had no truffle taste and the quesadilla well I wasn't sure you can have a tasteless quesadilla. Everything  just didn't taste like it was made right there and then like it wasn't fresh ingredients you would think they would make their own salsa and let's not forget the quack was not included.
2019-05-25,1,Just got out of the hospital with food poisoning from this place. All three of us had it. The food was sub par, the items promised weren't delivered and then we all spent the day in the ER. WILL NEVER ORDER THIS AGAIN.
2019-05-24,1,The ambience and theme of Mad hatters is good but the reason to give 1star rating is:We asked for a Mojito pitcher which came with literally only ice in a small jug and we could hardly fill 3 small glasses with it.Hence we asked for another one without ice and the waitress gave us the pitcher filled: 1/3rd of the jug size.When asked, she says that's how we serve if asked without ice.I have been to many places and this was the first time I have got this experience.  Not sure if this is a trend nowadays but this is no way to dupe us.
2019-05-23,1,Asked for waters, took over 5 minutes for the girl to come back (mind you it was extremely hot outside and we were all dying to thirst) when she finally comes back she doesn't even have waters she just brings 2 out of the 4 alcoholic beverages that we ordered, 1 being completely wrong. I asked for a vodka with iced tea and she came back with a completely clear drink and when I told her what I ordered she said "that isn't it?"... as if she's never seen iced tea before. We then had to ask her again for waters bcus she never brought them. Then the appitizers come out and she never brought us plates to eat them. My boyfriend orders a second beer as he's coming close to the end of his first one, she comes over and gives him the second beer and completely just takes away his first beer that still had a quarter of beer left. Then the food comes out and my burger was completely wrong. Finally, I ask for a white sangria and she brings me a red one. This was the most horrible experience I've ever had.
2019-05-09,5,I've been a regular costumer at this spot since 2015 so I know the crowd! Nice sport bar, I do understand the security rules but once you get inside enjoy the ambience, nice bartenders great beers selection, awesome brunch and the best place to enjoy the football season!
2019-05-04,4,Samary the bartender is excellent!  She really loves her job & it shows . Great drinks!!
2019-05-04,2,The mojitos taste like seltzer water, the spinach dip was not as expected. Personal pizza pretty good and the grilled panini was ok.
2019-05-02,3,Update!! They now have a great lunch deal and a huge food menu. I only give it three stars because the service was extremely slow and the food came out wrong.
2019-04-30,3,Came here on a Saturday night around 1030. Had to pay a cover (10$ but you get a free drink), fine. This cover was cash only which was a little inconvenient. And THEN at the bar the bartender tells me there's a $20 minimum. Just felt like they were trying to get you to spend money which was off-putting.  The music was good but the crowd was a little off.  There were people on dates, groups of moms, and groups of college kids.  Not sure what kind of vibe they're going for but it was a little all over the place.  Won't be running back to this place.
2019-04-24,1,Horrible customer service. The rudest staff I've ever encountered. Ordered food and both orders were messed up. And when I politely asked to situate the situation, I get more attitude. I paid for my two sodas and left and didn't pay for my food. And not once did they try to accommodate me or even apologize. I won't be goin there even if the food was free.
2019-04-23,5,Amazing excellent service !!! The manager is extremely friendly and our waitress was very welcoming and accommodating. We will definitely be returning!!!
2019-04-19,5,A favorite place of mine with a great happy hour! John goes over and beyond for the patrons. If you want a goodplace to go on a Friday after work, go to Madd Hatter!
2019-04-19,5,Best bombs in town! Manager really made happy hour a good time with a couple of delicious Green Tea Shots on the house
2019-04-18,1,My bf and I came here in search of wings, and happened to stumble across AYCE wing night (Thursday) which was great in the moment. We ordered wings and beer, wings came quick - beer seemingly took forever. Wings were decent, but unfortunately the poor service will probably make us not return. We ordered three pitchers of beer while we were here and had to hassle the wait staff constantly to get them; we waited at least 20 mins for the first one and it got worse from there. This place is also the land of gold chains, muscle T-shirts, and lip fillers. If you come here and you're not a meathead guido or a ratchet girl, you're going to stand out. Like others have complained here, they also charged us more than the price on the menu for beers (and a credit card surcharge, what the f*#% is that about?!) Only pro is the people watching and the self esteem boost you get from watching the degenerates who frequent here.
2019-04-15,5,Came on a Monday late-afternoon with a friend from out of town. The bartenders are very friendly, ambiance was great and they had awesome music playing. Great happy hour specials and food was awesome!
2019-04-13,1,Mimosas are a great price if you like yours as orange juice with a splash of champagne. We knew we were in trouble when the most tasteful thing on our burgers was the bun. Can't remember having a more bland burger ever. Not only that, watch out as they charge you a credit card surcharge which you don't realize is going to happen until you get the credit card slip to sign. They don't mention on the menu, they don't mention it on the itemized bill you first get it. They sneak it in.  Shameful. Gave it one star instead of zero because the wait staff was really good and attentive.
2019-04-12,1,Went last night for a networking / mixer party.  The group that was hosting it had bought the restaurant for the night, but there were two people outside who'd not bought tickets complaining that they came there "every Thursday" and were demanding to get in.  The bouncer let them in, despite not having a ticket, and they took up one table in an already extremely overcrowded scenario.The bar itself is smaller than it would appear from outside.  Dark, loud, unpleasant.  My feelings about the mixer being awful aside, the service was slow, even for how crowded the place was.  I'd ordered the hangover burger to eat... it was honestly nothing special.  Burger was semi-stuffed with cheese, hash browns were on the base of the bun and creating an awful soggy situation, the fried egg on top was absolutely murdered and inedible.  Fries were terrible, and the "garlic Parmesan" topping was three little shavings of parmesan, and some greasy garlic butter on maybe two fries. The manager came over after I'd given up eating after half a burger.  Guess the waitress was concerned since I hadn't cleaned my plate.  Very confrontationally asked me why I didn't like my food.  I explained that the burger simply wasn't that good.  It wasn't bad, it wasn't good.. it was just okay.  Told him the fries were a disgrace as well.He begrudgingly (I didn't ask him to) comped my bill, but again was very threatening when he said "I'll take care of the bill, you just take care of your waitress."Overall an extremely unpleasant experience.  This place doesn't deserve peoples' business with service this awful.
2019-04-05,5,Food was great! Had the nachos and the spinach artichoke dip and they were both delicious! Cool space to hang out too and the music is awesome.
2019-04-03,1,I would give this place a 0 if it was possible. I went for a birthday party and the bouncers at the door looked at my sisters ID and said it was a fake when she's 22 and she gave them other versions of identification to prove it is legit and they threatened to call the police and kicked us out. This place discriminates or something else they were unbelievable. Do not recommend this place.
2019-03-31,1,One of the worst experience. Me and my wife visited with another couple yesterday evening (03/30/19) at 6.40 pm. I think we were on table # 22 and our server was #4 'S-Nichelle'. It took her 20 minutes to take our order for drinks, refused to take order for food saying that she will come back soon. Took her 20 more minutes to bring drinks - still wast't prepared to take food order. We had to hunt her down by waving to multiple servers. Finally took food order - something as simple as Nachos. No  food to be seen for 20 more minutes. Requested her twice to cancel food order and bring check since it was taking long. Instead she brought food in one bowl without any silverware/dishes/napkins. We had to take silverware from nearby table. The same server was providing excellent service to two young ladies who came after us. We left totally disgusted without adding any tip with note on the check "very bad service'.  This server was determined from beginning to give us hard time probably because we were brown skinned group or she just didn't like us. Please do not go to this place if you are brown skinned. My wife reported the matter to someone in front but he was clueless about what to do
2019-03-30,2,Food came late, waiter not much responsive, small and simple portions and relatively high price.
2019-03-29,1,Place is a joke from hell of u looking for a fight this is the place to go.  They are racists trust me
2019-03-26,1,Don't advertise brunch if your establishment can't handle it!! I booked the "Wonderland Brunch" for my friends and I for my birthday. I was extremely disappointed to say the least. I had spoken with the event planner a week prior who was very nice. She told me what packages were offered in which I picked one. She stated that there could be three different pitchers of drinks at the table - the reason being is so that the waitresses did not have to keep running back and forth & we wouldn't have to wait for our drinks. - Well that definitely was not the case! The waitress brought us one drink of each option (3 drinks even though it was a table of 6) stating they don't do pitchers anymore and that I was given the wrong information. Needless to say, we had to wait a very long time to get the additional 3 drinks and then more rounds each time. Rewind to when we first arrived- someone pointed to a table, "That's your table" so we sat ourselves. After waiting for at least 15 minutes, no one came up to our table to help us - we didn't even have menu so my friend had to get up and get them herself! After waiting another 10 minutes for water, my friend had to get up herself and go to the bar to get a pitcher of water for our table. The service was extremely unacceptable. Honestly everything that could go wrong did. The menu's were sticky, the cups were dirty and the water tasted like it came straight from a sewer. When we ordered our appetizers and meals we specifically asked if they could come out separately and the waitress confirmed. Well that didn't happen!!!! The food was okay but would of been better if it wasn't cold since we had to manage to eat everything at once. (Biggest pet peeve) We explained our concerns with both the waitress and the manager, but there was no point of that since we got no reprieve off the bill or any type of apology. The music was great and I think it would of been a great place to celebrate my birthday if the service was acceptable. I don't understand how a restaurant can advertise this big of a brunch if they clearly can't hold themselves up to their expectations. My friends and I will never be returning.
2019-03-26,1,I'm not from Hoboken and I went to MADD HATTER for the first time just to have money stolen from me. (150$ cash) I immediately consulted the manager about this matter, he LIED & said he would check the footage for me & let me know if he was able to find it so I can file a police report. He DID NOT. & after calling multiple times about this issue, I had no choice but to take that LOSS.
2019-03-25,1,My friends and I were so excited to try the Sunday "Wonderland Brunch" after seeing it promoted on Instagram, but we were disappointed to say the least. After being seated for 20 minutes with no menus, we finally went up ourselves to get our own, and we managed to flag down a waitress. We were told the the brunch included 3 pitchers for the table, but apparently we were given the wrong information. Instead of being told by the waitress we wouldn't be getting pitchers, she brought out 1 Bloody Mary, 1 mimosa, and 1 margarita for a table of 6. By the time she came back with the other 3 drinks, we were all ready for another round and to order our food. We specifically asked for the appetizers to come out first and not have everything brought out at one ti, and after waiting another 30 minutes all of our plates were brought out at once. The food wasn't horrible, but we couldn't even enjoy it because we were trying to eat a little bit of everything while it was still hot. It was an extremely disappointing day and a horrible way for my friend to spend her birthday.
2019-03-17,5,Very well ran bar. The bartenders are very attentive and the management is on point I like how if you pay a cover it comes with a drink. I found that to be fair. I didn't try the food but what I saw it looked good. Compared to other bars in Hoboken this place stands outs. Definitely good place to go on a Friday or Saturday night.
2019-03-17,1,Was here for St. Patty's day and this place is so unclean. We had a booth seating and a full trash bag is sitting right behind us leaking to the point where the entire floor is wet. The staff comes to mop the floor and leaves a broom and dust pan right next to our seat. The bathrooms are disgusting! Nasty floors, no toilet paper and clogged toilets. This place is worse than a college bar. So disappointed in the way these people take care of this place. Worse than a college dive bar.
2019-03-15,3,Can't rate the service or food. Came on a Friday for their brunch, which their menu online says is served 7 days a week, and was told they only serve it on weekends. I even showed the waitress the menu on their website and her response was 'we did, until recently'. I came to try the french toast, since it wasn't an option, we left.
2019-03-13,1,I came here despite the reviews because It was unlimited wings and tacos. GUESS WHO GOT FOOD POISONING??????? Stay far away.
2019-03-10,3,I'm not sure where to start, however, this place is unorganized. They just want young kids here to spend their money on brunch food that is subpar and on strong drinks. Our waitress placed margaritas and mimosas on our table then 10 minutes later wanted to remove the margaritas off the table because they weren't touched yet. I'm not a waitress, but I know you don't do that. To be completely honest, if you are a fresh grad and just moved to Hoboken this might be the place for you. However, if you over 25+ then this is not the place to brunch unless you want to relive those good ol' college days. To add the topper, our waitress gave us dirty plastic cups, we noticed the new set was also sticky. Do you guys clean cups? Who even reuses plastic cups??? That's completely unacceptable and not wanting people to come back.
2019-03-04,1,Was with a group of friends last night. They put a group of women out. They were not loud, rowdy, idk the situation but it did look fishy. I couldn't stay after that I felt uncomfortable. Spoke to the group outside and they said it was racially motivated. Idk how true that was but I got a bad vibe when I saw the group being forced out.
2019-02-27,1,We made Sunday brunch reservations at Mad Hatter as they were the only place that would take a reservation for 13 people. We walked in at 1pm - the windows were blacked out, all tables were covered in Christmas lights, every TV was playing Alice in Wonderland (I get it... there's a theme) and a DJ is blasting music. It was near impossible to have a conversation due to the noise and we were the only table in there. As we ordered drinks, each glass came out dirtier than the last. We left after that because I could only imagine how the food would come out. Even if LSD and odd themed bars are your thing, Mad Hatter is dirty and smells like stale beer from the night before.
2019-02-21,2,Went for a night of "live phish". Was anything but. They cheaped out and tried to stream it illegally. Didn't  work$10 well drinks on a weeknight in Hoboken is a joke. Do yourselves a favor and venture out:(
2019-02-12,5,originally i was drawn in by the lights lol i'm a sucker for christmas lights year round ! fun arcade games and photo booth.. bartender was cute and friendly even gave me change to play pac-man with my friends !definitely a fun spot to hit on a bar crawl
2019-02-10,1,Where do I begin. Other than myself and my best friend, there were about 7 other people there. As the night went on, I discovered why the place was so empty. I ordered coconut shrimp and my friend ordered wings and fries. My coconut shrimp was served with ranch sauce (that's a first) and my friend's fries were brought out 20 minutes after her wings, and ONLY after she made a complaint about the wait time. 1 hour and 20 minutes before closing, the bouncer came to our table to inform us that it was last call and that the bartenders wouldn't be serving anymore drinks in 20 minutes. Okay fine. Fifteen minutes after that, the same bouncer came back to our table and said that the entire place would be closing in 20 minutes. A whole 45 minutes before what's advertised on their website, the lights were turned on, and again, the SAME bouncer began to walk around in circles, clapping his hands, yelling, "Alright everyone, time to go. It's been real. Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go!"...literally kicking everyone out. When the waitress brought us our bill, I asked her what time they closed. She responded, "2 am". So then I proceeded to question why we were being thrown out 45 minutes earlier, and she stated that it was because they were "slow". Not sure what the lack of business has to do with the paying customers that were present, but whatever. I asked to speak to a manager. He approached our table and I immediately expressed my concern with the customer service and the misleading information on their website, and he stated that it's because they have to clean the kitchen/bar with a "chemical" and they needed everyone out. He continued to say that it's a procedure they do once every few months and today just happened to be one of those days. So I told him that the waitress told me something totally different and that they need to get on the same page with regards to the lies they tell the customers. He didn't seem too apologetic and only offered us free drink passes in a weak attempt to apologize for his bouncer's horrifc behavior towards customers. I threw out those free drink passes and will NEVER go there again. It's a ashame because 1 Republik was a phenomenal bar. They need to fire everyone and start over if they ever want to make the amount of money that 1 Republik made. They don't even deserve one star.
2019-02-02,5,Good food and a great going out spot for the whole gang. My bartender Kim I think took care of us all night and made sure we always had drinks and were having fun. Two Hoboken thumbs up
2019-01-06,1,We went to watch the NFL games (playoffs) & grab dinner. It wasn't even that crowded but it took us 20 minutes to flag down someone to order drinks. The club music was so loud it was unbearable! The food was over cooked & there wasn't enough fries with each order. Oh and mighty expensive! 2 main meals (burger & fish n chips), 1 app, and 4 mixed drinks = $120!! Never again.
2019-01-01,2,I had such high hopes for this place as this was their first New Year's eve but I was kind of disappointed. We waited outside to get in because there was a guest list for those who purchased NYE tickets in advance. I had bought 3 gold tickets for an open bar for $160 each initially and then a 4th ticket for a 4th friend who decided to come. The gold level was sold out so I had to purchase a platinum ticket which was a little more. I didn't mind, but when they checked the list at the door I was given an attitude by the door girl who said there were only 3 tickets in my name. I had the confirmation email and the statement charge on my card so I offered to show her and she basically said "well it doesn't matter because you only have 3 tickets." I'm like "okay but I BOUGHT 4." After a little going back and forth the bouncer told her it probably didn't carry over to the list and to just write it in. The bouncers were probably the only good part of the experience. The inside was nice and festive and there were party favors and hats, noise makers, etc. Purchasing a premium top shelf open bar for five hours seemed like an awesome idea. Shots were not included which was not a big deal at all. However, if I'm paying $160 for TOP SHELF I would expect to receive it. Our first couple drinks were okay but at one point my friend turned to me and said the bartender poured water into her drink. I didn't see it so I ordered a few drinks with my other friends and watched as the bartender filled the cup halfway with vodka cran and then took the WATER GUN and filled the rest up with water. I would expect that on a dollar beer day but not a premium open bar for $160. Overall we just didn't see the whole experience as worth the money and it was pretty disappointing.
2018-12-31,1,Worst bar to go to in Hoboken. They let in toons of underage kids and overcharge and steal from customers. Don't got here, they suck.
2018-12-09,1,Excruciatingly loud. Could not have a conversation or really enjoy the atmosphere, unfortunately.  Seems like a nice place, but couldn't stay.
2018-12-07,5,Great bar, love the vibe! Love coming for Sunday funday and happy hour! Great specials!
2018-12-03,2,Recently went there for football Sunday and was extremely disappointed. The food there was very good no complaints about that. The menu had a wide variety of items and the specials were great. We ordered several different apps with the Buffalo chicken egg rolls being my favorite. They were cooked to perfection and the portion was very generous. However, the reason why I'm giving this such a low review is the service was absolutely terrible. The waitress didn't care and seemed miserable that she was working. Also, the food runner brought out the appetizers and spilled two drinks on the table and did nothing. He not clean them up, apologize, or offer to replace them. The place was not very crowded so I can't even imagine how much worse this could have been. We ended up leaving at halftime and going somewhere else; safe to say we will not be coming back.
2018-12-02,5,Last night was a great experience starting from texting my reservation for a table with Mike, to getting the perfect seat to watch the boxing match.After looking at the menu wings and steak tacos with the mango margarita was the way to go.The Garlic and Parm wings were out of this world!! Delicious, crispy  and juicy and nothing less then perfect!My view of the bar was perfect with 8 or so large TV screens and smaller ones all around. What was also something to mention The DJ played music before between and at the end of the evening with a nice variety of hip hop reggaeton and pop hits.So we will be back to get blown away by the garlic/parm wings and xl tv screens experience! Caio
2018-11-30,5,Great place and atmosphere. Rosco is the best, Anicia is also the best. The food great, the customer service on point. I will be back. I will be back
2018-11-30,5,Great environment and experience. Great service and people. I had a great time and the drinks were strong. I will be here again. Rocco is also a great bartender
2018-11-30,5,Great service and fun atmosphere ! Bar scene is great also and sundays are always a good time here! You can't beat the happy hour specials either
2018-11-30,5,Such a good place with friendly people! I came here on a Friday night with three of my girlfriends and felt so welcomed. Worth the trip!!!
2018-11-24,1,DO NOT GO HERE. Bouncer is an asshole, to say the least. Told my friend and I that our ID's were fake, and when we proceeded to tell him that we were visiting from RI, he told us to get lost, or else he would call the cops. After speaking to the manager, we were finally let in, only to witness a menu full of overpriced drinks and a dead atmosphere on a Friday night. Awful and rude staff.
2018-11-11,5,If you are in Hoboken and want to have a fun night with friends go to Madd Hatter. They got deals on deals, great vibe ... sundays feel like friday nights.
2018-11-11,5,The best spot to go with your friends! The crowd is amazing and the customer service is phenomenal. The staff really takes care of you and makes you feel at home. I brought a party of 13 and they never had us feel forgotten!!! On point with remembering drink orders, food came out prompt, and always made sure everyone was doing great. Fun spot to hang out at.
2018-11-08,5,This place is great at all times of the day lunch dinner snack it doesn't matter the food is amazing! After hours becomes a party that you will not regret going to the drinks are great and affordable. I haven't had any complains about the staff everyone here is welcoming and cool. From the front to the kitchen everyone was great! This place is on my def top 5 places to go to in Hoboken!! I would recommend it to EVERYONE!!!
2018-11-07,5,Great service from the time we reached the door! Although the food choices were common to your local bar, it was excellent! Great atmosphere, with a DJ playing great hits on a Wednesday night. Many TV's for all your sport needs!! Drinks are beyond excellent, and love the fresh taste (try the "Souther Smash)! The server was very pleasant. Quality service, and prices. You can't go wrong!
2018-11-07,5,Really enjoyed happy hour at MADD Hatter.  Rocco is an awesome bartender! It's a great place to watch a game.  Tons of tvs and a nice atmosphere
2018-11-06,2,Place is odd.  Is it sports bar is it a club?  Looks exactly the same as the old place just a different color.  Only thing saving this place is the location.  In a town full of monster sports bars they are not a real SPORTS BAR.
2018-11-03,5,Love it heree!!!!! Great brunch!!!! Great service and good  never disappointed!!!!!! Weekends are fun!!!! Definitely come here to watch your football games it's crazy fun!
2018-11-02,5,Love this place! The wings and truffle fries rock my world!! Great spot for unwinding after work :)
2018-10-29,1,My friends and I attended the pub crawl over the weekend, this pub was suppose to be their check in but we ended up being able to do it at another bar. The map indicated that they were participating in the event until 9, we arrived at 8. They let 2 of us in and then claimed that we needed to pay a cover charge of $10 bc it was 8pm... we pointed out the fact that it stated they were participating until 9 and we had already paid for the crawl... long story short, they told us they could not let us in unless we paid but then proceeded to let SEVERAL other groups in. When my friend asked if it was because they were black (myself and 8 others) the bouncer proceeded to roll his eyes and tell us to move out of the line. When I confronted him about being racists towards my friends he did not ONCE deny it, just kept saying that we needed to pay him to get in and was COMPLETELY disrespectful towards our group. If your bar is CHOOSING to be apart of a bar crawl that we PAID for then you should stick to the times that are posted and not try to charge us money at the door. Your bouncer was RACIST and a complete disgrace to your establishment.
2018-10-28,5,My husband and I went for their Halloween party for our first time since it became "Madd Hatter" The place was packed! I've been in the service industry for 10 years and I would just like to thank the staff for such amazing service! The bartenders were amazing, friendly and efficient for being so busy! We will be back for sure!
2018-10-26,2,I stopped by the Madd Hatter for a drink on a Saturday afternoon.  The crowd was essentially reminiscent of the previous patrons of One Republic, the prior tenant in the space.  By that I mean young, drunk, rowdy, etc.  Maybe it was just the awkward hour that we were there, but the atmosphere just felt more depressing and less vibrant than it had been when One Republic was around.  However, the smaller crowd and odd hour made it that much more comfortable to sit around the massive square bar in the center of the establishment.  I cannot really comment on the drinks, since I just ordered a can of sparkling seltzer, though I appreciated that they offered several fruit flavors of the low-carb beverage!  Overall, Madd Hatter was more spacious and slightly more upscale than a standard sports bar, but still not really my scene.
2018-10-25,1,Stopped in here for Taco Tuesday and my roommate ended up finding a penny in her taco. Literally, took a bite and spit out a penny onto the plate..Was asked if we put the penny on the plate and then charged for half of our meal!If eating here, be on the lookout for money in your food and if you do find some money in your food, I surely do hope it is more than 1 cent.
2018-10-24,2,The food is decent, the drinks on par, but the wednesday night karaoke host does this place a huge disservice. I get it, they want to get everyone involved and riled up for a fun night, but let's face it, it's Wednesday night, we didn't come here to spend until 4am waiting for a song, or because the toothless salt and pepper haired older guy wants to flirt with the young ladies or randomize Songs to his liking rather than first come first served. Charge per song if you're getting too many requests, but don't think we are here because you're soooo entertaining. I guess this is the reason more and more places are not hosting karaoke nights, the good hosts have been killed off by the likes of this dude or the K town karaoke places that use technology to play the damn music chosen.
2018-10-19,1,Racist. Two of my male POC friends were denied entry tonight since they "violated dress code". They came to the door wearing durags and immediately took them off when the original bouncer said they couldn't come in with them on. At that moment two of the- I guess "official bouncers"- came over and said "hey guys not tonight, get out of here". So we obliged, obviously not trying to start a scene. But it honestly really bothered me so I went back over to the two bouncers and asked them what the problem was. My two friends had taken off their durags- but they still weren't able to come in and I was wondering why? Both of them are extremely hard working individuals from jersey we have always loved having a good time in Hoboken. The two bouncers both just kept repeating "not tonight fellas". I introduced the alternative that if a female came to the door with sneakers, would she still not be allowed in if she went home and changed into heels? And didn't receive a single answer from either one of them. I asked for their names tons of times and none of them would tell me because it's "none of my business" and "it doesn't matter". I also asked them- when is the appropriate night to come back? Since they told my friends "not tonight fellas", I asked them when that appropriate night would be. I never received an answer to that question either. I'm appalled at the lack of professionalism and blatant racial discrimination from the two bouncers. Their photos are attached since I couldn't acquire their names
2018-10-19,5,Much better than one republik. Cleaner, brighter and staff is great. They really try to make you feel at home. Music is great, drinks are great, have not tried the food yet but have heard great things.  Definitely check it. I will be coming back again.
2018-10-18,5,My best friend Maggie and I came on a Thursday night to watch the football game and it was an awesome time!! Great music great atmosphere. Employees and management were accommodating the whole visit. We will definitely be coming back!
2018-10-14,4,This place is great for watching sports. There's a ton of tvs and plenty of seating for both larger and smaller groups. My friends and I love their taco Tuesday deal (like $14 for unlimited tacos). There's outdoor seating in the summer and they open the big front windows for easy people-watching, even if you're sitting inside. The only reason I can't give this place five stars is that service is typically a little slow, especially if there's a lot of people there (although I have noticed this improving a bit lately)
2018-10-04,5,Have been here a couple of times and I always have a blast. Food is absolutely amazing, specially the truffle fries. Great happy hour discounts too (for both food and drinks).
2018-10-04,4,So this place was so fun for the Yankees wild card game - had a blast. We were really upset when one republik closed a couple months ago and were SO excited when we saw this place opened. Ambiance is so fun and chill so great to go to with friends. Now, on to the food. I wasn't super impressed if I'm being completely honest. Food was at most meh. Not wowed. Wouldn't recommend on food, but definitely would recommend for going for happy hour with some friends or to watch a game! Happy hour they have half off apps which is great too! Overall, I will return.
2018-10-01,1,Place rips you off.  Presents bill, including taxes. After giving credit card, get bill and charged higher price.  Taxed the tax.  Raise it.  Manager refunds and says wow don't know why happened.  Can't help but wonder how long and how many others they have done this to.  Lot of extra money in their pocket.
2018-10-01,2,came here twice. this is a review about their nightlife and party scene. the shot girls are real cool and fun, they start the party. the bartenders suck!!!! they iignored me and my group of 3 so they can all flirt with themselves and the barback. 3 girls i believe, i think all latinas and 1 barback whos a black dude. all just kept playing with eachother. terrible terrible service, doesnt even know how to make a good margarita. i work in the biz and if they were my bartenders, id fire all of them. security guards are a huge huge upgrade from the 1 rep garbage. thats why its a 2 star and not a 1. the shot girls and the security. people behind the bar suck plain and simple
2018-09-30,1,Ok this was the worst night I have ever experienced at a bar. The Bartender Sam is the absolute most atrocious bartender ever! She took more than 30 mins to bring a drink (and no I am not exaggerating) ... she also left the bar numerous amount of times to make out (YES MAKE OUT) with her boyfriend. Mind you, she was 100% drunk with all the shots she was taking behind a bar. She also caused a huge fight with two men at the end of the night because her sloppy self forgot a charger that SHE MISPLACED! The most trashy bartender to date and she needs to go!!!! I will make sure the city is notified about the antics going on in this establishment because service is ridiculous and the bartenders are even worse. It would get zero stars if that was an option but 1 is being too nice. Management, bartenders, and even the security is are the worst! The security guard (YES THE SECURITY GUARD) got into a fist-fight with a customer ... like what?????? I will be taking this further - Please avoid this place
2018-09-28,1,Went for brunch with my wife and didnt get any food after 50 minutes so I asked if we were going to be severed anytime and the waiters were looking confused so I asked for the manager and was very uncomfortable with his approach. It appeared that rob , the manager , was not coherent and had a stench of alcohol. Explaining the situation to him he kept staring at my wife assuming he was looking down her shirt and asked if she needed water multiple times. I confronted him and he was acting like nothing was happening. Very disappointed with the service and manegment I do not recommend the establishment
2018-09-25,5,Sunday Funday! My friends and I had a great time here on football Sunday. There was no crazy long line or cover charge to get in, unlike other bars in the area. Lively and upbeat atmosphere, lots of TVs showing all of the games. We ordered a few bar snacks and they were great. The beer selection in bottles and on tap is plentiful. Bartenders are very attentive even when the bar is packed. Shout out to Lindsay for the excellent service and great drinks!
2018-09-22,1,Denied me access to the bar for having a NH ID claiming it was fake while still having other valid identification. When I asked them why I was denied entry, their excuse was that they were too busy to do a full validation check.... My group of 7 people were the only people outside waiting to enter the bar.
2018-09-22,2,Nice set up with many TVs. Very poor service and did not appreciate the bar tenders bad talking their customers in plain view. Weird vibes considering the one bartender asked the customer next to us to go out back to smoke and proceeded to do so. Would not come back.
2018-09-21,1,Been here a few times now. Figured I would give it a couple tries since the place was new and working out the kinks. The service is terrible even at the bar. The last time I was there I was with 2 other people and we sat at the bar. It's just very slow service. Drinks took what seemed like forever since we sat there for 10 minutes before we even ordered and then to order food we had to try to get our bartenders attention from across the bar because she never came back over. Over all service sucks. If they are busy the staff is overwhelmed and can't keep up.
2018-09-20,5,This is my first time here (and I came here from Westchester!), and it's such a fun time. As a vegetarian, it's so hard to find bar food I can actually eat, but they had the impossible burger, which is the best vegan burger ever. Definitely recommend this spot. It's a fun time to watch football, baseball, or just to have a really good veggie burger.
2018-09-16,2,This review is about food not service because our server was great....BUT FOOD???? Was dreadful we got wings that were so dry clearly old wings as the bones were literally breaking apart in your mouth but the tip of the iceberg was the pizza.... gross you couldn't even pick it up it just fell apart there was a POOL of grease...lol thought it was anything like 1reps food...yikes
2018-09-15,5,Best Fajita this side of the Hudson! Looking.         Forward to many more beer towers with the boys
2018-09-14,5,AWESOME service & friendly atmosphere for my family!! It was our kids' bday & they made it special giving mom a mini date night! 5 Stars
2018-09-14,5,Great happy hour. Lots of beer towers to share with friends. I love all the big screens for football. Can't wait to come back on Sunday for football.  Fun new place in Hoboken.
2018-09-14,1,Brace yourself for the "oh BTW, if you want dressing with your @&$@ it's 3.50 more. Quesadilla plain $ if you want chicken quesadillas it $3.50 more. Any sauce with that? $1.00 more. No explanations on menus saying in addition. When bill came, $148.00 . Totally not worth it.  quesadillas are better at Taco Bell . Do yourself a favor go somewhere else, there are plenty of places in Hoboken.  Not complaining about cost, don't mind paying for good food but this is expense and bad.
2018-09-09,1,Went here for a beer and a bite. Haven't been here since it changed owners , it feels like a bunch of 5 year olds are running this place.  Waited for ever to get a drink, the cocktail was so generic and gross- had to send back. Ordered a beer and wasn't even cold. I think this place was made to serve 21 year olds for a cheap time that's it.  Exactly what hoboken needs - another dive.
2018-09-09,4,Good bar scene for sure, def come after 4 pm on the weekend, otherwise it's dead. Bartenders were great bought us shots. Had a really nice time hanging out but I don't think I'd eat here. So for a bar def go
2018-09-09,4,Initially there were some fruit flys moved around the bar and ended up being fine. Although not a great start this was a great bar and great experience.Lots of drinks specials for the football and a tonne of tvs with different games on. Staff are great friendly and fun, gave us a few free shots which is awesome. Even changed a tv for me so I could watch a soccer game.Great prices and gets pretty busy and fun with a good atmosphere. Definitely recommend for a Saturday sports afternoon!
2018-09-09,5,I don't make the trek to Hoboken often, but when I do, I'll be coming here. It's a solid spot to watch Sunday football- large bar, lots of tvs, and John is great!
2018-09-07,4,The customer service is impeccable and they're excited & eager t to bring in new people, so stop by! One Repulik was my favorite Hobpken bar & they filled the shoes just fineeee.
2018-09-07,5,Great wings, lots of specials for happy hour as well as every day of the week. And we loved Jackie!!! Ask for her!!!
2018-09-02,1,On Saturday night, my two friends and I decided that we wanted to get dinner and drinks, and we wanted to try Madd Hatter. We had terrible service, the waitress didn't know what beer was on tap, we wanted a drink menu and she said there were only 3 drink menus for the whole bar so she had to go find it. What bar only has three drink menus?! Along with that, our waitress was incapable of taking care of us and two other waitresses came over during our meal because they saw how untaken care of we were. It was empty in the bar so they weren't even busy enough to make an excuse for bad service. We ordered nachos to start, and then I got a veggie burger and a mango margarita, one friend got a chicken pesto panini and beer, and my other friend got mac and cheese grilled cheese, truffle fries and a margarita. Since the waitress was unaware of what beers are on tap, my friend got out of her seat, left the table to go to the bar and find out for herself. I have NEVER not finished a drink before, but the margaritas were both so bad we couldn't finish them. The veggie burger was okay, not good not great. The chicken pesto panini was cut up into quarters, my friend ate one and said it tasted weird so she stopped eating after that one quarter. The mac and cheese was alright. When the food came out, there were no truffle fries, and my friend had to remind our waitress that she ordered them. After being home for a few hours after dinner, my friend who ate the panini felt so sick and her stomach was unsettled. She was throwing up all night due to food poisoning from the panini. Honestly, my other friend and I also didn't feel well after, but we both didn't get any sort of meat in our meal. Overall, the food and the service are not worth my money, my time, or in fact my health. Do not eat or drink here under any circumstances, you will regret it.
2018-09-01,5,I've been here 4-5 times. Recently 2 days in a row. The service is great, fast, and friendly. Simple menu covers most foodie desires. The music last night was amazing. Great vibes!
2018-08-30,5,Outdoor seating was pretty amazing, but the margarita pizza was the best part of the happy hour. Nicole was very friendly and the drinks were great. Def coming back!!
2018-08-30,5,Great atmosphere and amazing food. Definitely worth the hour drive. Looking forward to coming back again.
2018-08-30,1,Went today for lunch, nobody but us in the restaurant. Took 20 minutes for us to ask them to get us a drink menu. Took another 20 minutes to get our drinks and order food. There were flies everywhere, the tables felt like they weren't cleaned. Then the food came out, and to our expectations was not good. Tasted like it was microwaved paninis with old chicken. I currently have a stomach ache because of it. I would not recommend this to anyone and will not be returning. Overpriced food and drinks for terrible quality and service. Thought giving it a try would be a good idea, obviously I was wrong.
2018-08-22,5,Went here for Taco Tuesday.  Delicious.  Margaritas were solid as well.  All at good prices.  I recommend to others for those who need a good spot on a Tuesday night.
2018-08-20,2,Came here after a boozy brunch for a friend's birthday. There were 10 of us initially, but a few more people joined us. There were a ton of specials, lots of TVs, and the place itself looked cool, so we were all set to have a great day. The server who took our table seemed a bit annoyed, but I just thought it was because we were a large group and people were being loud and asking a lot of questions. We were there for about 2 hours, and throughout our time there, our server was posted up at the bar. We started stacking our own glasses. At a few points, we had to either flag her down or directly go up to her at the bar for drinks/glasses/napkins. We were still waiting for a friend to meet us when the server privately told me she had been cut hours prior and really needed to go. The annoyance we picked up on suddenly made sense- she took our table right before or after she got cut and I guess didn't expect us to be there so long. Well, 10 out of the 13 people in our group work at restaurants and bars, so we could sympathize that nobody wants to have to stay at work for hours after they're cut, especially if they already had a long day. But ultimately, she took our table and the service left a lot to be desired. Our check was high enough that the included gratuity was almost $80- so, roughly 40 bucks an hour for the two hours we were there. We closed our tab with her, and ended up leaving shortly after. From what I've heard, this is a pretty new business, so I'd be willing to give it another shot, but I'd probably just sit directly at the bar and I would cross this off the list of places I'd take a large group to again.
2018-08-19,5,Awesome food ! This place is in the same spot as One Republic but SO MUCH BETTER. Awesome service all around. Really good brunch special with entree and pitcher of drink options for 20$. Got a California Chicken sandwich with fries and it was delicious. Great portion size I couldn't even finish it all. Come check this place out if you want a fun vibe with great food and drinks for a good price in downtown Hoboken!!
2018-08-18,5,Food was phenomenal. Great service. Always helpful. Food was fresh and tasted awesome. Our waiter was so helpful the service here was awesome. Helped us with all we needed and answered all our questions. We had an assortment of food and everything was delicious. Definitely coming back to such a great atmosphere.
2018-08-15,4,Having a celebratory Anniversary drink with my hubby! Chill little bar. Pretty empty on this Wednesday afternoon but great happy hour specials! Bartender Rocco was pretty cool!
2018-08-14,5,Love the ambiance here. Music was great and the food was even better. The service was fast and friendly. They definitely have themselves a new regular customer!
2018-08-10,4,The ambience is amazing and so is the music..if you want to have fun with ur friends with some basic drinks and chill..GO THERE!
2018-08-10,5,I was skeptical about coming here because I saw this place only had 3 stars.. however, I was pleasantly surprised. We ordered many drinks, mozzarella sticks, shrimp tacos & a Mac and cheese grilled cheese and every single thing was delicious and the best part was that the prices were SO REASONABLE. All of our food & drinks were only $71 which honestly isn't a lot in the north jersey area. I'd highly recommend this bar to anyone in Hoboken because I could tell the staff / waitresses (Rebecca was ours) really cared about all of the customers. Great place! Even though Mad Hatter replaced 1Republik (one of my favorite bars)  I'm very pleased!
2018-08-07,1,So glad that this complete copy "replaced" 1Republik! Came in with four friends who all work at a bar in jersey city and are disappointed with this KILLER service. I ordered ONE beer, Heineken before the rest of my friends and was brought with a corona which is you know clearly what I wanted but you know ok. Then came the appetizers that we didn't order from the server who was more interested in pushing us to order more drinks than get what we ordered. Honestly let's just say it. This place is to DIE for.
2018-08-01,4,Went here for lunch.  Our waiter was Tom and he was so helpful and fun.  He recommended drinks and food and he was correct for both.  Will be back for sure
2018-07-28,1,Honestly horrible. The A/C unit kept dripping water throughout the whole place. We had the worst pleasure to have Rebecca as our server. She was polite and asked for what drinks we would like to order. I got a pitcher of beer and a friend got a bottle of shock top. My girlfriend for the night was driving and said she did not want to drink alcohol. To our surprise she questions my girl friend why she is not drinking and suggests she get something to drink to have a fun night. My girlfriend again says she does not want to drink alcohol. Rebecca responds with 'why? We have really good drinks that get you drunk. You should get one'. My girlfriend finally said she is driving and would just want water. Drunks arrived within 5 mins of us asking. We order our food when the drinks came. Does not matter what we ordered because we never got the food. We waited for an hour with no food. So I went to find Rebecca. Once I found her and she saw me she turned white as a ghost. She said 'ooo sorry I will check on your food'. She and the manager came to our table and said sorry for the long wait. Something happened in the kitchen. We just asked for the check and left. Honestly the staff are probably more drunk than the people coming in. Just stay away from them unless you want want drinks
2018-06-18,2,Hamburgers are cheap patties that look like they were made by walmart.  Texas burger was dry and tasteless.  Fries mimic potato chips were average.  Another person had the fried chicken sandwich and it was good.  Another person got the mac an cheese burger and it came out incorrect.  It was fixed quickly.  Server seemed new and was more interested in her cell phone.  Monday night dinner and there were only a few people there.  Unrelated we got a parking ticket since we were from out of town and didn't know the rules...parker beware.
2018-06-18,2,Im sorry folks.  You can do better.  Only open 3 weeks but seems more like 3 days.  Service is poor.  You have to chase the wait staff.  They don't know the beer selection, the food came out in the wrong order, then we got the wrong check.  Here's my advice.  Close your doors - train the staff on how to deal with customers, re-open in 3 weeks.  Everyone will be better off.  As of now - this is the place to avoid.
2018-06-17,4,Sunday Bar Review. For Hoboken honestly, the prices are super reasonable and the service and quality is on par with typical. hoboken. We came here to watch the Sunday soccer game which was GREAT here because they have so many screens ALL over the bar!! It was relatively quiet so we were able to change the table arrangements around and face the projector screens directly.Price wise, they had Sunday specials with small pitchers for beer it was $8 and sangria (red) was $14. The sangria isn't good at all and wasn't strong. The beer was beer. For appetizers, we ordered the Madd Hatter taster which was a huge platter of mixed appetizers which was great for the table for sharing. Overall the food was decent for the price of $11. It isn't bad. I would come back for the projector/tvs but definitely not back here for food.Service was slow which was surprising when there was no one really at the bar. I think the lady just gave up on us near the end, although she walked by a few times throughout our meal.
2018-06-17,4,Solid sports bar If you're looking to catch a game, or multiple games at once then this is the spot for you. It's also the spot for you if you're a fan of people watching from an umbrella covered patio while sipping a drink; I'm pretty sure that covers all of us. The drinks are reasonably priced , and you can get beer in a 32oz (approximately 1 liter for my metric system friends) "personal pitcher" that I found absolutely hilarious (8$ select drafts, 12$ for everything else). The food is solid as well; the mad hatter burger was on point and the hand cut potatoes that came with it were baller.If you're looking for a spot on Washington St, you could do much worse than this place (believe me, I have).
2018-06-16,3,Would be nice if the dj played some requests. If he did I would drop more $ and stay.
2018-06-10,5,First time I was here and thought it was great. The drinks were awesome and the chicken lettuce wraps were great. The service was really good and I thought their prices were responsible. You'll enjoy it.
2018-06-06,1,Added a tip which yelp removed probably as the business didnt want any negative feedback available to potential patrons (email from them below). so here's more details in a review.- Service was extremely slow. Bar was almost half empty yet it was painfully slow to get the service at the bar. - Even though the bar was almost empty the server gave us the impression we were not wanted through the interactions we had with them, we promptly packed up and moved on.Hello,We wanted to let you know that we've removed your Tip of Madd Hatter. We look for Tips that speak generally to a business's offerings and services. More personal experiences may be better suited for a review. Regards,The Yelp Support Team
