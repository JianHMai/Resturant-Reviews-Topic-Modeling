2021-10-16,5,We are never disappointed! This is our family's favorite ramen spot. Eating in or taking home, it's always good. I always do the spicy tonkotsu ramen. My wife does the kimchi ramen and kids, shoyu. I love their okonamiyaki and takoyaki. Enjoy!
2021-10-15,5,I've been looking for a ramen spot closer to home rather than going to my spot in NY. Did not disappoint. Absolutely loved the appetizers and the ramen was delicious. 10/10 would recommend and I'll definitely be back again.
2021-09-26,3,I love the steamy bowl of ramen they have in the window displayed. It's cute and catches your attention.Ordered delivery from here. We ordered the black tonkotsu ramen, seafood ramen, 4pc pork chashu, and kimchi salad.Delivery arrived pretty quick. It was still warm.The black tonkotsu was okay. The seafood ramen we wouldn't get again. It's better at South Street. The scallops were so tiny. There's barely any seafood. And at $20? Way overpriced for what it is. The tonkotsu was $18. Also pricey for small portion. Lacked the flavor I wanted.The kimchi was not good. We tried one bite and threw it away. Waste of $7. Don't recommend.The pork chashu was small for $7.50. It was also okay. We've had better.The noodles were cooked perfectly. Overall, we weren't satisfied and wouldn't order from here again.
2021-09-18,2,Had a very very disappointing second dining experience at Muteki! Unfortunately other than the gyoza, nothing was executed well. This time we ordered the chicken wings and the inside of one of the wings we bit into was ice cold!!! We had to send these back and when we did someone from the kitchen came out and interrogated us about what was wrong with them in an aggressive matter. Not okay!The ramen was also very bland.  Service also wasn't as good! :-(
2021-09-18,4,Woke up craving ramen and decided to try this place out since it had amazing reviews. For appetizers, we started with the bang bang shrimp, muteki wings and the karaage buns. All 3 appetizers were amazing. The shrimp was wrapped in potatoe and cheese and it was so good. The wings were very crisp and came with this sauce that was so good. The buns were my least favorite but still very flavorful. For ramen I decided to get the karaage ramen. It was very flavorful reminded me of a more seasoned miso soup. The fried chicken wasn't really that good I had to take out majority out of my bowl. However very good experience, will visit again
2021-09-09,4,And want authentic food over Americanized. Delicious is how I would describe my Ramen. Really good and authentic ramen shop. Hand-pulled noodles and traditional pork broth. The shop is super small so your linking arms while eating but it makes the real Japanese experience. Ordered the Volcano miso ramen and Pork buns. Seriously though get the extra rich broth and get extra noodles halfway through the meal, then is like you ordered 2 bowls. If you need someone to eat with, just reach out.
2021-09-09,4,Delicious!Muteki Ramen is great!  They have a lot of ramen choices on the menu and you can choose between wavy and thin noodles.I wanted a spicy chicken ramen, and our server was so great at providing a recommendation.  He suggested that I order the Volcano Ramen but with chicken broth instead and chicken instead of the pork.  I was so happy with it!  It was delicious and it was exactly what I wanted.  The chicken was also great quality.  They gave nice, big and thick pieces of flavorful chicken and it was not fatty at all.  I believe it was slices of chicken breast and it was tasty.  I would have given them 5 stars but I wish my ramen was spicier!  I got extra spicy sauce on the side, too.Separately we also tried the Akashi Takoyaki (fried octopus ball) and it was very tasty!  I would order it again.Definitely recommend Muteki Ramen!
2021-09-05,5,Best ramen in JC - Hoboken area. I love Toto ramen in the city and think this place is just as good!  Delivery is always quick, on point and everything comes perfectly.  Love the broth(s) and all the ingredients.  You won't regret it.
2021-09-01,4,I was impressed with both dishes. My only critique is I wish the pork had more sauce so you can get that good saucy rice! Our server was super attentive and the food came out really fast! Overall a great ramen place in Hoboken! I would come back! :)
2021-08-06,4,Got food delivered from here for dinner.We ordered the chicken karage buns,pork buns,katsu don and karaage don bowls.The food was delicious.Great packaging.Felt the portion of katsu curry don was on the smaller side for  the price.
2021-08-02,5,WOW! What a great take out. Everything from the apps, to the Catsu curry and the dessert was amazing. One of the best meals I have had in a while. Will be ordering again soon!
2021-06-30,5,We were seated outdoors per request - there were only a few outdoor seating available. Has to be one of my favorite ramen spots around the area thus far.To start off I love the little details this restaurant has to offer such as their napkins have a cute caption "No Ramen, No Peace". Their menu has a wide range of Asian-fusion dishes with their respective Japanese names. *FOOD*- Kimchi Buns: savory and a bit sweet - highly recommend! Not as spicy as I thought which is ideal for me since I don't have a high spice tolerance.- Muteki Ramen and Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen - both very delicious and good broth. Would def try other ramens next time I'm back!
2021-06-18,1,Bun is too salty with a lot of sauce and def overpriced. Felt bad for my kidneys.$16 ramen... might as well go to nyc for ippudo!Only had two bites.Such a waste of money.
2021-06-09,5,Just moved to the area and decided to try out a new ramen spot. This is officially my new favorite! I tried the yuzu shio ramen on a rainy day, and it hit the spot. The dish was so flavorful and delicious. Would definitely recommend for your next ramen craving!
2021-06-06,4,I ordered for delivery back in May and finally getting around to writing a review! I liked how neatly they delivered everything, especially the ramen--with the broth separate from the rest of the ingredients so that it did not get soggy. I got the black tonkotsu ramen--I wasn't really a fan of the broth, which had a very strong flavor. The pork in it though was soo wonderfully tender, and I liked the fish cake too, I wish there was more of both. It had a tiny half egg, wish they'd also included the other half! But I'd like to try their other kinds of ramen in the future. I also got the fried pork gyoza--standard but nice presentation. The bang bang shrimp was different from most places I've had it--this was wrapped in fried potato strips! But I liked it well enough. I also got the yuzu honey drink--refreshing & I liked the cup with the plug for the straw hole so much that I kept it haha. All in all this seems like a solid place & I see myself ordering from here again in the future.
2021-05-18,5,This place was so good! We ordered ramen, pork buns, okonomiyaki, and takoyaki and everything was delicious! It's byob but there's a liquor store right across the street and they are so nice! Very clean and spacious with cool lighting. The pork buns were amazing, and the service was very quick too!
2021-05-09,2,I have many reasons to believe that this spot is not authentically Japanese.1. The decoration2. The attentiveness in service3. The fermented bamboo (too pungent)4. The weird ingredients in Miso Ramen - spinach, carrot, mushroom (I understand that Ramen can get creative but this combo is becoming a clicheÃÅ)5. The fact that they offer pick-up/delivery on a Chinese ordering app.I feel sad for those New Jersyans who thought the Ramen here was decent.
2021-05-08,5,Tried the curry ramen here. Was great.  Flavors really on point. Can't think of where else to get this in Hoboken. Although there are a few other ramen places, Muteki has some unique options.
2021-05-02,5,This spot is my favorite place to go when I'm in Hoboken. Everything is constantly excellent. 11/10
2021-04-24,5,We tried many reman here, but my favorite is still the black tonkotsu reman. Not many reman places serve this on their menu. The smoky flavors is irresistible and addictive;)
2021-04-21,5,Bumping my score to 5 stars, they have up their game with the broth, it's now even more flavorful!
2021-04-16,5,One of my favorite restaurants in hoboken. Ramen is great and also recommended the chicken katsu donburri
2021-04-14,5,Muteki Ramen is the best ramen in the Hoboken/Jersey City area. At one point, I felt like I was eating this ramen at least once a week. My favorite is the spicy volcano miso ramen. It's the perfect spice, and the pork belly they add to the ramen is the perfect finishing touch. If you're in the area, I definitely recommend for dining in or takeout!
2021-03-22,4,Ramen is one of my favorite meals in the Winter. It's soothing, comforting, and warm. What more can you ask for! I stopped by with a few friends on a Sunday around 6pm for dinner. We were seated pretty quickly and the decision making of which ramen to choose began!Muteki has many ramen bowls to choose from! I appreciate that they have other proteins aside from pork which is the typical one. As someone who doesn't eat pork, I love seeing that there is still a variety I can choose from!I went with the Karaage Ramen (~$16). This ramen comes with thin noodles in a chicken broth with fried chicken (karaage), spinach, bean sprouts, bamboo shots, egg, fish cake, nori, and scallions. I swapped the thin noodles for wavy noodles since I prefer that more for a ramen bowl.The presentation of the Karaage Ramen was great with all the colors and toppings. I was ready to dig in. The karaage is super crispy and there's plenty of it. The only thing is you have to eat it pretty quickly or at least make sure it's not submerged in the broth because it will get soggy. The broth was light and somewhat creamy. It definitely added to the soothing factor of the whole bowl. It also wasn't super salty which may be the case with some ramen places. The soft-boiled egg was delicious and cooked perfectly. My only complaint is that they only give a half egg when we all know a full egg would hit different. The spinach, mushrooms, and scallions elevated the bowl and balanced out the savoriness pretty well.All in all, Muteki offered a super enjoyable ramen dinner with a solid variety of bowls to choose from. If you're in Hoboken and craving a big bowl of ramen, Muteki is a great spot to try!
2021-03-19,4,Placed an order for two ramens and an order of pork buns on a Friday evening and received the delivery in 15 minutes. I was really impressed with the speed of the delivery. I also really appreciated how smartly the ramen was packed, with all the dry ingredients and toppings in one bowl and the broth in another container.We ordered the Black Tonkotsu Ramen ramen and the miso ramen. The black ramen was a bit too smoky for my liking, and the bamboo shoots tasted a bit off. Other than that, the rest of the toppings were great. Probably some of the best chashu pork I've ever had in a ramen too. The pork wasn't dry at all and had a great flavor. While I Didn't care for the black ramen broth, the miso broth was good. We also added an extra marinated egg to each ramen for an extra $1. The eggs were perfectly cooked and runny in the middle, but not really sure if they were "marinated" because typically the marinated ramen eggs are much darker and these just looked like normal eggs. Overall, this place had speedy delivery, convenient ramen to-go packaging, and delicious pork buns. I wasn't a fan of the Black Tonkotsu Ramen broth so much but I will give this place another try and just order the regular Tonkotsu broth. As it stands now though, I prefer Vivi bubble teas ramen more.
2021-03-18,5,I love muteki ramen restaurant. Great service and food a delicious. I believe this is the best ramen that I ever had in Hoboken area New Jersey area.
2021-03-18,1,terrible experience. ordered a ramen delivery from this restaurant. I already paid for the delivery fee. the restaurant delivery guy called to force me tipping him otherwise he's not going to deliver.Food never arrived. this is the restaurant where the delivery guy may poison  your food with his dirty ass if you don't tip him as he desired
2021-03-12,5,Best ramen ever. Love the yuzu chicken soup ramen. Sukiyaki is also delicious. I recommend this place and I think this is the best ramen place in Jersey city.
2021-03-09,5,One of few places for indoor dining in Hoboken ..legit ramen and broth is so amazing. If you eat ramen enough, it is all about the broth. Also BYOB don't forget to bring your drink of beverage. Buns were full of flavor and just right for an appetizer for 2 . Green tea is a tea bag was expecting like loose leaf tea, but will definitely be back worth the the Path or light rail from JC
2021-02-27,5,Best Ramen in Hoboken! Always so fresh and flavorful. One of my favorite spots in Hoboken.
2021-02-26,5,Whenever the temperature drops an extra bit, I immediately start craving ramen. It is my cold weather weakness. I realllyyyyy miss going out to my favorite spots and I've tried a lot of Hoboken ramen gems of the years. Since quarantine started, I've been able to see how  one of my favorite foods comes to go or via delivery. Muteki is officially a front runner! I know getting ramen delivered can be a little daunting, but most places I've tried have truly mastered it, including Muteki. I got the Tonkatsu Ramen and the hot broth comes separate from the ramen and the fixings, so nothing is soggy or over cooked. You can see from the photos I uploaded that all of the veggies look so crisp and fresh, and the same for the rest of the ingredients. All I had to do was combine it all into the bowl they delivered it in and I was good to go. Everything was delicious and looking back at the photos is making me crave another bowl ASAP. Delivery came very quickly and they have such a low minimum, I didn't need to order anything but the ramen I was craving. I cannot wait until my next Muteki Ramen order!
2021-01-30,5,one of my favorite places for ramen. such good quality and huge quantity ramen. the staff is super nice and patient. the venue is very clean and pretty! everything about this place is amazing.
2021-01-22,5,We took a chance on Muteki Ramen in Hoboken, NJ, an 8 minutes walk from our hotel W Hoboken by the waterfront. We are so glad we did, decided to dining in our hotel room. We were not comfortable to dining inside as New Jersey allowed it here. Volcano Ramen was very good, not salty as typical places, just the right amount of heat, love it.The Tan Tan Noodle reminds me of more a Taiwanese style ramen, was solid.The cucumber salad, chopped tiny. Nothing like the photo on their website, but absolutely tasty and regressing. We love it.The Fried pork gyoza/dumplings was so tasty with just the nice savory soy dipping sauce.The kimchi was fresh and generous portion over fresh salad too.Ordered on their website so they don't have to pay so much for DoorDash or UberEat, support small businesses.The hostess helped was very nice and polite! It was just perfect ramen night for us at this cold winter night in NYC. Give them a chance when you are in the area!
2021-01-21,5,Awesome Ramen! Got the black tonkotsu ramen and the muteki. both delicious and flavorful. the tea is 4$ tho.
2021-01-20,5,I love this place.  I've had a lot of things from their menu at this point including some of the appetizers (like the shumai and gyoza), some of the buns (I really love the karaage chicken), and some of the ramen.  Everything has been great every time I've been here.  It's not just the food either.  The people who work here are great too.  They are friendly, provide great customer service, and they have been great about safety and wearing masks during COVID.  I highly recommend this restaurant.
2021-01-12,5,Awesome Ramen spot. I like the variety in ramen and sides. There aren't many places that serve takoyaki, and I'm glad there's one in town. I recommend the Karaage ramen but only if youre dining there since the chicken loses all crispiness on delivery. But for obvious reasons if you don't want to eat indoors, all of their other ramen options I've had were A+.
2021-01-04,5,If you ever had second thoughts about getting ramen delivered ... put aside those concerns. Not only is the food incredible, but they have fully adapted to a delivery world. Hot broth comes separate from ramen, so you get to put it together. Had shrimp buns as an appetizer and we ordered several different ramen dishes. Awesome.
2021-01-02,5,I'm so sad I don't live near this gem because I would be here all the time!I had the chicken and shrimp buns...I loved the chicken bun but the shrimp bun was just so light & refreshing that it won my heart over.After that I had a Ramen bowl, with roasted pork, egg, scallions and noodles. The broth was spicy but not too spicy...it warmed my soul and brought a smile to my face.The staff was very warm and attentive, and followed covid protocol.Highly recommend this small but mighty spot! Stay hungry and stay safe, Carolina G
2021-01-02,5,I was looking for a ramen restaurant to go with some family members and found this restaurant over Yelp. With the good reviews I read, I decided to give it a try and I couldn't be happier!  I have to go out of my way and say WOW, the staff was so incredibly friendly and helpful. We had a couple of people who were first time ramen eaters and they answered all of our questions with patience. The food tastes so fresh. Unfortunately I didn't take many pictures but we ordered a lot of food and nothing disappointed. The highlight was the ramen but a close second were the takoyaki balls! If you're looking for great service and incredible food, this is the place to go :)
2020-12-29,5,Finally Hoboken gets a phenomenal ramen place!!! Cannot say enough positive things about this place, it is insanely good and the staff is so friendly :) I like the spicy tonkatsu ramen or the muteki ramen   get the bang bang shrimp as an app as well!
2020-12-28,5,I was so excited to try this place and it did not disappoint! I got the black tonkotsu ramen and my boyfriend got the kimchi ramen and we shared the karaage buns and edamame. Everything was so insanely delicious and full of flavor. The pork in the ramen itself was tasty and beyond tender, it melts in your mouth...YUM! I love the karaage buns as well. The chicken was so crispy, the buns we fluffy and the accompaniments added just the right flavor. I'm so glad Muteki finally opened as I walked by their restaurant on Washington so many times eagerly awaiting their grand opening. This is definitely our new go-to ramen stop and I can't wait to order again!
2020-12-09,5,Miso ramen was delicious. More the ingredients than the brooth but the brooth is still good. Would recommend this place. I'm a picky ramen eater so I'm glad I found it! Order twice within two weeks!
2020-12-08,5,This spot was awesome. One of my favorite ramen shops in Hoboken I have to say. The fried chicken buns were delicious and the spicy tonkotsu that I got was super filling. The broth was perfect compared to some places and the pork was cooked perfectly. The waiter and surrounding staff were extremely pleasant. Will definitely be returning soon :)
2020-12-06,5,Great ramen and buns! Separate takeout containers for soup and fixings made it easy to have hot at home.
2020-12-05,5,The food is phenomenal and the staff are very polite. Highly recommend the pork buns.
2020-12-04,4,Really enjoyed this ramen. I got the vegetarian ramen. I was a little nervous because it had a lot of veggies that I don't normally put in my ramen, but it was delicious! Super creamy and great flavor. Next time I'll probably ask for it spicy and add an egg. I also got the bang ban shrimp and they were tasty! Only complaint is I wish there was more than one vegetarian bowl to choose from.
2020-11-25,4,It was pretty windy and a perfect day for ramen! We were sitting outside and the food got cold very quickly. The fried chicken was a bit like the Chinese sweet and sour chicken. Ramens were so good. I had the spicy tonkotsu and my husband had the volcano miso. Both were very good.
2020-11-24,4,Solid ramen spot with all the components; tasty tender pork chashu, a nicely prepped soy ramen egg, seaweed and other standard fixings. Tried both the spicy tonkatsu and the black tonkatsu - would recommend going with the latter and adding the red table spice mix for a cleaner flavor. Sous vide seared chicken appetizer was interesting as well (served cold with over some lettuce). BYOB sit down and nice friendly staff. Service is FAST and a few single seat stalls was a nice Japanese touch.Hoboken has four dedicated ramen spots now by my count. Vivi Cafe is still my personal fave with a heavier, more flavorful broth but has very limited seating and bubble tea shop decor which is not great for sit down meal. South street ramen & fish has some non-traditional meats like pulled pork (hey don't knock it til you try it) and semi-service (order at the counter). Shokudo uptown and Muteki midtown are more suitable for a longer dinner (and a few beverages) with Muteki just slightly ahead between the two.
2020-11-18,2,Not up to the mark. The meat was chewy and the buns tasted funny. The broth was the only saving grace.
2020-11-18,5,Absolutely amazing!! Finally a top notch ramen place in Hoboken / outside of the NYC. I ordered the black garlic ramen and my husband the spicy pork - both were fantastic and full of flavor. We also ordered the pork buns which were so good too. Cannot wait to come back!
2020-11-06,4,We ordered delivery from Muteki on a Monday night & the food came faster than expected & hot! We ordered the pork buns, the Muteki ramen, and the Tonkotsu ramen. Everything was delicious & tasted fresh, although I was most impressed with the broth!! It had incredible depth of flavor. As a small negative, our ramen noodles were very tangled, which made it a challenge to eat. However, the flavors were on point. Great addition to the neighborhood!
2020-11-02,5,This place is an absolute treat. The service is fantastic, the food is unique and delicious. We have now been there twice and ordered once. All great experiences. The delivery was super fast and in awesome packaging to be enjoyed. Ramen arrived hot. Welcome to Hoboken and thank you!!
2020-11-02,5,This place was delicious-we ordered delivery and it came right away. Had the mazemen and the vegetarian ramen. Both were excellent, still very hot (even for delivery) and tasted super fresh. I can't wait to order from here again and try some more dishes.
2020-10-29,5,This is one of the few places in Hoboken that serves decent good food.  Tried three of their noodles and a few of the appetizers.  I am impressed overall.  This will be one of my go-to places in Hoboken.
2020-10-23,5,wonderful restaurant.  the karaage pork buns and takoyaki were spot on. i felt the ramen broth for the tonkotsu was a tad bland but every other element of the ramen was perfect.  service was friendly and excellent.  overall a great experience and will be returning to try more of the menu.
2020-10-19,5,It can be hard to find a good ramen. Even more difficult to find a good chicken ramen. The Yuzu Ramen was by far one of the best chicken ramens I have ever had. Make it a priority...go. The buns also good. (This was a take out order)
2020-10-11,5,This may be the best ramen I have ever had.  All of their ingredients tasted super fresh and were flavorful, well-prepared and nicely presented.  The pork broth was outstanding--rich and flavorful without tasting salty.  The noodles were tasty and firm -- cooked, but not mushy.  We had 2 appetizers -- wings and pork buns.  Both yummy.  The wings had a light crispy batter and tasted great.  The pork buns were fantastic -- quality ingredients and fresh.  Yum.  My husband had an eel rice bowl which he said was out of this world.    Service was excellent.  Friendly, professional, and quick.We ate outside--we were fortunate to get a table for 4, as there are only 4 tables all together outdoors.Highly recommend.  We will definitely return.
2020-10-09,5,WOW! I'm so happy I found this place!! Perfect for the start of cooler weather and amazing flavors and broth. I had my go-to ramen which is Tan Tan. Not as spicy as other ramens I've had, but full of flavor and very generous portion! Delivery came quickly and was nice and hot upon arrival! Great bowl for delivery which is always impressive for delivery ramen. Can't wait to order again and again this fall and winter!
2020-09-30,1,The most disgusting place I've experienced in JC.Came here on a afternoon date and we ordered appetizers first. The shrimp was ok. However my boyfriend ordered the chicken wings and we LEFT! Upon trying to eat the seasonless chicken we see film or extra skin just left on the chicken and the skin fried over top if it. it was disgusting, would not come back here at all.
2020-09-28,5,Delicious, newer ramen spot. They have both indoor and outdoor dining.  We ordered the black tonkatsu ramen...so delicious! Looking forward to eating here more often and trying out other dishes!
2020-09-26,5,Amazing ramen! Great appetizers . Really better than any Ramen I've had in jersey ! So worth it and my waitress was so nice !
2020-09-25,5,Wow & Congratulations ! Muteki has only been open for 45 days, but it's been 3 years in the making.  Muteki brought back great memories of Japan. Tonight was a dream come true and it's here in Hoboken, New Jersey !First of all Covid precautions are being followed including social distancing and hand sanitizer availability. Tonight I ate to my hearts content starting off with Karaage, crispy, delicious morsels of tender fried chicken with a shiracha mayo... ($8) and Charsu-Buns 2  delicious buns filled with tender pork, cabbage, carrots and a yummy sauce ($8)  Both were so so good. !!! My main course was their signature Muteki Ramen ($16)  Thin noodles in a chicken and pork broth, pork and chicken Charsu, spinach, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, butter corn, scallions, Kikurage mushrooms, egg, fish cake, nori. The hearty 15 hour broth was amazing. And coated the noodles with every slurp !   Every item complimented this ramen with distinctive flavors and textures... Wow I'm in love !Customer service was great, friendly and attentive staff, with attention to detail . If you have a craving for Ramen  and you're in Hoboken area, Muteki is a must ! You will not be disappointed.I can't wait to come back Follow me on Facebook Twitter Yelp and Instagram as I travel the world in search of the perfect bowl of noodle soup  @noodlesoupreview  @noodlesoupr
2020-09-25,5,We've been waiting many months for Muteki to open, but after talking to the owner Mr. Hee-he's been working on this opening for 3 years! I had the Black Tonkotsu Ramen which was delicious. They use fresh Sun noodles. The Cha Siu melts in your mouth-he makes it the day before, soaks it in the sauce and puts in the ramen It's perfectly cooked! There are at least two large pieces in the ramen. The ramen broth is a 15 hr broth. The decor is beautiful and clean! The service is friendly and attentive. We also had the karaage and the Cha siu bun-both were amazingly delicious!!! The karaage was so tender-would have loved to have a little more of the tangy sauce. The Char siu buns were bursting with flavor! Soooo good! Can't wait to go back! They've been open 40 days, please go there and enjoy! They will also have private carrols where you can order ramen just like Ippudo in NYC and Japan. We will be back!
2020-09-23,4,I waited long enough for this spot to open! Tonkotsu ramen was delicious. Cucumber salad was the perfect umami for my palette. Although the karaage and pork buns were great, a bit too much sauce on it. I recommend asking for the sauce on the side for the karaage. Takoyaki balls were yummy. Flavors were on point from sauces to broth. Waiters were friendly and attentive. Ives tried all the ramen spots in Hoboken and this is going to be my new go to spot for ramen in The area.
2020-09-22,5,Muteki is the place to go for Ramen in Hobo! Loved the spicy Volcano Miso Soup, it wasn't extremely spicy which made it enjoyable. The miso base wasn't salty, like some places can be. The pork was cooked to perfection. All in all, very very tasty and the wavy noodles complimented the miso well.The Buns were also delicious, the sauce drizzled on it was AMAZING, very soft bun with the Muteki logo branded on it (for all the hipsters looking for a nice food photoshoot)I definitely recommend the fried Chicken appetizer. Again, the sauce they drizzle on it was very good.This is a great spot to catch up with friends, go on a date, or get takeout. During covid there is seating both inside and out. They place a sanitizer on your table, very clean!!
2020-09-18,5,Hands down best ramen spot in Hoboken! We had the volcano miso ramen and the karaage bunzzzzz. So much flavor and spice!
2020-09-08,4,I really enjoyed visiting this cute ramen spot on Labor Day evening. Everything came out piping hot, and the service was spot on. Muteki currently offers indoor and outdoor dining, though we opted for a two-top outside (just in front of their animatronic ramen bowl). Highlights included the Mazeman ramen and the okonomiyaki, which was more like an omelette than I'm used to, but delicious nonetheless. They are currently BYOB, so pick up some cold sake bottles on your way over, and get to sippin'.
2020-09-06,5,We came here after a long work shift when our other go to ramen shop was closed. It looks like this is a newer ramen shop that had only opened a few weeks ago during the pandemic. They were busy and we had to wait a few minutes before a table cleared and could be seated. Tables were not exceptionally distanced as the entire sidewalk in hoboken isnt very large, but the waiters all did wear masks and clean tables between customers.We ordered the volcano miso ramen, the spicy tonkotsu ramen, and the karrage fried chicken as an appetizer. Really all of the food was delicious- i definitely think that the broths and quality of the pork chasu is exceptional and definitely can help Muteki claim a spot with fierce ramen competitors. The only thing I might change is to get the ramen with wavy noodles. I prefer the chewier wavy noodles to the thin noodles that are sometimes served with specific dishes, so take note that if you want that token wavy ramen noodle, make sure your dish comes with it or just request for it to be switched out!We will definitely be back for more!
2020-09-01,5,Really yummy ramen! We were looking for a place in the area and decided to come here. We got edamame, Pork Buns,  Chicken Karaage, Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen, Spicy Miso Ramen. Portions were big. All were well flavored. Will return!
2020-08-31,4,After trying two ramen spots in Jersey City, my husband and I were starting to give up hope. But upon reading a blogger's post about a recently opened (~3 weeks ago) ramen shop, we decided to try Muteki Ramen.Overall, I'd recommend Muteki Ramen if you're looking for good ramen across the Hudson River in the Jersey City / Hoboken area. By default, our favorite ramen shop is probably still one in New York City. However, with that said, I am very happy with Muteki Ramen as my alternative.The staff was extremely friendly and nice, carefully social distanced, and the price is very reasonable for the portions.Karaage Buns: YUM. the pickled veggies, the thai sauce, and the perfectly battered karaage within the bun makes this appetizer so delicious. I highly recommend ordering this as an appetizer. I love that it's not too greasy and I love that the pickled veggies cut through the fried chicken.Black tonkatsu broth: this broth was so delightful - it was light, it was rich, it was "healthy." After talking with one of the chef, I learned that this broth is truly made from nights of boiling and simmering and that they don't add any extra seasonings to get the flavor. You can really taste hints of the tonkatsu broth drizzled in some black garlic oil. In addition, the two pieces of thick & perfectly grilled Chasu was delicious. My only "negative" review would be that the noodles were a bit softer than we tend to like it.All in all, I will be back here for sure!
2020-08-26,2,The place is has great service and nice menu. Ramen wasn't anything close to Japanese. Not quiet sure why my Ramen had tomato and shaved Garlic.
2020-08-25,4,I was very happy to find out that another ramen place had opened up in Hoboken. I've been here twice and I loved the Pork Curry Katsu, it's very crispy and I hype it up to others. The Takoyaki are hot and creamy and the tako isn't too chewy inside. I tried their Kimchi Bao which was really fluffy and flavorful. Service has always been pleasant and they stay on top of it. However, recently I tried their Mabo-Nasu Don and I was surprisingly disappointed. The presentation of the dish was there but the sauce was bland which in turn made the entire thing flavorless with a subtle pickled taste. I couldn't eat it. Maybe it was an off day for that particular dish? Otherwise, its been a good experience and I hope they get through this trying time for restaurants.
2020-08-22,5,What I tried -  vegetarian creamy ramen- brunch of veggies and tofu in a creamy broth. I loved how flavorful this ramen was! okonomiyaki - savory vegetable pancake with egg, cheese and mayo. This was our first time trying this dish and it was my favorite.  My friend enjoyed his ramen with pork. This is a new spot in Hoboken but perfect for a quick meal and good time. Dishes are fairly priced.
2020-08-17,5,Just tried Muteki for the first time this weekend - so amazing! It's probably the best ramen I've had in all of hoboken. Flavorful, smooth broth (i got the black tonkotsu ramen), and the pork chashu in it is insanely great (nicely browned and flavorful). The rest of the menu looks amazing as well, can't wait to go back this week. Highly recommend!
2020-08-15,5,This ramen place is amazing! We've been to many ramen restaurants and this is by far the most authentic place. You can really taste the love in every bowl you slurp down. We had a chance to chat with the owner and he explained his process. He makes his ramen with so much care. They said it takes about 15 hours to make that delicious soup. If you are EVER walking by you must stop by and give it a try. You will not be disappointed!
2020-08-14,5,Just opened so I decided to give it a try. The ramen was very good, better than I expected. We got the volcano miso ramen and the mazemen no soup. We were happy with our choices and the noodle texture was perfect - equivalent to an Italian's al dente! Overall, very happy with the food and service.
2020-08-13,5,WOW! Super excited to see this great ramen place make an appearance in Hoboken. Food was excellent and portions were the perfect size. I can't wait to try this restaurant in person once the virus is over as the interior looks fabulous!
2020-08-13,5,So good! Delivery was fast and the food was amazing. We ordered the volcano miso ramen and the spicy tonkatsu ramen. Broth was rich, large portions of incredible chashu, and a perfect soft boiled egg.
2020-08-11,5,Ordered regular and spicy ramen and the gyoza. The order arrived early, and everything was hot. Noodles were good, and the broth was very tasty!The meat was a little bit dry. But overall it's a solid option for ramen in NJ!
2020-08-09,4,My husband and I had the chance to eat at Muteki Ramen last night for the first time. Being new to the area we decided to walk the neighborhood to see what seemed interesting and who had available outdoor seating. We arrived around 8 PM and were happy to see there were a few tables available (everyone is eating outdoors currently). We were immediately seated and our server brought out menus. (I think they should provide a paperless menu option to combat the spread of germs). We ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp and Chicken Karaage appetizers and the Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen and the Tonkotsu Black Ramen. My husband loved his chicken Karaage, for me, the Bang Bang Shrimp were "good" but not traditional Bang Bang Shrimp. These are smaller shrimp wrapped in some kind of potatoes and batter and deep fried and drizzled with traditional Bang Bang sauce. It took eating a couple to kind of get into them but I must say we did eat them all. We also ordered Lychee and White Peach drinks (non-alcoholic) which were $3.75 with no refills and probably only 8 oz WITH ice. While they were really good, literally after a few sips they were gone so we decided to get canned Diet Cokes instead for $2 each on the next refill. Definitely not worth $3.75 in my opinion. We also noticed it took a while for our appetizers to come out but I imagine like a lot of businesses affected by Covid, they are working on a limited staff so we understood, also, it was cool to just be sitting out on a beautiful night so we were chill. Once the food came we enjoyed it, especially our main dishes. We eat a lot of ramen and ramen is one of my favorite dishes that I have had all over the world. I must say, this ramen was very good. I gave it a solid 8-8.5 which is good for me. My husband's favorite part was the smoked pork chasu. He loved the flavor and the smokiness. I loved the broth and the freshness of the veggies and how perfectly cooked the noodles were. We also found the portion size to be generous. The service and the staff were very nice and the prices were pretty reasonable. I was a little surprised that they were using regular dishes and silverware in light of the virus, but they were very nice when I asked for my drink in a to go cup and disposable chopsticks. We will definitely go back and I look forward to another tasty bowl of delicious ramen! It's definitely worth going!
2020-08-09,5,Best Ramen in Hoboken! I would recommend the Black Tonkotsu ramen as it has so much flavor. So glad we finally have a good ramen restaurant in Hoboken!
2020-08-09,5,Ordered delivery from the new ramen place in town, and I really enjoyed the food here. I got the black garlic ramen and pork buns, and both were really flavorful. Although the price of the ramen is a little more than other places, that is because they don't nickel and dime to you to have to add a bunch of add-ons. I'm a big guy, and I think the portion size was great for the price. It wasn't just 90% noodles like some other places. Would definitely order again to try some of the other ramen flavors.
2020-08-07,5,This place made my friends and I astral project to the heavens. The waitresses (shout-out to mindy) are the nicest people and the ramen....show stopping. 10/10 would go again and I'll definitely try more from their menu.
2020-08-07,2,Karaage is very tasty.Ramen are far from Japanese taste because soup are not hot and noodle are growing
2020-08-05,5,As two people who are Japanese ramen obsessed (grew up in Japan and Hawaii), we were SO impressed with the quality and taste and presentation and service here. That charsiu pork is absolutely delish and caramelized and fatty and whoah!  A great new spot in our neighborhood!
