2021-11-08,5,So delicious! I'm very much looking forward to coming back here. I ordered takeout, arriving about an hour after I ordered... But they packaged everything in a way that made it all still be delicious when I got home. The only issue was the chicken was slightly dry after I reheated it, but that's expected of chicken breast that I let sit out for about an hour... I'll be ordering it again when I dine in bc the flavor was still really good. Everything else was absolutely amazing! The arroz con gandules was great, the ham croquettes were exactly as I like them, the maduros were sweetly carmelized... & the coconut cake... Oh my Goodness... It was so good! I didn't dine in, but the space looks really cool. My sister and her husband are visiting in about a month, and I've already sent them the restaurant info so we can plan to go. Do happy to have this place nearby!
2021-10-10,5,The food is great at La Casa. We went for a Saturday dinner as a part of 6. They do not take reservations but they easily arranged a outside seat. Our server was great. We get a sangria with the wine that we brought in. Do not miss out on empanadas. I got a Bistec de Palomilla which was a little it tough but everything was superb except that. Definitely recommend.
2021-09-10,4,This places is great for authentic Caribbean Hispanic food. The waiter was very attentive and he always made sure we had what we needed. We sat outside since the weather was lovely. I honestly didn't like what I ordered because I really don't like beef stew in general so that's my fault. It was flavorful but I just felt like the tomato sauce over powered the seasoning. I loved the rice and red beans it reminded me of my moms cooking. My bf got hmm... what did he get.. oh yea, beef oxtails with arroz con gandules and yucca frita. We got shrimp stuffed tostones which was my favorite because they come with sauces that made the dish so much better. We also ordered morir soñando, coffee and guava cheesecake. Everything came out to be 66$, I thought that was a deal. The guava cheesecake didn't really taste like guava but it was good. Coffee was strong. I had leftover for the next day.
2021-08-29,5,I absolutely love this place. Every time I come to Hoboken, I come here. The portions are gigantic and the food is absolutely delicious. Not skimpy on the portions and seasonings at all. Amazing food amazing atmosphere
2021-07-19,5,Great food! Homemade style and service was outstanding, lately it is rare to find both and this restaurant actually did it.Kudos to Henry our server for Saturday night, who was super pleasant and attentive to all our requests and to my Dog Nala...that meant the world to my sister and I.Last but not least, I wanted to highlight the great man behind this Cuban restaurant Russel, he did the kind thing that I haven't watch lately and it was feed a homeless person some rice, beans and chicken!  God Bless you guys!
2021-07-12,5,Wow! VERY impressed with La Casa!! We tried their Garlic Chicken and I had shrimp with mine. We got a side of the fried eggs.So I've had La Islas garlic chicken and La Casa is WAY better!!! I love all of the fresh garlic and herbs! Shrimp and chicken was cooked perfectly!! Tender. Chicken was easy to pull apart. Just wish the chicken was a bit thicker! It's pounded pretty flat. Otherwise highly recommend!! The spinach is cooked in with the delicious sauce and tastes so fresh. Absolutely LOVE this dish!!!The side of two fried eggs were also cooked perfectly and perfectly seasoned with salt and pepper. I love that this is a side option. Very good. Fresh.We also ordered the iced americano. We are SUPER impressed!! Best iced americano in Hoboken thus far!! You gotta try one if you love americanos!! Excellent espresso!! Gorgeous flavor!We will definitely be back to try more items off the menu!!The owner, Russell is also great!!My boyfriend also tried their coconut cake, made from scratch there. It's very moist and so flavorful!! He said it's an excellent cake 10/10! Wish I could try it!! (It's unfortunately not keto friendly lol).Highly recommend trying this place!!! Prices are great too! Great quality, fresh foods.
2021-07-02,4,A little hole in the wall, Thursday lunch special is Rabo, perfectly cooked and very soft and tender, with the correct red sauce, Sides of yellow rice with peas, black beans and sweet plantains make it an authentic experience. The oxtail is very consistent and the lunch special comes with 3 fattily delicious pieces, plus 2 sides for $12.95. A bargain meal.
2021-05-20,5,One of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken! The space is small and they have a couple of outdoor seatings. It does get super busy especially during lunch, so make sure to get their early! However, if you do have to wait - it's worth it Their lunch specials are amazing. With huge portions and fair prices - it's unbeatable! There are no alcoholic beverages on the menu, but if you bring a bottle of wine, they'll make you a bomb margarita! It's actually one of the best margaritas I've ever had, so don't think twice about bringing your wine. My suggestions (aka the only things I've tried) are the pernil, their oxtail dish, empanadas, sopa de pollo, and sancocho!! I already can't wait to come back
2021-05-13,5,The food is great and not overly expensive. Outdoor seating is real nice. A great spot to grab lunch with friends.
2021-05-06,2,Cute decor - tiny place The empanadas were good but not the best in the world The shrimp skills was bland and underwhelming I traveled from JC Give me some damn good food please
2021-03-19,5,Adorable!!!!! Cute little place, super great service. Menu is very Latin America, which was great. Prices were surprisingly cheap for the amount of food we got. If in the area, we would definitely come back. And to to top It off..awesome salsa music!!
2021-03-06,5,Probably one of my favorite places in all of hoboken. This is my first time ordering pickup and while I really do enjoy the ambiance of the indoor restaurant...the food is just as delicious at home.What to order: 4 words. Guava and cheese empanadas. The Empanadas de Guayaba y Queso are hands down the best item in the place. I typically just order 4 of the things and call it lunch! I take everyone who visits me in Hoboken to get these empanadas and everyone loves them! Pollo al Ajillo. This chicken in garlic sauce is delicious. And comes with two sides (I got sweet plantains and fries)I asked for the sides of the garlic sauce and chili sauce which are normally served on the table, for my empanadas. Protip: call ahead if you have a group of 4 or 5 so that you can ask for the table in the back so that you won't be blocking the walkway to the kitchen. It's a really narrow restaurant. Pro tip #2:the heat is always blasting! Dress light or in layers so you can take off a layer of needed. Protip #3: bring a bottle of wine and they will make you sangria! (For a price)
2021-03-05,5,Best mofongo! Service & atmosphere is very warm. Definitely a great spot for Cuban food.
2021-02-27,5,Favorite taco spot! The shrimp tacos are my fav. The staff are always so friendly and welcoming, feels like a home away from home.
2021-02-07,5,Henry our waiter was so patient with us! The garlic sauce was so good. You can bring your own wine they don't serve liquor. Cute and cozy spot with authentic Cuban food with such a nice amount of food for every portion. So good ! So delis!
2021-02-01,5,Fantastic addition in the Hoboken area for Puerto Rican/Dominican food! Great selection of food items and its BYOB! Great staff that is amazing and friendly! Definitely worth checking out and getting some food to go or dine in if possible!
2021-01-30,5,Wow!!! This place checks all of the boxes for me. I called on a Saturday knowing my chances of getting a reservation were slim. When I called, the guy who answered was extremely polite and said they didn't have any spots left for tonight, but we'll call you if something opens. They called me back and we made our way over! It's a very small restaurant with a handful of tables. Small, but decorated so well that you feel at home. Our server, Henri, was great and checked on us frequently. Food came out in a timely manner. We split a papa rellena (perfectly crisp) and I had the fried chicken with mofongo. Omgggg, the chicken was so good that I chewed on the bone to get extra flavor lol. The mofongo was also good! Tried an Iron Beer soda which is pretty addicting. For desert I had the flan...and it was the best I've ever had. My fiancé has the tres leches which was also fantastic. Prices are not too bad for Hoboken. Overall, I loved this place and would love to return.
2021-01-09,4,Great spot! We didn't even know of the place till today. They had bachata playing as soon as you walk in felt so homey, so unfortunate they are so small. We were greeted at the door and our waiter was completely attentive. Our soup could've been a bit more hot but we were hungry so who cares it was delicious. Unfortunately I'm pregnant and could try any drinks :(
2020-12-14,5,When uptown La Isla changed their menu I ordered from here for the first time... now it is almost a weekly order.  ONLY complaint is that they don't have the lentil soup every day - it's so good!  Go to is pollo la plancha - excellent
2020-12-02,4,Ordered the garlic chicken for takeout and the food was delicious. But I'm dropping a star because they decided to fold the grilled chicken and stuff it in a small plastic soup container dipped in its garlic sauce. I have no idea why they couldn't just put it in a flat foil container so that it could be easily eaten on the go. Thankfully I had plastic plates at work and was able to pour it all out onto a plate otherwise there was no way I would've been able to eat the chicken. Other than that big mistake that really angered me, the food was delicious and I would recommend you probably skip the takeout and dine in until they learn how to properly pack to-go orders
2020-11-26,1,I had no choice but to leave one star, I would have left none, I should have thoroughly read the reviews as the common denominator in them is about customer service and forgetting orders. It is Thanksgiving day and because things are different this year, we decided to do a catering order with La Casa. We placed an order on November 4 with a follow up confirmation about a week later for pick up; payment was also made on Nov 4.Today, we arrive to pick up our order and we are met with closed doors and a sign stating the restaurant has not been open since Nov 21. During times like these, it is alarming to know that this restaurant couldn't give us a phone call to cancel the order. Moreover, you would think there are protocols in place and the fact that this was completely overlooked makes me wonder what other simpler tasks may be falling by the waistline. I was informed that the owner of this restaurant is the same one as the pizzeria establishment in the corner (across from CVS). I visited both locations this morning as none of the workers were able to provide me with contact information for a supervisor, and further did not have it themselves. Whether or not they were trying to occult this information is fine, but someone could have at least reached out internally for further guidance. Its unfortunate their workers were like me, with no information and also frustrated on my behalf.Do better La Casa, for those who may count on you in the future while trying to create memories during these taxing times. I will never place an order with this restaurant and I would recommend to think twice if you're considering catering.
2020-10-25,5,Cute and cozy place. If you sit inside, the theme is like if you where in the Caribbean so traditional.  Food was great and the attention was impeccable.
2020-10-22,5,I love it all I am done with La Isla l could eat here every night I just might La Casa and Imposto's I'm hooked Y cook anymore I want Great food Enjoy life and I found my destiny
2020-10-18,4,We ordered the pernil with yellow rice and beans very tasty and great!!  Also ordered monfongo with currasco hubbie loved it!!
2020-10-07,5,The food is yummy and the service is even better Henry was our server he was very sweet and accommodating. Great energy would recommend if you are in the area.
2020-09-20,1,We have enjoyed La Casa's awesome breakfast before so we decided to order some dinner this time around. Our order consisted of the cuban sandwich, chicken with arroz moro, and the picadora de familia. The cuban sandwich was the only flavorful dish from the rest of the meal. My GF got the chicken with arroz moro, the chicken was under seasoned and the moro was too dry and unedible. Some of the black beans were crunchy and not soft which is usually how it's made. Lastly, the appetizer platter that brought a little of everything to share....disappointed. It was missing one of the appetizers that's suppose to be included (sausage), chicharrón was mostly the fatty part and hardly any meaty parts, yuca fries were cold, and the chunks of chicken sadly ended up like our main course....under seasoned and dry. It could have been an off night for the cook but unfortunately, I don't see ourselves returning.
2020-09-18,3,The Staff was nice. A little slow service which I wouldn't mind if the food tasted better. Nothing to write home mom about. The Churrasco was dry and had no flavor. The maduros were kind of hard. The mofongo was good  And I didn't like the frozen lime/lemonade.
2020-09-14,5,AMAZINGGGGGGG!!! Absolutely loved it! You definitely need reservations this place is constantly busy and we sat outdoors. Although the place was extremely busy we were taken care of very well! Deff recommend!
2020-09-12,5,Amazing Red Snapper and delicious Papa Rellena. The creamy potato consistency of the Potato balls was perfect. Top em both off with the white garlic sauce and you will leave here happy! Great place for a date in these tough times
2020-09-08,4,Charming little spot in Hoboken for good Cuban/Puerto Rican food. The appetizers were all delicious and the service was very good, but the mofongos were unfortunately too dry and salty for our liking.
2020-09-07,5,Such great food and prices! Really cute. I loved it a lot and I will be back. Parking is a little bit difficult because it's in the city
2020-09-07,5,Yes!! Love this little hole in the wall. I used to work in town and a co worker took me to pick up food which is how I found out about it. It's so tiny inside but they do have tables outside too. You can't go wrong here!
2020-09-05,4,After a weekend after in Long Beach Island, we come here and it was such inviting place even though we were casual post beach looking . Unfortunately,  I have been ordering slightly boring lately because I'm on keto diet but my boyfriend ordered the award winning dish! Shrimp mofongo , one of the tops ones I have had outside of Puerto Rico!
2020-08-28,5,The owner was there and sat us safely! Such a cute spot with great food! As a Latina, I give this place the seal of approval and authenticity!
2020-08-28,5,This place offers outdoor seating, appropriate pricing for authentic food and a clean restroom in accordance with covid 19 guidelines. I would come here for any meal during the day; the ambiance is romantic, warm and friendly just like the Caribbean. Meter parking is offered on all sides of this block making it easy to find and have after dining here as well.
2020-08-28,5,Cute little BYOB spot in downtown Hoboken. I have been here several times and it's always been really good. The best Cuban spot in Hoboken for sure. Great service & amazing empanadas!
2020-08-24,5,I had my first dining experience at La Casa this past Friday (I've ordered take out once before).  While they have limited outdoor seating, you can now call to make a reservation.  I went with a friend at 8 pm and we were seated quickly.  The service was outstanding the entire time - Henri was so pleasant and brought us complimentary spinach & cheese empanadas to start (vey good!).  We also shared one papa rellana (very big) and the Tostones Rellenos stuffed with shrimp (4 in an order). Everything was so tasty.  For our main, we shared the garlic chicken & shrimp entree which comes with 2 sides - we did yuca frita and tostones (fried plantains).  We also added a side of rice to go with the chicken & shrimp.  The yuca frita was so crispy and I love the sauce with the chicken & shrimp.  The portions are very generous - we could not finish everything.  We couldn't believe how low our bill was after all that food - the best part is it's BYO.  Hope to try them again sometime soon.
2020-08-19,5,Love love this place. I feel like they have gotten better and went above and beyond during the covid. Food is absolutely delicious and red snapper so freshly fried. Super fresh ingredients and freshly prepared!!!
2020-08-18,1,Horrible place. The food was massively expensive, service was horrible, and the wait was way too long. The mofongo con pollo was dry and the portions were way too small for the price. As a Puerto Rican i am honestly ashamed that this is what our food is being portrayed as. Tasteless and over priced. If the food was good quality it really wouldnt have mattered what the cost was.  But I have been to places where the platters are big, and the food is great for half of the price. If all of this isnt enough, we literally got kicked out of our seating area after having payed almost $100. I have 5 simple words for this place. Never again in my life.
2020-08-17,5,The Pernil is out of this world--it literally melts in your mouth and is so rich in flavor. La Casa is consistently good, I've never had a bad meal, nor a cold meal, and I really can't find a reason to complain. Generous portions, too!I am so glad I found this place, and that they deliver to Jersey City!
2020-08-13,3,Place is small so I suggest take out only Order 6 empanadasThe quality of the meat was pretty good but they were very small compared to others I've hadAlso they were wrapped in foil so they got smashed  togetherNot bad but could use some improvement Will return
2020-08-11,4,Service was quick. The empanadas were amazing. Cute little spot in the heart of Hoboken.
2020-08-02,5,Amazing place, its one of those hidden gems that you just take you special person for romantic date type of day.
2020-07-15,5,What's not to love about this place. Everything is delicious; portions are generous and prices reasonable, and staff very friendly. It's my fave!
2020-07-06,5,Not fancy at all, pretty cheap. Ordered beef + sauteed onions w/ salad and rice sides. Every dish was great. Also very close to the waterfront.
2020-06-12,5,This place is friggn delicious. The chicken sandwich is out of this world. Empanadas are delicious. Rice and beans - so so good!!!  This place is in our delivery rotation at least twice a week.
2020-06-02,5,If you are craving for Latin food, this is the place. I went there to get food to go to sit at the nearby park. For a vegetarian, I am happy with their available options. In my case, I had several spinach and cheese empanadas as well as an order of tostones. The price is very reasonable and I was pleasantly surprised with the size of tostones. It was very tasty and I learned quickly that the nearby Canadian Geese liked it too. As I sat at the nearby park, the geese must have immediately smelt my food and approached me directly at the bench. It was close and personal. I gave them some tostones and they were coming back for more and more. I wanted to eat these yummy tostones as well and when I stopped feeding them, some geese were hissing at me and making loud cries. So I continued to eat these really good tostones and saved the crumbs for them. So remember, this food is so awesome Canadian geese want them too.
2020-04-10,5,One of my favorites in Hoboken. The staff is the friendliest, the prices are beyond reasonable, the coffee/cafe part is some of the freshest I've had, and the soups are filling and incredibly authentic. Great apps and you cannot miss on the entrees.
2020-03-12,5,The food was excellent. I had a cubano with mojo sauce which was delicious. Everything that came out of the kitchen smelled and looked amazing. The restaurant is pretty small inside but cute. Prices were pretty reasonable especially considering the food quality.
2020-03-07,5,Great service with very welcoming people! The garlic shrimp and beef empanadas are two of my favorites!
2020-02-25,5,Must try!! A tried this place based on the reviews and a strong craving for some good Puerto Rican food. This place did not disappoint. When you walk in you see the adorable wall and ceiling decor and are immediately drawn in, despite the place being very small the host was very accommodating and made us feel at home. We started with the chicken empanada and papa and that was a delicious start. It was so fresh and we were looking forward to the rest of the food. Definitely get the Cuban sandwich!! That was my favorite and honestly the rest of the food we got, pernil and rice and beans was to die for as well. The price is right and I would definitely come back and even order for delivery since I saw they have that option. It was beyond my expectations and I will recommend to family and friend
2020-02-23,5,What a nice little spot tucked in on Newark street. The restaurant is small with maybe 5 or 6 tables. There are also a few seats available at the counter. We ordered the pernil. It comes with two sides and it was very good. The tres leches cake and cafe con leche were excellent. Waitstaff was friendly and attentive. Great first impression. Will definitely be back.
2020-02-20,4,This place was really cute and the food was great especially for the price. I got the pernil lunch special with arroz amarillo and a salad and I split some tostones with a friend. Only downside is the place is a bit cramped but other than that I recommend it!
2020-02-18,4,I used Yelp to search for a restaurant in Hoboken to have early dinner this past Saturday with my husband. He already had plans for later in the evening in Hoboken. I found La Casa in the results after searching on Yelp for a restaurant that wouldn't be too far from the train station (it was cold out on Saturday!) We arrived at around 5pm and the restaurant was busy but there were 2 empty tables. When we were seated, the waiter stopped by shortly to give us a menu (on a tablet). We were a bit confused because the first page showed a Valentine's Day menu. We thought that they had a limited menu for the weekend, until my husband swiped left and the next page showed their regular menu. PHEW! I had my heart set on pastelon (which I haven't had in YEARS!) Unfortunately, they only serve it once a week (Friday?). I also wanted to try their potato salad but they were out. :'(  Instead, I ordered what felt like a little bit of everything (lol) - arroz con gandules, maduros, and 2 empanadas (guava and cheese/chicken) with a slushy limeade. My husband had the grilled chicken with arroz con gandules and macaroni salad. See pics. Everything tasted AMAZING! The rice was exactly the way my mom makes it! I even mentioned that to the waiter. He laughed. :) The food at La Casa is authentic Puerto Rican food! You will not be disappointed. KNOW BEFORE YOU GO - This restaurant is very narrow. They have limited seating with a couple of additional stools by the "bar" area.
2020-02-16,5,Wow! Trust the reviews. This place is five stars for food and service. I LOVE good service and this place over-delivered (Thanks Henry!). The food is so good. The mofongo with chicken was so good with such perfectly seasoned and cooked chicken- juicy interior and crispy exterior. Cute warm space with mostly tables for two and a small bar in the front. Latin music playing and all the staff speaking their native language just addd to the awesome experience. Can't wait to return!
2020-02-14,5,If you don't know, you will probably pass right by.  We found the place by accident, and what a gem.  Absolutely amazing food, their cafe con leche is out the world, and the their wait staff are attentive.  Will definitely go back, especially for the brunch.
2020-02-13,5,Are here for the first time last night. My wife and I both had the grilled chicken with garlic sauce. Absolutely delicious and the place is small and lovely. Service was impeccable. Will def be returning.
2020-01-25,5,Finally, I found my go-to Spanish restaurant in Hoboken. I've been here back to back weeks for dinner and then brunch, so this review was a must. For dinner, we had the croquetas and chicharrón as an appetizer and both were incredible. For dinner, I had the garlic chicken and shrimp with morro. The garlic sauce was light and amazing to mix in with the rice. The chicken and shrimp were perfect as well. We ended dinner with tres leche which had a good dry to milk ratio. The café con leche was great and super strong. For brunch, we started with every type of empanada (spinach and cheese, chicken and beef) and the ham croqueta. So many different amazing flavors and they have a pink sauce to go with it. The café con leche again because it's a must. For my entree, I had the mangu with fried cheese, salami, and eggs. As we left we opted for the morir soñando to go. The fresh orange juice really stood out and tasted great. This spot is a super affordable, great service, a super beautiful and small restaurant in Hoboken. Highly recommended!!
2020-01-17,5,Always on the hunt for a great Ropa Vieja  .Well luckily happened upon LaCasa on a Thursday night And the Ropa Vieja did not disappoint as well as the side of vegetables-menu takes don't getting  used to as most Spanish food comes with rice and beans -here main comes with 2 sides so have to order these separately .Skip the yuca fries -undercooked instead either tostones or Maduros a better choice Staff is warm and friendly and although narrow the space is cozy enough for a romantic rendezvous Big bonus the incredible music
2020-01-05,5,This place is literally like my home, I always come every other week, to stop in to dine. The food is very delicious and consistent as always. The energy of the restaurant is warm and vibrant. The owner, and the staff make me feel welcome all the time.
2019-12-22,5,Excellent little spot . Best ropa vieja I've had In years.  My husband had Mofongo with shrimp.It had a white sauce in it never seem this before, but it was amazing!!Can't wait to go back!!
2019-12-16,5,Best food in Hoboken, and possibly in NJ.Flavorful food, great prices, big portions. It's the kinda place that you want to go there every day. Delicious Cuban sandwich, best Tres Leches desert, Guava Cheesecake is off the hook. Sancocho is omg! Just try all the dishes.
2019-12-05,5,Cute hole in the wall spot.  Excellent quality food.  Consistently good.  Well priced.  One of my favorite places in Hoboken.
2019-12-01,4,Great food at a great price. For around $15 on average, you get to choose one main and two sides. I've had the ropa vieja and rabo encendido on various occasions, and both were cooked to perfection, if just a bit on the salty side. The sides are also wonderful. I usually get the boiled vegetables each time to stay healthy, and I've tried the sweet plantains, green plantains, and yucca, all very good.
2019-11-24,5,What a hidden gem! I came here on a Saturday night with my boyfriend for date night and was not disappointed at all! The restaurant is small, intimate, and decorated very nicely. The lighting is very dim each table had a candle. When we arrived there was a couple of tables open and we had the option to choose where we wanted to sit. Once we sat down we were given two menus which were on a tablet so you can see what each entree and side looks like. They don't have alcohol but it's BYOB and who doesn't love that?! To start we ordered two beef empanadas which were crispy and seasoned very well. For our entrees we ordered mofongo with fried pork and pernil with rice and fried yuca. Everything was seasoned well and portions the are generous. The only thing that needed a little more salt in my opinion was the mofongo. Overall, I highly recommend coming here. The prices are inexpensive, it's BYOB, food is great, and it has a very romantic feel to it.
2019-11-22,5,The food is outstanding!!!! 10 stars, specially the mangu a La Casa. Súper bueno todoo
2019-11-14,5,Wonderful food & wonderful people who work there! Everything we got there, everyone enjoyed. I had the pork dinner with both plantain sides. The sweet ones were rich, soft, and delicious and the fried green plantains were really something special. Crisp, not greasy at all. And you gotta love both of their house sauces!  My husband got the beef with rice and yuca. He enjoyed everything. Kids got the cubano sandwich and the pork sandwich and both were very happy. You can't beat the quality of food for the price, service, and quantity. I'd eat here weekly if I live there!
2019-11-04,5,10 months later and this place is still my favorite restaurant in Hoboken. We legit come here at least once-twice a week. 1 for the people, 2 for the food, 3 for the atmosphere. You will NOT go wrong with La Casa :). Keep it up, my friends. I'm definitely going to miss this place when I move out of Hoboken. I will for sure make a special trip just to see my friends here.As I always say, see you all in two days!
2019-10-29,2,What a joke this place is.The delivery service is no bueno.The person who picks up the phone doesn't sound like she cares much.The food arrived 2 hrs after the call.Not a fan.
2019-10-26,5,This place is crack. The spinach empanadas (when made fresh ) are to die for.  My fave meal is bistec de palomilla. Just perfect.
2019-10-03,5,Great place! Fantastic food and excellent service. Highly recommend if you are in the area. The chicken dish with white sauce is fantastic and you get two sides with every entree
2019-09-26,3,Decent food- Good taste, nothing to rave about. VERY FRIENDLY STAFF- they deserve 5 stars. No alcohol at the bar... You have to bring a wine bottle for them tomake a sangria for 12$. Seating is Very tight.. Come here for a second date if you both dont drink, metered parking in the area til 9.
2019-08-31,5,Excellent little spot for a reasonable priced dinner and delicious food! I've walked by many times and aroma was fantastic. Finally, My boyfriend and I went on a week night- sat outside and ordered a few empanadas to start with some tasty sauces! I had skirt steak and he had shredded beef in a sauce- and you get to choose two sides! We took some of our plantains and yucca fries home! Service was friendly and quick! Oh and it's BYOB! Less than $50 date night! I'll take it.
2019-08-30,5,This is one of Hoboken's gems. May they never change. I love their cubanos. They also have the best beef empanadas in town. Service is great and prices are unbelievable.
2019-08-28,1,Wishing Zero star was an option. Worst place to eat. Horriable experience, poor quality of food. There was pubescent hairs in our food. When asked for a manager they were sorry we dont have one.Dont recommend this place. La isla will always be successful and our favorite compared to your establishment by far. Learn how to greet, speak, cook, and parpared clean dishes.
2019-08-21,5,OMG...Just OMG. So good. I picked this up by chance on a rainy day for my boyfriend and I. It was the BEST Spanish/Latin food I have had in a very long time. I had grilled chicken with rice and beans. Heaven! My boyfriend had sancocho.  I tried. I don't even like soup!  The staff was friendly too, So yay!
2019-08-21,4,Good was excellent!! Service was ok.  Waiters seem to need more training. Overall would certainly go back.
2019-08-09,5,Unbelievably cheap for how much food you get, have gotten 3 dishes and none of them disappointed. I plan on going back more!
2019-07-27,5,Always great. Attentive staff,friendly and speedy. Prices are incredibly fair. Warm and inviting atmosphere, I really like La Casa.
2019-07-24,2,came here for lunch on a Monday and it was alright. i thought it would've been better but it wasn't. there were a lot of yummy options so we got the chicharron as the appetizer. he got the chicken and i got the churrasco steak. my steak was ok only because it was cooked with so much oil that it was hard to enjoy. the chicken in the white sauce with spinach was really good but the portion was kind of small. nothing about the food was exceptional. but i did feel full and kind of weird since it everything we ordered was either too heavy, fatty or oily. the reason why i'm only giving this place two stars was because i didn't feel welcomed here. the lady who was our waitress did not greet us, she did not look happy taking our order and when we had questions or comments, she did not seem like she wanted to even communicate with us. i felt a little bit uncomfortable and it just felt forced at this place. maybe she was having a bad day but this is a business and you need to leave your personal stuff at the door. there's a lot of options in this area. i can say i was glad to try this place but i don't think i would ever come back.
2019-07-24,4,Excellent most definitely will go back. They have a superb roast pork dish call Pernil. And for lunch, I got yellow rice with black beans and a Pernil dish. Right proportions and unique taste. It's even better with hot sauce. We ordered at 11:00a, came around 12:05p excellent service. I recommend. So many other dishes offered so I will return to try.
2019-07-23,5,The atmosphere is quaint, the staff is super friendly and accommodating. ( small inside  but was able to sit 6 of us)..The food was on point...you know it's good when everyone at the table was focused on eating, rather then talking. The portions are shareable and even had left overs to take home.
2019-07-15,1,I've order several times from La casa and had no complains til today chicken was undercooked. They sent me a new one which wasn't any better.
2019-07-11,2,We've ordered from La Casa a few times before for lunch delivery, but yesterday's food was very salty. Not sure if they got a new cook but we were surprised it was that salty. We ordered the Pollo Asado and Oxtail both of which were lunch specials.
2019-07-05,4,This is one of the cutest feels like home restaurants i've ever been to. I ordered pica pollo which is one of the reason why i did not give it a 5 star, It had no real Dominican taste to it. But it was not bad. We ordered Lemonade which was Delicious. Reminded me of being in the Isla. The fish was delicious was tasteful. The salad was also good. The mojo with yuca was good but the mojo need that Cuban flavor, it just tasted like butter and not ajo. The bistec encebollado was AMAZING! Perfectly cooked with the onions, so tasteful. The mofogo, is the other reason why not the 5 star. The mofogo was not to good. The chicharron did not taste like a Dominican/PuertoRican makes it, nice and crunchy and it was not inside the mofogo like its typically suppose to be. Other wise, I loved it, beautiful place, good was good and the server was very nice and pleasant!!!
2019-07-02,5,WOW. I've been dying to try this place since I moved to hoboken two years ago. I finally made it, and I don't know where to begin! The prices are so cheap, the food is unbelievable. We got the empanadas, papa rellena, and two different steak dishes. Everything was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The services was very friendly! Of you haven't been yet, I definitely recommend!
2019-06-28,4,This is a cute little spot to drop into if you're ever in the area. Me and my bf were just taking a stroll and I wanted to go to Insomnia Cookies but the line was super long and this place caught his eye instead (no this is not a dessert place, he's just greedy). He wanted to pop in and have a beer and maybe an appetizer. To our surprise, they do not sell liquor; but that's totally fine because it's BYOB. It's really cute and cozy and quite romantic. The lighting is dim and the decor is quite sultry. I felt like we were on a real date even though we didn't plan it. It was pretty late at night, like 11:15pm and there were maybe 3 other patrons in there and they were gone by the time we left. I wasn't too hungry so I ordered the Papa Rellena, and my greedy bf ordered pork chicharron w/ white rice and beans. My papa Rellena was delicious. It was pretty big and only cost $2.50 and he said his food was really food too. They had this pink sauce on the table but it wasn't like the pink sauce you get in other Dominican restaurants, this was so good and it had a little kick to it that I really enjoyed. My man even put it on his chicharron. The staff was really friendly, multiple people greeted us (in that really nice, not forced kinda way) our waiter was a little forgetful but it wasn't that big of a deal. And they have Country Club Sodas. If you know, you know. I'll def be back to try some of their other menu options.
2019-06-27,3,This place was in a very nice area, we ate outside which was nice, it was a beautiful day. However the food was just ok. Growing up in a Hispanic household it's definitely hard to come close to that home cooked meal but this food almost tasted like it was catered to the area and the people who live around the neighborhood. To put it nicely the food was bland. It left much to be desired, the seasoning was lacking tremendously. The only thing that I ate that I felt was really good was the guava and cheese empanada so I recommend that! The restaurant has good prices and the service was great though so I mean if you are used to eating bland food then this is the perfect Spanish food restaurant for you but if you're used to a home cooked Spanish meal then I don't recommend it.
2019-06-02,4,Stopped by here on my way to somewhere else for some take out. I was in the mood for a steak sandwich and this place was close to Hoboken terminal. I figured I'd have enough time to grab and go on my layover between trains.I sat at the bar to wait for my order, but I did look around at the space while waiting. There's a bar to the left as you walk in and tables on the right. It's a relatively small space. Got my steak sandwich to go and ended up eating it on the train. The size of the sandwich was good, as well as the amount of the steak. The bread was nicely toasted and I was happy with the taste of the steak. The steak wasn't too tough or bland. It had a good flavor.As a sidenote, they seem to have some good lunch specials, but I was unfortunately too late to try them. I think their lunch ends at 3pm. Maybe next time.
2019-05-28,4,This place has the best mofongo I have ever had! I would recommend the shrimp mofongo to everyone! It is very hearty and delicious!
2019-05-27,5,I love the empanadas and also the special dipping sauces they give you.  I've only picked up to go although the food is awesome and everyone is very hospitable.  Looking forward to eating here.
2019-05-17,5,I loved the vibe in this restaurant ! Great music, service, and food. Just a warning   : the plates are pretty big, I could have shared my plate. I liked how they used iPads that show all the items easily with great visuals. Everything tasted great ! Not a really big space so I wouldn't suggest it for big groups. Overall, I would return here frequently if I lived in the area.
2019-05-03,1,So i went here for the first time with my co-worker and it started of well enough. For one the woman with bleach blonde hair with black roots at first didnt seem friendly. She only seemed to acknowledge my co-worker who is of dominican decent. She seemed annoyed that even though the order was placed over the phone together that we would be paying separate. My co-worker paid with a debit card while i paid with cash. Instead of asking me if i wanted. Reciept for my purchase she instead crumbles it up and throws it in the garbage. She doesnt even apologize for doing it she then proceeds to unfold it and slams it on the table while giving to me.......the sandwich was dry and they only give you a thin piec e of steak on your steak sandwich. I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE NOR WILL I BE RETURNING.
2019-04-27,5,I come here at least once every few weeks, if not more frequently! The lunch special Pernil with 2 sides is my go to, and is by far my favorite single meal in Hoboken. The employees that work there are so nice and I look forward to going in there to pick up my food! Pernil, Maduros, Yellow rice, side salad! Everything is great, favorite little spot in Hoboken
2019-04-21,5,The food was excellent. Nice and cozy spot in Hoboken. We had relleno de papa and mofongo. Everything was tasty and the service was swift. Definitely coming back.
2019-04-14,4,This place has a cool Cuban vibe.  We sat outside as the weather was pretty nice.  Big mistake.  Had to endure a table of millennials droning on about nonsense at a high volume the entire time.  Besides that torture, the food was excellent.  Had a beef empanada and papa rellena.  Both were very good.  Could have been warmer though.  Wife had a grilled chicken dish and liked it.  I had the pernil and it was quite good, although a little dry.  The owner just came and kicked the millennials out.  Thank the Lord!  Would definitely come back!
2019-04-03,5,The food here is amazing! Every time I've ordered, I and anyone else with me at that time, has loved it. Tonight they forgot one of my sides (never had this happen previously) but they delivered it kindly, rapidly, with no problem at all, and included a piece of cake, on the house. They treat their customers the way customers should be treated! If you've never tried La Casa, you have to! You will not regret it. So so so good!!!
2019-03-31,5,The food is so good!!!I really appreciate the staff here because I could've lost my wallet if I was at other restaurant. The owner kept my wallet in an envelope and returned it to me today when I called! So lucky!
2019-03-30,5,Excellent food and warm service. Just had an extended lunch after visit to Stevens President of the college was right in his speech food is really  good here!
2019-03-20,5,Went last week for the first time. There were 6 of us so we ordered a load of food , from the croquettes to the whole red snapper was fantastic! And we are all born and raised in Hudson County so we know good food. Then the owner Russ came out and recommended some of the deserts and we ordered most of them and the coconut cake was the best I ever had !By the way don't pass up the cafe con leache , ya wont get better anywhere in Jersey! Overall can't wait to return
2019-03-16,5,Fantastic Hispanic food place. Fried plantains, meats and fried stuff. BYOB policy but non alcoholic drinks were v good. Very affordable and a great small lovely place to be.
2019-02-16,4,Great oxtail lunch special for $10.95. Ordered flan for dessert and it was delicious with a cup of Cuban coffee
2019-02-16,2,Honestly we came here because of the reviews. Let me first say their service is great and our waiter was super nice. But honestly the food is very overrated. We did not get what the hype was about. We got the Tostones Rellenos as an appetizer. Too creamy. By the time the entree came I lost my appetite and was nauseous from it. And we got the Pollo al Aijillo. It's basically chicken with cream on it. Super basic and bland. no flavor or anything going on. I had to force myself to eat it.  I don't think I'd come back here again.
2019-02-15,5,La Casa has become one of our favorite Cuban places in the area. Absolutely love the space, although small, its cozy and tastefully decorated. I personally recommend making a reservation considering there's very few tables. The food is delicious- specifically love the shrimp mofongo, empanadas, bistec empanizado, and croquettes. On top of it all- it's BYOB! An absolute must in Hoboken.
2019-01-29,5,Very good food! This place is a gem the food is so flavorful and tasty. The environment was amazingly cozy and friendly. Nice place for a date night for sure.
2019-01-27,5,It took a while for our food to come out even though we were the only people there and got there pretty much as it opened. Not sure why that took so long. Then the music was louder than needed. As far as the food, I ordered the omelette with spinach and tomatoes - very good. Home fries were about right. Coffee was good. Sweet plantains were cooked perfectly. Not good for large parties. Most of the tables were two-seaters with only one a 4-seater.
2019-01-27,5,Walked in here randomly after the gym right across the street and was pleasantly surprised! Super delicious food, amazing service, the owner is very nice, friendly, funny, and very hospitable! Definitely coming back here again. Do not miss it!
2019-01-25,5,My girlfriend and I decided to get dinner here one night since she stops by for lunch all the time and wanted me to try it. It's in a very convenient location right by the PATH station. It's Hoboken though so finding parking is a crap shoot. The restaurant is very small and doesn't have a lot of tables. I know they cater to a lot of delivery and take out orders.The wait staff is very polite and knowledgeable on the menu options. They handed us both an iPad instead of a menu, but hey, it's 2019. You still order with the server though so you're not making selections on the tablet. After asking a couple of questions, I settled on chicken empanadas and the oxtail stew. The empanadas were done very well and the flavor was excellent. The oxtail stew came with two sides, as all the entrees do, so I got yellow rice and vegetables with it. They have many side options including beans and plantains but I'm not a huge fan of those. The vegetables had a lot of garlic in it, which can be good or bad depending on your taste. The oxtail was cooked perfectly and the flavors were very rich and robust. I added a little hot sauce to each bite to give it a good kick.I am definitely interested in coming back and trying out other things on the menu, but I honestly may never get myself to not order the oxtail stew.
2019-01-20,5,I ordered breakfast from here this morning.  The eggs Benedict brunch is amazing.  The delivery was a little slow, but the food and service was good.
2019-01-19,1,Just ordered food from here and I told them to put it on a separate plates meaning the rice in the bigger container as usual and the meat on another dish they sent me this small rice with these sweet weird tasting beans and I never received my soda . Delivery driver straight left my food in the emergency room area which is rude and not good for customer service he or she should know better we are in Hoboken I would never order from here again ! El pollo a la plancha is bland !!! If your going to have a Spanish spot throw some flavor into the food not flavor as in the beans they tasted sweet I could have gotten sweet plantains if I wanted something sweet that I understand it's closing time but your clearly opened for a reason ! But never again nasty ass food that I threw out which is sad and a waste , this place is losing its touch it had when they first opened disgusting and sad to say it's falling apart .
2019-01-17,5,We love ordering from this spot , the food is amazing and with a homemade style that reminds me how the food from Puerto Rico really taste like  ( fresh ) , Honestly best Latin food in Hoboken & lest not forget  the staff is very lovely !
2019-01-16,5,Yummy for the Tummy!!If you love a good hole in the wall, this place is for you.  Food is delicious, decent prices, good size portions, fresh homemade deserts and bathrooms are clean . . .what more can you ask for! The staff is very warm, friendly and go above and beyond to make sure you are satisfied with your meal.  Better yet, the owner has taken great pride in the decor of the restaurant so check out the real flowers hanging from the ceiling and all the hand picked details that make this place so warm and inviting.You won't be disappointed!
2019-01-14,4,So I did not go towards the back of this place so I do not know if there is more seating .. from what I saw .. it's small as heck in there! Nonetheless probably the best food near the path. The staff was friendly, offered suggestions, and was attentive. I ordered the chicken and shrimp in garlic sauce... the sauce is a white garlic sauce which was very tasty. It came with two sides and I had yucca and beans. I wanted the arrow gandules but I'm trying to watch my figure. The food was flavorful and was a good size. Next time I have my eye on the pollo guisado or the mofongo. The menu has a lot of choices which is great for a small Spanish food restaurant. I'll be back
2019-01-11,5,I love this place. I'm here just about every week. I recommend the sancocho, pernil, oxtail (def try it), and guava empanadas.That being said, it's uber cramped and tough to get seated on the weekend.
2018-12-26,5,The food was amazing had the empanadas and chichorones they were amazing the waiter on wed night was very accommodating would really suggest to all my friends
2018-12-16,5,This is by far my favorite restaurant in Hoboken. It's not huge but has a great atmosphere and is in close proximity to the PATH train. It's very reasonably priced and you get quite large portions. It's also great if you want a snack and can quickly grab a delicious empanada to-go.
2018-12-13,3,UPDATE:After not receiving my order, Alan from the restaurant was in contact with me and offered me a free meal. He was very kind, apologetic and helpful. I took him up on his offer for a free meal a couple days later. Can't say that I was disappointed with the meal, there's just better in the area. 2 star review but bumped up to a 3 for the extra customer service.
2018-12-05,4,I feel like I may have hit an off day here. I would have given it 3 stars but the owner was there and was extremely welcoming and brought us some apps on the house while we waited for our dishes so that makes up for it. I ordered one of the specials for that day and they didn't have anymore which I found odd because it wasn't that late it was about 7:30. I went with a chicken dish which was fine flavor wise. The chicken had a lot of hard fat on it. I had a side of broccoli that was under cooked and extremely hard. My friend got a shrimp dish but when it came out we were kind of surprised to see it was more like a few shrimp in a bowl in almost a soup. She also got broccoli which was under cooked. You can beat the pricing or welcoming service and seeing the other reviews I'm assuming it was just an off day but I would say it was more of a 3 on the food.
2018-12-03,4,Found this restaurant on my way to Washington St from PATH. Nice restaurant. pretty decor, good service, close to PATH and good food.
2018-12-03,5,This place has become one of our go-to places when we get visitors in town. Their pernil and their yuca are incredible! Get the special creamy garlic sauce and you'll want to be able to purchase it and take it home. We've never had a bad dish here. The servers are friendly and yes, it's a bit small inside but worth the wait if you happen to stumble upon it. Reasonably priced and filling!
2018-11-27,5,This place is off the beaten path a bit, but has great food that's also inexpensive. Their seafood is spot on and really fresh, especially the stewed calamari. The portions are quite substantial.Gave the mixed grill a try and I'm really glad I did. It was perfect. Everything was juicy and well-seasoned, and there was plenty on the plate.The service was also great. The food came out quickly and the waiter (and possibly owner?) was very cordial and friendly.Will definitely be back whenever I'm in the area again.
2018-11-27,3,Nice addition to the hoboken food scene. It is very easy to find average cuban/dominican food but hard to find good stuff. I was hoping for the best with this new spot. We started with a couple sandwiches. The pernil sandwich and the cuban. The bread was not too crunchy or stale like some cuban places. They press the sandwiches but they don't get too hard. The pernil sandwich is straightforward and delicious. The roast pork is moist and has good flavor. Doesn't seem like they have anything else on it but still hits the spot. The cuban sandwich also is solid. The sandwich has the perfect blend of flavors and textures. This type of sandwich is everywhere and hard to make stand out but this one did.I also had to try the mofongo. I went with the vegetable mofongo. This type of dish needs a lot of seasoning and it didnt have it. Maybe the pork mofongo would have more seasoning but this one missed. The empanada's were also pretty solid. I tried the chicken and the beef. The dough and filling were solid and I loved the sauces that came with it. Empanada's also are hard to make well and they did a good job with these. They tasted homemade and fresh. Overall, La Casa is a welcome new delivery option. It probably won't be my go-to since this type of food isn't my favorite cuisine but it will be added to the rotation. Good luck La Casa.
2018-11-27,5,If u look for a great latin American food, taste, price and ambiance... don't miss this little pearl in Hoboken, food is really delicious and u gonna get so satisfied plate size are really good, ask for the sancocho is really good, also I have oxtail ... for my taste is really good ... decoration is really nice and the staff very friendly
2018-11-15,5,This is by far the best food in Hoboken... Amazing ambiance... And the best service you could ever ask for
2018-11-15,1,This was my first time ordering with them and delivery time was a half hour over what was written. Eventually when the food finally got here it was cold, sandwich was soggy. French fries were full of Grease. Horrible presentation, horrible first impression will never order again.
2018-11-06,4,Very good I order from them frequently. Food is always fresh and made on the spot. Good coffee and friendly staff. I know a few other people that order from them regularly too. Sometimes my order is slightly off, which is the only reason for 4 stars.
2018-11-03,4,Fresh, delicious, amazing food in a cozy warm environment. The wait staff is attentive and considerate. We found this place on a whim and I'm so glad we did!
2018-11-03,5,This might be one of the best Eggs Benedict I had. Gorgeous looking plate with the best sausages I had, delicious sauce and eggs served on a bed of spinach with garlic sauce on the side. Next time, I'll branch out and try other Colombian dishes. Oxtail soup looks yum!Great place for brunch or lunch! Highly recommend
2018-11-02,4,Cozy place to have dinner, we started with a couple empanadas w/ ground beef that were top notch, gotta try.  Followed with the oxtail and skirt steak.  The oxtail was appropriately tender and packed some nice flavor, definitely a good option served over the yellow rice.  Skirt steak was egregiously over cooked, which is easy to do to skirt steak because it's so thin.  It's served covered in onion and what I guess was chimichurri, had nice flavor but too bad the meat was charred (it was supposed to be medium well) - this is why I'm docking them a star.  Also tried the morir sonando, fresh squeezed OJ mixed with sweetened condensed milk.  Quite refreshing!
2018-10-22,5,Really enjoyed our meal there. We only had small plates and no entrees and everything was great. We would go back there again. The place is small though so it may not be ideal for parties.
2018-10-13,5,Delicious lunch. Had a Cesar salad and the Camarones Empanizado Sandwich. I would highly recommend this great spot!
2018-10-10,4,4.5****Now I'm a new regular to this place. Glad we have a place like la casa in Hoboken! The food is delicious, big portions and priced just right. Of course it doesn't hurt that it's byob as well! Great casual place if you want some nice Cuban food but don't want to break the bank like the other Cuban. Love the location near the path, gym, cvs. Definitely worth a visit, or three.
2018-10-05,5,Delicious!! Rice & Beans as if from your home kitchen made by grandma. A must!!! Superb service!
2018-09-30,5,The manager is super friendly and gives great service. The place is beautiful and the staff is very warm and accommodating. We love the Empanadas. I am positive we will be back again and again. Good service is hard to find in Hoboken. Bravo!
2018-09-29,5,Best Cuban spot in Hoboken! Small place with a great staff and amazing food. Prices are super cheap for the quality and quantity of food you get. Dinner for 2 for under $40 and you leave feeing full and satisfied? Sign me up. The steak dishes are all very flavorful and very good portions. All meals come with two sides: fries, rice, salads etc. Cant go wrong with any of them! I especially love the fries. They also have a variety of sauces. The garlic one is my fave but they also have a Sriracha mayo that's so good as well. As many Cuban spots do they have daily weekly specials, so check the menu before you come and I recommend getting something from the specials! The inside is pretty small with a few tables and a little bar seating area. Great for a date night spot. They do also offer an outdoor seating area for the warmer weather days. The staff is amazing. Fast and friendly service. Always feel welcomed here. They also do take out and delivery. Definitely check out La Casa if you are looking for your Cuban fix!
2018-09-24,5,The atmosphere is very nice. The food is excellent and very authentic. Try their empanadas and  frozen limeade. I think it's BYOB so bring a pint if you want to drop something into the limeade to take it up 10 notches (its great in its own of course). I went to La Casa 4 times in two weeks for lunch.
2018-09-22,3,I really wanna like this place. I'm Ecuadorian and I'm always for good Latin food to remind me of home. I've tried it a few times and each time the food is very bland. I've gotten the chicken in garlic sauce and the pork with the salsita and both don't have enough seasoning and are a bit dry. Even the yellow rice is a bit dry. Their black beans are pretty good though. It's okay but I think there are a few other Cuban restaurants in the area that I prefer much more over La Casa
2018-09-20,5,Food are fresh and they also have breakfast !I like the small and cozy feel and Latino music. At first , I thought la casa is a French restaurant from the view of the entrance .It has maybe 4 set of two seats table like a French cafe.The inside has very intense deco. The menu is extensive.It's a BYOB. Price is good for the food and service
2018-09-17,3,Came in on a Saturday at around 5. La Casa is pretty small (and narrow), but there weren't too many people dining there - probably because it was a weird time.To start, we had the chicken empanada, spinach/cheese empanada, and the ham croquette. The empanadas were only okay. They didn't seem too fresh, especially since they took them out of one of those food heaters, but they weren't terrible. The croquette was pretty good.For my main, I had the cuban sandwich. This would have been really good, had they not drenched the bread in butter. I was able to smell all the butter as our waiter was walking towards us with the plate. BF had some kind of pork plate, which comes with two sides so he opted for rice and french fries. For all of this food, we paid $32, which includes tax and tip. Pretty great deal. I'd come back and try some of their other sandwiches but next time, I'll tell them to go easy on the butter.
2018-09-04,3,Stopped by when they just opened for the day what I wanted wasn't ready for another half hr so I'm wondering how is a restaurant open for business but not ready to serve what's on the menu went back for sancocho was okay nothing is go back for
2018-09-03,5,This restaurant is absolutely gorgeous and the service was great. All the food was fresh and you get a lot of food for a low price.
2018-09-03,1,The worst Cuban food I've had in Hoboken. I had the churrasco and it was so fatty (much better from The Cuban); they use sweet plantains for the mofongo instead of green plantains which was a HUGE disappointment. Atmosphere is nice, but food wasn't worth it. The Cuban, Havana, and La Isla are all better options.Also, the service was VERY slow. We were the only ones sitting inside and our food took at least 20 minutes to come out, and our appetizers came out with our actual entrees.
2018-08-28,4,This place is SOOOO GOOD! I highly recommend! We've made it a regular spot. Dinner/Lunch: all of the portions are huge, fresh, delicious, the chicken and beef are tender, rice is always great, and you cant go wrong with the AMAZING empanadas or croquetas. Since its BYO, its fun to come here if you have family or friends visiting, have a bottle of wine, and then take a short walk to see the waterfront which is very close by. Show up early or call ahead. This place is small! Brunch: Think diner breakfast meets hole in the wall in the Caribbean meets upscale, boutique decor. The eggs benny served over papa rellenas (a big fried potato ball) and the french toast are scrumptious and affordably priced. I'd say the cafe con leche is the best in town. Steak and eggs are also a huge, yummy portion. Sometimes they bring warm toast while you wait. We love that they serve authentic Domincan and Cuban breakfast dishes like the Mangu. Hopefully their prices never change, we feel we really get a great deal! Service: Owners/managers are super friendly and always checking in to see if you're enjoying yourself. Theres one young man thats usually working when we go and he's very attentive and provides great service. We appreciate speedy refills of their lemon water. Tips to the management: Your place is great, and smells like a bunch of abuelitas back there cooking! Ditch the air fresheners unless in the bathroom, it interferes with the delicious food smell and is very off putting/chemically when eating.
2018-08-27,5,This has quickly become a new favorite for my girlfriend and I whenever we're in the mood for Cuban food. The place is very intimate and romantic. Completely different from La Isla on Washington. This place perfect if you want a cheap candle lit date night with a significant other or for a first date. The first time we went, I ordered the camarones al ajillo, shrimp in garlic sauce. The sauce was very buttery and garlicky yet very light, I don't know how the chef was able to pull that off but he/she did and I am amazed. It comes with two sides of your choice, I always order rice and beans and my girlfriend always order rice and fries, the fries are very crispy and be sure to ask for the garlic sauce they have to dip your fries in. On both occasions she's ordered the bistec de palomilla, which is a thin sirloin steak with sautéed onions. The steak is so tender and the pan sauce that it comes with is packed with flavor and the portion is so huge. I almost always have to finish the rest of her steaks which I really don't mind since they are that good! The staff are also very friendly and the service is fast if you need it to be and slow if you want to take your time on your date. This place is also byob and there's outside seating.
2018-08-27,5,I'm blown away. The food is SO good! Definitely will be ordering from here again! My food arrived nice and hot & I could literally smell how amazing it all was going to be through the bag lol. (I'm pregnant so smell is a big thing to me right now)
2018-08-27,4,Had a great lunch here 2 weeks ago while celebrating my 15th yr anniversary! Service & food were good. The portions were large. Small place but cute ambiance with a tiny outdoor area.
2018-08-24,4,The food here is great!!! However, Im taking off a star because parts of their dinner menu (not the specials, but the actual dinner menu) is limited to only some days. For example, in the dinner menu they offered Churrasco and Ropa Vieja but it's only served on Tuesday and Thursday. I thought that was a little odd. The last time I came here I ordered an appetizer and 2 entrees (both offered with 2 sides) and they didn't have nor the appetizer that I wanted or the side. A little disappointing but that doesn't take away from the great taste and quality of the food.
2018-08-23,5,Really cool place. We went around 5 on a Thursday. It's very small and was told after 6 can get very crowded. But that was not a problem at all at the time we went. Service was amazing and very friendly. Our waitress was Danny and she was so nice and very helpful.  The food was all delicious we had 3 appetizers and two dinners. Finally for dessert we had the coconut cake.  Literally one of the best pieces of cake I have ever had. We shared the cake but I'd recommend getting your own piece. It's that good!!
2018-08-12,5,This is a great place to go for authentic and fresh Cuban food. Great food for a great price, and the waitstaff is so nice. You can't go wrong with ordering, just make sure to get the empanadas!
2018-08-11,1,Delivery time was horrific. 1h45m for 2 sandwiches and empanadas. Food was cold and soggy. Wound up ordering pizza.
2018-08-11,2,Ordered off of Seamless and got the Pernil, yellow rice and peas and black beans as well as the polla la plancha , fries and black beans. We asked for extra sauce. No sauce was delivered. The fries were soggy. The chicken was dry. The Pernil was pretty good and the beans were good. Maybe it's a delivery thing but wasn't impressed at all. I've had better Cuban.
2018-08-10,5,As a tourist, I must say this has been the BEST meal I've had the entire trip! Neat place with delicious food, amazing staff and an exceptional owner! The service was fast, the food was just what we expected it to be and we got complimentary sangria to complete our meal! I would highly recommend this place for anyone visiting New Jersey! Hands down an amazing restaurant!
2018-08-04,5,Awesome cuban food, atmosphere, byob, very affordable and open late!! Came in for dinner around 10pm because other restaurants in the area were closing. Staff was super nice and accommodating. Cute little restaurant, beautiful decor. Will reccomend to everyone I know and don't know!!!
2018-07-17,4,I've tried some other cuban restaurants in hoboken that weren't so great. I came here for brunch not too long ago and was half expecting to be disappointed yet again. Luckily that didn't happen. The food was actually good! It's an adorable little place. They also get bonus points for playing Selena bc who doesn't love Selena?! Will be back for sure.
2018-07-15,5,Love love love ! Small but the service and food is amazing ! I had to eat it twice in one week ! I'm addicted to the Red Snapper now and even had it delivered to my house. Generous portions at a reasonable price which is rare for Hoboken restaurants . If you want flavor get full and BYOB you can't beat this place !
2018-07-08,5,This is my boyfriend and I's go to spot in Hoboken. They're food is great, especially when you consider the price and portion you receive. And on top of the great food and prices, it's a BYOB. I highly suggest the pulled pork, original Cuban sandwich, roasted chicken or the skirt steak. I also recommend the ribs, but I think they only offer those on Wednesday's. The fresh limeades are to die for, and make a great tequila limeade if you think to being some with you. The wait staff is so sweet, and very accommodating. Overall, cannot say enough great things about la casa. I always bring my friends when they're in town.
2018-07-08,4,Delicious food, reasonably priced, attentive staff. I fear that once the newness wears off, they will catch Hobokenitis (over-priced, mediocre, gimmicky). PLEASE NEVER CHANGE!!!
2018-07-05,4,Yum!!!! So much delicious food and not expensive! What a cute little restaurant super close to the path. The place feels like you're just hanging out with family eating amazing food. We got the pernil and the chicken in garlic sauce. The portions are big and under $15! I love their guava and cheese empanadas - oh mannn. Definitely recommend stopping in here.
2018-07-05,5,So far, the best Cuban food I've had in Hoboken. Everything from the Chicharon de Pollo to the drinks, the fact they have cafe...was appropriate and cooked well. If I am going out to eat, the food has to be worth my money. I expect to pay for the convenience of it being cooked and the fact I don't have to clean dishes. I expect to eat well, be satisfied, have a conversation with friends and family, and not feel cheated when I was done. Even if the restaurant gives me the expectation that they do things differently. This one is cozy, situated in a great spot in Hoboken and has a solid family feel. The food is slightly elevated but is not pretentious or attempting to change the wheel.Service was solid and expedient. They knew when to leave you alone to eat and relax and when to come to give you the check or to attend to a need.Really good empanadas too! Even though there is a great empanada place down the street on Washington, these were a bit better. At least in terms of Cuban, Dominican, Puerto Rican style empanadas. If you want really good Cuban food in Hoboken, this is the right place to get it.
2018-07-03,5,Not only is the food of literally the best, yes the best - The people working in the restaurant are incredible. 100% I'll be back. Thanks for the terrific meal and great service. More places should be like La casa! Nice work!Ordered the garlic shrimp and rice /peas legendary
2018-06-29,4,The food is amazing and incredibly well priced. A great place to go for food. Only con for me is that the owner is very annoying. I come to eat and hang out with my husband, not to have the owner park himself next to us and blab about things I didn't ask to talk about. He talks to everyone it seems and HE can't seem to read the room. Leave us alone, I didn't come here to talk to you. That can ruin a whole experience and it makes me hesitate to return. Take a hint.
2018-06-29,5,This place is awesome. We found it walking around Hoboken and boy was it a pleasant surprise. We waited barley 5 min to get our meal. The prices were fantastic and the food was delicious. Service was awesome too! HIGHLY recommend to anyone passing by! We'll see you again soon La Casa!
2018-06-24,5,This is the best Cuban restaurant in Hoboken! The food is always delicious and fresh, the atmosphere is nice, and the staff are very friendly. Fast service, portions are generous and the prices are very reasonable. Great menu for all times of the day.
2018-06-20,4,Pros1. Beef Empanadas are the Best in New Jersey and New York City. (I have a Suggested what about Shredded Beef Empanadas and call them Ropa Vieja Empanadas)2. The Yuca with Garlic is So Tender.3. The Chicken Stew is Dominican Style so No Carrots or Potatoes.... :( Pero, Still Hella Good! #goDRPRfoooood4. The Oxtail Stew was Flavorful and Tender.5. The Rice is Cooked Well.6. The Ambience is Cozy when I walk in I feel like I'm on Vacation in Puerto Rico or Dominican Republic. Cons1. The Sancocho Soup was good but I'm not a fan of Cerdo (Pork) Sancocho Soup. I expected Oxtails thrown in the Sabroso Fun. ;)2. No Alcapurrias.... #mouthdropped ha ha3. The Chicken Empanadas needs more Flavor, maybe extra Sofrito or Recaito. (The Beef Empanada took me to Abuela's House pero el Chicken took me to the Bodega.)I can't wait to try their Mangu and Bistec.... Overall, Great Puerto Rican/Dominican Restaurant. We cook better than Cubans. #handsdown. I hope they do a Cuchifrito Station at the Jersey City Puertorican Festival in the future.
2018-06-15,4,This is real, authentic Cuban food and it is absolutely delicious! Hands down the best food I ate in New Jersey. I had the  garlic chicken, with black beans and rice and red beans in sauce and they were terrific. I felt like I really was dining in Cuba. The only reason I didn't give it 5 Stars was because of the service. It took the hostess a few minutes to seat us (a party of 3) and our waiter took a few more minutes before bringing us menus and water. Our food came out quite quickly, probably because we were there around 3:00pm. I imagine lunch hour would be a much longer wait. After our food came out it cooled off before we could eat it because we had no silverware! Our waiter quickly fixed the issue and apologized so no harm done. Overall this place has delicious authentic food for a great price ( an entree and two sides for $12 and the portions are huge)And somewhat okay service. I will warn you however- it is quite small. The place can only seat 15-20 People so if you're a big group don't go during rush hour.
2018-06-12,5,this place is so good! i've eaten here multiple times. i've ordered the ham & cheese sandwich for breakfast with a cuban coffee, the best. i've had the cuban sandwich delicious. my friends have ordered the ropa vieja, yuca con mojo, steak sandwich and it's always been so good.order the limeade for a nice refresher! it hits the spot on a hot summer day
2018-06-10,5,omg omg the food here is amazing the proce is reasonable and you get a lot of food.. the food here is delicious order here a lot i definitely recommend this place if u want to have a good homemade spanish meal!!!
2018-06-07,5,Best mofongo I've had outside of Puerto Rico. Great people, great service and the food was plate licking good.
2018-06-03,5,Great spot for real authentic food that's made with love. Everyone just seems so happy from the employees to the customers eating all the yummy food. Cuban sandwich was on point...
2018-05-26,5,I rarely review but so necessary for this place. Authentic food that tasted like abuela's home cooking, great prices, staff was amazing and best of all BYOB! 2 of us each had an appetizer, each had an entree, brought in some whiskey & also had dessert for under $50 (hefty tip included). Small & quaint. All this combined is VERY hard to come by in Hoboken. Can't wait to stop in from brunch.
2018-05-22,5,Started working back in Hoboken recently and am very happy to find more variety in restaurants. La Casa is a great place to eat with affordable prices and good food. I've been coming here multiple times a week for breakfast and lunch now and everything I have had has been really good.Sancocho in cold weather is amazing and they have it as a lunch special with rice for an affordable price.Also mangu breakfast was really good and filling. Will continue to come here for good food and convenience.One issue I had was coming in one day and ordering lunch to go. It took about 30 minutes to get my lunch and everyone who came after me already received their food.Granted, it was a busy day. Other than that hiccup I do recommend coming Update* finally had La Casa Pernil. Very tasty! Not too salty but also just a weeeee tiny bit dry. Still good flavor.
2018-05-22,5,Very authentic.  Breakfast was delicious.  Get the pickled onions on EVERYTHING.
2018-05-20,5,Excellent restaurant. We love their beef empanadas, papa rellena and their churrasco steak.
2018-05-14,4,Very affordable and delicious food, especially the lunch deals. Only reason I don't give 5 stars is because on an occasion they've given me incorrect order.
2018-05-11,5,This service is excellent the food is great tried them a mofongo with the shrimp in garlic sauce.
2018-05-02,5,Wow! Really good, really authentic Spanish food. I had the Sancocho, (Dominican) we shared the ribs, yuca, I had limeade and she had morir sonando.  Super yum!
2018-04-15,5,Found this gem by accident, and I must say it was well worth it! The waiter was so helpful and this place has a nice warm comfort feel to it. This will be my go to spot when I'm in the area again. Thank you for making us feel at home you guys rock!
2018-04-13,5,The best Spanish spot in the world. Really genuine nice people. Food was amazing. 5 stars . The service was amazing and the owner was a gentleman. Def a must spot to eat if your in Hoboken.
2018-03-31,5,The food was very good. The place looks clean and nice. We were a party of 13 and took a while to seat us all because is very small but we had a great experience.
2018-03-29,5,La casa is an amazing BYOB Cuban restaurant.  It has a really homey feel with excellent, well priced food to match.  The portions are also huge. It feels like you're eating at your Cuban grandma's house!
2018-03-26,5,Great food and pretty cheap prices. The chicken soup and pollo guisado are my favorites
2018-03-20,4,La Casa is a cozy Cuban/Puerto Rican restaurant. I typically visit during lunch and it gets crowded pretty fast so I suggest ordering ahead. They're amongst the best lunch specials in town. The food is good and hearty, I can never finish an entire meal. All for $10! I recommend the pernil with arroz con gandules and maduros. Also, try the Cuban sandwich. You won't be disappointed.
2018-03-18,1,Food was bland. Long delivery wait time. Over an hour for tasteless fish and steak sandwich.  Very disappointed.  Don't make the same mistake.
2018-03-13,3,We got off to a rough start my first time around. I sat on hold for 9 minutes while the gentleman that answered the phone had a full conversation with someone at the counter. None of the conversation was of grave importance - believe me, I heard the whole thing. The customer wasn't even leaving, they were eating there. Finally, I hung up after trying to yell into the phone a bit. I tried calling back and it rang without answer for over a minute before I came to the conclusion la casa wasn't in the cards for me that night. But, one bad experience isn't enough to shut me out from a place for good - it happens. So i figured I'd keep it on the radar. After a decent lunch special eaten by my roommate, I decided to give it a shot. The yelpers deserved it. The fans clamored for it. So, alas, I made it to la casa for a meal after a stop at the gym across the street, looking for some quick protein and vegetables. I settled on the steak with onions entree and was pleased to find I could choose broccoli and carrots for sides. The broccoli was listed as the "vegetable of the day". Well, I think this batch of broccoli was also the "vegetable of the day" back when Obama was still in the Oval Office. Old. Hard. Discolored. Nothing you'd wanna eat. The steak was actually a decent size and pretty good, but I had to work around a ton of fat. It was poor quality meat. Recently, I stopped in for a lunch special. Wow, much better than the first 2 trips. The Pernil was amazing and the rice solid. Big portions for a reasonable price. Good flavor when you add the sauces they have. So far a 1, 2.5, and 4.5 star experiences. I'm bumping up to a 3 for now.
2018-03-04,5,This place is super good. Get the steak sandwich and the morir soñando (orange juice drink)
2018-03-02,2,As a Latina I was elated to try some home cooking without being home. I was looking to treat myself on my walk home and saw the cute lookin exterior of this place. Drew me in. It looked like a cute café/library and that's hot to me. Cute but nerdy ... wait, this isn't a dating site. Anyway, I walk in before 4 and start my journey with a café con leche. I make small talk with an older gentlemen behind the counter who's demeanor could be a little nicer but I digress. I drink my coffee which was delicious and order a papa rellena. Both items $2 each. What a miracle. Cheap hispanic food in a highly gentrified town sprinkled with old school Latinos that Jones for a break in prices... you know, like the old times... when you used to walk bare feet in the snow with no shoes... the stories your parents tell you about. Anyway, I ordered to go some ropa vieja and white rice and black beans... damn that sh*t was good. And was 2 meals worth, made my co-workers jelly the next day. I went back a second time and started again with a café con leche and this time tried a beef empanada... let's just say my mother has competition. Try it for yourself. BYOB... but you don't need to drink to have a good time here. Salsa is always playing and the vibe is upbeat. Lookin. Forward to many noshes in the future. Gracias.Edit:Went back and thought I would bring my family since the food was very authentic tasting. Was disappointed when my mother started speaking to an employee or owner in Spanish and he told her to speak English. Will never go back. Ever.
2018-02-23,5,Phenomenal food at a great price. Pollo con ajillo is my favorite but you really can't go wrong with anything here. Owner and staff and are super friendly and go above and beyond to make sure you don't leave disappointed. So happy they opened up here in Hoboken.
2018-02-23,2,I have been here a few times and picked up my food and it's been good. Today, I ordered through Yelp.. well the experience left a bad impression. On a normal day, I would order and pick up. This time, I am stuck at work and am unable to leave. They are three blocks away. I expect they are busy.  I just wanted to know where my food was.1. They do not update their status so I don't even know if my order has been received. I call the restaurant and I get hung up on. 2. I called the customer service number who tells me they are on their way. Cool! I am hungry. I want my food. 3. I get food.. missing is the empanada, the cheese sauce I told them to keep is in there. And the bottle of sparkling water never made it, they substituted for club soda. I run after the delivery dude who disappeared to thin air. 4. Now I call customer service who calls the restaurant again. They come back with credit give me credit for the missing food. I am fuming!! I really wanted my food. I am good all week. All I really wanted was the empanada. I don't know that I will ever order take out from them again. It's not worth it.
2018-02-21,5,I was having a craving for oxtail stew/rabo encendido and decided to try this place for dinner. It's the only place I know in Hoboken that serves oxtail more than once a week (I'm looking at you...La Isla).Other than fulfilling my oxtail craving, I also decided to try the Mofongo de Chicharron, which are just mashed plantains with fried pork and garlic. I do recommend getting the oxtail dish...it was super delicious! I did enjoy the oxtail more than the mofongo as I felt the mofongo with the pork were a bit too dry for my taste. All the main entrees come with your choice of two sides. They have a variety of sides you can choose from, such as beans, rice, plantains, fries, salad, fried egg, veggie of the day, etc. Also, the prices here are very reasonable.Service here is very friendly and efficient. One thing to note is that space in here is pretty tight. I would say that this restaurant seats no more than about 10-15 people. It would be good for small groups.Look no further, I totally recommend coming here to get some Cuban food!
2018-02-21,5,Long day of running around and cycling left me drained. Ran into Basile at La Casa and decided to try a few empanadas and soup (Sancocho for us Puerto Ricans). The Steak was good, the tortillas were fried fresh and not greasy, and the Sancocho was perfectly seasoned, meat-filled and hearty veggies with the taste of home i longed for back when Abuela was around. It was more welcome to feel at home with the great service and family friendly staff. Thanks Basile. You've out-done yourself here!
2018-02-20,1,So disappointed!! The mofongo with chicharrón was not fresh and it overall lacked flavor.. hardly any meat inside.  I tried to give this place a try after looking at one of the pictures with the mofongo in yelp but it was not close to what it looked like.  What a waste of money.. I will not come back to this place.
2018-02-16,1,the only thing good at this place is there fried bananas and rice and beans. the food was over cooked and cold.
2018-02-11,5,The Yuca con Mojo is amazing! The staff is super friendly and helpful. The restaurant decor is excellent, you really feel at home here! And don't forget to BYOB!
2018-02-06,5,The food here is AMAZING. The first time I came I had bacalo and I was in love. Today I had pernil with yellow rice and tostones with the garlic sauce that was off the hook. The young man behind the counter is such a sweet heart. I will definitely recommend this place.
2018-02-02,5,First time in this cute little Cuban joint.  Very reasonable prices for their food, especially for Hoboken.  I had the lunch special- Rabo Encendido, the oxtail stew, which was very delicious.  The server Adalid made some great recommendations  the service was fast and pleasant.
2018-01-31,5,This new spot is great! We ordered take out through grubhub so can't comment on the table service but the food is superb! The ropa vieja was cooked to perfection and the maduros were tasty. We have been to many other spanish restaurants in the area (both Hoboken, union city, north Bergen, etc) and this place is up there.Only suggestion would be to deliver to Weehawken so we can have it more often! :)
2018-01-26,5,What a small little gem of a place! So far, I loved everything I have tried: mangu de la casa (pictured), sancocho (brought me back to life when I was sick last week), empanadas, sandwich cubano, stewed chicken. All absolutely delicious and reasonably priced. Great addition to the neighborhood.
2018-01-25,5,So glad La Casa opened up in Hoboken! I've ordered lunch here two times so far and I'm already obsessed.I ordered the Pollo Guisado (chicken stew) lunch special both times and it was delicious! I'll definitely branch out next time since they offer a wide variety of specials. They come with any two sides you'd like on the menu--everything I tried was delicious so I don't think you can go wrong. Everything was full of flavor while not being too greasy. Their empanadas are also a must-have! They're crispy, flavorful and quite large for $2 (so no excuses!).I can't wait to come into the restaurant to try more of their options :)
2018-01-23,5,Delicious and affordable option for traditional Cuban cuisine. Moro and fried eggs are great sides, but be sure to check out the daily specials if you can't decide what to order! The empanadas are good app choices!
2018-01-21,5,Nice little gem in Hoboken.The restaurant is quite small, so expect to go as couples... not sure what they could do for larger groups. I went as a family of 3, and sat at the largest table (for 4) in the back.The service was friendly and timely. The food was delicious. We started the meal with the chorizo, and ate the ox tail (one of my favorite dishes) and red snapper entrees; with fries, rice & beans, salad, and fried sweet plaintain as sides. I like that the menu has only a few options and cooked well! Truly tasted like a home cooked meal.Bonus: location is right around the corner from Carlo's Bakery (cake boss)!
2018-01-17,4,The food here reminded me of the Spanish restaurants in the Bronx where I grew up, but this place is much nicer and the prices aren't much higher considering it's in prime Hoboken.  There's nothing on the menu that is over $20, so very affordable.  Plus, it's BYOB!For dinner I had the grilled skirt steak which comes with any 2 sides on the menu so I had the tostones and vegetable of the day.  The portions were really big for $15 and I really enjoyed my steak.  My only complaint is that the vegetables seemed like they've been sitting around a bit rather than cooked to order.  My broccoli looked a bit sad and I didn't eat much of it. Overall, not a bad place for a cheap filling meal.
2018-01-16,2,Called for delivery, they only deliver to the downtown area of Jersey City...wish they'd notate that on their media pages!
2018-01-15,5,I almost missed this tiny place. I believed that it used to be the froyo place before. The staff members were very friendly. It seemed that the customers were the regulars, who knew each other and the staff. We sat down near the bar area by the door. Space was very tight and they had to move the tables and chairs around to fit us.We ordered a beef empanada to share. It was crispy outside and tender & salty inside. I could use a little less salt but it was perfect for my husband. I ordered the pollo asado (rotisserie chicken) with sweet plantains and vegetables. The chicken was well roasted and pretty tender. Sweet plantains were soft and sweet and reminded me of Sophie's. Vegetables were pretty standard. My husband got oxtail stew with rice and eggs. Oxtail stew was very flavorful and tender.  The whole thing turned out about $25, which was very cheap for a sit-down dinner in Hoboken.
2018-01-09,5,Stopped in here on a whim the first week it opened and wasn't expecting much, but I was blown away. This is by far some of the best Dominican/ Cuban food I've had. I've been here a few time so far and it's been consistently good every time. I typically sit at the bar and just ask the staff what they recommend, and so far it's surpassed my expectation ten-fold. Outstanding.
2018-01-07,5,We jumped in here seeking refuge from Ho Ho Hoboken. We only intended to stay for a coffee before our train out of a city commandeered by spewy Santas (I saw one actually yack up in CVS), but stayed for food after we saw dishes fly out the kitchen. Food was amazing. Top notch. Ten times better than the other noteworthy Cuban in Hoboken -- La Isla. Cosy atmosphere and staff were so friendly. They're fairly new to town so asked if I'd write a Yelp review saying they're better than La Isla.
2018-01-06,5,The food is amazing every time I go. Even if it's just for a quick empanada. The hospitality as well is impeccable. Definitely a needed restaurant in Hoboken. I definitely recommend and will be returning often.
2018-01-04,5,Very homey spot with very affordable prices and huge portions. We went just looking for somewhere we could get food early in the morning and this was one of the few places open at 7am on a weekend. I'm glad I stopped by. Service was great! It was cold out and their heat hasn't turned on yet so the waitress brought a personal heater for us.Food wise, I got huevos a la casa so potato, eggs, and a choice of ham or bacon. I could do without the ham- it looked like packaged processed meat ham. Lots of potatoes and eggs. Huge portions. Nothing special but I liked it.
2018-01-03,5,My husband and I stumbled upon La Casa during the holiday break and were so happy with our meal.  The food was delicious (especially the Churrasco and plantains), the service was great and I love that it is a BYOB spot. We will definitely be back.
2017-12-30,5,We went here for my girlfriends birthday...food was not only amazing but the ambience of this place was truly fantastic. It's tiny but i think that's what i like most about it. I highly recommend going on a date here!  Really awesome.
2017-12-29,5,Very good food... good quantity... for great price. Great spot.
2017-12-28,4,This was my first time eating here and it was pretty good! Great lunch specials and great prices. The oxtail stew & pollo al ajillo was amazing!! I definitely will be stopping back for lunch again!
2017-12-27,5,Just had an AMAZING lunch!!!.. place is so cute and cozy... Great place to enjoy a bottle of wine and the food is of the hook!!!! Without breaking the bank... FINALLY!!!! What Hoboken needs.
2017-12-27,5,I came across this little gem a few weeks ago and have been meaning to write a review on it.  As soon as you walk in you are greeted by La Casa's friendly staff which makes you feel so welcome.  The decor is great, you can't help but feel so cozy.  Now let's talk about the food, couldn't help but try several of their dishes and I must say none of them disappointed. To start, we tried the empanadas and the papa rellena, they were both very tasty especially with the spicy sauce that goes with absolutely everything!!! Next we had some of the ox tail, I couldn't get enough of this, it had so much flavor I will definitely go back for more.  We also tried the Cuban sandwich, the shrimp in garlic sauce and the churrasco, all were delicious I can't say one is better than the other.  This little spot is quickly winning over Hoboken and should definitely be added to your list of restaurants to try, you won't regret it!
2017-12-26,5,To find authentic Spanish cuisine for a great price in Hoboken is next to impossible.  Try the Oxtail it was amazing!!!  The staff was attentive and super friendly... it's Dominican food with a mix of fusion of other Latin American dishes.  Cozy atmosphere with a fun crowd and great music.  A rustic ambiance with wonderful deserts try the Tres Leches, washed down with an unbelievable cafe con leche.   A Must try when in HOBOKEN.  Ask for Filomena, she's the manager and made us all feel at home.  I give it 5 stars.. Hoboken needed something like this in comparison to the other way overpriced Spanish restaurants like La Isla and Cuban.    It was busy but our servers and the staff was very organized.   Seeing nothing but a Latino crowd makes you know this spot is the real deal!
2017-12-25,3,I really want to love this place. The menu sounds great and the reviews seem amazing.  I would love to order from a Cuban place that's not La Isla (this is a high standard). I ordered food for delivery. The food is just okay... the mofongo, rice, and tostones are so dry. The oxtail and shrimp dishes portion are kind of small but flavor is deep. I do recommend the oxtail and shrimp but keep in mind that the trade off with price is portion size.
2017-12-18,4,Saw this on uber eats and immediately became static since there are barely any spanish places by my work place...  i order grilled chicken, salad & tostones. The grilled chicken had a perfect sazon to it the only thing I did not like was that it was a very small piece of grilled chicken for the price that it has to it but other than it had a delicious and juicy taste to it. The tostones were amazing & those sauces oh my, they have this light green sauce idk what the hell it had inside but it made this delicious experience so much better! Thank you to whoever makes the food you guys rock!
2017-12-17,4,Glad to have stumbled on this little whole in the wall between 2 larger Cuban restaurants. Good for small groups (mostly just tables for 2) or takeout, the $9 lunch special with 2 sides can't be beat. I ordered the pernil with maduros and black beans. Taking some points off because they were out of the rice/beans combo side :(. Either way the portion was generous so I took some home and ate it the next day. Looking forward to coming back to try some other options.
2017-12-16,5,Fantastic service, really tasty food, and incredibly reasonable prices. The empanadas are also delicious, and only $2 or so each.
2017-12-11,5,Came all the way from Miami to try this food. I am a born and raised Dominican, and I can tell you this is authentic Dominican food. One of the best sancocho's I've ever had, but don't tell my grandma. Everything was great. The rice and beans, the potato salad, ox tail ,ohhhhh and the tres leche is the best I have ver had!! I recommend La Casa 100%
2017-12-10,5,I went in for a Saturday night dinner and was happy to find great food, quick, friendly service, and a bill that didn't break the bank.I ordered the shrimp with garlic sauce which was supremely garlicky, but delicious, dirty rice, and platanos. All the food came out within 10 minutes but tasted home-made and fresh.There's a small downside of the restaurant not having a wind-breaking structure outside the entrance, so gusts of cold air come in as people move in and out.Luckily, you can buy warm cookies after your meal at Insomnia Cookies.I would definitely recommend La Casa to friends and family.
2017-12-09,5,Had the pleasure of going to eat at La Casa in Hoboken., NJ. The food was amazing !  We started with the Sancocho and it was hearty and full of flavor. My wife is Dominican and she knows a good Sancocho .  We ordered the Churrasco and the potato salad and they were both delicious. In fact the churrasco was the best I have ever eaten. We also tried the Ox Tail and it was mouth watering .. we finished off with homemade tres leches .. the best I have ever had . To top it all off the prices are more than fair . Run don't walk there , you won't regret it ...
2017-12-03,5,Came here with a few friends.  The food was amazing.  Entirely authentic.  The owner is so sweet.  He gave us a lot of free appetizers and seated us so quickly.  This place is highly recommeneded !
2017-11-28,5,I've been walking past LA Casa for a while now admiring the daily progress. The place is ridiculously cute and I couldn't wait to finally get the chance to try the food. My boyfriend and I decided to go tonight for dinner. He had he churrasco with rice and beans. He loved It! He even claimed that he hadn't had a steak of that size for that value since we were in Argentina. I got the chicken ala plancha with yellow rice and Maduros. All really great flavor! With having ordered two entrees and four sides, the bill came to $26. Yes, $26. Ambiance was awesome and so was the staff. We are sadly leaving Hoboken to move to JC tomorrow but will 100% come back to visit La Casa!
2017-11-28,5,The real deal here. I grew up in Union City and know what real Cuban and South American food is. There have been many attempts to recreate the authentic food since Latin food came in Vogue. Most of these have failed terribly and are nothing like the real thing. La Casa succeeds in the atmosphere as well as the food. I have tried the pernil, the oxtail stew, the empanadas, the maduros, and the chiccarone; all of which were spot on delicious. Bravo to the chef and the friendly staff.
2017-11-14,5,La Casa!! The staff, the energy make the place special!! The food is amazing, made with love!!Tonight I had El pargo frito= fried red snapper: amazing, kept my mouth watery!! Please try it!
2017-11-13,5,Delicious new place in town.   Very reasonable prices!  Ordered delivery and came quick and hot!  Empanadas, papa rellena and  Piccadillo were awesome!  Churrasco steak was good as well!  Will be ordering again!
2017-11-12,5,Best Latin food in jersey! The only place you can compare to your favorite Spanish spots in New York, the bronx or Brooklyn! Oxtail, sopa de pollo and sancocho served EVERYDAY!  Plus the service is great!!! The spot is so cute and cozy, very romantic. Fast food, clean environment, really makes you feel at home hence the name La Casa! Highly recommend! Do waste your time going anywhere else!
2017-11-12,5,Great food,very reasonable prices, byob, and a block walk from the PATH/Terminal. This location doesn't try to overprice their food like the other Cuban restaurants in town (La Isa , The Cuban, Havana ) just because they can.
2017-11-11,5,Welcome La Casa to Hoboken!!  So happy to discover you opened here two weeks ago!!  I came for lunch today and was greeted warmly by a hostess who recommended the Pollo Guisado (chicken stew) which comes with two sides (I got Yellow rice with pigeon peas and fried plantains). I also got one order of the papa rellena (basically lightly fried ball of mashed potatoes stuffed with seasoned found beef (heaven)). There food was very flavorful, not greasy,and homemade tasting...you could taste the love! I can't wait to return on a Friday for the bacalao. Their food is Cuban, Dominican, Puerto Rican mix. The prices are better than similar local places. The music is Spanish and lovely. The vibe is warm and filled with people having a good time. The decor is beautiful with exposed brick, woods, and dotted with handmade ceramics. The location is fabulous. Will definitely be here often!!
2017-11-08,5,Pollo de Camarillo was fantastic and savory. Yuca con mojo is definitely a side to try. Overall the place warm and welcoming. Staff is friendly and a nice place to have a cocktail after hours.This place just opened about a week ago and make a stop by and have lunch or dinner. Prices are very reasonable at about $8-10 per meal with sides.
2017-11-08,5,Delicious and quick and cheap--great for a lunch break. Chicken guidaso was so flavorful. Empanadas and papa rellena in the window look good (next time).
2017-11-06,5,By far the best empanadas I've ever had. Ever. Definitely stop by and try them. Worth every penny.
2017-11-02,5,Newcomer to Newark Street, adding yet another Cuban option to downtown Hoboken. Prices look very reasonable. Small place with maybe 6 2-tops, and 4 bar seats. I had the Pollo Guisado with 2 sides ($8 lunch special) and it was really tasty! A $2 beef empanada was, dare I say, almost/just as good as my all-time favorite at La Isla. I'm definitely going to keep coming back to try different dishes.
