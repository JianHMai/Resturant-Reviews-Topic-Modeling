2021-07-02,1,I'm so confused because Ben and Jerry's is always such a good time! Today we went around 8:30 or so. We decided on a large waffle cone, that came with 3 scoops. We got milk & chocolate, half baked, and americone dream. While the flavors themselves were pretty good, the ice cream itself was mostly soupy/runny? It was also an extreme letdown that the waffle cone was stale. On top of the disappointing food, we were met with rude and short staff. We were confused because we expect (understandably) an awesome ice cream experience at Ben and Jerry's. We've always received that until tonight.
2021-04-05,5,Ben & Jerry's is a great place to take your friends for a late night treat! After having a fun night out we passed by Ben & Jerry's to satisfy our cravings! There's literally so many options and choices so everyone should be able to find something they like. You really can't go wrong with anything here. The employees are very friendly, they greet you with great energy and are overall great workers. I would recommend this place if you're looking for something sweet!
2021-03-28,3,Understanding it's a busy Saturday but the manager was really hostile because she was overwhelmed with the crowd trying to contain 6 feet. But there could be better direction in there or signage where the customer doesn't feel attacked trying to follow social distancing.
2021-01-05,5,I have a severe peanut/ nut allergy and this was the BEST customer service I received when I got ice cream a few days ago. Normally when I get ice cream I ask the server to take certain precautions to reduce cross contamination. Most of the time, I'm greeted with scoffs, eye rolls, dirty looks, or a painfully false excuse as to why they can't do it. Not here! The manager was super nice, and didn't make me feel like an inconvenience at all, which I really appreciated. I'm assuming she's a manager because she said she put all of the ice cream flavors with nuts in one side of the glass, and she trained her staff to scoop the non nut flavors first, and use separate scoops. How great is that?! If all ice cream shops followed her example, I'd be featured on TLC's my 600lb life! Thanks so much for this; I'll definitely be back!
2020-12-14,5,Anywhere open late during this pandemic is a gem in my book. Dairy free options are available. Sucks that you can't taste anything though. I mean what's the difference between them scooping out ice cream to serve vs them spooning out a sample to serve?Anyways, there's about 6 dairy free options. 3 are "ice cream" and the others are sorbet. I got the pineapple and passion fruit. OH MY GOODNESS ITS AMAZING. So refreshing and not overly sweet. I love it
2020-09-23,5,The establishment is clean. Customer service is fast and friendly. If you're in the area it's worth the pop in. You can never go wrong with ice cream.
2020-09-21,5,This place never disappoints. I just saw they added a chip/chocolate ice cream flavor. It always has new flavors but strawberry cheesecake is the best.
2020-09-16,5,Super awesome that Hoboken has one of these! I always enjoy getting a "fresh" version of the Strawberry Cheesecake. Large selections of flavors and the employees are nice here!
2020-09-16,5,The establishment is clean. The staff is friendly and welcoming. We received prompt service and like always great ice cream. Will be back.
2020-09-15,5,Their wait time is short and they are very prepared for guests. So goooooood!!!!!!!!!!!
2020-09-04,5,Can there be anything bad to say about Ben & Jerry's? Genuinely curious!Aside from having the best ice cream in town they are now introducing lost of cool Dairy Free flavors!! My lactose intolerant self loves this :)Ben & Jerry's never fails and the employees at this location are a treat, just like the ice cream they serve.
2020-09-04,4,Small little place but has a good array of ice cream choices. It smells like ice cream heaven when you walk in, which I appreciated. The server was very welcoming and even asked my child about any food allergies before serving her ice cream. This little extra thoughtfulness was very considerate. Nice outdoor seating to people watch on Washington street. All in all, I'd return.
2020-09-03,5,Can't beat a late night B&J's run. Staff was nice and helpful and the product was delicious as usual. Will be back next week!
2020-09-03,5,Great service and great ice cream! They are doing a good job with Covid-19 rules and regulations!
2020-08-30,5,It's amazing here. Everyone wore masks and the workers enforced social distancing. Love this spot!!!
2020-02-18,1,Used to come here all the time, but the last three times I've come, the employees have consistently under packed my pint to go.  Disappointing.
2020-02-12,5,We have been after school for the last 2 days! Staff super nice and friendly. It's also super clean which is an added bonus:)
2019-09-25,1,Had a bad experience here tonight which is why I'm leaving a review now after I've frequented this place nearly all my life. Living so close to this B&J's, I always went here and had a good experience. Tonight, however, I came after my workout class and was craving some vegan ice cream. No greeting at the door beside the pretty empty clientele. No special experience when getting my ice cream. Then, a light skin man with a beard who was the manager, came over when I was paying after I had trouble with my Apple Pay. When i decided to just pay with my physical card instead and took out out of my wallet and gave it to the young man ringing me up, he grabbed it from my hand and said, its all here, sticking my card in the device most modern businesses use to receive payment. "It's all here" he said rudely. Did he have to be rude/unhelpful? No. And due to this experience, I won't be returning here when there's other vegan options in proximity. Sorry B&J but you really let me down this time.
2019-08-29,5,I ordered the milk and cookies ice cream in a small cup. It was super creamy, delicious, refreshing and delightful. It's not too sweet and can be shared by two people. To be honest, you won't regret getting anything from Ben & Jerry's, everything is made to perfection. Life hack: sign up for their newsletter and enter your birthday, you'll receive one free scoop on your birthday!
2019-08-28,4,So many options! They staff is very nice and always helpful with recommendations and trying samples. It's a good place to grab a scoop and walk around the city. There's not too many space to sit inside so if you want a sit down place, this might not be it. The portions are big - one scoop can be split between two people easily!
2019-08-09,4,This store has been here forever. I never have been in here but there always seems to be a steady stream of customers. When you walk in you immediately get that typical ice cream shop smell. They have a lot of flavors and so you will probably find something you like here.  The service was also on point and they were quick to get people in and out which was good. No one likes to wait for ice cream!  The thing is that the ice cream tastes fake in here.  I am sure it is because it is a big chain and they pump this stuff out by the bucket. It is too sugary but still a guilty pleasure.  One thing I noticed is that it is kind of pricey for ice cream but it is expected.  It is a cool place with a well known name. They have been here a long time so they are obviously doing something right. 3.5 stars is a more fair score here but I gave them the benefit of the doubt.
2019-08-03,4,Love their ice cream of course. The staff were nice. They're very friendly. Just the downside was the ice cream that I bought melted so easily. So glad that I bought the cup instead of the cone.
2019-06-09,4,You can't go wrong with Ben and Jerry's. They constantly come up with new delicious flavors and the old favorites are great. Tried a cinnamon bun inspired flavor here and also a mint. Had them in sugar cones. It's expensive - 11.50 for the two - but delicious. The staff is attentive and friendly and there was enough seating. The bathroom was clean.
2019-05-20,5,Went for some ice cream with my boyfriend and the manager mike was so so kind and helpful!! Had a great experience all thanks to mike!!
2019-05-02,1,They always close before hours stated, lazy staff... Ben & Jerrys is great but this location is the WORST it's always gross, it looks like it hasn't had a wipe down in ages & the staff is awful, they always start closing about 45 min - 1 hour early with a chair in the door to block anyone from coming in & are super rude if you mention it to them. Just go to the grocery or support local, these guys don't deserve the business
2018-12-10,4,Always friendly service and delicious treats found here ! Like the two new non  dairy options !
2018-09-25,4,Located right near where we were eating dinner, Ben & Jerry's is always a must stop for some dessert. Bright interior and not much of a line on a Saturday night, despite it being relatively warm outside.Menu consists of all the favorites including new flavors as well. Ladies behind the counter let you try as many as you'd like while deciding (I tried three). For best value, did the handpacked pint ($6.54) - any flavor or flavors scooped into a to-go pint cup. Settled on a mix of the "Chip off the Dough Block" and the Chocolate Peanut Butter Swirl. Good rich flavors as usual, a little heavy on the chocolate (should have balanced it out with something else), but overall worth the price.Again, the people behind the counter were friendly and patient - an importance for the time of day. Glad this was available in the area.
2018-09-18,5,Ben and Jerry's never fails when it comes to ice cream.  They have almost every flavor you can imagine and will even ask you if you have allergies, which a lot of places don't do.  But it's high quality ice cream, so of course a waffle cone is going to be extremely expensive.  Plus the seating at this Ben and Jerry's is super limited.  But it's Ben and Jerry's, which is extremely hard to beat.
2018-08-08,5,My friends and I came here tonight after dinner and it did not disappoint! Amy was so kind and helpful and also gave us a lot of free samples. The ice cream was great and she was so easy to talk to and really made our experience an enjoyable one. Would recommend to anyone in the Hoboken area!
2018-07-02,5,You can have two different scoops in the smallest cup. My favourite is the coconut with butter pecan.
2018-06-26,4,I really like Ben & Jerry's. The ice cream is good and the flavors are really unique. Same with the froyo. However, service can sometimes be slow and the employees aren't always great when dealing with a busy summer afternoon. My order always comes out correct and tastes fresh- which is a good thing! :)
2018-06-16,4,Wow they have Almond Milk  Ice Cream !!  Great for all of us with dairy issues. Nice people working here Would have given them 5-Stars but they have free WiFi which requires a password. But nobody knows the password.
2018-06-16,4,Can never say no to ice cream... Came here and ordered Banana Sundae... so delicious! Three scoops w three different flavors and two toppings! I had sprinkles and m&m.
2018-04-28,1,Very disappointed in the service tonight. The 3 employees behind the counter seemed in no hurry to take our order when the store was basically empty. But even more disappointing is the size of the "small" serving of Cherry Garcia with sprinkles. It was a half of a scoop and to top it off, the server threw it in the bag upside down.  We felt like they were doing us a favor. We would have been better off buying pints at a grocery store.  Don't bother with this place unless you want to feel like you've been taken for granted.
2018-04-11,5,I love this location! Nico is such a character and will make your ice cream experience the best one! So many laughs. The only thing that I am upset at is that yesterday is free cone day and I missed it :(
2018-03-28,5,I have been taking this place for granted for far too long! I always have a great time, and I love this location because the staff are consistently attentive and fun!!! It may be a "chain store", but honestly, this store has always had that friendly, only in Hoboken feel. They treat their customers like family. Just tonight, I went in with my teenage son for some ice cream. It's still chilly out so my son held our dog outside while I went in to get the ice cream. The manager, Amy, was so fun. We had a chit chat and she noticed my son outside and encouraged me to step out and give him his cone before I paid. I was also unusually indecisive about my flavor and after giving me a taste of the bourbon vanilla I inquired about--she suggested I add a scoop of coffee so I experienced the WOW factor that all Ben & Jerry's fanatics seek. Bourbon vanilla and coffee ice creams in a cup. Thanks, awesome Amy!
2018-02-10,1,Service is below any standard. My 5 years old didn't like the ice cream because the ice cream tasted bad. In every normal place the ice cream would be replaced, but not at this B&J. Such a shame for the brand! We won't return.
2018-01-02,1,Absolutely worst Ice cream shop I have ever been to. I was so traumatized by this shop that I created a Yelp account!! First of all the short lady with glasses and a little big but with nice eyes, served me was being Very disrespectful because I was with my Husband as we are a gay couple and kept ignoring us until I kept asking for help and she turned around rolling her eyes saying " Just pick a cup or cone I'm not doing anything more, If you want a milkshake or something go across the street." So we ended up leaving but before we left we caught a Huge BUG on their ice cream I was mortified and was glad to leave. We ended up going to Cold Stone which is cheaper and homemade. Will never return to this homophobic ice cream shop crawled with bugs. Never in my 41 years of life have I experienced such a thing. I was planning on treating my office to this ice cream shop but I have decided to go to elsewhere. Lost hundreds.
2017-11-25,2,I love Ben & Jerry's ice cream...2 stars because the girl working was not friendly & the bathroom was dirty. Ice cream was good...not much else to say about it.
2017-11-01,4,This is one of my favorite ice cream place ever !!! ive been going there ever since i found out there sell dairy free ice cream!!
2017-07-02,3,They have all the ice cream's. But not so many options for desserts and Sundays which is a bummer
2017-04-23,5,Wonderful location. I'm constantly amazed at their involvement in the community as well. You'll see them at local community events all the time handing out free ice cream! There are many ice cream places to visit that'll give you exactly what you expect...ice cream. However, this place will also give back to the community they're placed in. Yes, the ice cream is great, the owner is awesome and the staff is friendly. Above that, they believe in bettering the community they're in. I truly think that if this Ben & Jerry's location were to close, the community would feel it. Aaaaand, the Tonight Dough is amazing. 'Nuff said.
2016-10-16,4,Ummm how can you go wrong with ice cream?? I'm a little bias because I'm from New England! We came and got dessert here on my birthday and the shop was really crowded. The line didn't take too long though, and the place was clean. Signs were clear and easy to read the prices of everything (which I love because who likes being blindsided when they get to the register?!). I got the "tonight dough" flavor and fell in love. Yum!!
2016-07-19,5,Just great ice cream, friendly service, and very convenient location. Always great to stop by and get a big waffle cone with 3 scoops!
2016-07-01,4,Let me start off by saying working at Ben and Jerrys looks like a honestly stressful job. There are constant people in and out and "can I taste this? I don't like it how about that.." I know I would need a lot of patience and support from my coworkers to get through the day.That being said the girls behind the counter all are awesome. Tonight's situation was different. All the workers were moving around getting the place together and helping the flow of customers, then a girl comes out with a backpack on saying "clean this place up girls it's a mess!" Working in the service industry I knew right away it was the manager if that's what you call her. The girl who took my order (who was super nice while I told her 4 different, annoying things) was in training. We've all done it, training sucks but you have to power through it, and I have no problem waiting an extra 5 minutes for her to learn. The whole time this poor girl was making my order the "manager" was telling her everything she was doing wrong yelling at her in front of the other customers and other girls working. I was outraged. All the girls back there seemed uncomfortable while she was around waiting for the next thing they did "wrong." For you to yell at your team and belittle them while your leaving and walking in the back to look around for more to yell about is ridiculous and uncalled for. Does it hurt that bad to be nice? Especially in front of customers??? Awesome ice cream , awesome work staff , horrible manager.
2016-06-15,3,Your typical Ben & Jerry's, but with last year's mainstream pop blasting just louder than what's comfortable.  Seating is pretty limited; friendly staff.
2016-06-01,3,Super small place that can get super packed during the summer. The line moves rather quickly and the place is clean. They let you try out different flavors which I love but 3 stars because they didn't have my favorite which is the Americone dream when I went. So sad:(. Besides that though, aside from the basic flavors, they do have other options outside of the ice cream. I believe you're able to order sundaes and shakes which is a plus. Personally, if you're not on a nice stroll in Hoboken, I suggest you buy a pint and Netflix and chill at home. ;)
2016-05-22,1,Have been going to the store and ordering from delivery.com for years. Specific to the delivery, it takes about an hour to two hours. We were willing to deal with that because we like the ice cream. However the last three deliveries (each $30 a piece) were horrendous. Wrong ice cream each time. Melted through bag. We paid for sides of caramel and the cups were practically empty. Either they are too busy to do deliveries amor they just don't care. Either way do not order from this place.....ruins your ice cream experience.
2016-05-14,1,Nothing wrong with Ben & Jerrys. Love their stuff. However,  had an incredibly bad experience with the delivery. The delivery person was very rude, she could not understand my instructions when I told her how to find my apartment, and was huffy when she finally found me. To make things worse, she blamed her inability to understand my instructions on my accent, which was just insulting. I order delivery all the time - never had such a bad experience with any other delivery person. And this is not first time I have been borderline insulted by this delivery person.Sorry Ben & Jerry's. I love you guys. Nothing against you. But can you guys please make sure this particular delivery person never shows up at my place again? Thanks.
2016-01-11,3,took over an hour for 4 small ice cream cups, but it arrived frozen cold and not melted at all, so props for that!
2015-11-22,4,Great spot to grab dessert on Washington Street. This Ben and Jerry's has way more flavor options than the Rockefeller Center location in Manhattan. My personal favorite is the Tonight Dough, though almost every flavor I've tried is great. They give very generous scoops and there's plenty of seating inside. Love this spot!
2015-08-16,5,This place is HEAVEN on earth! I just can't stop going there. I've eaten so much of strawberry cheesecake! It's my favorite ice cream now. Anything else other that doesn't taste like an ice cream anymore. LOve every bit of it!
2015-07-15,1,I stopped in for a shake on a very hot and humid day. The large shake is over 6 dollars! Closer to 7. I received only 3 scoops of ice cream and the rest was milk. No syrup! Needless to say the shake was more like chocolate milk instead of a shake. It was sour too which leads me to believe the milk was dated. I asked for a large spoon since it was a large "shake" but all they had were small cheap plastic spoons which look like the generic ones you get at the dollar store. No large straws either! It was a large drink which requires a larger straw to clear the dome cover. Wtf!Definitely will not return.
2015-06-30,5,Always have great customer service and great ice cream! It's a fun environment and I love how active they are in the community!
2015-06-14,2,I've always loved Ben and Jerry's ice cream. It's great ice cream. So what I'm about to say is not about the product, but the service. Product 4 stars, service.... If I could would get 0. I live around the corner.. And I understand everyone and business has their days, we are only human. But I'm writing this after multiple trips there. First off it's chaos and it looks like no one their has the faintest idea of what their job description is or what they are supposed to be doing. I was first in line to get my order taken... No one else was really there (there were at best 2-3 other customers in the building... One being attended to at the register quickly then again I was the only one waiting). I watched as 3 employees basically walked by me countless times, even acknowledging me with eye contact them walking away to wipe a counter down that was already clean... Stock a full area.. It was obvious that they were doing pretend busy work to avoid actually taking my order. I stood there for 15 min while they did all sorts of things that could easily be done after taking a guests order (mine). In fact... The one serving the ice cream actually looked at me... Left his station.. Went to the back and then came over to where I was and asked me to move to clean the counter in front of me. Again.. It felt like I walked into someone's person living room unannounced and was not welcome. Now as unprofessional as it is.. Id promised my 7 year old son ice cream so as bad as I wanted to walk out I stayed. Finally my order was taken and it took 2 min to make the 2 milkshakes 3 employees has desperately avoided to make for 15 minutes. I thought I was home free. No. In the middle of trying to pay for these milkshakes... The counter girl stopped halfway through the transaction and helped another customer (who was also complaining) so I had to wait for my change while she unprofessionally walked off and left me hanging there waiting for change. I love Ben and Jerrys product... But i will not be coming back to this location. I have 2 children and live 3 blocks away.. That's a lot of money in the long run..How hard is it to have people that have manners and work ethic work for you in a situation that would gain the very regular business that keeps a company open and thriving. I wouldn't go there unless you have an HOUR to spend to get a milkshake and have no self respect..so teenagers coming into adulthood acting like you are an inconvenience and an idiot doesn't bother you. Thank you Ben and Jerrys.. I had no idea asking you if I could buy a couple of milkshakes was such a drag for you guys. After all.. It IS your business.. So sorry I misunderstood.
2015-05-26,3,Ben & Jerry's is the place to be on a hot Saturday night! The line was practically to the door when we got there around 8pm. They make their waffle cones fresh, so the entire store smelled like a heavenly mixture of ice cream and fresh waffles.Unfortunately, my ice cream this visit was tainted with lemonade sorbet, which I guess was from not properly rinsing the scoopers? We were in a rush, so I didn't go back to have it replaced. Yeah, lemonade does not mix well with butter pecan or chocolate toffee crunch...
2015-05-12,3,3 stars for the ice cream which is always delicious. Unfortunately, the floor, tables and chairs were filthy. Definitely not a pleasing way to spend an afternoon inside.
2014-11-23,3,Banana split Strawberry chocolate mango A little bit too sweet but okChocolate sauce is not that goodCream is good
2014-10-04,5,Can never go wrong with Ben & Jerrys especially on such a gloomy day. ice cream amazing as usual and the staff is so welcoming and humble. It's always nice to talk a little with others. :)
2014-09-02,5,Ben & Jerrys Ice cream, delicious! what more needs to be said? they have cones and cups, I got a large cup, which I barely finished, but I finished it because im a fattie who loves ice cream.
2014-08-09,5,Service is great here. The servers are always super sweet. We usually go for the seven layer cake ice cream on a cone because it's our favorite. There's a clean restroom and both indoor and outdoor seating areas. What more can you ask for?
2014-07-10,3,I expected a little better from the normally amazing Ben & Jerry's. The place was full of non-commital patrons who needed to taste every flavor, and while this is outside their control, the staff did nothing to move the line along. In addition, the highly advertised frozen yogurts were all gone, without any signage. The flavor I did get was pretty good, but even a small was a bit too much of a good thing and very rich. For the price premium, I was looking for a better experience. One more reason Hoboken needs a gelato store.
2014-04-03,5,This place is very inviting. Stopped by on a Thursday afternoon and it was very nice out. The one girl there greeted me and was very helpful with cone sizes. I had a sweet cookies and cream in a wafer come. It was delicious. The amount of Oreos in it is amazing. $3.25 good price. April 8 free cone day she said !!
2014-03-19,3,It's hard to give a solid review to Ben & Jerry's as I find it both slightly overpriced and really delicious. I think I overstated the fact that sushi delivery is the proof of a God. I forgot about the Ben and Jerry's delivery. To be honest, if sushi proves there is a God, then the ice cream delivery proves that He created humans as intelligent creatures. I've stopped here after a stressful day at work one time and acquired some Phish Food. This pleased me greatly. I must say that the whole idea of ice cream after a tough day making a person happy does indeed have merit. I've had a rough few days in my personal life. Naturally, what do I do to make myself feel better? Ice Cream it is. I proceed to rock out with Seamless and have it brought to me in 45 minutes. How it takes that amount of time to scoop ice cream into a cup with toppings and get it from 4th and Washington to my apartment a few blocks away remains a mystery of the universe.
2014-03-02,2,I'd like to write a review about the ice cream, except the delivery I ordered over  1 1/4 hrs ago (was supposed to arrive in 30 min) still has not arrived. The one star is for the nice person on the phone at B & J, although she seemed powerless to track an order sent with the delivery person over 25 minutes prior.
2013-05-29,4,There is Ben & Jerry's ice cream here. It's delicious, and mostly bad for you. You will eat it anyway.There's a good selection of flavors here, and you can get shakes, sundaes, mash-ups (mixing in flavors and add-ins, sort of like a Blizzard but with actual flavored ice creams) and the staff here is generally pretty friendly and efficient. They take LevelUp.The lack of a 5th star is for the price, which is pretty high. Yes, Hoboken retail is really expensive for some reason, but still. Plan on dropping some real cash here. The good news is after a few bites you won't even remember that part!
2013-03-08,2,Decided to try this spot after dinner on a Friday night.  I have to say I'm not a fan of the ice cream, it has a very 'chalk-y' taste.  I got the strawberry cheesecake and Graham Cracker with Coconut.  They were also out of regular waffle cones and only had the ones dipped in chocolate.  There are other ice cream companies that just taste a lot better and more fresh.  Ice cream was not worth the price and didn't taste good at all.
2012-09-27,4,I had a kids cup of ice-cream and I'll tell you why. My first selection included bananas, but they had none in the store. Had to make a second selection. I opted for a soft ice-cream and alas, there were no more cones. Odd. I lost my enthusiasm after not being able to get what I want. I mean this is ice cream and it is about indulging in foodie pleasure. You can't deny a person twice and not expect to keep the happiness going. So I went for a kids cup, just to join the family in ice cream fun.
2012-06-01,2,i threw out my cookie cookie shake :(the lack of freshness, the fake oreos, and the overload of flavors that don't mesh made this shake undrinkable.  and i am a chunky little ice cream lover...not finishing a shake is a travesty for me.IMO, the quality and price of B&J's ice cream is better in the supermarket.  and with coldstone across the street, i see absolutely no reason to come back.
2012-05-21,4,Great spot for ice cream and frozen yogurt.  Tons of great flavors (Cherry Garcia, oh yeah), but wider selection for traditional ice cream as compared to frozen yogurt.  This place is immaculate and the staff is very friendly.  Prices are on par with other ice cream spots in the area, but you definitely get the best product for your money at Ben & Jerry's.  This will be my go-to ice cream spot from now on!
2012-05-10,4,Seriously, what's not to like about this place? The fact that you can get "experimental" flavors before they're released en masse is seriously cool. Shweddy Balls (from SNL and Alec Baldwin fame) has quickly become my new favorite flavor, and I hope it sticks around for a while. Something else I love about the place is the staff. They're bubbly and friendly, and let you taste test whatever flavors you want before you buy!! How cool?! Well worth a stop in, I suggest getting the "kid" size portion. It's more than enough and fairly priced. (the waffle cones are out of this world as well)
2012-04-20,4,The plastic cow outside is really nasty looking (so much ice cream must have been spilt on him) so I wouldn't recommend sitting on him.  But other than that, you can't go wrong with Ben and Jerry's!  They have kids size, small, medium, and large, as well as shakes.  Averaging around $4-$6 per item here, so if you want a somewhat cheap treat, stop by!Try the Stephen Colbert Americone Dream - it has bits of waffle cone it in.  Also, you can't go wrong with the Phish Food - it has Phish chocolate fish and fudge and marshmallow goo.  Yummm.
2011-12-20,4,Holy Ice Cream Shakes Batman!  I've found my reason to keep coming back!I don't think you can get these shakes anywhere else.  Big recommendation to the Chocolate mint!   SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Good.
2011-08-20,4,I love this place. My favorite flavor's Mint Chocolate Chip, and their "Mint Chocolate Chunk" is great! The chips are a little hard, so it could be a little better. This place just kinda has a good vibe. The staff are kind, and the place feels sorta bright and happy. The ice cream is great. Like I said... I love this place!
2011-08-18,4,Boys are terrible for my waistline.Following a terrible phone call with the ex "love of my life"...I pretty much ran to Ben and Jerry's on my way home a few weeks ago.Sometimes it feels good to drown sucky feelings out with fat, sugar and cookie dough. I asked for their smallest size and was still presented with something that probably contained my calories for the week. OH WELL. The staff is friendly, quick and seemed to understand my need for dairy products to divert my impending tears.This place is right by Crumbs, so if you're in one of those out and out, dire we-just-broke-up-and-my-heart-is-shattered mode...venture over to Washington between 4th and 5th. You can top it off with some Grimaldis as well :)
2011-05-19,4,Ice cream is one of my favorite desserts, and Ben and Jerry's does not fail. I love the neighborhood feel it gives off (even though its a chain), there's always someone happy in there, either on line or serving you. So many flavors and cones to choose from, how can they go wrong?The only reason I'm giving 4 stars and not 5 is because it is a chain, and I tend to not give credit to chains as I would to a mom and pop shop.
2011-04-03,3,I can really only review delivery as that's all I've gotten from Ben and Jerry's. The shakes are delicious and I love that they deliver. Expensive obviously, and you specifically have to ask for straws if you order milkshakes, which I find odd. Nothing super special, but if you're lazy and want ice cream this'll do the trick.
2011-01-20,3,B & J's is decent ice cream for a chain. However,I find it hard to pay the same price for a cup of ice cream as I could for a pint. The staff is friendly and helpful and the product is decent, but the price is no fun. When given the choice of chains, I'd rather check out the Cold Stone down the street and make up my own ice creamy delight.
2010-09-06,2,The ice cream and frozen yogurt were both delicious. However, the atmosphere was nothing special. Loud dance music was blaring like you were in the club, and the tables were all sticky and dirty. Could be better.
2009-07-10,3,This ice cream place is OK. It has the unfortunate distinction of being situated a block away from Coldstone, which is alot better IMO. However, B & J has a couple of things going for it: 1) line is usually shorter, 2) it's a little cheaper, 3) the ice cream + hot chocolate drink mix is really good. Basically it's just a cup of hot chocolate with a couple of scoops of your favorite ice cream inside. Sounds basic but it really is very good. Also, once in awhile they have free ice cream day, where you can get 1 scoop of anything for free!
2009-05-25,3,Expensive ice cream but great selection of flavors. First gaff was that the girl that was waiting on us skipped to some other customers mid order. It was sorta rude.The ice cream isn't kept cold enough though and was melting into puddles before we got outside. We also ordered an iced coffee and the girl didn't know what to do. It wound up being an iced milk with a bit of coffee. $15 for two ice creams and a cup of iced coffee (with tip). Ouch.
2008-10-10,4,OH!!! So silly and stupid me!  I'm really sorry I misunderstood Ben & Jerry and Cold stone!! I'm seriously apologize!!My professor is addicted to Ben & Jerry, he is gonna get mad.if he knows my wrong criticizing.I will try Ben & Jerry next time!I am so sorry.
2007-04-26,5,I had no idea this place even existed in Hoboken. My friend and I were driving on Washington Street when I saw this little "scoop" of heaven (see what i did there? Scoop, you know, for ice cream?)I made her stop so I could go in. My main objective: finding a pint of Stephen Colbert's Americone Dream ice cream. Now, I had been looking for this damn thing for nearly a week now, with absolutely no luck. Target i've been to, they didnt have it. Pathmark? nope not there. Shop Rite? of course not there. Walgreen's? Are you even kidding?So i go in, and the young dude behind the counter asks me if i needed any help. So i say, "yes, do you have the new Americone Dream ice cream?" He looks at me and gives me a smile and says, "Sir, how many do you want?" When i heard that, I thought I had won the lottery. But get this, he says "I'll be right back" and he heads to the back of the store to get a pint. Apparently its locked up, as if it were gold in Fort Knox. He comes back, and he lets me look at it. And i cant stop grinning from ear to ear, because I (and this one goes out to Julia) now have Stephen Colbert in the palm of my hands.Oh yeah, the other flavors in here are good too. so there ya go.
