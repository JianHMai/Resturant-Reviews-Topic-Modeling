2021-10-30,1,Don't come here unless ur a girl who wants to get verbally assaulted by a fat insecure douche bag that stands in front of the girls bathroom. Weird and fat.
2021-09-07,1,This place is rude, terrible customer service and not LGBTQ+ friendly. My friend who is a girl and has short hair was dragged out because she was dancing up on the ledge and because she "looked like a boy" and boys were not allowed to do that?? She was treated very poorly by staff following the event as well when we spoke to them outside after. I will never go back to this establishment.
2021-06-25,1,The bouncers here will assault patrons if you stay here too long. The staff also harasses women. Will not be in business much longer despite the hype.
2021-05-22,5,Just a fantastic place and the owner who played baseball is really good looking ! Like really really good looking and so charismatic. Most people go just to see him, it's outstanding. Thank God he exists.
2021-05-08,1,Me and and my friends spent 3000 here, got kicked out by a short little man lacking self confidence who thought he was someone. Don't come here. Also after spending 300 myself completely sober. Don't come here.
2021-04-17,1,0 stars! These bouncers were so rude you would think someone shit in their cereal this morning!  0/10 would not recommend! Someone needs to teach these men manners :/
2021-03-20,2,This place is straight up sexist!!! It lets women on the chairs dancing but god forbid a guy does the same exact thing. Screw this place!
2021-03-17,5,10/10 Sunday funday -- we lovvved it & the apps were  the staff and Greenrock crew are great and the table was perf. Thanks!
2020-11-16,1,What happened with Grace happened to my group, too. Green Rock processed an extra $200 on top of our bill after their Sunday football tailgate, meanwhile we were already charged for the "cover" in our day-of bill. Additionally, day-of we were charged a credit card fee. We've never seen this at a bar before, nor was it clearly stated upfront, on the menu or website. Seems extremely scammy to me. I don't recommend giving this bar your credit card info. Show up day-of and pay in cash.We have receipts and are disputing it with the credit card. Emails have gone unanswered.
2020-11-07,1,They will steal your money. I went there last weekend with my friends, I made a reservation on Seven Rooms, their online reservation system. It was listed in the email of the reservation confirmation that there would be a $10 booking fee per person charged to our bill on the day of. It ended up being $25 per person. Also, when we tried to leave, the waiter told us that we "had not reached our minimum." It turns out that there was a $75 spending minimum per person, which I was not told about and was not listed on their website or in the email I received for the reservation. Lastly, in addition to the $600 bill, I was charged an extra $400 (two additional separate charges of $200). To dispute the extra $400 in charges, I called the restaurant every single day for a week, multiple times a day at varying times, and no one ever answered. They do not have a voicemail set up, and they do not have an email or any other way to contact them listed on their website. So, I had to file a fraud claim with my bank and now have to get a new debit card. I am not sure if the bank will even give me back my money. All in all, avoid this place at all costs. They will steal you money. It is not worth it. I have never written a Yelp review but I was so shocked that I had this experience at such a popular restaurant that I felt I had to warn others about my horrific experience.
2020-09-10,3,Do not, I repeat ~~do NOT~~ come here on a Sunday expecting to go to work on Monday. It is a trap. I have friends who love this bar, hate this bar, and love to hate it (me). The people who love this bar spend September-May here and MDW-LDW at Djais. If you're looking to have a few casual drinks Monday-Wednesday is your sweet spot here, all other days will end in terror. Staff is nice expect for one creepy manager that tries to kiss girls on the mouth and the bouncers out front who scream a lot. Food is actually good and bartenders are quick. Napkins and calling. Bye.
2020-03-06,1,I have been coming to green rock for 3 years now. Last night I was able to meet the owner while my friend was visiting me. We talked for a while and then the owner proceeded to order 3 drinks for us all. It was really cool other than the fact that he decided to put the three drinks he ordered on my tab.  The audacity of some people.
2020-01-29,2,Please serve what you advertise. My husband and I have ordered from here twice before and enjoyed their food tremendously. I was so excited to have found Green Rock Tap & Grill because they serve black bean burgers (specifically the Gardein chipotle black bean patties). This time around, however, I was given a disgusting Dr. Praeger's vegetable burger. If I order a black bean burger off of your menu, I expect to receive a black bean burger--not a soggy vegetable patty with no black beans to be found.
2020-01-26,1,My Friends and I were looking for a nice place to go while visiting hoboken so we decided to go to this place and when we were outside the guard guys Asking for ID's were with their girl Friends and the friends took our ids intead.  And then the guards began  to play with our ids with their friends trying to take them from them. So after that we decided not to enter, so if thats the way they behave outside of the place I dont want to imagine how it is inside. So unprofessional ..... maybe yes you will keep the known customers but you wont attract new ones
2019-12-17,5,Great happy hour beer and dip specials.   Food is good too.  Can get crowded with underage idiots at night.
2019-11-30,4,Great Hoboken bar - plenty of tvs (and they are a West Virginia bar ??!?!!!) and good beers on tap and 50 Cent wing specials (go for the honey mustard).  Plus good service (the opposite of Tx Az).
2019-11-24,4,Came here on a Saturday afternoon for my friend's turkey hunt and this bar was really fun! Very upbeat and dancy music for an afternoon too. There were still some sports games being played in the background but it was not a quiet sports bar at all. I tried the buffalo chicken empanadas and they were so good. I heard they have deals on Tuesday too, so I am definitely going to go back for another empanada. The vibe inside is very casual and laid back. Also, there are hooks in the bar to hang your coat! It's not that big of a bar though (pretty small space). I got an allagash white (so hard to find on tap at most bars) and they have white claws too. The drink selection is good and the empanadas made my day. Can't wait to come back here again for a great time!
2019-11-05,1,Was charged 88$ on a bill that was 44$. When I saw the charge on my card I looked for my receipt to verify - Bartender (HAYLEY) must have helped herself to a 100% tip. No surprise that people have had similar issues according to their Facebook page. Have been trying to call number listed and it's disconnected. Tried emailing and no reply. Not only am I extremely angry and annoyed that you have low life bartenders stealing from customers and taking shots all night behind the bar, but I will now ACTIVELY deter people from going here so that they aren't in a similar situation. Very unprofessional that managers / owners are unaware of what their employees are doing.
2019-10-21,3,I've definitely had a lot of fun here but this place is literally a black hole. Fun when you're trying to get super drunk with friends in the winter or fall but i don't recommend for the summer when you're trying to enjoy the sun!
2019-08-20,4,Clean welcoming environment with an eclectic historical front entrance. On tuesdays they feature $3 drafts and empanadas ALL DAY with trivia starting at 8PM by TriviaAD! (Kelly & David were fantastic for FRIENDS night!)Jeff behind the bar is a delight and the food is scrumptulescent! The empanadas are light, flakey and flavorful and are served with sauce pairing. My personal favorite is the Cheesesteak! Lastly the fries  are hand cut, crisped to perfection and served with an INCREDIBLE BUFFALO aioli!Highly recommend!!
2019-04-10,5,Awesome burger! I had the buffalo aoili burger with blue cheese crumble. The burger was just enough, plus good happy hour specials until 7.So far I have had 2 burgers from here and both are delicious.
2019-02-28,5,Came here for trivia night the other night. Everything seemed so smooth for it being their first time hosting! Drinks and food were amazing at great prices and the service is AMAZING. Definitely recommend for some excitement on a Tuesday night!
2019-02-26,2,I've been to this place so many times for food, drinks, and happy hour prior to their renovation and everything was okay. It's always been kind of a frat like, Djais ish bar on the weekend nights but they had good food and a great happy hour during the week. We came tonight to do trivia (which is new at this bar,l, I think) but we didn't have a reservation (oops). When we got there an hour before trivia started we were told (by the hostess) we couldn't participate because the whole back area was sold out. Turned out the trivia company  had a microphone and nearly everyone in the bar participated so hopefully this was just a miscommunication since it's a new event here? Anyway, the girl that was the hostess was also our server which is fine except our service was absolute CRAP. My tap wine (Pinot noir) was served in a stinky, dirty glass so  I let her know and she fixed it.  We ordered a burger, wings and a cheesesteak empanada. The wings came out first and they were buffalo but we ordered sweet soy so they had to fix them. Then I took a bite of the empanada and it was buffalo. When I said something to the hostess/waitress she said "are you sure?" Yes, I definitely know the difference between cheesesteak and buffalo chicken. The burger was okay but small and didn't come with fries (they used to have delicious fries with the burgers before they changed the menu). We stayed for trivia and had a few drinks as the night went on. She asked if we wanted more drinks and my sister and husband said no thanks but received more drinks because the "ticket printed accidentally but I won't charge you" (we were charged for one of them didn't fight it because one free drink is cool, and appreciated). The worst part of the whole night was when we got our check and there was already gratuity added for a party of 4. YOU CANT DO THAT, GREEN ROCK. I asked the hostess/server and she said "our system automatically does that for parties more than 4, I mean, for 4". No, sis, it doesn't.  I asked her to fix it and she did (thank you). I don't appreciate that sneakiness especially when the service was crap. I'm a generous topper but not in a situation like this. The ONLY reason I'm not giving one start is because we've been here before and haven't had 'that' bad of an experience but tonight was something else.
2019-02-07,1,This establishment for delivery is not rescinded whatsoever. I ordered delivery of a kale and beet salad plus chicken wings (what can I say? it's complicated.) I'm notified that at 8pm my order has gone through and that my food delivery will arrive by 845pm. 845pm comes and goes, I get an update my food is late and will arrive 9:30pm, then 9:50pm, then I hey an update that my food order was canceled. The driver who called to say that the restaurant is closed and he's no longer doing delivery. so as a disabled person who was waiting for food for about two entire hours, there's no customer service or apology. already I was going to pay step prices for mediocre bar food so I suppose I lucked out. Shouts out to Grub Hub for mediating this nightmare and getting me a full refund and then some.
2019-02-03,1,This place is unreal....I'm young, I enjoy drinking here...we all do, I watched the bartender check their phone 6 times before I got my check, I'm not from the area and I had an Uber which was waiting 5 minutes now ( it's not easy getting an Uber at this time) and he proceeded to call security on me..mind you I know I am completely coherent..I spend time here, I buy food..I buy drinks...but get it together. Absolutely ridiculous..this is why Bartenders here don't get tipped. Customer service above all & if you're someone who has served for a while you know between wasted and someone whose old enough to have a few drinks & tell when there is an issue.
2019-01-17,5,This is my favorite spot in Hoboken! They completely turned it over after the renovation. Their draft beer selection has a great variety and are different than most bars in Hoboken. The new menu has a lot of new items mixed in with some classic from the old menu! Great happy hour spot, and of course always a fun spot on weekends!
2019-01-01,2,Nice location near Path train but stay away if you want to be with friendly people. The barkeepers are friendly but avoid any contact to the bouncers.Ordered a drink and just minutes later a bouncer dictated to finish. When I asked for ten more seconds to finish he took the glas poured it and kicked us out...Totally unnecessary since the bar was still crowded with drunk people...
2018-11-23,4,My friends and I like to come to Green Rock for Sunday Football at least one to two times each season so we can throw napkins and dance.    We've been to Green Rock twice this season since they renovated and reopened in 2018.  The renovation has made the bar a bit wider and brighter, and they updated their menu.  I preferred their previous menu more (more wrap options and wraps/burgers came with fries, less expensive) but they do have a good wing special during football and their chicken tenders are good.  You can also reserve a table for football by texting with one of the managers who works there as long as you show up by noon to claim your table.  We had no issue reserving our table the first weekend, but this past Sunday when we came for our friend's birthday, they did not reserve the high top table I specifically requested weeks in advance.  Luckily enough we were there at noon and could claim a different tab. The manager also apologized and not only gave us a free pitcher but also took $100 off our final tab.  This was very generous of them.We will definitely continue to come back for NFL football here and there - it does get loud, crowded, and rowdy so if that's not your football scene, then stay away.  Otherwise, it's a really fun time.
2018-11-11,1,Came here on a Saturday night- WAY too crowded and the floor was covered in alcohol and napkins. The women's bathroom is too small and the sink was clogged so there was no way to wash your hands. I was delighted to leave.
2018-10-02,1,WORSE BAR! This bar has reopened due to violations. I have recently been back and it's is even worse than before. I am pretty sure they serve water in their vodka sodas. The bartenders on Thursday's are rude and inattentive. If the drinks suck and the bartenders suck why even go?
2018-05-04,4,Green Rock has been on my list of places to check out in Hoboken ever since my BF told me that they had BOGO burgers on Wednesdays nights (starting at 8pm). We showed up at around 8:30 and the place was pretty empty, despite the burger special and the live music that was going on.I had the California Burger (mayo, avocado, bacon, american cheese). I ordered it medium-rare, and that's exactly how it came out. That's usually hit or miss at a lot of burger places but Green Rock got it right. I subtracted a star because the only option for buns was an English muffin (which I'm not a huge fan of), and the fries were meh. Still, BOGO is a great deal and I'll definitely be back on another Wednesdays. They have great specials on other days, which I'll be sure to check out as well.
2018-04-22,5,Amazing delicious burgers! My favorite is the breakfast burger medium. Fresh and delicious sides. Haven't had any of their sandwiches or other entrees because I love the burgers.Staff is so nice and cool.
2018-01-05,1,If you want a good time don't come here. If holding a door for a group of woman and being a gentleman is your thing this place isn't it. I got yelled at and touched to move forward  by the bouncer for holding the door. Absolutely heinous someone would put their hands on you. 0/0   don't spend a dollar here.
2017-11-29,1,FRAUD!!!!!!!RIP OFF! So, I went to Green Rock a few Sunday's ago, I had 5 beers between me and two of my girlfriends and was charged $88! I have a very hard time believing that their beers are $17 a piece, especially Bud Light! When we left we were in a hurry, so I quickly signed the tab and hopped in my Uber. On my ride home I processed the amount of the check and realized I had to have been mischarged. So I attempted to call Green Rock. No answer. I emailed Green Rock and questioned the pricing, got a reply to call and ask for Katie who works every day 11-3. I've been calling every day since and Katie doesn't answer the phone. I e-mailed back the only person who was somewhat responsive and was told that she's the only one who can help. Initially I was curious, now I'm getting increasingly frustrated. To overcharge, to be aware of the overcharge and become unresponsive to the customers is a poor way to run a business. Will never return.

2017-11-22,1,This has been one of favorite place until today , every person who have been here told me about the racism which happens here. The bouncer who are black are the most racist people. Me and my friends were there and someone said that you dropped my beer and the bouncer without listening to  anyone asked  me to go out . My advice to everyone is that even though this is one of the decent bar not to go just to avoid racism. Owner of Green rock please get some neutrality and stop racism. The slim tall black bouncer is full of shit and this has been happening since long time with others and it happened with me this time.
2017-10-21,5,This place is great for drinks and bar food. Our waitress's name was Leanne and she was super sweet. She knew everything on the menu and just what to recommend. Definitely would come back for her!
2017-10-21,5,Great buffalo chicken dip. Even greater service from Leanne. Best table service, great at the bar. Also super cute. Head on over.
2017-09-17,2,On weekends...this is where you come to rage. Friday night, Saturday night...even Sundays for football, music is loud, clothing is tight, and it is CROWDED. Do not come here for a nice pleasant conversation or to keep it low key. They claim to have a dress code as they made one of the guys leave for having a sleeveless shirt, but I walked in and saw plenty of people without sleeves. It's not the nicest place, it's not the classiest place, but if you want to really turn up, this might do the trick.
2017-09-09,5,Looking to rage? Look no further. Seriously though amazing staff, great food and always the hottest jams playing.
2017-08-24,3,Great place been here multiple times but this time it took the servers 20mins to take our order. Had to get up & go to the bar to get a round in. Hopefully next visit they are more attentive.
2017-07-09,5,Came here for dollar beers and bogo pizzas and the service was great and pizza tasty. Waitress was attentive and pleasent, is definitely return. Just come before 8ish if you want to avoid $5 cover
2017-06-08,3,First off they have a cover of $5 for women and $10 for men on a Tuesday. Yea it's $1 beers but the beers are tiny af. The atmosphere is crunk. Looks like a bunch of college kids. But we actually had a great night!!! I guess after you down like 10 beers you start feeling it and the DJ was bad ass. So I'm giving it 3 stars.
2017-04-11,4,The first spot I went to on my night out with my friends for his 24th birthday.It nearly took us 25-30 minutes to get in and were letting people in ONLY when a group were leaving the bar. When we entered it was SUPER packed, but thats typical for a saturday night. I'm assuming it's a popular spot because it was so packed, and there was a long line to get in. We got to the bar, and as I was trying to get past people I asked this one guy if him and his girlfriend were ordering drinks and LUCKILY the guy was the brother of one of the bartenders so he was able to get our attention and he took our orders. I ordered a redbull (only comes in glass form, no cans available), jameson and ginger ale, and a blue moon, but since they were out of the beer we asked, the bartender gave it to us on the house which was awesome.We ended up at the back of the bar and the most annoying thing kept happening where bus boys and cleaning people had to keep pushing past us, which I was not okay with. They had a small bar in the back as well, BUT CASH ONLY !!! with everything (a ginger ale and jameson, red bull, and a beer) I only paid $14. What a steal ! The music was really good, and I definitely enjoyed my time. Check this spot out if youre ever in the Hoboken area on the weekends.
2017-03-23,3,Came here on a tues night, they had $1 mugs and a 2 for 1 pizza deal for 10.50 the pizzas were both personal size thin crust n pretty good.  Only downside is some friends were charged a $10 cover charge after 9pm? I could have the time wrong.
2017-03-05,1,This accurately sums up what the Rock turns into at night. The trail of wet and stomped out toilet paper extended out of the bathrooms and into the kitchen. This place has become a cesspool, albeit a profitable one. The way the staff interacts with customers is indicative of this. If it wasn't for the prime location, this place would be featured on an episode of Bar Rescue.
2017-03-05,1,Shit bar, even shittier bouncers. I agree with persons comment below. If I could give this place a 1/4 of a star I would do that.
2017-02-05,5,What's not to love? Best bartenders and you can always count on a good time!!  Hobokens gem!
2017-01-17,1,The security here must have been picked on in high school. Especially a bald guy who enjoy pushing women out the way to make space for those that are coming and going. When you walk in your literally pushed in every direction, drinks spilled all on the floor and a bunch of 21 year olds grinding on each other in heat. Basically a low budget frat house.
2016-12-22,1,Where do I begin? Bartenders clearly have their personal friends they would rather serve than the other customers. I have been to many dollar beers, I go to school in Morristown.Waited over a half hour for one drink. They ran out of green tea shots at 11:30pmBy far the worst bar service I have ever had.
2016-12-20,1,Never in my life have I felt so disrespected by the bouncers at a bar. If you plan to come here and enjoy yourself even in the most minimalistic form you won't. The bouncers are huge and will grad you and shove you and tell you to "move the fuck out of the way because they don't give a fuck" no matter your sex or size. I am a 5'2" girl and was thrown across the bar because the bouncer was trying to pass with a large table. Stop cleaning. Also the dj makes a birthday shoutout every 2 minutes and it's weird and uncomfortable. Just avoid this bar at all costs.
2016-11-10,4,I came here for the first time on Election day. T'was a Tuesday sooooooo..... $1 beer??? wassuup thoooooo????!!!!! you really can't beat that! Young crowd, the Dj was playing good shit, pretty cool spot.
2016-10-16,4,Been here a few times. Never for the infamous (though appealing) $1 mug happy hour. Just for a Saturday afternoon and a Friday lunch. Both were enjoyable - not crowded, good service, solid beer/food. Convenient location doesn't hurt either. I'm sure I'll be back.
2016-09-23,5,Truly love this bar. It has the old city pub feel with a youthful non corporate local vibe. The food is on point. From the buffalo chicken crisps to the amazing Turkey burger (tip get it with sautéed onions and jack cheese) the food quality is no joke great. To add the overall demeanor of the staff has never been less than respectful and loyal to regulars and new folks alike. Sure it can be packed but it's a fun kind of packed. Sunday's are great for a wild giants game and for lunch the 7$ specials mon-fri are a hidden gem. Bar staff is not pretentious and bouncers keep a great balance as they are not jerks or looking to become door celebs but genuine good guys doing their job. And of course who can beat the off the PATH happy hour $1 drafts !  Win win.. Never change green rock !!!
2016-09-18,5,Their offer; $1 draught beer on weekdays is the best!Do try the italian sausage pizza (I might have got the name a little incorrect), it's nice.You can skip the potato fries they serve, they're alright.The service is a little slow, but that's because there's too many people for them to handle.Their ambience changes drastically at 8pm, because that's when the crowd starts coming in. If you definitely want to sit and you know you'll be there for a long while, try reaching before 7pm (definitely before 7 on Tuesdays and Fridays).
2016-09-11,1,Only care about new clients and don't take care of regulars. If you're in town it's alright but just a dump.
2016-09-07,3,I'm gonna go ahead and say it was OK but we couldnt actually go there because it was so packed with college kids. But I guess that's what you get for good drink specials! Will try again :)
2016-06-17,3,Not many vegetarian side dishes.Place is too loud.Nonetheless, you can have fun with your friends during the happy hours.Love the vegetarian pizza :) :)
2016-06-04,1,the bouncer kept hitting on my girlfriend when she asked him to stop. it was a fat older hispanic male. gross pervert and the bartender gave us a dirty glass
2016-05-21,5,This place rocks. Up from Miami and Megan and Adrian treated us very well. Highly recommend this place.
2016-05-20,4,Ate here for happy hour/dinner with a friend today. They have a great deal on domestic beer for a 3 hr happy hour. Sounds good to me. We had the California burger and the bacon bleu burger. Both sooo good. The burger is Thick and juicy and they serve it on an English muffin. Service was great too especially for the type of place (loud bar). If you're looking for a place to eat before drinking come here; highly recommend.
2016-05-03,4,Awesome place to get a bang for your buck. They have all sorts of specials, and they're all awesome. Best deal: $1 beers during Tuesday happy hour. Need I say more??? And they're a great sport about it when you walk in at 6:50pm and ask for 30 beers for you and you friends who just got out of work 5 minutes ago and haven't arrived yet. No judgmental looks = great service, at least in my book. They're pretty attentive for being so busy, too. You'll sometimes have to get their attention once in a while to order stuff, but really not bad for a super busy happy hour spot.Again, you can get so much bang for your buck here, and it's not just for happy hour drinks. They also have other specials each day of the week - food and/or drink. Whether it's 2 for 1 pizzas or apps to 50 cent wings, there's something for everyone. Check out the menu online and see it with your own eyes. Their food is good too, especially for bar food. Note that it can be very crowded right after work hours - it gets packed in there because of the great deals. They have a small outdoor area out front, which is nice, but it gets filled quickly when it's warm out. I've never had a problem getting a table inside though. Come here, you won't regret it! I really like their pizzas.
2016-04-25,5,The food is awesome, way above standard bar fare. The staff is friendly and the have the prettiest waitresses, bartenders in town. If you like to party and dance this is where all the cool kids are at on the weekends.
2016-04-24,3,It's just your average bar with a casual setting- nothing special. Pros- there's outdoor seating and it's near the path station. It's also on a strip with other bars making it accessible to bar hop. The inside becomes a dance floor but it's a little tight depending on the crowd. There's $1 beer on Tuesday but beware it's a rather young crowd. It's not a bad place to start the night though.
2016-02-26,4,Been here so many times for happy hour with $1 Yuengling and Coors Light and two for one burgers (I've tried bacon bleu and chipotle). Great for groups, fast service, just beware of Hoboken's two hour parking limit!
2016-02-21,1,A cheap place to drink with decent food. Skip the weekends because there are a lot of "bros" and the type of girls who like said bros.  When they aren't catering to the drunk dudes and chicks and throwing napkins around (seriously.. It's weird), it would be nice if they would turn the music down just a bit so you could talk to the person next to you- we went on a Sunday (2/21/16) at 5pm for dinner and it was a club atmosphere (terrible DJ included)- complete with drunk people and napkins being thrown everywhere. It's such a cute bar.. So sorry to see that they only want to attract trash.
2016-02-18,4,My friend and I came on a cold Saturday afternoon at around 2pm for lunch, and we were the only customers at the time. Conveniently located a few blocks from the Hoboken PATH stop, the restaurant is spacious and has a sports bar feel; plasma TVs line the walls screening sports channels. Upon entering, we weren't immediately greeted by a hostess. Instead, we waited for a bit thinking someone would seat us, but to no avail. We were only able to get a waitress' attention after walking past the bar area, even though the place was completely empty. But that's alright - I decided not to linger on this initial standoff-ish first impression.We each ordered a sandwich, which was complemented with a generous bucket of thinly-sliced fries; the waitress wasn't kidding when she said an entrée each would suffice. Our waitress was attentive throughout our meal, constantly refilling our cups of water and checking in on us. Towards the end of our meal, a group of loud bachelors came in for drinks. Even though the restaurant was still pretty empty at this point, my friend and I were forced to yell at each other. I will say the blasting pop music didn't help (we're speaking Carly Rae Jepsen and Justin Bieber among others), but at the same time it's kind of expected.All in all, a great experience! I look forward to coming back.
2016-01-30,3,If you have a few minutes to burn before a train and you want a cheap beer this is the spot for you.
2016-01-21,5,This is a great watering hole off the path trainyou can go relax have a nice cold beer without the crazy trendy other places in Hoboken just a normal bar which is nice for a change.did not have the food
2015-12-13,4,We all love our wild side and reverting back to our days partying in college. Hit this spot up on a Tuesday and your wallet and stomach will be remain full. Great prices, great service, and a great time.
2015-11-15,4,Fun place to hangout, drink , watch sports, and even dance if there is some room. Great DJs who play the music loud so it's fun. This is a great bar to enjoy drinks and bar food with friends and watch sports from one of their many flat screen tvs. This place has good happy hour deals and good service. There is a bar in the front and a smaller bar in the back which makes it convenient. Love that there are hooks everywhere to hang you things. So thoughtful of them. No need to hold on to your things or put on the floor.Would definitely come here often now that I know it is so close to the Hoboken path station. They also take reservations for parties.
2015-10-31,4,Unassuming and always packed. I really respect spots like GR just because they don't try to be something that they're not. It's just a noisy sports bar with really good food to eat when you're halfway to tipsy. Waitstaff are efficient, friendly and responsive.
2015-09-10,5,Very good music, food and service..love this place...bar tenders are friendly and ambiance is great...
2015-08-25,1,I wish I could give negative stars I paid for 3 drinks and someone took them, then I asked the bar tender to give me the drinks back and he said no and called the bouncers and I literally was taken out on the floor and out of the bar never going here again they owe meMoney and the bouncers are racist
2015-08-22,4,Pros: Music is really good on fridays, the DJ plays a variety of good tracks - some of which are really new. The crowd and location are great too. Cons: For some reason, the bar thinks it's cool to throw tissues everywhere when people are dancing!
2015-08-07,3,Bro...they have dollar beers brah. Totes awesome.Listen, Green Rock is exactly what it is. No changing that. It's a bro bar, but before 8pm it can be a nice spot to grab some cheap beer and a pretty decent burger. At night there is a line out the door, and as I always say, homie don't play that. There are 100 other places without a line I'd rather go.This is where the guys who work in "finance" come to unwind and the girls that say "omg you work in finance?" come to party. It's a bit fist pumpy at night and so I usually am out of there by then. It's right by the path and so you have that crowd. It just is what it is, and they own it pretty well. Not good or bad, that's how they make their money and that's good for them! It's just a bar that has decent beer prices, pretty decent food and at night a bit of the clubby type vibe. I will say they have good food specials usually 2 for 1 apps, 2 for 1 burgers just check out their website for the days. But they are good if you're in this neck of the woods. At night it's just not my scene....brah.
2015-08-06,4,Green Rock has always been my place to go in Hoboken. It's a great crowd, always a fun time, drinks are ON POINT and the whole $1 beer Happy Hour? Literally perfect. For someone as broke as I am but who also likes to go out and have a fun time, hearing the magical words of "$1 Beers" is almost the equivalent of hearing someone say "Your college loans are paid off" (however the beers are more realistic so...).Here's my only thing against Green Rock. It gets WAY too cramped and crowded in there. Last time I went was last Saturday for my friend's 24th birthday and we came to Green Rock around 11:30 after parting at One Republik and literally, it was a fight to get through. We were crammed in and even leaving was hard to do as well. As someone with claustrophobia, it's slightly terrifying sometimes coming into Green Rock on a busy night.Besides that though, the place is amazing. The service is always fast and friendly (special shout out to Adrienne, by the way) and you're always going to have a good time. AND the best part is that it's literally down the street from the train station so if you're like me and you need to rely on public transportation from your nights of drinking, this is a Godsend.
2015-07-26,5,My favorite bar to go to in HOBOKEN! This place is worth my time and money, even if it's to pre game before bar hopping, and even then I usually end up back at Green Rock. I always have a great time and the DJ is always on point! The only thing bad about this place is space, it is small and you have to maze through people, but other than that it's a great bar!
2015-06-25,5,Love this place. Happy hour has $1 beers. And Thursday is 1 on 1 appetizer..Love the spinach artichoke dip.
2015-06-25,4,Love this place. Always have a good time her. Great atmosphere and friendly workers. Bartenders are awesome!
2015-06-09,5,My main reason for being there is $1 happy hours. 1$ mugs for happy hour! I am a big Yuengling girl and can never get it for $1!!  Only a few times have I tried the food and it was great! My work crew comes here for happy hour weekly! The waitresses and bartenders are great and always handle the big crowd well!!
2015-05-25,5,Personally my favorite place in hoboken, although it gets crowded but hey 1 tap beers after 5pm till 8 7 days a week you can't beat it. And every time I go in the staff always remembers me and my drinks and food! The buffalo chicken wrap is a must have and is my favorite!
2015-05-25,4,Green Rock will always remain our backup spot. We stayed at Havana for 1 minute, literally then we went to Room 84 (whack!!! unless you park in garage B/D/G because you pay $10 cover for $30 & up parking fee voucher). Green Rock has never failed us & there's no cover charge. We didn't experience any long lines on 5/23/15 however that is typically abnormal based on past experience; I haven't been there in 2-3 yrs. I was once a regular b/t 2005-2009 but a husband, 2 kids, and other grown-up responsibilities have taken precedent. The only change is I'm 30 y/o now. I love the music, reasonably priced drinks & the demographics. Sure the crowd is to be reckoned with however we just go for a good time with each other. My girls & I still look 21 y/o & we can still dance our fat off (lol). We never leave before last call...4 vs 5 rating because they should stay open until 3 a.m. as advertised and not close up at 2:30 a.m plus maintain the bathroom which is disgusting on Saturday nights but expected. I LOVE Green Rock!!
2015-04-18,4,Fairly confident I've been here during my halcyon single days years ago. Hadn't been back since...if I lived in the 'Boken, I'd be here on the regular...$1 domestic mugs from 5-8, everyday. Yes, you heard right...every day. They're obviously not like drinking out of a German boot, but they're probably at least 10-12 oz. We had a tremendous amount of Yuenglings (rare to get them out West) this most recent visit. The wings I got were also pretty tasty and not too bland either, which was good. It's pretty packed (I assume the working crowd frequents this place a lot, since it's close to the PATH), but we were able to score a table relatively fast. Even with it being really crowded, our waitress service was still very good. Nothing else really that special about this place, but for $1 beers, it could literally be in someone's basement and I'm looking up the next flight I can make back.
2015-04-16,5,First time here. 1$ beers 5 to 8 every day? Why am I not here always. Had the Tex mex burger and calamari. Both were good. I was satisfied. All in all def a great happy hour spot.
2015-04-16,2,Green rock is good if you wanna get hammered and listen to blasted EDM. If that's not on your agenda for the night you may wanna go somewhere else. It's a fun vibe though everyone seems to be having fun. The dance floor area is usually slammed so I tend to hang out at the bar. My only bad experience is that I went outside to use my phone to make a call and trying to get back in the door guy told me I can't and the place is closed. My card was at the bar and my coat was still inside, I found this to be an absolute joke and thats not how your supposed to treat people who are spending money in your establishment. what kind of policy is that? so the door guy ended up going to get my coat and card from the bar and made me sign out outside on a railing. Such a joke. Other than stuff like that, it can be pretty fun depending your mood.
2015-04-02,4,Very chill spot but very packed at time. Nice place to hang with friends.  Good music and nice people.  Full bar.
2015-01-30,2,The bar and restaurant is not, however the clientele that visits this place is the reason why I can't go here before I hop on the PATH train back to NYC. The clientele is very young, loud, and all the negative stereotypes of NJ is packed in this place.
2015-01-07,5,What's not to love about 2 for 1 burgers (Wed), dollar drafts (Fri happy hour) and beats/wings/beers/ for Sunday Funday football watching?
2014-12-25,4,I used to come here all the time for $1 domestics during daily happy hour and all day Tuesdays. The line has always been out the door on Tuesdays, but $1 beers is such a steal.I've had a limited number of menu items, including bar pies and wings. Wings are pretty decent and the bar pies are too. Music is generally top 40 and people somehow dance to it in the tight area. But it's generally a fun time coming to Green Rock.
2014-12-23,4,Its been a long time though I haven't been to this place but yes its my husbands favourite bar (n so the 5 stars) for after work drinks. Good food not that great though. But too crowded due to happy hours n dollar drinks and also the service is too slow.
2014-12-21,3,Great place for hanging out in general. Food is decent as well. Specials are amazing for the area. Only complaint is the service. They will serve their friends first always and forget about you. Become a friend of a bartender today...
2014-12-18,4,Insanely good happy hour that's close to transportation, cheap, and not uncomfortably crowded. Unless you're into loud beats and dancing, leave before 8pm.
2014-12-12,4,One of the best bars in hoboken. They are known for their dollar beers and happy hours, but it gets crowded so it is not my favorite time to go. Because you literally stand face to face with strangers and cannot move. I love going to Green Rock on early afternoons with my friends for drinks and late lunch. Their california wrap is to dream of!
2014-12-05,2,I lost my sense of smell, but here is what I imagine this place smells like:-mildewy beer-Axe body spray-designer impostors perfume-musk of fist pumping sweaty bros-stale unclean bathroomsPlease direct me to the nearest exit.
2014-09-26,2,The flying napkins are amusing the first time, and highly irritating every successive time. The narrow area you must crabwalk to get to the dance floor was ridiculous. Drink was strong, thought about returning to get one of the beers but it was too damn crowded.My friend fell on the dance floor because of the napkins, and there were quite a few creepy guys watching/attempting to dance with us then FOLLOWING us out.However, the bouncer was polite, after a friend stepped out for air and came back in he made people back up. The outside seating seemed like a nice place to have lunch/happy hrI don't know, maybe if you're into the blinding lights and columns in the middle of the dancefloor, this is for you, but for us it was just a pitstop.
2014-08-18,3,I like this place on Wednesdays only. The happy hour deals are 1 dollar beers which is awesome! We get Yuengling for a dollar, you can't find a better happy hour in town. The food is below mediocre. The crowd on a Wednesday is fine, but on Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, I would not set foot in this place. The people that go here are hilarious. If you are looking for a raging dance party in a tiny cramped space then this is the place for you. Side note: the place smells like stale beer all the time. I don't mind cause that reminds me of college. I love this place on Wednesdays but that's it.
2014-07-26,3,Friendly bartenders, fast drinks, and fair prices. Not a lot of space.Expect to be cramped. Nice out door seating for food and drink. Could use a Décor update on the inside. $1 beers Tuesday nights! Yuengling!  Parking lot right across the street and the path is only a block away.
2014-07-01,3,I was first introduced to Green Rock last summer when I heard someone playing guitar. Apparently they have an open mic night, or at least they did. The upside to this place is its close proximity to Hoboken Terminal and that they serve pretty good appetizers.  Downside is how crazy it gets on the weekends and how dead it can be during the week. Also the one time I came early evening on a Friday with some friends, the music overhead was obnoxiously loud, the beer was watered down. Might try again for an Open Mic night but not for anything else.
2014-06-10,2,the reason i gave this place 2 stars is because their tap beer of yeungling is CONTAMINATED i went with my friends for dollar beers on tuesday and i got extremely sick and i only had 3 beers so it wouldnt be because i was "drunk" then my friends went last tuesday one of my friends got crazy sick i asked her what beer she was drinking sure enough it was the yeungling since everyone else drinks coors light the 2nd star is only because i liked the atmosphere and the music was on point but i will not be returning
2014-05-30,2,$1 beers on TuesHappy hour 5 until 8 $1 select domesticAlways super packed and can barely moveFood menu--basic bar stuff but they have specials on itPlays the same music week after weekWill probably run into people you know here without planning on it.
2014-05-11,2,Very loud music and very little room to move. Always packed on the weekends. Drinks are subpar. I suggest getting very drunk before arriving because it is not very enjoyable unless you're smashed.
2014-04-09,4,After seeing the loong lines at the entrance every weekend when we are in Hoboken,me and the hubby decided that we had to find out the magical allure behind the closed doors!Imagine our surprise when we got in and found an ordinary bar,albeit a lil crowded.We slowly started sipping our drinks after being considerably underwhelmed!But then the clock struck 10 and everything dramatically changed! The bouncers started taking away the tables to make space and just when we were wondering why,a large crowd suddenly surged into the room and the music got intolerably loud.Of course,by that time we had only finished our first drinks..so we decided to stay put and watch the transformation. As the night wore on,the music got louder,the people got wilder and the room got darker.Ofcourse,I enjoyed all of it..or rather I decided that since I am there..might as well make the most of it!The food was regular bar food..the drinks were fine and our waitress was very friendly!Would I recommend this place to anyone?..Well..if you wanna relive your wild college years,dance with strangers and have a fun(yup fun includes having napkins descend on u..dont ask me y!)night once in a while..them mebbe yes!Do I want to make this my go-to bar for just relaxing and having a drink?Nope!!
2014-03-21,2,This bar isn't outstanding, but it serves its purpose. Good drinks and/or food specials. And not to mention music I can dance to. Most weekdays there's no cover. Weekends and I believe Tuesdays you can definitely expect to pay at the door, or not even get in at all because it's at maximum capacity. It does get crowded and cramped though so you were warned.
2014-01-21,3,Came on a weekday night for after work drinks to bid a now former colleague adieu. We snagged the front window table as it had proximity to outlets for charging. Outlets, non working. The bouncer working the front door was actually friendly and personable. Points there. Our waitress was attentive, very friendly, and was even kind enough to offer to charge one of our phones behind the bar counter. Food, meh, but it's bar food so what do you really expect. Drinks, are drinks. Wouldn't jump on the wagon to return, but I'd keep it in mind as an option for drinks and bar snacks near the Path.
2013-12-14,4,Came with some friends for a bday get together overall neat place drinks are priced according to the area, yea the toiler paper on the dance floor is crazy but hey ,
2013-12-09,1,Thanks for stealing my winter jacket green rock and not caring at all to even let me look! amazing establishment let me tell ya.
2013-12-08,2,The people who come here need the beers to cost $1, don't mind waiting on line in the cold without coats, and aren't grossed out by the overflowing toilets and toilet paper EVERYWHERE (in the bar area? Really?)Enjoy Green Rock while you can, 23 year olds. For soon you will be old like me and realize its worth the money to go somewhere clean where you won't have to worry about someone puking on your coat.
2013-09-26,3,You only come here after you are extremely white girl wasted and you will be taking the path or taxi home.. You do not tag yourself here you do not post pics of yourself here if you run into people you know you pretend you don't see them for everyone's benefit. This place is a hot mess express and only enjoyable as long you've downed a few. With that said... I always have a fun dance party here. Its a solid place to end the night with a bang (figuratively).
2013-09-07,2,Inaccessible most nights of the week. Other nights it's completely dead. Dollar beer night is a deal though.When I lived in Hoboken I wasn't "in the know" as to when the cool nights were happening. Of course when I did finally make it through the front door the place was littered with bros and trashy Jersey women Move along, nothing to see here.
2013-08-14,4,Cute little hole in the wall dive bar. Not to pricey and they do specials on Tuesday nights. I think it's like dollar domestic beers or something. It had the old times bar feel which I guess is why it's a dive bar. The staff made sure to keep our table clean and tidy. The food is what you'd expect but who goes to a bar to eat amazing food? The food was a 6 on a 10 but like I said its a bar you go for the environment and the drinks. All in all I had a good time and the bartenders was chatty which was a plus.
2013-06-16,3,Its so conveniently located to the path train. I like the current music that they play there allows for dancing on the dance floor. When you walk in, theres a very narrow bar so you can congregate there and just drink if you are not there for dancing. In the back, there is a smaller bar- CASH only at that bar. I came here a lot for Thursday happy hours and it can get really crowded. Its usually a good mix of people, and ends up being a good time... Weekends are also fun here!I'm sure i'll be back again!
2013-06-03,2,Sooo the only good days to go to Green Rock are Tuesday nights. I've been there on weekend nights and it's too overcrowded to move, let alone have fun. I only like going here on Tuesday nights for Dollar Beer Night but I haven't even gone to that in a while. Why, you ask? Because now they're trying this new thing where they charge you a cover charge. And they're not even consistent with that. At first it was that the cover charge was only for guys after ten. Then it changed to $5 for ladies after 10PM and $10 for guys. Then that got pushed up till 9PM. And now most recently they changed it to all night. Like seriously? Come on Green Rock, make up your mind. Your Dollar Beers are not worth the cover charge. But before this silly cover charge issue began, Green Rock was my solid Tuesday night choice.
2013-05-07,2,I love this place's happy hour (even though it's just light domestics) and I like the decor in the front of the bar.  It has nice wood decor with some bar tables right by the window.  Really nice for some afternoon drinks.  However, I avoid this place like the plague come night time.  For some god awful reason this place gets lines at night as if there is anything worth seeing inside.  A lot of people who don't live in Hoboken end up here.  These are the a$$holes who terrorize a town they don't reside in by getting drunk and running around yelling racial and homophobic slurs at the tops of their lungs.  It's unfortunate that there are places that cater to a crowd like this, especially considering it's right in NYC's backyard.  Ok, so I went off on a bit of a tangent.In summary, a ton of meatheads and morons (maybe that's redundant) and the trash they try to bring home.  It's kind of a zoo.
2013-04-17,1,went here on a thursday night.very small bar & narrow.place was filled with 95% guys.fairly priced drinks & decent 1990/2000 hip hop.the end.
2013-04-10,4,I agree with another reviewer that a review is not needed as everyone I know in Hoboken, or who has visited knows this bar. I've been coming here to visit friends and family since I lived in Connecticut and had college friends who came here and worked here. Even living in the city, I'd meet up with friends as this is a great place, located near the path, decent prices, good burgers and wings without too much of a hassle. It's a great bar to meet friends after work and grab some $1 beers during the week, typically a Thursday if you don't know if heading home, staying out or hitting the next bar on a crawl home. I greatly enjoy the atmosphere, bartenders, waitresses and staff. I can understand why it would get mixed reviews in regards to maybe a Thursday, Friday or Saturday night: It does get younger crowd and packed as anyone visiting Hoboken gets off the trains and hits here, Texas Arizona and everything in that epicenter of bars but for the location, you have to expect that. Ideally, If you go during the week, it still has the local bar feeling, as it's people coming home from work and hanging out. Especially now with chairs set up outside, I pass it and restrain myself from wanting to stop in and text friends to meet up. There are plenty of locals and a lot of the same people time and again who are friendly and you bullshit and have drinks and shots with. The bartenders, waitresses always remember me and friends and we get served promptly, and go back for these same reasons. I can't see how someone can think this bar with prices, staff and atmosphere is horrible, unless they don't enjoy having fun and cheap drinks.
2013-03-19,3,Is a review of Green Rock even necessary?  Pretty much everyone knows what this place is all about.  Good times, good music, good memories.  It's a young crowd--once you hit your late 20's you'll start feeling like a dinosaur.  But there is no doubt, this a fun place, and even if you can't stomach the long lines and packing like sardines on the weekends, they have a great happy hour during the week with $1 draft light beers.  Even though the drafts are in smaller mugs than usual (and the beer might be watered down?), it's still a great deal.  Sometimes you will find weeknights where most of the other downtown bars are dead, but Green Rock will be the one place that has a good vibe.Everyone in Hoboken goes through a phase where Green Rock is their staple "go-to" place for a while.  If you're reading this, you probably haven't reached that phase yet, so get ready.
2013-02-08,3,This place is just so... Jersey! All the Jersey stereotypes come alive here. Hot orange fake blonde chicks and short beefy orange guys - all drinking and fist pumping. I was entertained, nonetheless! Came here with few people to watch the second half of the Superbowl. I liked that they put on music during the commercials (though I love watching the commercials, I love dancing more). It was jam-packed here - impossible to walk through the bar area as this idiots all just stand there. I had to rub up on a few people just to get to the back area (which had tables, chairs, TVs, and some free space.I do give this place some props since it is fun to come to a trashy place like this on a drunken night. Also, our waitress Katie was attentive and quick.... plus, cheap drinks.Lastly, a block away, you can find a taxi stand and the PATH - very convenient.
2013-01-07,3,Green Rock is pretty much your average pub. The food is pretty good, but the redeeming quality for this place is certainly its great happy hour specials.
2013-01-03,5,If you're in the mood for drinks, dancing, and specials - Green Rock is the place.It's a local fav of mine, specially because I have found that not many bars in hoboken have Fireball shots.Wednesdays they have 2 for 1 burgers. Love the burgers here, they are delicious. Great happy hour deals. They do several charity events here, and good crowd. Gets really crowded sometimes but I dont mind it. I have friends that bartend here and just love dancing all night here. Fun place.
2013-01-01,3,Cool, cool, cool.  Cheap and kinda trashy, exactly the kind of place you wanna go to listen to dance music and get drunk on cheap liquor.  And supposedly this place has AMAZING happy hour specials.  I'm sure it gets packed since it is so close to the PATH train.  Not my first choice for drinks and dancing but on a certain kind of night, I wouldn't mind making an appearance.
2012-12-26,1,There is no reason to go here. Ever.Maybe if you're being chased or about to have an explosive bowel movement, but even then you're better off finding safety at Dunkin Donuts or Hotel Victor across the street.
2012-12-25,4,Definitely one of my favorite spots in Hoboken.  The place can get a little crazy, but I always manage to have a great time.  The drink prices are some of the fairest in the city and the bartenders here never pass you over, so you can always get a drink when you need/want it.  Music is awesome; it just really adds to the atmosphere.  Overall, if you're looking for a bar that has it all (good drinks, dancing, etc.) come to Green Rock.
2012-12-24,3,This is a bar and it is popular.  I didn't buy my drinks here, but I saw the bill and it was cheap.  Great.  There was a fair amount of people here and we easily made more friends.  Great.  Being able to start an impromptu dance party.  Great.  With all of those great things, it is still a bar that is popular and for good reason.  It is a NORMAL bar.  OMG A NORMAL BAR!  Finally something NORMAL that either does not suck or tries to hard to be rad.
2012-11-18,3,So my wife tells me the other day that she's heard the patrons at Green Rock sometimes skip the walk to the bathroom and just find a nice wall or corner to handle their business. I of course had never heard this before and go here pretty regularly with my coworkers for lunch. Awesome. I guess it's not a huge surprise given the location in Hoboken combined with the $1 happy hour beers.I'm still going here for lunch though because the deals are good and they make a pretty great burger.  Depending on the day of the week they have deals like $6 burgers, half price entrees, etc. I just won't be sitting along the wall anymore.
2012-10-24,3,MAD.HOUSE.That is what comes to mind the few times I've gone to Green Rock. It has a prime location right off the PATH, so understandably it is gonna get packed. However, it was ridiculous this past Saturday. In an attempt to celebrate my friend's birthday, we headed on over there to start the night. Unfortunately, boyfriend and I waited ten minutes to grab a bartender's attention when we realized that it just wasn't in the cards. We left un-served and unhappy-- they let too many people in and not enough people come out. I think the atmosphere of the place is cool when it isn't filled to the brim, but it is a rarity. Also, can someone explain what's with the napkins all over the floor everyyyyy time I go?
2012-09-23,2,I went for a work lunch. Food was okay - didn't seem particularly fresh or flavorful. The only reason I would go back is if my co-workers co-opted me into going. The only reason they ever go is for the $6 lunch special.
2012-09-13,1,Ugh.  I have never been a fan of this place and I am still not.  I think it would not be so terrible if the clientele was better, but for some reason every jerk in Hoboken likes to go here.  Personally I never want to wait in line to get into a bar.  I dont understand why it is so popular.  And someone please explain to me why it is suddenly OK to just throw napkins in the air all over everyone?  This seems to happen frequently.If you like jerk hoboken clientele, go here.  I wont be there.I only attend this bar when forced by friends.  Otherwise I avoid it like the plague!
2012-08-23,4,My last review was pretty sarcastic; so much so that I forgot to mention how good the food is at Green Rock.  Wings are great.  Two for one burgers on Wednesdays is ridiculous.  I was expecting a mediocre, overdone burger.  Instead, I got a delicious, big burger two for one.  Can't beat that.  Try the breakfast burger (burger, cheese, bacon, egg...yes).The specials at this place are without a doubt the best in Hoboken.  If you tune-out the drunk junior investment bankers that frequent Green Rock on the weekdays, I suggest you make the trip after work.
2012-08-23,3,Great fun place to hang out. Giants bar during football season. Drink specials and music during the week. Dancing, fun and good times! However, they charge a cover for their drink specials which is why they get only 3 stars! It's just beer and there are other places that don't charge so...really?!
2012-07-25,5,Came in during a slow time, but this place was open when many other pubs in the area were closed. Lunch special was still on, so had some great food and drink for a little cheaper than normal. Chicken BLT and southwest chicken wraps were delicious. The music playing was fantastic.  We're visiting from Chicago and were staying in Manhattan. So relieved to be getting such good food and drink without paying the Times Square markup. Cheers.
2012-07-19,4,Anywhere I can get $1 beers and $5 appetizers is a gold mine to me. Yes it is crowded, if you don't understand why, re-read previous sentence. Get here early, get a table, watch the recent college grads get hammered in their adult clothes and relax. If you hate people leave Hoboken...or go next door to Scotland Yard for some $5 cherry bombs.
2012-07-06,4,I've been here a few times but the best time I've had there is on Tuesday night, $1.00 beers! The endless flow of beers and the DJ bumpin all the good music, there's no way you'd have a bad night there. We danced until they kicked us out. I saw that there's a lot of things offered during the day so I will look forward to going there during the day to see what else they offer. Other than that, great!!
2012-06-28,1,My review for Green Rock was one of the very first I wrote on Yelp, way back in 2009. I stopped by recently and it's good to know that things have not changed much. Stopped on a Thursday night. Still super crowded in the front, although at least the line wasn't too long this time.  Decent club music inside, but the floors and walls were stickier than I remembered.Also passed by on a recent Tuesday night, which used to be Green Rock's only saving grace ($1 mugs of domestic beers all night).  Although they still have that deal, now they charge a $5 cover in order to get in. I guess in the grand scheme of things, $5 isn't a huge amount, and at least there was no line.In the end, I can't give Green Rock much more than my first review. 1.5 stars, rounded down because with closing of Lana, you're one of the few places in Hoboken that charges a cover.
2012-05-31,3,Where can you sit outside and get drunk on $1 beers?Where can you sit outside and get served by a dope-ass tanned waitress?Where can you sit outside and watch the d-bags flow outta the PATH station during rush hour?Where can you sit outside and watch the ex-sorority ho's flow outta the PATH station during rush hour?Green Rock.  Bringing d-bags and ex-sorority ho's together since 1997.
2012-05-25,3,Jersey gets a bad rap fo' sho' and if people visit this bar in Jersey that rap will most definitely live up to it's reputation. Free for ladies $5 for dudes on a Tuesday. $1 beers of Coors, Bud and other big name domestic drafts. Meh. But, a $1 is a $1.I was pretty drunk, and the horrible music blaring from the DJ booth (i.e. wierd remixes, and top 40 garbage) got me on the dance floor in minutes. I actually approached said DJ and made a request which he told me he couldn't since he had to play a certain type of music. What?? You have to play horrible music? The answer was yes. I still danced. I enjoyed every second of it. The back is pretty open for said dancing. Lots of dudes everywhere. This is where Snooki most def would have chilled if she lived in Hoboken and wasn't all preggers.Would I ever come back here? I probably will end up here but not by choice. Wouldn't say this was my scene....ever. Did I have fun? Yes, admittedly I had fun.
2012-05-24,4,Jersey+$1 beers+Blasting dance music+Open floor=You do the math.
2012-05-08,3,So close to the Path Stop. The inside changes at 9:59 pm from an average joe bar to sorority girls gone wild.Seriously, my friends said it was too early to be dancing at 9:30, but bam, when the Kappa Kappas walk in strutting their stuff with their heels and start mooching with the ugly guido in the corner, you know someone's about to have a good night.Bud Light $4.
2012-03-14,4,This place is located in the historic terminal building and is just a few steps away from the Path station. Due to it's close proximity to public transportation and really nice happy hours, this bar is always packed and attract so many people.The bar has an authentic antique bar decor which gives it a look of early 1800's.This is one of the best spots to enjoy drinks with friends.This place has one of the best happy hours in the hood. They have Tuesday specials with Yuengling and Coors light for a buck, but they also have cover charge which can be sometimes five or ten bucks.The place is always packed on Tuesday.The layout of this place is such that one will definitely bump into people while walking past the bar to go to the back side.The DJ was nice and played everything right from 80's, 90's to current pop music. The servers were nice and attentive.
2012-03-06,4,Im tired of yuppies writing horrible reviews about places in hoboken....accept what this place is a beer and wing bar and stop being so stuck up! The deals are great and the staff in friendly period.
2012-02-26,1,Green Rock is my arch-nemesis.  My friends dare not even suggest it for our weekend itineraries.  Every time I've gone here its been a miserable experience.  The place is constantly packed wall to wall with tons of drunken fools who are 25 going on 18-and-I-can't-hold-my-liquor.  The only way to walk the length of the bar is by shimmying against strangers' bodies while dodging clumsily held pints and flailing body parts.  The air is thick with beer breathe and slurred words, and the dance floor sticky with various fluids.Not.my.scene.at.all.NOTE:  Even though I hate it here, everyone else in the place always seems to be having a blast.
2012-02-24,3,Extremely attentive bartender. Always come here on tuesdays and it always has me yearning to return and may I add that the music is actually good.
2012-01-15,2,This place is full of obnoxious out of towners.  The music is ridiculously loud (in a bad way).  I stumbled in at around 10PM on a Friday.  Girl to guy ratio was 1:7.  Also, some dude kept annoying clapping and pretended to have a good time.  Like the other sports bars in this part of Hoboken, this place lacks any character.  There are better places to go in this section of Hoboken.  But if you drink coors light and have a low IQ, you'll dig this place.
2012-01-03,4,the best everyday specials you can ask for, the best service nd great bartenders.........always had great time at Green Rock!The decor, seating, music, drinks n foooodddd........all too good!
2012-01-02,3,The Green Rock is a rare find in a yuppie town like Hoboken.  To be fair, I feel like I must start this review by being brutally honest. The bar isn't the nicest of venues.  It has that odor of old wood that has been marinated in gallons of cheap beer, most likely the result of hundreds of spilled $1 drafts... but I digress.  The bar has some tight spaces, and it can be ridiculously difficult to maneuver through the crowd .  Also, the ladies room is tiny and is one of the worst that I have ever seen.Yet the Green Rock does have some redeeming qualities.  Most importantly, some fantastic deals.  I have only been for happy hour on a Thursday night (actually, make that several Thursday nights) and have enjoyed the $1 drafts from 5-8, at which point the drafts increase to a shockingly high price of $2 a pint. On Thursdays you can also find a 2 for 1 appetizer deal that helps to make it a cheap night out.If you like the fancy trendy bars and clubs, you will hate the Green Rock.  But if you're a fun, go with the flow type of person, give it a shot.
2011-11-24,4,Sign of a good bar?  Fresh beer and good food...and plenty of TV's.Great beer-check.Great wings, awesome sliders-check.Play the Chicago Bears game-check.WiFi-no check- get WiFi man!Simply stated, it's a good bar- go get yourself a plate of sliders and thank me later.
2011-10-31,3,Green Rock is the bar equivalent of a Justin Bieber jam.  If you're over the age of 13 (which you have to be to enter), it isn't your proudest moment to admit you like it.  And much like Justin Bieber on the radio dial, if there is anything even remotely better or hipper going on, that's where you're going.  But sometimes there isn't, so you sing along and actually kind of enjoy it.  That's a night at Green Rock.  I'll go but I will be damned if I check in on Four Square.I would be remiss if I didn't kick this off with a glowing review of $1 beer night.  Sure, all you are getting for a dollar is a Bud Light or Coors Light, but also you are getting a Bud Light or a Coors Light on a Friday in Hoboken FOR A DOLLAR.  My local rip-off liquor store can't beat that deal.  As to be expected, dollar beer night is nearly always packed, sans the Friday before a holiday weekend.  If you get there early, you can try to commandeer a table, but inevitably a local frat boy will make your table his own as he hunts for a place to put the 20 beers he just ordered.The food here is edible, though certainly nothing to write home about.  The bar pies are decent and the wings are above average.  I never plan to have a meal here, but the fare is decent enough that I don't kick myself if I forget to eat before I head over.Other than the dollar drafts, Green Rock's saving grace is their willingness to accommodate with their sports packages on the television.  While the game you want might not be on when you first walk in (and truly, why would a Twins/Angels regular season game be?), but if you ask nicely, they will always find a screen to put it on for you.Green Rock is not a place for those with a weak stomach for the stereotypical New Jersey characters.  They'll always be out in full force, knocking into you while they gravitate towards each other for a fist bump.  But if you can enjoy a night out with some blinders on and have a group at the helm to protect you from body blocks, you'll have a good time at the Green Rock.  Just don't tell anyone you did.
2011-10-16,3,Dollar beer mug happy hour...can't beat it.
2011-09-20,1,Pass this place up for Scotland Yard if you want a party all the time
2011-09-02,3,We went there on a Friday afternoon, it was great...delicious apps (we got the chicken quesadillas & sliders), good drinks, not crowded, a very good time!Now, we left around 5:30 & it started to get very crowded...obviously EVERYONE shows up for the $1 beers from 5 - 7, and I wouldn't want to be anywhere near here on a Friday or Saturday night!!! Show up late afternoon & you should have a great time......
2011-08-18,3,If it was up to my sister it would only get 1 star, but I liked my food, so I had to balance it out.We stumbled in here on a rainy, sunday afternoon. We were starving and being our first time in Hoboken, well first time in Jersey, we didn't know any better. Even though I had a beer I am basing my review on the food. I ordered the buffalo chicken...yum, I have this sick thing for buffalo anything! The only criticism I have is that it took a long time to get our food and the fries were cold, but the sandwich was good.My sister, however, ordered the bangers and mash...which she (usuallly) loves. All day long and even into the next day she kept telling us how disgusting that meal was! I didn't taste it, but I have to agree with her that the sausage was NO BANGER! It looked more like a defrosted, breakfast sausage and she said that's how it tasted. She was also grossed out by the beef gravy...definitely not a traditional bangers and mash.So, if you go for the food, stay away from the bangers and mash!
2011-07-28,5,I love coming here on Wednesdays for their 2-for-1 burgers special. Great happy hour with $1 drafts.
2011-06-26,2,I have absolutely no clue what the hype is about this place. It's literally a noisy college bar that's conveniently located by the train station in Hoboken. On a busy night, which is almost every night of the week, it's so crowded in such a tight/narrow space that you literally have no room to sit or walk much alone breathe. I've seen people here dancing, and I have no clue why they bother doing it here when there's no room and you can't hear the music over all the noise. Other times, you'll have to see random people making out with each other. Everyone is also trying to get through the crowds so drinks spill all over the floor; you're literally going to step in sticky beer all night. I can say they have good happy hour specials throughout the week, but it's definitely not enough for me to want to come here. It might seem fun if you go with a bunch of friends, but this place is just not for everyone. I can barely make conversation with anyone at this place, so what's the point. Come here if you want to get piss drunk and act foolish, otherwise, I'm not sure I will return.
2011-06-23,4,Love this Bar through the ages.Since I moved here in '04, Green Rock has helped me age. From my single days, great place to meet singles. Sunday Funday Football is great (even for a Bills fan). Can't beat "Dollar Beer Mugs" and "Half-priced Burger's"... but my all-time favorite is the "Buffalo Chicken Wrap"! Delicious. Service is always awesome from the waitresses... give them credit, food and drinks always come out quick... and usually don't have to ask for refills. I tend to avoid the late Friday night crowd now that I'm married, but once in a while, My wife and I will bring a few friends just to try and make our way to the dance-floor like the good old days.
2011-06-23,3,This a tale of two Green Rocks.  One Green Rock offers dollar drafts.  This bar is overly packed with terrible music, terrible people, and napkins flying in the air.  WHY DO THEY THROW NAPKINS IN THE AIR!?!?!?!!?  This Green Rock fully deserves 1 star.But there is a better Green Rock.  One with burger deals!  Delicious appetizers!  Decent beer specials!  Live Bands!  Lots of sports!  This Green Rock hovers somewhere in the 4/5 range.Average it out and you pretty much get an A-OK three stars.  When you plan your visit here just know what situation you're going to walk into.  Green Rock is very close to the PATH so expect a huge line on $1 beer nights.
2011-06-09,1,I won't miss this place. Not even a little bit. It's always packed. The beer is selection is poor. The crowd is a collection of beer-spilling, fist-pumping, cologne-drenched...gentlemen seeking a jolly old time.I honestly do not see the appeal of this place. Even the poorly selected music is too loud to allow me to hear my own deprecating thoughts. The only redeeming factor is the $1 drafts. And that's a deal I won't mind passing up.
2011-04-21,3,I got into coming here last year.  I figured it would be a fun time coming around on a Tuesday ($1 mugs) and watch the Yankees play on the TVs.  For the most part it's somewhat enjoyable, albeit crowded.  The place is extremely narrow, and you can bet on standing in a cramped corner or continually getting bumped into.  Sometimes I get lucky and end up with a seat at the bar, but you still get to deal with the constant arm over your shoulder.  The food is quite good actually, I would definitely recommend it as long as you have a table or spot at the bar to eat it!For the most part I have no complaints about this bar.  You get what you pay for, etc.  The only complaint I guess is that the clientele can be quite obnoxious.  A few months back, I was sitting at the bar and some bro walks up and keeps leaning into me while he's waiting to order a beer.  Now keep in mind I'm SITTING at the bar, no room to move over or anything (someone else on the other side).  So I hold my ground.  The dude gets his beer and then starts with that "why you pushin up on me" BS.  I tell him to look around, it's crowded, I can't move anywhere else either and I'm sitting in a chair.  Bro then says something about how I should show some respect and wanders back into his corner.  Yeah okay.Other than that, it's not SO bad.  Come early or stay home, as this is not worth waiting on line outside on the weekends for.
2011-04-17,3,Good place for locals to mingle with out of towners.  Good staff and cold drinks.  Seems more of a young crowd but with a good mix of older people.  I'd go back
2011-04-12,3,$1 domestic mugs every night and all night on tuesdays! I came all the way from the city to meet my friends for this legendary happy hour, I didn't believe it existed. They had awesome fries, pizzas were just ok but were 2 for 1 on tuesdays as well. Great 90's music and lots of tvs to watch the game. Its also really conveniently close to the PATH train. Would come here everyday for happy hour drinks if I could.
2011-04-05,4,I'm no bar person, but I strangely adore this place.  Probably because I've come here a few times after work with some co-workers to enjoy the happy hour of $1 mugs (tiny mugs, like the size of 1 can of beer) and the wings.  The wings are very good if you like those classic hot wings, dripping in orange sauce, with a hint of spiciness.  And they have 2 for 1 appetizers Thursday nights, so get yer quesadillas and spinach dip (amongst other things) for cheap!People tell me they dilute the beer down for the $1 mugs.  I don't know about you, but it still gets me drunk...What amazes me is that Friday, Saturday nights there is often a line out here.  Seriously?  That always amused me.  I have been here before on a Saturday night, and the eating area became a pseudo-dance floor, with beer and guidos and all.  Felt like trashy NJ fun, but I actually had a great time!
2011-04-02,1,I walked into this place and immediately turned around and walked back out.  The only reason to come here is if...#1: You like to imitate the Jersey Shore fist-pumping characters and don't want to feel out of place#2: You like the smell of gallons of cheap cologne/perfume#3: You want to get your drink spilled on you by some asshole#4: You want to be ogled, or worse - groped - by some asshole (that you can't get away from because you're packed in like sardines)Seriously, this place epitomizes any/everything on my list of "can't stands" in Hoboken.
2011-03-01,2,Green Rock is like an ankle-biting terrier. It may help you talk to pretty ladies, but it's small and annoying, and has this Napoleon Complex that makes it think it's one of the big dogs. It's not.Rather, Green Rock is almost certainly the most over-rated bar in Hoboken. While I am by no means above dollar beer specials, you'd think this was a town of broke-ass deadbeats given the crowds that swarm this narrow watering hole for happy hour and beyond. I don't get it.I don't get how people enjoy drinking within a smaller amount of personal space than the PATH train during rush hour. I don't get how one is to make it out of here without spilt liquor on your shirt or scuff marks on your shoes. I don't get how they pay a DJ that is no better than free FM radio. I just don't get how so many young individuals of both genders think this place is a good time.On the relative upside, Green Rock is paces from the PATH, the drinks are cheap, and I haven't exactly had an all-out, life-scarring, terrible time here - I've just consistently wished I was somewhere else. In as legit of a drinking town as Hoboken, Green Rock's reputation as some sort of libation destination continues to confound me.
2011-01-04,2,My ears shouldn't be ringing when I leave a bar and there's no live music. I'll pay more to drink across the street. Learn to work a fucking volume knob!
2010-12-23,2,Overrated all around.  I like to drink.  But drinking involves: (a) being able to get into the bar; (b) being served by the bartender; (c) and not immediately getting your drink spilled on you by some asshole.  The DJ/the music the DJ is playing almost always sucks.  This isn't really a bar people would go to so they can dance, so there's no need for the crappy music to be deafening either.  Cheap beer is always a nice plus, but if you can spend $2 at another bar and just drink a few before you go out, why bother with Green Rock?
2010-10-08,3,I went here or a Tuesday night and had a pretty good time. Tuesday nights are $1 mugs so you can't complain about that. There was a good crowd but sometimes too crowded to walk through the bar. The music was unpredictable. Not that it was that bad but could be much better. A good last stop on a Tuesday night for sure. Also just a few steps away from the PATH so good for anyone going back into the city afterwards
2010-09-25,3,$1 beers during happy hour.  Tends to get PACKED being so close to the path though.
2010-09-24,3,If you're waiting for a train or a bus at the Hoboken Terminal, this is a good, cheap place to stop for a drink.  They have a lot of TV insides that are playing some sports game and a good amount of tables to sit at.  Also, if you're there during happy hour, grab a $1 beer.  I know Yuengling is one of the beers you can get at that price and the other beers aren't that bad either.
2010-07-12,4,This place is nostalgic for me so I have to give it a high rating. I used to come here all the time in 2007 and have been back a few times since. This is the ultimate hookup bar I think, because of its layout. Yes it's pretty much a tiny, long hallway, but that gives you the opportunity to meet or "bump into" anyone. I have had more random drunk conversions here than anywhere else. The DJ can be kind of lame but that doesn't matter when you've had enough of those $5 cran-vodkas. The line can be a little intimidating and this is definitely a place to go once you have a good buzz going. Make sure to try the amazing pizza place around the corner after your night of drinking!
2010-03-24,4,While attending college in town, there is a reason why a few of us always made the 12 block walk to get hear after classes. $1 Yuengs for 3 hours cannot be beat and waitresses that remember what you get usually. At one point we were even getting the choice of how many beers to have queued at the happy hour price before 8PM passed. Cant beat that deal! Best food items here are definitely the buffalo wings and the wraps. However, give this place 4 stars as one time the wrap made my GF so sick she was puking for like 4 days (had me thinking it was something else). Have also had the burger at some point during the day and this was OK. Music wise they used to play current alternative/rock (Green Day, Bon Jovi, etc) when I was here a while ago. Have been meaning to get back.
2010-02-11,3,After a weekend evening attempt at this packed downtown bar a year or so ago, I had vowed not to return.  The babyfaced crowd had me feeling like a cougar, which is never an enjoyable way to start an evening.  However, I was recently required to meet a friend at Green Rock, as she was enjoying their happy hour specials with her colleagues.  Though the tiny quarters were still as cramped as on a Friday or Saturday night, the crowd was a better mix of ages and professional levels.  The $1 beers that were served until 8 pm were enough to entice anyone to stop in, cougar or otherwise.
2010-02-05,1,the green rock in philly is way yyyy  better!!!
2010-02-01,3,This is my usual spot to go to after filling up on wings at Black Bear. Can't beat $1 mugs of yuengling (or coors light if you prefer). It's been a hit or miss with the crowd and music. I've been there (on Tuesdays) where the the crowd & music is good (I'm into hip-hop). I've also been there on nights where it was mostly weird guys & all house/old school songs.In my opinion, if you're with friends, regardless of the crowd/music, you can make the best of it. Just grab a couple of $1 mugs as soon as you enter.
2010-01-29,3,Not a bad place to chill in Hoboken. During major sporting events, Thursday Happy Hours and late night Fridays and Saturdays, it gets insanely crowded.  Yes, some people also try to get their groove on in the back in the non-existent dance floor. But the place is too small and awkward for that, really.  I like their happy hour specials where mugs of coors light are only $1!  Their decent wings are 35 cents each on certain days as well.
2010-01-20,4,I've only been for the Wednesday special and was impressed. The Wednesday special is buy one burger, get one free, and they have one dollar beers.  This is really cheap when you go with a friend!
2009-10-21,1,The one star is purely based on the establishment's drink specials. $1 mugs. Hoo-ray. Now, I'm aware that the bars near the Hoboken PATH tend to be overcrowded with patrons displaying a certain raucous behavior that can be really annoying/disturbing (i.e., Dry humping your girlfriend against the wall. Please locate a dark alley and make bad decisions there). That being said, such places may have appeal for certain drinkers and that's great for those who enjoy it. However, a certain obligation required my presence at the Green Rock recently so I crossed myself and hoped for the best. I got something else. This was a Tuesday night, Yankees playoff game, and $1 mugs. So a crowd should be expected. That I'm not complaining about. I arrived at 11 and waited on line. Seemed like a drag, however, entertainment was shortly provided when the bouncers, um, well, "bounced" an inebriated fellow who was clearly explaining that his "boy" had his back and that the bouncer should look at him as the type who, to paraphrase, would "throw down." According to the gentleman, the bouncers (who were both wide as oak trees and one as tall as one) may kick his *exploitative* but he would fight and they should know that about him (sharing is nice). Apparently, the waitress overcharged. Perhaps a reason to be a bit peeved, but it was $1 mugs. Even if she tacked on 10 beers to a tab, it's $10. No need to throw a fit. Voice your complaint, keep the receipt, discuss further with management, and alert your credit card not to approve the charge until cleared. Next, as I inched closer to the door -- clouded by cigarette smoke courtesy of the bevy of revolving door smokers -- some other gentleman decided to walk in front of the line and slip the bouncer/doorman $20 or more so he and his girlfriend could get in ahead of all of us. The bouncer slid the money into his khaki cargo pants and in they went. Now, it's not that I've never seen this move before, but this is a rather divey bar. If you turn around there are two other bars to go to. This person actually slipped a bouncer more than $20 to get into the Green Rock. Wow. Kind of like Jack Tripper slipping Jim the bartender at the Regal Beagle $20 to get in. Just doesn't make sense (might just be me though). And the bouncer happily accepted. Apparently the fire code maximum occupancy can go by the wayside if Andrew Jackson and pals insist on entry.Once I got inside, the clubby music made me cringe considering the bar has the look and feel of a typical Irish pub. In the back room, dry-hump-dancing ensued ad nauseum. One person put his arm on a nearby empty stool to provide the necessary leverage for properly "grinding" the girl he was dancing with. A club version of Billy Joel's song "Big Shot" played and I threw up in my mouth a little. I can remember being in the Green Rock years ago and it was a bit different, but perhaps I'm just getting older. If the above sounds like your particular brand of Vodka, then rock on to the Green Rock. Otherwise, try one of the other hundred bars in town with drink specials and TVs showing sports. Pretty standard.
2009-10-11,3,This bar is crowded because all the people hang out in the front ..making it seem crowded....lol ...but i went there on a sunday night ..(columbus day weekend) i mean ...in the back the couple of chicks dancing getting down ...pretty much good place next to the path...one thing i noticed ...when you get to the bar  they have a ledge and a mirror were you can place your drink .. I always countdown to see who is going to walk by and drop the next drink wether it be a someones elbow or purse some funny shit
2009-09-15,4,Cheap drinks, good music, good crowd. What more could you ask for from a bar? Always a good time at Greek Rock. Can't say I've ever tried their food, but as far as a fun night out goes, Green Rock does the trick. Worth trecking out of Manhattan for! Good times.
2009-08-15,4,Happy hour specials are legen...DARY. Happy hour and $1 pints from 5-8 on a weekly basis, but Tuesdays are $1 mugs ALL NIGHT LONG.Also on Tuesday are 2 for 1 margarita pizzas! They are pretty decently sized, but for about $8, you get two personal sized (a little bigger) pizzas! They aren't of Italian quality, but still a good deal nonetheless.  I just regret the music being so loud...definitely not a nice place for a date unless you would like to have a screaming contest with whomever you bring here. The music was so loud, I couldn't hear my co-workers who were talking right across the table???It's in a pretty nice area of town that is less than a 10 minute walk away from the waterfront park that has spectacular views of Manhattan~Props to my NJ co-workers for showing me this place! :)
2009-07-16,3,The Rock may be worthy of only a star or two in actuality, but with 8~10 of your friends, one whose birthday happened to conveniently fall on $1 pint night, and cheesey boston and bon jovi (along with your latest dance floor hits in between) blasting through the speakers I found myself content and pleasantly distracted. Pretty diverse crowd, in both age, scale, style, etc. Good beer selections on tap, each always moving. Leave your high expectations at the door, and just let go. A word of advice for you ladies and gentlemen: do NOT bring your nice shoes here. You'll save yourself a -1 star experience.
2009-07-09,3,One of my Hoboken friends, upon hearing that I was headed to Green Rock, said "Oh.. that's a young bar". I'm not exactly sure of the implications of that comment, but it seemed to be a pretty solid range of people here. I have only been here on Monday nights with intent of having 25¢ wings and $1 Yuenglings. It is what it is. The server is super busy, the food takes a while to get.... but it's cheap. One thing that persistently bothers me is the noise level. It's extremely loud, even when no one is in there. I don't know if the walls are made of echo-wood or what. Nachos & Wings are good.
2009-04-29,5,I always have a good time here. I'm from westchester so the ride there takes a long time but its great nonetheless.  I have no problem getting in because my friend is the bartender and get free drinks.  It is crowded on saturday nights.  very crowded.  I don't ever have a problem trying to get a drink. Music is great.
2009-04-28,3,I would have given this place a 2 but the happy hour is actually pretty good.  You cannot beat the 1 dollar beers - you get a group order like 30 beers for 30 bucks and you are set at your table for some time.  Standing here is just obnoxious - I believe Jeremy mentioned that everyone is just rude as shit which is 100% true and everyone bumps into to you.  The place is way too small and gets very very crowded quickly.If you do not get a table, bar seat, or an area where you can stand without getting bumped just avoid it all together as it is unbelieveably annoying.Aside from that aspect and the line (if you get caught in it) place is decent.  Not great, but has tons of good looking girls and a solid special.  Food is decent.
2009-04-09,3,I would give this place 2 stars for the drinking experience, but I'm giving it 3 because of their delicious wings (only 25 cents on Mondays). They must have only one CD there because they were playing loud club music everyday, even when only 10 people are at the bar on Mondays. The best days to go are on Tuesdays when domestics are only $1. This place is ridiculously crowded on the weekends with people just coming off the path train, so avoid it like the plague then.
2009-02-13,1,Extremely young and crowded.  If you enjoy being elbow to elbow and sticky floors...then go for it.  The fact that people wait on line to get into this place is laughable.
2009-02-13,1,Crowded expensive not worth it... With all the other bars in Hoboken the only allure here is the dollar beer happy hour... The food is expensive and not very tasty... The waitress', though pretty, like too disappear and cant quite figure out the complicated process of running a Credit Card. The bouncers add to the shitty nature of the bar by being absolute dicks. The saving grace of the joint is the polite bartender, but if his buddies are there good luck getting a drink, a look in your direction, or anything that resembles a drink.. I gave this crappy bar many chances and held my tongue for a very long time because of the dollar beers. But dollar beers are not worth it for this much aggravation... If you want a dollar beer that bad, go to Bahama Mama "they do bottles not mugs" or Mulligans "they give you half price appetizers.". But as far as Green Rock? Avoid at all cost...
2009-02-02,3,$1 beers!!! You can't go wrong with that!!! Haven't really had the food so can't judge for taht ... but ... still great none the less.......... gets really really packed  on friday nights ... oh ... order like 5 beers at once, the waitressing can get slow since it gets sooo packed!
2008-10-04,3,Went here, had a good time.  Its a good bar if you're in the neighborhood already, nothing to seek out.  Tuesday nights are dollar beer nights, so beware of the line extending down the street. All in all a good bar, close to transport, with a decent selection of beers on tap.
2008-10-03,4,Green Rock Rocks. I know that sounds stupid, but this place kicks a$$ for a Hoboken Down and Dirty bar.There are always specials. I think there is a $1 Beer special every night of the week until 8pm. And on Wednesdays there is a 'buy 1 burger, get one free' special to go along with the $1 beers. I think the cheapest bill I've ever had was here, for about $15. We (2 guys) stumbled out of there with a good buzz.Avoid GR on friday and saturday nights after 9pm. Super slammed.
2008-09-24,4,WINGS.  no matter how many we order you guys come through.
2008-01-12,3,Beers on tap include Stella, Hoegaarden, Yuengling, Guinness, etc. Nothing special. DJ spins hip hop/top 40 Thursdays - Saturdays and last call was at 1:30 a.m.
