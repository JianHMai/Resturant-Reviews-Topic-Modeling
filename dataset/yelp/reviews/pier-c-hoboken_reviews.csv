2021-05-22,4,I like that Pier C is its own little island you have to cross a bridge to get to. It's a lot smaller than Pier A (is there a Pier B?) and offers slightly different but still great views of Manhattan. This park seems better for a quick stroll around than one you may spend more time sitting and being at. There was a playground which is nice for people with kids. There's also a gate at the end of the way with locks. I didn't get it, and when I looked up why, it seems corny and also not very appealing to look it.Since it's so close to Pier A and thus close to Hoboken terminal, it's worth a quick walk around to see  the views, but it is the smaller of the two parks.
2021-04-24,4,It's been quite a while that my partner and I have visited the water front in Hoboken. This place seems to be pretty new with kids playground in the center of the island. They have grass section, benches, observation binoculars to see Manhattan and the surrounding area. The scenery is still quite amazing with a whole panoramic view of the New York skyline. You are situated between Midtown and downtown Manhattan if you want to know position of where this is at. What a great place to sit and relax which we highly recommend it.
2021-01-06,5,Love this park. It has a beautiful view of the water and the NYC skyline. Pro tip to the boys: It's a perfect date-but-not-yet-a-serious-date spot. My favorite thing to do is to bring a friend or otherwise to this spot and walk and chat with a cool bev in hand. I have had the best conversations walking along here. Something about the views just puts your mind at ease and you just feel open. I usually go in warmer weather. Today was brutally cold by the water especially after sundown. But it was beautiful nonetheless. Also, if you have children, they have such an aesthetic AF modern looking playground that even adults can appreciate. Really enjoy the intentional design that was clearly thought into every aspect of this park over the water, from the benches, to the landscaping to all of the structures housed here. It honestly never gets old. There are lots of piers and walkways along Edgewater, Hoboken, and Jersey City but this one is the best. My forever secret spot I only bring certain people to. Today, I share it with you because I guess you're special! :p
2020-11-22,5,A great park for walking your dog or just enjoying a view of NYC. COVID Measures: I saw signs around the park this weekend which read "No mask, no entry." However, there weren't any people enforcing this rule (at least from my oerspective). However, people generally maintained their distance from others so I didn't feel too worried about the situation. Facilities: Besides having a pear that just out into the river, Pier C Park has a small playground on an island connected to it by a small bridge. Parents would probably love this, especially if they wanted to bring their kids around for a stroll. Environment: The environment around the park is very relaxing and definitely gives out a residential vibe. Close by to the park there is a runner's path lined by trees which seems to be very popular with the locals. Verdict: This park is definitely worth a visit, especially if you are looking to get a breath of fresh air during the pandemic. Cheers.
2020-07-29,5,Pier C provided a great area to relax during some great weather in Hoboken. Enjoyed the great view and clean park
2019-07-15,5,Came across this area on Fourth of July was new to the area. Prefect place to sit and enjoy the view of the city and kids can eat and enjoy the walk and fresh breeze from the water. So peaceful and quiet
2018-07-05,5,What a gorgeous little playground on a cute little island. I did not realize this was here until very recently. My kids absolutely love it. There is a ton of police presence throughout the area and the playground itself is very well tended to. With all of the food trucks, bars, grilles, and cafe's nearby. It is a great spot for families to come and allow their kids to enjoy some time to themselves while the adults trade places every so often to grab food, drinks, or snacks.There was one food truck vendor I need to find on Yelp who was selling old school dipped ice cream cones who was absolutely fantastic. He made a mistake in one of the cones which we caught and he just said, "ah no worries, my mistake" and just gave us the extra cone. We tried to pay him for it, but he wouldn't accept it. The extra cone my toddler happily accepted. Not only is the park wonderful but the food trucks and their owners are exceptional and appropriately priced. One such truck had amazing hotdogs for $2!!!!We're still looking for the next neighborhood to move into. We're still stuck deciding between Hoboken, NY Upper East Side, and Newport. Hoboken is slowly edging further than all of them simply for all of the amenities the town has available for families, date night, and ease of access. This park is the icing on top of the cake.
2018-05-01,5,Pier C Park is another park in Hoboken. It has more great views of Manhattan. This is in the middle between two other parks. It has a play area for children. There's also lots of green space. It can be hard to tell these parks apart. It's hard to see the signs. This is the second park coming up from the Hoboken Terminal. It kind of blends into Frank Sinatra Park. There's a path through the park and lots of places to sit. It has several binoculars on the pier so you can see Manhattan. The view is even better than the other parks. If you're in Hoboken you need to see it. It's probably the best views of Manhattan from the New Jersey side. Well even if not it's still great views.
2016-11-28,5,Love this pier! The view of NYC is great. It's never packed when I go on a weekend. During the day it gets busier, especially if the weather is nice, but you can usually get a solo picture in front of the view. The space is really easy to navigate and find, and is also very close to many bars and restaurants so makes for a great place to take pictures or end/start the night.
2016-09-16,5,Really pretty and easy path along the Hudson! Very scenic view of the city, which was lovely to walk along. Definitely recommend as a break from the city.
2016-07-25,5,Nice place to relax for a bit! I eat lunch there sometimes and look at the New York City skyline and also the Hoboken skyline and nearby Newport Exchange Place skyline of Jersey City. The best of N.Y.C. and New Jersey! Plus I watch people playing at the nearby soccer field! Nice place!
2016-06-28,5,Beautiful area, great for taking pictures in the New York skyline and plenty of benches for sitting and taking a break from the city .
2016-06-26,5,As all places along the river in Hoboken, this does not disappoint. Great place for a stroll or run any time of day. Enjoyed walking here after dinner at around 11pm. Beautiful views of the NYC skyline and not scary or sketchy to walk along. Plenty of people were out and about enjoying the beautiful summery night. I wish I lived closer to this place because if so I'd be here every day. Love it so much and will def be back!
2016-05-10,4,I literally come here with my family for a walk every time I come to NJ. It's basically our hangout spot, perfect place to hangout and watch the skyline of NYC. There are so many restaurants around with this perfect view. For the most part it's a clean place with a cute little park. Perfect for a romantic walk or just hangout with your friends after partying in Hoboken :)
2016-04-17,5,A nice place to walk, run and relax! Normally went here after dinner or Sunday afternoon. A great view of NYC skyline~
2015-11-04,4,Amazing park, with amazing views of NYC. I love passing this place during my runs or in the summer at night. Very clean and well-designed space.
2015-09-27,4,You get a great view of Midtown and Downtown manhattan along with Jersey City. It's a good place for a jog or just to people watch. The views are honestly better if you drive up another 20 minutes to Edgewater. They are phenomenal, especially the view of midtown manhattan.
2015-09-19,5,This location is why you live in Hoboken! The view is amazing and the park is so nice to let your kids play
2015-09-07,5,Best view of NYC from any location round new york..beats gantry park or brooklyn bridge for views - all the way from midtown to battery park.
2015-08-22,4,Really nice park, very clean, great views of the city. The children's play area is small, but efficient, I've never experienced a child complain about a playground. The only gripe I have is on the I guess what would be considered the big kids side on the slide. It's a nice slide and all, but the box you have to stuff yourself into to climb up to the slide is a bit ridiculous. As a mom of a super adventerous slide lovin toddler, he wants to go down the slide and I'm not going to tell him no... I just wish they had an alternate way of getting to the slide, like conventional stairs... but otherwise the slide is steep, fast, and fun!!
2015-07-11,5,Great place to walk your dog, get a tan, watch the fireworks on July 4th, or just take a stroll.  It's the most breathtaking views of Manhattan.  Love it here.
2015-07-02,5,Absolutely obsessed with this pier and surrounding park. Conveniently located near the Hoboken train station this park has stunning skyline views of Manhattan. A good eye can see all the way up to the George Washington Bridge. The park includes a playground for the kiddies. There's a wonderful walkway lined with benches and a path for bikes. A wonderful place to spend some time if you're in the area.
2015-06-17,5,Great little area of Hoboken where you can relax, people watch, lay out or simply hangout. I always pass by here during my weekly runs Always nice and peaceful - really romantic at night with the views
2015-04-30,5,Best park in town!  Views are incredible.  The multiple play areas for the children are wonderful.  Great place to relax, have a picnic, walk the dog, and take the kids!
2015-02-15,4,The park has a beautiful view of the New York City Skyline. Although if you were to go with small children i would stay in the baby park, some of the structures might be dangerous for young children. It is a nice place for a jog, or a stroll. There is a big grass area where you can just sit and enjoy the view. It would be nice if the graffiti inside the slide was cleaned, and there was a easier and less harmful way to go up to the slide, but overall it is a beautiful park, and a nice place to hang out.
2015-01-30,5,I remember watching this park being built. the anticipation of its first owning was too much. the playground here is top notch. the seating by the river is one of the most romantic spots in hoboken. this park isn't 5 stars. it's 10. don't miss it.
2014-12-29,5,Hands down the best effin park in Hoboken!!!The view is amazing and the design is so clean and simple. Nice to walk around, layout, play with your kids, and walk your dog. Except if your dog is like mine- 110lb Great Dane mix that seems petrified of the wooden planks and basically crawls on his belly around the park when we used to "walk" it. It's so sad but in a dark way kinda funny. (Yeas, I'm a monster!!)Anywho- great stop in Hoboken for tourists and locals. Have Fun
2014-09-13,5,Yay this was the amazing park which leaves me deep deep impression. Nice spot to witness the skyline if midtown Manhattan, such as iconic Empire State Building. So gorgeous at night.
2014-08-31,5,Wow, just wow. This place is beautiful. My boyfriend and I moved to the grove St area in JC and wanted to explore the nearby towns. We've already been to Hoboken, but it was always at night and always for drinking. This time, we decided to check out the town with sober eyes. As soon as we got off the PATH, we saw this beautiful sight. It's gorgeous. The skies were blue, the grass was bright green and there were trees everywhere. It was very serene. A lot of people were reading a book or tanning on the lawn. There was a play area for little kids, while the parents got to enjoy the beautiful view. It really is a perfect view of the city. The only thing I wish they did have was a bar along the pier. It'd be great to kick back with a beer and admire the surroundings.
2014-07-31,5,Amazing place. 1) The views are breathtaking. 2) The lights are wonderful. 3) The location is great. 4) There is a play area for kids. 5) The grass is green and clean to relax. Must visit if you are in Hoboken.
2014-07-13,5,Incredible views of the city and the train terminal from a delightful park on a pier. The greenery isn't huge, but is a great place for a picnic with an incredible view. The view of New York from here is unparalleled and makes for great pictures and ambiance.
2014-04-07,5,Pier C is one of my favorite piers in the NYC area. It's got a really interesting design with plenty of benches, a nice grass area perfect for lounging on (because it's not large and flat enough to play sports on), and a playground for the kids. There's not much more to say about this pier other than it's a great place to relax on a nice summer day, especially if you grab some food from the many options on Washington St and make an afternoon picnic of it.
2014-01-21,5,I live steps from this pier and I absolutely love it! On any day that it isn't raining or freezing.. I'm walking around this pier with my son. It was one of the first places he walked when he learned :)Such beautiful views of NYC .. Perfect to watch the sunrise, and it has lighting for late night romantic walks.
2013-10-15,4,Good views of NYC skyline from the West, although I prefer the view from the other side. Very lovely area for a nice walk or jog or simply spend some time. gets windy at times.
2013-10-08,5,Recently completed and then restored after Sandy, this park is basically a pier off FSD and has million dollar views.  There is a playground that looks rather imaginative, a small lawn area for relaxing, public bathrooms, and a ton of seating along a walkway which looks out on the cityscape.  What makes Pier C standout is its great design (Michael Van Valkenburg Associates) and the wonderful building materials used.  The design is naturalist and modern; the different visual textures created by the landscaping and materials create an organic environment which the modern design never overpowers.  This is a great place to detour on your run or take a stroll on a week night; the weekends.... not so much because it's teaming with people.
2013-10-06,5,Ah what a beautiful spot. Definitely a must see location in Hobo. The views of the NYC skyline and the Hudson River are simply stunning. There are magnifying scopes for getting a closer look for free. Lots of places to sit and rest. I suggest you get a meal to go and enjoy it while taking in the view.
2013-04-26,4,Gorgeous, sweeping, west side view of NYC. Please take advantage of this spot!  Summertime it is very popular. Many restaurants line the pier inland. The people who live here and have this view are blessed. I can't even imagine what it's like to have this view with a sunset. What...Winning.
2012-09-19,5,Pier C is one of those little areas in Hoboken that makes you wanna throw on a hoodie and flip flops and take a nice little stroll as the sun starts to set.I watched this pier get constructed as I commuted to Stevens my freshman and sophomore year. Everyday a little piece would get complete and I would be more excited for it to actually open, so when it finally did, I was so excited to take the stroll I planned to for years!It has an awesome winding trail, good for running and walking, and a really good scenery--you are as close as you can be to the Manhattan skyline while still being in Hoboken. Now that I've moved into town I can't wait to start running here daily :)
2012-07-24,4,Begrudgingly I have to admit that Hoboken isn't all that bad. This floating park is a gem in the bland corporate boringness of Hoboken. The winding paths, the beautiful views of the Manhattan skyline, and the beautifully manicured grass and trees, along with a fun playground make this a delightful place to spend a sunny summer afternoon.
2012-07-21,5,Yes, such a beautiful spot to overlook Manhattan and the water!  Pretty trees, grass, roads, and scenery.  Great place to hang out, go to their huge playground, walk your pup, lounge, and take pictures.
2012-06-12,4,Great new pier... especially if you want to just hang out by the water, or take your kids for a good day at a park. If you are a runner (like me), come here with the expectation that you will be dodging the families and children who take over the whole park!
2011-11-20,5,Great park! Very cleanAmazing views. Can't wait till my son is big enough to enjoy the playground
2011-11-01,5,I enjoyed visiting this pier during my stay in Hoboken.  It has great views of the City, free access, clean, lots of space for the kiddies to play and there is street parking available as well as a garage across the street. It's close to everything in Hoboken, so it's a nice spot to visit if you're just roaming around the city.
2010-12-02,5,Pier C is a welcome addition to the Hoboken waterfront. It's architecturally unique from the other Hudson River piers, and it offers breathtaking views of Manhattan AND Hoboken from its meandering walkways and kidney shaped park.
