2021-11-09,5,Delicious!!!!! I came here for a quick lunch and now I want to go back again! Meal was super filling and hearty. I didn't need to eat for the rest of the day. Such delicious and yummy flavors.
2021-10-20,5,One of my favourite Indian street food in Hoboken area. I have ordered from this place couple of times and have dine in as well. Dishes tried -- kachori chat(8/10)- holy moly fried ravioli - 10/10(personal favorite) - itsy nitsy naan bites - 8.5/10- Tikka masala bowl- 10/10(My go to bowl) - Ghee makhni butter bowl - 9/10- naughty naan - 10/10 (Favorite) - sexy fries/ 9/10They also have vegan options in the menu. Along with the bowls and burritos menu also consists of various thalis. Will go again? - 100% yes
2021-10-12,5,Chicken tikka masala burrito is going to keep me going back here for the rest of my life. Great place and the workers were exceptionally friendly.
2021-10-09,4,So yummy! food was delicious. Everything was tasty and well prepared with incredible flavors.Love love love their vadapav its very close to what we get in India, I'm hooked. We also ordered the Naughty Naan with stuffed Paneer makhini. Great service too.
2021-10-01,5,Awesome place with delicious food and great staff. Mr. Wilson provides great service. We will definitely be back for the burrito and rice bowls next! We loved the nan pizza and papdi chaat.
2021-09-30,5,The experience we had was amazing! The food, the vibe, the staff especially Mr. Wilson. Amazing customer service, will definitely come here again. The food was to die for!
2021-09-23,2,Ordered delivery. This tiny container of butter chicken labeled "Family Style Entrees" was $15.60. It tasted good but I was so disappointed when this arrived.
2021-09-04,5,Need more of these kinds of Indian spots in the NE. As much as I like my neighborhood Indian restaurants, most of the time I'm just looking to have a smorgasbord of options because how can one just pick one to eat? At Curry Up Now, you can get a bowl which gives you a large scoop of curry & lentils or chickpeas. Or go big with the Thali which gives you 3 side combos of lentils and curry. It seriouslt would be hard to go back just to ordering 1 type of curry. Haven't tried the burrito or the apps but they have Pani puri which I'd have to go back to try. Bite sized hollow, crisp puffs with filling.They also have the non-fennel seed pappadum, which is not as easy to find as you'd think. I like it 100x better and it was what I was familiar with growing up.The staff is friendly and helpful in assisting you to navigate the menu if you're not familiar.
2021-08-31,2,Ordered my meal around 7pm for 7:30pm pickup. See that the order automatically adds a 15% tip for pickup orders, which given my experience was quite bold. Get to the location at 7:30pm, no one greeted or acknowledged me in any way. The two poor people in the kitchen looked completely overwhelmed. Saw multiple people waiting, frustrated, and took a seat. The man sitting next to me had been waiting for half an hour.. The flustered manager came out at 7:45pm to let us know that "there was a whole lot going on" and that he apologized for the wait. Still no ETA on my order. 7:50pm the manager finally asked me what my order was and then asked the two people cooking to get on it. I didn't receive my order in hand until 7:57pm.This is no way to run a business. You cannot accept multiple orders and run promotions that encourage business if you don't have the bandwidth to handle the traffic. The food is good, but the value is barely competitive for the area, and a half hour wait for an online order is unacceptable. I gave them feedback but only got back a templated response with a 15% code with no information as to whether my experience was an anomaly or whether there was a specific plan to improve.
2021-08-26,4,We were craving for indian food, but only for a quick lunch fix since we planned to have a feast for dinner. Curry Up Now popped up when we were searching, and what appealed us was their signature street food. The option on the menu is not various and we had their Holy Molt Fried Ravioli & Death By Tikka Masala Thaili to share between 2 of us. The food was overall decent with proper portion and our favorite was the fried ravioli because the filling is creamy & cheesy with crunchy layer & appetizing sauce. However, we had a small complaint that they didn't serve water even tap water, so we just purchased their limited bottle water selection.
2021-08-19,5,Omg! Amazing . The taste of the food was super authentic! I was not expecting it to be that real. The prices are amazing for the amount of food you can get. Everything was super on point and the staff was very nice they kept checking in to make sure we were doing OK. It was also not super packed which was nice.
2021-08-03,5,Best Indian food ever! I loved everything I ordered and the service was AMAZING! Definitely recommend going.
2021-07-25,5,This is my go to spot now for indian food cravings, I tried various entrees and appetizers and they were good. The manager is doing great job in enhancing  your overall experience. Must try.
2021-07-15,5,This spot is delicious. I had the pleasure of swinging by during an event week and I'm so happy I was able to make it. You have the option of dining in or taking the food to go and parking in the area is only limited to the street or you can park in a lot for a fee. I got the tikka masala burrito and I wish I was able to eat it 5 times in a row. (Maybe because I'm obsessed with tikka masala) The burrito was definitely filling and stuffed beyond its capacity. For my drink I had the mango lassi and it left me wishing I knew how to make my own. If you're ever in the area be sure to stop by!
2021-07-08,5,Whenever I come and dine  here, I am greeted with welcoming vibes. the whole staff has a customer service first approach , and especially Faakhir. Faakhir goes above and beyond for my accomodation , and remembers my face and name. It's the little things that count for me. This is a down to earth tasty indian restaurant. I come here regularly and will recommend all to stop by and eat.
2021-07-05,5,The customer service is great! Employees have a very welcoming approach & happy attitude! Food is good! I would definitely come back as I a picky eater & I liked the service snd food. I had the dahi Bhel & non veg chicken tikka bowl- - local hoboken customer
2021-07-03,5,Really good fast casual Indian food.  Plenty of meat and vegetarian options.  I got the chicken tikka masala bowl and it comes with chana masala. Curry-ous to see how  their spicy dishes are so will try that next time.  Mango lassi is a must.
2021-06-27,3,The Second time I ordered delivery the food was subpar compared to my first time. Not consistent food quality.
2021-06-14,5,Delicious! I was so excited to find a place that had pani puri! The food was so tasty, and it was packaged so well to go. Highly recommend!
2021-06-06,5,This location had a wonderful staff who were very friendly and attentive. The food was also AMAZING! The vada pau and khasta kachori tasted authentic and the pani puri and naughty naan were also very delicious. I highly recommend this place.
2021-06-06,5,Ordered easily online and  the food was hot and ready for us on time to pick up and go have a delicious Indian picnic - highly recommend
2021-06-05,5,Great food. Great service. Relaxed atmosphere. Very clean. Great prices. Definitely will be coming back.
2021-05-25,5,Amazing food. Massive portions. Varied flavors. Unique presentation (burritos, bowls, combo platters).
2021-05-17,4,Ordered two bowls - Punjabi and Kheema. The Punjabi bowl comes with saag paneer, Tikka paneer, lentils and rice. Kheema Bowl had Kheema curry and lentils. Each bowl can easily be shared by 2 adults, the portions are generous.I love spicy food, felt the curries were flavorful but overall mild for my palette. I asked for some hot sauce on the side. They definitely offer a very nice variety of veg and meat options. The Mango lassi was yummy and refreshing !
2021-05-15,5,Listen if you want spicy you found the place this is the best kind of food I found around Hoboken. If I had to choose between the best restaurants in Town a I'd still choose this place for a simple burrito the hot sauce is out of this world and will also make you feel like you are in hell ( for a good time obviously) if you like spice you found the place buts I'd you are not ready to ask for the hot sauce because you you aren't certain you can't take it don't because it will mess you up but at the same time it's so good you will ask more because the flavor itself can't carry it. I recommend this place for everyone e but if you ask for the hot sauce be ready buy an extra water bottle. I'd come to this place every week if I could and I live 50 minutes away. Get this food
2021-05-15,5,Delicious food and fantastic service! The hot sauce is spicy so get it on the side and use it as you please. Recommend for Indian food lovers or foodies new to the cousine!
2021-05-11,5,This restaurant was easy to find and we were able to get a parking spot right out front so rare if you're from the area. Our server Sue was a delight to have help us as it was our first time here. She was very well informed about the menu and how spicy each dish was. We got here basically at closing time we told her we'll take it to go but she allowed us to eat outside at their tables until they needed to bring them inside for the night. Naughty naan - delicious not your average naan. Could've been cut into slices for easier eating. Very flavorful I'd say mild-medium on the spice. Sexy fries - spicy! Have your water ready. Nicely spiced and flavored. You could taste that the sweet potatoes were fresh. Tikka masala bowl - I added chicken it was very good, I've never had the cheese and the lentils before and I really enjoyed them. Overall I'd definitely come back! You should check them out & follow me on ig @foodtourwithlaur !
2021-05-10,1,Went here for lunch and customer service was poor. The food is average and definitely overpriced. There are better choices in Hoboken if you are looking for Indian food.
2021-05-10,5,The food was delicious and the service was fantastic. I would highly recommend the Death by Tikka.
2021-05-05,5,I got takeout from Curry Up Now and had a great experience! The chicken tikka masala was spicy and very filling, and the mango lassi was refreshing. The food was ready in less than 10 minutes. They also have some outdoor seating on the sidewalk
2021-05-03,5,This place is great!! I first visited to try the free meals they were offering to teachers on Tuesdays, and I keep coming back!  The food is delicious, the people are friendly, and the ambiance is really fun.
2021-05-03,4,Good food and good flavor. Had the Punjabi bowl and there was plenty of food. I went with the vegetarian version, which was all paneer. The chana masala had a nice little spice to it. I really liked the picky onions on top. There was even a little side of diced tomatoes and onions. If you're worried about the food being too Spicy, in my opinion it was just enough spice.An added bonus, the staff was very friendly and helpful.
2021-04-25,5,I've been a fan of Curry Up Now for over 7-8 years now from back in the day when I lived in and tried their food in the Bay Area. I was beyond excited to discover it had opened up in Hoboken and let me just say that it totally lived up to everything I remember it being (and more). My family and I are vegan and there's several vegan options on the menu - our personal favorite from our recent visit was the Bhel followed closely by the Vada Pav and Deconstructed Samosa. My mom who is visiting us from India said that this was the best Indian "street food" she had ever had in the US and we totallly agree!Great food and great service as well! We will be back for more!
2021-04-18,5,Probably my favorite Indian restaurant in Hoboken. If you are here, try the ghee makhani bowl with chicken. Amazing meal. Kinda expensive for the portions, but, it is Hoboken. They gotta pay rent. Also, try the julab jamun with kulfi (Indian ice cream) for dessert and mango lassi for drink.
2021-04-12,5,The most helpful staff, give you real recommendations based on their favorites and your preferences. The food was delish and authentic, and how can you not try a place with a cute name like Curry Up Now?! And the owner gave me a free mango lassi, so that was a delight! Their straws are paper - eco friendly gets ya points in my book. They have fun takes on Indian food and authentic dishes too! The Thalis are a great bang for your buck and out of this world - $15 for 2 dishes. Need to come back and try the raviolis and fries and well, pretty much everything else. Will be back soon!
2021-04-06,5,Amazing food! Amazing service! I highly recommend! The food was incredible and fast. This was some of the fastest cheapest and highest quality Indian food I've ever had! very good!
2021-04-03,1,I loved the San Francisco food truck and have had good meals at the Hoboken location. I tried to eat there today but ended up walking out. I stood waiting for someone to take my order for over 15 minutes. I was the only person in line. At that point I asked a woman who was seated nearby if anyone was working. She said it had been a long time since she had seen any employees. You can see there order screens from the front counter and they were loaded. I waited 5 more minutes before walking out and will not be going back. It's a shame as the food used to be good but there is zero service. I'm not sure how much longer I would have stood there before being served.
2021-03-27,5,Great Vegan And Non Vegan Options. Our meal was made fresh and the staff was very nice and helpful. Place was clean and the portion sizes were amazing. I got the chicken sandwich and it came with fresh cut chips, very satisfying!
2021-03-26,5,I am just leaving the restaurant now and I couldn't wait to write a review. Let me first start with Damien who I assume is the owner. He was hands on the ENTIRE time with all the guests. He was sure to help us with anything we needed and was extremely kind. Not enough restaurants have service like this so that was off the bat 10/10 for me. Now as for the food, outstanding. We all loved our food it was so cool to eat Indian food with a twist. The flavors were booming and the spice was there, which I love! I will absolutely be back and that says a lot because I'm coming from Long Island.
2021-03-24,4,Menu is super exciting and varied. Vada pav was good. Samosa was greasy and could use some spice. Pain puri was good for what you can get in states. The green chutney was so fresh, not spicy. Staff is super friendly.
2021-03-23,5,Food tasted amazing! Best Indian food spot in town in my opinion. Service was great too. I will definitively come back to try other ones in the menu.
2021-03-20,1,CONSISTENT WRONG ORDERS - CHICKEN INSTEAD OF A VEGETARIAN ORDER - 3 TIMES:Three times now we order Makhni Butter Paneer and received Makhni Butter Chicken instead. Mind me we ordered online so no room for a misunderstanding. This is such a serious matter for vegetarians. I cannot even comprehend how they got it wrong three times. The second time around we were told we would receive a refund which we never did. Imagine the audacity.
2021-03-20,1,Horrible pickup experience, not managed well at all. What's the point of ordering upfront if you're made to have an extra half hour by a rude and unpleasant staff.
2021-03-20,1,The food was very bad both in taste and quality. Tasted very stale and very unhealthy. I recommend other places if one wants to eat decent Indian food. Service was even bad, took about 25 mins to get a pick up order of only 2 entrees.
2021-03-19,5,My friend recommended this place so I decided to drop by for takeout and it was absolutely delicious! I'm a huge Indian food fan and always looking for my next favorite dish, the Tandoori Fried Chicken Sandwich was something I've never had before but I absolutely loved it. Their dishes are flavorful and creative - I definitely recommend trying it out.Honorable mention - The Naughty Naan.
2021-03-17,1,I found a piece of glass in the mango chutney. Noticed it after i put the chutney in my mouth. I called the restaurant to notify them and asked them to throw it away. But this is very dangerous.
2021-03-15,5,Veey cool plcae. You get all the traditional indian flavors in a unqiue format. They are more like fast food but don't taste like it. Great vegan options! Everything is really tasty and fresh. Vegan beef went well with the chickpeas and rice. Had a great flavor.
2021-03-13,5,We ordered about 20 mins via phone before getting there. They were so sweet in taking our order, we just wanted to be sure it was hot and ready by the time we picked it up. We got sexy fries with lamb - the BOMB. The lamb was made with potatoes so next time I probably won't get lamb bc I'm not a big white potato fan but other than that - delicious. Protein bowl - listen I make cauli rice a lot, but they made it with all the Indian flavors - the best.  Paneer masala, butter chicken, Kadai chicken.  All were amazing, I would just say least fave was kadai chicken but still, all tastySpicy chicken sandwich - got the spiciest too - and the spice level was disappointing but again, flavor and quality was all there. Highly recommended and we will definitely be back!
2021-03-06,1,Ugh, this place just can't seem to get deliveries right. First, the food shows up turned upside down. Then, the driver is lost and no where to be found, Now, parts of the order are missing. Shame, the food is great, if it ever reaches you, that is...
2021-03-02,3,Chicken Tikka burrito had good flavor, but skimpy on chicken quantity. Lamb keema burrito had almost no lamb. 90% rice which was disappointing. Flavor was just okay..Sexy fries with paneer were really yummy!! I would also suggest they find a way to speed up the production process, one of our meals came 15 mins after the first, which makes for an awkward dining experience. With some tweaks this place could have great potential.
2021-03-02,3,Why would you put chickpeas in Chicken Tikka Masala Burrito? And worse of it all, who puts peas and potato in Lamb keema Burrito? Disappointing.
2021-02-22,5,The best indian fast food I have had till date. The flavors and taste hit the right spot. I was craving Indian street chaat like pani puri, daho puri etc and came here one evening. Absolutely delicious food! Must visit. Top places to visit when Im in Hoboken :)
2021-02-21,2,Wish ordered food from their website instead of using service as cheaper and description states the family entrees do not include rice. The pictures on caviar showed entrees withRice which were either added or showingRice bowls. My tandoori chicken sandwich was noWhere near as big as picture as had about1/3 bun left over after eating chicken.  The chips tasted like cooked in old oil and overcooked.
2021-02-20,5,One of my favorite take-out meals in recent memory.  We ordered a feast, and were not disappointed with a single dish, including the creative desserts.The naughty naan was a favorite. Best of all, food was still hot when I arrived home which I'm picky about.  Highly recommend this gem if you are in the mood for delicious and creative Indian.
2021-02-20,5,This place continues to consistently deliver excellent food. We order quite regularly and have never been disappointed yet. Great Indian food, excellent portions and on-time delivery!
2021-02-13,5,This meal hit all the right spots - Ordered the Death By Tikka Masala Thali, which was perfect for sharing.  Went for seconds and then thirds and didn't feel bad about it one bit.  The samosas and vada pav were super flavorful and don't skip out on dessert.  This was worth a trip to NJ specifically for!
2021-02-13,4,Can't believe this place has been open for a year and i never knew about it. My hair stylist said there was a "new" Indian spot on Washington St I just had to try. Good, new, and Indian?? I'm there! Ordered the sexy fries vegan style (also comes in non vegan) and it hit the spot. Fresh, tasty, and upbeat atmosphere. Special shout to Allen behind the counter for friendly good service!
2021-02-07,4,Every time I eat from here I always tell myself to leave a review...but the good tasting food always distracts me from doing so.From the burritos, bowls, sexy fries, naughty nahn... everything I've had here so far tasted great.I have seen some reviews of portion sizes and I do admit some dishes do seem to lack that extra bit to be perfectly satisfying.  That feeling you're looking for after eating dinner...Fully satisfied without a doubt in your mind.For this, I will emphasize street food when thinking of curry up now.  It's perfect to pick up and go back to the office, easy to eat and back to business.Perfect for lunch!
2021-02-04,5,I order here at least once a week, it's that good. I love all the vegan options. The bowls are delicious, but the deconstructed samosa is my go-to. My boyfriend is a big meat eater, and he loves the Meat Sweats Thali. We rarely find food spots we both love but there's always something delicious for both of us here.
2021-01-23,5,Sooo delicious. I love the menu! The samosas had the perfect amount of spicy-ness. I do not like too much spice! The flavors were just amazing!!
2021-01-15,5,Amazing Indian food on the go, I decided to have a Punjabi by nature bowl which comes with turmeric flavored rice, I chose chicken as my protein and dhal and saag paneerThe food is absolutely balanced with spice and taste, you can decide how spicy you want it by letting the cooks know Definitely visiting again
2021-01-09,3,Cost to value was about a 3. Nothing was stand out and cost was moderate 10+ per person. We got one of their burritos, lamb. Interesting and decent flavor. Also got a Thali. 2 were definite fusions and seemed like it. Third was basic chicken tikka, this was probably the best item we  had. You can get a variety and not crazy expensive if you want to stop in to try.
2021-01-08,5,Incredible Indian fusion food!!! Some of the best I've had in a long time. We got the naughty naan (it was like a naan pizza), the tikka masala bowl, the vada pav, and gulab jaman.  Everything was so good, and the naan pizza in particular was amazing. I'll definitely be going back again! Highly recommend!!
2021-01-02,5,I had Vadapav and my friend had Kaathi roll and they both were delicious. Mango lassi is a must try here. The staff is so friendly and courteous, I would love to visit them again.
2020-12-31,5,My tastebuds are rejoicing, my spirit is full and I feel rejuvenated... all from eating a burrito here.   This isn't your usual heavy ultra spicy Indian food .. imagine Indian meets Cali and you get the picture. They have innovative and traditional options so there's really something for everybody. The thali is awesome cuz you can try a lot of different things. I feel like you haven't had rice til you try theirs. If you want food to warm your heart and spirit give this place a try. It's not too spicy -- the lamb keens sort of is -- so if you want mild try anything else. Nom nom nom this food made my day
2020-12-28,5,Sooooo delicious! What great flavors! We ordered a few things off the menu to try a selection. All great and so much food!
2020-12-27,2,If you are looking to eat reheated frozen food then this is the place for you. I tried this place 2-3 times only to realize every time their vada pav was refried, paneer in thali platter seemed like heated frozen curry.
2020-12-22,5,Perfect Indian street food place! I loved it! I had a Punjabi by nature, very healthy and super tasty! The place is really nice, and people working there very kind. I definitely suggest this place for a different lunch or street snack!
2020-12-20,5,Frequented Curry Up Now in San Jose, California a lot. The naughty naan and deconstructed samosas are my most favorites. Finding this place on the map in Hoboken NJ was a delightful surprise. Dining in is allowed although social distancing and mask policies are in place and capacity is limited. Ordered the deconstructed samosa, tikka masala burrito and tikka masala thali with Gulab Jamun for dessert. Everything was tasty delicious and reminded of Indian street food!
2020-12-19,5,Great indian food. The menu is very unique. Definitely recommend it. The people who work there are also very nice and cordial
2020-12-19,5,Really loved the food and the ambience of the place.Indian chaat is really good and the menu has good kathi rolls on offer.Special shootout for the service and the music! All in all, definitely a place I'd recommend.
2020-12-18,5,Tried for the first time a few weeks back & came back three time that week. I love spicy food but nowhere seems to live up to the 'spicy' I look for but this place exceeded my expectations.
2020-12-12,5,Amazing customer service food is fabulous tasteful blend of flavors will definitely be back again. Definitely a must try you will love this place!!
2020-12-10,2,I was really disappointed:( Got butter chicken and butter paneer to go on this really cold day and was so excited to enjoy, but it was not up to expectations at all.First of all i dont eat that much, usually when i get takeout i have so much leftover, but i finished the butter chicken in 2 seconds and also had like half the butter paneer. Most indian places i get just butter chicken and have the leftovers for dinner, so having 1.5 portions just as dinner was quite sad for me, especially since prices aren't much lower than the average. There were literally 2 pieces of chicken in my butter chicken (??), and barely any sauce, it was mostly rice with a bunch of daal tikka, which i thought was the side. The taste was ok, not bad at all but nothing crazy. Mostly disappointed with the portion size! They also put everything in the same box, usually places will put the rice and the saucy chicken separate, so it got all soggy in 5 minutes. Maybe better to eat in but definitely don't recommend as takeout :/
2020-12-03,4,I would lime to give this 3.5 stars.The menu looks very promising but the food lacks in taste.I would give a 7/10 for the food.Some of the stuff we ordered was tasty but others were meh.The chaat stuff is pretty good.Didnt like the kathi rolls much.The thalis were okay but the butter chicken in the thali was delish.
2020-12-01,4,I had a chicken tikka masala burrito, and it definitely combined the flavors of both cuisines well. The inside tasted just like normal chicken tikka masala, but the texture of the filling and tortilla did resemble an actual burrito, so they definitely succeeded in what they set out to achieve. Well-seasoned and appropriately portioned.
2020-11-22,1,Horrible food. Barely they give you chicken. Only two tiny pieces of chicken and more gravy. This is the second time this has happened and I didn't complain the first time. I called the store demanding my refund and will not be eating here anymore. Over priced and barely give you chicken. The last time we ordered they forgot our mango lassi and I had to beg for my refund. Now I am waiting for my refund for this meal. Never again!
2020-10-29,2,No so good! If you're looking for authenticity then it's a NO for you. This is more americanized restaurant and the food is very blend. I didn't like one thing about them is while ordering food they take mobile and later they will keep sending text messages. So annoying
2020-10-25,5,Awesome Indian food! Great taste and beautiful ambience, got vada pav and thali, authentic taste ... must visit
2020-10-21,5,Had the "off the menu" tandoori fried chicken sandwich and it was great. Perfect balance of flavors with spice. The punch and crunch from some picked red onion was a great addition.
2020-10-19,4,The food is good..especially vada pav..all things have a twist to the original but would like to recommend to them to not add potatoes to keema pav.
2020-10-07,4,Really nice burritosIndian styleGood selection of vegetarian and vegan options too on top of meat options
2020-10-05,1,Wish I could leave a zero star for customer service alone. Ordered three things, of which only one item was hot and it still took over 20 minutes. One entree was for a vegan salad and they gave me one with chicken. When I asked for a refund (because I couldn't wait any longer after how long it took in the first place) they refused to give any money back. Instead, they not only didn't offer a refund, they then blamed me for ordering the wrong menu item and that it had nothing to do them. There's too many places to eat to ever come here again and give money to a business that's rude to its customers.
2020-10-04,1,Planning our relocation to Hoboken we wanted to try as many food places as we could before we moved here We passed here every day to the path and opted to get a delivery on our last night It arrived cold , the nan was raw, rice was bland , curry had no flavor ... we were so underwhelmed and disappointed Sad to say we will never order again
2020-10-02,5,Wow wow wow wow!!! This place was amazing! The gentleman (Safwat) was super helpful helping me understand and pick different things to try from the menu. The food was super flavorful, made with love and very filling. I would 10/1 recommend this spot to anyone who likes Indian food. Also if you never had Indian food COME HERE! You will fall in love. I will be back for sure. Best spot in town.
2020-09-29,5,Their Kathi rolls are amazing! Must try 100%. Their panner and chicken is a must try!
2020-09-25,5,The food here is phenomenal. We are big on Indian food and have had some really authentic Indian food and this place was spot on!! Really enjoyed everything can't say one thing was better than the other . I'll definitely be back again and highly recommend it !!
2020-09-19,3,New place. Franchise. Founded by person who owned a food truck and turned it into brick and mortar. Pricey(like most Indian food) but decent. Protein portions small - they say 3 oz but didn't seem like even that much. Not flexible on substitutions, i.e. can't swap chicken tikka for butter chicken. Tastes decent though and not too spicy as compared to other less Americanized/more traditional Indian food.
2020-09-19,5,Curry Up has delish food, excellent service, a clean facility and decent prices (especially for Indian food). What more could you ask for in a restaurant?!! It was my 1st time there and I will definitely be going back!!
2020-09-12,5,Delicious food & great service! The manager Safwat was super hospitable! We even got complimentary Gulab Jamun for our first visit. Will definitely be coming back!
2020-09-12,5,This is a new trendy fusion Indian American food place! We tried the chicken kathi roll and the paneer naughty naan! This is the best Indian fusion place I've tried and definitely a must try if you're in the area! The manager Safwat is super nice and very friendly! They use all precautions for COVID and outdoor dining is definitively a plus! We also got free dessert! Thank you Curry Up! Will definitely come again!
2020-08-18,5,Authentic cool kids meal boxes, with bourbon (authentic Indian cookies) and bournvita (Indian chocolate milk). Kids loved the potato crisps.My vegan burrito was so filling I barely could finish. Goes well with raita or a yogurt to dip. I'm gonna try the minced cauliflower instead of rice next time.My wife loved the Punjabi by nature bowl and it was filling and delicious. She's also gonna try the minced cauliflower option next time.The sexy fries were an awesome food option. It was a big hit for the whole family. All in all it's a filling meal. Can't wait to try more of the other fun options they have.
2020-08-15,5,Big fans of Indian cuisine but don't always love the wait - and so, was very excited at the prospect of our favorite flavors served in a faster, more casual manner. We were interested in just about everything on the menu but settled on the sexy fries, hella vegan bowl & paneer tika masala wrap - and we all shared a bit of each others. Everyone was delighted - the flavors were fantastic, the food freshly made - and each dish tastier than the next. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Very much looking forward to our next trip there - likely sooner than later!
2020-08-12,5,After a long day of travel, I was in dire need of a solid meal and was craving Indian food as it's been years since I've had a good Indian cuisine meal without being price gouged out of the wahzoo to only leave hungry and bitter. After seeing Curry Up Now and reading their reviews, i knew I had to give this place a shot and I'm so thankful that I did. I had their chicken tikka masala, sexy fries, and their death by tikka masala platter. Every was delicious. The portions were solid, and the food was spot on. The pricing was super reasonable. Everything was sunshine and rainbows and nothing disappointed me. I ate until I was (too) full and had more left over for the next day and even after reheating it, it was still delicous. I'm so happy for their top notch quality of food, reasonable pricing, all being rolled into one fast-casual Indian joint. So glad to have this nearby and will definitely be making this one of my go to spots.
2020-07-30,4,I was pretty excited to see a modern trendy Indian restaurant in Hoboken.The name sounded super catchy and I ordered a Thali and chicken Kathi roll. Food was decent. I'd say 7/10. I was disappointed in the portion size of Kathi roll. Generally if I'm paying 10 bucks then I'm used to getting 2 pieces. Had I known I'd def changed my preference.  The thali was worth a try. I'd like to come back and try some snacks. I also got mango lassi which was rich and tasty.I was really pleased by the interior of the restaurant. Post Covid I'd def want to sit in and enjoy the artwork as I eat.
2020-06-23,3,I really wanted to LOVE this spot, but I couldn't bring myself to giving them more than 3-stars.  I love a great Indian restaurant and updating this restaurant to a fast-casual style really appealed to me.The menu is easy enough to order from, although I got confused a bit between bun samosa and regular samosa (I ordered correctly later).We ordered the (traditional) samosas and two burritos -- chicken tikka masala and lamb burrito.  These were only okay.  The tikka masala was average (not great, not terrible... something you can order almost anywhere).  The lamb was also just average.  For the price, I wish they had more customizations.  Essentially you get your entree (chicken tikka masala) + rice + chickpeas.  No options for chutneys or additional toppings (I was hoping for a similar experience to CAVA).  The samosas are wonderful!  They're perfectly crispy on the outside and mushy, flavorful on the inside.  They come with the traditional two sauces.  I will likely give them another shot to try the the other street food inspired dishes as they seem to be higher reviewed than what I was able to enjoy.
2020-06-22,2,please make it clear on your online menus and delivery services which items contain nuts-this is very serious and anaphylaxis is no joke.
2020-06-17,4,Great casual Indian fusion spot in downtown Hoboken. They have a variety of items, ranging from modern fusion items to traditional items. The decor of the place is pretty cool if you're planning on eating there. Some things I've ordered:Holy Moly Fried Ravioli - Honestly, not that impressive. It's basically ravioli that comes with a side of tikka masala sauce. It just ends up tasting like an American version of paneer tikka masala.Kachori Chaat - So good, highly recommend. I thought it was a little weird to have kachori in chaat, but this is surprisingly really good and one of their better street food snacks. Kathi Rolls - I've had both chicken and lamb Kathi rolls. They're made a little different from a typical Kathi roll you would get at a platter spot, but it's still really good. Protein Bowls - These are pretty good if you're looking for a healthy, low-carb option. Bowls come with meat (or paneer), rice, and daal.  You can replace the basmati recipe with cauliflower rice. I recommend getting the lamb keema as your meat option.
2020-06-03,5,One of the best places in Hoboken. Excellent food with unique menu items, good vibe with a great atmosphere. Staff was very welcoming and friendly, the owner was great! Cant wait to  eat here again
2020-05-22,1,I ordered a delivery on 20 May and got food poisoning. Avoid the place like the plague!! I am never going to order from here.
2020-05-15,1,Zero staff wearing face coverings.When confronted, staff said they had them but didn't need to wear them because of the heat in the kitchen made it safe.As I escalated the issue several meals were prepared and left the store via delivery guys to customers unaware of the cleanliness standards
2020-04-29,5,Great food ... trendy atmosphere... excellent service ... A young modern twist on traditional Indian.  The food was full of the flavor we crave in Indian cuisine...
2020-04-20,2,On the plus side, everything was cooked really well - samosas were very crispy, potatoes were cooked really well. Lamb and chicken were also cooked very well i.e. not raw, not overdone etc. Unfortunately, the taste was quite bland. When I bit into the lamb burrito, I literally tasted nothing. The rice was a yellow color but wasn't seasoned at all. The lamb itself basically had no flavor. I rarely leave reviews but as an Indian who loves Indian street food, I was excited to try this place. Really disappointing.
2020-04-07,4,The portions are gargantuan (I so rarely have an opportunity to use that in a sentence.) A million thanks to the staff for not only being there but also for their great attitudes. The food speaks volumes as each bite is a punch in the face of flavor then a sweat kiss to the gut. I can't wait to try more things here. Be safe everyone and thanks again!
2020-03-28,1,As another yelper wrote, they are SUPER overpriced!! Flavors were nice but small portions with large price tag.We ordered take out. My boyfriend ordered the keema pav and death by Tikka masala thali. The keema pav is $10 and it's so small and you get buttered bread. Not filling at all. Had a bit of spice to it.The death by Tikka masala thali had very very little chicken. I estimate about 1/2 cup total with rice. Again, nice flavors but very small portion for $14.50. Way OVERPRICED.We won't be back or order delivery from here again. Maybe if they give larger portions or lower their price. We keep burping the food up too; "repeating it." Ugh.Also, when we first walked in to Curry Up Now, there was a drunk dirty homeless man lingering around touching the screens in the front and papers and menus. He should have been kicked out!!!!! Come on!*****I'd recommend Karma Cafe over this place any day! Karma is soo much better. Better quality food, better service, better prices, way better portions.******
2020-03-23,5,As good as my experience in California. Great to see them here in the east coast. I only wish they were closer to me in Rochester, NY. The people were nice; service was phenomenal.
2020-03-14,1,Really innovative indian food with interesting options. I wanted to love the place like other people here do but my togo Lite thali had a piece of chicken in it (i am a vegetarian and I asked for Paneer). I ordered via doordash who were able to issue a refund but probably never will visit the place.Before I stumbled upon the chicken, I tried the lentil dal, aloo gobhi and cauliflower rice in the thali all of which were over spiced in my opinion. Even the paneer/chicken curry was super rich and not what you would expect from a "lite" thali. I got the vada pav as an appetizer which was also underwhelming. The coating on the outside was extremely tough (like they were trying to make it extra crunchy but it went very wrong) and the onion-tomato jam was sweet which took away from what the taste should be. Regardless of all the above, I Would not return as I dont trust their hygiene standards.
2020-03-13,2,Good flavor here but its SUPER overpriced. A "deconstructed samosa" which is basically a samosa chaat costs $13. Do yourself a favor and get a real samosa chaat from Newark Ave in Jersey City for less than $5.
2020-03-12,5,First time here and I cannot complain! SUPER AUTHENTIC! The samosa shells taste homemade and the filling was so delicious. They are also very large! You could feed 4 if you cut them in half. I also got the Ghee Mahkni Butter Bowl with butter chicken and the turmeric rice and chickpeas. The seasonings and flavors were on point, very balanced. To wash it all down, I got the mandarin orange drink. It tastes like you are eating a clementine, so refreshing! The perfect lunch to make the work day go by fast! Will definitely be back to try everything else :)
2020-03-12,4,I have an obsession with vada pav and I'm so glad I can eat it all the time now, thanks to this Hoboken location. I would even choose their mango lassi over boba any day, and that is saying a lot for a boba addict like me.Docking a star because I've ordered delivery from them a few times and the quality is a bit inconsistent. Getting a soggy under-cooked vada pav is pretty disappointing. They need to improve their QA, but I'm sure they're still figuring things out.
2020-03-09,2,Casual spot with good, spicy food. However, we waited a pretty long time for our Samosas. When they arrived, a woman brought them over, apologized for the delay & then promised us dessert on the house. (An extremely nice gesture) We then waited, waited, and waited some more until we decided to just leave without it. 2 stars for slow service; for both the food we ordered & the complimentary dessert. People who were ordering takeout seemed to be getting their food first.
2020-03-09,5,Wow. This place was everything. Before our trip into the city we were all starving! We were about to walk into a pizza joint until we saw this gem. The four of us each got something different and it was absolutely delicious. I got the naughty naan and I nearly ate all of it which is a rarity for me! Two of my friend got bowls and the other got a burrito and they were all full of flavor and huge portions! The staff was so incredibly friendly and attentive. I can't wait to go back!
2020-03-08,3,Food was tasty though nothing particularly special.We got the tikka masala which was okay, but the deconstructed somsoa and quesadilla were a hit.Would've been four stars but I took off a star for what I can best describe as musical torture, they had the same song playing over and over again with  a drum solo that sounded like it was an old CD player skipping.
2020-03-08,5,Came here on a whim but I was pleasantly surprised by its fusion blend. Always Indian food is absolutely amazing and the staff have been super friendly. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some good food!
2020-03-08,5,Lovely food and service in a clean bright environment. Staff was super attentive and kind. Thoroughly enjoyed our meal and would definitely go again.
2020-03-07,3,Curry up now is a place that serves Indian food with a twist. When it comes to giving a twist that too to one of the most difficult cuisine which involves a span of different spices and it can be challenging to attain the perfect balance of the various ingredients.  This place provides a eclectic menu with dishes that will excite you and will be different from the ones that you have in mind when it comes to Indian food. I stumbled upon this location during their soft launch phase and ordered some of the must try dishes from their menu like Holy moly fried ravioli, Naughty Naan and Mumbai dahi Puri.Ravioli and Naan were good needed a little bit more flavours and seasoning. The little bit disappointing factor was the chat dahi Puri this is such a vibrant dish but it lacked the basic chutneys which are soul of the chat and another point being the potato inside were diced without any seasoning added and not mashed. The potato felt raw and tasteless and the whole chat experience was missing from it. .I am still interested in coming back to the place to try the other dishes and hoping the chat improves the next time.
2020-03-07,4,Excellent service by Monica and the food is pretty good. Been here a couple of times and plan to return, good option for lunch.
2020-03-07,5,Finally got to visit this after a whole bunch of recommendations from my SF friends & really glad to find this cozy place with great food & desserts!! Not to mention the extremely warm hospitality and complimentary small sized shots of mango lass!
2020-03-06,5,This place is fire. Not sure what some of the bad reviews are about but I've had this twice now (Delivery and Pickup). I didn't love every dish I had but I can say confidently every dish I had the quality of ingredients is evident. Papdi Chaat: Amazing. Great Indian snack that they assemble perfectly.Holy Moly Fried Ravioli: They forgot the Tikka Masala dip but I tasted the potential in the plain Ravioli. With the dip, I know this would be a winner.Deconstructed Samosa: Perfect app to share. Samosa is super tasty and all the chutneys and Chana Masala blend really well together. It's pieced together perfectly.Naughty Naan Paneer: Not the favorite of the order but still not mad we split it. A lot of the group was saying it had too much of one flavor. Maybe cardamon?Quesadillix: Everyone got this as their entree and loved it. From Chicken, Lamb, Paneer, and Aloo every protein choice got raving reviews. Now this is super oily and butter as it is a Parantha so has to be loaded with Ghee (Indian butter) but once you get past that WOW it's delicious. The dipping yogurt and chutney is the perfect pair to complete it, one aspect I thought the Burrito was missing.Burrito: I got the Chicken Burrito. I felt like this lacked a certain flavor that would've completed it. It's basically Chicken Tikka Masala, Channa Masala, and Rice. While each tasted good individually, it didn't blend well together. Maybe it's just missing the yogurt and chutney that the Quesadillix has. I know this is going to be a go to spot for me. Try it out for yourself!
2020-03-05,5,So so good and so close to work~! Super cute place and delicious food. I love the really original takes on some classics like indian style poutine, indian style pizza etc...Overall, love the concept and originality, the people are friendly, knowledgeable and great and the food is good! Try it
2020-03-05,5,Love this place. Highly recommend. Very vegan and vegetarian friendly, but great meat options as well.
2020-03-05,5,Found a new Indian street food place in Hoboken. Excellent service. Monica who took my order were really nice n funny. Also the food is nice too. Definitely recommend to my friends n family.
2020-03-05,5,I was excited to visit the famous West Coast franchise as soon as it opened close to NYC. This popular chain is now located in Hoboken and probably my favourite fast food chain in this area. The staff is extremely friendly, the ambience casual and place clean. The owner went from table to table to ask for suggestions or any recommendations. He noticed that we took some time in finishing our meal and our curries were getting cold. So he offered to reheat our food. The staff and owner make sure you enjoy your meal. Kachori chaat:Probably my favourite item on the list, this is a must order. Lovely stuffed kachoris ( kachori is a flaky lentil based crisp fried dumpling) topped with fresh yogurt, tamarind chutney(sweet) and chili-cilantro-Mint chutney(medium spicy). It also has chole(chickpeas in tomato onion gravy) and sev(fried gramflour chips). Excellent combination. A very popular Indian street food, the kachoris are small and bite sized. Extremely flavorful. It is probably the closest to any chaat I have had in India. Paneer Tikka burrito:They have options for the burrito dough which I admire(I'm sure all health lovers do). We opted for the regular flour burrito with paneer(cottage cheese). The rice was sweet but the spicy paneer made the entire combination perfect. It is served by itself and you do not require any condiment due to the slight gravy added to the paneer. It is not similar to a kathi Roll because of added rice, so please do not compare it with other Kathi Roll restaurants! Punjabi by nature bowl:I probably never leave any chance of having saag paneer. I totally love paneer in green gravy(spinach with slight tomato gravy). This is a huge platter with two different paneer vegetables, saffron rice, a sweet mango pickle, raw salad and yellow lentils. This is more than enough for one. There was an option to opt for a naan along with the bowl but for me the bowl in itself was a lot to finish. Loved the idea of a fresh sweet pickle with the bowl. We chose medium spicy. Both vegetables are prepared in a fresh gravy. It isn't too creamy which is what I prefer. It bring the essence of the vegetables. As far as the paneer is concerned, it is soft and not chewy(which is good!)Mango lassi:Lassi is a thick sweet buttermilk. The mango flavored buttermilk is fresh and fortunately seems fresh. Most places add a lot of mango essence. I'm sure there is a some essence in this one too but it seemed decently fresh. P.S - it is sweet!Malai kulfi with gulab jamun:I'm not big on desserts but this one was better than what I had expected. One thing I admire is the size of gulab jaamun. You can easily finish one in a bite which doesn't make your mouth too sweet. This is accompanied with malai kulfi. This is a creamy and denser version of an ice cream. Not too sweet but enough to satisfy your ice cream craving after a nice spicy Indian meal.
2020-03-01,5,Prepare your mouth to be revived and your stomach to be satisfied!  Absolutely delicious food and refreshing drinks!
2020-02-29,5,Great food. Amazing vibe. Super cordial stuff. A big shoutout to Pritesh, Neel and Diego. You guys have always been kind.If you want to taste authentic indian food, this is the place to go. Hurry for the curry guys!
2020-02-28,3,Came here Tuesday for what was called the grand opening, so everything was 50% off and it was packed. I figured that's why the wait was so long, and also because the menu is somewhat confusing and takes a while to absorb. I ordered the "sexy fries" with ground lamb: Indian style poutine sweet potato fries, mozzarella and gravy, and the kathi roll: egg-washed house-made flatbread with paneer. The portions looked small, but were VERY filling. The kathi roll bread had a nice, slightly chewy texture and came with crisp sweet potato waffle chips. I think they forgot the gravy on the fries but the lamb was still tasty. In the next few days, I kept thinking of the flavors, so much so that I came back on Friday. The staff is very nice, but the wait was over 20 minutes with only a handful of people sitting down and already eating, and no one else waiting. They're still in early days, so the staff was guiding each other on how to make things. I tried the Quesadillx: whole wheat potato stuffed parantha flatbread, mozzarella, pickles with chaat masala yogurt and chutney. At over $12 the price is steep for the size, but again, very filling. Also tried the sexy fries again, which were soggy this time from too much gravy but they were still enjoyable.I'll go back, but only when I have a lot of time. The prices and wait time aren't fast food, but the flavors were memorable and that's a high priority for me.
2020-02-28,5,Decent Indian food. Spice levels on the lower side for traditional Indian palates. But overall interesting selection of food and nice way of naming some dishes to appeal to a diverse audience !! i.e samosa chaat is called "deconstructed Samosa" lol
2020-02-28,4,I got the lamb Keema bowl delivered. The portion was reasonable and the quality of the food was fair. It came with rice, lamb, and a side of chickpeas. The flavor was good but the lamb was way too spicy. I understand that Indian food is spicy but I feel like a more mild option would be better for the average person!
2020-02-27,2,Was blown away at the awful portion size. Ordered chicken tikka Malsala and there were 5 tiny bite sizes PCs of meat. (The naan was extra)
2020-02-27,5,I walked in today with the intentions of getting tikka masala but MONICA was awesome and recommended the ghee Nakhon butter and I was not disappointed. The space is open and clean. I will be returning soon! Thanks for the reccs Monica.
2020-02-27,5,Excellent teamwork and nice service! And the food is really good too! They have really tasty and healthy options for everyone.
2020-02-26,5,Monica was a great server! She was so nice and attentive. The mango lassi was amazing too!
2020-02-26,5,Curry up now is a great place to go to for a fast casual dining experience with a unique fusion of Indian food. I went to hear when it first opened and tried so many items on the menu. Among my favorites were the sexy fries which were sweet potato fries loaded with a curry chicken among a variety of other toppings. There was also a fried cheese ravioli dipped in an Indian spice sauce. The quesadillix and burritos were entree favorites and you can't go wrong with a tikka masala dish. I felt like the prices were pretty reasonable for what they were offering in the entrée and portion size, and it seems like a good option for both eating in and take out. Very close to the Hoboken path station and there is plenty of seating onsite. Really tasty food experience here for sure, worth checking it out!
2020-02-25,4,3.5/5 starsI've been eagerly awaiting the opening of curry up now since Hoboken desperately needed a new casual addition that wasn't another acai/ramen/poke/bubble tea joint!I visited during their grand opening, and everything was 50% off.Overall, I would say the food is solid taste wise and convenient, but definitely overpriced for the portion size.  I would compare this place to Deep Indian Kitchen in NYC which is also a quick service style restaurant, but the curry up's portions are much smaller and prices are higher.I ordered the chicken tikka masala bowl with a mini naan ($11 + $2 extra for the -tiny- naan) and the itsy bitsy naan bits ($8).  I was particularly excited to try the naan bits as I have said forever I could simply just eat naan and a side of tikka masala sauce, but no place offers this (until now!).  However, the naan I received were greatly undercooked and soft almost like lunchables pizza crusts. I toasted them at home and they were much better.  Also, the sauce portion was very tiny, and should be bigger given the price.  I would not order this again at the $8 price tag, as it really is worth more like the $4 I paid during the 50% off event.As for the chicken tikka bowl, it's disappointing that naan does not come with your bowl or plate considering the price -- Deep in NYC gives you a naan with your plate order that is also $11 and it is 2-3x larger than the one curry up provides, and they also give you the option between classic, whole wheat, and garlic. Also, from what I can tell from the yelp photos, you seem to get larger portions if you dine in.  I maybe counted 8 small pieces of chicken in my plate, it was mostly rice. The classic dal I also found less flavorful than Deep's.At the 50% off price I paid ($10.50 + tax) this was a great value, but if I paid the full $20 I would've felt a bit ripped off.  Major things are the itty naan pricing and naan not being included with a plate order.  I am looking forward to trying some of the more creative things on the menu, and hope these guys stick around!
2020-02-25,5,I had the absolute pleasure of dining here today and I was really pleased!! The menu offers excellent choices for many different dishes. There is a modern style seating area and it's really clean. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable and will assist you with creating a perfect choice for your dining experience. Today I enjoyed the Punjab chicken and tiki masala. Absolutely delicious. Pricing is very reasonable for the high quality of food served. Curry Up is my favorite Indian cuisine restaurant. The owner , Pritesh, was present and his attention to detail and customer satisfaction was outstanding! Neil Butler
2020-02-25,5,Super friendly staff, excellent table service, amazing food! This place started from a few trucks in CA. Now it's making its way to the east coast!
2020-02-24,2,My boyfriend and I are Indian food fanatics, but often find delivery of that cuisine to involve a lengthy arrival time.  So, when Curry Up Now, a quick service Indian spot, opened in town, we were excited to give it a shot.  The cashier and counter staff were friendly and courteous, unlike most of the similarly young folks working at other fast food restaurants in Hoboken.  Our takeout order started with Samosas, which had a delicious interior of curried peas and potatoes, but a heavily-fried and extremely greasy exterior.  To counteract this fatty starter, I ordered the "Lite" Thali Platter for my entree.  The combo meal included riced cauliflower, topped with daal lentils, and my choice of two curries.  I selected the Aloo Gobi, which was spiced cauliflower and potatoes, as well as the Kadhai Chicken, which was like an Indian-seasoned stir-fry.  The vegetarian dish was just decent, while the poultry one was barely edible.  The chicken cubes did not seem like quality cuts of meat, and the sauce was extremely oily.  Going back to the "rice", the cauliflower was in larger pieces that were more like shavings than rice.  The lentils, on the other hand, were actually flavorful and the highlight of the platter.  While I was making faces through each bite, my boyfriend loved his Kashmiri Lamb Bowl, which I sampled and also preferred.  It was extremely spicy, however, which we did not see noted on the menu.  We had also ordered some Naan, but had been told that they were out of the regular size version, but they would substitute their bread bites instead.  The small triangles were well seasoned with garlic and enjoyable despite their smaller size.  The complimentary Papadum were tasty, but very greasy.Overall, I was disappointed with the food quality from Curry Up Now, which was a complete bummer because I had been so excited about an Indian fast food option.
2020-02-23,1,This is my first time I am writing a bad review for someone. We ordered paneer kathi roll, it was the worst roll I got ever. They charged 9 US for Kathi roll but the planner which was inside was full of oil and seems like it's be vegetable which they fill in my roll. They fill the chips in plate which was not required to makeup. In 9 bucks they suppose to give 2 and if one even but good quality not the panner vegetable but real panner tikka.
2020-02-21,5,Modern indian! Ambiance is very welcoming and bright. Food was fresh and tasted authentic. Love having an Indian restaurant in downtown Hoboken.
2020-02-21,2,I like the concept, but it falls flat. The food is disappointing (it's just OK), the service is painfully slow, and it's seriously overpriced. I've been there 3 times and they've gotten the order right once. But what really just blows my mind about this place? This fast casual Indian restaurant somehow has worse curry and a slower serving time than the sit-down Malaysian place on the same block, all while being more expensive (for lunch anyway). This place needs to get its shit together because so really want to like it.
2020-02-18,4,I have been here about four times since the soft open. I have tried a few dishes, and the results can be mixed at times. I never had anything 'bad', but my results ranged from "Excellent" to "Good". So there's that.My go-to is the Chicken Tikka Masala. A bit sweet. A bit spicy. Love the rice and the lentil side. Portion size is "okay", but not great. For $14 it hits the spot. The samosa are good. Like the mini Naan bites. I'm a fan of the modern, sleek look. Wait times can be a bit tricky. I have walked in here with no wait, and walked in here other times with a lengthy wait. I did delivery via seamless and it took about 45 minutes to get a delivery. While I don't blame the restaurant, I wish that was faster.The people there have always been very nice and helpful when asking questions. My go-to is Karma Cafe, and this is a nice alternative to that.
2020-02-17,4,Really hip spot that just opened up in Hoboken! Their menu looks incredible and definitely begs for atleast 3 visits to fully try all the yummy things this place has to offer.We ordered the dahi puri and it was so delicious! Very filled and yummy!We also got the deconstructed samosa with lamb and rice. It was good, but a little bit spicy. Will definitely come again to try more fun things on the menu.
2020-02-16,5,Got the meat sweats thali and dahi puri! The thali was amazing!!! I'd prefer a little more dahi in the dahi puri! Kachori chaat and Papdi Chaat was too good! Great food at a convenient location.
2020-02-16,5,Five star experience! Love the street food concept. Stopped for a quick bite while on Washington St. and ordered a deconstructed samosa with aloo gobi inside. The staff was super friendly during our wait and after serving. The Samosa came broken open and topped with a flavorful blend of Cauliflower, chick peas and potatoes in an amazing sauce. It was so flavorful. I would happily come back to try other items.
2020-02-15,3,Decent Indian food with very friendly service. I should have gone with the regular rice instead of the riced cauliflower since the chicken tikka masala bowl was pretty soupy/saucy.
2020-02-14,5,Amazing foodAmazing serviceMonica and the rest of the staff Are super friendlyThe mango lassi is deliciousPeace.love.veganAbove expectationsI eat here couple times a week
2020-02-10,5,The food was pretty good but what stood out and won our hearts was the customer service of a lady who worked there by the name Monica! Never have I ever seen such heart warming and fantastic service. My husband and I will definitely return for her and probably go to wherever she works! Keep it up Monica and thank you
2020-02-10,4,Awesome food and service! In an area that is densely populated with Italian restaurants and bar food, I'm happy to see this Indian Street Food restaurant make an appearance. Large portions and reasonable prices. Will definitely be back!
2020-02-09,5,The rating is primarily for the staff. Especially for Monica. She is excellent at her craft, absolutely brilliant customer service and a very aTtentive guest management.The food was alright, nothing out of the ordinary! I would revisit, because of the de Eric e.
2020-02-08,4,Went in without any expectations and was not completely disappointed. Staff recommended to try the makhni sauce so we ordered the itsi bitsi naan bits. Sauce was okay, didn't have the right amount of sweetness . Vada pav is definitely worth a try. Kathi roll had too much egg (felt almost like omelette wrap) but the filing was tasty. Egg  quantity made it too heavy and bulky. Ambience was welcoming. Staff was  warm and courteous. Will not hesitate to visit again
2020-02-08,1,I was so excited for this new Indian place! But it was a huge disappointment and wish I could give it a zero star. We had paneer tikka bowl and naughty naan . Paneer gravy in naughty naan was so sweet. I have never had WORSE paneer in my life. Chole and paneer which came in the tikka bowl were tasteless and nothing like indian authentic taste. Trust my taste buds, I am an indian and when I say it is one of the worst indian food I have ever had anywhere, I mean it. Never gonna go to this place again. Stay away or waste your money.
2020-02-08,3,Great concept and EXCELLENT service - kudos to the people serving here they are truly putting in attentive effort, taking away stars purely for taste. Good things first 1. Rice - cooked to perfection, nice and fluffy 2. Naan - yummy and tasty Now what's missing..!!?? 3. Flavors - the entrees tikka masala, butter masala and Kadai options lack flavor, this could be because the protein (chicken/paneer) cooked in these bases need couple mins longer cooking time to absorb the strong Indian masala, which taste raw.. trick is also to cook without letting the protein get tough n taste bad! 4. Veggies - similar problem, the masala tastes raw, need tad longer cooking time for masala/base before mixing veggies. Also salt proportion could be better! That said great concept, haven't tried the chats n snacks ll be back to try again!
2020-02-05,1,We were so excited to come here because we've heard great things about the chain, but this meal fell completely short. First of all, for a fast casual joint, this place is way too slow. I know there are growing pains for a new restaurant, but it shouldn't take over 20 minutes to make a burrito when there is literally no line in the restaurant and the food is already cooked. The staff wasn't friendly or helpful either. We ordered a chicken tikka masala burrito and the vegan thali. Definitely pricey for fast casual ($29 total).The vegan thali was just ok. I liked the daal lentils and vegan plant protein. I typically love aloo gobi but the potatoes tasted like a stale potato hash with some Indian spices. The rice was completely bland and the naan tasted like soggy pita bread (I asked for whole wheat but they didn't have any left).The burrito was decent but the chicken tikka wasn't creamy at all and definitely not worth the price.I wanted to love this place but there are so many better fast casual options in Hoboken and better Indian food as well (i.e. Karma Kafe).
2020-02-04,5,Have ordered lamb kheema bowl and it's  absolutely delicious and mouthwatering. Wanna try more !!!
2020-01-29,5,Great first experience here! The place is brand new and they've had a soft opening for the last couple days so they are understandably still working out some service kinks but all of the employees were very kind and eager to help. The Chicken Tikka Masala burrito was  quite good and I am eager to try other items in the future. The Franchisee was there and he was quite nice as well. High hopes for this place
2020-01-28,5,So excited that this San Francisco Valencia Street transplant has come to Hoboken!! What a welcome addition! They had a soft opening the past couple weeks and officially opened yesterday. Congrats!I had forgotten to eat all day and it was 530pm and I was quite hungry. Enthusiastic to support a new, local business and also to check out their food, I was thrilled to see so many vegetarian items on their very large and creative menu.I ordered the 'Punjabi by Nature' bowl with saag paneer and tika masala with paneer (instead of chicken). This comes with a generous portion of delicious tumeric and fenugreek basmati rice, with a side of daal and cucumber salad. It was absolutely delicious and not greasy. I devoured it and brought home a samosa and mango lassi. The samosa was noted by my husband to have a crispy and bready, lighter crust with well-spiced peas and potato filling and also was not greasy. I will definitely be back. There are many vegan and gluten free options. The menu includes Indian street food, burritos, fusion Indian poutine, rice bowls, desserts, drinks and more. The staff were so kind, helpful, and attentive.  Thank you for such a memorable dining experience!!
2020-01-28,1,This review is really disappointing to write because I was really excited about this place openning up on Hoboken. Pretty expensive for really small portion sizes and watery curry. What bothers me the most is that they are inconsistently closed without notice or posting. If you call in advance to check if they are open, the staff in the phone is really rude.  For the occasions that I went and they were closed, their social media and yelp indicated that they were operating normal hours, but when I got there, they posted a flyer on their door that they were closed for training.  I just walked over to karma because it's always delicious and reliable.
2020-01-27,4,We stumbled upon Curry Up Now on 01/24. The place is pretty small and they were not fully open.  We ordered naughty naan, vegan plant protein kati roll and panner kati roll. Vegan roll was not yet ready and hence had to be replaced with Aloo Gobi roll (after confirming with us). Naughty naan was our favorite. Aloo Gobi was good but panner roll fell short. It was not seasoned well. But we will sure return to try rest of the items on the menu. Hoping that when they are full open, they maintain the consistency.
2020-01-25,4,Great food & amazing customer service! We are stopped by on a Friday evening and it was crowded! They are new so I can imagine some orders can take me time. Anyways I was in no rush and enjoyed waiting there - waiting staff and manager seemed eager to help everyone and pleasant. Food in itself was great, good portion size and presentation above average. Hot chai could definitely be better (well I could always get a job as a chai critique)
2020-01-24,2,Sorry, but first and last time.My office sent 2 people to order food for 15-20 people... and it took 90 min for you to make it!They ran out of rice.... This is an Indian fast food restaurant. How can you run out of rice?Your food is amazing, but fix your internal bottle necks before opening up to the public.
2020-01-20,5,Really nice place. Food is great, and has a nice casual atmosphere.  Lots of good options for vegetarians, and vegans too if that is a concern. Perfect for a lunch break. Nice to have a good quick option for Indian food in the area.
2020-01-18,5,So happy this place came to Hoboken! I tried the American Punjabi Thali, everything in the platter was tasty, from the butter chicken, to the Dahl, aloo gobi, the rice and the naan- just the right portions of everything too, I was stuffed. The mango lassi was great too. I can't wait to try their Chai. Super fast service and extremely friendly and welcoming staff.
2020-01-18,4,This spot is a local chain in California and made its way to the greater NYC area! After hearing about it so much from friends and family, I needed to see what the hype was about. This spot has a modern twist on several aspects of Indian food. There are street food options, bowls, burritos, thalis, samosas and more! The service is really nice too and very engaging. The owner was really welcoming. I went with my roommate and we got the naughty naan pizza, chicken tikka masala burrito, and the kapoor and sons thali. The naughty naan pizza was good, it had jalapeños, chicken tikka with gravy and cheese along with caramelized onions. Personally I'm not a fan of caramelized onions with spicy food but the rest of the pizza was really good. The chicken tikka masala burrito was good too. A lot of the burrito was just rice though but one you get to the chicken and it's sauce, it's tasty. The burrito has cholay (chickpeas) too. Lastly, the kapoor and sons thali was really good! The kadhai chicken hits the spot. It comes with a bunch of peppers which really bring out the delicious and spicy taste. The saag paneer was good, the saag was good  but the paneer could've been softer. The thali comes with papad, daal, and rice too. Overall, I'm really happy with my experience here. There are so many other items on the menu I want to try, especially the street food so I will definitely be back!
2020-01-13,5,My coworker and I stumbled in here during lunch today. They're not quite open yet - soft opening on Friday - but the staff was incredibly welcoming and nice. They asked if we'd like to try something, and we were given massive meals. I'm still stuffed 2 hours later. We tried to pay, and they wouldn't accept anything!The food was delicious, and I'm not normally a huge fan of Indian food.  We had naan, chutey, Tikka masala - all the regulars and then some.  They have a wide selection of vegetarian items too, and I'm actually excited to go back when they are officially open!
