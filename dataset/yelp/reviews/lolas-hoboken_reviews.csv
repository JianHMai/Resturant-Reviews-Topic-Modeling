2021-09-16,5,I usually visit Lola's when my friends and I visit Hoboken. Great restaurant great food!!! Great Bartender Christian... would you believe because of COVID we had not been there for 2 years and he remembered us from 2 years prior. Amazing.We usually hang at the bar and get a bunch of appetizers. The grilled octopus is 1 of our favorites. We also had avocado lobster rolls which were a special they were delicious. Will the definitely be back soon.
2021-08-13,2,I was so disappointed after coming here. Service is absolutely horrible- not to mention the rude server.  He basically told me to shut up so he can continue to read the Daily specials. As for the food, we ordered crab cakes, grilled octopus, and and garlic shrimp. Again a total disappointment.  The octopus was fried instead of grilled, the shrimp was over cooked and lacked flavor.  The crab cakes were just not good.
2021-07-31,1,Everything started off well; the appetizers were fine. We ordered our entrees, and we're waiting for more than an hour; I extended my parking twice for 45 minutes on top of the initial 2hrs. We see every other table that came after us get their food, ours nowhere in sight. It turns out they gave our food to another table. At that point, we had to leave. I would've understood if the restaurant was at peak serving time, but it was relatively early and empty when we ordered. The only way they thought to rectify that error was to give a free shot instead of apologizing. Never coming back.
2021-07-29,5,I love this place. Food and atmosphere are excellent. However, there are not enough Tapas on the menu. The first time I went, my husband and I ordered 2 dishes we expected to be small plates. However, they came back with two entrees complete with sides. Now we know how to order. If you like authentic Spanish food, I think this is a great place. If you're looking for small plates to share with the table, you might not find too many options. However, I still give them 5 star's.
2021-06-16,5,Always awesome. Owner is great.  He's there every night. Takes pride and care for every customer. He managed to survive the Covid shut downs. This is epitome of small business that deserves your support.Food is good and prices are honest. Highly recommend. Please go and support.
2021-06-15,3,In Lola's defense, I did visit here after returning from Barcelona so my expectations were higher than they should have been. The decor is cute, and they have a gorgeous fountain in the center of the restaurant. The food here is okay. Nothing special, nothing terrible, just okay. It's very heavy on meats, cheeses, and seafood which is to be expected for a tapas spanish restaurant, but if you want ANY vegetables or salads, you are in the wrong place. It's a great location near Pier13 if you're leaving after a few bevs, but if you come here sober you'll be disappointed in the food.
2021-05-23,4,Had a great dinner here the other night. They were packed outdoors and still busy indoors. The food was good, some items better than others, definitely get the cheese and meat plates. Our other favorite item was the mussels in the salsa verde. White Peach Sangria was delicious. A little expensive but great for a night out where you want to try a bit of everything.
2021-05-20,1,We have heard good comments about this restaurant, BUT we were disappointed about their service and their food. We almost waited half hour to have the waiter come place our order, and other 45min to get food. The grilled octopus was ok, but over priced, $17 just for one octopus limb. The paella with lobster, not recommended. It was too salty.
2021-05-15,2,Today I celebrated my friend's 40th birthday party and although the food was amazing, the service was absolutely horrible. It took 40 minutes to get a menu, and it took about 90 minutes to get the food. The food was absolutely delicious, but it also took them an extended amount of time to get our drinks. We had to ask for the bill, And after the bill was received, it was not computerized but handwritten, and the gratuity was not accurate. It was a large party, and the bill was split into two, but the gratuity was incorrectly placed on one bill. The server came out and charged The cards quickly, and charges incorrectly. We asked the owner to Verify what happens with the bill and he told us that it was out of his hands and we had to deal with it with the server. Our reservation was made at 7 PM and we left at almost 11 PM. It is sad that this Restaurant has been around for quite some time and I frequented the establishment with longtime residents and the service was bad. I love to support local businesses, but I do not tolerate horrible service.
2021-05-10,2,We have heard great comments about this restaurant so we were definitely shocked by the service we received this past weekend. We never really had one specific waiter; at least 3-4 of them came to our table throughout our stay. It was a little unorganized to say the least. The tables are also very close to each other. Our reservation was for 1pm and we did not get our food until 2:22pm. The lobster tails and steak were both overcooked (my medium steak was more like medium well), and the steak was almost cold. It took so long for us to get our food that I was expecting it to at least be hot. It's a shame because the steak tasted really good, it would've been even better if it wasn't cold. The sangria was also just okay, very weak. Definitely did not live up to the hype.
2021-04-08,5,OMG !!! OMG !!! OMG !!! I just left this place and I can't wait to go back ... absolutely AMAZING !!!Let me start with the warm welcome you get when you walk in , very few places offer that anymore now a days ..The decor : absolutely amazing , you feel like you're certainly in Spain .. beautiful decor ..The drinks : we had Mojitos and Mango Sangria , that was the most refreshing drink I've had in a long time . The food : monkfish was cooked to perfection and the sauce was amazing .The clams in garlic sauce were also so good , but the most amazing thing we tried was the chorizo in red wine sauce , that was simply so so soooo good . The food  presentation was great and everything was served fresh !!The whole experience was GREAT!! Thank you so so much to the amazing staff as Lola's for being efficient and professional all while serving great drinks and food .. five stars all across the board . Can't wait to go back !! Honestly if I could I'd give 10 stars to this place . Make a reservation tho cause they are super busy , but trust me it's worth it in more ways than one .
2021-03-22,5,Attentive service. I also had the "Ravioli de Langosta en Salsa de Vodka", it was delicious. Great pricing will be going back very soon!
2021-02-21,3,Food good.  Atmosphere on a Saturday was also upbeat.   Value is not great as plates are small at the price, but it's fun.  Trouble is that this place is COVID IRRESPONSIBLE.  They are serving at full capacity.   There wasn't an empty seat in the place, and tables were close together with no shields.   They are operating normally.   even the owner/ manager walks around with his mask half off and he pulls it down to talk to staff and customers.  Not cool.
2020-10-20,5,This place is a landmark , so glad to see it is still going during the pandemic .  Amazing food and great atmosphere. Andre  and his team always make you feel like family . If you are ever in Hoboken NJ make sure to stop by and enjoy authentic Spanish food done right.
2020-10-01,5,For an appetizer I had the "Salteado a la Lola's (spicy filet mignon tips sauteed in peppers and onions)."  Thank me later!
2020-10-01,5,I've been coming here for years and am long overdue for this review.... I've had many memorable nights at Lola's (birthdays, dinners, graduations, you name it) and every time has been a delight! So happy they've made it though these hard times as it is one of the shining gems of Hoboken. And the sangria!!!
2020-09-06,3,Tables are close together. Weak, bitter sangria. (Red & White). Delicious food. But the worst part-- the owner sits in the dining area smoking and drinking all hours of the day. No respect and gross.
2020-08-03,1,This is definitely not authentic Spanish food in any regard. Thought to try some basics shrimp camarones tasted like the restaurant swapped kitchens with one of the many Hoboken Italian restaurants. Service during quarantine is also a disaster- tables are not socially distant and staff is busy people watching then seating patronsWill never be back
2020-07-19,5,A hidden gem.  My boyfriend and I happen to be in Hoboken and we see a sign that reads sangria so we stopped in for sangria and an appetizer.  Omg one of the best choices we made ! As an appetizer we had the churasco in a garlic sauce with portabello mushrooms.  So tasty and delicious.  Service was great as well.  Can't wait to go back !
2020-07-03,5,I've been coming to Lola's for over 10 years. They're food and drinks are consistently delicious, the vibe is great, the people are spectacular. This place is a Hoboken gem. Best Spanish tapas I've had.My absolute favorite dishes here are the following:-Stuffed seafood avocado -Goat cheese pitas-Crab legs in brandy sauce -Skirt steak with portobello mushrooms -Potatatas bravas-Shrimp Ajillo in garlic sauce -Scallops wrapped in bacon in a raspberry sauce So muchmore good dishes honestly. I'm salivating thinking about it. Their Monkfish tastes like lobster. You won't be disappointed!
2020-06-17,5,I came here for dinner with my friends right before lock down. I did keep joking that sharing plates as a pandemic was looming over our heads was maybe a bad idea. But once we got here, joking all aside: thank you for one last amazing night before lock down!!! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.The staff was beyond amazing and they even offered to provide us a few tapas on the house. The pulpo gallego here is out of this world and definitely hit the spot. The seafood mariscada was just as good. Every dish that came out was right on point. We didn't have a single dish we didn't polish off. The martinis I had definitely were strong - thank you. My friends raved about their cocktails as well including the sangria.Wish I were closer, I'd be taking this to go everyday during lockdown!
2020-02-23,5,I love Lola's. I am in love with Tapas since I was in Spain when I was a teenager and I found the real of them in this restaurant! It's my to-go place when I am in Hoboken. I also loved their sangria. The bartenders are always so nice!
2020-02-14,5,Excellent service! Loved the tapas, their extended happy hour and their drinks!!! Great ambiance for families,  big groups and great bar for a date night.
2020-02-07,4,Great spot for tapas, sangria and a low key night. They have happy hour Mon-Thur til 11pm and have a long list of tapas on the happy hour menu.The sangria was good but not strong. I tried the ham croquettes, shrimp and garlic and the Spanish potatoes. All were very good.Entree had the "volcano" which came with 4 filet medallions. Very good and nice presentation. They gave us free shots at the end of the meal which was a nice touch. I'd come back for happy hour again and just sit at the bar. FYI only metered street parking!
2020-01-01,5,Great place for seafood. Love the grilled octopus and anything with the basque style. Will definitely come back again.
2019-12-08,5,Had a surprised 30th birthday party here last night. I couldn't have asked for a more perfect night. The food was delicious and the staff was amazing. It was $70 for 3 hours of unlimited sangria and wine and food was served family style. There was never an empty pitcher on the table and there was SO MUCH food. HIGHLY RECOMMEND
2019-11-22,5,I have no clue how this place has 3.5 stars. Has been my go to since I moved to Hoboken and I love it here! They have an amazing happy hour with both food and drink specials. The service is amazing and the bartenders are super friendly (especially Eddie!) must try the garlic shrimp, the mushrooms, the cheesey filet tips, and the cheese board is delicious and so affordable. Can't believe they only have 3.5 stars ?!?!
2019-09-19,5,Amaxing for a large group! The family style menu has so much to offer and is so affordable.  Had a group of 17 girls here for a bachlorette party.  Never would have expected such smooth service and incredible food.  Will defiantly be back!
2019-09-18,5,Been going for two decades , great date spot and the workers are very friendly. So many tapas available that I always get something different and it never disappoints !Recommend the sangria and volcano steak !
2019-08-30,5,TOTAL Hidden Gem - everything I have tried is spectacular I like to get the meals for 2 ppl that come out on a clay roof tile.They are SUPER accommodating and what a cool insideFree Parking - what else do you look for!?!?!
2019-07-20,1,We walked into this bar that was half empty with only white people and I walked in with my three other non white friends and got asked to leave. The guy who told us to leave said it was because we drank too much but we hadn't drank at all. Complete disgrace. Would never recommend.
2019-07-14,1,Terrible quality of food. Sangria was watered down with extremely soggy and spoiled fruit apples. We order the croquetas and patatas bravas. They tasted like frozen food. The salpicon was drenched in vinegar. The rest of the dishes were just ok. Definitely not worth the steep $101 for two! Sadly I won't EVER go to this place again.
2019-07-05,4,This is one of the cutest feels like home restaurants i've ever been to. I ordered pica pollo which is one of the reason why i did not give it a 5 star, It had no real Dominican taste to it. But it was not bad. We ordered Lemonade which was Delicious. Reminded me of being in the Isla. The fish was delicious was tasteful. The salad was also good. The mojo with yuca was good but the mojo need that Cuban flavor, it just tasted like butter and not ajo. The bistec encebollado was AMAZING! Perfectly cooked with the onions, so tasteful. The mofogo, is the other reason why not the 5 star. The mofogo was not to good. The chicharron did not taste like a Dominican/PuertoRican makes it, nice and crunchy and it was not inside the mofogo like its typically suppose to be. Other wise, I loved it, beautiful place, good was good and the server was very nice and pleasant!!!
2019-05-27,5,Tapas are always a great idea for my boyfriend and I, as we love to order a bunch of different things and share everything! We are new to the area and have had our eyes on Lola's for awhile, but have been waiting to try it until the weather was nice.  This weekend, we decided to give it a try! The staff is very friendly, and they sat us at a really nice and intimate table close to the open air of the patio.  Despite it raining on and off, it was a fantastic location. Our servers were attentive, and provided recommendations when we requested them.  I highly recommend a bottle of their sauvignon blanc - even my boyfriend happily drank it, and I usually have to twist his arm to get him to share a bottle of wino with me! We had the avocado appetizer, which was an avocado stuffed with crab meat.  It was incredible, not too "mayo-y" or salty.  You could taste the freshness.  We then went with the server's recommendation of bacon wrapped scallops, and also ordered the mussels in green sauce and crab stuffed clams.  All were very good.  To finish, I got the creme brule and my boyfriend got the cheesecake.  we were very pleased! to top it off, the server gave us complimentary dessert shots.  At the end of the meal, we were shocked at how low our bill was! If you are looking for a fun, flavorful dining experience, come here.  We will definitely be back.
2019-05-22,2,Came yesterday for dinner with my friends. The service was ok but food was really bad. My friend ordered clams in raspberry sauce. it was overcooked and felt like eating rubber. My shrimps were ok but cheese on top of them was rubbery,too. Also I ordered two glasses of pino noir and they were completely different. The second glass was disgusting.
2019-05-12,4,Tapas are one of my favorite restaurant experiences because of how many flavors and dishes you can try on your night out, but sadly short of going into Manhattan there aren't a bunch of options in the Jersey City-Hoboken area. That's where Lola's comes in. The restaurant captures perfectly what it means to be a Spanish Taps restaurant, offering small plates at a fair price with a ton of flavor. Additionally, their wines by the glass were affordable. The only thing that stopped Lola's from being 5 stars was the slow service. All of the wait staff was friendly and helpful, but we arrive at 9 pm on a Saturday and didn't leave till 11:20, so leave time to wait.
2019-04-30,1,My favorite parts of the meal were the bread and cheese at the beginning, and then when we left at the end.My BF and I had been wanting to try this spot out for a while. We always passed by it and saw that they had HH drinks/tapas til 11 at the bar, M-F. We came in on a Monday at around 8:30 and the place was pretty empty. Maybe because it was a Monday? But I don't think I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, because the food was pretty terrible so I think that was the reason. It was like they just pulled in anybody who was available for the night, put them in the kitchen, and said "hey, whatever you think this tapas dish is, make your interpretation of it with whatever we have in the kitchen.Here is everything we had:Chicken wings - these were smothered in some kind of sauce. It tasted like AYCE wings that you'd get from a Hoboken bar. Not really sure what we were thinking when we decided to order this.Lomo embuchado - so we didn't know what this was and they told us it was thinly sliced pork. But I just Googled it and it's actually dry-cured pork loin. What we got was a thin, and dry piece of salty pork. Not exactly the same as dry-cured.Croquetas - pretty basic. These are definitely refried again and again, if they can't sell them allMeatballs - salty and drySeafood salad - we were told that this was ceviche but in actuality, it was just boiled shrimp and squid, covered in an old salsaShrimp ajillo - this was the only thing that was actually not bad. But it's not enough to make me want to come backDrinks were no better. I had a cosmo and BF had a mojito and both were straight sugar.Maybe the regular, non-happy hour hour menu is better? (doubtful) Try the "tapas" at your own risk.
2019-04-25,5,This place is fantastic. So many good things. First of all, they validate parking garage parking for up to 2 hours - the Bloomfield street parking garage that is one block away. Next the service, all the waiters are SO attentive, kinda, and patient. Amazing service. Third, the food is so good. We ordered soups, a variety of tapas, and desert. Everything was wonderful. Each tapa was unique and thoughtfully prepared. Lastly, the little touches like a free on the house tapa and a free aperitif shot at the end were so hospitable. Highly recommend the lobster ravioli, churrasco with portabellas, sopa gallego, and the mango sangria!
2019-04-15,5,So my husband and I wanted to get something cute and simple done on our wedding day since it was just 10 of us. I have been going to Lola's since I was 5 and I thought they could make it happen, well they did!!! They offered us a Family style menu and OMG THEY EXCEEDED OUR EXPECTATIONS!! From the service to the food to the drinks it was to die for, I am 100% sure I wouldn't have gotten anything better anywhere else!! They were AMAZING and made our night one to remember forever! Thank you so much guys!!!
2019-03-26,5,I can't believe I never left a comment after my amazing experience! I booked Lola's for a family style pre fixed dinner to celebrate my birthday. I had 18 guests and it had been the first time the majority of us had been there.Can I just say that you a 5 course mealWith unlimited wine and sangria for 2 hours for $50. Tax and gratuity isn't included but they gave me an amazing deal and my friends loved it! I'm def coming back and Chris is the man! He was helpful, attentive and always willing to help!Thank you for a wonderful biet
2019-03-19,5,This place never stops impressing me. After years of being in business they keep the menu and the tablecloths fresh and clean.  The staff seem too also enjoy working there as most are still there since years of going there.
2019-03-09,5,An absolutely incredible experience from start to finish! We were able to secure a Saturday night 8pm reservation with no issues at all. The ambiance of the restaurant is very intimate but bigger than what you would expect on the outside which was a lovely surprise. The wait staff was pleasant and prompt and very accommodating. The food was beyond delicious. We got the lobster stuffed avocado, clams in green sauce (make sure to get extra bread to dunk into the sauce because it was absolutely incredible), the paella, steak tips and garlic shrimp. Not a single complaint everything was cooked to perfection and was delicious. I can't wait to come back again and try more of this menu! Thank you Lola's for a wonderful dining experience!
2019-02-20,4,Excellent spot for good tapas and great wineHad the mushrooms, mussels. Cheese plate all where very good
2019-02-17,5,Such an underrated spot in Hoboken! Perfect tapas bar, great menu, great ambiance and friendly stafff! Food is amazing and you'll definitely leave satisfied. If you're thinking of trying Lola's you won't be disappointed!
2019-02-17,5,Love this place!! Amazing food and ambience! Staff is super friendly and helpful! The churros are a must!
2019-01-15,4,Not a bad spot. Came here late night with friends and got a couple tapas to share. Must try blue cheese with fladgate 10 or 20. Such a great random pairing. The bartender was also really friendly! Will definitely come back.
2019-01-04,5,A great spot in uptown Hoboken. Came for dinner on a Friday night and sat with ease. The wait staff was very friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable of the menu. We ordered the crab and shrimp stuffed avocado, lobster ravioli in vodka sauce, and fried calamari (highly recommend the first two). They have a short dink menu, but an extensive wine list if you ask for it. While we didn't order dessert, our waiter brought over a couple of complementary dessert shots which were very tasty. We will definitely be back!
2018-12-10,5,Food - 4.5Service - 5Atmosphere- 5Very professional, attentive staff.  Couldn't say enough good things about them.The food here is delicious... some notable dishes include the paella, the chorizo, the penne al a vodka.  Even the bread is memorable. The only areas for improvement could've been not overcooking the shrimp in the paella. The atmosphere is adorable and great for date nights.  I will definitely be back!
2018-11-10,5,I went here for dinner with my husband. Delicious food and excellent service. I will definitely come back.
2018-11-04,5,Amazing service ! Beautiful ambiance you feel like your in a villa or streets in spain ! Its literally set up to look like your outside . The lights are low but not too low just right for a romantic date . It was my first time there with my husband & baby we had a cheese plate & a charcuterie board with red wine . the wine was amazing & so were the tapas . We are def coming back for a date night . The staff made us feel very warm & welcomed like we knew them . Even the manager greeted us and ask how we were doing . Cant wait to go back its going to be our new date night spot !
2018-09-09,5,We're Cuban so we wanted some good Spanish food. We got the paella, chorizos and croquetas. We loved every second of it. Ended the night with espressos. Highly recommend
2018-07-28,5,Very good food tables nicely situated with prompt service and attention. Atmosphere is old puerto Spain plus. Scallops and bacon to die for, grilled skirt steak with mush/onions 2 thumbs up. Garlic shrimp was very good.  A bit pricey but a nice night out.
2018-07-15,5,Food is awesome, flavorful and the service is great ! Friendly staff and very accommodating . Love the music and atmosphere . The private room downstairs is awesome for a dinner party .  From tapas to main course the menu has a wonderful variety from seafood poultry & meats . Desserts with after dinner cocktail just takes it over the top !! Highly recommended
2018-07-04,5,This is my favorite restaurant in Hoboken. The food is amazing, but more than that I love the people who work here. They are always sweet, they check on us regularly and the water glass is never empty.As far as food, these are some of my favorite tapas:* Skirt steak with mushrooms* Spanish omelet * pork loinTheir sangria is to die for, especially their mango sangria. I will come back here again very soon.
2018-07-01,5,One of the best tapas places ive been to in a long time. You can taste all the freshness in all the meals. At Lola's you can get anything from potatoes to churasco to a full bar. The staff is very attentive and friendly. I will definitely be going back West New York to visit Lola's.
2018-06-21,2,The service is very bad, its thursday so the kitchen supposed to close at 11pm, i came in at 10pm and they were rushing me to order cause the kitchen was about to close.. The food was ok and at the beginning we got old and hard bread i asked them to change it and the waiter told me ''its the only one we have cause the kitchen its closing'' wtf i paid for that... So thats my history... Never coming back to this place.
2018-05-22,5,We just had our wedding reception at Lola's and I cannot say enough about how perfect the wedding was! Andre, Christian, and the wait staff went out of their way to make sure the entire event was perfect. They worked with all of our requests and even offered to decorate for us the night before! The food was wonderful and the service was impeccable. I highly recommend Lola's for an event!
2018-05-16,5,Great selection and high quality of tapas!!  We've ever had a bad meal or experience here!  Salads & sangria are excellent too!
2018-04-26,3,Came here for a night cap with one of my girls and it was exactly what we needed to end out night.The ambiance was pretty chill and they had good music playing in the background without it being obnoxiously loud where we couldn't hear each other.  We ordered some mojitos and they were okay. They have a cute outside area which was already closed by the time we got there but the inside had a nice homey Spanish style feel to it and it appears they do private events downstairs.Our waiter was also pretty awesome and wished I remembered his name because we truly bonded with him lol  Will go back to check out their food for sure and hopefully update this review :)
2018-03-25,5,What can I say! I just had my 30th birthday in the wine cellar at Lola's and was blown away with the space and the accommodations!! The food was unbelievable and the staff went out of their way to make sure that the night was flawless! I have never had a bad meal or a bad time here and would give it 10 stars if I could! Thank you to Christian and the other staff for making my party dreams come true!
2018-01-20,5,My husband and I and another couple stumbled across Lola's on Friday night. Beautiful interior, we had a round of drinks, and shared tapas. Every single thing we ate was delicious (especially loved the filet!) and the service was really great! We were so happy to have found Lola's and will definitely be back!
2017-11-10,5,This is my absolute favorite place to come eat some clams ! I love how cute this place is! Great service! I try to come here every other weekend  ! Highly recommend this place to any couple who wants to go on a date or meet up with a friend ! Super cute !!!!! And I am a tough critic but I give this place a thumbs up!!
2017-09-26,5,This is a wonderful restaurant with a beautiful ambience and attentive staff. The menu can be a bit overwhelming on your first visit, but you cannot go wrong with any of their dishes. They are each presented beautifully, and the combination of flavors created by the chef are magnificent. The cocktails and sangrias are equally impressive.
2017-09-26,5,This is my favorite Tapa's restaurant in all of Hoboken.  I have visited about 4-5 times and each time has been fantastic. The food is authentic and delicious. The offer a great happy hour every night with an extra discount on the Tapas.  And you can't forget about the Sangria!!! They have a list of different house made sangrias.  The service is always wonderful and very attentive.  The decor is beautiful.  It feels like you just walked into the Spanish countryside.  I can't say enough good things about this establishment.  WELL DONE!
2017-09-22,5,I enjoyed eating here, the food was good especially the tapas menu items. The avacado lobster was so delicious. The drinks were perfect, the deserts were delicious. Didn't enjoy the paella as much as i did the other food it was a little salty. The live music was wonderful and set the mood. Overall a good experience I will be back.
2017-09-19,1,Wish I could give 0 stars. Disgusting. 2017 and my friends got discriminated against because they are part of the LGBT community. Absolutely disgusting. Will NEVER give someone who discriminates against someone my business ever. I hope the owner is ashamed.
2017-09-18,1,If there was a way to give this restaurant 0 stars, I would have gladly given it that. My experience at Lola's was embarrassing and horrific. My girlfriend and I went out for a night in Hoboken and stumbled across Lola's. We decided to give it a shot.  We sat at the bar. Keep in mind, there was only one other table besides us in the restaurant. My girlfriend leaned in for a kiss and put her hand on my lap. Moments after, we were disrespectfully screamed by the owner. He said that we needed to stop this "behavior" because there are other tables in the restaurant who feel uncomfortable.  It was clear that his intentions were discriminatory. It was embarrassing as we felt judged by everyone in the restaurant. All eyes were on us. Not something I would expect in Hoboken in 2017. They will no longer be receiving our business.
2017-09-08,2,The White Sangria and decor was very nice. We had 5 Tapas dishes and the steak was good. Had much better octopus and shrimp dishes. Same with pork. We know others who had better luck.
2017-07-25,5,Nice, friendly place with delicious food and drinks! I loved service and complementary little things they give you before you order and after you're done with your food! Awesome!
2017-07-23,2,Came to Lola's several times when it first opened but that was years ago now.  Was in the mood for Tapas and it's close to home so was time for a revisit.  First off, it's cute inside.  Definitely can be a date place and roomy enough for a group of friends.   The downstairs area is also good for a group or can host a private party.   Now if only the food and service were as good.  In fairness, the bus boys were good but the waiter was really bad and the food not much better.   -clams were nice and plump.  In butter sauce so hard to go wrong there. -raxo (Pork loin w fig) was ok. Not bad but nothing special-squid w blank ink rice is one of my favorite dishes but was just ok here.  -octopus was rubbery and the sauce that came with it wasn't very good. Also not a good value at $16.  Essentially, everything was passable but nothing memorable.   There wasn't a single dish that I was like damn, we have to come back here for that.    Throw in the mediocre sangria and service and the prices being a coupe of bucks more than it should per tapa, and this isn't a recipe for a repeat visit.  On the plus side, I did see a sign of they have happy hour M-R till 11pm.  Hard to argue w HH till 11pm, even a mediocre one.
2017-07-12,4,Cozy and glowing with charm!  Lola delights on tapa dishes and ambiance!  Barrels are used as the tables and it adds a unique style to dining.I was craving Paellas and opted for their Seafood Paella!  The flavor of the seafood and Spanish rice being well cooked, was comfort to the soul and hit the spot on my Paella level! We ordered up other tapas like the sausage and grilled pulpo!  I like the perfect crunch to my grilled pulpo as it was nicely drizzled with oil and dressing! Sausage plate was okay - noting, a typical fajita with grilled bell peppers in the mix.I like how they offered amuse bouche in the beginning.  It warmed up my liking to the whole experience.
2017-07-10,5,This place is my favorite tapas spot! I have been here many times and every time it's amazing. The avocado stuffed with lobster meat and shrimp is the best. Anything here is great and I love the ambiance! Definitely recommend!
2017-06-17,5,The food here was exquisite.  Tapas menu is perfect and the wine selection is on point.   The avocado salad with crap and shrimp is to die for and the angel hair pasta with shrimp is seasoned to perfection.  The cappuccino is served in a wine glass and perfect for sipping on their little outdoor area.  They also had live entertainment which was pretty loud indoors, but sitting outside was a perfect option.Definitely recommend and Israel or Izzy for short was amazing on the service!!!
2017-06-11,4,We stumbled on Lola's after today's Hoboken Arts and Music Festival to get out of the heat. Our table of five was seated quickly and the staff could not have been nicer. Sensing we were hot they brought over water immediately. We got a pitcher of white sanrgia it was very tasty. If you closed your eyes you would swear you were in Spain. The decor transported me right back to Madrid. We did not just have one waiter we had two. They kept the water and bread basket full.  We were also served a garlic potato amuse bouche. We tried a few different dishes, Chicken, Beef, Tortilla espanola, Avocado stuffed with crab and lobster and another potato dish. All was great to share and the right amount of food after the festival. One of the older waiters was a real jokester. A taller distinguished gentleman I assume the owner came over to see if we enjoyed our meal. At the end of the meal they brought us some tasty shots with whiskey, cinnamon and milk. Still not sure what I had but it was very good. the restaurant started to get full as we were leaving. I believe this is a hidden gem in the Hoboken dining scene. I would definitely go back.
2017-05-09,5,Lolas is one of our favorite spots. The mussels are amazing!!! They have great tapas specials. Staff is always friendly.
2017-04-29,1,Terrible service, if I could give zero stars I would. Wish Hoboken had decent restaurants
2017-04-09,3,My second return to Lola's wasn't as satisfying as my first. Deciding to have a night out with the girls at Lola's quickly turned into "hurry up and get the bill" type of situation. The pitcher of sangria ($30) was so watery. You could not taste anything close to what a sangria should taste like. In fact we ordered the red and it looked pink. Very disappointing. For my dish I asked if I could have the Paella Valencia and if they could substitute the sausage for chicken as previously done. My waiter quickly said no that it couldn't be done. Even after I explained and showed pictures how they kindly made the change for me on my previous visit. The answer was still no. Lola's was supposed to be an evening of great sangria and a taste of food from Spain but in the end all that was given was weak sangria, ok food, and not the greatest service.
2017-04-06,4,This place is such a anomaly in Hoboken.  Inside, it feels like you are no longer in Hoboken.  I liked the decor.  It is old Spanish style, but I hated the tables.  They have barrels for the stands which means it is very big.  It is not the most comfortable to find a place to put your legs.  I guess it does add the to atmosphere. The service was great.  It seemed like we didn't have one waiter, but everyone just helped out.  I think it is a great system.  If they see something in need, they helped out.  They kept the water filled and bread in the basket.The food was really good.  All the seafood dishes we had were great.  The shrimps and the fish dishes were the best.  I would just stick to seafood there.  If you get a steak dish, stick to the skirt steaks.  They were seasoned very well and were tasty.  The filet mignons were meh.The food is tapas which I believe is difficult for Americans.  I do think this place is expensive.  We had 7 tapas for 4 people and it wasn't quite enough.  We were satisfied, but not full.  I try not to eat like an American, but it is hard.  If you are a big eater and starving, do not come here.  If you want a different experience from most of the Hoboken restaurants, then come and try it out.  The food and service was great and I would definitely recommend coming here.
2017-01-28,5,It's really not as expensive as you might think. And you get everything you pay for. Great service and quality food and cocktails. And the decor inside is perfect for a date night because it's so romantic inside along with the Spanish music playing in the background
2016-12-26,3,Came here with a friend for dinner as we both were not hungry and just wanted some small things. The place was quite empty that night maybe because it was during the week. We got half pitch of margaritas which was just ok, felt a bit light. The tapas were quite large in size. I think between the 2 of us, both girls, 3 would've been more than enough. Food was good but not unforgettable. I wish the tapas could be smaller so we can try a bit more variety, which was why we came here...
2016-11-27,5,This place is one of Hoboken's hidden gems for happy hour. When you sit at the bar (or bar area tables), you are always taken care of with complimentary bread, olives, and delicious fried potatoes. Their happy hour margaritas are great, and their bar tapas are simply excellent and reasonably priced for the quality and portions. I can't speak for the dinner as we've never tried, but I would expect the food to be just as great as the tapas are. Happy to say that this is one of our new regular weeknight spots. Im also surprised to hear about any lack of service as our waiters and servers have always been very friendly and super attentive.
2016-11-23,5,My boyfriend and I kind of fell into this place a couple weeks ago when it was the first freezing cold night and we wanted to enjoy another drink near the other restaurant we were at. You step in and immediately feel like you're in another place - it has a distinct Spanish decor. We grabbed two seats at the bar (it wasn't overly crowded for a Friday night) and asked the bartender for a drink suggestion. We needed up ordering a small carafe of the mango sangria, which was AMAZING. He bartender made it right in front of us, and in total we each had 3 glasses for $19.99 - unbelievably reasonable for Hoboken drink prices. To top it off, the staff brought us complimentary tapas that were delicious! Can't wait to go back and try another flavored sangria.
2016-11-04,5,Love Lola's. Always have a great time when I am here. The food is always delicious and they have the BEST sangria.
2016-09-18,1,We are new to the neighborhood and we were wandering around on a Sunday afternoon, just checking out what is around. We walked by this place and saw that it was a wine bar, so we thought we'd stop in and have a glass of wine. We went in and asked the old man standing at the front for a wine list. He played "here you go... just kidding" with the menu for a minute (pretending to hand it to us but then pulling it back). Once we were handed the menu we noticed it was for food. We again asked if they had a wine list, when the old man said to us "do you like Italian food? You know they have good Italian food across the street". He then walked away and we were left standing there looking at each other in disbelief... did he actually just say that to us?! Over all we were disappointed, since we live in the neighborhood we definitely could have become great customers of this establishment... but unfortunately because of this very weird (and a little offensive) experience, we will not be back.
2016-09-17,5,Had the most AMAZING lunch!!! Service was impeccable, and swift. We got a few dishes with filet mignon and the meat was wonderful!  Thank you Lola's for a beautiful time.
2016-08-23,5,Lola's does tapas for real. They don't play around like some other restaurants. They have a huge selections to choose from.The food is always tasty and prepared well. The bar is a great spot to grab a sangria during HH.Not to mention they have a tapas menu for the bar area, which goes all day.Perfect date night spot. The interior of the restaurant makes you feel like your in Spain. If you like romantic Latin food add it to your Hoboken restaurant list.
2016-08-22,4,Lola's has earned 4.5 stars for their food as well as their service. We had an excellent waiter who supplied us with extra warm fresh bread. Skirt steak was perfectly cooked and flavorful as were the shrimp in garlic sauce. The only reason Lola's doesn't get a full 5 stars from me is because the sangria was just average. It was good...it was definitely not bad, but when you compared the outstanding cuisine to the sangria, it fell short.  Overall, Lola's is a good spot!
2016-07-15,4,Great spinach croquettes and sangria! Cheers to the bartender managing everyone all by himself!
2016-07-10,5,My family threw my surprise 30th birthday here! Great food, great atmosphere. The downstairs cellar is great for parties or private dinners. Will be back soon!
2016-07-07,4,Tapas, good cheap food, you know the score.  Although an appetizer sounded fancy but ended up being just roasted diced potatoes in tomato sauce (ie. fries and ketchup).  But it's a friendly crowd, service was very good.  Not as crowded as the neighboring restaurants, and a little dark/dingy.  Could use some more light to make it friendlier.  Would bring someone here for quick meal/drink.
2016-05-13,5,WHAT A GEM!!! great place in old Hoboken, best Tapas around by far.. from today on it will be one of my favorites spots.. great food great service , i love how they accommodate my 6 yo daughter...Go there you will not regret.
2016-05-11,5,Very surprised that we had our own little piece of Spain in Hoboken.  Drinks and food were great.
2016-05-08,4,We really enjoyed it!! Great food! Large portions. The service was great. I had the French Martini. I really liked it. We would definitely go back.
2016-05-04,5,Love this restaurant!! The decor is so adorable - made me totally forget I was in Hoboken - There is a beautiful fountain in the middle of the restaurant and the ambiance makes you feel that you are in a little village, my friend also told me that there is a downstairs available for bigger parties - The food was amazing!! They gave us a complimentary appetizer dish of potatoes with an amazing white cream sauce and bread - For drinks, my friends and I shared a pitcher of red sangria which was dangerously good!  For dinner, we shared the camarones al albarino which was shrimp in a wine sauce, albodigas en salsa tomato which was spanish meatballs in a red sauce, and chuletitas de cordero al romero which was lamb - everything tasted amazing! I will definitely be coming back to Lola's!!!
2016-04-20,5,Been here a few times already with my wife and the food is amazing.will definitely be coming back for the skirt steak and sangria... Amazing!
2016-03-17,5,This place has excellent authentic food from Galicia. The location itself is designed like a plaza in Spain down to the fountain and the Windows over looking the plaza. Wine list is excellent and they have an amazing flamenco performer on Thursdays.
2016-02-12,5,the mussels with tomato sauce great! also the steak with mushrooms. awesome. service was attentive. no complaints just a good meal, no wait for a table on a friday night. this place isnt trendy enough for the typical crowd. if you are looking for a low key night out this is your spot. decent wine selection - you'll get a laugh at how large the wine menu is.
2016-02-07,5,I love this place! Great Spanish wine and beer. The ambiance is the cherry on top of an awesome dinner date night. It looks like you walked right into Spain. The food is excellent every time I go.
2015-12-29,5,Went there with 3 of my friends we got the seafood tower to start. Amazing appetizer!!! We also started with the avocado stuffed with lobster and crab. For the entrees we each decided to order 2 dishes making plus 1 extra one we each decided on. To accommodate the staff sent out the food in 3 rounds with 3 plates each. The scallops and mussels with extra bread were amazing. They cleared out plates after every round and were very nice when we spilled wine due to the amount of food on the table top. The dessert menu is presented in premise form making it much easier to choose from. We each order the dessert( I preferred the chocolate mousse). All in all the experience was so amazing that after leaving this place less than an hour ago I had to give it a great review. Did not feel rushed out or any annoyance from the staff. As far as price for the amount of food and liquor we got I would say it was a heck of a deal. Highly recommend!!!!!
2015-10-28,3,I've eaten here a few times, and it's generally decent. But I must report that on my last 2 visits there seemed to be a not so pleasant aroma in the air. Maybe the big fountain or bathroom plumbing issue or cleaning liquids trying to cover it up. And the chicken I mustard sauce dish was over cooked to the point that it was almost impossible to cut or chew. Anyway, I wouldn't completely write this place off, but hopefully the management will see this review and take some action.
2015-10-26,5,Besides frequenting the restaurant, I threw my husband a surprise party in the private room at Lolas and couldn't be more pleased with the service, food and atmosphere.  We had about 35 people and the servers were on top of everything from clearing plates to refreshing the food.  The private party room also has a bar, which was perfect.  I worked with Chris to arrange the party and he was more than accomodating to our needs from the menu selection to party set up.
2015-08-30,4,The food here is always tasty, yet it's rarely busy.  The drinks, desserts, coffee all good.  The service is fine.  I recommend trying it.
2015-08-24,4,Lola's is a solid tapas joint with a pretty tasty Red Sangria mix. The place is spacious inside and boasts a cool outdoor space. Me and my fellow foodies ordered so much food that the old waiter told us we were too greedy. I enjoyed the grilled octopus, lobster ravioli, shrimp in garlic sauce, avocado and apple salad and mussels. We also ordered the filet mignon bites but they were under seasoned and a bit over cooked. All in all a good night. Nice friendly atmosphere and good portions that don't leave you hungry or holding back a huge gut.
2015-08-06,5,Place has fabulous food! Cristian is a terrific server! Ask for him! Sangrias were fabulous-not watered down at all. Paella was off the hook-try it. Perfect mix of spices rice isn't dry great flavoring.
2015-08-06,5,Our party of six showed up on a sleepy Thursday, and were immediate seated. Charming place, a few get them while you can outdoor tables and a fabulous menu. Our attentive server treated us so well, with s delicious sangria and some of the best warm rolls I've had in some time . We ordered plate after plate with none often missing the mark . The paella was terrific, the spicy potatoes amazing and do get the volcano steak , great presentation ! You can't go wrong with the meatballs or refreshing avocado stuffed with lobster and shrimp !Honestly can't understand some of these snarky negative reviews. We will be back !!!
2015-07-12,2,Unimpressive. Sangria was really sweet with little wine or alcohol. Tuna was bland. Servers didn't speak English well. Tapas came in very varied sizes from a few meatballs to an entire plate of tuna with beans and potatoes.
2015-07-12,1,Just awful. Several people recommended it, so we tried it and will never go back.Apparently they own the Puerto Spain across the street, so no need to waste more money there. So disappointed,  and we really wanted to like it.
2015-06-27,2,Lola's, Lola's, I really want to like this place, but just couldn't, they have a very good looking menu, but the food is just disappointing.....I came here about a year ago based on a friend's recommendation. At the time we ordered quite a few tapas dishes, mostly seafood. The shrimp tasted as frozen shrimp, given the price they charge and the portion of the dish, I expect the shrimp to be fresh and good quality, it was totally not the case. We left the place feeling disappointed and didn't think we'd come back again. A year later, we passed by here again and thought we'd give it a second chance, the venue itself is pretty charming and it has a few out door seating tables, so we decided to sit outdoor to try again. But once again, we didn't enjoy the food at all. This time we ordered Seafood Salad, Fresh Tuna in Tomato Source, Rib and Seafood Paella. I ordered the tuna to be rare, it came out medium, it was very chewy and salty. I only had 2 bites and couldn't eat it anymore. The seafood salad was not great, either, it felt the seafood was sitting in the source for way too long, all very soggy. Rib was kinda of ok, the paella probably was the best one out of all, but also very salty.The service was pretty good and friendly, but it really didn't make up for the taste of food.... I am really sorry Lola's, I really wanted to love you!
2015-06-12,3,3.5 stars. I loved this place - I have no idea why it was totally empty when we were here for dinner! Tapas style- we shared everything we ordered. The sangria and guac were fantastic. Definitely got a buzz from sharing the pitcher.
2015-06-11,3,Went for dinner here with friends on a Wednesday night. The cheese platter was delicious and so was the complimentary potato dish the waiter gave. Ordered a few tapas items - a "spicy" chicken that was not spicy at all and a potato dish that tasted like it had been covered in ketchup. My friend ordered a soda and asked for two refills - it wasn't until we got the bill that we found out that refills are not included. Nice decor inside. They do validate parking for a nearby garage, which is helpful. Overall, nothing spectacular or amazing in what we experienced, and I doubt I'd go back with so many other options to try in Hoboken.
2015-06-06,5,Amazing! Very nice place, good service, great price! They have the best grilled octopus I've ever had!!
2015-06-06,4,Went here for the first time and was highly impressed.  The service was great (Chris) and the place looked great. Had cheese and cold meats tapas and it was great. Great selection of sangria and drinks.  Food is plenty and not expensive at all. Coming back to try the rest soon.
2015-05-31,5,I rarely write reviews but feel compelled after the some of the less than par reviews I've read. This place is truly a hidden gem in Hoboken. We had a few friends coming into Hoboken and I wanted to try something different than our usual go-tos. I thought tapas sounded perfect for a larger group, and I was not wrong.  The setting was fantastic, and really reminded me of a modernized version of what you'd find in Madrid. The pitchers of margaritas and sangria were on point, just enough for us to have 2+ drinks each. The food was great, we got a variety of tapas (scallops wrapped in bacon with raspberry sauce, chorizo with peppers and onions, filet with Madeira sauce, calamari, seafood paella) and all was really impressive. Will certainly be back again and highly recommend to anyone looking for a very large, clean spacious restaurant (not typical for any city) with delicious food and drinks!
2015-05-20,5,Loved it! Great selection of tapas and drinks, and everything we tried was delicious. The prices seemed high for tapas until we saw that the portions were more generous than typical. Very cozy and authentic atmosphere too -- the place has character. Service was the perfect balance of being attentive yet allowing leisurely relaxation. I was shocked that we were the only dinner guests when we arrived (although, it was a Monday night). Between the charming, candlelit setting and the delectable shared tapas, this was an excellent date spot. At the same time, I'd totally come back with my family or a group of friends! Definitely will be returning.
2015-04-19,4,This is definitely a hidden gem in Hoboken. My roommate and I were strolling through Hoboken and came across this place and decided to go in. There was only one table sitting and another couple at the bar so we were a little nervous but the lack of people definitely did not have anything to do with food. We got two cocktails which were delicious and very cheap. We were brought a small complimentary appetizer and then we went with the croquettes and the mussels, which we both loved. The ambiance is perfect and really comfortable. The only thing is that even though we were the only ones in there, the bartender took a while to take our plates away and bring us the check because he was on his phone. I would love to come back and sit outside when the weather gets warmer.
2015-04-12,4,So the food is never exceptional here it is always passable. But this time my service was so exceptional. We sat at a bar table which is really a large barrel with glass on top of it, it lends to the ambiance. We came in looking for a couple small plates and a nice glass of wine. Let me say the pours were awesome, they were large pours and I can appreciate that. Also, our server Saul* ( I may be misspelling ) was the reason our experience was so good. He was on his game, he kept coming over making sure we weren't empty on our glasses. This man gave us fave star service but the food was a 2.5-3. We had the octopus and the avocado stuffed with crab. The octopus had a nice char on the exterior but it was a bit too chewy. It was in a vinegar sauce that was complimentary but could have been executed better. The avocado dish was eh, didn't love the flavor profile. It was under seasoned and felt like imitation crab meat and the shrimp seemed out of place. I wouldn't order that again. Saul really hooked us up and we were in and out in under an hour. We had an early morning and we were just looking for a quick experience.I would come back for the HH specials M-TH and try an assortment of tapas.
2015-01-13,3,I was here for a private event where there was a buffet style dinner, so I can't really speak for the tapas. The food I did have was okay to pretty good so I would give this place 3.5/5. Unfortunately, I don't know the names of what we had... but I do know that the cheesecake for dessert was really good!! The atmosphere certainly has a nice feel in both the private room downstairs and in the main area. If you park in the garage across the street.... we had to pay $42 for about 4 hours... ick.
2014-12-21,3,Three and a half stars. Food was good, they hit the spot with flavor depth and presentation but miss it on the portions sizes. They could be bigger, or at least keep some consistency. Some tapas had 5 pieces only, others 7 or even 8. Drinks were OK, service was really good. The water fountain in the main dining room needs to either get a good power wash or go bye bye.
2014-11-14,4,First time here and we were a party of 8. Great atmosphere, food and boos. The white sangria is to die and all of out tapas were so tasty. We had tiny meatballs in wine sauce, lobster ravioli, paella, croquettas, and grilled octopus. Will be back soon!
2014-11-03,3,3.5 stars. I love the concept and the atmosphere. We had wine and tried 3 tapas last night. The portabello mushrooms were addicting and the stuffed avocado and bacon wrapped scallops were good too. I just probably wouldn't come back because it was way overpriced for hoboken. Not being a byob doesn't help. We got 3 tapas and 2 glasses of wine each (so 4 glasses total) and our bill was around $78 before tip. It was barely a full meal. We just wanted something light so I don't feel that we got enough for the money. Other than that I do think it's a really cute place and we had great service.
2014-10-19,3,This place isn't too bad! The tapas were very tasty and well seasoned, but I've been to better tapas restaurants. The place is very well decorated and reminds me of a lot of restaurants in Spain! The mojitos were very good and pretty strong! Overall, not a bad place.
2014-09-13,2,Way over priced for what you get and yes I know what tapas isI'm speaking of quality. Even shocked by the $30 pitcher of sangria
2014-08-17,5,This is probably one of the best undiscovered restaurants in Hoboken.  I am still trying to understand why Lolas is not better reviewed and more popular.  The decor is rustic with the tables set on old wooden barrels, and the walls looking like the facade of a spanish pueblo.  The food is generally amazing.  The menu is several pages long of tapas dishes.  The basics like the patatas bravas are delicious.  And they have more fanciful creations as well (salmon with mustard sauce, etc) which are wonderful as well.  The portion sizes are quite large too.  You may not like every single tapa, but odds are you will have no problem finding one which you love.  We've only ever had the sangria, which is flawless.  Not sure what their cocktails or wine are like - we just felt sangria is appropriate for a tapas place, and we've always been satisfied.  Service is standard Latin fare which may not satisfy the most "sophisticated" yuppies out there, but has never been a problem for me.  Lastly Lolas is family friendly as well - we come with our young kids all the time.
2014-08-03,3,The food was impressive, the service less so. The owner/manager has no interaction with customers just wandered around checking tables.. Despite being half full, the staff could not get us out quick enough... Removed our plates 5 times without asking us once. We might go back again but we'll control the piece ourselves.
2014-06-15,3,Came here for Sunday afternoon lunch. Had the steak, mussels, mushrooms,... Portions are large - proportional to the elevated prices for a tapas place. Food tastefully  good; not great. On a negative note, the olive oil was a little stale. Was too full to try the desserts :(
2014-06-11,2,Awful! The olive oil was stale. Not only did they serve it with the bread but drizzled it all over the cheese and cold cuts that were low end supermarket quality to begin with. I had the salted cod fish basque style. Not sure if that means chewy and lacking flavor, but that is what I got.
2014-05-11,1,Service was awful. Worst service in a long time at a restaurant We didn't order more dishes or desert cause of how horrible our service was. Food ok, but a very lousy experience when you are ignored.
2014-04-25,1,Bland food, dishes do not live up to expectations or prices . Bacon- wrapped scallops in raspberry sauce was just ok with none of the flavors standing out despite the promising ingredients. Hot potatoes were not seasoned and drenched in hot-sauce infused ragu. Red sangria was eh and in spite of the strong etoh smell was pretty weak. Waste of 30 bucks.
2014-04-19,4,Very impressed, lie in Hoboken for a long time and had never been here.  Spanish feel but very cool setting.  Tapas but plates are large, / of us had 4 plates and it was a lot of food.  Baby back ribs were on special and great.  The fillet plate comes out with a fire salt rock which is pretty cool.  Overall very good, service was good, and we walked in Saturday night with no reservations.  Drink prices a little high but we didn't come to drink so not a huge issue.  We will be back with friends.
2014-03-23,4,I've passed this place multiple times and never really thought to try it. Decided to try it this past Friday night and I'm so upset that it took me so long to give this place a try. The decor is awesome - wine barrel tables, dark wood everyone. I love it. While the service was a bit slow (at one point I thought our waiter had forgotten about us) the food made up for it. For dinner, my husband and I ordered: the goat cheese special which was goat chesse on pita bread triangles with a pesto-ish (?) sauce, meatballs, bacon-wrapped scallops and patatas bravas. The scallops were my fav: wrapped in bacon with a raspberry sauce base. Too deelish! For dessert, my husband ordered the cannolli cake while I opted for the flan. I should've gone with something else b/c I have very high expectations when it comes to flan and this one did not make the cut. The cannolli cake, however, was tasty. Unfortunately, I can't speak to the wine that we had because even though I ordered three glasses of the same wine - I never got the same one twice. Same thing for my husband. Not sure what's going on behind the bar here but it's a bit disappointing to enjoy a wine enough to order a second glass only to discover it's something else. I'll definitely give Lola's another try as it's the best Spanish food I've had in the area.
2014-03-21,4,We ordered the meat special for 2+. The platter came out smelling delicious and all the meats were very tasty.We were the only ones in the restaurant at lunch, but the service was still slow.If your in Hoboken and in the mood for meat, we would recommend this place.
2014-03-18,3,*In a town like Hoboken that touches greatness in the field of Spanish/Cuban/Latin American food (among many other things, wish I could write a Yelp review of my city), Lola's is passable without standing out.--------------------------------------------------------------Lola's is OK.  I have wanted to love it, but it has become more of a fallback option for Hoboken.  The decor is pretty cool, dark and rustic.  Barrels and wood paneling.  If you aren't sitting upstairs, and are unlucky enough to be seated in the basement, the decor tries to be similar, but it's more like, I dont know, poorly lit Bingo Hall, or afterthoughts to Aunt Peggy's retirement dinner.Service is spotty, and the staff gets overwhelmed when the place gets crowded.  The real issue is the food.  They have a good selection of tapas, generally par for the course when it comes to tapas - nothing overly creative or exquisite.  The food is good, not great, and not poor, just good.Prices are reasonable.
2014-02-25,3,The only reason I'm giving Lola's 3 stars is because the service wasn't the greatest for a slow Tuesday night. The food was great though. I just happen to be a brat and expect to be waited on when I'm out... so sue me. We got the octopus, paella, lobster rav, swordfish & Filet Mignon tips. I loved everything. The swordfish in Lola's sauce was my least fav tho. It was smothered in marina and it kind of took away from the swordfish but my friend loved it. We left completely stuffed. I absolutely am looking forward to coming back here just hoping the severs are more attentive.
2014-02-22,3,I've been here a few times now and was hoping for some improvement but each time I.always leave with just an OK feeling. On our most recent trip I ordered a Goose martini dirty which ended up having a funny taste. I felt like they skimped on the booze or had a crappy olive juice. When I asked for a wine list I expected at least a small book; I got a table card that had about a dozen wines total. Not a great selection by any means but what I did have was good.For food, we ordered the small cheese plate which was really good. It's one of my go to dishes here to start. We ordered 4 plates: 2 veggie (mushrooms & Spanish tortilla), 2 meat (pork skewers & bacon wrapped scallops). The meat came out first which surprised us. When we finished that the waiter asked if we were done to which I informed him that our other two dishes never came. They promptly fixed that and brought them out after we were already pretty full. We picked at it. All dishes I have to say we're pretty good which is why they got the 3rd star. Oh and we had to ask for our water.All in all it was just alright. I wish they would step it up
2014-02-09,3,Dinner last night left us with mixed feelings. While we had a good time we think the food was just "good" (as opposed to "great!").The steak (volcano style) and tuna were delicious, so tender!, and perfectly cooked. The scallops wrapped in bacon w/ raspberry sauce are also amazing (and prob my favorite item). But the "hot! hot!" tomato sauce (on several things) def did not live up to it's description. In fact, it was a bit bland.The decor is top notch and the staff was very friendly and extremely helpful w/ food recommendations.I'd like to come back for the "beef on a roof tile" (and more scallops!) but that's about it.
2014-02-04,4,Always love going to Lola's... their tapas are the closest I've had to the real deal.  Everything in the red wine sauce or green sauce is fantastic.  Also happy hour every day from 4-8pm; limited $6 tapas menu will not disappoint.
2014-02-02,4,Good wine list.  Nice environment.  Food hit the spot with nice tapas selection available. Big enough to avoid long waits... Even late at night.
2014-01-21,5,I have been going to Lola's for the past 4 or 5 years, and it never disappoints.  Every time I bring a new friend there, they are always impressed with how inexpensive it is for the quality of food.  People seem yo complain about the portion sizes, but it is a tapas restaurant.   They have an enormous wine list by the bottle and have a great drink menu as well.  Highly recommended!
2014-01-16,5,I have been dining here for years and it never fails to deliver an amazing meal! I have celebrated my birthday there for four years in a row and they accommodate my group of 20+ without a problem. They have a great staff that attends to your every need.If your looking for the best Sangria or Long Island Ice Tea in the tri-state area, make sure you go down for one there bartender is amazing! Def will be celebrating my birthday there for many years to come!
2014-01-12,4,My girlfriend and I went to Lola's for a second time last night, and were not disappointed. The service was great, the prices were reasonable, and the food was very delicious. The sangria was excellent and the pitchers seemed to have no end. Definitely order the filet mignon volcano; great presentation and the dish is very tasty. We'll be back.
2014-01-07,5,Second time at Lola's. Went with a group of friends and we had a very good time. Between the varied selection of tapas, the wine list and the service, makes it one of my favorite places in Hoboken.
2013-12-08,5,I have been going to Lola's for many years and think it is one of better restaurants in Hoboken.  The ambiance is rustic and romantic.  And, everything on the menu is pretty good. If you are drinking, definitely go for the white sangria.  For food, I would get the goat cheese with pita and/or the avocado stuffed with lobster and shrimp. The location is great when you are traveling out of town.  Once you enter the city from I-95 South, Lola's is right around the corner.  If you do plan on going there, I would recommend bringing a group of friends or a date who you want to impress.
2013-09-20,3,Mehh. Sort of an identity crisis.  My pork filet mignon with whiskey fig sauce was thin overcooked pork covered in brown gravy with some canned figs strewn about. Gf had two glasses of club soda (she's popping out a baby). Charged 3 dollars for each. Thought that was a little odd.  Her leak soup was actually really good minus the Lola's advertisement written in raspberry sauce written across it.Very limited beer selection, extensive wine selection. Good music (80s friday night) not sure if it fits what the restaurant is going for but anyway. Bottom line. Meh. John taffer or Gordon Ramsey would have their way with this place.
2013-09-16,3,We decided to try this place out given that the BF loves tapas. Given this place was NOT BYOB, we decided to give it a try. I remember coming here back in 2005, and don't remember much about it; I think that was from the pitchers if sangria. This time, we sat at a high top in the bar area. The service was pretty good, we received bread almost immediately. We started with the cheese plate, which was ok, not bad but not amazing, either. I appreciated the dried fruits, and nuts that accompanied the cheese. We ordered a pitcher of red sangria. Again, not bad but not great. We got a lot of it but most of it was iced down. The spinach croquettes with the spicy marinara sauce was tasty and the goat cheese, mushroom and pita dish was very good as well. Not very many vegetarian options. BF ordered another dish which he enjoyed. Overall, it's a decent place given the ambience.
2013-08-02,3,Came here the other night and we sampled a bunch of tapas- the pineapple shrimp, some seafood bruschetta, sausage, and skirt steak. They were all just ok. I wouldn't say they were wonderful, but not bad. The sangria was also decent. The décor is really cute inside... You can opt to sit outside which we did and I love doing that. Our waiter saul was very helpful and friendly.
2013-08-01,2,Had lunch today,just average,,the house wine was good.I had monk fish that was just ok,green sauce,,ok,,the rice was oversalted.Husband had calamari,fish salad,,just ok and the stuffed avodaco with some minor pieces of lobster,,ok,the bread was good,Nothing thrilling,lunch prices were decent,,not what we expected,Service was good waitress was very nice, we were the only people in the place
2013-07-20,1,Not what was expecting.... The service was poor and the food tasteless. When we walked in, it appeared that it was an inconvenience to the staff... Once seated we looked at the menu and although it has many options everything we ordered was mediocre at best.  Do not order the churrasco.  I guess the sangria is pretty popular but we did not order it. Lastly on their website it advertised Fridays as salsa nights, only salsa there was the one in the churrasco....
2013-06-16,4,Came here on a Saturday night around 9 PM  for dinner with a group of three.  Immediately brought out another chair when needed and sat us right away.We split the sangria amongst us and ultimately got 10-12 glasses out of the pitcher.  Above average in terms of flavor and ultimately would get again when visiting.In regards to the tapas size, the portions tend to be larger than your standard NYC place. A hungry guy would be satisfied with 1.5 plates while a girl would be ok with one. Splitting two would be the ultimate way to go.We had two dishes1st.  Filet Mignon sauteed with peppers and onions- Delcious.  Very well cooked and the sauce was especially appetizing2nd. Chorizo with Peppers and onions- slight notch below the Filet, but still very good.  Sausage was a tad dry, but overall good. Prices are very well selected and left the place satisfiedWould definitely go back
2013-05-19,3,I haven't been to Lola's in a while - and checked it out recently for a Friday night dinner. I always thought that the set up in Lola's was very cute (it's set up like a little Spanish villa) - really nice for an intimate dinner. We started with a cheese board - which wile small had a nice selection. For dinner we had the Lobster Ravioli (which I found a little salty); Croquetas del dia, a spinach and cheese croquette (really delicious) and Pollo al vino Ribiero (while good flavor wise was a little overcooked). Overall my night at Lola's was ok - the atmosphere good wine list make up for some mistakes with the food.
2013-04-07,2,We came here for Easter Sunday and wondered why we were only the second table of people eating there.  The food wasn't bad, but I honestly can't remember what main course dish I had......the food clearly wasn't memorable.   For dessert we had the chocolate flan and would not recommend this for anyone to have. It was a disgrace of all flan's, the chef should be fired for even attempting to make a flan. Basically this place is for a few drinks and maybe a tapa,  nothing special.
2013-04-02,2,Went to dinner for a friends birthday.  Food was nothing to write home about. Lots of seafood but very little flavor. Not worth the trip.
2013-03-31,4,If Epcot Center had Spain in it, this would be exactly how I would expect the restaurant to look and feel. That being said, I would not call this a Spanish tapas place given that their most recommended dish is the lobster ravioli in lobster sauce. The wine list is huge here (both figuratively and literally) and lots of options under $30. We did a bunch of plates and were mostly pretty pleased. Patatas bravas - skip this guy. Just potatoes in tomato sauce. Chipirones en su tinta - this was so unique and delicious. The rice was cooked in squid ink and the calamari itself was cooked to perfect tenderness in a red sauce. Really tasty and I highly recommend this. Gambones a la plancha - good, but nothing special. Your basic shrimp in a garlic sauce. Mejillones en salsa verde - this was pretty tasty and different. Mussels were well prepared in a flavorful, not spicy, green sauce. Churrasco con setas portobello - super tender skirt steak and mushrooms. This was a generous portion of perfectly cooked steak. Get this if you like dead animal. One thing to note on the service: I accidentally ordered the wrong shrimp dish and when they brought it out and we told them we meant to order the other, they switched it for us, no questions asked, no charge. They were overly accommodating for my own mistake. This is a fun place with pretty good prices and a lot of variety. I will be back.
2013-03-24,2,Terrible service!! Seated immediately got our drinks ok but the food service was terrible! Ordered 5 Tapas plates constantly had to keep asking the wait staff where our food was and after 2 plates were served took another 1/2 hour for the next 2 and finally refused the 5th plate 45 minutes later! Avoid this place!!!
2013-01-27,2,with a few fixes this place could be good. Food was okay, chocolate flan was great, sangria was meh. Wait staff was a step above shitty. The music was weird. They should just stick with traditional spanish music and it would make the atmosphere better, not Sublime. Too many options in the area to go back for anything other than a happy hour
2013-01-15,4,perfect place for a big group. the sangrias are never ending!!! the food average but incredibly plentiful.
2013-01-13,3,I came here on a Saturday night with a group of 4, and while we were seated immediately, it took forever for someone to come over and take our order - my friend actually got up at one point and went to find our waiter so that we could put our order in. We started with a pitcher of white sangria, which was just OK for me. I will definitely try the red next time. The first thing I noticed was that the restaurant was incredibly smoky - the table next to us had ordered some kind of dish that comes "volcano style" - literally, on fire, and it seemed to take forever for the fire to die out. The smoke was thick and stinky and ridiculous - it made me cough even after it had gone out. For the sake of the other diners around you, don't order that, whatever it is. Rude. We went with a bunch of dishes:The Avocado Stuffed w/ Lobster meat and Shrimp was my favorite by far. It was so good, the combination of flavors was so interesting and delicious. The Goat Cheese w/Wild Mushrooms over Pita Bread was also incredibly good. It was the perfect mix of sweet and savory with just a light drizzle of olive oil. Scallops with bacon over raspberry sauce with almonds was also good. I liked the combination of the savory scallops in bacon with the sweet raspberry sauce - could have done without the almonds though, they were kind of pointless. We also got Chicken cooked in a whiskey sauce - it was good, but nothing too special. Same with the Filet mignon with peppers and onions - good, but not outstanding. We decided not to stay for dessert, mostly because it took so long for our waiter to get to our table after we were done eating. Getting the check was another 10 minutes of struggling to get someone's attention - and the restaurant was not all that busy. I would come back here for the food, but the service leaves something to be desired.
2013-01-03,4,I went here recently and really enjoyed it!  I loved the atmosphere -- it was very warm and cozy.  Perfect place for a date or in the company of friends!My date and I started out with manchego cheese and grenache wine -- wow what a great combination!  I also ordered the pumpkin soup and it's not to be missed either.  Do try it!  We followed by ordering La Teja Lola's de Mariscos -- a seafood platter which two can share.  It was really enjoyable.  I highly recommend it.  Finally the owner allowed us to go downstairs to the wine cellar and it was a treat.  This place has no shortage of good wine!  I will definitely be back here again!
2012-12-30,5,This place is amazing! The food, atmosphere, the staff, music,  and the sangria is to die for! I recommend the croquettes, the goat cheese pita, the filet mignon, the avocado with lobster, basically EVERYTHING on the menu! We go there almost on a weekly basis and we don't live anywhere near Hoboken. It's such a great place to go on a date. We even threw my mothers surprise birthday party there last year where they let us use the whole basement which is beautiful decorated as if you are in spain, with unlimited food and sangria and for such a great price! The staff is so nice and always very curtious. I will always continue to go there and I really recommend it.
2012-12-29,5,This place is a Awesome! I come here all the time and always leave satisfied.  When I was a single guy I really appreciated the classy and sexy girls that are constantly here and as a foodie I appreciate the amazing food..particularly  recommend the Goat Cheese Pitas, Steak and portebello mushrooms, stuffed avocado with Lobster and Shrimp...but really anything I've had here has been delicious...the combination between the beautiful women who make up the regulars, the salivatingly good food..and not I mention the refreshing Sangria, I always know a Lolas night is a guaranteed good night...just writing this is making crave the food and atmosphere...Highly  recommend this place from a few drinks with buddies to a large group with multiple Tapas..Lolas is the only sure thing I know in Hoboken and I've been a resident for some time
2012-12-28,2,It looks fun and sounds fun, but something was just a bit off here.The food wasn't that great.  Wine was a bit over-priced.  Just wasn't too pleased with my date here and probably won't go back unless I had to.
2012-12-08,1,Finally went to Lola's with my girlfriend last night after months of being very curious about it... wish I had never gone.Everything started out fine. Upon walking in we were greeted immediately and sat down at a table. We ordered a pitcher of sangria, which was mediocre and priced rather high at $28. After looking over the menu for a couple minutes we had a couple questions which our server had no problems answering for us. We placed our order and waited for the food...First up was the small cheese plate. I believe there was 4, maybe 5 slices of cheese total which came with a couple pieces of dried fruit and grapes which had seeds in them (surprise!). The cheeses weren't very tasty, but I wasn't going to let it bother me. Next up was the avocado stuffed with lobster and shrimp "special" that I've read some nice reviews about. It came out looking delicious, and we both dug right in. Yummmm. Then, it happened. As I was eating my food I came to find a rather long hair in my mouth (surprise #2). We sent our plate back and kindly asked for another. Five minutes later another plate came out and all was good, or so we thought.  As soon as the plate was put on the table I knew something was wrong. The food wreaked like it was spoiled. One sniff and it was confirmed. We called back our waiter and explained the situation. We asked him to smell the food, which he declined and brought back to the kitchen. Needless to say, we didn't ask for a third try and it was taken off our bill. We ended with the filet mignon with peppers and onions in a red wine sauce. Luckily, everything was fine with that plate and we ate it up because we were both still very hungry. We quickly finished the rest of the sangria, paid our bill and made our way out of Lola's. Needless to say, we won't be returning back.
2012-10-27,3,Good date spot for a Sunday night.  The ambiance and the decor does make you feel like you're in an old Mexican village. The portions and service were just okay.  Not to heavy on the old purse change but portions were not abundant in any regard.  I feel like when you go to a very "ethnic" restaurant it should be almost reminiscent of "mamma's cooking" and this place did not hit the mark.  our dishes were good i.e. sauteed calamari and meat plate but it did not make me feel like I was going to leave satisfied.  Sangria was not the typical overly sugary hangover inducer that most places serve, but not outstanding eitheroverall good presentation, service could of been a little happier (we were there on a Sunday night so can't be that disgruntled), but they were pretty prompt and the music and atmosphere was conducive to random dancing from the couples at the tables around us.  Bottom line, if you're looking for a good place to bring a casual date in Hoboken on a Sunday than this place is on the list.
2012-10-03,2,Too many things that were done poorly here.  First off, their menu is too large with many repetitive items on it.  It's not a different dish just because you add garlic and change the type of cheese on it. It took us 20 minutes just to get through the menu.  Now granted, that was because most of it looked very good in the descriptions, but you don't want your guests immediately wondering if they should have ordered the item on page 12 instead of page 3.  Undercooked lobster ravioli? Really?Croquettes that looked and tasted like they came from a cardboard box?And finally, how and why was there gristle on a filet mignon dish? tsk tsk tsk
2012-09-17,3,I think some of the reveiws on here are a bit harsh.  Was the food spectacular? No.  But it was pretty good and the prices were reasonable for the amount of food you get.  I came here with 3 other girls and we ordered 5 items which was plenty.  The sangria was great...again not the best I've ever had but still tasty and the pitcher seemed bottomless.  The staff wasn't overly friendly or anything but they were attentive enough.....my glass was never empty for long and the food was all served in a timely manner despite them being pretty busy on a Saturday evening.  The atmosphere is what wins them major points.  It's very charming.  Great place to come with friends, with couples or on a date.  I won't be racing back...but I'll certainly return.
2012-08-27,1,I went here for my birthday dinner so I had high hopes for this place.  Unfortunately, I was incredibly disappointed.  The fish tasted a few days old and the other dishes tasted reheated.  The mussels were especially horrible and I love mussels - how do you mess up mussels?  They just tasted old. My sangria was just OK and my sister found a fermented grape in her red wine (confirmed by waiter).The waiter brought out a sponge cake free for my birthday which was decent - I suppose that was the best part of the meal.Service was very slow and waiter wasn't very attentive.I've heard this place is "hit or miss" - my experience was definitely a miss and will not be going back.
2012-08-19,3,My boyfriend and I stumbled upon Lolas last night, on our way to another restaurant for dinner. We decided to take a chance and try something new. We lived in Barcelona for 6 months and whenever we see a tapas spot it catches our eye, hoping it will bring back memories of life in Spain. It was a gorgeous evening so we grabbed a table outside, the server promptly came over handing us menus and asking if we'd like a drink. Considering its a spanish place with tapas, Sangria was in order, so we got a pitcher for the 2 of us to share. It was HUGE, seemingly bottomless, good thing, considering when we got the check it was $27! It was alright, lots of fresh fruit, but obviously cheap wine, lacking depth, and it was not strong at all. After finishing the entire pitcher you'd think we'd be feeling it, nope. A basket of nice quality crusty bread was delivered with a choice of 3 dipping oils; garlic, basil, or rosemary, so not spanish, but it was a nice thing to have on the table. On to the food, we ordered 3 tapas to share. To start off, tapas are small bites, and these items were much larger than traditional spanish tapas, and the price reflects that. It was not as authentic as I had hoped but it was ok. The shrimp with garlic, artichokes and serrano ham had a nice flavor, but the shrimp were slightly over cooked and small, and the ham was cubed and chewy, definitely the lowest quality spanish ham they could have used. We also ordered the spinach and chickpeans, which had a curry flavor, a little odd for a spanish place, and then the skirt steak in sofrito, which was really fantastic, the most tender piece of skirt steak either of us had ever had. It was really nice to soak up the broth and sauce with the bread at the end. We chose to skip dessert and just sip on the sangria. Although, Lolas seemed to have several options, definitely not traditional spanish desserts, and made off premises, or ordered from another place. Not a fan of that. One of each dessert was displayed on a tiered cake plate, that is brought to the table, they had obviously been sitting out for atleast a few days and looked shriveled, and old, hardly appetizing. Skip dessert here, but if you're going for a casual date or light dinner with friends, its a cool place.
2012-08-16,5,I met up here with a friend for drinks and we decided to try a few tapas. I honestly can't remember what all three were but I definitely remember the mussels. They were flavorful and delicious. We also had red sangria which was plenty between the two of us. Staff was friendly and attentive. I have no complaints and left wanting to come back for more.
2012-07-16,4,I get sucked into this place.   I find it overpriced yet fairly good.   My only complaint is that it is too loud for dining.   Something very sinister and scandalous goes on here though.   Every single time i step in here,  i don't step out until i'm doing the cha cha around the bar with some random patron.    I often leave saying "just what was in my sangria cause i didn't have moves like this when i entered".     Overall, i'd go back because i've always had fun.
2012-05-23,2,Lola's is pretty mediocre.  I liked the sangria.  The food was okay, but many other better places to go in Hoboken.
2012-05-01,3,I don't know how we did so much damage in so little time.... errrr, in 5 hours? We showed up for dinner around 7pm and didn't make our way home until after 12, which must be a good sign. Or a really bad one... the jury is still out. We ended up settling in at the bar and decided a table wasn't really necessary. The bar tender was nice but not overly talkative or attentive, she seemed to prefer to blend into the background or speak with other customers, which was fine because we kept ourselves well occupied.I decided on a house red wine to start and then transferred over to the sangria. The sangria wasn't too shabby, but it wasn't too fantastic either, whereas the wine was excellent. When we finally got around to ordering we went with three tapas - the names of which are hard to remember... one was a chorizo or sausage, which came in little links. We also ordered a steak with cheese and some sort of baked egg/omelet/potato-y thing. Everything was tasty, but nothing stood out and knocked us over. We didn't finish any of the dishes we ordered, so I think that says a little something. Lola's may be worth a return trip, but I think I'd try other tapasssses next time.
2012-03-19,4,Visited on a Sunday. It was a warm day, so they had the french doors open to the street. We ordered calamari in their own ink, cod stuffed banana, mussels in a spicy tomato sauce, and filet mignon (served on a "volcano"). The cod stuffed banana was amazing...the perfectly imaginative and sweet. The large mussels were cooked to juicy perfection, although the hot sauce could have been a bit hotter. Very cute place, delicious food, and great service! Fantastic for a date. We will definitely be back!
2012-02-18,4,I love tapas and was dying to try Lola's, but was a little skeptical after reading the reviews. We ended up coming here for a girl's dinner last night and I loved this place! The ambiance was so cute, and you feel like you've been transported to Spain. The service was great. They were very attentive and kept checking up on us. It was a Friday night, but they were not busy at all.The red sangria was very good, and we tried a few of the specials and regular dishes. The standouts for me were the bacon wrapped scallops in raspberry sauce, avocado and lobster special, goat cheese special and filet mignon tips with melted mozz. I wasn't crazy about the shrimp and artichoke dish or the meatballs, but the other girls seemed to like them.We all left very happy, and it was pretty easy on the wallet, considering the two pitchers of sangria and all the plates we ordered. I definitely recommend Lola's!
2011-09-09,1,Let us speak frankly for a moment... my mom and I went here for happy hour at 7pm which ended at 8pm. We sat outside because the weather was finally beautiful. After we had 2 beers and 2 mojitos we decided to have a couple of tapas plates. When we got the bill, it was 18 dollars more, so we proceeded to ask our waiter why the difference and he said...wait for it " Happy Hour is for the sitting at the Bar only" , "it says it right here on the sign, but you cannot really see it "( let me say it was silver marker on a whiteboard).  Don't waste your money at this place....the food was not good as well...absolute downer especially since I am a local drinker and would give them money weekly. Thumbs down for you Lola's
2011-06-04,4,It was our first time to try this place. The menu was quite big and impressive. We ordered the original Spanish spinach croquette, clams in grandmother's stew, Spanish meat balls, and tiramisu. We were impressed by their olive oil selections which came with the complimentary basket of breads. I really loved the spinach croquette. Clam dish seemed very small for the price. Meat balls were good. We loved the ambiance a lot. I knew the tiramisu was not made at the restaurant, however it was very tasty!We'll go back to this place to try other items!
2011-05-07,2,Well, I'll say that the interior of Lola's is very unique and beautiful. When I start a review like that, it usually goes downhill from here...It's pretty tough for me to write a unbiased review of tapas/small plates restaurants when I already have an overwhelming favorite -- Alta in the West Village. But, I think it's pretty fair to say that nothing is special about the food here. It was all cooked very well, but the sauces and garnish did absolutely nothing to compliment the food at all. The chicken in whiskey sauce tasted like plain chicken. The chef's swordfish tasted like plain swordfish. No additional flavor to it. Nothing unique.That being said, I wouldn't be opposed to coming back to grab a glass of wine at the bar. Just be prepared for the comically large wine list if you plan on dining here. Usually when I say "large," I mean "large selection," but in this case the menu itself is large and unwieldy with big print. It made for an initial laugh or two but quickly became a nuisance when trying to order a bottle.
2011-04-21,3,OK here's the thing about Lolas - it has more strong points than weak.  It really does.  My bf lives a couple blocks down from the place so its actually one of a few "date night" locations for us.  I've been there about 5 or 6 times...so why would you continue to go to a restaurant you only give 3 out of 5 stars for date night you ask?  well...  It's very romantic in there - dimly lit, small dark corners w privacy...it makes you feel like you're in a medieval spanish wine cellar.  i love the decor and ambiance.  if i was judging just that i'd give it 5 stars.I would even give its staff a decent rating: for the most part they're pretty fast and attentive.  no worthy complaints there.But, I'm not impressed with the food.  Being seriously addicted to seafood, I always have to try whatever ceviche dish spanish restaurants have.  So that is what I instinctively did at Lola's...and is not good.  Actually kinda bad.  Although they used a good variety of seafood in the dish (shrimp, mussels, clams, squid, etc) the dish is drenched in oil and the taste is overpowered w nonsense.  do.not.order.it,  I have forgotten how awful the ceviche is at Lolas and I order it anyway and it pretty much ruins my night.Their chorizo and peppers were kind of overcooked and they couldve been a little more generous w the chorizo.  And I've also tried the salmon w mustard dressing and it had way too much dressing.I will tell you what is good at Lola's though and it surprised me too: their leek soup.  I'm about as Irish as they come and my bf, who is Welsh in descent and grew up on the stuff, well we have a high standard on food that usually belongs to our ancestors.  but lola's soup is just the right balance of creamy and sweet.  it's delicious.  my bf and i love the stuff.  the soup also gets 5 stars.What's NOT good is the fact that i have seen not one but a couple break up dinners at lolas - those are very uncomfortable to be within hearing distance of but fun when you get to guess what they're saying and how they're ending it.  Kind of like a real version of the TV show Blind Date.  But seeing that twice in a relatively short period of time makes me ask myself if this restaurant is marketing themselves on being "THE #1 break-up restaurant of Hoboken".  End tangent, more about food.Lola's does have a pretty extensive menu though and their portions are so big its hardly a tapas and more an entree.   and I have to say that a lot of its items are somewhat affordable (the seafood is a huge exception to that)  Their wine selection is pretty good as well.  Overall I would recommend this place for a quick nosh with a safe tapas but not a full meal where you show up starving.  But, maybe the ideal break-up restaurant?
2011-03-01,3,I've been here a couple times with big groups (the way to go so you can sample everything). The tables are kind of awkward and we've had to wait for service for seemingly no reason. That being said, I'm satisfied with the food. The pita with goat cheese, chickpeas with spinach, and some type of mussels are standards.
2011-02-09,3,Is this the only restaurant opened on Mondays?  Great sangria, too much ice.  Look forward to an evening to sample 3-4 of the wines.
2010-12-15,4,Not sure why this place has so many bad reviews.  I've been coming here for years and have never been disapointed.  I absolutely love the scallops in the rasberry saue and the Volcano steak.
2010-12-12,4,This place has a romantic atmosphere & the service was fine for a Saturday night.  There was just 2.  They validate the parking that is in a garage down the street which is awesome.   For 2 of us we shared 4 plates (langoustines in brandy sauce, filet mignon in madeira sauce, fried calamari, & lobster ravioli).  All were tasty & we enjoyed our meal.  The house cabernet was excellent.  I would recommend this place.
2010-11-13,1,This place is pretty popular in Hoboken, but I just don't get it. Very average (at best), trying-to-be-authentic, Spanish food. They mix traditional items like Rioja wine, chorizo and croquetas with things like chicken in whiskey sauce, lobster ravioli with vodka sauce, and passion fruit sangria. Passion fruit sangria? Seriously? None of the food was good. Not even the Spanish tortilla which is so easy to make well. I went with a group of 12, so they sat us in the basement. Yes, the basement. It's sort of charming with brick walls and decorative barrels, but I was totally missing the ambiance of other diners. Until around 10pm when a private party of about 20 showed up in the basement and the waiters kicked us out and sent us to the bar. I can't imagine why anyone would go here with all of the other options in  uptown Hoboken, and better Spanish restaurants in the city.
2010-10-31,3,I gave this place a 3rd (and final??) chance...and it's just is stuck at 3.  I can take it or leave it.  Maybe it's in my blood, but I like Latin American food better.  Comparing the way they use the same ingredients to make the dishes they do...i think i could make it better, way better.  It's not terrible, some of it is better than edible, it's just missing that something...
2010-10-16,3,Went here a few weeks ago with friends- the olive bar at the bar was yummy and the girl at the bar recommended wine and was spot on with her recommendations- however the explanation of the tapas, how it would work, all of that was not really there, it was just like, and here's some more food, and here's some more food,the avocado with seafood thing was really yummy, as were the mussels in green sauce, and the environment was friendly and trendyi'd say a nice place-
2010-10-14,2,If you think people from Latin America are called "Spanish people" eat here!!This place is sooooo authentic... Note my intense sarcasm.My friends made for a great time despite how much this place sucked. Happy Bday JP :)
2010-10-09,1,This has to be, by far, the worst tapas restaurant I have ever been.  The name "tapas" does not go along the size of the portions.  They are full size dishes, which reflect their price.  That aside, the patatas bravas were soggy, and uncooked at the same time.  The skirt steak was way over seasoned as so was the filet mignon.  Save yourself some time and $ and go to a good tapas bar across the river.
2010-08-27,1,Overpriced, mediocre and completely inauthentic. Don't waste your money. Pretty room nice decor. But just an excuse to charge high prices for bad food.
2010-08-23,5,Excellent quality food. Great sangria. Very friendly and attentive staff. I was there with a group helping to celebrate my sister's 21st birthday. In particular the "Buey el Volcan estilo de Lola's" was excellent...so tender and juicy. As the name says, its their specialty, and they definitely do it well. Another particularly good item was "Chorizos al vino tinto o en cerveza". I had it in the red wine, and it was excellent! Very tasty. Desserts were also very nice. Try the red velvet cake. Espresso was of good quality. Would I come here again? Absolutely.
2010-07-27,3,I was here to meet a group of my friends for a little get together. My boyfriend and I were the first to arrive so we waited by the bar and ordered a pitcher of sangria. We thought their sangria was really good. It's very light and you might not think there's a lot of wine in it but we liked it a lot. When all our friends finally arrived, we were seated in their downstairs area. It was great being down there because it was quieter and it felt like our own dining area. There were few groups that came as the night progressed but we were definitely glad we were seated there. I don't remember all the food everyone ordered but everything was pretty good. I'd say it was an average experience and we do not regret making reservations for dinner here for some tapas and drinks. And even though it's a tapas place, their food portions were much larger than other tapas restaurants I've been to. It's a good place to go with a group of people.
2010-05-02,4,I live 2 blocks from here and when I need good food without the line out the door, this is my go-to spot.  I usually sit at the bar which guarantees attentive service and it's usually quiet.  Not to mention, I'd love to take Marlena home with me but that's a review for an entirely different website!I noticed that lots of people complained about the service.  While I have never sat in the dining area, please let me remind everyone; this is Hoboken!  Service lacks at virtually every restaurant/bar in this town.Their seafood dishes and cheese platter(s) are excellent.  While I cannot rave about their sangria, this is a terrific, quiet spot.  Will also validate parking which is a plus.
2010-04-06,2,A. Been to Barcelona tapas restaurantsB. This place is no representation of spanish tapasC. Food was disappointing and expensiveD. Place was dimly lit ergo good for the dateE. Been downstairs for a party and since I got smashed on wine, it seemed to be okF. Service was a hot messI will not hit again.
2010-04-04,2,The atmosphere: so-so. Kinda of small & tight despite having a downstairs they hardly use.The food: VERY tasty...however the portions are very small & will not fill you up. The prices: expensive for such small amounts of food.The wine: okay...but the sangria is not soo good, almost tastes watered down. THERE IS NO PARKING OTHER THAN STREET PARKING (which consider yourself extremely lucky if you find it) & BECAUSE WE WERE PARKED OVER 3 HRS. THE PARKING FEE WAS $30.00!Overall, we did NOT really care much for this place despite the delicious clams in white sauce(best thing we sampled on their menu).
2010-04-04,1,No thanks! First off, the name of this restaurant should not include tapas. If you are expecting tasty little dishes and a solid drink menu, don't come here! Presentation and service is poor and dishes are not authentic... Which you may not notice if you are too distracted by the Mexican music or cheeeesy fountain in the middle of the place! The sangria is not worth commenting on. Better off taking the PATH to the village for a more authentic experience for about the same price.
2010-03-28,3,I've gone twice in the last few months to celebrate birthdays with groups of friends. Its a great place for groups -- and I never had difficulties making a reservation for 8-10+ people more than a week in advance.As many of the reviews reflect, the service is spotty.  On the first of my recent visits, the bar tender was friendly and attentive as our group waited for everyone to arrive.  Once we moved to the table, the service was certainly adequate, but nothing to write home about.  The last visit was not as good -- was hard to find someone to seat us and service was lackluster.Yes, the tapas are pricey -- but most tapas restaurants I've been too are similar -- you order all these small plates and before you know it, the bill really adds up.  But in general, the food is pretty good and they certainly keep the sangria flowing.I gave it 3 stars because as I mentioned, it really is good for groups.  Don't think I'd go out of my way though to go to Lola's with a smaller party.
2010-02-18,2,Overall, Lola's provided a disappointing experience, though it was pretty dead on with what I expected after seeing the reviews on the site.Nevertheless, having lived in town for 3 years, it was a place on my list to try, and the atmosphere was awesome.  The olives and cheese they give you at the bar are a very nice touch.The tapas were quite expensive and fairly mediocre in both taste and presentation.  The waiter was less than attentive and professional given the price of the meal he was being tipped on ($140 for 3 people).To top it off, I left with a bad taste in my mouth because the staff (including someone I presume to be the owner) decided since it was quiet, it was ok to smoke cigarettes and cigars in the downstairs area.  That's fine with me, since  next time, you won't have my business, and maybe it will be totally dead.Summary:  one star for the aesthetics of the place, one star for the olives.
2009-11-22,4,The atmosphere is fantastic.   The service is good, but not exceptional.  The portions are not huge since it is a tapas place, and I do think it is somewhat overpriced, but we have rarely had a bad item, and if you are at all experimental they usually have a few items that will surprise you.  The cod fritters are amazing, as are the mushroom and goat cheese on pita.  The sangria is nit the best I have had, but is still quite good.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice long dinner for a date, or for a long dinner with a decent size groups of friends.
2009-06-16,4,Wonderful place! Can't wait to go back. Not a fan of tapas food in general (although what I had was very very good) but what made this place special was it's interior: like sitting in a spanish street restaurant, with fancy villas around and even a water fountain in the middle. And downstairs was even cozier. We were there on a terrible rainy day and it felt like being in another (warm and not rainy) country.As you see, I'm terrible with description but I'd say the place definitely deserves to be checked out!
2009-04-25,2,Good decor, and some of the other diners next to us ordered grilled dishes set a-flame that looked interesting, but in general WAY too much salt on everything, and i'm not averse to some NaCl.Anyway, probably a good spot to sit at the bar for while, but plenty of other options nearby for dining.  Porto Spain across the street, while not tapas, does seafood Spanish style pretty well.
2009-01-27,1,Dishes were blah.  It should have been a sign if we were the only ones there for lunch.  As for tapas prices - a little pricey $10+ per dish versus other places I've been.  The beef dish had a creamy boring sauce and chicken was ok.  The Shrimp with garlic was an easy dish but I've had better.
2008-10-06,3,The food here is good, but you have to order quite a few dishes (not just 1 per person) to have enough to eat. This can add up rather quickly in terms of what you end up spending when you dine there. The ambiance is very nice, and it has a comfortable decor. I would dine there more often if it was more value for money. But the food was not fantastic enough to justify the cost, I think.
2008-04-11,2,I love Spanish food, this place has the best ambiance, you almost feel like you are in Spain!  The food was not bad but not great either. Some dishes were too salty or the quality was a bit lacking.  Sadly I make better Sangria then they do.  Probably won't go back for food, but maybe for a Margarita.  One plus is they have the largest wine list I have ever seen.
2008-01-20,3,Unfortunately, other than it's decor, which reminded me of a Spanish villa complete with wine cellar basement, Lola's failed to impress me.  While the food was good, the spotty service and high price for even basic tapas left a bad taste in my mouth.I sampled bacon wrapped scallops in raspberry sauce and the fillet Mignon with cherry peppers, washing it all down with some good ole sangria.  The scallops were great, the meat was standard and the sangria was nothing special.
2007-10-29,3,The place is LOUD - so much so, that we could not hear the waiter trying to tell us what the specials were.  The atmosphere is nice (inside it appears that you are outside in a Spanish courtyard); however the four of us got seated at a table for two - so, it was very tight.  The tapas were interesting but not overwhelming.  We would have gone hungry, but for the "La Teja Lola's de Carnes" (a grilled meat selection served in a traditional Spanish roof tile), which I recommend - be aware, it arrives at your table on fire!  Be also aware that the Sangria is approximately $25 per pitcher (for four of us, we had two pitchers).
2007-09-04,3,After all of the hype I heard about this place, I must say I was not impressed.  The atmosphere is terrific.  The restaurant is very rustic with lots of stones and wood.  The bases of the tables are made from large barrels, which made putting your feet under the table a bit difficult.  The service was adequate.  The menu is huge and full of Spanish tapas of either meats, seafoods, or vegetables.  The tapas are definitely large and well-priced compared to most other places.  The recommend 2 small plates per person.  Two small plates can also be replaced by a mixed seafood grill or a mixed meat/poultry one.  However, read the menu carefully.  It mentions that it feeds 2 at a minimum of $21.95.  We read it as $21.95 total, since everything else on the menu was under $20, but it turned out to be $21.95 PER PERSON, which was insane.  There are a nice sized bar and outdoor seating available.We started with the Spanish Potato Omelet.  It was literally a large patty made of egg and potato served in a hot skillet.  While it was tasty, it could have used more seasoning...perhaps pepper....and a big side of ketchup.  We also ordered their specialty Fillet Mignon Volcano.  They hype this up saying you won't find it anywhere else.  Yeah, and now I know why.  It was the lamest dish ever.  The waiter told us that it would be four slices of fillet mignon surrounding a flaming volcano.  My mind starts to picture a flaming volcano made of onion rings like at a hibachi steak house.  However, our volcano turns out to be some hard, inedible, flammable mound of something or other.  There were four slices of "fillet mignon" laying around the volcano.  I added the " "s because this was clearly prime rib.  The meat had been sliced very thin and was cooked well, but lacked color and substance.  Lastly, we ordered the seafood mixed grill, which contained, langosteins, shrimp, clams, mussels, 2 thin crab legs, and scallops.  The langosteins were amazing.  The shrimp were fully shelled, making them hard to attack, but they were decent.  The clams were also good.  The scallops were ok, but a bit chewy.  The mussels were horrendous....or at least the one I tried was.  It was so salty that it tasted like it had come straight from the ocean.  I spit it out and was scared to try another.  I did not try the crab legs because they were so thin that they appeared to have no meat whatsoever.  We ordered a pitcher of red sangria as well.  The wine was too sweet and the fruit chunks were so large that they did not even pour out of the small pitcher.All in all, the food was just ok, but I do not plan on going back.
2006-08-26,3,Very well decorated, but too expensive and food can get iffy. Portions are often tiny, which is probably fine for a tapas bar, but not when you charge $12 a dish. From what we sampled, seafood, Jamon and albondigas (spanish meatballs) were pretty great. Salad and steak were mediocre - lettuce looking sad and tired and steak being too salty.Bottom line: for the price, why don't you just go out to a nice place in the city?
