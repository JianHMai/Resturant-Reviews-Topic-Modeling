2021-10-15,5,I love this place I literally eat here like every other day . Best açaí bowls in the area . The owners care about hygiene and cleanliness as much as I do . Staff is cool vibe is dope and I always leave feeling like a valued customer appreciate y'all
2021-10-06,4,A nice healthy spot full of treats and meal prep options. I've been here mostly to scoop up some food ordered from a meal prep company but also have had the opportunity to try their protein oats balls and a few of their smoothies. This place serves some delicious guilt free treats with a smile. The staff is super friendly and welcoming : )
2021-09-19,5,I normally go to Acai ya Later in the morning and during my lunch break. The staff are all amazingly sweet and beautiful people. I can taste the love they put into my custom smoothies all the time. I even once caught the assumable manager or owner training a new worker and he was a great example of and enjoyable experience. My Smoothie: Coconut Milk, Blueberries, Mango, Pineapple, Vanilla protein.
2021-08-27,1,I absolutely love acai bowls & thought this place was going to be a hit due to the name.. sike! 1 star is too much! Worst acai bowl i've ever had! The base was super watery & sweet like a melted iceey. The fruits did not even taste fresh. Tasted like they were getting rotten. I couldn't even finish my bowl, i had to throw it out. Paid almost $40 on 3 things, waste of money! Would never come here again. Nothing is fresh!
2021-07-30,1,More like Açaí ya Never! I've had a lot of açaí bowls and by far this is worst Açaí bowl ever. I didn't realize that someone can make açaí bowls taste this bad.
2021-05-25,5,It was my first time trying acai, I find it surprisingly good enough to satisfy my sweet tooth cravings,. will come back for more!
2021-05-16,5,Best açaí bowl I ever had. The customer service is amazing & they were very tentative to my needs. Definitely would recommend!!!
2021-04-18,5,Omgg the pitaya is to die for. I used to be obsessed with the acai but now I've switched to pitaya. Everything here is so healthy and delicious at the same time. The staff is great and so helpful and all the snacks are delicious so anything you pick out is safe. Highly recommend .
2020-12-27,4,This place is a solid SI ball retail shop. They are open late which is great so you don't have to worry about them only serving breakfast. If I lived in the neighborhood I would probably frequent this place weekly. Cheers.
2020-12-24,5,A healthy sweet treat. I typically get the Washington Street bowl with peanut butter. The bowl is huge, so I usually eat half and finish the rest later. I like both their acai & pataya blend because it's not too watery & sweet like other places. Plus the owners are the nicest guys. Matt, Mike, Brian- you guys rock!
2020-12-13,4,Love this place to have a sweet treat and not feel too guilty! I had berry me baby, which came with a lot of berries with dragon fruit base. The Washington street bowl was good too, which the pineapple added some tropical taste to it.
2020-11-11,5,I had blueberry, strawberry, banana with honey acai bowl. Super refreshing, sweet, and delicious. Their fruit quality is exceptional. I don't know where they get such amazing fruit because I can barely find those in a gourmet grocery store. The amount of the fruit was perfect and so was everything else. Highly recommend!
2020-10-28,5,I am a regular customer. They make the  best Acai bowl in the city!! Fruits are fresh and they keep the environment clean. Ice coffee is a bit over priced but it tastes fresh.
2020-09-21,1,$9 for a smoothie and the kid can't fill it all the way????I didn't drink any yet, just put a straw in.
2020-08-28,5,Truly the best acai bowls I've ever had! And the most reasonably priced in Hoboken. Plus they have gluten free granola if you ask! Service is stellar but they are often understaffed. Usually empty but will randomly fill up with a rush. Smoothies are ok, thick and very large with a matching price. Seems like they rent out fridge space / counter space to sell other brands? A bit confusing and the brands in question are often overpriced, but that doesn't stop me from constantly swinging by for a bowl :)
2020-08-21,5,I went this morning and got the Berry bowl (I forgot exactly what it's called) I also asked for honey and PB on it. By far the best acai bowl I've had. The base was cold and creamy; not icy. A great amount of PB and other toppings as well. The girl working there was so polite and sweet. I will definitely be returning!!
2020-08-15,3,They don't accept the yelp deals on here.. sucks bc I came here excited to use it. Other than that it's good here, but I think the Acai base is pre-made.
2020-08-14,1,I placed my order for delivery two hours ago, and it has yet to show up. I called the store in case something was wrong, no one picked up. I called 4 times, no response. It wouldn't matter that they're late if I was able to reach them and find out, but 2+ hours late AND no responsiveness is just annoying and disrespectful
2020-07-01,2,Change your online hours if you're not going to open at the time you say you do online. Just walked twenty minutes to find out you weren't open at 8, but rather at 9..
2020-06-20,2,I ordered pickup from Seamless, probably big mistake, as I'm sure this would not happen if I ordered in person and watched them make it. The color of açaí  was brown instead of purple... to be fair, I chose peanut butter and honey, but I ordered this syrup combination from other places before, never came out brown..It was also way too sweet.... too bad seamless didn't have way to indicate how much syrup you would like and I didn't know they could add this much honey into the bowl. Sadly to say it's the worst taste açaí bowl I've ever had... gave 2 stars because maybe lack of sweetness/syrup indications on seamless was not their fault...even though I don't understand why they didn't know the amount of honey they put in was way too much.
2020-03-15,5,Ordered delivery. Good portion. Lots of fruits on the topping. Also love the coconut flakes and granola. One thing I wouldn't do next time is to add Nutella and agave cause they were making the bowl way too sweet.
2020-03-11,5,I get acai bowls all over the tri state area. Acai Ya Later HANDS DOWN makes the best Acai bowl around.
2020-01-29,5,Great find! Was craving Acai and this one hit it on the head. Owner is a nice guy, and hooked it  up. Bowl options were good and tasted delicious. Def recommend and will come back.
2020-01-28,5,What would life be if i had not been introduced to acai and especially this cute place. The Washington bowl with nutella is the only thing i eat and can probably live on it. Its a no brainer on anyday this place  makes you acai not later but now :)
2020-01-14,5,Awesome place!!  Great choices and friendly service!! A definite stop when visiting Hoboken!!
2020-01-07,1,Incompetent workers, rude customer service, no fresh fruit whatsoever, extremely small storefront and even smaller portions. I stopped by a couple of weeks ago after work for a freshly made smoothie, and since this was the place closest to me, I decided to give it a try. I went with the "last night was mad real" smoothie (blueberries, strawberries bananas and orange juice) and asked for pineapple juice instead of orange. As the girl behind the counter pours in what seems like all the ice they have into the blender, another customer walks in, which already felt a little snug in the store since it was soooo small. she takes her order (as expected, I would've done the same) and then... this is what shocked me... decides to completely leave my order half finished and begins making the other customers bowl. I'm actually glad she did because I learned they don't even use fresh acai for their bowls! the girl literally scooped what looked like shaved ice with pink syrup from a big tub in a freezer, DISGUSTING! the bowl size was also extremely small and the customer was charged almost $11!!! After realizing she was starting an entirely different order, I asked if there was someone else who would make my order, since she just left it in there, she replies with "I'm gonna make it for you just wait." I was shocked! she leaves the other customers order also unfinished and returns to my order. This is where it gets horrific. The worker goes into a mini fridge and grabs a ziploc bag of frozen fruits.. no fresh fruit went into my smoothie, nothing refreshing about it. And since the girl decided to work between orders, she goes ahead and puts orange juice into the blender..... after i specifically asked for pineapple.. if she hadn't lost track of my order while too busy making someone else's, maybe she would've remembered what I asked for. I decided it wasn't even worth the argument, grabbed my drink and walked out. The smoothie was tasteless and watered down with all the ice she put in there, there was nothing special about the drink or the store. Definitely won't be returning. I don't even like Shaka bowl and would soooo prefer it over this disgrace of an acai spot.
2019-12-30,5,This is my friend and mines go to spot! All of the staff is super friendly and even knows our bowls by order by the amount of times we go here. The bowls are always freshly made, and honestly addicting that I have withdrawals. Highly recommend and can not say enough great things!
2019-11-30,5,This place was my go to while I was an undergrad student at Stevens. I took a pit stop here the other day, and it was like walking back in time. The quality is still just as good, if not even better, and I love how friendly the staff is. I had a punch card from 2017 and thankfully it didn't expire! I did a Washington Street bowl with all three smoothie bases: coconut, açaí, and pitaya-- yes I did that! The manager said I was probably the first to mix all three. Just shows that either I'm a) indecisive or b) all base flavors are super good! I did an almond butter and agave drizzle, and it complemented the flavor as opposed to adding too much sweetness. If I were to come back, I'd do the "Bring Me to the Beach" bowl with a pitaya & coconut base to make me feel as if I'm on an island. Just note: the coconut smoothie base is most likely not as healthy as the other two, but all in moderation, right?
2019-10-14,5,I've had maybe one or two acai bowls in my life, so still feel a little like a acai neophyte when trying to order one. On a walkabout the town this past weekend, I was craving something sweet and thought I'd try something a little different than ice cream. First of all, this is a dang cute shop. It looks like a little tiki hut. They have acai bowls (duh) smoothies and juices. And it looks like a few other things too. The staff was super nice and let me try the different bases. I liked the sweeter acai much better than the pitaya but loved that they let me try both before ordering. I got the Bring Me to the Beach bowl, it has pineapple, banana and mango with granola and coconut flakes. I got a honey and nutella drizzle to it. It was the perfect sweet treat. Oh and check out that Yelp check in offer! Half off bowls and smoothies?!
2019-10-03,1,Although I have a smoothie place right next to me on 11th street, I decided to walk the extra 9 blocks on a rainy day because I wanted to take advantage of Acai Ya Later's 50% off yelp check in offer. Yes, I'm cheap but I also felt that it was a good excuse to discover a new smoothie place in Hoboken. I quickly regretted that decision. When I asked the front desk person about redeeming my offer, she looked at me like I had 6 heads so I went on to her show her that the promotion was one of the first things you see on their yelp page. She then yelled downstairs to her manager to see if they were still honoring it (although it was clearly available for me and anyone else to redeem on yelp) and the manager, who couldn't even walk up a couple stairs to show proper customer service, simply yelled "No." I then asked if she could ask her manager to make an exception since I walked all the way over here to which the employee responded, "I just did." Um ok. This establishment not only refused to honor a discount they themselves were promoting for advertising purposes but they also could care less about customer service. Do yourself a huge favor and head to Shaka bowl across the street for a company who knows how to treat their clients.
2019-09-23,5,Good bowls, good service, good prices! Plus, they're never stingy with the Nutella! Check in on Yelp for that discount!
2019-09-23,4,Good products but the place itself seems a little unorganized. I saw a lot of customers get annoyed because their bowls took forever to come out, and it was because the staff forgot about them or there was a mix up. I got the pb&j time smoothie and added Nutella and it was really really good. You really get your money's worth here unlike playa bowls, and I think that'll keep customers coming back.
2019-09-20,2,Placed an order today and felt pretty uninspired about giving them a try for a repeat performance. I order a taco bowl, an acai bowl, and two juice shots. It was more expensive than other places I've tried, and I can live with that, but the options were also not very plentiful given that this place specializes in acai bowls. When the delivery came, the taco bowl was missing completely. The juice shots were yummy and my bowl was prepared correctly - I did enjoy that. But when I tried to call to find out where the missing taco bowl was, the phone number the establishment has listed on google did not work. Seamless informed me that they were out of the taco bowls today but I'm left feeling confused as to why they never gave me the heads up. My partner would have happily chosen an acai bowl instead, but since we didn't find out until the delivery arrived, it was pointless to bother placing a second order. I'm not sure if this was a fail in terms of their working relationship with Seamless, or just something they honestly overlooked but it caused me to have to backtrack and wait for a refund, plus my partner had to find a new establishment to order from and place a second order just to have lunch so from my perspective, it is made for an irritating experience.
2019-08-20,5,Obsessed with this place.  It's super yummy and I prefer it over playa bowl because I like the texture of the Acai better. Every time I order from Playa bowl it's too soft l, almost melted.  Acai ya later's Washington St. bowl is my fave.  Friendly staff.
2019-08-18,5,My boyfriend is obsessed with this place. We always get the acai bowl with peanut butter, granola  and Nutella. It's makes us feel healthier than getting ice cream for dinner at least. We prefer this bowl over playa nearby. Service is also super quick! Just wish they would stay open longer at night, they seem to close too early for us when we go on Fridays or Saturdays.
2019-08-05,5,So delicious! You get so much for your money which is sometimes not the case with these kinds of places. I don't think the juices are pressed on site but all the fruit was fresh. The woman that helped me was super friendly and chatted with me about the store. Will definitely be back every time I'm in Hoboken!
2019-07-05,5,Small cute little shop. Many choices of juices, smoothies and acai bowls and you can also mix and match to make a flavor that suits your cravings. Some healthy pre packaged salads, snacks and protein balls. Theres a few seats inside and tables outside. Grab a bowl and a board game and enjoy some sun.
2019-07-01,4,Cute little fresh smoothie and açaí bowl spot! I tried their fresh smoothie and added vanilla protein shake. It was light and refreshing on a hot summer day. You can add/ modify your smoothie with other fruits and veggies for additional cost. They have a small outdoor area that you can enjoy your mid afternoon snack!
2019-06-30,4,Perfect place to stop by quick for lunch. You have the option to make your own açaí or smoothie bowl. I typically choose the dragon fruit/pitaya. They have quality products and offer loyalty cards which is always a plus!! They have a few bowls to chose from on the menu, or you can choose your own ingredients from a good assortment of offerings. I actually personally prefer when there are more menu items consisting of bowls with pre-selected ingredients because even though I know my own preferences, sometimes seeing a variety of bowl options gives me an idea of what flavors go better together, then I can substitute what I don't like out. But overall, great place!
2019-06-26,2,So i came here because they were at an event and were have a promotion as well as a deal for the first bowl you get check in offer. Parking around this area SUCKS so it made my visit a little bit sour, especially since this store is so tiny it can only fit maybe five people inside max. The two girls that were working were talking to each other and not to me, they just asked for my order and then that was it and gave me my bowl. The bowl itself wasn't bad, decent pricing and decent amount of actual acai compared to just giving me granola. But just overall, compared to other places i don't think this place is worth it unless you live in this area and are walking here by foot. The location and staff just don't make the the food worth it.
2019-06-25,5,The best açaí bowl I've ever had. I don't live in Hoboken but this place makes me wish I did.
2019-04-24,1,The women who's working right now is so rude !!! (April 24th-8:34pm. ) We placed an Uber eats order and they canceled it right way. We call and see why, she says we're not taking Uber eats orders and just hangs up! We have been trying to order this for several days now and each day has gotten canceled. Your telling me they aren't taking orders two weeks straight? Then get off the Uber eats app  !! Terrible customer service, smh!! On top of that she ignored the first time we called.
2019-04-15,5,The best juice joint in town/nyc. Brian makes the magic happen. Their options are out of this world!!! Their juice makeS any cold better in no time
2019-04-02,4,I've been a few times and I just love it here. I like that the Acai bowls are to the point. There aren't several to choose from making it an easy decision when making a bowl. The fruit always tastes fresh and the bowls are a good size. One gripe is my acai often comes too frozen or too cold to eat so I let it sit for a while. I've had smoothies as well which I love that you can build you own. My favorite snack to grab is the almond butter protein balls. Do yourself a favor.. they are equipped with almonds, almond butter, cacao nibs and more. My favorite after gym or mid morning snack. The staff have always been friendly thus far. I continue to go back because it's reasonably priced, quaint and to the point. Soooo delicious!
2019-03-30,3,Just an average acai base -didn't feel fresh and the sweetness was artificial.The toppings were good (berries, banana,granola)Yelp checkin offer with 50% off is great but i wouldn't buy it again even at 50% off..
2019-03-21,4,Took my girlfriend here for breakfast because we were in Hoboken for spring break. It's a small place, but full of character. There are two little seats by the window and two-player board games, next to the seating area. There are a good amount of acai bowl options, as well as smoothie options, if you aren't interested in having an acai bowl. My only complaint regarding the taste of their acai bowls is that they are incredibly sweet. Tastes like some type of sugar or sweetener has been added in, along with the fruit. I love sweets, but I prefer my fruit to be left as it is. Can't speak for the smoothies, since I haven't tried them. My girlfriend, however, really loved theirs (the one pictured on the right.) So, it might just be a "me" problem. All in all, I would visit again. :)
2019-03-06,5,Checked out this place on my lunch break today based off some good reviews from my coworkers and friends.When you walk in initially, the interior is very cute and aesthetically pleasing. The purple theme is very nice, from their business cards to their straws. Tried their Peanut Butter and Jelly Time smoothie - which had banana, strawberry, peanut butter and almond milk! Tasted very good and fresh! Service was fast and friendly. Would definitely return for an acai bowl!
2019-02-27,5,This is my favorite smoothie place in the city! The "peanut butter jelly time" smoothie is a amazing and if i want a little filler I add vanilla protein plant based! The staff is friendly, place is clean, they deserve 7 stars!
2019-02-08,5,Enjoyed a custom made acai bowl - delicious -  I'll be returning soon!  Be sure to use Yelp coupon on first visit, 50% off.
2019-02-04,5,Excellent. The bowls are fresh tasting, no added sugars are mixed with acai. Great in size and easy to eat (not overfilled like usual bowls). What I appreciated most is the effort to save the environment. Only boxed water is sold (plastic bottles are not offered) AND you get charged to.15 cents to get a paper bag. I realize once i got in the car, i chugged my bag. Parking on Washington isn't fun so you can order in advance to get it ready. OR if you have time to make this a trip, find yourself a seat out front and enjoy the moment
2019-02-02,5,The Washington Bowl as Acai Ya Later is totally delicious! I feel healthy just looking at it but eating it is pretty enjoyable too. There are many fruit toppings to choose in addition to things like peanut or almond butter, shaved coconut, agave or honey, and more! There is a wide selection of smoothies on the menu here so I will definitely be coming back again soon. The location is right on 2nd and Washington st and there is cute outdoor seating too which I'd enjoy in better weather.
2019-01-22,3,Açaí ya later has been my favorite location to get my Acai bowls but lately have been letting me down they state to close at 9:45 or 10 whichever it is but never seem to make it there I have visited the location a little over 9:30-9:40 and have been denied service a few times to top it off the times I have went late I have attempted to call at least 20 minutes in advance while on my way to verify if they are open and no one ever picks up the phone therefore I have sadly decided to switch to playabowls who actually care to pick up phone calls and close at the time they state.
2019-01-07,3,I thought these açaí bowls were mediocre at best. The açaí was too frozen and felt like I was eating tasteless froyo. The lack of topics was also disappointing. I would instead go to Makai Poke for your acai and bowl needs because they are generous with toppings and reasonably priced.
2018-11-22,3,I've fallen for the açaí fad and I love my açaí bowl especially during days when I feel bloated. In comparison to other açaí places in Hoboken, it is pretty average but nothing impressive. Normally I come here when it's pretty busy so I can't complain much since they're trying to keep the business afloat. Last time I came here around 7:45pm. After I ordered, I was handed a PRE-MADE açaí bowl. I thought it was weird since it's normally freshly made. It gets worse... the granola has a funny refrigerator taste. It was disgusting that I could only eat couple bites and threw it away. This is just bad practice.
2018-10-27,1,Bad and rude! I never wrote a review on yelp before but I have to write sth down here. Delivery was super late, we waited more than 2hours to get three acai bowls, so we called the shop and the staff said delivery person went out and delivery is running by third party company so they don't know what's going on. The delivery person arrived finally, and asked for tip!! Acai bowl was totally melted. Of course we didn't tip! It was so rude and worst delivery experience ever.
2018-10-13,2,I had asked for a smoothie, a simple kale smoothie. There was a line of people behind me and somehow everyone got their bowls before I got my order. I was waiting for over 10 minutes , they offered me to get something for free in the refrigerator because I was waiting so long. I wait five minutes more and no smoothie yet , so I ask & the worker said " sorry what was your order?" He forgot my order and I had to tell him over again. The quality of the smoothie was not good. They put ice into my smoothie , very little kale and the smoothie was very watery and didn't have taste to it. Shaka Bowls down the block is evidently better quality and quicker.
2018-10-13,4,Loved the bowls! Amazing place, pleasant staff and a amazing selection of customizable bowls for lunch. The place never seems to be too crowded and the service is quick. Good place for a quick and healthy lunch pick up on a busy day.
2018-10-01,5,Enjoying my healthy and delicious "Back to the Beach" Acai bowl ! Glad I stopped back in after spotting this place during the Hoboken Arts Street Festival. I like the sidewalk seating on a warmer day! The person at the counter was very nice with a big smile! I will be back again ! .
2018-08-26,5,I was just in for lunch and the two gentlemen that helped me were super sweet! Great customer service. Also he recommended a guava Acai that was a special not on the regular menu and it was delicious!
2018-08-09,5,This is the best Acai bowl in Jersey hands down. Think Playa Bowls but way better. They have this new mango pitaya bowl which tastes just like dragonfruit and is the best thing I've ever tasted. Friendly staff, great service, always a steady stream of customers---highly recommended!
2018-07-27,5,First time here and I'll be back! Ordered the "bring me to the beach" bowl with drizzled Nutella and it was delicious! I love that the açaí base was thick unlike others I've tried are more like smoothie, thinner base. They gave a nice amount of Nutella drizzle compared to what Playa Bowls gave me. They give the option to create your own bowl as well which is nice for someone who may be on the pickier side. Definitely want to try a smoothie next.
2018-07-27,2,Was excited to build my own smoothie only to leave with a very disappointing, $8+ smoothie. First, was informed that they were "out" of a bunch of things (all vegetables), then I watched as the employee put a very small amount of fruit--and a TON of ice--in my smoothie. The result? A completely tasteless, very expensive beverage. If I go back, will speak up if I see this happen again.
2018-07-21,2,From the pictures this looked like a great place to try. The Acai looked more like a finely crushed up ice with food coloring had no flavor at all. Was not creamy like any other Acai bowl I've had. Very disappointed basically just ate the fruit on top.
2018-07-11,5,The wait on line is well worth it. Super fresh veggies and fruit with everything you could dream up for your smoothie. Love this place. And usually great classic rock or Motown music playing
2018-07-11,5,LOVE this place!! It is one of the best Acai bowls I have ever had!! The Acai base is sweet and the fruit is fresh. The people at the counter are always friendly and helpful, too. The only downside is that it's on Washington St., so it's hard to find parking.
2018-07-05,3,Used to come here frequently, but stopped bc I noticed that the maintenance of their food area was quite messy/dirty. Even when they put the bowl together it just doesn't look appetizing; put together with very little care. I believe the açaí bowl is an art, and there are plenty of new competitors around the hoboken area that present their bowls with that philosophy as well, so I've unfortunately been taking my business elsewhere.
2018-07-03,5,I love this place!!!!!! Fastest delivery of all time. In rush hour no less!! I will be back. Perhaps, daily lol
2018-06-30,3,I tried the açaí bowl. The food is not bad, but they seem a bit unorganized. The menu is a little confusing and the food presentation is a bit messy.
2018-06-28,5,First off such a cute little place, I loved environment. I was driving around looking for a quick breakfast spot and I saw the store. Decided to stop and I don't regret it. I got a Acai bowl with strawberry, mango, and blueberries and it's probably the best bowl I've tried in a while. Definitely recommended and I'll be back.
2018-06-23,5,Absolutely love acai ya later! My fiance and I are regulars there . The staff is always beyond friendly , the bowls are always so fresh and so yummy and the price is perfect ...they also have dog treats and our pup has become a regular there too!!Thanks acai, we  you!!!
2018-06-19,5,Great place! Yummy, fast, friendly. Favorite here are diet starts today smoothie and Washington Acai bowl:))
2018-06-09,1,Consistently mess up online orders. When you call to let them know (after waiting 40 minutes for delivery), they literally say "ugh, yeah sorry I don't know what to tell you. Maybe contact seamless or the uber driver?" What??! Seamless and the uber driver are not responsible for you making the order incorrectly. Horribly run business. Would not order from here again.
2018-05-26,5,I like the pitaya bowls here. The place is clean and the staff is friendly. The price is less than some of the other places in town for similar items.  Oh, and the pitaya bowls taste great with peanut butter on top!
2018-05-17,3,I love Açaí bowl and decided to give this place a try.  The service is very good, the guys are very helpful and engaged with customers.  I ordered the "Take me to the beach" which I think is perfect for a rainy day.  It has Bananas, Pineapple and Mangos, decided to go with the Pitaya bowl and added coconut shreds and granola, topped with honey.  The bowl is very good but for $9 and change plus tips, I feel like I was eating a pineapple bowl.  There was a quarter of a banana and 3 cubes of mangos, and the rest is pineapples.  A little disappointed but it was still good enough.  Probably will not go back.  It did not take me to the beach  .
2018-05-12,5,I love there acai bowls!!!! Its is soooooooo good  definitely my favorite place!!!!there is a few different place to go to in hoboken to get acai bowl but there bowls are the best in my opinion
2018-05-12,4,Cute little spot with refreshing Acai bowls. This place is well located and serves up a nice cool treat. I've been here before for dessert and was very impressed with the taste. My only minor critique is that I do think it's a little pricy. However, the quality of the ingredients does seem high, so perhaps you get what you pay for! They are also good about offering discounts through events and websites. Will definitely be back
2018-05-04,5,Ordered from here a few times and we love their bowls. The coconut blend bowls are my favorite. A must try if you're in the area. Will keep ordering from here.
2018-04-29,5,I love this place! I've had acai bowls throughout the city, but this one is definitely my favorite. I really like the consistency of this bowl - it's not too watery like other acai bowls I've had. The service is always friendly and they offer a loyalty card so you can work towards a free bowl. The price is good compared to the other places I've been to.
2018-04-14,3,These bowls are delicious. 3 different options offering different a variation of fruit combinations. I always get the peanut butter spread on mine. Cheap and tasty, great for a breakfast option.Loaded with sugar and carbs but offer a healthy alternative for a pre or post workout meal.
2018-04-01,4,Decent-sized Acai bowls for 8.99 - got the pineapple, banana, strawberry combo with coconut shavings and chia seeds topped with honey. Yummy!! Bonus, pleasant staff.
2018-03-31,5,I absolutely love the bowls here! I used to eat at Shaka Bowl and I thought I just didn't like acai. When I came in here the staff gave me a sample of their delicious acai and my life has been forever changed. Many other places use the disgusting Sambazon packets, but I'm glad to say this place does not! Their acai is flash frozen FROM BRAZIL! The staff is also always so friendly to their customers and you can tell they truly care. I put any bad review this place has TO SHAME!!!
2018-03-26,4,This was my first acai bowl and i loved it! The base and granola is really yummy and all the fruits were pretty fresh. I think it helps to go in the morning for fresher fruit. Btw the prices have changed and all bowls are $8.99 and almond butter is 75 cents extra. For a big bowl fully filled its definately worth it.
2018-03-25,2,Honestly this place is very mediocre. They use frozen acai and the pitaya is legitimately bad (frozen, icy, tastes like a slushie). For a business that specializes in acai bowl, you'd think they would care more about using high quality product. Location is really their only advantage but Shaka Bowl in Hoboken is so much better, and is opening on Washington St. as well.
2018-03-04,2,Just ordered a Pitaya bowl and a Acai bowl via grub hub for $26. Acai bowl was legit, super thick and creamy. The Pitaya bowl was probably the worst I've ever had. This was probably our 4th time here, so comparing previous visits and other companies. The Pitaya had no flavor and seemed more like an icy with pink dye. Without a doubt it was way watered down and frozen. Won't be ordering from here again.
2018-02-28,5,Had an acai bowl for the first time ever and I must say "acai ya later" made the experience a great  one. I rushed in a  few minutes before closing and the employee was so helpful patient and kind. Such a great experience and delicious acai bowl. Can't wait to go back for more.
2018-02-25,5,Love this place - perfect pick me up before or after a workout. Staff is fantastic. They have a simple menu, but that's prob because they customize bowls for each customer. It's a simple concept - choose your base Acai or Pitaya, choose your fruit(s), add some toppings (ie peanut butter, Nutella, granola, honey). They also have smoothies, juices and a few other items to give you good fuel. There is seating, but I think only outside. They freeze the Acai base which is nice for me because it keeps until I get back to Bergen Point (Bayonne) about 8 miles down the road.  So yummy - give this place a try. Kids love it too!
2018-02-23,3,Maybe because I'm spoiled that I have Playa Bowls right by my house but this place is OK. I order ubereats from here all the time when I want to do something more light for lunch at work. Quality isn't that great for what you're paying. I got the Washington street bowl with pitaya and the pitaya is always ice frozen. Annoying because it ends up being a waste. Do not order smoothies. I'm not sure wtf it is that they gave me the 3x I ordered one but it had absolutely NO taste. Watered down peanut butter. With smoothies you should taste the richness of the fruit. This was dirty water. Gross. Everything is just very mediocre. People should go check out any playabowl location if you're interested in authentic rich fresh fruit bowls plus they have way more yummier options. Don't recommend this place
2018-01-08,3,I've been a huge fan of smoothie fruit bowls - specifically the pitaya bowls. All the bowls here were 7.99 and came with unlimited drizzle. I thought that was a big perk.  I got the Washington bowl which was pitaya, pineapples, strawberries, bananas, coconut flakes, and granola. The fruits were nice and ripe.  I opted for the agave drizzle on top. What I didn't like about this place is that they do not blend the pitaya before putting it in the bowl. It is frozen and scooped into the bowl. I think it would taste a lot better if it was more of a smoothie-like texture. Since it was just a scoop, I found it rather hard to eat because it was icy. I ended up not finishing the pitaya portion of the bowl.However, I did think the interior of the place was very cute and the service was good.
2017-12-03,5,These dudes make one hell of a smoothie. They use all Pure Acai, no fillers. Nitro coffee is on point!
2017-11-26,5,A = AffordableB = Bustin with sugarsC= CheapD = DelishE = Easy Going!F = FunG = Gigantic portionsH = "Healthy"-ish.I = I wish I had it when it was supposed to be delivered. (boo seamless)J = Jolly Staff K = Kick-ass loyalty Kards ;)
2017-11-07,4,This place makes you feel like you are somewhere tropical. Very trendy and friendly service! Their bowls are different than most that you find because the açaí part of the bowl is açaí purée only instead of what you usually find that's mixed with milk and other fruits. I think it'll be a preference thing on which you prefer, it's a very strong flavor. The BEST part is that you can drizzle almond butter on top which makes it that much better. They also have Nutella and pb to drizzle on which would make it perfect for a dessert kind of meal later in the day. Definitely worth the trip!
2017-11-05,5,I got the PB&J smoothie with protein added in ($6 and change, unbeatable) and the staff was super nice and was accommodating when I asked for almond butter instead of PB. Great post-gym protein smoothie after my workout at NYSC down the block. The Acai bowls looked excellent, I'll have to try one next time. Definitely the place to go for a healthy and fresh snack in Hoboken!
2017-11-04,5,Good idea and implementation.  Fresh and quick.  I actually prefer the Açai a bit melted but I still enjoyed the frozen.  You can do away with the- "Açai Ya Later" to the customers, it's superficial and unnecessary ‍
2017-10-20,3,My boyfriend and I had high hopes for this acai bowl spot! Especially because Hoboken is devoid of many healthy eateries. Unfortunately I was disappointed in the consistency and taste of the acai. The scoopable acai was too frozen - like hard ice cream scoops and overly sweet. The toppings were of good variety. I hope to try this place again once they get the formula right. They should try adding more health items such as cold pressed juices and wheatgrass shots.
2017-10-15,4,EDIT Made to Review and RatingAfter posting the review below with pictures, an Acai Ya Later staff member messaged me promptly, and kindly. I appreciate them reaching out and understand info may be lost when communicating through multiple channels/people. They have graciously offered to refund my order and have offered a new bowl on top. Thank you Acai Ya Later for responding to my experience!I've ordered from Acai Ya Later about 5 times now and the acai bowls are solid. On my most recent order Sunday October 8th, I ordered another bowl but was shocked to bite into a hard piece of plastic. The plastic piece was thick and seemed to have come off some wrapping as an edge of a perforated seal. luckily I didn't hurt myself or choke on the plastic piece. I called the restaurant (via downtown yogurts phone number) and spoke to a girl who I reported the incident to. She offered a refund and to connect me with her management. She politely apologized and took my name number and email address. I have not been contacted by them since or given a refund or any form of communication. While I have no complaints about the taste of their food, biting into hard plastic is dangerous and not hearing from management in over a week is discouraging. The lady who handled my call was very apologetic but management was never heard from and could have closed the situation out much better.  I'll not be ordering from here again because I haven't heard back after sharing my personal information, offering to share pictures, and even saving the plastic piece and original container.
2017-10-13,5,I LOVE "Acai Ya Later"! I have been here many times. I would like to start off by "Seconding" the earlier comment about getting a Loyalty Card. It is completely worth it. After you come here once, you will keep coming back.I recommend the Washington Street Bowl with Honey drizzled on top!This little shop gives off a kind, refreshing tone - something extremely needed this close to the big city.The workers here are thoughtful, caring, and considerate. They are always so sweet, and love to promote their store by saying "Acai Ya Later" as you leave. I wanted to give a special shoutout to Hisham. I went here a few weeks ago, when he was at the cashier. I had a few questions about their Acai Bowls, and he always answered with a kind tone, never got exhausted with me. He is the type of person who wants to get to know his customers. When he asked me for my name, I gave another - just because I didn't want to spell it out. I explained this to him, and he was genuinely interested in my name. He asked what it was and then proceeded to guess how to spell it while I waited for my bowl. He was very kind. We then proceeded to talk about names that have unique spelling.All in all, Hisham was a sweet person who was genuinely interested in helping his customers and was focused on having a great worker-customer relationship with everyone who went through those doors.Thank you, Hisham!Acai Ya Later, guys!
2017-10-04,3,I've only been to the downtown Jersey City location inside Downtown Yogurt, so my review is based on that. Honestly, it's not the best acai bowl I've ever had - it's probably one of the worst, but in that, I'm not saying it's bad. It's good and I have been a return customer several times, but I can make a better acai bowl at home myself. I find their prices to be steep for the size of the bowl - everywhere else I've gone in Manhattan, Queens, and Jersey City is about the same price for a bowl nearly twice the size. Also, every time I get one, half of the acai is still in frozen chunks and a little unpleasant to eat. They have a consistency that is more icy than creamy.I do like their topping options, though and that you can add as many drizzles as you want on top. They portion of the drizzles is more of a heaping spoonful, which is great.The owners (I think), the two bearded men, are SUPER friendly and helpful and make you want to come back.
2017-10-03,5,I discovered Acai Ya Later at a festival in Manhattan over the summer. It was an incredibly hot day and I wanted something that was fresh and not hot or fried. Eating something healthy and refreshing at a festival can be a hard thing to find so their booth stood out to me from the other vendors.It was the first time I ever had an acai bowl. I had heard of it before but wasn't sure what to expect. It turned out to be awesome! I loved that I could customize my acai bowl. I topped it with fruit, granola, and honey. It was exactly what I needed on this sweltering day. It picked me up and kept me going for the rest of the day. I will definitely order here again when I see them a festival. Acai Ya Later!
2017-09-22,4,Conveniently located on Washington St. right near the path station!Limited options, but sometimes that's a good thing if you're an indecisive person.The pineapple bliss is good($7.99)There are three options for acai/pitaya bowl($7.99). There not bad, also portion size is fair. They also have smoothies, working with the limited options of toppings and drizzles.Overall, friendly staff and for an healthy alternative for ice cream, it's a good option on Washington.
2017-09-20,3,The service here was extremely slow.  There was a man there who appeared to be the manager/owner(whatever ) of some sort who sat down while he saw the poor guy making our stuff. It was clear this kid needed help. The bowl was alright. I just wish they had more options !
2017-09-16,5,Most delicious and hearty acai bowl I have found in the area, and for a couple bucks less than others places.Service is fast and people are nice.
2017-09-15,5,I love that they don't cut their acai with other ingredients it's 100% pure. They always say hello and goodbye with a smile & always make sure I'm happy with my order. I love this place!
2017-09-08,5,Tried the pitaya bowl here - loved it. Good customer service. Nice atmosphere with outdoor seating. I can't wait to go back!
2017-09-07,1,What a disaster. I ordered the BRING ME TO THE BEACH bowl with acai as the base. I could barely eat it because the acai was not blended at all. I spent majority of the time breaking up the iced chunks. Portion was also really small for a $8 bowl.
2017-08-29,5,Huge fan of this place. Great and friendly staff, solid bowl options and fresh fruit. Awesome location in the middle of Hoboken within walking distance to everything. Would highly recommend!
2017-08-24,5,Awesome. Every time I go here, I not only get great priced, healthy, yummy food, but I always leave with positive vibes from the welcoming staff. The vegan wraps are creative and delicious, but the smoothies and bowls are my favorite. I always look forward to coming here and I'm happy they're in the neighborhood :)
2017-08-22,1,Wow....just wow!  Who would have guessed you got free bugs with your food. But let's start with the bland soggy food first. I guess their idea of fresh is to buy in already prepared food and let it sit around for a week before it is served to guests. Then let's sprinkle some stale rancid tasting seeds and nuts on top of it, and for a kicker let's make sure there is a maggot for you to find a minute into your meal(extra protein?). These guys have no clue what they are doing. And obviously have a fly infestation if there are maggots in the food.
2017-08-17,2,Rare day off work so stopped in midday to get two Berry Me Baby's for me and wife. Shop seemed crowded with employees - two dudebros outside and girl with earbuds taking up the indoor table, nobody behind counter. I was illegally parked so after 20 seconds of being ignored I turned around and left. The employee inside noticed and called outside to the two guys to alert them, but didnt get up or take out the earbuds, and they didn't respond or maybe didn't hear. Shame because I was 3 bowls away from getting a free one - anybody want my loyalty card?
2017-08-12,5,Acai ya later is by far the best acai bowl I've ever had around...and let me tell you, I've tried them all in the area (hoboken, nyc, Long Island). Very authentic and amazing customer service, also well priced. I find myself craving their bowls on a daily basis. Needless to say I'm addicted! Very excited they are adding delivery soon too!
2017-08-12,5,BEST ACAI BOWL. I was super excited to try this place out after I heard such great things. First of all, the acai here is ONLY acai. They don't cut it apple juice or bananas to make it "Sweeter", so when I pay for acai, I GET ACAI~~ That makes me so excited because the bowl I know is fresh and naturally sweet. It also has the texture of a sorbet/ice cream, so it makes for a nice dessert/ actual food. I stopped getting acai bowls for a while because I felt like I was just eating a smoothie (yuck), but this texture has me wild. Their food is fresh and always made to order. I love topping it with almond butter and coconut, as it adds the savory and crunch texture to it. Will be back!
2017-07-25,5,Hands down, this is the best acai bowl around! I work in NYC and I'm used to higher prices and lower quality service. No one else in the town and tri-state area can compare. Do yourself a favor and stop in for a healthy yet delicious treat!
2017-07-24,5,This place is absolutely the best!! Last week I worked long hours outside and that brutal heat, and they were an absolute blessing. I stubbled upon them( nicest most friendly staff in town) and there acai bowl hit the spot! I felt like I was on a tropical island and no longer working in hell. Your local construction dude thanks guys again
2017-07-23,5,You can't beat the prices, quality of the food, and service here. I love that the acai is pure Brazilian acai (no blending with fruit juices here!) and it has an almost icy consistency which is super refreshing. You can't get a cheaper acai bowl anywhere else, and I love that the toppings are fresh and the drizzles are unlimited! Grab a loyalty card and start racking up those bowls for a free one-I've already been back 4 times.
2017-07-20,5,Friendly staff  - every single person in the store greeted me, not just the person serving me. A few choices of bowls with acai or pitaya base, as well as smoothies and a few other food options. I actually like that their menu is simple. Best price for an acai bowl that I've seen in Hoboken, and it was delicious. I'll definitely be back often.
2017-07-17,5,incredible! the guys that own it could not have been nicer. the food is fantastic! the best part...$7.99 is an incredible price for an acai bowl. GREAT place!
2017-07-17,5,My husband and I love acai bowls. We first had them in Hawaii couple years ago and we have been on the look out for the best "mainland" bowl. So we were beyond excited to see Acai Ya Later open shop in Hoboken.First of all, I prefer my acai bowls with the acai base only and not blended with other fruit and milk/water. My preference stems from the fact that I can't eat bananas (which is the usual fruit that is blended with the acai) and I don't like the texture/taste of the acai once blended with other fruit. Lucky for me, Acai ya later doesn't use a blended base. YAY!The bowls have an acai base with granola and fresh fruit added. You can add a drizzle. I prefer the peanut butter or honey. My favorite bowl is the Berry Me, Baby and my husband likes the Washington street bowl. They also have smoothies and drinks. I haven't tried their smoothies yet but I did try the pineapple bliss.. which is served in a pineapple with an umbrella. It was delicious and picture worthy. The service is great and quick - everyone is friendly. Definitely one of our go to spots for a quick, healthy snack.
2017-07-12,2,I ate half of my food and threw it out. It was that bad. I feel like half of the hype is the vibe/ novelty items (like the pineapple bliss) and the fact that it's a lot closer than say Shaka Bowl.I've come to love acai bowls. I decided to give this new place a try and was desperate to like it since it's so much closer. The menu is VERY limited. The only extras are coconut, granola, and chia/flax seeds. The menu is not conducive to customization whatsoever. It should be listed by base, fruit, and add on, and then have suggested combinations. Other offerings include banana ice cream, but honestly folks, Amanda's Bananas at Pier 13 serves award winning banana ice cream with enough topping selections to make you scream. Save yourself the disappointment and get it from there. The bowl is MUCH smaller than what you'll get elsewhere, although it costs just as much. As some other reviewers have mentioned, the acai is NOT fresh. It's frozen lumps. Mine wasn't flavorless, but it had that so-sweet-it's-rotten flavor. While the fruit on top was fresh, there was so little in comparison to the frozen lush. The granola was sparse and stuffed at the bottom. I ended up just eating the peanut butter and honey with fruit and throwing the rest out because it tasted off. I also ordered the My Diet Starts Today smoothie. Not great, not terrible, but definitely could improve. By omitting ingredients such as banana or avocado, the smoothie was essentially a juice. It tasted like watered down canned pineapple juice. Paid an extra dollar for protein. After drinking 1/3, I also threw this out because it made me feel sick. A "healthy" green smoothie isn't just pineapple and spinach, cmon guys. There has to be an ideal ratio of healthy fats and protein. I was not told the price of my order, and am concerned that, like another reviewer experienced, I was charged for a tip I did not consent to. They did not even prompt me to sign after swiping my card. Concerning. Not willing to sacrifice quality for trendiness or convenience of location.
2017-07-12,5,Great place ! Filling and generous acai bowl, tastes great, friendly service and great value for money! Keep it up!
2017-07-11,5,If you want an acai bowl this is the place to go! If you don't want one, then you should come here anyway to experience the deliciousness! The bowls are filling, fun, and refreshing. The bowl combinations are endless, but no need to feel intimidated if this is your first bowl - you truly can't go wrong (if you want a suggestion the Washington St bowl with some mango and almond butter gets my thumbs up... I'm going to be dreaming about it for awhile!) The owner is friendly and helpful, he creates an enjoyable and easygoing atmosphere that made us want to stay. A definite go-to for these hot summer days!
2017-07-09,3,I would have given them five stars because it's absolutely delicious, however, I was totally peeved that they added tip to my bill without my consent. It was a nominal amount ($1+) so it wasn't about the money, it just felt like a little bit of a violation. So if you go, enjoy the deliciousness just make sure to see what they're charging you before you leave!
2017-07-02,1,I was really excited to see an acai place pop up downtown.  I've had acai bowls numerous times. I watched them make the bowl realizing there was no blender being used. The acai was scooped out of a container.  When I got the bowl the acai was frozen and tasted like you were eating a shaved ice MINUS ANY FLAVOR.   I think freezing it might have lost its flavor, who knows but it wasn't good.  Additionally why would you put all the granola (which also wasn't good) to the bottom so I have to dig thru ice to get to it.  Come on guys let's do a bowl the right way.  Hit up Shaka Bowl- they know how it's done.
2017-06-30,5,Awesome addition to Washington St! Perfect place to stop by for a healthy breakfast or after work snack. The bowls are a great value and customizable, too - a huge plus. I'm hoping they will offer seasonal fruit selections! I had the Coco Loco smoothie today which was delicious and refreshing. The owners and staff are what really makes this place stand out, though. So happy they are now a permanent spot in Hoboken.
2017-06-30,3,I was very excited to visit this new location as it's right across the street from our home. I agree with the previous reviewer regarding the frozen, unmixed açai. I love the unlimited drizzles, however the açai ice at the bottom made the bowl hard to mix until I waited for it to melt. This place could be easily five stars if they blended the açai with some liquid to create a smoother consistency (as are the directions on any frozen açai blend). Looking forward to this change hopefully!
2017-06-26,5,Best acai bowl in Hoboken. Ingredients are very fresh, menu options are great, and they're fast even during lunch - all for less than other acai bowls. $7.99. Highly recommend. Other pros:- they have a free loyalty card- bowls are totally "insta-worthy" - employees are all great
2017-06-24,5,Awesome new addition to Washington St! My girlfriend and I swung through on their first weekend, and, man, were we glad we did! For a great price of $7.99, you get a heaping açaí bowl with all sorts of healthy goodies to add on and make it your own creation. Plus, since it was the grand opening, we got a couple Pineapple Blisses for free - it's a drink served in a pineapple with seltzer and agave - and I bet some rum would go great with it if you bring it home ;)All in all, Hoboken has a great açaí bowl spot now, and I'd be surprised if they don't have an uptown location soon because (calling it now!) it's gonna be big.
2017-06-23,3,I just read every review below and i feel like i got cheated out of the experience. I'm giving three stars, because i don't want to negatively impact this new spot. I'm an acai bowl enthusiast and have tried many places including where the hype started; on the west coast. Here in NJ, i've tried 5 other places that make bowls.          I came in with my 9 month old son. I was greeted by two young girls and ordered a Washington St acai bowl and grabbed a buffalo chickpea wrap. Thinking back, i don't remember hearing a blender. I did however, see the girl making my bowl take out a tub of frozen acai blend. I paid and went to eat it outside in hopes of giving my son some.          The acai was frozen scoops, as if it were ice cream. It wasn't freshly blended; almost like acai ice crystals. It reminded me of the first time i made a bowl. I had to add more liquid and actually blend it to get a better consistency. Maybe she wasn't trained properly and just thought that is how you serve it but i ended up taking it to go, and driving home, waiting for it to melt a little. Maybe ill come back and give it another try with a different employee. THE WRAP WAS ON POINT THOUGH!!
2017-06-23,5,I just made my second stop in Acai Ya Later this week. This is by far my new favorite spot for an acai bowl, as it has the perfect price point and is an ideal treat for the summer. The bowls are made fresh to order and served with good humour as well as a smile. I work down the block and foresee many more visits here, totally taking advantage of the customer loyalty card.
2017-06-22,5,Walked in and received an amazing welcome from Brian, Mike and Matt. Seriously props to the guys running this place - them alone would keep me coming back. I got Berry Me, Baby and was able to customize without being overcharged. The fruit, smoothie and toppings are all delicious! Can't wait to come again! Congrats guys - awesome addition to Hoboken!!!
2017-06-22,5,Seriously one of the best Acai bowl that I've tried! My brother & I shared a bowl cause we just wanted to try so the guy gave us extra Acai. Excellent service & the Acai bowl was so good! Highly recommend this place. Definitely coming back again.
2017-06-21,5,My husband and I wanted something refreshing for dinner on a hot summer's night.  To our luck, Acai Ya Later had opened just a few days prior.  We ordered two Acai bowls and they hit the spot!  The bowls are quite a large/good serving, came with granola plenty of toppings and a good 2 scoops of acai.  Service couldn't have been friendlier, met one of the owners who was working late on a Sunday.  Highly recommend the Washington Street Bowl!One recommendation - get granola without raisins.  They get really hard when the frozen Acai is on top of them.  Otherwise, everything was delish!
2017-06-20,5,Exactly what Hoboken was missing. Great option for a healthy meal that leaves you feeling refreshed because of all the fruit in each bowl. Highly recommend the Washington Street Bowl, with Agave.
2017-06-20,5,Huge fan of this place! Fresh food, friendly service, and a great walk in atmosphere. I have been anxiously awaiting their grand opening based on the product that I had last year when they were serving up fresh foods from their cart near the path last year, and boy did they not disappoint. Their expanded menu really makes a nice touch to their brick and mortar location - but dont worry, their carts are still in action at festivals and markets nearby! Fav things: healthy, delicious, priced right for the product, generous portions (I mean unlimited drizzles), locally owned business, fun, variety of offerings (acai, pitaya, drinks, smoothies, banana desserts, vegan food, and more) inventive, and most of all tasty! Plan to make many visits - you are bound to leave this place with a huge smile on your face! In fact, I am smiling just writing this review thinking about my experience there this very night! I'll acai ya later for another "Nothing but Nanners" soon (you know I couldn't write acai bowl).
2017-06-19,5,The perfect spot to grab refreshing bite to eat in Hoboken.  All of the bowls and smoothies are delicious and reasonably priced.  Would also highly recommend the banana ice cream with fruit and unlimited drizzles!  The staff extremely courteous and personable.  Acai Ya Later is a must try spot when in town.
2017-06-19,5,I'm a fan! Reminds me of one of my fave places down at the beach. Good selection of acai or pitaya bowls and smoothies. They also have fridge with some healthy snacks (i.e. Chia pudding, wraps). Staff was super friendly and helpful. Wish the place was a little bigger so that there was some seating inside or out but I'll be back regardless. I think cold brew or iced coffee would be a nice addition.
2017-06-19,5,I had my first acai bowl today. I heard about this fruit filled bowl being absolutely delicious, so my expectations were high. My bowl was made to order with some extras and I absolutely loved it. Peanut butter topping...YES! Nutella...Wht not? The staff was friendly and the price was right.
2017-06-19,5,I live in Hoboken and have been waiting for this place to open up. I tried the Washington street bowl today and loved every bite. The customer service was spectacular and loved that everyone had a smile on their faces. At the end I was walking out and saw someone holding their pineapple bliss and I had to have one. I bought one for my kids and they loved it. I highly recommend stopping by.
2017-06-19,5,This place is awesome!!! I've always enjoyed an acai bowl but this has been hands down the best one I ever had. The ingredients taste super fresh and I love the menu options and toppings they offer. In addition to the bowls, their store seems well kept and clean. Service is quick and efficient too. It's such a tropical, zen vibe in there - I love it!!!  I don't live in Hoboken but visit friends there frequently. I will say, I'll be visiting a lot more now thanks to Acai Ya Later. Highly recommend you give it a try!!!
2017-06-17,4,Brand new business that just opened up on Washington yesterday, and I started/established it on yelp-hooray!  We swing by after seeing the announcement on Instagram for one of their infamous Pineapple Bliss drinks Pro's: healthy, fun options like the drink above, available bowls (obviously), and a few other options.  Good news: the carry Salt & Seed prepared foods in their refrigerator case!!!!Con's: limited menu-duplicative of a lot of places that already exist (Shaka bowl, etc).  They aren't any cheaper, so unless you're really in the mood for the pineapple Bliss, you might chose somewhere closer.Worth a stop on a hot summer day!
