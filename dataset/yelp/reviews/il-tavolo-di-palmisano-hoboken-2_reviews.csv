2021-11-06,5,Il Tavalo...or the Table...is an absolute gem of restaurant specializing in outstanding Italian cuisine.  Located on 7th and Clinton Street in Hoboken, it offers both inside and outside dining year round. Our party of four was welcomed at the door and sat in a beautifully curtained off area..in the main dining room.  The room is anchored by a magnificent table..set in the middle of the room...lite by a gorgeous contemporary chandelier.   A really excellent arrangement for a birthday dinner or family gathering.Our gracious server took our drink order and our delightful evening began. For starters my table ordered succulent mussels in a white wine sauce.  Perfectly prepared meatballs.Delicious fried calamari and an outstanding stuffed peppers dish..prepared with cheese..that everyone who loves peppers should try.For the main course the shrimp and chicken scampi over risotto was delectable.  A special for the evening was the shrimp fra diavolo entree over Cappelli. The dish is prepared with just the right spiciness that make it simply perfect. The short rib ragu over pasta must truly be ordered, at least once, that's how delicious this dish was. The award winner of the evening, and to be the lucky person who ordered it, is the pork chop with peppers. It is the largest, juiciest, perfectly prepared and presented pork chop you will ever have in your life. (I'm not kidding)There's a excellent array of desserts to choose from.  The really outstanding dessert for us was the pumpkin cheesecake.   Perfection!The restaurant offers a full bar, excellent wine selections and an assortment of special cocktails to fit any occasion. The restaurant is beautifully designed and decorated.Robert, who I believe is the manager,Is a truly gracious host.  He stopped by a number of times throughout dining evening to say hello and then to check on how are evening was coming along. A great night out!Bill Hayes,November, 2021
2021-10-30,3,I was Introduced to IL Tavolo by My Good Friend Giseli.  She Had Been There for Dinner Several Times, and She Highly Recommended the Place and it Had The BIG FOUR -- Great FOOD, SERVICE, AMBIANCE & DRINKS!  In Researching The Restaurant I saw that they Had a Brunch.  Her & I went there Several Months Ago.  At that Time We Said We Have to Come Here With Our Group Of Friends  That We Basically Have Not Seen ALL TOGETHER  Since Before the Pandemic As The Case May Be..... So We Planned to Do This Gathering on Sunday, October 24, 2021 at 1PM.  There Were 9 Of Us, And ADMITTEDLY We Are a VERY LOUD Group When ALL 9 of Us are in the SAME ROOM..  5 of Us Came From NY, While the Other Four, Including the Main Hostess  are From NJ. By the Time we ALL Got together at the Restaurant, it was 1:30.  The Jersey Crew got there first, and Actually Warned the Staff that We Would Be LOUD & BOISTEROUS!  We sat in the Back Room at a Long Middle Table, And the Restaurant Lived Up To it's Forte Of Service, Food, & Service--Our Waiter (MATT) Was FANTASTIC, So Much So we Gave Him Extra Tip on Top of the gratuity that was automatically Added.  OUR GROUP, As Promised WAS VERY LOUD & BOISTEROUS & HAPPY, So Much so, that Several Parties that came To The Back Room were Reseated in the Front Room.  We WERE NOT DRUNK, Or RUDE, JUST FUNNY, BOISTEROUS & LOUD!! In Our Time There(2-1/2-3 Hours) we Spent a TOTAL of NEARLY $900.  ALL Was OK, Until we Were Told That We NEEDED to Use Our INSIDE Voices, in NOT Such a Nice Way by the Assistant Manager.  Hearing that Kinda Deflated Us, and there was No More Fun To Be Had, Had it NOT Been for that RUDE COMMENT, We Would Have Probably Stayed Longer and Had a Few More Cocktails....This Place is Great For the Big Four, But If You Intend on HAVING A LARGE HAPPY PARTY & GATHERING, This is NOT The Place For IT!!
2021-10-24,3,Been to this place many times before and brought many friends there .. the food is simply excellent and the waiters are amazing . However today's experience wasn't exactly the best .. it started great but than it was interrupted by a sour person (Robert / the manager ) . I was there with a group of 9 people who came from far away just to have the experience, we are a very LOUD and fun group , we laugh a lot and joke a lot . Some people decided they needed to seat in the front room because we were actually a little loud . But that's ok , is not if they were loosing the costumer , they were just seated at a different side of the restaurant because we were obviously to loud for them . And that is ok because everyone in our group was just looking for a great time . Well 3 hours and $900 later we were told we needed to use our inner voice because we were loud . Well .. no one was drunk or causing any problems so to be honest I didn't understand the attitude. I would like to know who spends $900 in 3 hours . So considering the fact I brought all these people there today and others before , I must say I was disappointed with the non sense . Next time we will have to reassess our options as where we want to spend so much money and such little time . If you want great did you can go there .. but if you want a great time than consider going else where .
2021-10-23,2,I ordered the Carbonara through Uber eats and what was received is not traditional Carbonara. It was more like fettuccine alfredo which was very disappointing considering the dish cost $25. The description didn't say "creamy" sauce on the menu, it said a "dreamy Parmesan sauce" which is completely different if you know what Carbonara sauce tastes like. Real Italians do not add cream to Carbonara...Also, this dish requires the egg to be part of the sauce which it was not. If you like this pasta dish the traditional way, I would recommend to look elsewhere or to make it yourself.
2021-10-03,4,Ordered the carbonara for delivery. It was a sizeable portion and came slathered in a rich, creamy sauce. The linguini was cooked to just the right level, and the pancetta and peas were tasty and colorful. The fried egg on top added a nice touch. Perhaps the sauce could be a little bit lighter.
2021-09-21,4,Haven't been to this location since Clinton social was around. Decided I wanted a quaint Italian dinner and stopped in last minute for a solo dinner.  It was Friday night and the restaurant was not overly crowded. I sat outside on the side of restaurant and the set up was very cute with lights around. Let me start with the staff. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive. There were several different servers that came by to ensure my water was filled, my wine was full, and my food was to my liking. To eat I started off with Bruschetta Board. I got the Sausage, Tomato, and Oven Roasted Tomato with ricotta. All were very good. They were on toast and was the perfect small starter. For entree, the server recommended the Breaded Chicken Cutlets which I loved. The dish was a good portion size. It had burrata and balsamic as well as arugula and Roasted peppers. I truly enjoyed it. It was the perfect combination of flavors. I definitely will return and try some other appetizers and entrees. The menu looked pretty good and I heard others raving about their food.
2021-09-20,5,A Hoboken hidden Gem for sure! We went for dinner last night - food was incredible. Had the stuffed rigatoni. Really amazing- the staff was extremely nice. Shout out to Dante who really had an amazing personality and made us laugh. The owner Frank came over to ask how everything was and if they can improve anything which we really enjoyed. He is doing a great job and we are so happy this place is right around the block from our house. Stop thinking about it just go!!! We will definitely be back soon. Bravo  great local place!
2021-09-16,5,Great Food , Great Service , lovely Ambience !We made a reservation for 8 pm and we're seated right away on arrival .We got the bruschetta Board : Sausage , Artichoke Hearts , oven roasted tomato and Prosciutto di ParmaAlong with a bottle of Chianti.Artichoke and Sausage were my fav !! We experimented with the Fried Burratta and so glad we did ! Absolutely delicious I got the shrimp Tavolo for my main .It is served on a bed of pesto risotto . It was light and yummy .I just wish we had bread to soak up the wine sauce .My husband got the Aglio o olio with breaded chicken. The chicken was delicious. The almond cake for dessert was great too . A little too sweet for my liking but my partner enjoyed it a lot .The outdoor seating was really nice and  the weather was great ! Service - Quick ! Quantity is fairly good especially for the appetizers.Would definitely come back to try the other things on their menu :)
2021-09-12,5,Had a very nice meal here. Food portions were generous and staff was in general very friendly. Will return.
2021-09-05,4,For the most part, the food is pretty good. I definitely don't recommend the linguini with clams. The chopped clams on top were overcooked and the dish was pretty tasteless. I exchanged it (which I NEVER do!) for the Short Rib Ragu with Orecchiette which was delicious.
2021-08-28,5,This restaurant is fantastic. We thoroughly enjoyed every portion of the meal the ambiance and service were top notch!  We will definitely revisit in the near future.
2021-08-28,5,We came here a few months ago for brunch and wow, we are not from this area, but already thinking about when we can come back. The brunch here was awesome, so flavorful, and just a must go, if you are in the mood for some gooood, decadent brunch food. We ordered the bruschetta board because we saw a lot of reviewers order this. We got the tomato bruschetta and the Prosciutto Di Parma bruschetta. The tomato bruschetta gave a powerful garlic but tomato-y punch and was refreshing. The bruschetta bread was crunchy, but soaked in all the juices well, which made it SOO ADDICTIVELY GOOD. We also got the prosciutto, which was so creamy, paired with the ricotta cheese. We wanted to order more! For entrees, we ordered the potato hash with sausage gravy and topped with a sunny side up egg. This dish is so decadent, and creamy, and just full of goodness. It was not too creamy, where it was overpowering, but it was creamy enough to coat the potatoes so well. The potatoes in this dish were really crispy and thin, but also really flavorful because the creamy gravy coated it really well.  I am still thinking about how decadent this dish was. The portion size was not crazy big, so it can def. fill up 1 person.We also ordered the Frittata. The egg was fluffy and creamy in the middle, which was flavorful and packed with ingredients. Def. coming back here again!!
2021-08-28,5,A wonderful experience! The food was delicious and the service was some of the best I've had post-Covid. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but the stuffed rigatoni (with some extra sauce) was my favorite. We didn't feel rushed and the manager came over to check in as well as clean up plates, which I appreciated. Will definitely be my go-to place the next time I'm in Hoboken.
2021-08-17,5,We had an absolutely AMAZING experience here. The food was just wonderful and the staff was so great. Definitely on the top of the list for restaurants in Hoboken.
2021-08-16,5,Food:  Well above average and everything was delicious.    We had the La Nonna and carbonara and the burrata appetizers. Plates cleaned. Service:  Superb. I am not a stickler with service, but it was nice not having to ask for our waters being refilled.  Attentive throughout the meal. They also were wonderful to the kids.  They even brought them toys to take home at the end of the meal.  If you're looking for a date spot or somewhere to take the family for Italian home cooking flavor this is the spot.
2021-08-13,5,Really really good. Def one if not the best for Italian in hobo. Meals were good portions, delicious and service was great. Pasta was cooked perfectly and nice heavy sauce creamy sauce. Highly recommend!
2021-08-07,5,Shrimp and Chicken Scampi is to die for; heaven on a plate. The service is top notch. Drinks are great!  I truly can't say enough about this "Diamond" in Hoboken. Try it now before it becomes hard to get a table.
2021-08-05,5,Found this place by accident when attending a local festival. Festival was too crowded so we walked down the block and stopped in to grab dinner. I was blown away. I had with me another adult and two small children (1 & 3). We devoured everything, kid's orders also! We started with the stuffed long peppers--yummy. For the kids we ordered just basic buttered noodles and chicken tenders but they were done super well, not frozen like other places. The chicken was actual filets that were pounded out and cut in strips with a light batter (served with delicious red sauce for dipping) and I don't know what they did with the buttered noodles but they were really tasty! For the adult mains, we had the short ribs (I am still thinking about how great they were) and the stuffed rigatoni with vodka sauce. There wasn't a drop of food left. All wonderful!
2021-07-31,5,We came here for dinner with friends. It has a very friendly and warm feel to it. We really enjoyed our food, ordered burrata bread for appetisers, orecchiette pasta and summer sauce pasta for dinner. Everything was good and nothing to complain about. Service was great as well. Its a little on the pricier side. We were a party of 4 and got a bill of around $220 including drinks and tip. Will come back again and will recommend to friends too.
2021-07-31,5,Absolutely delicious hand made pasta and Italian meals! My boyfriend has to abide by a low carb diet, and this is the perfect spot, as they have many entrees that are healthful but also filling. He got the breaded chicken cutlets and i got the sausage and broccoli rabe pasta. I will definitely be back again, this time with my whole family as it seems like a great family spot!
2021-07-26,5,Excellent Italian. Not cookie cutter and each dish was original and fresh. The wait staff was on top of it and they really hustled!This will be a regular visit for me!
2021-07-26,4,Really enjoyed our first dining experience here. Really good service and food. The Manager here really makes it 1st rate. I had the Carbonara and it was great. We're coming back.
2021-07-25,5,Had an amazing family brunch there- everyone loved EVERYTHING!! The  egg sausage hash , the lemon ricotta  pancakes , the frittata, the chicken with gravy - all outstanding- we cannot WAIT to go back - wonderful attentive friendly staff makes the experience even better !
2021-07-24,3,I was looking forward to eating here and was disappointed. The food was ok but the service was bad. We were a party of 2 seated on a 4 person table. When our burrata came out the server thumped it on the table while talking to another employee - the burrata was literally on the edge of the table without the slightest effort to appropriately place it in front of patrons actually eating it! The burrata was good however I digress. My wife wanted bread for the table and when she asked our server, the server walked away and imitated my wife asking for the bread! I literally saw her doing it given she walked away and looked back while doing so! I don't know if this was a one off however I will not eat here again. The staff here need some training.
2021-06-29,5,The food and service were incredible. Went for the first time the other day and we ordered short rib ragu and the NY strip special -  amazing!! We'll definitely be going back!
2021-06-28,4,Their food is so good, very obsessed with their carbonara w/ fried egg on top. However noticed that depending what site look to order takeout from, prices vary (is that normal..?) also, $9 for this little portion of spinach was a bit disappointing. Seem to get a better bang for your buck in person.
2021-06-18,5,Delicious food and great service! Would definitely recommend if you live in or are visiting Hoboken!
2021-06-11,5,So my wife and I went there for our anniversary and they could not have been more kind and generous. The food was absolutely delicious. We started with the watermelon salad, I got the braised short rib - AMAZING! My wife got the eggplant - also delicious! The cocktails were balanced and smooth! Perfect place for a great dinner. We loved it so much we went the following week for brunch! Again - just great, got to sample their sangria (Thank you Frank) - So refreshing and fun! Looking forward to going again soon!
2021-06-07,5,I only write if something is really out of this world; and this place was out of this universe!! If the Italian ancestors could eat, they would come here. After looking at the Yelp reviews about this place, I had to check it out for myself. Myself, my boyfriend and his friend all got carbonara (two dishes actually), shrimp tavolo, watermelon salad and clams oreganato. First thing I want to mention is that we ordered this as take out. The presentation was as if we were sitting in Hoboken at the table. The scent of true Italian seasonings and oils hit your nostrils and immediately felt the serotonin exploding. The portions were large and truly to the Italian form of having more than enough to have left overs. I can't speak for the boys who had carbonara, but I can tell you that it looked fresh, creamy and you could see that the vegetables were full in color. I had the shrimp tavolo; the pesto risotto was unbelievable. The creamy basil mixed with the soft small noodles and off the boat shrimp :insert Italian kiss here: . The tomatoes were stewed and seasoned to perfection. 10/10!!The watermelon salad is a perfect summer salad. The watermelon was so juicy and crisp as well as the thinly sliced red onions and a touch of mint. The balsamic dressing was the perfect amount and brought the salad together. The clams of oreganato was pretty much standard issue clams; fresh, but nothing super out of this world. I wish I had pictures to show the food, but we were taking out the food as soon as the aroma left the opened bag. We are on the roof and it was a great night. If you're still reading, dude, eat from here, you won't regret jt. CarbonaraWatermelon Salad
2021-05-16,2,Tried this place out for brunch for the first time today but Unfortunately the experience missed the mark. While the service was very friendly, it felt slow and the items came out from the kitchen incorrectly.  We ordered their new seasonal watermelon salad to share to start. Once we started eating it, we all realized they forgot the ricotta cheese (one of main ingredients of dish besides the watermelon). Rather than make us a new one, they just gave us a side of cheese. I wanted to try the lemon ricotta pancakes for my main but they didn't have them today. Thought that was odd since nothing really that special in the ingredients. My friend asked to add avocado to her fried egg sandwich but they had none either.  I went with the stuffed French toast since I couldn't get the pancakes. Was okay but got pretty soupy. I wish they'd put the dollop of butter on the side. They also messed up and put blueberries instead of chocolate chips on it. I like otto strada's  French toast better. The restaurant took off one of the items from the bill which was kind. Just had higher expectations and was let down.
2021-05-10,1,We decided to go to Tavolo for our first night in over a year. The menu looked amazing so we were really excited. Unfortunately the food was unremarkable and bland. For apps we got calamari and grilled octopus - the calamari lacked seasoning and grilled octopus was well cooked but nothing special. I got a watermelon spritz and my husband had a beer. As for entrees, the short ribs and polenta lacked texture, looked completely unappetizing, and the stuffed ziti was bland. A top both entrees was cold burrata that did nothing to help either dish, and both entrees also had a few leaves of mixed greens on top - which had do business being on the plate. We finished our drinks with our apps and were looking forward to getting wine with our food. However once our entrees came, our server never came by to check on us. It was only once we were done that she stopped by to check in. At that point, there was no need for another drink. We skipped dessert and left feeling completely underwhelmed and disappointed in our date night.
2021-05-10,4,Have been many times and each time I'm delighted by something new! I've now been for brunch and dinner and I honestly can't pick which I liked more. The Eggplant Casserole and Boneless Short Ribs are to die for! So many amazing layers of goodness! On the brunch menu, go with the short rib grilled cheese...trust me!
2021-05-10,5,Quaint restaurant that had everything I wanted for mother's day. Great food, service and music. Wish I remembered my servers name but he was knowledgeable, I asked him for a white not dry wine and the wine he recommended was great. I tasted alittle bit of everyone's food at the table amazing. The brushcetta was small but so amazing best brushcetta I ever tasted. Could not find anything wrong with this place. I would go back again. Think it was the owner that came over and asked us where we are from and if everything was too our liking. I was there with my mom and aunts along with my cousins for mother's day. My family is hard to please but everyone thoroughly enjoyed. Check this place out I will be back again to enjoy. Thanks for the good food and service. You guys deserve all the stars for this gem.
2021-05-02,3,Entrees were mediocre not nearly as good as I've had in other Hoboken restaurants. But the staff was super nice and the meals came out super fast. The bruschetta boards are to DIE FOR! We got the tomato bruschetta and the broccoli rabe boards and they were so so so good. They charged $12 for a measly little chicken cutlet to be put on top of the stuffed rigatoni entree. CRAZY!! There was a man that came around multiple times checking in on the customers including us and he was super sweet and attentive, I'm pretty sure he was the owner.
2021-04-30,5,Had the burrata, chicken cutlet and calamari.. everything was excellent.. our table was unstable and without us even asking, the owner had the waiter correct it... very friendly staff, definitely will return to try more!!
2021-04-28,5,We celebrated my Son's Birthday at the restaurant and had a wonderful experience! The service was excellent. We enjoyed our dinner, selection of wines and desserts! IL Tavolo di' Palmisano is on our list as a definite go-to return restaurant. My Family highly recommends it.
2021-04-27,4,Great Italian spot with huge portions!! I was there with my aunt and boyfriend and we had a great time. They were running a special "board and bottle" - we got 4 bruschetta breads and a bottle of wine for $26! Our entrees could feed 2 people each. My boyfriend got the pork chops. My aunt and I got salmon piccata, and the salmon special. Both were delicious. Outdoor seating is adorable with cute lightening. The fresh baked bread in the begin was the show stopper though!!
2021-04-24,4,Had an amazing meal at IL Tavolo. The focaccia was great, the Old Fashion and wine by the glass (Nebiolo, Malbec) were also excellent. We had the garlic shrimp appetizer (amazing sauce), the breaded chicken (amazing) and La Nonna also amazing. The place makes its own pasta and it's fantastic. Owners family owns Biggies. The cheesecake was also great - the chocolate cake was ok. The service was very friendly and attentive. The outside eating was ok but looking forward to eat inside at some post pandemic time.
2021-04-11,5,Their Shrimp Pete's & linguini is amazing. The shrimp are crispy and the source has perfect amount of spice. The staff/owner are friendly and cares a lot about their customers. I placed an pick up order via ChowNow and  didn't notice it wasn't correct until I reached home. I called the restaurant and was pretty upset about the situation. The receptionist connected me with a gentleman (I later discovered he might be the manager/owner). Despite the restaurant doesn't do deliveries, this gentleman brought my food to me on a raining Sunday afternoon. Really appreciated their customer service. Recommend to try their pasta.Shrimp Linguini
2021-03-25,4,Had a nice Sunday evening family dinner here.  Wonderful streatery with igloos.  They offered to zip them up and turn on the heaters but it was warm enough that we didn't need it.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  Nice cocktail list.  Calamari appetizer was a nice portion.  The short rib ragu was delish.  Kids pizza was kind of a thin pizza-dilla.  Great place, looking forward to going back again.
2021-03-20,5,We went to Il Tavolo for dinner last night and it was amazing. The ambiance was very comfortable and the bar area was beautiful. The restaurant was also much larger than expected. The food was very delicious - highly recommend the bruschetta boards and one of my favorite dishes I've had in a while was their stuffed rigatoni topped with burrata. The staff was very friendly and we would definitely recommend and can't wait to go back!
2021-03-18,5,I can see why everyone raves about this. The food was amazing! The meatballs are a must. The service was lovely!! I've barely gone out because of covid this year so if anyone is considering it, this is the go to place for a safe dining experience! Reserve an igloo, the waiter did not even come into the igloo. Instead, they just hand off everything and talk to you from outside. Will undoubtedly come back. My one thing is, I do wish the view in that area was prettier (you're literally next to an Aldi), but the food makes up for it.
2021-03-13,4,Really enjoyed our meal at Il Tavolo! Amber was a fantastic server and very accommodating. The food was delicious, we will be back!
2021-03-13,5,This place is incredible! The dishes are expertly crafted with each individual component perfected. The little "igloos" were spotless and definitely made us feel comfortable Covid-wise. Above all else, the service is impeccable. Our server, Eddie, was extremely helpful. His recommendations were based on his extensive knowledge of the restaurant. He was warm, friendly, professional, and efficient. Truthfully the best service I've ever experienced at a restaurant. If you go here for dinner, I promise you won't regret it.
2021-03-08,5,Girlfriend and I got an igloo, split a bottle of wine and had the chicken parm / short rib and polenta / two bruschettas / stuffed long hots. Red sauce was light and flavorful, polenta was creamy and short rib was tender. Couldn't ask for a better Italian meal in Hoboken.I usually steer away from Italian food when eating out because no one makes it better than momma but was pleasantly surprised with both the service and the food.Even if you don't want entrees the bruschetta toast and wine is not only affordable but wonderful to consume. I'll be back, maybe bring some friends/family next time but if you're looking for a nice night out in an igloo this was great. P.s. Italian long hots can range from fuck you spicy to was that even a pepper? Proceed with caution although these weren't too bad.Peace love and eggplant
2021-03-08,5,My husband and I went to Il Tavolo last week for our 20th Anniversary.  It was a great experience from start to finish. We made reservations through OpenTable and there were no issues, they even sat us early. Our server Amber was attentive and super nice.  We started with the bruschetta boards (roasted tomatoes with ricotta & hot honey - YUM!!)  We will definitely get this again.  We also got fried calamari, which did not disappoint and liked the taste of the marinara sauce.My husband got the rigatoni special with chicken sausage & hot peppers. I got the boneless short ribs with polenta.  OMG - both amazing.  Robert, the manager was there to make sure everything went smoothly and we enjoyed our conversation with him.  The staff went above and beyond what most restaurants in Hoboken do. You really feel like they treat customers like guests in their home.We ate inside and the tables were spaced out and the staff wore masks, so again they were really concerned with the comfort of the guests.We will be back for special occasions as well as just a regular night.  I think we may have found our new go-to restaurant in Hoboken!
2021-03-06,3,What a 3 star restaurant! When you walk in you can just tell it's going to be a 3. Like, Future Husband and I automatically mouth to each other, "Three." It's just that we are in New Jersey, and authentic Italian food CAN be found. This is more of that "spaghetti and a cocktail" type of joint - think Bensi (I won't say Olive Garden). The food was honestly OK. Burrata wasn't the most fresh I have ever had, they didn't give warm bread or a decently size portion of bread. I got a tequila mule and it was very average. I will say tables were nice and spread out which I of course appreciate during COVID. I'm pretty sure they were even more than 6 feet apart, so at least this place is abiding by the rules, allowing very few people in at the same time. Service was straight up OK too. Towards the end of the meal we waited awhile for the waiter to come back with our check and that always bugs me a bit. The bar atmosphere is cool - dark and cozy. But again, nothing special. If you want this type of Italian food - the type where everything tastes OK and almost every dish is covered in balsamic - then it can even be 4 stars in your book. But when Future Husband and I are eating Italian we want Jersey Italian food - Augustino's in Hoboken, Libretti's in Orange, Angeloni's in Caldwell, Chef Vola's in Atlantic City. Olive Garden in malls everywhere.... NO see! I fooled you! For a second you thought I was being serious-that's exactly what this restaurant is, sort of like a made-you-look Italian joint with one weird long table in the center of the room that kind of makes me feel like I'm eating in The Great or Game of Thrones or a themed Bar Mitzvah.
2021-02-13,3,Food was good but that's about it. Service was horrible, our server maybe said five words to us and was miserable. Restaurant was absolutely freezing. Valentines weekend, you think they'd be a bit more put together but it was just "meh". Bathroom was disgusting, you think during covid they'd be on top of it. Won't rush back, will probably do takeout tho.
2021-02-13,5,Great decor, food and service. We got the Garlic Shrimp, carbonara, Breaded Chicken Cutlets, Short Ribs, La Nonna and others other items that were all delicious
2021-02-10,5,All the way from Texas to here. The staff is very friendly, and the food is absolutely amazing. Clean, sanitized environment. Definitely recommend everyone give them a try. Y'all, will never be disappointed.
2021-02-06,4,IL Tavolo looked so good on Instagram and was given great reviews by most social influencers. Being from NY, Staten Island, and governor moron having restaurants on lockdown, wanted to enjoy a meal indoors.Our visit didn't begin well, as we waited 5 minutes to be acknowledged with water, and another 5 for a waiter to arrive. Once the alcohol was ordered, it was off to the racesFor appetizers, we tried their bruschetta boards, which consisted of many types of topping combinations on top of a big piece of toasted bread. It was far from bite sized and was cut up in pieces. The meatballs were average at best. The carbonara, with a sunny side egg on top was amazing. Best dish of the day in my opinion.For entree, I went with the boneless short rib over creamy polenta. This too was delicious, but didn't stand out to me as something you couldn't get elsewhere. The rest of my group enjoyed each of their meals as well. No complaints Plenty of restaurants to choose from in Hoboken. If you haven't been, you should try this one
2021-02-05,5,Absolute fantastic service and delicious food. We got the fried calamari, steak, aglio e olio, artichoke bruschetta and tomato bruschetta. The manager, Robert came by multiple times during our meal to check in with us which was such a special touch. Plus, we were celebrating a birthday and they brought over 2 desserts. I'll be back very soon!
2021-02-01,5,Second visit to Il Tavolo in a few months. If my first visit earned 4 stars, this one earned 5.The service was great, and the food was even better. A group of us split several menu items, all delicious. Grilled octopus, meatballs, and stuffed peppers to start. Short rib (my favorite dish), chicken cutlet burrata, and pork chop and peppers for mains. No complaints on the food, it was all excellent.Pro tip: order extra peppers and balsamic with the chicken cutlet burrata. Game changer
2021-01-31,5,This was the best meal I've had in a LONG time. Like in 2 years. I ordered the shrimp risotto and it was creamy and dreamy and exploded with flavor. Plus, the experience was 10/10. We ate at the restaurant in one of their igloos and it was such a fun and safe experience. The igloos were toasty warm and zipped shut. Plus, we saw them disinfect the other igloos and it gave us peace of mind to know that the restaurant was taking high precautions.
2021-01-30,5,Delicious thin chicken parm and short rib! Will definitely order again. Great food and service.
2021-01-20,5,My first dining experience at IL Tavolo di' Palmisano took place outdoors and was stellar in all aspects, from the food to the service.  So, the other day, I wound up introducing some family members to their excellent cuisine by picking up some appetizers to-go.  The Nonna's Meatballs were firm, but not too dense.  They were served in a hearty marinara sauce with a spoonful of creamy, lemon basil ricotta that melted in our mouths.  We had also ordered the Garlic Shrimp, which were even more spectacular.  As on my previous visit, the jumbo shrimp were plump and crisp.  They had been simmered in garlic, oil, and fresh herbs, and were then draped over toasted crostini and topped with shaved Parmesan cheese.  The sauce was robust and garlicky, but not overpoweringly so. We all loved our savory bites, and I was thrilled to introduce my family to such a terrific restaurant.  I look forward to more culinary experiences at IL Tavolo di' Palmisano.
2021-01-19,3,Heard a lot of great things about this place but have to say the owner wasn't wearing a mask at all which, even though he seemed nice, was super stressful! the octopus appetizer we got sadly had barely any octopus in it and felt overpriced for what we received. The server was doing everything on his own so it took forever.. he was very sweet and apologetic and gave us free dessert but it wasn't amazing. The owner not wearing his mask was a dealbreaker.
2021-01-18,4,We dined in one of the igloos and it was amazing! Had no trouble getting a same-day reservation (it was Tuesday) and the igloo was warm (there's a space heater) and seemed very clean. Staff was very friendly and nice, also attentive which was great since whenever we eat outside I worry we'll be more likely to be forgotten about. For a starter we got one of the crostinis that had sausage and broccoli rabe. Loved the cute, personalized cutting board it was served on, and that it was pre-sliced into 4 smaller slices - great for sharing and less messy to eat! Got the breaded chicken cutlet for an entree, which comes with roasted red peppers and burratta on top. So great! The chicken itself is pretty standard, but is made special with the toppings. Generous portion of burratta, which is always appreciated. Second entree was the carbonara - absolutely delicious and so fresh and creamy. However, never could have eaten the whole thing because it's incredibly rich, so very happy we had already planned to share both the chicken and carbonara. Only thing I did not like was my cocktail (forget the name and can't find it on the menu currently) - it was a mule with tequila and iced tea. I normally love every one of the ingredients but mixed together it was an odd, disappointing flavor. Would NOT recommend that, but everything else was great and cocktails are always a personal choice so I don't think that ruined or tarnished my experience. Probably would have been a 5 if not for that.
2021-01-17,5,Hoboken is full of Italian places and I am so sad it took me so long to come here thinking it was like all the others. It is NOT like the others. It was so good, true Italian food. The La Nonna is the kind of meal you think about often. The pasta was all cooked perfectly, and you can tell everything is fresh. Had some espresso martinis and they were delicious. The service was great as well. Can't wait to come back!
2021-01-16,5,The igloos were so fun, the waiters were so nice and attentive and the short rib was one of the best meals I've had in a while! 10/10!
2021-01-14,4,I ordered the salmon risotto and the salmon came out soo dry and the risotto was leaking oil. It did not have much flavor. I am giving this place 4 stars because of how cute the atmosphere is and the exceptional service!
2021-01-03,4,This place is delicious! We were in one of their outdoor igloos (due to Covid) and it was very comfortable.  Four of us went and we got the tomato bruschetta and also the salami/cheese bruschetta.  Both were wonderful! For an entree I got the salmon piccata which was so good!  Can't wait to go back and try more dishes!
2020-12-29,5,Had a great meal here on Monday night. Started off with 3 different types of bruschetta, all were really yummy. Then I had the La Nonna Pasta, it was to die for. My fiancé got the carbonara which he loved, I didn't get to try any because he ate it all. We were too full for dessert but will definitely come back. Service was great as well.
2020-12-18,5,I was feeling some Italian and I noticed that Il Tavolo was voted "Best New Dinner Spot" in Hoboken Girl's blog, so I decided to order some takeout. It did not disappoint. Started with the calamari and meatballs, both were to die for (and still hot after a long, 30° walk). The calamari was crispy and perfectly seasoned. The meatballs were some of the best I've had in Hoboken, ever. For entrées, we had the chicken parm and eggplant parm. HUGE portions (which I love because I can eat the house) and the quality is unmatched. Truly one of the best Italian meals I've had in Hoboken in a long, long time. If you're contemplating takeout/a great Italian meal, do not hesitate and order Il Tavolo. Not the mention was staff was very kind and helpful when picking up our order.
2020-12-14,5,Great spot especially with the new outside igloos! I had the burrata chicken and it was amazing! Can't wait to go back. Everyone was friendly and socially distanced as well!
2020-12-14,5,All I can say is 'wow!' They hit every nail on the head. The food, service, and drinks were all amazing! We were so excited to try it after hearing such great reviews and we were blown away. Our group got the shrimp Pete's, the long hots, and the calamari for apps. For dinner I split the carbonara (absolutely delicious and the egg on top was cooked to perfection) and the Sunday sauce which was also fantastic, the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the sauce was delicious. Everyone got espresso martinis Abe the spritz which were strong and perfectly made. Our waiter, Conrad was very friendly and attentive. Can't recommend enough!
2020-12-13,5,Wow the outdoor dining set up here is pristine! Outdoor heating lamps, individual igloos, plastic covering to block from wind/pedestrians, QR code ordering...etc. All staff were wearing masks. Menu was limited and the descriptions could be better with pictures, but all restaurants are adjusting during the difficult time. We ordered calamari, chicken cutlet with burrata, and sausage and rabe ravioli. The food was amazing and the weekly special ravioli was definitely the highlight. Since moving to Hoboken, we've been so unimpressed with the food and IL Tavolo will definitely be our go to! Can't wait until I can drink again to try out the drinks!
2020-12-11,4,Il Tavolo opened next door to my apartment just a few months ago and has really become a gem of the neighborhood. A small menu ensures high quality dishes and great cocktails gives the place an enticing vibe. They've gone to great lengths to stay up to COVID protocol and provide a safe and enjoyable experience. Definitely worth a chance for your next date night or GNO.
2020-12-11,5,The best spot for Italian in Hoboken! Although the menu may look simple, every dish has so much flavor and is so fresh! Amazing portions, great service- the staff goes above and beyond to make their guests feel accommodated. Highly recommend the burata, shrimp Pete's, ravioli specials, weekday bruschetta and wine specials. make sure to visit!!
2020-12-07,5,So incredibly happy Il Tavolo opened up when it did. Not only is the food incredible, the service is amazing. Every single time my fiancé and I have dined there or ordered in, the staff is so friendly and attentive. Robert, the manager, is so warm and accommodating - we love seeing him!The food honestly is delicious - do yourself a favor and get the icebox cake. It is, to die for.
2020-12-06,5,Worthy of #1 for best italian. The burrata, carbonara, and la nonna were delicious and filling, you could tell they use the freshest ingredients
2020-12-04,5,Tried this place for the first time a month or so ago, I was pleasantly surprised! I ordered a short rib over oricchiette special that was amazing! The  service was fantastic, and so were the specialty cocktails!
2020-11-16,4,Had a lovely experience at Il Tavolo on a Friday evening. Since it was a colder evening, we decided to sit inside and was sat immediately. I loved the ambiance of restaurant and the staff was very friendly. The highlight was the salmon - it was an awesome portion! You could tell the food was very high quality and made fresh. Excited to come back and try more menu items.
2020-11-13,5,This spot is a hidden gem in the heart of Hoboken. Our server Jennifer was stellar, making everything super accommodating and enjoyable for outdoor starting, even brining over an extra heat lamp! Food was so good , service just as great! Highly recommend!
2020-11-13,5,If you are sitting in Jennifer's section, she is the best server. The food was amazing but her service was supreme. 14/10
2020-11-13,5,Everything was amazing! Our server Jennifer was so sweet, friendly and went out of her way to drag over  heat lamp for us! 12/10 would recommend! Food was so delicious.
2020-11-13,5,Food was really good, tasty well presented and quick. Place is big trendy and clean. Would definitely come back .
2020-11-12,4,This is one of those new places that sneaks up on you. I had no idea there was a new restaurant at this location until I ran by one time. The set up is pretty straightforward with high top tables and a bar in the front. They also have a back room with more tables if you want a more private experience.We ordered a few different things starting with the meatballs and bruschetta with artichoke. The meatballs had good flavor and the sauce had a nice tang to it.  I had never seen bruschetta server with artichoke but it didn't impress me too much.  The thing that impressed me were the entrees. The La nonna is a must order and tastes like something an italian grandma would make. So good. It is pretty much grandma's sauce with meatballs and sausage.  The pasta is also perfectly al dente. My wife got the salmon piccata and it was delicious. It is light and lemony which I love. Sometimes piccata is more buttery than lemony but not here. It is just right. For dessert we had the rice pudding but it was bland and needed cinnamon. Overall it was a good meal.  The only thing I didn't like is that it has that old bar smell. I know that smell and it is very offputting. If they sort it out it would make this place even better!  The entrees were really solid and that will definitely draw me back.
2020-11-11,4,Excellent meal and service for me and my wife. I had sausage and broccoli rabe, and my wife had the breaded chicken cutlets. Everything was delicious. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the bread (excellent focaccia) was served with prepackaged tubs of butter, and the ice tea that I ordered tasted as if it can from a machine instead of fresh brewed. It's the little things that make all the difference, but all in all an enjoyable experience.
2020-11-05,2,This place has potential, the food was pretty good overall. The calamari was pretty flavorless and chewy, but the meatballs were decent. Both of us really enjoyed our Short Rib, it was delicious and the dish was balanced perfectly.The service was almost comically bad, though. Our drink order took 20 minutes with literally only 2 other people in the entire place, and after those 20 minutes we were informed that they didn't have one of the drinks we requested... uhhh you're a waiter you should know what is 86ed and if you don't just let us know when you put in the order not 20 minutes later (I've sent back drinks only one other time in my life, this was the second time, the blueberry basil tasted like straight cough syrup)Also when we sat down in the back room it was uncomfortably quiet, it's a large wood room so everything was echoing, my wife and I were having fun with it but we had to request some sort of music to be played because it was simply painfully quiet. Every word of the other parties conversation was heard clearly across the room. I'll give it another try because I think it's solely an issue with management, but so far I'm very disappointed.
2020-11-02,1,Tried to come here on a Saturday night a few weeks ago and was told there would be a 2 hour wait... I walked around the outside of the restaurant and counted 6 empty tables! I doubled back and tried to make sure the estimate was still accurate, because maybe she didn't realize how many tables had cleared, but she confirmed the 2 hour wait and that I could put my name and number down just in case. A server overheard this on his way out and shook his head and even muttered "this is ridiculous." We ended up putting our name down but in the 15-20 mins it took for them to call us we were already seated with a glass of wine a few blocks away at Grand Vin. Wanted to support this place because we know it is new and it's probably tough to build up your reputation, but not a great way to start out... hopefully we will try again and update the review after that.
2020-11-01,1,Really adorable spot and a great atmosphere. Very great service in the sense where they are new and make you feel really welcome the moment you walk in. I would actually try to lift this new business up in these trying times, however, the bartender spent the entire time not wearing a mask. Which in a world where new businesses should be fighting for business and to be safe and accommodating in these trying times, I found to be absolutely disrespectful. Hoboken has worked hard to keep their numbers downs and I have gone to restaurants that I know better and am loyal too and they have been following the rules and going the EXTRA mile to make their customers feel safe. No matter what you believe, you are in the SERVICE INDUSTRY and you should be making people feel comfortable. I would 100% recommend this restaurant to friends to be a Hoboken resident that lifts and helps new restaurants out but be respectful and don't let your beliefs seep into your workplace. Do the right thing. Ironically in the bathroom, there is a poster explaining how wearing a masks saves lives and protects others. At least in the women's room they have this poster and she is a women so I know she sees it every time she goes in. It's so simple. I want this restaurant to succeed but step up. It's New Jersey when there are Italian restaurants on every corner, step up to the plate because I have endless options.
2020-10-10,3,It was good, service was excellent. Everyone was very nice and the outdoor dining set up was great.
2020-10-10,4,Another Italian restaurant to check out in Hoboken. We were given a choice of seating on a Tuesday evening and chose an outdoor table separated from other tables by a tarp. Tuesday nights they have a board and bottle special with a choice of four boards and a bottle of wine. With four of us dining it was perfect choice as each board was cut into four pieces. All the boards were terrific. I ordered the skirt steak pizzaiola, but received the grilled steak. I didn't complain as I was fine with what I was served. My medium rare was more medium but enough for me to send back. The bigger disappointment was the lack of taste or seasoning. Chicken Marsala was served a little gummy, maybe from being under a heat lamp. Not good enough to take home the leftovers. The other dishes were okay, nothing special. Service was very friendly and though we had a big space between the apps and main, our server didn't disappear.
2020-10-10,5,Came here for dinner with my boyfriend. We were sat outside right away. The service was AMAZING but the best part was the food. It was so delicious!!!! We ate every last bite. Highly recommend and will be coming back again and again.
2020-10-04,5,Had take out from Tavolo and it did not disappoint! Forgot who I talked to (maybe the manager) but he was a such a sweetheart!!! Beautiful interior, made me wish that I was eating inside. The boneless short rib - delicious, tender. Shrimp linguini - kinda basic (nothing special nothing wrong)
2020-09-25,5,I'm going to say it: best new Italian restaurant in Hoboken. Delicious, fresh, sophisticated dishes accompanied by a hospitable wait staff and a genuinely friendly manager, Robert. This restaurant has made it into my rotation. My Italian-descent father approves (note: last notable Hoboken Italian restaurant I took him to he said "never take me back there again." In contrast, he shared with Robert that he will come back to Il Tavolo on his next visit).
2020-09-20,5,Very delicious food with great menu options that you don't see at typical Italian restaurants. My boyfriend and I started with the artichoke cakes with Parmesan sauce, highly recommend. I ordered the mushroom risotto and it was a 10/10 I wouldn't change anything about it. It was creamy, incredibly flavorful, and filling. I really appreciate that they have vegetarian options that are on par with the rest of the menu and don't leave you feeling like the dish was lacking something.
2020-09-19,4,No bread to start but the food was great. It definitely feels healthier than other Italian spots. The food was not over seasoned which I appreciate it. I got the skirt steak with risotto and broccoli rabe which was perfect. Chicken and linguine was delicious as well. Linguine was cooked to perfection.
2020-09-19,5,AMAZING. Everything was absolutely amazing. The service was great and we were not rushed AT ALL. The drinks were amazing. The bruschetta boards were fabulous (we got every option and I cannot tell you my favorite) and the RISOTTO OH MY GOD. This place is newer to Hoboken and it is going to be tough to beat. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Get some heat lamps for the winter and I will be a regular!!
2020-09-13,3,The food here was very good, but the service was so bad. This was my first time here- I called the day before (Friday 9/11 at 4:56 pm- they can check their phone records) and made a reservation for 3 at 8:00, and we still had to wait 45 min for our table. I later found out that they don't take reservations, however no one ever told me that when I called, and in fact, I was confirmed for a reservation for Saturday 9/12 at 8:00. After waiting for a long time I asked the hostess what was going on, after we were waiting for 45 minutes when we were told our table would be ready in about 5 minutes, and I was told "We aren't in the business of kicking anyone out." It came across as very rude and inconsiderate, especially since we were told we had a reservation. I understand not wanting to tell a table to leave, but for the guests that are coming there for the first time, this was a rude response and made me feel like my business didn't matter. As someone who has worked in the food and beverage industry for many years, there was a much better way to handle this situation. Furthermore, though our waitress was very nice, we were often left at our table without drinks or were searching for her to get the check or other things we needed. Likely won't be going back.
2020-09-12,5,Delicious dinner at Il Tavolo tonight. We were a party of 7, and were able to call Friday for a Saturday night reservation (don't think they take reservations for smaller groups). Servers were attentive; cocktails took awhile to come out, but apps and main courses were well timed. Nothing felt rushed and we really enjoyed our meal.Stuffed long hots (spicy!) and octopus appetizers were great; bruschetta boards were just ok. Based on other reviews, two of us got the boneless short ribs with polenta, and three got the breaded chicken. Both did not disappoint. One of my friends called the breaded chicken with buratta magical!Will definitely eat here again!
2020-09-10,5,This was such an incredible restaurant and experience! Everything was so lovely. The food, the drinks, and the staff are incredible. I will definitely be coming back here! Thank you all so much! I definitely recommend!
2020-09-04,5,Excellent food! Came with a group on a rainy night and the staff was very accommodating. All our food and drinks were excellent. We got a variety of bruschetta boards, breaded chicken cutlet, gnocchi special. The chicken cutlet was the best Italian style chicken I've ever had! Cannot wait to go back!
2020-09-01,1,They prepared my order 30-60 minutes prior to pickup (placed via grub hub for pick-up not delivery), told me they would remake it for my arrival and ended up sending me home with the original food - cold.
2020-09-01,3,Three stars given for the meals served to my party of 5 dining guests. I stuck to the fish and my friends all ordered everything but... The chicken cutlet Burrata was awesome, the short rib special was tender and good flavor. Drinks were also good. I ordered the octopus, which was dry with no flavor, Although served with a delicious bean salad. The calamari also didn't have any flavor. The salmon was dry and tasted a little too much like 'fish'. So overall a good dinning experience with the exception of the fish I sampled. Everyone has been raving about this place so maybe my bar was set higher or everyone just ordered the chicken cutlets :).
2020-08-31,4,Open with a very nice outdoor dining sitch. They don't take resos, but will do day of call ahead. I tried around noon and didn't get an answer, tried again closer to 5:30pm and was able to get my party of 3 on the list for 8pm that night. We wound up waiting a bit for our table, but clearly were prioritized vs. the walk ups. They are serving a full menu. Good variety between first, second and primi. They also have a full bar and fun cocktail list. Unsure if they would still let you do BYO, we ordered off cocktail menu. For apps we had the sausage stuffed long hots- these are spicy! And burrata- pretty standard. For entrees my friend had the short rib and polenta, I got the carbonara risotto and my other friend had the spicy shrimp and linguine. My carbonara risotto was the clear favorite of the night. It was so delicious,  not too heavy, super creamy and flavorful. Only complaint was timing of the meal. We ordered apps, but they came out with entrees. We were also starving so, an app ahead of entrees would've been nice vs. waiting.
2020-08-29,1,Yesterday was our wedding anniversary. I reached out to management about a reservation via Instagram the day before. I have been a huge supporter of this place since day one and wanted to keep giving them business. They were kind enough to make an exception regarding a reservation and promised to hold a table for us. We arrived at our designated time and while my name was written down, there was no table. The hostess said it would be 20 minutes, and although it was slightly irritating we were fine waiting. It then started to rain, and I went inside to see if our 20 minutes was realistic since we were getting soaked. The wait jumped to 40 minutes, so we left. My biggest issue is that if the manager said we don't take reservations but call ahead, I would have, but to leave people high and dry (or wet) on a special occasion is not right. We went to Amanda's on Washington Street where there was live music and great food - it was a wonderful evening regardless.
2020-08-26,1,My wife and I went here the weekend they opened. Unfortunately, they were way understaffed and we waited over an hour (with no food on the table yet) before asking for the check. The owner and manager came over, kindly, to assure us they would make things right and offered us a coupon for our next visit. This evening we were headed out for one of our final nights out in Hoboken before moving and decided to give the place another try - it's been a few months since opening and figured they would have worked out the kinks by now. I can say the food did come out in a timely manner this time, but maybe it shouldn't have. We were underwhelmed with the appetizer options but decided to go with a bruschetta board (one of the three types we ordered was incorrect). They were underwhelming to say the least, and truly lacked any developed flavor (about as basic as they come). My wife got the mushroom risotto and I had the cacio e pepe - it's an Italian restaurant, so we assumed that pasta and risotto would be a walk in the park. We were wrong. The cacio e pepe was a collection of undercooked (and clearly not freshly made) pasta sitting in an unappetizing puddle of pasta water. Not a single grain of salt was added to the dish. The mushroom risotto had the opposite presentation; a bold and rustic looking plate with an overwhelming amount of salt and vegetable stock that hadn't been properly sautéed into the rice. Our cocktails were certainly a saving grace, as the bartender knows how to actually give you what you pay for. Our wait staff was pleasant enough, but sweatpants and a t-shirt raise a red flag when you're being served food for an $80 dinner. The outdoor seating was nice (a necessity during the Covid era) and we had no problem getting a table when we arrived. The dinner as a whole was underwhelming and though many reviews here seem to think you get plenty of flavor for a fair value, I must disagree. The restaurant needs a new chef or would benefit from a MasterClass in seasoning and pasta, which again, amazes me for an Italian place.
2020-08-25,5,Delicious  The food was fresh and tasty, the service was friendly and the atmosphere outside was great. Will definitely come back!
2020-08-25,4,Seems like this restaurant has recently opened but the service and owners make you feel like you're at home! Their outdoor seating has tents, just in case for possible rain. I came for my friend's birthday and she enjoyed her time here because the staff was so friendly and engaging. They always asked us how we were doing and if we needed anything. They have a nice drink menu too. I got the watermelon spritz and it was really nice. For food, I got the grilled portobello mushroom, burrata and shrimp linguini. I loved the appetizers, they tasted so good. The mushroom really stood out and I would definitely come again for the appetizers. The shrimp linguini was good too, but it wasn't too memorable. Overall I'm really happy with my experience and would definitely recommend this place to anybody looking to try a new spot!
2020-08-25,4,Great local Italian restaurant that recently opened. They've done a good job adjusting during COVID. There's tents setup and the tables are seperated a good distance from each other. The staff is super friendly and accomodating. The owner stopped by personally a few times to check in on us. They have a great selection of cocktails. For food, we split the burratta and grilled portobello mushroom for apps. I was a big fan of the mushroom. I ordered the short rib for my entree, which was pretty good. The polenta was a great compliment to the dish.
2020-08-23,5,Wish I could give this restaurant 10 stars. The customer service was above and beyond from the minute I walked up to the restaurant. Being in Hoboken where I bring my pup everywhere, naturally I brought her here. They are SO dog friendly...I had 3 different people (that worked there) walk by asking if they can bring her water. One gentleman (I believe his name was Robert), came out and asked if she can have a biscuit. I have never been to a restaurant that was so great with dogs! It made me immediately fall in love. The waitress was very attentive and knowledgeable. She gave a few recommendations of the menu, which we decided to go with some of the options she mentioned. Starting with the artichoke cakes, they were fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect since I've never heard of these- but I was so happy to try them. We also had one of the brushettas. Forget the name, but it's a soft cheese with soppressata- amazing! Highly recommended! I had the chicken cutlets..which I normally would never order, but the waitress recommended them and i was so happy to listen to her! They came with roasted red peppers and burrata on top...how can you not love that?! My friend had the shrimp Pete's which was also amazing...a little bit of spice so it was a great kick. Just based on customer service I would come back in a heart beat...add in great food and it's a huge win! So happy this place opened!!
2020-08-23,4,Dinner at Il Tavalo di' Palmisano! Italian food has always been a favorite of mine and this place was fantastic. It is a brand new restaurant without many reviews on yelp so we were a little nervous at first but when the line was out the door, we knew we had picked the right place.Starting with the aperitivo, the grilled octopus was cooked amazing. The chilled beans, arugula, and lemon over the top paired greatly with the flavor of the octopus. For me, I like it to be charred a bit more, but it was still not chewy at all. I would definitely recommend ordering it. Their watermelon insalata was great as well. It was not anything spectacular but was very refreshing for our warm summer evening.The Carbonara Risotto was delicious but compared to the short rib, did not stand a chance. I do love a restaurant who has a whole section of their menu dedicated just to risotto. The short rib was a recommendation from another waiter passing by. He stopped to tell us some of his favorites and we are so thankful he did because we were not planning on ordering it at first. The meat just fell apart and paired so nicely with the creamy polenta underneath. Definitely a must order if you are to visit this restaurant.
2020-08-21,5,Decided to try a new Italian restaurant in Hoboken for dinner and Il Tavolo did not disappoint! Their outdoor seating was very cute and well decorated. Staff was pleasant and attentive.Our party had the stuffed long hot peppers - was good, but very spicy! Eggplant casserole - great take on eggplant parm, marinara was rich in flavor. Boneless short ribs - cooked perfectly! Also had a great selection of cocktails. I had the La Espoloma - was the perfect amount of espolon tequila and grapefruit juice.Looking forward to trying more on their menu. Would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a new restaurant in the area!
2020-08-14,5,We've been there around 2 weeks ago, but I couldn't let the opportunity to leave a review pass. That's the best food we have eaten in our lives so far haha Even better than a Michelin Star Restaurant in NYC. My husband got the Chicken Marsala and I got the Ribs and Polenta. The polenta was crispy outside and soft inside, just like it should be. The ribs were cooked to perfection. The mascarpone was a delicious add. I tried my husband's sauce and it was delicious. And I'm leaving this review because we're day dreaming of this place, but it's already closed - so, next time. Waiter was also very polite. I hope they can keep the quality of food and attendance.
2020-08-12,4,Very nice outdoor dining space. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive. I can't remember our servers name but she was very sweet. Great guest service. I ordered the artichoke bruschetta which was OK didn't really wow me. My husband had the seafood salad which he enjoyed. Very fresh. Lightly seasoned. Hit the spot. I ordered the short ribs which i NEVER do because   I always regret it. They are typically too fatty or chewy..... but I wanted to try something different and I'm glad I did. They were melt in your mouth delicious!!!! Not over seasoned - so you could taste the quality of the ribs. Of course there was fat - it is ribs however the cut of meat was very good. A Beautiful sauce over the short rib was well balanced. The polenta was buttery! Yum! My husband ordered the salmon he enjoyed it and said it was cooked to perfection. A great summer time dish compared to my short ribs but who cares. I loved them! We will be back!
2020-08-11,5,Service was great! We tried the watermelon salad, burrata, cacio e pepe, and sausage/broccoli rabe pasta. All were delicious and serving sizes were good, we both took home about half our pasta. We also had the ice box cake for dessert which was tasty but nothing special. I would definitely return!
2020-08-08,5,Absolutely love this place. It's very new so not sure the word has got out about this gem. But food is amazing and fairly priced. The outdoor setup is very well done and allows for a ton of seating. Owner came by to ask how we were doing -- just friendly all around. We've been by three times so far post COVID and will keep coming back!
2020-08-07,5,Went tonight with my husband for the first time and it was excellent. We did not have reservations and went at 6pm on a Friday night and nearly every single table was filled and they had a ton of tables, so next time I'll certainly make a reservation. The food, service and atmosphere was all great. We started with cocktails and I got the Mediterranean mule and he got an old fashion (or 3) and they were very tasty. As an app we got the seafood salad and 3 bruschetta's. All were delicious but I particularly loved the bruschettas, and we got the artichoke, roasted tomatoes and roasted red peppers bruschettas. Then for our entrees I got the chicken cutlets and he got sausage and broccoli rabe oriechette. The chicken cutlets were pounded nice and thin and they were very well seasoned, and on top was roasted red peppers and two burrata's with a balsamic reduction drizzled over it. Absolutely delicious. And the pasta was extremely tasty as well. The service was outstanding, the manager Robert was extremely sweet, and I cannot wait to return.
2020-08-03,2,Wow. I'm gonna try to keep this brief. I have zero complaints regarding service, both waitresses we dealt with were attentive, kind, and knowledgeable. The food, however, is the absolute definition of mediocre. I had a bad feeling when it took less than ten minutes for our food to come out, but I figured it was a slower day, despite most tables being full with guests. The red sauce tasted like it was straight from a can, bought next door at the Acme. Like, it was indistinguishable from the same sauce I cook in my own home. I am NOT a good cook. I got the Chicken Travolo, and while the chicken was certainly serviceable, NOTHING about it made me feel like I was eating quality food. Both meals screamed microwave. The portion sizes were incredibly off, I received maybe a 1/3 of my GF's portion, with both of us ordering similar meals. Both of our dishes were between $22-$26, the quality of food we received is not worth half of that. Despite living less than a block away, I will never come back to this place.
2020-07-28,3,Unfortunately we didn't have the same experience others have had here. Maybe it's better in person?We ordered delivery Thursday for the burrata and chicken Parmesan Tavolo. The burrata is $15 so we were expecting a decent size burrata with a decent size arugula salad. The balsamic drizzle was good. The arugula was very scarce. Tomatoes were fine. Burrata was very small and had some pattern in it like it was in plastic. It tasted like plastic to me. I would NEVER order this again. I definitely don't recommend it. Way overpriced. Container arrived very empty.The chicken Parmesan Tavolo was okay. We've had better chicken parm at Augustinos. There was two flattened pieces of chicken that were cooked perfect. Not much cheese at all. The pasta was cooked al dente which is perfect. This is also a small portion size for $24. Not worth it in my opinion. Way overpriced compared to size. Many other choices in Hoboken.We won't be reordering delivery but may give it a try with outdoor dining and different plate choices. We will see.
2020-07-26,5,Ordered delivery for the first time after not feeling up to our usual places. The food was AMAZING. My husband had the pork chop and raved about it from start to finish. And I had the Risotto Carbonara and I can't say enough about it--probably the best risotto I've ever had!!! Delivery was on time and everything was hot and ready to eat. This will definitely be part of our "usual places" from now on!
2020-07-14,5,This place was amazing. Had been recommended to go here by a friend and so happy we did. Everything from the drinks to the food was excellent and the staff was top notch. Such great customer service!
2020-06-27,5,We have been here a few times and absolutely love it. Incredible service, great food and love the ambiance - whether you're inside or outside. It's definitely one of our staples in Hoboken. The cocktails are incredible as is the food, Cacio e Pepe is one of our faves if you're looking for pasta!
2020-06-20,5,Was walking by last night and popped in to see if there was a table available and boy are we glad we did! The food was absolutely delicious- started with stuffed peppers then shared short rib with polenta and the pork chops and peppers. I would order both again! The wait staff was absolutely fantastic and were just as attentive and helpful as expected pre-pandemic. I can't wait to return!
2020-06-04,5,We ordered takeout and it was incredible!  The short ribs were amazing.  Great addition to the neighborhood.
2020-03-19,5,Just got take out from here and it was absolutely delicious. (I would highly recommend the eggplant sandwich.). Will definitely order from here again.
2020-03-14,5,Wife and I were invited by the fam - we shared and split a few dishes - they were all amazing. Started with the Artichokes - better than Mom's but don't tell her -Dinner- pasta, meatballs, veal, shrimp, beef - all cooked perfectly and full of flavor. Desert - home made Cannolis with Espresso and Buca. Chris the waiter - on point.
2020-03-09,5,Just finished dinner at il tavolo. We had some of the best Italian food in Hoboken.. my wife had the tagliate very good and fresh.. with real San Marzano tomatoes.. I had the fresh paccheri pasta some of the best I had outside of Italy.. the service was very good and accommodating..Great job!! We definitely coming Back!!
2020-03-07,5,Ordered the Chuck Roast Au Jus this afternoon and it was incredible. Muscles and calamari to start were delicious and cooked perfectly. Great service super at tentative, will definitely be back.
2020-03-07,5,Great new spot in Hoboken. The bruschetta is very large so when we picked 4 options it was too much for 2 people. The options are standard for an Italian place. I had the veal picatta which was great, but wish there were a few more inventive options on the menu that would drive us to come back.
2020-03-05,4,The carbonara is AMAAAAZING. We started with the four selection bruschetta platter which was very good. Large pieces of bruschetta with a nice variety. Our server was also great - let us take our time, but yet attentive. I got the white cucumber drink which was very refreshing. The only thing I will say is that they need to get a curtain to cover the entrance so the cold air doesn't come in. We were right by the door and we were freezing. All in all I will definitely go back.
2020-03-01,5,Food was Delicious!! Appetizers, main course, drinks and dessert!! Friendly staff, nice atmosphere!! Franky best of luck!! The bone-in short rib over creamy palenta was delicious.
2020-02-29,3,The food was great, even if we are picky. Prices are very reasonable. The biggest complain is service. Understandable that some  servers  were new, but still I expect better knowledge of menu. And  unacceptably that tables around sat dirty for the whole hour, and it was not a busy time. One more thing about, ac blew such a hot air.Hope this place will fix this minor issues, will defiantly come back
2020-02-25,5,Excellent first time experience. Delicious chicken. Milenase.  Arugula salad. Good. Specialty cocktails good. Robert Hoff continuallyWalked around to check in with us. Frankie checked in with us friendly. God Bless. Can't wait to come again.
2020-02-23,5,With so many Italian spots you have to stand out and this one definitely does! The apps were amazing, shrimp petes, long hots & calamari...I'd go back just for that! I was with 8 people, the chicken parm, pork chops, and eggplant & chicken piccata were all getting great reviews. I had the cacio de pepe and was amazing not overly creamy. Espresso martini and mediterranean mule were both awesome. Great atmosphere, great food I will definitely be back! Well done Palmisano's!
2020-02-22,5,Came here for drinks on Thursday with Marlena and had a lovey night, but knew I had to come back for dinner. When we came for dinner Saturday and didn't have a reservation l. we first met with Erica who was lovely and told us roughly an hour. We quickly ran next door and did some shopping and came back and lucked out with spots at the bar. Amber was absolutely lovely with her drink suggestions. Once we had two seats we decided to try the cheese plate which was great ( Brie could be more flavorful). We then had the small portions of the Caesar and carbonara which were bomb.com and the short rib which was fab. Everyone we worked with was amazing and we CANNOT wait to be back.
2020-02-22,5,Loved the lunch here! First weekend open. Just wandered in, walking by. Ordered the porchetta sandwich, with pesto, ham and cheese on toasted baguette. So good! Trying to avoid bread, but it was amazing, especially showing up as a toasted baguette. Robert, the manager, is so sweet, and welcoming! The ambiance is so laid  back. Just locals. Kind of gotten sick of the other Italian places, shuttling you and out, so unfriendly. Here, Michael, the very professional and discerning wine manager, (and bar tender,) talks about his expanding and lovely wine selections. Had two glasses of Carpinetto San Giovese and Cab. . .Felt so relaxed in this setting. Beautiful! Will be back here...often. Great, great  addition to Hoboken Italian fare! Shhh...Don't tell anyone!!!
2020-02-17,5,Second night open and was a good experience. Service was very honest as kitchen was backed up but even with that the wait was not bad.  Food was excellent.  Service excellent and when they get things together only expect great things.
2020-02-17,5,This restaurant screams FAMILY ! As soon as we arrived we were instantly greeted by owner Frank Palmisano and manager Robert Hoff and i knew immediately we became part of the family.  The bustling energy of the restaurant and the delicious comfort food I ate will surely bring me back to il tavolo very soon. Take my advice: go soon, and  meet and become part of the family.
2020-02-17,5,Wow!!!! Let's start with the vibes of the new restaurant in town Il Tavolo, the pretty new place owned by proprietors 'Fratelli Palmisano'. It's decorated in an industrial homey type feel you'll love. This restaurant which will surely become your regular spot is a wonderful addition to the 7th and Clinton neighborhood. Secondly, the service....Chris our server was spectacular. He truly wore his roller skates on Saturday night! Lol. He went above and beyond on an extremely busy night to make all the diners at our table feel like well fed and watered 'family'.  Robert, the restaurant manager greeted our table of twelve very warmly (like family). You could see he wore many hats the night we were there and was always there lending a hand to his staff.  Now the food, prepared by chef Clinton and his kitchen staff was amazing old school Italian..portions are big and delicious. My eggplant casserole was exactly the comfort food I was craving and it didn't disappoint. I'm not going to comment on all the dishes we ordered from appys to dessert to delicious espresso. Go and experience il Tavolo for yourself. You will not be disappointed!
2020-02-15,5,Great service. Great food. Great people. What more can I say? Robert Hoff runs a great house and Tiff is a great server! The must haves are the carbonara, short rib, and the Palmisano cut pork chop.You're in for a treat!!!
