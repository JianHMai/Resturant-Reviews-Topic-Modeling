2021-11-06,5,Best in the east. Go all the time. Top spot. I like general Tsao and the egg roll. Friendliest in town
2021-10-27,1,WARNING TRIGGER PICTURES: We have been ordering from this place for a while never had a problem until this weekend we ordered sushi and we found a A LIVE WORM crawling on my shrimp tempura sushi. I was absolutely repulsed and threw up. We called the restaurant they apologized and refunded us and that was it, after literally ruining our day and probably never going to eat sushi again! DISGUSTING.
2021-10-18,1,1st & last time. Server demanded a tip after i changed from dine in to take out. (it started raining, I was outside with a dog, so before the food was even done being cooked we requested to have it to-go). chicken was not cooked through either. yuck!. trash.
2021-09-27,5,Ordered for take out. Ready when we got there and very nice people who greeted us. Food is yummy. Seems like a reliable Chinese spot!
2021-09-26,1,The food has gotten so bad you just cant eat it. Salty. Flavorless. Even the white rice wasnt cooked correctly.  Had simple food.  Spicy dumplings in hot peanut sauce. It wasnt hot. Wasnt peanut. Salty brown water with bone and grizzle fragments in the meat inside the dumplings. Awful.
2021-09-19,5,I love this spot. It's my go to for certain things. I like to sit outside and eat while people watching. It's a bring your own bottle spot. The food is great, the service is fast.
2021-08-02,5,If you grew up on Hot Wok, New China and anything that mimics fresh food cook to order then you are going to love this spot. Super delicious with speedy service. Outdoor dining is available with a nice view of Washington street. Would come back!
2021-07-10,1,The food was late because the driver went to the wrong place so my food came cold, and on top of that I found 3 hairs in my tofu. I called the restaurant and they asked me to send a picture to a phone number for "proof" I will never eat there again.
2021-07-10,1,Ask for my phone number. Repeated my address, took my entire order... asked how much I want to TIP the driver, I said $2 and he said sorry we are busy can't deliver. HORRIBLE.
2021-06-23,1,It was horrible! I went there yesterday and got a lunch special that had a roach in the food. It was disgusting! Not eating Chinese food from this place ever again. I recommend you going somewhere else.
2021-05-13,5,We ate outdoors and the waitress wore a mask. The food was exceptional! They have egg drop soup without corn!!! Hard to find and it was fresh and delicious.My son and his girlfriend also loved the vegetable sushi. The dumplings were great! I had the vegetarian version of chicken with mushrooms and green onions. Everything was so tasty and fresh. I will return soon.
2021-05-11,1,I order from precious a lot and it's one of my favorite places in Hoboken. I ordered garlic chicken and came across a cigarette butt, I'm surprised disgusted because this out of norm for them. And of course I didn't notice right away and had eaten about half of the meal. Needless to say I won't be ordering from here for a while
2021-03-07,4,I'm pretty picky about my Chinese food. I don't like anything too oily or that tastes like it's been defrosted. This place fits the bill. Good tasty food that taste fresh. Especially their BBQ spare ribs, very juicy and meaty.
2021-02-19,4,Incredible food! The menu has an great range of food and also offers sushi! My personal favorites are the dumplings, general tso and chicken amazing. The portion sizes are generous. The only thing that's lacking is the atmosphere inside the restaurant. It's evident they do a lot more take out (which may only be due to Covid)
2021-01-26,5,We just moved to the neighborhood and this was our first takeout order. The food was amazing! The edamame needed salt... but the shrimp and broccoli and the ginger chicken was so fresh and tasty!!
2021-01-21,5,After a long awaited reopening, I was finally able to order Precious. Delivery came quickly and was piping hot. I wish I tried more so I could have a longer rave but I must say, my ginger prawns with green beans was amazing. I got it with brown rice (there was no extra charge for brown rice, finally!) and it was seriously enough for two meals. I ate well past the point of being full and still had plenty leftover for lunch the next day. The prawns were huge and there were a ton of them, cooked perfectly. The green beans literally were overflowing out of the takeout box (all cooked wonderfully crunchy). Okay, I'll stop talking about how big the portion is. The ginger sauce was seriously so great. It was flavorful and rich and there was enough to soak through all of the rice. They have such a big menu with so many different options that I'll definitely want to order some appetizers next time (a lot of reviews mention the sushi pizza) but it will be tough for me to not get that ginger sauce again. This place is wonderful and I am so happy they are open again. I wholeheartedly recommend! And if you are a ginger everything enthusiast like me, get the ginger prawns.
2021-01-19,5,This is one of my go to spots for Chinese.  Very consistent.  Great for delivery.  I've never had a problem here and the food is good (caveat I've only ever ordered Chinese from here and never tried the Japanese )
2021-01-15,4,Popped in for lunch and had a great lunch meal for under $25.00 for two! What I love about Precious is if you can't decide between Chinese or Japanese you can have the best of both worlds. They offer lunch specials M-F and I got one from the Chinese menu and one fromThe Japanese menu. Two roll special, kept it basic with avocado and California roll. Very fresh rolls and delicious. It came with soup and salad. Also we ordered the general Tso lunch special which comes with egg or veg roll and rice/ brown/white/fried. One of the best general TSo's I've eaten. Not too spicy and not too fried. Perfectly cooked! Service was great. Speedy for lunch and everyone was very hospitable. Got a new lunch spot in Hoboken :)
2021-01-14,5,Just finished my meal from Precious.  I have always been a fan,  but I tried their new Mongolian beef dish.  Delicious!!!   Great addition to the menu.  I always appreciate their prompt professional service.  Never had a bad meal there.  Love you guys!
2020-12-14,2,So I'm giving 2 stars. I just moved to the are and I was in the need of a good Chinese takeout spot to order from. I ordered twice already, food was good not going to lie. However the second time I ordered, I ordered through uber eats and they didn't have the option to substitute pork fried rice. So I called them and spoke to someone on the phone. Apparently it was such a hard time to substitute for a different kind of rice. The guy on the phone was giving me a hard time and saying that I couldn't substitute because it wasn't an option I would have to go with what was set with the dish which was white rice. I tried to explain to him 5x that if it was such a big deal I'll pay for the rice separately and you can just put the fried rice in my order bag. He was still insisting that I couldn't do that. So after 6x of repeating my simple request he called the manager and the manager OKed the request. so when I asked for the add in I asked for a small order since it was just going to be me and my partner. He said no it has to be a large because it's a small uber eats ordered and charged me 10$!!! Unbelievable. It's a shame because the food was actually decent and for a second I thought I found my permanent take out spot. There's other choices out there. Don't order from here.
2020-12-08,4,I'd certainly return for the Singapore mei fun as well as the hot and sour soup, welcome treatments for a cold though maybe I should have gotten delivery instead of walking to Hoboken. The cold noodles aren't a strong point. But in addition to solid work on a couple of classics, Precious scores with a more audacious item, the tuna pizza. It has tuna and avocado and I'm not sure what else, but should appeal to non-purist fish enthusiasts.
2020-11-03,5,Really tasty sesame chicken, vegetarian general Tso chicken was very good! Sauce and quality is amazing! Soups were hot and very generous lunch portions. Free delivery with Seamless +
2020-10-11,5,Precious is by far, the best Chinese food in Hoboken. Their vegetarian meat dishes are the best I've had and I crave it from time to time. They have been closed since the start of COVID in March and no other place does vegetarian meat dishes like they do. Came in for their grand re-opening today (10/11/2020). They have new outdoor seating, glass protective screens at the register and indoor seating as well. Their food is still amazing - please get the vegetarian sesame chicken! And still affordable - lunch comes with a side of rice (brown or white) and an appetizer (soup, egg roll or veggie roll). Please don't hesitate to come and support a staple of Hoboken!
2020-09-19,5,Hands down the best Chinese food in the area. Happy to see the sign on their storefront that they plan to reopen by October! Every dish we've ever ordered was fresh, flavorful and never greasy like others can be. Generous portions at a reasonable price. Will be ordering often to support them again when they reopen.
2020-09-19,5,They might reopen in October!My favorite Chinese restaurant of all time. There is nothing like Precious. They have the biggest and best egg rolls you have ever seen or tasted. Their ginger chicken with string beans has beautiful slices of fresh ginger and garlic, large pieces of white meat chicken, and the beans are always tender crisp and green. Their cold sesame noodles are to die for. I love their pad Thai, their Kung pao, orange chicken, chicken chow mein, egg foo young, and mu shu. One of my favorites is their pineapple chicken fried rice. Literally everything is knock your socks off. I hope they really do reopen in October. I will order one of everything.
2020-02-12,4,Solid Chinese. Delivery is so freakin fast, it arrived to my apartment 3 blocks away in less than 8 minutes. I don't know how they did that. I like the chicken and broccoli, the fried rice and most everything else.
2020-02-06,1,I arrived looking to have a good lunch. I placed an order for chicken with broccoli with the notion that this is a staple at all local Chinese restaurants - an order I believed they wouldn't mess up. When it arrived it was doused in some kind of sauce that tasted rotten. In fact, the entire dish tasted like sour milk -- the chicken, sauce, and broccoli. Unfortunately, I didn't consult Yelp before patronizing this establishment but when I did I realized that there were quite a few 1 Star  reviews. The 1 Star reviews are accurate guys. Skip this place and go to the next.
2020-01-01,1,Ordered on my girlfriends grub hub account. After an hour and a half of waiting I called to ask for the status and they told me they never put the order in. Would give negative stars if that was an option.
2019-12-09,1,I rarely write yelp reviews, but I feel this is a much needed review for any new people to the area who aren't familiar with the Chinese food spots around here. I usually order from Lo-fatt-chow, which is amazing and hands down the best in Hoboken, but didn't today because they don't open till 5pm. So here we go...we ordered chicken/broccoli, chicken lo mein, and boneless spare ribs. The chicken was rubbery and the broccoli was barely cooked. The lo mein was just ok. The boneless spare ribs were tasteless. I would compare this place to mall Chinese food without the flavor. You should just grill a chicken breast with no seasoning and throw it over a pack of Ramen noodles and save yourself the money you'll waste here. Extremely disappointed.
2019-11-26,5,Amazing food, great service, and always quick! I order take out a lot and my food is always ready when I get here and always hot (whether I'm early or late). I love the lo mein, fried rice, and chicken and broccoli here. The staff is super nice and helpful and make for a great experience every time I come in. Great restaurant!
2019-11-23,4,Grabbed some takeout from Precious for dinner.  Egg Rolls, Crab Rangoon, General Tao and Shrimp LoMain.  All came packaged well in plastic takeout dishes and after a 5 min walk home all food was still at a perfect temp to eat.  Service is good and fast.  Would definitely return.
2019-11-03,1,This restaurant sucks. Don't come here. The worst services I've ever met. The waitress stupid and they spitted ptysis into the dish.
2019-10-26,1,I recently placed an order for two lunch specials of egg foo young.  When I received two orders of fried rice and egg rolls for $16. I called back to find out where the rest of my food was the hostess was nasty and said I never told them I was ordering egg foo young.  I was than told it would be an additional $23. I asked why so much and she got nasty again and said that it was not a lunch special. She continued to argue with me that I didn't order correctly and it was my fault. I ended up bringing back my dinner and the hostess was nasty again only to offer part of the refund back. This was the second time I ordered a lunch special and when I got my meal I was charged $15. When I called back I again was told I didn't order correctly.I will never order again from there, they just take orders, repeat what you ordered and than send and charge you what they want. They definitely need to work on their customer service skills
2019-10-21,3,Been hearing this is the best chinese in Hoboken so I put it to the test. Delivery took a little longer than other chinese spots I have ordered from.  I went with the classic item on every chinese restaurant menu... General Tso's. It's like the Big Mac of Chinese food. This one isnt you your classic general tso's. I prefer the classic. This one is like chicken tenders in some gooey red sauce. It isnt too spicy so you don't have to worry there. We also tried the pork dumplings and the vegetable fried rice. The dumplings were good. Good pork flavor as well. Fried rice tasted like... fried rice. Overall, good experience but not good enough to change from my normal go-to spot of number 1 fine chinese. Not bad though.
2019-09-06,1,Last time we Precious we ordered in. When I opened the container for our cold sesame noodles there was a large insect (maybe a baby cockroach?) cooked into the food and right on top of all the noodles. We immediately called the restaurant to notify them. They asked if we wanted a new dish and we told them we only wanted a refund since all the food was going in the garbage. I appreciate that they provided the refund and were apologetic, but we won't be returning here again. I've also read many other Yelp reviews of this establishment that document "foreign objects" in their food, like steel wire, fingernails, hair, etc. so this unfortunately seems to be a larger cleanliness issue and health hazard than it is an accident. Again, we won't be patronizing Precious again.
2019-07-23,2,I arrived to the restaurant and I felt pretty comfortable at first. Then my nasty server accompany does at the table. He was very dry, mean, read, and very dismissive. I couldn't believe it was my first time at this restaurant I was so disappointed however the food was really good. when it comes to the restaurant great food is just not enough. He actually stood at our table to collect our receipts and he evaluated our receipts at the table right in front of us as though we were going to under tip him. How rude is that? I will never be coming back to this restaurant again.
2019-07-20,2,Ordered lunch special yesterday, dry sauteed string brands  with vegetable Fred rice and wonton soup.Total plus tax $8, which is not bad, they also give a package of rice noodle snack with it.Dry sautéed string beans - worst I ever had, I have this dish all the time, the one I have from Chinese supermarket is even better than this...Rice and soup is okay, not good, but still okayIt's a cheap lunch, but you got what you paid for, stay away from the string beans
2019-06-23,4,Never went in person,  but I ordered deliveryThe delivery came 20 minutes sooner than predicted, so that was great.I ordered the cool summer roll which was shrimp tempura on the inside and avocado and salmon on top. It was yummy.I also had the crab rangoon. It was weird. I did see lumps of kani was was great. However, the cream cheese did not look like cream cheese. It looked like the broth of creamed corn soup. It also did not come with any dipping sauce, so luckily I had duck sauce at my home. I tried eating it plain at first, but again, it was weird.My friends ordered lo mein, which looked pretty standard, as well as California rolls. No complaints on their end.
2019-05-22,3,I have eaten lunch here several times and the food is good, but the service is awful.  The first time, I had a female server who was pleasant, but the last 2 times, I had a male server who was cold and rude.  I also ordered shrimp and broccoli and there were just 4 shrimps.  I brought a friend from out of town and she was shocked by how rude our server was.  Management needs to get on top of this!
2019-05-10,2,Let me start by saying that the food here is great. They have good lunch specials and a nice ambiance, and I frequent here a lot.The reason for the low rating is the extremely rude service. I always tip well when I eat in, but working as a dog walker, sometimes I just need a quick bite to eat (soup or an eggroll). Last time I came into an empty restaurant and asked if I could order just a soup, but was told there is a minimum to sit. No problem. I ordered to go and ate it at the outside tables (also empty). 5 minutes later I picked up my trash and left happy. Today I ordered an egg roll to go, and when I tried to quickly sit and eat outside (still an empty restaurant), I was told I couldn't eat there and would have to move. Seriously?! I just purchased something from your property that will be consumed in less than two minutes, the restaurant is empty and I am at an outside table which I will fully bus as soon as I am finished, and you still refuse to let me stay?! Terrible, terrible customer service. Shame on you!
2019-05-10,1,the service is absolutely horrendous at this restaurant. 0 for service. 7 for food. 3 for ambiance.the server will make you feel uncomfortable and tell you they're closing in 20 minutes at 8:45pm, when they aren't. they are rude and inconsiderate.also, for delivery, my friend has been called a racial slur because the driver did not appreciate the tip he was given and on a separate occasion, I was screamed at profusely for tipping within the 15% range on delivery.don't patronize this establishment.
2019-05-06,1,I guess it takes a traumatic experience to submit your first yelp review. However after finding a side of human hair in my order, after finishing said order, I cannot in good faith allow others to order from this establishment.Shame as this is normally my go-to Chinese spot in hoboken. However I may suggest hair nets....Full disclosure my hair is neither jet black, nor straight.....
2019-04-14,5,Ahhh cool this place is awesome I love the sashimi appetizer and the hot and sour soup. The spider roll also is wonderful.  Love theses guys!
2019-04-07,1,Never had an issue with the spot and has always been my go to in regards to good chinese food in New Jersey. With that being said went in for dinner on a Sunday evening. Definitely not busy and seated right away. My server immediately said " one or two?" And I responded "hi, how are you?" Server Ignored greet and asked again "one or two,? " In which I responded " just one person."Really one star rating isnt for the food but rather the service and lack of professionalism of the waiter. Didn't feel welcomed and when I ordered my food he proceeded to watch me eat my food, didn't refill water, I had to keep asking for everything like soy sauce, and chili sauce for my noodles. When the Bill came he placed on table and never once asked " did you want anything else," or more importantly refill my water. I had the bill sit on table and he walked over twice to ask if I " was ready to pay." I paid the bill which was $ 14 and proceeded to walk out. Did not leave a tip as I don't believe in Leaving a tip to a server that is rude. And glad I didn't because not even 3 minutes outside the restaurant when I left he screams down Washington running behind me saying "excuse me," with the bill in hand. I turn around and he says "no tip?" I said thats correct I don't leave tip for bad service. He gets mad and yells " next time don't sit in, order food to go." I ignore and walk away. Terrible experience and will never patronize this business again!!!
2019-02-27,5,Excellent food, fast delivery! Not sure why this place only has 3.5 stars..? Glad a friend recommended it as the "go-to" Chinese place in Hoboken. The sushi was fresh, our entrees of fried rice, chow fun, and general tso's all arrived hot, delicious and less than half an hour after we ordered.
2019-01-02,1,I've been a customer here for years until yesterday. The food is average. I had food delivered yesterday and the delivery guy was over the top rude. Apparently he figured he deserved a larger tip and didn't hesitate to say so. He became belligerent, started calling me names. I'm not kidding about that - I have never experienced such a thing from a restaurant employee. Also noticed that I was overcharged on the receipt. I would never recommend Precious - it's nothing special and they provide horrible service.
2018-12-21,5,Everything is delicious! Their wonton and chicken rice soups are the bomb! The lunch specials are such a great deal. Very generous portions at reasonable prices. Love going to the restaurant and ordering takeout.
2018-12-16,2,Ordered from this place on a Sunday afternoon. I don't even know if I'd consider this Chinese food. We ordered shrimp rolls to start and they were bland and soggy. Our entrees were also extremely bland. My boyfriend got general tso's chicken and it was covered in soggy batter with barely any sauce. My chicken and broccoli had zero flavor and the sauce was like water. Not the consistency like chicken and broccoli I've had before. I probably would not order form this place again, although the delivery was quick and on-time. Better choices in the area for sure!
2018-11-21,4,Chinese food is a hard one to say good vs bad as there isn't really a ton of absolutes. I feel like Chinese food more than any other type of restaurant is circumstance/timing on when you are there. Sadly... in any event Precious is as consistent for Chinese Food as I have experienced. I think the restaurant can use a slight upgrade in ambiance but then again that isn't why someone would go for Chinese food.
2018-11-14,2,Vegetable fried rice was dry, vegetable roll wasn't good, egg roll was dry, and garlic broccoli was fine. Thai iced tea was not good.
2018-10-20,2,First off frozen egg rolls, meh. only with msg in hot and sour - how lazy. singapore mei fun odd taste and I think spoiled meats. Not good. low mein was ok, but nothing to write home about. Definitely a reason not many people.
2018-08-22,1,an hour and 45 min for delivery when app says 45 minutes; 2 calls to resturant later and one call to grub hub, 10 more minutes 10 more minutes, STILL NO FUCKING FOOD
2018-08-09,5,First time in Hoboken and came here for dinner. Chinese food at this restaurant was amazing!!! Customer service and the quality of food was really good. Their dishes are fresh with an authentic taste. Prices are reasonable, environment is clean and relaxing. Totally worth coming into this restaurant!
2018-08-05,3,This is in response to Eric P.'s review. I read that review when trying to pick a Chinese place and laughed at the thought of a delivery guy doing that. Well. I got the same delivery guy. He gave me my food and said are you tipping in cash? And I said no, I tipped on my card. He stared at me and didn't say anything. So then I said through seamless. You tip on the card through the app. He stared at me again. He looked as if he had just been dooped. And then turned around and walked away. So weird. So uncomfortable. I assumed they would have fired him. Idk, the food is pretty decent so I guess I'll give it a three.
2018-07-28,3,This is probably one my favorite Chinese restaurant. But I have one issue with them. They don't listen to directions. I tell them every time I place my order "please no scallions" and every single time I get my food I have scallions.  That's why o give 3 instead of 5
2018-07-07,1,Extremely rude delivery person. He muttered a rude comment to me when he rudely shoved the bag towards me. Unbelievable. Will never order from here again.
2018-06-26,4,My go-to Chinese food place in Hoboken. The chicken and rice soup is delightful and can't miss here. We usually get sesame chicken, chicken with broccoli, fried rice or beef with string beans. All very good and very reliable. Delivery is quick and easy. If you're looking for quality Chinese food, this is your spot.
2018-06-20,3,I don't normally write negative reviews but I'm still upset about today. I go here often for lunch takeout because I do enjoy their Chinese food. Today, myself and 3 coworkers all ordered lunch to go. Once we got it, the 3 of them went back to the office and I decided to stay and eat it there since I had a doctors appt next door in 15 minutes. I was the ONLY one sitting on their outdoor patio (and they only had one table inside) and I was kicked out. A waiter came out and literally said "If you want to eat here, I have to put your food on a plate and you have to tip me." First of all, tipping is ALWAYS option and second, I was one person eating alone and clearly not leaving behind a big mess. I'm not sure how a restaurant who kicks their own customers out stays in business but I won't be coming back here.
2018-03-30,5,Best casual Chinese and sushi place in Hoboken! Their lunch specials really hit the spot - well priced, and satisfying. Everything from the seaweed salad, fresh sashimi, chow fun, chicken wings, and sushi rolls were generous and tasty. All and all a solid lunch or casual dinner, delivery, and takeout place to satisfy your titillating tastebuds for Asian noshes. Ooh the mochi is good too. Next time tuna pizza, you're on deck.
2018-03-23,4,The food is OK - not great. Good hot n sour soup, edamame.  Ok Protein Trio and Pepper Chicken. Quality of rest of food varies.  Their Sashimi is not great. I would have given them a 3*. But their service is very good. And while their interior is casual, it always feels warm and intimate.  Being BYOB helps too.
2018-03-13,1,This place has changed a lot. I'm not sure if it's under new ownership but the customer service sucks and the sushi is sub par. I used to enjoy coming here but that isn't the case anymore. I guess that would explain the restaurant being empty every day when I walk past. I really hope management changes the wait staff and get some people who are personable and know how to ensure he customers keep coming back. Sincerely,No longer a customer
2018-03-05,1,Did Precious change ownership or management? We used to love it... the white meat chicken used to be great. Our dinner last night tasted and looked like it came from a different restaurant. Gross, chicken was not nearly as "fresh" tasting. Really honestly odd and I don't think we'll be ordering from there anymore. Unfortunate, it was our favorite (and only) Chinese place in Hoboken.
2018-01-26,1,I used to like Precious until I started ordering delivery from them. Their delivery driver is violent and abusive. If you do not give him what he deems as an acceptable tip, he will curse at you and slam the doors in your building. Each time I gave him a 20% tip and he freaked out. I called after he left and the person on the phone replied "sorry". Last time I order from them, or even go there to eat. "SORRY" but you just lost a customer.
2018-01-05,1,I am a regular.  Ordered delivery.  They sent the wrong dumpling.  I called to tell them.  Not credit.  The next time I ordered I mentioned that they sent me the wrong dumpling the last time.   Not a knowlegdement....doubted me.  I spoke to the same person...I know them there.  Disappointed in the customer service.  Food is fine but due to this recent issue my score is low.
2018-01-04,1,This Chinese spot is awful! I ordered food here for delivery and it arrived very late. The food is disgusting! I got 2 orders of Thai iced teas and it taste so bad. I ordered a vegetarian soup and lomein and it's so bad I had to throw everything out!
2017-12-25,1,Zero Stars, but you have to place 1 for a review. I decided to give this place a second chance as the 1st time their was a dead roach in my appetizer. This doesn't ever happen to me but stayed calm and brushed it off as bad luck? The second  time was just as bad but with poor customer service. We came in and was quoted some time to be seated. Patiently waiting we saw 2 tables come available with a 3rd table already paying which would accommodate us. Instead they gave 2 tables away to two other parties who came in after us. Don't expect a quality meal nor service, just rude staff! There's better options than this place. Never again!
2017-12-25,5,Excellent Chinese Food + Excellent Waiter Service! Very convenient location on Washington Street in downtown Hoboken. Comfortable atmosphere for dining in, and our favorite take-out in Hoboken.
2017-10-17,3,I usually like their food but something has changed. The fried calamari was tasteless and there was only 5 pieces on the plate. I ordered the Shrimp & Scallops in garlic sauce for my dinner. The scallops were non-existent. It's like they took one scallop and chopped it into pieces. Very bizarre. The broccoli was also WAY undercooked. Can't say I'd recommend this place anymore.
2017-10-10,4,I like their General Tso's chicken!  They make it really well and everything they make is fresh.  Other places the food looks like its been sitting around for while but Precious you can tell its freshly made and its really good. Their soups are excellent!  The one with all the mixed vegetables and chicken.
2017-09-24,3,Gen Tso chicken I thought was sweet and spicy ... oh well this was only sweet - average taste. I did ask for an  additional order of plain white rice in the additional comments - to no avail. Well presented though, e.g. 2 enclosed tea bags with the fortune cookies, and other condiments is a nice touch.
2017-09-08,4,Ordered food for delivery! Got to my apartment a little before it was supposed to be delivered! I ordered an egg roll, wonton soup and chicken & broccoli. I loved the egg roll and the chicken and broccoli (don't know how a Chinese food place food mess it up). Was very pleased with my meal until I had the wonton soup. The wontons were over cooked and were falling apart. The brother had no taste at all with huge price of spinach  floating in it. Since the broth was very blended it absorbed the flavor of the spinach. Other than that they are very good
2017-07-07,1,This place closes their kitchen earlier and earlier every time I call and try to order food. Tonight is Friday night and they are supposed to be open until 11pm. But I just called at 10:35pm and was told that oh no kitchen already closed!!  Not the first time this has happened. During the week they are supposed to be open until 10pm. But good luck getting anything from them past 9:15pm. Although their food is pretty good. I've finally given up trying to order from them and am now looking for a better and more customer friendly restaurant.
2017-06-01,4,My favorite go to dish is chicken and broccoli.  They are a solid Chinese restaurant.  The service is good!
2017-05-27,1,Had dinner Saturday night, atrocious service, rude waitstaff, terrible experience. Don't ever come here!I will never come back!
2017-05-20,4,crab ragoon is my all time favorite, their mei fun and  pineapple fried rice is also really good and thier sushi.
2017-05-17,1,Didn't give us what we ordered and no sauce with delivery. Delivery guy didn't even wanna climb a flight of stairs. Avoid this place
2017-03-18,1,Note: I have not eaten here, but when you see my photos, you will understand why.  I walked by this morning and saw their food delivery sitting out in the open, on the dirty sidewalk, exposed to whatever anyone wanted to put in it. Perhaps there was a miscommunication between their supplier, or the person accepting the delivery was late, but either way, food should be packaged in a certain way when it's delivered. Feel free to eat there, but you won't be enjoying my company while you are there! I know this is an atypical review for me, but I felt compelled to share.
2017-01-27,4,Really good asian food. I was sick with a cold so I ordered mostly soups and they were perfect. Hot n sour soup was really delicious, and was def the most flavorful hot n sour soup I ever had. I got the Satay beef soup with thin noodles as my main dish, it was so big I could only eat a third of it. Beef was tender and full of flavor. My friend ordered sushi (Precious Roll) it was also so amazing it practically melt in your mouth.
2017-01-15,5,This is the only Chinese food place that offers white meat only in the sesame chicken and general tso.
2017-01-01,5,Stopped in during my Christmas Break. Kiddos don't do sushi. Ordered Chinese for them and sushi for hubby and me. So delicious. Bathrooms are immaculate. Service is excellent. Prices are great. BYOB helps a lot. Thought it was a fluke and went back two days later. Still awesome. I love this place and it has become my new favorite.
2016-11-29,4,Ordered from here while at a friend's house. I got the chicken and mixed vegetables with brown rice and an egg roll. Everything was pretty good! I'm really picky with my Chinese food and I'm glad they use real chicken. I hate how some Chinese food places have "chicken" that is slimy/chewy/fatty and gross. My only gripe was that when I got there she said cash only unless over $20. She didn't mention this on the phone when I placed the order for pickup. I was lucky I had enough cash on me.
2016-11-19,5,My favorite place in Hoboken hands down. The portions are HUGE and the prices are low. 6.75 for lunch special with a huge soup, a huge lunch portion, a black tea bag and a fortune cookie. That's enough for 2 of me. Literally. This is 2 lunches for me.A great deal also is the rainbow roll special which is 11$ and comes with huge portion of the roll, 4 pieces of sushi, a soup AND a salad. You can't beat that.My humble opinion anyways Oh and they have bubble tea and Thai iced tea . What else do you want?????
2016-11-10,5,Just moved back to Weehawken after 7 years away, thank goodness for me Precious is still here.  They by far have the freshest home cooked chinese and their sushi is a nice extra.  Love their "dumplings", gyoza, lo meine, chicken dishes are always superior to regular chinese places.  They deliver quickly and always have the order correct. Love that they use fresh veggies not canned, i.e. mushrooms.  The baby eggplant in garlic sauce is the best anywhere.  Very tasty and keeps for a few days which is good since the container seems endless.
2016-11-05,4,Just moved into the neighborhood and our new apartment building recommended this place so we figured we would give it a whirl while walking around. The service was great - super attentive, the food cheap & delicious. Being a big noodle fan I really enjoyed their lo mein. It wasn't greasy like you sometimes find. It was busy inside, even at weird-o-clock when we stopped in for a super late 4:45pm lunch. Haha despite being busy they still had lots of table so we were able to get a spot easily. Food came out quickly and I saw lots of people ordering the sushi so if that's your jam you'll have to check it out.
2016-11-02,3,As one reviewer put it, this is a Chinese food place worth eating IN. I mostly say that because their wait service is very fast and does a great job.As for the food...it's fine, nothing extraordinary in my opinion. I ordered a red dragon roll (crab meat, avocado, and cucumber, with spicy tuna on top) and it was a good roll, but ultimately nothing special. My wife says Precious has her favorite General Tso's chicken and veggie dumplings, but I sampled them and just don't see it.
2016-10-26,1,Just walked out on this place. There is a 15 minimum on credit cards? Really? I don't think most people realize there should be NO minimum on credit cards, let alone $15. Ridiculous. I'm letting Amex know about this.
2016-10-25,1,Food is great - the lie thru their teeth when ordering delivery - I was told the delivery guy came to my house rang the bell and no one answered so he left.  An hour later he delivered the food and said that a street was closed by me - that he had not been here - but that he was stuck in traffic.  Will never order from here again.
2016-10-08,4,It's the only Chinese place in Hoboken actually worth eating IN at! The place is really nice, and has a great atmosphere. I've come here many times and had such a great time. The place is BYO, with Sparrows liquor right next door. It's perfect for large groups, even on a weekend, because they always have room still. (Large place, never packed.) The food is very good, (Singapore chow mei fun is incredible, so is the dragon and Phoenix) although I haven't tried their sushi. The prices are low, lower than any other restaurant in Hoboken. They do take out as well, but this is really a nice place to eat at.
2016-10-04,4,Food is actually pretty good here eps Lo Mein and Shrimp and Brocoli. Dont know if its a good thing or not that its below the gym.
2016-08-25,2,This review only pertains to the Chinese dinner menu YMMV. I have been coming to Precious for 10 years now.Precious is one of the best Chinese places in town... But that's not saying much. They were really amazing a few years ago but they have been slipping year after year. Cost: They are the MOST expensive Chinese restaurant in town.Delivery: They are usually very fast. Sometimes too quick 15-20 minutes from phone call to delivery(is the food pre-cooked or cooked at all?). On rare occasions they have taken over an hour.At best: Their food ranges from ok to tasteless. Great menu options and heathy choices. Lots of veggi and vegan options. Good delivery containers and plenty of duck sauce and fortune cookies.At worst: Their food can be best described as flavorless. Soggy egg rolls, watery soups are a frequent complaint. Meat portions are small, over cooked most times and sometimes the chicken can have a strange odor. Their noodle dishes are very oily and lacks any flavor.Overall: Most times the food is edible but for the price $25-$30 (egg roll, soup, appetizer and main course) per person is unacceptable compared to other places in Jersey City or NYC for much less. I feel people eat here because there aren't many choices in town. They were truly a great place to eat years ago it's a shame to see a personal favorite get so bad. I hope they can get it together.
2016-08-21,5,Love the food here!  Delivery is always quick with good quality.  Great lunch specials as well
2016-08-15,1,Sesame chicken was great and crispy. BUT WHAT?!? Chow Mein has no noodles?!?!?!? Big discussion needs to be held in the nation chow mein temple roight now!!!
2016-07-31,1,Nooooo. My husband and I ordered delivery because it was a rainy day and we haven't had takeout Chinese in forever.  I went with my go-to general tso chicken and he got the Chang -do chicken which was described as a chef specialty in a Kung Pao sauce.  The general tso was so hard, burnt, and overcooked I could barely bite through it. The Chang-do was also incredibly disappointing and was nowhere near what I would describe as a Kung Pao, it tasted like burnt soy sauce, we trashed it. Thankfully we got a ginger salad and 2 egg rolls which were edible.  I would never order from here again sadly.
2016-07-28,1,Can't comment on the quality of the food, because it still isn't here. The delivery sevice SUCKS. NEVER AGAIN. Don't ewaste your time.
2016-07-08,3,Came here with a friend of mine at lunchtime.  The sweet & sour chicken was yummy and there was A/C on a hot day.  Great ambiance where you could have a conversation so I was happy.
2016-06-05,3,their Chinese food was very American style, not authentic Chinese food, but their sushi was really good. I love it!! I will return for sushi but definitely not Chinese food lol
2016-05-15,3,Service could use help and a little personality wouldn't hurt , good thing good was decent
2016-04-01,1,I took out food last week from precious and have never been so SICK in my entire life.  I got the worst food poisoning I have ever had from the Sesame Chicken.  I was so sick I passed out from the vomiting...I have multiple other friends who this has happened to as well.They should have a random health inspection here and I guarantee they will FAIL.AWFUL
2016-02-21,3,First time ordering .. We usually get Ho King, but my daughter wanted Chinese and I wanted Thai, so we figured we'd give this place a shot .. Excellent selection .. Very slow delivery service.. It took a long time to get the food.. The prices were good, but the food was very very greasy and the oil tasted like the fryers haven't been changed ever. We will go back to our usual spot next time.. Will not be ordering again.
2016-02-03,4,Favorite place to go for Chinese food in hoboken. Staff isnt the warmest but what can you do. Love their sushi and fried rice would definitely recommend!
2016-01-25,5,Very delicious Chinese food. There must be a few different chefs around at different times because around lunch Precious seems even better than at dinner. LOVE their egg rolls! I particularly like their pepper-steak beef and their triple delight!
2016-01-24,3,Everything here is great but the FDA needs to follow up with them in the amount of MSG they put on the food. You think a hangover is bad.... Just eat some Lo mein and you probably won't make it to work
2016-01-22,4,I always get the general Taos chicken.  Sometimes it could be hit or miss.  But for the most part it is pretty good Chinese food
2016-01-22,4,Definitely the best Chinese food in Hoboken. I have tried all other chinese restaurants in the area and none measure up. I've introduced several of my friends who've become fans as well. My favorites are beef with garlic sauce, boneless spare ribs, scallion pancakes, and pan fried dumplings.
2016-01-22,5,This is my go to for Chinese cuisine. I especially like their soups. When I get take out, they have my order ready lightning fast. The spicy chicken and broccoli is my favorite. The broccoli is always fresh and the chicken flavorful.
2016-01-18,2,Thoroughly mediocre. The foods not bad but its just standard Chinese food, not anything special.
2015-12-23,3,Got Delivery with coworkers. Opted for Chinese food lunch special shrimp & broccoli with veg fried rice and veg roll. Veg roll was drowned in oil. Refused to eat it. Oil was sitting in bag. There was 4 shrimps I think in my broccoli bowl. ummm. And a lot of sauce. Yuk. Forgot to say easy on the sauce. Fried rice is not fried really... you can see a lot of the white rice because it didn't get touched with the soy sauce at the used in the pan to supposedly fry it. But actually I ended up liking the rice because it wasn't that much fried. For vegetables it only had peas and onion tho. Coworkers had sushi. Tasted great n looked good. Will try that next time.
2015-12-20,1,Avoid this place....  The food is only so,so but cashiers - especially the young girl at checkout - is as rude as can be.  It's not worth being insulted.....
2015-12-03,2,Place was ok but food was cold. I had a cup of wonton soup with hot broth and cold wonton. Rice with sea food had bits of hot and cold pieces too. Service was good but would  not come back.
2015-10-14,4,Chicken and broccoli is great. Sesame chicken is good. And speedy delivery - will definitely order again!
2015-10-11,5,Precious is my go-to Chinese food restaurant for take out in Hoboken. Food is always delicious and quickly made. The wonton soup is one of the best I've had. I have tried many of their entrees over the years and have never been disappointed.Precious also has dine-in service.Their servers are attentive without being intrusive. There is a liquor store next door, which makes this BYO experience very easy. Precious also offers sushi but I'd stick to their Chinese food and save sushi for Robongi, Okinawa, Illuzion or Ayame.
2015-09-21,4,Ordered from this spot this weekend. Pleasantly surprised. Good Chinese food, not greasy. They had tons of faux meat options which is awesome and unusual! Really good vegetarian chicken & vegetarian scallops. Everything was really good. The shrimp fried rice was a bit heavy on the salt though..They have a very diverse menu. Didn't try the sushi - next time. Would definitely order from again. Recommended!
2015-09-06,3,Typical Chinese restaurant that also serves Japanese cuisine. Here is what we ordered:- Hot and sour soup (average)- Chicken and broccoli (slightly above average, good flavor)- Steamed chicken dumplings (good - above average, tastes fresh)- Chicken with peanuts (good - pretty well made)- Maki spicy sushi combo (slightly below average, sushi broke apart and the soy sauce was super salty. Sushi was also a little sweet. The delivery was really fast off of seamless web - we got our food in fifteen minutes and the time predicted was 40-50. They charge a 3.00 delivery fee like a lot of restaurants in Hoboken and had a minimum of 20...which is pretty high for Chinese. If you absolutely need Chinese food...you could order from here...I don't think I need Chinese that badly.
2015-08-18,3,Honestly, the food is pretty good whenever I get takeout but my first time dining in was pretty bad.I get seated outside on a weekday around 8pm. There is no one sitting outside but yet the waiter is hovering. Nothing wrong with being attentive but he was literally standing over us most of the night.Our waiter also served our appetizer, salad and dinner all at once. What was the need for this?  By the time I got to the dinner it was obviously cold.  I was also surprised that there very little rice with general tso's.  Normally when I get takeout it comes in a container but this was a tiny little scoop on the side.  When I got full I asked for the dish to be wrapped.  It was exactly half the dish. Half the rice and half the chicken. The next day when I open it up I noticed he didn't include the rice. Why would you throw it out? The bubble tea was not made properly and I would not recommend. The tapioca balls clumped together like one giant rock at the bottom of the glass.I felt very rushed and there was no need. Will probably only do takeout from now on.3 star food but a 1 star service.
2015-08-05,5,Precious is like death and taxes, you know they are consistent with quality and on time. 6 years and only one order has taken longer the 45 minutes. Most of the time they are at my door in 20-30 minutes. Precious noodle, chicken pad tai are all quality. Sushi is good for take out and you get quantity for your money. It's fresh and cold or hot depending on what you order. Keep it up...
2015-07-26,1,With so many excellent restaurants to choose from on Washington, this place should be AVOIDED. The food is only fair at best. The service is down right surly. We had two entrees. The pan fried noodles with beef was just ok. The beef strips were full of gristle and tasted bland. The sauce was runny like water. The veggies were excellent, at least. However, this entree shined in comparison to the Seafood delight. All the seafood pieces tasted just alike, like old fish. It is a bit disturbing to get scallops, crab meat, lobster, and shrimp which taste nothing like they are supposed to taste. And did I mention the surly server? Yeah, there was that, also.Just don't bother with this yuck joint.
2015-07-25,2,They literally never answer the phone when you want to order which is extremely inconvenient unfortunately. We do really enjoy the food but the whole process of obtaining the food is such a process at times it makes it unenjoyable and upsetting. Their hours are not posted online which makes it more difficult! Help pleaseeee
2015-06-21,3,Came here about a week ago with my boyfriend. We wanted inexpensive sushi and they have this awesome deal that is 3 spicy maki rolls for $15. Couldn't say no! I'm usually a special roll kind of gal but I wanted to keep it simple this time. The spicy maki combo came with spicy tuna, spicy salmon, and spicy California roll! All were very delicious but didn't taste as fresh.For appetizer we got salad and miso soup. The miso soup got cold very quick but it was like any normal miso soup. Satisfactory. The salad however, is usually my favorite infamous for the delicious orange tangy dressing- this dressing however was sweet and tasted like they added duck sauce which made me put the salad away really fast... What a disappointment :( we also got free wontons which were delicious.The waiter barely spoke and was not all that helpful but he did his job. In the end, you can't beat the price and the sushi really filled me up! I had to take it to go! Would come back to try their Chinese food but I have had better sushi.
2015-06-07,5,I give them credit for changing the chairs. My finger eventually healed and I remain a faithful customer. Thank you, Precious.
2015-04-28,5,You can trust them when you rush and hungry, they have fantastic food and so fresh sushi.......nice and worm
2015-04-23,4,The fact that this restaurant doesn't have 4+ stars is beyond me. This is by FAR the best Chinese option in Hoboken and definitely one of the best Asian restaurants overall.Their General Tsos chicken is some of the best I've had and comes with a ton of fresh broccoli, which is great. I've also tried and enjoyed dumplings, scallion pancakes, lo mein, chicken wings, egg rolls and moo shu and everything is great! Their house mustard is a must try if you are into spicy.Their wonton soup is so good I sort of hate them for it. It is indeed SO good - delicate, thin skinned wontons with a delicious pork filling seasoned with ginger and scallions, a silky salty (but not too salty) broth and a bunch of fresh spinach that they stuff in the top of the container - that I can't have wonton soup from anywhere else anymore. I actually ordered some to work yesterday from some place in the city and threw half of it out :(.You can eat in at precious too - the inside is actually pretty cute, and it's BYO which is great! I guess I'm just an eat Chinese food in my PJs while watching Netflix kinda girl....Great food, fair (ish) prices and fast delivery/pickup earn Precious a solid 4 stars!
2015-03-29,3,I always order Chinese takeout from here because a) it's good! And b) it's cheap! That being said, the quality has gone down of this place in the last year or so. Still would recommend coming here to everyone!
2015-03-24,1,I used to order from here a couple times because the lunch specials are a steal (not for dinner though way too $$ for what you are getting), however after my last meal I think its time to say goodbye.  I got general tso chicken and there was WAY too much breading on the chicken, it was gross.  The vegetable fried rice was also very dry which didn't go well with the excess flour coming from the chicken.  Satay across the street offers much better food.
2015-03-06,1,******MUST READ******My girlfriend and I arrived home late from our vacation to St marten last night. We were starving for some quick food. We called up Precious and order some dumplings and an egg roll. Once we opened the food up and started eating I NOTICED A STEEL WIRE IN THE EGG ROLL!!!!!!!! I REPEAT A STEEL WIRE.. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF A SMALL CHILD STARTED EATING THIS AND DIDNT REALIZE IT???? This restaurant is dirty and needs to be shut down immediately. I'm also posting a picture of the wire
2015-02-21,1,Worst Chinese I ever ate!The chicken cashew was made out of processed chicken that was chewier then gum. Awful!The veggie noodles were tasteless.Don't understand the ones who give this place good ratings. They probably never tasted real Chinese food.
2015-02-19,2,I ordered take out from Precious and I would sadly say that that was my first and last time.  I was not pleased with the portion size - it was so small!  I had shrimp with broc and the food was good but I just could not get over how small the portion was.  The service was ok - they did forget my wonton soup and they did make a point to come back and deliver it.  Overall, not pleased.
2015-02-19,5,Great Chinese (delivery)  food! My favorite delivery place - great food , fast delivery and everything is always hot and fresh . Actually, I have never had a bad experience so I will keep ordering !!
2015-02-09,4,One of my favorite spots in Hoboken, for dining in or delivery. First, they're BYOB, so ordering lots of delicious food while getting drunk on a budget is definitely the move here. Nothing fancy about the ambience/music/lighting, although it is dim. Not an impressive date spot but I've done it anyway. In warm weather months, it's awesome sitting outside and people watching the streets of Hoboken.Dishes to try: sesame chicken and shrimp, chicken and shrimp stir fry, pork lo mein, shrimp toast, any of the fried rice.  Was not impressed by their curry dishes. Their sushi is also good.
2015-02-04,3,This is a decent spot to get Chinese food in Hoboken.  Nothing spectacular, does not disappoint but does leave any lasting impression.I ordered the General Tso Chicken and the Mooshu Beef.  It was pretty average.  My one critique would be the breading on the chicken was just too much, it was about 60% breading and 40% chicken.  Not what I was expecting when ordering a chicken dish.  Delivery was timely, and the person who took our order was pleasant.
2015-02-02,5,This is the best Chinese I have ever had- whether it's dine in or take out it does not disappoint. Huge step above your standard Chinese food. Favorites are- wonton soup, general tsos, chicken and asparagus and chow fun with chicken and vegetables!
2015-02-02,3,This place used to have the best Chinese food in town but it has gone downhill.  It is just so-so now!
2015-01-03,4,Its good and it does the job when I am craving Chinese food. However I did notice that it is overly salty. But hey I guess that's what Americans like.....
2015-01-02,3,This restaurant was okay we ordered the famous generals chicken and it was overcooked very dry hard to cut with a knife. We ordered the pad that I was which was really great however the lo mein was absolutely amazing. Tthat was the only dish that we were able to finish. We also ordered the vegetable delayed which was really nice the vegetables are cooked really well the greatest part about the dish was there sauce. This is a BYOB place so make sure you bring your nice bottle of wine or beer. The waitstaff is very slow and hard to understand. They take a really long time. We try to ask about certain dishes and what's in them and they were not knowledgeable in their own dishes.Overall after complaining about our chicken dish they took it off of our bill however I would not get that again. I would be very skeptical to order another meat dish at this restaurant again. However I might just go back to have the lo mein again.
2015-01-02,4,Recently moved to Hoboken and have been looking for a decent go-to for Chinese.  Precious has been our favorite so far!Our usuals - sesame chicken and beef with broccoli were both good, especially the beef with broccoli.  Delivery was pretty quick, and the food is consistently good.
2014-12-16,5,I have been ordering food from this restaurant for over 10 years. They have a great selection and their delivery service is always on time. Their staff is very organized and friendly. They offer a great selection of both Chinese Food and Sushi.  It is always fresh and hot when it arrives to my home.
2014-11-30,4,My favorite Chinese food in Hoboken. Favorites: -Sauteed String Beans (comes with lots of garlic!) The string beans are sauteed in garlic and oil or butter. They usually are cooked pretty well almost to the point where they get soft. But they are delicious for an appetizer to share (they come with rice on the side).-Hunan Chicken is a mildly spicy dish with a brown sauce, broccoli, the mini corns, and green peppers. I recommend it! -Chicken and Rice Soup is pretty good with slices of chicken, a bunch of rice, chicken broth and a few scallions. It's great for a cold night!Not So Favorite: Wonton Soup. I love Wonton soup and theirs is a little different; not the traditional wonton soup and something about it I don't like. Plus the wontons fall apart very easily. Other than this I like everything I've ordered so far.The Chinese food is good. But for Hoboken it's probably the best option.
2014-11-24,4,This is the best Chinese food I've had in Hoboken. Delivery is quick, friendly and the food is always consistent. I'm a pretty habitual Chinese food ordered so I can only speak to a few of the items including the won ton soup (good), pork dumplings (good), chicken with broccoli (very good) and the vegetable mei fun (very good).While it's not the best Chinese food in the world, it's def great in a pinch, and better than anything else around.
2014-11-13,5,Tried this place for the first time this week and the food was delicious.  There were 4 in my party so we shared different dishes and everything was superb, especially the Wonton Soup which is the best I have ever had. Extremely kid friendly and on that note,  I want to personally thank you for being so sweet and attentive to Gabriella and Victoria who is only 2. When I visit my niece Anna in Hoboken and I ask Victoria what she wants to eat, she always says Precious Chinese, and now I know why!!!!!  Looking forward to my next visit and thank you for a great experience!!!!!
2014-11-10,4,Everything I've ever ordered has tasted great. Friendly and quick service makes me want to come back. Inexpensive lunch specials especially for Hoboken. Slight substitutions allowed.
2014-11-06,4,Great lunch special! I ordered the eggplant with garlic sauce lunch special and it came with rice and soup for $6. I also ordered the green salad to try it. I really liked everything. I got the hot and sour soup and the vegetable fried rice with the special and both were delicious. The eggplant was awesome too. Sometimes Chinese places don't cook the eggplant enough but this was cooked perfectly and I loved the sauce.
2014-10-27,2,The avocado salad was literally a pile of lettuce and pieces of avocado. Most unimpressive salad ever. Restaurant was cold and my little fingers were sad.The onions in the pineapple fried rice were the size of half an onion! How did they expect me to eat that? My mouth is only the size of a quarter of an onion!
2014-10-26,4,We order from Precious regularly. The pork fried rice is very good, as are the egg rolls, wonton soup and peanut chicken. I've even tried the sushi, which is also very good. It's probably the best place to eat American-Chinese (Asian?) in Hoboken.I noticed some other reviewers said the kitchen can be inconsistent. This is true. A couple times we ordered and my favorite dishes were off. Not sure what's going on in the kitchen, but they should fix that. They also have BYOB if you eat in.
2014-10-24,4,Absolutely my favorite Seamless restaurant in Hoboken.  They have regular delivery staples like Chicken w/ Broccoli but also some pretty authentic dishes like crispy salt and pepper shrimp + squid.  Portions are generous and you definitely get your money worth! I love the variety they offer and have yet to have a disappointing delivery.  The only issue that I have is their long delivery times - but at least they mark it accurately on Seamless!!!
2014-10-15,5,Solid, solid Chinese food. The chicken/broccoli with garlic sauce is out of this world, and they make a mean lo mien. They get your food ready quick and it's always excellent. I will be a loyal customer as long as I'm in Hoboken!
2014-10-13,4,i work in hoboken and tend to order dinner out frequently and im always looking for good chinese, i tried several ones before trying out precious, and let me tell you this is by far the best chinese ive had in a while. The restaurant its self is always clean and the staff is awesome, even the delivery drivers! delivery always no more than 30 minutes after i order. Their sesame chicken is great and also their fried rice, might pay a little more than other local chinese spots, but its well worth it.
2014-10-09,4,On the brink of greatness!I implore you to try both the wonton and the sesame chicken, probably the best ive ever had hands down...Although, this restaurant can be slightly inconsistent, I repeat slightly, it is not a hit or miss type of place.Let me give you some background, the food is top notch when the kitchenis on, and good when the kitchen is off.  The wonton soup has a perfect balance of savory and salty, the addition of basil to the soup is unconventional yet adds an amazing edge to the dish.  The sesame chicken is all white, all quality chicken, and it is done right, almost every time.  The service is really good, averaging 40-45 mins for delivery but it normally gets here faster.  I like that you get to choose between white and brown rice.  As well as, I pike that they have quality Japanese options, like sushi.  Their pupu platter is really good as well as their dumplings.  However, there a things I would NOT order here, like the pepper steak I just ordered.  I normally love sweet & sour chicken but their breading is bland but their sauce is delicious.Lastly, their lunch area is top notch and you have even more comb options then at dinner.  Bang for your buck is fantastic as a local lunch option!
2014-10-08,2,Not a bad place if you like "American" style Chinese food.  If you're expecting authentic Chinese cuisine, look elsewhere.
2014-10-08,4,I have been coming to Precious for about 10 or so years. I am usually never dissapointed. I like to get the white meat General Tso's Chicken. So yummy! I think mostly can beat their take out lunch specials. You get a soup, with a pretty large entree. The presentation is great mostly. Love their chicken wings too. Overall will come back as long as they're food stays yummy!
2014-10-02,4,My favorite Chinese food in Hoboken.  I call to place an order and it's ready in 15 minutes or less. The Hunan Chicken (spicy) is a great choice and like most Chinese food places it comes with a lot of food.Definitely try the string beans - they're sauteed with garlic and for a side dish it's a huge portion. Plenty to share.
2014-08-31,5,Always like their food & service.  Recently got undercooked fried chicken - mistakes happen - and they quickly replaced it.
2014-07-24,5,I am born and raised in Hoboken....tried it all. Precious is by far the best Chinese restaurant food hands down. I love their steamed pork dumplings and wild garlic shrimp. Food is very fresh...veggies still have their bite. To others complaining about a hair on your food....yes its gross. But raging about it and shouting at other customers to warm them and storming out is not called for. I can't count the times I've ordered. Please remember everyone is human and amongst thousands of orders over time their can be a mishap. Precious is a great Chinese restaurant :) oh and I find it so funny how the delivery guys always run away after giving you your order. Lol must be very busy
2014-07-18,4,Very cute Asian fusion restaurant in Hoboken.  The staff is very nice and attentive.  We tried the calamari and it was very yummy.  We also tried the beef and peppers which was good except the onions were not cooked down fully.  We did really enjoy the garlic chicken though.  They have a huge menu so I'm sure they have lots of other good options too. We will be back.
2014-07-02,1,This is quite  possibly  the worst Chinese food I ever had.  In fact I don't usually  write reviews but I joined this site just to write it.  Soggy meat vegetables are not fresh.  The sauces are tastles except for the overreaching hot Ness.  Eat here only if u have no option.  Coming from Manhattan  I don't hope Hoboken  had better food guess I was wrong
2014-06-15,1,I really don't understand how this place has so many positive reviews. It's really bland and bad Chinese food. The spare ribs were so dry that we wound up getting our own sauce. The wonton soup had no flavor and we added our own seasoning. It goes on and on. I've ordered take out from there a number of times, so it's not just a single instance. Istana sushi and wok is much better. If you're ordering check them out.
2014-06-10,4,I got delivery from here last night. The service was quick and the food was piping hot. When you order Chinese from a place like Precious that is pretty much all you can ask for.The general tsos chicken was good and the crab rangoons were good but nothing excellent or even great. If you are in the mood for solid Chinese food that will arrive quickly and be hot then this is your place.
2014-06-10,3,Been there couple of times. First time sit-down was good. Second time take-out was bad. The Pineapple chicken fired rice was weird. The chicken was too greasy and uncooked. We had to throw it away. The Singapore noodles were good. Dumplings were good too. I wonder why there are no good reliable Chinese restaurants in Hoboken.
2014-05-18,4,The food from Precious is probably the best Chinese food I've had, outside of Chinatown. The pork dumplings are amazing and so is the meat selection. The sushi is pretty good but it needs a little more flavor. They deliver very fast, even if you're on the opposite side of town. The interior of the restaurant seems an authentic Chinese interior, but I think it would benefit very much from a remodel. Overall great place!
2014-05-12,4,Food was great, i ordered the shrimp with Garlic sauce, it was very tasty, and full of flavor, the delivery was super fast, I've never seen anything that quick, it was like Asian Magic or something.
2014-05-09,4,I've been ordering vegetarian selections about twice a month from Precious for years and rarely have I been disappointed.  The dishes tend to be oily, so be sure to ask for light oil if that is an issue (it is for me) because they will prepare the dishes with less oil if asked.  My favorite is the vegetarian black pepper "steak" with peppers and onions.  Delicious.  One order is enough for two meals, especially with the huge order of rice (white or brown) that comes with it.  I don't know if it's just me, but no matter how many times I ask, I hardly ever seem to get duck sauce with my order.  That's why it's 4 stars and not 5.  I know they have it, it just never ends up in my bag.I live in JC Heights, and the usual delivery time is 30 to 40 minutes, which it what it takes for  local places to deliver, so I consider that quick. My food is always still nice and hot when it gets here.I've only ever had delivery so I can't comment on the staff in the restaurant, but the order taker on the phone is is swift and polite.  Never messes up an order.  Delivery people are very nice.
2014-05-03,3,there's no good chinese in Hoboken. if you're going for sesame chicken and the basics I would pick this place. their wonton soup is good too. as they give a huge portion of salmon if you go for that. it's good too. decent take out.
2014-04-18,1,Horrible service we got on a weekday! This place is so not kid friendly. We were 4 kids and two moms and got terrible service and attitude at this place. Never again and I taking my family there or ordering for delivery. This place does not know how to treat Hoboken families!
2014-04-11,3,This is not a bad choice for Chinese but the service really needs some adjustments. It makes you wonder if they want you there.
2014-04-03,2,I honestly don't know how this place is one of the higher rated Chinese places in Hoboken. I have one word for the food - BLAND. I got the sweet and sour chicken and it didn't taste like there was any seasoning on it at all. Even dunking an entire piece in the sauce did not make up for the lack of taste. The vegetables and fruit that comes with it (which included maraschino cherries??) were also not seasoned and seemed like they were chopped and heated up for 30 seconds. We also got the pork fried rice which was a little better, but still I thought it lacked the usual flavor. The only reason I didn't give them 1 star is because the delivery was fast and my boyfriend seemed to enjoy the sesame chicken. Maybe I have to try other things on the menu, but for big ticket items I would expect better.
2014-04-02,4,If I want to here I like to order pick-up from here since they are not on delivery.com and seamless has them with a min of $20 plus a delivery fee. Love their wonton soup, also a fan of their crispy sesame chicken lunch special. Def worth ordering food here for lunch and their staff are very friendly! They don't give you their menu unless you take it from their podium, so make sure to grab one on your way out during pick-up or request for one when they delivery you food!
2014-03-07,5,This place is always top notch. Food is good from top to bottom . Sesame chicken to ribs, sushi or dumplings. Just awesome . It's a small quaint Hoboken place . It has become a staple for the best Chinese food in town.
2014-02-13,5,Great experience. They delivered to Hamilton Park, JC in a snowstorm.  Amazing dishes for vegetarians and non-meat eaters! Highly recommended.  The vegetarian dumplings are hands down amazing.
2014-02-13,5,Best chinese food in Hoboken. Many vegetarian dishes. The food is very fresh and the delivery is fast.
2014-01-09,4,This is the right way to go if you're desiring Chinese in the Hoboken area. If you decide to sit, they have a plethora of seating between what is available outside and indoors. The staff is pretty friendly though they leave you alone for the most part, be prepared to grab their attention if required.It's a tad bit more expensive than what you normally barter for Chinese -- but the taste is right and it's prepared well. Portions are large and tasty. Hope you're ready to eat!I've mostly ordered delivery from here while I was living in Hoboken - they're very hasty in their preparation and quick to the chase. I lived about 7 blocks from the establishment and often found my food within 20 minutes at my door - super awesome.
2014-01-07,5,This is a short review but I feel they deserved it on the one dish i tried.Ordered the young chow fried rice for lunch - delivered to work.  Expected typical take out fried rice, received a mind blowing dish of the heavens.  Roast pork was succulent, chicken was flavorful, onions had a perfect crunch, and the shrimp were deveined, clean, and juicy.  This place has sold me on its young chow fried rice alone.  Best I've ever had - and I've eaten everything and everywhere in Chinatown, Flushing, Infinity, and Beyond.  Brought some home to g/f - she agreed.Portion was huge and price was on point.I am excited to go back and try their other food - will update the review if anything changes, but I doubt any place making god-caliber young chow fried rice can do anything else poorly.Worth it to note - if you're especially sensitive to salt or oil, probably not the dish for you.  This review is from a salt and oil lover's perspective.
2014-01-05,5,This is the best Chinese food I've had in the Hoboken/Jersey City area! I'm a big fan of their flavorful chicken fried rice, lomein, cheese rangoons, egg rolls and wanton soup! The food is delicious and cooked just right, without being over-fried like in some other places. I always order take-out and have not dined in yet, but it is a cute restaurant on the inside. It's BYOB and there's a liquor store conveniently next-door to it so the location is perfect. The staff seems friendly and from what I saw at the sushi bar, they make good-looking rolls. I'll have to try those out sometime! They have great lunch specials; their dinner prices are a bit on the higher end but it's worth it. I highly recommend this joint if you are in the mood for authentic Chinese food.
2013-12-14,4,I noticed on Yelp this had better reviews than most Chinese food places in Hoboken. Cute and spacious inside. They have their lunch specials from 11 a.m to 4 p.m. I was craving shrimp broccoli even though I knew I was risking just getting 4 shrimps. But I can't complain the order comes with the  choice of soup or egg roll. My friend ordered General Tso's white Chicken but I made sure I had some of it. I'm selfish. It was delicious! The portion she received was much bigger than my broccoli to shrimp ratio. Our waiter was nice but I felt like he wanted us to rush and he stayed a little too close to our table for my liking.
2013-12-07,4,Ordered for the first time tonight. Have to say I am usually hesitant to order from a new Chinese restaurant, but they far exceeded my expectations. Used to order from Aroma, but since they closed was forced to try a new place and I'm glad I did! Delivery was extremely fast and the food was excellent...very fresh and tasty!I didn't get my fortune cookie, but that's okay, I'll let it go this time.Will definitely be making this my go-to Chinese in Hoboken.
2013-11-19,5,Delivery was super fast! When they say 15 minutes, they really mean 5 :) I love the delivery guys, they're so nice. My favorite would be the General Tso's tofu, veggie/shrimp lo mein (any of their lo mein in fact!), shrimp rolls, and their wonton soup is great. Thin dough, and they also throw in plenty of scallions and spinach.The price is reasonable, and they give you a lot of food. I have eaten in here once, and it's BYOB, which is enough to earn a whole star!
2013-11-08,5,These guys really do delivery well.  Special requests are usually taken care of, the food is great, and the delivery arrives super quick.  Plus they have great Chinese AND Japanese. I order from here at least once a week.Just a heads up-they don't have combo orders for their Chinese food, so it's sometimes a bit pricier for a meal. Don't assume something comes with rice or soup.
2013-10-31,5,I order from Precious probably 1x or 2x a week. The lunch special is the best deal in town and they are generous with the portions. Also, they let me substitute tofu (either fried or soft) in the dishes without an extra charge (for example the chicken w/ cashew nuts or chicken with hot peppers and peanuts) and brown rice is also no extra charge. I don't know if their duck sauce is homemade or not but its awesome - doesn't come in those lil packets but in a cup (it must be homemade right?). Unfortunately that means I have to get a not so healthy egg roll but so be it. The wonton soup is awesome (albeit a lil too salty sometimes!), the flavor of the food itself is better than most Chinese places I frequented on the island and in Brooklyn - that is for standard Americanized Chinese take-out/fare. One thing that I was just MEH about was the hot and sour soup. Its gotta have MUSHROOMS!!!! please.
2013-10-30,3,If you're in the mood for decent Asian cuisine, Precious is a pretty solid choice. It seems really catered to the American palate, which calls for heavy, sweet, and salty kinds of flavors. You won't find the interesting or unpredictable ingredients/preparations that you get in more authentic places, but I've never been disappointed here.
2013-10-21,3,I'm always weary of Chinese places that include Japanese into their menus, but my sushi cravings kicked in. Surprisingly fresh sushi - I ordered the spicy making combo which had three different kinds of spicy rolls (tuna, salmon and yellowtail), and all three were decent.
2013-09-14,5,The best vegetarian Chinese food options in hoboken by a landslide.Also, they're very nice.
2013-08-15,3,This review is for their delivery only. (Which is quick!)This is the type of food that brings shame to my ancestors and would have them rolling over in their graves. But sometimes I just crave some greasy ass food that is Americanized but yet considered food from the motherland (which it definitely is not). The food is not even remotely good. I normally order beef chow fun, Singapore mei fun, chicken lo mein, dumplings. All super greasy and the dumplings are usually soggy. I know when that craving hits, this is the spot I'll be ordering from cause I can always count on their food and flavor to be consistent.Btw, this food is never ever good overnight so if you don't eat it all, I recommend throwing it out.
2013-07-29,4,Best Chinese food in Hoboken, albeit a bit Americanized.  Maybe they have a more authentic menu if you ask?Really quick delivery.  Their delivery guys are constantly in our building as they are clearly a favorite.Oh and definite thumbs up for taking a complaint about one of the delivery guys seriously.
2013-06-15,5,This place is great.  My wife and I go here all the time; they have great sushi, and their Chinese is also very good.  One night when we were there, we were waiting a bit longer than normal for our soup to come out.  Our waiter came out and gave us some edamame on the house, apologizing for the long wait; my wife and I hadn't even mentioned anything about it in the first place!  This experience puts them over the top for me.
2013-05-21,4,One of the freshest Chinese Spots in JC and Hoboken.. never a bad meal here... love it!  Very Consistent.
2013-05-02,3,Food is decent enough to go more than once.  Space is pretty good.  Service sucks, is rude, and charges extra for little changes.
2013-04-21,4,For me, this is the best Chinese place in Hoboken.  I've eaten in a few times and gotten takeout many times, and I can say it's been consistently good.  The menu (at least the part I've sampled) is typical Americanized Chinese food, so if you're looking for something really authentic, you'll have to head across the Hudson.  For what this is, though, it's good.The fried pork dumplings here are some of the best I've had outside of NY or SF Chinatown - crispy, chewy skins wrapped around generously-sized and very tasty interiors.  I get them just about every time I order.The sliced chicken soup with noodles is a true bargain:  $6.50 for a portion large enough to make two meals (well, maybe two lunches).  As the name implies, the chicken breast is sliced thin, and after simmering in the pleasingly salty broth, it becomes so moist and delicious.  I wish more chicken soups used chicken prepped this way.  For entrees, the sesame chicken, moo shu pork and wild garlic shrimp are all winners.  The broccoli in garlic sauce is good enough that you'll forget you're eating healthy veggies.I haven't ordered the sushi here, so can't comment on that (I'm always a little skeptical of sushi from Chinese/Japanese/whatever else places.  Since rice is usually unseasoned in Chinese cooking, the probably-Chinese sushi chefs sometimes have a tendency to underseason the sushi rice, leaving you with sushi that's bland).Delivery is usually fast (max 30 mins, often more like 15, even to uptown).I could go on, but I think you get the point.  For the best Chinese in Hoboken, look no further.
2013-03-02,4,Excellent all around - pork dumplings, general tso, beef and broccoli, pork lo mein, beef fries rice.  Highlights were beef and lo mein.
2013-01-22,4,Its just really really good, and really really fresh Chinese food.  I have not had the Sushi, but again the Chinese food is really really good, and really really fresh.  BYOB!  If you bring your leftovers home with you, be prepared to have your fridge smell like butt wind...
2013-01-17,4,Great spot for Chinese food. I used to do lunch with friends on hangover day (i.e. Sunday) when I used to do the bar thing. They always accommodated us with a big pitcher of water and lots of good food. Their Amazing Chicken is great and everything else is a step above what you'd expect from a take-out place. As a sit-down place, it's a very casual atmosphere - great for lunch or a casual dinner. As a delivery place, these guys must cook the food on the way because they seem to be able to deliver within 10 minutes to anywhere in Hoboken on most nights. Granted, I live across the street now, but have gotten deliveries at 4th & Park and 9th & Willow previously. The only real complaints I have are that they water down their duck sauce and you have to ask for chopsticks and napkins when ordering for delivery if you want them. Their pricing is very reasonable. The staff is generally very nice (except that one time when one of the girls got upset because I couldn't understand her on the phone, but I forgive her). I probably eat Precious once a week and find it to be a staple in my on-the-run diet.
2013-01-11,3,I love takeout chinese food.  having moved around for a couple years, I've had the fortune of finding a couple great spots for it.  this is not one, but it is also not terrible.  I'd say if you have reasonable expectations, this is your jam.  if you're expecting greatness, search on.
2013-01-11,3,My go-to place in Hoboken for Chinese food.  Portions are generous and the price tag is small.  Good service.  No frills, but who needs frills anyway?
2013-01-02,3,Downgrade!This is entering my 'list of shame' for charging a dollar for spicy mayo - come on guys seriously? I eat it or order from here once a week and yet, still hit with the outrageous charge... yes its a dollar but you're getting 5 cents in product!
2012-12-16,1,DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU HAVE A NUT ALLERGY!We requested NO NUTS in our meal because one member of our family is deathly allergic.  If they were unable to accommodate the request, Precious should have said so - no big deal, we would have just ordered from another restaurant.  However, they said yes, yes, it's ok... so we placed our take-out order only for my husband to find several peanuts in his entree.  Thankfully he is not the one allergic and is the one who found them first.  When we called Precious to make them aware of the situation, we received an "I'm sorry... we're just very busy."  Very busy? Is that what they would have been saying if their negligence had killed someone?  Completely unacceptable.
2012-11-03,4,Pretty standard Chinese food.  Best hot and sour soup in Hoboken in my opinion though.
2012-10-13,2,This place is a pretty standard Americanized, "General Tso's", Chinese takeout restaurant. I'll admit that I come here fairly regularly for lunch during the work week, and despite being an ABC who knows what "real" Chinese food, I shamelessly order the General Tso's almost every time. To be honest, the General Tso's here really isn't even as good as a lot of places I've tried it, but it's kind of like the Chinese equivalent of fried chicken ... even when it's bad, it's still kind of good. Everything here is overly greasy and heavy like you would expect. If you go here, I would suggest explicitly telling them "no MSG" on whatever you order. My buddy swears that it's perfectly safe (and we were discussing whether it can even make lettuce taste better), but I'll skip on the additive that alters how my brain interprets flavors.
2012-10-05,5,The first time I tried Precious was when I had my girlfriend's left overs. Even then, I thought it was delicious. I am a big chinese food lover and have had both very good and very bad. I think Precious is one of the best I've ever had. I've had their General Tso's Chicken, rice, egg rolls and Chicken and Broccoli and they've all been great. It is on the pricier side for chinese food, but totally worth it. Delivery time was also incredibly reliable.
2012-09-11,4,This is some good Chinese food.  I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food , but I had a strange craving for some General Tso's.  Called 'em up, put in my order, and no more than 10 minutes later the food was at my doorstep.  Everything I ordered was hot (including the delicious, fresh brown rice), fresh and made to my liking.  I asked for my General Tso's extra spicy, and that's exactly how it was served.  This is without a doubt the best Chinese food in Hoboken and my new Chinese take-out place.  I'm looking forward to trying the sushi.
2012-09-11,1,No way.This is the saltiest Chinese food I've ever had. I thought it was maybe just the dish I ordered, so I was optimistic when I tried it a second time, but that was unbelievably salty too... woke up in the middle of the night for water! I ordered Mei Fun (thin rice noodles, undercooked so they were clumpy and crunchy in some parts. ew), Fried Rice (also crunchy and chewy in some parts), chicken and broccoli (really syrupy sauce, luke warm), egg roll (eww. eww. eww. chewy.)Not fresh. Gross.
2012-09-04,4,I've never had a bad experience here. I've called it in & picked it up on my way from PATH, and I've had it delivered. It's quick & easy either way. They aren't super cheap, but the quality of the food is better than most of the dumps that serve Chinese in NJ & NY.The Singapore Mai Fun is pretty decent, and I would also recommend the Pu Pu Platter -good little assortment of different things, perfect for two people. But I think the General Tso really stands out as a stellar option. You can get chicken, or for a bit more you can get chicken and shrimp. The sauce isn't too sweet, has a bit of kick, and w/ some added Sriracha, is pretty amazeballs.As a sit down place, I can't really comment much, as I haven't sat down to eat here yet... but I will say that I noticed it's BYOB, so then there's that.Recommend & will definitely eat here again.
2012-08-20,1,Weak. Food is very average and the poor attitude makes me never want to come back here again...
2012-06-28,3,Decent little Chinese restaurant with large portion size.  The spare rib tips are excellent and the wonton soup has more flavor than I could describe.  I will definitely return to this place in the future.
2012-06-27,4,I've eaten at the restaurant and ordered delivery from Precious, and have yet to be disappointed.  They have a good variety of Chinese and Japanese dishes.  Portions are large (definitely enough for two meals).  The egg roll definitely has a hint of cinnamon, which is different.  Delivery was fairly quick (we ordered online through Seamless).  Precious may be on its way to my favorite Hoboken Chinese restaurant...
2012-05-24,4,Had dinner here last night.Edamame Beans and Shumai shrimp dumplings delicious!Crispy Beef reallyb tasty enough for four so much Amazing salt and pepper ShrimpBYOB so fab next door to Sparrows couldnt be easier, if fact halfway through the meal went and got another bottle!Will go again
2012-05-21,4,It's pretty rare to find a good sit-down Chinese places these days, so it's great to have Precious in Hoboken. And the fact that they offer sushi as well is a huge plus! I had gotten delivery from here a few times, but this was my first time eating there, and it was a nice experience. We were able to get tuna tartar off the sushi menu, and still get the Chinese food we wanted for dinner. The tartar was mixed with mango and was very tasty, and our entrees were very good. They have a nice selection of healthy dishes, and my lemon chicken was a good portion and very healthy. My boyfriend liked his sesame chicken. All of the food was cooked perfectly and well-presented. BYOB and right next a liquor store helps, too. If you're looking for quality Chinese/sushi, try Precious!
2012-05-14,4,When it comes to Asian Cuisine in Hoboken, this place is at the top of my list.
2012-04-30,3,Meh. Good, greasy, Americanized Chinese take-out.  $20 delivery minimum and expensive but huge dishes make it fall to the bottom my go-to delivery list. $9.50 for a portion of chicken and broccoli is steep but it's pretty tasty. As for other things, I'm not too sure.  With all the Chinese food in Hoboken, I don't know why I have such trouble finding a solid option. Precious would be closer to that title if there were reasonable prices and a reasonable delivery minimum.
2012-04-25,3,Aroma is my usual place, so I'll compare the two here... Mixed bag here... ordered on a Wednesday night, was told 35 minutes, arrived in under 20.Soup - really tasty, thin wontons. Tie.Dumplings - tasty filling, super thin... reminds me more of gyoza than dumpings. Tie (Aroma has tiny dumplings, but also good in a doughier kinda way).Boneless ribs - they are generous with the portions. Tons of meat. Unfortunately, the meat is dry and has zero sauce on it. Aroma wins.Egg Roll - lots of tasty pork. Prescious wins.Pork Fried Rice - pretty good. tender pork, and no peas. Actually probably the best PRF I've had in Hoboken to date. Precious wins.Pork Lo Mein - noodles taste overcooked to me. Would not order this from here again. Aroma wins.General Tso's Chicken - super crispy, and super doughy.In fact mostly dough and very little chicken. Would not order this from here again. Aroma wins by a nose. Overall, the food here is good, but still does not win in my search for 100% reliable Hoboken Chinese food. Probably will stick with Aroma until I find something better.
2012-03-05,3,If Precious is the best Chinese in town, I will be sad.  Very, very sad.  Since it was my first time trying this spot, I figured I wouldn't be adventerous and would order my Chinese food staples.Vegetable Lo Mein:  No complaints here.  The only negative I have is that the large pieces of broccoli in it made it awkward to eat. Sesame Chicken:  The fried chicken chunks are mostly batter, making for an arousing game of hide and seek while you search to find the actual pieces of chicken.  Its coated in an orangey, gooey sesame sauce that looks like its out of a squeeze bottle and imparts little more than a sugary taste to the dish.  None of the food is necessarily bad, I've just had better.
2012-02-29,1,Luved this place...BUT of course a few bites in I found what appeared to be someones NASTY PUBIC HAIR on my steamed dumplings...I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO DISGUSTED...I stormed back to this place on my lunch break demanded my money back and told them " i should take this food an shove it down someones throat an see how you like eating pubic hair!!!" I got my refund, and before i walked out i turn around an said "attention everyone please check your food because mine just gad hair in it, Thank You and goodnight!!" NEVER AGAIN.
2012-02-07,5,I think this is probably one of the best Chinese / Japanese restaurants in the area.  They have two menus for each one.  I have only had the Chinese food here and everything I have had was delicious.  The wonton soup was nothing but light and not greasy.  The Cantonese noodles in the Precious Delight are so good.  You get a lot of food.  The fried dumplings are not greasy and the dumpling itself is crispy and golden.  The prawn and cashews are loaded with shrimp with a low sodium glaze.  Service is top notch.
2012-01-25,4,The reviews are right - probably the best, and maybe the only good Asian restaurant in Hoboken.Food is fresh, real (no crispy fried chicken bits substituting for orange Chicken here) tastes delicious and doesn't make you want to hurl afterwards or feel bloated for 4 days.  The Protein Trio which is supposed to consist of no oil, etc is amazing and probably one of their best dishes on the menu-  it's enormous, has chicken, shrimp, AND scallops, is loaded with veggies but is on the spicier side.  I usually get it with hunan sauce instead of their spicy sauce.   Also have had their chicken with broccoli, sweet & sour and wonton soups, dumplings, lo mein and general tsao's chicken.  least favorite was general tsao's.  Service and delivery is so-so.  NBD though; I'd rather wait a bit more for well cooked food anyway.  Carry-out is fast and prices are reasonable.  BYOB, and not too shabby of a decor, although the food is the standout not the ambiance.  Def. not for a first time date but perfect for dinner with the boo.   Did I mention it's BYOB?
2012-01-24,3,As far as Chinese delivery goes, this place is not too bad. The singapore mei fun is good, the beef, shrimp, or chicken with broccoli or mixed vegetables is good, but the fried rice dishes are just OK. There are better places in downtown Jersey City but this is actually the best I've found in the Hoboken area. Aroma & Cottage can't hold a candle to this place. I did once get a tiny fly in my wanton soup but I'm not taking any stars off for that because it only happened once  & I've eaten here many times, so it was just bad luck for me that day. The waiters are also rather attentive.
2012-01-20,3,Living in Hoboken, Precious is almost the only Chinese restaurant I go whenever I crave for Chinese food. The food is good, comparing to the neighboring Chinese restaurants, but it is NOT great. Being someone who has tried almost all Chinese restaurants in the tri-state area, I can say that Precious is over-priced, especially after their price-hike last year. If you are in the Hoboken neighborhood, feeling like Chinese food, and don't care about the extra $3-4 per dish (compared to the comparable dishes in other same level Chinese restaurant), Precious is the place to go. I would go there much more often if their price can be justified.
2012-01-11,3,Great prices and amazing location since its so close to path and liquor store. Probably the best hot and sour soup I've had ( dine in only). I've enjoyed everything except the sushi, but even the sushi was good portion and fair price
2012-01-01,4,The food is alright, the portions are big and the delivery is fast.
2011-12-18,5,This is by far my favorite Chinese food place in Hoboken. Their food is delicious, the staff is nice and it isn't terribly expensive (relatively speaking).Whenever I call the food is ready in 10-15 minutes tops. The one thing I don't like is they have a $15 minimum for credit cards, but that is only annoying on the rare occasion I order less than $15 worth. I recommend the Chicken Lo Mein, which has an excellent flavor and is not too dry like at some places. The sesame chicken is always crispy and the sauce has a great flavor. This is the only place I go to anymore in Hoboken!
2011-12-17,5,Precious is my favorite Chinese and Japanese restaurant in town.  I love their sushi!  It is always fresh and they will make your rolls with brown rice which is great.  Their lo mein is awesome (I normally ask for light oil).  I love their steamed chicken dishes too and no oil dishes.  I will gladly go there anytime people want to go out in Hoboken.  It is also my go to delivery place too.
2011-12-16,5,This is the best chinese place in the area by far. This statement is made through empirical observation and analysis. Thorough analysis. Having tried all the other places, several times (yes, Im aware of the image of myself you've probably created in your head), I will forever order from here and only here. While the other places are good, this has the best sauces, flavors, quality and service. Emphasis on the service. Sweetest sweetest delivery man--he will make your day :)
2011-12-05,1,Sushi was horrible,  my g/f won't eat sushi anymore because of this place! my life is ruined.
2011-11-16,2,Been going here for a few years, having worked here in Hoboken for moer than 12 years. Ate here four times this month. I like their wontons.Went in tonight, place was empty on a rainy Wednesday night, i.e. NOT busy. I ordered a bowl of wonton soup and the waiter told me that there is an $8 minimum for the table. I told him I would pay cash, thinking it was a credit card minimum. He insisted I had to order $8 or more to sit at the table. I got up and left. They just lost a long-time customer over a $1.50 or so difference. I could see if the place was packed and tables were scarce. I literally was the only person in the restuarant.It's stupid "blanket" policies like this that have negative effects on any type of business. I'm not going back--Chinese places like this are a "dime a dozen" in Hoboken.
2011-11-07,5,I came here in a group of 6 people, and they catered to everyone's tastes! The wonton soups and egg rolls were fresh and delicious. I had the Chicken Tempura roll, which was flavorful and crunchy, and the Philadelphia roll. I also tried the chicken pad thai, the mango shrimp, and beef with broccoli, all spectacular and not greasy. A definite go to place with friends in a relaxing yet fun atmosphere!
2011-10-02,4,My boyfriend  took me here for Valentines Day, and we had a very pleasant experience. The staff waited on us very quickly, the food was moderately priced, and was cooked to perfection. A meal for one could easily feed two, so portioning definitely reflected pricing. The tables were a bit too close for comfort. On crowded days you can't help but be involved in your neighboring tables business. You practically sit on top of each other. On sunny days, you have the option to sit outside which is my favorite thing to do b/c the Washington St atmosphere is always a good time.
2011-09-13,1,Yuck. Beef was saturated in bland brown sauce, diced chicken tasted old, vegetables were soggy, fried rice was not good. If this is the highest rated Chinese in Hoboken, I'll be getting my take-out in NYC from now on.
2011-08-21,5,This Chinese place is Precious.  I haven't had their Japanese fare, but I can tell you their Chinese is delicious and affordable.  My boyfriend and I have dumplings as an appetizer, a large soup, and an entree and are stuffed at $24 including tip.  Plus, it's BYOB, which helps keep the tab down for the alcohol inclined.  I definitely recommend the dumplings and the hot and sour soup.
2011-08-20,4,I enjoyed the mango chicken that I had a few days ago for lunch very much and the sesame chicken is also very good. I would order them again. I've also ordered the beef & broccoli from there and the only thing that I didn't like was that the broccoli was too small. It tasted good though so no biggie. My boss enjoyed the garlic shrimp from there and she likes the way that they make the white rice which is not too hard. The staff is very friendly there and I got to practice my Chinese while I was waiting for my order. I've only ordered take out from there which was quick to order. About ten minutes. They also serve Japanese food there and I have yet to try it. But I will soon. So far I enjoy this place so I'll give it a four star. I think it's a bit better then a few other Chinese food places in Hoboken for sure.
2011-08-15,4,every time I come here I must order satay bee noodle soup. such a hearty meal. it's not genuine Chinese dish neither Thai or any other south Asian style... but beef is tender and good portion! service is always great here~
2011-06-29,4,I've lived in Hoboken for a year now and this is still my go-to Chinese and Japanese place. First of all the steamed pork dumplings are just super flavorful. No matter what else I'm ordering I will usually get an order of these. The sushi is really great, high quality. I dont think I've ever had a piece of sashimi or sushi roll that I've regretted here. We usually order delivery and it still arrives very fresh and delicious.Some of the chinese options are a little on the greasy side, but for the most part they are solid. Some favorites of mine are the tofu schezuan style, chicken and broccoli, and moo shu.But no matter what, get the steamed pork dumplings!
2011-06-21,3,As much as I am not ok with a chinese restaurant that also serves sushi, this wasn't half bad. The food was enjoyable the setting was nice. The service has something to be hoped for but overall nice dinner in Hoboken for all involved.
2011-06-16,3,As far as Hoboken bets, this is better than most. The prices are fairly reasonable and some of the dishes are really flavorful. The wonton soup had delicate homemade dumplings and pork fried rice was smoky and had plenty of meat. The chicken with broccoli and egg rolls (the had some spice, maybe cinnamon?) left something to be desired.  The service was quick and attentive and the atnosphere was clean and hip. I will return.
2011-06-06,3,Precious is a really good Chinese restaurant. In Hoboken, it can be overwhelming to choose from the array of establishments. Everything always tastes fresh here. While the wonton soup is not one of my favorites; it's quite salty, and their lo mein is a bit mushy, don't miss their chicken and broccoli, steamed sesame dumplings, chicken chow mein or general tso's chicken. It's also a decent place to eat, both inside and outside and their delivery service is usually pretty timely.
2011-06-03,4,We ordered sushi (and sashimi for me!) from here via seamlessweb the night we moved into our apartment. The delivery was very quick (despite our street being blocked by fire trucks.)I had the sashimi dinner, and roomie had gyoza, a tuna roll and another roll I can't remember. My sashimi came with soup and a salad. The miso soup was SO GOOD...super salty, but that's how I like it. They also give you an enormous container of it...which I couldn't finish. The sashimi was your standard assortment of salmon, tuna, white tuna, yellowtail and fluke. They give you 18 pieces of perfectly sized fish, so it's definitely worth it. I think the total with tip for the both of us was about $40, definitely a great price for good sushi. We'll order again for sure :)
2011-06-02,4,Considering they're a Chinese restaurant, they are hands down the best bang-for-the-buck for sushi/sashimi in the area; Jersey City included!  I work in the Newport area, and my friends and I have been ordering from this place at least once a week for more than a year--not once have they disappointed.  Their fish is always fresh, period.  If they were allowed to sell through their sister restaurant near work, they would cause grief to the two others serving Japanese . . . no doubt!!
2011-04-10,4,By far and away the best Chinese food I have had in Hoboken. The delivery is extremely fast and they give you tea packets! Great lunch specials. Love the hot and sour soup.
2011-02-13,4,FINALLY, decent Chinese in Hoboken. We had given up on ordering Chinese from anywhere in this town, but we had a hankering for general tso's and decided to give this place a shot. Good thing we did. Delivery was fast, prices were cheap, and food was really good. I highly recommend their Thai curry chicken as well. Looking forward to trying their sushi next time.
2011-02-08,2,There is a dearth of good Chinese food in Hoboken. For that matter, aside from NYC you have to search far and wide to find good Chinese.I've tried a fair number of dishes at Precious and they're mostly unspectacular to average. *Fried pork dumplings - doughy*Hot & Sour soup - eh*Lo mein - fairly good*Volcano Roll (shrimp tempura, avocado, topped w/ spicy tuna) - not even close to as tasty as Robongi or other good sushi spots*BBQ Ribs Noodle Soup - see attached picture.....the meat was all bone and gristleYes, if you are sitting on your couch on a cold winter's Sunday evening, you are totally screwed if you want good Chinese in Hoboken. NB - If you can drive to JC to pick up from Grand Sichuan do that and get #11 Soup Dumplings and #64 Braised Sliced Beef with Chili Sauce
2011-01-28,4,'twas a father-daughter lunch date on a saturday afternoon after a rousing trip to home depot... i was famished! i've been here before, will absolutely come again. the food tastes delicious, there is no doubt about that. very flavorful, one of my favorite asian fusion restaurants in hoboken. the lunch special come with soup (or eggroll) + choice of rice, which is clutch because other places upcharge you for brown rice. service could be better, especially since it's a small place with only about a dozen or so tables and i should not have to ask the waiter for more water, but all in all it's always a very pleasant experience to eat here. two things i do not know about, though: how is their sushi? is it BYO?
2011-01-25,5,One of my Top favorite places to eat thus far in Hoboken! I bring my own bottle of wine and eat DELICIOUS FOOD! chinese and some japanese too! I def recommend!
2011-01-20,4,Quick, tasty and reliable. Particularly good value at lunch time where the lunch special includes soup and a main dish. Best Chinese food in Hoboken. Also do quick and reliable takeout and delivery.
2010-12-23,4,Love Precious!! Tried most Chinese places when I first moved to Hoboken and had terrible food at most. Precious is terrific. Good vegetables in brown sauce, lo mein and fried rice. Dining in has a standard chinese restaurant atmosphere, delivery is quick.
2010-12-19,4,Precious is definitely the best Chinese in Hoboken. Wish I liked their brown sauce a little better, but everything else is really good- fried rice, lo mein, soups, scallion pancakes- all yummy! Fast delivery service, too!
2010-12-03,4,I was very skeptical reading all the good reviews but I was not let down when i received my food. Easily one of the best chinese restaurants  I'v ever ordered from.
2010-12-01,4,Since I am a frequent customer of this place..I can honestly say that not once out of the 50 times I ordered from there have I been dissatisfied with the food..the sushi is fresh and well prepared.. a bit pricey but well worth it..probably one of the best Chinese food I've had ..oh and the delivery is fast
2010-11-07,4,Ahh... My Precious. Long ago when I first arrived in to Hoboken, I tried many different Chinese places, many of which are no longer around. Back then, Precious stood out from the crowd. It has been able to stand the test of time and remained a steadfast establishment on Washington Street. For those that know Hoboken and its changing dynamics, this says a lot. I have been here for lunch, dinner, taken away both, and have had both delivered. Being such a regular guest, I've had plenty of opportunity to catch them off guard. Fortunately they rarely disappoint. The lunch specials are really a great value for lunch in Hoboken. Can't really go wrong with one of those deals. I will mention that the fried rice you get with the lunch special is not the same as the dinner fried rice. So if you ordered it with dinner one night and expected to get the same with the lunch special, it won't be. And of course vice versa if you ordered it with lunch and expected something different at dinner. I know you can order the dinner style at lunch, I don't know about lunch style at dinner but I bet they would. Dinner for two always seems to run me about $25-$30. It is a little more expensive than other places might be, but I feel the value is there on both the quality and portion sizes. Is it the very best? Likely not. Are there some things I just don't like from there? Yes. Are they better than the average place in Hoboken? In my opinion, absolutely.Visiting, I can't say I've ever had a problem with service. Quick, simple, efficient. Taking away has always been quick. Often I can order as soon as I get off the PATH train and my order if not ready by the time I get there, is usually out in the next minute or two. I'm always amazed at the sheer weight of the contents in the bag.Delivery is something else. Now, I do live very close to Precious so I probably have an advantage over others. When I call to get delivery, I estimate that I have about 15 minutes before it arrives at my door. Consistently. It doesn't seem to matter when I call. I can casually get some place settings together, wash up, and my door is ringing. I can't even prep ingredients that fast if I was going to make dinner for myself. Somehow they manage to both cook and deliver it in that time. I love Precious for the simple fact that its great for when you want to eat NOW! I also love the fact that they keep a record of what you order and many times they have finished my order for me. I like that kind of personalization. I am a fan. I have a lot of positive things to say about this place. I will only note one negative experience that I feel is worth mentioning. On a visit 2 years ago I once saw a cockroach walk across a table next to me in the dining room. Now, even the best of places can have their pest issues from time to time, and I'm sincerely hoping that this was an isolated incident that I won't ever see again - and I haven't since. But, I've always got my eye on you my Precious...
2010-09-09,4,Being that myself and my dinner companion were not familiar with Hoboken's restaurants, we spent a good amount of time looking at the menus of many restaurants, a good amount of which happened to be closed, until we noticed that Precious Chinese Cuisine serves some vegetarian chinese food.It was 4th of July so the restaurant was full, it seems like this was not a regular occurrence for the restaurant because it was in some kind of chaos. We had to wait for some time and eventually were seated inside, since all the outside seating was taken.Their menu offers many options, both from Chinese and Japanese cuisines, all of which are reasonably priced. I ordered the Vegetarian Sesame Chicken while my dinner companion ordered the vegetarian General Tso's chicken. Both dishes were very generous in portion, the vegetarian sesame chicken was a bit larger.While many "fake meat" dishes are soy based (usually chicken) or seitan based (usually beef) in this case both dishes were tofu based so they were somewhat more crunchy than what I am used to, however they both tasted great and it was really all in the sauce.Considering how busy the restaurant was, the service wasn't bad at all, we got our dishes in a reasonable amount of time, and got our water refilled a few times. Even though, the table next to us was extremely loud, we still managed to enjoy the dinner.All in all, I am glad we stumbled upon this restaurant and now I know where to go if I ever find myself in Hoboken again.
2010-08-30,4,Let my first Yelp be a positive one.As a New York City native and having spent my formative years in the densely Asian populated Flushing, Queens, I've had my share of a spectrum of Asian food, be it take-out style or fine restaurant presentation. Precious is, well, quite precious. Judging from the storefront one might assume explicit fine dining, and located on prime Hoboken real estate, this is usually a good idea for a dining establishment. Upon entering it's more casual, more relaxed and just generally clean and tasteful. Most of my personal experience with Precious is of ordering food to go or delivery but my in-dining experiences have been pleasant and welcoming. BYOB is excellent next door to a liquor store.The food makes this place go. You can actually taste Chinese five spice seasoning in the eggrolls and fried chicken wings of all things! Every bit of sushi I've tried has been fresh and tasty.  Freshness and attention to quality is something I've come to expect from this place and have been rarely disappointed. Their vegetarian proteins must be tried. Their vegetarian scallops are more enjoyable than many actual scallops I've encountered.THE best place I've found that serves both Japanese and Chinese food. I've probably had better Japanese food at explicitly Japanese food places, same with Chinese food, but this place scores high in both. I'm not ashamed that they know my face there.
2010-08-26,3,Hoboken is certainly not lacking in Asian fusion restaurants, and I often frequent Rice Shop, which incorporates dishes from Thailand, Malaysia, China, and Japan.  However, I had also heard fabulous things about Precious, which focuses solely on Japanese and Chinese cuisines.  I was recently spending the afternoon with a friend and her boyfriend, and they insisted that we head there for lunch.  The menu offers lunch time specials from both Asian regions.  While my friends loved their fresh sushi roll platters, I opted to go the Chinese route with an order of Steamed Tofu and Mixed Vegetables with garlic sauce on the side.  I started the meal with a Vegetable Roll, rather than the soup, due to the summer heat.  The crisp starter was very tasty, but was heavily fried like a classic egg roll.  My entree was mediocre, because I found the mixed vegetables not overly fresh or crisp.  My brown rice was also fine, but not perfect.I did, however, enjoy the casual, yet sheik, decor and reasonable prices.  I could definitely add this into the second tier of my restaurant rotation.Precious offered us a relaxed meal in a nice environment.  The food was pleasant, but nothing amazing.
2010-07-27,4,Food here is very good and prices are reasonable.  It also has more variety (noodle soups and crispy noodles are really good)  than some of the other chinese restaurants in the area and some of the appetizers are almost as good as in chinatown.  Definitely better than the usual take-out.  Service is great as well, and the location is very easy to get to in town.
2010-07-11,5,This by far the best Chinese food in Hoboken. Great young chow fried rice and shrimp and broccoli in garlic sauce yuyuuuummm!!!
2010-06-09,3,Their vegetarian ma la scallop meal is delicious as is their regular ma la scallop. This place listens if you say extra spicy too. (which i enjoy)
2010-06-05,4,I have never been to Hoboken before and so my coworkers organized a night out here. Initially we were supposed to end up at Charritos for food, but alas they wouldn't take a reservation for such a large party.So Precious is where we ended up and quite frankly it turned out to be a big hit.  Right next door is a convenient liquor store to provide all our alcoholic needs for Precious is yet another BYOB restaurant.We had a nice table outside which made for good people watching while we waited for the rest of our party.  It took us probably a span of an hour and a couple of bottles of wine before our entire party showed up and surprisingly the wait staff were super understanding. (It may have been a different story if they were at capacity).  On top of their friendliness they offered to move our large group inside as the weather started looking questionable.We decided to stick it out and things worked out both weatherwise as well as food.  Most of what we ordered here was American Chinese food. You know all the stuff like  Sweet & Sour chicken, Hunan Chicken, your meat of choice & broccoli etc.  We also got a couple of sushi rolls and one coworker even got Chicken Pad Thai.So given the type of food we got you can already tell this isn't really a typical Chinese or Japanese restaurant but it is perfectly suited for the surrounding demographic.They do what they do well, with everything surprisingly delicious and being very large portions. Unlike other places that jack up their dinner prices for the same dish they serve at lunch, the pricing is far more reasonable being only a couple of bucks more.Staff was always on hand when needed which is great especially when you have a larger group. Overall a very enjoyable experience.
2010-06-01,3,So checked in here today on my new 4square account.(I wish it would link right to yelp somehow).  I have been here 2 times in a week now.  The first time I would of given 4 stars.  However, this second time I had to take a star away.  Overall the place is very good and probably deserves the higher reviews it generally gets.  My meal this second time was not good.  I had sesame beef.  It was real tuff and hard to eat.  It came with no veg on the side.  That is the only bad thing I have experienced with this place.  The first time I had some General Tso's chicken and it was good.  The won ton soup is tasty.  The service has been outstanding both times.  It is def one of the better Chinese food places in The Boken.
2010-05-17,4,The lunch special here is a ridiculous deal. Hot and sour soup is definitely the best I've had in Hoboken and the brown rice is done perfectly!
2010-05-13,4,I've once again had to switch Chinese restaurants. I do eat the lunch special at Precious which is always great.  But delivery is always the crap shoot. I must say thank you Precious. Got some standard dishes all well executed. Affordable. A couple highlights. 1. Holy shit. Cinnamon in the egg rolls. Can I say WOW.  2. I love wonton soup and the wonton has to be done right.     These aren't the wontons I like.......... but the use of Ginger is nice 3. Chinese teabags with the delivery. Perfect touch.4. nice scallion pancakesUnlike most places that do chinese, you can actually taste the ingredients.
2010-04-24,3,We came here because my in laws were hungry, didn't want to walk another 2 blocks, and only eat "chinese" food.  After 3 nights of different variation of chinese food, i decided to have the sashimi platter as a change.  Although the presentation was impressive, i feel the quality of fish was not very fresh.  Illuzion across the street is much better.
2010-03-26,4,We ordered delivery totaling around 30 bucks... pretty filled after and have a lot leftover. I have a tendency to order steamed dumplings (with my sibling asking for half fried and half steamed). it was 6 pcs each, and with 3 pieces for each, we were not full obviously- I think one of us needs to compromise next time..Mummy's review: Sushi was fresh, dumplings were good (I disagree)I thought the food was very good also- scallion pancakes were a little cold when it got to the houseI've eaten in this place about three times before and always have a good meal-their japanese salad with the homemade ginger dressing is great too! (comes with any sushi order which is a good deal)Its a nicely decorated place too if you want to eat at the place- obviously things will taste better because they are fresh out of the kitchen and not driven over! enjoy precious!
2009-12-22,2,The students at Stevens have a few staple restaurants that are just a part of our college lives. If you want pizza, you choose Benny's or Gio's. If you want Mexican, you go to Q-dubs. Hungry for burgers, J-Rock. Craving a sub, you have Vito's, Subway, or Quincy Toasties. And of course, everyone knows if you want Chinese, there is nothing more standard than Aroma. We can sometimes get stuck at these restaurants whether it's financially or for a lack of creativity, and we lose sight to other equal alternatives. This week I was able to find one of these equivalent alternatives in Precious down at the corner of 3rd and Washington (that's next to J-Rock FYI). Precious is a small restaurant offering a nice selection of Chinese and Japanese Cuisine.I've walked by the restaurant many times before, but for some reason I just never gave it a chance, much like many of the other restaurants in Hoboken. From the outside, it looks like a pretty modern and nice place to eat, which usually means that it's going to be expensive; however, that was not the case. I first walked in to an unsightly hospital curtain that did an effective job blocking the cold from the outside. It is about the same size and set up as Aroma, but just a touch on the classier and more modern side. The service was excellent. Even when there were multiple tables, the food came out quickly and my glass was never without water. The lunch specials at Precious are an incredible value with the average price between $6 and $7. Slightly more than the price of Aroma, their food was about the same quality, if not a bit better. For that price, I decided to order an array of foods to test out the quality of their food. My guest and I ordered Chicken with Broccoli, Sweet and Sour Chicken, and the Happy Family, which is a seafood and meat medley. Like I said, the quality of their food might only be slightly better than Aroma for the small price difference. Their Hot and Sour Soup that came with the meal was something to take note of, however, since it was one of the better Hot and Sours that I've had in Hoboken. Because the lunch was so cheap, I tried to order more food from the menu to try to stretch my budget for the week, but I found myself so satisfied that I couldn't do it.Probably to the delight of the Stute's business manager, a lunch that would have been enough for four people was around $25. If I had one complaint, it would be that I wish there was more of a dessert selection so that I could have spent more money on the review this week. Like I've said several times in the article, Precious is definitely comparable to Aroma, however, it's better food and stellar service for a small price increase is worth a try for the college student on a budget, which is pretty much everyone.
2009-12-19,3,i lean toward japfood, but i figure i'd give this a try. first off, the decor of the place is quite nice, and it can be a perfect date spot. ive been the precious about 6 times already and i order out ALL the time. their chicken and broccoili is good as well as thier shrimp and brocoli. general tso's is fine too, i must say thou, that the one reason i come here is for their fried rice...its simply amazing. and i do adore it.
2009-11-20,3,Expensive for Chinese food. And both chicken dishes tasted the same. I can't believe this is the only Chinese restaurant around?
2009-11-17,3,The only reason I give this place less than 4 stars is because the last time I got takeout, I found a cigarette butt inside the sauce of my chicken and broccoli. It was rather nasty, especially considering that I bit into it (obviously before I knew it was in there). Fair warning. I'm not saying boycott the place, just providing the info. I realize it's entirely possible that it got in there via the stock room but somehow I doubt it. Personally, I don't think I'll ever eat there again but who knows? In a couple of months I may change my mind. I swore the same thing about McDonald's after watching Supersize Me but surprise surprise, now I go there from time to time anyway.All that aside, this is a pretty good spot and I think it's unfair to give a place 1 or 2 stars based on one experience, no matter how traumatic it is. The portions are good, service is fast (a little too fast I have to admit, makes me question certain things). The quality of the food is good and the lunch special prices are very reasonable.
2009-11-03,4,Having lived in China for several years, I got sick of Chinese food and came to realize that the Amercian version is not quick the same.  Then I moved to Hoboken and discovered this place.  Precious is by far the best Chinese place in the mile square city.  Prices are right and the servings are good.  The only bad dish is the chicken banana.  Just doesn't work. Everything is worth it!
2009-10-15,4,Hoboken seems to have no lack of Sushi shops and no end of Asian cuisine offerings. However, Precious is able to stand out for not only offering two amazing menus, but for delivering on them too (figuratively and literally - very quick).The chinese menu offers many excellent choices, from pupu platter, to beef chow fun, to peking duck. The chef's specials are a bit expensive, but very good and go beyond the simple run-of-the-mill (though spot on) traditional dishes. Big points for offering choice of brown or white rice too.The sushi is not top-notch among other Hoboken venues, but well above average for the price, always fresh, never off. We usually just get a roll or some japanese salad to add some variety to our meal.Service is always efficient and friendly. The delivery, as mentioned, is fast and always gets our order correct. They also box things up well, no leaking problems, peking duck arrives in three containers to keep everything fresh.Precious is one of our staples and you shouldn't hesitate to try it. The prices are reasonable and the food is great.
2009-08-18,2,I've only eaten here twice before (and both times with Hank C.) but my experience differs greatly. It could have been that I've just been here on bad nights, but I will say that I would not go back to this restaurant. The service is fine, the place is decently clean, and the food is a bit on the expensive side. That being said, I don't think I've liked any dish that I've tried here (nor did the food agree with me). I'm pretty sure I got the double sauteed pork one of those times, and similar to Marc M.'s review - it was not good in either texture or taste.It's been over a year since I've last visited, but I do know that I will likely not try this place again. I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1 star because I did not write my review recently after eating here, so I have few specifics to point to in justifying a lower rating.
2009-07-19,4,Simple, tasty and filling Chinese food that costs a little too much, but will (I guarantee) fill you up. I had the Crab Rangoon and General Tso's chicken, and the lady got Chicken with Broccoli, though was tempted by the scary-sounding Banana Chicken.They don't say so on Seamlessweb, but it seems every entree comes with rice. Don't make my mistake and buy a big old box of rice. You'll be left with it and be too full to eat it.The Tso's -my generic yardstick for all Chinese - tasted great, with firm breadcrumbs and a tangy but not hot sauce. The general quality of everything was lovely, and the additions - such as around 2 million fortune cookies - were a welcome if not slightly overwhelming addition. The Rangoon was delicious too - sweet and savory at its best. Do not get the Wonton Soup, though. It's way too salty.
2009-05-31,3,good food, esp the buddha delight with perfectly baked tofu and the wonton soup is second ONLY to my own (which is my personal favorite :P)pretty decorgood servicefair pricesfast delivery to the area
2009-05-22,1,Sorry Precious. I have changed my mind. I dropped you like a boyfriend with bad breath. A friend saw one of your workers picking his nose while snapping beans. How disgusting. I won't be back.
2009-03-22,4,ahhh Hoboken, how you frustate me. With more restaurants and bars in one square mile, you constant offer some really sub par stuff. Precious,... you are not one of them. Seriously great chinese. Healthy and dirty greasy options, AND some not so bad sushi to boot. I'll forgive the 45 minute delivery wait and the really ridiculous phone manners. Delivering once a week im really familiar with your menu and most everything rocks.
2009-03-10,4,After 2 years and countless attempts to remember "where did I get Chinese from last time?  was it good?", I've settled on Precious as the best game in town.  I think the confusion probably comes from the overstuffing of delivery menus that all look the same.After the last couple of times, I can say with confidence you'll get the best Chinese delivery (I'm not a big Japanes eater, so I can't speak to their quality in that respect) in town at Precious, based on the following:Price for delivery food (vs somewhere like the Rice Shop, which is also excellent, but better priced for dining than delivery)Speed/accuracy of delivery (as a Jewish person, nothing spoils my Sunday night Chinese like a long wait for cold food or a mixed up order)Diversity of the menu
2009-02-28,1,Been there twice. Forget about it being cramped... every restaurant in Hoboken is.1. The first time, I tried the banana chicken. Awful!!!!! Slimy bananas, boiled chicken that was pale and slimy too. 2. Last night I had the double-sauteed pork. Plastic taste and texture on the pork, nasty pieces of tofu thrown in.I am never going back and I suggest you don't either
2009-01-25,5,I absolutely love this place. I'm a stickler for their vegetarian General Tso's chicken. It's so good that my carnivorous friends now order veggie meals from them. Some of my friends enjoy their vegetarian beef steak but I've never tried it and can't vouch for it. Their delivery is very fast I live in Jersey City Heights and get my delivery within 30 minutes. When I order I typically get the veggie General Tso's with brown rice, a veggie egg roll, their house salad which comes with seafood mixed in, and miso soup. The bill comes to $25 which isn't bad at all considering their rather large portion sizes. I can usually eat the food over  a span of two days just to illustrate how big the portion sizes are. I've also eaten in their restaurant and it has a great layout with a sushi bar on the back wall and a big Buddha statue in the front covered with dollar bills. The wait staff is very friendly and the meals come fast so you can get in and out quickly. It's usually not crowded so there's no need to rush and you can sit and chat as they don't play loud music.
2009-01-24,4,BEST Chinese I ever tried in HOBOKEN.To be honest, I'm REALLY skeptical about the Chinese restaurant especially  "Chinese Japanese" restaurant. None of Japanese runs a "Chinese Japanese" restaurant, so I barely trust their taste.HOWEVER!! Precious is my exception.I ordered Crispy Sesame Shrimp and Scallop to take out. WOW! So crispy, tender and tasty! They put some sources, fortune cookie and  my favorite woolong-tea in transparent fancy Chinese bag. WOW, So Cute.Dishes, Egg roll or Soup, and rice plus the fancy bag as above for Only $7! Great Deal!  My BF cares about keeping his buff body, so he doesn't want greasy dishes.Are you same life style?! Don't worry! They have OIL FREE dishes,  "Protein Torio"   It's Perfect for you guys!Further more,  I love their Cleanliness!!I LOVE PRECIOUS! I'm gonna come back soon!
2008-11-21,4,We love Precious.  The General Tso chicken is amazing and the rice and noodle dishes are tasty and well prepared.  It is the best Chinese in Hoboken I have found and I have tried them all I think.
2008-08-21,4,I hate Chinese food with a passion. Yet I love Precious!The boy and I choose to stay in and have an Anthony Bourdain nite; spliff + greasy Chinese + Evil Dead 2 = a quintessential New York dining experience, according to the newest edition of his book, 'Kitchen Confidential.'Our takeout order:Scallion Pancake - kinda greasy but yummyWonton soup - SOOOOOOOOO fresh and flavorful, with spinach leavesBroccoli in Garlic Sauce - delish, slightly spicySweet-n-Sour Chicken - basic, but really freshWild Garlic Shrimp - huge, fresh, GARLICY, and over a bed of spinach and onions.All of this came with three pints of rice, so we choice 2 white/1 brown, but didn't eat any of it....yeah, we're gluttons. Leftovers are rare.Didn't use the bathrooms, so I can't comment on their ADA-friendliness, but...while waiting for our order (10 mins, tops) I observed that the resto wasn't very crowded at 9 pm, and the waiters seemed very attentive to the guests; constant water refills, removing dishes, etc. Prices are a lil more expensive than your average joint, but worth it via quality (no 'un-veined' shrimp here, yay!) and huge portions (can we say leftovers?)Oh god...that broccoli was AMAZING, spicy, sweet, savory, sexy...mmm. Usually, I eat all my meat, followed by the veggies, however this broccoli stole the show; I INHALED the entire thing before I even touched my shrimp....or maybe this was the side effect of 'other things', ha.The next time I'm craving Chinese (which is a rarity) I'm definitely coming back, with or without Tony Bourdain's influence.
2008-08-09,4,Precious is, in my opinion, the best Chinese place in Hoboken.  Their traditional menu items always taste great - I'm a big fan of their chicken & broccoli with brown rice (& the while sauce).   And speaking of brown rice, you can get it on almost all of their menu items - even sushi!  Oh... their sushi is really good, too.Their delivery is fast, food is reasonably priced, and I've never known them to make a mistake with my order.  When you order for the first time, they ask you for your phone number and address and they store it in the computer; the next time you call, you're "in the system" and they pull up your profile right away.  It saves a few seconds off the whole ordering process - especially if you pay by credit card; they store the number and all you have to do is give the last four digits of your card and you're all set.Of course, it is chinese so I can't say that I'm totally wowed by the food/experience but if you want a staple in your life... Precious is it for Chinese.
2008-08-05,5,BEST CHINESE FOOD in Hoboken. Trust me. I particularly like their Vegetarian Paradise ($10.50) dish, as it is not too oily and comes in 3 separate containers.
2008-07-21,5,I came here once with 2 friends and I have been craving it ever since. For a Tuesday night, business was steady and now I know why.. Their food was delicious. Entree's are good to split for 2 especially if you're eating sushi for appetizer like I did.Their Sushi was freshly rolled to order and was so good! General Tso's combo was awesome. Comes with chicken and shrimp and brown or white rice.Can't wait to go back!!!
2008-07-07,3,Great lunch menu - both Chinese & sushi.  It's good when you're craving Americanized Chinese food.  The ginger chicken w/ string beans is very good.
2008-07-05,4,My wife and I lived in Manhattan for close to ten years, so we were very spoiled to have such amazing access to good Chinese.  When we first moved to Hoboken we were a little concerned that we'd be deprived of decent Chinese food.  Fortunately after trying a couple of other spots we discovered Precious.  I've got to say that we were very pleased.  The chicken dishes were made with tender white meat, and my wife's seafood dish was delicious.  We ordered in and the food arrived in about 20 mintues, which was impressive given it was a rainy evening where everyone probably had the same idea to order in.  If you're a Hoboken resident or just happen to be in town and crave good Chinese food, I strongly recommend Precious.
2008-02-18,4,I have eaten in their restaurant and had take-out.  Delivery is usually swifter than they say it is going to come, and always hot.  Eating in is also just as fast - I think I've only had to wait for seating once, too, as most people seem to delight in the delivery (I once saw a delivery boy make his way out with seven orders in hand).The food is probably my favorite Chinese restaurant in Hoboken, and pretty much isn't beat until you get to Chinatown in the city.  Yes, it's not the most authentic, and sometimes the ingredients they throw together are a bit strange (banana chicken, anyone?), but most of their dishes are well-spiced, balanced, and plentiful.While a majority of the dishes are a tad bit oiler (then again, I'm not sure of a Chinese restaurant that caters to English-speaking crowds that isn't) than what I normally eat, I can definitely say that there are quite a few options for everyone in the group I've gone with - vegetarians, meat-lovers, oil-free steamed dishes and even sushi if you're in the mood for that.  Usually I pick up a mushroom delight and a dragon roll... yum!
2008-02-17,4,First off, I should note that my review is based solely on pickup and delivery as, even though I've eaten their food about 100 times, I have never actually sat down in the restaurant.Precious has become my de-facto go-to place for Chinese take-out over the past year, due to their consistent quality of food and their excellent delivery service.The food is always of the highest quality that you could expect from a Chinese restaurant (I know that may not mean much in itself, but trust me that this is certainly at the top of the scale) and the menu does a good job mixing the traditional things you would expect, coupled with an excellent selection of chef's specialties.The delivery service is probably the best in town.  The person who takes your order is friendly and efficient and I don't believe they have ever gotten my order wrong.   If you've used a credit card for delivery in the past, they keep it on file and you only have to give them the last 4 digits - this certainly speeds up the ordering process.  Delivery is relatively fast for a Hoboken restaurant and they spare no expense packing your food in high-quality, sealable containers...this always ensures that your food is delivered hot.When you run a Chinese joint, it's very easy to get lost in the crowd, but Precious is. most certainly, an excellent standout.
2007-12-11,5,This place has the best vegetarian chinese food i've ever had.  that's right - ever.  I've only ordered take out and delivery, so i can't speak to anything other than the food, but when the food is this good, who cares?
2007-11-02,5,This is one of my standard "healthy food" places. I love their Buddha's Delight dish, it's tofu and veggies in an oil-free sauce that's sort of spicy and sort of peanut. I usually get the sauce on the side. It's yummy. I highly recommend this place. My friends often get sushi there and you can get it made with brown rice, which is a plus.
2007-08-21,4,I've eaten here 5 or 6 times, but I've gotten delivery about 5 gazillion times. OK that's a wild exaggeration and I apologize, I probably ate there only 3 times. So I'm gonna talk delivery, something Precious excels at. Why? I'm glad you asked...1)The person answering the phone is always professional. 2) You give them your phone number and they have your address - saves time and no screw ups.3)Delivery is amazingly fast. Seriously, I think they're cooking my stuff on the way over. 10 minutes, maybe 15 tops. 4) the food is packed nicely.5) The food is good and much higher quality than other Chinese restaurants in Hoboken. They have a Revolution menu for no oil stuff and vegetarian stuff. I usually order the standard stuff - Sesame chicken, beef and broccoli, fried rice, moo shoo pork etc. and it's all quite good. I like their noodle dishes a lot like mei fun and lo mein 'cause they're not greasy or mushy. I've never ordered from their sushi menu, but I'm kinda opposed to getting sushi from a Chinese restaurant the same way I'm opposed to ordering Chinese at a Greek diner.Wheelchair access: Precious is accessible and so is my condo where I get my food delivered.
2007-06-12,5,The special vegetarian fried rice is so good I would probably rob the place for it.  The ingredients are something like vegetarian chicken (and it's CRISPY), cashews, pineapples, and other things that obviously make this too good for other words.Literally I believe Precious can do no wrong.  Granted I've only had their vegetarian options, and that's what I will keep getting.  And their sushi... always fresh and perfectly rolled.Precious should be the only Chinese restaurant you go to in Hoboken.  Everything else pales in comparison.  (Except for maybe how fast Aroma's delivery guy is)
2007-06-05,5,just got back from dinner w/ my friends from here...a little tipsy from a glass of chard but we go here like once a week and get take out a lot.  It's great chinese food.  You can be picky and ask for sauce on side, veggies steamed etc and they don't get pist at you.  If your a vegetarian they have alot to choose from- fake chicken, steak, scallops and even duck.  we take are visitors/friends who are meat-eaters here all the time and they are always very happy.  It's BYOB and next to a liquor store so that's an extra bonus.  you can also always find street parking...or maybe i just get lucky with spots.
2007-05-26,4,This place is pretty tasty, I hope it sticks around.
