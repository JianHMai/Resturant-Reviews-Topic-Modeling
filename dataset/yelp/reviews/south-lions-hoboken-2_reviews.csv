2021-11-13,5,I haven't tried this place yet however first glance the prices seem very expensive. Unless it is extremely good or family style i will reserve final comment. The average dim sum dish in Chinatown with 3/4 pieces is $3/$5 this place looks doubleIm always looking for a better Chinese restaurant. Giving 5 stars for now will update after i actually try it. For these prices the bar is very high.
2021-11-13,5,Didn't know the area, but had to be near Stevens Institute so turned to Yelp for help and didn't disappoint here. Although they don't serve all the dim sum dishes they advertise, the woman behind the counter said they're hoping to put out a men to include more. That'll be nice. Otherwise, the food was very good quality and fresh. Some counter seating around one wall and the window, so maybe 6-8 seats total, but great for a quick bite. Wasn't difficult to get a seat as most people were doing take out. Great experience all around for what we needed, but that being said, Yelp did not list all the tons of other restaurants up and down the block.
2021-11-12,2,This place isn't good. I don't know what is going on with the other reviews. I've had dim sum from the best places in Chinatown, and this place doesn't compare. Not even on the same playing field. Ordered soup dumplings, steamed rice noodles with short ribs, sticky rice sui mai, roast pork buns, sticky rice with lotus, crispy taro dumpling, sticky rice with Chinese sausage. Nothing was tasty nor high quality. Do not recommend. Won't be back!
2021-10-18,4,I am a fan!This place is definitely one of the better dim sum places I've had in NJ. Not many NJ dim sum places can compete with the good dim sum places in Chinatown, NY, but this place does just that! So I love that they're so close to where I live.We've ordered from this place twice now, both for take out as there are not many seating options. So it's more for take-out. The first time we ordered dim sum, including the house special shrimp siu mai, pan fried radish cake, pork soup dumplings, egg custard buns, pork short ribs with minced garlic, crispy taro dumplings with pork, chicken feet with black bean sauce, and a few others. None of them disappointed, and each of them I would order again!The next time we ordered from them, we ordered dinner but two dim sum dishes since they were available in the evening! We had their pork chop with Peking sauce, sliced beef chow fun (gravy), House Special Golden Fried Rice, Egg Drop Soup, egg custard buns, and pork siu mai.The staff is also very nice, which is also a huge plus. I only had to deduct one star because I feel that their pricing is very high. I don't doubt that the price of commercial rent is high, but for such small plates, the prices are higher than I'd like. Maybe because I'm used to paying the prices in Chinatown, which I'm sure is also not cheap. Even so, this place is very good and very close to where I live. So when I don't feel like paying the $15 toll for more affordable dim sum, I can certainly come here for equally good dim sum.
2021-10-16,3,South Lions is definitely good and it's the only place I know taking the leap with freshly-made dim sum in Hoboken. Ordered delivery of four items. Three were very good (sticky rice/pork/in lotus leaf, pork siu mai w/mushroom & shrimp, chive dumpling) one was not great (steamed beef short ribs).  South Lions Hoboken is delivery/takeout only. My order of four items plus delivery was over $40, so the price to quantity ratio is a factor here. Overall, good food and freshly made choices, just a bit pricey for your average takeout or pickup.
2021-10-16,1,Wow this was not it. The pan fried radish cake was extremely sour tasting and funky smelling. Hoping we don't get food poisoning from the small bite we had, but this was completely inedible. The other items we ordered were edible, but not the greatest either. The sticky rice with pork wrapped in lotus leaf was very dry and salty without much filling. The skin on the shrimp dumplings was tough / thick / dry and I found shrimp shell in the filling. The pork siu mai and the pork short ribs were okay / slightly below average. The only thing I kinda liked was the bean curd skin roll.
2021-09-27,5,The vegetable dumplings were outstanding! The line in was excellent.I'll be back one way or another.
2021-09-17,5,Best soup dumplings in Jersey. These soup dumplings are everything. I literally crave them. Since finding this place I've taken a drive here every week. We tried a variety of their foods but always go back for those soup dumplings. Have them while they are hot because they are worth it .
2021-09-12,2,I was really excited to try this place since I love dim sum! But I didn't have the greatest experience. I ordered the pork siu mai and bean curd skin roll, and was told it would take 15 minutes. I ended up waiting an hour while people who had order after me and who also had larger orders were served before me! A woman next to me who had ordered right after me was served food at a reasonable time and kindly asked the worker if they could reheat one of her meals since it was cold on the inside. A disappointing experience and clearly disorganized. The food itself was good, but overpriced. They ended up refunding me for one of my orders because apparently the chef kept forgetting to make it. I don't really recommend this place to anyone, but was happy to hear that other people on Yelp had better experiences.
2021-08-31,5,Chinese dim sum, just okay tbh but it's in Hoboken, NJ. For that, it deserves 5 stars. More like if you want to get dim sum without going to the city or drive, here is one. Food is edible. Mostly pre-made frozen dim sum. A bit on the expensive side for dim sum, but it's in Hoboken. Middle class double income family can definitely afford it. You local dim sum to go I guess
2021-08-18,5,The best dim sum! Service is always quick and super friendly and the dumplings are perfection. It's tough to pick a favorite but the crispy pork dumplings and soup dumplings tie for first. I'm so glad they've opened close by, we'll be ordering from here a lot!
2021-08-08,5,So good! Finally a good Chinese spot in Hoboken. Not only is their dim sum good but so is their American Chinese! Wish they had more American Chinese but it's all good, as everything we had was delicious! Their Door Dash ordering was broken and their Uber Eats ordering didn't have everything, so they certainly need to fix their delivery but it just forced us to get out and walk but well worth it! We had their sweet and sour pork it was nice and fresh, not soggy, and it had a number of delicious vegetables in the sweet and sour sauce. Egg noddle wonton soup was some of the best we have had and their dim sum and pork buns were so good!! I can't wait to go back!
2021-08-06,5,Got take out here last night. They are supposedly in DoorDash but it wasn't working. It was worth the stroll. Delicious dumplings, amazing wonton soup, and the best sweet & sour pork we've had since moving to hoboken. They were out of bubble tea when we were there but there's two other bubble tea spots near by. Will definitely be back.
2021-07-30,5,I've tried both their regular menu and dim sum menu so far. All the dishes I've tried are great and the regular menu portion is huge! It's not like one of those American Chinese restaurants (they have those on the menu but you're missing out if you order them), safe to say that it's the best Chinese restaurant I've tried in Hoboken.
2021-07-23,5,This is a "fast casual" dim sum/Chinese restaurant, but I would say that it's actually on-par with some of the fancier, sit-down places I've been, so far that reason I'm giving it five stars! Definitely will be back.The shrimp shumai was my favorite - loaded with shrimp and flavorful.
2021-07-22,5,This place is legit.  Cantonese dim sum. I wish there were more variety of steam rice rolls but what I had was so damn good.  HK pan fried buns were perfect.  So we're the bbq pork in pastry and the potstickers.  Will def go back.
2021-07-21,3,Mixed feelings about this one due to an unfortunate mishap - found a plastic wrap attached to one of the dumplings, so safety is questionable. Did they steam the dim sum with plastic wrap together? Seems like it...I agree that this is a welcome addition to Hoboken when a dim sum trip to NYC is too far.Food - 3.5/5It's not the best but it's the only decent dim sum option in the area to fill the craving. I would stick to the shrimp dim sum and nothing else honestly.Price - 3/5Definitely overpriced. Hard to justify $12 for 3 or 4 basic dumplings.Chicken feet and chive dumplings were bad so I would stay away.
2021-07-20,5,Some of the better dim sum ive had outside of Chinatown! Sesame balls are my all-time favorite, and it's here it's . We ordered takeout from here 2 nights in a row.We're waiting on their tea menu to open!
2021-07-19,5,Great food,tried 5 Dim Sum,will be back for more.  Bare bones location, definitely take out or delivery is preferred.
2021-07-16,5,First time ordering takeout at this place today. Food is really good! Roasted duck is flavorful and crispy, dim sums are fresh and yummy!
2021-07-15,5,Finally no more going to Chinatown or pal park for some good dim sum. Online ordering system works great and they offer every typical dim sum dish with fair pricing. Ordered shrimp dumplings, shark fin dumplings and sticky rice. Forgot to order turnip cakes my fault on that ugh. The dumplings were fantastic,  great tasting and very filling. Just as good as chinatown if not better. No issues with the sticky rice either. Inside is very small and can only seat up to 10 if not less. As with most of Hoboken, its very tough to park. I had to park several blocks away and it was probably an illegal spot lol. South Lions is only a few blocks away from the waterfront walking path so its nice to go after a tasty meal.I ordered online 5 minutes after they opened and I was already order #5, so this place is catching on very quick!
2021-07-14,4,Good dim sum, prompt and helpful person to take orders. Good value for money. Dim sum are quite good but on the meatier side. Quite authentic.
2021-07-08,1,Absolutely horrible. Pricy. Each dish is extremely bland. Nothing compared to almost any dim sum restaurant in NYC... to top it all off...found not one but TWO hairs in my radish cake. Never again!
2021-06-26,5,A welcomed addition to Hoboken!  No longer need to travel to Ft Lee or Parsippany to get high quality, fresh dim sum...and it's served all day! It's the next best alternative to DinTai Fung and Tim Ho Wan.
2021-06-21,5,Very excited to see a dim sum place in Hoboken and the food tastes good! Price is slightly higher for the portion given, but the location is prime so it's understandable.
2021-06-16,5,Absolutely amazing!!!! Best Cantonese Chinese food in Hoboken and JC!!!! Please do well and keep it open forever!!!!
2021-06-13,4,Actually randomly came across this spot while strolling through Hoboken one weekend.  Was pleasantly surprised to see a new Chinese restaurant pop up in the area, and it definitely didn't disappoint!  The dim sum was extremely fresh, packed with meat and high quality.  Highly recommend both of the hot sauces that come with your order!  The only thing is that the prices are slightly higher than equivalent spots in the city, but will definitely be back for my next dim sum fix!
2021-06-04,4,Hoboken sorely needed a decent Chinese place and it has one.  It is a dim dum place but has many of the usual dishes including what they call Americanized Chinese.The food was good.  Some pieces of the duck were a bit inedible as mostly bone or fat but it meat was tasty.  Shrimp dumpling was good.  Not a fan of the mixed meat as prefer it have a peanut sauce instead of peanuts inside.Will happily try other dishes.
2021-05-31,4,Boy does this small restaurant really impress! Loved every dim sum I ordered! Especially the chicken feet... so tender, juicy, and the sauce was amazing! Will definitely frequent when I'm craving dim sum
2021-05-24,5,So psyched to have some really good dim sum in Hoboken!!  So fresh, well prepared - delicious.  They do NOT seem like frozen generic elsewhere-pre-made/re-steamed.  Dumplings are amazing. Didn't love the spring rolls but this place is awesome and we've ordered twice in one week.  Can't wait for the next round.  Hope they bring a fuller menu to this location.
2021-05-23,5,Yes yes yes! Hoboken finally has a top class dim sum spot. Rivaling Chinatowns best, South Lions packs a punch with flavor. Will be coming back quite often
2021-05-23,5,Popped in to order a handful of items off the dim sum menu and it was ready in 15 minutes (3 laps around the block). HIGHLY recommend the shrimp dumplings, shumai, and steamed pork buns. It's about time Hoboken got an authentic dim sum place! I can't wait to try more stuff off the menu.
2021-05-23,4,Love the new addition to the hoboken scene. Most of the things we ordered were great. The salted egg yolk buns were off. The filling needed to be liquid pipping hot and instead it was a paste with a funny after taste. Not sure if they were having a bad day or something. The pork buns were incredible though and loved all other things. Hope they fix the the egg yolk issues as those are usually my favorite dim sum.
2021-05-16,5,Very impressed. Ordered 3 items and all were excellent quality & authentic HK style dim sum! I will be working my way through the menu.....
2021-05-08,5,This is the real deal, and as good as it gets!  Hoboken's charm and food diversity and deliciousness just shot up a few notches in my mind after eating here! Family ordered in from here for Mother's Day brunch: Xia long bao (soup dumplings), steamed pork dumplings, steamed roast pork buns, fried scallion pancakes, hargow (steamed shrimp dumpling), scallion dumplings, and more. It was all so absolutely delicious and I have not had better dim sum in comparison to years of scaling Manhattan Chinatown, Flushing Queens, San Francisco Chinatown and more discovering the best dim sum eats. I love dim sum and will travel for it . . how lucky for us that this has opened in Hoboken and what a welcome addition to the neighborhood cuisine, which is diversifying a lot over the past 5 years in wonderful ways! I hear their taro cakes are also particularly good. Everything was spot on perfect. Thank you for making this a lovely family meal!
2021-04-27,5,So glad this place opened! Ordered 8 dim sum dishes and was happy with each one, especially the fried shrimp balls. Wish they had outdoor seating, they did not last I checked.
2021-04-25,5,Ordered takeout, everything was delicious! Sautéed snow pea leaves, beef chow fun- dry style & salt/pepper grouper. Will definitely be ordering again soon! So happy to have a place like this in Hoboken!
2021-04-24,5,Just found this restaurant less than a week ago and have already ordered from there 3 times, for both lunch and dinner.  Each time the food was excellent.  Very impressed that they make dim sum made to order, as that can be hard to find, especially in NJ.  Quality of the food is on par with Chinatown, also something hard to find in NJ.  The restaurant is unique among the Chinese restaurants in Hoboken - have not found traditional Cantonese food like this anywhere else in the area.  Slightly on the pricey side.  I hope they do some kind of rewards program!
2021-04-24,5,Best cantonese food in the area, by far. Large menu with many dishes that are hard to find around Hoboken. The dim sum is made to order and comes out fresh and hot, which is very welcome.
