2021-10-23,5,I spent the entire afternoon today at Bareburger - Hoboken catching up with old friends, and I really appreciate the way that staff made us feel welcome, never rushed, and served us patiently and excellently for multiple hours. The waitress and new manager who served us were both incredibly warm and helpful. The food and drinks were all great as well--I really appreciate the way that Bareburger caters to all dietary needs (having many choices as a vegan feels awesome!). Though we didn't take advantage this time, this restaurant is BYOB alcohol, which is yet another great option.
2021-10-21,5,I finally had my first Bareburger experience and it did not disappoint! I got the Country Bird Combo and it was pretty dang delicious. Seriously... One amazing sandwich. The Country Bird Combo: Grilled all-natural chicken, smoked bacon, asiago, organic baby kale, organic tomato, mayo, creamy honey mustard, sprout bun. It was the perfect combination of toppings and sauces on very delicious grilled chicken that was still somehow crispy. The combo comes with your choice of fries, sweet potato fries or a few different types of salads. I went with half fries, half sweet potato fries and they were great. I ate way passed being full because I just couldn't stop with the fries. If this combo wasn't $16 I would get it a lot more often. I love that you can feel good about the ingredients that they use, it helps justify the price big time. It might not be healthy, but it's all natural ingredients. They also have a ton of vegan and vegetarian options. Literally 1/3 of their menu is plant based or vegetarian which is pretty amazing. I would 100% recommend trying this chain out.
2021-09-12,2,I really like the food here, 4+ stars for that, salads are fresh and tasty and chicken sandwiches are good however the customer service at Bareburger is horrendous, -6 stars for service, better is my 2 star review. Staff is entitled, unpleasant and has no regards for its customers. I will never return, which is a shame because as noted, I like the food, but there are too many other viable options nearby that don't have disdain for their customers. If you can put up with the poor service, I highly recommend.
2021-09-06,1,Never order for pickup or delivery!!! Waiting forever.. change to dine in instead, save time, because they always prepare for the dine in orders first.
2021-08-30,3,If you want to dine inside the restaurant, you have to be really patient to wait for your food. We waited for almost 30 mins for our two burgers and salad. They have a lot, I mean a lot of take out orders, so they are pretty busy. Good thing about this place is you can bring your own drinks. And the waiter and waitress were friendly.
2021-08-09,2,Not just the Hoboken location, but Bareburgers I'm general are over rated. The food is decent but way over priced! The burgers themselves are $12-20 with NO sides. You're better off going to a well known steak house for a great burger.
2021-08-06,4,Ordered for pick-up one lazy weekday evening. I had the Supreme (beef, colby, smoked bacon, chopped fries, onion rings, lettuce, special sauce, brioche bun) but I did something dumb. I swapped out the brioche for sourdough because I thought the sourdough would hold up better for takeout. I was sorely mistaken. It was actually the opposite because my husband had the Wrangler and the brioche on that held up pretty well. But back to my burger. I forgot to request medium rare, so it came out as a medium but it was still pretty good. The onion rings were surprisingly still crispy. It's a pretty huge burger so I ate half for dinner and half for lunch the next day and the leftovers were actually not terrible. I remember ordering the same burger at the Edgewater location a few years ago and liked it. The french fries and onion rings just get me every time. Are these burgers worth $15? Probably not but if you want a burger in Hoboken, this is a solid option. Next time, I will dine in for a fresh one and hopefully branch out from my typical order.
2021-07-27,5,Love it! We keep going back. Great value, great menu. I usually avoid getting salads when I go to restaurants because I feel like it's usually too much for too little, but that's not the case here. Their salads are epic. Really large and satisfying as a meal. The crispy brussel sprouts side dish was an addiction for a while, but we finally kicked it. Super filling. I'm also a big fan of the vegetarian options - especially the "Sweet Dreams" sweet potato burger, which is awesome. The one misstep might be their new "The Gulf," which is a vegan-fish free patty which just doesn't hit the mark. I wish they would offer this as an actual-fish option.Anyway, big thumbs up. Glad this is place is here in town!
2021-07-17,5,I am a big bare burger fan!  I'm vegan and GF and this place is the best.  They've improved their menu and the restaurant is under new management.  I wish they kept the unique fork lights!  But anywho, I've ordered from them for pick up, delivery and dine in for years now and they've definitely improved with the delivery and pick up due to the hot plates.  Genius!  The service has always been great.  We've had Alondra a few times already and she's so nice, professional and provides great service. She's attentive and and great multi tasker. I had the opportunity to have her personally take our order vs ordering through the app and it was great. She recommended the vegan fish and the panda for my daughter and it was so good!! She's a keeper and give her a raise. Thank you Hoboken Bare Burger for the great food and great staff.
2021-07-06,4,I'm a big fan of Bareburger's Be My Burger option! They have every topping, sauce, and patty option imaginable. Whenever I order everything tastes so fresh and the patties are all pretty large. I usually order the turkey burger or the bison burger, both are delicious. I also love their Brussel sprout side, great alternative if you want to skip the fries! However, my only complaint is that anytime I order from Bareburger, I'm shocked at how quickly the cost adds up, even if you just order one burger. Tonight I ordered a turkey burger and it came out to $25...which is definitely a little steep. Granted, I added avocado and cheese, which are extra charges..but it's definitely not somewhere you'll find a cheap burger. Now onto this location in particular; I've dined in at this location and gotten delivery and almost always have had a good experience. They have indoor and outdoor seating, and the employees I've encountered are very friendly and helpful. The only two issues I've had at this location are minor; tonight they gave me a side of sweet pickles instead of dill, and last time I dined in they were out of Parmesan cheese for the Brussel sprout side. Overall, though, worth checking out if you're looking for a filling burger with organic ingredients!
2021-03-03,5,Oh my God, Bareburger - Hoboken was truly fabulous. Very comfortable, clean, and beyond friendly. Such an awesome menu, it was very hard to choose, but I am really happy that I bought Elk Burger. The crew is certainly a highlight of this place because they are always fast, courteous, and provide service with a smile! I would highly recommend Bareburger - Hoboken to everybody.
2021-01-04,2,love bareburger but I recommend to order for take out rather than dining in at this location. Due to COVID there are very limited seats but its at a first come first serve basis and no wait time is given or no reservation can be made. You order yourself on your phone which helps with no contact and but no one comes to the table to help you or serve water etc. It felt like a self serve experience and when asked for a sauce which we were charged an additional cost they didn't let us have it until we paid for it even if we we were already eating and mid meal which was quite inconvenient. Wouldn't dine in again
2020-12-26,5,Amazing burgers & the Banana Caramel shake is a most. Order came out fast & hot. Clean restaurant & great staff.
2020-11-06,1,Absolutely terrible. Ordered a subbed impossible burger for my vegetarian girlfriend and the y gave her a medium rare burger. Both our digital and physical receipts have a sub of impossible, the building was completely empty, and they still messed up. Normally I'm understanding of minor mistakes but this was specific substitution to make it veggie friendly that was confirmed multiple times with no other customers present.
2020-10-19,1,Our grilled cheeses and two burgers came out cold, we won't be dining here again. It wasn't even busy, they are just understaffed.
2020-10-10,4,One of my first outdoor dining experiences I. Hoboken. You order inside and they bring your food out to you. It had a sign for byob so we were able to run to the liquor store to grab something. Overall the food was good, burger was tasty and toppings tasted fresh. The fries were crispy and good. I did expect a little more based on prices but overall experience was good.
2020-09-27,4,Ordered delivery Sunday night, took about 35min- I was very glad about that and pleasantly surprised! Food arrived warm and tasted fresh. I ordered standard burger (Medium rare with cheddar) and SUB out the bun for lettuce bed- it wasn't really in a bed of lettuce so I added my own lettuce and it was delicious. The caramelized onions and special sauce added good flavor. Also ordered side of fries with no salt- they had some salt but nothing too over powering... I'd definitely order again or swing by for take out!!
2020-09-19,4,First time trying. Food was delivered quickly and hot. Taste was good. Onion rings a little hard, but tasty. Pricey, but I don't mind paying for quality. Definitely will reorder and recommend to friends and family.
2020-09-12,5,Had an amazing burger from here on Wednesday! The young woman working the front was kind, attentive and made sure everything was perfect (I believe her name was Reese). I will definitely be coming back.
2020-08-22,3,Had eaten at this spot in LIC last year and loved it so was looking forward to trying out the Hoboken outlet. I ordered a standard burger with fries and onion rings. While this may not be the restaurant's fault, I was disappointed to see that my food had turned cold when I received the delivery through Uber Eats. The fries and onion rings had become soggy and clumped together. I had to reheat everything. Having said that, I did like the onion rings quite a bit - the breading was well seasoned and crunchy. The fries were pretty standard. I had high hopes from the burger, which looked pretty appetizing, but as soon as I took that first bite, I knew this was nothing like the burger I had had at Bareburger LIC. The patty wasn't juicy at all, seemed pretty dry, there wasn't enough seasoning or sauce inside to help uplift some of the flavors. I may have a better experience if I dine in at their restaurant instead of ordering in, but I do believe restaurants need to ensure their food quality is top notch given the current situation when a lot of people will be ordering in.
2020-08-13,4,I've eaten at Bareburger a few times now and my order has always been delicious, sandwich wise. The Bareburger special sauce is delicious and the beef is always cooked perfectly. I've also tried the El Matador which I really enjoyed but the Standard is my go to. There's nothing better than the classic and the proportions are perfect so it doesn't fall apart on you. I deducted a star because of the fries. Every time I've picked up an order here, the fries are always soggy. They are really nothing special and I wish they would make them a bit crispier. Speaking of which, throw them in an air fryer for 4 minutes and you're good to go. Also, their ketchup is DELICIOUS. I always get extra packets. Overall, I'll keep coming back here because the burgers are consistently good and the online ordering service is easy to use.
2020-07-22,2,Overpriced. I substituted items for another but they messed up me and my partners order, only including our substitutions/additions and not what was already included although we specified otherwise. Now I understand why it's called bareburger, because they serve the burger bare, forgetting to place condiments that are stated in the burger description. Called back to leave a message about the order being messed up, because I wanted to feel less bad about how I wasted alot of money and got an incomplete burger. The Duke bison burger wound up costing me $17. 01. Please please please go to dark side of the moo instead for a local burger. They feature wild game burgers like kangaroo, venison, bison, etc... A double venison and kangoroo burger costs $14. 05, with extra condiments like the house made Pico de Gallo costing . 075 cents. Makin the Duke a double at bareburger would have costed an extra $7.99. Dark side of the moo also allows you to build your own burger and serves Brooklyn crafted ginger beer and ginger ales, including and extra spicy variant of their ginger beer. Please do not waste your money bareburger and go to dark side of the moo instead. The burgers here are bare.
2020-06-29,4,I ordered El Metador (with guacamole) and American (classic burger). They both were super juicy and delicious. Their patty is on a thicker side and it's cooked medium rare to mediumish. It was red-ish inside which is how I actually eat my burger usually. Their buns were fancy briosche buns (buttery deliciousness) BYOB!
2020-06-17,3,The American burger was great and just what I wanted. Fries/onion rings combo were pretty good as well but a bit pricey. The vanilla shake was completely overpriced for what ended up being only 12oz for 8$. THAT'S RIDICULOUS! Knowhere on the delivery app did it state the size. I assumed for the price it would large enough for two people to split. What a joke. The lack of transparency is extremely disrespectful.
2020-05-25,1,Workers don't wear masks but yet they require customers to wear masks. If I hadn't paid in advance I would have turned around and walked out.
2020-05-18,2,We try to support small local businesses. We really do, even though money is tight. Most businesses run on skeleton crews and delays and mistakes happen. But most mistakes can be fixed on the spot, and most small businesses try very hard to show their customers how much they appreciate the support. This time, we feel we made a colossal mistake in deciding to treat ourselves to a couple of burgers.Normally, we cook at home, from scratch, but sometimes nothing will do but a good burger from a burger joint. We ordered a curbside pickup. An order of two burgers, one side of fries, a salad, and two milkshakes came to about $80. When we picked up the order (took twice as long as they told us) and hurried home to eat it while it was still hot, we discovered one burger literally bare--a naked patty in a bun, all the trimmings forgotten--and the $7.99 milkshakes the size of a deli coffee cup (8 oz). There was nothing we could do at that point besides completely ruining the rest of our evening by trying to confront them, and to what end? The patty in a bun was tasty enough, but tossed into the bag naked like that definitely not worth the price.The worst of it is not that this left us feeling poorly served and ripped off. The worst of it is that it kills the desire to try takeout again anytime soon. As I said, we can feed ourselves. But we like to try to support local businesses, and with no money to burn right now, we will probably tend to avoid the risk of running into being extorted $7.99 for what is essentially a cup of milk.
2020-04-28,2,Ordered delivery service from here recently.  Just did not enjoy the burgers and fries. The food was room temperature.  Fries were soggy.  The burgers were unappetizing.  I'm surprised at the quality of the food as I've been here in the past and other Bareburgers in the metro region.
2020-04-23,3,I've been here about two times prior with my friend who is a vegan. She has been craving these burgers for a while so we opted to go there. But the food wasn't as good as we remembered. I decided to get a chicken sandwich because none of burgers were really standing out to me. The chicken sandwich was OK nothing special. My friend got some type of veggie burger which she said was really dry. We also ordered a side of waffle fries which I was so ecstatic to have because I love fries but the fries are cold.One thing I did notice was this bare burger was a byob. I thought that was pretty cool. Wish I knew about it before hand.
2020-04-20,4,Ordered delivery the other day as I was craving a burger / chicken sandwich and fries - Hence, that's what was ordered ! Here's the skinnyThe spicy chicken sandwich was excellent and the hero of the order with the only issue being the bacon on was very fatty. Upon removal , simply delightful The cheeseburger was very good as well and cooked medium rare with good flavor and toppingsLast and least in this case were the waffle fries - no bueno , a borderline cold and lacked any flavor . I image they are normally better All things considered, certainly my new go to for fried chicken sandwiches and a legit option for burgers!
2020-03-28,1,We like to support local businesses that care. Though we've had good eat-in experiences, under coronavirus, this is a takeout place currently. We walked in as the only patrons. A half hour later we got two burgers and large fries. Disappointed at the indifferent service, no apology for delay...delivery orders went out first.So home to eat. Overcooked both burgers. One burger was literally bare...nothing when we had asked for everything but ketchup.Staff was talking about having to work on Monday which will be slow and no tips...was it worth it?Merchants should be appreciative of customers who venture out at this time to try to help them out.Forget about it. Rotten service, screwed up order, over-cooked and no interest in customers...never again!
2020-01-14,4,I was skeptical at first as this is a national chain. Girlfriend ordered the crispy chicken sandwich, wanted a burger, but didnt want her dish to be better than mine, so I caved and got the crispy chicken sandwich. Not greasy, crispy, and quite a wide selection of add-ons to customize the sammy you may deem fit. Sweet potato fries were not greasy, and were ideal with the Special Sauce. Will be back soon. Please feel free to reach out with comments, questions, concerns.
2019-12-29,5,This place is always good. 100% of the time you'll get exactly what you wanted. This is where I go when I want to spend a little bit of money on a good burger. It's like the healthy sibling of shake shack.
2019-12-27,1,This establishment is ridiculous the customer service is horrible especially the one girl with the short hair she's really rude and got my order wrong. After waiting for 30 minutes to get the wrong order say to say I'll never be back
2019-11-23,1,Terrible. I asked for well done bacon and I got 2 pieces of fat. I had to take the bacon off of the burger as it was inedible.
2019-11-17,3,Tried this place for dinners one night.  Had the Bison burger Wife had the cheese burger.  Added onion rings and fries.  Flavor was good but food was not hot enough upon delivery to table.  Staff was friendly and restaurant was clean with casual atmosphere.
2019-10-17,2,After several good visits, my most recent visit to this Bareburger location was a dud. To make a long story short, we waited about a half hour for a two burger/fries order in a mostly empty restaurant. When I finally made  'what's up?' eye contact with the waitress, within a minute she brought out our food, lukewarm and probably sitting there for a while. No 'sorry for the wait', like our wait time was not even on the radar.  Honestly, I should have complained.  So in the end, $35 for two unenjoyable burgers, shared fries and one soda, and a half hour listening to loud music meant to entertain the staff I presume.  I don't expect to return anytime soon.
2019-10-12,2,I am not sure how this place is still in business. Overpriced, small portions and the kids meal is a joke! The fries were soggy, greasy and devoid of salt.
2019-08-22,1,Horrible customer serviceHad us wait on a Togo order for 45 minsNo one had the courtesy to come tell us how long our order would takeNor did they inform that the kitchen is backed up or anything as such.The ac vent keeps leaking and is a solid trip hazard.I wish I could've given no stars or half a starYeah this is pretty ridiculous
2019-08-21,4,I rolled in here with a buddy for a snack. Right away I was impressed with the stellar service, even after a big wave of people entered the place. I absolutely loved my hot honey milkshake. Very unique! My buddy liked, but did not love, his boar burger. I was too enamored with my milkshake to dive into his burger. I'll have to come back again sometime!
2019-08-17,1,Stay away from this location! I love bareburger and what they've done with the menu offering vegan options HOWEVER no ones food came out together which if that was the only thing that went wrong i probably wouldn't be writing this review. My mother's burger was ridiculously burnt totally inedible, my brothers vegan burger BURNT, his vegan bacon ICE COLD, my cousins chicken sandwich UNDERCOOKED I'm sure there was a lot more but if that didn't make you change your mind I don't know what will. Stick to the Edgewater location
2019-08-11,1,This is an entree salad w/ guac + $2 delivery + tip. Not worth it, and delivery guy called to ask for more tip. Never again.
2019-08-01,2,Truly meh for a place that is supposed to specialize in burgers. Placed another order today and third time in a row, the beef feels like it has been frozen and refrozen 5 times. Other ingredients and the sauce were good. Bison was an excuse to go here but it is no longer offered on the menu. Too bad
2019-07-28,4,Excellent burgers and my wife ordered the veggie burger with the collard green wrap...awesome.  Great selection.  Would come back for sure.  Pricey but worth it.
2019-07-12,5,The staff was very friendly and the food came out pretty quick. Most importantly, it tasted fresh and delicious! Definitely will come back.
2019-07-07,4,Seriously great experience! Their menu was filled with endless options and even had a whole backside dedicated to vegan food. Great service, our waiter even ran after me when I left my sunglasses at the table :)
2019-07-06,5,Maybe because of its close proximity to vegan-friendly NYC, Hoboken has never had many vegan options to offer locally. A couple of Indian and Chinese restaurants with some vegan dishes on the menu, a falafel joint or two, and that was pretty much it. Bareburger changed all that by introducing a menu that's 50% vegan with lots of cruelty-free dishes and customization options. Everything from starters to entrees to desserts is absolutely delicious and this place has quickly become our first choice for dining in or delivery in the Hoboken area.
2019-07-03,5,Had the beyond burger today and it was AMAZING! Their tempeh bacon was perfect, and the amount of vegan options on the menu is wonderful! Next time I need to try one of their vegan milkshakes. They also have great gluten free options.
2019-06-22,2,Honestly we were excited to try Bareburger, but had the worst meal tonight at the location in Hoboken. We're all feeling really sick. All our food was cold. The glasses they gave us were dirty - legit had a lipstick mark on one. The toppings on all our burgers did not taste fresh - the tomatoes and lettuce were half brown. I'm not sure how clean it is or how fresh the ingredients are. Maybe we came on a bad night?
2019-06-06,5,I ordered this burger late to go and they accommodated kindly although it was late and they were closing shop. Realizing it was too late to sit down, this was my only option. I ordered the Buckaroo medium rare and it was one of the most juicy, tasty, and satisfying burgers I had ever eaten. I was shocked at how good it was and especially as a to go order! (which for burgers I don't usually recommend). I will definitely be back. True, it's not the healthiest meal but definitely very satisfying and delicious!!! The service was great and I really loved their honesty: when I asked if they have any healthy salad options they said 'well they all come with toppings' (ie no) which is true ... no simple, healthy, plain green salads. Which was all for the best, as the burger was a quite filling treat!
2019-05-26,5,The food is great here and the service is very good too. I always order a Buckaroo and onion rings. It's worth the price.
2019-05-24,4,Vegetarian Burger Paradise - I say that, coz all burgers are totally customizable ! The toppings, patty, bun choices are pretty impressive.As for the sauces - Chipotle mayo is my fav !! The onion rings are fried to perfection.Would def go back
2019-05-14,5,Found Bareburger while doing a restaurant search in Hoboken before heading into Manhattan for the evening. I'm a sucker for loaded vegetarian burgers but it was always difficult to find a place that cares as much as I do when it comes to meat alternatives. Luckily, this jawn popped up in my search and bookmarked it. The decor is sort of a Wes Anderson interpretation of a cabin in the woods, with a touch of chic. I ordered a custom Impossible burger with seitan bacon and started with deep fried cauliflower bites. The food was satisfying and savory in the best way possible for a lifelong vegetarian who has settled so often whilst dining out. We didn't have to wait long for the food to come out. Didn't need reservations. I cannot wait to go again (they have a Philly location!). Truly loving this burger trend.
2019-04-18,5,Very Vegan friendly! had a whole side of the menu dedicated to vegan options and multiple desserts! I'm not sure if that is specific to this location or all bareburgers have updated their menu to feature that. They even had vegan hot dog options which is new to me, I had the faux bratweurst and waffle fries, very good.Also for non-vegans bareburger onion rings are the best I've ever had! I've brought my non-veg parents here on multiple occasions and they always love it as well.
2019-04-07,4,4 star food, 2 star service. I sat down right away only to find my waiter did not care for me. I waited 10 minutes for water and I had to ask. I love coming here for the vegan options, makes me feel less guilty. The food is always delicious. My girlfriend got the Buckaroo, and the bacon was not cooked at all, she couldn't eat any of it. I got a vegan burger and fries - no complaint there!It took quite some time to get our check, and then.... give it back ugh. What a process....
2019-03-22,1,Terrible! I ordered a burger for delivery and it was rare in the middle! I waited for an hour for an uncooked burger. I will never order from this place again.
2019-03-12,1,They used a beef patty when I ordered bison. Also they didn't deliver the sauces I asked for on the side. Morons.
2019-03-04,1,I used to love bare burger and would stop in / order at least once a month. Stopped in ~2 weeks ago with a friend. Both of us ordered veggie burgers (black bean for me quinoa patty for her) with a side of onion rings and fries. Both of us felt a little weird after the meal and she unfortunately came down with food poisoning that evening.Will likely continue to eat Bareburger at other locations but I'm thinking the Hoboken location is dead to me.
2019-02-12,5,This place has been on my list for quite alms time now so when i had the chance in hoboken I went! Got the sweeet chicken sammy which was so tender and delicious, lightly breaded with the right amount of sweet and salty !
2019-02-11,4,Ordered pick up through yelp! And waited about 5-10 min for the counter person to grab my order on a shelf. Also was given free coffee after waiting a while but coffee wasn't very good, it was cold. But the burger was delicious! I ordered a beef burger with a collard green wrap, onions and bacon. The burger was delicious, I would definitely come back for the burger. I can to pick up around lunch time 12:30-12:45 and it was pretty busy.
2019-01-31,5,Any place that serves the Impossible Burger steals my heart from the start. I've been to this location a number of times, and their menu is super veggie/vegan friendly! They even have a vegan cheese option that actually tasted amazing - the waitress was also so friendly and helpful and let me know the brand of the cheese! Finding good milkless cheese has been a true struggle and Bareburger has finally ended my search. The burger options are vast, especially the patty list. The food is always fresh and delicious! Price wise, this place is definitely on the higher end, but it's worth it every once in a while for a genuinely quality burger. Just remember fries come separate and the portions are big enough to split.
2019-01-31,5,The place place to get burgers PERIOD! Such a cute little environment and even when it gets super busy, the staff works together to make sure you are being taken care of. Whether you're getting a burger or just a salad, you are guaranteed exceptional food here!!!
2019-01-27,1,Went there put our name on the list the guy said 20-30 min wait we waited and they called us 30 min later said they can't sit us no more because they are having a party of 30.
2019-01-26,4,Love the fried chicken sandwich and the sweet potato fries! Have tried their burger. One or two other places in town seem to have an edge up on the burgers here, but they are adequate, just not outstanding. Service is good although counter service at the front is not so friendly as other places in town.
2019-01-23,5,I came here today and WOW! The have multiple options when it comes to vegan and vegetarian burgers and sauces along with the homemade shakes (which I highly recommend!) a tad pricey but worth it when it's done right. The staff was very accommodating and gave me suggestions since it was my first time at a Bareburger location. I'll be back for sure!
2019-01-10,4,Great casual burger joint! I've been here a few times for dinner and have always been satisfied. Love the variety of different meats - my favorite is the Blazin' Bison burger as it has a great combination of flavors (sriracha mayo, jalapeños, and Napa slaw). Sweet potato fries are also a fantastic side. It's a bit pricey for a burger place (12-15 bucks for a burger and sides are separate around 5 dollars per side) but Id still put this as 4 stars because of the selections, especially for those who are vegetarian or vegan.
2018-12-06,5,I stopped here after my daughter's modeling gig in Union City. Great food and reasonable prices. Kind staff with lots of information. I ordered off the build-your-Own menu. They forgot the blue cheese, but it was so good, I didn't even notice! The waitress removed it off the check anyway. Sweet potato fries were fresh, not frozen. The house made soda was great, too. I'll definitely be going back.
2018-11-12,5,By far my favorite restaurant in Hoboken - I life the supreme burger. Topped with onion rings and fries and the soda is delicious too as it is made with real cane sugar. A restaurant that cares about the environment (paper straws) and is vegan friendly.
2018-11-05,3,Nice casual spot, but have had better burger. We got the impossible burger and were fairly impressed by the patty. The Guadalupe (not a 100% sure it was called that ) burger wasn't that good. We also ordered a side of rings and fries which to our surprise were a bigger portion than the burgers.
2018-10-21,4,Sometimes you want a burger, but also want to feel healthy! They have a wide range of meat and vegan burger options and the burgers are entirely customizable! They've also recently added a brunch menu. They also serve vegan shakes. A good option for burgers.
2018-10-11,5,Awesome! Thanks Mathew for taking my order early and making sure it was delivered at the proper time. The Beyond Burger and onion rings were amazing!Thanks so much. You guys rock!
2018-09-28,4,The peanut butter milkshake with vanilla ice cream is bomb!  Perfect when you're craving a treat!  The burgers and fries are good too.But the wait time is so long!  And it's so expensive!!!But the food and service is good.
2018-09-28,4,Delicious  , smallish portions and great service !Lots of vegan and gluten free options . Woodsy casual atmosphere. Not enough booths .
2018-09-23,1,I love Bareburger food, but every time my husband and I order, it is well over 1.5 hours wait. One time, they told me the order was on the way but they never got our order, so they lied. I am often quoted 45 minutes, but this is never the case. There are so many places in Hoboken to order from what actually deliver in the quoted time, would think they would actually deliver. I'm going to stop ordering Bareburger after this experience.
2018-09-15,5,***update to give a big customer service shout out.  I ordered through the app which is usually good but sent my order to an NYC location.  Must have been because I ordered from the ferry and it picked a closer one.  Warning to check your location when ordering.  Anyway when I got to Hoboken the server was totally chill and helpful.  She quickly got a new order going for me and even called the NYC location to cancel the other order and get me a refund.  She turned a potentially bad situation into a mild inconvenience.  Master class in customer service and building trust in a brand.  Well done! Bareburger just shot way up on my list.
2018-08-21,3,Arrived at the restaurant on a Saturday's night around 9:40 pm and the store is not packed at all.The restaurant looks clean and new. As I stepped in, I have liked the simplicity of the space, even though this is my first time trying this place.  My friend has suggested me that they have pretty good chicken burger, but as a beef lover, I ordered el matador. My freiend tried their vegan burger. I have to be honest that this is my the best burger I have had, it's quite juicy but at the same time a little too blend that I feel a little bit spice will be more helpful. The vegan burger is quite creative, but similarly, I'm never a vegan food fan, so it's not too attractive to me. I have to shout out to the onion ring and the sweet potato fries, which we have ordered as a side. If you order it, please make sure you ask for for chipotle sauce which goes really well with it! It's the best!!I am not sure whether it is because we have arrived the store kinda late or it is a normal condition, the service is really slow. There was only one person serves between the booths and tables, and he is definitely overwhelmed even though there was not that many people. Our table has been ignored several times, and we will have to get fork and nice from the bar ourselves. Hopefully this could get improved. We didn't order smoothies these time, but overseen from another table, it's definitely really attempting. Next time maybe a to go=)
2018-08-15,5,Stopped by at 1130am to grab a quick bite after my doctors appointment. When I walked In i was immediately greeted by an awesome gentlemen who grabbed me some water and a tea. There was only one other person at the time dining there but the place quickly filled up and i understood why. Service was great, food was amazing, and atmosphere was welcoming for business people and families alike!!
2018-08-04,4,This place has an amazing fried chicken sandwich. It was insanely delicious. Super crispy and juicy. Fit perfectly with the buttery brioche bun. There is nothing bad I can say about the sandwich. Service was great as well, the waiter was friendly and put up with my friend and I raving about the chicken every time he stepped near the table. Also, the atmosphere is cool, relaxing with some interesting décor. They also have a bunch of different homemade sauces including ketchup. I will definitely be going back with the intent on trying a burger but if I'm honest with myself I'll be getting another chicken sandwich.
2018-07-31,5,Love everything about Bareburger. Food is delicious. Wait staff is great. Everything they stand for is great!
2018-07-24,3,Service was Good, my only issue was the fact that the server never told me and my guest about the lunch menu as we ended up paying more for our meals when we could've saved money. Milkshakes are very thick and hard to get out with the straws at times. Vegan burgers were good, had the impossible burger here for the first time, thought it was really great until i had it somewhere else and they had a better twist to it than you guys did. I would suggest a special sauce or something. A lot of room for improvement; i'll be back in a couple months to see changes.
2018-07-20,3,Been to a few other Bareburgers, and this one was a clear level lower than than the others.  We didn't have to wait long to be seated, but it took awhile before a server came to us.  After we placed our order, it took another 40 or so minutes for our food to arrive (the waiter told us the apps would come out first, but both the apps and entrees came out at the same time).  Our chicken fingers were extremely overcooked, but the onion rings were spot on.  I had one of their standard burgers and it was good, but nothing to write home about.  My girlfriend got the black bean burger, and reported that it was terrible.  Overall, a mixed experience, but I would only come back to this specific Bareburger if I was really craving this experience.
2018-07-15,1,My boyfriend and I went to the Hoboken location yesterday for dinner. We normally go to the location in Montclair, which has great service, but I cannot say the same for the Hoboken location. Upon arrival, we had to wait, which is expected. Once we sat at the table, we weren't given any of the complementary water. Someone who wasn't our waiter noticed we didn't have water, and finally gave us some after about 10 minutes of waiting. Our drinks that we ordered also took a long time. Our orders were taken, so everything was good. A whole 40-45 mins go by and we still hadn't received our orders. We noticed a couple who came after us received their food before we did. We brought this to Bareburger's attention and we wanted to leave. Our waiter didn't even notice we didn't get our food. That's because he literally came to the table once. They finally gave us our food, and when it arrived, the chicken on the chicken sandwich was over cooked and looked like it was cooked in old grease. On top of that, the food wasn't hot. Meaning, the food was probably just sitting there and no one served it when it was ready. We told the waiter that we wanted to leave. So we ended up not eating there that night. We weren't charged and even if we had to pay, we weren't going to ! The worse service we received from a restaurant.
2018-06-10,5,We went here for Saturday dinner. We had a make your own burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and a side of fries and rings. They forgot the American cheese which we had requested for the burger, but the black bean patty was delicious. Overall the food was very healthy as compared to other burger joints.
2018-06-10,2,Burger was good but not great at what they're charging for it. I ordered the Buckaroo and the brisket was not as tender as it should have been. Their drinks are me with organic ingredients which is supposedly healthier but sometimes you just want an actual unhealthy soda with your burger. Their drinks have an awful aftertaste and not even a great beginning taste. Ice on the side
2018-06-07,2,Food is pretty good.  Increasingly they can't work out timely delivery.  In the absence of this I simply can't offer a good review.  Great food that's late isn't great. Good food that's late is a mistake.
2018-05-10,4,This burger place was very good. We came in really late searching for food, as everything had closed. The servers, although not happy, served us with good service and the food was amazing. We made sure to leave a good tip! GET THE SHAKES. the shake was sooooo good. I'd fly back to New Jersey just for this.
2018-05-08,5,The Vegan options - WOW First of all, impossible burger and the beyond burger They have vegan mayo, vegan cheese along with black bean burger options and more. On top of that for dessert, they have three vegan shakes. Two (I believe are nut free) but always ask just in case obviously. The servers are very nice and the prices aren't bad for a date night out. They are also open until 10:30 which is nice. Highly recommend: Impossible burger for a unseasoned beef taste - tastes incredible just like beefBeyond burger for a more bbq'd burger taste - very authentic to a summer cookout.
2018-04-19,1,I was really upset with my experience here. I have been to Bareburger in the city and it was so much better.Our waiter was friendly, but not very helpful when it came to the service. He took our order on his tablet and read it back correctly. There were four of us, and when the order came- two of ours were mixed up. The medium burger had the toppings of the well done burger and vise versa.  I sent mine back and asked that they cook it medium and to include the correct toppings.  When my food finally came out, everyone else was done eating. It would have been nice if they offered something to eat (fries or anything) while we waited.When my food came back out the burger was well done, again. I was hungry and the people I was with were ready to leave so I ate it. It was not good. When the waiter finally came by I was finished eating, he asked how it was. I told him that it was still well done the second time. He then informed me that he just found out from the chef that their medium is considered well done by others, so maybe to order medium rare next time. First, if this is true then it would have been nice for the waiter to tell me when we first ordered our meal. Second, why wouldn't he have mentioned this when they took it back to correct the meal?Overall, the food was not good, and although the people that worked there were friendly, they did not take care of their customer.I would not recommend going here. There are plenty of great burgers to get in Hoboken!
2018-04-14,2,This place used to be our first choice to go in this area(Right after they opened).But sadly, not anymore.Me and my husband, and my friend recently went back to bare burgers. It's been a while. About 1.5 - 2 years?Food quality was so dropped.We were very sad. We didn't have the great flavor we used to had at first bite. Something was definitely changed in the ingredients.It always happens when they tried to expand the business(portion gets smaller or the lower the quality).We were very disappointed and very sad to Saying good bye to our favorite burger shop.
2018-04-10,2,Nice burger.  small but nice.  added mushrooms, got two of them.  added avocado, got a slice.  the tomato and lettuce were wilted.the big issue is the price.  way over price.  not worth the money.   there are enough other places where the cost and quality are better....service was nice
2018-04-06,5,Love the vegan options here!! Try the impossible burger and any of the vegan milkshakes it's very worth it. I also really love the carrot cake here. And overall the service is always good.
2018-04-06,5,This place has great burgers. My personal fav is the supreme. It comes with French fries and an onion ring...IN THE BURGER. Amazing. Also highly recommend their chocolate hazelnut milkshake...but have the replace the vanilla ice cream with chocolate for the ultimate experience
2018-04-06,2,Food was great tasting but everything was COLD   Burger fries and onion rings. Cold. Cheese. Sad
2018-03-22,5,Yes yes yes! Impossible burger will blow your mind!Regardless if you're vegetarian or vegan you must try it. It's delish!
2018-03-09,5,So Hoboken BareBurger - Is EVERYTHING!!! They are the best location hands down. My boyfriend and I are sooooo obsessed that we go there every two weeks after rock climbing!!!! Aaia the server, should run for President!!! The entire staff makes u feel at home and they all are simply some kind of phenomenal!! You have to try their new Thai Ketchup, it's delicious!!! We made a yelp account just to brag about the Hoboken location!!! We also posted abt our experience a month ago but it was taken down, we imagine the nice people of yelp thought the comment was too perfect and suspected it was spam!! So please see our attached pictures of Glory below! The Brussel Sprouts were amazing and the new Flamin Bacon is to die for! We love BareBurger Hoboken so much so that we're heading there now for our biweekly dose. YELP please do not remove this post as the world should know abt this hidden Gem!! Love Shauna and Anthony!!!
2018-03-09,5,So me and my girlfriend went here on Friday 1/25/18 and had the most amazing experience of Bareburger history!!!! (Girlfriend has taken over this review and is writing now) From the beginning the hostess was so sweet and accommodating regarding our booth request and got us in before the quoted time. Then once we sat we met Aiah and another beautiful young lady who I can't remember her name because she was not the main server but was just as attentive, ( she was beautiful and I believe she was Filipino or Spanish) we couldn't tell but we didn't get a chance to ask her name... when I tell u we almost gave up on Hoboken's bareburger due to the restaurants small size and the byob policy but all three of these woman truly changed our perspective tonight! This is now our favorite location between New York and New Jersey. We've never had better service! We didn't have to ask for anything! They read minds... Aiah for president, beautiful Spanish or Filipino girl for Vice President and hostess around the hour 7:30 pm for First Lady LOl!!! Who ever does the hiring here is amazing... seriously Aiah was funny, attentive and super understanding the entire time, we sent back some burgers with aged beef simply because we tried them for the first time and didn't like the aftertaste but see didn't judge us for it! In fact she had the new ones out within 10 mins... I could go on and on... you have no idea the gems that you have working here! I love Aiah!!! We will be back... next month- we need some time to digest all of this amazingness if that's a word. Shauna ( ahony's very happy girlfriend) lol
2018-03-07,3,I have been here a few times over the last few years and found it to be hit and miss, my advise is to stick with the basics, all the exotic meats sound wonderful but the reality is slightly different, the standard burger is good as are the fries, I have had the chicken sandwich too,  it found it greasy it's fried chicken so I admit this is to be expected but ....I wish they did some healthy options a grilled chicken sandwich for example.I will probably go back for lunch with people who are not adventurous eaters but do t find myself drawn there, BYO with a liquor store opposite is a big plus.
2018-02-25,5,The BEST!!!Full disclosure, my husband and I order delivery from this location 3+ times a week. The food is fresh, organic and delicious! Definitely an upgrade from our previous delivery tendencies. They have an amazingly wide selection of offerings, each tastier than the last. And we love all the delivery guys, just the nicest, coolest guys (whoever does the hiring knows what's up!)Thanks you for being the nicest and always keeping us so well fed!
2018-02-11,4,Bareburger can be really great, but can also be hit or miss most of the time when it come to delivery. The good:-The burgers are very flavorful and juicy. I love their blends of condiments and toppings for the different options. My fav is The Standard Burger.-Onion rings with the curry ginger ketchup is bomb! Just be aware these are heavily breaded/battered onion rings not typical fried crunchy ones. A couple will leave you stuffed.-I love that all of their salads come as a side option. HUGE PLUS. So many places have great salads but you are forced to get the huge size, Bareburger gets this right.-The Cococado is amazing. If you like Key Lime Pie you will love it.The bad:-I prefer my burgers medium rare but on most occasions for delivery at least, burgers arrive very rare. It wouldn't be so bad if they were hot, but they always arrive lukewarm which makes me feel like I'm eating something closer to steak tartar. I pop them in the microwave for 45 sec normally.-Don't get the regular fries. They aren't worth the carbs/calories. Nothing special and pretty tasteless starch. -Like the burger, most food arrives from delivery lukewarm/cool no matter how fast they bring it. It all tastes good but it never is hot.
2018-02-02,5,This is my son's favorite restaurant. And I can see why. They have a terrific selection for every dietary need. I had the "make your own burger." Delicious! The wait staff were very accommodating and nice.
2018-02-02,5,They have delicious food for people of like every dietary restriction. A vegan, a gluten allergy, and a kosher person walk into Bareburger and they all walk out with big smiles and happy bellies. Staff is very friendly, 10/10 would recommend. Also Aiah is super duper fab.
2018-02-02,5,Excellent food and vibe. I tried the new fad Impossible burger while hubby had one of their specialities El Matador burger. Very kid friendly which is a huge plus for families. Everything from the burgers to the onion rings and fries was delicious. Must try.
2018-01-29,5,Went here after a long day at work and everything was AMAZING! For sure start with the Brussel Sprouts then get the cattle burger with fries. All three dipping sauces that come with it are delicious. And Henry our waiter was so nice and attentive! And food was delivered very quickly. Would def come back!
2018-01-25,5,I think it is a little pricy but the food is very good. They have a lot of perks especially for Steven's students. Me and some friends went and our waiter (s/o to Henry) told us about all of them and gave us a 10% discount for being Steven's students. Nice atmosphere and good burgers and shakes
2018-01-25,5,The sweet potato and wild rice burger is excellent.  What makes it special is the avocado basil pesto spread.  Very tasty. It does not come with a side so if you you want fries, you have to order separately.  I ordered the sweet potato fries.  Overall good food.  Service can be a little slow. Just be assertive it things should move along.On my second visit service was so slow I had to dial back the rating. Three different groups received their food before even though I arrived and ordered before them.Third visit things went back to normal. The sweet potato and wild rice burger is still Awesome!  Excellent service now. Order for dinner was taken by HENRY right away and with a packed house I received my food very fast.  Bare burger is back on my rotation for dinner and lunch!
2018-01-25,5,Our waiter Henry was AWESOME right off the bat, and this place is always a great choice for brunch, lunch or dinner. Highly recommend!
2018-01-25,5,The Macho Fries are amazing. The atmosphere is great. Good place for families. Love that it is BYO. Can't wait to come back!
2018-01-25,5,Would highly recommend Bareburger. Not only is the food delicious, but the staff always goes above and beyond for us.  We come here every Thursday with a 3 & 6 year old and they both love coming to see our favorite servers Henry and Alberto!
2018-01-24,5,This place is impossibly good!! Why, you ask? Because it has the Impossible burger, duh! Want it all vegan? Check! Super veg friendly and it has an amazing atmosphere. Did I mention it's BYOB? Oh I didn't? Well, it's BYOB! The last B stands for alcoholic beverage (don't try to sneak in a coke, silly...they have natural sodas!). I give this place 5 stars. Come here for the food and stay for ambiance (until closing time, of course!).
2018-01-24,5,Love this place! One of my fave places in Hoboken! The farmers quinoa burger and French fries are awesome. Great place to come with friends after a tough gym workout. Also love the shakes.
2018-01-24,5,First time having the elk burger and definitely recommend! My boyfriend had the turkey burger and loved it as well.
2018-01-24,5,Bareburger serves some of the tastiest burgers in Hoboken. Despite being a bit on the expensive side, it proves to be well worth the cost. They have a wide variety of meats and toppings which lead to every visit being a unique experience if you choose to explore the menu. I cannot recommend this place enough.
2018-01-24,5,It was good.  Aaron and Henry were the best waiters. My friend had a great birthday dinner.
2018-01-22,2,Burgers and some of the other food items are ok... but a number of times they just seem to forget to give you everything you order.The most recent take out order, they left out one of the burgers.  Called them and there was nothing they could do... they wanted me to drive 20 mins back and pick up the burger...  when I finally spoke with a manager.. they said order through Uber eats and we will credit back the cost... They credited back the cost of the sandwich.. but left me with the fee from Uber eats.Won't be returning to this location anytime soon.
2018-01-17,5,I absolutely love this place. The decor is super cute and the staff is on top of things. My burger was delicious and they even have an option now of getting any of their salads as a side portion instead of just the usual french fries or onion rings. The fact that they're all natural is also a plus. Even the hostess came to our table to make sure we didn't need anything else. Their bison burger is A-mazing. Super flavorful and it was cooked perfectly which is unusual because I'm very picky with how my burger is cooked. Definitely would recommend.
2018-01-08,5,All around great burgers!!! I love that their food is all organic and natural. This location in particular is very family friendly as well!
2018-01-06,5,Recently went here during the holiday season.  Really made all the cold and the traffic worth it.  Service was awesome and if you like burgers.... man o man... you have GOT to go here.  Hands down best burger I've ever had.
2018-01-05,5,Great burgers and service with a smile.  It's great to have a healthy alternative to all the usual spots.
2018-01-05,5,Where do I start? The burgers are all amazing including the build your own options. I also ventured and had the vegan burger and it was the best vegan burger I've ever head. The Nutella shake and banana something shakes are almost amazing!!!!! Staff is great and friendly as well. Would def recommend trying this place out
2017-11-28,4,I've ordered from this on UberEats, and have enjoyed it both times. I've only gotten the chicken sandwiches and both tasted great, even as to go. I especially enjoy the sweet potato fries. They're not disgustingly soggy as most fries are when you get delivery. If you're reading this review because you're wondering if you should order this, just do it.
2017-11-05,5,Yes, this is a chain, but their food is delicious and they keep the restaurant and bathrooms very clean. My one problem with eating out in Hoboken is how dingy and unclear some of the restaurants can be. Vegetarian and vegan options are excellent!It can get pretty busy during dinner due to the small size of the dining area, but the wait time is often much less than the host/hostess will tell you. You can leave your phone number and they will call you back, so if you still have some Hoboken exploring to do, you won't feel confined to the area. I once went in and they wouldn't seat anyone due to their internet being down, which is incredibly stupid. That was my only bad experience.
2017-11-03,5,Love the vegan prairie burger (add avocado!!! It's worth it). Never fell in love with a burger before. This is a place I keep coming back to over and over again. I would attach pictures, but the burger I get doesn't look that appetizing haha. It tastes amazing though and the flavors are definitely there.
2017-11-02,4,I love Bareburger, they have an incredible black bean and corn veggie burger and delicious sides. Only downfall is their delivery - it's always very slow, the food is usually cold and if you've ordered a sauce on the side (which you pay for, though around 55¢) it's a flip of a coin if you'll receive it. All in all, the food is great, but eat in or pick up for the best experience.
2017-10-15,1,Delivered oily, overcooked sweet potato fries. Added pic of the fries on their profile
2017-10-15,3,The macho fries were good and burger was ok... the service was fine but the overall experience was ok
2017-09-23,3,Service needs to be improved. Requested booth that was being used by a single employee there are only 4 booths...
2017-09-19,4,The Bare Burger is a very good burger restaurant in Hoboken. It's service is amazing! The waiters greet you very kindly and they don't rush you to order either. I also like the fact that Bare Burger employees will guide you to your seat really fast! They also ask you which seat would you like. You would tell them and then they would guide you to your seat. Their food is also very delicious . In my opinion, Bare Burger had the best burgers and fries in the world. Their freshly made fresh angus beef is the freshest as it can be! Just like their burgers, the fries are just impressive. For drinks they only serve pop like soda and root beer. Their scenery is also very nice. Their lamps are especially creative because when you look up you see lamps made out of forks and spoon. There is also a big moose and a big bear near the tables. The Bare Burger also has a pleasant odor so I suggest that Bare Burger place you'll enjoy.(Student Project)
2017-09-03,1,Ordered delivery from bareburger recently and ordered the American burger on a kale wrap with a side of half onion rings half fries. The burger and sides were delivered cold and the burger was on a regular bun when I even specified to have it made on a collared greens bun. The side also came with only THREE (3) small onion rings. For a $2 delivery fee and a messed up/cold order, would definitely would NOT recommend.
2017-08-29,2,Great food. Really bad costumer service. I stood up n went to the counter to get someone's attention . N when we were done with the meals I also stood up n asked if I could please get the check.
2017-08-27,5,Nice clean place, quick service and pleasant.  The onion rings delicious Panko crumbs and sauces for dipping. All the burgers were delicious, highly recommend the buckaroo burger with brisket mushrooms and BBQ sauce amazing combo with cheddar cheese.
2017-08-25,1,Got a salad to go there the other day and the lettuce was frozen. Absolutely disturbed and disgusted.
2017-08-23,3,Not the best burger I've had honestly. It was mediocre. The restaurant needs to hire more servers- as there was just one assisting the entire location. I do not think I will be going back to this place, but it was an okay experience.
2017-08-21,4,Great fried chicken sandwich, fries, and onion rings. But my friend was served a cold burger missing some toppings that were listed on the menu for that burger. I enjoyed my chicken sandwich and I thought the strawberry hibiscus ice tea was amazing!! Friendly service and cool decor/ambiance. Would give it another try. .
2017-08-20,3,I came over to the organic - straight from the farm - etc Bare burger for a low key late afternoon lunch. It's consistently been a great spot with a menu that I personally think is pretty innovativeOn this visit however, I noticed their cutlery looked a bit unclean and sure enough there was some left over food from the previous customer. That's not a good thing considering how many people get their kids here. They did change/ wipe it off once I pointed it out but it was still a bit unclean. I believe in recycled and saving the planet's water and soap. But gross leftovers? Not for me, thanks!
2017-08-16,2,Second time at a bareburger joint, but it was my first time at this location. Even though, the ratings were not that high I still decided to check it out for myself. Unfortunately, the service was very slow and the employees were not attentive at all. There were maybe four people in the restaurant and it took forever to get some utensils and napkins. Also, when we wanted to leave we had to wait a very long time for the check. I would suggest checking out their location in Montclair for a better bareburger experience.
2017-08-13,1,I used to love this place....my boyfriend usually orders delivery. However, last few months their quality has really gone down. My food arrives really cold, I'm very disappointed. Wish their was another organic burger joint close by :(
2017-08-01,5,This is a smaller Bare burger, but I have always gotten good service and quick food. I usually go at off peak hours as it can get crowded.
2017-07-28,2,Ordered a few months back and food arrived ice cold, soggy bun, and they messed up my order. I've been to the bare burger in edgewater and had a great experience and the food was delicious, so I guess it depends on the location.
2017-07-26,5,Cool organic food, Bacon is spectacular. The burgers are juicy, like the elk and duck
2017-07-11,5,Gluten free rolls, vegan cheese, and almost anything can be modified for allergies. The crispy Brussels sprouts are my favorite!
2017-07-05,4,Ordered off of Seamless on July 4th. Had read that the burgers here were some of the best in Hoboken. Built our own burgers:- Brioche, beef, tomato, american, stone ground mustard, ketchup, pickles - Brioche, beef, aged cheddar, green leaf, tomato, pickles, picked jalapeño, habanero mayo (very tasty although a little chewy. The habenero mayo was excellent and the brioche is legit soft)- Fries (ok - don't come great through delivery)- Onion rings (awesome and flavorful and crisp and loved them)It's not cheap and the burgers don't come with sides but the food was pretty good and the delivery packaging was ok.This is definitely a place that should probably be enjoyed in person rather than delivery. It comes a little cool and coming on July 4th the wait time, while advertised 45 minutes, was an hour and a half. That said it's up there as far as taste and quality and even better than Stewed Cow, Zacks and Jack and Co and I will definitely order from here again and hopefully visit in person.
2017-06-29,1,I've gotten take-out from here a few times before and usually do not encounter any problems, but today I decided to dine-in with my party and had a horrible experience. First I would like to note that when my group arrived, there were only a few patrons at the restaurant. My group waited about 40 minutes for our food to arrive, during which time the waitress did not come by once to refresh our drinks or check-in on us about our long wait. We all ordered vegetarian burgers by the way, so it wasn't because of food needing to be cooked well-done or anything of that sort. During this time, another group who came in about 5 minutes after us also grew impatient (they were waiting almost 40 minutes as well) and actually decided to just leave and go elsewhere. To add to the already terrible experience, one person in my party ordered a vegetarian wrap to take home when we had placed our order, and we found out after we finished our meal that the order had not even been placed. The waitress said it would come out in a "few minutes," well, fast forward to another 25-30 minute wait (during which time the waitress never came back to update us) and the hostess had to inform us that it was still "in process." My friend just got his money back and the waitress barely apologized. It's a shame because the food is great, but because of the horrible customer service, I will not be coming back to this establishment. If you must eat here, skip dining in and call ahead for take-out; save your tip money, it is not worth it at all!!!
2017-06-06,4,Word of advice - don't order delivery from here, or for any burger place for that matter. Things get soggy during delivery easily for stuff like this and it will ruin the experience. Go there and eat it fresh. Bareburger has always been a consistent experience. Great quality, nice variety of burgers (and chicken sandwiches!) and massive/delish onion rings. Also, love their ketchup and mustard offerings [sorry, might steal some packets for home cause they're so good]..
2017-05-31,5,This place closes at 10pm and my friends and I came at 9:30pm... so I am sorry for being one of those customers who come in last minute.However, the staff was still pretty friendly and nice considering that we came in so late! It was a bit visible that they weren't super excited to have a group of 5 come in right before closing, but our server was very amicable and attentive to our needs.We ordered our foods (I just got dessert because I wasn't too hungry). I tried a bit of my friends' burgers and all I can say is that the burger is pretty sizeable! The french fries were extremely delicious.SHAKES ARE A MUST. YOU MUST MUST GET A SHAKE.We ordered small ones, but even the "small" shakes were giant! And it tasted like it was made of a in-house, homemade type of ice cream.They used the same type of ice cream for the dessert I got (I think it was called the sammy) which was basically a big ice cream cookie sandwich. It was freaking delicious, by the way. Cookie was fresh and warm, and the ice cream was delicious.Can you tell I really liked their ice cream and shakes?Anywho, at the end, when we asked for our bill, they had told us that their system shut down and that we would be getting our meals for!!! free!!!!!!!But we felt bad and dished out all the cash we had on us anyway (even though it probably wasn't enough to cover the actual bill...) and left. Thank you for the awesome experience and wonderful service!!
2017-05-26,3,The food here is pretty good and a fantastic menu.  The staff is always very friendly and nice.  My kids love it the most so we go here whenever they get to choose a place.  I also appreciate the whole idea of humane, healthy eating.  And for veggie options, I love their veggie burgers.However, not once has there not been a mistake with our order.  Either they forget someone's order  completely, put cheese on the "no cheese" burger orders, bring one person's meal out while everyone else is waiting over 20 minutes for theirs...there is always something that goes wrong.  And they do have a tendency to burn things, esp the sweet fries which we stopped ordering because they were always black and burned.  And we rarely order delivery any more because there was always something wrong with the orders and you're not in the restaurant to say something.  Occasionally the wait for food will be crazy long for no apparent reason and sometimes they show up with a burger in like one minute.We will still go there because we still like the food, but because of these constant mess-ups, they only  get 3 stars.
2017-05-23,5,I am a vegetarian so I always build my own veggie burger. I have had every single one you can possibly have and they are all amazing. I LOVE the vegan cheese! So good! Prices are great and the options are awesome.
2017-05-07,4,Ex: Really great to come here as a vegan. The food was delicious even though it was a tad bit pricey. Great vegan menu, all the ingredients were fresh. Even the water tasted amazing. Planning on coming back here again
2017-04-07,5,This place is great for those of you on a Paleo or Whole 30 diet and also to eat with non Whole 30ers. I ordered a bison burger wrapped in collard greens with a bunch of great veggie toppings and a side of guacamole. There is of course a ton of other delicious foods offered here for those of you who are not following any paleo plan.
2017-03-30,5,This is the best place for organic burgers, you can build your burger and I love my burgers with alfalfa, and they look and taste healthy. The best part is that my burgers never dripped and there was little to no grease. The banana milkshake was A star!
2017-03-28,5,love this place! the waitstaff is very friendly and attentive. i got the el matador burger and it was so good, i've been craving it ever since!
2017-03-27,5,They have this one shake here called the Cococado... UNREAL! Highly recommend
2017-03-26,5,Serves various unique burgers (think bison, hog) as well as classic beef burgers. I got the Waka (i think) burger but substituted hog with beef - it was the best burger I had in Hoboken (with Ainsworth and O'Niels 2nd/3rd). What's unique here is that the burgers are not dripping with grease but still have a great savory taste. Also had a an organic shake which was amazing - think real ice cream with real ingredients served in a metal blender cup with glasses on the side. Also, I've heard things about the waitstaff here but ours was honestly great.
2017-03-23,5,This place was great! I live near the area so it's easy to get to. The interior had a cool vibe and the waiter was extremely friendly and helpful with first time customers! My boyfriend and I went just in time before it closed. We shared Macho fries which were delicious and perfect since the burgers do not come with fries. I ordered a standard burger and he ordered a supreme burger. To top it off we shared a baked Sammie which was perfect after such a good meal. My boyfriend loved the burger and claims it was one of the best he's had, and trust me he's had a lot! We will be coming back!
2017-03-21,3,Absolutely delicious, fresh food. I love all of their innovative burger combinations, and the buffalo chicken sandwich is delicious. The shakes are a must-try - I usually get chocolate with peanut butter mixed in. HOWEVER, if you are ordering deliver, be aware that the "large" salads are ridiculously small!!! I got the large collard ceasar with grilled chicken, and I think the chicken was bigger than the salad!
2017-03-19,5,This place is great. The food is awesome, the menu is pretty diverse, the service is fantastic (thanks, Nathalie!), and the atmosphere is really welcoming. Can't wait to come back!
2017-03-14,4,First up...fantastic service! the server was lovely and gave us separate checks since we were on a work lunch.The burger selection is truly all inclusive and caters to every food enthusiast - from a tree hugger to a complete carnivore. On our table itself we had folks eating pork, beef, bean and fava burgers. I tried the 'Guadalupe' which is the black bean burger on a sprout bun. The taste was fantastic... the only thing missing was maybe a bit of a kick which i made up with the hot mustard condiment. I tried a jalapeno popper from a friend's plate and it was delicious.I am going again for sure!
2017-02-25,5,Although a bit expensive, possibly the best burger my wife and I have ever had. We both were not quite adventurous enough to stray from good old beef, but my son had the bison burger and liked it.We also had the fries and onion rings. The onion rings were not greasy and very very good. The fries were also top notch.We went on Presidents Day, and the place was very busy. Be prepared to wait, but it really is worth it. Definitely on another level when compared to the other chains popular in the area. They can't hold a bun up to Bareburger, plus it is a NYC company, making it even better. We need one in Northern Bergen County!
2017-02-21,4,Some of the best burgers and salads I've ever had... amazing decor and nice staff too!The only reason they don't get five stars is because they messed up my order a couple times. Specifically, when you order an item with no bacon and then they bring it out with double bacon....It's a bit pricey, you'll be paying Manhattan prices...Still, this is one of my favorite places!
2017-02-15,1,Sadly, since my last review, the customer service for this establishment has gone down hill. Since changing from their old app, ordering from Bareburger Hoboken has been a disaster. There is no option for extra protein, they always assume it is pick-up even when you denote "DELIVERY", and the food is cold. If you call them, the staff could not care less. Too bad since this used to be my favorite place in Hoboken to order (2-3x/week).
2017-02-15,1,Food is good, but service is AWFUL.Waitstaff has tons of attitude.  On a particularly cold and windy night, they wanted to seat 4 of us in the table by the front door.  We asked to sit further back, and they said no even though there were multiple 2 tops available.  We asked to push 2 together and they said with a lot of attitude "No, we don't do that here."  Wait, what?  You don't accommodate customers?  I've seen that done before.  So, we left.Another time, we couldn't get the attention of our waitress.  She hung out in the thin hallway between the bathrooms and dining rooms.  Never once did she stop by to check on our food, whether during appetizers or main course.  Getting the check was tough.  Overall, I like the food, but won't return to this location.
2017-02-12,5,I've never spent such a short amount of time at a restaurant as I have in this one. Not saying that it was a bad experience, but my visit felt like a blur (or maybe I was having too much fun and didn't want it to end). Friday night and the place was pretty busy, but we were quickly seated. Waitress was very attentive and friendly. I don't remember what burger I ordered exactly, but I do remember clearing my whole plate :) . One burger was a personalized one and the other was a turkey (I think) with a side of mixed regular and sweet potato fries. Overall, a nice hip place perfect for a friend/date night out.
2017-01-29,5,Went here for a quick meal and fell in love!We were taken care of immediately and had the sweetest waitress, Kailen. Before we ordered she asked if my boyfriend and I had any food allergies. As someone with celiac disease, this is so relieving. There menu does state that they don't recommend their food for celiacs, but that's for legal reasons. I had the beef burger with a tapioca rice bun, pickles, and caramelized onions. I should've added more, but besides that- it was so tasty! Two different people checked to make sure we were content and asked if we need anything else. They were efficient with the check and grateful for our business. Would definitely return!
2017-01-16,2,I like bareburger and I think they make great food BUT this Hoboken location has the worst service. While on the surface they appear to have the same friendly and helpful service of other bareburgers, they always seem to get orders wrong and the servers tend to have attitudes when you question your food they got wrong. My daughter order a burger with no cheese or sauce and it came back with the sauce on it and when she questioned why it had cheese, the server dismissively said it's sauce and walked away!On another not don't order the lemonade, the pipes are dirty and it taste sour.
2017-01-03,3,Its ok.  High price tag for the burgers.  Not completely satisfying. Some days it has been good.  Other days not tasty.  I stop eating here often.  Like 2-3 stars
2017-01-03,4,Whoever is responsible for designing Bareburger restaurants does an amazing job.  They are always unique, rustic, comfortable.  The food is tasty and consistent, and my favorite is the buttermilk buffalo chicken sandwich, wrapped in a collard green instead of a bun.  However, I do think the food is a bit overpriced.  Burgers can cost up to $13 and the sides are very small.  The rings & fries combo tend to come with about 4 rings - I understand the rings are big but come on, that's stingy.
2016-12-13,4,We were searching for burgers in Hoboken when we came across this place. Bareburger has a very eclectic menu - everything is organic and sustainable, which makes you feel a little bit better about eating at a burger joint. Our server recommended the onion rings, so we ordered the rings & fries as an appetizer. I have never been a huge fan of onion rings, but these were amazing! They came with a bunch of different sauces - we didn't really like the curry ginger ketchup, but their 'special sauce' and habanero mayo were great. My boyfriend built his own burger. There are so many different options to customize your order with, which was nice. I got the Buttermilk Buffalo Chicken Sandwich which was delicious. I would definitely go again to try the other items on the menu.
2016-12-12,4,First time at the Hoboken location! Bareburger is and has always been one of my favorites. I wish that there was one closer to me in JC, but for now the Hoboken location will have to do. Ironically enough I almost never order a burger. Their fried chicken is just way too good. I usually order the chicken on a sammie or keep things really simple and order the chicken fingers. This time I went with an order of the fingers. Although the price tag is a bit high for chicken fingers (12 dollars) the basket comes with enough to feed two people and a trio of dipping sauces - BBQ, ranch and horseradish. The chicken fingers are always extra crispy and golden fried to perfection. To drink I went with a strawberry lemonade. It was sweet and delicious and came in an enormous glass.  Bareburger never lets me down. The service is always pleasant and the food is consistently fresh and delicious. Between salads, sandwiches, burgers and sides there are plenty of options on the menu to satisfy all. I was here with a vegetarian who was overwhelmed by their veggie options, which is saying alot for a burger joint! If you have never tried Bareburger before then definitely make it a point to.
2016-12-03,5,Delicious organic food. A bit pricey to eat every week but definitely a nice place to go out on dates.
2016-11-30,3,Had the sriracha Brussels sprout app, pretty good. Also got a turkey burger & beef burger both very flavorful, nothing screams must go back but wouldn't not go back.
2016-11-15,4,Did take out from here, but the honey chicken sandwich was amazing!! Service was great too. $10 is on the pricier side for a sandwich but ingredients were fresh and tasty.
2016-11-15,2,Declined substantially since it opened with such fanfare.  Nice menu but the food doesn't begin to measure up. Much better burger-type food elsewhere in Hoboken.  They could also consider the weather outside.  Very cold in there in the winter months, with no provision for the comforts of the diners.
2016-10-31,5,Love this place! Great service and delicious, fresh food! A favorite go to spot for my girlfriend and I for lunch. Keep up the great work! I am obsessed with their buffalo chicken sandwich and their macho fries. Can seem a little pricey if you customize your own burger but their ingredients are always fresh so it's worth the money. Never been disappointed with this place.
2016-10-29,1,Terrible service. Food is only ok. What service is that when the waitress doesn't check that the order she put in came fully to the table ? Burger came without the additions we order. Side orders didn't come. Appetizers came after we finish main dish !!! The kids orders came cold and food is just OK nothing special and never again.
2016-10-15,4,The ambience is good. It's a great place to hang out.Their Duck Burger; Angry Quacker, is pretty nice, I would recommend it.They have a mexican chocolate milk shake; it is spicy. It was a very unusual flavor, I would not recommend it.Serving size is not that big, so you should order sides.Staff was nice and polite. The first thing our server told us was that the food is organic and asked us about any allergies we have.
2016-10-08,4,PROS:1) BYOB2) You can bring your dog ... and they give them a water bowl =) So cute/nice3) the food insane... love the regular cheeseburger here with Pimiento cheese....CONS:1) sometimes a long wait2) organic ketchup sucks3) so I must bring my own ketchup in my purse lolI know when I come here w/ my ketchup in my purse it is going to be a good dining experience... w/ solid food....and my pup is by my side =)
2016-10-02,4,My husband and I love bare burger! Whenever we go and sit down Everyone is super friendly and the service is great. The only reason why I am not giving five stars is because of the delivery service. Every time we order delivery, it's over an hour for the food, every single time. This past time, they claimed hey never got our order however two employees lies and said it was out for delivery when it clearly wasn't. I would haveapprecisted a "I'm sorry we didn't see it and are making it right now" over the two lies. I just wish bare burger would up the delivery service.
2016-10-02,2,My husband & I really wanted to like this place. We've been to a Bareburger in Manhattan & really enjoyed their food and service.Unfortunately this place didn't cut it. We were seated at around 8pm. Our waitress didn't take our order till 25 min later. When we did order our food, we had to wait another 20 min to receive it. People who came in AFTER us received their food first.  The only reason for the 2 stars is because the waitress was nice enough and the food was okay and there was different options of meat on the menu. Next time we crave for a good burger we'll take-out!
2016-10-02,4,So many gluten free options! Stick with beef burger or bison. DO NOT ORDER TURKEY - ugh!! Other than that though, good quality food, pleasant atmosphere. The toppings so add up fast $$$. Love the retro eclectic music and vintage cartoons!
2016-09-17,5,Went here with two colleagues of mine for lunch. Awesome spot. Had the Buckaroo Burger. Beef patty with mushrooms, brisket and their house smoke sauce. Excellent. Check these guys out.
2016-09-10,4,With an eclectic mix of flavor and style, your walking into an exceptional meal choice. With a good mix of healthy options and hearty burgers, not to mention some bomb shakes, you'll make the right choice by coming here. Ask for Cynthia, Julie, or Raf they'll hold you down, no doubt!
2016-09-08,2,Burger tasted fine but was really small, I cut in half to eat it and each half was about 2 full bites. Fries were mediocre. Waitress brought out wrong food and then brought extra fries that I didnt order. So my friend got a burger, I got a burger, we split sweet potato fries, and had tap water to drink. $38.93 bill after tip. Not even close to worth it. As a side note - I made that burger pay dearly for its audacity to appear on my plate. It was decent tasting, nothing great, but it suffered very violent consquence for its mistake.
2016-09-06,4,The Elk burger was very tasty, not sure to much if it was the sauce or the burger itself. Anyway, the kimchi was a bit young; could of used another week or so to ferment. Overall, not bad for the price. Will come again.
2016-08-27,3,Food is always good, but often times I find they mess up the order. Almost every time I've gone something is wrong in my order or the service is extremely slow. The only thing that keeps me coming back is the food.
2016-08-16,4,I was a bare burger virgin until now! Our server was great & patient & explained everything to me about the menu & options. I went with one of the specials, and it was amazing! Service was prompt, professional & personable! Only downside was that they had no bar lol, I would've stayed longer if I could've had a beer with my burger
2016-08-01,5,I've had a lot of craft burgers but this is hands down the best I've ever had. I highly recommend the sesame ginger beef and the service was also completely awesome. Great food, extremely friendly waiter, you can't go wrong.
2016-07-29,5,I loved this place.  Grass-fed organic ground fresh beef. Not that I eat meat, but I don't trust ground meat processing in the US and so I refuse to let my husband eat burgers out anymore.  I know, it's tough living with a vegetarian. He found this place so HE could eat a burger and that I could eat a vegetarian burger.It gets better.  At Bareburger, I had a choice of 3 different types of vegetarian burger patties.  Um.. What?   When the f*** does that ever happen? I can tell you based on 30 years of non-meat eating, it never happens. It gets even better. I could pick from a CHOICE of burger patties, and a CHOICE of buns, and a CHOICE of all kinds of yummy toppings.  I had a sprouted grain roll.  Yes folks that is what I said - a sprouted grain roll.  Again, when do you see that on a menu?  But don't worry if you want a delicious regular hamburger roll you can get that too.. which is what the hubby eats.   I had sprouts, spinach, jalapeno peppers and spicy spread.  I skipped this cheese but looking back I should just have gone for it. YOLO.Desert.  Liquored up cherries on a ice cream. I'm just going to leave that to your imagination. It's that good. For the adventurous meat eaters they have things like bison and elk on the menu.
2016-07-25,5,Me and my family came in the other day and I can't imagine having better service and food. Lara our server was incredibly helpful because I have a gluten allergy and she made sure to meet all my needs, and what you think would be just not another burger joint wasn't the food was very tasty and my burger was cooked to the exact temperature I requested.... you will see us their again very soon.
2016-07-24,2,We ordered a burger and a chicken sandwich, and neither had any flavor. Service was prompt and polite, but if we hadn't ordered sides of horseradish etc. it would've been like eating white bread. We ordered fries well done, and they were so undercooked they were limp.Tried, failed. Next.
2016-07-23,5,Wow is all I have to say....amazing service and very professional manager staff, I got the build your own with bison, duck bacon, and all the fixings.  The entire dish was soooo much better than expected.  I highly recommend going here for a quick bite or a nice dinner (great ambiance). Hopefully the manager Jared is there he gave us exceptional service that is rare in this industry, we need more people like this in the world.  Btw Lara was our waitress she was bubbly with an amazing personality as well.  Thank you bareburger I will 100% be back again!!!!
2016-07-23,5,We have been here on and off since it opened and it has been consistently good service and great food. The brunch is pretty amazing too.
2016-07-20,1,There are great workers at this specific bareburger that I have witnessed and I had the pleasure to speak to being a regular. I recently went to eat and wanted to speak to the manager about the timing on my food. When asked for the manager (Ahmed) he was no where to be found.My server was kind enough to keep trying to look for him, even trying to call him from the restaurant phone. I left before he even arrived .As a manager I believe you should always be on top of your restaurant instead of going to hang out on Washington street. This was extremely unprofessional and rude.
2016-07-18,2,This used to be our favorite drool over your amazing burger place...Sadly the past two times we've ordered our burgers have been seriously dry and disappointing, not to mention it was much smaller than usual! not quite sure what's going on there but this is truly sad...may take us a while to talk ourselves into ordering again :( sad to lose our go to burger spot
2016-07-08,2,First let me start by saying I love BareBurger and have been at 3 other ones other than this one.  I went here about a week ago and finally ordered food by 6:00 pm.  The staff was friendly, professional and responsive, but I waited until 7:10 pm to ask if my food was on its way.  The response was that yes it was, but that they're backed up.  Then some other employee came and asked if there was anything I want, I said yes, my food.  The employee seemed confused as to my answer and said oh ok.  While there I witnessed two other tables receive their food before I did and they came in after me.  Shortly after I asked the employee at 7:10 where my food was, the food came out promptly.  The food seemed undercooked, greasy, needless to say my stomach was uncomfortable after this meal.My belief was that I didn't get my food cooked until I had asked for the status at 7:10, and then it was rushed for quickness.I don't think I will be coming back here for a very long time.
2016-07-06,3,I usually wait to write a review for a place after I've visited at least 1-2 times. However, I have no intentions on coming back.My bf, friend and I stopped by on July 4th. I was craving a burger (which is very rare--no pun intended). I ordered a Supreme (medium well), my bf ordered the Southern Caviar (well done), and my friend ordered the Collard Green burger (well done). They also ordered sides of pickles and fries. We all ordered strawberry lemonades.They brought out our lemonades first (they were really nice and tart). However, it took over 30 minutes to get over food. I mean really? For burgers?! Our server (Andrew) didn't even have the courtesy to come over and give an update. He kept passing the table until we stopped him to ask how much longer our food would be .When the food finally came out, it was good (fries were blah). But, it definitely wasn't worth a 30 minute+ wait. Andrew's service continued to be inattentive. We had get his attention while he was SITTING at the bar in the back chatting, just so that we could ask for refills. After we ate, we were still hungry and craving buffalo wings! Call us greedy! I don't know.
2016-07-05,3,I went for the first time last Saturday and had researched that their Bison Burger was rated #1 in NJ last year. As a burger junkie, I was excited to find that I could find this type of quality right near my house. The staff was super cool and helpful and the vibe of the place was chill. The selection of burgers and menu options were plenty.I ended up ordering the Bison burger (El Matador), with french fries and onion rings, and a white peace iced tea. For starters, the white peach iced tea was so refreshing and the onion rings were some of the best I ever had (although I don't often eat them). As for the burger, I was quite disappointed for a few reasons. There was far more bread than there was burger which is a burger "no-no". I have seen pictures for this restaurant that shows these huge burgers but mine was nothing like that. I was still hungry after eating mine and had to remove a ton of bread to get a taste of the burger. The burger was supposed to be medium and was probably medium well, which for a bison burger, really makes a difference. Overall, I was disappointed with my burger. It was certainly not even close to a #1 burger. It was very forgettable. Also, I asked for some of their special sauces for dipping and they told me I'd have to pay extra for it. This is strange considering I paid almost $13 bucks for a miniature burger. I don't mind paying good money for a burger but I want to make sure I get great value. Unfortunately I did not get it here. I am not sure if I will be returning.
2016-06-24,1,The food is always really good... But the delivery service is certainly not. Every single time we order from here it takes close to an hour and a half for the food to arrive... I understand certain days and times are busier than others, but considering this is a franchise, I'd expect a bit more efficiency and timeliness. One time I ordered a root beer float and 1) it wasn't anything like the product description... 2) It was actually kind of disgusting (a half filled ... to-go cup... with flat soda and another cup with melted, soft ice cream)... 3) It was nothing at all like the same order I received when eating in the restaurant (boylan's blottled soda and hard scooped ice cream).I'm currently waiting for my delivery and just called the restaurant. I got their voicemail two times in a row and then got a message their voicemail was full...it's already been an hour and 15 mins...We've given bareburger so many chances because we love their food, but paying for this kind of service is getting old and we've realized it's not worth it anymore... Really think the place is just mismanaged and needs better staff...SEE YA BAREBURGER HOBOKEN
2016-06-16,1,The turkey burger is a frozen, processed patty.  It was so gross that my friend and I both threw our food in the garbage.  Neither of us will ever eat here again. If you like frozen food on par with low-grade high school cafeteria eats, then this is your place.
2016-06-05,1,This place deserves one star only because the service was as satisfactory as could be CONSIDERING THAT THERE WAS A LIVE WORM IN MY GIRLFRIENDS FOOD!! Although they did take the food that had the worm off the bill I left disgusted and will most likely never go there again. I ordered the bison burger and it was decent. If you do decide to eat here make sure you check your food before indulging.
2016-06-01,5,Nice food and organic. Its hard to find organic around here. Staff is so friendly waitress are nice and service is great. Will def come back. My son enjoyed the burger
2016-06-01,2,The service is SO BAD. The food is good but overpriced (yes, I'm aware that organic costs more). I will NOT go back here because the service really is that bad.  I used to love Bareburger but the service at all of the NJ locations are horrendous.
2016-05-31,3,Nice place and nice staff but I didn't think the burger was all that great. I got the "Standard" burger and the meat was a little tough. It might not have a lot of fat in it, but I'm not sure. Onion rings were good. Indifferent on the place.
2016-05-30,3,Pros: Lots of options for building your own burger, gluten free friendly for those with celiac, vegan friendly, food tastes very fresh, and decent atmosphere. Cons: The seating was a bit uncomfortable, water was not cold, service was meh, and a bit overpriced for the portions that you get compared to similar restaurants. Overall it was not bad.
2016-05-28,4,Great place to eat if some of your party are vegetarians, good options for everyone! I had the make your own burger with Wild Boar, manchego cheese, onions and fig jam on a brioche bun. It was delicious.
2016-05-22,2,Unfortunately we won't be back to Bareburger. The portions seemed much MUCH smaller- definitely not worth a $13 burger. My boyfriend got the Havana brisket sandwich and said it was one of the worst things he's ever eaten. Sorry to say Bareburger has gone downhill.
2016-04-26,4,One of the best burger spots in town. We've eaten inside a few times and also ordered delivery. Small place and usually a wait on weekends. Onion rings are amazing!
2016-04-20,3,Every time I come here, I just get a little more disappointed than the last. I love the fact that it is BYOB, and the waitstaff is always great (especially for Hoboken), but the food is always lacking for one reason or another. The chicken tenders here are always overcooked, almost to the point of being burnt. I'm not sure if it's due to the fact that they're thin, or the kid behind the fryolator just cant handle the heat. The sides are OK - I really like the onion rings which are thick and crispy, with breading not batter, but the regular and sweet fries are kinda meh. My sweet fries have always come soggy. Now as for the burgers - these are always hit or miss with me. I have had more than one experience here where my burger was soggy, or the patty was falling apart. I like the variety and options that they give you, but even when you go with one of their recommended styles, I've had my burger be either bland, mushy, or just plain undesirable. They always are tasty though.... I never said the burger wasnt tasty...
2016-04-17,2,Ordered delivery.  It took over an hour and a half, twice the delivery time and the food arrived completely cold and soggy.  My soda was also 1/4 emptied by the time it arrived to me. Disappointing for the price and that the burger probably would have been good.
2016-04-17,5,I ordered a duck burger and that was awesome!!! Also you can choose to make your own burger. A little bit expensive for a burger but it's worthy to try!
2016-04-15,4,I got a build-it-yourself burger, and brussel sprouts to go - loved it !  I'd like to come back again soon to dine-in and BYOB. If I could change one thing, it would be the prices. Before I knew it, my burger + side + drink turned out to be $24, yikes.
2016-04-12,2,Like so many places in Hoboken that start off really strong with great food and service, at some point, standards start to drop and cracks in the facade begin to appear. This is happening with Bareburger. This evening I ordered and repeatedly asked - five times in fact and joked about it cause it sounded insane - a burger without smoke sauce. I explained the person I was eating with absolutely hates condiments of any kind and he won't eat it if it's on. The young woman on the phone repeatedly assured me there would be none. So it arrives and low and behold the burger is covered in the sauce. It took almost an hour to arrive and I'm embarrassed because my friend has nothing to eat. So I call the restaurant and the same woman answers and I ask her if she's been the only one taking orders this evening. She says no. OK, fine but it's her same voice. I explain to her the situation and she says it's a kitchen mistake. She can send another in 45 minutes to an hour. I've just paid close to $50 for two hamburgers, large fries and one soft drink. It's just not good enough for that price. I asked to speak to the manager and she says she's not there (classic move). My point is mistakes happen yes but to gloss over it and dismiss it when some is paying a fairly stupid amount of money for glorified fast food - well, it's infuriating. I have a vague notion Bareburger won't be the burger darling of Hoboken for all that long.
2016-04-08,3,Good burgers, their vegetarian items are average at best. The highlight of the meal were the onion rings. Probably would have gotten four stars but customer service was lacking. Kind of pricey too but understandable since it is organic.
2016-04-05,5,This is probably the best burgers I have ever had...  chicken fingers are so-so, but who cares?  Only downside is that it is expensive, but you def get what you pay for!
2016-04-02,4,Decided I wanted to get a delicious burger so I tried this place out with my boyfriend and his parents. When I walked in I initially was pleased with the appearance. There are amazing light fixtures created out of forks, exposed brick walls (perfectly repointed) and the HVAC system is exposed which is beautiful as well. As for the food, very delicious. I got a create your own burger and fried pickles. I totally recommend any kind of burger on the menu
2016-03-24,5,Best burger in town!!! Ordered for delivery and order came within 20 minutes. Great service over the phone...so kind and nice!
2016-03-23,1,This is usually my go to spot for good healthy-ish delivery in Hoboken BUT I just received  my delivery which usually comes in under 40 tonight it was pushing 55 minutes.... (Understandable it might be busy) I was SO excited about the new menu items on seamless so I ordered the Cali BTL & sweet potato fries, the fries & the bread were so so soggy & the sandwich was just thrown together, the bread wasn't even toasted, the bacon was barely cooked AND they forgot the avocado. It's a sad day
2016-03-05,4,I like this place. It's BYOB so make sure to grab some beer or wine before coming in. Mostly anything can be customized to your liking and the staff is very accommodating. Ordered the ice cream sandwiches togo the last time and were disappointed to see they were store bought and re-sold to us. Otherwise great spot in Hoboken to go to for more than just burgers.
2016-02-21,4,While I don't eat read meat or bread ... I can still be trusted to give reviews ... I swear. Stopped by Bareburger with my two monsters to have brunch on a Saturday afternoon. I had this Guadalajara "burger" wrapped in collards and a mix of sweet fries and onion rings. The kids had mini cheese burgers and fries. We were satisfied. No complaints. The wait was about 25 min which with two hungry kids it made it seem like 2 hours. I really liked that I could choose my options for everything from the meat to bread. Solid place!
2016-02-20,4,Give credit to Bareburger's customer service -- they immediately contacted me after my last review to invite me back to the restaurant for another try.  This time, my girlfriend and I had a very pleasant experience with a good server and good food.  Tip: we went on a weekday so as to avoid the Friday/Saturday crowds, and this seemed to help as well.
2016-02-17,5,Wasn't sure what to expect.  The burgers were excellent but a bit unusual.  You can choose some unusual burgers - I opted for their Bare Elk Burger - very good choice.  Also enjoyed the onion rings and fries - dipping sauces were excellent.   The salads are also good.  Long wait but that is to be expected.
2016-02-15,4,It's really hard to find a good burger in Hoboken and although this isn't my favorite burger joint, it is my go to when I'm craving a burger in Hoboken.I love that this place has options. You can get a burger, sandwich, salad, and they even have a dessert menu with a variety of shakes and ice cream sandwiches.For the burgers you can make your own or pick a specialty burgers. I love the variety of patties (beef, elk, bison, vegetarian) and variety of unique toppings (pineapple relish, tomato jam, chickpea onions)Here is what we tried -Wiki wiki with wild boar, Gouda, duck bacon, chick pea onion, and pineapple relish. Great combination of flavor a that compliment one another. The patties was juicy, the onions added a nice crunch, and the pineapple added a hint of sweetness. GET IT-blue elk is topped with country bacon, stout onions and tomato fig jam. The elk was gamey and didn't have much flavor. The blue cheese and bacon added a much needed kick but still wasn't enough to make up for the lack of flavor of the elk. SKIP IT -snicker doodle Sammie is amazing!!!!! Carmel ice cream between two snicker doodle cookies topped with caramel sauce. The cookies are soft, the ice cream is the perfect creamy consistency and the sauce has the perfect pinch of sea daily. GOTTA HAVE IT!
2016-02-08,5,You can never go wrong when you order from this place. Every thing I ordered was great and very tasteful. I couldn't be happier.
2016-02-04,4,very creative burgers with delicious pairings.   Big fan of he blue elk burgers.    i'd give it 5 stars except the sides are weak.   The fries, carrot slaw and onion rings are all average.
2016-02-01,4,Bareburger food is so good! I love how you can pick various different types of meat, sauces, and condiments for your burger. Basically, bareburger is  your specialty craft burger shop that can run you up to spending 15-20 dollars per burger, depending on what you order.I had the elk meat and built my own burger. However, I love to get the preset burgers. The French fries here are good too, and the service is fast. Waiters take the order on ipads. I feel that this place is for people that want to try healthy and specialty burgers. But the portions are kind of small for the price you pay, so...do not expect a huge portion.Oh and it's BYOB!! Which is a plus!
2016-01-29,5,Yum! We popped in here for take out after the gym to try it for the first time. They estimated 25 minutes but the food didn't take that long and the people who work there are really nice. I ordered the black bean burger and a ginger lime iced tea. The burger was great and the pickled onions were on point. I will probably ask for extra pickled onions next time. The iced tea was very yummy and refreshing The man ordered the southern caviar burger and the onion rings. He said both were awesome-especially the onion rings.
2016-01-23,3,not as good as other bare burgers Ive been to. The one in astoria had me excited about it, but this one just missed the mark.
2016-01-07,3,Bareburger toots its multiple chains across New York and now has a place in Hoboken! I came here by myself on a Sunday lunch after spending some time writing. I guess I had different expectations for what a burger joint was supposed to be like ... FOOD: Per yelp's help, I got the bison burger + duck bacon + salad. The burger itself was smaller portion that I had expected, but itself was not bad! The duck bacon though, for that extra price, sadly, I found it not really that superior to justify the extra price charge. Maybe a mismatch of expectations, but I found myself wanting something else. The side salad was alright, nothing too special. SERVICE: A little odd as I was moved from table to another table due to some lack of planning of seating arrangements right as I was going to order. I also found it a bit slow too, but alas, it beats being rushed out the door. Line built up as I finished my meal, so come early to avoid the wait as usual!
2016-01-03,2,Ordered turkey burger and onion rings. Rings were burnt and turkey was so dry I wasn't even sure it was turkey. It was also a 30 minute wait for take out. Won't be ordering again.
2015-12-27,5,A very unique place my friends and I found on a quick trip to the area. The servers were all nice and friendly. The selection was perfect, I decided to get the Wiki Wiki burger and was very satisfied with my decision. The duck bacon and gouda cheese on my wild boar patty was amazing. The portions were perfect. I was full and could actual pick up the burger and eat it, no mess. We also got a side of fries and were given their special ketchup and another dipping sauce. I would definitely go back to this restaurant if I ever found my self in the area again.
2015-12-27,4,Howdie yall! I came here after a 30 hour flu with no fixins in me and boy was I starvin! Everything on the menu from the bunz, to the sauces , to the bread is very clean and organic so that was nice. I must say the only thing I wasn't fond of was the ketchup that stuff was not fingerlickin! We got he sweet potato fries and build ya own burger I would recommend the elmadador and it was yeehaw we good! (Couldn't eat the wild boar because I am a boar, oink!)
2015-12-08,5,Best burger in nj.  Always cooked perfect and holds up on delivery.  Love this place.
2015-12-07,4,Bareburger is the perfect place to go to try unique burgers.  They have about 10 different pre made specialty burgers and a build your own option.  We really liked that they had several different types of meat available such as bison and elk.  They also have a few vegetarian burger options - black bean and sweet potato.  Location in Hoboken is BYOB.  Atmosphere is casual, but still modern and enjoyable. Good service!Would definitely return again.
2015-12-06,2,Just had a turkey burger here and it was not good at all. I have eaten at other locations and they were actually good!  My favorite is the one in Boulder Colorado. We tried this place 2 times because I couldn't believe it wouldn't be good. My turkey burger tasted like a rubber patty and I ordered mushrooms and onions on it and there were hardy any on it!!!  The fries were warm, but soggy. Really?!? How can you serve soggy fries?? The only reason I gave 2 stars is because I like the decor and the service was good. Do yourself a favor and go to another bareburger location.
2015-11-28,2,Horrible experience and I went a couple times to only be let down once again. This is long winded but I have to explain how ridiculous this is and I wish it wasn't because I love the concept of this restaurant.First time I went - my fiancé and I each order a burger - we have been to the ones in the city so we know what to expect and really like the Nyc locations.So we order food and wait and wait and realize everyone around has ordered and is done eating before we even get our food. We don't see the waiter for really long because he is talking to a table for over ten minutes, finally we tell the waiter and right away comes the food except it's ice cold- no exaggeration it was cold- the waiter apologizes and brings out two new hot burgers. He then comps the meal saying it was a mixup and won't happen again- so we forgive the place because anyone can have a bad night Now for the second experience- same thing we order our burgers except this time the waiter is being a little rude and seems very overwhelmed. But it's a burger place u don't go for the great service so we don't really care- I order my burger medium - it comes out raw- not rare bc I eat rare - I mean totally raw in the middle - I took a couple bites on the outside of the burger keep in mind before I get to the middle and realize how raw- (side note both times fries sucked completely soggy) you would think a burger place can get temperature right - I show the waiter he seems really understanding and says he will fix this.So I get my "new" burger - they took the partially bitten meat and threw it back on the grill and put that meat on a new bun. To me, that's disgusting so the food I chewed is on the grill with other burgers. I refused to eat the burger from that point and asked for the check and once again the waiter comps my burger but at this point it's over no amount of comps can make up for those mistakes You pay a premium at this place so you expect better quality and higher standards then u would at a fast food restaurant but this location honestly is horrible - I really hope they can turn it around bc I would be a regular customer
2015-11-11,5,Just ate a Southern Caviar burger... WOW!Switched to duck bacon and it was amazing. Juicy and flavorful and I will eat here again. Don't second guess yourself... eat bison.
2015-11-04,5,My first experience at Bareburger was frequenting the one on 2nd Ave in NYC, before moving to Hoboken. Everything is always fresh at Bareburger, regardless of location. This one is no different. Unlike the Bareburgers in NYC, this Hoboken joint is BYOB. I find their salads to be ridiculously fresh and delicious, along with the dressings. The onion rings are my weakness here, but they are absolutely amazing. Any burger you order will be great. I love being able to try things like elk and bison (my two favorites) without breaking the bank. I wish they still had the lamb burger on the menu. You can't really go wrong with anything you order here, be it burgers, chicken sandwiches, salads, sides, sauces, or milkshakes.
2015-11-03,4,fresh, delicious, not greasy, great options, BYOBBig fan of the wiki wiki
2015-10-31,4,Okay considering we came here at almost closing time on Halloween this place gave us good service. I loved how the food was natural and organic. You could taste how clean and fresh it was even almost at closing time. They have a variety of different unique meat choices like elk and bison. I also saw duck bacon which was interesting. This place reminded me of this place called burgatory in Pittsburgh with the farm to table ingredients and the build your own burger style. However, all of the burgers are cooked at medium. Not usually how I liked to eat my burgers so I wish the waitress would have said this while we were ordering. Also the burgers to not come with a free side like other similar restaurants. This is why I did not give it 5 stars. This is also a BYOB restaurant which is cool. I would like to try it during normal hours so I don't feel as rushed.
2015-10-26,5,Worthy! The rustic homestead style decor of this hipster burger joint immediately conveys authenticity in its message of organic farm-reared food and it certainly delivers faithfully on this front.I ordered the 'Southern Caviar' bison burger, which with its country bacon worked well with the subtle kick of the horseradish remoulade. Together they reminded me of fresh breakfast farm food housed within the cosy confines of two soft and sweet layers of bread.To complement the main event, I ordered half rings and half fries. The rings were absolutely on point and could even contend for the best I've ever had with their crispy casing dotted with herbs, along with the soft and warm onion slice waiting inside. The fries on the other hand, although lightly garnished in visible salt crystals, were soft to the bite which wasn't incredibly satisfying for someone who prefers them crunchy. Paired with the Sir Kensington brand of ketchup and mustard, however, it was all very palatable: these sauces packed a punch with less sugar than the leading brandsSome small misses for me: having read others' reviews here beforehand, I was originally tempted by the grilled chicken; however before ordering, the waiter informed me they'd run out which was somewhat disappointing knowing that their business day had just started.The in-house lemonade was not so enjoyable as its bitter pungency was closer in taste to fermented ginger ale than a summery sweet and sour drink. Finally, even though I came for lunch at noon on a Thursday when there was plenty of seating available, and although polite and helpful with ordering, the waiting staff were laxed in their regularity of passing by the table.Despite these minor shortcomings, this is a thoroughly recommendable lunch place if you're looking for a healthier burger option in Hoboken.
2015-10-25,3,Good service inside. bad service for pickup. Waited an hour for a pickup order. Get the turkey burger
2015-10-14,5,If I don't have Bareburger once a week, it's an off week for me. Here's my order (most of the time): county fair burger, side sweet fries, side dill pickles. Let's start with the burger. The bison is out of this world. The meat comes medium, and although I usually prefer it to be on the rare side, I think it's cooked perfectly. I've also had the standard which comes with beef and the grindhouse which is elk. Equally delicious. Sweet potato fries are hit or miss with me. You know when you eat way too much of something and it haunts you to even think about it? That happened to me as a kid, so I've had to ease my way back into the sweet potato thing but these fries are honestly excellent. Now for my favorite part. I'm a pickle fanatic. Fried pickles, dill pickles, pickle spears, pickle chips. You name it. Anyway, these dill pickles are life changing. The best is when you get the sliced garlic left over in the container YES YES YES. Overall, great service for both dine-in and take out. Usually I hate when places post calories on the menu, but I feel a little better knowing that this food is organic, all natural, and good for you. My only complaint is the menu--it's a little hard to read because it's very faded.But still, 5 stars. Hats off to Bareburger.
2015-10-09,4,This wasn't my first visit to a Bareburger, but this was my first visit to a B-Y-O-B Bareburger!!! Not that the beer/wine at other Bareburger locations is expensive, in fact it's quite reasonable, but every place wins points for being BYO. The staff here was extra friendly on a Saturday, for an early dinner and the whole experience was very enjoyable. I'm normally a big burger fan, but the buffalo chicken sandwich was really calling my name. OH-MY was it fantastic! I think everyone was jealous at my table. It was also huge! The chicken was friend perfectly, topped with all of the right ingredients! As always, at Bareburger, the sides of fries with all the dipping sauces is a must.  This location is just like any other Bareburger with wood tables/booths and the wait staff ordering off iPods which always is really impressive to me.I'd definitely recommend this place, especially this location. And remember, bring your own wine/beer!!
2015-10-03,4,I had the Grindhouse elk burger and my wife had the Country Club bison burger. WOW! Delicious. My friend told me about it and loved it, so finally came and loved it too. Definitely coming back. Love that they are organic.
2015-09-25,5,Seated immediately at 7:30pm on a week night. 90s alternative rock playing. The servers and host were cheerful and someone even came over to give us their "onion schpeel" because they heard us talking about how many different types there were. An incredible variety of foods including plenty of vegan and gluten free options. I had a wild boar burger with Gouda cheese, duck bacon, fried onions, and horseradish remoulade. Holy moly, it was the best burger of my life. Each member of my party (one vegan gluten free) agreed. I'd give this place 6 stars if I could.
2015-09-21,3,I have been to Bareburger in NYC before and have had their bison burger.  I decided to try that again at this location and it was not as good.  Our wait was a long time on a Thursday evening but the staff was very apologetic for it.  It is BYOB so that is a plus.  I will come back but will go to my regular turkey or chicken burger.
2015-09-18,1,One star because these people are horrible business people and rude.  Won't deliver to 700 Grove despite the fact it is closer than many parts of Hoboken, and they were rude to boot.  Go to Toney Baloneys or O'Neils for a burger, at least those owners have half a brain.
2015-09-03,4,This particular Bareburger (Hoboken) is a BYOB, which I'm always a fan of, but I've been to one of the Bareburger's in Queens and that one served beer. I love bareburger! I'm a huge fan of this burger chain! The variety of semi-exotic meats is definitely something that separates it from a lot of the competition. Elk, bison, ostrich, duck, and more, in addition to beef, turkey, and chicken in a burger make this place very enjoyable for me personally. They have countless different toppings, vegetables, cheeses, and their own homemade sauces. They serve most of their standard burgers on a brioche bun, but they also have a sprout bun, collard greens wrap, and a tapioca rice bun, The first time I ate here I had the wiki wiki, which was a bison burger with duck bacon, delicious! The last time I ate here I built my own. I went with the elk burger, pepper jack cheese, spinach, and habanero mayo all on a sprout bun. Although not as tasty as the wiki wiki, I think I enjoyed the elk burger a little more and was also pretty darn good! Right now, this is definately my favorite burger spot!
2015-08-31,2,To be fair I cannot review bareburger because I've only had the root beer float. It was iight
2015-08-27,4,Revisited this restaurant last week and was happier with my experience, not to say i wasn't happy the first time. Had the supreme burger which was very good and the half and half of regular and sweet potato french fries were very good and not as greasy as first time. Service was good and place is nice and inviting. Look forward to going again soon.
2015-08-10,5,First night in town and this is where er came!  BYO place with  great staff, good menu with great flavors and Gluten Free friendly.They also have dedicated friers fro their french fries which is a big deal for people like me with celiacs. We had Melissa as our server, i think, we went over a month ago. She was awesome.  we are a sarcastic bunch and she rolled with the punches and dished it right back, but was super helpful with everything.Backyard brisket on GF bun, 2 burgers, fire quacker.got sides of pickles, fries, and friends had the onion rings.Food was so good!  Will definintly come back when we are in town.
2015-07-27,5,Amazing burgers that are organic and healthy ! I love the Blue Elk and the Hog Wild burgers. The ambiance and staff are also great!
2015-07-22,5,Delicious!  Had a Turkey burger with Gouda cheese and sweet potato fries.  Perfectly made, great service. Unique menu items such as ostrich, would like to try it the next time around.
2015-07-18,3,Fun place! Nice, unique ambiance. Interesting exotic meat options. However, neophytes, you must be prepared, organic beef does not taste like the beef many of us are familiar with; it is something to experience. Burgers were well prepared, plenty of topping options. Fries came out cold, but, were replaced quickly, no questions asked and were delivered piping hot. Delicious onion rings. Service was excellent -  friendly, knowledgeable, attentive.
2015-07-17,5,We went for dinner on a Thursday night around 730 and no wait for inside seating. Immediately I loved the look and feel of the place! Very rustic, distressed wood, cool lamps made out of spoons and forks, and exposed brick. LOVED the look. So, its BYOB which is amazing - there is a wine and liquor store right across the street. We ordered the onion rings which were near perfect. The crispyness and stringyness of them was fantastic. It came with two sauces, one was like BBQ and the other was like campfire (ranch & BBQ mixed).We also got the Pickles and slaw combo. The wasabi carrot slaw is not my style but the wasabi flavoring was very mild. The regular slaw fell flat on flavor. All 3 flavored pickles were unique and amazing. I ordered the Fire Cracka - which was VERY HOT! My boyfriend had to finish it for me. He ordered the Wiki Wiki and we ended up splitting the two burgers (the cook cut them in half for us which was great!). The wiki wiki was AMAZING. If a log cabin had a "flavor" this was it. So comforting, down home flavors. All in all we will DEFINITELY be back.
2015-07-14,4,Been here multiple times and very solid place.  Like that you can BYOB and the food is great.  Good to hang out with friends or go on a date.  The sweet potato fries are great and the the burger meat choices are on point and toppings are awesome.
2015-07-14,4,They had ostrich!!!!I like this location. There was a short wait on a Friday night, nothing too crazy long, and the staff was super attentive. There were quite a large number of families with their kids but that didn't bother me. Our server was great as was the food. They have all their usual burger fixins and salads to choose from. Fries and rings are a la cart and you can get a personal size or trough sharing size. Did I mention this location had ostrich?!! So good!!This location is byob so I will definitely take advantage of that in the future!
2015-07-14,4,Came across this restaurant in Yelp while looking for a place to get take out. It was a little hard to find since the sign isn't that apparently and we passed by it twice. (the huge tree in front doesn't help either.) Inside isn't extremely big but it is cozy and makes it feel homey. Decor is nice and the lighting is just right, I have a thing for restaurants that are stadium bright or nightclub dark lol. Since we just wanted to grabbed food we walked up to the counter to place our order, didn't call ahead & it didn't take long to make our order so if you aren't in a rush it isn't much of a wait. I had the Bison Burger & it was extremely juicy and delicious. It was called El Matador it had avocado and jalapeños with all the usual essentials. I also ordered the sweet potato fries but was disappointed as they were burnt and dry. Will definitely come back again for the Bison Burger!!
2015-07-12,4,The burgers are great, and it's nice to find some of my favorite meats on the menu on the East Coast (Elk burgers... delicious).  Great selection of toppings, and while I could do the math and come up with the potential combinations of burgers, suffice to say it's more than you could try in a lifetime.Personally I usually go with the Grindhouse or make my own combination with a side of fries.  The fry orders are MASSIVE, and I usually split a regular order with a friend as neither of us can finish one by ourselves.  The ginger green tea is refreshing on a hot summer day, especially when enjoying the weather and people watching out on the patio.  The milkshakes are allegedly quite tasty as well, but I can't attest to this personally since they're so good nobody will share theirs with me and I'm usually too full to order one myself!The wait staff is very friendly and attentive and my tea never goes empty.
2015-07-08,3,Burgers are good, but I have been visiting the chain for a year and with every visit, prices seem to be higher (or I am being charged for things that were complimentary) and the quantity of food that actually makes it to my burger decreases.They had these amazing hemp milk buns catering to the gluten free audience. The latest burger I had was good but different. They started using rice buns from a supermarket, but never changed it on the menu. That was nice to find out... Especially because I am supposed to be avoiding rice.From the toppings - duck bacon is my favorite (expect one piece of it on a burger for $3) and I am also a fan of their vegetarian options. The decor is fun. The walls are wood with a rustic look and the light pieces are made of spoons and forks. Really nice touch. The service was using - We ordered a bottle of water and the waitress didn't know if they served bottled water. She had to find out. I have to say that the burgers arrived quickly which was nice.Overall, I love the concept of the place and the food actually tastes good. It's just a shame to see the prices go up while quality suffers. The place has become a money making machine and seems to be cutting corners in a way that is disappointing.
2015-06-15,4,Sat out on the patio on a beautiful hot Sunday afternoon. It was our first time trying Bareburger - and the staff was really nice - they even asked if we wanted water for our puppy!So many choices on the menu but as it was a burger place, we decided to try their burgers.I had ordered the Standard, but changed the beef patty to a duck and no cheese. The standard comes with a sauteed onions, special sauce and pickles. I did not go wrong with this burger! It was really juicy and flavourful!The BF built his own burger, beef patty, tomatoes, fig sauce, cheese and something else I can't remember. They have a pretty extensive customizable menu, plus you could customize any of the other burgers on the menu!Based on other reviews, we had also ordered the onions rings and pickles to share. Onion rings weren't bad, but I guess I wasn't really into their homemade ketchup - it tasted a bit too much like tomato sauce. The pickles were excellent!Can't wait for Bareburger to finally open up in my neighbourhood!
2015-06-14,5,Exceptional service, which enhanced our experience.  Team was friendly, enthusiastic, knowledgable, and efficient.  Menu was creative and enticing.  Greatly enjoyed the "El Matador" bison burger with fries/rings, and a sarsaparilla.
2015-06-13,5,Excellent burgers!  Been there twice and tried different types of burgers both times.  Ate every bite! (and I never finish my full meals).  Excited to go back and try the bison burger--heard that was is amazing as well.
2015-06-06,2,I was really excited to eat here, but was very disappointed in the end. I came here with my roommate at 9pm on a Friday. It was still really busy, but we were seated outside immediately (there was only a wait for indoor seating). We sat there...and sat...and sat some more. A server was running circles around us to everyone else but never actually stopped for us. After about 10 mins of this, I finally caught their attention to simply ask for water. Our server was very apologetic about the wait and took our order. We ordered the french fries and onion rings to share, and each got the county fair burger. The french fries and onion rings came out first after a relatively long wait, which I thought was fine as long as burgers would follow shortly thereafter. Unfortunately, we waited at least another 20 mins before our burgers appeared. We didnt want to get too full on fries and rings, so we stopped eating them after a while. When our burgers finally arrived, the fries and rings were cold so they couldn't be enjoyed together. To make matters worse, both of our burgers were cold. It was cooked to our liking, but felt like it had been sitting without any what source for a good 15 mins. Overall, the quality of meat tasted good, but it just didn't feel right eating a cold burger. If you're paying over $10 for a burger alone with no sides included, you at least expect it to be pretty darn good. We didn't even finish the burgers because they weren't great. Overall, it is very doubtful I will ever return. I could maybe handle the poor service if the food was worthwhile, but it really wasn't worth the money or the time.
2015-06-05,2,Good food, but they don't care about people who are gluten free. They will serve items with gluten as "gluten free" and don't get that some people really can't have gluten (it's not just a fad diet). Unfortunately, can't trust them enough to order.
2015-06-05,2,I'm extremely torn about this review - I had an awful experience, but in the end, the food ended up being great - when it wasn't raw. Not sure if I will be coming back in the immediate future. My boyfriend and I both ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich - I had had it once before and knew it was amazing. When our sandwiches came, we were both so excited to dig in - only to see that BOTH of our sandwiches were completely raw in the middle. Not just a little pink, but completely raw and inedible. When we called over the staff, at first they claimed that it 'looked that way because it was dark meat.' I'm sorry, but no - it was still completely raw. They took our food away and said they would bring us new sandwiches. After we had both taken a bite of raw meat, our appetites were gone. We flagged someone down and asked for the sandwiches to go, because frankly, we had no desire to eat them at that moment. The manager hurried out and was extremely polite and waived our bill. He was very accommodating, but gave the same excuse - that it 'looked raw because it was dark meat.' When we got our food, we left.Overall, the staff was great for taking care of our bill and getting us new food. I commend them for that. When we finally ate the fully-cooked sandwiches, they were delicious. I was just bothered that the staff couldn't simply admit their mistake instead of making up excuses. I had eaten here once before, and it was delicious then. I will go back, but probably not for a while. Just be wary of how your food is prepared.
2015-05-10,5,First time here, very good burger, but you wait long after the order. It's BYOB.2 weeks layer, I was thee again. Faster and better service. Now it deserves 5 star.
2015-05-08,3,Not sure why, but was more impressed with the locations in NYC. Wouldn't go here for a salad as they are small and nothing special. Sandwiches are okay. Definitely just go for the burgers and try the interesting meats, those are worth it. Sides are great too. I'm not a fan of onion rings but these are perfectly seasoned and incredibly crunchy!
2015-05-05,5,First off, I'd like to say that the service here is fantastic! Everyone was willing to help out with anything you needed. The service here, at least from what I experienced, was better than what you would find at most places. As for the food, I had the Guadalupe burger. Even though it was vegetarian, there still had a lot of different flavors and complexity to it. Very unexpected, yet, extremely delightful. Next time I come, I'll have to try more on the menu, which, from seeing other reviews on here, is for the most part, very worth it.I'd recommend this place to anyone! This is the place to go for burgers if you're in Hoboken!
2015-04-22,4,Best onion rings ever!  Their fries and sweet potato fries are also great. So far I've had beef, bison and elk burgers which were all great and cooked to my ordered medium rare. (I also tried the goat burger which I didn't care for - and apparently no one else did either because it's no longer on the menu.)The chickpea onions are like crispy onion straws and the stout onions taste more like fried onions glazed with a little stout beer. Both are fantastic.Duck bacon - yes.All cheese - always.Favorite sauces - habanero mayo, horseradish remoulade, special sauce, paprika mayo.
2015-04-22,5,Really fresh food. Great baton option and the chicken sandwich is very good. There are many options for all preferences!
2015-04-20,5,The burgers here are really good and really unique! Staff is super and don't mind explaining everything to you.  The nacho fries, the special, is AMAZING.  Overall, this was a great experience and I would definitely go back.
2015-04-12,3,We had to wait forever. No biggie. We got to shop for some wine to drink with our dinner. But the problem was that the wait was much longer than we were told it was going to be. Who knew? Staff as always was nice and ready to explain the menu and offer up recommendations.Instead of a burger, I went with a salad. After discussing with my date and our lovely server, I went for the large Sweet Grazin' Salad topped with a healthy dose of buttermilk fried chicken. All the ingredients played nice together and felt fresh for the most part, but, nothing was cut into a manageable size. The apples were large wedges and the radishes, though thin, were big circles--not easy to bite. And the fried chicken might have been too spicy to go with the light salad.The boyf got the El Matador (his usual?) and he tried out the wasabi carrot slaw. The burger looked consistent to previous visits, but the carrot slaw was lacking the heat and flavor he was looking for.We ended our dinner with the Snickerdoodle Sammie. Once again, this was an excellent decision. I CRAVE this little ice cream sandwich. It is sweet and spicy and comes with caramel sauce, what could be better?The burgers are always pretty good and the snickerdoodle sammie is out-of-control, but the a la carte style of the eatery makes it hard to decide how much food to actually get.
2015-04-11,4,i love the concept behind this place, the menu's a little more complicated than most, you definitely have to study it a little.. their website is cool though.i was really excited to try a bison or elk burger but chickened out and got the hot honey chicken sandwich instead. GOOD CHOICE. it's a bit on the sweet side but i enjoyed it to the last bite. i was sad about their hand cut fries, not the best, but at least they're organic..?My friend ordered some salad which she barely touched and her baby had the "polar" a grilled colby cheese sandwich. the baby didn't like her sandwich either, but it might have been too sophisticated for a 10 mo old's palate. My friend's husband was really excited about them serving maine root's sodas, i have no idea what that's about, but for you maine root enthusiasts, they have em here! wish i had looked at the reviews beforehand. otherwise i would have ordered the onion rings and banana foster milkshake! i'd def frequent this place if they had a spot in socal ;)
2015-04-11,4,I just had the buckaroo burger; it was glorious. The burger just melted in my mouth and was exactly the portion I wanted. I was happy to see this come to Hoboken, I used to frequent their spots in the city. Not a huge fan of all the piecemeal of sauces and simple sides but there's a refreshing number of interesting meats for you to choose from like duck, bison and elk.
2015-03-24,4,Good burger spot overall. Friendly staff, good food, good ambiance, quick and easy. The only negative is it is expensive and portions are small for the price. Bison and beef and chicken and turkey are all tasty and toppings are great but paying $0.55 for some spicy mayo just seems of to me. Parking is all need street here of course.
2015-03-22,4,Bareburger is fantastic!  The number of meat options; the freshness of it all; it's just great.  Why not 5 stars?  I just tend to like a couple of other places better.  But the bison burger is a 5 star sandwich.  I really like that you can order take-out.  It was so busy there when they first opened, take-out was the only way to get it quickly.
2015-03-20,4,Great burger spot.  B.Y.O.B. The service is always good - very friendly and attentive.  The SoCal is a top favorite for me.
2015-03-10,3,I heard so many good things about this place. I was most intrigued by the meat offerings. I was torn as to whether I should give them 3 or 4 stars, a 3.5 would have been ideal, but I don't see myself wanting to come here that often or very soon so I went with the 3. Plus the prices are higher than average for burgers, but maybe that just falls into the how organic foods are priced higher?So I came here with my reluctant boyfriend, who's eaten here before but doesn't care for it much. I had the Wiki Wiki Burger ($11.90), which consists of wild boar, Gouda, duck bacon, chickpea onions, pineapple relish, and brioche bun. I liked my burger.. the boar was a surprisingly nice texture and the mix of flavors from the relish and Gouda really came out. I ordered a Banana Foster milkshake ($5.95, I almost can't refuse anything Banana Foster!). It was pretty good.. I tasted the banana and the caramel drizzle on the side of the cup. Very sweet though, but that's expected of a Bananas Foster treat.We also ordered a side of Rings and Fries ($4.70). The fried onion rings were really good and they paired well with some of the four dipping sauces provided. The fries were nothing special, but eating them with the organic ketchup they provided just killed it for me. I am a ketchup lover and I couldn't handle their ketchup. (Edit: Their ketchup is organic and I respect that, my palette is just too used to the "un-organic" ketchup and so I prefer that.) I kid you not, we ate a few fries and took the rest home to eat with our Heinz ketchup. Service was friendly and polite. The food just didn't give me any "wow" factor. And the prices kind of turn me away. Maybe one day if I go the organic route, I'd come more often. But for now.. I'm very happy with Shake Shack and my Heinz ketchup.
2015-02-21,5,We are here this afternoon. Food was great, nice ambience, friendly servers. I ordered the brisket sandwich, awesome cooked perfectly. We also ordered brunch and a chicken dish, also very good. I would recommend eating here and I'll be back.
2015-02-20,5,Organic and fresh and fast! It's a packed place, there's going to be a wait if you're trying to sit in. There are many options from the variety of burgers catered to all, shakes, teas and a coffee, and also a menu for the little ones. Start off with the shakes, go into one of their shareables, and then the burgers; you will leave satisfied. Amazing place for lunch and surprisingly, everything seems to be well proportioned at a reasonable rate. There might have an even more extensive menu at the other locations, but you'll find enough at this spot, the downside is that it's in an area where parking is problem. Nevertheless, go at the right time and you'll find it If it's meant to be ;)
2015-02-19,4,I went with my friends a we all ordered a different kind of burger. The food is great and the service was good as well
2015-02-19,5,best burgers, fries, and onion rings i've ever had. i go every time i'm in the area. love that it's all natural too!
2015-02-01,4,I only took away one star because I think it's just a tad bit pricey for lunch. Talk about options! I love the variety of meats, toppings and sauces. I don't feel disgusting after eating a burger from this place and can I just say the ketchup that comes in the packets is organic!! As someone who has a significant other that cannot eat gluten we live Bareburger as an easy, filling, gourmet gluten free meal! Will definitely order from again and again!
2015-01-30,4,I just had a great elk burger with spicy pico de gallo.  The meat was very lean but still tasty.  Eating healthy and still feeling like you just have indulged is great.The service.wss great.  Our waitress was very friendly and knew the menu up and down.  Great on recommending what to eat and helping us decide based on the different meat options (beef, elk, bisson, duck, wild board, etc)I will definitely eat here again .
2015-01-25,5,What an amazing place. I tried the El Matador. Bison, guacamole, jalapenos, cheese!  It was one of the best burgers I've eaten in a while. The staff is also really friendly and helpful. Definitely check this place out. Completely worth it.
2015-01-20,4,I was so excited when I heard this place was coming to Hoboken. I can be something of a burger fiend and I've had a hard time finding a burger that is fiend-worthy since I've been working in Hoboken the last 2 years. I love BareBurger because they give you so many options to choose from. I'm a little disappointed in myself because I still haven't manned up and tried any of the exotic meats they offer lol. I always make build my burger and I always get beef. I've eaten here, picked up, and gotten delivery. All decent. Of course, eating in the restaurant is always the best. Burgers, by nature, don't travel super well. ESP when you get 5 toppings (like I do). I find the quality of the food to be good and the service is always great. They're not always on point with the temp of my burger (med-rare). It usually ends up being medium at best...well at worst. But when they're on point, it's amazing. I love their homemade sodas too (particularly the blueberry & cola). I recently got a gift card for here from a work gift exchange (my co-workers are awesome), so I will be in very shortly!
2015-01-19,2,Burger was just okay. I had the standard burger with beef. The beef was quite dry. This might possibly be due to a lower fat content (healthier meat), but I prefer my burger a bit juicer. My husband had the bison burger and seemed to like it. Personally, I'd rather have an amazing traditional burger instead of some health-conscious concoction that didn't satisfy my burger craving. Overall was a disappointment, although it could have been worse.
2015-01-18,4,great burger, friendly staff and byob whats not to love! everything is good here!
2015-01-17,3,Burgers are creative and delicious. Everything else, however, is over-priced for the portions. We have been wanting to try this place since it opened and were very excited to get take-out tonight. The order arrived ahead of what was estimated, which was great, but everything was very cold.  I was looking forward to the onion rings but was disappointed to see the portion. I was expecting much more for what they charge, since no sides come with the expensive burgers. Similarly, we ordered the $8 carrot cake. I thought it was odd that it came in a sealed plastic bag, like airplane food. I would eat here again, but only for the burgers and only dine-in.
2015-01-11,5,Great addition to the Hoboken food scene! Adds a much needed upgrade to the usual humdrum that is out there. Hobokenites are no longer limited to beef, turkey or veg burgers. Bareburger offers bison, elk, 2 kinds of veg and goat. Bonus are the really friendly and informed servers and BYOB. There are lots of great combos but made my own: bison with blue cheese, green tomato and stout onions. Solid burger and since bison is supposedly healthier than 90 percent lean beef and turkey I felt kinda healthy eating eat it. Blow all the calories you saved from the bison by getting a real ice cream shake (no mixes here) and sweet potato fries. We also ordered the Southern Caviar with pimento cheese which was pretty good but could have used a bit more of the pimento cheesiness to make it live up to its tasty menu description.My only wish: That the Piri Piri chicken place that used to be at this location would reopen next door. I miss there roast chicken. A girl can dream.
2015-01-01,5,Brought out-of-town family here today... They loved it. We are a party of 7, so we had to wait for a table... Place is small... But definitely worth the wait today... Order was correct and cooked as requested... Fine job!!!!
2014-12-30,3,I came in for lunch right before SantaCon. This place is pretty cool, dimly lit with rustic wooden decor and dark metal accents. It looks like Pilsner Haus on a smaller scale basically.We split the large order of fries and onion rings. The fries and onion rings came with four sauces: curry, habanero, special, and smoke. Curry sauce tasted like marinara with curry powder, habanero was spicyish, special was like spicy/chipotle mayo, and smoke was just bbq sauce.I had the Grindhouse, subbing the country bacon for duck bacon, medium rare. The elk burger was a little closer to rare than medium rare, but that's ok. Elk burger was really lean, I didn't really care for the piquante relish since it kinda smothered the flavor of the burger.Overall the burger was enjoyable, but a bit pricey for lunch. I get that exotic organic meat is more expensive, but it'd be a better deal if a side were included with the burger.
2014-12-29,4,The reviews are right. Food is good; worth coming back for. But a $12 burger without sides is on the expensive side. But they get you with the whole organic "cool, different kind of meat" deal. Ambiance is rustic. Employees are friendly and knowledgeable - but I was felt one waitress for the whole (90% full) dining room on a Monday night was understaffed. The onion rings are yummy the sweet potato fries good but nothing special. The 4 dipping sauces were fun to try and idk how I would've liked my burgers without them! (Was glad to have the sauces but wouldn't have if I didn't order the sides). I split the wiki wiki burger and the blue elks burger with my sister and we both would go back. $36 for lunch won't break the bank but just keep in mind that it's not cheap!
2014-12-29,5,had the most delicious bison burger! It was cooked perfectly, juicy, a little pink & packed with flavor! fries were amazing too! will definitely be back!!
2014-12-29,4,I first came to BareBurger because my husband is a meat and potato man. I'm mostly vegetarian/vegan! Well, I'm pleased to say this place has many delicious and unusual options for both of us. For example, one time I got a salad centered around Brussels sprouts, and had a sweet potato "burger" on top of it. Totally vegan, totally filling, totally yum!  I do occasionally eat meat and my meaty friends say the various burgers are really good.I like the funky decor, too, and love the fact that it's organic, loca-vore and so on...that's important to me and not very easy to find here in Hoboken.The main issues with this place are it's always crowded so there is usually a wait (they don't take reservations). And, there's this one tiny table by the window I've gotten seated at a few times that really is too small for comfort.
2014-12-15,5,Bareburger is my new favorite burger place. The choices and combinations of burgers seem endless. The organic and sustainable approach is a big plus for me since it makes me feel good with each bite. I highly recommend the following: the onion rings, bison meat on your burger and the snicker doodle sammie. Stick to these recommendations and get ready for an amazing dining experience.
2014-12-15,4,This is my second visit to Bareburger as I had previously been to the one in Murray Hill. I was excited to try the one in Hoboken as there is a shortage of vegetarian places in Hoboken if you don't want Italian or to go to Precious. The place is really crowded if you go on a Friday or Saturday night and you will have to wait for a table and waiting means staring at the currently seated customers as there is nowhere to wait. BYOB which is a huge plus. I was really pleased with our service as my friend and I were in a rush which we told our waiter when we sat down. They took our order within seconds of us sitting down and the food was out within 5-10 minutes. Bill was given fast too but then we waited for our change for a bit.Tried the Guadalupe (black bean burger with pickled red onions, alfalfa sprouts, guacamole, and brioche bun) with a side of fries. Loved the burger as it wasn't the standard mush that one usually gets with veggie burgers and the combination was really filling and healthy. I had previously gotten the Goat (with veggie patty, onions, green leaf, mint yogurt, relish, sprout bun) which I liked better as it was good Mediterranean flavors all on a burger.   I like the ability to mix up the types of burgers and opt for a lettuce wrap instead of a bun. Makes eating burgers and drinking beer not feel so unhealthy. Will be back in an instant for fast quality and flavorful non-meat burgers!
2014-12-14,1,Had a very disappointing experience. Was looking forward to trying this place but was extremely let down. First we ordered the pickles and slaw, which was overpriced ($11.85) and definitely not worth it. Then I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich. So disgusting I had to spit it out into my napkin. It was drowning in buffalo sauce and the chicken was brown. I brought it to the waitresses attention and she explained that they use a different part of the chicken,  which still made me leery about it. At that point I decided to not finish eating it and try something else. I ordered the standard burger and that turned out to be another big disappointment. She asked how I would like it cooked and I said medium well with the special sauce on the side. When I cut into it, it was still mooing and they forgot to give me the sauce. Besides all of that the burger had no flavor and was as flat as a pancake. My boyfriend had the wild hog and had no complaints but wasn't impressed with it either. The overall experience was not a good one at all. I would definitely not go back.
2014-12-13,1,We arrived just to be told to wait 30 minutes for a table. After 15 minutes of wait in the cold, we were told to wait an additional hour. The worst thing, is that they didn't even apologize or seem to care. Not even the manager. We will not 'bare' that. We'll have our burgers elsewhere!
2014-12-06,5,Consistently great service, all the servers are sweet and attentive. Had the big blue elk burger, perfectly cooked and delicious. This place is BYOB so make sure to bring some wine/beer. The restaurant is small and fills up fast but I've never had to wait long. Sweet potato fries and homemade pickles are great too!
2014-12-06,1,Just terrible and poorly run. I ordered through delivery.com and after an hour and a half wait, I called the store wondering where my food was . They had "system issues" and the order never went to the kitchen. They offered to expedite my order but didn't go any further - like, for example, compensate me for the $10 in fees, delivery fee, and tip on my order. After 30m goes by I call the store again- this time to cancel my order. A different girl assured me the order went out and should be there soon - and that the manager is calling me when he returns to the store. We agree to keep the order. Another 30m and another call. They cancelled my order, and, even though the manager was back in the store he had some other, more important calls to make. Now it's 2hrs later, I haven't ate, and have no food plan. Also, now I have to deal with getting a $45 refund from delivery.com. Bareburger and delivery.com ruined my Saturday night. Thanks guys.
2014-12-01,3,Though the wait staff might have been very accommodating, I really dislike it when my order is forgotten. My El Matador burger came out lukewarm, which was an even bigger disappointment.  Too bad.
2014-12-01,4,I was very pleased with our experience, I expected it to be a very hipster like place.but was very surprised that the food was very good and the service was friendly and prompt. Our table ordered a pretty wide variety of the burgers, we also ordered a variety of onion rings and fries. The portions were about a standard hamburger size and the sauces were amazing. We have an spicy mayo  is definitely something that I would come back for. I finished up with a bananas foster milkshake, it was very very good not too sweet but very flavorful.
2014-11-30,4,The bison burger is as good as I've had.  The beef and black bean burgers are above average.  The fries as fries are also above average, but the ketchup is outstanding.  The service is quite good.  One off-menu item I don't see mentioned in other reviews which I'd recommend;  their shakes are quite good, but if you order their bananas foster shake they'll add peanut butter if you ask for it.  It's sublime.  Also, as each time I've been there there have been people in from NYC (I'm not sure why, much as I love my native Hoboken, I don't think our Bareburger is better than those in the city) I should note that it's BYO.
2014-11-28,3,This location is subpar to the rest of the Bareburger location.  Unless the menu has changed, this location had a different one. Also they sized their meat way differently, the patties were flat like a fast food chain. The taste was ok, but the cheese and other toppings overpowered the meat, due to the lack of size of the patty.
2014-11-21,5,PROS: -You can build your own burger, and they have soo many options of toppings and burger choice (ranging from bison to wild boar)-You can make healthy choices (or unhealthy, if you so wish)- they have a lot of veggies you can choose from to put on your burger!-Cozy and fun atmosphere-We had a great waitress-We didn't experience a long wait to get our food after we ordered, even though the place was packedCONS: - I'm not sure how it is on the weekdays, but you will have to wait to get seated if you're there on a Friday or Saturday night, but that's because the place is so damn good. Our wait was about 30 minutes, which isn't bad if it's a nice enough night to walk around. It's well worth the wait.-YOU CAN'T BUY BEER HERE, but you can BYOB!I'm a healthy eater who rarely eats meat, and I cook most of the food I eat, but once every few months I crave a burger. I got a bison burger here with lots of veggies and on a whole wheat bun, and OH MY GOD I ate the entire thing, plus some onion rings and sweet potato fries (the SP fries weren't amazing, but oh man, the onion rings were!!). I never have enough room in my stomach to eat all of the food I order at a restaurant, but the food here is SO FREAKING GOOD that I ate everything on my plate. I left fat and happy, and now I crave burgers more often than once every few months- but I only want a burger from this joint!
2014-11-17,3,great overall food if you go in to eat there. HOWEVER DO NOT ORDER ONLINE, especially on the weekends. I dont think Bareburger can handle this volume. Ordered on Friday evening took an hour and half for food to get there (mind you i live in hoboken) and the food came cold. Needed to heat it up, food was decent heated in the microwave at home but was frustrated with how long it took to get the food. Will only be visiting in person from now on.
2014-11-14,2,I have not had a chance to taste the food because I have been waiting an hour for it.  I placed the order at 730 and set delivery time for 9..... It is now almost ten and I cannot get through to the store, just keep getting busy signals.  This is unacceptable!Just updating my review.....they refunded my order and I got it delivered finally.  It was cold, but tasty after heated up.  Once I was able to get in contact the customer service was very nice.
2014-11-14,2,Would love to comment on the food but I wouldn't know what it tastes like.Ordered online and waited over 2 hours for our food and it never showed up.  Tried calling and phone constantly busy.  When I did get through spoke to someone called Nicole who pretended to put me on hold then hung up.They really need to sort out their customer service, if you can't handle delivery volume then don't take orders.  Coupled with terrible customer service this place is a great big miss from me.UPDATE: Food showed up after 2 hours and 45 mins and 32 attempts to phone.  It was ok. Cold.  Has potential but they need to iron out these kinks.
2014-11-14,5,There are not enough words in the english language to describe how amazing this place is!!!! for organic burgers this is THE BEST.  I am not overselling this place it is truly amazing.  Their burger with the brisket on top is to die for.  So many options for vegan, gluten free, organic you can't go wrong with anything. Please save room for the ice cream sandwiches they are so so so good, all of them.  Please go here, you may have to wait a little but it is worth it!
2014-11-14,4,This is my favorite burger joint in town. I've already hit this place up twice in the span of a 3 weeks. They offer a great selection of exotic burger meat. The burgers are creative and flavorful - this ain't your cookie cutter burger joint. I've had both their bison and elk burgers. The fixings are always tasty and juicy, the meat flavored and cooked well with that hint of gamey-ness that makes it interesting. Their side of fries was not as crispy as I prefer but it came with some amazing dips (chipotle mayo)! YUMMY stuff!
2014-11-14,4,Ordered takeout last night. Staff was extremely friendly, which is a nice change of pace. The hostess had a warm greeting and guided me to the back where pickup is.  They got me in and out in just a few short minutes. The food itself was phenomenal. I had the county fair. First time having bison, but surely not the last. Everything from the brioche bun, to the pickles, to the cheese. Fantastic. My girlfriend made her own burger, with black bean. Almost as good as mine, but definitely just as filling. Never had a better black bean burger. My only complaint was that the fries became soggy, but it's half to be expected with takeout/delivery. Whatever the brown sauce accompanying the fries was next level good as well.
2014-11-13,3,We enjoyed the lunch we had here.Decor: The decorative theme is rustic barn-ish and it's really cool. It gives a cool vibe to the place and really drives home the fact that this is not an ordinary burger place. It helps to add to the relaxed atmosphere as well.Bathroom: It's in the back and it is very clean, well lit, and inviting.Staff: Our waiter was a really nice guy but just a tad bit slow. At first I thought it was because he was the only one for the (semi-small) dining room but that was not the case. Other than that, he was friendly.Food/Drink: We had burgers (of course): a turkey burger and a build-your-own bison burger. Both were very delicious and cooked well - note: when they say "medium" they mean it! warm-pink center (next time I'll go medium well). We also had a side of sweet potato fries (deliciously over cooked - YUM!) and a lemonade (they allow one free refill, which is nice).Value: It is a bit more pricey than a typical burger joint, but you get what you pay for: grass-fed meat tastes so much better!This is a good spot for lunch and we will return in the future. The only complaint is that I wish it was fast-food style... a sit-down burger place is not what I prefer but that's just me.
2014-11-12,3,3.5 I'd say.  I like being able to pick your protein along with whichever burger you'd like as with the other Bareburgers, but their menu still kept my interest. I ordered the Matador and while I enjoyed the ingredients my burger was much more rare than Id like as were my friends.  Loved the BYOB though, definitely my cheapest visit to Bareburger.
2014-11-09,5,We waited briefly later on a Saturday night and were seated by the nice hostess.  There are a ton of options here.  They have everything to appease the meat eaters, the bird eaters, and even stuff for your pain in the butt herbivore friends so they can come too.  Our waiter was awesome and super friendly.  Everyone eating here had a smile on their face.  We had the fries and ring combo with the four amazingly tasty sauces.  It is the best thing to do if you come with multiple people.  I had the elk burger.  It actually tasted like meat unlike the other quick burger joints that have been popping up everywhere.  Way better than shake shack.  I kept if simple and just put some cheese (there are a lot of options for that too) and some standard burger veg on top.  The list of toppings was endless.  Overall, quality tasting meat and it being inexpensive for a quick date night gave this 4 starts.  The 5th star came from our service.
2014-11-08,4,I loved it! We came for lunch today and it was packed but we sat down right away. The service was great. We started with the wasabi carrot slaw, spicy pickles, and onion ring sides. All were great. Then I got the elk burger with cheddar cheese, country bacon (which apparently means Taylor ham) and special sauce on a sprout multigrain bun. They have so many different options of meats, cheeses, bacons, vegetables, sauces, and buns. Everything was great. It's a little pricey for a burger place (the bill was $50 for 2 people after tip) but it's worth it. Plus it's a byob.
2014-11-08,1,After having such a great experience the first time, we went back the next week, but were utterly disappointed.While we were waiting for our table, we observed how one of the tables was waiting for a very long time to get their food, and when the burgers finally arrived, they were apparently cold, and they sent them back to the kitchen. In the meantime, the servers all try to act cool and laid back, chit-chatting with customers and each other, which would've been OK if they were doing their job well also.We finally got to our table, and the first thing we ordered was this hipster blueberry soda that we tried somewhere else and really liked. The server promptly proclaimed that this is the best drink in the world, but when he brought, it was very far from it. It was extremely watered down, because they decided to serve it in a glass full of crushed ice! Just give me the damn bottle and a glass on the side. Who serves soda on crushed ice?!Anyway, the worst disappointment was actually the burgers. Last time my partner tried the Buckaroo and we were both impressed with the brisket topping. So, this time I ordered the Buckaroo, and my partner went for the brisket sandwich. Unfortunately, the brisket that was included in my burger, and was the centerpiece of my partner's sandwich was so dry and chewy that I removed it from my burger and my partner was just left with the sandwich roll.So, clearly the first time we just got lucky, and now we experienced the real lack of quality control in this restaurant. Until quality control and the staff improve, I cannot recommend this place anymore.
2014-11-04,4,Tons of places to get burgers in the area, however too many are loud sports bars.  If you are looking for a solid/creative and organic selection I think you have found the place.The locale is designed with a bear that possibly lives in a smokehouse in mind.  BareBurger has various meat offerings such as elk, bison, goat, wild board and a few vegetarian options.  I sampled the Southern Caviar and the Supreme.  I mean how can I possibly not sample the Southern Caviar (umm pimento cheese) being a southern boy at heart?  I liked it and will return.  My only "beef" is the patty is on the smaller side.
2014-11-01,2,Food is great but delivery service is poor. Very late and messed up order...when I called in to let them know, they told me they were "overwhelmed and very busy" and needed to call me back?? Not service I expect on a $100 burger order. Fail
2014-11-01,3,Ordered online and took an hour to get to us. By the time we got the food, our burgers and fries were soggy and cold. Also nearly $4 for a kale salad and got about the equivalent of a leaf of kale. Having said this, I have dined in before and everything was good. Just don't order out from here.
2014-10-31,3,Ok the food here is outstanding- no complaints. I'm knocking off too stars for overall restaurant management. The staff is WAY too lax and needs to get a grip on just about everything. After telling us the wait is about 30 minutes...nearly 60 minutes later we finally sat down. Please learn how to judge table times. We watched while several tables were done and paid and were not encouraged to move on or order more. Meanwhile there were at least 5 parties waiting to sit. You don't have to kick people out, but if you are a  motivated server and manager, you turn tables smoothly and nicely. Period. This place is good for takeout only.
2014-10-30,5,This bareburger is great. They have gotten every single order right thus far (I've ordered take out a lot) and have done so quickly. The food is always amazing and fresh but I think that's a standard with Bareburger's and is expected now. The real value here is the quality of service. Today, they messed up on a delivery and had miscommunication issues with the delivery guy. Mistakes happen, even though I was pretty irate. They kindly remade the whole order (it had been sitting for 30 min and I had been waiting for over an hour for delivery) and gave me a $10 credit. A lot of places won't do that but they did and it was hugely appreciated, despite the amount of time everything took. I'll continue to keep coming back to this bareburger - they're so close - not just for the quality of food but also the service.
2014-10-28,1,Second  time ordering delivery. First time waited two hours and no food. Ordered thru delivery.com and they supposedly never received our order. 2.5 hours later delivery shows up and it was stone cold - had to have been sitting somewhere for at least an hour. Thought I would give them another chance and ordered again tonight. Told 40mins for meal. Going on an hour and a half now and the food hasn't left the restaurant yet. Spoke to manager and she confirmed it's been sitting since around 830p. Absolutely unreal. They don't know how to operate at this location. Really makes me wonder if their standards of cooking and cleanliness are acceptable. Stay clear. Place is a nightmare and a damage to the brand.
2014-10-25,4,Very kid-friendly - be sure to bring the whole family! Especially good for the little ones. :)
2014-10-21,3,I am unhappy with the way that took care of us when we first got there. There was a group of 6 of us. We got there at 7pm, they said it would take half hour. We didnt get seated until about 830. That part was truly annoying. Once we were seated, I was happy with the service. Our waiter was very nice and helpful.I built my own burger. I got the elk meat medium rare and it was perfectly done. I did like that meat. The fries and onion rings were also good. It is a bit pricey for what you are getting. BYOB which is nice. The atmosphere was nice but its a bit small. Overall, this place is ok.
2014-10-20,1,The first time I went there, I thought that it looked nice and fancy. I ordered a bison burger with cheddar, jalapenos and I was not very impressed. I was wondering if finally I did not prefer the good old five guys one block away. The second time, I tried the delivery. BIG MISTAKE!!!! I waited 1h and 15 minutes for two very cold burgers. The fries were cold, soggy, tasteless... Now, I know that I prefer Five Guys by far. Not that they make good burgers, it's just that you know what you get for what you pay. Having spend close to $40 on a delivery for this kind of service is just unbelievable. Bye bye Bareburger...
2014-10-19,3,Several of us at work have been participating in a "burger challenge" and have been visiting many of the burger joints that have been popping up in the area. We've left the true "fast food" chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, etc out and have stepped up to the second tier with Shake Shack, Five Guys, Habit Burger and Jake's Wayback Burgers. We've also included the third tier places like Bobby's Burger Palace, Zinburger, & The Counter. In the midst of this challenge, we learn of BareBurger in Edgewater and Hoboken along with BurgerFi (eternally "coming soon" to Secaucus). Last night I took a slight detour on my route to nYc and stopped off in Hoboken to visit Bareburger at 515 Washington St. A tiny storefront that features about 24-28 seats inside (booths & deuces) and maybe a dozen or so outdoor seats under an awning; Bareburger's interior design is somewhat kitschy and industrial. Pendant lighting fixtures are adorned with flatware to create a shade. The staff was attentive, inviting and friendly. The menu offers some burger combos or you can build your own. I chose to build my own with beef as my choice of protein. I was informed all beef is cooked to medium unless otherwise requested. I chose medium rare, along with aged cheddar, bacon, and wild mushrooms. There are other vegetable choices as well as sauces that are vegetarian and/or gluten free. I have been low carbing since June, so I chose to have my burger wrapped in collard greens. As I have been participating in the "challenge" I have been consistently been ordering bacon cheeseburgers. I can say that I have enjoyed sampling all the many burger places and have found a few to be "ordinary" and most others to be very good and worthy challengers. I wish I could say this about Bareburger. At $8.80 for the burger without any additional toppings I was quite surprised how bare or actually baron of meat their offering is. Burgers seemed lost in their brioche buns and for me with no bun, the predominate flavor was the aged cheddar not the organic beef. Many of the other places in this challenge also offer organic beef and provide a healthy portion (weight-wise). In fact most places have indicated the pre-cooked weight of their burgers. Not Bareburger, no mention at all. Most likely because it would be embarrassing. Not sure it would register on a food scale.On the walk from Lackawanna Station to Bareburger I passed a Five Guys. Next time I'm in Hoboken, I'll go to Five Guys if I want a burger.
2014-10-16,4,Excellent. Their burger combinations are crazy, lots of variety even with the meat. Or you can always opt for a salad, sandwich or make your own burger. I had the elk, it was really good although a little more cooked than what i asked. The tomato-fig jam was awesome.
2014-10-15,5,Loved the bison burger. The wait was worth it. Staff very helpful, happy, and positive. Thanks George. We thought you were the best.
2014-10-12,4,High quality burgers in a friendly environment. We enjoyed the quality of the burgers and also the cookies with ice cream as dessert. One of the best places to go in Hoboken
2014-10-12,2,The food was good but the menu was a bit overwhelming with do many different burgers along with create your own. Also was a bit pricey for a burger and fries, along with the fact of charging $0.50 for a side of sauce when i opted to not get the sauce that came with the burger I chose. If you are looking for a healthy gourmet burger this would be your place, just not what i expected and prefer 5 guys for what i'm looking for.
2014-10-12,4,Built my own burger, it was delicious! Really like the burger buns. Had the onion rings and fries as well, the fries are the exact fries they have at Five Guys; nothing new. The onion rings are awesome though. Overall great place, a little pricy but worth it.
2014-10-11,5,I didn't get the right spelling but George hope your seeing this bro. This place is great food and service amazing. Banana foster milkshake need to try. So far my favorite burger is Goat patty, Gouda cheese, Duck Bacon, wild mushrooms, and jalapeños. I'm definitely coming back here very often
2014-10-10,4,Looking for delicious, exotic and creative fare in a nice atmosphere? Look no further. @Bareburger is a great addition to Washington Street for casual, healthy, yet indulgent eats. Prices are a bit higher than the norm, but eating high quality (and in some cases, exotic) meats and fresh, organic ingredients cost dough. The place is really nice inside - rustic wood tables and chandeliers make this not your typical chain casual eatery. They have a wide array of burgers already concocted for you ranging from elk topped with blue cheese and more, bison queso fresca and quac, beef topped with short ribs, fries and onion rings, to delicious sounding veggie varietals. None float your fancy? Make your own - pick your burger patty, roll, cheese and all the toppings. A few super awesome bonus l items I found - a goat patty, manchego cheese, duck bacon, and gluten free rolls! Those were just some extra's that just caught my eye.I was feeling a bit under the weather (read: hungover) so I couldn't go crazy. The Country Fare was perfect - bison, cheddar, tomato, dill pickles, lettuce and I opted for the whole wheat sprout bun. The burger itself was large - the patty perfectly sized (read: not too meaty). Bison is much leaner than regular beef - so I loved that there was a bit of fatty grease, but really not a lot. Everything tasted extremely fresh and of course delicious.Service was warm and enthusiastic. The burger ran about $11 and you need to order fries a la carte. In the end, you are looking at about $20 with a drink (no booze here) and tip. Not bad, but a bit pricy for lunch.They have burgers, sandwiches and milkshakes that looked miggghttty tasty as well. Next time. Great job Bareburger, looking forward to my next return!
2014-10-09,4,If you visit Bareburger, please don't be like me and expect a shake shack burger. It's barely your typical burger joint! It's organic and healthy. You will like Bareburger as long as you don't expect your usual burger.The menu was a bit overwhelming with so many choices: beef, boar, elk, bison, and goat. Really fancy and exotic ingredients. I decide on the Wiki Wiki which houses wild boar, gouda, duck bacon, chickpea onions, pineapple relish in between to brioche buns. It sounded very interesting and I couldn't wait to bite into it. I was seriously considering fries but decided to go with the kale salad thinking I should eat the burger with something healthy. Big mistake because the burger was extremely healthy, I should have ordered the fries! The Wiki Wiki wasn't bad, it tasted good but not like a burger. Let's just say I felt really healthy after and still craved a juicy burger and french fries. It's a nice, healthy option for Hoboken.
2014-10-09,4,Great place , all organic and healthy stuff around. Love this place and ambience is so rustic and raw. Wish to make it more visits
2014-10-08,5,Very accomdating to big groups.  "Chris"(hope I have the right name) was a fanastic server and provided great service on a busy friday evening....as well as the other staff who were helpful and friendly.Food wise...they were delish (particularly vegan options) such as assorted sliced pickles, veggie burgers/sandwiches and carrot cake....however, the only thing I would critique was forgetting fried lotus root in couple of sandwichs, if the description of a mazuma includes certain veggies...unless someone request to not include a particular food item, then that's different but not when you're expecting all ingredients. At least in my situation, we brought that to our server's attention and eventually they did bring it out on a seperate dish...besides from that, I will still be a returning customerJust a heads up, this place is busy on weekends, especially during friday nights
2014-10-04,5,Delicious burgers and plenty of healthy options too. Super friendly staff even makes grabbing takeout a nice experience. Suggestions:1. The Standard Burger - tasty classic burger done perfectly. Pickles were particularly good.2. Buckaroo Burger - the addition of a thin slice of brisket adds nice flavor complexity without overloading the burger.  Not too meaty either - highly suggested.3. Rings and sweet potato fries (snack) - great sharing size for 2-3 people.  The "snack" size is larger than the standard side size and includes four great dipping sauces.
2014-09-27,4,Just picked some burgers up to go. I got a bison burger with duck bacon on a brioche bun. Even with travel after pickup the burger was fresh and delicious. Meat was perfectly cooked and the special sauce was delicious as well.Only negative is that they forgot our sauces for the onion rings and sweet fries.
2014-09-21,5,Great burgers and great vegan spot. Like veggie options? Get the sprout salad! Like burgers, have it your way... Seriously make it exactly how you want it . I had mine on my sprout salad.
2014-09-21,5,The best burger I ever had....Buckaroo Burger.  My husband ordered the Goat Burger, which he likes but not as much as my burger.  We also love the crunchy fries & rings.  We cannot wait to try the other items on the menu next time.
2014-09-21,1,Tonight I went to Bare Burger in Hoboken with my family. I have been to others in the city and NJ (edgewater) which were great experiences. However, I have to say last night was one of the worst examples of poor service I have ever witnessed in my life. When we originally asked the hostess how long it would be, she told us 35 mins. This was completely fine as we knew we were a larger party. After 50 mins went by and a multitude of other decent size parties were sat, I politely asked the hostess how much longer she thought. She replied, " no more then 5 mins". Being understanding that it was a Saturday night, we told her no problem and continued to wait. About 20 mins later, she approached us and said, if you are ok with sitting outside, I have one table open and another that is finishing up. We said great! After seeing her seat the empty table she just pointed out to us 3 mins ago, I approached her again apologizing for being pushy but we originally were told 35 mins, countless tables have been sat and got up, it has now been an hour and 15 and there is no indication if we will ever will be sat. She pointed at two tables and said they are just finishing up so two more mins. We for the last time said ok. After seeing the table she pointed out just getting their dinner served "2 mins later" we decided to leave and head to another establishment. We told the hostess this and all we got was an "ok." Never once did we get an apology. Even though we had to wait at this other establishment, it was fine because the hostess was warm, apologetic and accommodating. Bare burger Hoboken can learn a lot from them. You probably noticed that I didn't mention anything about the food. That is because we never got a chance to eat it. I went here one other time previously and the food was pretty good but the service again was terrible. The menu is a lot smaller and some of the great parts of the other bare burger menus are non existent. It took forever to flag down a waiter and they make you feel like you are a number, not a guest.
2014-09-18,1,I used to live close to the Bareburger on Laguardia Place in Greenwich Village and went there often.  My husband and I LOVED it and were regulars.  Now that we moved to Hoboken, we were so excited that Bareburger opened here.  Imagine my disappointment when it was significantly worse than the one in the Village.  All dreams and many years of positive feelings about the franchise name completely killed with one bad meal.I went in hearing that the menu was different from the other Bareburger.  That may be somewhat true but the basics are all the same.  Beef, Turkey, Veggie, Black Bean, Elk, Bison, etc.  Anyway.  I knew what I wanted.  Ordered Sweet Potato fries w/ dipping sauces for the table.  They were good but the sauces weren't that impressive.  I wish there was a zestier, spicier sauce option. I ordered beef burger w/ cheddar, onions, and mushrooms wrapped in collard greens.  My order looked pretty good until I realized the patty was less of a burger but more of a lump of ground beef with no cohesive agent that fell apart upon contact with my mouth.  The entire burger was a soupy mess as the collard greens was not enough to soak up the liquids from inside the burger.  It's never a good sign when your hand is covered with juice and sauce 2 bites into a burger.  Taste was salty, all mushrooms were on a single side of the burger, no good.My husband ordered the Wiki Wiki. Unfortunately the burger came out like a hot mess.  His first reaction was "are they kidding me?"  This was alarming to me as my husband is literally the most non-picky restaurant eater of all time.  He then showed me that the bottom half of the bun had completely disintegrated with liquid - it looked disturbing and almost inedible.  Perhaps it sat on the counter a while as they were making my burger?  We'll never know because there is no way I will ever convince my husband to come back to this establishment.  Ever.
2014-09-18,5,The Southern Caviar with duck bacon instead of country bacon is one of the best non-classic burgers I've ever had. SO good. My bf and I shared that and the Grindhouse. Which was also good but the Southern Caviar stole the spotlight. The rings and fries are a must with the 4 different sauces, all of which we're amazing. My fav is the chipotle mayo but the smoke (BBQ), special, and curry ketchup were all super flavorful.  I would ask for the onion rings on the side though because they lay them on top of the fries, which made our sweet potato fries kind of soggy. The onion rings were amazingly crispy and well seasoned though. The service was great, friendly staff, and the decor was perfect. And BYOB!  Oh, and their snickerdoodle ice cream sandwich is a must try, the caramel sauce drizzled on top is finger licking good.  Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!
2014-09-16,4,Bareburger is a mid-end sit-down burger chain that serves exotic meats and gourmet toppings. They also have sandwiches, salads, sides, and shakes; and are BYOB. Our recent visit on a Sunday evening a few weeks after they opened left me with very little to criticize in terms of food, atmosphere, and service. Our wait time ran about as long as promised and we were greeted by the ridiculously friendly waiter George a few minutes after looking through the menu. It can be a little overwhelming with the infinite choices of burger meat/veggie, toppings, buns, etc but this is one of those places where you have to tell yourself you'll come back again and just commit to something. I had the Buckaroo which had beef patty, brisket, aged cheddar, mushrooms, and smoke sauce on a brioche bun. It was surprisingly not overwhelming for me, which means big eaters will definitely want to fill up on sides. The brisket was a little dry and thin, which was ok on the burger but probably wouldn't be great on the brisket sandwich they also sell. Hubby had the Grindhouse, which is an elk burger with Manchego, country bacon (hubby swapped for duck bacon to maximize unusual animal consumption), and swapped pineapple relish for a fried egg. They offer "sides" or "snacks" and I'd recommend the smaller sides for only 2 people. The onion rings had a seasoned crispy breading and the fries were about middle of the road- medium thick, average doneness. We also got a tiny jar of dill pickles which were cool and tart to counter all the fatty fried meatness of it all. In the few minutes it took the waiter to come back after clearing our dinner plates I decided I didn't want dessert, but the ice cream sandwiches do look great so I'll try next time. Of course there will be a next time, I have to make my way down the menu :)
2014-09-15,2,Honestly, I was expecting more. After trying Umami Burger, my expectations for a great burger have been raised so to get what tastes like a glorified 'Smash Burger' was a bit of a disappointment. Especially considering I had a few pieces of bone in mine which I inadvertently crunched on more than once, kinda signaling to me I shouldn't eat the rest. The pickles and fries are great. Sauces are eh. nothing special. Even Zinburger is better if you can get to clifton. Otherwise, just try umami. mucho delicioso.
2014-09-15,4,This is an excellent spot for some insanely good burgers. I like the hipster feel to the restaurant as you walk in, you really feel like you are in Brooklyn. There prices are a bit high but you are getting quality grass fed, organic/natural meat. They have other meats besides beef and chicken, they have duck, elk, boar, bison, goat, bean, turkey, and sweet potato burgers. I did the make your own burger with goat, duck bacon, pepper jack, on a sprout bun, but the combos are endless with all the choices being different from a typical restaurant. The goat burger was seasoned perfectly, gamy, and the duck bacon added the right amount of fat to tie the burger together. The bun was fresh and soft and really soaked the mess from the burger up. Overall an amazing spot for a great burger, and it is even more impressive that it is a chain.
2014-09-15,3,I've been to BB over 50 times (not joking), all of which were the Mahattan and Queens locations. Was extremely excited that they were opening one in Hobo. Been there 3 times now, seems that the wait staff is still getting their bearings when it comes to the menu. Shocked they changed so much from the other locations. I have celiacs and replacing the tapioca rice bun for the hemp milk bun was a HUGE mistake. One made you feel like you weren't eating GF bread and the other is a harsh reminder of the difference in GF products. The addition of the various bacons was a nice touch tho.
2014-09-13,4,amazing!!! my boyfriend and I saw an add for Hardees burger during football commercial and were craving burgers.  we decided to try bareburger because it was new and we are so glad we decided to try something new instead of going for a usual bae burger. Juicy burgers, good sides, and amazing sauces!!! I am a pickle lover and you have to try the bison burger with sweet pickles!! so good!
2014-09-13,5,BareBurger was amazing!! I've gone two days in a row. Nice touch to Hoboken. Erica and Jorge are amazing waiters. They were very helpful and friendly. This will definitely be my once a week go to when I'm in Hoboken. Gluten Free choices are also a Big Plus!!!
2014-09-12,5,We started with sweet potato fries and the pickle slaw and it was delicious! Especially the sauces! The slaw I wasn't too sure about, but it was recommended by our server and he definitely didn't steer us wrong...Speaking of our waiter, we had Jorge and he was amazing, hands down the best waiter I have ever met, so friendly, accommodating and genuine! Thank you for such a great evening (and with a table of 9, it's never easy to serve a big crowd). The dinner was also amazing, black bean burger is wonderful for vegetarians, if you are not vegan, the brioche bun is very tasty! And to end the evening on a sweet note, one of the girls ordered a vegan carrot cake that I had a bite from and it was delicious. Overall, a great experience and I will definitely come back with friends and family!
2014-09-09,4,The service is horrendous, but the food is stupendous. ;)I ordered a build your own goat burger and they forgot 2 of the 5 things I put on it, and got a 3rd item wrong.  It tasted fantastic, but by the time they returned with the correct burger (which they insisted on correcting), I was basically full from the sweet potato fries.   They also completely forgot, and never brought, my husband's side dish, but still tried to charge us for it at the end.  I noticed they also had to re-do another woman's order next to us. I've never seen a waiter have to apologize so much. He gave us strawberry lemonades to go, which was a nice gesture.I would eat here again because the food is really fantastic and unique, but only if I know I have extra time and patience to deal with the service.
2014-09-08,4,This was a great burger spit, had the Wild Boar Burger which if cooked to much can be very dry. This burger was nothing of the sort. The fries were good not great, but the Onion Rings surely made up for that! All in all solid burger all around!
2014-09-06,5,I love this burger place!very different burger experience, exotic organic meat and awesome combinations of flavors. I got the blue elk burger, first time for me to try elk meat. The burger came with caramelized  onion, blue cheese of course and a fantastic tomato fig jam, perfect addition.I also loved the onion rings!crunchy and super flavorful, huge portion, definitely to share.Will go back to try other variety of meat.
2014-09-06,1,We came here last Sunday for a late lunch with a party of 5 plus a baby. One of the worst dining experiences I have probably had in 10 years. We have been SO looking forward to coming here since we tried bare burger in edgewater. They told us we had a wait of 15-20 min when we arrived. We waited for 45 outside and they kept telling us every 5 minutes they were clearing off a table. No apologies, no nothing. When we were finally seated, they didn't give us menus, and it seemed their air conditioning was broken as well. The service overall sucked which was so disappointing being that we talked up this place to our friends who also have been to the location in BK. Our waiter messed up my husbands order and they brought our appetizers out before they brought out our drinks. Being that it was like 100 degrees inside that would have been nice. My food was really bad. My "burger"was wrapped in kale and it was just not good. It tasted like garbage. It was even harder to eat given series of events leading up to dining. Maybe it was a bad day there, maybe they are just too new and don't have it together yet. I won't be returning to bare burger in Hoboken-- however, the location in Edgewater is well worth the drive.
2014-09-03,4,The Standard Burger with Blue Cheese!!!! Need I say more!!!AND .... ITS BYOB!
2014-09-01,4,I love that, like most places in Hoboken, Bareburger is BYOB. It helps keep the cost of the meal down and it's also nice to just bring whatever you want. The place was packed but the wait time on a Saturday night was only about 10 minutes. Love that they have outdoor seating - always a plus during the warmer months. I stuck with the regular beef burger for my first time so I can't say I got a taste of any of the "different" meats this place is known for but it was still delicious. The only thing I didn't like is that our server was drunk. Like noticeably drunk. It was funny at the beginning of the meal but then as the time went on he was getting drunker and things were just awkward/uncomfortable. The rest of the staff was very friendly but every time our server came around I sort of cringed and hoped he wouldn't stop to chat. I know this location is new so hopefully it's just going through growing pains and the next time I go I won't feel uncomfortable by the end of my meal.Edited to add: our sides also came out a few minutes after our burgers which was a bit of a nuisance. Who wants to eat burgers without fries and vice versa? Again, chalking this up to growing pains but I did hear another table complain about the same issue. Hopefully they will remedy that in the future!
2014-09-01,3,I'd been to the two Bareburgers in Astoria several times over the last few years when I used to live there. Now that I don't, I was excited to try the new Hoboken location if it meant I'd be able to get the same quality delicious burgers around here.This location has a unique menu, which is cool. But the burger patty here (beef, which I always get) was nowhere near as good as the ones I'd had at Astoria's Bareburgers. I'm not knowledgeable enough about burger preparation to know if it was simply overcooked, or if the patty was also too densely packed, or even if the meat itself is different quality. I'd ordered medium rare, and the meat was juiceless, dense, thin, and mostly grey inside. The toppings were good and almost made up for the dry, overcooked patty, but I didn't come here for a dry, overcooked patty, so it was disappointing.Also, the prices seemed pretty strange. I ordered the Grindhouse, which comes with elk, and I asked for it with beef instead. Somehow, this made the burger cost over $2 more, even though elk is the more expensive meat on the menu and I wasn't told substituting beef would bump up the price at all, let alone that much. What was an $11.90 burger on the menu turned into a $14.10 burger on the receipt, just because I got beef instead of elk.On the bright side, the fries, dipping sauces, and burger toppings were very good. The drinks (non-alcoholic) were good too but way too heavy on the ice.
2014-08-30,3,I type this...still full from my bison burger.This place is hipster-fabulous. Table service. BYOB. We started with "rings & sweets" (onion rings and sweet potato fries duh). They come with 4  sauces. I COULD NOT get enough of the ginger curry ketchup. The bison burger was very good with the same ginger curry ketchup with pickled red onions and green tomatoes. The thing that kind of threw us off? Keep your eye on the add ons...which ADD ON. My fiancé's burger (a beef burger with cheese and bacon) ended up being $18 without any sides. But try it ya'll! Live it up.
2014-08-27,3,I was so excited to try their food I love how attentive and nice the staff is its a little pricey but the burger quality is good considering its organic and free range
2014-08-23,5,We were planning to eat elsewhere, but we passed Bareburger and were attracted by their awning which advertised natural, organic, grass-fed options. Since these types of restaurants are harder to come by in NJ, we decided to check the place out. The hostess was friendly and gave us some great suggestions on what to order. We were seated after a quick wait, and our server was very friendly as well. The decor is charming and artsy, making for a cool dining atmosphere. I got the Farmstead "burger" and loved how it was wrapped in collards. The sweet potato and rice patty was delicious and came with a side of really good cauliflower hummus. The person I was with tried bison for the first time with the El Matador burger and loved it. The burger came with a surprising amount of toppings, which included guacamole, queso fresco, and jalapeños. Even the condiments on the table were healthy alternatives to conventional ketchup and mustard. We also ordered two sides - dill pickles and baby kale salad - to share. The portion size for the pickles was generous, and the salad had some beautiful heirloom cherry tomatoes. For dessert, we ordered the Bare Standard Sammie - vanilla ice cream sandwiched between two chocolate chip cookies. The ice cream was amazing and probably some of the best vanilla ice cream I've ever had. I would recommend this restaurant but do have some criticisms. We waited close to 30 minutes for our food. This is understandable though since it was pretty busy when we came. Also, I would have liked to see a side accompany the burger without having to order separately. Since organic ingredients tend to be more expensive, though, it makes sense for them to charge extra. In spite of these minor points, I will definitely be back if I'm in the area again.
2014-08-22,1,The food is good but the management and staff don't know there own menu. They state things are gluten free, but NOTHING is gluten free at Bareburger. When questioned about the fryer for their advertised gluten free French fries , we learned that breaded products are also put in this fryer. This is not the worst part, when we questioned the manager they did not know why mixing gluten and non-gluten food in same fryer was an issue. When we asked the staff if there gluten free bun was toasted in separately from the other buns they responded that they were not but not to worry the buns are gluten free. This is irresponsible by the restaurant.
2014-08-21,4,Having been to the Bareburger in Edgewater, I had a pretty good idea as to what to expect. Like another reviewer, I got the Cowboy Caviar and was only moderately impressed. The burger was pretty flavorful - I asked for it Medium and was pleasantly surprised to see that it came out on the Medium-Rare end of the Medium spectrum (which was my hope). The toppings were also flavorful, and complemented the Bison burger well without any one item being too overpowering. However, the burger was only lukewarm, and the toppings didn't seem to be that fresh (ie the bacon had probably been cooked hours before... it was limpish and not hot). Fries were good. The curry ketchup and special sauce both complemented well.Service was 'eh.' Quite friendly, but not that attentive, and forgot our request for a bottle opener at least 3 times (and 15 minutes that we were forced to stare at our unopened beers...). This, along with the decent burger would incline me to give Bareburger 3 stars, but I trust that like most other restaurants the waitstaff will continue to improve and train. While I don't know if the burgers will get dramatically better, I know that the variety is truly impressive, and the price - for a pretty good meal - is about as good as it gets for outdoor seating in Hoboken. BYOB
2014-08-21,4,I've been living in Hoboken for almost 7 years now and one thing it sorely misses is a place that has any actual vegan options.  When I saw that Bareburger was opening up on Washington Street I was very excited.  Bareburger normally has acceptable vegan options but the one in Hoboken has a whole new menu!I ordered the Mazuma sandwich which was smoked tempeh, wasabi carrot slaw, pineapple relish, crispy lotus root, and alfalfa on a sprout bun. To be honest- I was kinda skeptical, but when the sandwich came out my tune quickly changed. It was amazing!  I highly recommend it.  I can't wait to go back again and try all the other vegan options on the menu.  Kudos to Bareburger Hoboken!
2014-08-19,5,I love a good burger.  I also try to be conscious of eating natural, organic, non-GMO foods, but that is nearly impossible when going out to eat because you usually have no idea where the food comes from.  Enter: BareburgerNot only do they offer excellent food with a variety of unusual burger meats (such as elk, wild boar, goat, and bison), but everything is also grass-fed, organic, non-GMO.  It's nice to know they did the work for you so you don't have to worry about the ingredients. The burgers are maybe $1-$2 more than you would spend for a burger at most other restaurants in town, but that is to be expected since they are using superior ingredients.  We felt the prices were very fair for what we were getting.  The burgers were ample size (though I would have liked a little more meat), they were smothered with toppings, and the buns were excellent too.Their entire menu is full of items that are out of the ordinary.  From the cheeses, to the different types of bacon, to the bun selection, to the drinks (non-alcoholic), to the desserts, to the vegetarian options...you can tell they put a lot of thought into everything.  I had the "Southern Caviar" burger and my wife had the "Wiki Wiki".  We loved them both.They've done a great job with the interior.  When you step inside, you don't feel like you're in Hoboken anymore.  Maybe somewhere in the south or the midwest, but definitely not Hoboken.  Very few places in town give you that type of immersive experience.We were unsure about whether to get the "side" of onion rings, or the "snack" size which is much larger and double the price.  We're glad we went with the "side" because it had 6 large onion rings which was plenty for us.  If I have to nit-pick one thing, I would say that the onion rings were too heavily breaded, and I would have preferred them to be battered instead of breaded anyway.  But everything else was great, and I can't wait to try everything on their menu (especially the shakes).  They really paid attention to every little detail, from the atmosphere to every item on the menu.  It's nice to see a restaurant that is truly unique in so many ways.  Looks like I have a new go-to burger place.
2014-08-19,2,After months of eagerly awaiting the opening of Bareburger, I must admit that I was a bit disappointed.The Burger was OK. I ordered the Cowboy Caviar.  It came out looking slightly unimpressive- not brimming with copious toppings and lukewarm. They forgot the bacon (which  was excellent) but they were fast to bring out a new burger. My friend had the Grindhouse, which she seemed pretty pleased with, but agreed it could use a bit more sauce/ toppings. The sweet fries and rings were good, as well as the milkshake. The highlight of the meal was the variety of dipping sauces. Service was OK and food came out fast. I would recommend stopping in to try it out, but I don't think this will be one of my Hoboken staples.
2014-08-18,2,Ehh very overpriced greasy burgers that are not that big. If you want anything on the burger be prepared to pay for it...twofold. I would much rather go to a diner and get a massive bacon cheese burger for almost half the price of this place. I don't understand what all the rage is about. I think its just one of those places that people blindly like because everyone else does. Not horrible but I have had much better.
2014-08-18,5,The five stars might be because Bareburger is still in the honeymoon phase.The food is delicious, much like all the other bareburgers, and it's relatively healthy for what it is.  Bareburger.com has all the nutrition facts as well, so you can preplan your dinner before hand, or if you log all your food like I do, its really easy to get a detailed list of what you're eating. For the area, its actually one of the cheaper places to get a real dinner, the other good place being Stacks, which is across the street.  All the other area restaurants are much closer to $20-$30/person.  This place is closer to $10-15.  The atmosphere and decor is nice as well, and its something different in Hoboken.
2014-08-18,5,It is indeed a rarity when a newly opened restaurant hits a home run...nay...a grand slam.  I have been to Bareburger in the city and I do love their burgers and atmosphere. The whole organic, grass fed, hand massaged meat is really something I could care less about, but if the meat is tasty and delicious, I'm all about it.We came on a Friday night and it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be, probably because many don't know they've opened. Anyways, the outdoor seating was small so we just took a table inside. Did I mention this location is BYOB...yeah so there's that.The manager was extremely friendly and brought us an ice bucket for our beer and shot the shit with us for a bit even though the restaurant was filling up a bit.  The waiter was also great. He asked us if we had been before, and we told him to the city locations. Well, apparently this location has a completely different menu than the others...win.I ordered the Blue Elk...I had never had elk before so why the hell not?!  It was out of this world, a perfect balance on everything and cooked medium perfectly. The fig jam, bacon and bleu cheese just made this burger on point. We ordered the rings and fries. The fries were good, just fries, but the onion rings were absolutely delicious! They give you a variety of sauces for dipping. I liked them all except the curry ketchup. But that's because I find curry absolutely disgusting. If you like curry you'll love it. The wife got a turkey burger which was also fantastic. I was amazed at how great the service and timeliness of everything was. The food came out perfect and in a reasonable time frame, which is rare for new places. They were firing on all cylinders and their customer service was excellent. I will likely be here once a week....if not more.
2014-08-17,5,Okay, honestly I considered giving this spot a 1 star review so that I would always be guaranteed a table when I showed up a minimum of once a week, but that's not fair considering the quality of this fantastic restaurant! I am a huge fan of Bareburger Manhattan locations; I often frequented the LaGuardia Place location. This one has unique menu options specific to Hoboken, but the quality is superb either side of the Hudson! I ordered the Grindhouse - the elk has delicious, the bacon was thick and flavorful, and the manchego... don't even get me started. It was a divine combination. My family and I shared the Fries and Onion Rings Snack (AKA a shareable side), which comes with the delectable sauces - curry ketchup, smoke sauce, special sauce, and habanero mayo.Of course, I always recommend ordering a milkshake, made with NYC's own Blue Marble organic ice cream. My favorite milkshake IN THE WORLD is their chocolate/raspberry! Heavenly! My dad enjoyed the bananas foster milkshake very much. Our server, George, was charming, excited, and grateful! He really rounded out what turned out to be a wonderful meal.Consider me a regular!
2014-08-14,5,Great food and service. Love the "build your own burger". Quality food for a good price. Casual rustic ambiance with outdoor seating. And it's BYOB!
2014-08-12,4,For a place that just opened, the service was excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed my Grindhouse burger, although it could've been just a bit warmer. The shakes are delicious, too. I'd go back again to try their fries, onion rings, etc. but it's just too darn expensive. $18 for a shake and a burger, not counting the tip, is crazy in a town that has Five Guys, Johnny Rocket's, Boardwalk, Slider Street, etc. I understand their ingredients are more exotic and probably fresher, but it's still tough to justify regular visits.
