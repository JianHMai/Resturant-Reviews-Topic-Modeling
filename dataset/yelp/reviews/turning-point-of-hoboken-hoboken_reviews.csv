2021-11-07,1,Unable to get my order right and what did arrive was completely wrong. Tried contacting restaurant with no luck. Stay away
2021-10-31,1,I absolutely love the Turning Point for their food but unfortunately the service at the Hoboken location really let me down. As a Hoboken food blogger, I love to rave about places afterwards but in this case I really cannot. Me and my boyfriend went for breakfast this morning and his food just never came. We were very patient, even mentioned it (really nicely) to the server 3 times but it still never left the kitchen. We are very understanding and are very aware that restuarants are short staffed but having to mention it 3 times is unacceptable. We ended up asking for it to please be taken off the bill after 30+ minutes of sitting there hoping it would come. My boyfriend ended up eating my leftovers and we left, not sure I would return.
2021-10-30,2,Honestly, we were highly disappointed with the food here. We ordered the strawberry cheesecake French toast which stated it came with strawberry reduction however when we received it, it came with just a few slices of strawberry, a very light drizzle of cream cheese frosting and no strawberry reduction. We asked the waiter and he stated the strawberry components were the sliced strawberries on it. We had to ask him if there was a strawberry compote, reduction or glaze in which he said it was a syrup and brought us out some. The basic skillet so exactly what it sounds like.... BASIC... nothing special about it. And for a side of bacon, they charge $4 for 4 pieces. Two stars because we had some really good, strong coffee we had the NJ Beast Blend (or something like that) in the French press which was like $8 and we got about 4 cups of coffee from it. Overall, there's really nothing special here. The menu and everything on it sounds really good but when it's time to deliver they come really short on it.
2021-10-17,3,One of the best things about Turning Point is the pretty view of the Hudson. I ordered a frozen hot chocolate with marshmallow syrup and Graham cracker dust. It was tasty but the smores flavor was not very pronounced. I also ordered a goat cheese omelet. The flavor was underwhelming and I did not enjoy the texture. The English muffin it came with was tasty. My friend ordered vegan pancakes and she enjoyed them but said they were nothing special. Overall the food was okay, but nothing special. If I'm in the area for brunch I may go back but I would not go out of my way to eat at Turning Point.
2021-09-29,3,Very slow service, it took them 15 minutes to realize that we were waiting for them to place an order. We went there at 8 am and they weren't busy. The utensils were not clean. The view is nice.
2021-09-26,3,I love this place but unfortunately the time management is not great. We were told a specific time to come back. After waiting for almost an hour we were told there were still 15 parties ahead of us. It's just disappointing. I know they have no control over how much time people spend eating but they should be more courteous to the customers waiting. It's definitely not a place to go if you have a strict time schedule.
2021-09-26,2,Chose Turning Point of Hoboken because of our great experience in another state. Knowing how parking is in Hoboken we chose the pickup option. I had difficulty adjusting my order through the Uber Eats app so I called it in. It took 3 calls to get someone, however, the individual was ver courteous. It seems this location is primarily for the locals. Parking is practically nonexistent (even on a late Tuesday morning). There is no signage, which made pick up slightly confusing. I entered through the restaurant but was then told to walk through to the other side for pickup. My order was waiting in the pick up area. There wasn't anyone on this side of the restaurant when I walked through. I noticed the receipt stapled to the bag had a QR code to scan and pay. I had began the process when I noticed a young lady had come to the register and was now watching me. The only greeting I received was "you can pay here". When I said I had begun the process to pay by phone, she politely stared until she received confirmation on her end. This made me admittedly uncomfortable because the woman that entered behind me simply grabbed her bag and exited. Aside from the awkward introduction, our food - what we received that was correct was ok. I specifically asked for an order of grits by saying, "do you have grits? May I add that to my order?" After confirming, you can appreciate my disappointment when I opened the bag and noticed I received a side of Turkey lunch meat - no grits. My lasting impression was the Walk on the Beach (juice). It was surprisingly sweet and delicious. It was wrapped perfectly for a takeout order.
2021-09-11,5,Awesome place to have brunch on a lazy Saturday. It was my first time having shashuka and it was so filling. The purple rain drink is a must. It was tart and smooth. And this place was dog friendly. The waitress gave my dog water and offered whipped cream. The only thing is that the wait was long if you want to get an outdoor seating.
2021-09-06,5,I was out for my morning walk and decided to treat myself to a breakfast at the Turning Point. I walked in at 7:40 without realizing they did not open until 8am, but the staff seated me right away without hesitation. The food and coffee were excellent, but above all the service was outstanding. If I could give 10 stars to Jennifer I would. She is extremely knowledgeable, compassionate, and attentive. She's a team player with her colleagues and pays very close attention to detail - she definitely goes the extra mile in everything she does!!
2021-09-02,3,Nice brunch vibe.I  been here multiple time and always order basic skillet with the english muffin and Belgian waffles. This time I tried their avocado toast it's good too. My friend had a chicken pesto panini sandwich and cookies and cream cold brew. I highly recommend their milkshakes( Strawberry) which I loved to the core. And the amazing view of skyline is cherry on the top.
2021-08-29,4,Yes its a long wait on the weekends and yes it takes long for the food to come out. But staff is friendly and food is really good and well priced. I got a huge vegan omelette packed with caramelized onions, broccoli, squash and kale. It was delicious. I am not strictly vegan so I wasn't too concerned but I'm pretty sure even though it was vegan egg it was cooked in butter. But if you are vegan def ask. I got bread on the side and it was ehh. Nothing special. My friends iced vanilla chai was super super sweet and tasted lile cinnamon toast crunch to me. But she liked it. I got the moroccan tea bag and it was just green tea and wasn't that special or strong. I was surprised for sandwiches they don't have French fries, seems pretty standard.I would def come back for omelettes again or something with fruit on it since it looks like they put a lot of fresh fruit on the waffles and pancakes.
2021-08-28,1,While vacationing in the area with family we searched around for a breakfast restaurant during our stay. After our second day in the area we came across this spot and we felt delighted. Not only we ordered the perfect breakfast all around but the waitress was also so good to us, in fact she spoiled us with her tender and humble service. I believe she was of a Hispanic decent, which reminded me of the people in Chile when I worked abroad. I told her, we're coming here for BK from now on, and off course we would returned the next morning. Sure enough the next morning there we were walking through the door, but that same waitress was not present that day so we got seated by a different waitress whom didn't appear to care to even greet us. After we sat down I looked forward for a refreshing glass of water with lime in a pinch to start off with, but instead it was served in individual glass, no pitch and no lime. Meanwhile, everyone else had a pitch off water with lime. That same person also took our order for the drinks, yet when the kids got their drinks it was all wrong. Soon after we got another waitress, I guess she was the one to take our food order. When the food came out my wife and I still had not coffee. I immediately told her that I can't have BK without my coffee. After a king wait she finally brought it out but it was not the coffee we asked for. She was all over the place, like a chicken without a head. Eventually when she got the coffee right I looked over and noticed my youngest son had no food yet so we waited and waited, but soon decided to feed him from my plate. Actually, four officers happened to be in the same room with us and couldn't believe what was happening to us as they looked over, in fact they expressed their sympathy for the bad service. The waitress wouldn't even give us napkins. This service went from bad to terrible and one of worse service ever received. It was like fighting the enemy that I never once new, while wearing a shirt that said "be kind."This was so misleading! You have been warned! Review posted in good faith...
2021-08-21,4,It's a nice spot and a beautiful view of the skyline. They were definitely short staffed as other places are but it was still nice service. The food was good too, we had the Southern Chicken and Waffles, OMG French Toast, and the Berry and Banana Stuffed French Toast. The southern chicken and waffles was our favorite out of the three.
2021-08-13,5,I really liked the place, server was very nice,coffee was delicious and food was pretty good! I would come back for sure!
2021-08-08,1,I made a reservation for 4 people and 3 of us were able to make it however the manager (i think her name is Brenda) told us we can sit if all parties are here because otherwise she can't give us the table. Even tough we told her that we will start ordering right away, she gave us an attitude and turned our Sunday breakfast to a nightmare.  If it is to save tables for big parties, it doesn't make sense because on a rectangular table if 3 people can fit, 4 people can definitely fit.Very unprofessional hospitality.. i would not come back here ever again..!!!
2021-07-31,5,My very first time here and I loved it. The scrambled eggs with cheese was amazing and to top it off the OMG French Toast was AMAZING!
2021-07-20,3,Yum, love egg shells in my sandwich . Turning point has been slacking ! This used to be my favorite spot but their quality of food is just pure laziness at this point
2021-07-11,5,We were in the area recently for a wedding. My daughter-in-law found The Turning Point on Yelp and it was within walking distance of our hotel. We had a short wait and were seated at a window table with an amazing view. Our party of four adults and an almost 3-year-old had a hard time deciding what to order. The menu looked amazing. Let's just say that no one was disappointed with their selection! Service and atmosphere are laid back. We would definitely visit again the next time we are in the area.
2021-07-10,2,Horrible horrible service! Placed an order at 12 today and the pick up guy checked at 1:30 and said it still wasn't ready! Ok, it's up to the customers to follow up with the restaurant to see if the food is ready. Fine. Called turning point THREE times and been transferred to NOWHERE (the operator said "let me transfer you to cafe" then silence). What kind of service is that?We had to rely on the uber eats driver to check the progress of our food. Guess what? Our delivery person told us the waitress said they gave our order to the WRONG pickup guy! They had to make it at 1:30pm! Two hours wait and it's the customer's fault to get their brunch at 2? Shouldn't you check with the order when someone shows up to pick the food??? In summary, 2 things that are unacceptable:1. The phone transfer is just a decoration, you can never actually get through to a real restaurant staff to check up on your order after close to TWO hours 2. The restaurant staff is supposed to bear the responsibilities of handling the correct order, not your customers. Used to order from there. But won't again!
2021-06-28,5,I heard about this place for a really long time and I finally went here and I'm happy I did finally good. You can't beat the location one bit. This place is always being voted the best breakfast spot in NJ.
2021-06-27,5,Best. Be prepared for an extremely long wait. It is still my favourite brunch spot in Hoboken.
2021-06-23,5,This place has my heart! I can do brunches here any day and it never fails to disappoint me!
2021-06-13,3,I had a serious craving for some diner food when I noticed Turning Point on DoorDash. They had delivery listed as a 40ish minute wait and the menu sounded delicious. I decided to order from here mostly for the short delivery window. When we placed our order at 11:30 and once it was confirmed the wait time shot up to an hour and 15. That's 100% an issue with the app and not the restaurant itself. Our food arrived at 12:45 which to be fair was exactly how long they had estimated. No faults there. Unfortunately, by the time the driver got here everything was cold. While I'm not against microwaving food, the idea of nuking eggs just doesn't sound appetizing. Even after heating everything up the potatoes were still very undercooked. While I appreciated the small touches like grass fed butter both packets were smooshed and left a greasy mess in the bag. My power grain pancakes were okay albeit a little grainy. I'm sure these taste better in person. On the other hand, my partners Wilbur skillet came with an uncooked English muffin and had maybe a single eggs worth of scrambles. While we love bacon, there seemed to be more of it than actual egg. In retrospect, had I known how popular of a brunch spot they are I probably would've ordered from somewhere else since the weekend rush sounds insane. We both agreed this is probably a good spot to eat in person despite the meh experience with delivery.
2021-06-13,3,My partner ordered breakfast from here via DoorDash. Originally the app said 40 minutes and, honestly, that's why she chose it (I think). Once the order was confirmed it jumped to 60 minutes. This is a DoorDash issue with communication with the restaurant. So we sat and waited hangrily while they took their time to deliver it to us 2 miles away (could've walked there and back in less time). By the time our food arrived everything was cold and soggy, which is less than ideal. My English muffin was just somehow moist. Not even warm- moist. And it wasn't toasted? My skillet was okay but it lacked any basic seasonings like salt and pepper. The base flavors were there, but it wasn't good. Also, my skillet only had one scrambled egg, which, financially speaking, doesn't make sense. Why would their be more bacon than egg? It costs more and takes up less space. More egg would've been cheaper and more satisfying than what appeared to be .25 lbs of thin cut bacon (which I'm sure people would love). On top of that, my skillet had maybe 3 slices of avocado which was now heated, covered in cheese, and the. Brought back down to room temp. If that sentence made you gag a bit, I'm sorry. My partner's pancakes were okay, but the texture was very weird. Also, have you ever had soggy pancakes? Not ideal. Perhaps this would've been better in person, but from what I've read, the service is equally slow there. At least it wouldn't be cold and might be good?
2021-06-03,5,Friendly staff clean environment. you can't go wrong with the Popeye skillet eggs mushrooms spinach potatoes absolutely delicious!
2021-05-31,5,Great brunch spot and amazing views! Got a ton of food and very reasonably priced! Recommend sharing the pancake flight!
2021-05-19,1,Good food but the worlds slowest service! I have been here about 15 times and the service is awful. I keep trying to give them another chance and the service is slower every time I come. I suggest you order to go food and eat at home.
2021-05-08,5,Brunch with a view.  Came here for brunch on a weekday morning and enjoyed a nice unrushed brunch.  Food is pretty standard.  Portions were large.
2021-05-02,5,This place has amazing food and service. Karen and Vicky were so sweet and gave amazing customer service. Will definitely come back. Thank you!
2021-04-22,4,This place is sublime, quiet, and quaint. At first glance it will appear to be two separate brick and mortars but, that because it is separated into different stores. One side for those patrons that adore the indoor dinning experience, and then there is the café, equipped to handle the demand of those "grab-n-go" custys. Appearance is clean and the atmosphere is peaceful coupled with the view of NY over the Hudson, this is a great place to wind up before heading in to the bustling city, or when prepping for a clairvoyant and progressive day on the clock.
2021-04-22,5,Ultimate fav little hidden gem. I don't think I've ever had anything here I DONT love. Chicken & waffles-- that gravy is to DIE for. The huevos rancheros, wow. It's the chorizo & always fresh cilantro for meeee. Then the pancakes. Any kind. Any flavor. They won't disappoint. Also BYOB sooo does it get any better? No. (There's a liq store around the corner, btw)
2021-04-18,1,Came here because we have the gift card. Was toldThe wait time at that point is 1h 15, but we wanted a booth table and agree to wait longer than usual wait time, so I waited 1 hr and 42minutes then they sit us at a regular table in the walk way. I told them that I requested for the booth then they told me they sat everyone else already so I have to wait 30 minutes for the booth if I want it. It is very disrespectful to be promised one thing then was given no choice for the table, feel like being tricked and wasted my morning. If I wanted just a regular table, I should have chose that and got it in 1h 15 mins.Other that that, food is great and the waitress are very nice and taken care of us well.
2021-04-18,3,The food here is exceptionally tasty; however, on three separate occasions I ordered breakfast and multiple items have been missing. It's unfortunate to have to wait around two hours and then not get what you ordered. If the issue is fulfilling the entire order you should call the customer and let them know and ask them if they still want the food. I'm sad I have to rate this place so poorly.
2021-04-08,5,Amazing diner, so clean and the staff is so kind. Food is great! Amazing views of city skyline from the tables!
2021-04-02,2,There are times in your life's experience when you come across an undesirable individual...The Turning Point hostess is that person "Brenda" rude,obnoxious and absolutely shouldn't be working in the restaurant industry.  As quote on your coffee cup & tee shirt "Be Kind" Beside that our waitress Vanessa was very delightful and the breakfast is always delicious. I would have rated it a 4 star but you can thank the hostess.
2021-04-01,4,I came here responding to all the hype. I will say this little turning point is very pleasing to the eyes. Most of the tables you will have a beautiful view of the pier and the restaurant itself is very modern with a nautical decor palette. Getting to the food, I have to admit I expected more. Being that I am a Benny connoisseur (in my own little world lol) We tried two of their Bennys andI have to say it was they were not memorable. Any restaurant that learns how to make the little potato cubes that often come with this dish less dry and more appealing they will do everyone a great service! Their coffee was bitter and hot to the point where you burn your tongue off. Dangerously hot! We had to wait u til being done with our meals before taking a good sip. The redeeming  dish was the lemon blue berry pancakes. One of the best fresh made pancakes I've had at a brunch spot. The lemon flavor was subtle and deliciously delicate. Fresh lemon zest and blue berries were sprinkled on top and that made me smile! I'll be back to try the rest of their flavors, indeed!
2021-03-31,2,Very tasty food! But we put our names on a waiting list at 10:55 am... got to the restaurant at 11:40 we were told we would be seated by 11:45. Waited another hour to get seated. The wait staff were lovely... however the host.. that young boy... he was rude to other customers and started talking badly about them as soon as they walked away... in front of other customers! I overheard him saying that a customer was being dramatic for being upset because she hasn't been seated in 2 hours either... very unprofessional and uncomfortable.Update 4/19/21- I was told to contact an email.. I did on 4/2/21 and have yet to hear back!
2021-03-30,4,Great place for brunch! Amazing view. We had Benedict eggs, they were great. Coffee was better than expected. Service was a bit slow but the view is worth it. One of the few spots that offer brunch during the week. It's unfortunate that don't have liquor.
2021-03-29,5,Love love love the Huevos Rancheros! We usually get them without the huge tortilla and substitute it with toast.  A great option for non-meat eaters since they can simply keep the chorizo off.  Potatoes are lightly crisp and every single bite is well seasoned throughout.  May not be the best for other popular breakfast dishes but if you want the best Huevos Rancheros in town, come here.
2021-03-25,3,My sisters and I dined here in March 2021. Let me start off by saying that the view of NYC from this restaurant is absolutely breathtaking! Incredible! There is limited seating so getting a booth by the window was not possible for us. We were seated in the tiny room by the hostess stand away from the main dinning room and our waiter seemed to have forgotten about us. The service was extremely slow. I tried to order a latte with soy milk but was told that I cannot substitute the milk since the lattes are pre-made. This was confusing to me because the menu list milk alternatives. We also ordered two skillets and the strawberry cheesecake French toast. The skillets were okay, nothing to rave about. The strawberry cheesecake French toast was delicious!
2021-03-06,5,The food and coffee is great! Vanessa is the best she took take of us. So welcoming there
2021-02-27,1,Another disappointing event at this venue and unfortunately this is before I received my food. This is for Yelp, for double charging me and making me feel like an idiot in the establishment when I was charged twice and couldn't receive my food. No orders shall be placed through this app ever again and it will be deleted following this post. These apps are beginning to become very nefarious in there ways of attracting and collecting not just info but your dividends, without any real accountability. I now have payed 100$ for breakfast because I'm hungry and Yelp did not help. No stars... wouldn't let me post without putting one.
2021-02-21,5,Typical Hoboken hipster restaurant.  The predictable one hour wait which is frustrating but the exceptional service, fresh, delicious food and relatively fair price for trendy Frank Sinatra / Hoboken restaurant helped make the experience of having to wait a bit more tolerable.  Without a doubt I'd return on a weekday but I will never ever go again during the weekend!  I simply don't have the time and patience to wait for an hour, much less during a cold winter day, just for food.
2021-02-16,4,What an adorable spot with great food, right on the water! Terrific service and a beautiful view. I highly recommend joining their "waitlist" on YELP. When I joined, it said a 45 minute wait, which turned into about a 2 hours. Luckily, they have a convenient and tech savvy waitlist that notifies you when your table is ready. The pancakes were delish and i'll definitely be back for more!
2021-02-09,5,Best place in Hoboken ! Been here so many time , love love love their amazing breakfast And ofcourse view ! Such a great place to hang around Hoboken area
2021-02-02,5,Love this place. Love the view. The food is great. Ordered the OMG French Toast, the Chicken and Waffles and the Salted Caramel Waffles--all came out delicious. Staff is welcoming and attentive. Definitely going back there soon. Thank you guys!
2021-01-31,5,This place is super cute and the food is so good! The coffee is in huge mugs! Love that who doesn't haha well I'll post the photos most definitely going back!
2021-01-31,5,Such a great brunch spot! The staff is friendly and attentive. There is usually such a long wait on the weekends, but definitely worth the wait. Pictured is the flight of pancakes which were SO good!! The menu is huge there is lots to choose from.
2021-01-24,5,My favorite spot for brunch or early breakfast. Excellent service. food is amazing salted caramel waffles are a must try.
2021-01-15,1,I emailed at the given address and no one EVER reached out to me. So no one  cares aboht your experience or review here. It is just for the sake of show off. Terrible and the worst
2021-01-05,5,One of my favorite places it has not let me down the food is always amazing the only down side to this place is a long wait but the yummy food makes it all worth it.  Also, don't forget it's BYOB.
2021-01-04,3,I have been to the turning point for brunch at least twice and I must say this place is okay and convenient. When we want breakfast and don't know where to go this place is it. However, last time I went I didn't have a great of an experience just like the previous time. We waited super long to get seated and we kept on seeing how other people kept on getting seated before us even though we were there first. I was a little annoyed. Then, since we got seated the waiter kept on forgetting about us and when it was time to ask for the check we had to go looking for him. The food was okay, I had the Eggs Benefit and a fresh orange juice. I must say the fresh orange juice was my favorite part because I wasn't impressed by the eggs benefits. I have had better in other places.
2021-01-03,4,This is a very fancy brunch place sitting right in the middle of the Hoboken downtown and it is right on the water. Although the wait times are long over the weekend even during the holidays or cold wintry days, turning point is accommodating to their best ability. We were supposed to be seated in 45 minutes however it took about an hour and a half to finally get a seat. Thankfully on the day we went there, the weather was not too bad and we spent sometime near the water. The food was good especially the Nutella donuts. Inside was very cold and there's an opportunity for them to invest in some more heating.
2021-01-02,4,Went for a Saturday afternoon brunch with my girlfriend, service was fantastic and the food came out quick. Wasn't the best brunch we ever had but i would recommend to a friend if you're looking for a place with good city views and a nice atmosphere.
2020-12-30,3,Had a late breakfast here and it was pretty good. Good bacon and the fight of cold pressed juices were very good but the Bourbon Walnut Banana pancakes were really just plain pancakes with toppings, but with the walnuts or bananas cooked in, so they were underwhelming. The service was great and they have a great view, so not too bad.
2020-12-27,1,There is something fundamentally wrong with Turning point's business philosophy and conduct - we have never encountered anything like this in Hoboken.We put the order in on Turning point website, paid service fee, delivery fee and tip, and we got the wrong delivery.  Upon calling Turning Point, the woman who identified herself as manager said they have no responsibility for this issue and that the driver is at fault for taking the wrong package.  They asked us to re-order or pick up, and that they cannot refund us any of the service or delivery fees, nor help track what went wrong.  What surprises us about this is two things:1. Turning point takes no responsibility for the use of a delivery partner to execute their business.  They feel no need to review their partner or take any corrective actions.  They completely wash their hands of this business decision.2.  Turning point feels no need to apologize to their customer.  The manager told us they have no part in this issue and it is solely with the delivery partner.  They have no need to take any corrective actions such as making sure the packages are labeled correctly and minimizes delivery error.3. When we asked for compensation for the frustration we have been through, and their attitude towards 1 and 2 above, they said they cannot give any refund beyond the food total and that we are welcome to leave a review.
2020-12-26,5,COVID Update: I've come a couple of times before but this is my first time going since the Pandemic started. The place was very clean. There is a sign on bathroom door for two people max inside. It was a party of two and we were seated right away. The restaurant is BYOB. They're breakfast never disappoints. We had omelettes and there is a build your own omelette as well. They have delicious fluffy pancakes. The waiter was polite and attentive to our table. I will definitely the returning!
2020-12-20,5,I've never had a bad meal at Turning Point and I've eaten there a lot! Between their amazing coffee, sometimes I order there just for the coffee, to their large portion entrees, they've got it all.Some of my favorites are the low country shrimp hash bowl (so full of flavor), big easy benedict (the cornbread is such a great base) and the seaside jersey club (one of my favorite club sandwiches). I used to eat here before the pandemic but I've ordered a few times since the pandemic started and either in the restaurant or as a to-go order the food is still wonderful.
2020-12-20,4,Came here for brunch and thoroughly enjoyed it. The food was good. I got the skillet with eggs and potatoes. My boyfriend got the heuvos rancheros. We both enjoyed our meal. We liked that they used chicken chorizo. The latte I got was ok as well. They did a good job with safety protocols during covid as well. Good food and friendly staff. Nothing exceptional.
2020-12-08,4,I was debating whether or not to give Turning Point a 4 or a 5. The view was so great, right next to pier 13 on the water. The food wasn't too pricey and I really enjoyed my meal. I went Friday during covid and so it wasn't super busy which I appreciated during these rough times, they have plexiglass which makes me feel pretty safe too. I've been here previously on weekends and the wait was long and the parking situation isn't the best so I wouldn't suggest a large group on a weekend. Vibe is chill.
2020-11-24,4,A solid 4 stars! This place was pretty decent. I got the OMG french toast and the low country shrimp hash bowl. The french toast was kinda meh but the hash bowl was sooo good. I was a bit shocked at how good the hash bowl was It had tons of flavor in each bite and the cornbread that it came with was really tasty. If you come here you should def get this! The iced chai cafe also wasn't too bad!
2020-11-17,5,One of my favorite spots for brunch in Hoboken.  Everything here was excellent.  Great social distancing, felt totally safe dining here.
2020-11-08,1,If I could provide 1/3 star I would! Disgusting! Me and my boyfriend ordered delivery food and unfortunately received not-fresh disgusting things!  They forgot to cook all vegetables that weren't fresh at all. The potato in my food was at least cooked yesterday or even before!! The cheese and eggs smelled really bad! If you don't wanna poison yourself don't order food from this place!
2020-11-08,1,Wilbur Skillet was cold, eggs over cooked and the potatoes were old.  English muffin wasn't toasted and seemed old as well.Low Country Shrimp Hash was also made with old potatoes and poached eggs were overdone.Classic Pork Roll Sammy was completely over cooked to the point where the cheese was burnt into the egg.Overall bad experience with the delivery and won't be ordering again.
2020-11-06,5,My breakfast was great! Came with so much food  yay!  My favorite kinda place! You gained a new customer
2020-11-03,5,Host was friendly, waitress was great, food was on point, and got a table by the window with a nice view.
2020-11-01,3,Got the big easy Benedict. I ordered it on DoorDash so it was cold when it got here but that's just the distance. What I did have a problem with is that the potatoes were so burnt and crunchy I thought I would chip my tooth on them. Seriously, these potatoes were so hard that if you threw them at your enemies, you could knock them out cold. Besides the flavorless calcified rocks, the rest of it was pretty tasty! I also got the Salted Caramel Mochachino and that was delicious! Mixed feelings overall.
2020-10-28,4,I came here with two of my friends for a late lunch on a Sunday. I ordered a Martha's salad and some chicken sandwich. The salad was great and the waitress recommended I get the lemon dressing which was nice and tasty. The salad was tasty. The chicken sandwich was good too, but I should have clarified that I do not want cheese added. I would definitely recommend the salad again. The sandwich was okay. The waitress was nice. We were outdoors and had plenty of space. We did not wait too long. My friends liked their salad and pumpkin pancakes. We did initially order the zucchini pancakes but they ran out of zucchini. There was a loose mouse running around outside and the waiters were trying to get it. I really liked how easy it was to pay too. The QR code on the receipt allowed each of us to pay for whatever item we ordered and we could use Venmo as well. We also tipped online too. It was very easy and my first time experiencing being able to pay without a waiter present.
2020-10-24,1,I ordered the waffles crunch and the waffle was extremely dry. The fruits were stale and there was no butter or whipped cream on the side. It was so bad that I left most of it.
2020-10-18,3,Classic diner-like food spot. Amazing view of the Hudson and NYC, but I won't go out of my way for the food.
2020-10-10,2,Staff are nice. View is beautiful. Food is terrible. Ordered avocado toast. Worst I've ever had. And I've had it just about everywhere. It's obvious they use packaged avocado spread and not fresh avocados. Avocado was bitter, slightly brownish and thinner than real avocados. My sons French toast. Very dry and tasteless. Pancakes as well. Guess I'm so used to farm to table or just better quality overall that this didn't work for me.
2020-09-30,5,Food was great! Workers nice and all wearing masks following protocol, a bit confusing with ordering/ Seating and all that due to COVID but overall great place, good and view! I had the omg French toast definitely recommend
2020-09-27,1,Great food, long wait, manager was very rude and disrespectful my family was visiting from Connecticut and were traveling with a service dog, after an hour & 45 minute wait, manager tells me the tables is available inside how ever dog are not allowed inside I explained the dog was a service dog and provided the service dog letter that was provided to me, she stated unless we have a service dog card we cannot be seated inside unfortunately in state of Connecticut a card isn't issued, she then stated we could split and sit 5 inside & 5 outside we respectfully declined as we wanted to have brunch as a family, later on she said to wait an extra 45 minutes and she could possibly seat us outside. With the dog, servers were nice but services wasn't the greatest, they wouldn't clean off tables nor ask how everything was going..... would I come again ? Absolutely not. Manager so have better customer service skills or be more accommodating to your guest.
2020-09-27,5,Great outdoor seating area plus now indoor seating well worth the wait.  Food is great as always been eating here since they opened
2020-09-26,4,The food was good and great service. The wait was 40 mins but the view makes up for it. I would have given the full 5 stars if it wasn't for my table being right next to the delivery pick up station. There were constant cars and people crowing next to our table and that bothered me a bit. At one point there was a large and loud delivery truck that made it hard to keep a conversation. Over all, nice brunch spot.
2020-09-26,5,Since COVID began I've had trouble getting food, mutual aid groceries, etc. I can't go to grocery stores resuscitation in the wave of the outbreak because I'm immuno-compromised. Turning Point Hoboken has given me breakfast and lunch, each meal had been tried, true, and tasty. Ugh. I'm sorry about the alliteration. I'm excited. The fare is American contemporary meets diner so you'll get an array of pancakes and some American classics with a touch of sophistication. My go to are the sandwich and salad combo, cinnamon roll pancakes, Charlie's Chai shake, and in general any omelette. The food is fresh and the produce and components are quality above regular dinner food. The portions are sizeable, pancakes fluffy, the salads even in the 1/2 combo are a meal on their own. The food has arrived on time all 3 orders and with covid protocols listed on intentionally on packaging  every delivery person has been cordial and kind, fully masked. Thank you for helping me get sustenance in a truly lawless place and time! P.s. I don't know why your pancakes are so perfect but I'm grateful for the luxury!
2020-09-20,3,The food was good but the service wasn't. I ordered from UberEats & they forgot a plate. I had to go pick up the missing food. I paid extra for the real syrup & they gave me an used one. With COVID, it is unacceptable and unsafe to be careless to give someone an used bottle.
2020-09-14,5,The food was delicious and fresh my only problem was I ordered a coffee they gave me no milk or sugar . How can you give someone no coffee with no sugar or cream or milk.
2020-09-13,4,I googled brunch spots in Jersey and chose this place immediately based on their menu and then I read the reviews and was sold. OMG where do I begin. The staff, the cleanliness, the views and the FOOD.....AMAZING!!! So quaint and clean. The OMG FRENCH TOAST is indescribably delicious. I also had the Eggs Benedetto, my first time and def will not be my last.
2020-09-13,1,Its very sad when a restaurant has good food but horrifically slow and unattentive service. We added our name to the waiting list on Yelp at 10:30 with a required arrival time at 11:40. After arriving on time we were told to wait at least another 30 mins, which actually turned into a full hour. After being seated we had our umbrella fall into a passing baby in a women's arms because the required sand filled bass was not weighted down in any way. Then we learned why the wait was so long!!! The restaurant was not busy at all but the waiters were not attentive or quick at all. (I would have settled for any speed but backwards) After the umbrella ordeal, it took another 10 minutes for a waiter to even look in our direction. After waiting for so long just to get in, we placed our full 2 orders at once.  Another 30 mins went by before our waters and coffee showed up. The French press was not properly brewed and it took another 10 minutes after that to recieve any cream to drink it.  Thankfully 3 minutes after that we finally recieved our food and it was quite delicious. Which was the only saving grace from stopping us from just walking out. Oh and then it took another 15 minutes to get the check at the end. So to summarize, we put in a reservation by 10:30 was sat for our 11:40 reservation at 12:40 and actually got our initial drinks at 1:15.  3/10 points for the chefs only! Save yourself the trouble and go to Anthony David.
2020-09-11,5,The people and food here is amazing!!! Dog friendly on the patio and beautiful location. Very reasonable prices compared to other brunch spots in the area
2020-09-06,4,Love love love the pancakes. Haven't had such soft and fluffy ones In a while. We got the cinnamon flavored ones. Also got the OMG French toast which was good but not out of the world. I will reorder for the pancakes! We got the food delivered and they also gave instructions on how to warm up the food which is a nice touch :)
2020-09-04,4,We came here for Sunday brunch around 8:30 am and it was already pretty packed. We didn't have to wait to get seated at least.We got the Avocado Smash Benny and the OMG French Toast. The Benny was pretty standard. I wasn't blown away by it but it did its job. The french toast was very good but wished there was more bacon on it. We also got a Vanilla Chai Tea Latte and an Oat Milk Latte. The vanilla chai was amazing!For brunch, Turning Point is a pretty cheap place to go. Typically, I'd pay a lot more for brunch. The view of the NY skyline is also a bonus.COVID wise, tables were decently spaced apart outside and the employees were wearing masks. I really liked that you could even pay by QR code, which I haven't seen at most restaurants yet.
2020-08-30,1,Haven't been for food but this clearly isn't somewhere you go for a good coffee. Just picked up a large cappuccino to go. It was so hot with one sleeve I could barely hold it and had to ask for another sleeve. Not a great sign. What happens when milk is so hot you have to leave it to cool 5 mins?  Yep a gross milk film forms at the top. Of which the cinnamon (that I didn't so for) congealed into. Lovely. Basically tastes like a giant hot cinnamon milk. Zero coffee taste or flavor.
2020-08-25,5,Turning Point Hoboken was amazing so many things to say. One I had a great server shame on me for not remembering her name. When we first arrived we waited approximately 5 mins to be seated , though we were outside the scenery near the water was beautiful. I was celebrating my anniversary with my fiancé and decided to try out this brunch spot. We had the flight of pancakes I opted for plain stack , lemon blueberry and Bourbon Banana Walnut Pancakes, while my fiancé had the same except for exchange the Plain  for Cinnamon Roll pancakes. I also had the chai iced coffee which was so goooood. Best iced coffee I've ever had perhaps. I had gotten the Grande Huevos Rancheros so yummy and my fiancé had Egg Skillet. We were so full had to take everything to go afterwards. Portion sizing were big.
2020-08-25,1,I really wish I was joking when I'm saying this is not the place to go to. I went to eat breakfast today. The  worker at the desk went to seat the couple after me until I advised I was there before them. Pretty sure this was the manager. I asked to be sit under a shade since it was really hot.  The manager dismissed me and went to sit the couple after me under a shaded seat and left me on a table under the blazing sun. The waitress was dismissive towards us after we had been seated. No water was given to us at all either. The food took too long and this was the only time I ever say my waitress again. Not attentive at all towards me. Towards the end of my meal, I asked for a to go box for my plate and the waitress took my food. I thought she was going to box it up and instead I saw her walk to a garbage can and throw away my food....  after minutes of waiting for the check we had to ask someone else for the check. Waitress was nowhere to be found. Couldn't even ask her if she threw away my food since she took to long. After I called the manager over the waitress came. I told the manager that the waitress (Marimar) has thrown away my food. I got no apology after but was just dismissed. She advised me they don't box their own food. Even after I had told her I wanted my plate to go. I paid full price for a meal I didn't even get to fully eat. My plate was full and I was expecting to eat what I paid money for. Good food ( If it would have gotten the chance to finish it). Horrible service. Update: I called the next day for a manager to call me and have not heard back one week later.
2020-08-23,1,I ordered breakfast this morning on uber eats with specific directions on my order. When my order arrived it was missing/ or had added unwanted items. I called the restaurant to discuss the situation and kindly asked them to remake just one of the items. They were rude, unforgiving and told me I needed to go thru uber eats instead of having good customer service and remaking a simple dish. Normally this is something I would have overlooked but in a time where restaurants rely on their patrons I can assure you I will NOT be going back to an establishment who is UNGRATEFUL for their customers.
2020-08-22,2,Food OK. Service just sucks. I know it is Covid. I know servers are busy. But when you have to stand in front of a counter and wait for 5 min while employees go pass you without even looking at you, something is wrong. And when they finally respond after me telling "Hello" three times later, they treat you like it is privilege that you are being served at all. Why bother staying in business?
2020-08-05,5,great service and food! you have the option to use silver utensils or packaged plastic utensils. the food is great and well priced! the view is also beautiful! i love coming here!
2020-06-20,1,Don't bothering calling ahead. The staff has no common sense. Called ahead. Asked if they had anything in the shade outside. She proceeded to tell me yes ( takes # & name!! Why!?! If you are not helping ) when would you arrive. I said 10-15 minutes. We arrived in under 15 mins. Watched someone walk up right in front of me and was seated at the only 2 seater in the shade left. Totally incompetent.Let me add, she took my name and phone number...Should be fired or the manager has no clue what he or she is doing.
2020-06-10,4,I love going/ordering from Turning Point any day of the week. It's good, fresh food that is very consistent. The bacon lollipops, avocado toast, and flight of pancakes are must tries! So yummy :) One star removed because I noticed they changed the menu and the prices. Avocado toast went from $6 to $8 overnight?? What?? Also they got rid of the chicken salad sandwich which was also a favorite. I understand you gotta do what you gotta do -- but hurting the wallet more than the usual definitely makes it a less frequent treat for me.
2020-06-07,3,Turning point has always been a great spot for weekend breakfast when wanting to get out and enjoy a great meal. Now with the pandemic for the first time tried and ordered pickup. Very disappointed. Utensils were not provided or asked if needed during the grub hub order through yelp. I ordered the pesto infused skillet. Order was missing bacon and portobellos as described on the menu. I've ordered this dish many times before during regular operation and never was disappointed. The restaurant did not contact me to say they were out of ingredients to suggest substitute. Instead the order was egg white with tomatoes, onion and avocado .. not what I expected. Hopefully this will not be an issue again.
2020-05-25,1,Worst experience ever. Put in an order through seamless and waited forever for delivery. Went into the app to check on the order and said the food was delivered 40 minutes ago... went downstairs to check if food was delivered and it wasnt there. I called the restaurant (5x) to see what's going on and they didn't pick up and still have no word on what happened - Im thinking they are not even open. Worst customer service  ever.
2020-05-07,5,The Turning Point has been on my list for a while now and I gotta say I LOVE this place!Ambiance: The view is beautiful! Overlooking the NYC skyline. Wherever you sit in the restaurant you can see the view as they have huge windows. The inside is a little smaller than I expected but cozy. Food/Drink: My dad and I started off with coffee which came in a cool looking french press. For food, we started with the flight of pancakes! Cinnamon roll, lemon blueberry dream, and bourbon walnut banana cakes. Each pancake was packed with flavor, moist and warm...ugh, delish! As my main entree, I ordered a cilantro lime shrimp bowl with a side salad. The bowl was a great healthy and light choice and the mango salsa on top brought out the freshness! They had so many great choices I can't wait to try them all.Price: For it being Hoboken, I thought it would be a bit more pricey but it wasn't. Menu items are decently priced.Parking: Remember, it's Hoboken LOL! I was lucky enough to find paid parking down the block.Service: The waitress was sweet. No complaints.Can't wait to try the rest of the menu items!
2020-04-30,5,Thank you so much for keeping serving the best brunch in Hoboken during this special period. I am really appreciated that I could still enjoy your food at home. Stay safe and keep cooking!
2020-04-20,5,Amidst everything that is going on with social distancing , these guys handled everything perfectly. The cinnamon roll pancakes were incredible and Huevos Rancheros was phenomenal as well. Not the cheapest but worth the few extra bucks for quality. Will definitely be ordering again.
2020-04-19,3,Ordered delivery from here today. Never had the chance to eat in the restaurant but I feel like it would've been better if we could.Delivery arrived on time. Everything was cold though. I ordered the southern chicken and waffles, a plain Belgian waffle, low country shrimp hash bowl, and an iced coffee and a latte with soy milk.The waffles were soggy. We were hoping for a nice crunch if they came fresh out of a waffle griddle. Nope. We believe they are made in bulk and kept in a steamer maybe. The syrup was average. The chicken was crunchy and good. Cooked perfect. The poached eggs with the shrimp hash were cooked perfect!! The gravy was DELICIOUS. We loved the gravy. The corn bread side was also fresh and delicious.I asked for the shrimp hash to be cooked crispy if possible because we like them crunchy. There was absolutely no crunch lol. The flavor of the Cajun was great though.The iced coffee was average. We wouldn't order it again. The latte had a light coffee taste and arrived spilled. Would be smart for them to tape the opening of the coffee before sending it lol. The opening wasn't covered in any way. No napkins sent with order.
2020-04-12,5,Food is so delicious! Ordered take out and everything was hot when it arrived. Everything was full of flavor and definitely was stuffed.
2020-03-14,5,Amazing food, very kinds staff. Wait can be bad but that's because they're so good. One of the best brunch spots in Hoboken.
2020-03-08,5,Decided to try this place from a friend's recommendation and it was definitely worth it. A small and cozy place with a view of the Manhattan skyline with absolutely delicious food. My biggest problem was that I wanted to try more than I could eat. The prices were very reasonable too, will definitely be back again and I highly recommend.
2020-02-23,5,Always a favorite of mine. The wait can be annoying and they don't take reservations so you just have to call ahead and put your name down. I would say almost anything on the menu will taste great! And the French press is a must have. :)
2020-02-16,4,Very good breakfast spot with a nice location along the water. Only complaint is it gets very busy and they don't take reservations. Get there early on Sunday's
2020-02-14,5,Love love love this place! Have visited other locations but this was my first time coming to their Hoboken location. The wait time is rather long I would suggest checking in on yelp and you will be able to be added to the list this cut a tremendous amount of time but I still had to wait over an hour on a weekend to be able to be sat down. One of the best things of this location is the amazing view! Get added to the list, stroll on over to turning point and  check in with the host! Then just have a seat outside and enjoy the panorama! I ordered the skillet which never fails! You order it however you like. Very yummy with fresh ingredients ready to be chowed down! The flight of pancakes were also a lot of fun and had plenty of choices to choose from! My favorite surprisly was a maple bourbon one which i did not think I'd like since i have the taste buds of a 3 year old!Get the hot chocolate PLEASE!! You only get this one shot at life, dont mess it up! :)
2020-02-14,3,Quality dropped since last visit. They were out of avocados, too, which are included in a huge chunk of their menu items.The food is fine, but now nothing special so not sure it's worth the wait. I would now prefer going to Zack's... but maybe I'll give them one more chance.
2020-02-10,4,Go early or be prepared to wait!I joined the waitlist on yelp and still had to wait 15min or so after checking in.Food is good and very reasonably priced, although I wasn't too impressed with the frozen hot chocolate. Place can get a tad loud. Will be back, but only before 10am :)
2020-02-07,4,Long wait times for brunch on a Sunday afternoon.We  joined the waitlist on yelp and the wait time was about 60-70 minutes.They have bar seating on first come first serve basis if you don't want to wait for so long for a table.We ordered coffees and they were pretty standard.Nothing special.For the food we ordered chicken and waffles and  grande huevos rancheros.The chicken and waffles came with a gravy and different from the regular ones.It was delicious..The huevos rancheros was yum.Huge portion and we had to take half of it home.The service was good..
2020-01-28,5,Another great place with great food. VERY IMPRESSED I must say. In all honesty, I was pretty surprised. I was expecting good food not great food! Right on the water so it's a great spot for the view on the city.
2020-01-26,1,Terrible and rude receptionist. Doesn't knoW how to manage the crowd. Super slow service. Great food but terrible experience.
2020-01-12,5,Came here on a Sunday for brunch from Long Island with my boyfriend. Wanted to come to Hoboken for a while and found this place on google. Definitely worth it- view, food & service was great! If you plan to go here ahead of time on a weekend i suggest joining their live waitlist so you don't have to wait as long once you get here
2020-01-12,5,Awesome food awesome view just all around awesome. Get the bacon lollipops and don't turn around.
2020-01-10,5,Wow!!  Just WOW!!  Incredible breakfast and you don't break the bank.  I had the cornbread French Toast and it was simply incredible.  The bacon was cooked to perfection, which is mandatory with me.  The service was good and the price is right with a view of NYC out the window.  Stellar!!!
2020-01-03,5,Singing: Happy, happy, joy, joy! Yup, I found another favorite brunch spot! The food choices are creative and delicious! We were a table of 4 and waited about 45mins. Next time we will get on the waiting list by the Yelp app before arrival. While we all waited, we were guessing that the food had to be good and we were right!First, we were seated in a room where you can see the view of NYC/waterfront from the window. Such a special touch to the brunch experience and especially since it's wintertime.I ordered a cookies & cream hot chocolate from the seasonal menu. Hot cocoa & cookie perfection in your mouth! For my meal, I ate the low country shrimp hash bowl. Let me tell you something...this was very flavorful and yum-my! I asked for my eggs to be scrambled with Monterey Jack Cheese. Were they stingy on the shrimp? Absolutely not! Lots of shrimp! I also tried my girlfriend's bourbon walnut banana cakes (pancake) that was pretty good too. Everything was on "point"!Icing on the cake was Turning Point's method of paying the bill -- easily on your cell phone. The best way ever to pay your bill and split the check that's displayed on your receipt. All restaurants need to adapt this method!Our server was very nice and knowledgeable about the food choices. She even gave great suggestions! I cannot wait to go back!!!!
2020-01-01,3,The service was good as usual HOWEVER I have to go against the people, the food was... meh.  Full disclosure I've never been a super fan of The Turning Point's but over the years I have buckled under peer pressure and chugged a cup of their wonderful French pressed coffee or two...may be three.To celebrate the holidays and the great work by my team I hosted breakfast at the Hoboken location. My team LOVED the meal, I had the chicken and waffles, it was...meh.  The combination while brilliant ,the cranberries offered a lovely contrasting compliment - The execution of this dish was underwhelming.  The waffle was soggy, the kids menu like chicken tenders were disappointing BUT the gravy...that was nom nom!Fast forward to this Past Saturday  morning. I LOVE the waitlist feature, it made brunching with six people (two being children) that much easier. Only ONE person eat all of their food, my six year Carb-loving son enjoyed his pancakes.  My other little guy was sad about his over cook/burnt eggs, the English muffin that he got instead of the toast the he requested...while the other adult didn't eat much,  I can't evaluate their experience...now my meal, that's another story...the OMG French Toast.How in the world can French toast be THAT dry?!?!? I was sad that they only had walnuts and not pecans, the sprinkle of bacon was pitiful and did I mention that it was dry?!?! $115.00 later I must sadly say, never again. I would happily purchase coffee to go but that's where my buck stops. ‍
2019-12-29,1,The pesto skillet really underwhelmed. There were a TON of basically uncooked red onions that dominated the flavor. Additionally, it was supposed to have avocado and came out with barely any (I had to ask for more). It seems like the food at Turning Point has become more mediocre over the years and the service has slipped (they now have self serve pitchers of water?). I probably won't go to Turning Point in the future as it is basically on par with an average diner breakfast.
2019-12-28,5,Awesome food and service - fresh orange juice is great too! Very family friendly and good for groups! Portions are big. Love the bourbon banana pancakes and the classic egg dish
2019-12-27,1,Once again your hosts are liars. Putting your name in ahead does nothing because they just lie and say they will and every single time I arrive they have no record and then say 45 min which actually means 2 hours. Their hostesses are a hot mess it's a shame because this place is a great breakfast spot
2019-12-27,5,Always a good choice, the portions are huge and the food is always delicious. Some of my favorites are:The chai latte - super creamy and smoothHuevos rancheros - biggest portion I've ever hadAvocado Toast - always tastyAll the french toasts I've had had been great!And blueberry and lemon pancakes are delicious!
2019-12-24,5,This place has a beautiful view of the New York skyline . The avocado smash Benny is amazing ! The service was prompt and even the wait time when we first arrived was not as long as we had originally been informed.
2019-12-23,3,I've tried Turning Point before, as theres one near me in South Jersey. Though the chain is pretty popular, in my opinion the food is not too extraordinary.. but maybe that's because i've had it multiple times. Nonetheless, I stopped by here for breakfast on the way out of a weekend filled in NYC before heading home. The wait time wasn't too bad for us, although a line seemed to be forming on this Monday morning. We were seated and waited a while for our waitress to arrive and even longer wait for some water. Food arrived and I ordered the Big Easy benedict... which was really subpar. I think the cornbread in this dish just didn't make sense to me. Overall, not a bad place for breakfast/ brunch.. very nice ambience and friendly staff. I think just for me the food was just alright for the price.
2019-12-22,5,Price of the food was very reasonable. The view from outside of the place is unbeatable. Overall experience was great. Definitely recommend this place. Quick service.
2019-12-17,5,Love most of the breakfast egg dishes. & the corn bread is my favorite! I usually go during the week because the weekends tend to be packed, which is understandable. Have always received great service and check out how delicious the picture attached looks.
2019-12-15,5,If you love breakfast and are in the Hoboken area you need to head over to Turning point! My friends and I wanted one yummy meal before heading back to Miami and I'm so glad this is where we went. I ordered the Low country shrimp hash and it was so delicious. So many flavors in one bowl! We also split the pancake flight and choose the blueberry lemon pancakes, cinnamon roll and bourbon banana and it definitely did not disappoint! Also if you're into peppermint hit chocolate you HAVE to try theirs !!! It was amazing
2019-11-27,3,This is a very medium restaurant. The wait time was reasonable for a Wednesday mid-morning brunch. My companion's first cup of coffee had some unidentifiable floaters in it, and it was promptly replaced with a thermos of floater-free coffee. They do have a large variety of coffees. They didn't have biscuits, which was surprising, and when I asked for butter to put on my dry sourdough toast I received a ball of margarine with water at the bottom of the dish. Service was medium but not wildly friendly. Overall, no better than a Denny's or Village Inn.
2019-11-20,5,food is very good we usually order here kale juice, cheese sandwich and avacado toast.. pancakes everything is very yummy
2019-11-15,5,Delicious fresh food, made to exactly what you want. There are soo many options from vegan pancakes to the exact opposite specturm. It's a great spot too as its right on the water. Really cute decor on the inside, 100% would go again.
2019-11-04,2,I was in the area with my family on Saturday and found this place on yelp. Omg the wait was 1.5 hr. It was so cold outside there were people out the door. Ok but you would think the food would be great right. Not at all. The omelette was cold , dry potatoes. Such a disappointment. I make better omelette at home . The orange juice was sour. The only okay thing was the blueberry pancakes other than that this place doesn't deserve anyone's money.
2019-11-02,1,The only reason I gave this restaurant 1 star is because of the beautiful view. We were on a wait list starting at 11:15 & were told it would be 20-25 minutes. We went inside at 1145 to see if we were close..we were told another 20 mins. We waited another 20 mins then went back inside & guess what,??? We were told another 20 mins!! Ergo..WE LEFT!!!  They need to be honest re: wait time!! We were super excited to try the pumpkin pancakes..but never got to!!  VERY DISAPPOINTING! P.S we drove all the way from Bronx NY because we were told it was spectacular! Now we will never know!!!
2019-10-27,5,Found this place on Yelp for a nice brunch after a long night out.  I already can't wait to go back! Everything on the menu sounded amazing, and my bf and I both loved what we ordered. Our waitress was really nice and we took advantage of getting on the waitlist while we were on our way there. I definitely recommend getting a pancake flight!
2019-10-27,4,Always a long wait but it's usually worth it. The food is good and the ambiance is lively- kind of gives you that down the shore feeling. I love the "healthy" pancakes and the chicken sausage, but they have run out of that before so I guess that's annoying.
2019-10-21,3,I normally stayed in Manhattan NY whenever I visit, but I always wanted to see the NY skyline so I chose W Hoboken. This place is not too far but not too close either from the hotel. It's a nice walk by the pier with beautiful scenery. You should put your name in Yelp waiting list if you're coming in weekends prime time, which I think it's between 9-11 AM. I went to this place twice Saturday and Sunday. The location is right across the water taxi pier so if you want to cross to NY you can have your breakfast here. I didn't put my name in the wait list on Saturday so the wait was about 15 minutes or a bit more. We ordered chicken and waffles, and egg Benedict with chicken chorizos it's comes with potatoes, we also ordered regular waffles with chicken sausage. The portion was pretty big to include the latte, it came in a big cup. The chicken looks like oversize chicken nuggets, which means it looks like it's processed not made from scratch, the taste was good enough.  The egg Benedict was also decent portion, asked the waiter to have my potato chunks a bit crispy but it came soggy and wasn't even hot, so I think the waiter just say yes and didn't care about it. It seems like they make a bunch of it put it in an open heater container. The service was ok nothing special. I chose this place because the food seems normal, the breakfast restaurants around are a bit on healthier side or vegan.
2019-10-16,5,I was advised to go to Turning Point for my breakfast. First of all, I absolutely like this place from outside - you get a wonderful Manhattan view; and inside - it is very bright and nice. Our waitress was very friendly and smily which is great especially in the morning when you don't want anybody or anything to spoil you day. Food was very delicious, portions were huge. My friends and I got to try eggs and pancakes! One might say that these are some regular breakfast meals, but in some way they were unique, and we all loved them!
2019-10-13,1,Noooooooo, this a NO GO bro.I go to the turning point at long branch and that one is great, so when I found out there was one near me I was all in... and wow... SERVICE:same as long branch a bunch of teens run service, but the main difference is... the attitude. Our server had a straight face the whole entire time and even rolled her eyes a bunch for legit no reason? But you look around and everyone seems completely apathetic. I'm young and I work in the restaurant business i know how long days go, but giving attitude to customers who just been seated ISNT the vibe. FOOD: Despite the bad service I figured okay but the food is going to be bomb... aha... NO.Only thing that made a Turning Point was my stomach.Along w everyone else's at the table... afterwards we all had to go home immediately because NO ONE felt good afterwards...The potatoes in my skillet were soggy and not fully cooked through and a heaping tablespoon of oil sat on top of the eggs... and the strawberries on the pancakes were past ripe...It was justNotAppetizingAT ALLand we all got sick from it.OverallBig fat major NOGo to long branch if you want the good stuff
2019-10-03,3,Turning Point is tucked away on the ground floor of an apartment building, just north of the corner of Frank Sinatra Drive and the bustling 14th Street thoroughfare.  It seems like most Hoboken residents either frequent it or have no idea it even exists.  I fit comfortably in between those extremes with my occasional brunch visits.  While I typical save my restaurant excursions for dinners, every now and then, I wind up dining out for breakfast, brunch, or lunch.  To that end, I have been to Turning Point with friends a few times and also ordered takeout once.  The service is often terribly inefficient, and my to-go meal had been completely incorrect.  Regardless, I almost always start my Turning Point experience with their 100% Organic Coffee, which I believe has become richer and more flavorful as the years have progressed.  In terms of the food, on previous visits I have enjoyed the El Fresco Quinoa Bowl with its spicy chipotle salsa and cooling avocado, as well as the Zucchini "Spaghetti" with its Mediterranean vegetables and pesto and the Pesto Infusion Skillet served with an English muffin.  However, on my most recent visit, I ordered the Garden Frittata, which was plated on top of a thin, toasted wheat pita.  The frittata consisted of fluffy egg whites that had been infused with roasted red peppers, portobello mushrooms, and baby spinach.  It was also supposed to contain feta cheese, though I had left that out.  The egg patty was flavorful, but tasted even better when it was sprinkled with pepper and drizzled with hot sauce.  Turning Point is a great breakfast and lunch spot with a wide array of menu items, spanning everything from indulgent pancakes to nutritious superfood selections.  However, if they worked on their service, it would provide a much better overall experience.
2019-09-28,5,This is my favourite spot for brunch in Hoboken. I have been going to this place for three years now and haven't got bored yet. It's a BYOB brunch spot and has got great views of the city. Their orange juice is freshly squeezed and goes well with champagne for Mimosas
2019-09-28,5,Our favorite breakfast and brunch place when visiting our Steven's student.Worth the wait. Great coffees and hot chocolates. And always check the specials.
2019-09-07,3,Two in my party. Greeted by a very friendly waiter. That was the highlight for me. Ordered the Avocado Toast with poached eggs. Thank goodness for the table's salt and pepper. The Egg White Skillet with vegetables was almost all purple onion. Overwhelming. Sent the pot of decaf back as it wasn't drinkable. (the Hawaiian French press though was terrific). Oh and I failed to mention that we never received our side of bacon. Will I return? Not anytime soon but if I do, I'll try the French toast or come at another time of day for a non-brunch meal.
2019-09-06,3,I came here with a group of people on a Saturday around 10:30; we were seated pretty quickly which was great, and I'm pretty sure that was because I called in advance. It took some time for everyone to get their food but it definitely was within a reasonable time. I ordered the tropical crunch waffle. It wasn't bad, but it also didn't taste ridiculously good. I enjoyed the new twist of serving it with granola and also the strawberry reduction, but I felt pretty neutral about it when I left. Was also a nice touch that it was on the waterfront. Would not be against coming back, but probably would explore another option.
2019-09-03,5,Reasonable prices in Hoboken with delicious breakfast and beautiful waterfront views! I highly recommend the tuna melt!!
2019-08-25,1,The waiting time is too long , poor management , 15 mins to be seated once table was ready . 30 mins to get drinks even when tables are empty .
2019-08-23,5,No words to describe this place. It is awesome! Breakfast is delicious and the staff is super friendly. I've been here approximately five times and always looking forward to coming back. I've recommended it to many people and they have all raved about it. Highly recommended.
2019-08-05,2,I was very disappointed in this location after being at the one in Long Branch. Service was extremely slow and messed up 3/5 of our orders. We had no cutlery for about 5 minutes after we got our food. The food itself was the saving grace of this visit and even that was just satisfactory. The long branch location is much better than this one.
2019-08-04,2,Personally, I am conflicted about Turning Point. Positively, the menu provides a number of inventive dishes - like fruit bruschetta. Moreover, the food is actually quite tasty and the service is pretty good. NEVERTHELESS, the wait time to get in is absurd. The first time I went, I waited for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Then , the second time I put my name on the waiting list behind *17* people. Following a drive of an hour to get there, once we got the restaurant we checked in and then had to wait another 45 minutes! Personally, I feel like the food would need to be absolutely incredible to justify such an absurd wait- and I just do not feel like it is so.
2019-08-03,3,Turning point is a good place for breakfast if you can get in earlier than the crowds. There is a nice drink selection of coffees and teas. The breakfast menu is pretty standard; IMO the best things to get are the skillets since they dont really serve them everywhere. Wilbur skillet is my always and forever order. The service is usually adequate but it can get crowded and crazy inside so its too be expected. It's a no nonsense cute place to grab brunch even though there are a ton of other options in hoboken. Everything is homey and comforting. Seems super family friendly and no alcohol or byob
2019-08-02,3,Nice little affordable place for lunch with a great view of Manhattan.  The Reuben melt, Cuban sandwich and chicken pesto ciabatta were very good, but it seemed to take a long time to get the meal and it was not at all crowded.
2019-07-06,1,Just had lunch at Turning Point Café inHoboken. The service was atrocious. We had to call out several times toask to order, get silverware,get refills on coffee, and pay the bill.  There were a number of servers hanging around chatting, joking, and generally having a good time. Tables were not bused   After we paid the bill, we attempted to speak to a manager. The person who appeared was dismissive. As we exited we noticed facial expressions of "care less" behind our backThough the food was excellent we will never return.
2019-06-27,5,My morning rituals are typical. I wake up yearning for a few extra moments of rest. I express gratitude to a higher power for the breath in my body and the blessings in my life. I shower. I dress. I eat breakfast. I exchange laughter and words with my beloveds, embracing each other as we say our daily goodbyes.
2019-06-24,3,I should preface this by saying that I have been to the Turning point in Westfield, and it's impossible not to compare the two. This place is set in a beautiful location in uptown Hoboken, with a great eclectic menu of options. I am personally fond of the food and the fun drinks which is what keeps me coming back. However, the service is fairly poor. Today I went for lunch with a friend and it took 10 min just for the server to bring us a second menu. The same went for water, which on a hot 84 degree humid NJ day is almost unbearable when you're sitting outside. From there, the service was average at best. Asked for a vinaigrette for my salad which took 15 min, aka the salad was gone by then. As I said, the chain and it's reputation from the impressive Westfield location keeps me returning, but certainly not a staple amongst the myriad of great Hoboken restaurant options
2019-06-22,2,Came here for Saturday brunch. I ordered the big easy benedict and asked for the hollandaise on the side. I'm really glad I did because the sauce arrived looking like the oil separated from the rest of it. I'm no chef, but I think that's what they mean when the sauce breaks. I asked the waiter if it usually looks like that and he said he didn't know. He brought the sauce back to the kitchen to ask and it came back just stirred around a little bit. My boyfriend ordered the huevos rancheros and it was large but was really dry because they added very little salsa to the top. Overall, very disappointing as I had heard great things but it seems they don't care about the food they serve.
2019-06-01,1,On ordering I asked the Maria waitress a question about the eggs and she had a chip in her reply.service stinks with an attitude if you ask a question example - could you please wipe the table ..Instead of a sure - reply with a snappy would you please give me a moment.Can you please make sure eggs are hot -Snappy reply back.I asked for my muffin with no butter back -Reply with attitude This defines good vs bad service The attitude back! Management should teach these young waiters who Think they know it all.
2019-05-29,3,Went for lunch on Memorial Day. Mixed experience. First, the waiting list. One reason we chose this restaurant is the online waiting list. On the way there, hit the wait list button to find out they CLOSED the online list. Called them and was told they were currently only taking names at the door. Got there, found at least 20 other sets of people on the "paper" list hovering around, then hilariously, had the hostess put us on the online waiting list. Hmm.... so much for logic and convenience. Waited 50 minutes to get a table. Luckily, it was a beautiful day to enjoy the pier and the view.Menu. Interesting breakfast focused menu, but execution a bit disappointing. Omelette was overcooked with the outside quite dry and inside lacking seasoning. Everyone else said food was ok, but nothing they'd rave about. Service. Friendly and well intentioned, but needs improvement. Our shared appetizer was a no show and we seemed to have lost our waiter after our food arrived. Given the stellar location, will try one more time hoping they do better all around when it's not a peak holiday weekend.
2019-05-28,5,First time here and I'm sure it won't be my last! It was Memorial Day and we had a 45min-1hour wait. Although the wait was long, I decided to take a chance because I had heard a lot of good things. For drinks, the nutty Irishman and it was delicious! For food, I ordered the grande huecos rancheros, my husband ordered the big easy Benedict, and we ordered avocado toast cause why not lol. I can't not begin to describe how tasty our food was. We were so pleased with everything we ordered. We agreed that this was our new favorite breakfast spot. We were extremely satisfied and 10/10 would recommend to friends!
2019-05-27,3,Food is good but their wait list is a joke. They never have accurate times told to you and the hostess will say you are the next one to be seated and then takes someone else ahead of you.
2019-05-26,1,I am extremely disappointed in my last experience at Turning Point. I have been going there for quite some time for the delicious food and experience. However, today I was disgusted by the way I was treated by the staff. My table and I placed a pretty pricey order, and as our appetizers were placed down - half of our BYOB champagne bottle was spilled on me. Which would have been okay, however NO sorry was included by the wait staff. She was giggly and acted as if it was a "chore" to fix her mistake. We were extremely disappointed by this response.  Then, when I received my meal, my toast was completely dropped on the floor. Again, honest mistake. However, no apology was made. And it was to seem as if it was a common occurrence. An apology and some sort of reimbursement would have been appreciated. I am extremely disappointed in the wait staff and their response to customers. For a classy establishment, they should re think the people that the hire to work there. I hope to revisit the turning point, but worry about the entitled wait staff they hired.
2019-05-19,1,Sunday brunch on the other side of Hudson Pros:Food is absolutely great. I recommend the shrimp hash bowl Cons:Where do I start, the outdoor table is right under a building and the ac water drops like drizzle and gets all in the dishes No utensils for our table, food was served after a long wait, and then we had to wait extra time for utensils The food ran out of ingredients, and I was told a long tome after the order, I had to accept the food because I didn't want to waste more time on this drizzling restaurant table where the rest of the wold is sunny and beautiful...
2019-05-12,5,First time here!  Just amazing!Really nice environment despite being Mother's Day!May was our waitress , with another gentleman that was helping or training.  They were both really polite and nice Waffles, pancakes, French toast were greatFrench press coffee was great!!!!
2019-05-08,2,This place is ok, the wait time is ridiculous. But the avocado toast was nice. Would never go again just because the wait was crazy, the restaurant seems big but it's actually quite small
2019-04-28,4,Service was kind of slow, but it was a busy Saturday morning. There were kids running around, so this place is definitely family friendly. The food was great! I'm ready to go back and try some more things off the menu. I had the "Pancake Flight" which was sooo good!! I would come back here. A great brunch spot. It's right by the water too, so you get nice views of the NYC skyline.
2019-04-26,5,The food quantity is very good. It has an amazing view of the city and really awesome place for brunch!!! Although it has a long wait time.
2019-04-26,2,I ordered 2 plain stacks and a side of potatoes with onions. They forgot my onions then offered to bring me out a side of onions. My pancakes were thin, dense and the outside texture was hard while the inside was doughy. The pancake had no flavor to it at all. They have great customer service BUT their food is not memorable.
2019-04-14,3,The grand French toast is just a reference to size but not flavor .. the fruit that came with it seemed like it was whatever was left at the bottom of the fruit bowl .. chicken sausage was ok. My smoothie could have been thicker. It was an ok breakfast. My expectations were much higher
2019-04-06,5,Definitely it's one of the best places to eat around here ,so many different options,  try something different than anybody else around here, I'm so happy that we find this place and we try a new flavors.
2019-03-27,5,Amazing breakfast selection. Food is great for in dining and they deliver! Fresh avocado toast are the best in town.
2019-03-17,5,Tried this place with my girl gang and we loved it! I hate their wait policy of checkin only on arrival which means your phone call reservation is of no use! Don't get fooled like me coz they do not tell you that on call! Food is great so that saved this review. Will go back again!!
2019-03-11,5,Solid breakfast and lunch spot. Great options for both, including some delicious healthy options. Great coffee selection, as well as hot chocolate. Really great view of the nyc skyline. That combined with delicious food and fair prices, overall great experience!
2019-03-10,1,Is it possible to leave half a star??? I live in downtown Hoboken and I took a stroll out of my neck of the woods to try this place out. REGRETS!!! Place is extremely packed and busy, which you think would be an indicator of great food and service.. I don't know if daylight savings threw the kitchen and wait staff off or what, but this place was nothing short of disappointing. I really should have known to exit immediately after hearing "I'm sorry were out of avocados" !!!!!! However we continued ordering other items, one of which was the *fresh squeezed* orange juice.. which was 100% Tropicana.. mmmmmm....We ordered an omelette, pancakes, and French toast to share. Asked for all the cheeses and sauces on the side.... food comes out, and all the sides were not included at all with the meal. Everything was brought out without sharing plates or syrup. By the time these things were finally brought out after asking a few times... our food was cold. To really create the visual of the food, let me explain a few things:::::-the eggs in the omelette were translucent.. like so thin like a damn sausage casing!!! Literally were they running out of eggs too?? Because they really spread that one egg out thinner than my patience. And the "home fries" on the side... looked more like raw potatoes straight from the sack. -French toast was basically raw slices of bread with some nuts on top. Dry and also thin-pancakes lacked any sort of fluffiness and didn't come with butter or any other delicious toppings besides a few strawberries. Also were extremely cold, clearly had been out for a while. I honestly just told the waitress that it was all horrible. She gave us our check for the coffee and tea and we were out PS: to the rude couple staring at us while we POLITELY told the server our food was no good, please go eat ur oversized oatmeal bowl in the discretion of ur own home because ain't no one can be trusted if that's what ur ordering at a restaurant....
2019-03-06,2,Ughhh.. heard so many good things about this place and was veeery disappointed. Went there with a friend while we were visiting NYC for the long weekend and immediately when we got in the vibe was a bit weird - one of the waiters just looked so unhappy and wasn't being real nice to the customers in front of us in line.It was out first there of course and we didn't really know how the restaurant worked but we ended up somehow grabbing food to go instead of having a table. They didn't tell us that that side of the restaurant was just for pickups and even though we were clearly confused they just took our order, and told us to sit and wait cause it would take around 20 minutes. When my food finally was ready, it was a bit of a mess inside all the containers. Meanwhile, my friend who had ordered an egg, cheese and bacon english muffin (not too difficult to make) waited extra 15 minutes for her food. We ended up eating in the coffee table inside the restaurant, very unhappy and annoyed with the whole situation :(
2019-03-02,4,I went to Turning Point for brunch and ordered the Salted Caramel Waffle. I also tried the Tuscany Omelette. The waffle was very tasty. It was cooked to the right crispness, the brown sugar and caramel added the perfect amount of sweetness, and of course, the bacon bits on top were yummy as well. The omelette was good, but not as special. It had peppers, spinach, sausage, and mozzarella on top. It was nice that it also came with some potatoes, an English muffin, and fruit. The portion size was decent, though the food actually wasn't as filling as I thought it would be. There was a 15 minute wait (I arrived around 2 pm on a Saturday). After I got the text notification that our table was ready, we were seated promptly. The staff members were friendly, and we got our food shortly after ordering. We did have to wait a while for someone to come pick up our check after the meal though. Turning Point has a really nice environment, as the inside is decorated in a tasteful manner, complementing the great riverfront view out the windows.Overall, I would give Turning Point 4.5 stars if I could. The food (especially the Salted Caramel Waffle) is very good, and the atmosphere is great. I would highly recommend it if you are looking for a breakfast or brunch place in the area.
2019-02-21,5,The best breakfast / brunch in town I always order the cornbread French toast with poached eggs on the side and it is so delish with a side of their winter drink "king to kale"  puts the cherry on the top for me  There is always a bit of a wait especially on weekends and Sunday mornings but there food is always worth the wait.My to go too place every weekend
2019-02-21,2,This used to be one of my favorite breakfast and lunch spots in town BEFORE having kids.  Now it's one of my least favorite since it's evident many of the staff do not like waiting on groups of Moms + toddlers by their rude behavior. Keep in mind this is during weekday late morning breakfast outings where the restaurant isn't busy - you'd think they would appreciate the business.  Recently it took over 10 minutes for an server to even ask for our beverage order and not once did they come to check on us during the meal.  Getting our bill was another lengthy, unnecessary process. The food is always good but the service tarnishes the whole experience.  The majority of the high chairs are either missing straps or have broken clips and the changing table in the women's restroom is missing the safety strap as well.
2019-02-18,2,I usually visit Turning Point while at the Jersey Shore; however, I was meeting a friend who lives in Hoboken for brunch so we figured why not try the Hoboken location. Upon arrival there was a wait, which is totally understandable as it's the weekend and noon. The food was pretty good, but upon paying for our meal we, unfortunately, we were rushed out and asked to leave the table. Two minutes after the check was paid for a manager came by to check-in on our experience where we expressed as positive. Unfortunately, five minutes later, the same manager came to our table and stated, "We have a really long wait and if you two want to keep talking, you can get up and chat in the back of the restaurant where's the tables and to-go items for purchase." I've never been told to leave a table because of a current wait; mind you our waiter was great and we provided a great tip for his service. This was really disappointing on the managers part since we weren't sitting at a table for 20 minutes post payment and our meal was delic. If the staff handled this differently, I would've provided a more positive review. I can think of other brunch places to visit in Hoboken and probably won't return to this location.
2019-02-17,1,They need to know how to treat customers. Maybe they don't really care because of the unstopping people to visit. We asked the food to go and opened it up at home. It looked so disgusting like they threw the food out in the doggie box. One more thing, you guys have to get rid of the table setting at the entrance of restroom. We had to constantly see people come and go into the rooms and had to hear all the sound as well as the smell.!!!!
2019-02-16,4,As typical with Hoboken, the views and scenery are nice but the food wasn't anything to rave about. I had a basic omelette with breakfast potatoes and my husband ordered a breakfast skillet with poached eggs. My omelette was ok but boy was it lacking some flavor! Be sure to tell your waiter to add all the veggies because I feel like if we hadn't asked for some peppers or onions it would've been a pretty bland meal. The real knock outs were the French press coffee and the French toast. The French press coffee is $7 but you literally get your own French press coffee maker for the table so you watch your own coffee brew with a cute little quicksand timer to tell you when it's ready. I thought that was a great touch. Some painful points that are not the restaurant's fault: expect at least a 45 minute wait on weekends and expect parking to be a nightmare. Otherwise, we had a nice meal of three plates and coffee all for $35, which is great for this area. Perfect breakfast spot to bring your parents or out of town visitors if you can get around parking.
2019-02-16,5,Randomly found this gem while looking for a brunch spot on a very cold lazy Saturday morning. Our server Layla was simply delightful! And...'Cali flatbread' is a must have. This place actually has the potential to become our weekend staple!!
2019-01-25,5,Yummy breakfast! We ordered the Lemon Blueberry Pancakes and the Cornbread French Toast. Both were extremely filling and flavorful! The frozen hot chocolate is a must!! Would definitely recommend for breakfast or brunch.
2019-01-20,5,no question! come here! there's a slight wait on the weekends, but trust me it's worth it! the presentation is e v e r y t h i n g. amazing food, service, and city skyline views.it's become a staple since we moved here and we bring everyone that visits and they love it as well.
2019-01-16,4,Their food is amazing! Wait times and staff are not the fastest. If you're looking for a variety of healthy and glutinous options this is the place to go when you are on no time restriction!
2019-01-09,5,Love the ambience. Food is also decent.Too bad it closes at 3. Would love to go there for dinner too.
2019-01-06,5,A expansive menu with many healthy options. The coffee is excellent with a personal French press option. A favorite if your hungry and looking for some comfort is the Big Easy Eggs Benedict.
2019-01-05,4,We got there around noon and there was a 20-30 min wait. After finally sitting down it was nice to see that we got a booth looking directly towards midtown Manhattan. The food was decently priced and I ordered the Grande Huevos Rancheros for about 8.99 I believe and an iced green tea. There's plenty of breakfast and lunch options to the point where it was a bit overwhelming. But I was happy with my section because the food was great. There were a few mishaps with the order which is why I couldn't give it a full 5 star review, but it's definitely someplace I'd consider coming back to.
2018-12-29,4,Convenient that I can just join the line on yelp rather than calling and hoping for the best. My girlfriend and I ubered over when we were almost up and kinda idled with one table infront of us for some time. We had the avocado toast which was very okay, nothing to rave about. My girlfriend went with a heathy option, which she regretted, because healthy here means no flavor. I had the grand huevos rancheros with poached eggs and it was delish! There hot choclates are great for instagram, but that is it. Service was good, expect a wait for breakfast, uber over if you can.
2018-12-25,3,Crazy busy. Service is always lackluster. They use a weird grease or oil in their foods that makes me feel lousy for the rest of the day. Too much going on in the restaurant. Maybe opentable would help?
2018-12-16,4,Found this little place on our way out of town. Food was good, atmosphere was nice, waitress was friendly, and prices were decent.
2018-12-03,5,One of my favorite places in Hoboken for Brunch.  There is usually a wait, but it's worth it.  The prices are reasonable, the view is nice, and the food tastes great.  The service is just ok, but that can be overlooked.  I usually get the one of the skillets and some pancakes to split.
2018-12-03,4,I'm giving it 4 stars because my coffee came with a pot of hot coffee. With that being said, this place isn't that bad. This place is great for families. Service was excellent! But, the fruit cup that comes with the order can be served in a bigger size. The serving size of the fruit was literally for a toddler .
2018-12-02,5,Party of 6 visited first time for brunch. All ordered different brunch dishes. Everyone loved what they ordered. Eggs Benedetto were fantastic. Everything was delicious!
2018-11-18,5,Visited this place again for Saturday brunch. The view of NYC skyline is still its highlight. We had Grande Huevos Rancheros, breakfast nachos and bruschetta white omelette. It was all delicious. The holiday decoration is really good. The sanitized hand holder in the restroom is really impressive.
2018-11-14,5,My favorite brunch spot in Hoboken!! I take all my visitors here. So cute, lots of options, consistent quality. Unless you rise early, you will most likely have a 20-40 min wait on the weekends so plan to put your name down and walk around a little - not bad with the view right outside.The food is always so good - my favorites have been the Wilbur Skillet and Tropical Crunch Waffle. BYOB for mimosas, etc is certainly a nice perk if that's what you're looking for, too!
2018-11-04,4,The service wasn't really great maybe it was because the server we had. It looked like she didn't know what we were talking about when we told her what "drinks" we wanted. I mean we was reading off the menu. She looked confused during the time we were there. When we notice she forgot about my cousin's creamer for her  cold brew. I asked another server and he came quick with it. Overall, the food was amazing. I ordered the Grand French with side of strawberries instead of random fruit. My cousin ordered Traditional eggs with side of pancakes. She said the potatoes were delicious. The only reason I rate 4 stars was for the food. The view is amazing as well
2018-11-04,2,Giving 2 stars because the food is good, but cannot recommend anyone order delivery. Over two hours after I placed my order (through Seamless) my order finally arrived. I called the restaurant after 1.5 hours to check on the status. The first call no one ever answered and the second attempt when someone finally picked up, I was told my order had already gone or and should arrive in about 5 minutes. 40 minutes later it finally arrived, completely cold. Seamless also attempted to call the restaurant when I reached out to them regarding the order, no answer either. Haven't been to this Turning Point in almost 3 years because of their poor customer service and hoped it had improved since then - needless to say it has not. Beware ordering if you intend to actually eat breakfast during breakfast time.
2018-10-21,5,The best chicken and waffles ever. Also, their choices for teas and coffees are awesome. I always look forward to going to Turning Point.
2018-10-20,5,Like their food and service. I wish they had a better wifi. They are very friendly and serve the best brunch!
2018-10-14,4,Its aight.   Food was ok.  Nothing too spectacular.  Service was friendly but slow.  Very affordable prices. And you can bring your own bottle of champagne, so there's that.  It was pretty busy, which I haven't seen too many brunch spots be.  The view outside is lovely.  End result: it's a try if you're in the area and want a cheap meal.  Brunch for two was $30 which ain't bad.
2018-10-06,5,I went for the first time today because I was looking for a breakfast spot & was tired of going to IHOP. First of all, I tried their mocha chino which is absolutely amazing.. I had the southern chicken and waffles, which was really good. & my husband had the Wilbur skillet which he said was amazing. I'm happy I discovered this place because we received great service with a great view We both agreed we will definitely be returning some time in the near future.
2018-09-21,3,Good for staples. I would say this is a pretty staple brunch place in Hoboken. Pros is that it has all the staples for brunch, the con is that the food isn't too creative. Also would like it better if it has a wider lunch selection! Most of their menu is breakfast food. If you're a fan of that then definitely swing by here, their skillets are pretty solid! Their French presses are also pretty enticing and fairly priced.
2018-09-16,4,Update: I went back here and the food was goodOne of the best brunch options in Hoboken. The cozy setup makes it perfect for small get togethers.
2018-09-09,2,Extremely rude service. Waited 30 minutes and saw many people get seated before me without having their full party present but would not seat me because one person was missing from my party. Absolutely ridiculous. There are many other locations of this restaurant you can visit to enjoy the food without having to deal with the rude service at the Hoboken location.
2018-09-09,4,I would give this place a 3.5 for the food, but with the coffee and service, I am bumping it up to 4. Our waiter Vanessa was awesome! She was on top of our table, even though we had a wiggly toddler with us. The avocado toast was good, but my Eggs Benedetto (with chicken chorizo) was ok as it was lacking other flavors besides just creamy from the sauce. The veggie omelette that the other person got was simple so you can't really go wrong with it. Drinks wise, I had the hot vanilla chai and we got regular coffee for the table. Both were good, though the chai was a little sweet for my taste so I just mixed some of the black coffee in! Overall an above average breakfast/brunch place with a great view; we had a positive experience.
2018-09-03,5,El Fresco Quinoa Bowl is awesome!! We went to Turning Point for brunch on a busy Sunday with friends. We had to wait 20 mins as we didn't have reservations. We also struggled to find parking in the area. However, this place has good NYC views and great food. I ordered El Fresco Quinoa bowl with side salad was delicious. Our group had ordered chocolate pancakes, French toast, avacado toast etc. We all were pleased with our food and service.We will be back to try the zucchini noodles!
2018-09-02,2,Don't order delivery it won't come. Been waiting for an hour. Would love to get on with with my day. This place is unreliable.
2018-09-02,5,It's rare I give a breakfast place full stars. This place is very close to the Hudson River, so i can have a good view while eating. I ordered Pesto Infusion Omelete, it came w side fruits, which tasted so good.
2018-08-24,4,I came here for breakfast. I ate outside one of the better outdoor views in Hoboken. The service was very friendly and efficient. I had the avocado toast and scrambled eggs. Both were very good. Next time I'd ask for the toast more lightly toasted or just warmed. But I guess that just a matter of choice. Its a bring your own so next time I'll bring a bottle of champagne and enjoy the views of Hoboken.
2018-07-22,3,This place is very busy. I have had issues with the service before but in terms of the food this hits the mark. The southern chicken and waffles were delicious. I loved the sausage gravy. If there is one critique I would say it was a touch salty. Overall, I really liked it.The big easy skillet was also solid. I have had this before and it always hits the mark. The combination of flavors was awesome. I would reorder.If you can get past the lapse in service and the wait time the food definitely is good.
2018-07-22,4,We stopped in for take out while visiting my sister and were very pleased. We ordered the lunch combos. The prices were great and portions were nice. The food was very good and it was right across the street from my sister's apartment so we will definitely come back.
2018-07-12,5,I enjoy the breakfast options at Turning Point.  I normally have it delivered.  They do not disappoint!!
2018-07-08,1,Came here to start off my Sunday, excited for the beautiful views that the restaurant had to offer.  Unfortunately, that (and the coffee) were the only positives to my experience here. Our waitress had an attitude, which we tried dismissing multiple times. We had enjoyed our first order of French press (Kona) so much that we ordered another, but with a different brew. After asking her for the "Blue Mountain," she says "so another Kona." We clarified our order again and she said "the blue mountain IS the Kona." She took a look at the menu then realized she was wrong. She didn't even apologize. WTF. Next, the food. It was pretty good, however I was disappointed to find my food lukewarm. I tried asking them to heat it up, and was successful in grabbing someone's attention after 5 minutes. Luckily, another waitress took care of this and brought my food out after 10 minutes. Finally, the icing on the cake - while my friends are still in the middle of eating, our waitress comes by and says "here's the check." I recognize that giving the check in the middle of a meal isn't abnormal, however given that our whole experience had been terribly underwhelming this seemed to lock in my decision to not come here again. If you want to have a pleasant, enjoyable brunch, don't come here. The service will leave a bad taste in your mouth and you'll wish you had gone to ihop instead.
2018-07-07,3,Good place but lately the service has been extremely slow which is very difficult with small children. The food quality of good but the crowds and slow service really make you wonder whether it's worth the hassle.
2018-07-01,5,I traveled to New Jersey for the first time after 12 years and this place has amazing sandwiches.
2018-06-30,4,Solid 3.8! We had a good brunch- the chai tea is delicious and the French press was great! The TP's chicken salad was good but wasn't a generous serving - there wasn't enough cranberries or even walnuts? The Wilbur skillet is my favorite and I thought it was good, the serving was great and the avocado was fresh. I also love their English muffin! Our server was so nice and we didn't feel rushed out at all.
2018-06-19,4,Wow! My best friend lives in Hoboken and recommended this cute little spot for brunch. I definitely recommend making a reservation because this place gets packed quick- and for good reason! Everything on the menu looked/sounded incredible and the specials just complicated our decision making because they sounded awesome too. Ultimately, both dishes we got were outstanding, drinks were delicious, and the service was great! You cannot go wrong with this spot!
2018-06-03,5,Super friendly staff and delicious food make the trek around town in the chilly weather so worth it. Can't wait to come back
2018-05-13,5,Wonderful and Awesome employees ,food ,view & restaurant....Brenda one of the managers is a credit to this restaurant.... : )
2018-05-06,5,This place does not disappoint. Ever. The blueberry and lemon pancakes are the best pancakes in the WORLD and I've had a lot of pancakes... all around the world! My cryptonite! Since moving to Hoboken I can't count how many times I've been for their pancakes and their Huevos Rancheros with avocado.. and the occasional side of fruit depending on how healthy I'm feeling!!Downside is that there is generally always a que at the weekend... but... amazing upside.. food is the best, service is great and you can sit and wait sitting on a sunny bench outside, gazing at the NYC view letting the world go by for 20-35mins .  Sign up for their card if you live near by, you get a free entree on your birthday! They don't take reservations and close at 3pm. There is also a takeaway cafe if you just can't wait for a table in the cozy restaurant!
2018-05-04,1,Having been here a handful of times - the wait time is horrendous. The service is horrendous. The quality of food is inconsistent. Not worth the time or money !  Other locations of the Turning Point are much much better !  PLEASE brunch elsewhere in Hoboken
2018-05-04,3,Food goodThe wait was an hour and a halfTo long for a wait for brunch on Sunday I think
2018-04-26,4,I used to like this place a lot. I don't know what changed in one year but food did not taste like before. View is good, nice sitting, byob is a plus. But food is eh.
2018-04-18,4,My mom and I came here for breakfast around 11am and we were seated right away. Our waitress gave us a very spacious booth since it wasn't too busy.My mom had a plain stack of pancakes and I had the big easy benedict. I didn't expect much but they were both surprisingly good! The pancake had a hint of mint which my mom and I both loved. I liked how they served coffee in a thermal coffee pot and left it on our table so that we didn't have to bother the waitress for refills.Oh, and the view definitely complemented the food.
2018-03-31,4,My boyfriend and I were looking for somewhere to eat in Hoboken on a Sunday morning and this place came into my radar. Parking looks like it could be a hassle but we were able to find one lucky spot around the corner. We waited about fifteen minutes to be seated and it was well worth the wait. ( They will not sit large parties until the whole group is there) We were able to get one of the window booths which had a great view of the water and NY. The menu items all looked delicious. I really enjoyed the yogurt parfait along with my chocolate chip pancakes. The owner came by to say hello which was very nice of her. My boyfriend really enjoyed their speciality coffee. Would definitely be back! Had a great experience!
2018-03-10,2,I wrote a below average review for this place a while back and the restaurant was nice enough to respond and send me coupons for full meals for two people, so I decided to give it another shot with my roommate.  I was disappointed again.The service just isn't good and is actually somehow awkward.  We were told we had less than an hour wait but they would call when a table was ready for us, so we decided to go grab a drink at Pier 13 in the meantime.  An hour passed by and nothing, so we decided to go check.  When we got there and told the hostess, she was looking at the list and it turned out multiple people behind us on the list had already been seated!  What the heck.  My roommate asked the hostess why that happened and she didn't know what to say.  And it still took some time to be seated after that even though I spotted multiple open tables (not reserved).The food was pretty good but really not anything special, and again was not hot.  I really don't get how this place gets crowded, there are FAR better places in Hoboken (Zacks, Court Street, Onieals).
2018-03-04,1,Utter incompetence.  I used to think that the management at this location simply didn't train the employees; I now believe that the employees are affirmatively trained on how to provide the WORST customer service possible in any given situation.After a long hiatus, I decided to give this place another try -- not as a sit-down, dine-in customer, but merely as someone ordering caffeinated beverage to go from the to-go counter.  BIG MISTAKE.I was on my way to work on a Sunday morning, and the plan was to take the ferry immediately after receiving my latte.  Because I knew how poor the service (even behind the drink counter) tends to be, I made sure to allot more than enough time to order, pay, receive my drink, and catch my ferry without breaking a sweat. (For those unfamiliar, the ferry leaves from a location about 60 yards away from the restaurant.)    I enter Turning Point with 8 minutes until my scheduled ferry.  By the 6-minute mark, I've placed my order and the woman behind the counter has swiped and returned my credit card.  Significantly, my order is for a medium latte that requires only the pushing of a single button to fill up a paper cup -- this isn't Starbucks, there's no expectation that drinks be made fresh.  However, as soon as the employee hands me back my credit card, she walks away from the to-go counter without saying a word.          We still have 5 minutes until the ferry, the boat is nowhere in sight, and there's plenty of staff buzzing about the to-go area, so I figure that even Turning Point can't screw this one up.  WRONG. 4 minutes.  The other employee standing behind the counter, who purposefully avoids eye contact with all customers while he answers the phone, has also now vacated the to-go area.  A line grows behind me, full of comments such as "I don't know why I keep coming back here" and "This place is the worst."  But those commenters are the lucky ones, as they haven't already placed their orders and paid their money.  I, on the other hand, have already paid, and am being held hostage by a business that repeatedly shows its indifference toward its customers.  3 minutes, and I can now see the ferry come into full view.  It has not yet docked in Hoboken, so there's still a decent chance that I can make my ferry ... but, of course, that would require a Turning Point employee to actually show up at the to-go station and press the single button necessary to provide me with the drink that I ordered three minutes earlier.2 minutes, and although a handful of Turning Point employees have passed by, no one has thought to pay any attention to the customers at the to-go station.  Finally, I say something to a server, motion to the ferry, which is now about to dock, and let her know that I placed my order more than four minutes earlier, and that the to-go station has since been abandoned by all Turning Point employees either willing or able to push the single button that stands between me and making the ferry that, with even a modicum of customer service, I would have been outside waiting for 3 minutes earlier.  The waitress that I speak with has the appearance of a dear in the headlights, says nothing, and scurries away toward the dining room.1 minute, and passengers are boarding the ferry.  An employee who I recognize as someone who has worked at this location for a while (might be a manager) finally arrives at the to-go/beverage station, asks me what I ordered, and then pushes the button to pour my beverage.  As the ferry pulls away outside, I tell her about the above, and that I've now missed the ferry that should have been a sure thing, and her only response is: Did you already pay for your drink? I say yes, and she hands me the beverage and says "Here you go," moving on to the next customer, who for some reason waited behind me for all of this time.
2018-02-04,1,This place is totally mismanaged. They told us the wait was 30min and we finally got the table after more than an hour - few reasons we noticed : party of 2 being seated at table of 6, customers were left waiting for more than 30 minutes after their meal without being asked for checks. Orange juice was NOT freshly squeezed, food wasn't brilliant, plates were dirty, service was not great and staff is not respectful. Not recommended.
2018-01-31,5,Great food. Lovely atmosphere and very nice staff!
2018-01-28,5,Great breakfast!We arrived at around 11:10 on a Saturday and had to wait nearly 45 minutes to be seated but it was well worth the wait.We ordered a classic Eggs Benedict and a Wilbur Skillet with a Decaf iced coffee and an English breakfast tea.The waitress was getting really stressed because of how busy it was so delivered the iced coffee hot the first time, but she was very apologetic and came back to fix it.The cup they gave us for the English breakfast tea was far too small, thankfully we had a larger one from the hot coffee we had been given by mistake.We got our food delivered and it looked as good as it tasted, all of the ingredients tasted really fresh and delicious with both plates coming with a fresh (very small) bowl of fruit which was amazing!After we finished we got the check and as the waitress came to collect the check she offered us a free refill on the tea and coffee! Little hard to say no to a great cup of coffee and tea so we took it.Overall breakfast was great made with fresh ingredients, waitress staff got a little flustered but she was polite enough that we brushed it off. My favorite part was the check, it only cost $30 for the two of us to have an amazing tasting breakfast and unlimited free refills on tea and coffee.Worth the wait in line, will come again!
2018-01-27,4,A great brunch spot to meet with a group ie. family or friends coming into visit you. Plenty of space but be prepared to wait for 15-30 during the weekends, so take out is quicker, live their big easy Benedict $10.79 with a side of , have a great view of the waterfront and nyc skyline if you get a window seat. Reliable staff and they accept cash/card.
2018-01-27,5,Good for brunch, get there early or you will be waiting a long time, this place gets packed quit on the weekends.
2018-01-23,5,I visit every morning for the iced coffee of the day, and I always look forward to it. Everyone at the counter is really nice to chat with, especially Nelson! He is always so friendly, funny and positive. Thanks for always taking great care of me (and my caffeine needs!)
2018-01-10,5,Food is great portions are large atmosphere is welcoming. With a phenomenal view of the NYC skyline. This is my brunch spot for the weekends.
2018-01-07,1,If your goal is to get good food do not go to turning point. If you order from Seamless you will likely never get your order. If you do, it will be late, soggy and cold. Staff is rude and forgetful. If the North end of Hoboken wasn't such a desert of options, basic competition would have driven this glorified Diner out of business years ago.
2018-01-03,2,Came for brunch on New Years Day with a group of friends. We came during the height of the rush and they didn't have anything left on the menu. That was only the beginning and the most excusable out of all of my problems dining here this day. The waiter seemed embarrassed to inform us first, that almost all of the drinks we ordered were out. We settled instead for pitchers of orange juice, which he warned, would probably run out soon as well. He would keep disappearing to find out answers to our basic menu related questions, such as "Is the mushroom soup vegetarian?" It was at this point we realized that the cups on the table were dirty, stained with lip marks. We asked for new cups, and instead of taking our orders and then getting the cups, he disappeared to retrieve cups and made us wait to take our orders down.After finally taking our food orders he returned about ten minutes later to inform us that they were out of chicken completely. We reordered, he read back our orders, we confirmed that he had it down right, and he went off to send it in to the kitchen. We waited for about 25 minutes, and he returned to once again, read back our orders and make sure he had everything right. He asked if he forgot anything. At this point, we were over the brunch completely, and only stayed because we had been there for almost two hours already and hadn't yet gotten our food. A little bit after this, the food starting coming out. They sent me the wrong order, they put bacon on two orders that asked for it without, and they missed one order completely. While waiting for them to get it together, we asked for a side of syrup that was forgotten about until reminded. The missed order didnt get to the table until everyone was done eating, and all 4 of my friends that ordered the waffles said they came out cold.At the end, without us saying anything (I guess they realized they messed up at some point) they ducked off $-9.25 from the bill, and the lowest price meal was $-10.25. The food itself was alright. I've had better at local diners.Not worth the trip.
2017-12-29,5,The Turning Point is a classic breakfast spot in Hoboken!The service is extremely good! As soon as you walk in there are hosts ready to seat you and serve you. The two times that I visited in this past week there were plenty of people here, but also plenty of space to be seated immediately.We ordered the huevos rancheros without the chorizo, sour cream, and the tortilla. Very good!We also ordered the lemon blueberry pancakes, I would say these are okayyyyyy. Not the best pancakes you'll ever have, but definitely worth eating when you're craving pancakes.
2017-12-29,5,Great food and service.  We had chicken and waffles , eggs Benedict and they were delicious. It became our go to place during our vacation in New Jersey / New York. The location has a beautiful view of the city. Totally recommend.
2017-12-16,5,We absolutely love this place. French press coffee, great food, a friendly staff and a great view. What else could you ask for? One of our must stops when we visit the area.
2017-12-02,4,Went here for brunch. I got eggs Benedetto - basically eggs Benedict in ciabatta and my friend got huevos rancheros. He asked for bacon added and the forgot it so brought it on the side, only complaints are bacon was burnt to a crisp with both orders, and the decaf iced coffee. Very sensitive to caffeine and I'm jittery writing this right now! Overall it was good food for the price.
2017-11-22,4,This is our go-to breakfast place when we are visiting our daughter in Hoboken.  As usual the breakfast was quite good and our server, Adela, was even better.  So nice and accommodating!  All the people working there were quite helpful.  Happy people and delicious food are a winning combination for us.  The catch this time is that it was our daughters birthday and we would have a large group (10 adults and our beautiful granddaughter).  We called in early (8:00AM) and warned them that we'd be there at 11:00.  It really didn't seem to help.  We didn't get seated until a bit after 11:30 and we were crammed into a booth.  Cozy but just a bit too cozy, cramped!  Love the place but would have to reconsider when breakfasting with a large group.
2017-11-13,2,Food was good as usual but idk what it is but the service and cleanliness is going downhill quick ! I used to come here a lot . One day I came and had a terrible experience and my gf wrote the review and we got some free food the next time , the service and everything was amazing. We came back again today and The cups were dirty AGAIN and we found a hair in the omelette not to mention there were two fruit flies hovering over us the whole time . To top it off my gf went to use the bathroom and there was no paper ‍ I don't think this place is a bad place to go the food is great , some minor adjustments will make it A1 again. P.s I don't want anything for free . I don't want to go back anytime soon
2017-10-29,4,The Brunch menu has great selections. Omelets and egg dishes were delicious. not a fan of the potatoes. Asked for crispy but soggy instead :( Gets busy on the weekends.
2017-10-27,2,Decent food, terrible management and service. The food's above typical diner quality, but the service sucks. I don't know if they're ownership/management doesn't care about losing money but in the many times I've been there (I live above it so go out of convenience), it's constantly walking out the door. Nobody answers the phone when you want to place a pick up order, they take forever to get to your table when you're dining in, and the staff just seems confused and not into their jobs.
2017-10-09,5,Not sure why this place gets only 3 stars. The only complaint I have is the lack of parking, which has nothing to do with them. Anyway, my wife and I haven't been there for a long while for that reason but we patiently waited and finally got a parking spot today. And we were glad because we had a great breakfast and great service by a young lady named Jessenia. Pumpkin pancakes, a skillet & eggs over! So many other great things to select from. Try it you'll love it !!
2017-10-08,5,We come to Turning Point for breakfast every time we visit the area from Toronto which is usually 3-4 times a year. We've always experienced great service and the food has always been excellent.  My most recent visit I ordered a shrimp hash with chorizo gravy and it was the best thing I've eaten there yet. My wife loves ordering the French press Kona coffee and there is a good selection of meals for children. All in all we love this place and highly recommend it.
2017-10-01,1,Came for breakfast. Got a table and ordered. 45 mins later no food yet. Just learned it will be at least 10 more minutes. Don't come here if your hungry. Bring snacks to have while you wait!I won't be wasting time here again!
2017-09-24,5,I've been coming to Turning Point at least once a month for the last 4 years and we make sure to bring all our out of town guest and everyone always loves it. Disclaimer: my review is based on the FOOD. The service can be hit or miss and if you come on the weekend please understand you will most likely be waiting for quite some time so come prepared for that! Also, everyone complaining about reservations  - they don't take reservations! If you call ahead they will note your name so you could wait less but it's not a reservation and you still will probably have to wait! Now about their food - it's delicious! I live for their Kona French Press Coffee though the Costa Rican blend they have is also really good! My favorite dish is the Huevos Rancheros for savory and the Tropical Crunch Waffles for sweet. Though also very good is the Big Easy Benny (and Im not normally a fan of poached eggs), the Corn Bread French Toast, and the Chicken and Waffles (although I get the gravy on the side since it is pretty heavy).Lastly, the view of Manhattan is amazing (though they are doing construction on the street right now which obstructs the view quite a bit).
2017-09-23,5,We love this place. Both adults and kids enjoy it. There is a really good kids menu. Kids love chocolate chip pancakes and smores waffles - yum. I have brought so many of their friends here over the years and they all think it's great.i keep getting the popeye skillet but salads have been good too. Prices are reasonable. Staff is friendly. It is really busy on weekends. When the Sinatra Drive construction is over, the gorgeous NYC views will return.
2017-09-19,4,Visited here on a busy Saturday noon for a friends brunch! Let me say, this place has amazing customer service! It is also BYOB which was a big plus of us. With a large group, there were 2 servers assisting us and they surely made sure that each and every person was satisfied. Personally, I ordered the breakfast nachos and they were delicious! The quality and quantity were amazing! On top of that, the view from the restaurant is beautiful! I give it four starts because at the end when she brought out the bill, it was incorrect. We had already collected money from our group and then after brought out the correct bill with additional items on the check; this was kind of an hassle.
2017-09-12,3,They are currently under construction so you cannot see the skyline view! The food was great though!
2017-09-05,1,Avoid. I can't see this place lasting much longer. Worst service in Hoboken hands down! & It's only getting worse. I complained about a horrendous visit a couple weeks ago and was given a card for 2 free meals so my boyfriend and I went back and that was definitely the last time. Everyone around us was complaining...this is not an exaggeration. Every single table around us was unhappy. A couple next to us even started talking to us about how bad the service was...that says a lot! Our waiter had to keep grabbing my menu from me to read what we were ordering because he didn't know anything...ANYTHING. My coffee never came so I told him to forget it and I'd just get one at the quick service counter (which was a joke too..about 2 mins after ordering my coffee and paying, the girl behind the counter who took my order looked at me and said "wait....what are you waiting for?") You just can't make this stuff up!!! These are only a few things that happened that day..I could write A LOT more. And while it was nice that I received a comp card, when the manager took it from me, she didn't even ask if things were better this time. Not surprising since the email I got from her after my complaint was a joke...poor grammar, literally used lowercase "i's, simple words spelled wrong..it's no wonder the place is a mess! Such a shame but I can't see this place lasting much longer.
2017-09-04,3,It's incredible how a disgruntle employee has ruined my experience at this location. It takes one to ruin the whole experience.
2017-09-01,5,I really love the brunch here. Although it's recently under construction nearby the river. But trust me, you won't feel any noise inside the restaurant. They have great brunch with better price and bigger plates. I love the devil ice coffee here!
2017-08-27,2,The wait for the restaurant was way too long.  Why?  Because there is zero competition for brunch in the immediate vicinity.So we sat in the take out section at the entrance of the place.  Quick, simple, low price.  However, the bagels were straight out of the freezer section of ShopRite.  How does a restaurant on the banks of NYC, bagel capital of the world, have pathetic frozen knock off bagels?  Still scratching my head...
2017-08-27,1,When we arrived the wait was suppose to be 20 minutes. We waited 1 hour. The service was one of the worst ever. Drink orders were taken but not served for 20 minutes. Drinks came with the food..... no refills!  We even had to pick up the silverware....seriously, they need new staff!  Food on the other hand was amazing
2017-08-20,1,Nice pictures food not that good sat my kids chicken nugget were with burnt crumbs not food tastes bland my girlfriend order the shrimp skillet only got 2 pieces of shrimp
2017-08-18,1,I have been going here since it opened. My question is What HAPPENED to this place??  Arrived at 1:30 on a Friday. There was a line of 9(!!) people waiting to be greeted/seated. No host to be found. Nada. Multiple tables getting annoyed waiting for their checks.  Dirty vacated tables unbussed. No employees on the floor. Ten minutes later they started trickling back but at the speed of molasses and still largely ignoring the line of people. When we are finally seated the table is dirty. Unbelievable. Who's taken their eye off this place? I've had way too many bad experiences over the last 2-3 years. I think I'm finally done with it.Previous review (early '17):I used to go here all the time, then about a year ago had some bad experiences. Issue was primarily the service. Went back for late lunch today and I have to say I thought the waiter today at lunch was stellar. Friendly, attentive, respectful, efficient, accommodating. I wish I knew his name. Food was good as usual, but not 5 stars 5 stars for service and 4 for food. Q
2017-08-16,4,My first time here and I had such a great experience. Arrived around 11am so luckily it wasn't too busy. We were seated almost immediately. The service was pretty average and the dining area was very clean. I really enjoyed the food. I ordered the Wilbur Skillet and I loved it. I highly recommend this breakfast item. The tomatoes and avocado were fresh and the omelette itself was tasty.  It also comes with an English muffin and a little bowl of fruit! For what I was getting the price was worth it! I definitely want to come back to try other things on their breakfast menu.
2017-08-16,4,Good ambiance on river side good location neat and clean place alys a wait time on Friday sat or sun brunch they have freshly squeezed orange juice. We have been there many times for brunch
2017-08-14,1,This place has the worst service I've ever seen. It took forever for them to bring out our waters and take our orders. When they finally brought us cups one of them still had lipstick on it and we had to send it back. While we were waiting for our food we saw multiple parties get up and leave because the service was so slow and no one was getting water or orders taken. The food was mediocre and wasn't worth all the trouble. When we finally wanted to leave we weren't able to because our waitress was no where to be found. I complained to multiple people and they told me the waitress would be right there and then proceeded to stand there doing nothing and calling no one. Finally we just grabbed a menu, calculated the total ourselves and were planning to leave cash and leave. The waitress finally showed up as we were putting cash on the table. We just double checked our calculations and left. There's also horrible construction going on right in front because a large sink hole opened up. Unfortunately, that the sinkhole didn't gobble up the restaurant with it and spare people the misery of coming to this place.
2017-08-06,1,My first time visiting this turning point location - I used to be a regular visitor of the Turning Point at Long Branch.  I always enjoyed the great food, amazing services and affordable prices but unfortunately my experience at this location was not as great.Upon arrival two glasses were brought to us along with a pitcher of lemon water.  One of the glasses was noticeably dirty and we asked the waitress to please replace it with a fresh one.  We went ahead an ordered - an orange juice, a cappuccino and two breakfast plates.  25 minutes later, all that was ever brought to us was the OJ.  Our table was dirty and wet as our waitress had spilled water all over it upon pouring the tap water into the glasses, and there were never any napkins brought to our table.  There was no follow up, waitress never came by to wipe down the table or explain why the cappuccino wasn't delivered.  We got up and left (and left some cash on the table for the OJ)
2017-08-03,5,We went for breakfast here and ordered Avacado Toast, Eggs Benedetto and Hot Chocolate. The food was very fresh and delicious; and the portions very generous. The service was great too. This place has a great view of Hudson River and Manhattan Skyline though due to road construction the view is currently blocked. We are surely coming back here to try more stuff.
2017-07-24,4,Took my wife and dad here last month. Good brunch food but very long wait at the door. We knew that going in so it wasn't so bad. They would do well to offer a bit more seating to people waiting for a table.I wouldn't call it five star cuisine, but I don't think it's supposed to be. I could see it being a very charming place when it's not too crowded.
2017-07-04,3,Been here for Mother's Day and came back again to take my girlfriend out. We have no complaints about the food. The food was actually great. We had some waffles, eggs benedict, toasts, etc. The only issue we had was the CLEANLINESS of the place. Their bathroom in the morning was surprisingly dirty. There's no excuse if you literally just opened in the morning. Their glass cup were not washed.. you can see stains. Their utensils had some stains. The seats were not clean.. it seems like the manager or the workers have no standards when it comes to having a great environment. Otherwise.. they would've gotten a 4 star. I HOPE that IF we ever decide to come back.. these issues wouldn't exist.
2017-07-03,5,Great food and service. They have a sit down restaurant for breakfast, brunch, and lunch. They also have a coffee bar to pickup coffee, fruit smoothies, and muffins for on the go. Conveniently located across from the Pier 14 ferry to NYC.
2017-07-02,1,I've been coming here for years, but this was my last one. I keep coming back because their brunch menu is unique. I had the Big Easy Skillet and my daughter had the Wilbert Skillet. They are both delicious. But I have to be honest in my reviews, so I have to tell you that I was so grossed out that I almost didn't eat. I went to the bathroom and came out grossed out. The top of the urinal was brown. The inside of it, had dark brown ring and crusted. Oh, and it's not broken. There is running water. No way that a bathroom can get that dirty over night or even in a week. They just don't clean it. I then went to wash my hands and the automatic paper towel dispenser was not working so they had a big roll of paper on top of the sink so you could cut a piece and dry yourself.  Unfortunately the roll was sitting on top of the sink, so it was wet and the wet paper ripped as you pulled it apart. I then came to the table and told my wife what had happened and we could only imagine what's behind the kitchen. We looked at the glass of water and it was dirty. Didn't drink the water. Looked at the fork and knive and it was dirty. Had them returned. What a shame! I thought of talking to the manager on the side about it, but decided to take a look at some of the other reviews, and other people have complained about the same thing. What a shame!!! I guess they don't read Yelp reviews. If they did, then they just don't care, because nothing has improved. What a shame!!!
2017-06-28,2,The food here is very good.  That is not the problem.  The service is THE WORST I've ever experienced when ordering out or dining.  It is so bad in fact that signed up just so I can review in hopes that management sees this and corrects the problem.  When dining in, ive sat at the table for 15 minutes before someone came over to take the order.  Call me crazy, but for a restaurant that isn't that big I'd say that 15 min is pretty long.  Also, I've ordered delivery probably around 20 times and I can honestly say something was missing or wrong at least half the time.  That is just inexcusable and pure laziness on behalf of whoever checks the orders.  Two situations really stood out: one time they sent the wrong order, I called and told them what was missing, and they brought the wrong food AGAIN.  Another time I had beverages missing, I called, and they never returned with them.  I finally had enough and stopped ordering from them.  Note to management: please get this right.  This isn't rocket science.
2017-06-26,2,The quality of the food and the quality of the service were both terrible.  Tomato was mealy, English muffin completely soaked soggy, shrimp was over salted, iced coffee tasted like days old folders, server never asked about the food after setting down plates.  We hardly ate anything and covered the plates.  When the plates were picked up no questions about the meal.   We then sat for over 10 minutes with no bill.  Had to ask someone to go get my bill.  The iced tea never arrived but was on the bill... this was the worst meal we had in the area.
2017-06-26,4,Great brunch spot by the water tucked in the corner of Hoboken. The area is still a work in progress but the place is really great! Came on a Sunday for brunch, they are quite the popular spot. the restaurant itself is narrow so i would not recommend more than 6 people unless you call ahead. It's BYOB which is great! I had the Wilbur Skillet which was so good seriously, with a side of the peanut butter chocolate chip pancakes. The pancakes were delicious, the portion sizes are good to share. Give this place a try, it has a really nice "at home" feeling, nice and casual. Worth the wait in my opinion.
2017-06-25,5,I came here for Sunday brunch with my friends and we LOVED the food!  The Wilbur Skillet was absolutely delicious.  Their menu has an awesome selection of a variety of traditional brunch dishes, as well as unique coffee beverages. The BYOB option is also an added bonus if you want to enjoy some mimosas with your meal. Very cozy and comfortable atmosphere in a beautiful location of Hoboken with views of the water.  Highly recommend!
2017-06-25,1,I just waited 55 minutes (they told us the wait was 30 minutes) and watched them sit two groups of people that came AFTER us. We were sitting in the waiting area and they were standing, because they came after us, but the host had the audacity to tell us these people came before us. We did not complain at first. We were patiently waiting and watched these people complain, so they were sat before us. After my friend stood up to ask why this was happening very politely, the host said you are the next table being called, before she proceeded to call yet another group of people. Rude. Make sure you keep bugging them if you do want to eat here so they ignore the list and seat you. Otherwise, turn around and stay hangry.6 months later and I'm still pissed about how this experience ruined my day. Thanks again.1 year later and I'm still pissed about this experience LOL HATE THIS PLACE3 years later and I'm still pissed about this experience
2017-06-17,3,We lived in the building this establishment is in for 3 years. The ONLY thing that kept us coming back was the good food. There were multiple occasions we were offered comped meals because we were skipped while waiting for a table or our meals were incorrect. The employees take no pride in their jobs, most of them (because there are a select few that are very knowledgeable and kind) no nothing at all about the menu or the food that they serve. The serve is absolutely terrible.
2017-06-10,4,The food is really good and the portions are large. We went around 10am on Saturday and we didn't have to wait for seating but service was slow.
2017-06-04,1,Edit: they reached out to me directly to apologize and offered a comp card. Will try againCalled this morning and a man answered and said they take reservations so I put my name in and showed up at the time of my reservation and every single employee I've spoken to said they do not take reservations. A woman ahead of me said the same thing happened to her. The receptionists were completely unhelpful and rude. Every single person waiting in the waiting area had a complaint of some type about the service. I ended up just leaving after standing for 10 minutes because numerous tables were coming up to the receptionist saying they have not seen there server in 15+ minutes. After working in the restaurant industry for 4 years I was appalled at the service and lack of communication among employees.
2017-06-03,1,We stopped going to this place 3 years ago since the wait was always insane and food never impressed. Last weekend we decided to check it out again. The turning point is only 3 blocks from our apartment. Unfortunately, we will never get back again. They seated us in the back room and I counted on the clock 22 minutes until a server comes to get our drinks. They bring water and there is a huge hair in the pitcher. No silverware or someone taking our order. I walked to the manager holding the pitcher and explained the situation and asked to changed it ( as nobody would even look to our table). She says someone will come over with new one and get our order.  A server finally comes in. 15 minutes later another server brings the food. Bacon is burnt, scramble eggs are dry. The pancakes that I ordered to my 19 months old son are super dry. No butter. No extras. Corn syrup (you pay extra for maple syrup) Summary is: service is terrible and food... well, there are a ton of places that you can get way more without the humiliation of begging for someone to take your order or change water with floating hair.
2017-05-31,1,We really wanted to like this place. Terrible service, both our dishes had hair in it. And the waitress Bianca - did nothing. After we pointed out the issue with our food, she avoided coming to our table and said manager will stop by soon. And when she first served us the food, I told her to get the bill as we were in a hurry. I had my card on the table so she then came by and grabbed it and just the bill and you wait for the manager.
2017-05-21,1,I wish i could have given zero stars. We called ahead to tell them we would be arriving at 1pm for a table of 4. They said no problem. After arriving and telling them we were there, hostess told us there was only one group in front of us. Twenty minutes passed by and we inquired about our table which we thought would be ready. Hostess told us our table was being wiped down and getting set. Another twenty minutes passed by and we were still not seated even though there were multiple empty tables. Not only had we not been seated, but staff prepared a table for a group of 5 and sat them, but there was one problem - only 2 out of the 5 in the group were present. There is a sign at the front that says "entire party must be present in order to be seated." We had our entire party there for forty minutes. After asking hostess about this, she rudely dismissed me and told me my table would be the next one. I knew this must be true bc we were the only ones waiting for a table at this point. After being seated, our server came over and took our drink orders. We had a bottle of champagne with us. After a few minutes, server comes back and sets down a coffee pot and a pitcher of water, however there were no glasses to be seen. After asking for glasses and cups, server takes our orders. Server then comes back after forgetting one of our orders and asks again what we ordered. We reminded her we still needed glasses for coffee and water. Another few minutes pass by and some customers started being loud and pointing at the floor. It turns out there was a mouse running around the floor of the restaurant. Server then came back and said they ran out of champagne glasses, but at this point when we found out there was a mouse, we got up and left. It was as if no staff at the restaurant could have cared less about serving us. The single worst "dining" experience of my life.
2017-05-14,1,Terrible service here. Got there knowing I'd have to wait. The hostess said 35 minutes. After an hour they said it would be another hour. Hostess didn't care at all. Don't believe whatever wait time they tell you.
2017-05-13,4,Nice brunch place right on the water front. Theh take call ahead reservations which is very convenient. The portions are very generous and only go on an empty stomach.The food does take some time to come but it is well made. We got chocolate chip pancakes (which were good), blueberry pancakes, the mexican breakfast bowls, healthy veggie fritata (i loved the way they baked it on the pita bread), eggs benedict and avocado toast.They did add sausage to my bowl but replaced it pretty quickly. The view is nice but currently has been hampered by the construction. The coffee was average, the sugar sticks were cute and nicely thought out.
2017-05-13,3,This place is consistent no matter the location. It offers solid breakfast fare but it's not outstanding. Type service is always pleasant but it's tough to get a table since they are so busy...maybe it has a bit of a cult following because there are many other restaurants that do breakfast/brunch better and cheaper. I had extremely salty eggs Benedict and had ask for some spinach. The sauce was acidic and the spinach and English muffin were raw. However, the coffee and juice were delicious. My friend had the tropical waffle which is always tasty!
2017-05-05,5,Love this place! Fresh orange juice. If you're a coffee drinker, their coffee is great and strong. The environment was quiet. The service was great and the server always made sure we were satisfied. The food was very good! We got the berry chocolatey and asked for not a lot of chocolate drizzle on it and it was just right! The western and Tuscany omelette was amazing and very filling.  The Wilbur skillet was in a big portion and a solid dish. It could've used more avocado and less bacon but good overall. I loved how we were able to take coffee to go!
2017-05-02,5,I've been a few times and I'm definitely a fan. Good food and reasonable prices! I haven't had anything I didn't like. I did get a couple of dirty glasses.... but the food is good enough I'm turning a blind eye this time.
2017-04-25,2,The only reason I am giving this 2 stars it's because I never get my order correct. I have been calling a lit of time and every time there is something wrong with my delivery. They need to get it together with their order takers. For example I ordered a few minutes ago the " no yolk " omelette cause simply I am on a diet. Guess what? Instead I got the ny omelette. And this always happens. Not cool.
2017-04-24,4,We waited an hour for view seating but they are under construction so we didn't get much of a view/ the salted caramel pancakes were the best pancakes I tried and were delicious !!! Def recommend those
2017-04-16,5,Had the Wilbur Skillet and Havana BLT Wrap! The skillets are excellent and the view is to die for. Probably one of the best brunch places in Hoboken.
2017-04-15,4,food was okay, the waiting time was over an hour and a half just for brunch. meh
2017-04-10,5,Thoroughly enjoyed my first experience at Turning Point. I had my parents visiting and could not pick a place for breakfast/lunch as in my opinion, many of the restaurants in Hoboken had limited selections and taste specific items. Luckily I found Turning Point and was drawn to all the pictures of the food!I saw from other reviews that there can be a wait but we called ahead and put our name on the list. By the time we walked there our table was ready. I got the chicken and waffles me they were amazing... like actually. My parents both got omelette/egg options and I know they enjoyed theirs as well. Many items to pick from and each dish looks colorful and pretty. Definitely will be going back to try more!Also Marco was our waiter and he was awesome, very nice and friendly.
2017-04-09,5,Seriously OBSESSED with this place. The food is incredible and so affordable! This is my go-to brunch spot in Hoboken (and all of my friends as well). Huevos rancheros, peanut butter chocolate chip pancakes, fruit & granola waffles... there isn't a bad thing on the menu. Try it, I promise you will not be disappointed!
2017-04-06,5,BRUNCH Heaven. This place is amazing. I've been there twice and both times I've been extremely surprised at how amazing the service, food, ambiance, smell, look of the place even with the construction going on. Oh man, I love this place! I had the OMG PANCAKES one slice only, how cool is that they do that? The server told me to try both sweet and savory and I did and it was awesome. The OMG pancakes had mascarpone, bacon, Carmel sauce..... so good. I also tried the Wilbur skillet which was great, my favorite thing is the Artisian Toast: avocado, lemon zest, tomatoes on whole wheat toast. This. Place. Rocks! Open for breakfast and brunch. Don't forget to try the French press: Costa Rican was the best. Hawaiian was okay! But oh man Love them!
2017-04-01,5,Great food, good atmosphere. Great well priced food. Came for brunch and enjoyed a "build your own skillet" stayed well past the kitchens closing and not only was the staff friendly and accomodating but they never asked us to leave and even had some great conversations with us. (Dont do that though its kind of messed up lol) Was surprised to see the rating so low on here, definitely in need of an update. Will be back.
2017-03-16,1,Visited first time for breakfast and not a very pleasant experience. Server Marco brought us to table..1) Water glasses on table were dirty and had to ask to get it replaced, he brought washed glasses from inside but they were wet and not dried glasses.2) Ordered Pressed coffee he brought it but didn't brought milk which we had asked for it, and took over 10minutes to get us milk while we sit with coffee.3) Finally after our Omlette we ordered pancakes, he brought the pancakes and we had to ask if we could get Fork, which took him over 5minutes to get simple fork.Every thing done and I purposely gave less gratuity due to lack of service by Marco and cleanliness. And week later I see my statement and he over charged the gratuity than what I had originally put on my receipt. Isn't that's a crime??? Luckily I saved the receipt. Small details matter as much as quality of food and that's what hospitality is all about.
2017-03-14,4,Turning Point made my weekend brunch a very pleasant experience! We met my wife's friend and her daughter at the restaurant, and the second we walked in and spotted her, they were calling our names for our table...perfect timing! We slowly made our way through chatty patrons as they awaited the call of their names and were seated at a booth by the front window. The view of NYC is awesome, a little hampered at the moment by some construction, but nevertheless awesome.Our server was great. He gave us time to get settled, took our orders, kept the table straight, gave us tools to open up our friend's daughter's toys, etc. He did it all. If you are vegan, the options are limited...I'm pretty sure they can modify a few items. I ordered the avocado toast and a side bowl of fruit. I know if sounds simple, but it was amazing! The fresh, ripe tomatoes on top of the toast with the fresh cracked black pepper really set it off! The hint of olive oil and lemon really brought the taste of the avocado out. I know that I'm sounding pretty excited over this toast, but trust me, you will too! Everything else was great, the fruit was fresh, the coffee was good...not one complaint during my experience here. Keep in mind, during weekend brunch hours it can get crowded, so expect a wait...but the food and the view are well worth it!
2017-03-12,5,Loved the country vibe in the city of this place! The French press coffee was perfection and so was the food. Unfortunately construction was in place so we couldn't enjoy the view but will definitely being going back!
2017-03-11,5,Best brunch in town! BYOB, great food, great iced coffee, nice location - what more could you ask for?! Waits are long so come early or be prepared! Staff is a little eh but after a few mimosas you get over it.
2017-03-11,1,Average food. Terrible service. It's as if the staff has never been trained on how to run a restaurant. Came back again because it's generally a good place for kids. The high chairs are filthy. FILTHY. Again the wait staff simply cannot take an order and get it right. I am blown away by the incompetence.
2017-03-05,1,I really wanted to like this place because I had heard good stuff about it. And after waiting 45 minutes (when I was told 20min) I thought, man this place HAS to be good. Well...First: we were sat down at a table that wasn't wiped properly. It had syrup stuck to it. Our utensils and cups were filthy. I requested clean ones and got the same dirty ones back. I had to take a cup with water and cleanse them myself. Yeah, you read that right. Food: I had a latte which tasted like watered down brown water, followed by the Popeye skillet. The skillet was drowning in what seemed like water from the boiled spinach? I seriously don't know but my potatoes were soggy; it was also salty. My daughter had the Wilber skillet, which she said was fine except salty as well and a large OJ which fine. I did not enjoy my food at all.Service: our waiter looked and behaved like he couldn't be bothered to serve one more person. He took forever to provide the "clean" utensils and to bring us our check.Bathrooms: dirty and disgusting!I was very disappointed and have NO desire to ever come here again.
2017-02-09,4,I really like this place. We usually ride our bikes along the Hudson River boardwalk to it on weekends.  It does get crowded and a little loud on weekends but they move fast and there never seems to be too long of a wait. The coffee is good and the brunch meals are really nice. I've had a variety of omelettes and pancakes. Really a lovely breakfast place.
2017-02-07,3,Food is average, nothing I've ever gotten from here was amazing but they do have good service. Once I ordered something for delivery and they forgot my soup so when I called to complain they offered me an entire complimentary meal next time I ordered for delivery or came in to dine. That was great. The view is nice also. Cute little brunch spot. I got the Benedict chorizo avocado cornbread meal and it was pretty tasty!
2017-01-30,4,Gets a bit crowded on the weekends, but the food is great--love the Martha's Vineyard salad and omelettes. Also, the coffee is just perfect addition to a Saturday morning brunch.
2017-01-24,3,We went on a Sunday afternoon and the wait was incredibly long...so this obviously meant that the food was a going to be amazing. The lady said it was going to take 45 minutes, but we got seated after a little over a hours wait. Staff was friendly. I had the burrito which was stuffed with quinoa, kind of over stuffed with quinoa for my taste. Next time I go there I think I would just stick to a egg skillet instead of the burrito. Their caramel latte was a hit.
2017-01-15,2,This place has so much promise with a great location and a fun menu. It's too bad the staff ruins it. The wait staff were rude and didn't seem to care about anything. The tables and cups were dirty when we sat and we were there at opening. It took us asking three times to get enough place settings for our group and I had to send a plate back for being cold. They took it into the kitchen and five minutes later brought it back out microwaved. It looked exactly the same as when they took it just soggy and wilted. Don't get anything with the sausage gravy! You've been warned. We sat near the kitchen door so I could hear the microwave beeping all morning. The French press coffee was good at least. This place needs management that gives a damn because the current management is letting the crappy staff run this place into the ground.
2016-12-29,2,Delivery took two hours and our food was cold, pretty disappointing overall. Not sure why sandwiches and salads take that long.
2016-12-28,4,In the mood for some slammin', jammin', smoked hammin'  breakfast and delicious french press coffee? Come to Turning Point in Hoboken! Visited this establishment recently with my favorite dining partner and it was still good as ever. The decor is very beach influenced and reminds me of being "down the shore" that is Jersey shore, bunch of nautical themed trinkets fill the waiting and dining area.The food is satisfying and they have some unique combinations to traditional breakfast dishes. I played it pretty safe this time around and got the wilbur special which is a skillet consisting of crushed bacon, potatoes, avocado, diced tomatoes, Monterrey Jack cheese with eggs (any style). Also, it comes with an English muffin and a small fruit bowl! For the price of $8.49 you really can't find a better deal in town. Can't wait to come back again and step out of my comfort zone, maybe with the OMG French toast! (sweet mascarpone, sugar walnuts, caramel drizzle and chopped Virginia smoked bacon)
2016-12-18,5,My husband and I love this place! It is on permanent rotation for weekend breakfasts. The menu is outrageous with delicious and decadent breakfast food. They also have fall/winter and spring/summer menus which are always seasonally appropriate and tasty. The Wilbur skillet, heuvos rancheros, and iron man combo are our faves. Also the new avocado toast is incredible!!!! Worth a trip for a festive breakfast experience. Staff are so lovely and friendly! They handle the stress of high maintenanced Hoboken folks pretty well especially when it gets crowded.
2016-12-18,5,This is probably my favorite brunch spot around. Their French toast is something I dream about. They do not disappoint. They have amazing hot cocoa selections as well!
2016-12-10,4,Love this place. Views of the city are amazing and such a solid breakfast/brunch/lunch spot. Upset they took my favorite breakfast off the menu - chunky monkey pancakes! But still an awesome place. Staff is always super nice!
2016-12-06,3,I really like the atmosphere of this place and it had interesting cocoa selections. Brunch was good but nothing out of the ordinary. We tried the Wilbur skillet, skinny hot cocoa and the Reese's peanut butter cocoa. Only issue was I went for the view as well since my friend came to visit from out of state but the construction was totally blocking it...
2016-11-28,1,This place is a joke. 1 star since they comped our bill and we are loyal happy customers of the turning point in Manalapan. All of us work in customer service so everyone at my table has patience for dining experiences. I went with 5 friends on a Monday afternoon for brunch. 1. When we got there there was no wait, plenty of available tables and the ".hostess"  asked us how many. We said 5, he walked away and then we stood there for 15 minutes. 2. We sat down and we didn't get approached by a waiter or waitress for 20 minutes. No water in the glass, nothing. 3. The tables that sat down after us had their food on the table before we had our drinks. 4. The waitress does not introduce herself and just asks if we know what we want to eat. 5. 20 minutes later our coffee arrives, yahoo. 6. We are now the last people in the place and the waitress comes over to tell use they are out of the soup we ordered, okay so are looking over the menu for new items and she walks away. This is the last we saw of her. 7. The other "server" aka assistant manager comes over to take the food subs. 8. The food comes out cold. Apps came out with the meals. The sunny side up eggs were overlooked. We are not happy. 9. We ask to speak to a manager and the assistant manager aka server informs us that she can help us. We explain our stressors and that really we were just looking for better service. 10. She walks away without saying anything. 11.  The assistant manager had a horrible attitude like every other employee there, so I am not surprised that the waiters and waitresses were rude as well. If you want a free meal and shitty rude service check them out!
2016-11-05,4,One of my favorite breakfast places in Hoboken. The food is really good, the French press coffee divine and the view of the Hudson can't be beat. The room has a New England vibe and on a sunny day it feels like you're on vacation. I wish they opened up a little earlier on weekdays and I'd go more often but it's just about perfect.
2016-10-23,5,Love this place! Cornbread French toast is amazing! The staff is always helpful and friendly! Our go to place in Hoboken!
2016-10-08,4,Love the lobster Benedict. The huevos rancheros was ok, too much potatoes and unconventional presentation. Been here a few times and most of the selections are good.
2016-09-16,3,Way too busy and had disorganized hostesses. Beware that the outdoor hostess will only seat you outside. But she won't inform you of that. They ran out of ice while we were there, which was a big minus on a hot day.Food was okay, but I wouldn't go back.
2016-09-11,5,The way that eggs Benedict should be!!! The hollandaise sauce is smooth and perfectly frothy not thick and distasteful. I  got the Marsala Benedict. Mushroom lovers will devour every tiny piece of this amazing plate. Turning point you have made your way to my breakfast heart. My group got the original Benedict and the big easy with the corn bread. Also, one my friend got the French toast. Aside from the amazing breakfast that you will be served at this location, the view of the ocean and the NYC skyline is as great as the greatness of this Hoboken eatery. Cheers Turning Point
2016-09-10,2,One of the worst egg Benedict I have ever had. They put a lot of stuff in the egg Benedict like tomato, red pepper ... Such a weird combination . The egg is not that good and the fries are bad. Never want to go back.
2016-09-09,4,My boyfriend and I go to Turning Point pretty often for breakfast. It's a tiny bit more creative and homey than a typical New Jersey diner. Staff here are excellent - I've never encountered issues with their wait staff or hostess, so I give them a thumbs up for that. Their food is good and portion size is just right, sometimes I can't finish my dishes. I've never tried their sweet breakfast items, but their omelettes are always a good choice, and their healthy section of the menu is very flavorful, in which some places that offer this often lack. I'll continue to come here as its close by, friend and best that it's right on the water!
2016-09-08,3,First let me say this...we LOVE the food here. We LOVE the view here. What we don't love is the service. It's one of the best breakfast joints in Hoboken and you can't beat the view of Manhattan however the service is consistently below par. At our last venture we ate outside, and were sat after someone who arrived later than us. Which was fine however when they sat us, we didn't have silverware or drinkware until our entrees came. It was slow to get the bill and just an overall feeling of disarray. At one point our server even made a loud cellphone call right behind our table. Please, please, please get some training in here. This place has the potential to be THE best breakfast spot in Hudson county if/when the service improves.
2016-09-06,4,A love letter to Turning Point's Big Easy Benedict:Our love affair has carried on for quite a while now. Even when I'm tempted to cheat I know I will regret it. I didn't think you could get any better until this past weekend when you were served with the peppers and onions diced instead of sliced in the usual large strips. Such a small change that made such a big difference in enjoyability. You taste like no other breakfast food I've ever had before and I will cherish you for all the days of my life. Love,A huge fan
2016-09-01,5,French press coffee, omelettes,  speciality pancakes & French toast.....yum! Add in a spectacular view of Manhattan - what more can you ask for?
2016-08-31,2,Food is never done right. Service is slow. Place gets super gross. And when you wait for someone to seat you, you get a stare down. Two stars for the location and the awesome seating.
2016-08-26,1,I absolutely love the food and it has been my go-to for ordering delivery because the Wilbur Skillet is great but the logistical planning is awful. I order from them a lot and had multiple bad experiences in the past but gave it another shot and it was consistently better for awhile. However, my last order was 45 minutes later than promised. Don't tell me 45 minutes then come in double the amount of time. My eggs were cold and the avocado was brown. Very highly considering not ordering from here again which is a shame because I really enjoy the food.
2016-08-21,3,Unexpectedly and across this restaurant Sunday for breakfast. It was one block past where informally turn off on Sinatra Drive. I sat at the counter. Lively looking place. They have French Press coffee on the menu; although expensive it is great special treat was smelling the fresh ground coffee as the coffee was being ground   I ordered the blueberry pancakes with 'Power Grain' multi-grain. Unfortunately I do not recommend that as it tasted very gritty and was possibly under cooked. But staff was pleasant enough and I'll return to given them another chance.
2016-08-16,5,came her for breakfast with my son and his godparents and it was a great experience! from the atmosphere to the food I will definitely come back! I had the OMG French toast but substituted the pumpkin cinnamon mascarpone for the vanilla bean. So delicious! I ordered my son the kids meal of scrambled eggs, home fries and English muffin w/ butter and he almost ate the whole plate! which was like an adult plate anyway.
2016-08-10,1,Horrible experience.. Came here with my husband and child. First we were seated -- wasn't give enough utensils for everyone to eat. Had to ask for it.. Wasn't given napkins to wipe our hands on. Food was ehh.. Service was horrible. Waited over 30 minutes for a check - Server was Beatriz. She never checked on us after we got our food.. Never saw her again until after asking for my check 3 times.. Which I had to get out my seat for to ask another cashier for it. He then proceeded to give it to me.. She's so lucky she got $5.00 (thanks to my husband) because her service wasn't even worth that. Absolutely horrible!
2016-08-08,4,Fantastic spot for brunch, but expect crowds and a 45 min wait for a table on the weekends.  We caught an Uber from Newport and got there in five minutes, then asked to sit at the bar so we were sipping coffee in another ten, nice.  We had their skillets, the super healthy one with avocado and veggies, and mine with potatoes, eggs over easy and sour cream.  The eggs oozed out and mixed with the sour cream making this yummy sauce.  I really loved it.  I don't think you can go wrong with their skillets, but other items on the menu looked really good too.  Looking forward to coming back.
2016-07-27,4,Came here because I saw the view of NYC posted on other reviews. Score! The views alone are worth coming here, not to mention the fact you can get breakfast at 2:40 in the afternoon. Lemon blueberry pancakes, scrambled eggs and a side of bacon sounded good to me and indeed it was. The only knock, which I know it's not their fault, the AC is not working right now. Oh, also, they were a little slow to seat me, and a customer walking out told me they were on the slow side, so if you're in a hurry, this is not the place to come. Other than that, service was friendly.
2016-07-27,4,I live just a block away from Turning Point and I go there every weekend. The service is very poor, but the food is great. My advice is to try the lobster benedicts. I'm addicted to it.
2016-07-26,2,This is normally my to go place for brunch because Im normally very satisfied with the custome service. I ordered the veggie omlette and a side of bacon. Im accustomed to ordering the wilbur skillet, but this time i decided to get something lighter. So i ordered the veggie omlette with a tea.The tea cup was dirty! Inside the water pitcher was also dirty with brownish stains inside. Of course I resquested a new cup!My order came with home fries, we all know how home fries are right? Seasoned fries, normally has a light  reddish hue due to the seasoning sometimes accompanied by red pepper. Well i have burnt potatoes that were cut into cubes. After bringing this to my waitresses attention, she brought out another plate of unseasoned fries with burnt marks, the only difference was the quantity. I had more burnt potatoes this time! She actually asked was it better this time, ugh no but Ill take it. I just put it down and didnt touch it. They reduced my bill because of it, but i went there because i was willing to pay for great food. I order home fries because i know their home fries are great. Over all this situation kind of turned me off. Hopefully i can get consistent service and food from this point on.
2016-07-17,1,I called to make a reservation and they told me to put my name down because there was a 25 minute wait. We drove from Secaucus got here and when we arrived the gay black kid at the front who was rude and had no host skills what so ever told us we had to wait 25 more minutes for an available seat. I guess this is what you get when you come down to a place where nothing but rude ignorant yuppies who think there better then everyone lives. This place is a joke never come here I'll rate this place with no stars a cross the board
2016-07-17,4,Service: unfortunately the service was pretty poor.. Or maybe it was just our server? We were seated for a table of 9 and given to pitchers of water.... But no cups? Our server also failed to check how our food was and if we need anything. By the middle of our meals we were so thirsty because he never came back to refill the pitchers of water. Food: I ordered the chicken and waffles which came with dried cranberries. I must say it went pretty well together. However. The chicken was more of tenders which were alright if you like tenders. The presentation was really nice though. All my other girlfriends got the lobster Benedict. Not sure how it tasted but I didn't hear any complaints.
2016-07-09,1,I wish i could comment on the food, unfortunately we never got to a point of being served. A couple of friends and myself decided to make our way to this place for some brunch, and from the moment we walked in i knew the staff was going to be the highlight of the day. We walk in and are greeted by a teenage host I'm assuming who asked us how many in our party, we said 3 and stood there as he discussed among himself and some servers who were there as to where to seat us, that lasted a couple minutes. We were seated at the far right side of the establishment and were given menus. We sat there with menus for 20 minutes before a friend had to turn around and just stare at the bar to get someone to acknowledge our presence. A young lady came to our table about a minute later and stated that she was not our server but she would take our drink orders. So we put in the drink orders and continue to sit, quite aggravated at the service at this point. About 10 minutes later the same young lady comes back without any drinks to let us know that they cannot make my friends latte. This wouldn't be such a big deal if we hadn't already sat through the rest of the horrible service. This whole time we still hadn't even met our server. We promptly decided to leave and told the young lady to never mind our drinks. This place really needs a more experienced staff, the food can be great but people don't go out to eat just for the food, they expect some form of service which this places young staff definitely doesn't provide. Very disappointing.
2016-07-07,5,Went with my boyfriend on a Wednesday morning for brunch. Service is awesome and the food is delicious. Sat outside and the view made everything more enjoyable. Perfect little spot for breakfast/ lunch.
2016-07-05,4,This is my first time coming here so I decided to take out my friend for her birthday. It's a nice area with comfortable chairs and great view. I had ordered the" plain pancakes" and she ordered the "OMG French Toast" they were both pretty good. We had an inexperienced waitress, with this being her second day but she was pretty nice. She could've been more attentive, but I guess she'll learn as she works. I'll probably come back again and try the chocolate pancakes they had on their menu. You should all come through to check it out, it's nice.
2016-07-05,5,Came here during 4th of July weekend so it was not crowded and did not have to wait for outdoor seating.  Our waitress, Allison, was great and even brewed us fresh coffee.  I had the breakfast burrito and my parents had the banana pancakes and lemon blueberry pancakes.  This menu is way better and more extensive than other Turning Point menus.  No complaints with the food, and for a decent price (10$), you get more than enough food.  Would definitely recommend for brunch or lunch.
2016-07-04,5,My favorite egg Benedict spot in Hoboken. Their big easy benedict is so BOOM!! The sauce, egg, avocado and corn bread are just perfect. Also a nice view of midtown Manhattan across the Hudson River. Our server is always Shannon, and he's the best. GREAT SERVICE, VIEW & FOOD
2016-06-26,4,The food was very good. I enjoyed Popeye skillet and chunky monkey pancakes. My husband had some chicken and Belgian waffles. We both had coffees as well. The only thing that bothered us was the service that took way to long for a place that should be quick - therefore 4 starts.
2016-06-26,1,Came here on a Sunday, we were a group of 6. We got there early and added our name to the list. We were told that our wait time would be 35 minutes, which we thought was reasonable so we decided to wait. After 35-40 mins we checked to see if our table was ready and were asked to wait another 35 mins. We checked again after 35-40 mins and were given the same response. At this point we had already been waiting over an hour. The hosts were extremely rude..not just to me but also my friend..especially the gentleman who seemed to have too much attitude and definitely needs a lesson on how to treat customers with respect and courtesy. The two hosts kept seating 2-3 people at the larger tables and made groups of 6 and above wait for hours. We decided to eat here because we had already waited over an hour. We ordered a wide range of items. The food was strictly OK. Service was average, the waitress forgot to bring my friend's order (pitalia wrap), which we eventually had to bring back because everyone else had finished eating. There are better brunch options in Hoboken, with more courteous staff. There is nothing about this place- food or service that will make me or my friends go back. DO NOT RECOMMEND this place!
2016-06-10,1,I have been here before on the weekend and got fabulous service, however on a Friday at lunch time the service was awful. I don't normally write reviews but the waitress did not bring my map I ordered, it was 15 min after my friends got there's, she did not even order to discount the bill. We also waited 10 min to have anyone come over to us to get menus and then another 10 min to take our drinks. Awful. This is clearly only a place to come on the weekends. Subpar service on weekdays.
2016-06-02,3,The view is beautiful and the patio is a lovely setting for summer lunch. The food is also good. Unfortunately, the service is consistently horrible. I've been coming here for over 2 years and every single time I sit outside, the service is horrendous. I was a waitress from high school to my masters degree and never did I see such a thing. The staff needs to be trained on efficiency and speed. There was 4 tables and they had 5 persons going back and forth. They kept on going back and forth aimlessly and the service was slow and disorganized.
2016-05-31,2,There are 3 places in Hoboken that serve brunch on a weekday. This place happens to be one of them, which is probably why we come here once in a while. The food is decent but the wait is ridiculous. No matter how busy or not they are, it takes no less 20-25 min to get your eggs or french toast. Service is lacking and seems that they just don't care about gaining repeat business. Bring a snack to hold you over while you wait.
2016-05-30,4,One of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken. Whenever I've come to eat here, I've always been seated right away. Since I went during Memorial Day Weekend, I was worried about seating but if you go early Sunday Morning, no wait AND available street parking which is in itself a miracle in Hoboken amirite? The service was great and the waiter was very attentive. We ordered the French press coffee since it's easy to split with a group but in my opinion wasn't all that great. They do serve it with rock candy for sugar which is cute, but the coffee itself was meh. I ordered the Tuscany Omelette which was so delicious! Large serving and I was barely able to finish it, but I packed it away. My fiancé got the huevos rancheros which looked delicious and was good, but nothing exceptional. It was served over a cold tortilla wrap where other restaurants it will come with a hot or warm one instead. My mom got the lemon blueberry pancakes which I've ordered before and they are delicious! The pancakes taste so fresh and the lemon rind in the batter is so refreshing. Overall, I would definitely come back. The view is beautiful when the weather is nice and prices are fair.
2016-05-19,3,The service here is always terrible. The menu is actually pretty good with a nice view of Manhattan. Try to avoid this place on weekends. I've eaten here 20+ times as I live very close and I will never go in on weekends.
2016-05-17,3,I'd had brunch here before, but it was a couple years ago and I guess wasn't that memorable. However, I ordered food from here recently and now feel more confident giving a review.I can kind of see why I didn't really remember all too clearly how my experience here was previously - the food just wasn't all that special. This time, we ordered a bowl of the turkey chili, the turkey club sandwich, the basic skillet with scrambled eggs and mixed veggies and chicken tenders (off the kid's menu lol). The food took about an hour to arrive after ordering on Seamless, which was the approximate timing it had stated. The delivery woman was friendly, which was nice.The clear plastic containers they put the food in was sort of nice, organizationally. Nothing was ambushed or spilling. However, the plastic was burned through by the chicken tenders - they put the chicken on the plastic too quickly after trying it so there were holes in the plastic. This rendered the chicken inedible because it's now got melted plastic on it (even if you can't see it) - high risk of cancer. As for the food that we could eat, the potatoes that the chicken came with were subpar - they weren't seasoned well and the texture was meh. The turkey in the sandwich was quite dry, and the turkey chili was very watery and the taste wasn't all there. My boyfriend did enjoy his basic skillet, however. Was generally disappointed with our takeout food. I might give it another shot in person, but we'll see.
2016-05-16,1,The one star is for location. I don't even know where to begin. This place couldn't go out of business fast enough. The employees who work the counter to get coffee and things to go are slow and incompetent. I ordered a croissant this morning with 8 minutes before my ferry would arrive. The guy rung me up and then left. 7 minutes later he comes back with a burnt croissant. I asked why it was burnt. He said that he just toasted it. I've never once had a toasted croissant. I've never even been asked if I wanted a toasted croissant. I left it there even after I had paid for it.Don't bother with breakfast or brunch either. Not only is the wait insane but the hostesses consistently underestimate the wait which consistently results in angry customers.If there is an investor out there looking for a mismanaged gold mine. Buy this business, make a ton of money, and do Hoboken residents a favor.
2016-05-15,5,I don't know where to start so I'm going to sum it all up in one word "Incredible" Incredible food Incredible serviceIncredible view of the Hudson River. By all means my top pick of the year!!!!I just love it here!!!! 2nd or 3rd time here and will always come back when visiting Hoboken. This is a very special place for my husband and I.
2016-05-13,2,So my sister has recommended this place to me and could not say enough good things about it. Well, sadly, turns out that the food was above par but the service was horrendous. Actually goes on my top three for worst services. My friend and I got seated immediately because it was a quiet Thursday afternoon: there were only a couple other tables filled, not enough to be crazy busy but enough people that there was a nice hum of business. It took the waitress five minutes to bring our water, five minutes to bring the glasses we could drink out of, we asked for a table change because of the sun and it took her ten minutes to clean the table, when I received my iced tea, it came with no straw so I literally waited for ten minutes for her to come back over so that I could ask for a straw. No apologies, no rush. I was a server and I know what's good and bad manners as a waiter. It was painfully obvious that she did not want to be there looking at how slow she moved, literally strolling when patrons were getting impatient for food. When our order finally came, I had to ask her for utensils. Which took another few minutes to get. And when she was back, my friend asked if we could get two small plates because we were sharing food. The waitress lifted the eggs Benny saucer off the hot plate and grabbed the doily and told us to use the bottom plate, which was used as just a serving plate. My friend and I were affronted. She couldn't even get us plates? Seriously? I would understand if she were hectic and every table was filled. Only half the tables were full, and from what I could see, everyone got pretty much the same crap, lazy service. Really ruined my meal which is a shame because I liked the lobster Benedict. They gave a good amount of meat and the English muffins were nice and crunchy, soft on the middle. The eggs were a tad over but the pairing of hollandaise, paprika, lobster, avocado, and tomato with bacon was so good I didn't care much. The French toast was meh. I expected more but the consistency of the bread was a little gross. Too soggy for my liking. I don't think I'll be going back here anytime soon. The view is nice, but you can get that same view with better service and an overall better meal anywhere up and down the Hudson from Edgewater to Hoboken. No need to suffer through this waitress's lack of motivation to do her job correctly.
2016-05-08,1,Does not accept reservations, has a bar but no alcohol (so no mimosas on Mothers Day for brunch). Small and crowded and staff is unprepared. Leaving for somewhere else.
2016-05-07,5,Great place for breakfast. Worth the wait. Proves that simple breakfast can be excellent.
2016-04-30,5,I love this brunch spot , I found it a couple months ago and I can't go anywhere else. The food is so fresh more in the weekends because it's soo packed . The food is great I always get the Wilbur skillets and a cappuccino. The poached eggs are amazinggg I wish I can do them myself. The atmosphere is so comforting. I love the country home style of it . I'm already thinking of when I'm going back. The wait on the weekend is crazy it could be like 30-40 minutes but I think it's worth it . A lot of the time hostess has a nasty attitude but that's always happening when I go here .
2016-04-29,5,Great breakfast spot. The coffee and food are delicious! It's very busy on weekends, but if you go during the week you won't have to wait too long. If you are in the mood for something sweet, try their Belgium waffle, it comes with fresh fruit, granola, maple syrup and strawberry spread!
2016-04-25,1,Never going back again. The service was beyond terrible. Rude hostess. Took 25 minutes to get a drink. Food was cold. Attempted to split the bill and they said it wasn't possible, which is simply untrue in this day and age. After all this hassle the cards were charged twice. Huge pain. Go to Anthony David's they're amazing.
2016-04-24,5,Great fresh food wt alot  ligth  Breakfast  & Lunch Menu  you will enjoy  is  in / out  tables.   But   parking  is hard  plus 20 min wait
2016-04-22,4,This place is always packed on weekend mornings, but it's definitely worth the wait, you'll be satisfied. I love their juevos ranchero, and the berry chocolatey pancakes as well as the Wilbur skillet! Some plates come with a side of fruit or an English muffin. I've been coming here for quite a few years, they never fail me. My only unsatisfactory would be that the coffee is a bit too weak, sometimes it taste too watery.
2016-04-17,3,Food is phenomenal. Hands down. Best breakfast spot. I am only giving 3 stars because it took two hours once to get my delivery and the girl who answered the phone said "it'll be there in a few minutes."
2016-04-17,2,What a disappointing experience. After being told there was a 20 minute wait, we waited for 1 hour as a group of 4. Groups of 2 people were being sat down at 6 person tables, creating a slew of inefficiencies as then place was unable to turn over a table in a normal/competitive amount of time. The hostess and management "team" here have no idea what they are doing. After we sat down we had 4 dirty glasses on our table and were told they ran out of ice. At 11:30AM on a Sunday morning in Hoboken when the weather is 75 degrees. When they brought back new glasses, they were dirty again!! I cant make this stuff up. The food is very good (i've been here several times) but the constant theme is that the there are a group of incompetent people running the place who are not incentivized to use their brains and add value.
2016-04-10,4,The only reason I give this spot 4 stars is the wait for ordering out. Otherwise, the breakfast sandwich I ordered was massive and the bagel was perfectly toasted. I tried their vanilla chai tea latte, which is dispensed from a machine. It was a hot, milky drink that satisfied my sweet tooth!
2016-04-09,5,This place is our favorite spot for brunch. They have the best Marsalla Benedict in the US. I highly recommend this place.
2016-04-03,4,Great go to spot for brunch. The food is very consistent. I always know what to expect when coming here. The only problem is if you don't get here early, the wait is forever.
2016-04-01,5,Overall great experience. Came on a Thursday around noon. Not too busy. Was seated right away. Food was good. Waiter was attentive. Had the Basic Omelette with bacon on the side. 5 star experience.
2016-03-27,3,This place has a great breakfast menu with a ton of drinks (ice teas, coffee, hot chocolates, etc). What's also nice is that they have a healthier menu. This time I had the fit and trim combo, and it was good. My friend got the huevos rancheros, and it looked good. This was different than more those because it was in a big wheat tortilla rather than smaller corn tortillas. I would give this place 4 stars however, the service is just meh. We went there around 2pm on Easter Sunday, and we got sat quickly as it wasn't super busy. When we first ordered, we told the servicer that we would place an order to-go. After we got out food, the server only stopped by again to drop off the check and for us to place our to-go order. Then we had to sit there and wait for the order to be ready. We looked for him to flag him down earlier, but he was no where to be found. Fortunately we weren't short on time.Maybe I'll just stick to take-out orders from here.
2016-03-27,5,Food was phenomenal! It is BYOB so we brought a bottle of champagne for mimosas. Wait time is the only downfall. You just have to go knowing you are going to wait anywhere from 30-60 minutes. Put your name down, grab a coffee somewhere and walk around by the water while you wait.
2016-03-25,2,Used to love this place and have been coming here for years--since they opened. Unfortunately, they have clearly declined in quality and service in the last year or so and I'm obligated to just call it at this point after several disappointing meals. We waited 30 min for a table for two. During that time, we watched multiple tables sit empty yet uncleared. The many employees seemed to be 100% focused on ensuring that delivery items were being rung up and rushed out the door to the Mauro's car, rather than tables being cleared or checks run. Finally we were seated and ordered. Literally we waited more than 35 min for our breakfast to be served. During that time I watched numerous delivery orders get whisked out the door. I think TP needs to get its priorities straight. Is it a restaurant or a takeout place? Certainly patrons should not be placed as second class citizens as the "restaurant" focuses on delivery.  Appalling.
2016-03-24,4,Had Lobster eggs Benedict. $15. one of the best bennys I've ever had. Amazing.Had to wait a very long time for the bill and coffee refill, but the speed of having our orders taken and meals to the table was fairly quick.
2016-03-15,2,I came to Turning Point for a Sunday brunch with 5 other girls. They don't take reservations, so three of us came 30 minutes early to secure a spot on the list. Boy was it packed- a 30 minute wait the hostess said. Perfect- we had anticipated this.25 minutes later, I go up to the hostess to get the waiting time again. She seemed out of her mind frantic, and told me an "additional 30 minutes". With a huge attitude. Girl, I know you're in hell right now but I am NOT the cause. Pinpoint that animosity towards you operations strategist so you two can figure out the reason for your Sunday morning bottleneck.10 minutes later, the three of us get seated. Our other friends are running behind as usual. Different waitresses come on 3 separate occasions to tell us that we cannot hold the table... Something they probably should have mentioned before we were seated? But we finally told them that we could order first for everyone (why were we the first ones to figure out this compromise?).It's worth noting that our actual water was a sweetheart. He brought us everything we needed with a smile. We had brought champagne which they opened for us, and provided us glass flutes.The food was okay at best. Maybe it's because I have my picks of brunch spots in the City, the food was absolutely not worth the 45 minute and the ATTITUDE.I will personally never ever ever come here again. There are TONS of BYOBs in Hoboken, and in the City. Ones with hostesses that won't make you want to strangle them! Ones with better food! Ones that are more organized, have better atmospheres, better views, better everything!!!!Only reason this place is even a 2 stars at all was because our waiter was nice enough to compensate for the rudeness of everone else.
2016-03-07,4,This is a great place to have a working breakfast. A few coworkers and I decided to get together over breakfast and we are glad we did. The food was good and the atmosphere is quaint but in a good way. The server was very nice and it was wonderful of her to notice that we were talking business and left us to chat without constant interruptions. I had the classic eggs Benedict and it was good. Nothing too special but it had great flavor and the eggs were cooked perfectly! I drink my coffee black and I wish the coffee were a little higher quality but it was still good :)
2016-03-06,5,Went there for brunch today. A very long wait (30-45m) but so worth it! Popeye Skillet was amazing!! My boyfriend and I had the best server ever, Shannon! He had great energy and patiently went through the menu and gave us his recommendations since it was our first time there. He was very attentive and made us feel special.We will return again and will be requesting Shannon!
2016-03-06,5,So many good options here. And server Shannon guided us through the menu with passion. Too many good things on the menu to only come once! Or twice. Or five times.They should genuinely fresh-squeeze their orange juice, though, instead of just using the store-bought "fresh-squeezed" OJ.Beware the wait: 35-40 minutes for a Sunday brunch.
2016-02-29,3,I love to give 4-5 star ratings, but my experience here wasn't too thrilling.My friend called ahead on Wednesday to make a reservation for a party of 5 for Saturday. The women told her to call ahead on Saturday instead and there would be no wait, instead of the usual 30-45. When we did that however, a different women said the call ahead puts you on a list, but the wait time starts when you get there. What's the point?! My friend said she was rather rude too. Hostess that day was also not happy or friendly.Still came because the menu looked great and honestly most brunch joints have a long wait anyway or are expensive when not BYOB. When we arrived it was very crowded, but we made do. We were asked if it was ok to be seated at a table for 4 and place an extra chair. It was fine, but very tight (especially with all our champagne haha). Weird that there were 2 people seated at booths for 6 though..We asked for waters, coffees and OJ (later to find the pitcher was charged per person for a total of $18!!) and only received 3 water glasses (2 more arrived about an hour later after asking again). Utensils were thrown on the table in a handful, falling and my friend having to catch some. My food was ok (Lobster Benedict), but the others in my party seemed to enjoy theirs. Kind of annoying advertising a Gluten Free menu, but it really means they don't serve any toast or English Muffin for the GF version of a Benedict. I didn't get the sauce either, but still. Very skimpy and unflavored. Home fries were maybe 15 pieces of undercooked chopped potato (when I asked for well done). Fruit was skimpy and mostly cantaloupe with one piece of pineapple. Tried my friend's pesto skillet, which was tasty.The restaurant slowed down once we were finishing, so we stayed much longer to finish all of our champagne. No, we didn't order more, but there was nobody else waiting for our table. We were treated very rudely for staying. We still tipped over 20% and the bill was very cheap. The view was nice too. For that we may return, but in no rush at all.. Hard to find that boozy brunch venue that's inexpensive, roomy and good food.
2016-02-25,5,I took Grande Huevos Rancheros for this visit in Turing point. Wow, the portion is Huge.I just finished half of them, such a waste. I should have ask them for a smaller size of it. It tastes very nice, but I would love to have extra sour cream!!!The winter brew French press coffee is brilliant.
2016-02-21,5,Great food, great prices, great location, and its BYOB too! Definitely recommend this place for brunch
2016-02-20,5,On weekends wait time is long but the service is exceptional. Staff is super friendly and the food is awesome!
2016-02-10,1,Traveled a long way to come here but was pretty disappointed. I got the corn bread French toast w/ apples, pecans, and vanilla bean mascarpone. The French toast itself was basically just corn bread but yummy. However, I couldn't taste it because the whole meal was drenched in the mascarpone that I did not like at all. My friend got the 'berry chocolatey' pancakes which he did not like at all but I thought were decent. We also had to wait a very long time for a table which isn't their fault but it the food was not worth that wait. Won't be coming back here. :/
2016-02-01,4,Despite being a quasi chain, probably the best place to get breakfast in Hoboken. It's consistently good. Like others mentioned, I highly recommend huevos rancheros with scrambled eggs. My wife had the Marsala eggs, interesting idea but not that great. Make sure you order the coffee presses.
2016-01-30,1,First of all, if I could rate this place a half star I would. My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday early afternoon for brunch. The only good thing about this place is that there was little wait time - there goes that half star. The rest of the experience was downhill from there. The moment we were seated I noticed that both of our utensils AND our drink glasses were dirty with dried food and lipstick marks. The waitress was kind enough to replace them which one of the forks was still dirty. Ok...so we got our food (Lobster Benedict and Big Easy Benedict) which were really just ok. Nothing to rave about. I got potato hash with my Lobster Benedict; when I was about half way done with my food and about to fork into the potatoes I noticed there was a hair sitting in it. I immediately lost my appetite and stopped eating. My boyfriend complained to our waitress and she took my food away. Usually when something like this happens the manager comes to your table, apologizes, and offers you something different on the menu. That never happened. What did happen is they did subtract the cost of my main dish off of the bill. That's not what I was looking for, however, this unfortunate experience ruined my brunch experience with Bae. Blah. Will never return.
2016-01-23,4,I'm between 3 and 4 stars. The food is worth the ridiculous wait. Brunch on a Saturday could take you about 1 hour to be seated (and when we were seated there were gnats on the wall near our table, which I wasn't happy about), but the food, the atmosphere (light and airy), and the service was something special. The prices are also surprisingly affordable for this area! They do have a nice little attached cafe to sit in while you wait, so our very long wait was enjoyable. It feels very beachy and open. I'll be returning next weekend for my birthday brunch. I wish you could make reservations.
2016-01-12,5,Amazing food. It's always packed on the weekends for brunch because it's just got such great food. My only complaint is that they didn't make this place twice as big so I could go on the weekend without waiting over an hour to get seated. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu!
2016-01-12,3,The brunch is pretty good here. I hate the long waiting time, since its so popular.If you come after 11:00 am, be prepared to wait atleast 2 hours before u are seated. You can also call ahead. Food: I have tried the lobster benedict ( my fav), huevos rancheros and lobster quesadilla. If you want something filling but not make u feel stuffed, try the lobster quesadilla. Service: Its a hit and miss. One time we were given dirty glasses, which the waitress gladly replaced. However, I wonder how the other utensils were if the glasses were not cleaned well.
2016-01-11,2,It pains me to write this review because, when I first started going to Turning Point, I generally enjoyed my experiences.  But lately, the food and service have been disappointing.  The atmosphere reminds me of a slightly upscale diner.  I usually end up sitting at the counter since the wait for an actual table is incredibly long on the weekends.  But the last few times, even the service at the counter has been lacking (for example, it took me nearly 15 minutes just to get a check).  On the plus side, the view of the city is fantastic, especially if you get to sit outside on a nice day.
2016-01-01,4,Best diner like breakfast you'll find in Hoboken. I would also just go for their coffee
2015-12-20,4,Four stars for the food , it's fabulous but nine out of ten times the service is bad !! We come a few times a month and only come for the food and view .even management doesn't seem to care , that's if you see one!
2015-12-13,3,It was our first visit and it looked like a really popular joint. Based on food quality and price alone, we certainly figured out why. The food was prepared quite quickly and tasted very good. We had a waffle with bananas and rum syrup, as well as a Big Easy Eggs Benedict, which was very delicious as well. However, this place is really let down by the poor service. The 3 things that stood out in this regard was that cutlery/napkins were not provided when we were seated, nor when the food arrived. We actually had to ask for cutlery and were then given plastic forks to eat because all the metal cutlery had run out. We also had to ask for glasses for water. When we asked for the check, we were also charged for an item that we did not order, and it took a while to resolve, so do go through your check carefully if you don't want to pay extra for something you did not have. With better service, this place would be great.
2015-12-11,4,Amazing view. Delicious food. Granted had breakfast on a Friday at 10a so it wasn't crowded and we could enjoy our experience.  Had the Huevos Rancheros. Strong yes.
2015-12-05,5,Hands down our favorite breakfast/brunch place. The food is always on point, the staff is so friendly, and the Northshore French Press is the best coffee ever.After you have the Huevos Rancheros & Northshore French press you'll never want to have breakfast/brunch anywhere else.
2015-12-03,4,Famously known and loved spot in town. Great food, cute interior- feels like a diner, but delivery takes insanely long on the weekend. Used to order consistently until it became unbearable. I love the food and location though!
2015-11-27,4,Did someone say brunch? :)My boyfriend took me here to grab brunch a few days before thanksgiving and meet his mom (which also went well, thank goodness). We waited about 5 minutes to be seated around 12 pm on a Wednesday; we were eventually seated in a room right off the main room with 3 or 4 tables.The staff seemed a little spacey here, but our waiter was kind enough. When I asked him which Benedict was the best, he told me he doesn't eat Benedict (who doesn't eat Benedict...?), but I forgave him. My favorite part of the menu was how vast it was. Even if you just want eggs Benedict, there were 4 or 5 different types, including a lobster Benedict or a Benedict served over corn bread. I ended up getting the Marsala Benedict without bacon and I wasn't disappointed. The meal was a little cold for my liking but I still enjoyed it. Also, the portions here are HUGE! The only one who was able to finish his meal was my boyfriend and he's a pig :P Each of the eggs Benedict came with potatoes which were cut into small squares and pretty good. Overall, I enjoyed my experience at this restaurant despite the sub par service. I would definitely come back here to try another dish.
2015-11-25,2,Service is not up to par, took 15 minutes to get greeted by a server only because we had to ask. They are lucky the food is good, but this is the 2nd time in a row service has been bad!
2015-11-15,1,Does yelp even allow a negative one star? Turning point is one of the busiest places in Hoboken which is great for them (if they can satisfy their clients) but terrible for someone who wants a quick bite to eat. I called in this morning to place an order for delivery, 2 bacon egg and cheese sandwiches- these take about 10 minutes to make. I estimated about 30-45 mins, which is normal. The first hour goes by and I'm told they are waiting for the delivery man. Fine. Fast-forward to  2 hours later and still no food. My co-worker called in to check the status and cancel the order, in which she was told that they had no recollection of my order. I then call them back (I rarely ever complain unless it's situations like this) and I was told that they were running behind and that they would cancel my order, flat out end of story. A bit ridiculous to wait 2 hours for a sandwich and still be charged for my full order. Needless to stay, Turning point will never get my business again.
2015-11-11,3,Turning Point, ironically at the northermost point of east hoboken, where you have to turn in order to continue north, is a great spot for brunch. What makes it great is a few things, but it's not without its detractions. #1) It's BYOB. As in BYO-Champagne for boozy brunch. Can I get a hell yeah?! #2) It has outdoor dining with an excellent view... sometimes. If there's a 5% forecast of rain for the day, but it's sunny and beautiful out, they'll refuse to seat you outside. #3) It has fun menu items. The specials can be hit or miss, but the regular menu is pretty solid.The service leaves a bit to be desired, although they're generally very nice, you can be left waiting from time to time. Grouping together what you need so you only need to ask once for anything during the entire meal seems to help that. I would avoid popping in for a quick breakfast sandwich on your way to work though, as not only does it take a bit of time, but you can get a breakfast sandwich for cheaper (and faster) on the other side of the Hudson.Will I be back? Yeah, where else am I gonna get brunch in the area?
2015-11-10,4,After reading all of the good reviews for the Huevos Rancheros I couldn't resist and I am so glad I ordered them, they were delicious.  The fresh avocado and cilantro on top added to the goodness.  My husband ordered the Big Easy Benedict, I was going to try it but there was nothing left when he was finished!  I highly recommend getting the french press coffee.  We ordered the Costa Rican blend which was amazing.  Coffee is served with a sugar crystal stick which is a fun touch to already delicious coffee.The only reason I'm not giving this restaurant a five star rating is that the service was slow. But, even with the slow service I would come back again.
2015-11-08,5,Turning Point of Hoboken is located away from the loud populated areas of Hoboken. Charles B. (the comment below mine) put it nicely "Friendly servers, clean dining areas, and quick service with a view." They also have a variety of choices from their menu. My boyfriend and I were so pleased, we came back around the same time the next day (Sunday). We came here on a Saturday around 2pm. It wasn't too busy, we were seated within two minutes. My boyfriend had the Tuscany omelette: red peppers in the omelette, sliced potatoes, a small fruit cup and turkey sausage. I'm so glad they offered turkey sausage! The dish had everything he wanted. I had the s'mores hot chocolate. It had whipped cream, some chocolate drizzled with graham cracker sprinkled on top; delicious! My meal was the OMG french toast; three french toast slices, caramel sauce with bacon bits, pecans and sprinkled with confectioner sugar. It was very good, but became too sweet after the second slice of french toast; I do wish that I asked to substitute the caramel sauce for maple syrup.We came back the day after, Sunday around the same time. We were seated within the same amount of time. It was a little louder than the other day and a little more busy. But we still received the same amount of friendly service and great food. My boyfriend got a latte and the same dish. I got the Tropical Crunch Waffle. Our waiter accidentally gave me french toast instead of a Belgian Waffle, but it was quickly replaced. The Tropical Crunch Waffle was served with sliced strawberries, bananas and mangos, with crunchy sweet granola and a side of strawberry syrup. I also asked for a side of maple syrup and pecans. The whole dish was delicious! The waffle was crunchy, the fruit was sweet, the granola and pecans were crunchy as well. Everything tasted fresh! Before tax and tip, the bill on both days came out to below $25! Turning Point of Hoboken is probably the best brunch place we've tried! Inexpensive and again friendly servers, clean dining areas, and quick service with a view. We're both extremely satisfied with this place and we'll definitely be back again!
2015-11-08,2,I've been here more than 5x. Every time have some problem. They don't follow the line, call table biggest first!
2015-11-05,5,This place it's amazing, the view to NYC incredible... The service on point!!! And the food it's fresh & deliciousness, and they serve a lot of food and the prices are reasonable... You have to visit this place, awesome 5 experience!!
2015-11-04,4,Off the beaten path, but worth going for sure. Friendly servers, clean dining areas, and quick service with a view. Any of the "Eggceptional Dishes" are worth ordering - all are delicious. The El Fresco Quinoa Bowl is very good, as well as the "Savory Sandwiches". Varied menu with lots to choose from.When my party came in, there was an extremely loud and obnoxious group of girls brunching for one of their birthdays (not the restaurant's fault, obviously), but the waitstaff apologized profusely and even comp'd us a portion of our bill.They also have a gluten-sensitive section to their menu, which is convenient for me because my girlfriend is gluten intolerant.
2015-11-02,5,My server was amazing she was adorable!!!my boyfriend and I decide this is our favorite brunch spot. Great view and the OMG french toast are called OMG for a reason
2015-11-01,4,This place is bit far away from the place I live but it's all worth it. The waiting time is approx 45 minutes and they don't take reservations, so call them ahead and put your name down. We ordered 2 Grande Huevos Rancheros (vegeterian version), coffee, fresh orange juice and a traditional hot chocolate. Everything was amazing and very filling. With food we also enjoyed the friendly service of Roary :)
2015-11-01,1,We came on Sunday morning, the place was full and we were told waiting time is 45 minutes. its a long time but the weather was nice so we waited with our 2 years old daughter out side. after 45 minutes we came in and we were told its going to take a few more minutes. to make a long story short, we waited an hour and 25 minutes, no one really cared we waited and eventually left the place hungry and angry.
2015-10-30,4,Good food, wide selection of breakfast, brunch, and lunch foods for all types of eaters, whether you want something sweet or savory or healthy or hearty, they have it.Good service, waitresses are attentive and nice and friendly, even when they are really busy, which they usually always are.Good ambiance, clean place, nice water view, fun to walk there along the water or go to Pier 13 afterward for some boozing.Overall a solid place.  The only downside is they are packed usually, and don't do a good job at getting people in, fed, and out, as a lot of tables sit there dirty and not turned over to the next guess.  So maybe a little more busboy and hostess manpower would go a long way there.  Kind of pricey for a diner, but the quality is much better than a standard Jersey diner, so it is a par deal/value.  They do need the standard Eggs, Hasbrowns, Toast, Sausage or Bacon ultimate diner breakfast choice though - they get a bit fancy, which is fine, but you have to excel at the basics right.
2015-10-13,2,I have to agree with a previous reviewer: " I'm not sure why this place always has a wait because it has average service and sub-par food at best. ".... My thoughts exactly.. On top of the fact that EVERYTHING is sticky and filthy in that place... Ustencils, tables, glasses, ketchup bottles, salt shaker, seats... EVERY single thing has some sort of goowy film... Have they washed anything in the past year ??... Food is "Meh"... And service, well, they don't even qualify for the definition of the word... And have tried and tried and tried that place; 5-6 times even.. Same result... But the last time was too much... I even had to tell the server to watch his tone and to not talk to me like that. Yes, it's that bad ! 1 star for the view, 1 star because I'm nice, unlike them.
2015-10-12,1,The service here is incredibly bad. So, so slow. Waiting 30+ minutes for a server to return to a table is just absurd. The cafe side is even worse. How it takes 15 minutes to make a breakfast sandwich is beyond me.
2015-10-04,2,Food is great! The only thing I'm really upset about is that they lie to your face about their orange juice. And it's even in the menu as freshly squeezed and you can tell that is not. Not cool..
2015-09-27,2,We order from here multiples times a month and have always had issues but since the food is good we continue to order. Last visit was the last straw. We called in an order, 20 minutes later we went to go pick it up, no order was there. They told us the girl who took our order threw it away and was unsure of what we ordered. WHAT?!? We replaced our order, no apologies no nothing. Hospitality in the industry has missed them.
2015-09-23,5,Lovely! Absolutely lovely. Went for late breakfast on a Saturday. Outdoor seating with a view!-had a skillet egg dish (Italiano) and it was delicious. Super filling though it looked small-got a French press of coffee. Came to the table with a timer. The anticipation was tough but worth the wait. Gives you about 4 cups of coffee + When the waitress came through and checked on us,  I asked her to take our picture bc it was my friend's birthday. She did so without hesitation. So nice. Then 5 minutes later she came out with a dessert that we didn't order as a birthday gift. Super sweet! I didn't mean to imply anything - it was the nicest most genuine gesture. Thank you so much! Just a nice place to eat that's away from the hustle of the Main Street. Enjoy!
2015-09-21,4,Super diverse menu, great views of the water, health hand unhealthy options.  The service was pretty slow, I think our waiter may have forgotten to put in our order, but he came over about ten times to check on us and ask if theres anything we needed.  my friend and i ate healthy options- salad and sandwich combo, and they were both good- really fresh and tasty.  Would definitely go back! This is also based on a weekday afternoon visit, we were seated easily and without issue, but i can picture this place being packed on the weekends
2015-09-21,1,This place got off to a great start when it first opened. The service has been on the decline ever since and has officially bottomed out. Our last two visits were among the worst experiences we've ever had at a restaurant. Granted the food is pretty good here but if the employees could ignore you less, they WOULD!One incident, among many, on our second to last visit was the lack of silverware on our table once our food arrived. We asked the two food runners who delivered our food for silverware. They both said "sure!" and neither one returned. Not being able to flag anyone else down, I went and asked the guy at the service counter. I could see a whole bin of silverware under the counter. When I asked him for some, he told me I needed to ask my server. Are you kidding me??? I was able to grab another server and asked her. She quickly brought us some. The two food runners we asked never did return. We were also treated rudely by the hostess since we didn't respond immediately to the text that our table was ready. Problem was, she told us there was a 20 minute wait. She texted us 2 MINUTES later and we didn't notice the text had come in. So yeah... TOTALLY OUR FAULT and she was completely justified for being rude to us.Yesterday we returned again against our better judgement. We were seated in the outdoor section where 3 servers were working. 10 minutes after being seated we still hadn't been greeted or told someone would be with us soon. One server walked by our table 5 times. Two of her trips past us were to wander off and then back on to the property. When I told the hostess no one had helped us, she proceeded to take our order, bring us our coffee and food and checked back several times. She was helping take up the slack at several other tables as well as the servers just couldn't be bothered. At one point our server, who had completely ignored us for 20 minutes at that point, decided she was going to start waiting on us. Too little too late. We handed our tip to the hostess, who just happened to be working her last day. Makes totally sense since this place is incapable of keeping good employees on staff.If we ever want food from this place again, we'll take it to go. We'll more likely go to one of the nearby places who have good food AND good service!!!
2015-09-19,4,One of my favorite places for brunch on Hoboken m. The menu is huge but the food is always fresh and delicious. There is normally a wait so prepare to take in the beautiful view from the city while you wait!
2015-09-13,3,The experience of a dining joint is comprised of all the aspects. It's a process: meet and greet, give attention, offer a seat or state a reasonable wait time, find a table, clean a table, THEN bring food. And yes, the food was good, and served quickly - so the cook and the server did well. However, getting to the point of ordering the food was not pleasant. I hope they train their staff to be good hostesses and greeters, otherwise visitors may not get as far as appreciating the food.Zero points for greeting, five points for food, and separately - five point for the view.
2015-09-13,1,Usually this place is great but don't ever sit outside. We sat outside today and the staff was very very slow and not attentive. We sat for 40 minutes before anyone even had coffee and the restaurant was not full at all. Not even water. The didn't bring the one thing we ordered for our 4 year old until after we all already had our food and we had to ask 3 times for it. The poached eggs were soaked in water. The oatmeal was cold and for some reason they didn't tell us we couldn't have fruit in it until they already served it. Terrible experience from a place my family has lived for years.
2015-09-12,2,For the second time, my order has been completely messed up. Come on guys, please clean up your customer service.
