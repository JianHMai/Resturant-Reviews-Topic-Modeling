2021-10-22,3,Decent dining experience. We were there on a Sunday evening and were one of only a handful of tables. Hadn't been there for many years so it was nice to check it out again. There are certainly better steakhouses in the area, but this place was good enough for a quiet Sunday dinner.
2021-06-19,2,BEWARE 24oz Steaks are $46 now. Not returning to pre-covid prices ($34).The first time I went to Arthurs Steakhouse in Hoboken in 1993.  The 24oz Steaks were $9.99.  Served in a large oval plate with lots of potatoes, Red Cherry Hot Peppers and additionally lots of complimentary sauerkraut, Pickles and extra Red Cheery Hot Peppers.  The food was literally off the edge of the plate.  I wish I could find pictures I took to share with all of you. The steak did not even look like a 24oz steak but larger and thicker.  It was a great time and restaurant, with a great owner who knew his customers.  I hoped that they would have opened up a restaurant in Central Avenue, Yonkers.As time went by, the price slowly increased. Not compromising quality, serving size or our pockets. It was worth the price. Every year I'd swear I'd visit this restaurant up to 100 times with family and friends. They made tons of money.By 2012, the price went to $20, they took away the sauerkraut.  The interior of the restaurant changed. The steak and potatoes were being served on a round plate.  Seemed like there were new employees.  Found out later that there were new owners.  Every year although menu said 24oz steak, it looked smaller, and smaller and complimentary items were less and counted per person.Although a search on the internet today shows Arthurs Hoboken Steakhouse 24oz steaks are $31, before the pandemic in 2020 it was $34 dollars on their menu,  I visited the restaurant in October 2020 for my mothers birthday. The internet still posted steaks at $31 including a visit to their website.  I knew it was $34, so I went to the restaurant since some restaurants were allowed open with limitations.   I got there, we sat and placed our usual order with the waitress.  Did not need to look at the menu.  A few minutes looking around I glanced at a empty table.  I picked up a flyer specifically made about the 24oz "Our Steak".  It was $44.  I could do nothing about it, we were already there.  The serving was disappointing and items counted.  Their flyer promised the pricing was temporary and would return to normal pricing.  As of June 19, 2021, I made a phone call before taking a trip.  The price of a 24oz steak is $46.  Their website does not list prices on their website anymore.  They want you to come in and be surprised. For those who traveled far to go to this restaurant for years, this is whats waiting for you now.  They went up on their price and they aren't going to roll back.  Use to go to this restaurant for years and it looks it wont be my favorite spot anymore.  I may only go once or not at all.If you still miss the interior look that Arthurs Hoboken had once, you can go to Arthurs Steakhouse in Morris Plains, NJ. They never raised their price during the pandemic.  You can get a 24oz Steak for $34 - $37. I'd go there.   arthurstavern.comI suggest going to Longhorn Steakhouse.  Try their 22oz Ribeye Steak.  They serve complementary hot oven baked bread, Choice of side and salad.  I like choosing a loaded baked potato and a garden salad which is generously served. All for $28.If going out for a steak gets ridiculously pricey.  Get ribeye steaks from COSTCO.  You can get 4 large steaks between $48 to $60 and grill or broil them at home.  Some owners think raising the price make them more money.  It actually makes you less. Customers won't come in like they use to. Maybe owners will learn or go out of business.Note: When I find the pictures I will post them.  You will see a before and after!
2021-05-27,5,My boyfriend and I wanted their filet. They are only open from Thursday through Sunday now. The BEST service there is always Alexa!! She is always attentive! Top notch.They don't have the filet anymore for the time being. Sad! The menu is much smaller. We ordered a Caesar salad (no croutons), the salmon with side of mushrooms, and their burger.THIS IS THE BEST BURGER IN HOBOKEN!!!! :)Highly recommend the burger!!! Juicy, filling, always cooked right, melty cheese and bacon and mushrooms. Perfect bun. Delicious!!! Sooo worth it!!!The salmon was cooked perfectly. But it's a small salmon for $25. I wouldn't order it again. It's on dry side too. Skip.The mushrooms were cooked perfectly and delicious! Great flavor. They're a perfect side to the burger.They also don't have beer on draft anymore.**Just cans and bottles.
2021-03-13,3,I haven't been at this location for years. Limited menu after covid. It's St. Patrick's wknd and it's freezing cold!! Walking in I had asked the greeter if we can please be sat toward the back room. It was too cold in front by the door. She declined my requests I asked her why? Her answer was how he needed to fill the front first!! What kind of accommodation tho individual is providing to their customers. Not sure if he was discriminating because then the next party of two as I walked in 10 minutes after and also requested the back and she did honored his request!! I got upset that my waiter who was kind enough to ask me if I wanted to move how she will be happy to accommodate me. I then said no. The reason why is because she was kind and I didn't want her to loose out on her tip plus I already ordered. Greeter needs training
2021-03-07,2,This place has gone somewhat downhill unfortunately. I had the "Our Steak" and it was very underwhelming for the price. The steak came out overcooked for my taste, but it was still pretty juicy inside. The thing is though, it really lacked flavor. It was strange. The meat was juicy and tender and the char on the steak was nice, but the meat itself tasted bland, like it lacked beef flavor LOL
2021-02-27,3,been coming here for years,but this time around it was clearly different. I considered this as one of the best steaks and restaurants in the region but clearly Covid has dampened or affected it in some ways. First of, the menu is now limited to a few choices, specially the meat choices are only a couple. the quality therefore suffers just like the standards that suffers a bit. i still hope it gets back to its former taste and standards that really lures people to come back for more, i'll be waiting and hoping soon.
2021-02-13,2,Steak was average. Potatoes were good. Wine was ok. This place definitely didn't live up to any expectations. I won't be coming back. Really overpriced. I hear the original is far better.
2021-02-09,4,Stopped by this place during my visit across the river. My friend was super hungry and steak was essentially the answer to fill up that stomach nicely.We split two things: Arthur's Famous Garlic Bread and "Our Steak". Their "Our Steak" is a 24oz well-marbled classic ribeye served with Arthur's Famous Griddle Potatoes. The potatoes were really good, better than what you get for breakfast home fries. The steak itself was very impressive. What stood out to both of us was the Arthur's Famous Garlic Bread. I probably could have had two of these and called it my dinner.Service was fantastic. They strongly encouraged cash tips due to the hardships with the pandemic, but it's not a cash only establishment. They do an awesome job with spacing tables 6 feet apart. It may be well beyond 6 feet from a quick glimpse. Overall, very impressed and would come back.
2021-02-01,4,Had not realized that they reopened.  We went over weekend and split their classic steak.  Even my wife who is not much of a steak fan had great things to say.  The only thing holding me back from 5 stars is the temperature inside the restaurant- it was pretty cold.  Can't wait to return.
2020-12-06,5,Great pub, great steak and service!!  Would eat there again and again!!  Everything was scrumptious and delicious!
2020-12-05,3,Menu is very pared down due to covid and the drinks are okay. The food is fine and the service is polite.
2020-12-01,1,This is the worst restaurant in the area.  Flies are everywhere and it looks like nothing has been cleaned in 20 years.  Food is over priced crap.  I would rather eat a frozen dinner then eat here again.  The management is clueless, rude, and clearly don't care.
2020-10-29,1,Horrible service, mediocre steak, overpriced. Steak with potatoes for $44. Way overpriced.  Rude service. The waitstaff needs training on being friendly and polite. Extremely rude responses, never checked on us to see if we needed anything else. Website shows the full menu and specials which they no longer honor,but conveniently forgot to edit on the website. Definitely not going back and will let others know.
2020-10-09,5,I have been going to Arthur's Steaks for exactly 20 years! When I was first introduced to their famous "Our Steak" ribeye, I was clueless to how incredibly lucky I was to the incredible deal I was getting at the time!!! Since then, I have been to Peter Luger's, Smith & Wollensky, Ruth's & countless other steakhouses that are way more expensive! Arthur's ribeye is so delicious, these other steakhouses could not compare! In addition, at a fraction of the price that you would pay elsewhere for the quality & delicious taste of their steak, it's literally a steal!!! I hope Arthur's does not read this review & raise their prices!!!
2020-08-22,4,TLDR: No frills pub that happens to serve good affordable steaks. Grab yourself a beer and order "Our Steak". Pick your temperature and chow down.Arthur's is not a fine dining establishment. To be honest, it looks like a place I'd eat if I was a fugitive and trying to lay low. That being said, I dig it. The red/white checkered tablecloths, the lingering scent of beer that you'd find in a taproom, it all adds to the experience.I love the garlic bread here. Ask for a side of marinara which they'll happily give. It's garlicky, cheesy, buttery and with that gravy.. yum. The French Onion soup is not bad either.For the "Our Steak", it's a 24 oz. ribeye served with basally home fries. It's always got a nice crust and those potatoes are full of flavor. Fatty, delicious, tender and honestly you can share this with someone else.I enjoy a high-end chophouse but sometimes, you just want a solid steak without having to politely decline shellfish towers. What I love about this place is everyone can afford to eat here. You can have a great steak and not wait until it's someone's birthday.So the next time you're craving a ribeye, checkout Arthur's.
2020-03-10,1,This was once a decent steakhouse about 25 years ago. I'm not going to go granular on this experience. What I will say is I'll never go back. It was horrible on all levels.
2020-02-09,4,Always have a great time here. Early Sunday lunch so no one was here, so we had the whole back area to ourself, so our loud mouths did not  disturb anyone, lolSteak excellent, medium rare. Bowl of French Onion soup and a loaf  garlic bread
2020-02-06,5,Always tasty! Never a bad meal or app. Service isn't terrible either. Can always count on a satisfying meal at Arthur's!
2020-02-05,2,I came here in the '80's and '90's when this was THE place to go in Hoboken for Steaks. I've been here a few times since, the last time extremely disappointing. One note before I continue: DO NOT ORDER BEER ON DRAFT !!! It is extremely watered down and tastes like seltzer with an unfortunate taste. Last time was on a Friday; this time on a Wednesday expecting better, considering I remember when Arthur's was full, everything was rushed. A note about Arthur's steaks. They used to say on their menu that their meat was 'choice'. Sounds good ?  It is. Top is 'Prime'. 'Choice' is one step below. A waitress once explained to me that they could charge less for more with 'Choice' and no one would notice.  So the steak this time was almost a perfect Medium. There were half or less of the amount of potatoes and no free pickles. The server checked in periodically which was good. But the place feels moribund. I can't better describe it, and it's probably due to how much I loved Arthur's in its heyday.  So even though the service was OK, steak good, I had to return my draft beer as undrinkable. So 2 Stars.
2020-01-16,5,I visit Arthurs every time I'm in New Jersey. We never have a bad stake. The French onion soup is great and I can't tell you about the garlic bread. Any day of the week is good for dinner.
2020-01-10,3,I've been here twice and had the same bad waitress both times. She drops the menu, comes back to take food and drink order at the same time and then never checks in again. I don't know if she's just bad or has never been trained but it's a shame. The burgers and steaks are good here and reasonably priced for Hoboken but the service makes me not want to come back.
2019-11-20,2,Chewy, tough filet Mignon sandwich made with stale garlic bread. Not good at all. I would not go back. Waitresses were good. If it wasn't for them I'd give 1 star.
2019-10-27,1,Steak was raw, service was like waiting at the DMV, the food I had was decent but everyone else was unhappy with theirs. We felt sick after.
2019-10-17,2,This place has been a staple forevermore. I have not been there for quite sometime.  Went there for lunch today with a few guys.  Food was good to very good   Service was slow even though it was not busy.  But during lunch a mouse kept darting in and around the tables in the back.  We told the waitress and she said if she sees it she will get sick.  So glad my wife was not there or the tv crews would have been summoned.  So food was good. Mouse was not great to see.  Your call.
2019-10-11,5,This place is the bomb.com and on thurs the special is well worth it steak was just the way I order it medium rare nice n juicy and the garlic bread is enough to make u take another one home
2019-10-06,2,I remember I went to this restaurant a few years back with my dad, it was pretty good. I was there las weekend and it was a waist of money and time.We ordered an onion soup that we didn't touch, same as the potatoes in my stake, they both look awful. I was very dissapointed :(The waiter was nice, that's why I gave them 2 starts.
2019-09-11,2,Living in Manhattan, one gets excited for reasonably priced steak such as what Arthur's offers up. So when I made an outing to Hoboken and stopped by this restaurant, I was quite excited.  Unfortunately, that excitement was short lived. I had the NY strip and it was bland and dry.  To be honest, my dining partner had the filet and that was much more tender and flavorful. For my NY strip, I had to smother it with A1 to even eat it (can't remember the last time I even used A1 on a steak). Fancy dry aging or superior cuts of meat aren't what I'm expecting for $30 but I was hoping that it'd be seasoned with some salt and pepper and when you order medium rare and cut into the meat, that it be somewhat juicy and not a dry piece of jerky.
2019-09-10,5,I love this place . They have the best French onion soup in all of New Jersey . I have been dining with them since I was in highschool and the service, food quality and atmosphere is always on point. Food is delicious  a definite must in Hoboken. Highly recommend this spot if looking for a moderately priced place with great steaks and service  .
2019-08-12,3,The ambiance there is very nice with an edgy vibe if you get a seat in the back area and its a dimlit kinda area. The signature steak of there's definitely didn't blow me out of the water and for a $32 cut of steak I would have expected a little bit better. It came with their potato's which were so seasoned.. more seasoned then the meat itself. The presentation was very rustic but I cannot complain on it since its hard to make a full cut ribeye look pretty. Overall, I think if I go next time I'd get apps and a burger. The staff there was kind but not as attentive as I wish they would be. I was waiting for the waiter so that I could order water as the shirley I had got was definitely too sweet.
2019-08-06,4,This place was great! I was visiting family from California and they took me here. The proportions were generous. I ordered a rare steak and would order it again, but not too soon. Got to what that cholesterol level! The service was great, the environment looked like it could use an upgrade. Satisfied with food and service. Would recommend.
2019-07-03,1,Up from retiring in Florida and our children enjoying a sleep over tonight with their cousins and 2nd cousins.  My Wife & I came out to Hoboken planning on a night of strolling around town after a nice dinner at Arthur's Steakhouse.  When we got here we could not believe what the place has turned into.  What a filthy, depressed, and poorly maintained dump.  The outside of the building was in shambles and the inside was just as bad.  We walked through the restaurant and I peaked in the kitchen and I couldn't believe how disgusting it was!  It's not even a shadow of its former self that I remember from 15 years ago... As we left I told the host that I haven't been here in 15 years and asked if they are still owned by the same people and he told me "no, the new owners bought Arthur's 8 years ago..."That explains ALOT!We walked out and went down to River Street.We had the absolute BEST meal at Halifax overlooking the Hudson River.  I had the Ricotta Cavatelli for dinner and Vanilla Panna Cotta for desert.  My Wife had the Roman Style Gnocchi and the New York Style Cheesecake!Absolutely the best meal we have ever had.  Totally recommend those four dishes and that place.My heart is broken over what Arthur's Steakhouse has become.  I have many great memories eating there.  I hope the new owner reads this review and does something about it.  It would be a real shame for such a wonderful landmark and all its history to end so sadly.
2019-07-01,4,Took my parents to Arthur's last Saturday and got two ribeye and two fillets wrapped in bacon. All were amazing cuts of meats and cooked perfectly. I used to come to Arthur's much more but the prices have shot up considerably. Ribeye is now 37 vs 27 about 5 years ago. The place was a staple for pound per pound stake for the price. I think the large increases in price is a mistake and visible by the lack of people in the place. I strongly suggest lowering the price and filling the place back up before it's too late.
2019-06-11,5,I always hate leaving a restaurant hungry and unsatisfied after spending $30+ per person.  Arthur's is one of those places where you go to be stuffed and satisfy your meat craving.  I always get the number 1, 24oz steak ordered medium rare.  It's a huge piece of meat on a plate cooked the way a steak should be: caramelized exterior, juicy interior.  Ambiance is non pretentious but elegant enough for a date.
2019-05-18,2,I've been going to Arthur's on and off for 23 years and this by far is my worst experience! My wife got the crab cakes with corn salsa and asparagus what a joke! They gave her two small crab cakes 2 stalks of asparagus and the corn salsa was sprinkled as decoration and they wanted to charge me $25 for that. Shotty service, my steak wasn't even cook right an they try to charge us more money for a salad! Won't be going back
2019-04-28,4,Haven't been here in years but went last night to get a lighter dinner with my husband.  I got the French onion soup  which is  and I got the Caesar salad  with shrimp.   I was super impressed.  A good spot for a casual dinner!
2019-04-23,1,Arthur's was a favorite of my husband and I's during our dating years in the mid 90's. Though we frequent Hoboken, we hadn't eaten there in years. We made plans to go and figured we'd introduce our boys to a bit of our history. After this weekend's (Easter Sunday 4/21/19) visit, we should have stayed away a bit longer. We both ordered the 24oz ribeye (medium) and one of my sons ordered the chili. While the taste of the steak was just as we remembered, you can see from the picture the steak was cooked well less than medium. I had to slice it and bring it to temperature when we got home. Additionally, my son's chili had a bay leaf in it; if you've used bay leaf you know it is unpalatable and also poses a choking hazard. To say we were disappointed by the outcome of this visit would be an understatement.
2019-04-21,1,What were my husband and I thinking?!? I don't know but it was our fault for choosing to come here. So we were walking round Hoboken finding the strip of restaurants packed for Easter dinner. We saw Arthur's and said "hey, why not.. we haven't been here in a while". Right off the bat, we should've left, the place was EMPTY!!! But we've eaten here before (2 years ago) and it wasn't bad. Anyway, my husband ordered a medium rare ribeye, and I a rack of bbq ribs and two beers. The minute our food arrived I noticed my ribs looking a little off. I had to slice the ribs with a knife, took a bite and WTF!1. It was cold, like just came out of the fridge cold2. Stale , stale , friggen stale3. I would rather eat rubber bands4. Where the f*** was the bbq sauce?5. I'm serious when I say these ribs tasted like they've been sitting out in the open for AT LEAST a week. I took ONE bite and had to tell the server my food was not edible. They should at least microwave the damn thing.My husband "finished" his steak, 1/4th of the steak was uneaten rubbery/tendons. Damn, so upsetting. Came here starving, and left still starving with a disgust look on my face AND $115 poorer. My stomach turns just thinking about that bite I took. Never coming back, will you? 1 star for the service?
2019-04-13,1,well what do you know... Post something on social media and suddenly you get a phone call back right away! The restaurant claims to have submitted a refund on last Tuesday.. I have a feeling they only did that after the review went up and that's why I haven't seen anything yet. I'll update again if/when the money comes through.UPDATE: refund was finally issued for my meal.
2019-03-27,5,I ate at Arthur steakhouse this week and overall had a very good experience with my meal. Now on both Mondays and Tuesdays the burgers are on special for nine dollars and they also include two toppings. I ordered the burger with fresh avocado and bacon on mine. They were also accommodating and able to provide extra lettuce instead of a bun. They do have plenty of other options on the menu and some drink specials to choose from as well. There is plenty of seating including an entire extra room in the back if you are with a larger group, so there should not be too much trouble accommodating, and it was not particularly crowded either. Easily walking distance from the public transportation in town and a great spot for a meal! Overall I definitely would recommend checking it out.
2019-02-24,4,I recently enjoyed a boys only dinner and it was very, very good. I decided on a burger instead of their steak. It was a really good choice and I will return for a steak. We all had a fun start to our Saturday night
2019-02-23,1,Very disappointed!! Ordered the calamari appetizer and the Junior Steak (medium) with Arthur potatoes. Was told the Arthur potatoes were like home fries or steak potatoes...they were actually scalloped potatoes. The steak was closer to well done and lukewarm to cold.  The potatoes were scorched on the bottom and crunchy - also cold.  The calamari came with the meal instead of as an appetizer - also cold. Two people had the ribs and crab cake. The flavor of the crab cake was ok and the ribs they said were good - just cold.  The service was slow and we had to literally catch the waitress while serving another table as she never came back to check on us.  Needless to say the dining experience was not the best. Don't think I will be back.
2019-02-17,3,The steak was juicy and delicious, but it had more than expected fatty spots. Maybe it was the piece I had, the only way to find out is to come back again !!!
2019-01-27,4,The Garlic Bread is by far the best I've ever had. 5 stars for the bread!! Only reason I gave 4 stars was because the entrees were food but underwhelming. Had a burger and fries and it was decent. Was hoping it would be just as good as the bread but the garlic bread would def keep me coming back!
2019-01-23,4,This rating is closer to a 3.5-3.75.  My boss decided to treat us to some steaks in Hoboken and when we arrived we were directed to have a seat in their main dining room. We took our seats and waited for about ten minutes when our server arrived. She promptly told us that their credit card processing machines were down and they were only able to take cash. Plus, something was going on in the kitchen. Not sure if it was a call out or whatever but things were running slow. We were in no rush, but I wasn't planning on being in NJ all day either. We all decided to order an "Our Steak" which is 24 oz Rib Eye served with Arthur's potatoes. I also ordered some Arthurs Famous Garlic Bread. The garlic bread had to be some of the best I've ever had. It's hard to describe, but its delicious and if you visit this is must have. The steak was good...very marbled. Too much for my liking though. The potatoes were very well seasoned. I really enjoyed it, but I had to make a decision to hold off on them since I was still knocking down the garlic bread. I'm a little conflicted about this one. Would I go back to Hoboken for steak? Probably not, but if I'm in the area I may for sure order that garlic bread and maybe even some of them potatoes.
2019-01-13,2,Arthur's used to be a great place to come for a steak and potatoes dinner, these days it is a shadow of its former self. The menu is bigger and they have French Fries but the steaks themselves aren't always that great and prices, which used to be extremely reasonable, have shot up. The restaurant itself, which in the past was always packed and lively is rarely busy and looks tired and shabby, it's like all the love has gone out of it. I'm kind of surprised it is still open, to be honest...
2019-01-07,2,I am so disappointed. I once rated this place, pound for pound best steak in the tri-state area. Great steak and best price. Went last night for the first time in around a year. I make a special trip. I knew something was different, i had to ask to put the hot cherry pepper on the steak! And when it arrived, the pepper was ice cold..Steak was fatty and course..Could not eat the whole steak..Found out that this location has been under new management for 2 years. You can tell! If your going to take over an icon, please don't change the ingredients or the methodology of its preparation. People notice. I understand the location in Morris Plains is still under the original owners..I guess i will have to travel a little longer to enjoy a great steak..This is truly a shame..This is equal to the pastrami icon Carnegie Deli closing in Midtown...
2018-12-28,3,So, I come here probably every 4 months or so. Yesterday I came by, and even invited a friend for her first time, the food was great, as always. But what did it for us was when we were talking and my friend starts screaming that there is a rat! I didn't believe it at first, but when I turned I saw a mouse running back and forth between tables. We told a waiter and he just laughed it off and walked away. I don't think I'll be coming back, if they were that unphased by a rodent running around, I'm scared to know what their kitchen looks like now...
2018-12-24,3,Recommend by my boss, we came here for our Christmas party. We had a party of 15 and we made a reservation for 6 on a Friday night. There were not a lot of people when we came but the service was really slow. We sat at our table for a good 20 mins before they took our drink orders. My boss recommended the pina colada and it was a good choice. It was very good but thy only gave us 1 round of order for it and told us they not making it anymore because the bartenders are too busy which kinda sucked. My boss wanted to try the 48oz steak but it was not longer offered by the restaurant. The garlic bread is a must try. Yes it's just bread but it was so good. Not sure if it was because I was hungry but the bread was hot and buttery. The fried calamari was also good. Would not recommend the nachos. I ordered the 24oz house steak medium rare. Cook was good but the steak was very salty. The potato was also kinda hard. It would have been better if it was cooked longer and more soft. I filled up on appetizers so I wasn't able to finish the steak. However the steak size is a good portion and it had a good fat to meat ration on this cut.
2018-12-21,4,This was another great steak house... I'm happy to see that it's here more than two decades later.  It deserves to be.
2018-11-25,1,Beware! The food here is absolutely disgusting! I just ordered ribs to take out and we literally had to throw it out and order Chinese. The food eas BURNT and dry. No place that respects itself should put out such a bad product and at such a high price. I paid 60 dollars for 2 orders of ribs and a cesar salad.
2018-11-17,1,Ordered 4 cheesesteaks for pickup. All of them ended up in the trash after a few bites from everyone. Literally a mis-STEAK.
2018-11-10,1,Ordered a steak, medium. Got a steak with very little to no red. Medium well would be a stretch - it was borderline well done. Talked to the waiter. He insisted that it was medium. Had me make a cut down the middle. Nope, no red. He insisted that it was due to the poor lighting in the establishment. Insert eye roll here.Arthur's used to be a favorite of mine back in the day. I don't know what the heck happened but I can honestly say I will never step back in here again based on the quality of the food. There's literally five things on the menu - how the hell do you mess it up? And why is the waiter trying to convince me otherwise when it's pretty evident to anyone that the meat was overcooked? The overall experience ruined my birthday dinner. 1 star. Avoid.
2018-10-14,4,Everyone loves the burgers here. I don't eat beef but whoever I am with always mentions the burgers! The place could use a little sprucing up. Some repairs and updates would be beneficial but the servers are pleasant and the vibe is good. Their pitchers of Sangria are so good and reasonably priced.
2018-10-12,5,Went with my wife and son.  The service was excellent.  I had the filet. Asked for medium rare, came out perfect.  The mushrooms on top of the steak was delicious. As was the asparagus. My son had the hamburger.  Said it was very good.  Love this kind of restaurant. Will definitely go back.
2018-09-29,1,Wost service and foodI think they were taken over by aliens I have never ever went there before and had service and food that tasted so disgusting we have been going there for the past four years every other weekend with our kids because they liked it I literally think there was people just working there who didn't know what they were doing I have never experienced the most disgusting awful food service and filth and gross representation of a restaurantNot even worthy of one starI wish there was negative stars because I would give them -100
2018-09-05,5,It was so nice to finally come by for dinner one day with my boyfriend because we always pass it on our walks and never actually make it in. The evening we came by, a gentleman was standing outside by the door and opened it for us while greeting us. Talk about great service from the beginning!We quickly sat down and looked at the drink menu. Our server was very helpful in suggesting some drinks and entrees for us. We ended up ordering the mango margarita on the rocks and a whiskey mixed drink. As an appetizer, we ordered the famous garlic bread, which absolutely did not disappoint! The intense garlic buttery flavor was perfect and the huge loaf was so soft and warm.. I'll be dreaming about it for awhile. For our meals, we got the specials of the day: steak and crab cake, and the steak and lobster tail. Both were prepared as requested and the seafood was so fresh. I am very picky when it comes to mango flavored drinks, so I was so pleased to find that it seemed like they used mango nectar to flavor the mango margarita instead of an artificial mango syrup.From the service to the excellent food and drinks, it's safe to say that we will be returning to Arthur's in the near future, especially for their weekday specials!
2018-09-04,3,5/5 for the food- We had a bacon appetizer that was excellent. Our steaks were cooked to a perfect medium rare with a beautiful crust. Potatoes and onion sides were great too. This is, of course, the most important part of the review and there was literally not a thing wrong with the food we had.2/5 for drinks- There's a whole list of "specialty house" cocktails which are pretty uncreative but the bar selection isn't too deep. Only a few wines and a few beers. I ordered a pretty basic cocktail that they weren't able to make. I then opted for a house red wine instead and it tasted like it had been open for a while. I wasn't looking for anything special but it was pretty disappointing.2/5 for service- There were only about 3 tables full at 7:15 on a Tuesday. Our server asked us for our order within a minute of us sitting down. We asked for more time and she was back within another 2 minutes. We asked for a little more time. She then passive aggressively stood about 10 feet away (we were her only table) but refused to make eye contact with us or come over again for about 15-20 minutes until we affirmatively asked. Our appetizer came out at the same time as our mains, which was a shame. Our server continued to be grumpy with us for the remainder of the meal to the point that my dining partner didn't feel comfortable ordering a drink or asking for water. I imagine she probably just had a bad day but it left us feeling pretty uncomfortable. Overall, the space isn't particularly inviting and the drinks and service left something to be desired. But the food was very good. In sum: meh.
2018-08-10,5,I've been coming here since I was a kid, probably had my first meal here in 1989 or so. It's an old Hoboken stand-by. It's been through a few owners since then. Food quality has fluctuated. They used to bring you pickles and coleslaw when you sat down, no longer. You have to ask for the pickles (I imagine just bringing them got pretty wasteful). I used to love the signature steak, but I had it there maybe in 2004 and it was awful. Just awful. For 14 years I just ordered burgers or sandwiches. I recently gave it another try a few weeks ago. It was honestly one of the best steaks I've ever had. It was better than Keen's in Manhattan. It was perfectly seared, salted, and cooked. No toughness, no stringiness, it just melted in my mouth. A little fatty and gristly, but that's just the cut, not the preparation. For the cut, it was a delicious steak and I'm back to ordering steaks at Arthur's. It's not a high-end steak house. It's an old-timey, maybe even a little divey tavern that happened to serve me a phenomenal steak a few weeks ago. Regardless, I'll never stop coming here. It's just too much of a comfort zone for me. Too many good memories. Arthur's is a part of Hoboken and that makes it a part of me. So I'm not really sure I could write an honest critique for Arthur's like a someone eating here for the first time.
2018-08-01,2,There were 4 of us.  Three of them ordered Hamburgers, and were pleased with them.I ordered the Calamari appetizer.  Neither of the sauces were "hot" like you would expect.  I order the 24 ounce Rib Eye Steak medium rare and it arrived well done.  It was not good at all, but when you are on a 17 hour workday, you eat what you have and go back to work.I will NEVER go back to this restaurant !!!!!!!!!!!
2018-07-25,4,A GREAT steak sandwich!!!!!! I ordered the all American and the combo of steak, cheese and grilled onions was perfect! The fries were nice, crispy and fresh. You have to ask for the slaw even though it says it comes with it.
2018-07-22,5,Have been to Arthur's since 1987 and always love to return. Took Friends out for lunch for the 1st time and excellent timing rather than dealing with the dining crowd and noise and PARKING!!! Was able to get space next to entrance. Steaks and everything were consistent with the evening service but much better since the lunch crowd was lite that day.Had a great meal for home to Texas and really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere as we were able to pick a table up front and just enjoy the crowd and friendship.
2018-07-16,4,I was a little taken back when first sitting down.  Old decor and strange smell.  But the waitress was fabulous and the burgers were also.
2018-06-30,1,This place has gone off a cliff. My god, 15+ years coming here and it is terrible. They should call it something else and save the memories of what Arthur's used to be instead of torturing the name.
2018-06-09,4,Came here with some friends not too long ago for the first time for dinner and had a great meal. Parking in the area can be a little bit hectic, especially on weekends but that's the only thing bad about this place. The establishment is pretty big, they have outdoor seating available, along with some tables in the front and in the back. We sat near the front but the back area looked like a pretty chill spot- decent sized bar and looks like a good place to hang out and grab some drinks. Our server Jason was phenomenal!!! He was extremely helpful with making menu suggestions and was constantly checking on our table to make sure we were all enjoying ourselves. For starters, our table ordered the garlic bread (absolutely a must because it's delicious!), French onion soup, and calamari. For dinner, I wound up getting a Filet mignon, served with a lobster tail and a baked potato. I won't sit there and say this is the best steakhouse I have ever been to, but I will say everything I ate I did thoroughly enjoy. Decent establishment to visit if you are in the area, I would happily go back again.
2018-05-07,1,This place is a shadow of the glory days it used to have.I used to LOVE coming here. It was an old school steakhouse that felt glamorous but classic. It used to be the whole white tablecloth, stellar service deal.I hadn't been here in a couple of years but was in town for the Hoboken Spring Festival.My fiance and I stumbled upon here because they looked empty. That should have been our first sign.The place had plastic red checkered tablecloths now, you know, the kind your grandmother had. They were ratty and not in the best shape. The place was very DARK and dim even though the lights were on. What a sad ghost of a great place. They were COMPLETELY empty. One couple joined us after we had sat down but otherwise we had the place to ourselves. Service was still fairly slow for how empty it was. The waiter was very slow the entire time. We started with the "Famous" garlic bread. This was my favorite part of the meal. It's a simple roll covered in butter, garlic, parmesan and parsley cut into slices. It's greasy but it's exactly how garlic bread should taste. I could have used a little more garlic or cheese but still very good.I ordered the filet mignon sandwich, he ordered the rib eye sandwich (this was lunch time and we were on a budget, so we didn't want to do the dinner entrees). My sandwich comes out, and it's mostly bread. The underside of the sandwich is already soggy and falling apart by the time it comes to the table because it was soaked in grease. The filet mignon was tender but there was barely any of it on the sandwich. I didn't expect a lot but the lack of toppings was a disappointment. Same goes with the caramelized onions and mushrooms. The onions were absolutely not caramelized, they were sauteed at best. The entire sandwich was SO GREASY. Not the good kind of greasy, but the, there's no way any human should eat this much greasy. The fries were good. Bland but good. The au jus on the side definitely tasted soy sauce based which felt very out of place for the sandwich.Fiance's ribeye was even greasier and just a mess of cheese and steak. Again very little steak, very very greasy and very lackluster.He asked for an unsweetened iced tea and got some fruity variation, definitely not what he ordered. My diet coke was flat. The worst part was that I definitely got sick from the food. Within a few minutes of finishing the meal, I'm feeling nauseous. Within an hour of eating the food, I had to search for a bathroom SO fast. That did not go well...I spent the rest of the day queasy and unsettled. Today my stomach feels fine just weak and drained from the food and everything that happened yesterday. For the prices, we expected much better. We would have been better off getting street food from the festival. Would have saved my stomach lining. I'm so so disappointed because I used to LOVE this place. I don't even know if I'll check out the other Arthur's in North Brunswick now. Very disappointed.
2018-04-25,5,Been coming here since the 80's. Hoboken SUX now. But Arthurs definitely is still the same! Shame u milelenials. Ur just a heart beat off a play date. U kill this town !!!
2018-04-14,3,Mixed review this is really 2.5 Stars. While waiting to be seated everything looks great and smells great. After being seated it's a different story. We had garlic bread. It was excellent. Wedge salad excellent, good blue cheese.  Mom had 10oz ribeye with caramelized onion sandwich. She asked for it just on the plate with no bread. It came as sandwich anyway. The choice of Steaks sucks. I'm a 12oz NY strip guy or 16oz prime rib, but all they have is 6oz petite fillet not enough food for a grown man or the 24oz "our steak" which is too much meat for anyone. I don't count the sirloin as a steak, we all know you make hamburgers from sirloin.  Anyway I ordered the "Our Steak" med rare. The sear was good and the temp was cooked perfect. But the steak was shit. No seasoning, not even salt, Excessive fat and veins that you cant even chew through. I have never pulled so much meat out of my mouth in a restaurant I was embarrassed what was left on my plate. Now I know why they give you 24oz it's because 12oz of spit out fat and grizzle remain on the plate at the end of the meal. Along with that I had  their famous potatoes which were mostly under seasoned, over cooked and cold at the same time. The kids had hamburgers and seemed to enjoy them. Overall I would say this is an average over priced steak house forcing people to get the $34 crapy ribeye steak. This will be a first and last time we would have preferred Outback, Texas road house or even Long Horn for a good steak at a reasonable price.
2018-04-14,1,Food is good , wait staff is rude and very understaffed to long of a wait ,  for that reason I'd never come back I'd walk across the street and some chicken nuggets ya digg
2018-04-08,4,A nice old school Hoboken restaurant. Enjoy the big ribeye with the home fries. A total treat after a long day in NY City.
2018-03-18,2,Tough meat in smaller portion, not like it used to be. Bad management, lower quality ingredients, higher price, Our Steak is no longer a bargain, and manager could not even speak English well. Sad to see long lived establishment going south.
2018-02-28,2,There is nothing special about Arthurs.  The meat is poor quality and if you think its great then you have never eaten a "good" steak.  If you want a burger, go here - but if you want a good steak, then you need a real steakhouse.  Half of the weight of their steaks is fat and grizzle. That's why they aren't expensive.  You can't pay $14 for a 12oz ribeye and think its going to be top quality. I once had a friend tell me that Arthur's was the best steak place in Hoboken as she proceeded to tell me that Red Lobster has great seafood.  That said, they do have good burgers and sandwiches, nice staff and decent prices.  But if you really appreciate fine meat products, save yourself the disappointment.
2018-02-26,5,Such a classic spot. Great place to meet and catch up with friends and enjoy a large beer and just really quality food. The prices won't break the bank, but the quality is good and it is just a nice and relaxing atmosphere.
2018-02-23,4,big steak with potatoes on the side,fried calamari to start it off,we never finish eating the steak ,always get mid rare steak and butter for a next day treat if you dont finish it,service is good staff is awesome,if you like tap beers this is the place to be,i would suggest a cab or uber limited parking in hoboken,dependable service,fav steak spot for me and wife
2018-02-22,4,Tried their Monday burger day. $8.99 with their famous burger plus 2 topping (original like $15). It's real food and you can customize your burger. Restaurant itself is huge and have backroom too. Light is a little big dark. I would definitely come back again for Monday burger day.
2018-02-10,2,I am so disappointed!!!! I live in Morris County so I usually go to the arthurs in Morris Plains. Being in the area of Hoboken I figured i'd try out the Arthurs here. NOT THE SAME WHAT SO EVER. No table side pickles, no homemade cole slaw, and the food over all is just not as good. Got a french onion soup and a burger. The soup needed at least 2 more minutes heating up, and the burger had no seasoning what so ever and was extremely bland. (And arthurs is known for their burgers). If you've been to Arthurs in morris plains and want to try this one, DONT. You'll be let down
2018-02-10,4,Haven't been to Arthur's in over 20 years so when I was in the area decided to stop in. The wife and I ordered the same Meal which was the original steak it came with potatoes also pickles and hot red peppers. The steak is a 24 oz ribeye. The steak was cooked medium rare and was served as requested. Steak tasted just as good as I had remembered it. The last time we ate there which was about 20 years ago we ate at the downstairs portion of the restaurant but this time we sat upstairs. We showed up on a Saturday afternoon and there was only two other tables with customers. The price for the steak and the potatoes is roughly about 30 bucks. We also ordered some beers. The service was extremely quick and friendly . The menu is definitely filled with other items but when an Arthur's I stick with the steak. Also have the French onion soup you will not regret it. If I'm in the area again and in the mood for steak I will definitely stop by Arthur's again.
2018-02-04,3,I've been an Arthur's fan for years.  I hadn't been for a little while so my son and I stopped in for lunch.  We both had burgers and of course a side of Arthur's famous potatoes.  The food was fine but not amazing.  I've had a sense that the quality has been in decline here and this trip confirmed it.  I've been to the Morris Plains location recently and felt it was much better, more in keeping with the Arthur's experience I've come to expect over the years.
2018-01-30,5,So I definitely had mixed expectations the second I walked into this place because it definitely looks like a dive type spot.I went because it was highly recommended by 2 people and I was really in the mood for a good steak.  I quickly noticed that the area where we were seated was filled with guys so that to me had to be a sign that this place was doing something right! lolIt was a no brainer to get the Arthurs 'Our Steak" which was their 24 oz Marbled Cut Rib Eye that was served their Arthur's Potatoes.  Hey if you are going to a staple steakhouse in Hoboken, you might as well order what they are known for right? lol Lucky or perhaps unlucky for me I was sharing this steak because there was no way I was finishing a 24 oz cut!  We ordered a bottle of their Alamos Malbec that paired really well with our meal along with their Calamari for starters.The Calamari were good but nothing compared to the steak that was coming our way.  The smell alone had your mouth watering and one bite and you immediately understood why this place was known for their steak.  It had such good flavor and was cooked to perfection!  Their potatoes were also really good and we also got French fries.  We really should have ordered their garlic bread as well but it might have put us in a food coma lolI honestly can't believe I had not eaten here before and can definitely see myself as being a regular! Truly a gem hidden among all the bars on Washington Ave in Hoboken.
2018-01-28,2,2 stars for the service- warm and inviting. That's about it. I ordered their filet mignon and mashed potatoes (+ asparagus), my brother went safe with a burger and fries. Something in my meal combination gave me food poisoning. I am absolutely never going back. Traumatized really
2018-01-24,1,Summary of below:Steaks overcooked.Waitstaff slow, not friendly or helpful.CHECK YOUR BILL FOR ADDED FOOD YOU DIDN'T ORDER!If you are looking for a good Arthur's experience I highly recommend NOT going to this locations and seeking out their other locations as the Hoboken location has been franchised.  Let me start by listing all the positives:The "our steak" was great.  Cooked as ordered and tasty.Appetizers were good and a came out fast.Now the long list of negatives:We came with a large party so the tip was forced to be 20%.Our waitress "Marisol" was horrible but I assume she didn't care because she knew she was already getting 20% of an estimated large bill.  It took her forever to come to the table every time we needed something.  When we asked her for something like extra limes for our drinks we had to ask 2 or 3 separate times because she kept forgetting.When we asked for additional drinks we had to ask 2 and 3 times.We got our appetizers fast but our main course took forever to come out (and it wasn't very busy). And some peoples steaks were cold so the food was probably sitting under a heat lamp for a period of time.3 peoples filet mignons were cooked well well done when they asked for medium rare.  We told Marisol about this but we did not want to send them back to have to wait another 30 minutes to get the rest of the food.Desert was served, then the coffees came out 15 minutes after the ice cream desert.Here is the kicker...CHECK YOUR BILLSince we were a large party we had to really carefully look over everything.  The quick story, we were overcharged, then she corrected it, then she overcharged us again.We noticed that she charged for an extra desert.  I brought it to her attention and at first she told me I was wrong..so i explained all the deserts and she said she would correct it.  In an effort to leave as quick as possible I gave her 6 credit cards as we were splitting it with a large party.  While she corrected one extra desert, she ADDED another one for no reason.  On top of this she told me she realized she forgot to charge for 3 espressos and added them to the bill.  So in total she removed one desert then incorrectly added one desert and 3 espressos without informing me.  Then she charged half the credit cards based on the original price.  Half way through charging the cards she recalculated the total and informed me that the last 3 credit cards would be charged about $5 more dollars each.  I have no problem paying for what we ate but we were splitting this between 6 cards so the total should have been divided accordingly..she didn't care.Then when we got the cards back and looked over the bill once again, I brought to her attention that she charged use for an extra desert after she removed the other wrong desert.  Instead of correcting the bill she just gave me CASH out of her pocket.My family is friends with the original owners and they informed us that they sold this location. So maybe its the management that is making the restaurant go down hill. This was a first time experience for a lot of the guests in our party and the way we were treated, quality of service, and quality of food specifically at the HOBOKEN location will keep all of us from coming back.  It also reflects poorly on the Arthur's name on the whole.
2018-01-20,3,The Hoboken location has been around for a long time. First time going there was in the 80s. Occasionally visited for special events and that steak itch. There are times when it is good and some are not. It has been consistent. You can always depend on having a good meal, leaving full and walking out with leftovers. Service is good and mostly accurate. Menu hasn't change much. Classics French Onion soup and garlic bread starters are always recommended. Steak medium, potatoes and A1 sauce. If I remember correctly there was pickles but we did not get any. Maybe its only for dinner.Arthur's is solid but not the best around. It's that good safe choice most will like. Recommended if nothing else floats your boat.
2018-01-13,4,This place was recommended to me by one of my good friends. I thought I would give it a try. The boyfriend wanted to come here for his bday dinner. On one of the coldest days of the year, we trooped all the way to Hoboken and made our way to Arthur's. We got there at 5 and the restaurant was empty. We did not mind it one bit. We ordered the Loaded Nacho for appetizer. The Nacho was fairly big and it seemed as though it should be shared among 4 people and not just 2. But since we were hungry, we devoured it. When our steak came, I was pretty full from the nachos. The steak was delicious but there were more fat on it than I expected. But we were able to cut the fat off. Besides that, the steak was amazing! The service was superb considering we were the only ones sitting there. But the guy refilled our water and checked on us often! Great steak and relaxing atmosphere, who wouldn't come back?!
2017-12-23,3,When coming back home, it is a must to consider Authurs. Fortunely found parking easily on Washington St. Have eaten here countless times in the pass. Maybe it's my tastebuds, but the "our steak" just taste like a clump of meat with no flavor. Without A1 sauce it would be dreadful. Also on the website the steak is listed at 31.95.... but at the restaurant it is 34.95. I'm not one to nickel and dime over good food, but I do not believe it was a $35 steak. Good part about my experience was Alex the bartender. She was very good, knowledge, fast, and meet the demands of the needy waiters.
2017-12-22,4,What a great steak!Relaxed atmosphere, great service, fairly priced, and a nice steak. There wasn't a scrap left on my plate.The potatoes are great too.It is the perfect combination of a dive and a steakhouse.
2017-12-18,1,Very very rude. Sat down and ordered a drink in an empty restaraunt on a Saturday night. A waitress came up to us and said "you need to leave because no one wants to eat here because you're here." Disgusting. We left and will never return.
2017-11-25,1,The worst. period. Food, service, and atmosphere. The clogged toilet and its contents were a fitting end to a lousy experience. Not the Arthur's you think it is. Only the name is the same.
2017-11-21,5,I've been coming here for about 10 years and always love it here. Good service excellent food and steak is delicious for money I pay!
2017-11-09,5,This is my local steak house, I have lived in Hoboken for 13 years, the steaks are awesome and enough meat that I only go about twice a year, I have had less luck with other dishes but this is a steakhouse so ...., the drinks are very reasonably priced nothing to exciting but adequate.Best place to sit is in the back room as it's much larger than out front and has a nice atmosphere when there are a few people in.I recommend swapping the house potatoes for fries as I find them to be greasy, but each to there own.They do a deal on Thursday with steak for two and a starter and a desert I don't recall the price but it's a good deal.Go you won't be disappointed
2017-10-15,2,This is kind of a dingy and sad looking place with gaudy red and white checkered disposable plastic table cloths and utterly flavorless shrimp. Is the garlic bread good? Yeah, it's pretty tasty, but just get any soft white bread like potato bread and milk bread and douse it in a bunch of butter and garlic powder and you can pretty much recreate it.I got the shrimp cocktail appetizer, and you get five shrimp for $11. The shrimp were blanched out of its lives and had utterly no flavor whatsoever. But what am I doing ordering shrimp cocktail at what is clearly a steak and burger sort of restaurant, right? The BBQ ribs were pretty tasty, so I guess you'd be fine ordering that.
2017-10-04,5,I have had plenty of ribeyes in my life, but I must say that Arthur's "Our Steak" is my favorite out of them all. I'm not sure whether it's the perfect marbling of the meat or the tasty sear on the outside, but I have yet to find a better steak anywhere else in the world. The potatoes that come with the steak are the perfect accompaniment to the melt-in-your-mouth ribeye. If you are looking for amazing garlic bread, look no more. Arthur's garlic bread is amazing. It is a mouthwatering combination of butter and garlic.If you are worried that a steakhouse like Arthur's won't satisfy your sweet cravings, put that out of your head. Their Tiramisu is heavenly. I don't even know if they make it themselves or order it, but it doesn't matter. Just make sure you order it.I love that they have a pretty good selection of beers on draft. Their ice cold Blue Moon with the gigantic orange slice quenches your thirst and cleanses your palate so you can enjoy the huge chunk of meaty goodness in front of you.
2017-10-01,2,This used to be a casual treat for us.   Big juicy burgers, tasty steaks and a good value.  That is gone with the current owner and we are reluctantly scratching it off our list after a Sunday afternoon visit in an nearly empty restaurant.  $14 for an average cheese burger and a small order of soggy fries? Nope,. Too many options in Hoboken   $14 for a cheese quesadilla (no guacamole) ?  Sorry.  This owner is short sighted.
2017-09-14,4,One question you should ask yourself heading to this old school place: ARE YOU HUNGRY? I love their steaks. Nicely broiled and love the side dishes.
2017-09-11,5,The place to go if you just want to have a good, casual time and eat a really big steak.  Old School place with red and white checkered tablecloths. Simple menu that stars its steak, but they have some burgers, soups and sandwiches as well. Personally, I stick with the steak, which comes with potatoes as well. I have a pretty big appetite and even had some left over.  Decent selection of beers on tap and friendly service. Music not too loud, so you can have a decent conversation. They've got some Italian desserts like tiramisu and tartufo as well. Other your steak a degree under what you want, as I find that they can over do it a bit. I asked for medium rare when I really wanted medium and it was about perfect. My wife asked for medium and although she still really enjoyed it, found it more on the medium well side.
2017-09-07,5,I stopped in for the first time tonight after going to the Yankees game. We had Mike as our server and he was excellent. He was very attentive, friendly and timed everything perfectly. I am a restaurant manager and I would be lucky to have him serving in my restaurant. My father and I both had the filet mignon and a wedge salad and both were excellent. The steaks were cooked to perfection. The only critique I have is slightly too much dressing on the salad. Everything else was great and we had an amazing meal. Thank you for a great dinner!
2017-08-30,5,I take my boyfriend here every year for his birthday. The steaks always come out perfect and the staff is super friendly! I definitely recommend for anyone visiting Hoboken looking for an authentic steak dinner-- great steakhouse atmosphere
2017-08-19,2,I used to be a regular here but after the new management this place really went downhill. The waiter busted his ass while the other waiter/waitress watched. I remember back in the day this placed used to be packed on a Saturday night. Now I realized why.
2017-08-12,1,this place not like original place in morris plains price on 24 oz 34.95 way more and was very salty burger smaller and twice the price it was a big disappointment
2017-07-29,3,We came here for a friends birthday party on a Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was much bigger than I expected and we were taken to a table in the back. To start off our meal, we had nachos, garlic bread and calamari. All fairly standard for appetizers. For the main course, most of us either had their "our steak"(rib eye) or the strip steak. When the steaks came out, all of them were overcooked!!! Very disappointing for a steakhouse... In my experience, they are usually underdone. We had a couple of them remade, and the second time, they were still overcooked!!!! If you ever come here to eat steak, make sure you order it underdone, and hopefully you will get it at the right temperature.
2017-07-27,5,Trends come and go in Hoboken, and nowhere is that more on display than the main drag of Washington Street. Amidst the clubs, frozen yogurt spots, and juice bars is Arthur's, a decades old steakhouse and city institution.Here with a friend on a hazy Thursday night, we snagged a table outside and picked up one of Hoboken's best bargains: the Thursday night special for two. A shared appetizer, an individual entree, and a glass of beer or soda a piece for a total of $50. We split an order of calamari and each went with the junior sirloin.A plate of crisp calamari hit the table quickly, the squid just chewy enough and served with marinara and a spicy aioli. The steak (a 16oz NY strip) came a spot on medium rare, slightly charred, and well seasoned without too much salt. The pile of roasted potatoes on the side were delicious on their own and the lone pickled cherry pepper provided a bracing contrast to the rich meat.One of the best steakhouses in Hudson County
2017-07-19,4,I came here with a group of friends from Japan so that they can try something very American. Their classic rib eye steak "Our Steak" lived up to its reputation, everyone agreed this was the best choice amongst all the different steaks we ordered that day including Surf & Turf, and Filet Mignon. Another favorite was French onion soup, it was surprisingly authentic, it reminded me of soupe à l'oignon gratinée I had in typical brasseries in Paris. This place is good for a big group, there are enough tables and all 6 of us sat comfortably in a round table. I really hate going to Hoboken because of the parking situation but I wouldn't coming back here again.
2017-07-09,2,My friends and I decided to come here after they were raving about how good their steaks were here. We were at Newport Mall, so this place was only a short 10 minute drive from there. Upon entering the restaurant, we noticed that there were only about 2-3 other tables that were occupied including ours. Not a good sign considering that it was a Thursday evening. The place had a bar-like atmosphere and we had to trek around corners over to the back of the restaurant until they seated us. The place had a distinct odor to it that I can't describe. Once we were seated, our waiter who was very hospitable took our orders. We all started off with 2 orders of the garlic bread (which was delicious, btw) and a friend and I split the "Our Steak" which was a Delmonico Ribeye done medium rare. We all devoured our orders once they all came. Our steak was ok-ish. A little on the salty side. And our 2 servings of vegetables tasted frozen and later microwaved. Yuck. The potatoes were especially dry. I usually don't like wasting food and I usually clean my plate, but I just couldn't here. Also, my friend's steak that she ordered medium rare turned out nearly well-done. Overall, I had a pretty bad first experience here and I probably wouldn't be back in the future. 1.5 stars rounded up to 2 for our nice server.
2017-06-23,4,I ordered the cheesesteak. It was delicious. My friends ordered the salmon, they loved their dinners as well. Portions are big. Service was fast and really attentive. Drinks were STRONG. We ate outside tho and the chairs and tables are really wobbly and not comfortable at all.
2017-06-20,4,Been coming here for a long time now for holidays, always great service . Prices have gone up a bit but for the quality it's still worth it. Wish they would have their wings on their specials more often. Only seen them on their Twice. They also got rid of their rib and steak combo which is why I gave only 4/5 stars. And I only did that because I knew how great the deals used to be. I get t though some places much change with the times! I haven't had anything here that I haven't loved. Sandwiches are huge and well "stuffed". They have a bar area , a front and outside seating area and a regular dining area to please the needs of any atmosphere you are looking for. Decor is a little out dated but it's gives the authentic feel that it's been here for a while and still has great quality food. I always recommend  this place to friends and will continue to do so.
2017-06-18,4,After a long hot day being outside at Ellis Island we were definitely ready to eat some food! I was a little impatient because the restaurant wasn't very full at the time (Sunday around 4:00 PM) and probably dehydrated so it did take the waiter some time to bring out our waters. My boyfriend was surprised that the prices had gone up since he last went and that the garlic bread wasn't complimentary. The garlic bread was amazing though with all of the parmesan cheese! Well worth the money spent on it. Also, my other complaint was that it was just a bit hot in the restaurant and I guess I just had high expectations for eating a meal in an igloo after spending all day outside lol. My boyfriend ordered the Our Steak and I ordered the Surf and Turf. My boyfriend's steak was amazing. It was so huge (23 oz) and delicious! I asked for my filet mignon medium but since it's such a thick cut of meat, it felt more on the rare side (noob steak person lol) and the shrimp was a bit overcooked. I would definitely return but would really want to get the Our Steak next time. Our server was fantastic.
2017-06-15,4,I hadn't been here in 6 months.....read some recent reviews critical of the service and staff....I ate here last night with a group of 15 co-workers..the staff could not have been more attentive or friendly....we were treated well....steaks were solid.... potatoes delicious... garlic bread was great... atmosphere was good....we had a great time....no complaints or concerns....I never even had to flag down our server for a beer....she was hustling back and forth from the bar and did a phenomenal job.
2017-06-05,3,No frills.  The food was good but nothing to brag about.  Service was extremely quick (we went for an early dinner)  The price fits most of the items on the menu some overpriced (steak).  Disappointed asked for medium rare steak , it was basically well done, (NO PINK)  The burger not on the other hand was also asked for medium rare and was pink inside.  For a burger this place is fine I wouldn't stray too far away from that.  The wedge salad was great, the blue cheese made it even better.  Good for a quick burger and drink nothing more.
2017-05-15,4,The steak sandwiches are bomb, Reuben sandwiches are bomb, red sangria is delish, mango margarita was alllll sugar. Couldn't drink it. They have a good cocktail list as well. Our waiter was friendly. They don't do happy hour but we got dinner and two rounds of drinks for under $60 which is cheap for Hoboken and for the amount of food we got. The place is dark and has an old rustic vibe. Kinda reminds me of the old Irish pubs in the city. The party next to us came all the way from CALIFORNIA for the steak. They were so excited they finally made it. Def worth a stop for a good meal if you're ever in Hoboken.
2017-05-13,1,I would give it zero stars except for the waiters.  However the food leaves much to be desired. I ordered a salad with blue cheese and walnuts. The walnuts were stale and there was hardly any cheese or the chief forgot to put it in. The steak was chewy. The toilets were like a third world country clogged with toilet paper and feces and dirty. No paper towels either. Will never go back to this restaurant and hope the owner reads this review. It is sad this could be a good restaurant if someone stepped up to the plate.
2017-04-21,1,WORST DINNER AND CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE I'VE HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. READ THIS IN FULL BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO DINE HERE:Went here last night with a group of friends for dinner and drinks. To start, I arrived there quite a bit earlier than the rest of the group so I decided to go get a drink at the bar which was in the back of the restaurant down a couple of hallways. I had found this out from the only employee I could find who didn't speak any english (luckily I speak enough spanish to communicate) and ended up finding the bar in a back area of the building. I arrived at the bar, where there wasn't a bartender or any people for that matter (5:45pm on a Thursday). Someone finally came along and asked if I needed anything, I explained that I was waiting for a group of friends and I'll take a beer. About 5 minutes later I needed to make a phone call and went to step out to do so, and was stopped by the bartender, and told that I need to leave my credit card if I want to go outside otherwise I would have to close out my tab. As someone who has worked in the restaurant industry for over 15 years I was actually embarrassed for the establishment that their staff as well as their clientele are of such low quality to have to be scrutinized over a pint of beer. I said nothing, gave her my card, and went on to make my phone call. I should also mention very little of the staff overall speak decent or any english at all, including the owner/manager.Fast forward to the meal (leaving out several other rude gestures from both the bartender slash waiteress slash food runner and what appeared to be the owner)  we all ordered 2 courses in addition to the several drink's we had all had at this point catching up. The food came out remarkably fast which is a huge red flag at a place that deems itself a "steak house" since all it tells you is that food isn't being prepared to order but instead coming out of soup warmers and steam tables (including the disgusting mushy strangely dark potatoes they put on every plate that taste like dirty fryer oil). 3 out of the 6 of us had to make an emergency run to the restroom. I'll repeat this in caps so that people scrolling past take a second look:3 OF THE 6 OF US HAD TO MAKE AN EMERGENCY RUN TO THE RESTROOM.This is a common indicator of improper storage, refrigeration, contaminated food preparation, etc etc etc to say the least. Based on how dirty the dining areas and restrooms are, I am going to take an educated guess in saying that the kitchen and walk in refrigeration are littered with health code violations, stale puddles of blood, mold, bacteria, etc. The steaks were greasy, underseasoned,very lackluster in quality cuts (I ordered a ribeye and the cut wasn't even even, resulting in a very unevenly cooked steak, (a rainbow of temperatures I didn't order). All in all you get what you pay for, a 32$ ribeye which is likely junk generic choice meat hacked up in the back by some amigos in the back under the supervision of no one possessing even a serve safe certificate. I should also mention when we were at the bar moving to our table, the bartender slash waitress slash food runner had asked me if we would be paying all together, and I explained to her that, no, we are all going to pay separately. She then went to say "well that's really annoying for me, can't you just split it at the table." Extremely, mindblowingly unprofessional to say the least. Summary: As a chef in the industry I am embarrassed for this restaurant. This is not a steak house, it is a dirty, dingy, outdated, low quality greasy spoon with a very good location in Hoboken. Anyone who gives this place a stellar review needs to expand their horizons a bit and venture into quality establishments more often. Service: 0 out of 5 starsFood: -2 out of 5 stars (would have given them a 1 out of 5 but I subtracted 1 for each case of food poisoning my table received)Overall experience -20/5 starsWhen a family of South Americans buy an American staple business including the name, and try to suck every dime out of the place without reinvesting a cent, you have a textbook Kitchen Nightmares level establishment. I'm sure the same thing would happen if your average American family moved to Mexico and took over an existing Mexican restaurant without a clue in the world how to prepare the food or operate the establishment. Avoid this place, if the food were free it would be overpriced.
2017-04-15,4,I live in Miami now but back in the day I used to come here all the time. Amazingly enough it was so declicious. The onion soup was spot on. The steak and slaw was amazing. The potatoes definitely used to be better. They used to taste as if they were cooked with some sort of sauce. The burger according to the children was really good.  This will definitely be my go to place for steak when I visit NYC.
2017-04-13,5,I traveled for work twice in a matter of weeks (March and April 2017).  Both times I ordered the Ribeye with potatoes (it was that good).  My co-workers loved the place as well.  Very reasonable and highly recommended.
2017-04-03,5,Best juicy steak for the price! Beats some nyc steakhouses. Service is excellent! We have been coming here for years md Arthurs never disappoints!
2017-03-20,4,Steak was delicious and plentiful. Sides were a bit salty... so don't eat here every day. Plenty of seating for big family get-togethers. I've only tried the ribeye though.
2017-03-08,4,The ribeye steak was cooked to perfection and paired wonderfully with some caramelized onions and red potatoes, but the best touch was this little spicy pepper that u can cut little pieces to add to every bite of steak and potatoes! Yum! Just enough of a kick and very flavorful. The waitress was nice and gave good attention. My sisters favorite thing off the menu is the french onion so if your a french onion aficionado then i recommend this place! :)
2017-03-04,3,This place screams 1972! Arthurs is what some may consider, "a blast from the past," which is a big reason people come here.Reason you will come here:If you're in the mood for a steak, you're in luck, since they happen have the best steaks you can get on Washington.Ratings Breakdown:5-star steaks2-star burgers3-star service4-star atmosphereThe rest:Other than steak, the menu is hit or miss, as I have found the Arthur burger to be soggy and required a fork/knife, but other items such as the Filet mignon sandwich are on point. The service leaves something to be desired, with long wait times for food and check. In addition, we also never received water for our table. On a more positive note, the atmosphere is fantastic, and fits the mood for eating steak quite nicely. The checkered red plastic table cloths give the feel of an outdoor BBQ. Music spanned several decades, but mostly 60's and 70's. Definitely a cool place to check out if you ever wondered what old Hoboken was like.
2017-02-18,2,Came in with my date.Ordered the 48oz steak for 2 to share. The dinner came with 2 large steaks on one plate and a pile of potatoes on another and one empty plate. I asked the waitress for another empty plate, she said to cut the steak and use that plate, another plate would cost an additional $5 I agreed to pay the $5 . I waited for the plate that finally came with an order of more potatoes. The food for the price is ok, but not good enough to warrant that kind of attitude.
2017-02-17,5,Omg the best bang for your buck for an amazing steak. First off the garlic bread is the best I've ever had at a restaurant. The restaurant is a very homey but the food is top notch. It's right on Washington street in Hoboken so I'm sure parking can be annoying but it's worth it for this place. We shared a steak between two people and had enough for breakfast the next day which is really rare. Totally loved the food and reasonably priced for beer if you choose to have that with your steak. Great place! Plan to go again when I'm in the mood for a well seasoned steak and home made potatoes.
2017-02-13,3,My girlfriend and I recently visited this place this weekend. It's an OK place to enjoy a large piece of meat. I had a lobster and the our steak which is a ribeye. The quality of the food seemed to be very poor however the flavor really made up for the quality. My steak was well seasoned and my lobster came with a really nice citrus butter. My girlfriend and I ordered our steaks medium well but it seemed to be more of medium. The potatoes was the star of the dish however. Their signature potatoes and the mashed potatoes were actually pretty good and flavorful. We didn't stay for dessert as we had other plans but what I can truly say for this restaurant is if you would like hearty meal at a lower price this is definitely your place.
2017-02-11,1,I've been here before and had a pleasant time. I went tonight with my boyfriend and by the time we came home he had food poisoning. I called the restaurant to let them know so they were aware of the problem, and the response I got was "well we sold over 700 steaks today with no problems." THAT is your customer service? Absolutely horrible and they should be ashamed.
2017-02-04,5,My favorite place to get a giant mouth watering steak is Arthurs. It's worth every penny. The place is located in the middle of Hoboken so it's a great place to get a good dinner and then go out and enjoy the area. When you get inside its not fancy at all. Seems more like a giant pub/ bar scene. I always ask for a bucket of pickles and peppers which is on the house. When Iv gone with my family we usually get a log of garlic bread to share which is so buttery and delicious. My main course is always the crab cake with steak and potatoes.  The crab cake is plump with lots of real crab and not heavily breaded. The steak is always prime cut and cooked to how you like it. As I write this review I'm salivating. One of my favorite places to eat.
2017-01-28,4,During 2017 winter Hudson Restaurant Week, I picked Arthur's as the first place to visit. This was the 2nd time visiting this place. When I arrived around 7PM on a Friday night, the place was pretty empty but after 30 minutes, it was packed! I had Our Steak with salad and cheesecake. My husband had Our Steal with soup and chocolate mousse cake. Both meals came with the garlic bread, which was my favorite part of the meal. Our Steak was good but a little bit burned. It was a massive piece of meat. I could only finish 1/3 of it. We took the desserts to go and had them for breakfast the next day. Chocolate mousse was very good, especially the Oreo crust. However, the cheesecake was too dense. The waiter was pretty nice and funny. However, the host lady was a little bit on the cold side.
2017-01-26,5,I have been coming here for over 20 years sitting at the back bar .. 24 oz Delmonico garlic bread , wedge salad and pickles and hot peppers .. don't for get the ice cold beer.. I recommend it to anyone that love meat.. can't go wrong. And still priced right.
2017-01-21,3,16oz Ny Strip, and French Onion SoupOrdered the steak rare came medium well. Senew  throughout not juicy at all. Low quality meat for the price. Veggies on side were good though.  French onion soup was typical.Their famous pickles were soft and soggy.Was there an hour and 45 minutes only saw the waitress 3 times.Piña Colada was basically virgin.Definitely not coming back.
2017-01-21,3,The last 5 times since 2015 I have been were great. Asked for a the "our steak" medium every time and it came medium. Last night I was really looking fwd to my 6th experience. Unfortunately the garlic bread tasted stale , the steak cam well done (no pink at all). To be fair I should have complained and sent it back but was with some new friends and didn't want to want to ruffle up the situation. I'm hoping this was just an off day and will try again to upgrade the stars and the review. Hoping the a management reads this in case it is headed in the wrong direction and turns it around because I would like to keep going to this place.
2017-01-15,3,So is it a fancy place ? No, but its ok. We had 9 guys all eating and drinking, food was good . Well the main course was good , i had a our steak wich was great . Dont waist your money on the apps.  We got there early , and it seemed like we were rushed, the place was not crowded and we were spending alot of money. We ordered a bunch of apps and they came out real quick. Nachos, calamari , garlic bread. Bread was great. Again we were ordering drinks all night , but still waitress kept coming back asking us if we were ready , we told her to give us time and 5 minutes later she was back . Its nothing fancy but food was good, so id go back but make sure tell the waitress your not in a rush
2016-12-29,4,I've been coming to Arthurs since I was a kid, when the 24oz steak was will $24, and now we are at the $32 mark. So I will always think this will is a bit expensive cause I came when it was under the original ownership. But I have a soft spot in my heart for this place. Honestly, great local place with great steak. They are known for their steaks, and thats pretty much it. They feature the 24 oz and the 48oz. Whether you can finish the steak or not, its pretty good old fashion steak with their amazing home fries. I am not a fan of home fries at all, but their version was pretty awesome. It always so toasty and crispy. And I totally recommend taking whatever steak you don't finish home, and repurposing it to make steak & eggs the next day (I've been doing this for like the last 8 years.) And while waiting for your steaks, make sure you ask for the pickle bucket and an order of garlic bread. I'm not sure what brine they use for the pickles, but its basically holy juice. The pickles are always so salty (the good salty), and you ALWAYS get that crunch factor. And lastly, the toasty, extra garlic-y bread, that comes serve in foil and when you open it, the steam literally blows in your face. I am always on the hunt for a good steak place, but this place is always my backup just in case. Happy eatings!
2016-12-12,4,This is a great place for a nice, well-cooked, juicy burger. The Monday special is the most reasonably priced burger deal that I have experienced: three toppings, French fries, and lettuce/tomato/onion. The service was prompt and the waiter checked on us consistently.  The burger itself was quite tasty with plenty of toppings and fries. Even though it was a special price, they didn't skimp at all. I like the atmosphere: very decorative for the holidays with just the right amount of old school with the tables, chairs, and red checkered table clothes. Despite some of the reviews I read, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and quantity.
2016-11-28,4,Ahhh Arthur's. I was recommended to this place by my one friend, who works as an accountant. He's a nice, young Asian man with an average haircut but is doing rather well for himself. Well enough that he has been to Arthur's previously and strongly recommended this place to me over the other steakhouses in Hoboken. Once you walk into the place it seems rather small with a grand smell. That is until they take you to the hidden back wing which can hold about 60 people and were told was only for large parties. As my friends and I sat down, we noticed a middle-aged man standing in the corner next to our table, quietly observing us. I wondered for a little while, "Who is this man? Why is he standing right next to us?". I am quite sure that he heard all our conversations but I ended up paying him no mind. A good 5-10 minutes later, this stand-in-the-corner man walks up to our table and starts to welcome us. Turns out he was our waiter. We ended up ordering the 2 for $50 deal, which is available only on Thursdays. Of course, us young kids, with new jobs and the fresh excitement of finally have the means to over-indulge, made sure to order a garlic bread appetizer. Whether it was the actual bread, or the fact that we all had an opportunity to finally have a nice juicy steak in our mouths, the garlic bread was pretty fantastic. I highly recommend trying it. Along with the bread, we also got the nachos and calamari as appetizers, which happened to come with the 2 for $50 deal. These were also good, but did not compare to the bread.Now on to the steak. It was fantastic. Nice and juicy. Had a nice grill and smoky taste to it. If I was a professional food critic then I would add more adjectives here, but unfortunately I am not. 4/5 would recommend.
2016-11-23,3,You know what, definitely used to be the "it" steakhouse" back in the day---super packed, steak cooked perfectly. Not so much for me anymore. Took some friends here visiting from Canada, and said hey y not, were coming from Jersey City---Peter Lugars was too far! Arthur's it is!-came in on weekend, was dead-steak ordered "medium well", was still alive pretty much!-waitress reached over to hand my friend her plate, she reached for it causing her to spill her wine (house red!)***waitress didn't replace it, or take it off the bill-for a plus, the potato side dish was still bomb!-parking in Hoboken still sucks, if not worse.-worth another trip back, most likely not, unless you picking me up and paying. Deuces Arthur's.***P.S has mad leftovers, threw that bleeding steak on a pan and fried the crap outve it! Bam.
2016-11-22,3,Hmmm Arthur's. I recently went for the second time to this place with a couple of my friends, one of which works at some energy company, I think. Or maybe he said celery. Not entirely sure. He's a nice, young Indian man with hair and is doing decently well for himself. He hit me up one day telling me how he was dying to get some meat in his cavity. So after, we did that, we went to Arthur's to get some steak. We were greeted at the front and then taken to the back and were told that the area was for the common folk. A bit odd, but the area seemed fine enough.As my friends and I sat down, I couldn't help but notice that my Indian friend was staring into the distance. He seemed lost in thought. Then, out of nowhere, a man approaches us and greets himself as our waiter. We had gone on a Thursday and luckily for us, there was a 2 for $50 deal which included steaks, an appetizer, and drinks for two. The four of us ordered two deals and an order garlic bread and began to chow down. The garlic bread was good, not too greasy. I only wish my friends would've left some for later. We got the calamari and nacho appetizers. The calamari was solid and the nachos were good too, even though I am not the biggest fan of nachos. As for steaks, my friends ordered the NY Strip, while I treated myself a bit to the rib-eye. The steak was very good and juicy, but I think there was a bit too much char flavor for my liking. I don't know how the strip compared, but my friends all seemed to be enjoying it a lot. The potatoes, onions, and peppers on the side were also quite good. The portions were huge and I had about half the steak and a mess of potatoes left to eat later on. The deal is great, with more than enough food for 2 people. We might've been able to order one deal for the four of us and still been pretty full at the end. Overall, I enjoyed the experience.
2016-11-12,1,DO NOT GO if you are looking for the real Arthur's.  This location was sold several years ago with the caveat that they could keep the name and the menu.  The only REAL Arthur's remaining is in Morris Plains.  Why do I know this?  Because two weeks ago, when we couldn't get in to the restaurant we had planned on eating, we ended up here, thinking it was tried and true and much closer to where we were than the Morris Plains location.  Although the front dining room was mostly empty, we were seated in the back room, which is cold and lacking in personality, and where there were only two tables seated.  My friend overhead the server mention to the host that they were trying to close the back.  The host responded angrily, "The servers do NOT tell ME what to do."  Unfortunately, I did not know this until well in to the meal.  We ordered cocktails.  I guess because the bartender was annoyed that we interrupted her and the small group of staff leaning and chatting at the end of the bar, my Tanqueray and tonic arrived with no noticeable taste or smell of gin and without lime...really?  I sent it back and we jumped to the blue cheese wedge, two bowls of French onion soup, and a bottle of wine.  We asked the server to ask the kitchen to split the wedge, which they always graciously do in Morris Plains.  The server grimaced a little and said the kitchen doesn't do that, but offered to bring two plates.  When the salad arrived, it was half the size it should be, nor was it a wedge.  We moved on to the onion soup, which was good, but not great.  It used to be killer here.  As we finished the soups, having not even ordered our mains yet, the other remaining table was asking for their check.  It wasn't even 10 PM on a Saturday.As we perused the "new" menu, where the classic Delmonico steak used to be $26.95 and still is in Morris Plains, I noticed the price of many things had gone up here - the steak to $31.95.  Whatever, right?  We were hungry.  As the only table still seated in back we ordered the main courses quickly.  To be fair, the steak was as delicious as always, but the accompanying potatoes, which I love, were cold, greasy and soggy.  Since we were clearly preventing the rear dining room from closing, we ate quickly and took the rest home.  Our waiter was very friendly and it was not his fault the host had had a tantrum.  Normally we sit at the Morris Plains Arthur's - and years ago at this location under the previous owner - for at least two hours, taking our time, enjoying our food, drinks, desserts and often port after dinner.  Here, feeling rushed, we were in and out with half our dinners packed in Styrofoam in about an hour.What a rip-off to market this as the "real" Arthur's.  Aside from the revenue lost because we didn't sit around eating and drinking as we do in Morris Plains, this was a waste of our time and money.  I will never go back to this location; nor would I recommend it to you.  If you want Arthur's, go to Morris Plains.  If you want steak, go someplace else where your experience matters to the staff and management.  It certainly doesn't here.
2016-11-08,3,you should not plan a trip to this place.  the best scenario is to prance around the neighborhood and go in and trick yourself.  24oz of steak after a while gets tiring just like anything else, best is to get a smaller portion
2016-10-27,5,This is my favorite steakhouse in town. If you are in hoboken and want to have steak this us the place. I had second steak of my life here and it was as amazing probably better than the first one I ever had in ruth's Chris steak house. I usually like well done, the steak was 24oz with potatoes, couldn't ask more for the prize we paid for. Definitely worth it. Tradition we followed, 1 litter beer followed by salad followed by 24oz steak with 1 more beer. Just loved it.
2016-10-18,4,The Steak or The Double.I used to be able to go through a 24oz steak here back in my prime, but now I'm older, and my metabolism asks me to share that steak with my friends...Good spot for ribeye, it's just okay when it comes to everything else thoughYou have to ask for pickles now... Don't forget! It's just not the same without them
2016-10-17,3,Haven't been there for at least 10 years. I remember it looked differently. Service was pretty good. The waiter was really attentive to our huge table. Got in our orders. The garlic bread was superb along with the calamari. The 32 oz rib eye was just too much. Good thing I ordered it medium rare and saved at least half for leftovers the following day which still tasted good. The steak was juicy, I usually prefer it charred to get that crispiness but it had a lot of burnt flavor. The potatoes that came with it very burnt which threw off my taste buds. The pricing is still pretty good.
2016-10-09,3,So I'm pretty sure this is the best burger in Hoboken, but that is up for debate obviously.Arthur's really personifies the whole rare mediumRare medium etc etc spectrum. You can tell most restaurants how you like your beef and they will almost never get it right like these guys.I was greedy this night and ordered two main entrees while my bf stuck with one. The burger was delicious. Good flavor, nice and juicy, the bun was soft and fresh and the veggies on top were good too. I got a steak as well that was cooked literally to perfection. I didnt get to enjoy fully bc my eyes were bigger than my belly but hey... From what I had I was impressed.I'd give these two items high stars.However, other things bring Arthurs down... I see all the past reviews about vermin. Now while I didnt see any myself, there are one too many reports to keep me close to comfort. My food was good but I did question the cleanliness of the place with a walk by the kitchen. Bro the cockroaches in hoboken are huge and knowing these mutants were possible walking among my food is enough to make my stomach churn. ( always say your grace folks lol)Our server was friendly but she did not introduce herself upon greeting, I had to ask her her name. It was pretty clear she was just moving along the assembly line with us. She was attentive but there wasnt any real friendliness from her. And I didnt really get that from most of the staff, none of them would smile or anything.Either way, I'd come back for a perfect burger. With my eyes much more wide open of course.
2016-10-05,3,Amazing live jazz music, but the bartender that night was very rude. He seemed to have a pleasant attitude toward his regular clientele, but as for myself and the guests who came with me, he made it painfully obvious that he didn't really want to serve us. 5-stars for the Food1-star for the rude bartender
2016-09-19,5,Get the "Our Steak" it is the best! We got a few filet mignons in our group and they were decent but didn't compare. The, "Our Steak" is a ribeye and I would normally always pick a Filet over Ribeye. This was one of the best steaks I have ever had. Little hole in the wall place but I think that adds to the experience. Located in a busy area in Hoboken it was a nice escape.
2016-09-19,4,Filet mignon sandwich all the way! The sandwich was delicious. The garlic bread was also really good, although a tad too burnt for my liking. I know people like things well done, although I do not. Flavor was good. They have a small selection of draft beers, but for the price of the steak sandwich (12.95) it's worth going here if you're in the mood for an affordable meal. The service was not the best. There was only 1 other table besides us (we went last night between 830-930) and the waiter didn't bring us plates with the bread, got my order wrong, and didn't even come over to ask how our food was. 4 stars/5.
2016-09-05,4,It's been a while since I have been here but enjoyed my lunch. I had the steak and ribs, plus a cold beer, you can't go wrong. I will be back again.
2016-09-01,4,Up until last week I hadn't been to Arthur's in years, but not much has changed since the last time I was there.  Same tables and chairs with that red and white table cloths.  We had a couple of people staying with us over the weekend that were from out of town and took them there for a bite to eat.  Service was speedy and food was really tasty (everyone got a burger), but I've had better as far as burgers go.  The meat was also a little more on the rare side (I had asked for a medium rare) although the portion sizes were very generous.  I also wanted to change a few things around on the burger and I could only add things to it, not remove anything which seems a little silly, but it was fine.  All in all it was a pretty nice experience.
2016-08-10,5,Had the surf n turf. My filet was delicious  and the nachos were just perfect  I would def go back again
2016-08-08,4,Old timey feel with the tablecloths. The steak is great!!!
2016-08-05,4,Steak is like everyone says really great!I gave it 4 stars only cause the steak was amazing except there was a little charcoal flavor I guess you could say burnt taste on the edges other then that I ate my whole OUR STEAK PLATE! My potatoes were very sloppy and didn't have much flavor. But The BREAD is definitely a must HAVE!!!!!!!  I also wish the server that had our table was a little quicker. I did keep in mind she had two huge tables but you still should be able to handle it better.
2016-07-30,4,Been here a few times and it has always been good. I have brought different friends and each one of them love it just as much as i do. I usually order the calamari's as a start and then the bbq ribs. The ribs are cooked well that the meat easily slides off the bone. It comes with potatoes as a side which i usually substitute for french fries but this time i didn't and it was really good. It was the waiter named Sebastian who was kind enough to bring some to try before i made my decision. He was also great and always making sure we had refills for our drinks. My friend had order a steak and enjoyed it as well. The place is nice and is right on the main street in hoboken so you are right around all the other stores. The manager was also very nice making sure we had a good experience.
2016-07-29,5,First off let me say I have a special love for old school kinda joints, nothing fancy, the star is the food. We sat down and had no idea but Thursday's is a prefixed dinner option for 2 for $50 which includes an appetizer, 2 entrees, and a complimentary drink for each guest. Sold. We started with the bacon appetizer with a apple and jalapeño chutney. Wow was that delicious. Not the best steakhouse bacon I've had but still, very meaty, crispy, very very good start. We each got the "our steak" which was $8 supplement each, it's a 24 ounce massive chunk of beef. Absolutely delicious, I don't believe it was a certified prime cut but it was massive, perfect Med Rare as requested. It was a bit fatty but fat adds flavor so I never mind. It was very tender juicy and succulent, perfectly seasoned. It came with some of the best potatoes I've had, might have been cooked in same pan as steak and was very flavorful. We added classic steakhouse side of asparagus.Overall, loved the old school feel and the food was up to par, for a far less price than the steakhouse staples. I cannot wait to go back!
2016-07-27,5,My boyfriend and I come here all the time! It is literally our favorite place as the food is just amazing. Garlic bread is sprinkled with Parmesan cheese which adds a great kick. Calamari is probably the best calamri I have ever had and of course lets not forget their traditional rib-eye. It is so big it is enough for two people (or order two and take the rest home because you DO NOT want a steak this good to go to waste) and the juicy and tenderness is just unreal. One of the best steak houses hands down! ALSO, if you're a sangria drinker like me you will not be disappointed. HIGHLY RECOMMEND and I will continue to come back.
2016-07-22,4,For my first time in arthurs. The loaded nachos were really good and very filling..it was well worth the price with the quantity..will be back to try more
2016-06-20,4,Arthur's tavern has been around for a very long time and it has managed to stay consistent.  When we arrived the bartender was working the bar as well as the tables, which hurts the customers service at the tables.  So we order the steak for 4 and it was perfectly cooked not to fatty. The home fries were very good as well. So overall the food was good,  but the  service at the table was lacking.  No fault of the waitress, she was trying her best.   That one is on management...
2016-05-23,5,I came here with a large group of around 15 people for dinner. They actually had a private room set up for us with one long table, which was a really pleasant surprise. The staff took our drink orders quickly and got us started, as well as bringing out pitchers of the beers for us.Onto the food. For appetizers, we got the nachos, calamari, and garlic bread. The garlic bread was my favorite - came out in foil piping hot and extremely tasty. The calamari was fried nicely and the nachos were stacked. For the main, I got Filet Mignon, which was bacon wrapped and topped with a brandy-wine mushroom sauce. It was cooked just right, flavorful, tender, and the sauce did not overpower the steak in any way.Overall, the price was right and I was really happy with the meal. I definitely think that I'd return.
2016-05-06,4,Steaks - MPHH! So juicy and delicious. Very well cooked, just wish they had a little more flavor (I like my steaks packed with more spices so I don't have to use A1). But still very good. I've gotten the 24 oz "Our Steak" (and devoured it all in a sitting, they didn't think I could do it), as well as the 16 oz NY Sirloin, both great choices. If you order the filet mignon, be wary that you won't be getting as much.Do yourself a favor and get two of the garlic bread - not because it come in a small portion but just because it's that good! Their garlic bread was probably one of the best I've had! Crisp on the outside, so soft and flavorful on the inside. And they wrap it in foil so it stays warm! I could eat it for days if I didn't feel like my arteries would get clogged.The sides were average - nothing special. Their onions, for example, were kind of soggy, lacking any crunch while also not being cooked to a good point of caramelization. I just think they could step it up.Service is friendly but not super attentive. The restaurant is moderately large (a couple different rooms) for places in Hoboken, and the servers aren't always nearby. It's never been very busy or bustling when I've been here, but it can still be kind of hard to find your server - when you need her, you kind of just have to wait for them to come around again.This is a very casual place - low key and old school kind of feel with plastic red and white checkered tablecloths over wooden tables. Nothing fancy at all - you're coming for the food.Tldr; The steaks here are fantastic, and the garlic bread!!! Highly recommended.
2016-04-26,4,Our last night in NJ we enjoyed dinner here waitress was cool she was informative made suggestions. I had steak which was perfect. My partner had ribs they were good.
2016-04-23,2,Not what it used to be and to top it off, got harassed by a mouse while I was dining. I had a sudden craving for steak and a lot of time so I decided to take the wife and kid to Arthurs Tavern for old times sake. My wife and I used to frequent this place when the huge slab of "our steak" was very affordable at roughly $15. They used to give you complimentary pickles and pickled hot peppers with a side of cole slaw. The price has now doubled, they don't give you anything complimentary anymore. The service dragged their feet and there was a mouse that really wanted to join us for dinner. Not what it used to be and I now regret the 30 mile ride I took for old times sake. The staff did take off my appetizers when I pointed out the mouse to them. The food was still decent. Too bad...
2016-04-20,4,MOnday Night BURGERS!!!! OMg sooooo good & totally delish and sooo very cheap for the Hoboken area. Get the classic margarita and you're all set!
2016-03-27,5,Great workers and awesome food. Has an old school vibe to it, sort of a soprano feeling. Everyone was satisfied with what they ordered. I had the filet mignon with salmon, amazing. Great flavor.
2016-03-18,1,Well- sadly - I came back. This is my 4th review of Arthur's. Damn I am a sucker punishment. Over 12 years I've wanted to love this place. Such sweet family run peeps. I just wish they had non grade F meat on allllllll levels. I've had the sirloin the filet the filet sandwich and the much acclaimed prime rib (which is a solid piece of marble warmed up) awful meat. So once again I will please beg Arthur's !!!! Plead! Buy better meat -- it's such bad quality I wanna cry. I had the pastrami sandwich ! The best part was the bread cheese and cold slaw .. Almost broke a tooth on the pastrami it was so fatty and had .. I'm just confused at the poor level of meat they offer .. But love the workers so nice all the girls and others .. I think they r also embarrassed at how poor it is - like when someone eats none of it ? (Oh and God forbid the take It back or off check -- hoho never) ..
2016-03-12,5,Best steak I ever had. Honestly for its price it's a very good deal. Very good portion. I was so stuffed  I couldn't walk. The char on the steak...amazing. Perfect crunchy char on the outside and juicy medium rare perfectly made on the inside. You cant get anywhere else. Of course don't forget to order the famous arthurs garlic bread....delicious! I try you steak lovers! Come check this place out.
2016-03-10,1,We 'ate' here last night as a party of 5. Our waitress clearly had an issue with us eating here, we're not quite sure why. She managed to get our drinks mixed up, then when she was supposed to bring over an extra coke, brought over 2 instead of 1. This wasn't the bad part though. We were told the sirloin came with fries but we got potatoes instead, when one of us said that we still wanted the fries, we were told 'well you should have said that then' as she walked away. The food was awful, the potatoes had far too much salt. The french onion soup however, was lovely. The waitress then proceeded to come back to our table and tell us how many boxes we needed to pack our food- we hadn't even finished eating. Had someone else served us, we would have at least asked for some of our experience to be rectified but with this waitress we just couldn't wait to get out. Absolutely disgusting customer service at a time when your restaurant wasn't even busy- waste of time and money.
2016-03-05,3,I went to this steakhouse because my Dad told me about coming here 20 plus years ago with friends. He said the steaks were a good value and the atmosphere was nice. I can agree with him on thing - it was a nice atmosphere but not so much on the steak. I heard they changed ownership at some point. Maybe this is the reason for the lackluster steak
2016-02-17,3,Solid middle-of-the-road steakhouse.   Good place to grab a beer and a steak, no frills.
2016-02-09,5,We've (my husband John and I) have been eating at Arthur's for over 10 years. We go for each other birthdays and on NYE. The garlic bread is wonderful, the junior sirloins are well-prepared and the portions are definitely filling. The place is festive in its design and ambiance and doesn't require TVs to provide atmosphere (although they have them). We enjoy our pints of Guinness and the Chocolate Mousse cake they have. Lastly, in spite of its large size, the staff are friendly and efficient. Kudos to Arthur's.
2016-01-27,4,This is a classic American steakhouse and is one of the best steaks for your money that I've ever had. Expect to eat a big hearty piece of meat when you go here. The "our steak" comes in at a huge 24 oz which is really enough for two to share. Plus they have pickles and peppers to snack on while you wait for your meal. The atmosphere is old but very nice and clean. Besides the steak Arthur's also has a full service bar which is great. Overall a really good steak huge portions good quality meat and always cooked to perfection. So worth the drive to Hoboken.
2016-01-26,1,Wow $50 for one of the worst meals of my life. So many things in retrospect I could buy for $50. So not coming here ever again. My husband wanted steak. I was not that hungry. I went since he wanted steak. He ordered salmon rare (while he makes the best anywhere) with veggies and substituted potatoes for rice. He also got a wedge salad soaked in dressing and cheese and a beer. He liked his salad. I could see he didn't care for the salmon. I tasted it. The salmon tasted like raw chewy badness with a sweet orange marinade...horrible. And I just had a tiny bite and nearly spit it out it was so terrible.  I ordered a side of mashed potatoes and a salad (that cost $8 and looked so small, wilted, and overly dressed and unappetizing that I did not even try it). It looked so unappetizing. Nor did he, and he loves any greens. My mashed potatoes were delicious as they were buttery and well salted. His fingerling potatoes quite bad and his veggies the frozen kind...basically nothing to write home about. It was the worst meal of my life (minus the mashed potatoe side) for $50 and no steak!!! What the hell?? This is robbery.
2016-01-26,5,Arrive and sit at simple small table with simple chairs, no  enormous booths.  The partons all seem like they want to be there and the atmosphere is funny, positive, energetic, classy and party like!  My kind of place.  While you wait for your food, 15-20 min, they bring you stainless steel bowls of sauerkraut, pickles, cherry peppers, and bread/butter if you ask.  Plenty of good selections of beer although I feel that a good British selection from Theakston Brewery would be a definite PLUS to their menu!  The steak is usually what everyone orders.  All the other menu items, sandwiches, salads, club sandwiches, fries are all excellent. The 24 oz. steak comes cooked the way you love it with sautéed wheel potatoes.  I have never had a bad steak at Arthur's. I have sent back a fatty one, but they smiled and made good on it and brought me a more lean steak. It is thick and juicy and what ever secret they use to season it with, I want the recipe, but in the same way  I have to respect them and I DON""T want to know! That would spoil it and I could never duplicate it at home anyhow.  Especially the fun atmosphere!  RECOMMENDATION.  Before coming here, skip lunch and have a light breakfast.  That way you are good and hungry!  Men, play some football or soccer and get all hungry for meat and potatoes and a few beers to kick back.  Women, skip lunch etc.  Great place, price is right,  miss it, wish Arthur's was in St Petersburg Florida with the rest of my family.  God Bless this place ! Many fond fond memories since 1995 ! !
2016-01-16,4,Arthur's is a really nice spot to get dinner in Hoboken, their prices are very reasonable and their food is spot on.I've been here several times with my friends and no one has had a poor experience here, their drinks are good, and food is excellent.Very good French onion soup and their steak sandwich (filet mignon) I think, is really excellent. Fair prices and good service, also, it gets crowded but they have plenty of room, I don't think I've ever had a wait during any of my visits.While they may not get as crowded as one republik, this place offers nice variety that is often overlooked in Hoboken, check it out.
2016-01-11,1,Let me begin by making this important statement,THIS PLACE IS ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!I made the mistake of visiting this dump last Thursday while in Hoboken.I was in the area with a few colleagues right around lunch time and we decided to check out Arthur's based on the recommendation of someone that was part of the group. Although he did say he had not gone there in years but he did remember that back then it was the place to go in Hoboken. So we all decided on Arthur's, When we arrived I immediately noticed that there was a weird smell in the air, it wasn't until I read another review that I figured out what the smell was, Mice droppings. Now that I think about it, it makes me want to THROW UP!Meanwhile back at the ranch we sit down and I also noticed that all the silverware was dirty, the place was extremely outdated but I again ignored the warning signs. We ordered appetizers, Additionally I and a colleague ordered Rib Eye sandwiches. 8hrs later I was at the emergency room with food poisoning, and coincidently so did my colleague. I went through sheer hell simply because I ignored the signs that were so evident. The NJ Health Dept should shut this place down before someone suffers a worse fate then what me and my colleague went through. If you find this a little difficult to believe then simply visit Arthur's yourself, walk in and take a whiff and you will quickly be reminded of my review. This place is GROSS. Being from NY you can appreciate the ABC rating systems that restaurants receive based on health inspections, full transparency since you have the ability to read the most recent inspections,NJ really needs thisP.S. This place should not even get 1 star!
2016-01-09,4,This place has a classic no frills steakhouse feel to it. Red and white plastic picnic tablecloths. Comfortable lighting and seating, very casual and laid back vibe. The signature cocktails taste like something my aunt would have whipped up in her kitchen and called it "masterpiece". Sorry, but some flavors just don't work well together. If you're gonna order a drink, stick with something you know. The bacon appetizer was also kind of disappointing. Didn't really like the orange marmalade glaze with a kick of pepper. But other people at my table enjoyed it. I still give this place 4 out of 5 stars. Their steak for 2 is huge 48oz marbled ribeye cooked to perfection. It's a pretty good value when you compare it to other steakhouses. Their signature potato side was superb. The staff is friendly, welcoming and attentive. They take pride in their restaurant, and had no problem offering a substitute for the signature cocktail that I really didn't like. Overall it was an enjoyable dining experience. I'd definitely go back.
2016-01-04,3,Big portions of good food, serving in a no-frills style, with reasonably priced wines & beers. The emphasis is on steaks and burgers here, although sandwiches, salads, and the occasional chicken and fish dish will show up. Salads and appetizers are generously sized, and are adequate to share, unless you happen to be starving.Service is friendly & fairly professional. Our server made a good effort to find out about safe gluten free options, despite there being no menu information on this.At one time, Arthurs made its mark on the NJ dining scene by offering big, tender steaks at cheap prices. With the recent spike in beef prices, you can't really say that dining here is the bargain it used to be, but you certainly won't leave hungry.The quality of the food is good but not great, as agreed upon by my three companions who had an Arthurs steak, an "Our burger", the salmon special and a steak sandwich. All were properly cooked, but nothing stood out in terms of flavor, special seasonings or preparation. Bring your appetite. Bring cash (preferably), and expect to get a good meal at a good price.
2016-01-03,4,Delicious. Had Lobster Bisque soup of the day. Salmon and Steak. Very good! Great service.
2016-01-02,1,What happened to this amazing place ??Went there with my dad for a nice afternoon stakes ..what a disaster..It seems like either they change ownership or I don't know how you go from an amazing statehouse to a diner ( sorry dinner ) grade stakes .I hope someone will take care of this place and return whoever was responsible for the amazing food they used to serve here .
2015-12-30,4,First time at the Hoboken location and apparently Arthur's has had a change of ownership or franchised now. Prefer the Morris Plains or New Brunswick locations that are more crowded and have a nicer atmosphere and slightly different menu including the wonderful cream spinach side. Still enjoyed the magnificent 24 ounce rib eye which I had to share and the delicious grilled potatoes. Our server was MIA most of the time and wasn't busy enough to warrant it. But truly a great steak!
2015-12-29,5,My favorite restaurant in Hoboken. One of the only old school places left in town. Great casual atmosphere and good place to bring the kids.  They have great burger specials on Mondays. Don't leave without ordering the nachos (and a fat bud lite)
2015-12-29,5,We have been to Arthur's multiple times now. The steaks are always cooked the way we order them and are wonderfully seasoned. The rib eye steak sandwich is fabulous. I have also had the ribs which are really good but I go to this place for steak at a reasonable price. Make sure you order the garlic bead---wow! The service is really good here; they are very attentive and do not desert you once you've been served. Great bartenders also! Lots of places in Hoboken but Arthur's stands out. We harm be made trips across the river in NY and have ended up eating at Arthur's on our way back to Jersey. Can't wait to go back!
2015-11-27,4,The best thing about this place is they understand "medium rare" for steaks. I like my steak really tender and juicy and they did it right.
2015-11-23,4,This is usually a place I go to if we are unsure where we want to go to dinner. I've been here with a large group of friends several times and also with just my boyfriend and me. Awesome burgers. They have pitchers of sangria. Nothing fancy but just a good place with good food. They are usually busy but have never had a problem getting in. They always seem to make room. Good place. I recommend.
2015-11-11,4,Perhaps the last old timey joint left in Hoboken.  You can almost imagine longshoremen from another era seated at the tables with the checkered table cloths.The burger - a juicy delicious masterpiece.The steak - a marvelous mouthwatering meat man-anza.It's not a highfalutin steakhouse.  It's everyman's steak joint.
2015-11-05,5,I heard this place is known for their steaks and burgers. I have to say, this place is great. I got the "our burger" and it was amazing. Our server was very kind and the wait was not long. I would definitely recommend this place!
2015-11-04,3,I have been going to arthur's since college (~10 yrs)... in New Brunswick when it was a lot cheaper. But it has always been the same great and reliable steak!  Always order end cut (less gristle), med/rare w/ some garlic bread and french onion soup... mMmM sometimes I go with the Reuben ooh sooo good!The Hoboken location is just as good as the New Brunswick location.
2015-11-03,5,Made my return today,have not been here since the original owners owned this establishment, i went on a tuesday before dinner so not so busy, was only one waitress for a few people that were there and i must say nothing has changed....steak is still juicy and cook correctly as i asked (medium well), and those potatoes that i couldnt get out my head are still the same with that great taste!....paid about 42 and change with a extra side of rice...im not really bitchy on price especially when you really get what you pay for....
2015-11-02,5,Found this place through a pub crawl and wound up just staying here because we had a great time. One of the workers in partticular was very helpful and polite. Thank you.
2015-10-20,4,It's been a long time since I've visited this old time favorite.  I was very happy to find out that they, finally, started taking reservations and I don't have to plan on a 40 minute wait.  We were seated promptly.We were surprised not to see pickled vegetables on the table, but when we asked the waitress, she said that it's now available on request.  As usually, their pickles are amazing.  French Onion soup was just as good.  My friend praised his Caesar Salad w/Steak.  But their special 24oz steak that my husband ordered did not look 24oz and was too salty.  So were the potatoes served with it.  I was also very surprised at the $31.95 price for the steak.  I don't think I was there THAT long ago.I had Tiramisu for desert and it was amazing.  Cappuccino was so, so; no froth and too much milk.  I don't remember what else we ordered, but it was good.  Over all we had a very nice time.  We were not rushed by the staff to get out and were able to carry on a nice leisurely conversation with friends we haven't seen in a while.
2015-10-19,3,3.5 Stars!We were here for dinner with our friend on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately. The place wasn't busy. We ordered the steak, the surf & turf, the filet mignon, & a pitcher of Sam Adams. The service was good. Our waitress were very polite. The steak, the filet mignon, they were good. They were incredibly tender! For the price, you get a good amount of food. The portion is definitely generous. Great value!
2015-10-17,4,After speaking to a hostess not too long ago, I've learned that Arthur's has been under new management. So, I'll make this review quick and as helpful as possible.* If you've come here for their world famous HUGE-ASS 42 oz steaks -- you'll be disappointed to find that it is off the menu. The "Arthur's Steak" is as close to the original as you'll get -- at a whopping 24 oz. Still delicious, but not as huge as before. The price however -- still the same. So that's points off for me.* Their garlic bread is an absolute banger AS ALWAYS (and smart by them for not removing it from the menu -- because people will riot). Order 2, because hot-damn...its amazing.* The french onion soup looks shmelted together but trust me the broth is like liquid heaven -- its cheesey goodness all around.* Not so much on tap but it's forgivable considering there's a long wine list -- even though this tavern doesnt scream wine time to me.------------------Overall this place would have gotten a 5 star review but some things seem to be a bit overpriced for what you get. Service is awesome.
2015-10-11,3,I love Hoboken too much to not like every single place in this city
2015-09-28,5,Came to get a steak watch the Rangers game . Had the Arthur's steak which is a ribsteak had it cooked rare . The French onion soup and the garlic bread . Steak came out cooked to  perfection  . The steak was so good . Tender ,  flavorful and  juicy . Tip - I spoon some of the French onion soup over the steak .  Garlic bread here is killer . Not a fan of the salad that comes with the meal .
2015-09-23,3,This place used to be better.I still go back when I'm craving their amazing garlic bread. Their garlic bread and chili are the 2 staples I will always order regardless of what else I'm having or who is with me. The place is very dated, but I guess that's part of their charm. I like that its super casual. Never saw mice, never saw ghosts (their bathroom is supposedly haunted). A bit pricey for what it is, and the service seems to be going downhill a bit.
2015-09-19,5,Came to Arthur's for a dinner party for a friends birthday. The food and service was phenomenal! I'd recommend the NY strip. Our server was named Brian and he was extremely polite and even cracked a few jokes. Overall, I will be def be coming back to Arthur's.
2015-09-14,4,A casual steakhouse to go. The steaks are a big too salty and overcooked though.Keep walking when entering. It's huuuuuge inside.
2015-08-27,4,Very casual dining at Arthur's and thats what I like about it. The steak is amazing. I have been coming here for years making the trip over the Hudson to spend some time in Hoboken. The decor is very old school with wood all around. However, it becomes a lil outdated with the red checkered table coverings. I guess its quicker to clean. So the staff is friendly but the wait for orders can be a lil slow. Funny thing its a hit or miss. I guess it depends who is waiting your tables. That put aside, the steak is awesome. The Arthur's steak is a 24oz steak  I think and it comes with potatoes. $30 for the order, but it is worth it. Omg is this so good. Also order their famous garlic bread. Delish. So while you wait for your order, they bring pickles and coleslaw. It is fresh and delicious. Great way to get you ready for your entree. The steak can be cooked to your liking. I like it a lil well. This steak dinner can easily be shared between 2 people, but most of my party have each gotten one order for themselves. So you can imagine how great the steak is. Ha. Definitely check out Arthur's. Their steak is out of this world. Plus you can always venture afterwards to the many bars and enjoy what Hoboken has to offer.
2015-08-25,4,I went there with my wife last Wednesday. My wife ordered the Arthur's fillet mingon it was okay not the best and I ordered the "our steak" and OMG it was the best steak I ate in my life, I still dream about him it's so goooood and definitely will go there soon again.
2015-08-18,4,Will always be going back for their ribeye.   Garlic bread is also good,.not that great but Good .  Our server Brian P. was super attentive,checking us every 7 min. Lol relax Brian,.your doing great buddy.
2015-08-17,3,I don't understand the hype...1. the menu is very limited2. the food is a ok (I might be a bit biased since I had a very weird allergic reaction all over my body)3. the peppers are the only thing that makes me want to come to this place, but now you need to ask for them and they give you once piece at a time.4. service is pretty terrible.5. worst salads i've ever tasted... I personally need a good salad to balance on the grease in the meat/sides...
2015-08-17,3,Came to Arthur's this past Saturday evening as first time guests. The ambiance is great with checkerboard table cloths setting the mood for a classic steakhouse. I started with the Raspberry Blush specialty cocktail that was incredibly sweet and tasted like fruit punch (not my cup of tea). We ordered the calamari for an appetizer which was a perfect starter. For entrees, my filet was incredibly tender and was served with delicious mashed potatoes. It was a very good steak and beat my expectations. The steak and cake was just as good, however, the crab cake was not flavorful and probably not the best menu item. Would recommend sticking to the steaks. Our only concern was after our entrees had been cleared it took 30 minutes for our server to come back to our table. We were dying for some espresso and dessert. But, the clock kept ticking and we could not get our servers attention - and we did not want to be rude. I never complain, but 30 minutes waiting around was a little bit of a night ruiner especially when we had arranged for plans after dinner. When the server finally came over and stared at us, we asked if we could please see a dessert menu and order after dinner drinks as well. I was very disappointed and would normally take the servers side if it was during dinner rush. Oh well, it happens. But overall was mediocre and probably won't be back again.
2015-08-11,5,Was a great experience overall! Had an exceptional waiter, great service and great food at a very reasonable price.Never heard of the place before today; was looking for a random place to go out with some friends I haven't seen in awhile and stumbled upon this. Given the location, I was expecting fairly high prices and small portions - quite the contrary. I got the arthurs special steak which turned out to be 28oz of heaven at a reasonable $31.Overall no complaints and would definitely go back.
2015-08-09,2,I really wanted to like Arthur's as it is a part of Hoboken's history.Decor is extremely date, as in they might have had the same table clothes from 30 years ago.  There was a weird smell in the air, they need to thoroughly clean the place. My boyfriend ordered the burger and I ordered the calamari since I was not hungry.  We were both underwhelmed and left with a feeling of wanting more.The waiter was nice and seemed like a real easy person to talk to.
2015-07-28,1,Oh gosh... where to begin. The first thing you notice when you walk in is the odor. It's unmistakable: the smell of grime, mold, and mice. Mice droppings, to be more specific. Our suspicions were verified when we noticed a tiny mouse milling around the table next to us. Yes, you read this right. A mouse... inside the dining hall. Not even skirting around, but he was very comfortable milling around the table unscathed by the humans around him. We notified the manager who expressed an ersatz concern, and identified the hole that lead to the street where the vermin may have entered. You should have identified that eons ago, and not in front of us.Going to the restrooms, you pass the kitchen. And all I can say is, that not even developing countries would approve of its cleanliness. It was really shocking. I've been in JC for 10 years, and nothing shocked me so badly than my experience here. If you want to risk your health to eat steaks in Hoboken, go here. This is an absolutely filthy restaurant.Be warned. Don't believe me? Just walk in, don't even order anything. Let the odor speak for itself.
2015-07-28,2,I went there yesterday for lunch with friend.   Sat in back area because the front smelled of harsh cleaning products.  There were only two tables in the back that our waitress was serving. Ordered drinks, burger, and bowl of chili with onions.  For us hoboken residents, one of the reasons we have gone to Arthurs is that they start you out with pickles and cole slaw on the table.  Well now they charge for the cole slaw.   I had to remind the waitress after 15 minutes to bring the drinks over.   i then get my bowl of chili with wrong toppings.   All in all i wouldn't go back to this place since there are many many other choices in the neighborhood.
2015-07-21,1,Done with this place. No pickles or slaw. Prices are up $10 for the steak. Can't afford it anymore!My experience and nostalgic feeling for this place are not here!
2015-07-17,4,Came back for a retirement party. Everything was excellent. We had one server taking care of 20 of us, and he did an excellent job.  The ribeye was tasty and cooked perfectly. The side of home frie-like potatoes were excellent. Definitely a big improvement over my last visit here.
2015-07-06,4,Great food and great deals for the amount of steak you can get!Went here for my mother's birthday and our waitress- Vera was beyond amazing!! She was able to help us with our food selections which completely were amazing.If you come here, ask for Vera! She'll take good care of you!
2015-06-19,5,I had a party for over 70 friends. The dinner was delicious and the service was perfect. Everyone had a great time! Thank you Arthur's staff!!!
2015-06-14,5,We had brunch here last Sunday. Everything was exceptional and cooked to perfection! We were in a rush since we had a graduation party to attend later that afternoon and our waitress was super accommodating. Great food, great service, can't ask for more :)
2015-06-09,5,Worth the 20 minute drive and tough parking. Always great quality steaks! We always get the filet mignon. The calamari and the two sauces it comes with is always delicious too.
2015-06-06,4,I vacillated between three an four stars, but will round up on this one.  Came here on a Monday night and got a burger (it's burger night).  The burger was tasty and well prepared and the French fries, which I shouldn't have eaten, were unusually good so I ate more than I should have.  We also split a tomato and avocado salad that was really, really good.  The food was solidly good and the service friendly.  I've heard from others that the steaks are good, but I didn't try them so can't really speak to them.  They have a good variety of burgers, salads, and entrees on the menu, so there should be something to please everyone.
2015-05-25,3,This place is really famous for their steak - a huge piece of untrimmed rib eye that is big enough for two people to share plus leftovers if you are ordering anything else in addition to your steak. Hubby and I ordered the calamari starter, french onion soup and Arthur's steak. The place was empty at 6:30pm on a Friday night so we sat outside on the patio area for some good ol fashioned people watching. Calamari - Pretty standard. Good but not nothing to write home about.French onion soup - Piping hot, gooey and delicious. They definitely don't skimp on the cheese. After about the fourth bite, it got a little bit too rich, if you know what I mean. Steak - Yelpers aren't kidding when they said this steak is huge. Between the two of us, we only finished about 2/3 and even that was a struggle. It comes with a side (either french fries, griddle fries or a baked potato) and a couple of hot peppers. The steak was good, but I definitely wouldn't consider it to be "steakhouse" quality. It came out medium (we ordered it medium rare) but had a pretty tasty char on the outside which we both enjoyed. Total bill came out to about $70 which I think is expensive for Hoboken, especially considering the fact that we shared an entree. Overall, the place was just A-ok, so for $70, I would rather go someplace else.
2015-05-21,5,went in for my son's graduation yesterday. 14 family members from all over.  great garlic bread, cold beer and a great atmosphere.  wonderful rib eye steaks and terrific service. don't miss this classic
2015-05-15,4,Steaks are the bomb.  A couple of people told me about this place and tonight I finally experienced it myself.  No-frills fantastic steak at a good price point.   If you are a fan of tasty, succulent, voluminous meat....as I am....you will love this place.   Go and gorge.ii
2015-05-10,3,We called ahead & made reservations, which weren't needed on a Saturday night. We were seated right away at a table with a red & white checkered table cloth. The casual decor was a little dated, but clean. Our  server was very attentive. We shared the calamari & French onion soup - both were yummy. My husband got the ribeye & it was really good! I went with the filet. It was good, not great. Cooked right, but the sauce & mashed potatoes seemed almost like they came from a can or box. Overall, great service & generous portions of food.
2015-05-09,3,My friends and I were looking for a place on Washington Street with outdoor seating and a deal with drinks. We stumbled upon Arthur's, which was offering $20 for a pitcher of margaritas. We asked a server if we could sit at a table outside for drinks and he told us we could sit anywhere we like.A few minutes later, the same waiter came back and we place an order for a pitcher of frozen mango margarita. This is when the waiter informs us that patrons using the outdoor seating must at least order an appetizer, or they have to sit inside at the bar. Initially, I was slightly annoyed that we weren't told this when we were first seated, but we decide to stay and order some garlic bread for the table.Best impromptu appetizer ever! Even though we weren't very hungry, we couldn't stop eating the garlic bread. While the frozen mango margarita was drinkable, it was nothing to rave about; it had to be continuously mixed to keep its consistency. The service wasn't the most attentive either; the waiter didn't check in with us for the rest of the night and we had to flag him down to get our check. I'd probably come back for another try next time I'm in Hoboken.
2015-05-09,3,My boyfriend suggested that we come here for dinner yesterday. Based on some of the negative reviews I was quite skeptical but nonetheless I went along with the plan. On our way to the restaurant I asked him about the change in ownership several years ago that I'd read about. He informed me that there had been some changes as far as no complimentary pickles or slaw but he insisted that the food remained consistently good. Upon walking into the restaurant there was definitely a strange odor to the joint. There was no way that I could have eaten inside so I suggested that we dine outside. Thankfully it was a beautiful spring evening. The outside seating along Washington Street was pleasant and offered a great opportunity for people watching on a busy Friday night. Now let's get to the food...we ordered the ultimate bacon for an appetizer. "Thick cut applewood bacon". I'm not quite sure what qualifies as "thick cut" but this bacon was packed full of delicious flavor. For entrees I ordered the Steak and Cake-- crab cake ($29) while my boyfriend ordered the "Our Streak" ($31). Both dishes came with potatoes. My Steak and Cake was cooked to perfection! The chipotle aioli on top of the crab cake really kicked the flavor up a notch. My steak was seasoned well and was nicely tender. The potatoes were a nice accompaniment to the steak as well. The service was fairly attentive and speedy. No real complaints there. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Arthur's Tavern. The food was delicious and satisfying however the smell inside definitely needs to be taken care of before I would consider eating indoors. I would return as long as there are seats outside.
2015-05-09,3,I'm torn about this place.  On the one hand, ambiance is great (in the front, it's more of that old Italian vibe and in the huge backroom, more laidback, sports bar).  On the other hand, the food is just not that great.  Steaks are okay (don't take steak afficionados here) and the sizes are definitely on the large size.  But beyond that, nothing is really memorable.This is a great place if you need a place that fits a large amount of people and because it's large, you won't feel hurried.   Good place to also watch games as the back room has several large screen TVs. The nachos are huge and could easily feed 2 hungry people (without needing entrees).  Lastly, pass on the crabcakes.  They're just not that good.
2015-04-20,5,Come here for the amazing rib eye.  It's not trimmed and it's better than most of the rib eye steaks that I have had across the pond for two or three times the price. No frills decor and decent service.  The quality is consistent.  The french onion soup is worth considering if you like french onion soup. Arthur's in an oasis.
2015-04-18,1,The Garlic Bread, Alcohol, Potatoes and Pickles were decent but this has to be the most disgusting Steak (both Fillet Minion and Ribeye I've ever had in my life. It's burn all overt but for a Medium Rare, it was chewy to the point I was taking at least 20 bites before devouring the actual meat.What an embarrassment to have had my cousin drive from NY just to come to a joke of a steakhouse. It was not worth the $150 for 4 people, even if you paid me $1000 just to eat it, I wouldn't do it. I would have been much happier going to a Long Horn, Outback, even as far as Harrahs Waterfront Buffet for a nice beef brisket or prime rib. Hell I would have even went to a McDonalds for superior tasting "beef" in their burgers than this atrocious experience. I haven't cursed so much in years about a food place, it was so disgusting.
2015-04-09,1,I can't comment on the food because after having a mouse run past my feet that's all I can remember of the restaurant.  I get that rodents are part of city life and I'm sure there are pests in other restaurants as well, but actually seeing it run past me makes me wonder just how disgusting the kitchen must be to have mice running around while the restaurant is open.  Ugh never coming back.
2015-04-06,1,I went here for my birthday  its been years since I been here I heard it had changed owner it will be my last time going there food was hard as a rock my Steak and my sons Ribs I wasn't satisfied with there 10 items that they have on there menu who ever made up there prices has gone mad a cheese burger is the same price as a tenderloin Really???????????????????????
2015-03-31,5,great steak I love this place they have the best steak ever I take all my friend to eat there u need to come hungry the steak is big and teats like a real good meet
2015-03-31,5,I love Arthur.  Have been a regular here for twenty years or so. This is the one place where I order the same stuff every time.  Garlic Bread, a two pound Stake with their griddle potatoes, one little of coke.  If I am up for soup, the French onion soup. This place is the spot. I am normally so full after I finish eating that it takes me hours to get back to the car.  I can eat that stake and potatoes all day every day. I want to bathe in that stake.  Oh my God.
2015-03-15,4,It is what it is. I really love their stakes and I love the surf and turf too. Only thing that irked me is that it's needs and upgrade in decor and needs to work on cleanliness, I had to ask the waitress to wipe the crumbs off the table cloth. But other than that good food here.
2015-02-19,3,I was craving a burger and I automatically thought of Arthur's!  The burgers are absolutely scrumptious - not fatty and not greasy and they have burger specials on Monday! The waiter was sooo nice and friendly!
2015-02-09,5,I'm giving Arthur's 5 stars for the burger. The flavor was incredible. The fries are good too. The service was good and the food came out very quickly so we were pleased.
2015-02-02,4,My husband, two kiddos and I stopped in here around 4:45 on Superbowl Sunday.  We were seated immediately.  Our waitress, Kate, was a sweetheart.  Short and sweet:Garlic bread- AWESOME.  Soft, buttery, salty, perfect.French Onion Soup- I loved it.  I didn't get very many onions but the broth was savory, the cheese was gooey and it was great.One of the kids got their chicken finger basket and little Miss Picky ate it all up.Other kid got a bacon cheeseburger with fries and it too was approved of. Sauteed Mushrooms- these were so-so.  They were very simply sautéed and I thought they could use a little salt.  Otherwise, not bad.  They were better at home the next day sautéed with some Worcestershire sauce ;)The Griddle potatoes that accompanied are steaks were also awesome.  They were pleasantly greasy, crispy, with pieces of caramelized onion from the flat top.  YUM.The steak....yes, it's big.  But that's about it.  It was nicely charred but otherwise lacked flavor.  This, too, was better the next day reheated in a cast iron pan with seasoned salt and Worcestershire sauce. LOL The portions were generous (obviously, since husband and I had enough for a full meal the next day).  The tab:  4 soft drinks, 2 French onion soups, a garlic bread, a kid's chicken basket, a cheeseburger and two huge steaks came to, before tip, $120.  Not bad at all considering we got two meals out of it.  I think I would go back...just wouldn't get the steak.
2015-01-22,4,If you are craving a steak, a large meaty steak and potatoes and onions all dripping with grease, then this is your place. Yes, you won't be losing any weight here and will have to do penance the next day for the fat content you have just gorged on, but once in a while, this is just what you need. Portions are large, so split a steak with someone and save your heart. It's more than enough, and I think there is a plate sharing charge tho. I used to go here all the time, but had to take a break from all the good stuff here. Root beer is really good with steak, potatoes and onions. Mmmm. Might have to make a visit soon. Good family place too with stuff for kids to do. Haven't been here recently so not sure what the bad reviews are about.
2015-01-14,5,Been going to this place for over 10 yrs. Steak is good. French Onion Soup is excellent.
2015-01-11,2,What a disappointment. We stopped by for lunch expecting the "old" Arthur's. We were sorely disappointed. Not sure if it was as a result of the sales of this restaurant from the Morris Plains owners but it is just not the same. The service was great but the food fell short. We asked to taste both the white and red sangria before we bought a carafe, this is standard practice in most restaurants. They said if we tasted it the would need to charge us for a glass of each, really? We ordered filet mignon and they brought us a sandwich.  They don't have the great turkey sandwich they used to have and most importantly ..... There were no pickles on the table. Anyway, we won't be back, there are tons of other restaurants in the area for us to explore.
2015-01-10,5,Went back today and ordered the exact same thing and everything was up to par, same as last time everything was delicious. This place is truly a gem.
2015-01-08,4,Great steak with a crusted exterior and perfect medium on the inside. The garlic bread was soft, and tasty. Had the loaded nachos that were great for sharing. Will be back again.
2014-12-31,2,Went here the other night.  I ordered a medium "our steak" and got a well steak.  That was about the only thing ''well'' about it.  It was extremely average.Would rather pay the extra $ and go to old homestead or another place.
2014-12-31,3,If the smell of steak hits you two blocks away and lures you in off the street, it's gotta be good.   This is the kind of place that you dad and boyfriend likes.  No frills decor, just old school red and white plaid plastic tableclothes and good food.  The portions are large so it is not a place to mind your waistline.  What's on the menu, steak!  There are a number of sides to go with steak to choose from and also plenty of appetizers.  Go with the French onion soup or mozzarella and tomato salad.  The garlic bread is also very popular.  Only three stars because I think that can do better job cleaning.  Always sticky tableclothes and spotty place setting.  Service is prompt.  Remember not fine dining .
2014-12-12,4,Good place to get a tasty steak in Hoboken. Exactly what you would expect
2014-12-03,2,Came here to shoot the shit with a buddy and have dinner. The food was alright, got the porterhouse with skillet potatoes (medium rare)...The waitress was super awkward, but in a lovable way, but Arthur's.....ya did me dirty, had to turn in early to rest upon a throne of porcelain. Thanks, I could have met my future wife tonight, but here I am on yelp talking about the current assault being carried out on my GI tract.....
2014-11-22,3,Do you want to eat a steak that's bigger than your head? Are you in the Hoboken area? Do you carry a pair of sweat pants with you? Or even better, wear one all the time?If you answered yes to all of the questions, you might want to check out Arthur's Tavern. They have a huge steak on the menu that's weighs in at around 48 oz. That's a pretty hefty piece of meat for $50 (not too bad). They do have plenty of other items on the menu (other steaks, burgers, Italian dishes, etc) if you don't feel like eating your final meal before hibernation.The decor inside is definitely old school, old America bar-like with what feels like a step back into time. It's not a big place so I wouldn't take a party larger than 4 here unless you like to get close and personal (and perhaps rowdy).With all this charm and decent offering, the steak, though enormous, was not quite flavorful enough and a bit dry for medium rare. There was a good amount of fat on the steak but the marbling probably wasn't all that great (hence mid-lower quality cut) because the flavor of the steak was missing. I'm not the type to use anything other than some salt on a good piece of ribeye, but I was very tempted to use some of the A1 sauce they had at the table. Real shame because I wanted to love this place to death (literally).But if you just want to gorge on meat and beer, then by all means, I recommend this place. If you're looking for a better cut of steak, I'd suggest going somewhere else, paying more, for a much smaller piece.Service was friendly and helpful. Parking: Limited paid streetPrice: $15+ for regular / $50 for the BAMF (Big Ass Mother Fucker)Wait: 15 mins after ordering
2014-11-19,4,Glad to see they're still around.  Before my husband and I moved from NJ, Arthur's Tavern was a frequent spot.  Of course that was about 15 yrs ago, and prices were much cheaper, but all around it was a favorite spot of ours.  We'd always split a steak, and each get a salad, and a loaf of garlic bread.  We sent a lot of business their way.  When I come back for a visit, I'll definitely treat myself and a friend for dinner at Arthurs.  Now my mouth is watering.  Wish you have some down here in Florida.
2014-11-12,3,Been coming here for over 10 years now.  Food is very consistent.  This is not where you come for the fillet, it's straight up fatty rib eye.  Prices are very reasonable, however they did raise the prices.  Overall you will definitely get your money's worth.  The hash is amazing.  Sometimes the waiters and waitresses are a little spacey and can mess up your food.  Enjoy!!!
2014-10-18,3,Decent food at a fair price - just be sure to eat outside, if you can. The entrance smells like cat pee.
2014-10-18,4,My go to steak place!  Not necessarily the best steak I've ever had but its pretty darn good all the time.
2014-10-11,3,On one hand: It's an institution in Hoboken but they need to step it up. Steak can be very grisly and place looks and smells like it has not been cleaned since the day they opened. On the other hand: I love old school restaurants and there aren't many left in town.  So what keeps me coming back? - Delicious potatoes are cooked in beef drippings.- Excellent pickled veggies are no longer free but get them because they cut through all the fat.- Burger is top notch. I prefer it nowadays to their steak - especially when it is rare and topped with blue cheese. They have hygiene issues but I tell myself they are a steakhouse so their burger mix should have high enough turnover to be fresh. - Have a sweet tooth? Their chocolate mousse cake is always fresh, has good chocolate flavor and I love the chocolate crumb crust. When I need a chocolate fix I sometimes order a slice on its own.Definitely worth a try especially if you are in the mood for an old school experience without having to drop a hundred bucks on a steak.
2014-10-11,2,Honestly this will be short nothing great about this place very average had there biggest steak nothing crazy just a bland piece of meat the best thing was French onion soup dam I'm really having bad experiences in Hoboken :(
2014-10-06,3,Nothing fancy, but it's a good place to get a nice, big steak when the mood strikes. We ordered the garlic bread, french onion soup, and split the Arthur's Steak. The bread was okay. It was an entire loaf so it was way too much for 2 people but it was kind of soggy so I wasn't that impressed. I thought the soup was good; again- nothing fancy. I liked the steak a lot even though we ordered it medium and it came out bloody red. The waiter apologized and brought it back cooked perfectly the next time. It was very tasty and huge. I probably wouldn't go back any time soon but it wasn't bad!
2014-10-05,1,Cockroaches!!!My wife Katie and I were introduced to your restaurant about 6 years ago by my cousin. We came quite often as we loved the 48 oz steak, the potatoes & your unbelievable garlic bread.  We would come every two months. However we moved out of the area at the same time as the ownership changed and we recently moved back here. We recently came back with the same cousins that introduced us to your restaurant 6 years ago.  The garlic bread was still as good as was the steak. Your potatoes however were third rate. But the potatoes were not the bad news. As we were leaving we noticed how utterly filthy your kitchen is with scraps of food all over the floor. Your floors are also filthy and your KITCHEN is a health hazard.  Your kitchen & floors are not only the only bad news. As we were leaving we saw two cockroaches crawling along the kitchen door frame.  Hello, what have you done to a great Hoboken Restaurant.Whoever the new owner is, you should know that you are rapidly losing your value as we and others I am sure will never be back!!!
2014-10-03,4,Came here a few weeks ago and it was great. Not sure what all of the recent bad reviews are about! The service was great, the food came out in a timely matter and the steak was delicious. I split the 48oz steak and it was more than enough for the two of us! The broccoli on the side was cooked and season well and was a great addition to the steak. Back to the steak. Juicy, tender meat on the bone. Definitely great for a date night. At first, you walk in and think this place is tiny. But you walk past the first room through a small hallway there are two more bars and rooms with even more tables. They have some TVs so it is more of a casual bar but not too casual. A friend ordered the burger with Swiss cheese and mushrooms and he said it was great. It was a good meal and I would definitely come back.
2014-09-29,1,I was here for a birthday party some years back but I remember coming in late and not actually eating. Just recently was invited back by same person to this place, so lets just start with the fact that it appears dirty. My shoes were sticking to the floor.We were a large party, guess what the place gave us one waitress. What gives??Poor lady even if she wanted to provide good service could not do it alone for about 20 people. Now the food, lets just say steak that my husband ordered was not cooked right and it had to be sent  back and what returned was just a slab of low quality meat.I ordered fish cakes, what a mistake just over salted God knows what concoction.This is not a steak a house at all, I dont even know what it qualifies to be.Do your self a favor and skip it.
2014-09-21,3,OK I'll make this review short and to the point. This was one of my favorite Hoboken restaurants and a great place for a good, inexpensive ribeye (only $26 for a chargrilled 20 oz boneless). The fried calamari is pretty good as well but while I was dining one night I saw a little mouse run across the floor. Enjoy at your own risk
2014-09-16,4,Haters gonna hate. This place still has it. It may have switched ownership/management/menus, I'm not even exactly sure, but the 24 oz. steak is still there. And yes, it's still well under $30 for it. Great value, in my opinion.Oh, you're looking for the pickles they usually give you when you sit down? Just ask, they still give them for free.Expect a charred steak too. The cut is thick and if you order Medium Rare, don't worry, it'll be red in there. If you can't deal with charring, then maybe this steak might not be for you. Comes with delicious potatoes too.French Onion Soup has copious amounts of cheese on it and the Garlic Bread is as expected as well.Parking sucks though.
2014-09-14,1,Once upon a time this steak joint was worth every risk of an ER visit with their 24 and 48 ounce varieties. Once upon a time my steak palette apparently wasn't fully developed either. When I first made NJ my new home some nine years ago, my wife and I were hooked on their huge steaks and roasted potatoes. Five years have passed since my last visit and even then I tasted a change that happened as suddenly as Hoboken's gentrification. Naturally I choked it up to an "off day" as any decent establishment is allowed one every now and then. Now with two kids, my wife and I visited Arthur's once more for old time's sake a few weeks ago. Service was standard, not spectacular but nothing to complain about. Then came the inconceivable...my wife and I were staring at two poorly cooked steaks with bleeding pulses on the inside and crunchy charred patches on the outside. Silly, we thought taking more bites of the steak would bring back the magic we once tasted from this place. Why do people do such foolish things...take one bite, feel dissatisfied and continue eating hoping they can chomp out a miracle? LOL, proof that my wife and I were really trying to not dislike Arthur's I guess. And the roasted potatoes were as bland as I never imagined they could be. Maybe their spice racks were abducted that night. Maybe sautéed onion cores and two lone slices of pepper helps them pay the rent. What it did was make this visit my absolute last. I almost had to step out of the place and make sure it was Arthur's and not Charlie Brown's. Sad because once upon a time I used to tease my wife about eating that 48 ounce steak. Now, I couldn't feel any better about avoiding the steak behemoth and Arthur's altogether in the future. And so should you.
2014-09-10,3,Ahhhh was here for a Nice surf and turf. I did the 55$ menu for two. Which was completely worth it. The steak had no flavor at all unless I added a little salt on to it. But I also admired others people food. It looked great. I would like to come back to try the rest of the menu. The staff was a little slow. They only had 2 waiters in a dining room and no one helping them. No buss boys at all. We had To ask for the check 4 times. I'm in the business I totally understand the wait but I never let my costumers ask for the check 4 times.
2014-09-09,3,I have dined here once. burger is nice. my wife tried their salad - that was ok as well. its a confusing place for a steakhouse - they have large screen TVs all over the place which makes it look more like a sports bar. overall, i guess i will give it another try for the burger when I am really craving one.. but nothing too fancy or great about it.
2014-09-06,4,The peppers + the gigantic steak makes one spectacular meal. And if you really want to blow it out of the water, get the garlic bread!!  Be prepared, to be stuffed!
2014-09-02,2,Food was average, but service was good. Would not return due to the food just being blah. Filet was tough, potatoes bland, and asparagus nothing exciting.
2014-08-28,4,Love this place. Go whenever I'm in town. The steak price has gone up some but still beats the premium steakhouses by a mile. Can't beat the steak or French onion soup. Not the prettiest decor but that's part of the charm.
2014-08-17,3,Good steak for reasonable price for Hoboken. Was it the best: no. The potato wedges were good too but very oily. Service was also above average but again, not outstanding. I went there on a Saturday night and place was almost full. There is nothing fancy about the decor.
2014-08-16,5,I'm from Texas and we love our beef but personally, this is the BEST STEAK i've ever had and it was reasonably priced!!!  I always have a big appetite and I was tempted to order the 48oz double but glad thing I didn't.  The "Our Steak" 24 oz is PERFECT!!!  It was so tasty and juicy and good fat on it and big enough that I couldn't finish it in one sitting!  That's rare even for this guy!  The steak was $27 and worth every dollar!I've never grew fond of a great steak until Arthur's.  We have Saltgrass, Texas Roadhouse, Longhorn but the sad reality for example is when you think a restaurant's bread was the best thing there and not the steak!  Sad....sad....sad....and blinded! FYI  PARKING IS HORRENDOUS so plan ahead and try to avoid the weekend crowd!  The Bacon appetizer was tasty but not as big as I thought.  The garlic bread is a MUST!   Hope y'all enjoy this place while you're in town!FYI, Carlo's Bakery is down the street for some tasty lobster tails and tiramasu but we stood in line for 2hrs! idk......
2014-07-31,4,Best steak I have ever eaten. It was so large that with the amount I had left I managed to help feed two very grateful homeless guys at Hoboken Path station.My only complain, the place needs decorating!
2014-07-10,3,This place has a monday night burger special which is just amazing, just around 7 dollars for a burger with three toppings and it comes with fries!  Their garlic bread is also really good.  But the service lacked a bit, but only because the server didn't check on our group much and forgot to bring the garlic bread.  We reminded her and she did bring it to us but we had already started our meal at that point...
2014-07-03,4,I love going to this place. One of the best places to enjoy a huge steak and it tastes so good. Reasonable prices prolly 25 ish per person. Steak is to die for... Seriously.
2014-06-24,2,The food was average at best - I had the chicken sandwich which was dry and nearly flavorless. The beer selection was nothing to write home about - no craft selections on draft at all. The only positive I can take away from my experience is the availability of outdoor seating and the attentiveness of our waiter. I would explore other options the next time I visit Hoboken.
2014-06-22,3,Maybe because I've gotten used to Manhattan prices, but wow this place is cheap!  NY sirloin plus sides for $21--what a deal!  I came here on  Wednesday night with a group of 6 and it was pretty empty.  We had a $14 bottle of wine which actually wasn't bad, and a few pitchers of beer that ran around $10.  I started off with the french onion soup which I really enjoyed but it's quite heavy on the cheese.  For my entree, I got the market salad with steak. I requested the steak medium rare but it was medium to well done which was a let down.  I think instead of cooking a whole steak and slicing it, they cook it kabob style (I had big chunks of steak on the salad) which might be the reason.  It was flavored nicely but could use improvement in the done-ness area.  This is a cheap, decent steakhouse that has some good dishes.  If the prices were higher, it'd probably be a 2 star--it's a really great value!
2014-05-19,3,Service was terrible when we went on Saturday. I honestly thought the servers forgot we were there when they didn't come by within the first 20 minutes of us being seated. For the food - we have the garlic bread, it's seriously awesome! It's just garlic bread, but it's the best garlic bread. I had the reuben - it was open faced, not everyone likes that - I didnt mind. My boyfriend had a steak sandwich - it was so overly greasy that the puddle of grease on his plate was grossing me out.Finally - the drinks. Bloody mary was awesome.
2014-05-03,4,Arthur's has one of the best burgers in hoboken. juicy, beefy, thick and everything you want out of a burger
2014-05-02,4,My boyfriend's birthday is coming up, but he has a crazy work schedule, so we decided to surprised him a week early with dinner. My best friend was nice enough to help me pick a steakhouse and do the reservation for me. We arrived and were led to a table for 12 and introduced to Josimar - our super friendly and super accommodating server for the night. Due to the monsoon, we only ended up being 10, and unfortunately our arrivals were staggered, but our server took it in stride and didn't seem to mind having to run to the kitchen for a bowl of french onion soup every time someone showed up. Garlic bread... so good! The beer, very large. The steak, well, if you are a steakhouse and can't do steak right... maybe you should become a vegan restaurant. The swordfish, well, one of my friends got it, and it was her first time trying swordfish. She was disappointed, it was overcooked. Fortunately for her, this is not a seafood restaurant. Dessert on the other hand, my boyfriend refused to share his, if that says anything. I was disappointed to discover that the cappuccino machine was broken. Although I realize that the weather outside caused people to consider building an Ark, I do think they need to get someone in to get a look at their roof. While we were there, buckets everywhere to catch the leaks. Needs some loving.
2014-04-17,4,This place is a favorite go to steakhouse for me. Never has my cut of beef been over cooked. They seemed to get it right each and every time.
2014-04-06,2,Firstly, this is not Arthur's Tavern anymore. The place got sold and is now Arthur's of Hoboken. Go to Arthur's Tavern website. On their homepage "The former Hoboken and New Brunswick locations are no longer affiliated with Arthur's Tavern." They do use the same menu's, the same staff and the same red and white checkered table cloths. This was a tough call on the rating. The food is usually hit or miss and so is the service but my last visit left a bad taste in my mouth.As with every trip to Arthur's, the food is either okay or bad. The ribeye will be a great cut of beef for the price or nothing but fatty grizzle. That is just how it works there.  Arthur's is a place that can be a good bang for the buck but do not go there looking for dry aged meat or prime meat for that matter.Anyway, my last visit was late March of 2014. It was a Saturday. Our server, Brian P., was awful.  Usually servers are bad or good and that is the way the restaurant world works. But this guy was in the "should I get the manager involved?" class.Here's what happened. From the very beginning he was just a bad server. Could not get the orders right, did not know the menu, did not know what beers were available, etc. Just clueless. We asked for garlic bread. My friend mentioned that last time we were here we had cheese melted on the garlic bread; could they accommodate and do this again? Brian P.'s response "No way. It doesn't work that way. The kitchen would not know how to handle that request."  Ok fine, regular garlic bread.  As soon as he leaves the room a friend quip's "How dare we ask for the complicated task of melting cheese on bread!"  The whole table erupted in laughter. That was ridiculous. Of course you can accommodate. It is melting cheese on bread not truffles or edible gold flakes.  And if you were not sure, you should ask the kitchen first. You did not know the menu anyway.Throughout the whole service, he would interrupt at the worst times and would butt in to our private conversations and jokes. A friend asks if we had all seen a certain movie and he answers.  Not only that, he gives away the ending. No one had answered yet; thank you for ruining the movie for half the table.And that continued through the whole evening. Nothing but bad  timing and butting in. But it was not until the end of the dinner that it got from bad to worse. My friends and I were discussing our next charity walk/run and Brian P. comes over and points his finger at my friend, who is overweight, and says "There is no way you will be involved with this! haha". I was mortified. My friend did not travel from out of state to be insulted by some jerk. My friend was good about it and smiled. As soon as Brian P. left the room we all apologized and asked if he wanted us to get the manager involved. My friend said no.  His actions went beyond rude and crossed over into insulting and mean spirited. I do not know what this guy's deal was. Perhaps he thought not knowing the menu, butting into private conversations, and insulting patrons is how servers are suppose to act. Maybe he never has dined at an establishment before. Or that is how he gets treated by staff when he goes out. I do not think I will be eating here for a while.
2014-04-03,5,New York City-quality steak/tavern, New Jersey location and pricing, 100% worth it.What I have to say about Arthur's Tavern is that, to me, it is nothing below exceptional. What I want to say is an ace that takes the gold medal is the steak... I emphasize it. If you're going to dine here and not have one of their steaks, your visit must be some sort of joke. Of all my visits, I've had their crab cakes, french onion soup, and, the winner that takes the cake, the steak. I'll go ahead and explain why I'm crazy about the steak. A steak that has a taste that lingers in your mouth, perfectly juicy... practically having the steak kinda melt in your mouth... have you ever had a steak like that? This is exactly it and they've done it right with the perfect amount of burn (light to tasteless burn with a perfect crisp... what a bonus!) I've been to steakhouses across the Hudson and I can say that the quality is comparable and costing a lot less than $45. Everything else I've had there (crab cakes, French Onion Soup, and their salads) were of above-average quality and I have absolutely nothing to complain about. I will definitely recommend the French Onion Soup for an appetiser. It doesn't matter where, but French Onion Soup is my favourite thing to have before a delicious steak of high quality! Service is comparable to an attitude of New York City with a mix of North Jersey attitudes. The people working there are friendly, especially during football games. There'll usually be some funny banter going on among the people that work there and... well, if you know how New York City likes sports, you can apply those characteristics here. Otherwise, service is pretty good and I have nothing bad to say about that either. Finally, atmosphere is average, speaks a lot of what's across the Hudson and what's a tavern like. I weigh the atmosphere low on my ratings, but this is the only thing I have some negative feedback to say. I get it, winters are cold and summers are hot. All year long, in there, it's hot. You can tell where I'm going at when it comes to dining here in the summer - it is sweating and smoking hot. Just noting that while I type this up in 45°F weather. Overall...OK, let's get this straightforward... you're here... for the steak. Got it? Hah. But yes, if you're in Hoboken and in the mood for steaks, there's no reason to pass up Arthur's Tavern!
2014-03-31,4,Delicious, better than expected. We had the Filet sub and chili. The steak was cook to the temp requested and the chili was the perfect size. Definitely, will eat there again.
2014-03-29,5,the best steak I've ever had, great food and drinks, don't forget your pan ajo
2014-03-19,4,This place is great.. Couple of my friends and I decided to come here since a friend of ours recommended to us. We all had the 24 Oz steak and it was really good. Food was great, service was excellent!
2014-03-06,3,One of the worst steaks in all of Hoboken, however, everything else at this location is pretty damn good!!
2014-03-06,5,I had their steak last night and it was great! It came with potatos on the side and was ready very fast. They have a full bar too. Overak awesome experience.
2014-03-05,2,Their special steak and their French onion soup were really delicious, but everything else on the menu that we ordered was sub par. The shrimp on the shrimp cocktail were good, however the presentation was terrible. The tomato and mozzarella was nothing better than what I make at home - quite frankly I make it better.The place was dead on a Tuesday night, playing awful music. The service was slow and didn't speak English well, if at all....
2014-02-26,3,Perhaps they need a second chance. The steaks are a fantastic size, but man do you have to work to eat something on them that isn't 90% fat. While I don't expect a NY Strip to be as lean as a Filet, this was a bit extreme. Service was fine, and fun. It's a tough call. Their prices really aren't even close to expensive, but the quality follows suit. I'd rather pay more for an increase in quality.If you're seeking a top notch steakhouse experience, this one probably isn't it. This is a steakhouse for boys. If you want a steakhouse for men, look elsewhere. Nice folks though...
2014-02-26,5,Great place the burgers are amazing, steaks are good to you have to try the potatoes out of this world, fairly inexpensive great place for family night out
2014-02-25,5,We hadn't been to Arthur's in more than 15 years, but found recently that it is still the same old place.  Had the old standbys of the French onion soup with cheese lapping over the side of the bowl, the lettuce wedge buried under blue cheese, and the 24 oz. house steak.  An unabashed, slightly sinful, totally delicious pigout that leaves you feeling slightly guilty..  Steaks done just right, and portions more than generous. Just finished the doggy bag, which was just as good.For two, $75 isn't a heck of a lot considering you get four good meals out of it.
2014-02-09,4,4 * Recommendation found on trip advisor and does not disappoint ! Best ribeye I've ever tasted with home made mashed potatoes."Our Burger" were juicy and so tasty they needed no condiments.Scooped out some of the bread from the bun so that it was less heavy.The steak on the Caesar salad was tender but not quite as tasty as the rib eye.Great find since no one was from Hoboken.
2014-01-31,4,I have been coming here for years and they have not changed since the first time I've been here especially the food. I'm actually surprised I just got to review this place now because I would've a long time ago if I was into writing reviews back int he day. I usually will stick with what I know and love. And what I usually always get is the garlic bread to start off with. It's toasted and when they bring it out it's all wrapped in foil and then when you release it you see the fresh warm steam come up and then the strong garlic smell hits my olfactory glands like a rocky punch and then it makes my mouth salivate ready to take a bite. Its soft and does not skimp on the garlic and butter. The steak I usually go for is the 24 ounce medium rare with their traditional cooked potatoes on the side. The meat is so juicy and tasty that only a few droplets of A-1 is needed. The homemade potatoes works so well with the steak that it's probably one of the best duo's since Batman and Robin. To fight off the protein inducement you encounter you'll need the carbohydrate potato that's soft as mash potatoes but thick like waffle fries. If I lived in Hoboken I'd probably come more often but finding  parking in this neighborhood is a wickedy wickedy wickedy wack.
2014-01-20,1,Great food, bad service! Servers were very disrespectful and slow. A female waitress kept telling us she couldn't hear me. How could she? She was standing 2 tables away and refuse to come closer. I had to get up and ask her if there was a problem! 20 mins after, the table next to me complained about her as well. I approached 2 other servers and got the same treatment. Once again, the food was great but the service was not worth the aggravation. I feel so sorry for the owners because I'm sure they care about their customers.
2014-01-10,4,Buyer beware:  it's hit or miss.  Go in with good, laid back friends expecting a great relaxed atmosphere, most likely shitty service, and a 75% chance of getting a good cut of monster ribeye on the cheap.  They could use to add the real steakhouse sides  (and could probably draw people just for those), and better utilize the bar area(s), and make sure they never overcook a burger (as has almost become the norm)...but damnit, Arthur's, I still love you!
2014-01-02,3,I want to give Arthur's a better rating than 3 stars, but I just can't. Sometimes the steak is perfect, and sometimes I think I could have cooked a better one at home. I still enjoy going here, the burgers are really good and so are the fries. I always get the ribeye, and it seems to be hit or miss.
2013-12-29,4,Chill atmosphere. Dark, sometimes crowded. Food takes a while but is really good. Big portions, decent price. Nice neighborhood.
2013-12-23,4,For a quick steak, this place is definitely the best.  It isn't aged or anything, but they marinate it really well.  The service is very speedy and it's the perfect place to go after work.  Too bad I don't live or work near it, otherwise i'd be there every week.  The price is not bad at all and their burgers are very big.  I'd suggest getting the 24 oz ribeeye with a large rootbeer.  You will definitely be surprise when you see the size of the rootbeer.  It can be tough finding parking..
2013-12-20,1,My husband got very sick,  had to use a restroom at a gas station soon after leaving.   We came with a group of 10.  Most people ordered the French onion soup and the arthurs steak.   I ordered the fish of the day and it was complete garbage.   The vegetables,  brocoli and carrots look like frozen veggies.   I don't see why they can't just serve fresh vegetables.   The fish of the day was salmon,  on the menu it says wild caught salmon.  The salmon was actually farm raised most likely frozen also.   The glaze on the salmon was alright, but pointless on such a bland junk piece of fish.   I tried someone's steak and it was also disgusting.   They load the steak up with seasoning and burn it.   The steak is not good and over seasoned.   The only two positive things are the warm garlic bread in the beginning of the meal and the potatoes that come with the steak are alright.   Do not come here if you're used to nyc food,  this place is not worth the trip.   The steak I honestly wouldn't even feed to my dog.  The salmon was so disappointing I'm pretty sure it's frozen farm raised fish,  really disappointing food.   There are so many amazing restaurants locally, do not leave nyc for this place.
2013-12-11,5,Amazing bang for the buck in NYC area. Great steaks and you walk away feeling like you didn't just get mugged to eat a steak.
2013-12-10,5,The trip from my UES neighborhood to Hoboken is beyond worth it (every time) for the tastiest steak in the tri-states! Hubby and I would swim if we had to!  The garlic bread is worth every calorie! We had Matt as our server on our last visit and he was perfect. Thanks Matt!
2013-11-10,3,This used to be my favorite steak house in NJ/NY area.  However, the steak is not the same.  It is still good but it is not great.   The garlic bread is still good.
2013-11-07,2,I have been to this joint a number of times, it's a staple in the family for group dinners. A favorite for YEARS that will not be visited again anytime soon. They over cooked 3 of 6 steaks and the waitress would not even look us in the face, SERIOUSLY! Our drinks were empty half the time and a few times we had to physically get up to look for her. It's really SAD to see such a wonderful place doing so poorly. Do not waste your money here.
2013-10-28,2,Full disclosure: I was not expecting much when my companions picked Arthur's for lunch. The reviews were blah, the decor was dated, & the fact that I hadn't ever noticed it while walking up & down Washington Street couldn't be a good sign.They readily welcomed our group of 12 for lunch without a reservation (though I should mention that the restaurant had maybe 3 other patrons at 11:30am on a Friday). I can't imagine there's ever a wait here ... which is good or bad, depending on how you look at it.The food was better than I expected. I had a grilled chicken sandwich, and it was tasty & just moist enough -- not dry or burned. My plate came with a giant mound of fries, which proved to be just a little too much food for me. Most of my companions got either burgers or salads. Predictably, the men all finished their burgers, and the women struggled to clear their plates. I think I ate half of my sandwich, and then gave up on the bread & just ate the chicken of the second half, along with maybe 2/3 of the fries. Everyone was happy with the quality of the meal & the attentiveness of the server.The food is decent; nothing spectacular, nothing terrible. And the portions are very substantial. With that said, I think the food is a bit heavy for standard lunch fare. Prices are good though, so if you're ok with leaving half your meal on your plate (or willing to take it home), you're going to love this place. As for me ... I can't see myself coming back here on my own, but my day won't be absolutely ruined if we chose this place for another group outing.(Oooh, and if you're trying to have a good work lunch, maybe go for something a little lighter. All of us were pretty sluggish afterward hahah -- definitely a productivity killer!)
2013-10-26,4,Food is pretty good.  Not the best but definitely good for what I was craving. But the best part is the employees. Everyone who works here is awesome and happy and upbeat. They make it awesome to come here and make me want to come back. So I will.  Just because of them. I wish everyone was like these people.
2013-10-16,4,Had dinner with 8 friends - we had planned on going to a Cuban restaurant, but they only had tables of 4. Went to Arthur's last minute and was very happy. Good service, good food. VERY fair price for Hoboken. Their ribeye steak sandwich is excellent. The atmosphere is fun & casual. Comfort food at its best.
2013-10-08,5,My husband and I had a delicious lunch here today!  I had the French onion soup which was amazing and my husband had the filet mignon sandwich with fries. His sandwich was so scrumptious!  It's a huge sandwich and a great deal for all you get!  My husband has talked about how delicious his lunch was all night!  We will definitely be back.
2013-09-12,3,I've been to Arthur's a number of times now, and while I'd like to love it, I just can't get myself above an "It's OK". They call themselves a steakhouse (in addition to a tavern) but their steaks don't really make the grade. This isn't a special-occasion-let's-go-out-for-a-nice-meal steakhouse. It's more like a it's-the-middle-of-the-week-and-I'm-craving-red-meat steakhouse. Which is OK, as long as you set your expectations accordingly.I went this week for Monday "Burger Night". This is admittedly a good deal. You get a burger with up to 3 toppings (for which they'd normally charge) and fries for $6.99. It's not a small burger and they don't skimp on the fries. But the burger I had was just "fine". It would not make it onto any of my best burger lists, that's for sure. The beef itself could have been better seasoned. The fries were actually the highlight of that meal; they were crisp and delicious.The space is a bit dated. It's nothing fancy, but it's clean and functional. The service has generally been fine.So yeah, A-OK about sums it up.
2013-08-25,3,I must admit, when I've walked in to Arthur's I haven't been really hungry so I haven't tried their steaks, but their ULTIMATE BACON appetizer keeps me going back!The place is very spacious, perfect for family and/or celebratory lunches/dinners. They also have a few bars where you can sit and have a quick meal if you don't want to sit at a table
2013-08-15,5,There steaks are huge!! The 6 oz steak is huge!! Food here is amazing!! Service was great, they give you pickles and hot peppers to pick at...yumm. It's a low key spot that no one would of thought their steaks were amazing till you tried it. The griddle potatoes go so well with it!! My favorite steakhouse. Make sure you go on an empty stomach cause you will get super full.
2013-08-08,4,Came here in a group of 9 on a weekday night and enjoyed somewhat old fashioned American steak house ambiance.Although the restaurant wasn't so busy (wasn't even half full), the service was a bit slow (over 20 mins to get beer?). But the male wait stuff for our table was friendly and seemed to be doing his best.Over all good experience with giant steak and the garlic bread (this is a trap to let you stuffed up before the steak served! Warm and soft. Sooo good!). My rare steak actually came out almost like medium rare to weldone, but still tasted good. As for the pickles, I just wanted regular cucumber kind instead of peppers...I live in upper manhattan and feel it's long trip to come here often, but most likle will come back...!
2013-08-07,4,If you want steaks not PRICEY (24oz for less than $30) then this is the place for you ... the ambiance is so family oriented and people do flock to this place so a reservation (for a large group) is a MUST.  If not for being in Hoboken (NJ), I would go to this place constantly (I live in Long Island).
2013-07-27,2,Good ambiance and i appreciate the history this place has, but the "our steak" was fatty and not well marbleized.  Crab cakes were okay, not great , a little wet.  A1 sauce on the table is never a good sign.  I'm glad I tried this spot as I've walked by it a bunch of times. while ill likely never order a steak from here again, I may come back for the burger, which looked pretty delicious.
2013-07-14,1,If you like big, chewy, tough steaks, like a gristle sandwich, this place is where you should go! There meat is just plain awful.  Avoid at all costs.
2013-07-13,3,Did anyone (else) get sick here on Friday July 12, 2013?  We were a party of three arriving near 8PM.  A friend and I each ordered "Our Steak".  We both couldn't even make it back to Queens, we had to stop in midtown to use the bathroom in Kips Bay theater.  It was my friend's first meal of the day aside from a plain roll.  And I had eaten four hours before with no stomach problems until right after the steak.We both ordered it rare.  It shouldn't make a difference though.  I always eat my steaks rare.  This time, it gave me the runs, four times from Friday night 9:00PM into Saturday morning.The service was fine, the steak tasted good and was cooked to the right degree of wellness.  I just wanted to see if this was an isolated incident or small sample or not.
2013-07-10,2,Been here a few times. The first few times were okay -- maybe 3 stars. The steaks were cooked good enough, and the prices were excellent for a casual meal.But last night, what a disappointment! First our medium-rare steaks came out medium-well, bordering on well done. We sent them back. Ten minutes later, the second attempts came out and were simply RARE on the inside -- so rare that there was no flowing of any juices --  not even blood. Needless to say, my friend and I lost our appetites and ended up throwing in our towels on the whole meal....I will say that the fried calamari was excellent (though the portion size was pretty small).
2013-06-21,3,You can't beat their burger special on Monday nights!  $6.99 for a burger (+ 3 toppings) and fries.  If I was rating them solely based on this, I'd probably give them 5 stars based on quality-to-price.  However, outside of the special, the food is still good, but it doesn't trump the competition when evaluating against some of the other places in Hoboken.
2013-05-22,4,Arthur's a little gem. It's an older restaurant (supposedly, one of the oldest ones in Hoboken?) Reading all reviews, I will stand by what they are all inferring: this place is known and raved for its AMAZING and DELICIOUS FOOD.The other night was my third time at Arthur's for a birthday - after a few birthday cocktails at Happy Hour, it's safe to say we were all STARVING.Being a Monday, the restaurant was nearly empty. We were seated right away and the waitress came over. She didn't even say hello or introduce herself and basically threw the menus at each one of us. Terrible! The food was excellent (although I am not a big steak eater and I recently joined WW, so I decided to go with the Surf & Turf... but I got my steak well-done, IDK WHY?! because I don't eat it often and I didn't know wtf I was ordering, but anyways!) but the service that night was totally disappointing. The waitress's service/manners did get a bit better as the night rolled on, but IMO, she still didn't quite earn the generous tip we left her. I'll be coming back, just with hopes of better service! Such a shame to ruin an otherwise great restaurant with shitty service!
2013-05-19,2,I lived in Hoboken as a kid ... Horrible food.  Not fresh Mozzerella, All American, Rubin was crap.  Totally run down place.
2013-04-27,1,Mouse ran out of the boiler room while we were eating.  Such a turnoff!!!!
2013-04-27,4,came here last night we were seated quickly and the food is always good fair price and good service no need for an app as the main course is more than enough
2013-04-25,4,I enjoy the bacon burger and a nice large liter of Beer. The Value is fair and the service is great. Never have a problem finding a seat at the bar. Always a treat when I return back to the Stevens campus.
2013-04-22,5,Arthur's has been a family tradition for as long as I can remember. My father would take us there for Mother's Day, birthdays and just because. The steaks are to die for. I have been told the reason they are so juicy is because they are soaked overnight in buckets of Coca Cola. Not sure as to the veracity of that statement but whatever it is they are doing works. I prefer my steaks well done and fear getting back charred, dry steaks. At Arthur's this has never been the case. I usually order their junior sirloin with the shrimp and their potatoes. Anyone in the area should definitely go try their steaks. The best part is that they are very accommodating when it comes to large parties. Highly recommend this place!
2013-04-22,4,Arthur's is one of the oldest Hoboken restaurants. The first time I had their steak was 13 years ago. It hasn't changed at all. Still the same consistent taste - this is not a high-end steak place, just a good old trustworthy local steak house.Where Arthur's shines is a burger. I think they have the best in Hoboken. Very good taste, portion size and extras.If you like draft cider (English style, hard cider) go to Arthurs! It's a true rarity to find draft cider in American bars.They serve beer in 1 liter mugs - pure joy.The best way to start dinner at Arthur's is to order the pickle plate. They have excellent crunchy pickles and mouth-burning bell peppers. Adventurous types can down a shot of vodka followed by the pickled pepper and then take a massive bite of a burger. Satisfaction guaranteed!Desserts are ok. Frankly I wouldn't even dare a dessert after consuming a burger or a steak. The calorie counter will be far in the red zone.Ribs are very good and huge.Service has always been fast and good. Never had any problems with seating.Btw, I like the checkered plastic tablecloths. They are in harmony with the place and part of Arthur's character.
2013-04-06,4,I came in to NJ to see a friend. He is a great friend. We were looking for a place to go eat on a Saturday night. We were looking for something nice and easy but tastes great at the same time. Hmmm, we thought. What could that be??? So, we asked SIRI, the genderless voice on the iPhone, and she brought up Arthur's Tavern. After reading the reviews on Yelp, we decided to give it a go. Upon arrival, we were seated promptly with no wait. Remember, this is a Saturday night... There was plenty of room for seating. However, of all of the good spots, our host seated us between 2 large groups. Not my choice of seating but we made it work. After reviewing the menu, we ordered right away. We both ordered burgers, I had bacon on mine and my friend had no bacon. We thought our burgers came with cole slaw. However, we realized they only came with fries. After informing us that the burgers did not come with slaw, we were very surprised when our waitress surprised us with 2 free helpings of cole slaw!!! For free!! Talk about great service!! After precisely 10 minutes, we received our food. Let me tell you, the burgers were TO DIE FOR!!! they were excellent. So seasoned to perfection. i'm talking mouth watering. Amazing. The fries were good as well, however they were just fries. Nothing to rave about. After the meal, our server brought us the check in a very timely manner. We were out of there and on our way to get some ice cream in no time. PROS- Good service- Amazing burgers- Friendly peopleCons- Could have seated us better- Faster on the refills please- Background music did not fit the environment at times
2013-04-02,2,My friends always go here and told me it's a great price for a good size steak. I finally came here to try it and i felt like it was totally overrated. I didn't like it at all. The nachos were good though. The best thing i liked here was the garlic bread. It was amazing!!!! Must get ! The only thing i would probably get if i was ever to ever be back here. But I won't be coming back here.
2013-03-31,4,I have been to this Arthur's three times and the one in Morris Plains once and I have never been disappointed. I really love the classic old school vibe that I get when I'm at Arthur's. The plastic tablecloths some may see as tacky, I think it gives a little character. The place is huge. I've never sat in the same section twice actually. I'm somewhat tried and true as I have only ever ordered the junior sirloin. This trip was *slightly* different.My boyfriend and I split the fried calamari appetizer and we thought it was very good. They rings were cooked to perfection and the dipping sauce was good. We each had salad next (Caesar for me, wedge for him) and I really liked it. There was enough dressing to coat the entire salad without it drowning in dressing. I'm not sure if the dressing is house made or not but it was good. As I said before, I of course got the junior sirloin and added a side of steamed veggies. I ate most of it and cut off pieces of fat that probably equated to 1 cup. I don't think that's too terrible especially when it's just trim on the outside. And those skillet potatoes. Oh em gee! I mean, yeah I could make something similar to this at home, and with less grease but these puppies are just too damn delicious.
2013-03-04,2,This is the kind of place I wanted to like. Old, character place with a lot of cache, in the right part of town, and with a storied history. Older folks talk about it and how they loved it growing up and all that jazz.I really was disappointed. It's too bad. Their problem can be easily fixed. Get a better butcher, or pay up for better meats. Instead, the price is hefty, and the quality is so-so. That's a terrible combination. I don't mind paying up for good stuff, but when I pay elite prices, I expect elite delivery.Fail.The chili, however, was excellent. But that's not a compelling enough reason to go back. I hope they step it up, I'll keep my ears open.
2013-02-23,5,Fantastic night!!!! Deserves 6 stars if there were such a thing! We had a private party of 27 people last night and the food, service and price was amazing. The customized price fixe menu was full of great appetizers like crab cakes, ultimate bacon, tomato & mozzarella, garlic bread, and Asian wings.  Main entree's included their famous steaks but also had an incredible salmon dish. If you haven't been to Arthur's since the new owner took over, it's a must go!!!
2013-02-10,5,The 24 oz rib eye (our steak) is still the best steak I've had anywhere. Loved the marbling and flavor. Best medium rare. Their bacon is excellent too. All at a very good price. Really can't get better than that!
2013-02-06,5,I've lived in Hoboken for more than 25 years, and recently rediscovered Arthur's with friends who were raving about it. It was great! There was no pressure to run to our table from the bar. Once at our table, the service was attentive but not over-bearing. We started with a great sampling of appetizers, including the truly AMAZING fried pickles and a pork belly dish that was irresistable. We, naturally, had steaks that were cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious. For those who may not know, Arthur's is under new ownership. There was real interest from Tom in our experience...food, service and atmosphere. He wasn't over-bearing, and knew what to ask, and for how long. We really felt welcomed and value as customers. While I am sure there are changes coming, perhaps some related to decor and perhaps others related to the menu, the recent menu additions and the unhurried dining experience made us glad to have rediscovered this old friend. We'll go back often.And, don't forget to ask about the wine list. They've upgraded that experience too!
2013-01-30,2,New to town, and trying to write reviews of each place we visit.  Yelp's description of 2-star "Meh. I've experienced better" is spot on.  Garlic bread is great.  Just make sure everyone in your party has a piece.  The steak was...fine.  But overall, it was dingy and the checkered plastic tablecloths do nothing for me.  Service was sub-par and the place was actually empty when we were there.  Didn't realize they charged for soda refills, but that's really low-rent.  Don't see a reason to go back.
2013-01-27,4,I have been to Arthur's here and in Morris Plains for over two decades and while the steaks prices have gone up while the quality has gone down, they beat any other chain steakhouse out there. The one item on here that has been overlooked the most is their French onion soup, which is the best I have ever had! The broth has Excellent flavor, the salt is not overpowering, with marble rye bread and lots of onions, topped with a generous slice of Munster (The burnt part of the cheese is even better!) A must have for fans of this soup.Another item worth trying is the pastrami, whether plain or as a Reuben, I believe they smoke their own, or some outside vendor does it, either way this not sliced off of some Boar's Head or Thuman's product.
2013-01-21,1,I guess you have to be in your 20's to appreciate this rustic tavern.  And when I say rustic I mean dirty, crowded, loud and dark bar.  Usually younger people can tolerate this more I think.  Food was mediocre at best. Yes you get a lot but that doesn't mean you want it.  We ate there on a Saturday night around 6:30 and it was packed.  I guess the prices lure the crowds in because the service and food don't.  All our dinners were served cold after waiting a half hour for it and one fish dinner had an odd taste.  My Reuben sandwich was ok but cold.  The steak sandwich was just huge chunks of meat and the burgers were average.  The famous potatoes must have been famous for being awful. They were mushy and lacked any distinct flavor.   Waiter never came by to check on us and we had to end up going to the bar to get our own drinks.  I am sure my review will not put them out of business but just be aware of what to expect.
2013-01-21,1,During lunch hours, We saw a mouse run across the dining area and the hostess only shrugged. This place used to be good but it needs a clean up!!
2013-01-20,5,A-mazing! I love this joint. I used to go to the one in Morristown where I used to live, and just realized they had one in Hoboken! The "our steak" is beyond amazingly delicious and I would eat this every night if I could afford the 30 bucks for it. Get it rare, the only way to eat meat!
2013-01-13,4,Pretty good food for what it is. Your local old school steakhouse where you can get a good meal, a large brew, and all in the comfort of your sweats. No dressing up necessary! The steak was good, the burger was great, and the potatoes were pretty tasty as well! Glad that I got to try this place out before heading out of town.
2013-01-11,3,Of the three Arthur's places, this is my least favorite...but not because the food isn't good.  In fact, of the three Arthur's restaurants, I think this one makes the best burgers...the reason it's my least favorite is that I'm not a big fan of going all the way to Hoboken and the only way I will go here again is if someone else drives.I don't hate Hoboken, it's just a pain for me to get to and I don't suffer crappy parking or long waits well...and you have to deal with both for Arthur's.  So, back to the food-I remember the first time I hit this location and the 24 oz steak was cheap, like $12 or $13.  Steaks are the same (good, but not great-a little fatty, but tasty), place is the same (almost always crowded), service is the same (actually pretty good), the beers are usually icy cold, but the prices have gone way up.  Hey, it's Hoboken, the prices have gone up everywhere...As I said before, the burgers here are pretty good, the scrod is too, and the steaks are fine-you get what you pay for. I can't tell you about the other entrees though, haven't tried anything else...I'm a creature of habit sometimes.   Arthur's can be a fun place if this is your town, but there are better steak places in Hoboken.  If you choose one of them...you'll pay, yes you'll pay, so if you're looking for a good steak without losing your paycheck, Arthur's isn't a bad decision...
2012-12-28,4,This review is just for a Bleu Cheese Burger and fries that I ordered take out. They were fantastic. The burger was juicy and the fries crispy. Definitely one of the best places in Hoboken for a burger.
2012-12-18,2,Unfortunately this Arthur's is a mere shadow of it's former self.  I've been coming here for upwards of 20 years and my latest visit was disappointing.  They've changed the cut of meat they use for their steaks which should be illegal!  The steak I got was a more traditional, much leaner cut and although tasty it pales in comparison to the old cuts that were very heavily marbled and amazing.  Their prices have gone through the roof (granted, I remember when their steak was only $10.95!) and the service was spotty at best.  Arthur's used to be packed on a Saturday night and there were plenty of tables free when we were there.  Maybe the word is getting around.  The good news is their potatoes are the same but we did have to ask for a bowl of pickles, which used to be put on the table routinely.  Sad to see this place go down hill.
2012-12-16,1,rude service. dry steak. much worse than outback.
2012-12-14,5,Best steak ive ever eaten. Went here last night with a group of friends. We were seated immediately and our waiter took the order and the food came out fast. Great food great service what more can you ask for. "Our Steak" 2 thumbs up!!!
2012-12-10,1,This steakhouse (if you can still call it that) was good about 5 years ago.  Now they serve low quality steaks that are pre cooked and ready for your doggy bag.  Lower expectations if you plan on giving this a try.
2012-12-03,4,I'm not a Steak lover but when I do get a craving for it, I go here.  I usually get their 24 oz steak.  It's so huge that I always get to bring leftovers home! So if you're a lightweight like me, make sure to order this! I love the potatoes that come with it too! The only thing I don't like in this place is the parking! There's a parking deck behind it but unfortunately the restaurant doesn't vallidate tickets so you have to pay a whopping $15 to dine here.  Once in a while, you can get lucky and find a parking on the street.
2012-11-21,2,Is it better than Outback Steakhouse? Probably, but it doesn't really hold a candle to any of the other steaks I've eaten recently. Given that the other places were Peter Lugar, Ray's the Stakes (in Arlington, VA), and Wolfgang Puck's place, maybe I'm not giving this place a fair shake, but...1. Wife ordered steak medium. Came back medium-well. Her jaw hurt from all the chewing she had to do to get it down.2. Table has A1 steak sauce. Always a bad sign. No self-respecting steakhouse offers A1 and if asked for it, should beg the customer to not use it.3. When my soda comes from a soda gun (meaning they use a carbon dioxide tank and syrup), you shouldn't charge for refills. I was. Lame.My hope is someone in town convinces me to try this place again. I would really like to leave near a good steakhouse. Unfortunately, this trip didn't convince me of that, despite the general buzz about this place from other people.
2012-10-27,1,This place is absolutely disgusting. I got their famous 24oz rib eye. From a cost value ratio, this gives you a negative return. Save yourself the $27 and go to chain restaurant like long horns and you can get a better steak. I do not know how they can even still be in business. The steak that i got look more like a lump of meat, that was seriuosly unevenly cooked. It was so well cooked on the outside and the inside was still kind of cold. Please do yourself a favor and stay away from this dump of a restaurant.
2012-10-22,4,We came on a Saturday night with a party of 6 around 6:30PM or so.We got seated right away - Surprising since I remember this place being alot more crowded - But great for us!The steak and potatoes here are surprisingly good and doesnt cost an arm and a leg.We also had the Arthur's burgers, the fish and chips and pastrami - All were really good.I also really like the service here.  Its a pretty big place but we never really had to wait on any of the waiters.  They came by to check on us often and they were very responsive with everything.I remember parking behind the street at the public parking being alot cheaper... but I havent been here for a while... I feel old...
2012-10-15,3,I've heard good things about Arthur's the entire time that I've been here. The ranting and raving had been going on for months, but I put off coming to this place for as long as I've lived in Hoboken. I finally mustered up the courage to come here approximately a week ago and while I was pleased, did not see what all the fuss was about. I didn't get a chance to look inside too much, as I decided to sit outside. The weather was beautiful, so why not? There was ample seating outside and it was the middle of a Thursday - around 1pm. For my appetizer, I got the garlic bread and my date stuck with a salad (from start to finish... no fun). They had a pulled pork sandwich special on their menu, which is what I decided to order. To drink, I simply stuck with the soda as did my partner.My sandwich came out decently prepared and was right on the money.. but nothing beyond that. I didn't feel particularly blown away - maybe I should have ordered a steak? The garlic bread was very good though, I would definitely recommend that as your appetizer coming in.The folks nearby our table were very attentive. There was not a lot going on, so the staff was able to spend time with us every time it seemed as if we needed something. Prices were meh. I personally felt I had been paying more than what I received. It's tough to find reasonable prices paying for anything in these parts.All in all, this is an OK steak spot if you find yourself having the craving in Hoboken.
2012-10-06,2,Do yourself a favor, get on the PATH, pay $10-15 more and get yourself to a proper NY steak place.  What a zero this place was in terms of steak quality and their sheer ability to cook it correctly.I'm a self-proclaimed steak connoisseur, or am trying to be, and this was just... Not good.  I asked for a filet med. rare. Came more or less raw, but unevenly so, in that some bites were MR, others just inedible.  And I'll eat rare occasionally so it's not that it was just under for "my taste."  It just wasn't right and the quality was..not what it should be for $25+.Sides (a must for any steak place worth it's salt) were bland, over salted and my bf who ordered the house special just got a fatty, unevenly cooked  piece of meat with a lb of disgusting home fries. Only thing that saved it was our waitress.  Very attentive and promptly had them throw my steak back on when I let her know it was undercooked.Of course, then they over cooked it.  Never again.
2012-10-06,1,I have been going to Arthur's for years, a new owner came in last November (2011).  I have eaten there 3 times since and  the place has gone downhill fast.  Prices rose ~ 30% across the menu, and it is clearly not the same meat from prior.  No more pickles and coleslaw to greet you on the table, and yesterday (my last time there) we didn't even know who our waiter was.  After the hostess sat us and took our drink orders (without knowing the bar options), we sat for 20 minutes before some guy dressed like a bus boy came up and just shouted "okay you ready to order", mind you the place was not busy.It's a shame there is no place great in Hoboken anymore to get a classic American style decently priced steak.PS - two times ago my father found something not edible in his soupand 3 times ago they would not honor a coupon from the prior owner.
2012-10-02,3,Coming from the Big city (NYC) crossing over the water is a nice change of pace. And this place is a nice spot for a good steak or ribs.I suggest to order some garlic bread, it's amazing. But service is iffy, if they were on Restaurant Impossible the host will kill them
2012-09-22,4,Steaks are great, portions are huge and the atmosphere is very friendly and energetic. Two thumbs up!
2012-09-20,3,I've been coming here since I was a little girl. The prices have increased over the past years and some things have changed since they have a new owner. Such is life. One thing that hasn't changed though, is the fact that you still are able to get a great steak at a still considerably good price. I love their potatoes, although the portions used to be a lot better. Their burgers are EXCELLENT as well. Take that trip into Jers.. it's def worth it. And, you can fill your tank up for the low on your way back into the city lol
2012-09-10,5,I love steak!  I mean i absolutely LOVE steak, because nothing can beat a steak that's been cooked to perfection with all the fixin's.  Now i'm used to my super expensive steak houses in NYC.  Those steaks are heavenly and you pay the price out there.  Ok an amazing steak at a premium price - i'm willing.  I've heard the name Arthur's tossed around all the time as well whenever we talked about steak houses...and thus it went on my list of places to try.Then suddenly my dad - out of the blue - calls me and asks if i've ever been to Arthurs' (as the Yelp expert he thinks i am).  I'm like "Woah Woah Woah! Pops! You went here and didn't call me up to join you!?!"  He laughed and laughed and said - he visited before i could and took pride in that.  Annnnyway - so we took a seat inside in the back - the restaurant is much larger than it looks outside.  Sat down with the menu to and i decided on the "Our Steak" the steak houses' signature 24 oz steak with home fries (medium rare of course).  One of our other buddies ordered the rack of ribs and another guy ordered a burger.  When the food came around we split up the food to taste.The steak was amazing - delicious flavor, juicy - a nice crisp out latyer with a soft very juicy center.  It was just the right amount of tangible juice left on my plate to slop up the massive amounts of potatos they give as a side.  The Ribs were good, amazing?  probably not amazing - but they give you a whole lot.  So that makes up for it, along with a crazy amount of potatos.  The potatos also were very tasty - not overly salty or under (or over) cooked.the burger i didn't try - why b/c one man has one burger to himself - but he said it was one of the best burgers he had in a long time - so i'm going to take his word for it.  Truthfully though - i wouldn't get anything but the steak here since everyone seems to rave about it lol.I'm definitely coming back for a 2nd helping!
2012-09-09,2,Prices have gone up,quality has gone down.The drinks are a rip off.My friend had to send her steaks back twice,they were not edible.Very uncomfortable chairs.Do yourself a favor,go across the street to McDonald's.
2012-09-09,3,When I was first introduced to Arthur's 10 years ago, I remember paying $15.99 for a 24 ounce steak. We were given unlimited slaw and pickles. EVERYONE there either ordered a 24 ounce steak or the 48 ounce steak. That was 10 years ago people.I took my girlfriend there last night hoping to relive that moment but to do it with her. We got in, and the hostess (whom wasn't dressed in the Arthur's Tavern) and was old and fat, took her sweet time sitting us down. We had to follow her, and I don't know if she walks in one slow ass speed but she had to speed it up. We sat down and when we saw the menu, I was appalled at the prices! There was NO way we were willing to shell out (I was going to shell out) $27.99 PER STEAK WITH NO SLAW AND PICKLES!!! I didn't complain because my petite nerd girlfriend didn't want to have a steak so that was okay. We ordered the filet mignon sandwich and a burger and for what it's worth, they were delicious. Delicious, but when a person enters a steak house, quite frankly, they should order steaks and nothing else. We ordered the Farmer's French Onion Soup and was given one spoon. No problem. My server was nowhere to be seen so I asked a different waiter standing 2 feet away from us who was watching TV for a spoon. He looked confused that a customer would ask him for something, looked disheveled, looked around and responded with, "I'll tell your waiter you need a spoon." THIS IS WHY I REFUSE TO GIVE THE PLACE MORE THAN 3 STARS AND EVEN I THINK I'M BEING VERY GENEROUS RIGHT NOW. Will I be going back? Sure. The second they drop their steak prices.
2012-08-28,4,i went to Arthur's Tavern for lunch with my 8 and 11 year old kids and plan to share the 24oz steak thinking that it will be more economical for us and not waste any good food. one thing i've noticed from the last time i went there, they are a bit pricey now plus the fact they still have this "additional sharing charges". not all people can finish a 24 oz rib eye and sharing can be a good come-on to many customers. wish that your waitress will be kind enough to take out the sharing charge (when you say, "we will be sharing a 24oz steak")their steak is really great with their home fries and that spicy pickled pepper, i cannot say anything more about how they cook them. and we enjoyed sharing a very good steak. there are other cheaper options for a good rib eye steak but if i have the money, i'd prefer Arthur's
2012-08-09,3,Prices have risen. Quality has dropped. No more free pickles and slaw.Probably won't go back again, not worth it,
2012-07-21,1,The crab cake platter came cold. It was hot on the outside but as I got further into it got colder and colder. I complained, and was given another dish -- minus one crab cake.  A real quality restaurant would had replaced the entire meal. The waitress was friendly but clearly apathetic regarding the poor food. Just a shrug and a smile.My wife's burger gave her the trots and the pickles one usually sees on the table when you sit are gone -- now you must ask for them and the server never told us. There are new owners I was told. The old Arthur's Tavern was wonderful. Now, it's nothing more than a respite for the tourist visiting Hoboken. I won't be returning as they lost two once loyal customers.
2012-07-19,3,This place is very famous in Hoboken, and i've heard so many positive recommendations.  I've been here 4 times, and each time i tell myself, "i would've eaten better at Outback." Their steaks are usually over charred and the potatoes are greasy.  The slaw and peppers are nice and different but not needed for me in a steak house.  I really wouldn't come back here unless someone specifically wanted to come.  I've also heard they've changed ownership about 6 months ago.  Like any place that is reviewed, just try it first and judge yourself.
2012-07-15,4,That was an AMAZING sirloin steak! Honestly, a little on the pricey side, but still pretty good value!
2012-07-14,3,Just recently went there and it seems like it's totally changed from just 2-3 months ago. The steak was sub par and came with a side of mash potatoes. No pickles or cole slaw, which was always brought out free before. This was always my go-to place for a hearty, no-frills steak. I may need to find a new place. What happened? Did they change ownership?
2012-07-07,3,The most sought after steakhouse and i have had better at the Outback on many occasions. The coleslaw and pickle tray is a staple that everyone enjoys and it is a cozy atmosphere and a bit pricey witha limited menu, but it is a good place to unwind and relax.
2012-07-04,4,A girlfriend of mine took me to the Arthur's Tavern in New Brunswick way back in college. She was vegetarian herself, but she figured I would enjoy it. As I entered, everyone was hunched over their table. Not talking, just eating. Yeah. I looked about the place. Every surface of the walls was covered with any kind of beer mirror or sign you could imagine. I knew I was going to like this place.Then the moment of truth. We ordered. She ordered the "salad" being a leaf eater and all. I got the 14 ounce. Mine was heavenly goodness. Juicy. Tender. Flavorful. The trick to a good steak place is that you DON'T need any fancy sauce. It's surprisingly simple to achieve, but you just have to put in a little effort and know-how. You see me putting sauce on my steak, it's to make the steak edible. Her "salad" was a baby head of lettuce cut in half on a small plate. Funny. This one in Hoboken does not disappoint. Same great meat. Get on down there and get your chew on.
2012-07-01,3,Arthur's steaks is good,  and the filet mignon sandwich is delicious. The garlic bread was in-fact tasty as described. We visited on two separate nights and sat outside. The first night we had lousy service due to in-attentiveness.  The second time, we were the only family sitting outside, and our server Chelsea, was on top of it keeping our drinks full during the hot evening. Service makes a difference, and service with a smile makes it better!
2012-06-19,4,Great steak.  Fair price.  Generous portions.But the best thing about this place will be the garlic bread.  OMG.  It was so good.  I think they used maybe 5 sticks of butter for each loaf but definitely a must-order.  Will try the bread here next time I am back (probably will not be for a while - I only come here when I visit six flags and because I am not 15 anymore, I usually go once every 1-2 years).On another note, the drive to State Island through Bayonne was a NIGHTMARE.  I don't know who designed the streets and roads of New Jersey, but they must have went to school on the short bus because none of the roads make any sense.  And there are pedestrians that dart out when the signal is green.  It is legitimately like a cartoon or a video game.  And dont get me started on Jersey u-turns (wtf, right?!).Happy eating, suckers.
2012-06-17,3,I've been to Arthur's about four times. For about six months I lived in Hoboken, so it became a nice comfortable place for huge beers and huge steaks at small prices. The flavor is okay. The steaks are fatty/grizzled and only at choice quality without any enhancements, but they still taste pretty good.

2012-06-11,1,This place used to be good.  Was last here about two years ago.  Ate here the other night with my wife.  Poorly seasoned, poorly cooked, gristly meat.  Greasy, diner-quality potatos.  Flat beer.  I guess the server was nice enough.I won't be back.
2012-06-11,3,as that one utterly terrible song which is inexplicably popular goes..."now you're just a steakhouse that I used to know."I recently went to Arthur's after not having gone in about 2 years (maybe more). with a group of about 20 people, some being college students, there aren't too many affordable options on a Saturday evening in Hoboken.I had heard stories of new ownership here, and it shows. they lopped off some items from the menu, prices have gone up a bit, and you gotta ask for the pickles, peppers, and slaw (it was always brought out as soon as you sat your ass down - some kinda tradition here).the garlic cheese bread is still ridiculously delicious. the corned beef was decent - but just decent. the potatoes - oh man, I used to go apeshit for the potatoes here...soft, greasy, mixed with chopped onions and horrifyingly unhealthy for you, but still amazing...but now they were just alright.no complaints about the service. they do still sell liter mugs of beer, which is good.this used to be one of our default large party dinner joints - affordable food, relaxed atmosphere, tons of space. I guess I'd go back, but whereas in the past it was like "let's go to Arthur's!", now it's become "I guess we can go to Arthur's if there's no other option"...
2012-05-30,4,Just had a nice dinner at Arthur's.  I hadn't been there in a year or so, and I was wondering how much things have changed. We were a table of three, and we all ordered steaks (one 24 oz ribeye, one balsamic filet mignon special, one 12 oz sirloin).  Everyone's steak was cooked as requested and we enjoyed them thoroughly.  Arthur's 'famous' potatoes are still a tasty side. We also shared a salad with walnuts/cranberries/blue cheese, as well garlic bread.  No major complaints, maybe the dressing of the salad had too much vinegar.Arthur's prices have  gone up over the years, but they are still less than the typical Ruth Chris/Old Homestead pricing.  Expect to pay in the 'twenties' for your steak. Also, this is the time of year where they compete with all the outdoor tables in Hoboken, so it's less busy and much easier to get a table, as well as get the complete attention of your waiter.  Old trick. save about 1/4 of your steak / potatoes to bring home. Makes an awesome steak & eggs breakfast the next day.
2012-05-19,2,I'm not a big fan of slamming establishments. Arthur's isn't a fancy steakhouse. The meat is average at best. The price is reasonable. The service is reasonable. I've lived in town many years and been to Arthur's about 5 times. If Arthur's was a real steakhouse like The Palm, Peter Lugers, or The Strip House - i'd be there every month. Compared to those, it's awful. I'd rather go to Outback in Edgewater than eat at Arthur's. But that's just me.
2012-05-15,4,Hands down one of the best hamburger  and meal deals in Hoboken hands down.  For about $6 you get a huge, juicy hamburger cooked to order just the way you want it.  Yes, I know cheese is a little extra but if you want it, it's worth the extra cash.  Plus, you get a huge mound of tavern potatoes which are awesome.The first time I went I ordered one of their specials last spring which was a steak sandwich on garlic bread, ordered rare.  The sandwich was huge.  I have a big appetite and I ended up bringing half of it home with all the potatoes they gave me.  The onion soup is pretty good as well.  Sometimes there can be a bit too much cheese for some people but I like being able to have cheese with every bite!  Their 24 and 48 oz rib eye is pretty good as well.  Though not the greatest pieces of beef they are still pretty good.The server can be very spotty at times, depending on which section you are sitting. I would ask to sit in the back by the bar and since it is closer to the bar I've always seemed to receive better service.  The beer is always cold but the wine list is a bit lacking but what are you really expecting from a "tavern"?Bring your friends from out of town to Arthur's Tavern for burgers and a few beers, I promise everyone will leave smiling.
2012-05-09,5,Our favorite steak meal. We go for the small 24Oz one. My wife and I have been coming here for the last 15-20 years. I had a lot of steaks all over the world, this one is consistently the best. Must have if you haven't tried it yet.
2012-05-07,4,Want a good burger- go here. I got the Original Arthur with crispy bacon and cheddar and it was cooked perfectly medium rare. We all asked for our fries to be extra crispy and when they came they were not, but our server brought us a big plate, we piled up our fries and when they came back they were extra crispy and hot. I didn't mind the wait since my burger was so good.
2012-04-23,4,Two words: garlic bread!  And you get a whole loaf!!24 oz ribeye for less than $30 is a steal - beware though a medium rare comes out medium!  Want to create your own "Man vs Food", then I dare you to order your own 48 oz!The lettuce wedge salad is also excellent here!  One of my favorite Hoboken joints. No 5 stars cause they won't refill your water without asking twice.
2012-04-21,2,More like 2 1/2 stars actually.  The other 1/2 star comes in to play later in this review.  So, we went here last night.  I was craving for a burger, and thought that a steak place would have a good one.  Furthermore, the price of each meal and bottle of wine were very attractive.  We started off with a bottle of a Chilean Cab Sauv for only $18.  Not too shabby.  Like I mentioned, I ordered Arthur's Burger with cheddar cheese.  My son ordered the chicken fingers with fries.  The burger was nothing to write home about.  It was really bland.  In fact, I would've been happier with a Big Mac from across the street.  I didn't even finish it.  Luckily, my son fell asleep, and had a few chicken fingers left.  I must say, the chicken fingers were really good.  It came with this honey-dijon sauce - which complimented the chicken fingers very well.  This is where the extra 1/2 star comes in.  Perhaps I should've just ordered one of their steaks but if you can't get a burger right, then what's the point.  For redemption, I made my own cheese burgers today - 80/20 beef chuck, kosher salt, pepper, and some worcestershire sauce.  They came out excellent....
2012-04-16,2,Came here and had the "Our Burger"--which is a regular burger with cheddar cheese, tomato, lettuce, cooked to order.I asked for it cooked medium and it came out well done (ugh). However, it was still fairly tasty for being overcooked. It came with a side of fries (which were really good). My coworker had the steak and potatoes. He destroyed his steak but barely touched his potatoes. He said they weren't seasoned well.Perhaps its because I didnt' expect much from this place which is why i shrugged the meal off. My colleague kept raving about the steaks and was so excited to come here. I wasn't in the mood for steak so when we sat down and I saw the rest of the menu I wasn't surprised. So I kept expectations low. It was just a typical tavern, with full bar. The server we had was nice.Maybe the steaks really are "that good" but i had a "meh" experience.
2012-04-06,2,I have been going to this place every couple of months for the last 10 years.. I recently found out that this place changed ownership..So I decided to drop in for steak, garlic bread & chilli, after not having been there in about 8 months.. I must tell all of you: A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! 1) THE STEAK:  The seasoning was off, from the usual awesome flavoring.  Additionally, as a few reviewers on here have mentioned, the meat was cooked unevenly.  One side was medium-rare, while the other was well-done.  It is also possible that the quality of the meat was slightly lower than what I remember, although I can't say with 100% certainty.  What I can say for sure though, is that the $7 increase in price of the steak, coupled with the dissapointing preparation, makes the trip out to Arthur's for its steaks, not worth the effort.2) THE CHILI: Not as tangy as before, but good.  What sucked was that they've cheapened up & no longer bring the shredded cheddar & cilantro in seperate plates so you can enjoy generous amounts.  Instead, they just garnish the top of the chili bowl with some cheddar & cilantro.3)  The GARLIC BREAD:  Not as garlicky as it used to be..Also, not enough oil in the bread.  This used to be my absolute favorite garlic bread in the world.  Unfortunately, times have changed. All in all, i'm sorry to say that I won't be going back.***BTW- Yelp has become a pathetic money maker for its founders..Their whole "softaware recommendation system" is B.S...The perfect example of this is when they leave your good to mediocre to great reviews, but "filter" out your bad ones.  This is inexcusable.  If it really wasn't about the money they're making off of these businesses, they would either filter you completely or not.  Having it both ways proves they're a bunch of hypocrites***
2012-03-24,3,My boyfriend had raved about how great the steak was at Arthur's so with a friend, we trekked over from the city.  We definitely did not get the memo that it was Hoboken's St. Patty's Day weekend so things were a bit different than they usually are at Arthur's (apparently. I wouldn't know, it was my first time.)They had printed out St. Patrick's Day menus & only served beer in plastic cups. It was so bizarre, I felt like I was still in college (granted I graduated in '11, but still!) It had taken awhile for any of our napkins or utensils to arrive to the table but after asking a nearby waiter, we finally got them.The garlic bread was SOOOO good! And basically gets it's own star out of the three for it.  As far as my steak? I asked for medium rare.. I got well done.  It was so well done that it was hard for me to cut it with the knife. I'm assuming it's because of it being St Patrick's Day and them going through an unusual amount of customers for the night (the restaurant wasn't even THAT busy at the time we had gone). The potato wedges were ehhh and I barely touched it.  I ate a little bit of the steak that wasn't nearly as cooked as most of the steak was and it was okay.  If we had known that Arthur's was going to be like THAT, we would've just stayed in the city! Two stars for the restaurant, one extra star for the garlic bread.
2012-03-22,2,We've been eyeing this place, n We've finally got a chance to stop by.Steak n Potatoes were okei...but they couldve done better.The Garlic Bread kinda made the night,it was awesome...
2012-03-18,3,It really depends on what you order.If you stick to steak, you cant go wrong.  Cant say the same for other dishes.The place is big, so there are a lot of available seats anytime.
2012-03-15,4,If you want a burger in Hoboken for the same price as 5 guys or Johnny Rockets, you can get a huge, well cooked and flavored burger with fries and toppings for about $11 here.  Arthurs rocks, its not even a competition.  The prices are rock bottom for most of the items as well if you want some variation.  They must own the building to keep prices so low.
2012-03-13,4,Arthur's is one of the best places to go if you are craving a big juicy steak burger! Of course, the steaks are amazing.. well seasoned and cooked to your liking. They also have an amazing Chili..Tons of beef, tons of cheese and the serving is very generous!
2012-03-04,5,I love this place. It is a classic new jersey establishment. Grew up in Morristown going to the one out there.   Excellent burgers and roast beef on rye. And the steak is one of the best I've had...don't get me wrong, I love a good $60 steak from del frriscos or Lugers, but this steak is so juicy and full of flavor, you forget you only paid 25 bucks for it.   Last month had 2 large gatherings with friends. We called ahead and asked for the smaller room in the back with its own bar. The restaurant hooked us up twice and treated us like royalty. Thanks Arthur's!
2012-02-20,3,came here for a birthday dinner with a large group of friends on a saturday evening in their private space upstairs.  the room itself is nothing fancy but surely spacy and comfortable, and frm wht i can see, pretty clean.the service was warm and friendly the entire evening.  frm the hostess to our waitress to our busboy.  very patient with a rowdy group might i also add.the food was average.  it wasnt phenomenal but no major complaints.  certainly economical if you are looking for decent food for decent prices.  the garlic bread however - is really over-rated tho: the loaf was topped with fresh grated parm but the center of the bread was plain.my only gripe was the temperature of my steak.  i asked for medium, and it came out not even medium rare but rare.  as a result of having to sending it back, it came back (as expected) cooked unevenly.  the potatoes accompaniment was very tasty tho - def the highlight of the entire meal.3.5 stars ~
2012-02-20,5,Hoboken has one of the best restaurant scenes in New Jersey, and there are plenty Bar & Grills where you can get a steak, but Arthur's Tavern has the best steak. I went to school a few blocks up from the place, and after my final exam every semester my friends and I would do a "Steak and Beer Day" at the tavern. Let's just say there was never a better way to mark the end of a long semester. A few things to remember when going there:1) Order the steak! The burgers are big and juicy, but Arthur's is all about the steak, and you should not miss the opportunity.2) Remember to order a side of potatoes with the steak, since they go together like bread and butter. 3) Get some beer!One problem that I found is that they have poor selection of beers on tap. Overall, this is a great place to go to.
2012-02-15,4,Good food for the price.  French onion soup was great and the petite filet w/ shrimp was really good.  Got sautéed mushrooms which were pretty good too. Overall, great deal for good food.
2012-02-11,4,Every time I go to Arthur's, I order one steak and garlic bread for party of two! Steak is big enough if you are not a huge steak fan~ most of times, there are plenty of seats as well~ i will go back for my steak!
2012-02-08,4,I've been here many times throughout the years. I love this place.The steak is good, the potatoes are great, and the ribs are amazing. A bit overpriced, I know, but it's great, nonetheless.The service is okay. Nothing to brag about.I like the way the place is set up. Although some may complain that it's too dark, I actually love the place more because of it. It's more cozy and homy that way. Overall, great place. I strongly recommend going there.
2012-02-06,1,Went here the other night for a retirement dinner, so we were in the upstairs party room. People at work who had been here before had opinions from the "greatest steakhouse ever" to "hit and miss".My take: MissGarlic bread: Awesome, the best part of the meal.Beer: Big and cold.Service: Okay.Salad: Lettuce with a tiny bit of cucumbers and tomatoes. Poor.Pickles and peppers: Okay.Steak and potatoes: Horrible. Ordered medium rare, got medium. It was all fat and gristle on the steak and the potatoes tasted nasty.Dessert: Retirement cake provided by the coworkers of the retiree. I won't be back.
2012-02-03,4,Best darned steakhouse near NYC for the price.  You absolutely cannot go wrong at Aurthur's.  I love that this place has been around since like Frank Sinatra was a little boy growing up in Hoboken, which was a long time ago.Everything in this place is delightful.  There is no bad choice of steak cut.  They're all good.  What's more, is that the wine list is so affordable, while the wines are still top notch.  Arthur's is for everyone.I try to drop into Aurthur's every time I'm in Hoboken.  I even make the trip all the way from Harlem sometimes.  It's that good and price-worthy.  Do it!
2012-01-25,1,As others have noted, it isn't what it used to be. Their burger is different (beefier or something, not as flavorful), now comes with forgettable fries, and they did raise the price. I ordered disappointing takeout a few weeks ago but gave them another chance with dine-in yesterday. Unfortunately, both of us got a little sick on our burgers. I used to have occasional cravings for an Arthur's burger; now I may not go back for the immediate future.
2012-01-24,3,I ate there last week. First thing i noticed was there was no specials board in the back room. Been coming here for 20 yrs. Board was gone. Next thing I noticed was the menu was changed! the 24oz steak just says OUR STEAK which i had to ask is this the 24oz steak? and the price went up AGAIN to $28. damn it use to be $24. before that it was $19. And the 48oz steak wasnt there. it was on a different specials menu. Shrimp cocktail not on the menu any more! i finally asked when did they make the changes. Apparently there are new owners or management. Ok a successful Tavern for so many years and the newbies make all these changes. I was thinking if they changed the steak too. New Flat Screen TVs. Place jujst looks different.Finally the steak came. Steak was just as good as before...but the Atmosphere is different. Stupid new OWNERS!!!! $28 for the steak is a bit pricey and just touches the higher price steak places whcih are better. $24 was great for what it was. but $28??? looks like i wont going back as often.really sucks with the changes. it use to be a great bargain.
2012-01-24,3,The garlic bread is fantastic and the steaks are hit or miss.  I do enjoy the potatoes, but for the same price, I could get a steak somewhere else that has a lot for flavor and consistency to it.  The steaks also come on the fatty side.
2012-01-21,4,I've been coming to this place now for 15 years!  I even got laid on a first date back in the day after we had too many Heinekens in Arthurs. lol.   Seriously though, great value for the price.   They give you a juicy, tasty, marbled 24 ounce steak for a little over $20.... in midtown,  this would easily set you back $50+    OK the decor isnt new and it doesnt come close to looking like one of the more famous fancy steakhouses in midtown, but if you're looking for a very good steak at a cheap price, this is the spot!    Hope to be coming back for another 15 yrs.
2012-01-03,1,The wait staff told us that Arthur's has been sold. For this reason, they've decide not to honor the "doubletakedeals" (i.e., Groupon-clone) we purchased even though the "new" business, in my opinion, looks to be riding on the coattails and goodwill of the former owners. (As far as I can tell, no new signage, etc.).  I would've thought buying a business and continuing to operate it in virtually the same manner meant succeeding to all its assets and liabilities (including gift certificates).As for the food, I generally enjoyed the meal.  My rare steak was not rare in all places (maybe 15% medium, 30% medium-rare) and was cold, as if it waited for some time before being delivered.  Oh well, it was still pretty good. In addition, it now looks like you have to request the free bowl of pickles.Part of the enjoyment of dining here was the feeling you were at a Hoboken institution that was more than just the sum of the food and service; it was about history etc.  Refusing to honor the promises of the business (which this is merely a continuing) ruins that feeling for me.  I don't feel like returning.
2011-12-26,2,They changed owners and it shows. Prices across the board went up roughly 15% and they changed there recipe for their hamburger. Shamefull!!! They sold out! I'm very distraught over this as the arthurs burger "was" my favorite! You suck!
2011-12-19,3,The Good:- HUGE Steaks!- Ribs that fall off the bone.  - AMAZING garlic bread. 5 orders please! (no, we seriously ordered 5 loaves) - Giant Mugs for Beer and Soda- Good for groupsThe bad:- $28 for an "affordable" steak? Ouch! - homefries? really?- french fries are not great- the mac and cheese side. While its huge, don't be fooled. This monstrosity of a side tastes like macaroni that has been glued together. Flavorless and off putting. - service. they forgot my friends fries. Instead of bringing him the order they forgot, they took his steak away to put his fries on the plate. - Grissle. Now dont get me wrong, I love a little animal fat, but when my steak is more fat than meat, i'm getting ripped off.  And probably diabetus. My dog was a grateful recipient of the grissley meat. The Ugly:- the decor. Suicidal? avoid this place for you will surely want to kill yourself in this dark, drab, and depressingly outdated restaurant.
2011-12-16,2,WARNING! It's changed hands! Count on no longer available.An old favorite is no more. The most affordable steak in town is now $27.95, was $20.95 The hamburger which was sizable, like American industry has undergone downsizing. Though still tasty, the burger which was $5.95 is now $8.95. Maybe 1/3 of a pound whereas it was 1/2 before.My beloved New Bedford scrod is no longer available. Yuengling is no longer available.The free cole slaw is no longer available.The large bowl of cole slaw was $2.95, now $3.95.Arthur's potatoes are still there...thank God...and a new addition, great French fries. The dill pickles and hot peppers are still thereService was okay, well-meaning  but familiar faces are no longer available.Still a decent and fun atmosphere. The only thing that really went upscale was the prices. Nevertheless, somewhat disappointing. The old Arthur's is no longer available. I try to take one day at a time, but sometimes several days attack me at once!
2011-12-15,1,Ain't what it used to be!For the last 5 years I have taken clients as well as buddies out for nights of great food and excellent service about every month or so. When I heard my beloved steakhouse changed hands I feared what might have become of it, but nonetheless took the usual tribe out for my birthday this past week. WHOA what a difference!My longing for the old Arthur's started as soon as we walked in. My group of 10 was crammed into 3 of the smaller tables against a wall in the back. While this time we were all close friends and this actually aided conversation, I could not see this being very comfy for the clients I generally take out.Going to a steakhouse, Arthur's especially, Killians Irish Red and Yuengling Lager have always been the two never-to-go-empty pitchers of choice. To all of our surprise, neither is served anymore at this Arthur's! I later found out that another large group out for the night had found this out the hard way and shared in our disappointment.The last and final straw for the new Arthur's was the food. There is no longer the welcoming bowl of pickles or slaw...and you can't even get them as a side! I LOVED that slaw! While Arthur's menu has always been very short on options (tried and loved everyone of them), the new menu is even smaller. And smaller yet are the new portions! The only complaint I've ever had with the old Arthur's (and never really minded) was the fact that I was torn with getting a doggy bag and bringing it back home before going out for the night or letting their delicious food go to waste. This time I was thankful there was birthday cake since I made the mistake of getting their Surf and Turf entree that consisted of a filet mignon nugget and three dainty shrimp on a skewer over bland rice. Here, I must say, my filet as well as all the steaks in my party were cooked to perfection and delicious as usual. However, the few that made of mistake of getting the burger (that good old huge Arthur's burger right?) were taken back by a little meager patty concentrically placed on the normal Arthur's bun!I looked forward to going to Arthur's every month and was proud to bring new friends and clients there to share in my enjoyment. However, I see myself looking for a new place for next month's outing.
2011-12-13,4,I have frequented this place many times. The burgers are very good and the service very efficient, but it can get a bit crowded, which is not a problem.  Come here if you want an authentic American meal without any pretenses.
2011-11-29,3,A mixed bag.Chili = 5 starBurger = 3 starSteaks = 1 starReasonable prices, giant liter beers and generally nice staff make it A-OK in my book.  While its worth it to check out (especially for the chili) ---Arthur's Tavern should NOT be your stop for steak!  Overcooked and flavorless all 3 times I've tried it.
2011-11-28,4,This is as good as it gets... How can you ask for anything more for the price?  Who pays $25 for 24 oz thick (like 1 inch) steak well prepared with seasoned potatoes, pickles, cole slaw and rice.  To top that, the bottle of wine prices are well priced around $20.If you are looking for high class, over priced NYC type of steak house, then this ain't your place but if you want a fun atmosphere, old school American steakhouse that serves true "meat and potatoes", then strap your boots and stop by for awesome steak.  I obviously had better steaks but did pay for it with $$$$$$$$. The restaurant is like a maze with additional seating in the back which also has a bar with TVs.  It is an interesting lay out but did not take away from the experience anyways.I must try their hamburger next time.... whoooooo.. cannot wait! BAM!
2011-11-26,2,Came here on a Friday night after Thanksgiving. Place was busy but had a good vibe -- laid back and noisy (in a good way). Ordered burgers and home fries. Burgers were really nothing special -- meat was good but buns were dry and there was no lettuce or tomato. Fries were very greasy. Also, we were finishing dinner when a mouse ran out from an adjacent table.Overall would not recommend.
2011-11-07,4,Finally made it to Arthur's Tavern for the first time.  I had heard good things and it did not disappoint.This has a great old school feel to it, especially with the checkerboard tablecloths.  They bring you pickles and coleslaw to start with.  We started with an order of the garlic bread which was delicious.I had the burger and the potatoes (more like hash browns) and both were very good.  I had some of the steak that my companions could not finish.  I'm usually a filet guy as I don't like a ton of fat in my steak.  But the steak was excellent and I will be getting that the next time I go.All in all it was a great meal.  I left stuffed and the bill was very reasonable.  I look forward to coming back!
2011-10-29,4,First a word about the service.  They were so accommodating as we were a party of 12 on a busy Friday night and long after we were done and the plates were cleared away, they allowed us to remain.  Kudos to both our server Michelle for everything she did, and to Chris the Bartender for helping to brighten our pre-dinner drinks.As long you you keep in mind that this is not Peter Luger's or Sparks or whatever your great steakhouse of choice is, then Arthur's a really good place to eat.  As Gary said, it may not be Peter Luger's quality but it is 1/2 the price.  Portions are extremely large and the prices are very reasonable.  For the first time there, I had the scrod and I really enjoyed it.  In fact, everyone seemed to enjoy their meals.  Most had steak and many had leftovers.    My only complaint was I didn't have a pickle or sour tomato because Ray refused to pass me the bowl but that's no reflection on the restaurant.
2011-10-18,5,There's 3 things about me: I love a deal, I love steak, and I love having ALOT of steak. $25 bucks gets you a 24 oz steak with a shi* load of potatoes. You'll also get coleslaw and that red crap that nobody eats. The steak itself is as good as it gets for $25 bucks. Not super delicious, but it's good. It's one of those steaks i can't eat on it's own, i have to kill it in A1 SAW-CE. (Epic meal time reference for you noobs)If you're like me and you can handle your meat, get the 48 oz. I guarantee you'll either want to throw up afterward, or  feel lethargic. For Arthur Steakhouse occasions i suggest wearing sweatpants, 1 size larger deep Vneck t-shirt, and flip flops. Buttons will hold you back, so sweatpants will keep you nice and classy and feeling loose. The deep V-neck isn't deep enough unless it's down to your navel.With a V so deep you won't have to worry about hanging any napkins on your shirt, just wipe away the stains as they land on your chest or belly. The flip flops is just in-case you sweat while you eat, nothing worse than feeling full with sweaty feet!
2011-10-09,4,GREAT STEAKS...POTATOES ARE AMAZING, and the beer?  DAMN. I've never seen a $7 beer the size of my face before.Me and my friends came here after a day hitting balls off the driving range.    After some rest, we decided to go to Hoboken to this place, because we were all craving steak.  My friends said this was the best steak restaurant in Hoboken, and that you're tour of Hoboken is not complete w/out coming here.  They were right.At first, my friends ordered some beer.  Funny thing was the girls ordered the beer while the guys got water.  When the beer came...DAMN. Let's just say, when u would start to drink it, it looked like ithe cup automatically refilled itself.  No joke.Then we had the steak.  My first bite and i knew, i was gonna come out of this place with a full stomach and end up writing a great review for this place...which is what this is.  Potatoes were boss too.Only thing that i'd have to say is that the tables were a little too close together.  Other than that, one of my friends said the tablecloths reminded him of a "picnic blanket" ...which it kind of did considering our food came with slaw.  EAT AT ARTHUR'S TAVERN NOW!
2011-10-05,3,I remember when 24oz steaks were $12.90 in this spot.24oz steaks.  $12.90.  That shit was craaaaazy!Its not that cheap anymore.  Not even close.The salad was a half a head of lettuce, ugh. The complimentary pickles were tasty.The steaks are still fatty...very fatty.  Like if you bite into the wrong part, you'll be either chewing for 10 minutes or spittin it into your napkin.This spot is still packed every night.
2011-10-04,5,Arthur's Tavern is a laid back steakhouse a couple of minutes away from the Holland Tunnel. I've been here three times and each time the food and service was consistent. It's all about the garlic bread, chili, and steaks! Arthur's is known best for their 24 oz steak for $24.95. Great value - everything on the menu excluding the steaks are under $20. A thick Delmonico cut, some complain about the fat but I don't mind it. I could never finish it especially with the side of potatoes so I bring it back and make steak sandwiches the next day. The side of potatoes is okay; a little more crunch wouldn't hurt. The garlic bread and chili deserves a paragraph of its own. The garlic bread is warm, buttery, and garlicky. I could eat a loaf by myself... but I don't because I need to leave room for the chili. The bowl of chili is filling and comforting. Topped with tons of cheese and chopped scallions. So beefy. So chunky. So homey. You won't see any liquid here. What would've made this chili perfect is a slow, creeping heat of cayenne.A couple more dishes worth mentioning: Arthur's also cooks a mean 1 1/4 pound lobster for $18.95 with side of potatoes. Only downhill is there are no corns to be found. The full rack of bbq ribs is mouth-watering as well. For a tavern, the ribs are worth every penny. The French onion soup is great too. Not the best but better than most places. I like this place a lot. It's similar to J&R's steakhouse. FYI - Don't be afraid to celebrate your birthday here. The back room can fit a party of 30+!

2011-09-21,3,Good steak and garlic bread. Not a great selection of steaks.
2011-09-21,3,Went here last night for the first time and I enjoyed it.  I am including my man's thoughts in my review as he eats meat and I do not, and Arthur's is a steakhouse.  I give this place 3 stars but my he gives it 2 stars because he didn't like the potatoes that came with his steak and thought he cooks a better steak himself at home.  I liked the staff and the casual atmosphere of the restaurant and we both liked the coleslaw and pickles starters.    The menu is fairly simple, which is nice.  To start we had the Caprese Salad, which was a good size to share and good quality for $8.00.  Not the best mozzarella, but good quality.  We also had an order of the garlic bread which was soft, delicate, and yummy.  I liked the garlic bread but my man thought it was only ok.  He had the 24 oz steak, which he thought was not seasoned and he cooks better at home.  I had the Shrimp Scampi which was served with a side of rice.  I thought the dish was good, nice amount of bread crumbs on top and good size shrimp.  Overall I was happy with trying this place, but I don't think we'll be back because of how my man felt about the steak.
2011-09-17,3,Been here last year and although the service was good, the food was "meh"..In previous years it was all the rage, even had my company private christmas party here and the food use to be great then. They have slacked off and its ashame.
2011-09-15,5,Reading a number of these other reviews it is quite clear that a lot of people do not understand Arthur's. Arthur's is about one thing - STEAKS. These are simply the best STEAKS - the best prepared - the best cooked - the best tasting - the best STEAKS period end of story slam dunk wham bam case closed finito that's a wrap.All these other comments about service, atmosphere, the quality of the tables and chairs, how crowded it is, the noise level, the wait for a table, etc ~ all totally miss the point. Arthur's is about STEAKS.Not steak salad, french onion soup, the ribs, the burgers, the lobster, the big liter mugs of brew --- these are all very nice things too. Arthur's is about STEAKS. Gentlemen (and Lady afficianados of a delicious slab of wonderful beef goodness) make every effort to have a STEAK at Arthur's before you die. You will not regret it.
2011-09-11,3,Went hiking for a few hours, and the thought of steak at Arthur's Tavern helped pull us through Breakneck Ridge.1. Food: Might as well not have anything else on the menu besides their steak.  All of us got the 24 oz. monsters, and they were cooked accurately: rare, medium rare, and medium.  The rest of my seven friends raved about the potatoes that came with the steak.  French onion soup, oh so delicious the first spoonful, and nasty the rest of the bowl with its cheesy abundance and salty soup base.  The best thing was the garlic bread.  Arrived moist and steamy, with as much buttery and garlicky yumminess as my heart desired.  So, large portions, and great value.2. Atmosphere: Very bustling and casual tavern.3. Service: Good.
2011-09-08,3,My friend recommended this place to us. I like its garlic bread and steak. My friend is fan of their rib. I think the rib is a little bit sweet for me. We three shared one steak, one rib and one garlic bread. It is not recommended to share there, because you may be charged additional fee. However, it is recommended to explain the waitor previously, if you really need to share with your friends, which might help you to save some money.
2011-09-06,4,Went went to Arthur's really not knowing what to expect as I've heard good and bad.  After eating there last night I can tell you the food is very good, large portions, but basically in a bar.  You sit at small tables in a large and sometimes loud atmosphere.Service was mediocre, but overall the food is good.  And that is ultimately why I give it 4 starts.
2011-09-04,3,My friend was dying to show us this place bc she was a huge fan of it, and I had heard great things.Went here on a Saturday night and with 5 of us, were seated right away, inside [It was too humid out] We sat in a little cove area, which we liked because it felt private.Our waitress was very sweet and attentive.The slaw and pickles they bring you when you sit were good.We ordered 2 appies for the table: Nachos & Cheese Garlic Bread.I never care for nachos, but they were tasty.The garlic bread: YUM!HOWEVER... 3 of us [the girls] ordered the Steak caesar salad. Mine medium; the other 2, well done.I barely touched my salad, unfortunately. Steak was VERY red [like rare], the caesar dressing was extremely oily, and the salad just didn't look that fresh. Even the girls who ordered well done got their meat very red.Luckily, the waitress and manager were kind of enough to remove 2 salads from the bill, which was very generous and much appreciated. [BTW:  I HATE complaining to management; it makes me very uncomfortable, especially because I am born and raised in the restaurant industry, so I know what it's like to be on the other side.]
2011-08-30,3,no lengthy review needed.  decent steak for a great price.  If you have a sudden steak craving, head over to any arthur's.  Your stomach and wallet will be pleased.
