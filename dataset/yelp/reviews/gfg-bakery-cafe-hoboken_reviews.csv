2021-09-25,1,We used to love coming here. Today we came in and we were told they don't have any menus, to just pick what we wanted from their limited selection. We did this and I proceeded to ask if they still did omelets. The answer was yes, but they didn't have a menu so to just tell them what to make. I asked for a 3 ingredient egg white omelette. What I received was a regular omelette with one of the three ingredients I asked for. The rest of the omelette is made up of other ingredients I didn't ask for, including some citrus dressing on the omelette which was really not good. The heated up food we ordered was served at room temperature, not even close to being hot. My iced coffee was fine, but my husband's frappe was terrible (mind you, we used to come here just for the frappes!). On top of the food being subpar, we also struggled to find a table, as the vast majority of them were dirty. My daughter required a high chair which I also had to sanitize because it was covered in grease and food. Lastly we had $35 in rewards from the GFG loyalty program which apparently they no longer honor. I'm guessing this place changed owners because everything has just gone completely downhill. We won't be coming back.
2021-08-30,5,Always a hit! Haven't been here in some time but I love the coffee, where I found it was just " ok" before. It's mild but rich and the food is always so good. I tried the egg and avocado toast with feta and it was perfect. I would go back for sure. Kudos to the pretty blonde girl today!
2021-08-23,4,I wound up only ordering a coffee on my visit to GFG Bakery Cafe, which I can say was rich and robust.  I was also impressed by their selection of lunch and breakfast items, offering much more than simple pastries.  From avocado toast to Greek yogurt parfaits to sandwiches, there was really something for everyone.  I will need to go back to see what I missed!
2021-08-23,1,This place was so different when it first opened (you can even tell from the management's Yelp responses that they cared) but then something went south badly. I remember another stale food experience from 2019 after which I decided not to give them a second chance. But I did recently, only bc I missed spanakopita. How can a so-called Greek establishment make spanakopita this lifeless is beyond me. Not even heating saved its poor soul. And what happened to the baklavas, may be they are out of a can too -like GFG's lifeless stuffed grape leaves are. You can only sell this food to people who do not know what a decent spanakopita, feta cheese borek, baklava or stuffed grape leaves taste like (in reality). The owners are so out of it that they even picked the worst dolma in the entire canned dolma market -all rice (which was also dry) and no onions or spices. I'm still grieving every single dollar I spent here 10 days ago, should have never given them a second chance.
2021-08-21,5,This place is legit amazing. Plenty of space, even during covid to sit apart and their bakery selection is top notch. I tired a bunch of their pies and pastries and I honestly loved them all, even the basic cheese pastry. Definitely coming back next time!
2021-07-09,1,Note to owner its 80 degrees outside and about 80 inside your establishment and you don't have your AC on great job!!! Was gonna work from my laptop and enjoy a lunch but after sweating my ass off for an hour I left!
2021-06-02,5,Delicious food and really friendly staff. Highly recommend! Their spinach pie is the best.
2021-05-16,5,We came 5 minutes before close and their employee (most likely the manager?) was SO accommodating and kind to us! Made amazing drinks and pulled out all the stops. The selections of desserts and artisanal breads are outstanding. I definitely recommend going for delicious coffee drinks, amazing pastries and absolute top notch service. Our interaction with the staff alone made our night!
2021-04-03,4,Greek from Greece.  The BIG advantage for this place is its nearness to the W Hoboken.  I saw in one review that one person thought it was 3 blocks ~ well~ in reality, it is around the corner and a few steps.  You don't leave the block and don't have to cross any streets.  They serve breakfast sandwiches and other breakfast food and lunch type foods, also.  If you are staying at the W Hoboken, you don't get breakfast and the restaurant doesn't open until 11, which makes this place an easy choice.  I can't imagine that this works for the business clientele.It is open and clean, tables spaced.  You place your order and they bring the food to your table.  Ask to see a menu because everything they serve is not on display.  Now, the first day our order took an incredibly long time ~ no explanation offered.  Second visit was much more reasonable as far as length of time we waited for our food.If you are craving Greek pastry, this is your place.
2021-03-27,5,So finally I found a place that has almond milk with NO added sugar lol. Struggle is real when you have food restrictions so I really really appreciate places like this :). The guy who works here was so helpful and checked packages for me to make sure there is no sugar added and he made me the best late :). My husband had a honey walnut cookie and he says it was amazing ... well I wouldn't know lol. Looks really clean and they have gluten free options as well. Will be back :).
2021-03-05,5,Service was amazing the guys here are so sweet ! I enjoyed my coffee the inside is so cute , a good meeting place and prices are good for coffee the pastries seemed a bit high but oh well ! Nice place
2021-01-25,4,Cool spot, good coffee, Greek pastries, sandwich and salad, awesome tea selections, and sissy's efficient service here. Must have been our 7th visit on the last 2 trips.  Just about 3 blocks from the W Hoboken.
2021-01-06,4,TLDR: Greek cafe with many sweet and savory options, also has wifi and outlets. Spacious and clean. Would love to come back and try more! There's also a rewards program if you're a frequent customer.Wednesday Breakfast (8:30am-12:30pm)Table for 2~~~~~FOOD~~~~~*spanakotiropita (~$7?)- Larger size than I expected!- They toast it before serving, so it's nice and warm. The phyllo dough had a little crunch on the outside, but was not overly flakey and falling apart, so I enjoyed it- Tasty and good for a light breakfast or snack, but kept me full for the whole time I was there- Halfway through, I sliced through paper and realized there was some parchment paper stuck underneath that had not been removed. Extra nutrition!*iced mocha w/oat milk ($5+)- I usually can't finish coffee drinks, so the fact that I finished this must mean something :)- Other milk options available for my fellow lactose intolerants (although I did eat cheese in my pastry)~~~~~AMBIANCE~~~~~- Clean, spacious, and bright- Quiet for the most part, they do play (clean) pop music and noise level is also subject to the customers present- Felt like your average cafe- Was able to stay here for 4 hours and do some work and saw the place get  busy, but never felt overcrowded~~~~~SERVICE~~~~~- We were greeted by the cashier once we came in- The only menu I saw was for drinks, so you can look at their menu online or go through all their pastries and see what you'd like- After we ordered, the workers went to prep the food/drinks and I awkwardly stood there before going back to my table (located near the register). And they ended up bringing the food to us!~~~~~CLEANLINESS~~~~~- Automatic hand sanitizer dispenser at the door- Plexi glass at the register- Disinfecting wipes on top of the trash and recycle bins- Plastic wrapped/packaged utensils at the front- Bathrooms looked clean for the most part. The one on the left has a diaper changing station, and the one on the right has a broken lock- Masks are required and are also worn by workers, although I did see one of the workers behind the register have their mask pulled down under their chin
2020-12-31,5,We stopped in for breakfast this morning while staying at the W.We had a surprising enjoyable breakfast of coffee, fresh OJ, avocado toast with feta and Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon. The food was expertly prepared and presented nicely. We took home some Baklava....and glad we did. Highly recommended not only for the great food, but the polite and friendly service.
2020-11-13,5,I stopped in for takeout lunch and ordered a chicken pita gyro and the manager(?) was so cool. Asked if I wanted anything else and I was browsing the dessert displays. I asked if he recommended any of them, and he came around the counter and went through all ~15 options. Ended up giving me a baklava with Nutella inside for free as a really nice gesture. It was delicious. Thank you for the treat and great service.
2020-10-13,5,My latte was delicious and the staff was very efficient and friendly.
2020-07-20,5,This place is simply amazing..we go every morning for their fresh iced coffee and amazing bakery items. The staff are always super welcoming and food always fresh. 5 stars all around!
2020-07-12,5,Great desserts, nice and friendly staff. Beautiful decor. Many sweet & savory snacks. Highly recommend!
2020-05-17,5,I'm so happy they are open!!!!   I love their pies and coffees.  Cheese pies, sweet cream pies or spinach pies.  They have salads and desserts too. The baristas are always so kind.  This place is huge so you have plenty of space to go in order your food and take it to go with out worrying about coming close to anyone.
2020-03-08,1,Don't go here with young kids on a Saturday. One female worker on the shorter side with darker skin, really couldn't have been ruder. Came in with my husband, 4 month old & 2 year old. My 4 month old was asleep and my 2 year old who wasn't really misbehaving but exploring. One female worker was extremely rude to us. She basically glared at us the entire time. I have never felt like this in an establishment in Hoboken in the 8 years we have lived here. We will never go back and I don't advise going with children.
2020-01-30,3,Good space.  However, had an awful breakfast sandwich.  It was cold; The cheese wasn't melted.  It was just a slab of cheese right out of the fridge.  Egg was cold.
2020-01-25,4,If you want warm food, the best value are the flatbreads. I recommend the spinach. They're already made and are just warmed up in the oven. You can be in and out in 5 minutes.
2020-01-17,5,GFG has something for every craving! I recommend from here the green smoothie - it is a big portion for only $8 and includes a mix of fruits and veggies.
2019-12-30,5,I found this place while I was trying to find an open place to have some coffee and baked goods around Hoboken. I was not expecting to find something THAT good, but this place is gonna be my new favorite! They have variety of scrumptious pastries as well as salads, sandwiches, and traditional Greek food! We tried their fresh orange juice, spanakopita, cheese pie, leek pie, galaktoboureko, chocolate pie, dolma (stuffed grape leaves), and yogurt parfait. We were that hungry, and could not resist lmao. Everything was just soo pleasant-tasting, except for the chocolate pie. Chocolate pie was not that fresh. It was the last piece on the tray, probably it was sitting there since a bit, so it was dry. We just could not eat it. But everything else was really good, and fresh, and the staff was very friendly, so we did not want to complain. It is negligible, it happens everywhere. They have plenty of seating. It is perfect for group gathering. It is a spacious place. They have something for everyone. Ps: Wifi, high chairs, baby changing stations available.
2019-12-24,5,Amazing- Baklava Nirvana! I have entered Heaven when I walked thru the doors of GFG in Hoboken- my New Happy Place (good thing that it's not around the corner) or I would be camping out there! Service is extraordinary- gorgeous space - very large and welcoming- amazing deserts & coffees!
2019-12-14,5,I ordered a spinach - cheese fillo dough, potato fillo dough and Mediterranean fillo dough. I also ordered a baklava and a konafa. ALL WERE SO SO SO MOUTHWATERING! Staff is really really sweet!!!! I am really glad I stopped by this place on the way to Albany!
2019-11-28,5,Staying around the corner looking for breakfast on Thanksgiving, and I'm thankful this place was open!  Big selection of pastries and breakfast sandwiches, and great coffee options.  I got the East Coast breakfast sandwich and it was delicious.  Great value and excellent friendly service!  Highly recommend.
2019-11-25,1,Not sure what happened to this place since my last visit over the summer!  Saturday I purchased the worst breakfast I've ever had.The New Yorker breakfast sandwich was advertised as egg, turkey bacon and avocado on a brioche bun sounds awesome except it was actually served on a stale hamburger bun!I ordered an iced vanillla latte and received a watered down ice coffee.Disgraceful ended up throwing both in the trash.
2019-11-14,5,Excellent food and excellent service !!!  The place is immaculately clean !!!! The food was so fresh and authentic . The staff especially the guy who makes the coffee was so nice and informative ! The cashiers were very friendly and upbeat . I had a wonderful experience here .
2019-09-30,2,I went here for lunch, because I was under the impression they had fresh made salads. I arrived and the salad was prepackaged and overpriced. I paid $15 for a salad and water. It wasn't horrible but  I wouldn't come back. Customer service was great and the place is very clean.
2019-09-26,5,Was pleasantly surprised how amazing GFG Bakery is! It is a cool market-like cafe with tons of options of Greek food. I ordered a spanakopita and a chocolate bougatsa. The spanakopita was to die for! The bougatsa was very delicious too. I ordered these on grub hub and was surprised how large they were, so I definitely recommend sharing! I highly recommend checking out GFG in Hoboken!
2019-09-22,5,Amazing place. Great service. Wide space. But the manager, ALLVIS, is the best. When he manages a floor, he's very passionate and dramatic about his service. It's like an action movie, and he's Arnold Schwarzenegger, killing the packed lunch crowd effortlessly. He's an amazing human being, a super hero we didn't deserve, but we nevertheless have. ALVIS, this one's for you... S 'agapó maláka.
2019-09-15,4,Amazing coffee and dessert!  Love the ambience and the warm accommodating personality of who I assume is the owner of the place.  Staff could use a bit of training with customer service.  I was given the wrong coffee few times and was charged twice with my iced mocha due to the fact that they weren't paying too much attention to what order goes to who.  He didn't hesitate to fix it for me and gave me a refund.  Other than that, I will definitely come back for lunch time to try their Greek food.  Can't wait!
2019-08-20,4,GFG is more than a cafe -- it's almost like a miniature Greek food hall. There are a variety of sweet and savory offerings, plus a coffee bar and a frozen yogurt station. You can even buy packaged Greek goods here. There are lots of different Greek sweets like baklava and orange cakes, and a plethora of sweet and savory Greek pies. The spinach and feta pie is out of this world. A pie is $7 and comes with a very large piece. If you aren't feeling a pie but want something savory they also have sandwiches, salads and pizzas. I've only ever stopped in for spinach pie and coffee, but would certainly love to come back and try more. They also have a ton of indoor and outdoor table space plus wifi. If I lived closer I'd probably work from here all of the time!
2019-08-16,5,This place is awesome with amazing staff! David, Missy, Alvis and all other staff all amazingly welcoming friendly people! They have become the major reason why I go to GFG to grab lunch!
2019-07-10,1,Avocado club was so dry... bacon was like rubber and no good taste only good thing was the avocado..waste of money
2019-06-13,4,YUM. GFG has tons of options to choose from and I am here for them. The amount of options pushed me out of my comfort zone, so I chose pastries I normally wouldn't. I was very happy with my choices and I absolutely plan on coming back.
2019-06-12,4,Hmmm. Awhile ago (one year), I forgot my wallet and they let me away with it. Since then, I have been a loyal customer, I typically get their pastries and do my work in the large open air seating they have available. I would give this place a try especially if you have not been. It is usually occupied by the employees of the surrounding offices. Having been to multiple areas of Greece and trying food extensively, I had an expectation for the quality of the food I was ordering. With that said, the cleanliness is very good. I noticed the manager/owner is very proactive on keeping the restaurant tidy.
2019-06-03,5,GFG Bakery might be reason enough to move to Hoboken. Now, before you call me crazy, you have to try the baklava. I'm pretty sure I could eat it every day the rest of my life.The philo is perfect- golden, flaky and fresh - then you have the ooooey goooooeyness - the spices and honey are the perfect mix of sweet and flavorful without overpowering! Simply, wow!
2019-05-29,3,I arrived early for my meeting in Hoboken and I wanted to get a coffee and a muffin/bagel and kill 30 minutes.  Since I'm not a fan of the major chain coffee shops, I decided to stop here since I parked close by.  It's a very large trendy, upscale, bakery with many Greek options.  The staff was very friendly and the ambiance was inviting.  I ordered a medium hot coffee and a cinnamon roll.   As a coffee snob, I thought the coffee was dirty water.  I couldn't drink it and I didn't.  The cinnamon roll was warm and tasty.  I ended up a major coffee chain after all.  Other than the wet wash cloth on the floor near my table, the place was spotless. The bathroom was spotless.  For a morning rush hour, it wasn't getting the foot traffic that the other places might be getting so I'm a bit concerned.  It's a large space and rent can't be cheap.  I'll be back to try one of those great looking Greek desserts but I'll skip the coffee.  The overall experience was better than my coffee.
2019-05-01,1,This is typically a place a would like - specialty coffee, healthy food options, open and airy. But.. the food is bad and the coffee is not good. I've twice thrown out food I brought to the office. Once - a fruit cup that was rotten and once a parfait that was "off". I go out of my way to avoid this place. One positive: really good OJ.
2019-04-22,3,The food here is okay (not the best Greek I've ever had, but not horrible either). However, this review is more about the place itself. I went in once with a friend who guided me through the ordering process, and we dined in. I just went in again today for take-out - for a simple piece of spinach pie - but I found the ordering process to be very annoying. When you walk up to the front, there are 3 or 4 different counters to choose from... "meals," "coffee," "baked goods" and maybe a 4th too. I got on line near the "meals" counter, but realized I should probably be near "baked goods." I went over to that area and stood by the sign that said "line forms here." Simple, right? Well, the girl behind the counter (literally, right in front of me) didn't even look at me, and instead, called a customer from the "coffee" line. I was thinking maybe she didn't see me, so I was patient and kept waiting. Then I knew for sure she saw me, but proceeded to say "can I help you?" again to another person from the "coffee" line who had to cut over diagonally to place an order with her. At that point, I stepped forward and said "excuse me, am I missing something? is this where the line forms for a spinach pie?" The girl then agreed that I was in the right spot, and asked me for my order instead of the customer she previously called up. I was honestly just confused and annoyed. If there are separate counters for different items, then call the customers who are in the proper line. Don't cut across to other lines and ignore the people waiting right in front of you! The food isn't great enough to make me want to go back in this place and deal with the stupidity again.
2019-04-15,4,I'm all for any place I can grab a frappe and baklava with ease. And it is OFFICIALLY frappe season. This place is big and beautiful and spacious so I like to sit and enjoy my coffee for a bit rather than take it on the go. And like most other Greek casual spots, they also have a little store where you can pick up your Greek teas and coffee mixes to take home with you. If you've never had a frappe, you've gotta just go right now. It's a Greek iced coffee basically. It's made with instant coffee that is blended with a bit of water to make a very frothy top. After you have enough foam you add milk and sugar and you have the perfect summer drink. I can seriously drink them exclusively when the weather is warm. The staff is all very friendly, the space is clean and there are a lot of options. For literally everything, but especially desserts. I've only gone a few times and never for anything more than a coffee and pastry, but love that that's become an option in Hoboken. I love weekends in Hoboken and have loved them even more since GFG became part of the neighborhood.
2019-04-14,5,First time here. Love the open space inside. Love the decor. Music is a bit loud. The layout is great. Ordered a cafe latte with almond milk. It's very good. It has a nice roasty flavor. The foam is yummy too. The food looks good but we haven't tried any yet. We will definitely return to try more from here. Price was $10.03 for the two lattes with almond milk; average for the area. Clean inside. Kasper made our lattes; he's very friendly. Good service. We were greeted right away. There's a large window so you can see them prepare the foods. Nice place
2019-04-01,2,Great food and atmosphere. I've never been to this restaurant before, because I am visiting from out of town. The set up is kind of confusing if it's your first time. The staff were rude to me when I tried asking how it worked. You would think something like this would have more instructions instead of figuring it out for yourself.
2019-03-28,3,Chicken Basil Aioli Sandwich - YUCK!  0 stars.  description says: "Marinated chicken breast grilled to perfection over crisp romaine, ripe tomato, yogurt basil pesto, on a rustic ciabatta." - BS!  tomatoes were wilted, lettuce was limp.  Chicken was disgusting, rubbery, yuck.  +1 star because the salad was better+1 star because the Baklava and Walnut Cake were goodI might try this place again and go for the traditional pies for lunchOrdered delivery and it showed up quick, too quick, probably b/c everything was pre-made that morning.
2019-03-05,5,Really good and fast service. Delicious options and a lot to choose from. Definitely would recommend.
2019-02-28,2,I was excited when this place opened because I love Greek food! Their spinach and leek pies are large, but bland. On a second visit I tried a Greek salad here a few years ago and was surprised that they didn't mix in the salad dressing (oil & vinegar) but rather served it on the side. I decide to give them another chance. This third visit, I found the Greek salad cost more ($9.50), and they still serve the dressing on the side. There are no spices in the dressing, so it too is bland. Drinks are pricey, with mostly sodas to drink. Not very healthy. Wish I had better things to say.
2019-02-16,3,The spinach pie is so tasty, definitely a must!  It seems pricey, but it is very filling.  We've tried a few other items but nothing was standout, so I'd definitely try the spanokopita! Great space. Very open and airy.  Lots of room where you don't feel like your joining the table next to you like other cafes in town. Room for improvement: the employees carry on full blown conversations with one another throughout your entire ordering process. I have been going here since they first opened, and it's always the same.  I am bilingual but most people wouldn't think that I speak Spanish based on my looks, and I have heard some crazy things being talked about while I was in there!
2019-02-14,5,This is my favorite Greek place in NJ! All products are fresh and the place is very clean!Authentic Greek pies and desserts! The cheese pie is the best I've ever tried in the US...it's like homemade pie! Everything is delicious!
2019-02-09,4,During a recent work trip we kept passing this Bakery but didn't stop in until the end of our trip.  I wish I had stopped in more often.  If your like me then for breakfast your looking for avacado toast with an over medium egg Simple yet delicious!  It also has a wide assortment of desserts from macarons to brownies.
2018-12-30,4,Been here 3-4 times. Nice and quiet on weekends. Plenty of room for kids to run around while you grab a coffee, desert or a bite. Deserts are good and Pies are also delicious! Worth a try.
2018-12-13,5,Very lovely cafe. Its has a really chilling atmosphere and very good service. For me as European it is as clean as I would expect a good restaurant to be :) I'm German and I love it.
2018-12-06,5,Just picked up some breakfast here and it was so good had to leave this quick review. Great food but above that the patient friendly customer service will make me come back time and again. Even though staying in hotel this time nearby - any trip to the area will get my patronage to gfg!
2018-11-26,5,Ambiance: 10/10- it's HUGE and has plenty of table space to sit or work on. I was incredible surprised by how BIG this place was. There are little station around the place like for coffee, gelato, baked goods, various foods and you can go to any of those areas and grab whatever you want. Food: 10/10- everything tasted like it was freshly baked that morning and for a place this big, I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting the normal kept for a while goods. In addition, nothing is overpriced. You'd expect high prices considering that the location is so close to the waterfront but I felt like I paid the right price for everything I got. They also had berry cheesecake, matcha goodies & so much more! Coffee: 10/10 - the venti at Starbucks is the same size as their large here but for a whole $1 cheaper! Why in the world would I ever go back to Starbucks now if they have the same size for a lower price and just as good coffee?! They had a variety in roasts as well as with syrups and I was incredibly satisfied. Service: 10/10 - I asked for suggestions on the baked goods and everyone working at the moment took the time out to tell me what they enjoyed at 9 am on a Sunday. I've usually found that service at any place on an early Sunday morning isn't great but GFG and its workers did NOT disappoint. Overall: 10/10 - loved it, will be back & will bring more people for sure!
2018-11-13,1,My problem with this place is the service and the bad attitude of the cashier. The woman taking my order was rude and acted like I was bothering her by ordering some pastries. For the savory food I ordered, she tossed it in a bag without offering to heat it up or asking if I was to-stay or to-go. Really terrible experience especially since so many places around town have such great service.
2018-10-31,5,I'm reviewing the Manhattan location (Hell's Kitchen). The Bougatsa is amazing and I had a refreshing frappe. Really great people - the Manager (?) Stavros was super friendly, talking about Greece. Highly recommend - great food, great people, amazing atmosphere!!
2018-10-27,3,Okay don't get me wrong- the space is gorgeous. Totally stunning.Stopped in for pastries and coffees and the set up is just confusing. All the pastries are displayed in the middle of the cafe but it's not self serve? No signage that says "order here" "pickup here@ it was just confusing. Pastries were good, it's just not at the top of my list.
2018-10-09,5,Best Bakery ever!! The Spinach pie and the Freddo Cappuccino Coffee were delicious and highly recommended!!!! The staff was friendly with a nice attitude, which is very rare nowadays.
2018-10-09,3,Tasty Treats&Sucky Service. You'll find randomly delicious food but not everything is a winner. So keep trying different stuff. I'm only ever there for a mid morning snack around 10/10:30am but have always gotten bad service. It's either the same rude woman or a collection of new hires that never seem to know exactly what to do. Ask for something toasted and they put it in the toaster oven for exactly 15 seconds. In the colder months, my pastry is always cold in the middle by the time I get to eat it and in the summer I'm lucky if it's even warmed at all. And when I did say something about it I only got attitude. Really sad. So I've been going less and less.
2018-10-08,3,I have stopped by several times in hopes of it being better but ehh my first time there i was overwhelmed by the amount of displays not sure if I'd miss an area asked the person behind the counter for sandwich recommendations she sold me on the priciest item saying it was the best seller and it fell short nothing special some of their pastries are okay others are good i think the people behind the counter need better training because they have difficulty describing items when asked what something is or what its made of some items i agree with other reviews are overpriced others seem fair
2018-09-26,4,Delicious Greek food and fresh bakery ! Didn't try the beautiful baked goods as nothing gluten free..
2018-08-17,3,Stopped in for lunch. Walk up counter and select what is behind the glass. A lot of savory pastries however, there is no description what is inside.  Big selection but you are guessing what's inside.  Fortunately it was not busy so the counter staff explained each one.  Big waste of time.Made my selection to go. Outrageously expensive for the portion size.  However the food was pretty good. Probably would not return for lunch because of the cost.  But stop back for the desserts. They look really good.
2018-08-09,1,Never have I ever had such an offensive experience as this one with staff members saying Ni Hao at me and laughing over and over again unprompted. My heritage isn't a joke and you shouldn't treat it as one. Extremely unprofessional and traumatizing experience. Not coming back ever and warning others of this terrible experience.
2018-07-23,5,The best bakery in town!They have a huge selection of traditional greek pies.I tried the yogurt pie and their famous freddo espresso coffee!Everything was exceptional. I was told that they have already one location in the city and that more are coming.Good job
2018-07-21,4,I loved the staff here ! I was spoken to in French, then English, then a touch of Italian...but no Greek! (Which is perfect, because I don't remember any of the Greek I learned in school)The Greek salad I had here was simple but tasty. The tomatoes were ripe and firm, with none of the dreaded slimy texture, or pieces of pale tomato that I have found at other places.The baked goods looked and smelled really tasty, but I unfortunately didn't indulge, because I try to pretend that I am health-conscious and dainty during business lunches.I would definitely return here, and I think this is a great lunch option .
2018-07-04,3,Food not bad but super expensive for what it is,not worth it! It seems to appeal though for the offices around as it is nearby and quick eating.
2018-06-29,1,The service here was not good; i was there 20 mins ago and the girls did not look like they wanted to work. I asked for a green goddess smoothie and it was terrible. I threw it out; the girl that made it spoke in Spanish and said " what am I supposed to put in this?!" And just threw vegetables in the blender (she clearly did not know what she was doing) and she clearly did not know i spoke Spanish. It's a beautiful place but they need to train their staff to make the smoothie...and maybe more politeness would be nice.
2018-06-20,4,Went there on a Saturday. It was around noon, the bakery was not crowded at all, lots of seats inside and outside.I asked about a calzone looking thing to one of the employees. He told me there's egg inside. It sounded good and I ordered, cost over 5 bucks. But when I opened it, it was hollow inside, and some cheese. I was very disappointed. The price was steep for that in my opinion.  The other time I got looks a lot better and cheaper too. It would be a lot nicer if every item on display has a description and a price tag. I've tried many of their other items on different occasions. Pies are really good. The sweets are way too sweet for me.Overall, I recommend come and give it a try on their cappuccino coffee and Greek pies. It's a very nice and spacious bakery in this neighborhood.
2018-05-27,4,If you like anything and everything Greek, this is the place for you. Store is spacious and clean with street parking or the municipal parking is right across the street.There are many dessert options, Greek yogurt, gelato, sandwiches and a breakfast station. There is also a section where you can find extra virgin olive oil imported from Greece. The pistachio gelato and the pre-packaged Greek yogurt was really good. I also got six pieces of the $1 truffles to bring home. This is a good place to chill if you are in the hood.
2018-05-06,4,Since It's Greek to Me has left Hoboken, this has been my spot for a spinach pie or a nice baklava. You can also order a nice espresso or coffee to go along with a nice croissant  or my favorite which is the spinach pie. They take cash/credit and there is biking  and  car parking available.
2018-05-03,3,I wanted to love this place but it has some effort it needs to put in yet. It has a great location and aesthetically beautiful and clean; the staff is friendly. If there was more variety in the products it would be amazing. There's a real opportunity to place Greek yogurt (Fage) or homemade front and center along with some cooked dishes: mousaka, pastichio, papoutsakia, gyro, souvlaki, etc for the lunch crowd. The spanakopita and turopita was subpar. Hire some Greek cooks and put the food ahead of everything and this place and the brand will soar. I hope it makes that commitment to making available simple,authentic and delicious Greek cuisine.
2018-05-01,3,GFG is a pretty good bakery. It stands for Greek From Greece. The food has a lot of Greek influence. Many are sweet desserts like baklava. There's also a selection of sandwiches. I had the vegetable sandwich. It was about $7 for a fairly small sandwich. The bread was great and maybe even better than vegetables. It was simply a few roasted vegetables like red peppers, and olive oil. There aren't a lot of great vegan options so this was one of the few things. It's more authentic than typical American delis. It still does have bags of chips. There's also many premade salads and sandwiches.
2018-05-01,5,Great food!Love the bureka and the gelato... so many flavors.Not cheap food but worth it.
2018-04-30,5,I am obsessed with their breakfast pastries! Filled with feta cheese and other goodness...they're usually more savory than they are sweet. 100% have them heat it up for you, then take it by the water or on the PATH. Heaven.
2018-04-19,4,Really big, adorable coffee shop with many options for lunch! The employees were very friendly and made me a great cappuccino! As for gluten free options, there were no gluten free baked goods but there was salads.
2018-04-18,2,Thanks GFG for showing they open till 9.30 pm causing us to drive 20 min + pay for parking and already got closed at 8 pmHappy to edit my comment if they ever decide updating the info since I love this place
2018-04-11,5,Finally!An authentic Greek place with huge variety of savory and sweet pies,amazing coffee and outstanding sweets.The place is very cozy with friendly staff,great service and modern decor randomly seen in Hoboken.Thank you GFG!
2018-04-06,4,I stopped in for an iced latte and was very pleased with the friendly service and quality of the coffee drink.  I plan to go back for some of the spinach pie and other baked goods.
2018-04-02,5,Fredi espresso yes!! Finally! Amazing backlava and what a wonderful warm space to come in when it's cold outside! that tsoureki filled with hazelnut omg!!!
2018-03-24,2,meh. Tried this place again after a long break. Lots of prepackaged foods and the soft serve frozen yogurt bar was closed. Pass.
2018-03-16,4,I had excellent though pricey frozen yogurt here. There was only one yogurt flavor, but it was creamy and delicious vanilla! They had limited toppings (no nuts, etc, mostly just different syrups), I got it topped with caramel syrup. It was around $5.50 for one size. Reminded me of Go Greek yogurt in socal. So good.The baklava was ok, kind of dry on the top. Around $5 for 2 small pieces.
2018-02-10,5,Great value, awesome location, slick and stylish decor, awesome service and food and drinks do not disappoint.  Great coffee and they even do a real freddo!  If you don't know what it is, the more reason to try it. They also know their spinach pie and less well known cousins: leek pie, mushroom pie, mediterranean pie, potato pie, and various cheese pies.  The bougatsa was so good, thought I was in Thessaloniki.  Baklava and walnut pie so fresh, thought I was in Athens.  Haven't even seen Greek orange cake outside of Greece- what a treat. Have tried the hot lunch, great value for 10 bucks.  The place is great for breakfast or lunch, to grab a coffee and pastry with friends or alone with a laptop, to bring the kiddo for a frozen yogurt, to grab a salad/sandwich to take to the office, and to buy a nice box of mini eclairs to take to someone's home instead of flowers.  Also a great place to get amazing artisan teas, olives, oils, cookies, and preserves for the home.  With the generous rewards program, I'll be back again and again.
2018-01-24,4,Delicious greek bakery and as authentic as you will find in america in terms of taste. If you want a taste of something you normally would not find in america order the bougatsa. There is the savory and sweet one. Order the sweet one it is magnificent. Get it with sugar/cinnamon on it. It is a fillo pastry with a creamy sweet custard inside. It has the perfect balance of flavor but isnt necessarily the healthiest thing. We also tried the tiropita (cheese pie) which was also awesome. You know when a tiropita is bad when the cheese is salty but this was not. It was well balanced and great. I will say it is definitely overpriced and that is one of the only issues i had.  If we are comparing authenticity in terms of price this does not compare to a real greek bakery. A real greek bakery is an "every-mans" place where you can get great pastries at a good price.  I understand we are in america so that is why i did not penalize the place too much. I would recommend this place for anyone wanting an authentic taste of greece but bring your wallet!!The prices are a little expenisive but with the skilled labor and rent I can understand. This is not a place you can come every day but it is a place worth visiting every week.
2018-01-17,2,I love their double espresso shot and the leek pie but their chocolate cake was a disaster. It was hard and not edible. They need to do something with the recipe. It should have been moist.
2018-01-12,5,Amazing!!! I've visited the new store in Manhattan it was perfect , freshly baked goods,friendly staff and perfect design !! you should try Galaktoboureko, baklava, flat bread ,peinirli and of course spanakopita
2018-01-02,5,Excellent ambiance and the food is amazing. The espresso is one of the best of America. The service is fast and the people are super friendly.
2017-12-30,5,A fabulous Greek bakery with fresh sandwiches, salads, and soups all with a Greek flair. The Greek Yogurt bar is a refreshing, healthy option. I suggest having that so you can then get a pile of the baklavas in different varieties without feeling guilty. They're divine!  They have amazing savory and sweet Greek pastries as well. The decor is bright, warm, and inviting.
2017-12-02,5,This is that good good. Mmmmmmm. They don't serve hotdogs which is totally fine since it is a bakery! But really the best bakery in town, get yourself some cheese pies now! So many cheese pies!
2017-10-26,5,Absolutely love GFG Bakery! Great place to grab a savory Greek Pastry like the spinach pie or any of the flat breads. Absolutely love the gyro meat. I wish they would put it in a pita bread. Excellent place to grab lunch, or a delicious dessert.
2017-10-01,4,Just found this great spot after returning from 3 weeks in Greece. The baclava was spot on. Impressed that they carried Loux soda. Actually, seemed like somebody did their homework. Looking foward to trying more.
2017-09-20,5,The service there is amazing! They just do it so well. I've been there many times, and every time they welcome me with an uplifting hello. They're very good at making the tempiture perfecto!Their food is amazing. They make it fresh, and it truly is yummy. Every time it taste better than it did before. They have so many options to choice from (and they all sound delicious). When you're done eating the regular food there's ice-cream and frozen yogurt. That's my favorite part.There lighting is amazing. Every time I walk in I feel true happiness. They are so creative. It has a very pleasant smell. I always say when you walk in with a frown you'll come out with a smile. I recommend this restaurant to everyone who is reading this. I love this restaurant and I hope you do too.   (Student Project)
2017-09-14,5,Amazing coffee, Greek food and delicacies, as well as products in a modern environment, just as if you were in Athens of today!
2017-09-10,4,Funky and interesting.  Great place to grab a pastry or other treat on the go.  Got a takeout gyro bowl and was not disappointed.
2017-09-04,5,Wow! This place has Authentic Greek Yogurt. Get the plain Frozen Greek Yogurt with the sweet black cherries! Very tasty!Also there is very good pastries!
2017-08-05,5,Amazing food, yummy chocolates and pastries and very helpful staff. My go-to food stop for picking up a little something for a hostess or potluck. Love this place!
2017-07-03,5,Their name actually stands for great f$&@ing greek! Awesome place to eat, grab some ice cream, fresh orange juice, sit on the table, connect to Wi-Fi and chillax. Friendly service. Highly recommended, one of our new favorite go to spots at Hoboken.
2017-07-03,4,What an impressive new business on the Hoboken Waterfront! Located on River Street a block from the W hotel, GFG Bakery is serving up Greek specialities.  The selection is vast; it's a good place to relax and have a coffee and a pastry. There are also light meals like the spinach and cheese pies, (had the feta cheese pie, delicious!), some hot foods, etc.  There's certainly plenty of sweets like frozen yogurt, walnut cake, baklava, etc.  This bakery cafe  is very large, unquestionably an ambitious undertaking by the owners. The staff is super friendly and informative, they'll walk you through some of the unfamiliarities until you find something you like. The decor is neat, modern, casual, with high ceilings and plenty of space. The prices are reasonable, about what I was expecting. Overall it's a great spot, check it out!
2017-07-02,5,My favorite go-to spot before I head into work! They have a unique menu selection and their displays of desserts look amazing (though I have yet to try!) Their smoothies are great...and priced more reasonably than you will find anywhere else in Hoboken ($5-6). I also love their ready-made salads..so good and healthy! The coffee is also a must-try (my favorite in all of Hoboken, and again reasonably priced!) The staff is very helpful and someone is always walking around making sure you're being taken care of. There's plenty of seating here and is a very clean establishment!
2017-06-29,5,All I can is AMAZING!!!! These pastries are made with unique ingredients and done correctly which only leaves the customer wanting more. I never come here and get one cookie or cake. I always pick a mixture of their bakery items. The design of the space is also so beautiful and you really feel like you have stepped into a Greek bakery. It is a MUST if you are in Hoboken.
2017-06-27,4,Delicious spanakopita and veggie pie! We stopped in here to grab some treats before heading to Hoboken movie night and this place did not disappoint. The only thing I wish had more flavor was their greek salad, otherwise all else was great!
2017-06-13,4,Very nice staffs and service I stop last week right before closing. Staffs were very courteous and offer me a sample first to taste the dessert I wanted to buy
2017-06-12,3,coffee was good.mini eclair....meh...chocolate strawberry-rum dome dessert was heavy, but ok.
2017-06-08,5,I have been to Greece multiple times and can tell you that the desserts from this place are JUST AS GOOD. I'm so happy that i found GFG. The baklava is amazing as well as the orange cake. I've never tried the froyo but will next time i go for sure. The place is designed beautifully and always super clean. It is a little pricey, but so so worth it!
2017-06-04,5,Very good greek baked goods and desserts! A bit pricey but worth it
2017-06-02,5,The iced chai is amazing, and their desserts are fairly inexpensive. I like this place a lot
2017-05-30,4,I recommend this bakery for breakfast.  The food is delightfully tasty and fresh.  The restaurant is very clean.  The cost is also a little on the high side in exchange for the higher quality.I can specifically recommend the spanokopita which was fresh and tasty.
2017-05-28,5,Amazing!!!! True Greek pastries in Hoboken. The place is clean and cosy, a lot of choices. It's a bit pricey, but I would rather pay $$$ for tasty authentic pastries then for tv advertised something so popular among tourists. More quality food in Hoboken! So far we don't have enough.
2017-05-19,3,OK.  I just went for coffee and something sweet, and they don't disappoint.  But the setup for the desserts (have to get a staff person to come open the case for you and take out what you want) seems unnecessarily fussy and annoying, and it's quite expensive for what it is, even by Hoboken's increasingly gentrified standards. There were enough bored looking Hoboken yuppie moms just hanging out with their giant strollers to keep the place in business in and of themselves, so I guess they don't care if their prices drive off the rest of us.
2017-05-13,2,The pricing of your food is not normal and is the main issue in your concept. Too expensive and average food. You charge for 1 baklava 5.50$? A small filo burekas almost 6$?
2017-05-09,4,The sweets are hit or miss but most of it is pretty good. The round crunchy rings they have are good, especially in the carrot flavor  (the spinach one sounds like it would be good but it's quite bitter). I'm glad this place opened- Hoboken has a limited variety of quality bakery options. We needed something like this.
2017-05-08,5,Love this place! Great food and really friendly staff. Their spinach pie and leek pie are my favorite.
2017-05-02,5,Super clean and organized place, bright and welcoming. Everything is delicious and fresh.nice spot to grab a quick bite or site with your laptop for hours.
2017-04-26,5,I have to say I am a huge fan!We spent our honeymoon in Greece and have been craving some authentic baklava and GFG delivered!  And then some!!!The Greek dessert display is FILLED with classics drenched in honey!  OMG get EVERYTHING, especially the baklava and the small nuggets of fried dough in honey.  Gosh I wish I knew what they were called but you cannot miss them when you go.We also love their baked spinach pie (spanakopita), and any variety of the baked goods with toppings (the Mediterranean is really good, they was one with egg on top and the tomato feta and olive).Their Greek coffee is a must get as the iced coffee drinks are also delicious.Sign up for their rewards program and see how far you get!!We have been back twice, nice easy walk from our home and we love to buy an assortment of goodies to eat in the park or bring back home to enjoy on the balcony.
2017-04-21,5,Just popped in while staying at the W next door - great spot with a large variety of food options & good coffee, Some reviewers say it's pricey, but I guess it's all relative...I really liked the fact that it's authentic & they're all actually Greek (not just pretending)!
2017-04-16,3,Super expensive place. I've been here twice and once had a teeny tiny chocolate eclair for $3. The second time a spanakopita pastry (almost the size of an avg pizza slice) cost  $7.43 with taxes. It isn't enough for Lunch and the stuffing is good but there is more pastry than stuffing. Aaah, what a rip off! They should keep pricing based on location, not based on a ny scale!
2017-04-13,3,I decided to try this place for lunch yesterday afternoon. Didn't seem to busy when I went in. I tried the spanakopita and a piece of baklava. The spanakopita was nice and hot. I really enjoyed it. The baklava seemed a little dry for my taste. Overall I enjoyed my experience but wish it wasn't so expensive. Not sure if I would go back.
2017-04-09,5,I was siting down working with my laptop on this new, bright spacious venue in Hoboken when the owner approached me and made sure that I was comfortable. He then offered me free cookies. Very authentic good food with real Greek staff. Something that Hoboken needed as Astoria is far.
2017-04-06,5,Finally!!!!! A place to get good Greek food in Hoboken. I love stopping for a coffee and a spinach pie. Friendly staff. Beautiful place.
2017-04-06,5,Great bakery and deserts are pretty good also. My daughter loves their mustic gum ice cream.
2017-04-02,2,This place isn't all it's hyped up to be. I've tried getting coffee here a few times and they never fill the cup up all the way! The egress and the signage is weird - it feels like there are three different bakery sections so it's hard to navigate and the baked goods are mediocre at best. So bummed that this place doesn't feel more authentic! Hoboken needs a good Greek place!
2017-03-31,2,Everything is plastic and disposable! Food was ok and it's a great space with a lot of variety. They create a nice place to sit and eat and then give you everything in plastic, what a shame. And what a waste and unnecessary contribution to a worse planet. Was hoping for something different than the typical Italian deli in hoboken. Drinking a coffee from a real cup or eating off a plate with cutlery would be nice instead of the feeling of a take away joint.
2017-03-30,4,GFG is something different for Hoboken. There are no other Greek bakeries around. They have something for everyone and would be great for a casual breakfast or lunch.It's very modern inside. They have a large array of pastries, desserts, hot and cold dishes, yogurt and gelato. It was a bit overwhelming. Being Greek myself, everything was super authentic. I tried a cheese and spinach pie. The spinach pie was one of the best I've ever had. I'd come here just for a frappe (Greek iced coffee). It was excellent and I don't know anywhere else to get one. I will say that the prices are on the high side. I think they can get away with it because it's Hoboken. Quality and taste is there, but I think I'd come here only once in a while because of the prices.
2017-03-28,2,Very interesting business model..I live around the corner and saw the extensive menu for food which included a wide variety of soups, sandwiches, stews, salads, etc.  came here on a weeknight at 7:00, and there was only Greek salad, Caesar salad, 2 sandwiches available, and 1 kind of soup available for a meal. Plenty of breads and desserts but as far as a small meal that was it. I asked if the rest of their extensive menu could be ordered and the guy told me they stopped providing the meals at 5pm. Mind you they close at 9:30 p.m.  Why would you stop serving your food menu before people even left for work, and 4 hours before you close?? Very bizarre. Didn't try the Greek yogurt bar or the dessert but seemed a little on the expensive side
2017-03-27,3,A little overwhelming when you walk in here becuase there's so many options. Was a little turned off that the sandwiches were premade and didn't offer all the ones that were listed on the menu. Tried some pastries and they were awesome.
2017-03-26,4,Just left this place and I will start by saying the bakery is really big and carries tons of authentic greek things. I am Greek so I know the authenticity of a lot of things in here like the greek coffee and the spanakopita, prasopita etc. Today we tried the spanakopita, prasopita (leek pie) and some kadaifi. All were really well made and tasted great.I spotted a greek man (maybe the owner) training a new worker today which was incredible to see. Seemed like the owner genuinely cared about the place and was teaching the new staff on being meticulous in keeping the place clean.I did not give this place 5 stars because of the staff. There were two people specifically in the front, that were cracking up at me because i dropped something, and because I wasnt aware the dessert station you had to call someone to help you, I thought it was self serving, so that can be clarified with the sign. I hope the owner discusses with the workers that people like me who are Greek really value these places in the neighborhood as they bring a little taste of home closer. I would highly discourage staff from laughing at clients, its pretty unprofessional.
2017-03-22,3,This is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. We definitely needed something new when it comes to the bakery goods and GFG does fill up that gap.The bakery itself is quite spacious and carries a lot of Greek authentic goodies. They also carry some of the usual bakery stuff, you know what I mean (Cheesecake, Macrons etc.)We got ourselves an assorted box of sweets, one can pick and choose from different variety of sweets(Price per pound is same). I really liked the one with pistachio flavoring, it was some kind of rolled dough.Would definitely come back to try some other things off the menu.
2017-03-08,1,I was really disappointed by their customer service. It was international women day and they were having a promotion where you buy a pastry and get a free coffee. I brought my male friend there and he asked multiple times about the promotion and if he could get a any free coffee as well. He proceeded to buy a pastry after we both understood that he was eligible. Then when he was charged, he was charged for both the pastry and the coffee(which he wouldn't have bought if he knew he wasn't eligible). After they charged him(they didn't even tell him what they were charging until he saw the receipt), we talked to both the lady servicing us and the manager, they both told us males were ineligible which was not what she had told us prior. The manager said that males can't celebrate international women's day. That's so sexist. Anyone should be able to celebrate any holiday that they believe in. We were both wearing purple in support of the holiday and it was so rude of the manager to say that to my friend. It is just as important for females to show support of the holiday as it is for men.  I can't believe a manger would tell us essentially " tough nubs" for something like this and provide such a horrendous explanation. In my experience in customer service, as long as the person isn't rude or making horrible accusations then the customer is always right. I would not buy from them again knowing that the manager supports sexism as well as well as terrible customer service. Also as a coffee enthusiast the free coffee I received didn't even taste good.
2017-03-07,5,Store is super....concept is super!!!Congrats! Meals are very tasty ...!Spanakopita is delicious !!
2017-03-05,4,Love their sandwiches!! Great vibes!! So glad we have such hip cafe in Hoboken!! Please bring in more!!
2017-03-03,3,Pros:People over the counter are sweet and let you taste. Sundried tomato bread was okay-ish. Lots of space and good lighting.Lots of food options. Cons:We were two people who placed one single order and asked them to split the bill, they couldn't. (Just for two people.) Cashier said, it is not letting me split the bill.Spinach pie was bland (I like choc o pain better)Lentil soup was good. Not a cafe type where you can read a book. Next time, I will try greek desserts.
2017-03-02,3,*3.5 Stars*This is a new restaurant in Hoboken and a welcomed new addition.  It is clean, spacious, open and nicely decorated.  The staff is friendly, everything looks amazing and what I've had so far is delicious!The 3.5 stars is attributed to the prices.  For example, a piece of spanakopita comes out to over $7 after tax.  A piece of baklava is about the same.  Soup and a bottle of water comes out to over $10. I'd like to eat here more often, but the prices are quite high, even for the area.  There is a large assortment of pastries, sandwiches and other phyllo dough items, but if you have dietary restrictions the options are limited.  It would be nice if they had some more "light fair" options.  I've only seen 2 different salad assortments, everything else is pretty carb heavy.
2017-03-01,4,Sitting in GFG for the first time- extremely impressed! As of this review, the bakery is fairly new, and also quite unique for Hoboken. My first impression is this place is attempting to be your morning cup of joe, a quick lunch outlet, a nice afternoon snack, and a sweet or savory dessert all in one shop. The ambiance is pleasant, with lots of space to sit with a laptop and do work, the wifi is fast and free. I imagine it is perfect for the people who work in the surrounding buildings on River Street.I entered and was immediately greeted by the staff ready to take my order at the counter, the service was exceptionally fast and friendly, and you could tell they cared about their product. Actually, this has to be some of the best service I've had in Hoboken. The owner appeared to be on the floor surveying all of the different food stations around the bakery, I assume just ensure the quality of the food was fresh, which is always appreciated. The quality of the turkey sandwich I ordered was top notch!Overall, I was pleased with my first experience here, and I will certainly be back for the fresh squeezed orange juice, greek pies, specialty hot beverages, and gelato!
2017-02-28,1,Been here 5 times. They have great variety. No complains on food.But literally sucks. There was not a single time when I did not the staff 'confused'. They have been able to answer simple questions. There is no order in how they take orders and deliver.Staff seems to have no experience. Today, after waiting for 10 mins after ordering a coffee, I asked if it's ready. It was not even their list to make. I asked to cancel order and refund. They did not even ask me why I am canceling or if there is anything wrong. They just gave me money back. They lack basic 101 of service.
2017-02-25,3,Brand new bakery (less than 3 weeks old) in Hoboken. The space is beautiful, bright, open and very inviting. The pastries are displayed in cases in the middle of the space, and each looked more scrumptious than the next. First of all, five stars for the service. As I stood around the display case drooling over the pastries, unsure how to order them, a super friendly employee approached me and asked if she can be of any help. I wish I remembered her name. She was knowledgeable, friendly and offered me samples of some of the Greek sweets I've never had before.  I brought a heart shaped strawberry/chocolate and an orange/chocolate cake, as well as a piece of the strawberry blondie. The presentation is gorgeous, even down to the silver glittery pastry box. However, I would only give one star for the taste. Both cakes were way too sweet, I took one bite each and threw them away, what a of a waste of $12....  The strawberry blondie was good, not amazing, but slightly above average.  Bottom line, five star service and presentation, but only one star for taste. Despite my disappointment with the sweets here, I would like to try the savory pastries here one day, particularly the spanakopita.
2017-02-23,2,I don't normally leave reviews, but I felt like I needed to after visiting here a few times. I work in the area and that is the only reason I've given it a few chances. The pastries are good, definitely overpriced, but I really wanted to leave a review because the smoothies are terrible and the ice cream bar was extremely strange. Although they have an ice cream/yogurt bar that gives people access to it, someone came over and insisted on serving us. He filled the cup about a quarter of the way, and still charged for the full 4 oz. Definitely overpriced, felt very ripped off!
2017-02-23,5,Was excited to finally get the chance to try GFG Bakery. As a first generation American with a Greek mother and Sicilian father, I am always excited to try new places that are authentic and celebrate my heritage. First off, they scored points by the fact that they are run by Greeks and native speakers. Often times, you have someone appropriating a concept who do not know the culture that well and are not in touch with the heritage. Believe it or not, it matters and you feel the love and pride in the food. I had the cheese pie and some baklava, delicious. If I could have eaten more, I would have, but you know, the stomach only stretches so much.The restaurants itself is immaculate and spacious and modern and bright. Such a pleasure to sit down and eat.  I spoke with the manager, Elvis, and told him my mother was from Kalamata and he was so happy and excited to tell me about the products from Kalamata on their shelves and his love of Kalamata. I hope this place thrives and is here for a long time!
2017-02-20,3,Always love seeing a new place open in Hoboken. After seeing ads all over on Instagram, I decided to check out GFG bakery today with few of my friends. The size of pastries in a Greek bakery never disappoints me. The size of their croissants are twice the size from any of the bakery in the neighborhood. They taste was descent. I also ordered few pounds of their breadsticks for home, very reasonably priced. The chicken and potatoes was good, though I was a bit dissapointed with the amount of potatoes they gave vs the chicken and the presentation was a not pleasing at all. The coffees were average. The staff still need to get a hang of all they are serving. They were a bit clueless.
2017-02-18,4,New bakery in town and had to check it out! The Greek delights are absolutely delicious and the space is open, airy and can seat tons of people... great plus. No expenses have been spared to make it look modern and welcoming. We tried the traditional cheese pie ($6 a slice), Greek coffee ($3.15 for a small shot), mini Baklava and Saragli Chocolate mini. Everything was delicious - I love cheese pies and this one had a a Greek version of feta. The chocolate mini was my favorite find - a flaky pastry covered in chocolate and dipped in sugar syrup, hollow from inside and flaky under the chocolate layer. Excellent. GFG is not exactly cheap, so I don't see myself making a daily run for their crispy delights, but  over all it's a great addition to Hoboken!
2017-02-14,5,The food here is unbelievable if you ever want to feel like you just hopped off the plane and stepped into the island of Mykonos or just plain Athens anywhere you go in Greece with the great great taste of Greece he would find it at this Bakery I am so glad that it opened up because I'm down in Hoboken at least two to three times a week and I cannot help but go to eat there I would rather eat there than anywhere else the food is unbelievable again like I said before and the people of the nicest people ever just stop in and you'll see what I mean
2017-02-12,2,On the positive side their baked goods are delicious. They hand out a bunch of samples which is nice. But this is likely because they are new and I anticipate it stopping soon. I had a greek salad and it consisted of just tomatoes, cucumbers, feta, and some olives. It was bland and the biggest issue with it was it cost over $15!! It was also chaotic and disorganized. The prices for most things aren't easily accessible. It is also not a cafe. It is a self seating counter service establishment. So if you want to fork over quite a bit for some baked goods go for it. If you want a light bite in a cozy atmosphere go somewhere else.
2017-02-11,5,Welcome to the neighborhood! Everything from the spanakopita to the baklava is absolutely delicious. The staff is super friendly and the bakery is really authentic.
2017-02-10,5,Its one of a kind. The first bakery in the US with traditional Greek bakery products imported from Greece.
2017-02-09,5,This place is amazing: authentic baked goods, lots of space, and friendly staff. Highly recommend the sweet bougatsa and freddo cappuccinos, can't find them anywhere else in this area!
2017-02-07,4,This was walk by discovery that is worth a revisit thus far.  Considering the business only opened yesterday I consider the tables being full around lunch great and people stopping in the afternoon for treats a good start.It's more bakery than restaurant but if you are looking for spinach pies, pides, light sandwiches,  , and salads to pair up with the a comprehensive selection of sweet treats this is the place for you.The Ekmek Kataifi (layered greek pastry, topped with custard, and fresh cream, then nuts) was phenomenal!  And my husband stated the Trigona Panoramatos (phyllo cone filled with custard) was also quite amazing.I picked up some of the pita bread they sold there alongside many other breads - will have to update the review once I try it at home. They have samples for some of their cookies too.Services -- The staff is Greek (beautiful accents and all) and very welcoming, they were patient and helpful in explaining all the items they have.  It is a bit daunting to walk in see all the items wall to wall.
2017-02-06,5,Great fresh baked goods, best baklava I have had in a long time. Friendly staff and good assortment of options.
2017-02-06,5,Straight from Athens: a delicious bakery specializing in traditional Greek treats. I've never seen so many varieties of pastries in one single bakery. Sweet and salty. They also serve pre-made salads and sandwiches. Delicious stuff. Coffee is excellent, too. Love, love, love! It's my new favorite spot in town... And they just opened this morning!
