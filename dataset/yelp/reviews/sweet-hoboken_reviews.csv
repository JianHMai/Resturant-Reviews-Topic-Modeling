2021-10-17,2,I have been going to Sweet for years, so with a birthday coming up I wanted to order a custom cake from them. I thought this would be a simple request but the bakery does not have a streamlined process for taking orders. When you email the bakery you get an auto reply telling you to call them directly, which I did. The phone rang and rang with no answer and no option to leave a voice mail. I was eager to finalize the order before it became too close to the cutoff date to submit one, so I sent 3 emails over the course of a week requesting a call back. After a week, when I still didn't receive a call back, I called the bakery several times throughout the day until I finally got a live person on the phone, at which point, they told me they couldn't fulfil my custom cake request. Ok, that's fine, but I wish they could have told me that a week ago. At that point, it was too late for me to go anywhere else so now I will have to buy a generic supermarket cake for my b-day. A custom cake is a rather expensive purchase, so I sent Sweet an email letting them know that I was not thrilled at how they handled my request. Since I have frequented this bakery for years, I vowed that if they wrote back to me with any response at all I would not post a negative review on yelp. Alas, they ignored my email, so here I am complaining on Yelp.
2021-09-18,5,It's a hidden gem in Hoboken's always fresh, wonderful flavors, and decadent. Perfect for a snack or small part. I pick up a dozen or so for every party or getogether I go to, and they are always a hit. I just love the minis.
2021-07-17,4,The shop is super cute on a corner in Hoboken. Their cups cakes are some of the best I've ever had. You HAVE to try the red velvet, it's out of this world!
2021-06-27,5,The cupcakes were absolutely delicious. Great flavor, not overly sweet, and super moist. We loved all but our top three were the fluffanutter, raspberry, and carrot cake. Definitely recommend! Also - their lemonade is SO GOOD. Slightly sweet, tart and refreshing
2021-04-26,3,I came here after dinner as I was craving something sweet. I love eating something sweet and I am always in the mood for cake. The quaint bakeshop is located near a park. Due to COVID, they are limiting the amount of people in the store.I ordered a Red Velvet ($3.75) and a Fluffernutter ($3.75). The cupcakes were tasty but, I felt that they were a bit small to be "regular" sized. Personally, I thought the taste and presentation was just okay. I didn't see anything that made them noteworthy to visit again. The bakery had tons of interesting flavors but, I am not sure I would return. Maybe if I was in the area again. The one thing I didn't like is that the cupcakes were placed in a paper bag. I had to be very careful on transporting home my goodies. The customer service was okay. The person didn't really seem into being there one way or another. I was just another fly on the wall for all they cared.
2021-03-28,4,I've passed Sweet many times, but had never been in until Saturday afternoon. There was a good variety to choose from so I got 6 different cupcakes: Lemon, Chocolate Coconut, Chocolate Chip Cheesecake, Banana, Vanilla/Vanilla, and Fluffer Nutter. If I had to choose a favorite - it would be the Banana cupcake.4-star rating because the cupcakes didn't seem super fresh, and there wasn't much of a size difference between the minis ($2) and regular ($3.75) - I got the regulars anyway.Since their shop doesn't have a ton of room, for COVID protocols - they limit it to 3 customers inside at once which I appreciated.
2021-03-28,5,I ordered a cake for my daughter's christening and it was absolutely gorgeous and so delicious! Will definitely order another cake from Sweet!
2021-03-25,2,Disappointed .... I used to love their cookie brownies. You want to support small businesses but the price has increased and their product got smaller.
2021-03-05,5,Usually designer cakes look good and don't taste great. That is not the case here. The cake was decorated beautifully and the inside was equally as good.  The cake was moist and the icing was sweet but not overpowering.  We gave them an idea for a design and they nailed it. Loved the cake pops especially the vanilla ones as well.  They were also very easy to work with so nothing to worry about there.  You do a pay a premium for nice products but it is nothing astronomical here. They do an awesome job and have passion for their work. Love it!
2021-02-28,2,I was disappointed because I love cupcakes and saw positive reviews. I ate them same day and they just weren't very good. With such a price tag excellent cupcakes are required.
2021-02-13,5,Tasty cupcakes and solid all around. I love that they have mini cupcakes for most (all?) their flavors. Super helpful when you just want to be able to taste different flavors and don't want to commit to just a few full size ones.Request: Please start making cupcakes / pupcakes for dogs! You're right by the dog park and half the people in Hobo have a dog anyhow. Dogs deserve cupcakes too.
2021-02-06,1,Staff was so rude we left without ordering. Cupcakes looked good tho.. had high hopes.
2021-02-02,4,Stopped by this bakery on a Sunday around noon. They had a pretty good selection of both full size and mini size cupcakes. $2 for mini and $3.75 for regular. We tried 6 regular cupcake. They were all very good. The peanut butter one was very flavorful. We also tried the carrot cake, cheesecake, vanilla with vanilla buttercream, chocolate with vanilla buttercream, and fluffernutter. The chocolate cake was very moist. I felt the vanilla cake was a little overdone. The carrot cake was good but didn't have an intense carrot cake flavor which I personally liked cause that's not typically a flavor I enjoy.
2021-02-01,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. I come here 3 times a month at least. i have had every single cupcake and their rice crispy treat. their cupcakes are so good and last overnight and last through car rides. My favs are: smores (cheesecake topped) the best one, carrot, red velvet, marshmallow, the lemon is also good when they have it.i actually love the employees here they are not fake or overtly chatty, because bakeries can get like this, they are also quick and they know the menu. I have met the owner a few times she is a sweet lady originally from CA. i just hope this place stays open forever because imma need a smores wedding cake !
2021-01-24,1,The cupcakes look great and the staff is friendly.  I bought six cupcakes of various flavors, and decided to try them within an hour of purchase.  All six were stale.  The crown of the cakes were too hard to enjoy.
2020-12-23,4,This place was pretty decent! the vanilla and red velvet cupcakes were both pretty good. However, the real show stopper was the black bottom cupcake. If you decide to come here the black bottom is a must try.
2020-12-01,5,We love sweet!!! The mini cupcakes are our favorite. Fan favs of the peanut butter, pumpkin, and lemon! You really can't go wrong with any choice.
2020-11-11,5,If you need some delicious cupcakes (which we all know we always do) stop at Sweet. They have a great selection of regular and mini size cupcakes. Their flavors are fun and tasty. They also have great cookies and you can even buy the dough to make at home! They are great with personalized orders for cupcakes and cakes. Highly recommend... you'll definitely find yourself eating more than 1!
2020-08-12,4,I was looking for a place near Jersey City and Hoboken for a quick fix of cupcakes and Sweet didnot disappoint. I was pleasantly surprised that they offered all the cupcakes in mini and regular sizes which made it easy to try multiple. I got chocolate, vanilla, red velvet, strawberry, mocha and lemon. As suggested by the person behind the counter, chocolate and red velvet were our favorite. Mocha was good too. Lemon and strawberry were our least favorite as both seemed to use some artificial flavor which we didnot enjoy the after taste of.
2020-07-07,5,We have had their cupcakes many times and absolutely loved them! They did an amazing job on our surprise baby shower cake, totally nailed the woodland creature theme!
2020-05-03,5,Ordered my cake from here for my birthday!!!  It was hands down one of the best cakes I've ever had!!!  And thank you for staying open during quarantine!!!!
2020-02-15,5,A cute  and simple, no-frills shop. But they more than deserve appreciation for their delicious and good quality products. Courteous staff and reasonably priced too.
2020-02-10,3,After digging through the delicious Yelp photo's I ventured out to Sweet with my baby cousin. After hours in the park right next to the bakery we popped in to grab a few cupcakes - oddly enough the staff members were extremely aloof and borderline rude.We ended up ordering the Chocolate & marshmallow, chocolate coconut, chocolate & peanut butter, lemon & vanilla, vanilla on vanilla, & peanut butter on vanilla cupcakes. All were delicious! If it wasn't for the service this location would be 4 star material.
2020-01-26,5,Sweet makes the best coffee and espresso drinks of anybody in Hoboken. Great selection of ookies and if you're lucky you'll have Rice crispy treats with marshmallow. If you celebrate a wedding, birthday or anniversary be sure to have them make your cake. It's the only coffee & confectionery place that I ever go to.
2019-10-03,4,My review is solely on the cupcakes since I ran in and out in less than 5 minutes so I didn't get to see all that Sweet offers. I was looking for a bakery in Hoboken which had good reviews and stumbled upon Sweet! I needed 20 cupcakes ASAP for a birthday party in a couple of hours and since Sweet had the cupcakes already laid out it was easy to pick what I wanted. They have mini cupcakes for $2.00 or regular sized cupcakes for $3.75. I opted for the mini cupcakes since I needed 20 cupcakes I did not want to empty my wallet. I picked out 5 raspberry, 5 carrot cake, 5 vanilla and 5 red velvet for $40.Fast forward to the birthday party, the cupcakes were DEVOURED! They were soft, fluffy, decadent, creamy, just everything I hoped they'd be. We left the birthday party with one remaining which was gone really quick.Thank you Sweet, I will be back :)
2019-10-02,1,You've become sloppy. It's unfortunate because you had the potential to be such a great local business. Would be great if you could also respond to email so that I wouldn't have to leave such a review... to express my displeasure with your unreliability and poor customer service.
2019-09-05,2,I've been here a couple of times and each time is a disappointment in customer service. A smile or a simple hello is so easy to establish especially if you're running a business. I've been to plenty of bakeries in Hoboken none of which I felt uncomfortable to part take in. Cupcakes are great but first impressions are EVERYTHING. To the female employee with short dark hair...smile! Don't look so pissed every time you're there.
2019-08-14,5,I placed a last minute order for a cake and was very happy with the final product. I first ordered a red velvet naked cake, then looking at their Instagram I realized that they were able to decorate it with fresh flowers, I called (two says before the pick up date) and asked them if they could do it for me to what they said yes! I only had to bring the flowers. My girlfriend LOVED her cake and we ate it all!
2019-07-25,1,I came to Sweet Bakery in Hoboken. I've noticed in my experience that customers are treated differently when getting service. I'm a black woman and had to wait while the owner and the staff was talking and looking right at me and never acknowledged my presence until I said something. I did notice when other customers came in that were non black there was quick assistance. I'm not one to call the race card for everything, but this was obvious and has happened more than once. I will no longer come to this establishment or purchase any products. Every customer should be treated equally especially if they are supporting your business.Nicole W
2019-05-09,5,Great cupcakes in Hoboken each cupcakes was a surprise. I got one dozen for my sister BDAY SHE WAS VERY HAPPY!!!!
2019-04-19,5,This is one of my favorite bakery in Hoboken. Their speciality is their cupcakes and one of my favorites is the chocolate cupcake with marshmallow on top. This is my go to spot for special occasions custom cakes. If you want a basic cake, they need one week notice and they need ~2 weeks notice if you want something more fancy. I find that you get more servings than what they recommended because the cake is so dense. If you want writing on the cake, it can be a hit or miss - one of the cakes we recently ordered, the writing is a bit off like they didn't realize they were about to run out of space. Overall their cakes have never disappointed me. They are dense and super moist. Always a hit with the guests. What they're not known for is their cheddar biscuits - OH MY GOODNESS - their cheddar biscuits are the BOMB! They only make a limited quantity and once they're gone, they're gone for the day. I was in a savory mood and decided to get one since I was in a rush. I was amazed!
2019-04-10,5,absolutely obsessed with this place. so thankful i live uptown or else i'd spend all my money on cupcakes everyday! everything is AMAZING!
2019-03-26,1,Dry, dry dry cupcakes.  More like dry muffins with super sweet frosting. Pretty uninspiring. The chocolate are a bit less dry than the vanilla ones. I guess the Hoboken standard is pretty low, judging from the reviews here.
2019-03-17,3,Great tasting cupcakes  loved the lemon. And the coconut.  But when you walk in the place it smells like a harsh cleaner.   It's a bakery so u would  expect to walk in and smell something baking.     I saw Clorox wipes containers on both counters.  I hate the strong smell.       How about a milder organic scented product in vanilla?
2019-03-03,5,Amazing to work with! We wanted a Moana cake for our daughter's 2nd birthday but weren't exactly sure what it should look like. They were able to use a couple of cake pictures that I saved from google and it came out perfect! They were very easy to work with and was actually much less effort to get a custom cake than I expected. From initial call, sending in examples of what we were looking for and pick up - no issues. Also, the cake tasted great! Highly recommend and I can't wait to use them again!
2019-02-28,5,My friend gave me these as a birthday treat- so yummy! Somehow they were even better the next morning for breakfast ;)
2019-02-24,1,When we walked in at 4:50pm (closes at 6) on a Sunday, they were already starting to clean up, and it felt as though we were interrupting the cleaning. There was no greeting or warm hello, no small talk about the few cupcakes left and no attempt at recommendations around the few cupcakes that were left.  I'm a new Hoboken resident and have experience amazing customer service and super friendly business owners. Maybe we caught them on an off day, but first impressions are everything.
2019-02-17,1,Went to buy the kids some cupcakes and there were flies everywhere. By the coffee stations, on the tables, it was disgusting. I decided to check the cupcakes and there was a fly in the casing landing on the cupcakes! I told the young lady at the counter but she didn't take the fly out or even see it as a concern! My son had so swat flies out of his face while we were there and I even found two of them mating on the napkin dispenser. The place had crumbs and cake scattered under the tables and there were shoe marks from the food being stepped on and tracked all over the floor. I felt bad for the other children taking a chance eating there. The parents need to be aware of this. It is a pigsty. There were shoe prints all over the seating area and it was painted white so it was very visible. Not to mention the sticky hand prints smeared all over the main window. From looking around I noticed froth containers lying around with bugs sitting on them and it smelled of rotten milk, as if they do not wash the container after using it for the next customer. The employees do not seem moved by this nor does management. No wonder there are so many insects.As for the cupcakes, other than the fly being in the casing, I saw the prices and asked the employee if they were made fresh. I was told an honest answer and that was, "We bake them, then we freeze them, then defrost them and whatever we don't use at night, we dispose of it."If the cupcakes are all frozen, I don't want to even begin to imagine how they store their ingredients. I was told from an old family friend who stopped going there as well, that she saw them get cake boxes and supplies from their underground outdoor basement.If anyone suspects their cupcakes of being dry, that's the after-effect of freezing them.
2019-02-16,4,This place has yummy cupcakes! I love it. It's best to go in the morning when they are fresh. Flavors and options are great. Don't ask the employees which ones are most fresh in the afternoon however; they lie! The best one is the carrot cake cupcake. I love it! The peanut butter cup one is great too. They all are really. Try it out! The cupcakes are a little pricey, if you ask me. They have really cute cakes too!! Haven't bought one yet.
2019-01-24,1,Haven't tried their cupcakes but did order specialty cakes form them and was highly disappointed. Cakes were completely frozen and extremely dry even after full thawing. I ordered two cakes a week in advance for my kids' 1st birthday, one smash cake and regular for adults. Initially I was put off when they were picked up and they both were extremely frozen. ( I figured they would be fresh if I made a trip there just to order it !) After complete thawing ( the photo shoot of the smashing of the cake had to be delayed hours to thaw )the cake was extremely dry! Not only were the cakes impossible to smash, my kids almost choked on it! Never again. Could have baked a box cake for 2 bucks for them to smash V.S. 40 bucks of frozen bread.
2019-01-09,4,3.5 stars. I would have given 4 if the cupcakes weren't so hard from refrigeration and if all of them tasted like the red velvet which was amazing. I'd just order that next time. I would come back here just for that. I also kind of liked the mocha but like I said it was hard and cold. Service was fine. Next time,let me wRm up to room temperature and eat. Coffee was ok.  Try it out and tell me what you think! They were nice enough to let my son use the rest room which I truest appreciated. At the end, my all time favorite cupcake is Georgetown cupcakes in NYC. No one has surpassed them yet.
2018-12-31,5,This is my go to spot for cupcakes and custom cakes. This place is AMAZING. The little cupcakes are to die for, be careful you can't stop when you start eating them so just get a few! They have a great cake decorator and I have had many awesome birthday cakes made here. They can typically do anything you can imagine up as long as they have about a week and a half - two weeks to do it. Beside the decorating the actual cake on its own is DELICIOUS and they have some amazing flavors. I highly recommend this for all your sweets needs!
2018-12-23,5,This is my second time ordering from Sweet, and once again they did a spectacular job! I got a two layer sheet cake for my engagement party and everybody absolutely loved it and would not stop raving about it. I will continue to order from this bakery for all future events!
2018-12-16,4,Had a sugar craving so this cute bakery was just a short walk from my apartment. The red velvet cupcake was divine. Usually rare to find ones where you can taste the cocoa and the frosting isn't overly sweet but this was perfect!Can't say the same for the fluffernutter that I got the next day. Cake was very very dry. Maybe it was because I went later in the evening. Will be making a mental note to go early when the cupcakes are still fresh.
2018-11-19,5,We got the chocolate cake with chocolate buttercream. It was the most delicious cake I ever ate and so beautifully made!!! The cake definitely rocked our party. Thank you Sweet. Extremely pleased and satisfied with the way our cake turned out.
2018-11-09,5,What a pleasant experience. I ordered a customized cake for my son's first birthday. Not only did the cake look absolutely amazing, it also tasted phenomenal! We ordered a split cake of vanilla and chocolate. In addition, they were able to work within my budget. Thanks so much for your service!
2018-09-24,5,A quick search for a cupcake shop in the area brought us to this small storefront. Located near the park, this shoppe doles out all sorts of baked goods, but primarily many types of cupcakes. Saturday afternoon, and no one else inside, so was able to immediately order some treats to go.Again, lots of options to choose from, including miniature versions of several cupcakes. Opted for the regular-sized version of the Peanut Butter on Chocolate Cupcake ($3.25). Walked this over to the waterfront, where it stayed relatively intact. Super creamy peanut butter icing sitting on top of a moist chocolate cake. It was as delicious as described; wonderful balance and (a little too) easy to eat. Probably could have used some milk to wash it down, but nonetheless a perfect item to satisfy the sweet tooth.Service here is great, and they take card despite the low price. Would certainly come by again when back in the neighborhood.
2018-09-02,5,Cupcakes are not my favorite dessert, but I could them all day at Sweet! Because I was hesitant, I started off with there minis, and ended up ordering 4! The red velvet and chocolate are heavenly! A friend also ordered her baby's first birthday cake from here and it was beautifully decorated. I think that Fondant gross, but theirs was absolutely delicious!
2018-08-19,5,I love this cute little shop! I personally enjoy the minis so I can try a bunch of the different flavors. I got raspberry and fluffernutter this time, and really liked the fluffernutter! The raspberry was a little too sweet for my preference. The red velvet is really tasty and I highly recommend! I can't speak to the chocolate ones, but I'm sure they are great too!
2018-07-30,4,Sweet has good cupcakes, they have mini ones and full size. It's in a semi inconvenient location away from path and ferry but it's a cute little spot on he corner by the park and the hospital. They usually have a good selection and the cupcakes are always fresh. The cupcake is a little bit too dense for my taste. Frosting is delicious though !!! I've ordered from here several times and did have to wait a bit for pick up which can be frustrating if you head over at the wrong time! Definitely a great place for a cupcake
2018-07-09,5,Service: quick and friendly. Price: awesome!Cake: OMG. Chocolate cake with peanut butter and chocolate frosting. Legit tasted like Reese's cup. The cake was moist and had a delicate crumb, the buttercream was not overly sweet, plus it was nicely decorated. Our guests enjoyed it very much!First time ordering from this bakery, but will definitely be back.
2018-07-08,1,This review is solely on their customer service not taste. Why? Because We didn't even have a chance to place order with them. I wrote them 3 emails, called them 3 times and even went in person one time to inquire about the price for two cakes that I would like to order for my LO birthday. But every time they gave me a different excuse why they are not able to give me price quotes right there.  First time when I walk in they told me the decorator is not there and will have to wait till she comes in. They took down the details and also asked me to email them & that they would get back to me on a certain date.  But I never heard from them.  So I called them again. Again they took my contact info and promised to reply. But that never happened.  It's very disappointing on a customer service end that a customer would have to contact a business 3 times just for a quote and every time was promised a reply but never did. Emails after emails and phone calls and phone calls, I never heard from them.  So I decided to call in one last time. And the last phone call made me decide to give them a bad review because the lady on the phone said they are all busy in the kitchen and nobody was available to check emails! Then why tell me to send pictures and details of the cakes I wanted? Bad follow up and no response.  Not only are you losing my business but also referrals. I will never consider ordering from them.
2018-05-16,5,I got a 6 inch red velvet cake here. Not only was it delicious, but very beautiful (didn't get a customized cake.. just a basic one). At $25, the cake can easily serve 8 people. The cream cheese frosting is very smooth and the cake is moist. I will definitely be coming back the next time I need to order a cake. I also tried their cupcakes awhile ago.. also great.
2018-05-15,1,I've never written a review before. I live in town and love supporting small business owners. I try my hardest to go out of my way to do so. I bought my sons first birthday cake here and I will say they have the most delicious products I've ever had. However, today will be the last day I go in there and frankly will never speak highly of them again. They are so rude and act like they are special or something. Not quite sure when owning a cupcake shop (isn't that supposed to be for happy occasions) became such an unpleasant experience. Today is my daughters first birthday and I went in to grab her first cupcake. I asked if they could frost me a vanilla one with pink or even just vanilla and was told no. I was trying to buy a few to celebrate tonight (I told them that super nicely) and she could care less. I've been in here before I know it's not a big deal to do so. But I was treated super rude. She was nasty and I wouldn't want someone with that type of energy in a shop that's supposed to be about happiness and celebration. Definitely not a "sweet" experience. Done with you, Sweet.
2018-05-05,4,If you're looking for cupcakes this is the spot to order them, a great mom and pop shop right near Church Square Park, so if you're with kids and have a sweet tooth and need some caffeine, this would be the place to satisfy your craving. I would recommend the vanilla cupcake with chocolate buttercream frosting icing on top it costs around $3.25 they also sell minis for $1.75, they also do custom cakes but no gluten free, there is bike and car parking available, they accept  cash or cc . They normally close at 6 pm & no bathroom  .
2018-03-11,5,Our cake came out amazing and was very delicious and after reaching out to many bakeries I found them to be a fair price for really good quality!
2018-03-11,5,Great bakery! Loved their cupcakes already, so when it came time to order a cake for a local bridal shower I decided to order from Sweet.  Beautiful, delicious, reasonably priced and an absolute pleasure!  Their suggestion to go one layer taller with a smaller diameter cake to accommodate more space on the sides for decorations was spot on.  Highly recommended.
2018-03-08,5,It's been a while since I've been here. I used to live closer and I would randomly walk to this cute little corner bakery  to try their seasonal cupcakes. It was so good that I bought half a dozen of the mini cupcakes for a friend's birthday (she loved them as well). The cupcakes are just the right amount of sweet with so many flavors to choose to from. I need to re-visit this place once the weather warms up because I'm in dire need for some sweetness in my life!
2018-02-05,4,Brought a bunch of mini's to a superbowl party & they went over big! Our faves were the coconut & marshmallow, but all were great & not dry at all.
2018-01-05,3,Good place for mini cupcakes and custom cakes. The owner Angela makes the custom orders directly and does a great job of creating what you want, even though her prices are higher than average. It is best to email her a picture of the cake and describe in writing exactly what you would like to change in terms of colors/shape/writing etc.The only issue is some of her staff is truly unprofessional. I had to call 4 times before I could speak to her, as the girl (with the backward hat) at the counter never gave my messages. I almost decided to cancel, but given my support for small businesses, stopped by to meet Angela and personally explain the order at store closing time. She could be losing business because of that employee who is on duty during the weekends.
2017-12-30,5,An absolute gem that puts a certain famous NY bakery to shame. My boyfriend and I got a sampler of the chocolate ganache, chocolate coconut, red velvet and chocolate chip cheesecake and all four were EXCELLENT - it was difficult to choose a favorite (though if forced, the red velvet and chocolate coconut are in close contention). Their coffee was lovely as well, and a fantastic pairing to the cupcakes. Add to that the charming, old-school aesthetic of the bakery, and I can confidently say there's no need to travel over the river to get your sweet-tooth fix.
2017-11-07,5,This is a hidden gem in Hoboken, just across from Church Square Park, that looks like an old school bakery back in the 60's. They have amazing homemade cupcakes, beautiful cakes and awesome cold brew coffee. I regularly stop by in the morning to pick up some homemade rice krispies treats for the office. Everyone flips over how delicious they are! Also, the black bottom specialty cupcakes are out of this world (chocolate cake topped with chocolate chip cheesecake). Pickup some treats, sit by the park, and enjoy!
2017-09-09,5,Amazing cupcakes, all of them. My favorite is the ganache, with a cup of coffee. The scones and quiche are literally the best my husband and I have eaten in our lives. The cookies rotate in theme and are absolute scrumptious!! The birthday cakes are so incredibly beautiful that my jaw drops and heart pounds to see them during what I call my Saturday morning 'gallery run'...they are spectacular works of art.  The coffee is as good as it gets!  Strong, aromatic, never acidic, smooth and perfect....as a coffeeholic (I drink at least 2-4cups daily for 25 years), definitely, my go to place. Sweet has become my second hoboken home from home! Thank you!!!
2017-07-31,5,Order our child's birthday cake, and it was beyond delicious. Everyone raved and raved. Will definitely order again!
2017-07-14,5,We adore Sweet!! Perfect spot to grab a sweet treat (mini cupcakes are delish!) along with an iced coffee. It's our go-to place for any special occasion. They also do beautiful specialized cakes and have come through on a few days notice in the past. Perfect location too right off church square park in hoboken!
2017-06-14,4,From our previous post (Mavi's at Fort Lee), hop onto River Rd. to Hoboken...all the way down to Church Square Park on Garden and 4th...One word:  There's a bright little corner cafe here, where the iced coffee isn't bitter, which is a good place to start...But the personal quiche was a tad dry and lacked flavor at the time. (I'd suggest stroking your quiche-diction at Dames or Brewshot in JC, or Perk Up at the Bay, unless you know of others, as I can't seem to keep up with your sinful ways...)The small scones (plain and cheese) were decent though, as well as the service. (But I'd have to say Cafe Bene for scone, which satisfies more for about the same cost.)HOWEVER: do NOT expect WiFi here. You're supposed to be people-watching (the park across says hello!?!), if not buried in a book or a convo with your company or yourself. (And DO watch my sugar, I mean your sugar--just saying, you know.)Final word:  Still, this small corner cafe is quite all right. So 4 stars largely for its bright location, and I was able to park at one of its three tables when I stopped by. We'll see if I feel the same way next time there happens to be a huge crowd...Extra words:  They make their own pastries and desserts (if I'm not mistaken, as I've been mistaken before *thinks of a bake shop in O.Grove that outsources its baked goods*).Additional note:   Parking in Hoboken is, well, you know--!@#$%&:(((!! But the cake, which I have yet to try (though I have to go with L'atelier first), might be worth the drive for some folks.
2017-05-13,2,I'm not sure what all the rave is about with this place... I walked in and the selection was not good. They barely had cupcakes of the stuff they were offering. The vanilla cake tasted old and stale, the topping was ok. Not going back.
2017-04-16,3,I paid for coffee not such a bad attitude especially on such a nice day. Whatever her situation was You should not bring it to work!
2017-04-05,5,Best bakery in the area. The cupcakes are AMAZING!!! Red velvet is a must-try..and the peanut butter is a favorite too! They make mini and regular sized cupcakes, which is great to have as an option. I even ordered a cake for my husband's birthday and it came out lovely!
2017-03-11,5,I had to revise my post because after actually eating a cupcake, the icing was plenty.  I think it was swirled high was all.  Delish and worth the trip!
2017-03-05,5,This place is perfection! Customer service was on point. I never ordered a cake before, and the woman on the phone was patient and made great suggestions! We ended up going with one layer of chocolate and one of vanilla with chocolate mouse in between and vanilla frosting. Not only did the cake look amazing, but it tasted phenomenal!!! IThe decorator was so creative and our unicorn cake was everything we were hoping it would be.
2017-03-02,4,Delicious cupcakes and look beautiful. Reasonable prices for Hoboken and I would buy again. Carrot cake is my favorite.
2017-01-15,4,The carrot cupcakes are awesome. The frosting is too sweet for my liking. The strawberry cupcakes were subpar. The extra sweet frosting with the sugar sprinkles overtook the taste of the actual strawberry flavor. I bought a bunch of cakes for a bridal shower. I'm giving this place a four because the cakes looked awesome and they photographed well. Also, the mini cupcake option makes you feel less guilty on a cheat day!
2017-01-09,5,I recently had cupcakes made from Sweet for my Wedding on New Years eve! They were perfect and so delicious! My guests are still talking about how good they were! Thank you to the staff for being so easy and efficient! Ordering cupcakes from you was a breeze and one less thing to worry about on the BIG day!
2016-11-05,5,Good coffee and cute portion desserts. Mini cupcakes / marshmellow especially are LIT! Spent 15 minutes walking around hobo and found this gem
2016-10-03,2,Their maple oatmeal raisin cookie and black bottom mini cupcake were both pretty weak.
2016-09-16,4,My friend bought me mini cupcakes and I think we ate them in record time! They are so good, and the quality is high. We had the red velvet, vanilla with chocolate frosting, and the chocolate coconut. Next time I'm super excited to try the Carrot because I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong with whatever you order at this bake shop.
2016-08-30,5,This place is awesome! The cupcakes are amazing. They have a great selection of flavors and the mini ones are perfect to bring to parties. So far, they have been a hit everywhere I have brought them!
2016-08-13,5,THE BEST COFFEE IN HOBOKEN!!! And their cup cakes aren't bad either. Just wished they were open earlier as I would love to be able to buy their coffee in the morning.
2016-07-10,2,I ordered a cake for my girlfriend's surprise birthday party. When I went to pick up the cake the design was exactly what I wanted but they spelled her name wrong. When ordering I specified how it should've been spelled multiple times so they wouldn't get it wrong. I then found out after eating the cake that it tasted NOTHING how it was described to me. It was supposed to be chocolate cake with cheesecake pieces which turned out to be all chocolate chips and frosting; very little cake and very little cheesecake.  To say the least I was extremely disappointed and embarrassed and wouldn't recommend getting a cake from here to anyone.
2016-07-01,2,Stopped by because I was craving a sweet pick me up. Ordered a carrot cake cupcake and a chocolate coconut to go. The icing to cake ratio for the carrot cake was good but not the chocolate coconut, way too much icing. Both cakes were moist BUT they were super sweet and kinda tasteless. Will not be going back.
2016-06-23,4,Really delicious bakery. We tried the vanilla cupcake with cream cheese frosting and coconut as well as the chocolate cupcake with milk chocolate frosting with coconut. Yum! The vanilla cupcake was a tad bit dry but the icing helped (and there's a lot of it for all you icing lovers!). The chocolate cupcake, on the other hand, is pure perfection -- totally moist and flavorful. I would definitely get more sweets from Sweet!
2016-05-04,5,WOW! This place is amazing! I honestly think it is one of the best (if not the best) Dessert places in the Hoboken and Jersey City area. It is a very small bakery buy wow is the pastries amazing. I had the the mini cupcakes and they were perfect! Not too sweet but just right. In addition to great cupcakes, the service at Sweet is great! Everyone is very attentive to their customers. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for amazing desserts! I think Sweet is far better than that other pastry place (a TV pastry establishment). I must note that i was not a big fan of their coffee, but that is the ONLY thing that i did not like about Sweet.I would rate Sweet as follows: Food/Desserts is 5 Stars, Price is 4.5 Stars, Service is 5 Stars and Atmosphere is 4.5 Stars. The views expressed are of my own and are my true personal experience at this establishment. My personal experience may not reflect this actual establishment, their quality or someone else's experience at the establishment.
2016-05-01,4,I love to bake and have a sweet tooth so by nature I had to try this place out when my boyfriend told me about it! We were welcomed by a nice girl in the back (I assume it's the kitchen) as well as the owner who asked us what we'd like to devour. Her recommendations were that everything was fairly popular, for cupcakes in particular: the chocolate bottom, red velvet and carrot being the top favorites by her customers. I personally have a unhealthy addiction to peanut butter so I went for the fluffer nutter cupcake, my boyfriend going with carrot. They have two sizes of each flavor which I think is a neat idea, I can't recall the prices but couldn't have been that bad bc it didn't strike me as expensive when I glanced. I'd love to come back for other baked sweets, the majority of the selection was cupcakes. I am not a huge fan of cupcakes but they were named just perfectly.
2016-04-04,5,Such delicious cupcakes here- truly a hidden gem for the locals (I'm assuming most out-of-towners flock to Carlo's Bakery)! From my 3 experiences here, the staff have all been friendly & helpful. They have a good amount of cupcake flavors to pick from as well. My favorite aspect of this place is the mini-cupcakes... I love how I can indulge in a treat without feeling too guilty :)
2016-04-02,4,I'm not going to give this place five stars because I wasn't thrilled with the consistency of the cakes as they were too dense for my taste. However, their cream cheese frosting is out of this world. I'm usually not a big fan of frosting, mainly because it's many times too sweet or too light or too heavy unlike Sweet's. This cream cheese frosting has the perfect amount of sweetness, vanilla extract and still has that cheesy flavor of the cream cheese. Hands down the best cream cheese frosting I've ever had, thus far. A good plus: La Colombe coffee.
2016-03-28,5,I can't say enough about this place!!!! I was trying to find a bakery that was close to the venue I was holding my 40th birthday party near. While there is the "famous" Carlos's, I've always found their cake to be dry and heavy. I'd remembered buying cupcakes from a bakery a couple years ago, but couldn't remember the name. I searched Yelp, found them, and went to the store the next day to order the red velvet cake. My vision, "40" in marquee numbers. I was diagnosed with breast cancer 4 years ago and quite frankly, I wasn't sure I'd even make it to 40. The cake was so perfect that when I picked it up the night of my party my eyes watered as soon as I exited the door of the  bake shop. I loved the cake and 4 days after my party guests are still asking me who made it. Thank you, thank you, thank you SWEET for helping make my 40th birthday so very special and perfect!
2016-03-18,4,I live nearby so I had passed this place a hundred times. One weekend afternoon I finally decided to treat myself and stop in. I had a sample of a few mini cupcakes. the red velvet was great, the vanilla with chocolate icing was delicious, and I had a seasonal flavor I can't remember but it was tasty as well. Highly recommend.
2016-03-14,5,This place has incredible cupcakes!  Their mini cupcakes are PERFECT for bringing to a party, or if you just want to sample every flavor they have to offer in the store!!!Their cupcakes are very flavorful and moist; the flavoring is very spot on (ie: coconut actually tastes like coconut, lemon tastes like lemon etc.) and it's really delectable.  We are huge fans of their red velvet as it's more than just food coloring because you can taste that the cake part is actually denser than their other cupcakes.I will be back and back again!However, they DO USE NUTS in their bakery so if you have a child that has a nut allergy, be careful!!!!!
2016-02-21,5,Love love love this place!! This cute little bakery in Hoboken has the best mini cupcakes ever. The second you walk in - you're greeted by the most amazing aroma. Ganache is my fav and I love the Mocha as well (did I mention I love coffee? :))! Definitively worth checking it out!
2016-02-06,4,Cute little bakery in the middle of Hoboken. Fun cupcake flavors and friendly staff! I love their mini cupcakes, so you can taste a bunch without overdosing on sugar. My boyfriend and I came on a Sunday morning. We were the only customers eating in, but saw multiple pick-up customers in just a half hour. We ordered 4 mini cupcakes: vanilla with vanilla frosting, chocolate with chocolate frosting, fluffed nutter (our favorite!) with peanut butter and marshmallow frosting, and "black bottom" - a brownie cupcake with cookie dough. Would definitely come back. Great place for a quick treat and a cup of coffee, or to stop and get a box of cupcakes as a gift!
2016-01-30,4,Best cupcake place in Hoboken! I can tell by the taste, they use fresh whole ingredients unlike some other cupcake places in town. I love the mini option, it's the perfect bit size. The red velvet and mocha are my favorite. I would love if they started to make a salted caramel cupcake. My only complaint is that I would prefer if they used plastic gloves when handling the cupcakes.
2016-01-17,5,Best cupcakes ever!! Way better than magnolia although definitely comparable. I stop here quite often for a few mini cupcakes. The staff is very friendly. Last Valentine's Day, my boyfriend and I went in for two cupcakes. We walked out with a box of free mini cupcakes!!! They had completed a special order on the wrong day and thought it would be nice to give them to us. Definitely made our day.
2016-01-07,3,Nothing outstanding but pretty good cupcakes. Cute little shop in Hoboken with really friendly staff. Stop by if you're nearby and want a sweet treat but nothing to go out of your way for. The mini cupcakes make it really convenient to try different flavors though.
2015-12-14,5,We got our son's 1st birthday cake made from Sweet and it was a big hit among our guests.The staff is very flexible and open to suggestions. They worked with me towards my very specific requirements and I was very happy with the end result! Highly recommend!
2015-12-12,1,Had three mini cupcakes today and they were hard as a rock.This place is falling off. I'm going uptown to Jarred's stuffed cupcakes
2015-12-01,5,They have the best mocha/espresso ish  cupcake.  The minis just hits the spot! I wish they would make lemon!
2015-11-18,5,I love this place!!!!!!!! Their mini cup cakes are to die for especially the chocolate/cheesecake cupcake. I used to  come here at least once a week, before my coworker left me, and it would literally make my day. The staff is always so friendly and nice as well which makes it even more of a pleasure to go there. If you are craving something sweet you cannot go wrong with paying this place a visit. They will not disappoint.
2015-11-11,4,Yay!  I am a fan---and it's all because they have fluffernutter cupcakes.  It's more than that---not only do they have these cupcakes but when it comes to mimicking an actual fluffernutter, they nailed it!For those of you who may not know what a fluffernutter is:yankeemagazine.com/artic...Sweet's version of the fluffernutter cupcake consists of a vanilla cake, topped with peanut butter frosting and marshmallow fluff.  While eating the cupcake, I closed my eyes and savored it.  By doing so, it was just like eating a sandwich.  Our daughter, who also had one, agreed with me when I said "they nailed it!"Sweet offers cupcakes in 2 sizes --- mini and a larger one that is slightly smaller than the average cupcake.  It's a small, brightly lit shop with a few tables for those who want to have a cup of coffee and sit for a while.  I also noticed that they do special orders as 2 people came in while we were there to pick up items.  The staff is very friendly and patient.As for the other cupcakes we tried --- My husband had a lemon one which consists of a vanilla cake and lemon frosting.  He thought the flavoring in the frosting was great but thought the frosting was viscous.  The red velvet one was good but the flavoring could have been amped up.  The vanilla with vanilla frosting was decent but, again, the flavoring could have been stronger.  We tried a seasonal pumpkin cupcake and the flavoring was spot on.As for me, next time I'm in town, I will just order the fluffernutter cupcakes (as will our daughter).  Everybody else can have whatever they want. :)
2015-11-07,2,I had an assortment of 6 cupcakes. In short, they were not very good. Cupcakes overall were overly sweet, definitely to a fault. The cream cheese frosting literally tasted like cheese and sugar. I really have had grocery store cupcakes that tasted much better (think Whole Foods). Not sure how they stay in business... the people who work there are not particularly friendly either. Will not visit again
2015-11-05,5,My husband and I LOVE their cupcakes! Carrot cake is one of our favorites! Great, friendly neighborhood spot!
2015-10-27,5,Two very important milestones in my life will be forever remembered with a delicious cake from Sweet: my 30th Birthday and my engagement! Sweet bakes a scrumptious and moist banana chocolate chip cake with cream cheese icing that is addictive. Their cake and icing is not too "sweet" but perfectly balanced. The texture is pleasing as well in that it is smooth and thick. Thank you, Sweet, for your attention to flavor, design, and overall presentation!
2015-09-27,5,I am a cupcake snob and have tried them all (Carlos', Crumbs, Georgetown, Melissa's, Bodega's, Sprinkles, Magnolia's, and on and on), but these are by far the best I've ever tried. The cake is moist and flavorful and the frosting is sweet but not too sweet. Perfect combination, if you ask me. We had the pumpkin and chocolate coconut and if I could eat them every day, I would. Staff was super nice too. Can't wait to come back and try them all!
2015-09-24,5,My husband and I were in a pinch and needed a specific type of cupcake on short notice. We called around Hoboken and no one was willing to accommodate us in any way, except Sweet. We picked up the cupcake and it was delicious. I will definitely be patronizing this establishment again.
2015-09-18,5,Growing up in Hoboken we come back to town often to visit, walk around and for the many food places.  Found this place a few years ago while walking and just coming from the famous (over-hyped/over priced) bakery on Washington St.  So glad we did!  We LOVE our cupcakes and have been to many cupcake places in NY and along the East Coast.  They are always fresh & very consistent, never been disappointed!  My favorites are the lemon & the coconut, daughter loves the red velvet.  Soooo DELICIOUS! They also have very good flavored ice coffee.  Staff is very friendly.  Prices are reasonable for a very delicious product :)
2015-08-06,5,Sweet did an amazing job on my wife's 50th birthday cake. I brought in a sketch of her recently acquired 50th birthday tattoo and the made an exact copy, FREEHAND! see the pictures. not only was it beautiful it was really ,really, really tasty (unlike another local famous place) and the party-goers loved it. delivered exactly on time. Can't say enough great things. Stay Hungry.
2015-07-23,4,I have been to many-a cupcake place, and this one is just a step above most. I was really happy with the selection, and the staff was amazingly helpful and extremely polite. We drove over 1 hour out of the way to visit this place, and it was completely worth every minute spent.The cupcakes were a solid 8/10; I would have liked to see them a little more moist, but the icing was great. I would return here just for the friendly staff. They truly made you feel welcome and valued as a customer.
2015-07-08,5,Great service and delivery. Everybody from Shannon to the delivery person were extremely sweet and nice. They were very accommodating to my requests for the custom cake in a Chess board theme for husband who is a major chess fan. Cake was loved and admired by friends and everyone at his work too! Only minor thing would be that  even though the red velvet cake itself was super delicious, the fondant was a little on the too sweet side but that could be cuz I'm not really a sweet toothed person. Other than that, I'm extremely happy that I ordered from them and will be sure to re-order. They even delivered happily to jersey city for a minor delivery fee. Thank you Sweet team!
2015-05-23,5,My girlfriend got me cupcakes for my 30th birthday,  I love to golf so she chose a golf theme.  Not only did they look great but they were delicious! A huge hit with everyone at the party!
2015-05-21,4,I love their cupcakes. They are so good!!! Last time I ordered 40 cupcakes: 20 vanilla and 20 chocolate and asked for two different shades of blue. One shade of blue frosting on vanilla and another shade of blue frosting on chocolate. We discussed it for a few minutes and I was told that it wasn't a big deal. When I came to pick them up, the frosting was the same exact color on both. I asked what happened and they said that I did't ask for different shades. It would be okay but after promising it to me I obviously had a different expectation. Other than that they are great!
2015-04-10,5,Always delicious, Always fresh and ALWAYS happy with anything I get from here. Rice Krispie Peanut Butter Bars, Monster Brownies, Fudge Brownies, Cupakes and Cookies! EVERYTHING is soooo soooo good and mind blowingly delicious! Awesome  owner who in turn has a great staff! They make you feel like family! If you're looking for something Sweet and people who are Sweet you've found your place! Bring the kids, load them up with some Sweet happiness and then bring them to the park across the street to burn it off!
2015-02-24,4,Some flavors are better than others, but the selection is good overall. The coffee is very good (way better than you would expect from a cupcake shop). Try the mocha.
2015-01-14,4,Great cupcakes, really good flavors, and wonderful, helpful staff that make you feel welcome.
2014-12-23,2,I'm not really sure how this place stays in business. I live up the street & I walk past it all the time, but it's rarely open. It would be such a great spot for me to pick up a morning coffee if it were actually open in the morning while people are still drinking coffee.Today I finally walked past while it was open so I decided to try some cupcakes. I went in and only one of the 4 employees I saw was helping customers, so I waited for about 10 minutes until she was done with the customers ahead of me. I ordered some mini cupcakes & went over to the register where she directed me & waited for her to come ring me up. She did, and then promptly set my change on the counter & rushed away with a muttered thank you, even though there weren't any customers behind me.Now that I'm home and eating my cupcakes I'm seriously disappointed. The first one tastes like a child's stale peanut butter sandwich, and the other tastes like it's straight from a boxed mix. It had that strong artificial tang that burns your tongue a little. I guess they're very lucky to be across the street from an elementary school.
2014-11-25,5,I get cupcakes here for every occasion. They even decorate them for the appropriate theme. Best cupcakes ive ever had!
2014-11-23,5,I am from the south and my mom is the best cook ever. Their cupcakes are the closest thing to her cake that I've found. Cupcakes survive okay for a day or two in the fridge.
2014-11-08,1,Good cupcakes, but incredibly rude service.  The girl behind the counter had this attitude that she either had something better to do or was above this job.  But judging by the fact that she was working there, neither of those could be true.
2014-10-23,5,I had a pea in a pod baby shower theme and Loved the cake and cupcakes - they were beautiful!! Pictures say it all
2014-10-06,3,I ordered a baby shower cake for my sister.  I brought in a pic of the cake i wanted and told them the colors of the cake should be white and blue because my sister is having a boy.  The colors in the pic were pink and purple.  It was a very pricey cake but i didn't care, this is my twin sister having a baby boy and i would spend a million bucks if needed.  When i arrived to pick it up i got a pink and purple cake.  It was beautiful but it wasn't in the colors for a baby boy shower.  Luckily those colors happen to be my sister's favorite colors so it was okay but it wasn't what i ordered.  the cake was delicious and fresh and everyone loved it.  I would have given it 5 stars if the colors were correct.
2014-10-05,4,Expensive but  worth it for special occasions. They're very sweet cupcakes but for one or two they're also worth the calories. Really cool flavors like PB&J, red velvet, s'mores, etc. Great to bring to a party or event as dessert!
2014-10-04,5,Easily my favorite cupcake place in the area, including New York spots. The icing doesn't taste like pure butter, as Magnolia's does, and the cake is perfectly moist and melts in your mouth. Taste is great too. I happened upon this bakery something like 4 years ago, and it has been my favorite ever since. It's a bit pricey for sure, but the best quality things in life often are! Today I got the red velvet, pumpkin, and Bottom... Something. It was a chocolate chip cookie type thing. That one was okay, but the red velvet is my staple and pumpkin was equally delicious.
2014-10-03,5,Sweet is an awesome bakery. I went in on Tuesday to order a cake for Friday and they willingly helped me and answered every question I had about designs and flavors. I left the design up to them, I ordered the seasonal pumpkin cake with cream cheese filling. I picked it up this morning, and I was extremely happy with how it came out and how it tasted. The service was quick and super friendly. I would definetly recommend sweet for any bakery options. I've had their cupcakes as well, and they're delicious. Keep up the amazing work sweet!
2014-09-22,2,Okay,  I finally feel ready to report on my experience here after holding off a few weeks to process my disappointment.Was so excited to try Sweet that I bought four, count 'em 4, full sized items for myself, one small woman.  I could not contain myself and wanted to tear into everything right away, but, wait.... it was refrigerated and rock hard.  Most every cupcake specialty spot I've been to stores some inventory cold for future savoring and some at room temp to be devoured immediately.  Sweet, please adopt this as your protocol.I bought fluffer nutter, pumpkin, and mocha cupcakes and a key lime tart. Temperature aside, my chief complaints with the cupcakes are lack of innovation and lack of texture.For example, the fluffer nutter is vanilla cake topped with peanut butter icing and marshmallow . Sounds incredible.  Actually, meh. I took two bites and tossed it out.  The cake tasted out of the box. The icing was fine but it was all too one note.  How about putting the marshamallow as a delightful center to the cake?  Or maybe adding peanut butter chips to the cake batter?  Or using peanuts as a garnish?  A graham cracker crust on the bottom of the cake would have added a dimension of flavor and a welcome textural element.The cream cheese icing on the pumpkin was pretty great, but the cake itself lacked flavor.  It could have used more nutmeg or ginger to add a holiday spice.  How about walnuts as a garnish?  Or perhaps a dollop of cinnamon icing in the center for a sweet surprise?My point is, this is not the bakery section at a grocery store.  This is not even a bakery with a wide variety of options.  This is a cupcake place, and as such, I really think they need to step their game up. I'm sorry, but I was very underwhelmed.
2014-09-07,5,We ordered a cake for our daughter's birthday party on Thursday...the party was on Saturday; I don't recommend doing this, but we did.  With minimal instruction, they understood what we wanted and produced a beautiful cake.  Beautiful.  Ladybugs, leaves, perfect lettering - absolutely perfect.  And of course it was delicious.  Really odd how people feel they need smiles to be served well.  I'm sure they smiled when I was there, not that I care - I got a beautiful birthday cake ordered two days ahead!  I would absolutely use Sweet again.  Thank you so much for making my daughter's birthday so special.
2014-08-31,5,I adore the cupcakes here! I've been to various cupcake joints such as sprinkles, crumbs, Georgetown, magnolia's, and etc. Even though I've tried many cupcakes from various places, I'm not a huge fan of cupcakes or cakes because I'm very picky with the frosting. This place was an exception! My sister surprised me with the black bottom (chocolate cake topped with chocolate chip cheesecake) and red velvet (topped with cream cheese frosting) cupcakes for my birthday! Because they had to write on the cupcakes, they used different frosting or made the icing flat (see pics), so there wasn't a lot of frosting, which I love! Also, the cake itself was very fresh and moist! The flavors of the cake went very well with the frosting!! I absolutely enjoyed the great selection of the flavors.
2014-08-07,3,Im not a fan of the Cupcakes I rather flavored cake not flavored icing I will say this the.dark button cheesecake cookie combo is mind blowing
2014-08-03,4,I love that this place was recommended to me. I love that this place has regular and mini sized cupcakes! My favorite cupcake here is the fluffernutter. The peanut butter frosting is soooo good! It's peanut-y and not too sweet, which is great because with the sweet marshmallow fluff on top it's perfect! Their red velvet was pretty good, too. I like how their red velvet isn't BRIGHT RED like other stores. The artificial color kind of freaks me out. The cream cheese frosting on that one was really creamy and yummy, as well.
2014-07-08,1,Dramatically over-rated in every sense.The cupcakes are passable but there is no sign of innovation or creativity in the recipes. The most ordinary flavors are sold without any variation. Customer service is extremely lacking, no smiles. They make you feel like you need to hurry up and get out.
2014-04-26,5,The Red Velvet is AMAZING - and not to mention their ability to mix and match flavors that will send your taste buds into overdrive!
2014-04-04,5,I can't believe I've never written a review for Sweet, this place is the BEST. Every time I go the staff is friendly and quick and the cupcakes are fresh. Its also fun to stop by around the holidays to see what special flavors they have. I think over the years I've tried every flavor they have and the one I keep going back for is the Mocha Chocolate cupcake. Amazing!  Other great flavors are the chocolate cupcake with peanut butter frosting, lemon, and chocolate and vanilla frosting. For those who are wondering the flavor is sweet frosting with not too sweet cake so that when you take a bite it's the perfect balance of sweetness in your mouth.
2014-03-30,5,We had Sweet cupcakes and cookies for a party at Hudson River CrossFit. Everything was presented beautifully, but more importantly tasted absolutely delicious. I'm not usually a huge sweet eater, but I polished off about half a dozen toasted coconut cupcakes, and still found myself crazing a cookie. This place a welcome respite from all the cookie cutter chain restaurants and bakeries that line Washington.
2014-03-30,5,I cannot thank sweet enough for making the most amazing cupcakes and cookies for the Hudson RiveR CrossFit birthday party! The mini kettlebells, the personalized touches to every cookie! What an amazing place! The peanut butter and fluff cupcakes.. Wow. Thank to sweet for making our party so special!
2014-02-04,1,Was right on the street and decided not to go to crumbs to try this little tiny place. Not only the cupcakes were bad but they were so expensive. the tiny one's which are one bite are for $1.60, I can probably make a dozen in $3 and regular size and much better.Their customer service was rude and not polite at all. Never going back!
2014-02-01,3,Cupcakes are ok. The girl at the register has an attitude problem.
2013-12-22,5,The Hubs ordered a vanilla cake for my Birthday and it was delicious! Seriously, it was the best. It was moist, dense, and very tasty. It honestly made my day a little more special. I 100% recommend them.
2013-11-30,5,Best cupcakes I've had. My favorites: the banana and the vanilla cupcakes.  I also enjoyed their vanilla cake; however, I'm not sure how often they have this available. Lastly, the owner is very friendly, so my visits at Sweet are invariably wonderful.
2013-11-27,2,Agree with some earlier reviews. Cupcakes are tasty but service leaves A LOT to be desired. I hope a real baker moves into Hoboken and teaches them how to run a business properly.
2013-11-15,4,Was walking through Hoboken just going on an adventure through it and happened to come upon this place. Walking up to the corner my friend and I were wondering where that amazing smell was coming from. Turns out it was from Sweets. Initially we just turned the corner and walked by but the smell was so amazing that we decided to take a quick look inside. The cupcakes there looked DELICIOUS! But I'm happy to say I was able to restrain myself and only ordered a coffee. Giving it a 4/5 stars because the coffee was pretty ehhhh. I consider myself a coffee connoisseur and it took a LOT of sugar to make that coffee good.But I will definitely be back to try out the cupcakes.
2013-11-15,4,I had never heard or seen this place before but the WONDERFUL smell made me turn my head and make my nostrils flare up as I was walking down the street. Had to see where the smell was coming from! I didn't get anything as I was in a rush. My friend got a coffee which I'm assuming wasn't anything out of the ordinary. But the little cupcakes and treats were so cute and yummy looking! I am definitely coming back soon to try one.. or two.. or ten of those..
2013-10-26,3,It's undeniable that the goods here are delicious. I just had a perfectly crafted cheddar scone, it was wonderful. But - the service leaves much to be desired. In particular, I'm talking about the sullen server with the purple hair. She acts like she's doing us a favor by taking the order. In the half an hour I spent inside here I witnessed her be short and curt with nearly every customer. The two other ladies seemed nice enough, but they stayed out of the way of the Nasty Nancy. For such a "sweet" place, she seems out of place.
2013-10-08,4,This has been my little spot for a while now. I am surprised I have not written a review for this.Nice and cozy feel to this place, I remember it used to be awful looking candy store.   Now it's a Cupcake spot with the moistest cupcake I have tasted.  Yes! They have the trendy mini cupcakes too, don't worry.  However, one will not have a sugar attack or be attacked by tourist. Unlike Magnolia Bakery (really that place should be called "Sweet as "ish" " The décor is all white with metal tables. The seating is limited.  Yet, it is never a problem to get a seat. What is great if one cannot find a seat there is a park right across the street.  You can grab a La Colombe coffee. Then be amazed by their wide assortment of cupcakes.  I particularly enjoy the chocolate cupcake/ chocolate frosted butter cream, so damned delicious. It's not overbearing. I usually do not like the frosting on my cup cake. The owner is a very "SWEET" woman. She is always ready to chat, very approachable. Even more reason to check it out. It's always a joy to visit a place where the workers and owner are happy to be there!
2013-10-06,2,Cupcakes are a dime a dozen and SWEET's service is anything butSORRY but product isn't the only important thing to merit reviews. Both times I've called or gone inside, the service has been deplorable and I won't be back. The clerk stuffed my desserts into a flimsy, sandwich-sized wax bag and when I winced she told me they would survive the mangling. I insisted on individual bags and she grudgingly obliged but then quickly disappeared without an offer to package my desserts to take home. How about a bag or box?SWEET should take some cues on how to treat customers with professional courtesy if they'd like to lure folks from the red velvet ropes only a few blocks away!
2013-09-20,5,It's a family tradition that every special occasion is celebrated with a Sweet cake or cupcake. My son & husband yelp with delight when I pull out their signature brown box. We've now ordered five cakes from them, each customized beautifully. Angela is a delight to work with! And who doesn't love a Friday mini cupcake at Sweet after a playground playdate?
2013-08-27,5,The most amazing cupcake I ever ate.  I had the red velvet with cream cheese frosting and it was heaven in a cupcake wrapper.  The best part is that I was walking my granddaughter in her stroller on a Monday and the cupcakes happened to be free for about an hour that day.  Francesca, who is 4, and I were in cupcake heaven.  Oh by the way she had the chocolate one and said it was yummy.......
2013-08-17,4,They have this wonderful cupcake with chocolate cake on the bottom and cheesecake cake on top.  I think about it often.  It's one of the most delicious cupcakes I've ever had.  All of the others flavors are great - moist, tasty icing and toppings, but I have my favorite.  It's available every day and I try to talk myself out of going to get one every day.
2013-08-12,5,We were lucky enough to get one of the 500 free cupcakes they gave out today for their 5 year anniversary. I've lived in Hoboken for the past 5-6 years but never had one of their cupcakes. It was by far the best cupcake in Hoboken. The chocolate cupcake was amazing, I will definitely be back!
2013-08-05,4,Best cupcakes I've ever had! The cake itself is so light and fluffy, and the icing is rich and buttery. Just perfect. I stop by whenever I'm in the area and I order cakes or cupcakes from them anytime I have a family gathering. My family is also head over heels for sweet. I must say though, the customer service is a bit awkward at times. I'm not sure if anyone else picked up that vibe? At times they'll be very friendly and the next minute they seem to be irritated. Either way, the owner needs to correct that problem because she can definitely lose business that way.
2013-07-27,5,The BEST dessert in hoboken that makes crumbs taste like it was make in an ez-bake oven. Excellent customer service that always comes with a smile. The chocolate ganache cupcake will knock your socks off. The only downside was that it was on my walk every day to and from work and I could not resist going in.
2013-06-01,4,The best dessert bake shop in Hoboken, by a mile.  It comes down to quality ingredients, classic and inventive recipes, prepared by expert bakers.  Cupcakes can be purchased in full or mini sizes.  I highly recommend the rice-crispy treat covered in chocolate peanut butter fudge.  Ridiculous.
2013-05-30,5,Delicious! Best iced mocha that starts with a fresh brew of espresso and rich chocolate. Mini cupcakes are definitely the way to go - lots of variety, reasonably priced (and sized).  Nice location by Church Square Park with chill atmosphere and usually enough tables to sit for a bit and enjoy.
2013-05-18,3,Reasonably cute little Hoboken shop just off the main drag. It could be a really cute option over the tourist cake boss shop down the block, but the product nor atmosphere really lived up to its potential nor to the cuteness of the Hoboken neighborhood. Awkward customer service. We were only half way in the store and the woman glared at us " CAN I HELP YOU?!?"Dude, smile and give your customers a freaking minute to at least walk fully in the door and get a chance to at least glance over the product. Anyways, her weird attitude made me feel rushed despite there were no other customers in the shop at that time. I tried the Toasted Coconut and the Mocha cupcakes. The coffee/teas didn't look special, and with many nearby specialty shops we decided against getting drinks there. The cake of the cupcake was mediocre, it wasn't overly dry, but it wasn't particularly moist or enjoyable either. I really liked the toasted coconut frosting, which was a slightly chocolately mousse buttercream with toasted coconut flakes. On the mocha cupcake, I appreciated the fudgely layer below the frosting. The frosting itself was a little dense and artificial tasting, I wish that I had gone for the peanut butter instead. It's fresher and a little better than chains like Magnolia or Crumbs, but for a potentially cute neighborhood shop that home makes the cupcakes, they could be doing a lot better.
2013-05-06,4,Great place for cupcakes! Especially if you want a nice red velvet cupcake. Red velvet  cupcake has been my thing for a long time, I've tried them at almost every single cupcake places I've been to to. The red velvet cupcake at sweet is probably one of my favorite, the cake itself is so fluffy and flavorful, and that sweet frosting perfects it.
2013-04-21,5,Honestly these are the best cupcakes EVER.  I've tried Sprinkles, Cupcakes by Carousel, Crumbs, Mr. Cupcake, and nothing holds a candle to Sweet's red velvet.  Whenever I bring some in to work, they're gone in a flash, because everyone loves sweet!  We even bring them to every family event as our dessert, because we could never make anything as good.  I'm just glad that we live pretty far north and west in Hoboken, because if we didn't I would be enormous.
2013-04-17,4,I work at a cupcake shop, so I know a bit about what great cupcakes are like-and these have almost completely turned me off from the ones I sell! They're baked in the store, so they taste super fresh and home made. I thought I loved the ones at my job but these stole my heart.I suggest the chocolate one topped with cheesecake, I was sent out to get them at my internship and everybody fell in love with them. I didn't have it but the red velvet was also recommended. My co-workers demolished them all. My only issue was the staff were fairly unfriendly, both to me and to the customer that came in after me. I understand how much it sucks to serve people all day but I'm hyper-aware of service since I've been doing it for a while.Prices are also super reasonable considering the size of these them. Be prepared to cheat on all of your other cupcake spots.
2013-04-16,4,We came on a Sunday afternoon and were the only people there - the service was friendly and prompt and the tables clean enough. I tried the mini fluffernutter cupcake and the key lime bar. The cupcake was decent - a great top, with thick peanut butter frosting and a smooth marshmallow fluff mouthful, but the cake was a bit dry and dense. The key lime bar was DELICIOUS. Moist crumbly crust on the bottom, not very thick, but that was okay because the key lime part was creamy and cold from being chilled and perfectly limey without being too tart or at all eggy (which I hate). I'll probably be eating more of those key lime bars.
2013-04-09,4,Cute cupcake shop.Recipe is top secret! Don't you dare peek into the kitchen on your way to the bathroom for fear of having the curtain closed in your face. Whoa, buddy. They serve one of my favorite coffee brands: La Colombe Torrefaction! YUM. So drip here is awesome. Cupcake (chocolate) is good- too sweet for my taste.... but definitely moist and yummy!
2013-04-01,3,Taste was ok. But not friendly, the lady behind counter had put my cupcake in the bag upside down totally ruining the cupcake.
2013-03-05,5,We bought eighty of their cupcakes for our wedding dessert buffet and they were a hit. The flavors are varied, delicious,and both traditional and unique. The server was friendly, informative, and helpful.  We had trouble getting there before closing due to a weather related traffic pattern and they were kind enough to leave our order with a neighboring business for us to pick up. That alone makes me want to patronize them more.  They actually care about their customers. My whole  family preferred their cupcakes to those of the cupcake chain a few blocks away because they were tastier, fresher, prepared without preservatives, and much more affordable. Craving them now!
2013-02-10,3,The cupcakes are yummy but the service is lacking. For example - I placed an order through the website and called three days later because I had not heard back from them.  The women who answered the phone said they were "too busy doing other stuff to check email" so they had not processed my order.
2013-01-30,4,Great local cupcake place! Leaps and bounds better than crumbs! There is a pretty good mix of cupcakes all equally tasty. My favorite is the fluffer nutter, holy bejesus it's good...probably not that good for you, but what things in life are? It's tiny but go in and grab your cupcakes and go. They also have mini cupcakes, which I find almost a bit ironic as cupcakes are mini cakes and mini cupcakes are mini's of mini's...anyway. They aren't really that pricey at about 3 bucks for most cupcakes, obviously more than you'll pay for a dozen at shop rite but these are goooood. I have a gut feeling though that the cupcake trend is on the way out, for the sake of keeping sweet alivin and kickin' I hope this isn't true. Cupcakes make everyone happy.
2013-01-19,5,My favorite bakery by far! My must orders are red velvet, lemon, and peanut butter. Occasionally I'll get a classic vanilla with vanilla icing. I've tried most of the others which are all great (I haven't had one that I didn't like yet), but it's usually hard to talk me out of my three favorites. As far as the price, good quality cupcakes are worth it.
2013-01-07,4,Cool little bakery on the corner.  Staff was friendly and helpful and the cupcakes were fantastic!  Coffee was very good as well.  Feels good giving the business to a "mom and pop shop" over one of the big name coffee houses/bakeries.
2012-10-21,3,Their pumpkin cupcake was yummy.  The latte was good but not my go to spot for coffee/espresso drinks. Service was adequate and polite but not with a smile.
2012-10-17,3,Cupcakes were ok ..but $9.00 for a six pack of minis is way too much money for what your getting.
2012-09-25,5,Love this place for classic cupcakes.  They're "mini" cupcakes are amazing and are perfect for when I want to bring a sampling to a dinner get-together with friends so we can have dessert.  It's reasonably priced (as far as gourmet-cupcakes go) and always moist and delicious.  And there's never a wait because of it's location in Hoboken - unlike Carlos Bakery, which is good, but overrated.  Go to Sweet for cupcakes - so so good!
2012-07-17,3,The cupcakes are fine. Good, not great.  Am I the only one who thinks the cupcakes too dense and too dry? The flavors a great, but that density and dryness, don't get it. I can make better myself.
2012-07-11,5,AMAZING cupcakes! Was going to visit a friend and wanted to get something sweet for her. There was a huge line at Carlos bakery as usual so decided to do a yelp search for another cupcake store close by and i was lucky to find Sweet 5 mins walk from Carlos. I have had Carlos before and i think "Sweet" makes better cupcakes and the best part is there is no line. They offer 2 sizes mini and regular. I got 9 minis for my friend which were 12$ and 4 regular for home $10. Got red velvet, mocha and choc ganache. The best one was red velvet and the other two were great too - so moist and soft. Yummm
2012-07-07,4,This is a "cute" little spot on the corner of Garden St and 4th. It amazes me how such a small location generates income but when the cupcakes are this good I can see how.  They offer 2 sizes of cupcakes.  A regular sized cupcake and minis.  The minis are great for kids.  Today I got 6 mini's for $8.50 but I think individually they are $1.50.  They had several flavors: choc/peanut butter, choc ganash. choc coconut, red velvet, vanilla coconut, white cake with choc frosting, and some marshmellow ones.  We had the white cake with choc cocunut and the choc peanut butter  I've ben here several times and they have never disappointed.  The cupcakes are VERY VERY sweet but they taste so good.  Even beter with a cold cup of milk. The staff is friendly.  Last time they let my son use thier bathroom whih scored major points with me as I didnt want to walk around with a toddler with wet pants.... LOL Today I only spent $8.50 and when I was going to pay I realized they had a sign to spend $10 to use the credit card so I was about to order another cupcake and the girl was nice enough o say "don't worry about that" I really didn't need my arm twisted to order another cupcake... But was appreciative of the girl not making me buy more than I originally intended.  One question I do have is why is EVERY cupcake place I know closed on Mondays? Are they all in cupckae conferences or something?  What if I need my cupcake fix on a Monday????
2012-06-12,5,Their mini cupcakes are freakin awesome. Tried this place for the first time and was not disappointed. Red velvet are heaven. My least favorite was the marshmallow one. Still tasty but not my fav.Great Place and I def will be back if I'm in the area.
2012-06-10,5,I visited Sweet Bake shop and the cupcakes were perfectly moist and delicious. Favorites include peanut butter and marshmallow cupcake and lemon bars. Very nice staff and spotlessly clean. Also best red velvet cupcake!
2012-05-26,4,I'm so glad I listened to the reviews. I've had cupcakes from Carlos Bakery, and Sweet makes much yummier ones. Nothing like a good cupcake to perk up your day!
2012-05-19,5,Love the cupcakes!!  Also happy that you can get mini cupcakes :) By far the best cupcakes I've had in the area (including NYC).
2012-05-09,5,I love this place!!! The red velvet cupcakes are super moist; but my favorite is the coconut cupcake, delicious vanilla cake with cream cheese frosting and toasted coconut on top, yum! My husband raves about the peanut butter cupcake (chocolate cake with peanut butter frosting). I highly recommend this place!
2012-04-28,5,This is the kind of place that makes me so happy I live in Hoboken.  Never saw it before and then i randomly saw this lil place on a corner while walking.  Everything looks amazing, I went with a peanut butter and chocolate rice krispie treat, which was awesome.  Can't wait to come back for more stuff.The owner is also a very nice woman
2012-04-09,3,I ran in here about 40 minutes before they closed on Sunday. I was dying for some sweets for some reason and after a quick google map search and a cross reference on yelp I found Sweet. It's a cute little bakery/cafe right on the corner of 4th & Garden, across the street from a park and a pizza shop (good location). Not sure if they do this every day or if it was only an Easter special but they had a cupcake happy hour from 5-6pm--buy one cupcake get one free!While they didnt have the desserts i *really* wanted to try in stock (it was almost closing time), we ended up getting vanilla on vanilla, red velvets, marshmallow, and coconut topped cupcakes. For easter they put pastel colored M&Ms on top.  Overall the cupcakes were pretty good (i think magnolia's cupcakes are better, though Sweet is cheaper than most other places). The workers themselves were friendly. The cashier also made an awesome vanilla latte.I liked that they have both a full size and a mini size cupcake. So if you want to try multiple flavors, definitely get a bunch of minis so you won't feel like a pig stuffing your face!would come back again to try what i actually wanted: keylime bar, strawberry cupcake and carrot cake
2012-03-02,3,I think I just have to accept that maybe I just don't like cupcakes, and maybe it's not the fault of any of these many cupcake shops that have taken the country by storm. I picked up four cupcakes to try with the bf a couple weeks ago: red velvet, carrot cake, coconut, and peanut butter. Honestly I can't remember much about them, other than they were all REALLY sweet and a little dry, and we had enough after trying a bite of each. But the sweetness level was not any different than most other places, so maybe I should just give up on cupcakes. Maybe they're just not for everyone.As for my experience in the shop: the guy behind the counter was ok. Not friendly, not unfriendly, just did his job. I will say that he was quite the saint for putting up with this family of three that was there: mom, dad, and little bratty girl, who managed to take all of the entire seating (not much to begin with; like two tables and seating for maybe 6?) But anyway, this bratty child was stomping back and forth on the bench that lined one wall, and cupcake crumbs and frosting was EVERYWHERE. All over the bench, chairs, tables, floor. They left while I was there, and while the dad did grab some napkins to give the furniture a few cursory wipes, they left most of their mess behind. I really hope they at least left a decent tip in the tip jar.
2012-03-01,4,This is only the first half of the review, as i haven't actually received the product.  But i called for a birthday cake, and they took the order, even though they typically require more notice. I appreciate them making accomodations, and look forward to trying the cake.  I could never imagine going to the bakery that will remain nameless.  Those lines are dreadful and their reviews match that of Dunkin Donuts.....
2012-02-19,5,This place was great, although a little hard to find if you're not from the area. We happened to turn down a side street from Washington and came across this place. It was crowded and we took that to be a good sign. We had an assortment of mini cupcakes: fluffer nutter, chocolate marshmallow and cheesecake chocolate chip. We also had a cheesecake bar. Everything was fresh and really delicious and prices were reasonable. Beats Crumbs or some of the other chains that offer too many ingredients and higher prices.Bakery is right across from a park with ample seating. Would definitely recommend over nearby Crumbs.
2012-02-11,4,I went here today and had a strawberry cupcake with cream cheese frosting... AMAZING! I think cupcakes are sweet's speciality!
2012-02-05,4,This is where I go when I am too lazy to make my own cupcakes. The selection is HUGE and the have normal size cupcakes and cute mini cupcakes.  Something for everyone.  oh and did I mention they are delicious!!!!! cute store front simple and clean. They taste better than Carlos.
2012-01-29,3,When I am entertaining guests and need to purchase dessert in a pinch - I love to stop by Sweet to grab a variety of mini cupcakes.  They are light, fluffly and sweet. I am not a cupcake fan, but my guests do really seem to like these little gems.
2012-01-22,4,these cupcakes are simply delicious.  emphasis on the simple. they are not over the top with 80 ingredients like a lot of the trendy cupcakes these days- they are SO fresh, flavorful and tasty! never dry, never greasy- always cooked to perfection! their icing is creamy, thick and not oily, greasy or fake tasting like icing can sometimes tend to taste- the icing perfectly compliments the spongy, moist cake.my faves are: banana and red velvet- they are the best!!! my mom loves the coconut ones too.my only complaint about this place is the way it's run.  the hours are stupid.  they should be open later.  the other night i had to grab one quick for my friend's bday- they closed at 7 and i missed it by a few mins but the lights were on and the workers were still in there- cupcakes still in the case.  like come on! i'll pay cash!! the cupcakes are only gonna go stale!!! they wouldn't open the door for me. a-holes...also, they wouldn't let me in with my puppy one time- even though i agreed to hold him. come on, you're in hoboken! dogs are like kids here. i'm not tying my puppy on the busy street corner for a cupcake.  they're in a case...so, i don't like their inflexibility and lack of coolness on those issues.but, the point is: the cupcakes are so amazing :)
2012-01-22,5,This is a long overdue review, but I've finally remembered!  :)  I needed a small wedding cake in a very short amount of time and over Thanksgiving weekend! Not only did they make me one, with amazing customer service and a recipe to die for, but they were OPEN on Thanksgiving day and I was able to pick it up just in time!  I mean, come on, who does that?!?   I ordered a red velvet wedding cake with an ivory frosting and white tiny polka dots as trim.  It was perfection!!!  The people in there were so kind to me (and my toddler!) and it was an all around exceptional experience!  So, I felt compelled to write and make sure that people check this bakery out!  Please do!!!  You will not be disappointed!!  :D
2011-12-30,5,Best red velvet cupcake ever.  Moist spongy slightly sweet dense cake, topped by tangy creamy cream cheese frosting.  I dream of this cupcake when I'm away.  The vanilla buttermilk and pumpkin (with cream cheese frosting) were also fantastic, never too sweet or too heavy on the frosting (both cupcake pet peeves of mine).  The coconut was my least favorite; it was just OK.  (I prefer my own, made with Ina Garten's recipe).I love that they have mini cupcakes--you can try several different flavors of mini cupcakes instead of blowing all of your allotted naughty calories of the day on a single flavor cupcake.  The mini cupcakes don't sacrifice any of the flavor or texture of their bigger siblings; they're just as good.It's also a really cute shop with blue-and-white decor located near a park, and the people behind the cupcake display counters are always friendly, particularly to kids.  I always feel happy, and reconnect with my inner kid, whenever I stop by and fill a little cardboard box with cupcakes.  Ummm...any thoughts about opening a branch in NC?  *hint hint*
2011-12-12,5,I have lived in four major cities in my life, and I had favorite cupcake places in all of them (Seattle--Trophy, Chicago--Sweet Mandy B's, etc.)These are my favorite. Sweet's frosting is buttery without being greasy, sugary without being sickening and their cream cheese frosting is THE BEST. And their cake is not too dry, which I find tends to be a problem at a lot of places...(although I think their chocolate can have some off days in this department).My go-to favorites:1. Banana2. Vanilla Coconut3. Fluffernutter4. The classic! Vanilla vanilla5. PumpkinI do also wish the hours could be later, but I have a feeling that they are the way they are because they don't get a lot of business after a certain point in the day. So I'll just have to work around that--and it's totally worth it.
2011-11-17,3,Like the cupcakes - especially the mini sizes - but hate the hours. How is one supposed to take a post-dinner cupcake stroll when they close so early every day? I'm not looking for a 2 am drunken dessert run, 9:30 would do just fine...that's a 1 star demotion in my book.
2011-11-16,3,My standard is red velvet.  For the sake of consistency, I judge cupcake stores simply on their ability to make good red velvet, and unfortunately, Sweet just didn't cut it for me.  The cupcake itself was pretty dense, but the thing that really stood out was the lack of tang in the frosting.  A good red velvet, in my mind, has a nice tangy cream cheese frosting, and if they are really good, a bit of a buttermilk flavor in the cake itself.  These cupcakes lacked both.Also, I had to fight for a box to buy my cupcakes.  We were about to head back on a bus, so I wanted to have a box to protect the cupcakes from getting squished, but they tried to convince me to use a bag instead, which didn't seem very practical for my situation.  I'm a Prius-driving, canvas-bag-toting, recycling, environmentalist from Seattle.  The one thing I try to do is to not collect unnecessary bags or boxes, so I really wouldn't ask for a box if I didn't think it were necessary.  They seemed less convinced.Overall, both the cupcake and the service were just average.
2011-11-06,4,Not a big fan of cupcakes unless they are from a well know bakery like this one ;)  My cousin Yelped this place so I decided to give it a shot.  Went here with a friend and we tried red velvet with the cream cheese frosting.  I was very excited to have eaten it here!  SOoooo GOOD!!Then I had a peanut butter cupcake to go, and ended up eating it before walking out of the place.  Like I said, Im usually not a fan of homemade cupcakes especially but these cupcakes are very good.  I will swing by here again one day and try other varieties.  The place isnt big at all, but the place is a HIT!
2011-10-24,2,I love cupcakes and have made it my mission to try cupcakes whenever I have the opportunity.   Sweet was a cute neighborhood cupcake shop.  The selection was limited but I liked the fact that they had minis, although they didn't have containers when you buy a few, just put them in a bag, which makes transport a bit tricky.As far as the taste, it was just OK.   I had the coconut and also the peanut butter and fluff.  The cake was dry the icing was decent.  The reason for my negative review was due to the fact that there were lumps of unmixed batter in the cupcakes.  I was wondering why there were little (chunks) in my vanila cake when I was eating the coconut.  I originally thought it was a hard piece of coconut.   When I tried the pb & fluff cupcake I felt more of the same lumps.   I sifted through the remaining cupcake and came up with a few lumps that were just covered pieces of dry mix.   That to me is a rookie mistake and that should not be happening in a "gourmet" cupcake shop.  I would have liked to have given a positive review, but the "lumpy" vanilla cupcake was not enjoyable.
2011-10-17,5,The best cupcakes in the world are made at Sweet. It's a one of a kind bakery that gets by on it's genuine quality and neighborhood patronage. First off, the location is adorable. A corner spot across from a cute park with basketball courts, a dog run, playground, etc. - so if it's a nice day outside you can find a park bench and enjoy your sweet treat in the company of others outside. Most importantly, the quality can not be beat! Everything is fresh and baked on the premises. It's so fresh that they don't even keep anything in the fridge on Monday (the one day they are closed), but instead they sell all their remaining cupcakes on Sunday afternoons from 5-6pm buy-one-get-one-free for cupcake Happy Hour! My favorites include Red Velvet (ahhh-mazing!), Carrot Cake, & Peanut Butter - of course, the standard chocolate/vanilla is also fantastic in any combination! All you fools should venture off of Washington Street and away from Crumbs to get some real cupcakes at SWEET!
2011-09-01,4,I have a pretty short list of things that annoy me:- People who ignore text messages- Cardio queens- Rudeness- CaloriesOkay, so that last one....why on earth would I be in a dessert shop if I avoid calories (and most things deemed enjoyable) like the black plague? Anger. Actually...it was Italian woman rage. I stormed off the Path, stomped up Washington street (steered clear of the gym) and stampeded into Sweet.And I was SO......happy to find that they have mini cupcakes! So even when I'm being bad and indulging my inner bitch with sugar, butter and chocolate...it doesn't derail me entirely or force me to wear my fat clothes for three days. The cupcake was really good (I just got one chocolate one to go) and it quelled the fire that was burning inside of me. I want to go back and try some of their other flavors, like red velvet and pumpkin.
2011-08-26,5,Baby's 1st Birthday - need I say more?It turns out the very 1st birthday of your little munchkin is a pretty big deal despite the fact he has no idea what is going on nor will he remember that. Anyway, it is a big deal. Party. Balloons. Family. Friends. Food. And the cake.I spent a few days searching for a bakery that would make 1) a yummy cake 2) that looks good 3) and won't make me faint when I pay for it.After some brainstorming with my husband we decided for a chocolate cake, aqua on the outside with a turquoise whale (or maybe I decided and eventually he agreed when he saw I was not going to say yes to a spiderman :)It was a pleasure to deal with Angela, she was very accommodating and created a cake that looked way better than the one I saw in my imagination. It was perfect! It was fun and cute and it was really aqua and turquoise! Also, the cake was very heavy (you can tell she put some serious loads of chocolate in there). And it tasted delicious! Sadly, our guests wanted to take a piece with them so most of the yummy cake suddenly disappeared but I managed to save a quarter for myself (yes, I am greedy when it comes to sweet stuff, my husband doesn't like sweets anyway and it is not healthy for the baby :) I have a feeling I will be back. Luckily, there's always a reason for a cake or cupcakes!PS: I attached a picture for those who have never seen an aqua & turquoise cake.
2011-08-20,5,This place is adorable! I remember when it opened around the corner from my apartment and I was so excited because it just looked so cute. She makes wonderful cupcakes that just melt in your mouth. They are to die for. Love the red velvet cupcakes. I was sad when I moved away because I knew I would be missing these.
2011-07-13,4,The money cupcakes...*Pumpkin*Carrot Cake*Banana*Red VelvetMONEY.  Trust me.
2011-05-14,3,After a lunch with my cousins, we wanted to grab dessert and being that all 3 of us have large sweet tooths, I yelped the nearest cupcake place and Sweet came up. Cute little shop on the corner 4th and Garden St. There's 3 small tables if you choose to eat your treats here. They offer 2 sizes for their cupcakes: Mini ($1.50) / Regular ($2.75). This is always good for when you want to try a couple of different flavors but don't want the extra calories that come with those big cupcakes!We each ordered 2. I had the Peanut Butter (Choc cake w/ Peanut Butter frosting) and the Classic Vanilla with Chocolate Buttercream frosting. My cousins had the Marshmallow, Ganache, and Mocha. They were all good! Cakes were a good consistency and the frosting wasn't too sweet. Prices are definitely cheaper than the NYC cupcake spots. They also have a variety of cookies and bars.
2011-05-01,2,After visiting Carlo's Bakery I decided to walk on over to Sweet's.  I had read many great reviews from fellow yelper's so I knew I had to give it a try.The shop is small but quaint.  The girl helping me was friendly.  I ordered 3 of their mini cupcakes and one regular sized cupcake.I know I'm in the minority here but......I was not impressed.  To ME, the cupcakes were dry and not very flavorful.   The frosting was not to my liking either.  Sorry, i wanted to like their cupcakes but it just didn't work out........
2011-04-28,5,I love cupcakes and have been searching for a really great red velvet. A friend suggested I try Sweet and I'm so glad I did! Their red velvet is amazing, as are their vanilla & chocolate! Can't wait to go back and try out other flavors. The staff is friendly and accommodating, my new cupcake spot!
2011-04-04,5,This place was great! my boyfriends sister loves chocolate so for her birthday i wanted to get an assortment of cupcakes for her to try. I live in Hoboken so I figured picking them up before I headed to AC would be easiest. I called ahead and gave them my order of 18 mini cupcakes. They assured me the cupcakes would travel well and not to worry about the ganache needing to be kept cold. They were right! Not only were they very pretty, they tasted amazing! I thought the cake was moist and the icing was sweet but not too grainy or processed tasting which you sometimes get with cupcakes. Even after refrigerating the few that werent devoured overnight, they held up well. In addition, the service was great. After I told them I was traveling and needed to grab them at the time the store opened (9am), they took down my order and everything went seamlessly the next day when I picked them up. They had boxes to hold nine mini cupcakes each, so traveling with them wasn't hard at all. She even taped them shut and gave me a handled bag so they didnt shift!I ordered the following:Red velvet: my bf's sister thought thy were greatPeanut butter: these were yummy especially if you are a pb fan. You could smell them right awayChocolate on chocolate: great if you like chocolate. The icing was light and smooth. Chocolate ganache: probably my favorite. I loved the ganache layer that gave the cupcake a cool contrasting texture and flavor. These were a little sweeter than the other cakes, so if you're not keen on the sweet and sugary taste, try the chocolate on chocolate. Carrot cake: who doesn't love mini carrot cupcakes? I didnt get the carrot taste where you sometimes crunch down on bits of carrots or nuts as you can with carrot cake but I prefer it that way. I cant wait to go back and try the other flavors and some of the larger versions! Minis 1.50 each*Regular: 2.25-2.00 each**they have special prices if you buy in larger prices
2011-03-24,4,Better cupcakes than Crumbs and priced better too. Simple and satisfying.  Sweet offers specials around the holidays and I heard they are looking to offer more variety soon.
2011-03-16,3,I dragged my boyfriend here in the rain when I saw their cute website - cute websites usually translate to chic cupcakeries from my experience. Or maybe not (see my review for International Pastry.......) The shop is small and really cute inside, just as I suspected it would be. They have both mini and regular sized cupcakes, and are all quite enticing to the eye. Sadly for taste however, these cupcakes were just okay. Maybe among the best I've had in NJ, but not really comparable to my favorites in the city (like Butter Lane or CupcakeStop). The cakes themselves were pretty good. I think I liked the cream cheese frostings better than the cupcakes with buttercream - which is unusual for me - but the buttercream was too stiff (not like the kind you get at Butter Lane!) As for their other desserts - my boyfriend was really excited to see creme brulee on their menu - but they didn't have any that day. I LOVE key lime pie so I went for 2 key lime bars but after taking a bite of one I discovered they were way too sour (not tart....just sour) so I ended up tossing the other one. Maybe it was a bad batch? Definitely needed some more sugar or maybe condensed milk/whatever they use to make it creamy.Overall, not bad, but if you're heading into Manhattan anyway, might as well skip Sweet and go for some place like Butter Lane.
2011-03-15,4,Mini cupcakes taste better than the regular sizes.....Yup that's basically all I really have to say. I ordered a mini and a regular (oink oink) of the mocha, ganache, red velvet, and chocolate.   The minis were lovely bites that melted in my mouth.  The regulars were ok but a bit dry and sooo did not melt in my mouth.  The cupcakes are decorated pretty regular, but I'm all about taste anyways. It's a cute little bakery with cute little cupcakes, I recommend if you're in the area.  I'd go back but I'd just get the minis.
2011-03-01,5,This place is aptly named, you get just enough without feeling like you're going to lapse into a diabetic coma.  Interesting selection, balanced flavor, and reasonable portions unlike some other places in town.  The place itself is charming, and you gotta support local businesses!
2011-02-07,4,Decent cupcake shop, though still in my mind cupcake shops are way overpriced (thought Sweet isn't too bad compared to some in NYC).  The fluffer nutter and red velvet cupcakes are legit.  The key lime bar we had was pretty good too.I still hold a good old Funfetti cupcakes as my first place cupcake, but Sweet has some that can hang a close second place.
2011-01-05,5,Sundays from 6-7 = cupcake "happy hour" (aka half price) since they're closed Monday and need to clear inventory of delectable convections...
2011-01-04,5,I love their location! It's located right in the corner of the street. Tables are facing big windows so you can sit, chit-chat and enjoy the scenery. It was a blistering, cold day so I stumbled in and got myself a red velvet cupcake and a cup of hot cocoa. The cupcake was moist and the frosting wasn't overly sweet. The two went well with each other. I left happy and was on my merry way...$2.75 for a regular cupcake. Chyeaa.
2010-11-22,5,I live across the street from Sweet and it's so hard to resist the temptation to go in there every time I leave my apartment! The cupcakes not only look great, but taste great as well. I love their cream cheese frosting on the red velvet and pumpkin cupcakes. It's perfect and not overly cream cheesy. I'm also a big fan of their buttercream frosting and the peanut butter frosting. I've seen some pictures of their speciality cakes online and I will definitely get my next cake from them - they do beautiful work! The staff is also super friendly. Definitely check it out!
2010-10-21,5,I love places that specialize in one thing.  Whether its french fries, hamburgers, wings, or in this case cupcakes, they always taste better when it's a place's specialty.  Sweet has the best cupcakes I've ever had (homemade aside of course).  They're very affordable and I love that I can buy milk in the same place.  Most people will take about the red velvet but in the fall season you have to try the pumpkin cupcakes!Small cupcakes are about $1.50 and big ones are typically $2.25 but a couple varieties will be a few cents extra.
2010-10-19,5,Found this place courtesy of Yelp and boy! am I thankful. A wonderful, unassuming place that serves some wonderful cup-cakes.Tip: Sunday 6-7 PM are happy hours. Buy one, get one free. Wooohoooo!
2010-09-28,5,I found this place courtesy of yelp. I was in the area and did a search for peanut butter because I had a craving and this was one of the places that popped up. And I am quite glad that I chose to stop by!Firstly the store is incredibly cute. It is on the corner and has a very adorable store front with big windows. The interior is quite pretty. The walls are white with black tree branches and birds on them. Very inviting.The girls who work here are very nice. Customer service is important and they do it right here. The girl who served me smiled, and kept up small talk, even asked me where I was from and recommended which cupcakes I should try! When I mentioned I was paying with a credit card she said they have a $10 minimum but that it was okay and she'd let me have it if it was less (my order came out to $12 however since I wanted to try a buncha different cupcakes!)As for the cupcakes, they all look delicious. And what's wonderful is that they offer mini-cupcakes. So if you wanna try a flavor but don't want a normal sized one you can get a mini! I got two minis, two cupcakes, and a large ice latte. The cupcakes I tried were the peanut butter, marshmellow, chocolate cocunut, and pumpkin. As I sit here writing this I have not tasted the pumpkin yet but ate the other three and omnomnom were they good!Stop by here if you can! It's worth it!
2010-08-13,4,Sweet, delicious treats at a reasonable (not designer cupcake) price.
2010-07-31,5,I have had more cupcakes in my life than the normal person should. I've had Crumbs', Carlo's, Magnolia's, and had a bite at all the little cupcake shops in the city. A few years ago this was a cafe that I went to every other day as a kid. I left Hoboken for a year or so and returned to find out the cafe had been replaced with a cupcake place. Furthermore, there was another cupcake shop on Washington: The infamous Crumbs. I was a skeptic of the place, until my friend convinced me to buy a cupcake. I bought a large red velvet and floated up to Cloud 9. It was the perfect balance of  cream cheese frosting and moist cake. It was rich and fluffy, and I couldn't help buy an entire batch to bring home and devour with a large glass of milk. The size is well-proportioned (to those who don't believe so hear this: a good cupcake doesn't have to be the size of your fist to be good) and the frosting on all these cupcakes are creamy goodness. This is definitely one of my top ten favorite cupcake shops by far.
2010-05-25,5,This place is adorable and has cool retro look.  There are a few seats and it is right next to the park.  There is a limited selection but what they make is a high quality product and hands down my favorite red velet cupcake!   There coffee is also tasty and the staff is funky and friendly.  Great addition to Hoboken :)
2010-05-03,5,Sweet is a very sweet little place.  The chocolate cup cake is so rich that it will make any ladies happy.  The oatmeal and raisin cookies are to die for.  Make sure you have a cup of milk to go with them.
2010-04-18,5,Review of the Cupcakes ONLY! This week I was inspired by a dear friend of mine from high school, who considers herself a cupcake connoisseur. She travels far and wide sampling the best of the best, and after conquering New York City, she recently laid her sights on our fair town.  For this week's review, I decided to gather a sampling from the big three cupcake bakeries, Crumbs Bake Shop, Carlo's Bakery, and Sweet, and perform my own Pastry Pepsi Challenge. I bought 4 similar cupcakes from each of the shops and brought them back to my apartment and set up a blind taste test for my roommates and myself. The results may surprise you.Sweet - I wouldn't expect many people to know about this small bakery on the corner of 4th and Garden, but they definitely have what it takes to keep up with the big boys. The shop is small and they only offer a few varieties each day. However, they also offer mini cupcakes, so you can try out a greater variety during your visit. The Vanilla with Chocolate Frosting, the Chocolate with Vanilla Frosting, the Pumpkin, and the Red Velvet Cupcake were approximately the same size as Carlo's and almost the same price at a total of $10.50. The cupcakes weren't as aesthetically appetizing as the competitors, but they were a perfect example of not judging a book by its cover. Winning 8 out of the 16 votes, Sweet came out on top with their perfectly moist morsels. Their cupcakes also struck a perfect balance of cake and icing that never left me feeling like checking my insulin. Bottom Line: In this clash of cupcakes, Sweet cooked up marvelously moist morsels that made them the top tasty treat. (How's that alliteration for you!)
2010-03-29,4,I really loved this place..i loved the fact that they had minis in each flavor... I was able to try 4 different flavors... Loved the red velvet, banana cream n coconut cupcake.. Wasn't to crazy about the peanut butter... Coffee was good too!! and the girl behind the counter was very nice and helpful..
2010-03-29,5,i love, love, LOVE sweet - hands down the best bakery in hoboken, and in my humble opinion, better than magnolia (which seems to be the unofficial gold standard) in the city. the place has a great retro vibe complete with old-fashioned cakestands and the display cases pop with gorgeous, colorful, delicious cupcakes. the owner is super friendly and accomodating, and i think the fact that there isn't a huge variety, which some view as a negative, actually makes what they do specialize in all the better.all in all, an amazing addition to hoboken!!
2010-03-24,5,Sweet!  I totally adore this place.  It's very quaint - almost like stepping back five decades, and totally worth every extra minute I have to spend on the treadmill.  The selection is somewhat limited, but these desserts are AMAZING.  I love that the cupcakes aren't huge to begin with, and they even have mini cupcakes.  The taste is totally homemade.  While I love my occasional Crumbs cupcake, the advantage Sweet has is that there is nothing commercial about it.  The cakes are moist and dense, taste great and reasonably priced.  The frosting is sweet, but not in a sickly "I'm going to barf from sugar overload as soon as I'm done" way.  All in all - perfect for a drive-by cupcake or even a cute idea for the end of a good date.
2010-03-21,5,no complaints about this place! normally, i'm a crumbs girl. but i was going to my grandpa's apartment for brunch w my sisters and cousins and dessert needed to be something... lighter. sweet offers mini cupcakes. they are delicious! and absolutely affordable. i also picked up a huge rice krispie treat to take with me. yea, we finished that too. will absolutely be coming back!
2010-03-13,5,The cupcakes at Sweet in Hoboken were by far the best I've ever had, and that includes the overhyped ones at Magnolia in Manhattan (I am not a big cake or cupcake person, so that might not be saying much.) I especially liked their nice, firm texture - many American cakes tend to be too fluffy and spongy for my (European) taste. Another bonus: They come in a miniature size which makes it humanly possible to sample more than one, and if you have someone to share them with, you can even try four of them without wreaking havoc on your waistline! They were all delightful, but my favorite was the red velvet one. Two sticky thumbs up!
2010-02-12,5,Your Red Velvet Cupcakes are to die for!! So delicious. They literally just melt in your mouth. I could eat this every day but I have to watch my figure as well. When I go back up north I am going to pick some up. Used to live in Hoboken 2 blocks away and would love grabbing a cupcake after dinner. I also remember when you first opened how adorable your place looked the way it was painted. You have a very cute place.
2010-02-10,5,Since I last wrote a review about this place, saying I didnt like cupcakes, I have to admit... I became a fan of cupcakes because of Sweet. They are absolutely delicious. Boxes of Sweet cupcakes make great gifts for visits to friends'/relatives' houses or as a treat for colleagues at work (buy them the night before!)
2010-01-19,4,I can't believe I didn't write a review for Sweet- I love it here!I came here last on a boring day off, with no one to keep my company but my music. I found it quite refreshing to walk over to a side of Hoboken that I don't normally go to, very reminiscent of LES. Sweet not only made me feel at home, but also gave me a tiny bit of NJ pride. I'm glad NJ finally has a cupcake place that is not the Satan that is Crumbs or the crappy basic cupcakes you'd find in the supermarket, or bland hometown bakery.  The cupcakes here are little morsels of love.Sweet allows you to order mini-versions of their cupcakes, which is good if you don't want to feel guilty, or if you want to feel guilty and buy ALL of the mini cupcakes, which is what I did. My favorite is the coconut. It was soft, sweet and delicious. The coconut was fresh, the cake was melty-fresh-good.  I'm very picky about my red velvet, and I didn't care for the one that was offered here. I'm not opposed to trying it again though, maybe it was an off day.I also had some unsweetened ice tea here, which got rid of my cupcake dry mouth perfectly. I will say that Sweet has the best cupcakes I've ever had in NJ, and I think I'll pay them a visit today, its about time.
2010-01-16,1,If you want dry, dense and doughy cupcakes, this is the place to get them. I'd rather bake my own, or go to Crumbs.
2009-12-08,1,Very disappointing. Didn't care for the icing, and the chocolate cupcake was really dry and unappetizing. The red velvet cupcake was a bit better, but the cake still wasn't that moist. I also thought the portions were a bit small for the price, especially since there were limited, basic flavors and the cupcakes didn't have fillings.I got the cupcakes a little before closing time, so perhaps I just got ones that weren't very fresh. But it's not like they tasted stale ... they just weren't moist. The person working there seemed nice and the store was cute. It was a pain to find parking (though that, of course, isn't the shop's fault).
2009-11-20,5,If you are looking for the perfect cupcake, this is it!I must first admit that I am not usually so crazy about cupcakes; but these are just other worldly good!  It is worth a long trip to go across the Hudson.blog.yam.com/hermeslover...
2009-11-19,5,WOW....I just stopped in there to buy some unique cupcakes for my B-day at work tomorrow. I must say I didn't ever like Cupcakes before, but I so just changed my mind about it....Move over Magnolia Bakery here comes the real SWEET treat....Yummy in my tummy....love it.
2009-10-02,4,Sweet has amazing cupcakes.  The owner/baker is always there and she's very friendly and knowledgeable. I love the pumpkin cupcakes, which they only have during the autumn and winter. Also, be sure to try the Red Velvet. Sweet is hands down the best cupcake place in Hoboken. Sorry Carlos and Crumbs.  I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the cupcakes are so damn pricey!
2009-10-01,2,eh...no. As a connoisseur of cupcakes, all I have to say of Sweet is, who do they think they are? They just opened a few months ago, and their prices are already comparable to Magnolia Bakery in the city! (I believe one of them is $0.25 over the other for the same sized cupcake, only Magnolia's are a notch better with a very subtle hint of something in each flavor). As a person with a serious addiction to sweets, I begin to feel that Hoboken may have not been a good place for me to settle. I was excited about Sweet when I saw it was about to open, as I've never been a fan of Carlos Bakery on Washington St, but come on...Manhattan prices on a far less-known name than Magnolia?
2009-09-03,5,This place is delish!! I love all their cupcakes. The small sizes are great for the figure conscious, and the regular sizes are even doable. unlike Crumbs, which is disgusting. I find that places who over do their specialties (Cold Stone, Crumbs, Ben&Jerry's) shameful, one of the main components as to why America suffers from obesity. But Sweet is a great alternative, and i actually like the fact that flavors are limited, because the true flavors can be appreciated. My favorites are Carrot, Red Velvet, Banana, and the Chocolate Gonache. And the cream cheese frosting is just enough! Wonderful place, not sure why the owner choose Hoboken over L.A, but she should seriously consider opening one on the West side!!
2009-08-10,5,This is my favorite cupcake place in the New York City area.  Absolutely adorable and they have MINIs!! :-)  I am obsessed with small sweets where you can get all the pleasure with less guilt.  This is one of the only places in Hoboken that feels as high quality as New York/brooklyn.   Love the wallpaper, love the music and the owner is so nice.  I always get the red velvet with cream cheese frosting.  Great for when you have guests over -if you want to pull out a super cute dessert after dinner.P.S. Crumbs just opened on Washington -another cupcake place, and it is terrible.  So low quality -they don't make them onsite and they don't have minis.
2009-07-31,4,MMM! delicious. im so glad Sweet also broke my cupcake shop virginity ;P it's a charming little spot on 4th & Garden which if you're lucky enough, could find a parking spot 2 blocks down. anyway, the cupcakes come in mini or regular sizes. I got the red velvet, ganache with marshmallow fluff and the black & white marble cupcakes. the first two mentioned are to die for. the cream cheese frosting is the perfect blend of cheesiness and sweetness. i regret getting the regular sizes now. UGH. and the coffee paired is amazing. creamy goodness. although they have a small selection for now, i hope to try out other flavors when i go back. but i do still want to venture to Crumbs, Magnolia, etc. cupcakes are definitely taking over! and i ain't mad at them!
2009-07-28,4,Good coffee, great cup cakes. My favorite is the Red Velvet cup cake. Much better than crumbs. CONS: Limited selection of cup cakes.
2009-07-14,4,Dude...Sweet!Ignoring the current trend, my affinity for cupcakes comes from a severely neglected sweet tooth, because I'd much rather eat something savory. But every now and then I just want a *lil* piece of cake...perhaps one small enough to fit into a cup...Magnolia (more like Gag-nolia) with their dry-as-matzo bread cupcakes, is never an option. And while I do like Crumbs, with their huge proportions and extreme toppings, they're like the Ben-N-Jerry's of the cupcake scene, which is alright if you're into fist-sized servings of ***IN YOUR FACE*** sugar. Sweet, on the other hand, is more like Haagen-Daas; while they may have fewer varieties, the subtle sophistication of the low-key flavors really shine through.No crazy concoctions or colored sprinkles here - while being simplistically picture perfect, no matter the size of the cupcake (they offer a mini - which is more like a two-bite amuse bouche, and a regular sized) Sweet somehow maintains the perfect flavor ratio; 80% is a moist and dense cake base, that's topped with 20% of a lovely swirled dollop of frosting.Though it's a lil store, they also offer coffee and other baked goods (that I have yet to try) and along with a great view of Church Square Park diagonally across the street...in the event that eating  Red Velvet cupcakes makes you nostalgic for your fleeting youth and the urge to bogart the playground swings overcomes you.I mean...I've never done that. :::looks away nervously:::.
2009-07-14,3,Very cute location.Greasy icing, leaves a film on the roof of your mouth. The chocolate flavor is flat.  Tastes like COSTCO cupcakes, nuthin' special.Poor selection.
2009-07-14,5,The best I've had.  .I normally hit the typical places in Manhattan for cupcakes, desserts, etc.   Sweet is my new favorite joint, and I would've never known about it if my friends who live in the neighborhood hadn't taken me by.  It's small, quiet and a bit out-of-the-way, all of which makes it an even better experience.  The food is clearly not mass-produced.  Literally everything we tried tasted homemade.My favorite was the vanilla cupcake, along with a cup of coffee (you have to try the coffee).
2009-07-06,5,That's great news that the prices now include tax.  I can get my red velvet fix for a little cheaper!  If Yelp had half-star reviews, I'd bump the rating up to 4.5 stars, but since they don't, I'm going to round up to 5 stars.
2009-04-23,5,As the son of transplanted southern parents I am quite familiar with red velvet cake. Though some might suggest  that it's best enjoyed in its traditional layer cake form, as a cupcake nobody does it better than Sweet  (IMHO). The cake is moist and fluffy, and the icing is rich and smooth (and light, too). Sweet's other cupcakes are good, but the red velvet is on another level.
2009-04-10,5,Forget about Magnolia's, that place is sh*t - in a bad way.  Sweet is THE SH*T - in a good way.  A very good way.Located in an unassuming street off of Washington street, it is a small, no-frills bakery with miniature bite-size cupcakes, full-size cupcakes, and other delectable desserts.  The cupcakes are moist, fresh, and flavorful - not overbearingly sweet like some places, just sweet enough to give you the full flavor of the cupcake flavors they offer.  The icing on these babies are amazing though and it truly makes these cupcakes amazing.. they need to patent that shit, seriously.  Red velvets are ridiculously good, I also love the pumpkin, carrot, and peanut butter cupcakes.  The miniatures are the perfect 2-bite size so that you can eat them without the guilt - that is unless you eat 6 of them at a time like myself.  They also serve cheesecake squares that are amazing and their creme brulee is heavenly.All items are made extremely fresh, so it really should be eaten within the day.  If you keep it for longer than 2 days in the fridge, you lose the moistness of these cupcakes.They are a bit pricey at $1.75 for a miniature and $2.50 for a regular, but these cupcakes are a special treat.  It's like saving your pennies when you were younger to buy yourself a special treat at the candy aisle in the supermarket.The ladies behind the counter are super sweet.  I really hope everyone in Hoboken supports their business, because the mom and pop shops are what keep Hoboken "cute".  Crumbs is opening on Washington street soon, but I don't support it.  It's a chain and the cupcakes won't be made fresh on the premises.  I boycott Crumbs and SUPPORT SWEET all the way!!!
2009-04-09,5,I never stroll around that area of hobo past bloomfield ave, but i'm glad that i did. I randomly walked into Sweet after dinner and was blown away.I got the red velvet cupcake and my bf got the peanut butter chocolate cupcake. They were so creamy and delish!!! It tantalized my taste buds and was creamy and rich. I've never tried Magnolias but Sweet has taken my cupcake virginity. It was fantastic!!!I highly recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a small treat. The place is cozy, clean and super cute.  i love that you can see into the kitchen and watch the baker making her masterpieces. Bon appetite!
2009-03-05,3,I have to admit... I was really excited to try out Sweet. After driving by nearly every wintery morning on my way to work, I had really built it up in my head how nice it would be to go in there and grab a cup of coffee and a " sweet" cupcake.. I agree with other reviews that it was a tad too try and cakey, the overall experience was so nice that I will definitely be going back. I tried a standard buttercream vanilla cupcake, This guinness one I am hearing about might be perfect for st patricks day, I'm hoping its on the menu. Try going on a weeknight, the place was empty and they'll  frost a cupcake fresh for you if its not too busy!  Bad location for parking, but worth a walk through the park!
2009-02-06,4,At the risk of sounding corny, Sweet is....sweet! HA! Now shaddap and read the rest of my review, which is based on multiple visits.PROS:*  With the exception of some other cakes and pastries, Sweet is really a cupcake place and that's a good thing since one can concentrate and perfect the craft of...umm....cupcakery. Yeah.*  The cupcakes are quite delicious, but not overbearingly sweet the way Magnolia cupcakes have recently become. Cheaper too! Obvious favorite is the Red Velvet. The bannana one isn't bad either.*  Coffee is good which is an essential companion to cupcakes (although my personal preference would've been just a lill bit stronger). *  Place is smallish, but clean w/ample window views if you care to eat in.*  Service is attentive. They do their best to move the long lines during the weekend rushes.CONS:*  Needs more variety of cupcakes.*  Afflicted w/the Hoboken curse of scarce street parking.In short, a tastier and cheaper (not to mention closer if you're from Joisey) alternative to the famous Magnolia cupcakes in NYC.
2009-01-25,4,This is a good dessert shop with surprisingly good coffee. They pretty much just serve cupcakes and sometimes other cake. It's perfect for getting a large dessert order for a gathering. I've stopped in just for coffee more than the cupcakes. Service is excellent with friendly clerks and the owner is usually hanging out in the back, too. However, if you're into coffee there's a large coffee roaster on the other block that gives you more selection. Sweet's value is that they only have good coffee-- no choices!They have now started experimenting with breakfast items as well, and I expect they may start offering some more eats as well.- 1 star because they've replaced much of the furniture with unaesthetic small tables. It's not really a place to sit and do work at any more!
2008-12-12,4,The ladies here at Sweet were .... well, SWEET!  :)  I ordered a cuppie, which was a little too dry/cakey for me - not like that would stop me from ea .... WTF - oh good gawd Nicole .... I dropped it on the ground!  Good job!  Well, as it turns out, yes, in fact, it WAS a good job.  The super "sweet" girl behind the counter heard that I was a cupcake snob and also felt bad for me dropping 3/4 of my cuppie on the floor and offers us up to try one of their new creations.  Sweet sweet:  "It's not on our menu, yet, but we were trying a Guinness Cupcake."Me:  "Really?  Sounds quite odd, but absolutely, let us try it!"Okay YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!  My message to the sweets at Sweet, definitely put the Guinness Cupcake ON the menu!  And my message to any of you Hobo Yelpers, order one (or 2, 3, 4) up!  Moist, slightly spicy and truly unique.  Yummmm.  Yummmm.  A cupcake with a beer buzz .... Perfection!  ;)
