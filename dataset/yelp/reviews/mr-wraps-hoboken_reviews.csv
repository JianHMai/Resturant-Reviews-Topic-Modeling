2021-11-15,4,This week I decided to try Mr. Wraps. Rather than your regular crispy chicken sandwich I decided to try their "#14. Buffalo Chicken Wrap (Kate's Fav From TikTok - who?): Chicken tenders tossed in our homemade Buffalo sauce with lettuce, tomato and ranch dressing."Cost: $13.95 plus tax on Seamless, but this may cost $9.95 in the store.Pros: When I opened up my bag, I was impressed at the size of the wrap, it's like a burrito. Generous amounts of fried chicken tenders tucked in the wrap . One person wrote that they put on too much lettuce. I did not find that to be an issue, lettuce, tomato, chicken and sauce amounts were perfect. One of the better wraps I have had in Hoboken. Totally worth it. Buffalo sauce wasn't "too" spicy, it has the right amount of spice and even, dare I say, sweetness - kind of like me!Cons: One major con, no fries! It was a good wrap. I'd order it again. Like Dave Portnoy scores his pizza, this falls into the category of "football pizza". It's the kind of wrap, i'd want to order for a NFL game. Nice, solid wrap, but unlike my love of Zack's or Del Frisco's chicken sandwiches, I won't go knocking on your door to tell you how amazing this sandwich was. It's good. Once or maybe twice a month worth ordering it. If this wrap was at a bar, I would suggest ordering it off the menu every time.Overall score: 7.7 / 10.
2021-09-26,4,I love this place. Always will go with my go to the Buffalo chicken wrap pressed! You get so much chicken in the wrap it's so filling and great every time. We love coming to Hoboken and stopping in here for a wrap. Haven't found a Buffalo chicken wrap that compares!!
2021-09-26,4,One of the best wrap places in Hoboken. Buffalo chicken wrap is a go to dish for me. Price wise it's a little on the expensive side but they pack the wrap with chicken. Definitely recommend.
2021-09-24,1,I got their veggie wrap for dinner and it was basically a massive block of hummus, 3 tomato slices and a few pieces of romaine lettuce practically inedible. Somebody I was with ordered the Gyro wrap and it was also not very good. Not high quality food- will not be returning :(
2021-08-09,5,Definitely a big fan of their wraps! My usual go-to is the spicy shrimp wrap, but I've tried their Buffalo chicken wrap and they're both delicious. Their wraps are pretty big portions and I usually struggle to finish them in one sitting. I like having the wraps pressed and highly recommend when ordering a wrap.
2021-07-07,5,Buffalo and bbq chicken wraps were legit. Highly suggest!  skip the fork, eat with your hands.
2021-07-01,1,Ordered roast beef and they gave me corn beef and guy tried to argue with me that it was roast beef , completely diff texture and taste wouldn't make me another one. Heavy guy with glasses is very rude
2021-06-24,4,Ordered a few different wraps and liked some more than others. The portions of all were very generous and everyone was full afterwards. 1 was chicken Caesar which was nothing special, and honestly the chicken was a little dry (but there was a lot of it!). 1 was the south western chicken - again, chicken was a little dry but overall was good. LOVED the Caribbean pork wrap. Would get it again when we go back.
2021-06-22,1,Isn't this place suppose to be a Hoboken staple? Well, where do I begin? The two guys behind the counter were insanely rude. One of them could not get off their phone while the other after asking for a couple napkins gave me a nasty attitude. At this point we should have walked out, but because of the hype behind the establishment we decided to give the food a go. What a mistake that was. Not going to get into the individual wraps because this place does not deserve anymore of my time. I never am the type to write reviews but this place was just god awful. Do not go here.
2021-05-25,4,This place has been here forever and every once in a while I crave it.  I was in the mood for a buffalo chicken wrap and so what better than to order from Mr. Wraps.  It had a muted buffalo chicken flavor but still hit the spot. It was toned down but still good.  I like to order it minus the lettuce since it gets soggy and I am not a fan of that texture.  My wife ordered the bbq chicken wrap and it was a massive portion so be ready to eat! The chicken, however, in the bbq chicken wrap was dry. The rice was overcooked and kind of mushy. This is hangover food so don't expect 5 star dining.  Nevertheless it has been here forever so it is doing something right.  Check it out!
2020-07-20,5,Great value, great quality. Wraps are the size of burritos! Any wrap on a plate for only $1 extra and they fill it up! Probably the best honey mustard I've ever tasted .. Kens has NOTHING on Mr. Wraps honey mustard. Family owned business and they are quick and efficient. Breakfast, lunch, dinner - you can't go wrong here. I'd give more stars if it was an option. NOONE CAN COMPETE!
2020-05-18,4,The wrap tasted more like a burrito but it wasn't bad, the fries were really good and the iced coffee was good too.
2020-02-29,1,Don't go here. Tried to walk in and place an ordering holding my 10 pound dog and was rudely told to leave by one of the employees. There weren't any no dogs allowed signs anywhere either. Don't waste your time on this place, it looked dirty anyway.
2020-02-21,1,I've gone to this place and keep trying to give it another try but it just isn't good. I've tried their sandwiches and items off the grill and I am just disappointed by the quality and taste every time. Not going to make the mistake of trying it again. Learned my lesson...
2019-12-31,5,Ok all- I'm not sure why it's taken me so long to visit but this place but they seriously make amazing TUNA salad. I've had it on a salad (which was huge) and on a roll- it's seriously just amazing! It's creamy and tangy - always consistent and just delicious. I like how close they are to my apartment- the quality of the food and the staff is always friendly! I'll absolutely be back soon! I also liked that I could order ahead for pick-up on YELP. 5/5 for sure!!!!
2019-11-10,5,Every time I order from here the food is delicious and it comes super quickly. The whole menu is sooo good and I love ordering from this place. Thanks and keep up the good work!
2019-09-13,5,We love Mr. Wraps there are so many things to choose from on the menu. The only downsides is that its located on a residential block and theres no parking.
2019-08-25,3,Mr. Wraps is hit or miss depending on what you get. Personally I most enjoy the BBQ Chicken Wrap (w/ lettuce and bacon) and the Buff Chick Wrap (add blue cheese crumble). On the plus side, the portion is fairly generous and the flavors are good (LOVE their buffalo sauce). But they're often messy and subsequently difficult to eat.VERY IMPORTANT: Ask for your wrap to be pressed and cut in half. Not sure how a wraps place doesn't automatically cut their wraps in half. Pressing the Wrap isn't a must but is recommended if you like some extra crunch.
2019-07-03,2,For a place that specializes in wraps, this one should wrap it up. Chicken salad was equivalent to eating cheap supermarket iceberg lettuce mix, topped with cold cardboard chicken. Chicken avacado bean wrap was just as bad. Hoboken eateries have been thoroughly disappointing...
2019-06-28,2,I got the turkey, stuffing, and cranberry wrap. Overall, wrap was mediocre. Fell apart, they put all the cranberry on the bottom so the wrap wasn't evenly dispersed. Also what upsets me is the price, $9 JUST for the wrap. $4.50 for fries. This place is highway robbery. I won't be coming back any time soon.
2019-06-26,1,Worst wraps ever! Completely tasteless! Also I ordered the salsa wraps but got wheat wraps in my order. Never getting food from here again. I got an omelette wrap still in my fridge which I plan to throw away just in case somebody wants it
2019-06-12,1,Honestly. I hate leaving bad reviews but this was pretty gross. I got my delivery late, and the wrap was completely soaked in oil. I wiped it down with about 10 tissues before trying to eat it without oil dripping down my arms. This is a tuna melt, I don't think there's supposed to be a pool of oil cooked into it? The oil soaked through the bag and all over my table. I literally had to throw the wrapper out because it was dripping in the oil. I took maybe 3 bites of it before tossing it because all I'm eating is, you guessed it, oil. It's disgusting. I'm shocked they would send something out like this. Nope, not ordering from here again sorry. So nasty. Just no.
2019-06-09,5,Always a great place to go for a hearty lunch or dinner.  Most of the stuff here is really good.  I love the Omelet Wrap and the Buffalo Chicken Wrap.  The sweet potato fries are also amazing!  I can't wait to try some more items on the menu especially since I live around the corner.  Delivery is always super fast and you get a lot for your money which is great because other restaurants in Hoboken tend to charge a lot for menu items and skimp on the portion or vice versa.  Don't just take my word for it...go in and try it!
2019-04-13,5,The Best Cuban Sandwich in Hoboken!!!
2019-03-11,5,Holy moly, this place is the bomb. I had the chicken fajita wrap, asked for them to go light on the cheese and put the sour cream on the side. The wrap was huge, a real belly buster size. The tortilla was fluffy and chewy, everything inside was delish. I'm thinking about ordering it again for the second time today. This place is a new favorite spot for sure
2019-01-01,5,Favorite place in Hoboken. Barbecue bacon cheeseburger has a great food vs. price ratio since it comes with fries. Very filling and I love every bite.
2018-11-27,5,Can't believe I lived here for so long without knowing about Mr Wraps. They're super reasonably priced and they deliver. What is better than that? Good spot to order from when you and your spouse can't decide on what to get because the menu is THAT huge. Really great wraps and sandwiches. And they're BIG! Good bang for your buck.
2018-11-11,5,FAVORITE delivery option in Hoboken. Their buffalo chicken wrap is the best I've ever had. Spicy shrimp is great too. The wraps are pretty huge for a good price and delivery is quick. I think they have ice cream too?! Seriously this place is a hidden gem and I would eat it every day if I could.
2018-11-09,5,That grilled steak  wrap is absolutely amazing !!!! Im so happy with The quality  Of The Food And how fast The delivery was .
2018-11-08,4,I like this spot. I stick w the BBQ chicken wrap which is really good. Prices are good, delivery fast, place is clean, simple and great to have near by for a quick tasty bite. I'm sorry to see the dude behind the counter gets a bad 'wrap' he's actually a really nice guy if you talk to him a bit.
2018-10-05,5,I was dazzled with their endless menu when I entered the place. They've so many options and I literally couldn't decide so I saw a review recommending California burger and I thought I'd give it a try. It was really good and it comes with fries on the side. The portion was huge for me though. Anyway, I suggest you to order before you come here as it took them a while in preparing my order.
2018-08-06,5,My bf and I order from Mr. Wraps at least once a week. Delivery is quick. Food is delicious. Chicken fajita wrap and bbq chicken wrap are our favorite. Their buffalo chicken tenders and their salads are really good too and a large portion.
2018-07-31,3,I came here expecting to taste really good wraps but to my surprise nothing was too amusing. I got the buffalo chicken wrap and it was honestly just drenched in buffalo sauce nothing too special. I tasted the other route that my partner had and honestly I didn't go crazy for that one either. If you need a quick on the go by that will fill you up then consider this but not my favorite wraps. Well they go bad I really don't think so. Not really impressed , I've tasted better.
2018-07-11,3,The menu is nice and thick with sandwiches, burgers, ice cream station and their speciality - wraps. I decided to go against the grain and had a BBQ bacon burger. i kinda was expecting a puny burger but when it came out it looked amazing. Huge burger patty had to be 10oz+, ton of bacon and here is the kicker its on a kaiser roll rather than a bun (genius). I didnt like the fries too much. The texture wasn't crispy enough kind of soggy tbh.i also like that has the family deli restaurant feel. I feel be back to have their wrap and ice cream.
2018-05-21,3,I've heard good things about this place but to my surprise, its really not that good. It's over priced and I ordered a very bland, flavorless chicken Caesar wrap with fries that were very soggy. Willing to give this place another try so hopefully the next thing I try won't lack flavor
2018-05-16,5,love the barbecue chicken wrap and the french fries here are cooked just right !
2018-05-16,5,If you don't love Mr. Wraps - you have a giant dump in your pants.  All of the starters, tortilla pizzas and the BBQ chicken wrap are DELICIOUS.  They are always quick with delivery (in hoboken at least),  every order has been correct, the food always arrives hot and the fries are always crispy.
2018-01-28,1,We used to order from here all the time however lately it seems employees make up their own prices. Ordered 2 wraps at $7.50 and fries at $4.50 delivery driver shows up and says $30!! Obviously made an attempt to rip me off! Watch what they charge you especially for delivery
2018-01-24,3,A pretty good place for wraps.  Huge selection!  I like the roasted turkey wrap, comes with stuffing, gravy and cranberry.  Very good but can be a little light on the stuffing.  Not much seating but a good to go place.   Inexpensive for the size wrap you get.
2018-01-12,5,Best place to grab a fresh wrap. I come here all the time and my all time favorite wrap is the #2 South Western Chicken Wrap with a side of chipotle mayo. Don't forget the chipotle mayo! Everything is always so fresh and the wrap is big. I always just manage to eat half but save the rest for later. Definitely recommend it
2017-08-31,4,Fast enough. The wrap is not bad but it's not that cheap. Do you want a quick meal, go there. I liked that hey have real chicken, the taste was good.
2017-08-18,5,Eat here at least two nights a week.  The wraps and salads are delicious and the staff is very friendly.  My favorite wrap is the southwest chicken wrap!
2017-07-25,5,I seldom write reviews but I would like to do it for this wrap. I ordered a Thai Steak it's full of steak and thai rice as well as vegetables. No oily a perfect wrap after working out. Price is good and restaurant is clean and tidy. They make good wraps
2017-07-19,5,Place is excellent! Very good food and customer service. Delivery is also very respectable for a delivery driven city. You can always expect a hot burger or jalapeño poppers.
2017-06-27,5,This place is the bombdiggity. Great portions, good prices, great burgers, and a lot of variety to the menu. If you're a college student on a budget this place is a gamechanger.
2017-04-19,4,The sandwiches and wraps are good and stuffed. Definitely no need for double meat in any of these subs... all meet is domestic, no imported meats. If you're looking for good quality cold cuts this is not the place. Place is great for big sandwiches at a great price... I would give five stars but I get creeped out by the adult employees always watching mighty morphin power rangers. Would bee nice to see the news or sports... what are middle aged adults doing watching kid shows... very weird, almost inappropriate.
2017-03-26,5,Lots to choose from here and everything is fresh, tasty and quick. Their sandwiches are delish, portions are large and the fries are crispy. And I swear by their chicken soup, it fixes me up when I'm not feeling well -- and they make it every day. They're open pretty late, and in addition to the food they have scooped ice cream, a bunch of different flavors. The guys who run the place are very nice, too.
2017-03-07,5,Been eating here for the last 8 years. They have great wraps, and I am personally a huge fan of their BBQ bacon cheese burger and their chicken finger platters. They also deliver.
2017-02-02,2,Sooo...i was so excited for lunch today, until i took a bite of my wrap. $8.50 and my wrap is sitting on the kitchen counter debating if i should throw it out or save it for my fiance. I ordered a Caribbean pork wrap which is suppose to have: roasted pork ( Chewy and some parts were hard, had to spit out), stuffing (didn't taste like stuffing at all, just little cubed breads with no flavor), apples (sliced paper thin, couldn't even taste it) but the chipotle sauce was good. .....just sucks i wasted money and my lunch time.
2016-12-07,4,Used to order from here all the time when I worked at the local hospital. My go-to was the #1 BBQ Chicken wrap, it was a monster loaded with chicken, rice, Monterrey jack cheese and sour cream. Be prepared to feel very sleepy after eating one, I've also have their pork BBQ sliders which were solid and the waffle fries are crispy deliciousness! The owner and staff are really friendly and hardcore Giants fans, really miss coming by, maybe I'm do for a trip!
2016-10-29,5,Best hangover cure ever! Waffle fries and a burrito and back to life! Thanks for my bomb ass food!
2016-10-08,3,The corned beef sandwich is legit as is the bbq chicken.  But honestly the best thing there is the disco fries with extra gravy and mozzarella.  #insane
2016-07-21,5,A diamond in the rough. I wanted something healthy and different. I found this cute spot through yelp. When I went inside it had so many selections from salads to burgers to subs and they all looked yummy. I got the gyro wrap and my boyfriend got the taco wrap and they were delish!!!! A must for the next time we are in hoboken.
2016-06-27,2,I decided to give mr wraps another go and safe to say it'll be my last time. Idk, to specialize in one thing and for them to be mediocre is really a bummer.This place always seems to over do it and lacks flavor altogether, big no no.I got the grilled steak wrap with onions, peppers and cheese. There was a fair amount of veggies, but there was so much friggin meat and NO cheese in the wrap it totally killed the dish for me. The steak juicy but lacked flavor and was just overkill. The wrap needed way more cheese and rice or something.The selection of wraps may be a case of quantity over quality. i've tried two completely different things and both weren't that good.It just sucked, like it was underwhelming the first time I tried these guys. They need to change their name or get some inspiration.
2016-06-06,5,The delivery guy came to my door and I had enough for the meal, but maybe $1 and change for tip that I brought to the door with me. Just needed to run upstairs to grab more money for him and he was VERY persistent to tell me "DONT WORRY ABOUT IT, JUST GET ME NEXT TIME!" Great guy and great food. Also, I think this guy's name was "D" in case anyone from Mr Wraps management sees this. Thank you again for sending awesome delivery guys.
2016-02-14,2,I have been here multiple times and every time I get the feeling that anyone who works there, legit hates their life. The service is not friendly and never smiles. The food is okay, nothing special. Anything you order takes 15-20 mins minimum and while you sit there you feel uncomfortable because the people working there actually have to do their jobs...as if you are inconveniencing them
2016-01-09,5,This spot is tied with another as my favorite non restaurant place to eat in Hoboken. Conveniently around the corner from my apartment, we got wraps here when we were first moving in and I immediately took notice to how heavy the bag was with only two wraps. The wraps are as tremendous as they are delicious. With combinations you don't see everywhere, such as pulled pork and mashed potatoes, or BBQ chicken, rice and sour cream, you are guaranteed to find something amazing. Their California turkey burger platter is pretty amazing too. All this for prices that are relatively cheap, compared to other places in the Bokes. Definitely worth checking out!
2016-01-02,2,Ever walk into a restaurant and feel like everyone working there hates their lives? No? Then head to Mr. Wraps. If you ask them to spilt the bill, give you a condiment, anything is met with a glare and sometimes even a sigh because life is just that hard sometimes.The chicken caesar wrap left a lot to be desired. The chicken was either overcooked or really old because it was super dry. We also ordered the southwest wrap and the grilled steak wrap. They did make a delicious chocolate milkshake, but that's hard to mess up.
2015-10-14,1,Just do yourself a solid and walk away. I've ordered almost everything on the menu here... I wanted to give this place a shot. They deserve one if I'm working in town and need a good lunch spot. Ugh. Everything is inedible. The chicken tasted like cardboard. Can you say dry? Any wraps that include rice are completely overstuffed with rice. Just rice. Nothing else. Bleh.I hate soggy wraps, and coming from a place with the name WRAPS in the title, I'm dumbfounded as to how every single wrap I've ordered is soaking wet and crappy. Will never go back to this place.
2015-10-07,3,The food is 5 stars, the staff is 1 star (hence 3 stars). The wraps are great and the price is reasonable. They also have good chicken quesadilas. The staff is so rude, so much so that I have thought about giving this place up. It's just so close and convenient.
2015-09-03,1,If you are thinking of getting anything to eat from here, just do yourself a favor and walk away and don't give this place your business. After putting in your order for a cold wrap or sandwich you will be waiting an upwards of 15-20 minutes. FOR A COLD SANDWICH OR WRAP THAT IS RIDICULOUS. The staff are more infatuated with there phones than anything else. Also, the constant answer of Huh? When you politely ask for something shows the quality of the staff after they have briefly put down their cell phone to talk to you.Also, they play the worst music. I waited for a sandwich for 20 minutes all while listening to Justin Timberlakes greatest hits. Give me a break man. After taking two bites of a mostly lettuce filled wrap, I ended up throwing it in the trash. Waste of time with a horrible environment and horrible tasting food. Do yourself a favor, go to a reputable Deli in Hoboken, there are pleny of them.DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF COMING TO MR. WRAPS. STAY AWAY!!!
2015-08-05,4,Let me start off by saying this isn't five star dinning. That being said they are really good in the wrap department and salads. Come with an appetite cause these bad boys weigh a ton ( salad and wraps).  Solid option for a last minute dinner.
2015-08-05,4,The food was amazing! I had the chicken club wrap. It's huge, you'll definitely have left overs
2015-06-08,1,DO NOT ORDER FOR DELIVERY!!!!Unless, you want a buffalo chicken wrap with soggy soggy shredded lettuce and mushy tomatoes that drips all over you while you try to eat it. All we wanted was a really good wraps and a salad. Mr. Wraps. Every single thing we ordered was warm and was soggy and warm including the "fresh house salad". Clearly is was put under all of the hot food we ordered for at least an hour. I asked specifically for no onions on the salad and not only was covered in an entire chopped onion, they were warm and wilted all the lettuce. Maybe they misheard me and thought I said to put all the onions they had left in the kitchen. My husband literally thought I must have ordered an onion salad with a touch of lettuce. I should have known from the phone call with the unfriendly woman that they would disregard every request I made, not one of the things I asked for on the side actually came on the side. It was incredibly slow delivery and I highly suggest ordering from anywhere else but here. We were starving when we ordered and the food was barely edible and was so gross we completely lost our appetite. The only good thing about Mr. Wraps are the prices, at least in the end we didn't waste a ton of money.  We order pretty much every night and I love wraps, this was by far the worst buffalo chicken wrap I have ever had. I don't even write reviews, but it was so bad I felt I had to let people know what they are in for.
2015-05-30,5,Love Mr. Wraps, always good, fresh food and large portions!! Never disappoints!! Taco salad and taco wrap is great! Tried their south western burger today with a side of cheese fries, omg couldn't even finish eating it all, saved it for later! And the prices aren't bad at all!! Must give a try!!
2015-04-18,1,After reading the recent sandwich article in the NY Times, I went in search of a NJ Sloppy Joe.  Mr. Wraps was supposed to have something like that, so my husband and I walked over there on this beautiful afternoon.  We got a menu and asked about the sandwich.  The person was not only unhelpful, he seemed bored and unfriendly.  I was really taken aback by this chilly reception.  We left and I threw the menu in the trash.  I'll find my NJ Sloppy Joe someplace else.
2015-04-09,2,I get so mad at myself every time I come here but it's just so convenient to where I live that I continually give them chances. They are slow as molasses and not very friendly. You would also expect to get a little side of salad or something with your wrap but it doesn't happen. Avoid unless truly desperate.
2015-03-27,4,Mr. Wraps is legit. There's so many different options on the menu, anyone can find something they like. They offer way more than just wraps too... burgers, salads, soups, specialty sandwiches, french fries, chicken tenders, jalapeno poppers and so on. I've only tried the wraps so my 4 star rating is based on that.If you come here to try one of their many options for wraps, I highly recommend the roast BBQ pork with potatoes, sautéed onions and jack BBQ sauce. This wrap is AMAZING. Its my go to order. I also got the roast turkey with stuffing, cranberry sauce and brown gravy last night in addition. This one was yummy as well but doesn't compare to the roast BBQ pork wrap. Mr. Wraps also serves ice cream, which is pretty cool. I was looking around last night and it seems like they have a nice selection and also really cool cone options. I especially like this place because they are environment friendly and recycle. Good job Mr. Wraps, I respect any establishment that cares about the environment. The wait time for 2 wraps last night was a bit lengthy but worth it since the food is scrumptious.
2015-03-26,5,One of my favorite places to order delivery from! They are always fast,efficient with the order--even when I am being a bit picky and ask for some stuff of of it :)  tThey are always friendly on the phone too, and have no problem taking a credit card over the phone and SUPER quick delivery (the delivery staff is friendly as well).The prices are also a dream and it is great quality as well. I love the buffalo chicken 'pita pizza'. It is a perfect size to share, and it is super thin because it is on a huge pita. Their turkey clubs, BLT's, breakfast options, and the salads are a true favorites of mine. The cobb salad is reasonably healthy despite the large pieces of bacon and cheese. But the salads are HUGE. It usually lasts me for at least 2-3 meals. Whenever I am in doubt of what to eat, I know I can always find something on their menu!
2015-02-21,5,I love this place. Some of the wrap combos sound a little crazy, but they end up delicious. It's amazing other places haven't caught on to the burrito sized wrap idea.
2015-02-12,4,I had 2 different wraps number 10 & 20 and they both were good. I recommend this place if you're in Hoboken
2015-01-01,5,GREAT WRAPS. Great service fast delivery I recommend!!! Especially cyo is awesome. Great business, have great ingredients to add love it!
2014-12-12,5,Great wraps and so many selections to choose from! I had the buffalo chicken wrap and it was amazing! Highly recommended, great location and very vibrant decor too
2014-12-11,5,I love this place.  They have every type of wrap, salad, and breakfast that you can ask for.  I always try to stop in here before my volunteer shift at the nearby ER.  The prices are good and the sizes are great.  I've never had anything but friendly interactions with the staff.  For me, this is my Go-To Sandwhich shop in Hoboken!
2014-10-28,3,The food is great. The only thing is the young girl that they put on the register sometimes gets an attitude when you order for delivery.
2014-09-07,4,Fresh ingredients, well made wraps and sandwiches. I think it's a family run business who are all very friendly.
2014-04-22,4,So I've been here a few times and have usually ordered the special they have from 10-3. It's a cheese burger with fries, chicken tenders with fries or a chicken tender sandwich for about $5 which isn't bad considering you can pay about $8 on Washington. They have tons of options on their menus but of course, it's a ton of different wraps. I'm sure they'll have one that will suit your taste buds and fill you up. They have breakfast, soups/salads, subs/hoagies/heros (depending where you're from) to choose from. I tend to call ahead if I know what I'm wanting and pick it up in about 15 minutes cause it's usually after physical therapy and it's bagged and ready to take a drive around town to be eaten but if you don't, you're gonna be in there for 10 minutes just looking at their menu boards figuring what you'd want to devour or try.
2014-04-02,4,I love mr wraps but delivery takes foreverrrrrrTry the southwest burger it's heaven.
2014-03-15,4,I eat at Mr Wraps frequently. I do not need to write a story here but the Spicy Shrip Wrap (even on wheat) is a solid one...
2014-01-05,5,I've been ordering from here for over a year and I think once in 50 orders someone forgot some honey mustard sauce.  The place is really awesome, prices are good, tastes great.  Some of the reviews out here are not precise.  Some people complain it takes awhile to get food.  Wraps is one of the busiest and most popular places in town, so they're constantly busy.  If you want your food right away try a hot dog stand or an establishment that is not popular.  The delivery guys go out with 5 orders at a time.  A helpful hint is to order before the rush or after the rush, order early for football games and forget about Leprecon, line goes around the corner.  I'm a wraps lover for life.
2013-12-23,1,I usually don't write bad reviews but my office ordered from you guys today and half of us are feeling horrible now.  I'm not saying it's a public health issue but the bulk order was nothing short of nasty across the board.  Raise the bar up a little, guys.  Prices are very reasonable but.....
2013-10-03,4,I come here for lunch semi-regularly and it is always good quality food at a reasonable price. Almost always too long a wait for the wrap.A tip - order your wrap pressed. They are MUCH nicer after going through the toaster press.The Caribbean Pork is absolutely delicious - especially when they put extra apple in.
2013-09-11,2,Don't get me wrong, this place has fresh, healthy and good wraps.However, when you are in the food service business, service is key. I think they totally miss that point. 25mn to get a sandwich, this lady did not give a damn when I went to see her asking where was my meal (just laughing with her friend and playing on her phone..) so, yes it is good, but I won't go back there just because I don't want to give my money to rude poeple.
2013-09-05,3,One way or another I have found myself ending up here on a number of occasions.  And I think that pretty much sums up why it's an overall good place for a solid quick meal.  Conveniently located pretty much directly in the center of Hoboken, however, still two blocks off Washington so away from the hustle.  Can sit outside which is nice.The food is, "good".  Some things I've had have been great, other have been decent, but overall, they have an enormous selection and you will definitely find something appealing.  Nice place to stop if you're looking for something really casual.  When all else fails and I can't decide where I want to go or what I want, I know Mr. W has got me covered.
2013-08-18,5,This place has the most amazing food ever.The two usual people that work behind the counter (you know who they are) look so miserable as if they hate their life and want nothing more than to jump off of a building.If you can get past their lifeless expressions and lack of manners, the food is absolutely amazing.
2013-08-12,5,I love this place! they fill up their wraps where every time i have ordered I more than was full.  my favorites: gyro wrap, and buffalo chicken with avacado. only gripe: fries are not crispy, but honestly i was so fully i barely ate the frieswill definitely come again :)
2013-06-05,4,It would take nearly 3 months to go through the entire menu here, but it would be about the tastiest 3 months of your life.I like the food, I like the business, I like the guys who run it. They're real entrepreneurs and I only wish them more success.
2013-06-03,4,First off the waffle fries here are the best!! They come with mozzarella cheese and gravy if you wish, I always nix the gravy. There are so many options for the wraps that you'll def find one that you'll like. They also have salad and burger choices. I always alternate which wraps I order and I totally recommend the steak salad.
2013-05-27,3,I stopped in before I hit a movie to order a chicken caesar wrap with a friend. We decided to share it being we weren't to hungry. Well after close to a 20 minutes later our wrap arrived. We were confused by the delay being we were the only people in the shop. Did they pluck the chicken first? Anyways it was quite good and I would go back, just being aware that extra time is needed to dilly dally and make the wrap.
2013-05-14,4,LOVE this food here. The wraps are always filled and delicious salads are big, and the prices are reasonable! This place has the BEST buffalo chicken wrap I have ever had! And the mozzarella are always crispy, never soggy, and come 7 to an order! I have only order delivery from here and it is always super fast, but the man on the phone is miserable and sometimes rude.
2013-04-02,3,I've picked up and ordered food from here multiple times. Their breakfast wraps are good, but they usually don't put enough ketchup so ask for extra!  Their grilled steak wrap, taco wrap, and BLT wrap are also good. Their prices are also reasonable. I'd stay away from their milkshakes though, very watery and expensive ($5 for a medium!). I usually order from Mr Wraps when I'm being lazy as Hoboken has a lot better offerings for cheap take-out.
2013-01-25,5,Hands down my favorite take out place in Hoboken. GREAT food, everything is freshly made, and great quality. Portions are very large and food is great! Their buffalo chicken wrap is the best that I have ever had. If you want to eat in they have a small seating area that seats 6 to 10 people. I have also done catering with them. They are really a great all around place.
2013-01-11,4,i love mr. wraps.  there is something for every one of my food moods- starving to death, hungover, health kick, spice cravings, cheesy mccheese cravings, warm hearty cravings for cold days, the list goes on.i order lunch from here regularly and they have never screwed up my order (even when i ask for less of one thing, extra of another, or make substitutions. i never feel jipped and i always am satisfied.  EXCELLENT VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY!my all-time favorite is the southwestern chicken, but honestly every wrap i've had is delicious.  they even have an extensive breakfast menu, salads, burgers, pizza, you name it! they make everything.
2013-01-05,5,Best Cobb Salad in town , hands down!
2013-01-02,2,Upon further review, they fall somewhere between average and inconsistently average.  If a salad has 5 ingredients and you forget one, it's not the same salad.  Hoboken really needs another sandwich/salad delivery place that's open after business hours.
2012-12-15,3,Long wait for the food but my chicken caeser wrap was delicious. However, "Mister's" steak wrap had too much steak sauce in it. The taste was overpowering. Prices are also reasonable. Will come back again!
2012-10-28,4,I take this route to go home from the Planet Fitness and I so happened to peak in and caught the corn beef special in the corner of my eye.  It instantly hit the spot after a 2 hour session at the gym.  I am a corn beef fiend growing up with Bragmans, Town Hall Deli and Millburn Deli and this is an acceptable substitute.  They have half a dozen menu boards so there is a ton to choose from.  They are a little pokey making the sandwiches.  Best of all it is an affordable lunch!  Like what prices for sandwiches used to be.Will be back.
2012-10-15,2,Pros: Big portions for cheap, and they deliver quickly. Huge menu with something for everyone.Cons: Food is ok, but not great quality. Also, can be hit or miss with whether they wrap it up correctly or just slop it together.
2012-09-05,4,I pass Mr. Wraps frequently, being that it is a mere five minute walk from my apartment, but today I finally decided to stop in for lunch. I immediately liked the setup of this predominately takeout lunch spot. The menu was neatly displayed in fun, but legible writing on giant boards above the cash register. Though there were many options written down, I found the boards eased my decision-making process (which is usually slow, and painful for cashiers whom I inflict it upon).I ordered #2 - the South West Wrap. It came with chicken, salsa, beans, avocados, and cheese inside. I was very happy with my choice, and surprised they didn't skimp on the avocado. The only thing that could have been improved was the chicken- it was a little dry. Other than that the wrap was very good and the portion size was large; which was kind of nice because I could only eat half and saved the rest for dinner. Mr. Wraps offers a good deal, and a lot of food at a reasonable price. I would definitely recommend it for a fast lunch or dinner.
2012-06-26,2,Mr. Wraps is okay.  We like the ice cream there, but every time we've ever ordered the wraps, we're less than thrilled.  It's convenient, and generally pretty quick, but not my first choice for sandwiches/wraps.
2012-04-17,2,Pro's: My Meatless wrap was HUGE and tasted delicious. Con's:*Staff was arrogant, rude, apathetic, young students who don't give a SHIT when you walk in (the two that were at the counter were popping bubble wrap even as I was trying to order and they rolled their eyes and continued popping the oh-so-fun bubble wrap instead of paying attention to me)*Expensive: I ordered one meatless wrap and an orange juice and it came to $9.50. I found that to be expensive for a wrap joint. * Dirty: Bathroom is DISGUSTING. In fact, the whole place is rather filthy. Fortunately for me, I could not see the kitchen where my wrap was being built. Guessing it is also filthy. *Takes AGES.. I waited 20 minutes for a meatless, cold wrap. Wtf? *Music was LOUD and it was crappy Euro-trash disco/techno. Could not hear my friend on the phone because shitty music was so loud.
2012-03-20,3,great menu but decent food. if you are planning to order when you get there be prepared to wait FOREVER. Food takes way to long to come.
2012-03-05,3,Mr. Wraps and quick and easy. Prices are in the $5-$7 range for a variety of offering. They serve everything from burgers, to sandwiches, to obviously wraps. They'll even let you get your packages delivered when you're not home.
2012-03-01,5,i love mr. wraps.  i always order their creamy and huge mac and cheese starter.  it lasts for days and its so good.  i also love their chicken tenders and fries dish.  this is not a 5 star  but if you like great food with inexpensive prices then Mr. Wraps is the place for you.
2012-02-26,3,i literally have gotten the same thing here every time (the roasted veggies wrap with grilled shrimp added in), so i'm not well versed in all mr wraps has to offer....but from what i have had, it's pretty good. it's nothing that's going to blow you away, it IS a wrap, but i think it's good for a quick weeknight dinner. they have alot to choose from and you can also create your own from all their ingredients, so you are never short on options.
2012-02-26,4,I'm not sure exactly what to say about this place. I've given it a four for a couple of reasons, and not a five for 1 very specific reason. Pros: The atmosphere is GREAT! Very colorful and fun. Menu is EXPANSIVE but no overwhelming. Ever go somewhere and it's just a smorgasbord and you have no idea what direction to go in? Well that's not Mr. Wraps at all. They've got a LOT of choices, but all compliment each other very very well. The prices are a bit high until you actually get the food and realize the portions are LARGE!! Cons: The staff (two brothers who are owners) just simply have no personality. In fact, I may go so far as to say they seem slightly annoyed by having customers. If the owners hired some great front of house employees, and kept themselves in back, this place gets five stars. Also, avoid the salads. They're very good, but overpriced in my opinion.EDIT: 5-14-12 I may have gone in on a bad day. I was there again today and the Brothers seemed much more pleasant. This place is delicious, make no mistake.
2012-01-16,4,I always get the southwestern chicken wrap...Packed with chicken and full of flavor, you definitely get your money's worth. I can never finish it and for the price its better than most other options out there. This place is popular so plan ahead or you will have to wait.
2012-01-08,5,Honestly? My husband and I LOVE this place. We ordered the first time just from walking by on the street and we have been forever changed. I ordered the Hot Corn Beef Joe sandwich (my go to now every time we order) and my husband ordered the Roasted Turkey Wrap. We were both so pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food and the taste, that we have ordered several times since.Their menu sounds delicious and I always feel a freshness in their food. Now keep in mind, you are not in a 5 star restaurant, but for what their menu offers, I feel you do get a great meal for a cheap price.I will say, you do need to remind them a bit about modifications, we once asked them to be light on the sauce and basically got no sauce, but, all in all, Mr. Wraps is a great Hoboken staple with delicious affordable food.
2011-12-19,4,great selection- tons of differnt kinds of wrapsamazing onion rings- amazing onion rings......not expensive-
2011-12-18,3,This place should be called Mr. Burritos, not Mr. Wraps.  The "wraps" are 80% rice and prepared more like Mexican burritos. But for some reason, I keep coming back for more! You will be stuffed for 8 bucks.  I recommend the Thai Steak Wrap and definitely call ahead or you will be waiting around 20 minutes.
2011-10-06,3,Don't stray from the menu.  I asked to substitute hummus for dressing on a veggie wrap and ended up getting a dry wrap (to Mr. Wraps benefit, it still somehow tasted good).  The next time I went, my boyfriend ordered some sort of burrito wrap and, looking to turn it into a breakfast burrito, asked them to substitute the protein for egg.  Well they put egg in there, all right... hard boiled egg!!  Ha!  I got a bit of a chuckle out of that, but seriously -- hard boiled egg in a burrito wrap??  C'mon naw!Otherwise, Mr. Wraps gives you a heavy wrap for a very reasonable (dare I say cheap) amount of do'.
2011-08-26,3,Three stars is totally appropriate. This place isn't bad, but isn't great. Staff was fairly friendly and my sandwich (errr wrap?) was alright. They seem to have a good report with the Hoboken Police who often grab a bite to eat there quite often. It's worth a return trip in a pinch, but I probably won't go out of my way to venture back soon.
2011-08-06,4,Cool little place. Outside seating and the food was great. Fast & friendly staff. Really big portions too.
2011-05-03,5,Mr. Wraps has the best wraps in Hoboken. Their expertise is in their food making-- it's a small deli like place, so if you're looking to have exquisite service as you sit amongst their plastic tables and chairs, get over yourself and go to an actual restaurant.Anywho, I am a sucker for wrap #14- the Buffalo Chicken Wrap. I had it last August and I fell in love. My experience in eating this wrap is like a catch-22: I wanna devour the wrap because I know how yummy it is, but I never want it to end! Their buffalo sauce is probably the best I've had for their caliber of food (quality is comparable to an Applebee's or Houlihan's wrap).If you're looking for a cheap delicious eat, I would highly recommend this place because for your money you get a good amount of food and I wouldn't steer any Yelpers wrong :).
2011-04-28,3,You could name this place Mr. Wraps, Burgers, and Sandwiches because the menu is just that - and its all good.  Most wraps hover around 6 or 7 bucks and I think you get your money's worth.  Mr. Wraps works for delivery but for some reason I always feel like I get more when I'm there in person.Vegetarians have no fear, they have a meatless wrap!  I've tried it and the mozzarella is goooood.  Of course I would always recommend something with meat in it but to each his own.
2011-03-31,2,Mr.Wraps is a wrap, will not get it again.  The wraps are big but lack flavor and quality. They are bland and the ingrediants taste cheap and processed like from a can. I you dont eat them right away the also get soggy quick.  Not going back.
2011-03-08,2,I just spent 5 minutes writing a review and ended up going to another tab for a second, only to come back and find my creatively awesome review gone! Ugh.Anyway, the only good thing I've ever gotten from Mr. Wraps is a gyro wrap. Whenever I branch out I am more than disappointed - bad turkey burger, meh potato salads, and tonight, the Meh of all Mehs - a chicken parm sandwich.There isn't enough cheese. The chicken is dry dry dry and has a sweet taste to it like it was originally a sweet BBQ that they just threw in to make the chicken parm. Sauce is bland, and there isn't enough seasoning or salt. What a waste of $6.50 and walking a mile in the winter to get there.Never again, Mr. Wraps!
2011-01-13,2,Meh. The service here sorta blows. I've never once seen the counter guy smile. Actually, he usually looks like he's going to cry.I order the same exact (custom) wrap here every single time, and I'm not lying when I say I have been charged a completely different amount each time. They don't even give you an itemized receipt so you don't even know how they arrived at the total. It drives me crazy. A wrap with avocado, rice, lettuce and onion can be $8, $9, $10. WTF?! At least if you're going to overcharge, be consistent.I love that their take-out menu loudly proclaims, DON'T BE FOOLED! WE'RE MORE THAN JUST WRAPS!!!! Um... then why did you choose the name Mr.Wraps?
2011-01-02,3,When it comes to Mr. Wrap's, I don't really have too many complaints about the food, but the delivery time is a bit slow. Regardless, they're still a consistent take out favorite of mine in Hoboken.I enjoy that they have a really big menu. Lots of choices. I usually order the Taco Wrap, the Grilled Steak Wrap, or the Park Classic Wrap. All are solid choices but nothing that knocks your socks off. The creamy red bliss potatoes, however, are amazing. Definitely recommend a side order of those.I would strongly advise against ordering the tortilla pizzas. When my order finally came, half the toppings had fallen off the pizza and had soaked the tortilla to the point that it was impossible to pick it up with my hands. It was a complete disaster. So, I'd stick to the more reliable wraps.
2010-12-23,3,It's a place where you can get wraps and sandwiches. Surprised? No? Neither was I when I walked in.The price is decent and the service isn't bad either. I usually go with the Buffalo Chicken or BBQ Chicken wrap. The atmosphere is quiet, clean and is a good place to have lunch with a couple of friends.Overall it's nothing to write home about, but if you're looking for a well-sized, good-tasting wrap at a decent price, you can't go wrong here.
2010-09-25,3,the food is very good and prices are reasonable.  it's the staff that makes it so unenjoyable to order from mr wraps.  whether you call in your delivery order or pick it up, they are always rude and unhappy to hear from you.  Example, when I asked the girl today if the tomato wrap was garlicky she told me " I have no idea, i don't eat wraps."  makes you want to order from another place that will appreciate your business.  the delivery guys are really nice though.
2010-06-21,2,Ordered from Mr. Wraps yesterday. The food was sloppy and unnecessarily liquidy. My GF didn't finish half her wrap & it was so bad she just threw it out. In a more awkward moment my total for the 2 wraps was $16.02. I handed the guys a twenty and a one hoping he would forget the 2 cents and give me a $5. Nope he counted the 98 cents. I walked the 5 blocks home jingling all the way.
2010-06-08,3,This is a staple in my diet of alcohol, fried treats, and cheap eats you can devour without utensils. My go to is the BBQ Chicken wrap (modified).Wish they would consistently cut up the chicken, so instead I remind them when I order.They always do the nachos for me (86 the meat) with extra beans. MMMMMMMMM mmmmmm nachos!Delivery time on this place is pretty solid. The delivery guys are always hustling around town. I see these guys everywhere.Only time you really get a wait is during football season on Sundays. Never to bad though...and always worth the wait for some boneless buffalo strips and some mac and cheese (super chez-creamy).
2010-05-12,4,Wrap it up I'll take it!!!  Well there is something in town I actually didn't know about and it was mere blocks away all this time.  Mr. Wraps located on a quiet block in Hoboken equals mighty tasty wraps.  My boy put me up on this one Saturday after a gym session and I have been a fan ever since.  The wrap selection is deep, portion size and prices are about average.  These wraps are a two meal deal I've tried several times to finish them off in one sitting, but hey why overdo it that's the 2010 motto!  I have tried various wraps and thus far my selections have all been on point.  If you're a fan of potatoes I recommend the potato salad or the red bliss mashed good stuff here boys and girls. One more thing you can also have your mail or packages delivered to Mr. Wraps.  Who knew?
2010-05-11,4,Eat here all the time and enjoy it almost always!  Tons to choose from, steer away from wraps with rice in them as they tend to be mostly rice.  The Red bliss potato's side is really tasty.  It's going to be a mission to try everything, but worth it.
2010-04-15,3,There has been one restaurant that has been hyped up ever since I've come to Stevens. For those that don't know the terminology, hype is defined by Dictionary.com as "exaggerated publicity; hoopla." Similarly, the word on the street as defined by Urbandictionary.com says that it is "when someone gets excited about something" as shown with the appropriate context sentence "Damn, you hype. Calm down homey." Now that the lesson in street talk is over, Mr Wraps in some circles is one of the most commonly suggested places to grab a bite in town, which is why I was surprised to see that it was never reviewed by the Stute. That's why this week I decided to give Mr Wraps their shot at newspaper notoriety. Mr Wraps is located a couple blocks off Washington St at the corner of 8th and Garden. Not only is their close proximity to Stevens one of the reasons it is a popular spot for students, but also because their total meal price is below $10 and they take our campus currency, Duckbills. About the size of an average deli, Mr Wraps has a few tables inside and some space outside to enjoy your meal. I called in my order at noon on a Wednesday as was told about 20 minutes for 5 wraps, which during lunchtime isn't too bad. After a quick cup of Mario Kart Wii (it has been my apartments unholy addiction of late), we huffed it a few blocks in the sweltering heat to get our food. At an average price of $8 for a wrap, I decided to treat my roommates out to lunch and get a variety of wraps. The first wrap that caught my eye was the one named after our very own institution. The Steven's Grilled Steak Wrap was loaded with steak, creamy potatoes, mozzarella cheese and gravy. Whether you take that as an appropriate representation of our school is up to you, but if one thing is for certain, the Stevens had more steak than a Texas cook out. Next, I got what I felt is a commonly ordered wrap, the Buffalo Chicken. The chicken tenders were moist and just a hint crunchy; however, the massive amount of buffalo sauce and ranch dressing made the lettuce and tomato quite soggy. I was able to forgive the deluge of sauce thanks to the extra zip I tasted in the wrap. My vegetarian roommate tried the Hoboken Veggie Wrap which was a combination of grilled portabella mushrooms, zucchini, yellow squash, tomatoes, roasted peppers and rice. Clearly the most vibrant looking of the wraps, it was very satisfying in his opinion. My other roommate found the wrap on the menu named after him, the Sloppy Joe, and enjoyed the roast beef, Swiss cheese, coleslaw and Russian dressing. Finally, my last roommate was the only one left unsatisfied with hisr Tuna Melt Wrap which was white tuna with romaine lettuce, avocado, tomatoes, and Swiss cheese. Apparently, there was more lettuce than tuna, which took away from the tuna flavor, but overall we had positive remarks on the meal. Offering over 33 different wraps and a well rounded menu of subs, salads, grilled entrees, and more, it is easy to see why Mr Wraps is a hot lunch spot with their ability to have something for everyone on your list. Trying to satisfy a vegetarian, a pseudo vegetarian, and Joe can sometimes be more difficult finding a spot in the 6th St parking lot, but was pretty easy thanks to the diverse menu. Side Note: If you think you're good at Mario Kart, beat me and my roommates and I'll treat you out to the next review. Go big or go home. Bottom Line: Got a group of indecisive friends looking for a quick bite, no place better than Mr. Wraps.
2009-07-10,3,There came a period of time during my senior year where this became my default place with my gf when we wanted cheap eats. Not really sure how or why, but we came here at least a dozen times or more. Back then (2 years ago), the prices were decent as were the meals. I tried a few different wraps and they were all pretty tasty. However, we went back a few weeks ago and it seems that the prices have gone up by almost $2.. now the wraps were in the $8 range instead of $5ish-$6. Not super expensive, but it can no longer really be considered a cheap eat.
2009-07-09,4,Pretty good wraps! Nice variety! Quick Delivery! Always very nice!Also... did you know you can have packages delivered here? Like say you ordered a new laptop and UPS won't leave it at your door because they don't want someone to take it, rather than get one of those paper slippy things and having to wait til the next day to walk back by the path to the sketchy UPS truck on the corner to get your package... You can have it sent here, Mr. Wraps will sign for it and you can pick it up... and maybe even get dinner while you are there! Nice! :)
2009-03-09,3,hoboken is a huge fraternity house where people like to drink cheap beer, belch loudly, drunkenly stagger through the streets before noon, and wait in mob like lines to get into the bars. think animal house with alcohol poisoning. what happens when you re-experience your years in undergrad that you are pretty sure you drunkenly blacked out the first time? you get drunk hungry. enter mr. wraps. strategically positioned in the middle of a lot of party houses, mr. wraps meets your expectations for messy drunk food. pick a wrap- any wrap- does it honestly matter what is in it? each wrap is as big as a chipotle burrito, equally as unhealthy and greasy enough to coat your stomach to prevent next day hangovers. isn't that the only thing necessary for drunk food? i think so. prices are decent-- but really, mr. wraps could charge $10 a wrap and still be crowded because 10 dollars drunk is a lot cheaper than ten dollars sober. really, the scene at mr. wraps is more about being drunk, loud, and laughing at slutty girls 'accidentally' showing their ass crack when seated. mr. wraps is drunk food and that's it. **i really wasn't drunk when i went here but every other patron was, so i am able to reflect on the experience accurately and objectively**
2009-01-28,2,I've ordered here a few different times. I couldn't decide whether or not I was enjoying it. It was simply mediocre. Better to go pick up yourself, when you deliver it definitely comes way too soggy. Chicken ceasar wrap is pretty good, and they are generous with portions. . Do not stray from the menu and create your own wrap, I think perhaps that is where I went wrong. If you stick to their own creations and pick it up yourself, its can be worth it.
2008-09-28,1,i ordered for delivery and was told that my order would take 40mins. an hour passed and i called the place to tell them my order had not arrived. (truthfully how long does it take to assemble a wrap?) the person who picked up the phone told me in an authoritative voice that "he should be there any second, okay?" and promptly hung up the phone.at that point i called back because i was upset:#1 because i was hungry at this point and my food was late and probably cold and soggy(which it was).#2 because when i had expected some form of apology i was greeted with rudeness and hung up on.when i called back, it was the same person who was on earlier and he was obviously annoyed i had called back. i asked why it was so late because i felt i deserved some explanation, if not a full apology. he said, "there was a parade going on and what could i do about that?"wow. at that point i was confounded by this horrible lack of concern for the customer. and then the buzzer rang.as i paid i noticed the bill was higher than expected. the delivery guy said i must've had an old menu. i got their menu off the internet. here. so that plus tax accounted for about 7 extra bucks i didn't expect on there.i asked him if the owner was the one who took orders and he said yes. hmm. i told him to let him know i will not be ordering from them again.as for the food, it was soggy and cold but the portions were decent. we were so starved anything would've tasted good but it was barely edible.i would not recommend this establishment to anyone.
