2021-11-01,3,I love how Napoli's Pizza offers so many flavor options to choose from.  I for one have never seen a pizza spot have a Zucchini Primavera or a Clam slice on the menu.  What a variety!!  My biggest critique is that, in my experience, the crust was thick and tough.  I rally tried to like this pizza- even tried 3 different slices.  Although, I just couldn't get over the crust.  It was taking so much energy out of my jaw to chew it.  Sadly, I will not be returning.
2021-10-02,2,This review is for pizza ordered on 10/2/21 for pickupI ordered 1 white and 1 cheese pizzaRestaurant was quite busy. No greetings.. which is pretty normal for this place so I don't expect that which is sad.The good: Ordered online and pizza was ready before the estimated wait time by 5 mintues despite restaurant being extremely busyThe bad:SaltSaltSalty... did someone spill salt when making the dough? We frequently eat pizza here or the one in Clinton but today's pizza was extremely salty. I initially thought it was the cheese but no it was the dough.. my taste buds are wide open right now.OK.. I understand you are busy, but please do a better job of cutting the slices in similar sizes.. or at least try.. Burned bottom as alwaysA real hit or miss pizza joint. Wish there is a better one out there in terms of taste..
2021-09-07,4,Online order for takeout. Food was ready when promised. Appreciate the gluten free options. Wife had ravioli which. She devoured and said sauce was delicious   I had panini which was very good. Need some napkins as it was large and loaded!One got personal pizza which I may try next time. His looked delicious and some of the specialty pizzas I look forward to trying!Their side salad is as good as what I've had anywhere!  Delicious dressing. Crisp lettuce. Nice additions in the mix.   May get larger version as complete meal option next time.
2021-09-06,1,Took literally one hour and 12 minutes to get three pasta dishes out. How does spaghetti and meatballs take 72 minutes? I could have honestly walked home and made that exact meal and returned to the restaurant and they'd still be cooking. The food is great but I'm convinced the waiter forgot my order. Never coming here again. Choose one of the many similar restaurant nearby, in hopes of avoiding a disaster like this.
2021-08-27,5,I love Napoli's pizza for some of their specialty pizzas. I don't always eat pizzas with a lot of toppings but when I crave those types, I go to Napoli's. Their crust is crispy and their toppings are always fresh! I can never not order their garlic knots. They are just incredible!!!
2021-08-22,5,This pizza joint is easily on my top 3 pizza parlors to visit. As a traveling foodie, that says a lot. I've had quite a few things from this menu but I'd have to say my all time favorite has to be the Buffalo/margarita pizza combo. The seasonings they use are just what a pizza needs. Side note: the chicken parm sliders are winners too!
2021-08-19,5,I almost never review restaurants on Yelp, but the service that we received tonight at Napoli's was truly exceptional. We were there with my cousins and their three-year-old son. Well, their son had a meltdown because it was the end of the day and he was tired. The waitress noticed and brought him a free small Italian ice. I can't tell you how kind it was and how happy it made him feel to get the special dessert. The smile on his face made it all worth it. Thank you so much for your kindness and your amazing service. We frequent Napoli's already, but we will certainly be coming back more often after tonight.And yes, the food is delicious too! I've never had a bad pizza or pasta dish :D
2021-07-13,5,This place was delicious. Super cute outdoor patio and they allow you to bring your own wine. We only had a few days in Hoboken and if we would have stayed longer I can guarantee that we would have ate here for sure several times. The pizza was to die for. CA pizza is a joke now thanks to this place. There is plenty of options on the menu and for us not enough time to try it all. The pasta was a favorite dish as well. You have to dine here at least once. Our server was super friendly and very attentive. There is plenty of parking on the street and surrounding area. This location is absolutely perfect and if we're ever in the area I'm absolutely coming back and trying other items on the menu. We all had food comas afterwards. Delicious!!!
2021-07-07,5,Amazing Pizza and friendly service! Loved the MTA subway signs inside made it feel like you were in NYC!! Definitely worth coming back!
2021-06-15,5,Oh my god I love the personalPizza pies here too good I usually get the small personalPan with the gluten free dough and split it soooooo good
2021-05-30,4,What a cute place! Very nice outdoor set up and indoor is just as cozy. Ordered two personal pizzas to go though but wow these bad boys are huge! Love that you can watch your pizza being made in the brick oven in the back. I didn't realize you can buy by the slice but glad to know that option exist. I was told my order would take 20 minutes but it took less, yay! Had the personal Ciao Bello - half olive oil half with sauce and bbq chicken pizza . I felt the crust of the pizzas were a tad too doughy and not like my favorite NY style thin light cripsy crust. However, the ingredients are so fresh and yummy! My fav was the bbq chicken pizza. Just wow. I really can't believe these are personal pizzas lol so generous with toppings and I'm stuffed with just two slices and plenty left over. Can't wait to come back here to sit outside!
2021-05-19,4,Great pizza and quality service. 8.0 on the pizza scale   Fresh ingredients and clean restaurant
2021-04-18,5,Such yummy pizza and great service! I was in the Hoboken area and was craving pizza around 5 PM on a Saturday, so decided to stop in to try this place. I heard Hoboken has some good pizza places, so I had some high expectations and it definitely didn't disappoint! I got 2 slices: the penne vodka and Sicilian. Maybe it was the hunger talking, but I looooved the Sicilian. Definitely gives NYC pizza a run for their money. Note that the penne vodka is also different from the vodka - I managed to get the one with pasta on the slice.Currently, they have outdoor & indoor dining and takeout (not sure about delivery). For restaurant service, the outside is beautifully decorated with a pretty patio, red tables, and flowers. The inside is so cool with all these different signs and probably a sports game. They also sell pizza by the slice which is what I got. Overall I really like this place, would recommend, and will be returning!
2021-04-11,5,Best pizza in Hoboken by FAR food never disappoints and everything is customizable. My go-to is a large pie with half penne vodka and half plain with meatballs, pepperoni, and onion. Also incredible garlic knots, bruschetta, and the pear salad never disappoints!
2021-03-22,4,If you need a pie, then this is your parlor. They have NEVER let me down. I highly recommend the ciao bello or the penne vodka pie. My brother had a calzone once that they call a pizza ball or something wild and that was delicious too.
2021-03-19,5,We just moved to the area & have been testing out various pizza joints. This was only our second one and I think we're done looking. This will definitely be our go-to for pizza!
2021-03-08,5,One of our favorites in town. Super reasonably priced for a pie and the service is quick. We really enjoyed the Margherita!
2021-03-04,5,Best gluten free pizza crust in Hoboken! So good. Their vodka sauce pie is incredible, but really any of them are amazing.
2021-02-20,3,Food came cold, pizza uncut, chicken rubbery. Hopefully it was an off night for them but can't see myself going back
2021-02-19,5,One of my favorite pizza places in Hoboken! They have the most amazing chicken bruschetta pizza! If you can't decide what to order I HIGHLY recommend this pizza. Ever since I've tried it I only order the chicken bruschetta. It has breaded chicken, fresh tomatoes, chipotle ranch sauce, and of course bruschetta. The pricing is fair and worthwhile for the amazing pizza you get.
2021-01-30,5,The BEST Italian in Hoboken. Hands down the best pizza. Do yourself a favor and get the chicken parm pizza with vodka sauce and pesto drizzle. *mic drop*
2021-01-17,1,Terrible service. Had to wait nearly 20 minutes for a store bought brownie with ice cream. Asked if it was pre made and or fresh and how long would it take as it was ordered last minute. Told it be out fast and just needs to be assembled. For the sake of God it felt like an eternity for the worst brownie and ice cream.
2021-01-15,5,Our go to pizza spot.. it never disappoints! The chipotle chicken bruschetta pizza is to die for. Highly recommend!
2021-01-05,5,I mean the pizza was delicious but the staff (possibly the owner? wish I caught his name)- was so friendly and welcoming and put a smile on my face. I will be back without a doubt.
2020-12-27,2,Cold cold cold pizza! Winter or not, its only 40 degrees tonight! I have gotten pizza in the winter warm enough to eat upon delivery from other restaraunts. Napolis dropped the ball.Ordered half and half chicken/white pie. We were told an hour for delivery which was fine with us. The pizza came cold and rubbery. Practically not edible. This was the 3rd time in a row we got pizza that we had to reheat upon being delivered from Napolis. I think we had enough of this rubbery coldness and will be trying somewhere else the next time we order delivery . 5 of the 8 slices are going in the garbagio. They need to hire more delivery drivers or find a way to keep their pizzas from becoming soggy and cold. P.S. this is my first yelp review, so thats how bad this was
2020-12-23,5,My go to pizza place. I order from here at LEAST 1-2 times a week. From their speciality slices, to their napoli's sliders and pasta dishes - everything is extremely good.
2020-12-13,5,This is one of our favorite pizza spots in Hoboken (and there's a lot haha). They have two locations one on Clinton street and one on Washington street and they're both byob! The one on Clinton is more of a sit down style restaurant where the one on Washington is more of a grab and go pizza spot. However, the food at both places is absolutely delicious!! The pizza is crispy And has great flavor. We have never been disappointed. We highly recommend their chicken parm garlic knot sliders with vodka sauce!!
2020-11-14,5,Excellent service and pizza!We had the vodka pizza and the bbq chicken pie to share amongst 5 of us with a few slices leftover! The flavors were soooo good and the staff was so generous in helping out in any way and providing great service.We sat in the outdoor seating area which was really spacious with good socially distancing between seated parties.I didn't get to see the inside but would certainly recommend coming for the outdoor seating experience!
2020-11-01,5,This pizza is incredible. Ordered from there last night for Halloween and it's some of the best pizza I've ever had. The chicken bacon ranch and margarita are incredible. I would highly recommend.
2020-10-10,4,Ive ordered a couple times out of proximity and convenience. Overall pizza is great, one time the crust was a little too cardboard-y to chew. Their eggplant Parmesan pizza is always good. Garlic knots are excellent. They are solid for to-go ordering and have a nice area of seating outside.
2020-09-26,5,What a gem! We had the prosciutto, fig, ricotta bruchetta appetizer which was unique and so amazing. Then we had  pizza half plain half eggplant parm. It was delicious. We were in the mood for pizza and it exceeded our expectations.  Mariah was a fabulous waitress, very attentive and knowledgeable with a great personality that made our experience even better. We will be back!
2020-09-20,4,A cute little place nearby my house. They offered outdoor seatings. We ordered fried calamari, meat lovers personal pizza and zucchini primavera personal pizza. Everything was great except the crust of the zucchini primavera was too salty.
2020-09-18,4,Wonderful pizza with a chewy crust and fresh mozzarella. Jersey City is a pizza desert with surprisingly few good options, so we have to look next door to Hoboken to get our pizza fix. The eggplant parm pizza had breaded eggplant with a meaty texture almost like sausage, and the chicken pizza had tender chicken pieces and onion which was cooked just the right amount.
2020-09-15,5,Ordered food from here while i was visiting Hoboken and i was soooooo satisfied after having nasty food since my arrival. Me and my fiancé ordered a small cheese pizza and hot wings (fried hard). They say 20 min it took about 15 and was ready upon arrival. The employees were very graceful and nice. The PIZZA....delicious!!! My fiancé loved his wings me he is so PICKY! Thank you guys.
2020-08-23,5,My favorite pizza place in Hoboken. really satisfying and great ambience. I wish I knew how they made their creamy balsamic vinaigrette. would love to make it at home.
2020-08-19,3,This pizza is just "OK" for Jersey standard. They need to kneed their dough les because it is very glutenous and elastic. Also pretty salty. Kneed it softly and for less time.Customer service is fantastic
2020-08-08,4,Really close to where I work and is a lovely spot! serves a great selection of Italian food and friendly service as well. Socially distant outdoor seating available as well! I had the Eggplant Parm here which is incredible!! Generation portion, breaded eggplant cooked and seasoned just right!  On a second occasion I had their lunch deal which was two slices of their speciality pizza and a drink for $7.50! Incredible deal and quite satisfying. I had their vodka sicilian slice and ciao bella slice. Service is very friendly and efficient as well! I would certainly recommend this spot for anyone in the area craving Italian food.
2020-08-01,4,WOW! Talk about flavor. My boyfriend and I ordered two personal pies: vodka sauce pizza and ciao bella pizza. We did also order the calamari but unfortunately but the time we got it, it was very soggy and not appetizing. It definitely was hot but with them closing the lid immediately made the calamari soggy. Outside of that, it really was quick in regards to delivery. It was estimated 1 hour, but came in 30 minutes. Will definitely be ordering here more often, great find!!
2020-08-01,1,It's been a couple/few months since I've been in here because even though we were in the middle of the COVID pandemic, the cooks weren't wearing masks.  I can't be a customer of a place that doesn't care about the safety of it's customers. Even though they allowed their employees to not wear masks while requiring customers to wear them, their pizza hasn't been good lately anyway.  The last several times I ordered from them the pizza was burnt and had very little cheese on them.  It wasn't good, so when I went in again during the pandemic and saw that they had no regard for their customers' safety, it was easy for me to never come back since the food just hasn't been good in a while anyway.
2020-07-31,4,I happened to pass by the restaurant and it sure had a charming Italian patio feel to it!  Ordered the Mediterranean pizza with shrimp - loved the combination of eggplant, chicken, shrimp, onions and mushroom! They claim the pizza is Neapolitan style, but I would beg to differ. Nonetheless, it's pretty good pizza - not the best I've had but definitely one of the good ones. Would love to do some patio dining, which might actually elevate the experience a lot more.
2020-07-11,5,BEST takeout. The pizzas are amazing and so is the chicken parm sandwich. Also the Napoli panini is great. Haven't had a bad meal yet and order from here about once a week.
2020-06-20,5,Super friendly and incredible place to order from. We order at least 3 times a month. If you want good pizza for a reasonable price, this is the move!
2020-06-16,5,A+ service, really happy they have two locations. Pizza is PHENOMENAL and whenever I want wings they hook me up with all flats. Top notch!
2020-06-09,4,I'm not much of a pizza person (I know, and I'm a Hoboken resident) but I'm absolutely in love with their Napoli's signature pasta. It has pancetta, mushrooms, peas and a cream sauce over penne pasta. I've gotten their crab stuffed mushrooms along with the vodka sauce pizza. They tasted good too. Can't wait to come back and have the pasta again.
2020-06-08,4,Ordered takeout here once during the 2020 covid19 pandemic, and was very pleased with the food. I was pretty impressed with the brick oven pizza. The pizza was cooked to perfection and was a perfect thickness. I also highly recommend ordering the Pasta di Napoli. It's penne pasta cooked in this amazing light cream sauce with peas mushrooms pancetta and peppers. We also ordered the crab stuffed mushrooms, which were an excellent app.
2020-06-01,4,Was pretty impressed with this little Hoboken Italian spot. We ordered takeout during the CODIV19 pandemic, and they had a great pick up service that was very limited contact. We paid online before and the order was ready within a half hour. My favorite was the chicken parm sliders (better then their meatball ones). The garlic knots were perfect and the chicken was delish. Looking forward to getting take out again!
2020-05-24,3,I'm torn between giving this place a three and four star review, but I think I'm settling on three for now. It's tough to find great pizza, and harder yet to find great vegetarian pizza, but this place was nearby and the prices seemed decent.I ordered the eggplant parm pizza, and on visual inspection, I wasn't blown away. Biting in, the crust towards the center of the pizza was good, but became really chewy towards the edge and as it cooled down. This pie didn't have much sauce, which I think is on purpose, but it needed more. The mozzarella was ok, nothing really special, and the pizza had chunks of eggplant parm and riccota cheese. Give nice bursts of texture, but the eggplant parm didn't have much flavor, and the riccota was overly salty in parts. Overall, not a bad pizza, but not great. I'm happy eating it, and if it were a few bucks cheaper, I'd probably give it another star for cost to value.I'll probably give this place another try, with a more basic pie and see if that holds up.
2020-05-17,2,I get that times are tough right now and I was hesitant to post, but based on other photos I've seen here, seems like these guys have a delivery problem...serving mashed up pizzas. That's just obnoxious. To think I gave that driver a ten dollar tip and he said "eff your meal, eat it like an animal." ‍Won't trouble them with a delivery order again.
2020-05-15,2,At lunch today two cooks and guy taking orders not wearing face coverings correctly.  They all had them but on their chin.I wish they would take the crisis more seriously during food prep.
2020-05-08,5,To all the Health Freaks, Napoli's salads are 5 stars. Hoboken salad w/grilled chicken is my go to. Bonus they sell solid side portions of grilled (or fried) chicken breast for 5 bucks. To my pizza people, can't go wrong here, one of (if not) the best in Hoboken. Great atmosphere, & service, even during these crazy times. Eat here if you're looking for a good meal.
2020-02-22,5,Amazing! Everything was incredible. The penne vodka pizza, the Napoli sliders (meatballs on garlic knots), Nutella pie, cheesecake, all amazing.It is a smaller place and no reservations, but they did everything they could to sit our large group as quickly and efficiently as possible. The owner is so nice, introduced myself because we have a mutual friend and he was so genuine and sweet.On top of how amazing it was, such reasonable prices for a top notch place in Hoboken. Will definitely be returning soon!
2020-02-10,5,Napoli's is the best. Favorite BYOB in town. Staff is phenomenal. Food is amazing. LOVE THIS PLACE! (Shoutout Mariah for being the best waitress ever).
2020-02-02,1,Ordered 1 large pizza, 1 personal pie and a salad. In total it took 2.5 hours for delivery and when I did call inquiring where my order was, I was put on hold and transferred 3 times. Overall bad experience and will not be ordering from Napoli's anytime soon.
2020-01-26,4,Decent Italian place with reasonable prices! We got the garlic knots and their pasta dishes, but the pizza also looked really good. It was a little loud since there were a lot of families with young children there, but would definitely go back and try the pizza.
2019-11-22,5,Penne vodka pizza was so delicious! Delivery takes a while but it came within the estimated time so no complaints about that.
2019-10-24,4,This is one of the few restaurants open for lunch with a good food and outdoor seating. We went with clients and had mussels, clams, wings, pizzas of many kinds and several parmigiana. After a nice espresso and some dessert we left happily and stuffed. Try it!
2019-10-21,4,My go-to pizza pie spot-BYO-family friendly-2 Hoboken locationsFAVORITES:-vodka pizza pie-garlic knots-fettuccine pasta-blackened chicken pasta-ciao bella pizza
2019-10-05,2,Pizza was ok! Wood fired dough/crust was nice and crunchy. Sauce was a little sweet and eh overall just ok! It was actually better the day after.. but isn't most pizza..  This was my first time trying it. I expected it to be better after seeing all the empty Napoli's pizza boxes laying all over Hoboken! Sat inside and our service was great though! Cute atmosphere, but not sure I'll go back for the food.
2019-09-26,4,Great spot for lunch specials! I've heard mix reviews from coworkers but everything I've bought so far has tasted sooo good. I would definitely recommend the chicken francese lunch special. For $7.50, you get a large sandwich, soda and a side salad. I also recommend the chicken franchese pizza which is only made on Friday's but call before you go to confirm they're making it that day.
2019-09-20,5,Got the margarita personal size pizza and added broccoli, mushrooms, fresh garlic, and sausage. Thin crust, fresh mozzarella and the sauce was perfect and not acidic as California pizza. No heartburn. 4 huge slices that could only have been eaten folded. Loved it! BYOB. Will come back every time in NJ.
2019-09-13,5,Food was just delicious and it came out so fast even though the place was filled with so many customers. The waiters there were also respectful and polite. They made sure we were good with everything and made sure we got everything we ordered.
2019-09-08,5,Had dinner here with two of my friends. The food was great. Easy going Italian. It was very very cheap, my friends go a large pie for $22 which they didn't finish and I got penne allá vodka with grilled chicken for around $17. The place is also BYOB so you can bring wine. I loved it here and will definitely visit again.
2019-09-07,1,I was sitting at a table with my girlfriend for dinner and we had just ordered drinks when a moronic Pizza delivery person walked through the restaurant on his way out the door and upended our place sitting. The Diet Cokes were spilled all over my shoes, jeans and bags and place settings were upended and on the floor. The waitress came over and tried to defend the delivery person saying there "was no other way through the restaurant". I was not offered a comped meal and the waitress asked "what do you want me to do about it?" I will NEVER eat at or order from a Napoli's establishment EVER again.  This establishment is a disgrace to the hospitality and service industry as a whole.
2019-09-07,2,My friend and I ordered from Napoli's hungover in bed in desperate want of a bomb ass panini. We did not receive such. Both paninis tasted extremely bland and unsatisfying. Nothing had flavor. The fries were also mediocre. I hear the pizza is good though.
2019-09-06,4,Decent pizza. We ordered the Margherita pie with added pepperoni and mushrooms. The dough was a little too crispy and hard for my liking and I didn't like how the mozzarella slid off the slice easily Waitress was attentive and friendly. We went around noon on a Saturday and the place was practically empty. We sat outside with enough room for a high chair and stroller. Would give it a try again.
2019-08-22,5,I would say this place is kind of hit or miss.  The first time we ate there we had the bruschetta pizza and it was amazing but despite assurances that the marinara for our garlic knots was in the bag it was not.On our second trip we got half chicken bruschetta and a half chipotle chicken bacon ranch.  Again, it was excellent and the service was great!  The waitress was very attentive, very friendly and very helpful with the menu.On my third visit we got a pepperoni pizza and it was just OK.  The garlic knots did have the marinara sauce this time though.Overall I would definitely recommend this place if you're in the area and looking for pizza but I would say choose one of the specialty pies, which are amazing.  oh, and make sure to check your order if you're doing takeout.
2019-07-22,5,Some of the best pizza I have ever had in my entire life! We tried it on a whim visiting the area and were so impressed!!
2019-07-15,4,We ordered food to go from here Friday. We ordered three different slices of pizza and the clam linguine in white sauce. The slices were good! Tony boloneys is better. But the clam linguine was a 10/10!!! Excellent!! Highly recommend!! The clams were a perfect size. You get a good portion of pasta. The linguine sauce was not too runny and not too thick. Great flavor! Clams tasted fresh and were cooked perfect. Everything was hot and delicious! Service was a little slow but they were busy.
2019-07-08,5,Excellent dining experience. We each had lunch specials with lots of great selections. Very full without breaking the bank. Mariah was our waitress and was super friendly and helpful.
2019-07-03,4,Napoli's is very solid. Portions are large, food is good, and despite the exaggerated delivery times, it usually comes much earlier than expected. Delivery folks are very nice, as well. I've had the pizza while dining in and I've had it thru delivery, and I have to say - it's just not the same getting it delivered. It's still good, it's still hot, it's still fresh...but it's just more soggy. It makes sense, because brick oven should be eaten fresh out of the oven. So maybe call it my laziness and lack of walking around the corner to eat a pizza hot out of the oven...but I still wish it was delivered a bit less soggy. Also, would help if it was cooked a bit more and the cheese sometimes slides around the box. Anyways, you can't go wrong here. Get their app and order away.
2019-07-01,5,This place is amazing, they were really nice and helpful with questions that we had since we were visiting. When I tried their pizza, I was mind blown, definitely the best pizza I've ever had ! I recommend the bruschetta pizza !
2019-07-01,5,Now THIS place is amazing! We came here at about 5:45PM, and I must say, I was a little worried, because it was totally empty. Me and my 3 friends ordered 2 large pizzas: one chicken parm pizza and the other one was half meat lovers and half bruschetta pizza. All of them were really really good!The chicken parm one had big dollops of ricotta cheese, which was yummy, and the meat lovers was tasty as well...but oh man, the BRUSCHETTA PIZZA was one of the best pizzas I've ever had...the sauce on it was good to the last bite!Finally, the servers were very helpful, friendly, and quick. I definitely recommend this place!
2019-07-01,5,In a town full of local pizzeria's, Napoli's downtown is hands down my favorite. First off, the food is amazing. We always order Napoli sliders, they are a must have. We then order a pizza, which we always mix and match and have never found one we didn't like! Next are the people at Napoli's. Definitely some of the friendliest people, from the owner down. Special shout out to Isa, who we look forward to seeing every Saturday night when we go. She has become our favorite waitress in Hoboken and is always giving us honest recommendations, helping with our complicated orders, making sure everything is perfect, and also being so sweet to my kids. She is a gem and part of the reason we keep coming back for more!!
2019-06-28,1,I don't get it. I heard this was one of the best pizza places in Hoboken. The crust was so dry and tasteless and even tough to bite through. Slightly burnt too so it had a bitter taste in spots. Sauce..bland. Toppings were good I guess but nothing special. The staff was nice and so were the guys making the pizzas so I feel bad giving this review but I have to be honest...Maybe they were having an off day??
2019-06-24,5,This is my go to spot for pizza when in the Hoboken area. Went for a biz lunch and ordered a bunch of pies. My two favorites were the white pie and the Chipotle Chicken pie. Yes, Chipotle Chicken! The chicken and fresh tomatoes were delish along with the chipotle sauce. How about chicken parm sliders served on garlic knots...absolutely awesome, cmon! Everything was so good that I decided to order some catering for my sons grad party and nothing disappointed...chicken parm, stuffed shells, penne in vodka sauce all were outstanding and there was plenty of food for my guests but nothing left over. Lastly the owner Frankie couldn't be a nicer guy and his staff is the same way. Will be back soon!
2019-06-15,5,Every time my family comes into town I bring them to Napoli's for fried calamari and pizza. The service here is incredible (thank you Freddy!) and we always feel that we can take our time and relax.
2019-06-13,3,Surprisingly, there is dearth of great pizza in Hoboken. But there is a lot of good pizza. Napoli's fits in that group. Go here for a nice lunch or quick dinner. The pizza won't wow you but it won't disappoint you either. The margherita pie is strong. The eggplant parm pizza is filling and a good pick if you also like ricotta. There's outdoor seating too if you want to on a nice day.
2019-06-01,3,Eat there, don't get it delivered.My eat-in experience has always been a 5-star event.  Food is great.  Service is good.My delivery experience, horrible.  My last delivery was 40 minutes late, burnt and cold.  It was so cold, it looked like left over pizza from the night before.
2019-05-15,2,Long waits but the food is good. Why two stars? Because they can never tend to get my order right at 100 percent. It's either they don't give me the right drink or a drink at all, they don't give you the extra blue cheese you ask for, or they miss something specific you ask for in general. They give you a credit, which is nice, but that doesn't stop the inconvenience of going to the store or not being fully satisfied after you eat a meal you've been waiting for at least an hour. I haven't ordered from the uptown one in a while but is this just a downtown thing?
2019-05-10,5,I regret writing my previous review. I've ordered from here over a couple dozen times since, and the experience (delivery, quality, service) has been nothing but spectacular. In a town overflowing with Italian food, I legitimately think these guys and gals are a few steps above the competition.
2019-04-29,4,This is considered to be one of the beat pizzerias in Hoboken, yet I've lived here for almost three years and never tried it...until last night.I ended up ordering a personal pizza with two specialty flavors: half spinach and artichoke (white) and half eggplant parm (red). Delivery was very quick, definitely under "30 minutes or less." The presentation of the pizza itself was pretty, but you didn't quite know where certain flavors stopped and others began, but maybe that's part of the fun.Generally, the pizza is standard for a Jersey pie: crust that's the perfect hybrid of chewy, soft and a little bit crunchy, rich sauce (creamy with the white sauce and great acidity on the red sauce), and strong flavors that showcase every single topping. However, I did like the spinach and artichoke slices over the eggplant parm ones. The spinach and artichoke slice tasted like a homemade dip spread all over pizza crust. You get great flavor from the garlic, creaminess saltiness from the cheese, and good texture and color from the veggies. As for the eggplant parm, it had rich sauce and perfect eggplant pieces (both in terms of breadedness and overall flavor), but I would've liked less ricotta cheese, which, while presented prettily, made the slice too heavy and too rich. All that said, I'd definitely eat from here again, but maybe try a classic slice?
2019-04-03,5,AMAZING FOOD!!! I order here at least 2-3 times a week and can say that everything on this menu is delicious. Good thing I live right across the street
2019-03-27,1,The. Worst. Service. I ordered a salad and was last to get my food. We were probably sitting for 15-20 minutes before even getting water. The waitress came back multiple times to question our order. We all got salad or wraps. No appetizers and nothing complicated.
2019-03-17,5,Very nice ambiance.. good food.. quick service compared to any other restaurant on any Friday evening value for price waitress gave nice recommendations and enjoyed my Personal Ciao Bello and Pesto pasta was nicely prepared and presentation was good Best part is BYOB + Pizza == Full Enjoy
2019-03-08,4,Decided to stop by after reading reviews. Very busy with both to go and dine in orders. We were quickly greeted and seated. We were craving a good ole Italian pizza so we decided on 1/2 margarita pizza 1/2 pepperoni and shared a Vodka pasta. The pasta arrived first, the sauce was very flavorful, wish they would have served bread with the order. The pizza followed and it was perfect. The sauce was just right and the crust was thin but great. We all devoured the pizza. Great ambiance, location and attentive staff. The staff offered suggestion of places to visit near by. Parking was tricky but we found parking not too far.
2019-02-16,4,The food here is amazing and they're vodka sauce (and anything on the menu that has it on it), is the best I've ever had. You really can't go wrong with anything but personal favorites are the buffalo chicken wrap and the vodka pie (pictured here). The uptown location is often pretty full so suggest popping into the downtown location if you experience that or are worried about that.Highly suggest only dining in here. While their food is really really good and I suggest everyone try it for themselves, the take out is TERRIBLE. It's odd cause everything else is so great including in dining service but the delivery may be the worst out of any in Hoboken. Not sure if it's their timing or what but food often comes really late, cold and and wrong. That said, i wouldn't let it deter you from trying them regardless.
2019-02-04,5,Yet another BYOB favorite. On the recommendation of a friend, my boyfriend and I came here for dinner on a Friday night with a bottle of wine. After much consideration, back and forth, and debate, we decided on a large pie half zucchini primavera, half penne vodka. All I have to say is *kisses fingers while very dramatically saying muah* it was magnifico. The crust was soft and burnt just enough. The sauce on the Zucchini Primavera was delicious and the mozzarella was not gloobby, as it can be when the cheese isn't over the entire pie. The Penne Vodka was also incredible and the call to add sausage to it was my boyfriends call and one I will only admit was a good one here, on Yelp, where my secrets are safe...We got the Clams Oreganata as an appetizer and, although tasty, it was nothing special and I probably wouldn't order it a second time. The staff was incredibly kind and attentive and did not SEEM to mind at all that we took forever to order. Really, it was forever... But with so many insanely delicious looking specialty pies, we couldn't decide for the life of us. So happy we gave this place a shot because I am very confident it will be our new go to pizza spot. Although we were sitting right by the door and had to keep our coats on the entire time, it is super cozy and good place to polish off a bottle of wine and kick back with some great pizza.
2019-01-07,5,Great customer service. Pizza came out hot and crispy. Also, loved their  fettuccine Alfredo, very creamy and flavorful. Will definitely come back.
2019-01-05,1,The absolute worst delivery service I've ever experienced...I placed my order and waited 2 hrs to get the food! I kept calling and every time it was the same answer, "they should be there any minute". Pizza came cold, dry and unfortunately we couldn't enjoy what we hoped we would get.I'm sure the pizza is good but delivery service needs major improvement.
2018-12-15,3,Great food but was a nightmare tonight. The poor staff had to deal with a bunch of loud kids running around with the parents ignoring them.  Then the parents were yelling and encouraging the kids. Then a bunch of drunks started screaming and bumping into guests and the servers. Not sure why the manager was awol on all this but how about stepping up next time so all your customers aren't miserable.
2018-12-03,5,Great to have Napoli's near to us it was a way to go to eat at the other branch, same good pizza in a different location, I think the menu got bigger but I only ever eat pizza, the wait time for take out seems long to me 90mims on a Friday night but I never order take out so ...Best pizza in Hoboken in my opinion
2018-11-12,1,This review is due to their delivery service and lack of customer service. I ordered our lunch at 1:02pm on a Monday via their website and finally received it at 2:32pm after calling twice. Each time I called I was transferred 2-3 times and had to retell my story to 3 different people.  By the time the food arrived, it was ice cold.  When I asked for a refund, they could only offer to remake my food and deliver it hopefully in another half hour. This did not work as I needed to leave for an appointment and did not have any faith the food would arrive in that amount of time.  Of course there was no manager on site to talk to.  I am actually moving 3 blocks from this location and they just lost a customer.
2018-11-11,5,A great little place with authentic pizza you have to fold to eat. We went to the one on Clinton St, Hoboken. The crust is crispy around the edges and has a chewy bite-sauce is mild with the flavor of basil. We got there after 10, and the staff was making a fresh pizza, available for slices. Two, by the way, were enough to satisfy! There is a full menu, pasta included. Staff, friendly and pleasant.
2018-11-08,4,My new favorite place to bring family and friends for a BYOB dinner. The food is great and the pizza is definitely up to par with Hoboken. Most recently, I went with two friends from college and they wanted a quiet place to eat, drink, and possibly watch some college football on a Saturday night. When we got there, there was a TV but it was playing a different game. We asked the waiter to change it and he did with no issue. We ordered garlic knots, mozz sticks, and two personal pizzas for four of us. It was more than enough food and it was incredibly priced. We even forgot out leftovers and when I ran in, they were already thrown out. The manager gave us two new slices to take home. Fantastic service!
2018-11-04,4,Tried pesto pasta, marinara sauce pasta and veg pizza. Everything was quite flavorful but  definitely try the pesto pasta. It was really good and creamy.
2018-09-29,4,The penne vodka pie. that's all I'm gonna say. Crispy, chewy, flavorful (sometimes penne vodka pizza can be bland). Haven't even tried anything else on their menu because I'm so obsssed with this pie. Get it!
2018-09-29,2,I have actually been looking for a great buffalo chicken pizza to eat again after attending a party but did not remember the name. After trying to search up which pizza place had some pretty good reviews and apparently "the best buffalo chicken pizza ever", I tried out Napoli's. The pizza slices had a hard and thin non-chewable crust like when you bring home leftovers to heat up in the microwave, the pizzas weren't as cheesy as I was hoping for, and I was a bit disappointed to see that they grab and heat up the pizza slices/pies with their bare hands up front. Aside from the cons, the slice of buffalo chicken pizza I had was okay but could have been fresher and better.
2018-09-23,5,Best service I've ever had. Period. Plus, the food was better than the service. The world needs more restaurants like Napoli's. My girlfriend and I walked in around 8:30, our first time at the restaurant. Unsure of how to be seated, we asked the first waitress we saw. She immediately showed us menus, asked us if it was our first time, asked what kind of food we were in the mood for, and told us about a wine delivery service we could use (the place is BYOB). She sat us outside, and our service was quickly taken over by Isa, our waitress for the evening. She was incredible.As if our direct service wasn't good enough, we were constantly checked on by Frankie, Jay, and of course the waitress we'd spoken to first. I had the chicken parm with vodka sauce (recommended by Isa), my girlfriend had the Ciao Bella pizza with marinara sauce (which of course I tried-- amazing), and we split the pear salad--best salad I've had in a very, very long time.All in all, the place was authentic. It didn't try and put on fake faces in hopes of decent tips, but instead showed real emotion that was reflective of a well run business, and employees who cared about their customers. Well done, Napoli's.
2018-09-22,5,Best pizza in Hoboken!! Frank and his staff were very attentive and made sure my pregnant girlfriend feel right at home!!
2018-09-17,2,Decent garlic knots but pizza is lackluster. Ingredients are not fresh and flavor is lacking
2018-09-14,2,Love the food. Two stars Bc I ordered a small pie w black olives and they give me Greek calamata olives. Not only that but I pay extra for a topping and it is so little amount. Didn't really matter Bc calamata olives is not what I asked for.  So so poor!!! Some slices don't even have anything on them.
2018-09-07,5,My favorite place to get pizza! They also make the best sliders! Get the garlic knots with meatballs!
2018-09-02,2,Thanks for the raw pizza and the cooked salad. Staff was real friendly, so there's that.
2018-08-25,5,Best pizza I've had in my life! We came in 20 min to close and The whole staff was awesome and took us setting us a table after they had already cleaned the place. The pizzas were amazing and Frank gave us special attention making sure we were not rushed at all and making us feel like we were having a true Napoli pizza! Kudos!!
2018-08-04,5,Came for brunch with some friends and I was very impressed with their top notch quality food and great service! The owner frank greeted my friends and I and seated us. Our waitress knew the menu very well too and recommended the breakfast pizza which was phenomenal. Prosciutto, fresh moz, and 2 over east eggs - one of the best brunch meals I have ever had!Not only will I be back but this will be my go to place for brunch in Hoboken
2018-07-22,1,2 hours to deliver a single pizza.  What a joke.  I called twice for an update (nobody called me) and both times they claimed "it was on the way".  There are plenty of other pizza places in Hoboken.
2018-07-13,5,This place is a hit. The pizza, the atmosphere and the people are all great. We got a large pizza; half Eggplant Parmesan, half Zucchini Primavera. The pie was huge and the flavor didn't disappoint. I don't normally eat just veggie pizza, but these two hit the spot. The Eggplant Parmesan is creamy and filling and the Zucchini Primavera is light and fresh. We sat at an indoor/outdoor table and really enjoyed the day and the ambience. And the staff were great too, always checking on us and super friendly. Can't wait to go back!
2018-06-03,5,I live in New York, my family came to visit. Took them to some pizza spots -they all decided they liked jersey pizza better. The tomato sauce is my favorite and why I return to Napoli's. Any of the pizzas are delicious.Staff is the nicest, most accommodating restaurant staff I have ever seen. It is exactly what you want and expect from a good neighborhood spot. Also, BYOB
2018-06-01,5,It's great to find a restaurant in Hoboken that has great food and lets you take your time without trying to rush you out to fit in the next table. The food is delicious and I love a good byob. The service is great - the servers are friendly and efficient, and Vito is super sociable and speaks to the various tables. Apparently you can order wine for delivery even, and the prices are really reasonable (both the delivery booze and the meals). We brought our own wine this time but will be ordering in the future! We had the Napoli sliders and a large pizza, and it was a solid and delicious meal for three people. Would definitely recommend!
2018-06-01,5,Big fan of Napoli's -- the food is delicious, Vito and his crew are super friendly, and you never feel rushed while you're eating. Super convenient, my favorite pizza spot in Hoboken. Great service, indoor/outdoor seating, BYOB. Also has wine delivery option in case you forget your wine. Can't get much better. Can get a specialty pizza and half plain, which is my JAM! Very accommodating. Bottom line, come here for pizza, it's awesome.
2018-05-29,5,If I could give this place more then 5 stars I would! The location was perfect from where my boyfriend and I were staying! We didn't wait to be seated at all fast service and delicious food! It was 4 of us and we ordered 2 pies, mozzarella sticks, and garlic knots! So far I was impressed on how quickly they brought our food out yet it tastes like a home cooked meal. Our waitress was excellent, funny and so attentive! But what really impressed me was the owner! He was so lively and in good spirits it radiates off of him and into his business! Everyone there was so happy and enjoying everyone's company! I feel silly for forgetting the owners name but you will recognize him when you enter and never forget him when you leave! The pizza was crispy and delicious! It was so good we went back the following day for dinner again! What a good spot for some good ol' pizza! ITS BYOB!!! This place is the best!
2018-05-27,5,A wonderful and welcoming pizza place. Sells good times and memories along with great pizzas. Veto is the man!!
2018-05-27,5,This place not only has some of the best pizza, but it has some of the nicest people! One of the owners, Vito, is so friendly. He was greeting people, cleaning tables and making sure everyone was having a great time. Our waitress, Isa, was very personable and took great care of us. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for good food and great service!
2018-05-27,5,SERVICE: Vito just welcomed us in here on our first night in Hoboken and made our night! We came in as a family of 6, on a busy Saturday night, with my dad in a wheelchair. While we were standing awkwardly outside trying to figure out if we could get him up the stairs or if there would be a table open, Vito came out and quickly ushered us in, saying "everyone is welcome at Napoli's!" He even offered to help carry the wheelchair, and immediately cleared a couple dirty tables and pushed them together for us to sit down. Somehow extra chairs and servers came out of nowhere to help him get it all together. I have never in my life encountered this level of welcoming service at any restaurant, let alone when showing up with special needs on a busy night. Kudos to this place for setting the standard of service for every place I'm going to in the future. FOOD: Pizzas are just incredible! It arrived very quickly after we ordered, piping hot. We ordered four so we could try more sauces and variety and every singe one was delicious. The penne vodka pizza is super yummy and very filling because of all the carbs ;) Ciao Bella was also a standout, very fresh ingredients and cheese. Also ordered salads and they were simple, and very good but order several if you have a large group, they are small side salads. Note: It is BYOB so my hubby ran out for some bottles of wine and they provided the glasses.
2018-05-25,5,Great food, great service! Classic Italian and I'll definitely be back. Clam pizza is delicious and you can't go wrong with the pastas.
2018-05-20,5,we had dinner last night and Vito at the front was extremely welcoming. i was outside with my father in law  who's in a wheelchair and Vito offered to lift him into the restaurant exclaiming "if we can't help each other, what good are we". and throughout our dinner i saw the same hospitality to everyone that came in the dooroh and the pizza was pretty damn good too
2018-05-17,4,Full Score: 4.43As an unbiased new member of the Hoboken area, I can say the Napoli's staff knows how to make a slice. Beautiful brick oven inside with a nice layout for take out orders. The whole staff was on their toes not their heels, ready for customers to walk in or take a call. I went with a large original cheese pie for my first time, as any pizza veteran would do. I was able to get down 5 slices, and plan on at least putting down two more in the next few hours. Based on my first experience, I'll be venturing into Napoli's various topping selections in the future and will do a Follow-Up review. Stay tuned and as always, talk to me nice.
2018-05-08,2,Got a very disappointing pizza from Napoli's this past weekend. I ordered a pie, half with cheese and pepperonis and half with mushrooms, onions and no cheese since I am vegetarian and lactose intolerant. I wrote in the notes that it's important to make sure half the pie was without cheese and meat and to call if there was any questions. Instead I got a pie with an abnormally abundant amount of pepperonis, mostly on the half of the pie that was supposed to be just mushrooms.  Since I'm a vegetarian I took off all the pepperonis and underneath there was barely any pizza sauce or any of the other toppings I ordered. I called the restaurant, very disappointed, and asked for a refund. They insisted to send me a new pie but I said that it was too late and I wasn't going to be home.  I don't have a problem with their pizza quality but their customer service is poor. If you can't follow directions, at least provide your customers a refund. They just permanently lost my business :(
2018-05-08,5,Such a great place. We had my daughters baptism brunch here last min and the staff and manager were so accommodating and attentive. Highly recommend dining here . The food was outstanding and what even better it BYOB  So if you are in Hoboken and have not stop in I highly recommend dining here ASAP... Looking forward to my next visit Recommend ordering Fried Calamari Clams  Pizza  Rice Balls Stuffed Mushrooms And my personal fave Rigatoni pasta dish with sweet sausage and broccoli rabe ENJOY !!
2018-05-06,5,Best pizza in Hoboken!! We have not eaten at any other pizzeria since Napolis opened on Willow. Iza is the best waitress and makes you feel right at home. Everyone at Napolis makes the dining experience amazing!
2018-05-06,5,The pizza is great and the people who work here are very friendly. The penne vodka is also delicious. The redone inside (after taking over the old Grimaldis) is a big upgrade and they are BYO.
2018-05-05,5,One of my favorite pizza places in Hoboken.  They have the best Brick Oven Pizza.  Service is great. Tonight we walked in without a reservation.  Party of 12.  Stroller in tow.  Vito, the owner, was so kind and accommodated us.  He went out of his way to make sure our dining experiences was pleasant.  Our kids loved the traditional pizza.  We enjoyed the wings and Margarita pizza.  Highly, highly recommend their wings to start with.  Go early as this is a Hoboken hot spot.  Don't forget to bring your favorite cocktail as it is BYOB.  Outside seating available.  Great place to dine especially if you want to eat where the locals go!
2018-05-04,5,Perfect spot with outdoor seating just off the busy Washington St.  BYOB with great service.  Buffalo Chicken pizza is a must!   Owner/manager Vito is extremely inviting and friendly and makes the entire experience more enjoyable.
2018-05-04,2,Had to call a waitress over after 29 minutes of sitting inside even though they were clearly fone taking care of the customers next to us. Don't know how long we would have had to wait if we didn't call someone over, very unprofessional and quite annoying.
2018-04-30,2,I'll start with the food was delicious. Went there on a Sunday night with a friend. It was pretty quiet with maybe 2-3 tables full...after we sat down we waited for another 10 minutes before the waitress dropped  our menus on off on the table..didn't introduce herself and the rest of the night was just a display of bad service. The waitress and who we assumed was the manager would shout back and forth to each other about orders or just general conversation across the tables in front of customers. The tables were clearly not cleaned after people had left (including ours which still has crumbs on it)..maybe we went on an off day maybe not but I live a block away and I can assure you I will not be back. I have too many good options in Hoboken to go somewhere with subpar service. It's too bad because I love the Napoli's uptown which has amazing service & waitstaff and was excited that one opened up closer to my apartment..
2018-04-27,5,This place is great. Amazing pizza, even better service. Have never had a bad experience, whether I get take out or eat in. Plus, they're BYOB!
2018-04-25,4,I went here and I have 0 experience with authentic New York-style pizza, so this was just a darn good slice for me. I got buffalo chicken, which isn't the most common pizza topping, but it was good. Prices are reasonable and the slices are FRESH! It's a good place to grab a bite, for sure.
2018-04-22,5,First time at any Napoli's location, but will definitely be going back! Super friendly and attentive staff who were quick with their recommendations.  The eggplant parm and broccoli rabe pizzas did not disappoint. Personal pizza size was super generous for $12.  Definitely ask for a side of the vodka sauce for crust dipping. Only mistake we made was not grabbing a bottle of wine beforehand - they are BYO. Looking forward returning soon and enjoying their outdoor seating.
2018-04-05,5,wowwww was this an amazing first experience at Napoli's! Went here on Easter Sunday night craving a perfect NJ pizza and they did not fall short. we were instantly greeted with warm welcomes and it felt like a typical Italian family vibe. They offered us descriptions for different menu items and insisted we sit while we wait for our pizza. We were able to see the guy make our pizza from start to finish and it made it that much more mouth watering. The pizzas are made in wood fire ovens and cook super quickly! We brought it home and even after our 7 min walk, it stayed crispy and warm. Not to mention DELICIOUS. I recently moved downtown and this will 100% be my new pizza spot.
2018-03-26,4,My friend and I were enjoying drinks at The Nag's Head, a casual neighborhood bar that allowed patrons to bring outside food, when she asked if I wanted to share a pizza.  I agreed, and she followed this up by asking if I had a favorite spot in town.  I immediately said Napoli's.  I had only been to the uptown, Washington Street space, but knew that they had just opened a second location on Clinton Street, just a few blocks away.  We gave them a call and ordered a small pizza with mushrooms to be delivered to the bar.  The added topping took the cost over the $10 minimum delivery fee, which was great.  We were also able to swap the basic crust for a whole wheat version, which did have a rich grain flavor, but was still very enjoyable.  As always, their marinara sauce was well-spiced and slightly sweet.  The cheese was gooey; and the mushrooms were freshly roasted.  The pizza was as delicious as any other I had ever had from Napoli's.  The 6-sliced personal pie was also the perfect size for our light evening dinner.  However, I took away one star from my review, because my friend told me that the delivery man criticized her tip amount...
2018-03-02,5,This place is BOMB!  Pizza is fresh and flavorful (get half and half when you can't decide), the menu is extensive, and the owners/staff are friendly.  It's BYOB and there's a liquor store ~2 blocks away.  Ends up being a cheap meal for a TON of delicious food that you'll have left over for the next day.It's pretty casual with a neighborhood vibe and is great for any outing -- date, family dinner, or catching up with friends.GO NOW
2018-02-11,5,We just returned home from an adult birthday party at Napoli's Pizza  Restaurant.  We were a bit surprised about the choice of restaurants.  Pizza was served as an appetizer.  We fancy ourselves "pizza snobs". After one bite,  we understood the dining choice.   The crust was thin and crisp. The mozzarella was fresh slices as opposed to the shredded we are used to.  Since we were going to be served a meal,  my friends and i only opted for one slice.  My husband couldn't resist a second slice.  Next various types of salads were offered.  They were scrumptious.  When my meal arrived,  I had it packed up for lunch tomorrow.  Everyone we were sitting with said their meals were equivalent to an upscale restaurant.  The wait staff deserve 5*****. Vito was not only accommodating,  but,  my friend and i agreed that he was the afternoon entertainment.  He sat down with us when there was a lull and mesmerized us with his stories. I'm sorry i don't remember the waitresses name.  She was also quite attentive.  Looking forward to returning soon!
2018-01-22,5,I have been dying to try Napoli's and was so excited they finally got a downtown location. After all the instagrams of their pizza once I saw the penne vodka pizza I knew it was time! I ordered a personal penne vodka pizza online And the pizza was ready at the exact time they told me it would be! It was soooo good and made my night. Can't wait to try other pies! Finally a nicer pizza place downtown that you could even just get slices from!
2017-12-31,5,Wow what a pizza!!! The pasta de napoli is amazing.  Ignore all the strunzos who don't know Italian food. Vito is the man and will give great recommendations
2017-12-30,5,Consistently excellent pizza, they always have a solid selection of slices on offer. My personal favourites are the BBQ chicken and the meat lovers which has a phenomenal meatball. You honestly can't lose if you're after a quick, delicious New York style thin crust pizza!
2017-12-28,1,Love the pizza, hate the service. You're better off ordering delivery from their other original location uptown, at least you don't get bad service and attitude. Not sure how someone with any common sense acts the way our waitress did. She didn't write down anything we ordered and forgot half of it, brought us the wrong stuff, and I was super nice about it but she gave me an attitude and made me feel bad. Very weird!  Dinner for 2 was $50, for just 2 personal pizzas and a salad. We will resume the $30 delivery from the uptown location instead, at least we can enjoy our food without getting a bad attitude! Hire a more professional waitress please.
2017-12-27,1,Arrived early to pickup a personal pizza that had already been sitting in the back for a while. Once the staff finally found it, I returned home with quite the disappointment. Instead of a Napolitano style pizza with fresh mozzarella, juicy sausage, and garlicky broccoli rabe, I got a dry/flavorless mess. The pizza was stiff and tasted like the cardboard box it came in. I'm not sure how they think they could get away with replacing fresh mozzarella with the dry stuff in Hoboken of all places. Sausage was just bad so I picked it off. Finally, the broccoli rabe was an afterthought as someone obviously forgot to put it on before the oven. On top of everything the pie was cold after a one block walk and continues to make my stomach rumble as I type this. I hope Napoli can get it together soon.
2017-12-15,5,Great food , love the new  place , more parking at this location ! Waitress always super friendly and so is Vito !
2017-12-14,2,The food is decent but portions are very small. Sides are basically the size of condiment cups and salads are $12 & essentially a tad larger than a side salad
2017-12-10,5,We'll definitely be coming back here! They have some of the best Italian food and pizza in the Hoboken/Jersey City area.We ordered a margherita with breaded chicken, creamy Cajun fettuccine, and arancini. The pizza had a nice savory sauce with just the right amount of crunch to the crust. My favorite part of the meal was the creamy Cajun pasta! The sauce wasn't too heavy with cream and had a delicious kick from cayenne and paprika. The arancini was a hit, too. I traveled along the Amalfi Coast this summer and Napoli's arancini was legit; better than half the ones I had eaten along the coast.Go check this restaurant out! And say hi to Vito! His hospitality really made the dining experience 100x better. He checked in with us frequently and made us not mind the 30-minute wait to be seated (they were pretty crowded that night).
2017-12-09,2,Went for the first time tonight, and ordered the Sicilian pizza... it it was only ok, the crust was very thick and puffy. After gulping down three slices and being full, I was left very unsatisfied because of the lack of flavor, and the sparse toppings.Service was very poor. We had to permanently be looking around for our waiter and the cherry on top was when we had to walk our bill up in order to pay it and leave.I understand this is a casual place but with so many other better options in Hoboken, you would do well to skip this one.
2017-12-05,5,I've eaten here and taken out a few times since it has opened. Great food and the owners, Vito and Frank, are great hosts and genuinely care that you enjoy your experience. Great for a Friday night to bring a bottle of wine and get a pie!
2017-12-02,5,Love the new location of Napoli's! Inside is cute and very clean. I like the setup of this location much better than the uptown Hoboken location. We ordered caprese and calamari for appetizers which were both delicious! Eggplant parm and chicken Marsala for entrees. Highly recommend the eggplant! Our food was delicious and our server was very friendly. Great BYOB Italian spot. Will definitely return!
2017-11-20,4,We were excited and curious to see how the new Napoli compares to the old Grimaldi's and all of the seemingly endless parade of new pizza/pasta joints.  I'm pleased to report a very good experience.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  Layout was comfortable and kid friendly.  Got the American Sliders appetizer - delicious!  Managed to save room for a slice of pizza which was very good.  Will definitely be added to our rotation.
2017-11-19,5,Always been a fan of the up-town location so when i saw that they were opening one in the location formerly owned by Grimaldi's I was thrilled since i live around the corner.Have ordered twice so far and it's been great each time. Second time, i messed up an ordered through a delivery app and did not realize it was for the uptown location. When i came in not only did they understand the situation, they upgraded the size of my pizza and let the uptown location know i wouldn't be making it! So, great pizza and awesome service, will be a great addition to this area!
2017-11-19,3,This is where the other hoboken Grimaldi's was. They could use some work on their ambience. We went on a Sunday evening and the place was brightly lit up it is not so warm and inviting as the Washington Street location. The waitstaff is pretty Friendly. We ordered a salad the slider appetizers and the margarita pie. My husband really liked the sliders. I thought the arugula salad was good the dressing is sweet it is my only complaint.  The pizza while hot was good but the crust gets chewy as it cools off. The crust is our biggest complaint but it does make the pizza.
2017-11-18,4,We've had deliveries from the uptown location and were always pleased.  When the downtown location opened up we were excited to give dining-in a try and we were not disappointed!  Our server made great recommendations for sharing our pizza and we were served promptly.  It was fantastic. The crust was thin and crispy and the toppings were fresh and high quality.   This place is a great value, with lots of variety and healthy options on the menu.  This will be our go-to pizza stop in the neighborhood.
2017-11-17,4,I used to go to the original Napoli's every couple of weeks for pizza and then I moved downtown and it was kind of far... So I was thrilled to see that they have very recently opened up in the old Grimaldi's spot on the corner of First and Clinton.They have done a great job of renovating the restaurant. There's a new frontage, lots of wood and some nice lighting. It's a 'boken pizza joint so it's not super fancy or anything but I prefer it to the original, overall it looks a lot more modern.The menu is a lot bigger than it used to be but apart from an occasional salad for the table all I ever come here to eat is the pizza! The pies are thin crust NY style pies and I would recommend spending an extra couple of bucks and ordering a Margherita rather than the Original pie. I'd also recommend sticking with the more traditional toppings rather than the more inventive ones.There was a bit of a mix up with our pie - we received one with sausage and anchovies (why would you order that?!?) - but they made our correct pie quickly and comped our drinks to take care of the mix up. The pizza here is excellent just as good as at their other place. There's a few kinks they need to iron out (get a door closer on the front door to stop the draughts and for the love of God give the servers pencils and pads so they don't screw up orders) but I'll give them a break as they only just opened.What else do you need to know? It's BYOB like the original and they have the two slices and a soda deal like the original at lunchtime. And it's insanely cheap for the quality of pie you get, dinner for two for $25.00 is a deal in anyone's book. We'll be back.
