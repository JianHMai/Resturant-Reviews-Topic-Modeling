2021-10-16,5,Amazing flavors. Ordered black Raspberry and  coffee Oreo. Every flavor is so smooth and yummy. It's definitely not very sweet so you can enjoy the real flavors behind the icecream. I never had any good homemade icecream and this is definitely outstanding for me
2021-09-19,5,Wow! Perfect! Best ice cream of my whole life! Such a charming spot and the ice cream is out of this world delicious. You can get two different scoops in the same cone!
2021-09-12,5,Visited on a Sunday evening and it was kinda packed. Their inside is pretty small but they have a little outdoor seating area, where the menu can be viewed through the window. Their sizes, from what I remember, were kiddie (1 scoop), regular (two scoops), and whatever-was-above-regular (three scoops), although there might be an even larger option. I ordered their fudge brownie ice cream. The ice cream itself tasted like a subtle chocolate flavor, not too overpoweringly sweet. The brownies were pleasantly chewy and added to some nice texture differences, as well as a nice shift in flavor. I'm no expert in ice cream quality, but I'd like to think that the quality of Thomas' is pretty good and is leaning towards the dense gelato side.A nice sweet treat that you should definitely swing by!
2021-07-17,5,So good! I stopped by a few weeks ago with a friend and have been meaning to try this spot! Everything is homemade and it tasted very fresh. I loved the selection of flavors and how nice the staff was. We each got 2 scoops (huge) with chocolate chips on top. Cookie and cream was delicious! Pricing is reasonable as well I believe it was 6/7$ for each? Can't remember exactly but I'll absolutely continue to support this local spot!
2021-06-27,1,I've heard good things about this place, so went there on a Sunday at noon. The schedule posted on the door says it's opening at 12pm, but the place didn't open until 1pm. Had to wait for 1 hour on a scorching 90+ degree heat, as I've promised my kids milk shakes from here. Between 12-1pm, there was a guy inside who would not open, apparently whoever was on duty the day before left the ice cream machines in an unusable state. Very dissappointed that this place is not reliable.
2021-06-04,5,Small and sweet ice cream shop with all the basic flavors and a few unique ones. The servers were lovely. It has outdoor seating, which is nice. It's the perfect local spot for when you are craving ice cream.
2021-05-15,4,Kinda disappointed in myself that I didn't know about Thomas' sooner - homemade ice cream in my town and I haven't tried it?! Shop is small but they make it work for them at Thomas' - unlimited tasters of their delicious ice cream makes it an occasion.    Beware, the secret it out and expect to wait a bit on line because it is that worth it.  What's great is the portion sizes are massive, so order a size smaller than you think you want. Lots of people rave that the ice cream isn't sweet, which is great if that's what you're looking for - I personally knocked a point down because I want that sweeter taste.  When I indulge, why not go full out?  But def try it, support local, and keep coming back to try all their flavors!
2021-04-08,5,Great neighborhood ice cream shop the employees were so nice to us our dog Zoe! Ice cream was so good is the cherry on top! Will definitely be back!
2021-04-04,4,Cute little cafe on the street. Very friendly staff and service. This was our first time here so we tried a couple of flavors before picking this. Lots of options to pick from, and finally caved it for the chocolate options.
2020-10-31,5,Support local, especially when it's awesome with great selections of HOME MADE ice cream & wonderful service!! Also the BEST milk shakes!! It's October 31st and 40 degrees out but we're STILL craving Thomas's & we're gonna take a walk over after dinner & get some ice cream & a shake! Perfect ending to a beautiful Saturday in Hoboken-a walk on the waterfront, a nice dinner & home made ice cream. Fwiw, Over 70% of business will be gone after covid if we don't support them!!
2020-10-22,5,I live less than two blocks away and come here for a scoop of ice cream often but ordered my first ice cream birthday cake for pickup today. The cake was so delicious and I had the most amazing interaction with the employees of Thomas'. It truly brought a smile to my face (under my mask of course) and after a very long busy week of work, it was exactly what I needed. Thank you so much for the amazing cake and for going above and beyond to make it perfect.
2020-10-22,5,Pretty much the best ice cream I've ever had, or at least in recent memory. The vanilla is super velvetty, rich, and creamy. Same with the Moose Tracks and peanut butter. What's amazing is that anything you get here won't be crazy sweet like many other ice cream spots. Can't believe we have such a wonderful gem near us.
2020-10-06,5,This place is my favorite ice cream spot in this area. I love that it's a no-frills classic ice cream place, with all of the original flavors. If you go at a busy time, the service can be a bit slow, but it is well worth the wait. Plentiful serving sizes too. They were out of root beer last time I went, but looking forward to going again soon to get a yummy root beer float. My other go-to is the peanut butter swirl (incredible classic flavor that I have a hard time finding anywhere else).
2020-09-30,5,Love this place for all their flavors! The ice cream was creamy and not overly sweet. Can't wait to go back to try more
2020-09-27,5,It was a hot day and my bf was getting hungry so we were looking for a cafe. However, with nothing open and everything closing early, we decided to get our caffeine fix with the best combo - ice cream and caffeine in one!Friendly staff, reasonably priced and most importantly, tastes amazing! You get the perfect blend of sugar from the oreos and slight bitterness from the coffee.I don't think we lasted more than 5 minutes before we devoured this between the two of us.Cheat day well done!
2020-09-03,5,We ordered an ice cream cake last week and it was great! For the 8 inch cake we were able to select any two flavors, we got mint chocolate chip and birthday cake. Both flavors of ice cream were delicious!
2020-09-02,5,This place is the cutest little ice cream shop with the best ice cream! Good flavor options, rich ice cream, and super friendly staff. It's a hidden-ish gem on Jefferson but I couldn't recommend it more for the best cone in hoboken. This place is a must on a end of summer night. They take cards and cash :)
2020-07-01,5,When my all time favorite breakfast spot moved from this location I was seriously bummed. But when I saw that an ice cream shop would be taking it's place I nearly immediately forgot about my weekend BEC. I really really love ice cream... I've been here twice now, both times during Covid-19 times and have left VERY happy. Ice cream will do that though. On my last visit I got the black raspberry and lovedddd it. I was looking for something really refreshing and this was it. The ice cream was very soft so it melted quick, it tasted a little like a sorbet rather than hard ice cream but I still loved it. The guy that was working at the counter told us what each ice cream was because they didn't have any signs or a board but he was wonderful so it didn't matter at all. And he offered tastings if we'd like any! Always need to sample one or two.I love that there is a new ice cream shop in Hoboken. It makes after dinner walks that much better. Their team is always extra friendly and helpful. Two cones came out to like $8 and I plan on  stopping in a lot more frequently than I ld like to admit.
2020-06-20,3,I am gonna go back to try again since they were missing a lot of the flavors that have been raves about. Got chocolate peanut butter, barely had any peanut butter. Got a black cherry, barely had any cherry. And had black Raspberry, very creamy not the strongest flavor. The price was excellent but I would just put it at a good ice cream cone right now.
2020-06-20,5,their bday cake ice cream was some of the best i've ever had. with real chunks of bday cake in it! so so good! i got the kiddie size because sometimes i cant finish it all lol. i would return here for sure!
2020-06-20,5,I never even knew this place existed until the hot days arrived and I was craving some ice cream. I was searching for homemade ice cream, something that wasn't super sweet and had great flavor. After evaluating the various ice cream places in Hoboken I decided to give Thomas' a try. There was a short line but it moved quickly. I was immediately overwhelmed by the different flavors because they all looked so good!I ended up settling on the cookies and cream but decided after trying it I will have to be back to explore some of the many great flavor offerings!
2020-06-18,5,Love the chocolate and peanut butter ice cream - have been here several times since opening, all of my family have had really good ice cream from this place.  Nice to come away from the chains on Washington and go somewhere different - keep meaning to try other flavors but always get drawn back to the chocolate and peanut butter.  Worth going out of your way for...
2020-06-14,5,Really good, fresh ice cream, and friendly staff.  I live 2 blocks away and it's very nice to have a local business like this so close by.  I stop in very frequently for a small cup or cone, and am never disappointed. I highly recommend it.
2020-05-15,5,Went today for the first time and LOVED all the flavors we had-Nutella, cookie dough & birthday cake. Homemade & best ice cream in Hoboken!
2020-05-02,5,This is a wonderful neighborhood ice cream shop. The ice cream is delicious and the staff is warm and welcoming.  I've been in every day since I've discovered it!!5/2/2020my granddaughter had a great day today with a delicious ice cream cone. So glad you're openwonderful neighborhood shop!!!
2020-03-01,1,Funny they say the ice cream is homemade. They have all the jars or syrups they use sitting out lol. Feel bad about a 1 star but really have no rational to giving a 2 star.
2020-02-02,5,The best homemade ice cream in hoboken. Has been my go to cafe ever since they open! My favorite is black raspberry and moose track
2020-02-02,5,Awesome local shop, all the ice cream is homemade and delicious -- cookie dough hit the spot last night. Not to mention the pizza is shockingly good, especially at $1.50 a slice. Definitely recommend!
2020-02-01,1,We wanted to try this place for the first time, so we walked 11 blocks at approximately 10pm but they were closed with a sign that said that they would be closed Mondays.  Today is Saturday :( I even checked google and yelp for their Saturday hours (they close at 11pm) and called (no one picked up, but I assumed they were busy with customers on a Saturday night.Disappointed because coffee oreo ice cream is my favorite and I heard that they have it.
2020-02-01,1,Checked Yelp and Google for hours before making the journey here.  Both claimed they're open until 11:00.  It's 10:12 and they're closed.
2019-12-22,5,Best ice cream in Hoboken by far! Great variety of flavors and all fresh and delicious. Hot chocolate is also outstanding and the service is always helpful and friendly. Also have to go pints available. Would highly recommend.
2019-11-17,5,It's the best ice cream parlour around my house. I had cookie dough, mint-choco, coffee-oreo. The staff is great, the place is nice and cosy! Must try! They also serve coffee and a few other beverages.
2019-10-07,5,We stopped in today to try the ice cream here. Joseph was very helpful and friendly! Great guy! He makes the pizza there and the coffee. I tried the cold brew. He cold brews it for 24 hours. It was delicious! I highly recommend the cold brew! It's not acidic and he has soy milk as an alternative to milk, but I got heavy cream in mine. We didn't try the pizza which is only $1! The cold brew was less than $3 which is amazing for Hoboken. It's sooo worth it!! Please try the coffee and ice cream here! We got a cone of the mint chocolate chip with chocolate sprinkles and a large bowl (three scoops) of pumpkin, Nutella, and cinnamon bun ice creams. All the ice cream is made fresh there with the highest quality ingredients. And it was less than $10!! Amazing!!! Joseph let us sample each ice cream we were interested in. Lots of delicious flavors!! Including pumpkin pie! We will definitely be returning! And I recommend Thomas's over Rita's, Cold Stone, and Ben & Jerry's!! Way better prices and quality here. :) YUMMMM. Joseph does great work and so does the owner with the ice cream! Love it!!
2019-10-06,5,Love the ice cream here! Coffee Oreo is my go-to but they have some other great homemade flavors like Pumpkin Oreo, pumpkin pie, black cherry, vanilla PB. Love supporting local businesses-esp when it's gooood ice cream!
2019-09-16,5,What a little gem!  $1 pizza that's a really good grandma pie and the ice cream is really good!  It's a must stop in and great treat.
2019-09-15,4,Really liked this place. Ice cream was really good and fairly priced for homemade/speciality. Nice feee inside and staff was very polite and took pride in their food. Pizza was an unexpected surprise. It was actually great (and only a $1.) Would definitely come back, both kids and parents approved
2019-09-11,5,Came here while walking my dog (tied her up in front seating area where she could see me--a plus especially with my anxiety prone dog!). Tried the ice cream and was very pleasantly surprised! Nice to see new local businesses popping up in Hoboken and it's great that the ice cream was so good. They also sell pizza so I'll have to come back and try it.
2019-09-07,5,This place is amazing! All the ice creams are made in house and the ones I tried so far taste delicious -- tonight tried the coffee oreo and cinnamon bun and can't wait to try other flavors!
2019-09-04,5,So excited to have a spot like this locally! The ice-cream was great--lots of different flavors. I had mint chocolate chip and my husband had cinnamon bun. We both enjoyed our flavors! Only wish--the mint was green (I generally prefer w/o food coloring). The staff was was very sweet and they let us try. Enjoy it while the weather is nice--there are several outdoor tables. Perfect for walking dogs and sitting outside while enjoying a sweet treat!
2019-08-31,5,Love this little ice cream shop! They were very friendly inside and offered us multiple tastes of different flavors. Our favorites were cinnamon bun, cookies and cream, and cookie dough. Highly recommend!
2019-08-24,5,Good ice cream! Great addition to the neighborhood.
2019-08-23,5,Replaced the former "Little Grocery" space. And the space is still awkward... but man, the ice cream is good (light years better than anything you'll get at the chain places on Washington). I had a large cup with butter Pecan, "Moose Tracks" and cookies and cream. Everything was fantastic. Generous portions, too. I'll be rooting for this place.
2019-08-15,5,Great addition to Hoboken. Best Ice Cream around by far.  Very nice staff. Looking forward to trying the pizza and other food!!  Give it a shot
