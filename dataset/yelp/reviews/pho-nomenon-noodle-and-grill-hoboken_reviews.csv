2021-11-13,5,Really good for what it is, which is very affordable food right on Washington street in Hoboken. We split the 2 Piece Shrimp Summer Rolls, which were complex for summer rolls, but not the best I've ever had. I had the Pho with Pork for my meal which was very filling and tasty! Quick service and cheap, I would go back!
2021-09-26,2,I got a vermicelli dish and it was really disappointing. Felt more like a Chinese stir fry noodle as opposed to a Vietnamese rice noodle dish.  Flavor was also lacking. Probably never ordering from here ever again.
2021-07-14,5,Don't believe the 3 stars - from the pho, to the banh mi, to the vermicelli dishes, this place packs the flavor. This is my go to Vietnamese place in hoboken. Recommended for dine in and take out.
2021-06-12,5,This place always has great food and better prices. Staff is incredibly friendly. Great for sit down or takeout.
2021-05-21,5,Great takeout! Also wonderful option for gluten free patrons. We order pho and flat noodles or beef chow fun. Consistently delicious food - thanks for being so gluten free friendly.
2021-05-15,5,Great pho and pork banh mi. Very reasonably priced and the food was so tasty. I would definitely recommend this place and am excited to try the other things on their menu.
2021-05-08,3,Mediocre vietnamese food but with limited options in Hoboken, it's good enough when craving vietnamese food.  Food is inconsistent.  Pho is solid.  The crispy fried noodles comes in a laughably small portion.  Bread for Bahn Mi sandwich didn't seem the freshest.  The rice dishes are good enough.
2021-02-13,1,I can tell why there is no one eating lunch time on weekend. Food is not so good, the restaurant is not clean, the manager is so rude, and the menu is incorrect... I like only location which is in Hoboken. That's it. I won't visit this restaurant again.
2021-02-07,3,got takeout here after spotting the sign outside their store they said banh mi!I haven't had banh mi in a while so decided to give this place a chance. It was the middle of the afternoon so no one else happened to be there.took about 10-15 minutes for our two grilled pork bann mi that cost around $17 altogether! it was not bad, i'd give it a 6/10. it just wasn't super flavorful, rather the sauce they put was really spicy for me but I don't have much spice tolerance at all. i'd probably pass on getting the banh mi again, but would want to try other options like the pho one day!
2021-01-30,5,Quality pho for the area..clean and easy. Never disappoints. Good prices and a really friendly staff. Nothing negative to report.
2021-01-12,4,Solid pho place. They're fast, affordable and the portions are great.They usually have groupons or discounts too.I get the beef pho with tendons and I love it. Not chewy. Broth is flavorful. I ask for extra onions on the side because idc about my dates when I eat here LOL.The crispy dumpling things come with for lunch special those are always good too. Lots of vegetarian options and bubble tea!
2021-01-07,5,Quaint little spot. Got lucky with parking. Prompt and polite service. Well priced. Served quickly. Simply delicious pho. Had the seafood Try it ! You'll enjoy it. Also, there was a clipboard for contact tracing. Nice touch.
2020-12-26,3,Quick delivery, authentic Vietnamese food. The pho was separated and it was hard to get it out of the container as the noodle hardened in the takeout box. It was good though once I got it! Only only little container of sauce for the pho tho :( The limes were not ripe so didn't get much flavor out of them. The egg rice was really good!! Probably my favorite. Pad Thai was also really good. Everything was really hot when it got here Good prices for everything we ordered. Would return!
2020-12-24,2,I love pho and this is the only pho place in Hoboken and its pretty good compared to the ones I grew up eating. Although the noodle soup was great, i ordered summer rolls and was in shock when I saw that rather giving full shrimps, the sliced the shrimp in half, lessening the amount of shrimp in the roll. Let me just say, the rolls were already expensive at $8 for 2 when most places charge $5 for 2 but now theyre trying to cut the amount of meat in half? I know it sounds naggy but for overpriced rolls where besides the shrimp, its basically a roll full of noodles, theres no reason to cut the amount of shrimp in the roll. Might as well pay $8 for rolls of noodles.
2020-12-20,5,Very affordable and authentic Vietnamese restaurant..they make the best banh Mi in Hoboken I would say and very friendly staff.I stop by every other week , food is fresh , no stale ingredients and always made to order.They have some lunch combos and really nice iced tea options tooI would give my YAY!!
2020-12-17,5,One of our regular go-to lunch restos in Hoboken, it is reliable: great food, friendly staff, wide-ranging menu, great value. We have our favorite dishes: calamari with a fabulous sweet chili sauce, satay with a great brown sauce, spring rolls. Their choices of Pho are superb.     This week, of course, we ordered online. Delivery was really fast, more so than expected. Food arrived hot, and it didn't disappoint. This is one of Hoboken's gems. Three year old Brandin loves it, and so do we.
2020-12-16,2,Not the cleanest place, but pho was good. It wasn't anything special, but price was good so it covered it all.
2020-11-03,1,I ordered summer rolls through Uber eats, and there was a rat poo on my order. I think this explains enough!
2020-10-25,3,Chicken Bahn Mi was almost great. Chicken seemed like it was from a pre-made store bought bag and the bread to everything else ratio was not correct. I was left with an empty roll. I'd rather you charge me $2 more to get what I want. I won't be ordering again.
2020-10-21,5,I've gotten the mixed vegetable pho twice which comes with lots of veggie and tofu. Definitely recommend getting the tofu fried if you get this dish! Really delicious. Huge portions and really filling. People who work here are very sweet.
2020-10-02,5,I have to come on and review Pho Nomenon, we have dined here several times. The pho is always delicious, and the menu has many options including other types of noodles. My husband has had the curry and loved it. The food is incredibly affordable. We dined during covid and precautions were taken, even a cute little patio. I also think they do their own delivery - skip the delivery apps.
2020-09-15,4,The pho has always been awesome. Even with take out, just microwave the soup and add noddles in, still very fresh. My husband didn't like the squid with vegetables though. Could use a bit more salt and flavor. Overall I am still very grateful to have pho in Covid.
2020-09-13,1,The food was horrible. I ordered pho, beef cubes, vermicelli, banh mi & Thai ice tea. Nothing was authentic. The Thai ice tea was watered down. The pho had a strange taste, not the worst I ever had but definitely not the best. The sesame seed beef vermicelli came with rolled up meat with onions stuffed inside. I'm Vietnamese and that's nothing I've ever seen. Beef cubes may be the only thing I could eat after I added different sauces to it cause it was super sweet.
2020-06-29,3,It's an okay vietnamese place. I wish we had more vietnamese pho places in hoboken but we don't so I usually go here or order from a place in Jersey City. I always thought they don't give enough veggies in my pho (maybe that's just my preference but usually in other pho places I don't feel that way) Their bun cha (pork on the rice) is quite good. Their sauce is very authentic sweet and savory on the rice. BYOB. They now seem to sell bubble tea as well but I haven't had it.
2020-05-15,5,Pho isn't necessarily the ideal delivery food; here they separate the ingredients from the broth to avoid sogginess. I liked the meat and broth but the best part was the hot sauce, arriving in a small packet but with a barrage of flavor, a compelling duel of spicy and sweet. Fellow sauce enthusiasts may also consider the chicken wings with garlic and fish sauce.Quick delivery via Uber Eats.
2020-03-09,2,First time delivery from Pho Nomenon Noodle and probably my last. I have a regular Vietnamese spot that I always go to but for some regrettable reason I deviated. The delivery was rather simple which included a first time order discount. My first observation was the small portions for the price paid, the rice was small, the chicken breast was cut up into small pieces and the juice cup was half the size that I am accustomed to. The spring rolls looked delicious but the bottom was soggy. This was the first time I was served spring rolls without a lettuce wrap. The noodles we ordered had a tasty flavoring but just too greasy and stuck together.It was a nice try but will stick to my regular pho spot.
2020-01-25,1,This restaurant's food really sucks. Pho soup is a little bit fishy and the noodle has weird taste. I would never go to this restaurant again.
2020-01-08,5,This is honestly an OK place. Yes the Pho can be a bit more authentic, and the service can be a bit faster. But you get a sub $10 lunch with so many menu choices! I am just glad that we have a Pho place here instead of another bar or pizza joint.
2019-12-04,5,Super confused about all the bad reviews because this place makes magic pho. I order the regular all the time, it's by far the best in Hoboken. I am convinced their original pho  can fix all my problems, especially a cold!
2019-11-15,4,The atmosphere in here is super cute and the restaurant is really quiant. I got a Tom Yum Soup, to be vegetarian broth with noodles, tofu, and vegetables and veggie potstickers. The service was great and really attentive. The food was delicious, very much recommend going and would probably dine here again or go straight for the take out.The only thing that caught me a little off-guard was if you requested for any customization or extra it was immediately a $2 extra charge. I spent almost $20 on pho!
2019-10-30,2,I got pho here service is ok but food was flavorless. The meats also old smell like in refrige more then 2 weeks. It means not fresh at all.
2019-10-26,3,Start with the grilled pork chops, fried rolls,  and pho here.  The pho with various beef is good as are the versions with grilled chicken or pork. If you've ever enjoyed pho before, be warned that this spot serves the skimpiest pho that you will have ever had. The bowls are smaller than what you find in any other place and a key ingredient, the meat provided is sparse. Compared to normal pho, you can consider this the lite or petite version. For portions that are more standard and not as miserly, try pho a mile down in Jersey City or in Chinatown.  Otherwise, 4 stars if they ever get their act together and not be so miserly with the pho.
2019-10-25,1,Not an authentic Vietnamese restaurant, it's more Chinese/Asian fusion. Barely any pho options on the menu. I got the veggie "pho". It was completely flavorless. Just a bowl of hot water with veggies and noodles. Had a funny taste. The only thing that was good was the Thai iced tea.
2019-09-25,5,I love this place!  One of the best kept secrets.  So many people think It's just Vietnamese food but they really do have a variety.   My kids love the chicken and rice dishes and I love the PHO!
2019-09-21,3,This is usually a hit or miss. The food quality varies a lot- sometimes the broth is too sweet. But since it's the only place in Hoboken that offers pho, there's not really an option when you're in the mood.
2019-06-30,2,As a big fan of vietnamese food I really wanted to like this place, sadly it does not meet the standards. First of all portions are really small, what would be ok if the food was mind blowing. Unfortunately food was pathetic as well. We ordered fried calamari, meatball pho, and beef cubes (bo luc lac). Calamari were just ready made and deep fried nothing worth $9. Pho was below any expectations, broth did not have any taste, what is more the amount was so less that it got soaked by noodles. Beef cubes were just tossed with soy sauce which made them unbearably salty. Service was just ok. All things considered I will avoid this place at all cost. There are better options for Vietnamese food in Jersey City including my favorite ''new tanh hoai''.
2019-06-22,4,Really loved this place when we came in to eat! They had really good pho  and make a pretty good bahn mi The only thing we weren't crazy for was the take-out. The noodles got stuck to the paper container so it was kind of tough to get it out. Definitely a great Vietnamese spot in Hoboken!!
2019-05-19,1,Can I give this restaurant zero stars? Absolutely poor customer service!!! Do you value your customers? Do you even know what customer service is? No, is the answer and I can answer that. I called in for my order and the lady on the phone scold me and was completely rude. I refuse to eat this garbage even if you paid me. I refuse to eat food served from an establishment with bad vibe and bad energy. You guys should be awarded the most nasty customer service award. The pro is that you guys are the only pho restaurant in Hoboken. Good luck with your business serving pho and extra poor customer service. Package deal!
2019-04-17,3,The service was attentive. The food was subpar. The atmosphere is very casual. The interior is interesting. Overall, a good place for a quick bite but not really a go to place for Vietnamese food or for a good meal. Not bad but not impressive. If they worked on the food quality and  renovated the dining room, it would be a place worth coming to but overall, don't come with high expectations. I ordered the A1 crispy spring rolls which traditionally comes with enough lettuce for each roll but there was barely enough for two.
2019-03-22,1,Worst customer service, and extremely rude manager. It was my friends first time having Pho and I really wanted her to have a good experience. My friend order beef Pho which came with a spring roll. After taking a bite of it I noticed the texture and double checked with the manager to make sure there was no meat in the spring roll. The manager said the roll had pork in it, but my friend and I cannot eat pork due to a dietary/religious restrictions. My friend stated this to the manager and the she said there's nothing she can do about it. My friend then asked if they had other spring rolls and if she could get a vegetarian spring roll. The manager snapped and said she'd have to pay for it as the lunch special only comes with the pork spring roll. I do not understand why in this day and age a menu does not specify ingredients for a spring roll, and FYI a spring roll is completely different from a pork roll. Please update your menus. Also, the Pho was extremely bland and tasted like water. We should've known this place would be terrible when all the tables were empty.
2019-03-14,2,OMG, go else where unless you are seriously desperate. The female manager or owner did not bother to smile at all, not even once. She totally did not care what we ordered and if we liked the food or not. At least the service guy bringing out the food was friendly. Now for the food. Mediocre at best. What other reviewers said was right. Chinese version of Vietnamese food. For sure never going back.
2019-03-14,3,Stumbled across this place on a rainy snowy afternoon which seemed like a perfect day for some pho! Tried their chicken pho in vegetables broth which was good. And the curry rau was very flavourful. They have quite some options for vegetarian. Ambiance could be improved. It was pretty dull when we entered but pretty decent place.
2019-02-19,4,What more could you wish for on a snow day that hot yummy food delivered right to your door? The correct answer is: nothing. With both me and my roommate unwilling to venture outdoors for food nor willing to cook it ourselves, we decided Vietnamese food was the way to go. If you, like me and my guess would be most people, have only ever come her for pho, you're missing out! I can wholeheartedly vouch for their pho, I've had it time and time again and it is tasty and reliable. But I wasn't in the mood for a soup, so I looked through the rest of their surprisingly vast menu and found Basil Creation. Was I mocked by my roommate when I told her that was my order? Do I wish they had a less weird name for this dish? Was it delicious?! Yep to it all. Basil Creation is a stir fry with chicken, zucchini, peppers, onions and maybe more. It was delicious. And will definitely be one of my new go to dishes. The portion was a really decent size, not enough for left overs, but still a hearty portion. Delivery was pretty much exactly on time, even in the snow. Two very full and happy thumbs up.
2019-02-09,3,Ordered delivery from here the other day since I wanted to try something different.  I always see Pho on tv and I will admit I am no expert but it always looks good. I ordered the standard beef pho with the broth. I really enjoyed the broth and it was still hot when it came to my apartment. I added the beef and noodles and everything worked pretty well. The noodles tasted like ramen but I liked the overall dish.I also had the vietnamese spring rolls. They had a crunchy outside and a meaty inside. It was a solid appetizer and some of the better spring rolls I have had. I also tried the lettuce wraps with the chicken mixture. I think it needed a little more flavor and spice to be a home run but it was serviceable. Heres where the review goes south. I waited 1.5 hours for delivery. It wasnt even a busy time to order but it took so long to come. In the end it was a good meal even though I waited a while. I probably have to keep it in the 3 star range.
2019-01-29,1,This review is based on customer service. Long story short: My order today was missing the extra broth I ordered and the sesame chicken was completely spilled into the bag covering everything else in sauce and dripping all over my house. I called to ask for a refund and was treated very poorly by the manager. She demanded I text photographs and then told me "why are you bothering me, go ask seamless for your refund." I ordered from here because I generally do like their pho and especially the meatballs. I've had better and fancier versions but also have had worse and there are no other options that deliver to my house. Today I ordered pho and sesame chicken and when it arrived I realized that they had not only forgotten my side of extra broth but also had failed to close the lid of the sesame chicken and it had spilled all over everything else in the bag. The bag was completely full of sauce and dripping everywhere, all over my house. I called the restaurant and they demanded I text photos to them, so I did and then I proceeded to throw away the bag to stop it from making even more of a mess of my kitchen. First she calls me back after just having hung up, not even allowing me to finish taking photos and says "where are the text messages I haven't gotten them yet" then after I do send the photos they demand that I allow their driver to come back and pick up the bag that was making a mess of my house and refuse to give me a refund without the bag; something they never told me about. When I tell them this the woman on the phone tells me that it isn't their problem, says she will report me for refusing their methods and tells me stop bothering her and to go call seamless. I generally do not care enough to write any kind of review - good or bad but this was terrible customer service. Luckily seamless did give me a refund on the items but this was definitely a restaurant error, not a seamless one.
2018-12-31,5,Every time we go here we are very happy. The food is always delicious and the service is pleasant. The summer rolls with shrimp or grilled pork are amazing. The ginger chicken is also really good and uses fresh ginger. The pho is of course stellar as well. They serve complimentary tea and the fresh coconut drink is a treat. Definitely one of our favorite spots in Hoboken. Note because I see it mentioned in other reviews: they will give jalapeños if you ask!!!
2018-12-29,3,Wouldn't come back. More Chinese style than Vietnamese. Had the lemongrass beef spring roll bun vermicelli bowl. More like a stir fry. And vermicelli were thick, not thin like usual.Ok. But didn't satisfy my craving for a good Vietnamese dish.
2018-12-11,3,Meh. The pho was fine but lacking in both meat and flavor. It hit the spot on a cold day (and it was nice to receive hot tea upon being seated), but the food just wasn't good enough to come back here. The service was also underwhelming - fine, but not super friendly.
2018-10-07,5,This place is so good, the gf and I come here all the time!  The pork spring rolls are so great and all the Pho is good especially grilled pork & brisket mix!
2018-09-09,3,Stopped in for a quick bite for dinner on Saturday night. They weren't that busy and we were quickly seated at a table for two by the front window. We ordered the Pho Nomenon Noodle soup and a Grilled sliced pork Banh Mi sandwich. The sandwich was ok but just a little spicy for me. My fiancé had the Pho and he enjoyed it. He said it wasn't the best he's had but it was good. It has eye round steak, brisket, tendon, and tripe. The service was very good and the staff very friendly. It's a nice place to try if you're in the area.
2018-08-02,3,Here's a tip; if the Pho restaurant also serves Tom Yum Soup and other Asian dishes, it's not authentic. This place is owned and operated by Non-Vietnamese folks and this is translated into the food. The pho is bland and lacks aroma.  The broth is cloudy and quantity is small for 8.50 a bowl.  There is a small amount of basil and sprouts and no jalepenos. Service is fine although rushed and the decor is nice for a pho house.  I stopped by becuase it was close to the W hotel but I wouldn't go back.
2018-07-31,3,As some of you might know by now, I am always in search of a good Pho experience as I travel around the globe. In this case there isn't much Phonemena in the Pho. The overall experience is average. The chicken Pho I ordered comes with all the ingredients, except jalapeños. The portion is OK for its price, considering it's NY, although there are places in Chinatown where either the portion is larger or the price is lower and the taste is better. What disappoints the most is the quality of the broth, in all "The most important ingredient" of the noodle soup... it's watery , very watery, almost no flavor, too bad because if it wasn't for that MAJOR error this meal could easily deserve 4 stars. The service is good and the people are nice. Too bad, my advice: Until they boost the broth flavor... just use enough Sriracha and other flavor creators hehe.
2018-06-18,2,Did not like how the spring rolls were sweet. It's good price wise but the pho was not alot of noodles or meat at all.
2018-05-20,1,Had lunch with friends here. Terrible food and service. The food are not fresh and  the food is terrible. Will never come back.
2018-05-20,2,Ordered p8 pho and minced pork rice. The pho was slightly above average but not by much. The soup was very good but the noodles were stale and the meat tasted old. Minced pork rice was literally the worst dish my wife has ever eaten. Usually I give the benefit of the doubt to the restaurant but I'm with 2 friends and they equally hate the dishes here. Come here for the pho (or not) and make sure not to order any other dishes.
2018-05-20,4,I would say it's pretty good Pho in this town. Of course you cannot compare to the pho in California. But I would say it's good enough for me to satisfy my desire for pho sometimes in this small Hoboken. Restaurant is clean. Price is average. Service is good. You basically can find everything you want from noodles, rice, coffee... etc in Vietnamese food here. I am glad we have this one in Hoboken.
2018-05-12,3,Went here because it was close by when stayed at the W. The rolls, pho, and banh mi were all just okay. I don't know what it is about it, but everything tasted bland.
2018-05-10,1,Unless you absolutely need a fix and can't drive don't come here. They are cheap with key ingredients. The pho is fine in terms of lots of noodles/ broth but they will give you barely any herbs or jalapeños and if you ask they will charge you extra.
2018-04-24,1,Horrible attitude from the waitress there. Food is ok. Not recommended. You might have a different experience with a different waitress. But there are definitely better options for Vietnam restaurant.
2018-04-09,1,I wouldn't order from here again. The food didn't seem very fresh. There wasn't much chicken in the broth and the consistency was weird. The broth was ok but the little bag of sprouts, onion and lime seemed a little gross and smelled weird. They also didn't include jalapeños. Disappointed.
2018-03-20,1,Horrible horrible experience tonight with the staff, manager and delivery. Still waiting almost 2 hours for a delivery. They indicated only one driver on but neglected to share that when ordering. When calling to check on order I was put on hold numerous times, and their only solution was that I can cancel my order (now close to two hours later). Manager ends up getting on phone and states they will give a discount next time I order as her solution and then hangs up on me. That "next time I order" will never happen.
2018-02-27,1,If I could give 0 stars I would. The customer service here is horrendous. I ordered a B3 lemongrass beef with spring roll vermicelli noodles and extra vegetables expecting it to be a traditional, commonly known Vietnamese dish. Instead I got Chinese mixed vegetables in oyster sauce dumped on top of vermicelli noodles. I called in to ask for a replacement/refund but they refused because "they can't resell it" Great business model. I was then told that I was the one who ordered incorrectly, and that the dish is a "stir fry." Since when did Vietnamese vermicelli dishes have Chinese stir fry on it? I just wanted some extra lettuce and bean sprouts. She then proceeded to tell me to "just take the vegetables off" and was unwilling to compromise. I've never had such a horrible experience at a restaurant before. They can't even call themselves a Vietnamese restaurant. Definitely lost a loyal customer who has been ordering for 2 years. Don't waste your time or money on this place.
2018-02-10,4,First time eating here and I had it delivered. Best quality delivery I ever had. Food was packed great and came with every single condiment you'd get if you dined in (I assume).  Broth was super flavorful but could've been slightly hotter. I would order her agsin despite the high delivery min. Maybe I'll troop outside and eat there one day lol
2018-02-09,3,If you are looking for something to barely hit the spot for a pho craving, I would go here. The pho wasn't anything to write home about. The brother was very light and almost tasted watered down. The noodle or meat ration was extremely off (heavily favoring noodles), so be prepared to ask for extra pieces of meat just to balance out your bowl. I did try a pork bahn mi, which was actually very good. They give you A LOT of meat and the veggies were also very good. I would only come here for the bahn mi.
2018-02-04,5,This place has been a favorite of ours since it opened.  The lunch sandwiches are amazing, particularly the sliced beef.  We've always loved the ramen.  Every once in awhile I break away and try something new and am never disappointed.  This time it was the BBQ special with beef.  A simple dish, perfectly done.  Keep up the pho-nominal work!
2018-02-01,5,My go to for trying out new pho places is getting the summer rolls, pho, and the banh mi. Was I drinking the night before? Perhaps. Take this review as someone who may have been looking for some sweet sweet broth to regain that brain strength. Pho with meatballs meets my criteria of decent pho at a decent price. It's not super memorable but this place is great for an emergency pho meal. The summer roll with shrimp is also delicious where the shrimp and veggies tastes super fresh. I love leaving the best for last so on to the banh mi: outstanding. The baguette along with the flavors from the sauce they use really is what makes a banh mi. I wish I can replace every sandwich place with banh mi. Like I said, my review may be skewed by my state of mind but just go in if you are craving some awesome banh mi and quick service.
2018-01-19,2,The pho broth was VERY DILUTED! It didn't even tasted like pho broth at all. My friends had to put hoisin sauce in it to make it taste better. Other dishes were good. I got the spring roll and lettuce wrap which were decent. Never coming back for pho.
2018-01-11,4,Best pho I've ever had. Generous portion with all the essentials to make a spicy and sinus clearing pho.
2018-01-01,1,Updated review - I used to like this place - they refuse to give more than 1 hoisin sauce - put delivery and take out orders on the floor - mean service - so many better places in jersey city and the city - not worth it
2017-12-30,5,Had a quick lunch here before got on the bus. It was a clean and tiny pho restaurant, and my friends and I both chose the pho that included all toppings, which were raw and well cooked beef and brisket. It was served with fresh green sprouts and lime. The pho tasted delicious, and the service was good and quick.
2017-12-15,2,I was really excited when Phonomenon opened a few years ago simply because you couldn't get pho in Hoboken. Unfortunately, their pho just isn't that good. I've had it 4-5 times over the years and each time it's equally underwhelming. Additionally, it's light on the meat. For those in Hoboken, head over to Jersey City or NYC when you're craving pho. Fingers crossed that a better spot comes to town!
2017-12-08,3,I love Vietnamese food and have traveled to Vietnam several times. This pho place was pretty good in flavor compared to other pho places I've tried. However, they didn't provide condiments that are usually offered with meals. The spring rolls, which were pretty pricey at 6.95 for 4 rolls, didn't come with cilantro. The pho also didn't come with jalapeños. I also felt they could've filled the bowl up with more broth. I appreciate places that fill the bowl as full as they can. Overall though, the flavor was pretty good.
2017-12-07,4,Good here is sooo good!  I am in town on a business trip and I've eaten here 3 times in a week!  The Banh Mi and the pineapple fried rice have been my go-to menu items!  Sooooo good!  My co-workers had the PHO and really like it.  I will definitely come again next time I have to visit my Hoboken office!!
2017-11-10,5,Pho the most part, these guys do a great job all the time. Other than the sometimes undercooked rice noodle, everything is always bursting with flavor. Spring Rolls and Imperial Rolls are a must order, and the eye round steak pho is always on point. This place is pho-king good, especially for this area!
2017-11-01,3,Pho Nomenon is not the best Vietnamese food you'll ever have in the NYC/NJ area. I wasn't expecting it to be. What I was expecting was my go to for a hangover cure - a steaming hot bowl of pho, and it did the trick. The broth could have been hotter but overall, I was pretty happy with my decision to try this place out. My boyfriend and I came around 3 pm on a Saturday and there weren't many people dining - probably because it was a weird hour, and it was also the Saturday before Halloween so people were probably busy prepping for their parties that night. We also tried the banh mi, which was okay. Like I mentioned, it's not the best Viet food but it is the only option in Hoboken so I'll definitely hit up this spot next time the craving for Vietnamese (or next time a hangover) hits.Tip - don't sit outside. Service is very limited.
2017-10-17,5,I eat lunch here about once a week.  Always great flavor with the sliced pork. Lunch special comes with an egg roll.  Great place for lunch, convenient to the college and middle of Washington st.
2017-10-12,5,Great service and amazing food! Everything was super fresh and good. They were prompt
2017-10-05,3,More like a three and a half--this was definitely the best Vietnamese meal I've had in town. Except, there's only one in all of Hoboken. However, the food was surprisingly decent-the banh mi especially. I strongly recommend if you're looking for something new in town, but if you think you could do better, NYC is right there.
2017-09-30,2,Food was decent. Pho ga had cinnamon in it which was strange. But the reason I was even compelled to write a review in the first place was due to the treatment I received from the lady who presumably owns this place. She was SO rude to me. On the phone and in person. I am a very nice, polite girl and she was so mean to me for no reason - it actually disturbed me to the point that I felt it necessary to warn others about how awful it was just to interact with her. She snapped at me so many times in response to what were basic menu and restaurant questions. I will never return because she left such a bad taste in my mouth, pun intended. Truly horrible customer service. It's your customers who keep you in business, you should learn how treat them with courtesy and respect.
2017-09-14,5,How this place doesn't have a solid five stars is absolutely beyond my imagination. The only pho place in Hoboken! So tasty and reliable. Food comes out fast and piping hot. And the meat is flavored **incredibly** and the portions are generous. The banh mi- oh my God. Just please try it. It's so good. And when I order delivery everything is so quick. I've never had to wait! There isn't some in-depth ambiance here. No black bow tied waiters. But the people who work the register are friendly and they remember what you order. Outside of frills (if you need them) this is the perfect tasty lunch spot. Thanks for your consistent quality food and bringing something unique to town!!
2017-09-11,4,Being the only pho I've found in the area, it's my go-to when the craving strikes. Their pho is pretty tasty! I've also ordered delivery several times and it is just as good as it was in the restaurant. The delivery has always been really fast too!
2017-09-10,5,Pho n satay n chicken salad n pineapple rice were all mouthwatering !!! Surprised to their low rating!?!
2017-08-21,4,Not bad for pho! I don't like their meat too much so I opt for tofu but the broth is yummy! I love their summer rolls and their papaya salad as well on days when I want to eat lighter. Service is ok. Not the absolute best but I go in here when I want a quick bite to eat not when I'm looking to be showered with attention. The workers who all look like they stepped out of a K-pop band are always playing on their phones and it's difficult to get them to snap out of it. Overall a pretty pleasant experience just don't expect to have anyone be 100% attentive to you. They are too busy playing candy crush.
2017-08-18,1,I don't usually give one star to a restaurant, but this one suck so bad at all the things we ordered. Let's start with the pro.Pro: Convenient location Con:Worst pho ever - I had pho from many places in USA and aboard in Asia. This pho tasted likediluted msg water with those pho cube you get at Asian market. There is difference between not enough flavor and just plain msg water. Worst Thai ice tea ever - Just water with maybe tea powder and sugar?! In fact, I don't even know what this is. Worst rice dish ever - Maybe rice with some yesterday chicken and diluted msg water with some curry sauce thickened with corn starch.
2017-08-08,4,Love this place as a take out options. The pho is great and the vietnamese pork summer rolls are fantastic. Delivery is always super quick and everything comes super hot. Everything is sort of packaged individually so we usually throw it in a pot on the stove before serving. Tip: order extra broth this way when you reheat the next day you have some. If not you are usually just left with some bean sprouts for leftovers!
2017-08-03,5,LOVE this place!  The food is incredible and very well priced.  There are a good amount of options for vegetarians or vegans, and even more for meat eaters.  My favorite veggie options are the mixed vegetable noodle soup and the vegetable pan fried pot stickers!  The woman who is always there I am guessing is the owner is not the most friendly but not unfriendly either.  The waiters are really nice. Highchair available. Def recommend!
2017-07-29,4,Still good still pho soup, still the same people and still got what it takes to succeed in Hoboken. Got the lemongrass chicken pho and it definitely hot the spot.....
2017-07-23,2,Dreck! Noodles turn to mush in moments. Broth like cardboard soup. Too much tripe. Spring rolls dripping cold oil and grease. Go to New Than Hoai in Jersey City instead. If you have to eat in Hoboken, you'd be better off at McDonald's.
2017-07-18,4,Stopped in a couple weeks ago after getting out of work late. They were sweeping and chairs were stacked on the table so we assumed they were closing but they insisted we come in. They quickly got our order and the food came out in about 3-4 min! The service was fine, certainly adequate. The food was actually quite tasty! I loved the chicken mixture that went with the lettuce wraps. I am not sure if I'd go back since I have many more spots to try, but overall I enjoyed my dinner.
2017-07-18,5,Really good fresh options, love the grilled chicken on rice noodles and beef satay!
2017-07-12,2,Becareful if u order noodle soup together with rice. Lid doesn't cover good. Half of bottle soup gone.soup sprinkle all over
2017-06-12,3,My go to spot for my Pho cravings. It isn't nothing special but does the job for your cravings. I always try to get the clear broth with a side of meat because I hate chunks of fat that comes with their regular broth.
2017-05-30,2,Don't go here for Pho. The worst I've had. The broth was tasteless and had like 2 leaves of cilantro and they gave the sprouts separate with a few mint leaves. The meat was pasable but nothing great. I had to keep putting hoisin sauce in it to give it some flavor. Ended up just eating the meat and some noodles. What a mood killer on a rainy day. The lettuce wraps were good.
2017-05-18,4,Visited this noodle spot a few times and while the colder days seem behind us, on chilly days their vegetarian pho soup hit the spot.  Always had a table available on the various times I've frequented.  The staff is young and swift, ready to take your order, or suggest items if you're unsure of what to try.I could tell it was a good pho spot because of the clientele, almost everyone was a pho lover and you can see in the way they devoured their meals, that this was it.  It is hard to find a good pho place outside of NYC, yet this one isn't too far from my place and I was happy when I found it.I've taken several friends and they all love it.  Always getting one of their pho options, and of course tried a few of their appetizers which are spot on.Look forward to trying something cooler during the summer months, when I'm in the area.
2017-05-01,3,Came in after attending CPAC 2017 at the Stevens Institute. My sister ordered the Crispy Shrimp, which was anything but thanks to drowning in sauce. I got the Pho Nomenon, which was standard, and Pork Meatballs over Vermicelli, which was above par. Place itself was fine, clean and all, and after a day of walking around, I was just really grateful that the waiter kept refilling our waters.Between three people, the check came to under $70.
2017-05-01,5,Pretty small place but you just can't beat the freshness of this food. My friend and I ordered a beef dish and a soup and the food came right away-like an amazing 15 minutes flat. I ordered the vegetable pho soup and it lives on as one of the best soups I've ever had. Highly recommend this dish if vegan/vegetarian!
2017-05-01,1,Thought I found a place outside of Manhattan to have good Vietnamese food. The first couple of times there was ok. Lately it's been really terrible. I used to get the grilled pork chop over rice, I won't get it anymore. It has no flavor, and has the texture of jerky. Not juicy and marinated like it's suppose to be. The fish sauce is also way too sour. The only thing good there are the spring rolls.
2017-04-30,1,THE WORST Pho I've ever (had) seen. Just picked up an order of soup to go. 1) I should've checked the bag (specifically asked an employee if there were chopsticks in there. No chopsticks, no spoon(!!) 2) 1/3 of the broth is FAT. See for yourself. 3) It has 3(!!) thin slices of eye round, and 2 EXTRA FAT SLABS. INEDIBLE (quite literally, since there's no spoon). Thanks People.
2017-04-21,5,Nice place to have lunch or dinner, the taste and price are all nice! I like the beef pho best!
2017-03-23,1,BAD & UNFRIENDLY SERVICE from Maitre d on a Friday lunchbreak. She had an attitude & didn't want to help people.
2017-03-14,5,I'm not one to write reviews but this place literally had the best service and authentic food I've experienced in awhile.  Food came out so quickly, I was asked multiple times if I needed anything, was not rushed at all and my drink was refilled without my even asking.  The food was also so flavorful and the tea as soon as I sat down was a nice touch!
2017-03-11,3,Okay, I'm upping my star rating. I came back tonight and the pho I had was much more fitting for the price and the taste was good. Service was also very quick.
2017-02-24,5,A place I go to once a week, I had never even heard of pho before moving to the neighborhood.  A fusion of French and South East Asian cuisine, it is delectable.  The atmosphere is quaint, and the staff very friendly and attentive.  The price doesn't change for lunch and dinner, but it's the same portion size regardless, so I'm okay with that. I know going in I'm going to get value, be it on quantity for lunch or quality at a low price for dinner.
2017-02-20,1,Bad ! How can you mess up Pho ????? Save your money and order from New Thanh Hoai @ JC.
2016-12-31,5,Best vegetable pho I've had. I usually take the one with the beef stock but the portion, the vegetables' freshness and the condiments make it a reliable lunch option during fall, winter and the spring for me. I can't wait to try out the cold banh mi and Vietnamese salads soon.
2016-12-30,4,BYOB. If you're craving pho, it's worth going here! Service is decent- quick refills on the tea, but no ice with your water.  Pho is pretty good, I always enjoy it! The spring rolls, summer rolls and lettuce wraps are all tasty.
2016-12-15,5,I need Pho at least once a week. This is my spot. Great food,  good prices, nice staff. Eat in is pleasent. Order delivery is prompt. These are good people making good food. I will be back many times i am sure.
2016-12-09,1,Ordered in Yelp, they over overcharged me more than what I paid for! They also have given me the wrong food! WTF! 2nd time they did this. Will never order from here again!
2016-12-07,4,So glad I stopped in! Tried the roast pork noodle soup and was surprised to find it one of the better versions I've tried. The broth seems to go deeper than others, with a velvety richness that remained constant from beginning to end, the pork expertly seasoned for an umami blast. The shrimp summer rolls were also excellent, though I do think they should be $1-2 cheaper. My friend had the beef & broccoli dish, and said he would order it again. Not sure about the lack of stars in the ratings. The service can be a little abrupt but that's a minor nuisance. It was attentive, however. Looking forward to a return visit!
2016-11-14,1,My first and last time coming here.  My boyfriend said he wanted to try new places. So I gave it a shot. I don't wanna write too much so to make a long story short the Pho my boyfriend had was bland and over priced. I ordered the grilled chicken on rice. After 3 bites I discovered a piece of hair on my rice! So I asked politely to exchange it for me. Couldn't even finish it anyway because the chicken was bland and I lost my appetite. Comes time to ask for the check the Manager lady rolled her eyes at us and puts the check on the table and walks away--but thanks the table next to us with a smile! Smh. Comes back to take the payment and not a thank you out of her mouth. Worst experience at a restaurant. Ever. The rudeness was unnecessary. We could of been rude too but chose not to be. Never coming back.
2016-11-08,1,Very bad experience this time. We've been to this place before. The food was decent at the first time we were there. But this time we came with 3 people and ordered the lunch specials. One of the dish came wrong, so they changed the item. One of the dish which was thin pork chop over rice, it was so tiny, definitely not worth $8.25. The food was just soso, didn't taste like Vietnamese food. It was a bad experience at all! Before we left, the owner/ manager complained about the tips in Chinese when we were still there. Very rude.
2016-11-03,5,I love this place!!  The Spicy Basil Chicken is amazing!  The atmosphere is nice as are the employees.
2016-09-17,4,A really good spot for my to get comfort food. Their Thai iced tea def satisfies my cravings! The interior could use some more decor but the food is awesome.
2016-09-16,3,Absolutely love the chicken summer rolls and peanut sauce. They are a perfect food that will fill you up and not leave you feeling weighed down after.The physical restaurant location is nothing special, but is a nice place to have a casual meal out.Definitely recommend!UPDATE: While I recommend the food, the delivery service is absolutely terrible and takes much longer than the max estimate.
2016-09-03,5,Went with my bro for lunch right when they opened...I just had the urge to eat good early....we went with the phó of course..like duh! Lol....first customers their as soon as they opened and I'd say not even ten minutes our soup was ready...the soup was on point, added extra sriracha hot sauce for that kick.....big bowl, plenty of everything with noodles...and for 8$ and change you can't go wrong!! Phó nomenon indeed!
2016-08-14,1,Terrible food.  Figured that, as the sole Vietnamese restaurant in Hoboken, it would have at least halfway decent food.  I was disappointingly wrong.  The bahn mi traditional was boring, virtually tasteless, had little meat with a parade of julienned carrots, but worst of all was on some budget Italian style bread.  You could tell the restaurant has no respect for themselves or their food.  My girlfriend had the vermicelli chicken, which I did not try.  But she indicated the chicken was dark meat and chewy and the vermicelli was extremely overcooked to the point of its nearly liquefying in the bowl.  The only redeeming thing about the place was that the waitresses were very nice.  But  you don't visit a restaurant because the people are nice.  You visit it for the food.  It was bad, full stop.
2016-08-02,1,Even though they have the best beef sandwich around, I shall never give them my business again. The girl packed a lemongrass shrimp to-go order in a flimsy styrofoam container and it spilled everywhere. I called and spoke to her and asked for a credit and suggested they pack take out orders like everyone else in 2016 in the airtight plastic containers with the black bottoms. She flatly refused and said she could only give me a dollar off my next visit. She also said "We've never had that happen" to which, I replied it was all the more reason she should give me a credit considering it's only happened once.She again refused and accused me of "holding it wrong." As if I was born yesterday. I told her I was in there all the time and if she didn't do the right thing I would never give them business again.She still refused then hung up on me.Not sure if it's a cultural thing, as many Chinese restaurants don't care about their customers, either, but this one definitely lost my biz forever... over an $8 lunch. Pity. Saynora, Pho Nomenon.
2016-06-30,5,I'm not sure why this place has bad reviews but it's pretty BANGING. I got the grilled pork banh mi sandwiches and it was amazing. Everyone elses order was pretty good. The pad Thai smelled a little off putting but it was still delicious. Not sure what is was, but the thinly sliced beef and vegetables with rice was so tender. Delicious. My mom and brother were practically eating my sandwich the entire time.
2016-06-24,4,Phonomenon is hands down better than New Thanh Hoai. It's cleaner, friendlier service and better food! Love their pho, bahn mi and pineapple chicken fried rice. I'd come here more often if it was easier to find parking!
2016-06-13,1,The customer service is awful and the food is underwhelming. I've given them a few chances and my friend convinced me to try one more time. Do not get delivered the wrong item because they will expect you to return the half eaten bits of food because the chef can't remember what he cooked for you. Disgusting service and a manager who hung up on me. Classy joint.
2016-06-04,5,I absolutely adore this place.  All the noodle soups are delicious and the portions are good.  Service here is quick and everyone is very friendly.
2016-05-24,4,Holy cow, amazing lettuce wraps and green curry. Our friends introduced those to us, we usually get the pho and grilled porkchops which are pretty good. But those 2 are awesome. Also BYOB so always nice. :) Nice staff, bubble tea.
2016-05-14,5,This place is the best! Only vietnamese place in town, though that doesn't mean they wouldn't be the best if they weren't. Plus, the service is IMPECCABLE. 5 stars every time. Get the shrimp spring rolls.
2016-05-04,4,I've been here a few times for pho before I actually tried much else on the menu. The pho I thought was average - it was good, but I've also had better. Granted it's the only pho place I know of in Hoboken. I was very pleasantly surprised by their Asian Spicy Chicken with mixed vegetables, though. It was very well cooked and super tasty. The texture of the chicken was very tender and the veggies had a nice crunch to them rather than being mushy and unappetizing. I really enjoyed that dish - it was similar to something you'd get at a Chinese restaurant, but cooked way better than most places. On point.One thing I was pretty disappointed about was their Vietnamese spring rolls. They have a very strange texture - the wrap is sort of thick and chewy/doughy rather than thin and crisp. I was not a fan.The service is good here. They're fast and efficient, getting your food to you quickly. They're friendly and pretty attentive to your needs. No nonsense. Although, I think the kid serving us may have forgotten about our spring rolls at first... Other than that though, pretty good.Pleasant, casual, moderately quiet. It's nice, not a hole in the wall by any means, but I've worn sweatpants here without receiving any judgmental looks, too.Tldr; pretty good place, check out their other items on the menu other than pho, skip the spring rolls :)
2016-05-03,1,This was my second time ordering fromHere. And my last. There was a total of 3 slices of meat in my pho. And the broth tasted watered down. Worst pho I have ever eaten. Shame too because I liked this place enough the first time I had ordered, but 3 pieces of meat is just ridiculous. See picture.
2016-05-02,4,We ordered Pho Nomenon noodle soup and Banh Mi. Everything was great. Very good service.
2016-04-26,4,I'm always apprehensive when it comes to trying Vietnamese places because I'm Vietnamese and mama's homemade cooking is always best.    Compared to thanh houai in downtown Jersey City, it's definitely 5 times better. The food is way fresher. You can tell the pho is tastier because the aroma is more potent. They're a little stingy on the meat though. My other favorite dish from there is the grilled pork with flat noodles. It's so good. The only thing they need is a dessert menu. Did I mention this was BYOB as well?!     The place is small but cute. The people are friendly and the service is great. You can't beat the price either.
2016-04-12,5,I eat here at least once a week. I love the Pho. They best in the area.  Service is super quick! The food is wonderful! So many options. Love love this place
2016-03-28,2,The location is great, but unfortunately, that's the only thing going for this place.  We ordered Banh Mi (Vietnamese sub) and Vietnamese Iced coffee this past week.  Bread was really cheap and doughy + the pate wasn't really pate.  More like some sort of dry red meat jam?  We tossed half the sandwich to save space for some real food elsewhere.  Coffee was ok.  We may come back to try the Pho one day, but I think Jersey City is a safer bet.
2016-02-16,1,It was the 1 degree weekend in February 2016 and my friend visiting from San Francisco was battling the flu. I just needed some tasty broth for this girl and thought Pho Nomenon was up to the challenge. Well, I at least hoped they were up to the challenge. We ordered the mixed vegetable noodle soup (beef broth), pho ga (chicken) noodle soup (clear broth), chow mei fun amoy style and two Thai iced teas. Everything was mediocre. The noodles that came with the soup were not done.  Both the clear and beef broths are seriously lacking in flavor.  I had to add salt to my soup.  The vegetables in the soup were whatever - they existed with no impact.  The chicken was flavorless. And the Thai iced teas were just okay. The chow mei fun was slightly better than the soups and I ended up throwing away the soups and we ate just the noodles.  Fast and nice service, but the food is just bland.
2016-02-06,3,this place is small and cute. the waitresses seemed nice. I haven't been to a Vietnamese place really before but this was a good experience. I got a general taste for what to expect. It was a quiet atmosphere which is nice sometimes. The price of the food is reasonable but a little  bit on the cheaper side. you get a good amount of food for the price.
2016-01-13,3,Had lunch this afternoon.  Ordered the potstickers and Pho Ga.  The potstickers were ok. The Pho broth was a bit bland compared to what I've had in the past elsewhere. Friendly folks, mediocre Pho.
2016-01-13,4,Alright, I LOVE their pho, for a local close to home Vietnamese option look no further. I can't really attest to any other dishes, I've only tried their pho me I love it. (Repeat offender here) I usually always Stick to tofu and mushroom pho but I tried it with grilled shrimp and am hooked. Delivery rather drags but it's delivered in all separate. Containers so you can assemble your pho how you like. I haven't really had any bad service I can speak of and their delivery man is so very sweet my only complaint is that it takes forever to arrive.
2016-01-12,2,Should call it PHOGAZEE!!  Canned mushrooms and baby corn in my pho,  Bahn MI (on the incorrect bread) slathered in Hellmans mayonnaise, vegetable broth in my BEEF pho.  Why do I taste overwhelming hints of allspice and nutmeg??  I felt like I  went to Taco Bell for a pizza,  the seasonings are ALL wrong! Great service through!
2016-01-02,5,This is my favorite restaurant to go to when I have a pho craving. Their grilled pork is just the meat I love with the pho. Garden rolls were impressive. My friends ordered pineapple fried rice and that was descent and I tried their curry chicken which had coconut milk base , reminded me of Malaysian style curry !!! This was good too !! Service is excellent at this restaurant aswell and prices are really reasonable too. Overall, this is a great restaurant where you can get good quality pho served by welcoming staff which is very attentive. I definitely see myself going back here again soon.
2015-11-20,2,Willing to try a new place, stopped by Pho Nomemon just before closing time, around 9:30pm, on a weekday and like Jim Carrey in Liar Liar, "I've had better." Ordered the Pho Tai Chin Nam Ve. Disappointed all around: the broth was bland and I counted a total of five measly pieces of beef. Also, my Pho was warm instead of coming out hot and steamy. Perhaps my experience wasn't great because it was closing time. Either way, I felt rushed (as did another poor patron that was asked if he was finished even though there was still food on his plate and he was chewing his food) and the Pho was a mediocre.
2015-11-09,1,Got an order for pick up and the lady treated me like complete s#*@. Rudest encounter at a restaurant I've ever experienced. Should be ashamed of their service.
2015-11-08,3,Food is okay, but not great. As one of the only Vietnamese restaurants in Hoboken, I've tried eating here a few times, but have never loved what I ordered. They do have really convenient online-ordering right through the Yelp app, and delivered my food in about 30 minutes. $20 delivery minimum. Prices are reasonable, but you definitely get what you pay for
2015-11-07,3,Pho not very tasty in my opinion compared to what I've had in other Vietnamese restaurants. Also, only one size bowl on thr menu and you get a large bowl which is only half full, with a small amount of noodles and not much meat. Service was good and place is clean.
2015-10-30,1,This is a vietnamese restaurant with chinese owners.  The pho is very oily and with too much added salt.  There is also 1 to 2 pieces of meat inside each bowl, it was not filling at all.  As for the egg rolls, do not get me started.  They are literally the size of baby hot dogs and for $6.75 (If I remember correctly) the price is a joke, if you order them you'll know what I mean.  They also only give 2 pieces of lettuce, how cheap can they be.  As the only vietnamese place in Hoboken, they have a clear monopoly so I will have to get my pho fix here until another opens.
2015-10-16,1,I did not like this place at all. The food portions are very small compared to many other Vietnamese restaurant. I highly do not recommend this place. I will not come here again. The place itself is clean but you go to a restaurant for the food. Usually Vietnamese restaurants are all good but I'll pass on this one
2015-10-12,3,I like the name, and I thought the service was friendly and fast.  I'm not sure the food meets the high bar set by the name.  It was okay.(According to yelp I started this review on 2/4/2014.  Over a 1.5 years to finish the review  Must not have been too exciting...)
2015-09-13,1,We ordered the spring rolls and they were too crispy / borderline burnt. The pho was mediocre. It did its job making me feel better from a night of excessive drinking, but so much oil. On top of the less than average food, the service was horrible. The waitress was rude and gave me a look when I asked for no cilantro on my soup. Everyone in my party noticed and I didn't appreciate that.
2015-08-31,2,I only game two stars because their delivery was very fast. Otherwise the pork bahn mi was flavorless and dry, and the pot stickers were soggy and barely filled with veggies. Waste of $20 (including tip) and won't be ordering again.
2015-08-23,5,Portions, taste and price are all on point. The employees were also very kind and hospitable. Defiantly worth visiting.
2015-08-20,3,Nice place to satisfy a pho-craving in the area.
2015-08-16,2,I had beef sandwich, good for my sodium intake for rest of the year. I tried the fish sandwich, the same.
2015-08-15,2,We got two sandwiches, one chicken and one beef. Expect the bread to bruise up your mouth, I peeled off the crust to eat my sandwich. The beef in the sandwich wasn't tender at all and a bit hard to chew.
2015-08-03,3,Pho Nomenon is a quiet little place on Washington serving vietnemese cuisine at a reasonable price.  You get what you pay for and that's about it.  I had the crispy noodles with shrimp.  Noodles were crispy and shrimp was cooked well.  Service was friendly but spotty. One of our party's meal was completely forgotten.
2015-07-30,3,Came here for dinner with friends and thought it was pretty good. I got the pineapple fried rice with shrimp. It was very filling b/c its mainly a rice dish. I got the thai iced coffee which was good but my dripper took forever to drip the coffee which was kind of annoying. prices were reasonable and service was friendly but they did forget about one of my friends meals so she had to wait a little bit.
2015-07-12,1,We ate at that restaurant last week and we didn't like the food. It was clearly not fresh
2015-07-08,2,The noodles here are the real deal but the soup leaves much to be desired. Very bland and not complex, it tastes like soy sauce broth. My order of pho with grilled pork meat came with a small plate of sweet and nicely grilled pork but the portion was definitely smaller than what I'd normally receive elsewhere. Did I mention that my friend also received strange tasting grilled chicken for his order? Not sure if I'd venture back here as there was nothing that was memorable.
2015-07-07,5,I live in NY But have friends who lives in NJ.  I have to say every time I come to Hoboken, I have to come  here to eat My FAV, their signature Vietnamese Sandwich and Pork chop over rice. My friends always ordered the beef noodles soup. But I will not leave jersey without my sandwich lol love love love
2015-07-06,4,I love this restaurant. Been four times. The pho is refreshing and feels much healthier than many other noodle soups (not greasy or oily). Also like that the meat cuts are good and not full of fat or jelly like stuff in beef cuts elsewhere. Service is great and food comes out quickly. Also try their Vietnamese ice coffee. Super strong coffee flavour with the right amount of sweet. So good!
2015-06-22,4,This place was so yummy and the service was great! The prices are on point and you get what you pay for! I ordered the Hanoi Style Grilled Pork on Rice Vermicelli and it was delicious and a huge portion. My friend ordered just a basic pho, but again it was a large portion and pretty good tasting! This is definitely a good Vietnamese place in Hoboken and would definitely recommend this place! Great prices and the service was soo good!
2015-06-15,3,I ordered take-out from here a few weeks ago. When I tried to order in Vietnamese, I was surprised to find out that the owners were Chinese and didn't understand what I was saying. Despite having Chinese owners (who are really friendly, btw), the food still had those delicious Vietnamese flavors. My go-to is the grilled pork with white rice. I've definitely had better and more authentic Vietnamese food, but Pho Nomenon is a must-try if you're in the Hoboken area.
2015-06-13,4,Vegan Pick:Vegetable Pho with Clear Broth - deliciousI also ordered coconut water...served in an actual coconut. Great quality. I was getting over being sick so I did not add sriracha (sinful, I know)...but I will definitely be back!
2015-06-10,2,yeahh. this place is not very good. i know hoboken doesnt have a lot of good asian food and this is the only pho place..but yeah. checked this place out yesterday. had the pho and pork with vermicelli. i wasnt sure if i even ate pork. everything was over salted..felt like i got hypertension just from that meal alone. i wouldnt recommend this place to be honest. just didnt really taste very good.service was real good tho.
2015-06-04,4,I am by no means a Pho snob, having only had it a few times before Pho Nomenon, but since this place has opened I frequent it when in the mood for a comforting meal of Pho Ga, and it never disappoints! I always get the veggie spring rolls followed by the Pho Ga rice noodle soup (steamed chicken). The broth is so tasty and lots of chicken and noodles, plus bok choy, bean sprouts, basil and lime. Makes me want some just thinking about the taste! I've eaten in the restaurant a few times for lunch and the staff are always very nice and attentive, offering suggestions for Pho newbies. I've ordered takeout quite a few times and no issues, it always arrives quickly! I hope this place sticks around, it's something different that Hoboken needs.
2015-05-25,2,Awesome to have a pho spot in the neighborhood, just a shame it isn't better. The pho is okay but I recently had the shrimp tom yum soup and instantly detected a tin taste, like from a tuna can. The soup was inedible but I had some of my wife's basil vegetable which was tasty. Not sure if it was a fluke, but don't think I'll try it again...
2015-05-21,2,Broth was too oily and the beef was sliced too thickly. The waitstaff were speaking amongst each other in Mandarin, so I suspect the operators of this restaurant are Chinese as well.If you live in the southwestern corner of Hoboken, you're better off walking to New Thanh Hoai in Hamilton Park. Their broth is easier to stomach and much more tasty, and their beef is so much more flavorful. Portions are a tiny bit bigger too. Their condensed milk coffee also comes to your table with a phin filter. Overall, New Thanh Hoai feels much more like an authentic Vietnamese restaurant.
2015-05-19,2,Very disappointed. Delivery order. Order beef Pho, lucky if I got two thin slices of beef, asked for extra lime, was given one piece, broth had ZERO flavor. Poor quality On the positive side we got the shrimp summer rolls, overpriced yet good flavor and peanut sauce.
2015-05-09,2,Not all that appetizing food.  I've tried this place twice and my girlfriend and I did not enjoy the food.
2015-05-09,1,My normal reaction to Asian food (thai, sushi, chinese, etc) in Hoboken is either cook it at home yourself or just go to Manhattan.  But we'd been recommended Pho Nomenon by friends and so thought we'd try it.  On arriving, the subtle smell of beef broth and lemongrass permeates the air and we became strangely enthusiastic about potentially finding another place to add to our repertoire. The menu looks great and covers all the basics from Pho to Bun dishes to Bahn Mi.  Will R.  started by ordering the iced coffee.  It arrived immediately and started the trend of disappointment.  This is what we get for diverting from our usual Vietnamese place.  The iced coffee was ridiculously weak (so much for expresso!).  For his entree, Will ordered the bun with beef and egg rolls.  When it arrived, we found out the beef was more like stir fried beef with peppers instead of grilled beef.  The dish also arrived without the usual sauce.  I, in the meantime, had gotten my bahn mi and while the filling was good, the bread was not.  Instead of a baguette this was a rather dense, flavorless, heavy bread that just takes away from the filling.We barely touched our food and left soon after.  The place did fill up rather quickly with lots of Asian people which usually would give me confidence about the food.  I understand that many people in Hoboken don't have cars and so getting to other parts of New Jersey may not be convenient but for us, we would rather travel 10-15 mins for good food than to eat mediocre food.
2015-05-02,4,Excellent Pho. Finally Vietnamese food in Hoboken!!! Service is OK too. Try their Bun Bo, they rock.
2015-04-30,3,Happy that Hoboken now has Vietnamese cuisine. The food here satisfies hunger but it's not authentic. Pho noodles and broth taste decent. Too much mayo in the banh mi sandwiches.
2015-04-26,3,I've been here a few times and the food has been consistent.  The portions here are heavy on the vegetables and I personally don't feel like I ever get enough meat.  Overall the food isnt bad but I prefer more meat so I don't come too often.  Additionally, I've had to struggle a few times to get answers to some of my questions, it seems like some staff aren't as knowledgeable as othersIt's not a place I seek out but it's not bad for the price and there isn't ever too long of a line.
2015-04-24,5,Pho Nomenon offers dishes that I can't really find in Hoboken else where. When I go I almost always get the mixed vegetable vermicelli and I'm never disappointed- it's my favorite! I've tried other dishes as well, and they have all always been delicious with a good amount of flavor that let's you add to whenever necessary with the addition of sauces on the side of every table. I will say that the service time depends greatly on when you visit. If you go at a busy time it could take quite awhile for you to get your meal (nearly a half hour) but if you go less than peak hours you will get your food immediately.They also offer bubble teas, my only issue being that there's a new bubble tea cafe nearby that has a wider range of selection, with larger sizes, for a little cheaper. Also, if you go with someone who is a picky eater, you will have a little bit of an issue. I went with a few and all of them take ages to order and then just eventually order a sandwich. I also find that the rolls are a bit expensive for not many servings, go with the pot stickers if you want a shareable appetizer.
2015-04-18,2,It's difficult to enjoy your food when everything is mediocre and the staffs are trying to push you out even though you have 15 minutes before closing. Even bankers are lot friendlier and polite than these staffs. It's almost as if they're not happy with their business or even worse, life.
2015-04-11,3,This restaurant has potentials. The reason why it did not get four stars from me is because of some minor shortcomings. My friend recommends the pho, but I order something different, which is not bad but not impressive. We also ordered spring rolls with shrimp and I'm a little bit disappointed. The wrap is too sticky and there are too much stuff inside so it's hard to bite. But honestly I like the flavour. So hope it can improve.
2015-04-05,5,One of my favorite spots in Hoboken!! I love that they deliver too! I am no professional when it comes to asian food, but my boyfriend is and he is a huge fan! I do the lemongrass chicken with rice and veggies, and we always get the spring rolls, they are wonderful! We always sit outside, the service is great and the prices are reasonable!
2015-03-26,3,The Phonemenon was a-ok. I like a sincere amount of lime juice on my broth which was clearly lacking. Also, it was lacking on beef. Good service and it is convenient since there are no Pho spots in the area. Will be coming back.
2015-03-24,3,My to go to pho place in hoboken. (i mean only.)Not the best or most authentic (its run by chinese people, like all the other pseudo asian food places in hoboken) pho place I've been to but it will do.  portions of meat and noodles are decent.  It's a cheap place to quickly satisfy my pho cravings.
2015-03-14,1,A bit overpriced asian food.  $8 for 4 garlicy chicken half wings... $2 a pop?  Really not worth it.  Pineapple fried rice?  Was cooked white rice mixed with peas and chunks of pineapple and shrimp.  Pad thai was lousy extremely fishy and dry with nothing.  It would probably be great if I didn't have any taste buds to deal with.  Sorry Pho asian cooking...
2015-03-10,4,Pho-nomenal banh mi! The food here is pretty good in general, but the banh mi stands out. Crunchy, delicious bread with all the flavors in the right amount. Mmmm.The pho is pretty good too, pretty standard and at a great price. And if you're picky about meat in your pho, you won't have a problem at this place. I also tried a crunchy spring roll just because they threw it in with the lunch special (a steal, might I add), and I'll definitely be ordering an order of those when I get delivery next time.
2015-03-06,4,Got P7 (pho with briskets) and S1 (traditional bahn mi).  Pho was good--soup is hot and well-flavored; noodles are chewy and cooked just right (portion on the small side); fresh and generous portions of bean sprouts; but no cilantro.Bahn mi was awesome.  $8.25/sandwich seemed a little overpriced.  The portion also seemed a little small since the bread wasn't overstuffed.  But, it was so good, with house spicy mayo.  Definitely worth coming back.
2015-03-02,3,A run of the mill shop that benefits greatly from being the only Pho restaurant in the area. Service is mediocre as they're in a hurry to close earlier than their hours state if business isn't bustling.
2015-02-20,1,Only go here if you are desperate. New Thanh Hoai in Jersey City is better and places in Chinatown are even better.Everything in the restaurant is how a non-Vietnamese (I'm guessing Chinese) person would run a Vietnamese restaurant...i.e., at first blush everything is the way it should be, but upon closer inspection (and tasting), everything is a bit off. Yes, the cha gio (fried rolls) are technically fried and technically rolls, but really shouldn't be served at a Vietnamese (or any other) restaurant. $7 for four small pieces of tasteless rolls dipped in tasteless sauce is a rip-off.I almost stopped eating the pho halfway through but continued because I don't like to waste food. The tendon, tripe and two different cuts of beef were chewy and flavorless. The broth tasted like hot salted water and no amount of sriracha and hoisin sauces could make it tasty.
2015-02-09,4,My first pho was pho from home, courtesy of Blue Apron.Fact:  No pho will be as good as the pho you will get from a place that serves pho on the regular. Pho is all about the broth, and 30 minute do-it-yourself pho doesn't make for a very authentic pho experience.Pho count: 8Pho-forward to Pho Nomenon (aka Phonomenomonomnom), a tiny place on Washington Street serving an absolutely delicious rendition of Pho that magically pops out of the kitchen in just a few minutes.Pho count: 12Pun count: 1The restaurant was quiet, so we pretty much had the place to ourselves. (4:28pm on a Sunday, so to be expected.) We were able to enjoy quiet conversation and bottomless (on the house) Jasmine tea, which was super delicious and of the optimal temperature.  Seriously, do you have a thermometer back there?  It was just hot enough to be considered hot but just cool enough to sip easy with no required wait time.  I highly recommend you keep that coming as frequently as possible.In addition to Pho, we both got a Bánh mì, one chicken, one beef.  Despite our very pronounced hunger, we killed the pho but both brought home more than half our sandwiches.  The pinnacle of any Bánh mì (the bread) was very crunchy, not flaky, and overall A+.Big portions, small prices, delicious pho, huge sandwiches - all for less than $30.  Plus they deliver.  Will we be back?  Pho sho....Terrible, predictable pun count: 1
2015-02-04,1,Too bad..Me & my friend ordered Chicken Pad Thai and Beef w/ Tomato Rice for delivery. When we opened the package, it turned out the Tomato Rice box was turned over and its sauce got all over the package... Eww. And my Pad Thai, hmm why did I order sth Thai from a Vietnamese restaurant. They are dry noodles w/ sth bitter & had a taste like goji powder. Chicken Pad Thai and Beef w/ Tomato Rice. Maybe other dishes are not so bad but DON'T EVEN TRY THESE TWO! It's my sincere advice.
2015-01-31,5,Great pho, great banh mi, great bubble tea, great pork BBQ with lettuce leaf, great noodle and bun dishes, great service and price. So grateful to have a neighborhood vietnamese resto!! And an excellent one!!
2015-01-16,3,First off, the name. That's like, what, an automatic 3 stars right off the bat?Just kidding. I come in here for my traditional bánh mì, viet crispy spring rolls, lettuce wraps, and bubble thai tea. Sometimes for the pho, but it doesn't really tickle my fancy- a pity, because, you know, the name of the place. It's average. Bye bye, 5th star.The meals are pretty good; my mother raves about them when I bring her. I stick to the lots-of-little-stuff method, however, and can personally say their crispy spring rolls probably are happiness manifest- into rolls, that is. Bánh mì is tasty, but probably not the BEST. Still, great for a walking luncher, especially with bubble tea. Mmm.
2015-01-14,4,Has been consistent when it comes to ordering, Pho Nomenon delivers large stews with a very unique taste different from most other things.  I usually order grilled pork or beef along with my Pho for eXtra nourishment.  Add some bean sprouts and some freshly squeezed lime juice for the complete experience.  If you go, the lemon-grass dishes are popular too albeit a bit more traditional perhaps in terms of asian food (i.e., steamed rice, vegetables, etc.).  A solid four stars, and I know that we'll be coming back again when our Pho cravings begin.
2015-01-11,5,PHO: This place was excellent from the second I walked in to the second I left. The service was great, the ingredients (bean sprouts and leaves) and the meat was great quality. For a little over $8, you get a very generous portion and amount of meat (I got the pho tai). The broth is Saigon style which is a bit less sweet and flavorful than the Hanoi styled broth but is still DEFINITELY worth the 5 stars. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the broth still had great depth to it.Hands down a very pleasant experience. Would recommend 100% and will come a bit out of my way to come back.
2015-01-10,4,I live on the same block as this place, but need to venture here more often! I am from the west coast and miss some good Asian fare. I finally tried this place for pho not too long ago and was pleased with the experience! It's not by any means the best pho I've ever had, but definitely satisfies my cravings. I've only ordered one of their pho dishes both times I've been here, so I can't speak to any of the other food. I'm immediately greeted with a hot cup of tea when I sit down--perfect on these cold days.  The folks working here are always kind and friendly, but also not too attentive where they interrupt you so often. It's clear that they have some very regular customers as they visit with quite a few people. Nice to see a local place building  a good rapport with customers. Service is very fast (always is for pho) and price is very reasonable: for a huge bowl of noodles with beef, I pay around $8-9. Not bad! The one downside I've noticed to this place is that it gets SO cold whenever the door opens or closes--be sure to sit far, far away from the door whenever it's cold outside.
2015-01-07,2,The meat needs to be rare when put into pho.  It really makes me sad that Pho nomenon doesn't adhere to that standard in their Pho dishes (or even gives the option).  The meat here is completely cooked through.  I find that makes the broth on the bland side - HOWEVER, just the fact that there is any pho at my disposal in Hoboken is a gift upon itself.  The thing that really annoys me is that they are sometimes on Seamless, sometimes not.  It really makes it hard to make it a consistent go-to delivery place when they sometimes decide they don't want to deliver.
2015-01-05,4,Considering there aren't a slew of authentic Viet places in NJ (compared to DC/Philly/Chinatown) this place definitely fits the bill. Quick service on this ice cold afternoon is exactly what makes this place a warm welcome to Hoboken. Topping off your meal w yummy coffee or hot bubble tea (only place to get boba in Hoboken as far as I know) makes this place the perfect lunch place in my book.
2014-12-22,4,So I have determined that Vietnamese food is my fav kind of Asian food and I'm glad there's a place in Hoboken to get it!I've eaten only a couple times but they effin deliver pho to my job soooo yea...that happens...a lot! I've just recently gotten into pho so, I am no connoisseur, but think it's pretty tasty. I wish they'd give a little more meat but it's Hoboken, so I get it. I am also a fan of their Bo Luc Lac (shaken beef cubes) and particularly their fried rice. The service is always super friendly and the food (even when delivered) comes pretty quickly, without sacrificing quality. I still haven't tried their banh mi, but am looking forward to it. It's an awesome lunch spot! Easy to keep your bill low and not walk away hungry.
2014-12-14,5,Great place in Hoboken for authentic pho. $9 for a generous portion of pho. The food is served relatively quickly and the wait staff is very friendly. The summer rolls are also quite tasty, love their creamy peanut butter sauce. We also ordered the fried calamari and that was not exceptional but it wasn't bad either, I have had better seasoned fried calamari elsewhere. Also ordered this for delivery. They are very quick with delivery but they do have a $25 minimum for Jersey City deliveries. Overall two thumbs up for pho quality and taste!
2014-12-10,4,I have to say I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews for this place. I'm not a pho connoisseur by any means but I thought the pho here was very good. I came in with pretty low expectations because of the reviews but was pleasantly surprised. With the cold, rainy weather we have been having soup is a necessity. I ordered the pho with beef meatballs and my BF ordered the pho with steak. The broth was flavorful - I did add some siracha but I like the heat. The BF had it as is and really liked it. The restaurant is clean and service is quick. To me this place is perfect for a quick, inexpensive meal. I would come back.
2014-11-30,5,Went here with my girlfriend and we were both really impressed. The food was great, especially the pineapple chicken fried rice.  The gentleman serving us was very courteous and attentive.  The food came out quickly and he even pulled an additional table over next to us to accommodate the additional plates we had. Will definitely be going to here again.
2014-11-26,1,Decor of the place is ok, nothing special. When I asked the waiter if I could just have 2 of the pho meats, he instead wanted me to order the regular pho and add another meat for $3.Once we got our pho, we were both extremely disappointed in the flavor of the soup, and the meat was hard n tasted as if it had been frozen a long time.Never coming here again. Go to New Thanh Hoai in Jersey City if you want delicious, authentic pho.  Come here if you live in Hoboken and don't have a car.
2014-11-26,5,me and the family were craving Vietnamese sandwiches, I was in Hoboken so  I ordered for 3 pick up . At 8.25 a pop a little pricey, but It was loaded with meat and veggies. The bread was fresh and warm. Very good sandwich
2014-11-21,3,Finally a PHO spot in Hoboken!! It's your average PHO spot, but a tad pricier because of the location. The food is good, the service is better than most Vietnamese spots, and the place appears to be very clean. Definitely recommend this place for the winter, as nothing compliments the cold weather better than those PHO soups.
2014-11-18,3,I've ordered the special soups on several occasions, and the quality has been very inconsistent.    I usually order the seafood soup and a couple of times there has  hardly been any seafood.  Other times the proportion of fish to broth has been adequate and the soup quite flavorful though  a bit soggy.  Tonight, I ordered the tofu vegetable soup and when I got home and opened it, there was no tofu, which was disappointing.  I really wanted to like this place because I have soup fairly frequently in the winter.  I will probably return as there aren't really any better options in Hoboken.
2014-11-09,3,Good spot for a quick inexpensive meal.  It took forever to order, but the Pho came out in under 5 minutes.  It was tasty with the proper ratio of siracha and hoison sauce.  I had the brisket Pho.  Next time it would be worth ordering the extra meat.  IT tasted healthy, clean and had flavorfully fresh ingredients.  The staff were very pleasant and cheery.  I am adding it to my go- to speedy meal joints.
2014-11-09,4,Noodles are good, and they make the Chow Fun I like as well.  A lot of places put too much salt, msg, or other unnecessary sauces, but not here - pure ingredients, and clean flavors.
2014-11-06,1,I was pretty disappointed in the food and service. My girlfriend and I ordered spring rolls and they were spongy. The soups we both ordered were bland and lacked flavor. Service was very inattentive. I really want there to be a good Vietnamese spot in Hoboken, but my search continues. The only Phonomenon here is the name of the restaurant.
2014-10-20,4,I've been craving real Vietnamese food in Hoboken for years and am very happy that this place opened up. Some of the dishes are a little non-traditional, so it's not mom's cooking, but overall I like the food. If I had a complaint, it would be for the take-out / delivery service. The girl who answers the phone can be a bit curt, especially if you have questions or want extra condiments. However the sit-down service is usually wonderful unless the place is full, in which case it can be very slow. I blame this on the ramping up period that all new restaurants go through and expect it will get better over time. The servers are very nice. As for food, my favorite would be the Hanoi Grilled Pork on Rice Vermicelli. If you're getting take-out / delivery and grew up on spicy Vietnamese food like I did, then make sure you ask them to include Sriracha and hope they include it, or you'll end up with some really bland fish sauce. I do like their twist on summer rolls, too. The sandwiches are decent but they go really heavy on the mayonnaise, so make sure you ask them to go light if that's off-putting to you. Prices are very reasonable. The only other complaint I have is that it can be dauntingly quiet. They need to pump up the music a bit so that you don't have to whisper to the person across from you. Other than that, it's a good place to get good food and I've had an overall good experience with them. I'll order from there maybe twice a month.
2014-10-20,1,Sorely disappointed....Ordered Tomyum and Pho here.   Both were very bland and didn't have much direction.  Tomyum, for what we were paying, didn't have much in it but pieces of veggies and small pink shrimps.  Asked for some fish sauce and they pointed at the spring roll dipping sauce and said THAT'S fish sauce.  I'm sorry but that's not fish sauce...it may have fish sauce in it but that isn't fish sauce.  Even their sriracha sauce was watered down and didn't have much kick to it. A typical pho restaurants would have 4 different kinds of sauces available on each table, which wasn't the case.It just felt like they were cutting corners and being frugal with their food.  All in all, I feel bad to admit but the food was not delicious and I would not recommend it to any of my friends. The boyfriend and I tried this restaurant twice and we desperately wanted to really like the food.  We both walked out very unsatisfied and very unhappy.  I'm disappointed b/c Hoboken doesn't seem to have good Vietnamese restaurants.... I miss philly.
2014-10-19,1,they messed up our order. tried to give it to us anyways and said they couldnt change it. we told them we wouldnt pay for something that was not our order. so they gave us our order after waiting another 5 minutes - we opened it to find the veggies half cooked and minimal sauce on the curry and cold rice.  VERY DISAPPOINTED. they could have taken the time to give us a decent meal, but were angry that THEY messed up. also the Pad thai's noodles were overcooked. the whole meal did not taste good and lacked spice.  bad customer service, bad food.  I would try another place before going here. they lost us as customers which is sad.
2014-10-19,4,Very excited that Vietnamese food comes to Hoboken. Despite mixed reviews, took a chance and was pleased with the food and service. Besides we really need some good Asian restaurants here. Having eaten at some great places in Vietnamese town in NYC, Montreal and San Francisco, this place does just fine. Like most reviewers said, it's not the best but I found most of the food pretty satisfying. The fried calamari was excellent and crispy, spring rolls was good but over fried. Pork chop over rice was fine, although they skimmed on the meat portions, and the Pho was good, though I can see that some people may say it is a little bland- I actually enjoyed it because i like my soup less greasy and less salty.  Am excited we have a new place to frequent from now on!
2014-10-06,4,Came here for pho on a rainy day. The pho was really good but not the best I've ever had. Will definitely come back here when I'm in the area.
2014-09-26,2,I consider myself a bit of a pho connoisseur. I try to have it all over the country whenever I see it. Alas, this spot on the main drag in Hoboken did not live up.Pros: Attentive staff, nice patio seating area to watch the world go by, reasonable standard menu.Cons: the food. The pho and vermicelli were bland and soggy with none of the accouterments you usually get like sauces, herbs and sprouts. If you like good pho or vermicelli, do NOT get it here. If you're not familiar with Vietnamese cuisine, don't get your introduction at this place.
2014-09-21,3,Glad to see a Vietnamese restaurant in Hoboken!!Service: staff was very friendly, but seemed a little frantic. It could have just been a busy night. Food: all around pretty good. Calamari - I couldn't tell if the breading had fallen off or if it was just very very light. Either way, I liked having more calamari than breading. Pho - we had P1 and P2. Both were very good, but we added sauces at the table to make them more flavorful. The meat was a little overdone and tough, but still good. Overall, I will be back!
2014-09-04,4,Picked up a Taro bubble tea.  Cost $4.25 Tasted great loved it but it was not cold enough.  Would go back for more!
2014-08-22,3,I come here relatively frequently (both dine-in and takeout), but only because they have a "Pho-nopoly" in Hoboken. A piece of wisdom- pho is not meant to be taken out of the restaurant. They do a good job packaging up all the components, but it just isn't the same.I've tried their basic pho and a few of the apps here. Nothing amazing, but good to satisfy a  pho craving without having to travel in to the city.
2014-08-17,4,Pho is one of my favorite dishes, but it's so easy to screw up. I crave it so often I have had to drive to Jersey City to get some... so it's about time it came to Hoboken! Last night, my husband and I were walking on Washington street and stumbled on Pho Nomenon so we knew we had to try it. We shared the Potstickers (meat) and they were excellent. Very fresh and a great flavor. I think they were chicken and lemongrass. They were the perfect potsticker: Crispy on one side and perfectly steamed on the other. The sauce was a little too salty, and I think it may have just been soy sauce. My husband got Crispy Chicken in Tamarind Sauce and he was very happy with it. The tamarind sauce is pretty close to a thai chili sauce and it wasn't swimming in sauce nor did it taste overly oily. They serve it on a bed of lettuce and tomato which he really appreciated. It also came with a side of rice.I got the pho ga and it was really tasty. What I especially liked about it was that it was not just chicken and noodles, there was baby bok choy and lots of types of onions as well (and of course the beansprouts, lime, and thai basil). The broth was very tasty and the serving is GIANT for only $8. The chicken is steamed so overall it feels light, healthy, and comforting.We also tried some drinks: Jasmine Bubble Tea and Thai Iced tea. The Jasmine tea was way too floral for my taste and they make it with condensed milk so it's heavy. My husband was happy with his Thai iced tea. The service was great and everyone was very friendly and helpful. I am so glad Pho has come to Hoboken!!
2014-08-10,4,Very reasonably priced. Just moved to Hoboken and was debating on this place for awhile. Finally went tonight. The crispy spring rolls were really good and the pork banh mi was spicy and tasty.
2014-08-07,2,Update: Ordered the pho and this time, the meat were not the thin cuts you usually get. It was thick and chewy. The broth was not as rich as other pho places in the area. On the upside and hence the 2nd star, the service was actually good since the waitress was nice and attentive. FYI: The place is run by Chinese...
2014-08-02,1,This is the worst Vietnamese restaurant I have been to. The red chicken curry was bland and the chicken had a strange consistency.  The banh mi had to much mayo, no pate and little flavor.  The beef with broccoli had so much salt that you had to dilute it with lots of rice and even then we couldn't finish it because it was so salty. The pho with tofu was not bad. The fresh tofu spring rolls with peanut sauce were quite good. Bubble teas were also good, just request a side of ice because they come out warm (and half way through our meal). Lastly the Vietnamese coffee was not only bad, but the cup came out half full. The waitress was nice but was kind of terrible. She was new so understandable, but I had to dock points for not knowing what soy sauce was when I asked for it three times.
2014-07-29,4,I went here for lunch today and really enjoyed it.  The waitress was friendly and attentive.  They have a pretty standard Vietnamese menu. I ordered the shrimp summer rolls, which were among the best I have ever had. I also had Bun Vermicelli with grilled pork, which was delicious (a minor critique is that the pork was a bit fatty).  I sat outside which was nice for people watching, but I walked through the restaurant to use the restrooms.  The restaurant had nice decor and the bathrooms were very clean.  Glad I stumbled upon this place.
2014-07-29,3,This is my first time dined in this place. I got to be honest....compared with the Vietnamese restaurants in LA, not as authentic but for the area it's in.... Good enough! I ordered their pork chop and rice lunch special for $7.95 which also comes with a spring roll. The flavor of the pork chop is pretty good and the portion is perfect for lunch. Definitely will come back again.
2014-07-19,3,Pretty standard spot. Got their standard pho and Banh mi. The Banh mi felt pretty scantily filled. Half was just carrots. The French bread was also on the stale side. And it's quite pricey for Banh mi... Overall wouldn't recommend ordering.Pho was as expected, though also on the skimpy side for the meat.The Thai milk tea I got was a bit bitter. Not sure how that came about...bad powder/milk ratio? Who knows. Overall, I think it's a good enough spot if you specifically have a pho craving considering there's no similar restaurants on Washington st. But don't stop here if you're in a wandering type of mood  - there's better food choices a couple blocks down.
2014-07-19,3,Wasn't great. Wasn't awful.  Overpriced for the small portions they give.  Probably won't go back anytime soon considering I can get authentic pho in JC.
2014-06-29,4,Excellent service and great food! The seafood pho was really good and the vermicelli with pork too. The thai ice tea was ok. I will go back here.
2014-06-22,4,The service was superb and extremely accommodating to my friends' many requests. It's good food, but adjust your expectations for prices and quality since it's in the midst of downtown Hoboken.My friend and I both got the vermicelli. The menu didn't mention soup, but they served it in huge bowls, so we both asked for the soup. For the price elsewhere, we would've gotten it.A bit salty, or maybe it's msg. Otherwise, the vermicelli was delicious, and so were the pork meatballs. I rarely have red meat, but these were worth it.
2014-06-20,4,Compared to the Vietnamese restaurants in Manhattan Chinatown, this would probably only get 3 stars. But considering the absence of *good* Asian restaurants in Hoboken (no *real* Chinese restaurants, one pseudo-Korean place that isn't that good, and a bunch of mediocre Japanese sushi restaurants), Pho Nomenon deserves at least an extra star! I've been wanting to eat here for a while now but had been turned off by some of the mediocre reviews but I wish I gave them a chance sooner, especially during the winter months where that hot bowl of pho would have made the long winter pass a little faster.I got a bowl of pho and the wife got some bun. The pho was really good. Meat was a little overcooked -- at most Vietnamese places I've been to, the meat is pretty raw and they put it on the soup right before they serve it and let the heat from the soup cook it. Maybe they thought Hoboken couldn't handle that.The bun was also very good. Probably not as good as the pho but pretty good. I definitely plan on coming back here. Thank you Pho Nomenon for adding some variety to the Hoboken food scene! We don't need any more Italian or pizza restaurants!
2014-06-17,2,Perhaps we were there on an off day, but we found the service to be less than desirable and the food to be inferior to what we are used to in JC.  We were there on a very slow Saturday afternoon.  There were only two table in use, and the server was sitting behind the bar reading, but he rarely ever looked up, even when I was practically waving my arms in the air.  The food was fine, nothing special, but not terrible either.  I think we will be sticking to our usual JC location.
2014-06-06,4,First time here and I'm happy about the results. I eat a good amount of Vietnamese food. My two go-to spots are Pho Grand on Grand Street in NYC and Saigon Cafe on Newark Street in Jersey City. My favorite dish is grilled Pork on Vermicelli noodles so when I headed into this place, I figured I would order the dish I have the most experience with to gauge whether it was good or not. I was stoked how good it was.  My girlfriend ordered the Sesame Beef on Vermicelli and liked it too.
2014-06-02,3,The warm weather is coming so I got the grilled pork bun as takeout. It's a tasty, good-sized portion (more pork than you would expect). No cucumber in mine (just lettuce, carrots and bean sprouts) as the menu promised, but I didn't miss it. However, I did miss more herbs (seemed to just be scallions) and wouldn't have minded another cup of fish sauce mix on the side. That being said, Hoboken is not exactly known for its Asian food. I look forward to giving their banh mi a try next.
2014-05-26,5,LOVE THEIR BAHN MI SANDWICHES!I think it's pretty good Asian cuisine for Hoboken. I've had odd experiences with the Asian restaurants in Hoboken. Places like Robongi, Illuzion, and Chicken Factory (the Asian menu) all served me unfresh-ish and tasteless items...but this place is pretty legit for the area. I'm glad I discovered the place and can do take outs often!
2014-04-29,4,4 stars for the Vietnamese sandwiches. 2 stars for the restaurant name.  There are not many places (if any) in N. Jersey that have good banh mi.  It is done properly here - nice toasted baguette, fresh cucumber, cilantro, pickled carrots and daikon.  I've had the grilled chicken and the grilled pork.  Equally good.    Prices are decent for the large size of the sandwich.They have outdoor seating in the front so it's a nice spot to have lunch on a sunny day.
2014-04-10,3,A really good place to come have a reasonable lunch in Hoboken. I've had the pho soup lunch special twice. They were good but not amazing. I am trying the sandwich today. Service is curt.
2014-04-07,4,I am very particular about my Pho. The broth has to be clear, the meat sliced just right and cooked to a medium perfection. When I learned that Hoboken was getting its first Pho restaurant I was skeptical. The first visit back in January was a tad bit disappointing. The meat was overcooked and there was no nuc mam cham (common viet dipping sauce made of fish sauce, chili, sugar and water) for my friend's bun cha. When I asked if they served nuoc mam cham, they looked at me as if I had asked for some foreign substance. No nuoc mam cham in a Viet place? That's like not offering ketchup at a hamburger joint. Sacrilege! Even so, I nominally enjoyed my Pho and it took care of my fix, so I chalked up the place as somewhere to go when I couldn't get home to my mom's home cooking. I am not sure if they wised up and hired a new cook, but my recent visit definitely improved my opinion of the place. The Pho had much more flavor. What really recently sold me on the place was when I placed a delivery order. Now normally I wouldn't think to order Pho to go since you can never predict asian soup dishes will arrive. My assumption was that it would come all mixed in some tupperware and the noodles would be soggy and the meat overcooked. I was extremely happy and pleased to see that, not only did they separate the noodles and broth into their own containers, but that the beef came raw. I was ecstatic that I could prepare Pho the way it's supposed to be made - with the noodles being laid down into the bowl first, then the raw meat layered and the hot broth poured over the meat to bring it to a medium pink state. So Bravo Pho Nomenon! Your Pho may still not be as good as my mom's, but it's made a repeat customer of me.
2014-04-04,4,I discovered this place about a month ago and have been back four more times.  Though not the best Vietnamese I've ever had, I must say they do the standards quite well.  I really like that the restaurant is clean and the prices are very reasonable.
2014-03-21,3,Disappointing...  I have had Pho twice before in other cities, and this one didn't come close.  The broth is decent but too bland.  The meat is like steakums -- shaved frozen beef -- and not enough.  The noodles were good.  The cilantro was already added in, rather than in the fresh-add-in plate.  Also, the lunch special came with a spring roll but (1) we had to ask for it, so we got it after the pho instead of before as an appetizer and (2) it comes without sauce in the lunch special, which I thought was absurd.  So the food is edible but I would not go again, given the many other better choices for dining in Hoboken.  I feel that I could make this much better at home!
2014-03-15,3,Place is good as Hoboken's only VN restaurant. It's not authentic. The pho broth is definitely not right, it's not bad, just not authentic. The grilled porks are yummy. The sandwich I ordered tasted nothing like a banh mi, it's more bland than a ham and cheese. VN coffee is worse than Dunkin. If you are in the mood for VN food in hoboken. Go there, it is a good experience. But I wouldn't say the food is good.
2014-03-08,1,I had a similar experience to Desiree D. I've eaten A LOT of pho in SF bay area (and recently in Chinatown NYC), all vegetarian. I've never had a problem ordering a vegetarian version, but when I called to order take out from this place, they seemed extremely confused, then delivered subpar service and food. The manager had to get on the phone to explain  "Pho is a beef broth based soup, OK. It is not vegetarian." (Yes, thanks, I'm well aware of this, and it's why I'm asking for your vegetarian take on pho.)They explained they have a "special clear broth vegetarian soup" that you can order with noodles on the side and pay extra. Fine, but really? Pay extra? Not a nice way to treat your vegetarian customers who arguably could be your most loyal - you're the first pho shop in Hoboken - corner the market. Do it right. My vegetarian soup cost 10.95 + 2.00 for the noodles. This DID NOT include the typical side basil, bean sprouts, jalapeno and lime - in fact, it's not even offered to vegetarians.After I received my order, I took a look at the pricing on the rest of the menu (their menu is not available online anywhere yet, so I was not able to compare before ordering). A beef broth based soup on their menu costs anywhere from 6.95 to 8.95, includes noodles and the side plate of spouts, basil, jalapeno, etc. Good, reasonable pricing. This means there's almost a $6 premium for a vegetarian "pho" type soup - and you can't even call it that. In addition, the soup was bland, and the noodles had an off taste. The only thing it had going for it was the baby bok choy. What vegetarian could hate on baby bok choy? Not this one. Bottom line: Huge missed opportunity here. They should make it simple to order a  reasonably priced (!!) vegetarian pho with all the fixin's - I've never been to a place that has made it so complicated and therefore unwelcoming as a customer.
2014-03-03,5,My sister and I went here for the first time last night and had such a great experience! We ordered a vermicelli dish with pork meatballs, pho and shrimp summer rolls. The food was delicious, it wasn't too crowded so the atmosphere was nice and the staff was really friendly. The only place in town for Vietnamese (about time!) Highly recommend checking it out!
2014-03-02,1,Always willing to give somewhere new a shot but wish I hadn't. Had the Ginger and Scallion Chicken which had huge pieces of inedible ginger in it and no scallion. The sauce wasn't particularly nice and I had almost twice as much rice as main meal that I had just paid $10 for.Will not go back. Just dreadful.
2014-02-26,3,I was a bit let down--i called and was told that they do have vegetarian PHO. but they do not, to be exact. for vegetarians, we have to order a clear broth soup, that has some veggies in it ($10.95) and then order a side of noodles ($2). Kinda sucks, it was alright---nothing special. have i had worse pho? hell yeah i have. have i had better? hell yeah i have! it wasn't real pho for me tho, kinda let down. the  service was fine, the place is small. they do have a large menu and things to choose from but I'm not sure if id come back here. there aren't many options for me and even the appetizers are  a bit off, $6 and $7 for two spring rolls..sounds kinda lame. they also don't give you much to add to the soup and/or appetizers. a few bean sprouts and what i believe was mint. oh well, i gave them a chance.
2014-02-03,5,This place is OK.  Pho is decent and delivery service is quick.  Rooting for this place because this is the only Pho noodles place in town, but the food could be a little better.  Never a bad meal, but never fantastic.Update: 4/8/2014: have to up these guys to a five because I order delivery from them all the time, and the Pho recipe has become more and more tasty as time has gone on! The pho is very consistent. Bonus pts for their low delivery minimum. (Only 10 bucks) and friendly phone staff.
2014-01-31,5,It could be that it was the coldest day of the year, or that I haven't had Pho in a while, or that I was just SOOO excited to see this new place since Hoboken is sorely lacking... But I have to say, this was absolutely delightful.  The woman that took my order on the phone was extremely kind and helpful (and English speaking for the nerds that care about that), the menu selection is fab, and the gentleman that delivered my food was very kind and professional.  Not to mention the fact they quoted a 45 minute wait on a VERY SNOWY night, and our food arrived in about 20 minutes.  I might order it again tonight.  For those interested we had Pho 1 and Pho 7 and Summer rolls with grilled pork.  Outstanding.
2014-01-28,1,Food is so-so and the staff are not that too friendly and they don't return your change. I just wish that they give the change back and wait for the tip to be given and forcibly taking it from the customers.Will not recommend this restaurant.
2014-01-25,4,Whenever I come here, I order a big hot bowl of their pho. It's exactly what I need after walking home from the path on a cold night. My food never takes longer than 10 minutes to come out no matter how busy they are. For the price and size, it's a great deal. However, I heard that their bahn mi sandwiches aren't that great.
2014-01-20,3,The pho was just so so. I had the number 7 and couldn't distinguish any difference between the different types of flank. The flavor was decent but nothing earth shattering. I will return to give their bahn mi a try though.
2014-01-18,2,Vietnamese is one of my favorite cuisines so when Hoboken finally got a Vietnamese restaurant, I was really excited. That is, until I tried the food. Extremely disappointing. And the most disappointing thing of all was the pho. Very badly done with strange gummy chicken and bok choy and broccoli floating in it. Horrible! The food is more a combination of cheap Chinese take away and pseudo Vietnamese. If only they could find a decent Vietnamese chef in Hoboken, someone would make a fortune. In the meantime, jump in an uber and go to a decent Vietnamese restaurant on 10th St in Jersey City.
2014-01-15,2,I only had summer rolls so this is not a very comprehensive review but they were just ok. I'll be going back to my vietnamese restaurant in Jersey City.
2014-01-13,2,"Meh. I've experienced better" says Yelp, and I totally agree. I got the traditional Vietnamese sandwich and holy heck was it sadly made. The vegetables weren't bad, but the bread was horrible and the pate/meats tasted and looked like they had been sitting out or prepared days before.This review is only for the sandwich (...as that is all that I had), and it wasn't very good.
2014-01-12,4,Number 3 was amazing!  Make sure to start off with fried spring rolls.  It's alittle small and the tables are crowded, but the flavor makes up for the space.
2014-01-12,3,I was introduced to pho back in college by a Cambodian friend who would take us to the most authentic places she could find. So it's been awhile since I've had pho, but was excited about something new coming to Hoboken, as this town is lacking diversity lately.A friend and I stopped by for lunch one day. Service was quick, and the menu is big and there should be something for everyone, including non-pho eaters. The lunch portions were big, and I wasn't able to finish my bowl. The pho was good, not pho-nomenal (sorry, I had to!) but I will certainly be back to try more off the menu.
2014-01-10,5,Went to dinner here on a Saturday night with my g/f and was seated promptly.   The pho and food was very authentic and and I throughly enjoyed the portion size.    I had beef pho and my g/f had chicken pho.    As soon as we were seated we were served fresh hot tea (free) and big glasses of water.  They were prompt on tea and water refills without having to be asked ( a pet peeve of mine).   Our waitress was a very nice lady and always had a smile on.I would defiantly come back here again.
2014-01-09,4,The pho here is quite good. The only qualms I have with it is that they only have one size. It would be nice to see them have different sized bowls, that way the occasional "pho seeker" in Hoboken may sate their hunger. Other than that, great restaurant.
2014-01-08,3,Try It. Welcome to PHOboken, finally, the Pho craze makes it's way into "the birth place of baseball". With clean decor, fun music, and a varied, ample portioned menu Pho Nomenon Noddle is worth a try. Just be wary the prices are a bit steep for casual Pho, the lunch menu is lame (dishes are the same size and price as the dinner menu, simply coupled with a thumb sized pork spring roll) and the service while quick is not accommodating (no substitutions on the thumb sized pork spring roll, sorry vegetarians). Whether to expand your horizons or escape the PHOrst, try Pho Nomenon Noddle & Grill, it's good, just not Phonominal.
2014-01-06,2,I so wanted to like this place as I'm a big fan of Vietnamese food. The prices are reasonable, the portions generous and the staff very attentive, but when my soup with grilled chicken consisted of all fatty chicken, I immediately lost my appetite!  I appreciated the constantly full cup,of tea, as well, on a particularly cold day, but sadly, even that didn't please as the tea was cold!
2013-12-31,5,Finally a pho place in Hoboken! Great pho. The complementary tea was a nice touch too. We came here for the lunch special and will come again.
2013-12-31,4,Good authentic Vietnamese food.I really liked the Beef Broth Pho and the Spring roll. The place is new and they have some kinks to work out but overall it is good and nice change to the other Asian places in Hoboken.
2013-12-29,1,One of the worst Pho I ever have !Do not recommend !!!!Broth has no taste.  I did not try any other food but Pho is supposed to be basic dish, isn't it ?  Drive further and go to New Thanh Hoai.  You won't have a surprise like I had.  Other dish,  well I did not try so read other review or you are on your own !
2013-12-28,2,The pho was good, not great.  Kind of a small portions compared to other places.   Would have given a 3 star rating but have to drop it down to 2 stars because of the service.Went here on a Thursday night around 9 PM.  No hours are posted on the door to indicate when they close.  Ordered an appetizer and my girlfriend and I both get pho.  9:15 PM - Got our food.9:25 PM - Bill was placed on our table - OK, don't know why and continue to eat.9:30 PM - Someone is looking over my shoulder and the girlfriend asks, "do we need to pay our bill or something?"  To which this man responds with, "Yes, our systems are closing down."9:35 - Basically, pushed out the door.Hopefully the staff fixes their ways as I would like to come here often since it's 2 blocks away from my apartment.  Just have a bad taste in my mouth because of the way we were treated.
2013-12-26,4,3.5 stars rounded up because the neighborhood needs this place!I do agree with other reviewers that this resto isn't necessarily remarkable. But, it definitely beats another Japanese place or mediocre Asian fusion. The banh mi was actually really yummy! They could offer spice level options, though that's not a deal breaker. The bread was warm and crisp, and the fixings were tasty. The pho was average; hits the spot in the winter time. Honestly, I think the best part about this resto is the bottomless tea. I'll keep coming here for lunch.
2013-12-21,4,This place is great. I had the pho nomenom soup last night with shrimp summer rolls which were amazing. I suggest getting just the Pho Tai soup next time with just the one cut of beef in it instead of the tripe intestines and such lol. Today I ordered again for lunch because I really wanted to try the spring rolls and one of the Vermicelli B dishes I ordered B9 sesame beef!! So good!!! And crispy spring rolls A1. I loved the spring rolls.Next time I'm trying the lemongrass beef and Hanoi pork. I'll be back with update.
2013-12-20,2,This is Chinese interpretation of Vietnamese foods. We had dinner 12/18/2013.  We ordered "B4" (Bun with shrimp), and we received beef ball Bun. well, the waiter quickly replaced but he didn't say any words about this mishap and he never said "sorry" !!! Bun actually tastes good, but the Pho I ordered tastes ok, I can have better authentic Pho and better service somewhere else.
2013-12-17,5,Great pho, sandwich and pad thai ive ever had!! Best location in hoboken. Wont regret.
2013-12-11,2,Really wanted to like the restaurant.  Been waiting for a Vietnamese restaurant in Hoboken for a long time.  Unfortunately, the food is mediocre at best.  More Chinese then Vietnamese.  They have Vietnamese chiefs  ... still, I would not call it "authentic" Vietnamese food.   I'm critical here because pho is THE best known Vietnamese dish, and pho is the restaurant namesake.  I've had much better pho in Jersey City's mom-and-pop Vietnamese restaurants.  Sorry, cannot recommend this place.
2013-12-11,4,Pretty good Pho...I think I know Pho and make my own broth which takes forever so great to have this locally.  Plus, they deliver!  Pretty great service for a new restaurant and problem free.  Little bit of a language barrier with one of the staff but that just screams authenticity to me :)  Definitely recommend the PHO.

2013-12-08,3,The staffs are extremely friendly!  The food is not bad but not good either- Summer rolls: okay. pretty standard. - Pho: There wasn't much meat, barely any tripe, and the broth was pretty good filled with MSG.
2013-12-07,2,After stay in library for the whole afternoon, my friend and I decided to try this new opening restaurant , a little bit disappoint about this restaurant ,size is small, price is reasonable, taste is just ok, not too good nor too bad.
2013-12-05,3,Stopped by here tonight for dinner. Place got pretty crowded after a few minutes. Started off with the A1 - Spring rolls ( lots of meat inside, yummy) also had the chicken wings (4 jumbo sized with a tasty marinade). Also had the traditional Banh Mi which was very tasty (crunch bread, nice veggies and well seasoned meats inside). My brother ordered the Shrimp Red curry - they got the order wrong not once but twice. Both times it came out like some sort of stir fry dish than an actual curry (hello!!! Where's the broth/gravy). We cancelled the order and finished up dinner. The owner lady apologized and gave us a 10% discount. It's opening week so they surely get a pass for not getting everything right. Look forward to coming back soon and trying the PHO. Much needed addition to Hoboken !!!!
2013-12-05,3,I have been anticipating the opening of this restaurant for quite some time. My favorite food is Pho, so my expectations were high and my fingers were crossed that I wouldn't be disappointed. Overall I was pleasantly pleased. The restaurant is clean, the food was fresh, and service friendly. We tried pho (P1 & P3). Broth was tasty and serving size reasonable. Soup could have used a little more broth and would have liked more bean sprouts.  Beef was already cooked by the time it reached our table. We also had the spring rolls and the summer shrimp rolls. Both decent and fresh. I will definitely be returning to Pho Nomenom to try their Vietnamese sandwiches and vermicelli. Hoboken is definitely lacking in Pho, so this is a refreshing new option. It might not be the "best" pho I've ever eaten, but it definitely does the job and satisfies the craving. They can definitely expect to see me as a regular customer! :)
2013-12-04,3,Pho (p7) was good.  Pork chops were ok and spring rolls were excellent.  Overall I think it will do for Hoboken.
