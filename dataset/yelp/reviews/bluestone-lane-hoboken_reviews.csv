2021-10-02,1,The service is terrible. We waited over an hour for our food. The restaurants wasn't that busy, and when our food came (after having to ask twice where was it) it was cold, AND they still managed to mess up one of our plates. Looks like they prioritize the take out orders over dine-in orders. They make you tip at the moment of ordering which means you don't really get a chance to actually tip what the service deserves, which is nothing.
2021-10-01,2,not great service, not great coffee, and definitely not a great addition to Hoboken's already abysmal food scene.
2021-09-28,4,Yesterday I tried the Bluestone Lane Hoboken location. I ordered the chai Tea Latte and it was good and they also have food and other drinks and it's a good place for coffee.
2021-09-28,5,Bluestone lane is a fun, tasty, and overall excellent place to grab a nice breakfast or lunch with friends. The food is great and there are so many amazing coffee selections to choose from. Highly recommended!
2021-09-11,1,I Ordered the green baked eggs and waited about 30 minutes before anything even arrived at our table. It was a Luke warm coffee lol. When our meals finally arrived, they came without any kind of apology for the delay. The entire restaurant was full when we first got down and by the time our food arrived we were the only table remaining. Halfway through the week, we asked about the delay but never received any explanation. If they didn't force us to pay for our tab in advanced w/ 25% tip in advanced), I would have complained about not paying for that overpriced piece of shit meal that none of us really ate. Our waiter "didn't even know" we ordered food (even tho he confirmed our order went in). Lol ‚ÄçDONT COME HERE!
2021-08-20,2,Wanted to love this place so badly. Everything on the menu is fresh and healthy and right up my alley. However I really don't have many nice things to say. The service was TERRIBLE.  I ordered the best mates bowl at the same time that my friend ordered her food. She got her food 30 minutes later while I waited and waited and waited. I finally asked where my food was and they said oh sorry we gave it to the table next to you here AND PROCEEDED to hand me a plate from the table next to me. Not only is this disgusting in a normal time (the lady had used her fork and dug around it) but in the middle of a pandemic I was absolutely appalled. The waiter continued to pressure me to take it until I caused a fit. Again I can't believe he would even suggest such a thing. I then had to wait another ridiculous amount of time until I got my food. Meanwhile my friends food was completely cold. I ended up having to go get the food from inside myself 45 min later... not one person seemed apologetic or offered to do anything about the situation. Note you also have to tip/ pay your bill beforehand. Interested if the staff would have tried harder if that was not the case...
2021-08-10,3,Bluestone  Lane has become almost as ubiquitous as Starbucks. Their coffees, dishes, & streamlined decor sure are pretty.The Avocado Smash is a slice of multigrain toast topped with equal parts heirloom tomatoes, feta, & avo. The bread is tasty but I wish it were softer & fluffier instead stead of overly toasted.On one occasion, I ordered red baked eggs (similar to shakshouka) but the waitress erroneously brought out green baked eggs & the wait to fix my order was interminable. My experiences with their food and service haven't been satisfactory, & their tables are way too close together for my liking (pre- and especially during Covid times.)
2021-06-30,5,Made a quick stop for some drinks and we were immediately welcomed by such friendly workers. Loved the decor of the place too. I hope to return and dine in next time!
2021-06-26,5,Incredible service and absolutely delicious food. Was not disappointed with one thing. The staff members were lively, fun and friendly.
2021-06-19,2,Servers were kind, barista was not. Kindly asked what ingredients were in specific drinks but response received was listless. Not to mention a drink ordered was incorrect despite a clear label made by the friendly staff member working the register. When a staff member brought back the incorrect order to the barista, they remade the drink in frustration and slammed the drink passive aggressively. Bad day, was it? Maybe, but it sure was not an enticing first experience.
2021-06-12,5,Self serve through app, hand sanitizer smelled like beauty, service was pleasant.  Food was fresh, different combinations made eat bite full of flavor!
2021-06-01,1,Ordered online, wasn't ready 10 minutes after it said it would be. The guy behind the counter then tried to use his fingers to stir the matcha latte instead of the whisk. Walked out without the latte
2021-05-27,4,This is my first time trying their Brunch after drinking their coffee for long time. There a lot of seats outside that look nice and also very cute inside. The decor and decorative plant inside is beautiful. Clean and cozy. We have to scan QR code, order and pay from our phone. Coffee is not bad. We had three dishes for two people, Avocado smash, B.L.A.T.E and warm chicken salad.  Everything is good, fresh and healthy. Our favorite is Chicken salad. Staff seems friendly and nice. But service is slow even if the restaurant is slow, we never get what we asked for, so I had to walk to the staff and get it. Didn't come to check on us and never fill our water. I drink and glass was empty before food came and they never came. However it's a nice place to hang out with friends, great food.
2021-05-02,5,Excellent food, I ordered "Green Baked Eggs" the Guasacaca that was delicious, the eggs were well cooked, it was delicious, the only thing they could improve is the bread they serve, in particular I am a foccacia lover, I think that would be the only thing that the plate lacks for its perfection.Regarding drinks, we order "cappuccino, Iced Mocha, Iced beet latte and Iced Spring Trellis Tea" all of them was delicious, the organic drinks they served without sugar that is perfect because you can put it if you want. . there are very few places like these, an efficient, technological care. See you soon Bluestone Lane !!
2021-04-28,5,I used to frequent a few of the NYC locations pre-pandemic and am very pleased with the Hoboken location! I've ordered delivery from them twice recently and both times it was delivered on-time or early with my correct order. The BL Big Brekkie is the perfect breakfast plate. You can also order gluten free toast instead of regular bread, which is nice for anyone with dietary restrictions. It comes with a generous amount of mashed avocado, two poached eggs, crispy bacon, mushrooms, and greens. I order mine without tomatoes. It's $17, which at first glance seems steep for breakfast delivery but the portion size makes it well-worth it!
2021-04-25,5,Cute coffee spot. Their drinks are very tasty and their avocado toast is so good! They offer types of milk and i love oat latte. Nice vibe as well.
2021-04-12,4,Matcha iced latte is very good. Also the banana bread is very tasty. I've never been to this location since I always get it delivered. It is my go-to matcha shop when I can't make it at home.
2021-04-04,5,Hoboken runs on coffee !! So many coffee options and so little time! Easter morning, not sure who would be open. Bluestone Lane was a quick walk over for a cold brew to start our bunny hop!
2021-03-20,3,Tried this place once and ordered the green baked eggs with egg white substitute. The dish was good, I just thought it had a little too much feta in it. It's also a bit dry, would definitely recommend eating with hot sauce.
2021-03-11,2,Although my wrap was delicious, I can not justify paying $16 for a wrap and $1 EXTRA to get this very small and pathetic salad instead of potato wedges. Absolutely NOT worth it! You better be serving all-organic with those kind of prices.
2021-03-11,5,First visit here, really enjoyed it!  Staff was wonderful, great menu options for Vegans!  We sat outside and liked the ease of ordering and paying with my phone.  Will surely add this place as a regular stop.
2021-03-09,4,Got the green baked eggs with a latte and they were delicious! You can really taste the quality here.
2021-02-24,5,Delicious food! Sat outside and really enjoyed the breakfast burrito. Friendly service - will be back!
2021-02-06,4,Chanced upon this spot for brunch. The service is great and the food really good. I had the brekkie option
2021-01-29,5,Are rare and wonderful place to sit inside and enjoy a great breakfast.   This restaurant is trying very hard to please during the ever lingering pandemic.    I am very happy to drive a few miles to Hoboken, find parking and make a great morning.   My go to is an iced latte and the BLATE breakfast sandwich.   The accompanying breakfast potatoes are wonderful.    There's limited seating so be patient.
2021-01-05,4,I think what they came up for with Covid was pretty awesome! It is basically contactless besides the server bringing the food to you! You actually do everything on your phone from ordering drinks, food, and paying! We honestly enjoyed it and it was super easy. The food was also so yummy and fresh we loved everything we got. It definitely is a great spot for breakfast or lunch!! They also offer outdoor dining too which is a plus. Super fast and efficient delish meal!
2021-01-01,5,Avocado Smash was legit  fresh. Chai Latte, Hot Milo & Macchiato was upto mark, Soft Chili Scramble w/ Avocado was spicy fresh & delicious. Healthy, fresh ingredients prepared to perfection! Cute cozy warm little place, with a nutritious and delicious menu,friendly helpful staff will make you feel at home, definitely my new go to place!
2020-11-28,1,If I make a reservation, I expect a socially distanced table (6 feet). Instead I was offered a table they crammed in within inches of the takeout line. Not cool. We left and will not be back.
2020-11-16,5,Psyched I came here.  I'm from LA and was staying in Jersey City for a few days. I'm headed back to CA at noon but wanted to find an amazing latte in the area and searched the on line recommendations. This place came up and I'm glad I drove over here.  Easy parking on street.  Cute place with limited indoor dining.  Nice light music and comfortable. The barista knows his stuff.  He is an expert and the latte proved it out. Also had the smashed avocado and it was delicious.  Anyway, highly recommend this place.  Thanks for exceeding my expectations and satisfying that caffeine fix.
2020-11-14,2,Too pricey. Food quality was just ok. Have been to Hudson Yard one. It was great, especially the lemon pancake. I had it after 12. That's why I visit it in Hoboken. Wanna eat their lemon pancake again. BUT it's only served before 12pm in Hoboken. That's disappointed. Ordered: B.L.A.T.E: really simple. The bun is not good. The side of fries sucks. Rainbow salad: portion is good. I have leftover to take home. Dressing is delicious. I like the salad but pricey. Didn't get their coffee this time. I think their coffee will be good. I will not visit the Hoboken one anymore.
2020-09-12,3,The food taste good !   But coffe is warm not hot, also I went with someone else and  I got my food first and the other dish like 20 min  I wanted water  napkins hot sauce salt , everything came after food. :(
2020-09-06,4,Ordered the big brekkie with halloumi.  Also the banana bread with chocolate and without.  And some cold brew.  They put avocado on one half of the toast.  I think they made a mistake.  Other than that everything was delicious
2020-08-15,4,Surprised that they offer contactless ordering for dining in( have outdoor dinning area; offer hand sanitizer). They would ask you to place order on phone through QR code, very convenient.The avocado toast taste nice and fresh. Beet latte takes a bit flavorless. General service here is nice.Cons: no bathroom service( during quarantine)
2020-06-29,4,It's the best cappuccino place in Hoboken. I think their quality of cappuccino and espresso are the best in Hoboken in my opinion. The foam ratio to the coffee is right on.
2020-03-16,4,Bluestone Lane is always a solid option for a drink or for brunch. I love their oat milk chai lattes, and I've enjoyed a few of their brunch options. My primary complaint about brunch is that while the food is tasty and fresh, the portions are small for the prices (even by Hoboken standards). However, this has never stopped me from returning.
2020-02-21,3,Food was just ok, nothing to write home about. The atmosphere is cute, but the seating is TIGHT and the stool chairs are not the most comfortable. Its also a bit overpriced and the menu doesn't have a huge selection. I didn't hate it but I don't think I'll be back.
2020-02-18,2,Meh.......... wasn't so great, the coffee is alright Overkill with ingredients and weird combos.
2020-02-15,3,Part of me really thinks Bluestone Lane is overrated. They have a pretty decent iced matcha latte, but I don't think the sandwich I ordered was worth what I paid for. I've been to Bluestone Lane quite a few times now and have ordered several different dishes and they're all good, just not quite good enough for how much I paid. Service at this location is also not as strong as in other locations. It was hard to flag down someone to get the check and the server did not come by to take the plate once I was finished eating. Seating is also a little tight at this spot. We were so close to the other tables - it almost felt like we were one big party rather than separate tables.
2020-01-15,4,Super good brunch food and coffee drinks. Went here New Years day, so the place was pretty busy. My only suggestion would be to get more servers!
2019-12-05,5,I had their ice latte and Aussie ice latte (it has vanilla ice cream) and they were both really good! They had so many good food but through yelp review I decided to have their Green Baked Eggs and I was not disappointed! It was so good and the bread that comes with it was so soft and chewy! It had a drizzle of olive oil on it so it was even better!! The inside of the place was also very cute! The waitress was so nice and offered me what was good and popular. I would definitely go back!
2019-11-24,2,The coffee isn't great, simple as that. Ordered a large hot, added a little cream and sugar, took the first sip and wham, bitter as heck!!!! Now it's possible that I got the late morning brew and by no means am I a coffee snob and by no means would I consider this review to bear any weight, but the coffee was bitter. The people were very friendly and the dining room was packed so if you're looking for a cute environment with good service, definitely give this place a shot. If you're looking for a quick in and out, grab a cup a jo to go, this might not be the best choice.
2019-10-30,4,Treated myself here on my bday as I like their coffees and was going to be around the area during breakfast time. And I say treat myself because their menu is expensive lol however food quality/taste is on point. Interior is clean/well decorated and spacious enough for several people to be seated. I settled into the outdoor seating area on a sunny day with a book, and it was nice as it wasn't too busy on a weekday morning/early afternoon. I got their green baked eggs ($15) which took a while but came in a small skillet with a piece of bread. I also got an iced latte ($5), which was a small espresso shot and a cup full of milk and ice. Like I said, food was on point! Very tasty- came topped with cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach, chimichurri, and feta. I thought I'd be more hungry as the portion wasn't very large but the eggs definitely held me over for a while. I'm not in Hoboken too often, but if I am I can see this as a great brunch option! Several healthy/"trendy" dishes
2019-10-22,5,Besides from being extremely busy, I've always enjoyed my visits! I've been to this location in hoboken a few times and nyc locations as well- I love their iced chai tea! Brunch this week was good, i got the Brekkie Board (1/2 avocado 1/2 yogurt/granola). This was the first time I've had an actual sit down meal. Service has always been nice - they do their best. It was packed a lot of children screaming and running around and a bit loud but that's because it was raining and no one was sitting outside so it was a bit crammed. I'd recommend this spot, bathroom is always always clean!
2019-10-11,1,Absolutely pathetic service. Waited for almost an hour and never got the breakfast I ordered. All I got was a cold cup of coffee. Horrible experience.
2019-09-22,1,Yelp.. please stop suggesting I leave Manhattan for a poorly rated brunch place. I understand they might be paying you and you are conflicted because, I do drive out of the city on weekends sometimes but, get your act together and update me on the wait time at cookshop.
2019-09-21,4,Bluestone Lane reminds me of brunch dates in Los Angeles. Fresh, trendy vibe and (generally) healthy food. Met my friend here for brunch around 12:20 on a Saturday and business was bustling. The outdoor seating had a small wait, so I chose to sit inside. It took a minute to get the table cleared/cleaned and then another minute for the waitress to come by with menus. Overall the service is good, but I do think they could benefit from extra help.I do agree With other reviews that the food is on the pricier side (but that's the area, right?). For two small matcha lattes (sadly ours came sans beautiful latte art) and two salads aka "bowls," our bill came out to $45; $53 after tip. I had the chicken and greens bowl and my friend got the salmon bowl - we both enjoyed. It's definitely filling! One thing I didn't love is how they give the check. The waitress comes by with an iPad and just tells you your total. Generally, I like to see the itemized bill and see what I was charged for. You pay her on the spot and call me old school, but it's a little rushed. Overall, however, I would come back.
2019-09-21,5,Stopped into Bluestone Lane, Hoboken, NJ, and what a pleasant surprise!  Double espresso and Latte were great and we had a Banana Walnut Cake that was absolutely superb!! Highly recommend having a slice if you are here or as our server said stop into any of the Bluestone Lane places to enjoy it.  Wow a truly pleasant surprise and the servers were so nice...
2019-09-15,4,I came to Bluestone Lame for brunch on a Saturday morning. The first thing I noticed was the incredible coffee aroma wafting through the air. It was amazing. Bluestone Lane has both counter service if you want to just grab something quick to go and also offers table service with a variety of breakfast and lunch options. This place is super Hoboken but in the best possible way - fancy coffee drinks, avocado toast, trendy healthy options, the works. I had an iced latte and their brekkie board which consists of half avocado toast and half granola yogurt parfait. For a few simples items, it was super delicious. Everything was fresh and filling. The service is a little slow so if you're in a time crunch, I suggest going for counter service. It's nice that they don't rush you out though. Really relaxing atmosphere and nice spot to kick off the weekend.
2019-09-14,4,I went to bluestone lane for brunch this morning and im totally in love with this place! The decor is very bright and inviting, perfect for waking up. There is counter service and table service depending if you want to stay or grab a bite and go. I ordered a hot brew coffee and a chicken salad sandwich. The hot brew came with a small bottle of fresh brewed coffee and a little pot of creamer. I got like 2.5 cups of coffee our of the order which was lovely. The cups and saucers here are all adorable. The chicken salad sammy was fresh, herby and delicious! Im always skeptical about chicken salad at some places because its how they use up old chicken, but this place definitely makes pulled chicken just to use for chicken salad! The brioche bun was light and buttery and went perfectly with the chicken salad. The staff here are all incredibly kind! Just know that the table service can be a little slow so if u are in a hurry go with the counter
2019-08-16,5,I stopped by here on a Friday afternoon.  Place wasn't too crowded although it can get busy on the weekends.The place is very clean and spacious.  There is table seating with marble and pillows if you're against the wall.  They also have outdoor seating which makes for a pleasant experience.  Waiters are friendly and attentive.  When you walk in, they bring you a tall glass of water and a menu.  The coffee comes in a glass and a heated cup if you ask for it.  Then there's the food.  I had the green baked eggs.  I ordered them without tomatoes.  It's really good, a mix of eggs, veggies, and sheep's cheese.  The avocado smashed is also a really good choice.  They're a little pricey and they don't accept cash payment.  It's card only.  But overall a really good choice.
2019-08-16,4,I wanted to dislike this place because the menu is yet another hipster extravaganza, but the food was surprisingly good.We were looking for a breakfast spot before my husband had to go to work & we were undecided about what to have. He chose this place & when I saw the menu I figured we were too old to be eating here, haha.So let me start by saying the service was very good. Also, the bathroom was clean, which was a real plus. They don't list regular coffee on the menu but when I asked for one, I received it. My husband had Australian Breakfast tea.We eschewed the ubiquitous avocado toast for the Prosciutto & Egg Roll, which had a sunny side up egg, prosciutto, spinach & roasted garlic aioli on a brioche roll. It was delicious! Can't go wrong with good prosciutto.Prices are high, but it's that kind of place. I used to say I was too Brooklyn for a place like this but now Brooklyn is full of places like this.  Anyway, it's good. Give it a try.
2019-08-12,2,I found it very plain Jane. Went for breakfast I got the Big Brekkie which was basically avocado smash but with 2 slices of prosciutto for $19 and it was only half of a loaf. My husband got the avocado mash full loaf and his was $13....so for $7 more I paid for 2 slice of prosciutto and the avocado didn't even have to much flavor to it.... I don't mind paying for a good breakfast but I feel cheated.
2019-08-10,5,Amazing coffee! Flat white coffeex2, so smooth and delicious. Haven't had anything like this before, was a bit hungry and got the pulled chicken salad sandwich to munch on along with some chocolate banana bread that was very good. Set up like a cafe, the staff is very friendly and helpful. Very clean, price point on food was a bit on the higher end but the quality was very goodFood comes out super quick as well. Great spot to park and study or get some work done as well, fast WiFi. Check them out!
2019-08-07,5,Incredible. If you are a coffee enthusiast -- better hit this spot up!My boyfriend and I came here on a hot day and chose to sit outside. We enjoyed it and enjoyed our waitress as well! I forget her name, but she was knowledgeable of the menu and compassionate with us.The food looked delicious however, we only ordered two rounds of coffee. Yes, two! I ordered a cold brew with a scoop of ice cream in it. Mm, the beans were delicious. Not bold or dark -- just the right medium roast and rich in flavor.We then ordered an affogato that came with more vanilla ice-cream served with a double shot of espresso and shaved chocolate on top. Definitely a go-to for me from now on when I am in the area!
2019-07-28,2,What a DISAPPOINTMENT - O.M.G!!!After hearing rave reviews, my mom and I were so excited to give Bluestone Lane in Hoboken a try! I ordered the Avo Smash (toast) with a poached egg and my mom had the 'Big Brekki.' It should be a CRIME to charge so much for appetizer-sized portions where the food is inconsistent. We both had poached eggs on our plates and mine ended up hard boiled while hers was severely undercooked. The plating looks pretty but the flavor is lacking for its appearance, not to mention the bread on my plate was stone cold. So much for avocado "toast."I will say, the coffee is good but that's literally the only thing I'd come back for...maybe (hence two stars on this review, instead of one). However if you don't like strong coffee than nothing offered at this place is for you. They also seemed understaffed here or the waitstaff just simply lacks common sense since they'll bring you your plates without utensils unless you ask them. Beyond absurd in my opinion.
2019-07-09,5,First , let's establish the premise: this is more of a restaurant than a simple walk in and sit place ( but certainly you can do that) Regular cup of joe and an Avocado toast sitting outside. Very good service , presentation of edibles and the taste to match You can't ask for more!
2019-07-05,5,What a great place!It's hard to start with the best part because both the people and food were outstanding. We actually live in NJ but decided to stay in Hoboken for the night as a little getaway. Got up and started walking around since so much has changed. Change isn't always great but it is for Bluestone. Small menu done perfect which is the way I prefer a place.We tried the 'Overnight Oats, Egg and Prosciutto Roll and the Banana Bread'.  Everything thing was spot on. Great combinations of flavor that were just unbelievable.For drinks we had a latte, cappuccino, apple juice and affogatto, what a treat and very cool latte artwork.Last but certainly not least is the staff. The staff is so pleasant and able to connect with people quickly, it was just such a great way to start the day. I can't wait to come here again.
2019-07-03,5,Great service by the manager Varian. The avocado toast was great as was the matcha latte. Thanks again for the great service.
2019-06-27,5,Ate here with my boyfriend this morning and as soon as we sat down, the waitress approached us with our coffees and informed us that the kitchen sink was flooding. She said we would still be able to order food but that it would be a bit of a wait. After waiting only 20 minutes they gave us our entire meal for free! Amazing service and an even better place!!!
2019-06-26,5,Just ate here today for the first time and it was a great experience!! The waiters were friendly and went above and beyond, even offered to take a picture for me and my friends! The decor is very trendy and the restaurant overall has a good vibe! I ordered the avocado toast and granola meal and everything was delicious! I would completely recommend stopping here the next time you are in Hoboken it is located close to the water and in walking distance from the train station!!**tip- they DO NOT ACCEPT CASH**
2019-06-26,5,Beautiful shop, well maintained.  Gets SUPER busy on the weekends, so be prepared to wait or come a little outside of the typical "rush periods."Payment is super easy (they do everything via a digital handheld-even payment, so no fuss no muss when splitting the check)! Their juices are good, their coffee is great.  I've tried a bunch of the food over time, and it's all been good (my favorites are the banana bread and the avocado toast).  They have all sorts of non dairy milk (e.g. almond, oat, etc), and the service is super prompt.Try and snag an outdoor table in the summer-they wait on those too, and it's a little less noisy when indoors is crowded!
2019-05-19,4,This place is adorably cute. The food is super fresh and very instagramable. I wanted a quick healthy meal before a long day of errands and this delivered. There were people that seemed to be hanging out, but most people were coming in after their workouts judging from their outfits. One negative: the Aussie Iced Latte is overpriced for what it is. Just get a regular iced latte and go out for a scoop later. But overall worth a try if you're in the area, nothing to drive over for.
2019-04-14,1,I had loved this coffee shop a lot until I had a matcha latte with expired soy milk today about 1 hour ago. Their matcha latte was my favorite, but I was a bit suspicious when I got it today. There was a lot of tiny white thingy on top of the latte. Well, it could be normal? So I took a sip. However, it tasted SOUR and apparently the soy milk they used was expired. I spitted it out on a napkin immediately and asked for a new one. Didn't have the chance to take a picture of the sour latte though. Hope that won't cause me diarrhea tonight. And, nope, they didn't say sorry because the guy who was making coffee seemed super busy. I don't care about refunds, but I do think it's necessary to let everyone know this place is not always good. Just be careful. I probably won't come here in the future. So sad. Everything was nice until today.
2019-04-09,3,Cute place with a lot of healthy and delicious options to choose from. Service is good. Staff is friendly. The only reservation i have about this place is the small tables and extremely tight corners. Can't exactly fit what you ordered on your table much less any of your belongings.
2019-03-02,4,Enjoyed a nice little brunch here for the first time last weekend catching up with a girl friend. All of the food looked yummy and since I couldn't decide I got the brekkie board which included smaller portion of avocado toast and their yogurt with granola. Both were SO good and really tasted fresh. We also got cappuccinos which were aesthetically pleasing with the designs! Only cons are a bit pricey for these items I could pretty much make on my own and if it is crowded you might as well be sitting with the people next to you (even if you didn't come together) definitely would come again though to try other items!
2019-02-09,5,Excellent servers. Really enjoyed chatting with them over the espresso macchiato. New to the area and is one of my go to's! Keep it up!
2019-02-03,4,Bluestone Lane is in the heart of Hoboken in a small but aesthetically pleasing little building. The inside has numerous two and four seater tables as well as one long table in the front and features nautical style decor. The setup isn't ideal for large groups, but is definitely fine for brunch dates or even a solo breakfast. There is also a walkup coffee bar as well for espresso drinks on the go. I ordered the Aussie Iced Latte on the recommendation of our server. The concept is interesting as it substitutes ice cream for ice cubes in the latte. I was concerned that would create an overly sweet drink, but the iced latte itself was flavorful and not overwhelming sweet. As for the food, I tried the Green Baked Eggs which is eggs, feta cheese, tomatoes and veggies in a small cast iron skillet. The skillet itself is small but is packed with food so overall the meal was filling. I tried a bite of my boyfriend's Mediterranean Chicken Bowl, which I found to be a bit dry - not really my style, but he enjoyed it. The service was quick despite it being a busy Sunday morning and the manager who stopped by our table was very friendly. I'll definitely be back here again for brunch and coffee.
2019-01-29,2,We got lattes and it was over $10. Similar in cost to Starbucks. Flavor of the latte was alright. Coffee has a nice roasted taste. I just can't justify the cost of it. The food looked good being served so we would like to return and try the food. I will likely not be ordering a latte again though! They had almond milk available which I appreciate.There are other coffee shops nearby with better coffee. And the food is overpriced. We will not return here.
2019-01-27,3,I stopped at Bluestone Lane Coffee with my girlfriend after church on Sunday. We waited to be seated and waited even longer for service. He messed up our order and spilt my milk (maybe it was his first day). They kept forgetting to give us spoons so I had to use my finger - ew!!! He really tired to be nice and give us coffee to go, but again I had to use my finger...Besides the service, they serve coffee in a glass jar, news flash coffee shop this does not keep your coffee hot... It's clean and the food is tasty, but it's a bit pricey.  What I recommend: Get your coffee to go!$$$
2018-12-29,5,Such an amazing place to grab and go or meet up for brunch with friends. I love their service & everyone is so nice. The baristas make it feel so homey. They're so accommodating. Their chai latte with oat milk is highly recommended!!! Definitely recommend.
2018-12-22,5,This is one of my favorite coffee shops in the area. Definitely stay in and order some brunch if you're able! I always feel so welcome when I come in- Juan and Brittany are the best servers and always greet me right when I walk in. Food is so good and the coffee is even better. The baristas are experts and always recommend new things to try. They truly take care of you. Try the avo toast and ANY of the lattes!!
2018-12-20,5,Probably my favorite brunch spot in NJ. Best costumer service, good food and friendly atmosphere.The coffee is great too
2018-12-20,5,Bluestone lane is amazing. I enjoy there juices 3 times a week with a cold brew coffee. It is the perfect way to start your day.
2018-12-18,5,Great little spot in hoboken for coffee, pastries and brunch! Love it here! The baked eggs and the prosciutto egg roll are really good and I get them every time. You can come to sit down or just for coffee, great service either way. Just be sure to know that they don't accept cash!
2018-12-17,5,This is one of my favorite spots in Hoboken for weekend coffee, a quick brunch, or if I am working from home, I love to go in and have space for a few hours early in the morning. The staff are friendly, approachable, and know my order and preferences pretty well at this stage! It can certainly get busy, but this is a sign of how tasty, fun and atmospheric it is. So glad to have this on our Hoboken doorstep!
2018-12-14,5,My new fav! Not only are the coffee and food are delish, but the staff is among the friendliest and most accommodating that I've encountered in my 10+ years in town. Highly recommend.
2018-12-14,5,Really nice team in Hoboken throughout.  Professional yet casual vibe and of course a decent flat white. Juan is a top man.
2018-11-21,2,Avocado toast WAY overpriced. It was good @ $8. Doesn't taste as good @ $13.  Disappointing.
2018-11-21,2,Avocado Toast is way overpriced. $13 in Hoboken, yet only $8 in NYC. Disappointing. Flat white tasty, but also overpriced. Friendly staff takes too long to prepare the salmon toast.
2018-11-21,1,I'm writing this still sitting here, over a half hour after we ordered with no food and no explanation despite a couple attempts to follow up. I doubt we will wait long enough to even eat here. How long can it take to make an egg sandwich? This is the first review I've ever written. I'm that annoyed by this place. Also the menu is pretentious. Pass.
2018-11-15,4,Cute Australian coffee shop chain that retains the feeling of a local, neighborhood cafe. This cafe gets a lot of natural lighting and I love the look of the blue tiles next to the light wood.I got the Classic Avocado Smash. It's your basic avocado toast, nothing crazy. I also got a latte with soymilk and it was delicious! The highlight of my morning, though, was our server. She was so genuine and friendly.
2018-11-14,4,I really love avocado toast but this one took it to the next level - looked great and tasted delicious! Prices were pretty high and I'm pretty sure they've increased since the last time I was hear. Still really nice spot to treat yourself! Cute vibe overall.
2018-10-08,4,Very hippy and upbeat spot. Drink menu was somewhat expensive, the cafe portion was packed. The matcha lemonade and chai tea latte was delicious.
2018-08-19,5,Happened to discover this place thanks to my wife's colleague for whom it is the best coffee place. We visited it a couple of times and couldn't disagree with her opinion. Have tried cappucino, tea and cold brew. All the beverages were good.
2018-08-18,5,A great quick breakfast spot. Their freshly pressed juices are a-little pricey but delicious. The avocado toast is a good portion and I added the poached egg and it was delicious. Staff was friendly and food was prepared promptly.
2018-08-03,5,Limited menu but the food is healthy and delicious! I got the bowl and it was amazing. The person I was with got avocado toast with salmon and loved it.
2018-07-29,5,I am addicted to this place. BEST ICED COFFEE. Best employees. Their almond milk that they put in the iced coffee is also crack.
2018-07-22,5,O.M.G. the flat white was perfection and the baked eggs.... I cant tell you how much I enjoyed that meal. I actually savored every bite. Like stopped an moaned LOL. I was by myself and I'm sure people were like wtf. BUT the lady in front of me said she ordered it because she saw mine ... so good advertising I guess lol. It had so much flavor. I'm usually so disappointed with red sauces in restaurants. Eggs were perfectly cooked. Tons of veggies. Ummm. Great service and great food.
2018-07-20,4,Great location , clean , delicious food and really good coffee.The minus is the waiting time , too long without a menu and then almost done with food when I got the coffee.Patience and the place is worth it!
2018-07-19,5,A town gem - a place where everybody knows your name and know how you take your coffee. The friendly staff makes it a wonderful experience. Quality food and beverage selection can meet any craving. A must visit!
2018-07-16,4,Such a cute coffee shop. White walls, fresh & bright atmosphere. The service is very friendly and they have great menu options.I was very excited when I saw that they serve oat mill, which is delicious in a latte---that's what I ordered and it did not disappoint.It's a little expensive but delicious. I didn't try any food but if it is like the coffee, I'm sure it's delicious
2018-07-15,5,The "brunchiest" of brunch spots. This trendy cafe packs flavor and freshness into an exclusive menu with delicious signature dishes. Cappuccino was the best I've had on a while; I love it with the thick foam and a bit of flavor sprinkled atop. I ordered the rainbow bowl, but is was much more green than it was rainbow. My favorite bit of the dish was the ginger turmeric yogurt dressing on the maple-roasted carrots. Scrumptious! and the dish had bulk and sustenance with a bed of spinach, beets and lentils. I found the poached egg flavorless, but did I mention the healthy serving of Avocado on top?! It was really very filling, I couldn't finish, which is very unusual for me. Service was a little slow, but they weren't rude about it. And everything is presented so well, very instagram worthy.
2018-07-14,5,I frequent almost every coffee shop in Hoboken (what can I say I enjoy good coffee) and this one of my favoritesWhy - it is a consistently good coffee made by experienced baristas with a love for what they do.  (Tip: if you have Juan make it - better than ever!).The atmosphere is excelent and the staff professional.  Always consistent and always  good.Highly recommended.PS  I think they have pioneered and  redefined the avacado in Hoboken.
2018-07-13,5,The staff are always nice, and they make an amazing almond milk latte. Seriously stop in!
2018-07-07,5,One of my favorite spots in Hoboken!  The food is incredible, the coffee is always perfect, and the service surpasses my expectations every single time! The pace is perfect to come with a few people to catch up or to come solo and get some work done. Not too noisy and not super quiet - perfect vibe for either.
2018-06-28,5,Came here for a late brunch. They've changed the menu but the waiter was nice enough to help us choose what to order. We loved the banana bread more than the almond toast and the granola. Before we leave the gave us free baked goodies. All of them were good but the lamington cake was soooo yummy, definitely recommend it.
2018-06-23,5,Several friends, but mainly the amazingly talented and beautiful Kate and sexy Kam from SophistiKate located Hoboken NJ mentioned this place and stated it was the best avocado toast ever.  I decided to stop by this morning and WOW, the food was amazingly delicious and service was exceptional.
2018-06-06,5,Awesome place to come for a coffee or some brunch. The staff is friendly and outgoing and the food is always delicious. They even have these fresh juices that are so good. Definitely recommend visiting this spot if you want some really excellent coffee.
2018-06-04,5,Great food! Staff was also super friendly and inviting! Came for the first time yesterday and wasn't disappointed. Ordered their "Avocado Smash" with an almond milk latte. So simple yet so good! I will definitely come back and try out the rest of the menu.
2018-06-03,1,If it wasn't for someone passing by me in a car and noticing I was there I would have thought I was invisible. It took about 10 minutes to get our drinks, than the service started to get really bad. About 5 tables sat down after us and ALL got their food long before us. We both just ordered eggs and toast but it took about 45 minutes. Once our food came it wasn't prepared how we asked. After we ate it took another 45 minutes to even be noticed by a waiter to be able to pay our check. This was probably my 10 time going to bluestone lane and I will NEVER be going back.
2018-05-19,5,One of the best cappuccino's I've had.  The rainbow bowl is amazing.  Loving this cafe concept!   The Avocado toast is decadent! Ask for Nathalie...  she's a pro at creating a wonderful customer experience!
2018-05-15,4,Definitely a bit pricey and a limited menu but I thoroughly enjoyed my meal!Got the avocado toast w/ heirloom cherry tomatoes and feta on top along with the iced latte with almond milk! I left satisfied and full. Not the biggest space so be prepared to wait a little for a table.Perfect for a 2 person brunch, not a big group!
2018-05-14,3,Really love the flavor and quality of their lattes! The staff is knowledgeable, friendly and will help explain and select the best drink for your tastes. Bright clean environment with all the essential coffee mixers and then some. Have not had a chance to try the menu, but everything coming out from the kitchen looked fantastic!
2018-05-02,1,While charming exterior and delicious coffee - the customer service at this location is lacking.  From condescending attitude from the cashier to an attitude that just plain is mean, I can find upteen other coffee places alone on Washington Street serving coffee with a smile.  Two visits too many.  Spend your dollars elsewhere in Hoboken.
2018-04-28,2,Don't understand the hype. I got the famed avocado toast an iced beet latte. Both flavorless - nothing special whatsoever, and so incredibly overpriced it hurt. I had really been hoping to try the sweet potato or beet root hummus toasts, but were told the menu changed (though their online menu still states they have both of these items).It took over an hour to get a piece of toast despite the place not being busy and being very well-staffed (I'd guess about 10 people working). When the food did come, both my mom's dish and my dish came without components listed on the menu. Was really expecting more and feel pretty let down to learn this is more of a hype place than a legit place. Oh well. Ya live and ya learn!
2018-04-25,3,3.5 stars reallyThe place boasted a seating area that was able to sit 20-30 guests with a long bar. I guess it was more of a take out spot since the bar took up more than half the cafe.I'm visiting from out of town and a friend and I came here late afternoon to do some catch up. We walked into what felt like a birthday part of some sorts (on a weekday afternoon)? Where I saw a table of moms and kids going..crazy. So..it was loud.Nonetheless, it didn't bother my friend, so we sat down. I ordered an Americano and friend ordered a croissant and (I think) a cappuccino. Despite the place not being very busy, we waited a solid 15 minutes or so for two cups of coffee. Once our coffee arrived, the croissant came a few minutes later. Our server was quick to take our order, but our order decided to come a bit...slow.For some reason, when we ordered before..."last order" time and our drinks came pretty quickly. I guess we were the only party to make a final order?Prices were ok for what we got. No complaints there.All in all, I do like the feel of the cafe and the place got 100x quieter after the table of moms and kids left. So it didn't stay loud for too long. Slow service was the only reason for the -1.5 stars, everything else seemed fine.
2018-04-18,4,Love this place for a mid-week breakfast or lunch.  Haven't been yet on the weekends.  Must try their banana toast and avocado toast with "the lot".
2018-04-08,4,I had a cappuccino here yesterday with a friend. We decided to get afternoon coffee and had a good experience. Service is very good and while there is a food menu they will seat you just to have coffee. Clean atmosphere and fun.
2018-04-03,5,TL;DR - BEST OAT CAPPUCINO E.V.E.R.!Are you the kind of person who likes drinking non-dairy milks with your coffee?If you are, this place is a *must*.The people here know their non-dairy milks; and the oat is le-git.BONUS: the staff is super friendly and the atmosphere lovely and welcoming.
2018-04-02,5,I think I'm in love... The service is the sweetest, and everything on their menu is lovely. Happy girl:)
2018-03-21,1,Do not come here. I am not a hard patron to please and very rarely award a place such a low rating but even I can say that this place needs a lot of help. My friend and I walked in and there's a small sign that says to wait to be seated but there's no hostess stand of any sort so everyone just crowds in the doorway. The one woman working that day was working as host and server. She walked right past us and at least 5 other people also waiting maybe four times before even acknowledging that we were there. Now, the place was full and she was the only person working the front of the house but still - at least say hey I will be with you in a minute rather than walking right past us and saying nothing. We were sat 5-10 minutes after arriving which is understandable. But what wasn't was the fact that it took almost an entire hour to get TWO AVOCADO TOASTS. I wish I was kidding. The seating is communal style benches which is cute and fun but we could hear the three ladies right next to us becoming clearly upset at how ridiculously long their food was also taking. They addressed it with the one and only person working the front of the house (the hostess/server mentioned earlier) and she seemed to just blow it off, at one point even saying something to the effect of "oh, no hold on I don't handle complaints. That's what the manager is for," and literally walked away from the conversation. I couldn't believe it. These three ladies next to my friend and I all also ordered avocado toast. This extraordinarily long wait would be understandable if you'd ordered something extraordinarily extravagant and time consuming. But we didn't - literally just avocado toast. Because the women next to us complained about the wait, the server brought them a piece of banana bread. I am ALL for service recovery but her delivery of the bread and the size and quantity of the bread was sad. To bring one piece for 3 people and then to just pretty much set it down and walk away didn't really do much in the way of service recovery if you ask me. The other thing that bothered me about this was that my friend and I had been waiting almost exactly as long as these 3 ladies next to us and were not offered banana bread or other form of compensation for waiting 1 whole hour for a piece of toast. Ordinarily I would not expect that the server compensate every diner in the same way but when the tables are communal style benches, it makes it sort of awkward when the people you are literally brushing shoulders with are offered something and you are not. There was no compensation whatsoever or no acknowledgement from any sort of manager. We were sitting right next to the kitchen area where they prepare the drinks and assemble the toasts, and could hear all the chaos going on in there as well - not a single person seemed to be on the same page. As for when the toast finally did come, the avocado spread was good but the toast itself was not. It seemed stale and overly toasted and didn't at all make up for the hour long wait for it. Had I been in any sort of hurry, we would have never waited around that long. Not sure if I just caught this place on a really off day or what but I would never go back.
2018-03-11,5,Excellent fresh food and drinks! Wow! I had two "golden lattes" (turmeric, cinnamon and steamed almond milk) which was so deliciously smooth! I've never had this before and getting two days a lot! I also had delicious multigrain toast with the freshest cream cheese and lemony lox on top. I am so glad my friend suggested meeting here as I've never been to this chain before but would love to come back. Additionally, this is a relatively small coffee shop but the wait staff was able to accommodate my friend with a stroller so easily. I wasn't sure it would happen during Sunday brunch but they made it seem effortless. Yum yum yum!
2018-03-04,2,Service this afternoon at bluestone was a nightmare Servers were short staffed and the young lady who was our server looked as if it was her first week on the job! Highly unorganized and chaotic experience. I was tempted to pick up my own drink from the bar as I could see it sitting there getting cold!!Service needs work at the hoboken location- get it together you have been open for several months now
2018-03-02,5,Excellent coffee, good healthy bites, nice decor, and a friendly, accommodating staff. Recommend highly.
2018-02-11,4,The feel and decor of this cafeÃÅ is superb. A bit pricy for tea and coffee but a great place to catch up with a friend over a hot drink and small pastry.
2018-02-03,2,Underwhelming and expensive. Avocado toast did not taste fresh and the Lorne green juice had too much ice in the glass. With so many places to brunch in Hoboken, spend your time and money elsewhere.
2018-01-20,5,Such a cute coffee place. Love the decor and vibes. Ordered a cappuccino and it was made perfectly. I always love going to aussie cafes because they make the best coffee. No australian accents though which is a bummer. But nice to see the menu items named after local suburbs. Makes me feel like im in melbourne for a little while.
2018-01-20,3,Cute place, nicely decorated& waitstaff are super friendly. However the menu is EXTREMELY limited only about 10 items total. Also chairs (or should I say stools) are super uncomfortable & tables are on top of each other. I went there for a relaxing brunch experience but it's more like healthy fast food. The avocado toast was fresh & delicious but needed salt. All in all, food is good if you find something you like on the menu but definitely not a place to relax & spend time.
2018-01-17,1,Don't waste your time and money. food is tasteless and  takes forever to get. We got our breakfast bowl half an hour later than other meal, plus without egg (water was boiling too long) and still got charged for it.
2018-01-14,4,Cute little cafe, plenty of seating, nice view by the window and friendly waiter! Coffee was fresh, good flavor profile. For a busy place the staff was attentive and food came out quick! Fresh ingredients, tasty combinations! Portion size was appropriate wasn't overly filling and you wont leave hungry!
2018-01-13,4,I was invited back by the owners and had a great experience. The service was good, very attentive and brought out everything at the same time and exactly as I ordered it. The food was delicious as it usually is and they had gluten free toast (yay!). I would definitely come back here.
2017-12-31,5,My favourite Bluestone location, and a weekend staple of mine! There really isn't anything that compares to a good Aussie coffee. The magic is always strong, a perfect way to kick off the weekend's activities. I've worked my way through the menu, having tried around three quarters of what they have to offer. Depending on your level of hunger, and inclination to eat healthy, there's plenty to choose from. My go to options are the avocado toast with a poached egg, the granola with unreal lemon curd and berries, and the breakfast bowl which is bursting full of fresh goodness. If your first brunch course leaves you wanting a little more, the almond butter and raspberry jam toast is the perfect little dessert to finish off with. On another note, my girlfriend basically lives for the salmon, cream cheese toast with a side of the heirloom tomatoes. For any fish-lovers, this is definitely a great option. If you're heading down on the weekend (especially when the weather is good), make sure you stop by in the late morning, rather than the afternoon since it gets extremely busy!
2017-12-15,4,My new favorite coffee shop, friendly staff, good drink selection, interesting food menu and a nice clean bright atmosphere, can get a little child rich, as in screaming kids and wonderful mums but that's Hoboken..... I was very impressed by the selection of gluten free pastries by the till be sure to check them out. Lastly they are cash free so cards only.
2017-12-12,5,Soy Chia Latte is creamy & decadent with a swirl of cinnamon flavor. This could be a dessert! Employees were all very friendly. My new favorite chia in Hoboken!
2017-11-11,2,Coffee is good but everything is over priced. I ordered 2 eggs on gluten free toast and small coffee - $15. But they couldn't get the bread to toast. Tried 3 different toasters and none worked. So essentially 2 poached (which were also cold because they made the eggs before the struggle with the toast) for $15. I probably could have brunch somewhere for not much more than this. And they don't take cash?? To me that is ridiculous especially if you're only getting a cup of coffee.
2017-11-11,4,Their Mocha is the best. Its my go to places on weekends. I like the sweet potato hummus toast or the salmon one. Its fun to sit outside during a nice and warm day . Must try the mocha..
2017-11-05,5,My new favorite coffee shop in Hoboken. I've not tried the food in this location but I really like their coffee, it's very balanced and never tastes bitter or burnt. The location of this cafe is spot on, it's on a block of Washington Street that has a fair amount of foot traffic so it's fun to sit on their terrace and people watch. The servers are always friendly. Be warned they don't take cash here, it's card only which seems to be becoming something of a trend - I don't mind but it could inconvenience you if you're not aware of it.
2017-11-05,5,Loved this place! Smaller place, be prepared to sit snug with the people around you but it's week worth it for a quick stop or sit down breakfast. Delicious, fresh, thoughtful food.
2017-10-27,5,Such a great vibe and amazing service... Menu is fabulous and the coffee is top notch!!!
2017-10-20,5,Their reputation precedes them and sets a high standard - they did not disappoint!!!Love the decor and space... The staff was helpful and so nice! Everything is so good on the menu! The kind of place that you're already excited for your next visit. :)Faves -Matcha Latte Torquay JuiceAvocado toast with tomato & goat cheeseHighly recommend!
2017-10-17,5,Such a cute place and great addition to Hoboken! Love the avocado toast! Also stroller friendly which is always a plus!
2017-10-17,5,I love coming here for a flat white and any of their toast options! Inside is spacious, well-lit and very instagram-friendly, with beachy posters and succulents on light wooden shelves. Service is always prompt and friendly.  Wonderful place for a leisurely catch up with a friend or to get a little work done.
2017-10-11,2,Paid over $4 for a large coffee that was the same size as a small at most places.  Nothing special. They don't except cash either which doesn't make any sense. The customer service is very good. But the entire menu is over priced. And coffee is mediocre.
2017-09-16,4,A welcome addition to Washington street. Good coffee and service. And they are pet-friendly which is always a plus.
2017-09-15,2,Where do I begin. This place is ridiculously expensive and i only ordered a tea?! What are they sourcing their ingredients from mars or something?The taste isnt even great if I am paying a premium I would at least expect perfection.I am not that interested in these new age coffee shops that charge an arm and a leg for something like tea/coffee. I wish the place luck but i wont be going there.
2017-09-10,5,Had a great experience here. The staff is really friendly and the food is delicious! We got their homemade granola, banana bread, and avocado toast. I highly suggest the tumeric latte, it's the best I've ever had!
2017-09-03,4,The coffee was amazing. Fancy lattes with beautiful milk swirls is their specialty. I had the matcha latte and wifey had the tumeric latte. Both were very good. The toast with avocado spread was aite... but we're here for coffee. It's the kind of light fare the ladies really enjoy. My wifey would've given this joint 5 stars. I'm a meat eater so I cannot do that. Server was really friendly too. Props... good chain.
2017-09-02,5,Great place! The avocado toast and zucchini loaf were both amazing. The Fitzroy juice was delicious and the loose green tea was fancy. They have many great toast options and I really wish I lived around any of the Bluestone Lane locations and could come back more often. There's a few tables on the patio but I sat inside and loved the decorations and music.
2017-08-29,4,I don't really know how I feel about a coffee place closing so early at 6pm, but we stopped by around 5:30 for some drinks and the service was very nice and didn't pressure us to leave or anything. They were also super helpful about which drinks to try. The iced chai latte was delish, it's always a hit or miss with chai lattes but theirs were perfect. Didn't get to try any of their food, but the atmosphere of the tables and decor is whimsical and I would come back to dine for brunch!
2017-08-26,3,No..As soon as we walked in too many fries flying around the cafe and it wasn't the perfect place to sit and enjoy coffee.We had very welcoming cashier but, besides that nothing great about this cafe.Coffee was too blend, no character.Interior was too cold...I felt like I was standing in bathhouse.
2017-08-24,5,I'm upgrading my original reviewFrom 3 to 5. My original review was after just a few weeks of bluestone opening and they had some kinks to work out. The owner nick cares about the business and responded to feedback. I've been back a few times now and wow what a difference. Table service, more food options, and all around great experience.
2017-08-22,5,This is by far my favorite cafe in town. The staff creates the absolute best experience and the drinks and food are amazing. You feel like you are visiting your friends. Jason takes the time to truly make each drink for each person. He gets to know you and will give suggestions on new drinks to try! Juan always makes everyone feel so welcome and will definitely put a smile on your face. I am impressed each and every time I visit. I would recommend Bluestone to every person out there. If you're looking for healthy and delicious food, the avocado toast is my favorite, or a great juice/coffee. This is the place to go! I am glad you're in Hoboken now!
2017-08-19,4,Nice place for healthy breakfast. Good drinks and nice atmospheres. The waiters are friendly and knowledgeable. I really like the avocado toast
2017-08-13,5,Best cafe experience ever! The coffee and treats are amazing and the barista and staff are great! Gem in hoboken!!
2017-08-12,1,No soap in the restroom with busy brunch crowd. Unacceptably gross. They are across the street from a 7-11. Someone should prioritize running across the street.
2017-08-06,4,I bumped into this small little Aussie breakfast place unplanned - but glad I did.  The place has a small menu, comprised mostly of variety of toasts and beverages. I ordered Salmon toast with poached eggs, which was very tasty and fresh. My wife got an avocado toast, which she absolutely loved and said "best avocado toast she has ever had" (she uses these superlative terms pretty often, so I would discount it a bit ).We both had latte which was very good.Generally the quantity is less and service is slow. But I would visit again.
2017-08-05,5,Great restraUnt great service great waitress vida  and great food and great vibe and great tea  and  coffe
2017-08-02,5,West here for the first time this weekend and it was AMAZING. Best avocado toast I've ever had and the beet latte was absolutely amazing.
2017-07-26,4,Love this place! A girlfriend brought me here while visiting Hoboken. In a great location right on Washington St. surrounded by tons of shopping. I should enjoyed the Fitzroy, delicious fresh squeezed juice pineapple, ginger, grapefruit and lime-yum! My friend and I shared the toast with almond butter and bananas, would highly recommend!
2017-07-23,5,Had a wonderful experience at Bluestone Lane this morning. We had just finished a long run and had our dog with us so wanted a casual, quick healthy bite to eat with coffee. We were able to snag a seat on the patio so the dog could join. I ordered the quinoa bowl which hit the spot! Perfect flavors combinations and extremely satisfying while staying healthy. My boyfriend got the salmon toast which I didn't think would be enough food for him but he left full and also said it was amazing. We both loved our iced coffees too! Can't wait to go back!
2017-07-17,5,Come here once a week. The food is fresh and tasty. Service is impeccable. Had a great chat with Vidya who is as sweet as all the other servers. Always leave here with a smile on my face :)
2017-07-11,5,This place is hands down the best coffee shop in hoboken. I'm a big fan of a nice strong robust latte and this place nails it. The espresso is probably one of the best I've ever had (I drink bustello and lavazza regularly and wow this stuff is strong) besides the amazing beverages I have to say the staff is my favorite part of bluestone. Im always greeted with a smile and I feel like everyone there knows me by name. Even if the coffee was terrible (which it absolutely isn't!) I would continue to go there just for the hospitality. My wife and I are expecting and after every doctors appointment we stop by bluestone for a drink. By now these guys know how many weeks she is, what her cravings are and when her next sonogram is! They're basically family at this point lol. Peace, Love & Ice CreamAnthony
2017-07-11,5,This isn't your traditional coffee shop but is one of the best places to get coffee in Hoboken. I tried their cold brew which is some of the best iced coffee I've had in Hoboken. If you want something new and good definitely check it out.
2017-07-11,5,5 stars hands down! Amazing coffee and amazing food, employees always there to satisfy! As a Hoboken resident, I'll be a regular for sure.
2017-07-11,5,I started coming to Bluestone right as it opened and have been here for breakfast at least three times a week. Primarily because the people are so friendly and they keep people moving so it is quick if you are looking to take your food to go. The cold brew is the best I've found in this part of town, and they don't charge for almond milk, which is a huge plus for me since I am off dairy right now. I am currently addicted to their almond oatmeal. It is full of nuts, coconut, etc making it filling and so delicious. Also in my rotation is the smoked salmon toast...amazing. The accents of dill and olive oil make it totally worth it!
2017-07-10,5,So so cute!! Love it!One of my favorite place for an avocado toast, and incredible staff!!
2017-07-09,5,This is one of my favorite cafes in the area. I'm so glad it's close to home now. I've had the avocado toast at the west village location before and it was delicious. Fresh bread, hearty avocados and delectable toppings such as feta. At the Hoboken location, I had order and go of one of my favorite espresso drinks "magic" It's a unbeatable mix of rich espresso and just the right amount of milk. So delicious, rich and not bitter! So 5 / 5 on the food and drinks.Service was impeccable. It wasn't super busy when I went on late Sunday afternoon. No line for ordering on the go. The staff was super nice and efficient with my order.The cafe decor is super cute. A lot of white and blue similar to the Bluestone Lane logo. The location is fairly large and spacious and they have order seating when the weather is nice out!Highly recommend this authentic Australian cafe! Can't wait to stop by to try the wellness lattes and other food offerings!
2017-07-08,5,Really great upgraded coffee shop with lots of healthy and innovative options!  I love their toasts and have tried a lot of them: ab&j; avocado + the lot; banana with honey & cinnamon; salmon toast.  I've also tried their iced lattes, iced chai, and the iced milo. YUM! Be prepared to wait a bit, as it DOES get pretty crazy in there, especially on the weekends.  Much better to plan to sit than to take out.  But the staff is kind and accommodating and it's a nice addition to Washington Street and rises far above the "commercial" coffee spots on Washington Street like Starbucks, Panera, or Dunkin.  I'm definitely a repeat customer!
2017-07-08,5,As an Australian, coming here feels like a little piece of home. The combined smell of fresh lamingtons and piping hot flat whites brings me back to the days of soaking up the Aussie sun in Queensland. I've been here a couple of times now and one of the things that sets this place apart from the rest of the cafes in the area is the genuinely friendly service. Our server Juan, made us feel very welcomed and was very accommodating to our needs. Would definitely recommend this place to all my mates!
2017-07-04,3,Woah, all these white walls weren't the only things reminding me of my stint at the insane asylum. The prices are ok for joints like this, until you get the food. The salmon toast was tasty, and the poached egg was a little overcooked but I like to watch mine bleed. I just wish for these prices/portions, they'd combine items. The music was good too, not this new age crap they play at La Dee Dah Coffee shop.My server was very friendly. Not like Dr. Winterblack who beat me, but very much like Nurse Summers - she's was real pretty. She spotted me an extra cup of coffee. I think she thought I was super cute but too intimidated to say anything about it.
2017-07-04,5,Delicious! The magic coffee and Avocado toast with tomatoes and an egg. Tomatoes tasted home grown, perfectly ripe! Friendly staff and cute atmosphere!
2017-06-30,5,Great place to hangout people watch, catch up with friends and mostly enjoy great coffee. Starbucks beware: there is a new coffee sheriff in town and it will make a dent into your 'coffee mafia-empire' you have unleashed in Hoboken. Good luck bluestone
2017-06-29,5,I know, I know...yet another overpriced trendy cafe with too much a hype. BUT, that's wrong. I'm sorry, but my past two experiences here at Bluestone Lane have proven to me that this place is worth returning to. While items on the menu are indeed pricey, and the cheapest add ones are tomatoes and radishes at 1.50 a piece, any of the employees will gladly explain that this is due to the fact that everything is locally sourced and baked daily.Beware! There's no wifi! There explanation is that they are trying to build an "Aussie atmosphere", to encourage customers and employees a like to part ways with their technology and enjoy one another's company. One of the waiters explained to me that as part of their business model, they've had interactions with CEOs and the like because this business is really trying to build a family. Thus far I've ordered Banana Toast and Avocado Toast with vegemite and feta. I've also ordered a large iced chai tea. This was my first time trying Balthazar bread and was extremely impressed. You may think the portions are small, but trust me, it's the perfect size. I'm stuffed every time! The chai tea was delicious as well. The staff are genuinely nice, polite, friendly...you name it. Really, it's not forced whatsoever. They're not pushy or standoffish or seem like they're trying so hard. I don't know how to explain it. And if you want to be left alone, have no fear! I brought my book and was only interrupted by someone picking up my finished plate and a waiter making a joke to ask if I'd like more. Coming here and you'll notice the relaxed welcoming vibe. Yes, its inconvenient that the menu is in the back, but I've yet to come and see it extremely busy in which you'd have to fight your way to see the menu as some other reviews have described. Honestly, give this place a shot. It's well worth it!
2017-06-28,3,Hoboken location may just be going through growing pains. I've been a fan of Blustone lane since they opened their location in the West Village. My experience there has always been great. After waiting a while to place our orders for coffee, avacado toast and breakfast bowl, we had to wait even longer to get it. My avacado toast came out with completely overcooked poached egg, so did the egg in the breakfast bowl. After offering to remake the order of an avacado toast the waitress left and never came back. Waited over 30 min without anyone checking. Eventually, we had to ask someone inside to take the food off our bill and leave to go eat somewhere else. Hoping this was a one time experience at this location.
2017-06-28,5,I absolutely love this place. Sometimes it can be packed with a line out the door but it's because they have some of the best coffee and service in Hoboken.If you are hungry sit and try the salmon toast with a poached egg!
2017-06-17,5,Great place to get an aussie style brunch!Lamington was amazing. Flat white has room for improvement!
2017-06-16,5,Such an amazing cafe with staff that really go above and beyond to make sure you feel welcome! I went for brunch with a friend and they remembered our order from the last time we visited. They really know everything that goes into their food, which made me feel good about what I was eating. I ended up getting the oatmeal, which had cashews, almond milk and fresh fruit on top. (So yummy!) They even cared to throw in an extra cup full of blueberries because I mentioned briefly in a conversation how much I liked them. What a great addition to the cafe scene in Hoboken!
2017-06-09,2,If you think going to the new small coffee shop will save you a few bucks off Starbucks you'd be wrong. Plus they don't take cash. Very odd.   Even more odd? One size coffee. It's smaller than a grande and $3.  Just go to Starbucks.
2017-06-08,2,Was really looking forward to this place. Took the avocado toast. Wasn't impressed. Was expecting a burst of flavors. Got an espresso coffee and tasted pretty ordinary. Again I was expecting something different, something that would shout out to be completely mind blowing. I will go back to try the salmon toast though!
2017-06-05,4,Really enjoyed my food here. I got 2 of the avocado toasts as well as a quinoa bowl. A little disappointed with the amount of food you get in the bowl for the price but overall really good. If i could give 4 and a half stars I would. The service was amazing (even on a decently busy Saturday) and the food came out in a timely manner.
2017-06-05,2,Went in for a latte this last week and felt like I was being rushed by the person taking my order. The latte wasn't that hot and I asked for them to make it hotter the barista seemed to be upset and grabbed the drink out of my hand suddenly. He gave me an obvious inconvenience look. I was shocked by the horrible customer service-especially because they are new and that there are other great coffee shops in town. Will not be back.
2017-06-04,5,This place is my second home and the staff has become my second family. The cold brew, matcha and tea is perfection! I have devoured the avocado toast, lamingtons and Market Bowl, all excellent. I can spend hours here reading, relaxing and enjoying coffee nirvana. I will forever be a customer here and am so happy to have a new go to. The staff is warm, cheery and love to get to know you. Literally I have never felt more at home than at this place. They truly go above and beyond in every way. Much love - Amanda
2017-05-31,4,Definitely different. Vegetarians, vegans and healthy eaters need to visit. Outstanding customer service. Told them it was our first time visiting, I am obviously a carnivore lol and they were very patient explaining everything. A great change from eating heavy unhealthy food all the time.
2017-05-31,5,The place is spotless, brightly lit, and modern in decor, with warm and inviting service. Succulents and fresh bright flowers dot the premises tastefully. The coffee latte was full bodied, rich and deep in flavor, smooth and nonacidic as great coffee should be. The 'flat white' coffee is similar but deeper in aroma and flavor and tastes more caffeinated per rich, creamy sip. The salmon toast was a work of perfection: the salmon was medium thickness, outstanding in quality, and plentiful. It was placed atop the almost equal thickness fresh Balthazar bread (which was a hearty and a good 3/4 inch thick slice), like wavelets of sea upon sand. For the first time in my life, the ratio seemed correct as the salmon was not only delicious in quality but so much of it; no skimping here. The fresh dill and the thin layer of cream cheese which tasted homemade, soft and fresh, with a medium richness and slight tartness balanced the entire dish.  The salmon toast can easily become addictive.
2017-05-31,5,This magical Australian coffee shop has the best coffee drinks and amazing eats. I tried the classic avocado toast which of course is delicious. My coworker ordered the smashed pea and coconut yoghurt toast and OH BOY was that delicious. I'm going back just to order that. Keep in mind, we went there to eat and get some work done but there is no wifi. Even still, a wonderful place for a caffeinated drink and some tasty fresh fare.
2017-05-28,5,Been here for sit-down service 6 times during the week and enjoyed it every time.  Their variety of toasts is awesome (Smashed Pea Toast with Coconut milk Yogurt??!).  Their coffee roast is very good and I enjoy their flat whites. I find the service  to be speedy and efficient. Since they are cashless, the waitstaff just swipes on their little handheld device and you are ready to go - no papers, no waiting for them to return after disappearing with your card.  A good edition to Hoboken, especially in that location.
2017-05-27,4,pretty good brunch with cold brew!! It was Avocado toast . Nice to have this one in this holiday season.
2017-05-26,2,The issue I have with this store isn't with the personality of the wait staff or barista (which i thought were doing their best and had great personality) or the quality of their products but the service that is provided by this coffee shop. I have gone to this store a little more than half a dozen times over the last two months just to try it out and see if there are improvements(as it is a new store) but each time I go I am just so disappointed by the turnout of events. **Just for reference, I only go for their take out service not their sit-down/dine-in service.** Anyways, every time I go I end up waiting at least 8-10 minutes for 1 beverage order. Today was my limit, I waited 10 minutes before I turned to wait staff and asked them to check on my aussie iced latte. She told me she would go check to see was going on and as she left I watched her go into the back room and later bring out the cup with the scoop of ice cream and hand it off to the barista--so basically my order wasn't even on the list of coffee to be made. This wasn't an issue with the barista but the process that this Blue Stone uses to serve their customers. I saw this happen to the two couples in front of me who waited what seems to be 15-20 minutes for their coffee and their toast. All the people who had been waiting for takeout had been waiting at least as long as I had and more. This coffee shop was churning out coffee for their sit down customers before even touching the takeout ones. And basically everyone in take out was asking the waitstaff where their orders were, not because they were being fussy or impatient but because waiting 10-15+ minutes for a single order is kinda ridiculous. I've been to coffee shops all over hoboken (bwe, starbucks, DD, empire, bean vault, choco-o-pain) franchisees and cafe style and have never experienced this kind of pain to get my coffee in the morning. In my experience normally people who are getting take out are in more of a rush that people who are sitting down for a meal~ but that's just my opinion. I don't have enough time int the morning to sit down at this place and I surely can't be waiting 10+ minutes for takeout coffee. I'm overall constantly disappointed in this place and would "maybe" recommend their sit down but i can't say for sure that they get better service except from what I can observe. If I wanted to wait 10+ minutes to get service I would sit down and have a meal. I think what they can improve on is how they process their take out orders- maybe have a separate barista or staff make the food and meals. Also maybe if they see their customers standing around for 10+ minutes ask them if they're still waiting on something (I'm not just standing there as a spectator).Final remarks: This isn't a bwe or a choco-o-pain or a starbucks....at best it's just a cafe that serves food and coffee that also has an option to get take out but def. only offers the functionality of a cafe and not a coffee shop. Don't come here in the morning if you want to be served in a timely manner (I've tried that about 7 times and it's not worth it)
2017-05-21,1,WARNING do not eat here! Yes this look yummy but tasted awful. Our service was horrible and really do hate complaining about stuff like this but the food was spoiled which ended up in my boyfriend having extremely severe FOOD POISONING  The managed Stephanie was kind enough to comp our meal but that does not excuse how such he is.  We will not be going back. Also after trying to call the location 4 times to warn them about potentially making other customers sick no one answered.
2017-05-21,5,Aussie brunch is banging!  That's a very well established point by the wellness aficionados, avocado lovers and the coffee connoisseurs! Like all Bluestone locations that I've been to, this spot has an upscale beachy vibe with bright and clean space. This is such a refreshing addition to Hoboken, albeit slightly disorganized when they first opened. They didn't provide waiter service then and pick-up counter didn't run smoothly. But I've been back here and the service has improved & been nothing short of commendable. I see they've taken constructive criticisms well. :-) Staff is super friendly and the managers are accommodating. No wifi, but you'll get over it. Geotag doesn't exist (only accessible by the business owner) but you'll get over it.Avocado toast is solid, as expected. Salmon toast is served with a generous portion of fresh salmon with cream cheese on a multigrain bread, garnished with dill (so dill-icious)!  Plating and food presentation deserve an applause! Excellent selection of beverages, especially the wellness drinks. Also, you can never go wrong with the Flat White. Ever. I must say, they are on top of their game! This location, however, has limited brunch menu selection. They do need to expand their menu. Seasonal menu is always a great option.Bring forth the Brekkie board. Hoboken can handle it!
2017-05-20,5,Such a great addition to Hoboken! The avocado toast was delicious and the staff is friendly and helpful.
2017-05-16,5,AMAZING!!!! Exactly what Hoboken needed!  The staff is amazing and the food is outstanding! It is super cute inside and I will be coming back for sure on a weekly basis!Love,Kelly O'Neill
2017-05-15,5,The staff, the food, the coffee all deserve 5 stars. Hoboken is a better place after this little impeccable spot. While I'm always sad that there's no wifi, if there were, I would never get a seat because the loafers would chill all day.
2017-05-09,4,My girlfriend knew about this place before they opened up here since she spent a semester abroad in Australia.  She kept saying how good it is and couldn't wait for it to open.Took a week after they actually opened for us to go because we didn't want to have to wait on line out the door.  It was still super crowded when we went so sounds like they were doing well!I ordered a coffee and toast with almond butter, bananas and I think honey?  It took a looong time to come out but they were still new and probably figuring things out so we didn't mind.  Everyone there seemed to be from Australia so it was a nice touch that it felt authentic and not just another coffee shop in Hoboken...The toast was AMAZING and ridiculously filling.  I will definitely be back.  The only reason for the 4* and not 5* was because of the wait and that the layout seems not fully thought out.  Although it's a small space, the seating and the line were all smushed together.
2017-05-02,2,Just left. I came into Bluestone to do some studying and get some work done. After about 5 minutes of standing at the "Please wait to be seated" sign I decided to walk up to the counter and order a coffee. After paying, I asked if it was alright to grab a seat. I was told I'd have to switch out my to-go cup for a ceramic mug (seems like a waste but whatever). I go to sit down at a table not wanting to take up any space, when all of a sudden a waiter walks up and tells me it's table service only. Anyways he points me over to the side bar where I was happy to reside, except the manager had occupied a few seats doing work and his napkins occupied the other stools.After taking a seat at a middle table I realized that there was no wifi, which makes it hard to handle work and/or study, so I took off, with what was now a cold cup of Aussie coffee (back in paper w/no lid) and a bad taste in my mouth.Likely won't be back to the Hoboken one anytime soon, which is a shame because I enjoy the Carmine St location. Kind of a bummer considering the fact that it is around the corner from my house.
2017-05-01,4,Its funny that everyone is complaining about a place with no WiFi. God forbid you have to actually sit somewhere and be present, observe your surroundings, pay attention to your food or friends. You're saying they need WiFi but you also say you want to pay cash. Maybe this is a lesson in flexibility.Yes, this place is new so it definitely has operational kinks to figure out, much like a few other new places in Hoboken. The cluster of people waiting for drinks in the back was mayhem, and there didn't seem to be anyone in charge. That being said, I had great service at one of the tables, the food was excellent (for Hoboken, especially,) and paying at the table in 30 seconds was key to the experience. I hope they sort out their processes because the product is good.
2017-04-24,5,So happy to see Bluestone Lane open up in Hoboken, great fresh quality food with good service. Keep it clean and we will keep coming back.
2017-04-21,2,Edit: I gave Bluestone Lane another chance because I heard amazing things about their avocado toast on Instagram. They must give Instagram influencers better treatment than their customers because mine barely had any cheese, sprouts, or tomatoes. I also tried the sparkling lemonade which basically tasted like glorified water. PLUS I still don't get how a sparkling lemonade size is bigger than their coffee size? I'm still not sold. The GF bread was pretty good so I'll still leave it at 2 stars, but I won't be back.I was really excited to see that another coffee shop was opening in Hoboken. I had no idea that this was a chain that migrated over from NYC, but I'm not surprised given my experience. I decided to go in and try a green tea latte (my favorite) for the first time, and I'm a little disappointed that the portions are so low in comparison to the pricing. They also don't take cash, which is a beyond bizarre business practice. It felt a little snooty, which is a vibe you typically do not feel in other coffee shops in town like Empire and bwe. In some ways, I feel like I wasted my money, so I'm probably not going to be back for more.
2017-04-18,3,I was very excited to try out Bluestone Lane. Since I work from home I'm always looking for fun spots to work out of around town for an hour or so. The unfortunate thing about Bluestone and the reason I did not give it 5 stars is they do not have Wifi. For being a cafe style place, this is super disappointing and seems like a miss. The cold brew and food was delicious, but without wifi, it is not somewhere I will likely go that often which I would have if they did have wifi.
2017-04-17,4,5/1/17Update!I decided to give this place another try because as I mentioned, the food was really good the first time I went. I must say that the place has definitely improved in just a few short weeks - they definitely had a lot more staff seating people, taking order, making drinks, and bringing food out to the customers. My husband got the Avocado Salmon Toast with an Aussie Iced Latte (which had a scoop of vanilla ice cream - delicious!) and I got an Avocado Toast with the Chai Latte. I must say, this place has some of the best Chai Latte around not to mention they give you a hefty portion of avocado with spices on the Avocado Toast. Because they had more people helping out, our order came out in a timely manner and came out correctly even though the place was packed. I will definitely be back here because everything is delicious and the place itself is really cute - would definitely recommend! 4/15/17Pros: -Awesome decor (bright and minimalistic)-Sufficient seating but can get crowded just like it did on Easter weekend-Serve coffee in cute mason jars if you get it for here/to stay-Avocado toast was really delicious and flavorful Cons: -The barista seems like he has no idea what he is doing - he kept missing orders and rushing through all of them while making a mess on the counter -I had to wait 20 minutes for my iced chocolate - one of the cashier ladies apologized for this and was nice about it but the guy who was making the drinks still didn't make mine for another 10 minutes (at which point I got up and stood next to him)-No names on receipt so it's hard to figure out which order is who's (causing lots of confusion)-Operationally not streamlined very well....might be because this is new/just opened I would probably go back again because the coffee and avocado toast were delicious but I really hope they clean up their process a bit and get a new barista!
2017-04-17,2,Food and drinks are good, but prices are steep and there is NO WIFI. Nor are there plans to ever have wifi. Truly confusing in a town filled with entrepreneurs and students!
2017-04-17,5,My wife and I stopped by after a long run and had coffee and some food. She had the breakfast bowl, and I had the Salmon Toast; both were awesome. Very happy this opened up in Hoboken. Good luck.
2017-04-16,2,Bluestone Lane did an excellent job building hype for their Hoboken location.  I've been following them on Instagram and patiently waiting for their opening.  It's a gorgeous Easter Sunday and everyone is out and about.  It's the perfect time to visit Bluestone Lane.The cafeÃÅ is very, very cute but execution is poor and frustrating.The layout - the menu is only located on the back wall so while you're waiting on line its hard to know what the options are.  What was similarly frustrating is the lack of garbage receptacles.  They are located only at the counter of milk.  This is used by the baristas as well as guests, and if you are eating-in, you have to squeeze through the crowds back at the counter to throw out your trash.  The music was super loud by the register as well so you could barely hear yourself think.  Lastly, the flow is just off.  You wait in line to pay at the back of the store.  Then you have to fight through the crowd to wait for your order, which comes out near the back of the line.  It's just a mess.The prices - They had promoted a BOGO deal on social media.  At the counter, she tells me I need a flyer in order to redeem the deal, and there may or may not be some at the front of the cafeÃÅ.  Okay...so we forgo the deal.  It's also confusing that their menu only has one price, but the cashier encourage you to get a large which is more costly; the prices should be clearer on the menu so you aren't caught flat-footed at the register.  That leads to the next point, the drinks are pricey.  For the cost of our two drinks ($11+ for a large cold brew and a large aussie iced latte), we could have had two trenta frappucinos at Starbucks.The drinks - The cold brew was average.  When it came out, there was an inch of room on the top of the cup so we had to ask them to top it off.  We had our hopes up for the aussie iced latte but it was 90% milk, a little espresso, and a scoop of ice cream.  If you like drinking cold milk, get this.Love our local shops but won't be back here for a while.
2017-04-11,5,Bluestone Lane gives a great first impression, but what's even better is the innovation that they have with their coffee while keeping it pure and health conscious.This is an absolutely bright and warm little cafe that graces Hoboken.  I walked in and was immediately greeted as well as had my questions answered about their roots and where they get their beans from without hesitation.  While it is abbot of a small space they have maximized the shared table space for a cute hangout inside and outside of the shop.Now to the coffee! I was surprised reading their menu to find a Long Black (similar to an americano) and a Golden Latte (their own creation).  With my interest peaked they gave me the rundown on their Golden Latte which include cayenne, cinnamon, turmeric, and coconut sugar (which is low on the glycemic index).  Well this was right up my ally especially with the almond milk.  Not only was this Latte creamy it was Golden AND of course delicious!  I was super impressed with putting the time doc in coffee especially with the health benefits You can check out my pictures.  So far they get an A+ for service, atmosphere, and creativity.
2017-04-11,5,Went there on the grand opening and enjoyed the signature flat white. Will definitely go back again!
