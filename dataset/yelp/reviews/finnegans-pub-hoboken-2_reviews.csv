2021-11-15,5,Great neighborhood bar with really great food. Pleasant staff and always a good scene. Have tvs outside which is a nice touch. The french fries are soo soo good!
2021-03-09,4,Try the Reuben Sliders! Thank me later wow!Came here for some drinks and simple bar food for the night. I enjoyed the great atmosphere of the restaurant, everyone was very social and seemed to know each other! It's a pretty standard Irish bar. We had ordered the mild wings which were pretty tasty and as expected for bar food. The bangers and mash was pretty good, I was glad that the menu had offered some more Irish specific cuisine. However let me save you some time, get the Reuben sliders...wow! The buns are buttered and toasted to perfection, paired with the gooey cheese and tender corned beef. My jaw actually dropped as I bit in. I definitely will be coming back for some more good times...and some more sliders.
2020-10-23,4,Finnegan's Pub is really the quintessential neighborhood bar.  Its loyal crowd of repeat visitors loves to enjoy the fun and laidback atmosphere.  The unassuming space also has a surprisingly good craft beer list and delicious food.  On our recent visit, we sat in their sidewalk cafe that was crowded with patrons (though everyone had a seat) watching football on televisions that were projecting out to us.  We ordered pints of Kane Head High, one of our favorite NJ beers, and enjoyed the game.  There were also several customers with their dogs, which kept us entertained as well.  After relaxing there for a bit, we started to get hungry.  In the past, we had liked their food, so we decided to stay there for our dinner.  Previously, I had ordered a salad with grilled chicken, which had been fabulous, but was not on their new, more limited menu.  So, instead, I ordered the Cajun Chicken Wrap, which included Cajun-seasoned, grilled chicken breast, mixed greens, and pico de gallo.  I had left off the chipotle mayonnaise, leaving the sandwich a tad dry.  However, I had asked for a side of honey mustard to accompany my hand-cut fries, so I also put some of that on the wrap, which was a terrific addition.  The sandwich had been toasted in a panini press, giving it a crunch that I appreciated.  My boyfriend also enjoyed his Shepherd's Pie, which was topped with fluffy mashed potatoes.Finnegan's Pub is a fantastic place to spend a casual evening with friends.  Whether you are eating some of their delicious food, sampling a  local brew, or playing a few of their bar games, you are sure to have a great time!
2020-09-11,5,Great small bar that now has outdoor seating setup with barstool seating. Some nights they have live music as well!
2020-03-14,5,Best Irish pub in Hoboken. They have pool, darts, and skee ball. The food is really good  and bartenders are great. Love coming to this neighborhood gem for a drink.
2020-01-24,5,This place is awesome when you come ask for Erin she is the tall beauty she is attentive and great a def must got to for a chill low kEy night
2020-01-23,4,Good beer, live bands, pool table, dart boards, and great for any type of sports games... what's not to love? Finnegans is quickly climbing my proverbial ladder of go to pubs for all the reasons listed above. I've deleted beers here on a few occassions with the buds, and I'm looking forward to putting Finnegans in the rotation more frequent.
2019-12-30,5,I came here on a Sunday and it was very busy, popular place in Hoboken to grab a good drink and food. Even though the restaurant was crowded the service was great. We sat at a table and our waitress Erin was so friendly and patient with us. Usually come in for the live music, which is always fun! Def my go to in Hoboken
2019-12-01,1,Regarding Monica H's reply. You have SEVERAL complaints relevant to your bartenders and their treatment of your customers, from before my visit there. You're well aware of the issue, and how you can improve, please save the generic customer service talk for someone else. It's clear you have no interest in addressing the issues that have been raised multiple times. Just to be painfully clear, and so there's no misunderstanding, your bartenders are an issue and you've absolutely lost customers because of them. Regarding 'Mike' not being the owner, that's another issue, as you must have employees masquerading as other people. Something you should look into, as I was directed to speak to that "gentleman" by a kitchen worker, claiming he was the one in charge that night. There are a dozen superior bars in this town that don't treat their (well-paying) customers like dirt, I have zero reason to want to enter your establishment again. Good luck with everything.
2019-11-26,5,Can't believe I haven't reviewed Finnegan's ! There are endless bars in Hoboken but I find myself returning to Finnegan's again and again because of how great it is. What really sets this pub apart from the many others is the music. Finnegan's almost always has a live band on Friday and Saturday night, and the band is always good. You can usually expect to hear something funky / jammy. Think lots of Grateful Dead covers. I'm here for it. When live music is not playing they pump great alternative rock jams through the speakers. Live or not, it's impossible to hear bad music. There are also lots of fun games to keep you occupied. They've got skeeball up on the second floor and there is a back room on the first floor with pool / darts. The space is small but it's cozy. It's usually not hard to find a spot or get a drink by the bar. It seems small from the outside but because of the second floor and back game room there is space to spread out.I've never eaten here. In fact, I've probably never ordered anything other than a bud light or a tequila shot. But if you are craving any classic greasy bar food they'll hook you up.Great music and a cozy and cheery ambiance keep Finnegan's at the tippy top of my list for bars in Hoboken.
2019-08-24,4,Finnegan's is a solid local pub. The topical drinks you'd expect with down to earth bartenders. What sets it apart are the skeeballs on the second floor, the roomy dart boards in the back, and the exceptional chicken wings that go for $0.50 each Tuesday. My one and only complaint is that they got to do something about the mosquitos plaguing the back room this summer; they're eating me alive when I play darts.
2019-07-08,4,We usually stay away from Hoboken because we find the crowd too young but we are digging this bar off the main drag.Bartenders are so friendly. Having Kane brewery on tap is awesome and the food is really good too. Music selection is great and not top 40 and they have live bands Mon, Fri, Sat and Sun. Darts and pool tables on the first floor with skeeball on the second floor.We love the chipotle ranch wings. Wings have a good crunch and the sauce is scrumptious. Hand cut fries with curry sauce is an awesome accompaniment to the wings.This is our go to bar now when in the area. Just wish it was easier to park around Hoboken.
2019-06-22,5,Russell was hilarious and an amazing bartender- the whole bar tending squad on Fridays was on point and the live music was an added bonus
2019-06-17,4,I was skeptical when I first went to Finnegans ( I'm a bit of a wing snob). A very unassuming place on an unassuming ( Willow) road. That said, lots of draft beers, strong drinks and damn good wings. If they can get crispier fries , it would be a 5 star pub! Haven't tried and of the other food but it looks good !
2019-04-19,5,The best bar in Hoboken. Russ is my favorite bartender always in a good mood and cool and happy. And the bands are fire. It makes every millennial remember what real music is. Your classic Irish bar times 10.
2019-03-23,5,A great neighborhood bar a little further uptown in Hoboken. Great place to catch a game or come to on an NFL Sunday. Food is decent too especially the wings. Definitely a good spot if you're looking for a changeup from some of the more lively Hoboken bars.
2019-03-19,4,Met some friends from Ireland here on a Monday night for a few beers. We didn't eat here but heard the chicken wings were very good.  Randy the bartender is a nice guy. Friendly and attentive. Gave us some information about how to get around Hoboken and NY City. Jazz band played at 9:00pm.  Beer specials were available. Only problem was that they were literally tapped out of Guinness beer from the St Patricks Day crowd the day before. It's on Willow St. Off the beaten path but that's what we were looking for. I definitely recommend Finnegan's and will return
2019-03-03,1,Lol this bartender literally just called me stupid for blowing the Juul. Then proceeded to tell me how dumb I am for doing so. Disgusting sloppy joke. Never coming back, thanks.
2019-01-21,3,I like Finnegan's since they have live music often and good specials on beer. It's a good place to catch a sports game. The only thing I have a problem with there is one of their bartender's.  He's been rude to me in the past and acts like he's better than everyone that comes there. He should lose the ego.  Customer service 101 is not to shame the patron when they say something doesn't taste right to them.
2019-01-04,5,The pub has nice feel to it.. drinks were good, food was excellent. Staff is friendly and welcoming! Live music starts bit late but overall great experience!
2018-12-21,5,This place checks all the boxes when choosing a bar: cheap beer, rotating taps (something seasonal always on deck), bomb nachos, and they turn off the music to live stream Jeopardy every night. I'm not sure if I even need to say anything else. They also have some bar games pool and darts in the back. I feel like this place has all the things you love about a dive bar without the negatives of a dive bar (no beer soaked carpets, no funky smells). There's a few high top tables and the bar itself is pretty long. Groups vary from the after work happy crowd to the regulars who probably stop in for a drink every night. Bartender makes an effort to make conversation and the service waitress if you sit at a table are always really friendly and never let your glass go empty. Perfect spot to grab a drink while planning your move for the night.. or to grab too many drinks and end up spending your night here.
2018-11-29,4,Great local bar in Hoboken. Good enough bar food if you're going there hoping for food as well but wouldn't seek it out for dinner. Otherwise, good spit for music on a weekend night, or playing pool, darts, or foosball while having a few drinks.
2018-10-07,4,Live music, food, and drinks: need I say more? Came here for the first time with a few friends, didn't know what to expect from a bar in Hoboken in a Friday night. I had an okay experience. It wasn't so crowded which was why I enjoyed myself so much. The bartenders weren't the friendliest but I was there for the food not for them. Once you order the food and drinks come out pretty quickly. There's no table service so don't expect someone waiting on you the entire night. They drop off the food and run away. The food tasted good, we had the wings, spinach dip, and cheese fries. I needed ketchup but as I said, they dropped off and ran away. The food was tasty. Especially the wings and spin dip. The beer was cold, cocktails weren't strong, wine was just right. I would stick to the beer or wine. $10min to order anything from the bar and pay with a credit card. The back area has a pool table and darts. Darts need $10 cash deposit to play, I'm not sure if pool was free or not. Live music is a nice touch, the band playing that night was pretty awesome! I enjoyed my self overall, hope you do too!!!
2018-09-02,4,Cute Irish pub!! Good food... great drinks... great service. The corned beef is very good!
2018-08-21,5,Great bar with friendly service, good pub grub and skeeball upstairs! Friendly bartenders too.
2018-06-09,5,My friend and I came here bec another bar takes cash only. I was very suprised how good and chill this place is. Ordered wings and beer, which were pretty good. The waitress was really friendly. It's a pretty good place for meeting friends during week days.Update: came back w my bf on Friday night. I love the band so much! Live music, beer and spinach dip, yummy!
2018-05-11,5,Finnegan's was the first place I ventured to when I moved to Hoboken. I had just got to town and was sick of sitting in my empty, internetless apartment. I stopped in for their Monday burger special and ended up staying for hours. The owner Eoin, as well as the rest of the staff, is great and really make you feel at home. They have pretty great specials almost every night ($0.50 wings on Tuesday) and live music on the weekends. Check 'em out!
2018-03-18,1,I've been here a few times and never had an issue Went in yesterday for St. Patty's day and ordered three Jameson and gingers. After realizing there was not a drop of alcohol in the drinks we asked the bartender for the check and explained our issue. There was no apology or attempt to fix the drinks as he simply gave us our bill. Will not be going back due to terrible customer service.
2018-02-26,5,Nice hang out on weekdays and can be a good spot on weekends. The ski ball upstairs is a (surprising) and nice touch and the food is good, above your typical bar food. Also, they have a great beer selection that rotates with some frequency. However, their greatest asset is the staff. Some of the best bartenders you will meet.
2017-07-27,5,What is not to love about a bar that plays Jeopardy every weekday with the sound?! By far the best bar to sit and enjoy a beer or glass of wine in Hoboken. Has a real local feel to it and bartenders like Russel and Barry will remember your name and usual order in no time and pour a beautiful Guinness. Big rooms upstairs and in the back to play pool, darts and skee-ball. Would recommend this bar to anybody who is looking to have a drink in hoboken.  Not to mention the wings are some of the best in Hoboken. Live music is a definite plus and great bands but it can get really crowded usually leave before that.
2017-06-30,5,Russell is the best bartender in hoboken. He did a trick which only he does...the Guinness flip. Simply amazing. No other bartender in the world has done this besides him. Come visit and ask for the Guinness flip. 5 stars
2017-04-22,5,This is what we call my husband's "babysitter". I need to watch real housewives-- he goes to Finnegan's. I'm working late and there no food in the house--- goes to Finnegan's. Have to do laundry (laundromat across the street) -- goes to Finnegan's. If it will make him do the laundry, he can go to Finnegan's all he wants, five stars for that alone!
2017-04-18,3,Great local spot.  Been meaning to come here a while (we live a few blocks away), but I finally came in because I was grabbing a drink with a friend who was one of the regulars there.This review is only for the environment and drink options (I didn't eat there, nor did I see the back room/second floor).Pro's: it's clean, there's room and it's not too dimly lit.  The bar is long, there are high tops separated back from it, and the chairs are comfy.  They have enough space so that people won't hit you or your chair walking by.Con's: I wouldn't say this was a con as much as an opportunity-I ask the server what was on draft, and there's only one sign at the very end-maybe have them memorize the beers and tell you.  Also, the one beer I got was $9 (and it was what I'd consider barely a craft beer).I'll probably try it again-outside looks nice-upstairs or back room should be good (hear there's skee ball), so for now-pretty down the middle for me.
2017-02-19,4,Was casually walking by, and was attracted to the open window and airy restaurant inside.   Upon the waitresses recommendation, I ordered the Cajun chicken wrap. While I do love spicy food, this was a bit over-the-top and was too distracting, therefore I couldn't truly enjoy my lunch. The french fries are hand cut,  really fresh,  delicious and a change from what other restaurants typically serve. The only complaint is that they charge for soda refills. Two dollars per glass is truly ridiculous for a sprite. To my surprise when the waitress offered me a refill, I had to bring my glass to the bar, she didn't come to the table to pick it up. Didn't know this place was  partially self-service.  And to be charging  two dollars per soda , the second one I barely sipped-- is just not good customer service. Overall, a cute  charming pub.
2017-02-04,5,This bar is the beeeeest! The guy with the ponytail is the bomb and is super nice. He'll satisfy your alcohol needs very very well. the chipotle ranch wings are the best in Hoboken!!
2017-02-03,4,Nice neighborhood pub. Last I was there, they had a local band play. Great casual place to watch the game or meet up with friends.
2017-02-01,5,I love this place a lot. The fries are delicious. The sandwiches are really good. And oh man, so much beer. Only complaint is that their nachos could have a better cheese to chip ratio. If you happen to come when the Viking bartender is working, he will let you touch is locks, but only if you ask nicely.
2016-12-06,3,I would give two and a half stars if I could. I want to love this place. So much. In fact, I love the illusion of it and am disappointed every time I come. I live a couple blocks away, and LOVE the fact that there is a neighborhood Irish Pub. Nice ambience, a weekly open mic, upstairs with dart board and ski ball, pool room...what's not to like?     Well, what's not to like is the food and service. It's been several times in a row that a bartender has rubbed me the wrong way. The food is bad and overpriced. You can throw a rock and hit five places with better bar food in Hoboken. The bartenders know the customers but not in a good way. It's as if you're intruding on their hanging out with their friends. No one seems to care if you're happy or not. That could be charming, but it's not. What is this place supposed to be? Solid mediocrity? I hate to be harsh, but I see the potential for greatness!
2016-10-22,4,Better beer selection than I expected - and lots of local options. The prices were especially good during happy hour. And I quite enjoyed sitting outside on the front patio while enjoying my beer.
2016-10-04,5,Love my local pub. What amazing food and great people. I will visit every Sunday to watch a game.
2016-09-16,5,This place was good. Like, dang. I enjoyed everything. The food, the beer, the not loudness of it, the cottage pie was good like really good, like our waitress was awesome she was nice, I think her name is Jamie but I might be wrong. Like, everything was really good I want to come back and get it all again but different stuff cause I'm sure its also good. Thank you.
2016-08-01,4,Enjoyed a late evening dinner tonight with friends while listening to a great live bluegrass band.  Where else can you find good live entertainment on a Monday night?!  Food was surprisingly good - we had fish & chips (huge portion of fish that was nice and moist), hamburgers and a grilled chicken sandwich.  Reasonably priced, too (under $15).  Good beers.No street parking to be found (resident permit only) but we parked at a garage (ProParking?) at 375 4th St., next to a hospital, that was about 7 short blocks away and only $8 for up to 3 hours.Will definitely be back.
2016-05-25,5,Love this place...drinks are great. service is great. and the food when last time I was there was so so...this time it was outstanding!! pub food on another level. they must have gotten a new chef because it was amazing. heading back tonight
2016-03-25,4,I've only had drinks here so I can't comment on the food. Good place to go if you want to avoid the obnoxious crowds at the bars on Washington St. I've had some good pours of Guinness here (in contrast, don't ever get Guinness at 10th and Willow...).
2016-03-17,4,Great st pattys day experience here. Friendly nice staff, love Irish music, fun bartenders, green beer, good vibes in general. AND the food was amaze!  The corned beef and cabbage was tender and flavorful. The bangers and mash were SO good with a super tasty gravy. Hope they have it on their every day menu too! Will def be back with my Irish fiance's parents to impress. :)
2016-02-07,4,If you're looking for a nice place with a bit more of a laid back crowd, try Finnegans. It's quickly become one of our favorite spots- cheaper drinks than you find at the bars on Washington and typically much less crowded. One problem is that they're drinks do tend to seem a bit watered down, and even their shots, too. The food I've had there was pretty good, and they have some awesome deals for weeknight happy hour beer and food combos. The beer selection rotates and the bartender is pretty knowledgable about what you might like and can offer suggestions. What I really love is that the owner is often there and actually seems to care about what's happening in his establishment.
2016-01-27,5,Cool spot great bartenders and good weekly specials enormous upgrade over Rogos the owner actually gives a shit about his business!! Great spot for skee ball or darts!
2016-01-07,4,This is a drinks only review (I assure you I had enough to evaluate)For those who remember, this used to be Rogos. Well the place now looks a lot newer and brighter. It's a very open space, which makes it feel more inviting. The layout also makes it easier to watch the TVs. The owner also bartends from time to time!I never got a chance to sample the food, but if I come back to town I will hopefully get the chance. All in all a great bar!
2015-11-18,4,Fun place, bartender is cool, bar is clean and quick service.  Food was good too!
2015-10-13,2,Not happy with the cocky service and the food was so so...Tenth and Willow next time or we should stay on Washington Street.
2015-08-31,1,I've been to many "wing nights" at Finnegans but this place has steadily wen't downhill since the conversion from Rogo's.  The wings still taste great but the wait staff sucks.  Last visit was on 8/25/15 and there was only one waitress for the entire bar.  She also came with a bad attitude and didn't write down any of our orders.   Of course my wings came hot instead of mild.  Usually not a big deal you can just send them back for the correct wings.  Not this time because they ran out of wings on wing night!  If you are looking for wings go to 10th and Willow on Monday nights for $5 all you can eat wings.
2015-08-25,4,This place is good.  Good food, good decor, good selection of drinks.  Genuine Irish pub. And then you have a bartender like Ed that makes this place special. Most attentive, engaging, bartender I've come across.  Solid place, highly recommended.
2015-08-23,3,Good local pub. Service can be spotty depending on who is bartending. Food is average at best.
2015-05-28,5,I'm moving to Hoboken soon, and Tuesday wing night at this place really sweetens the deal. I've been there twice so far, and the wings/beer specials are a good value, the wings are tasty, and the staff has been really great. I was there last Tuesday, and our group started as 5, but doubled as the night went on... as someone who used to wait tables, I know this could be kind of obnoxious, but the waitress was really nice and accommodating.
2015-05-10,4,Great local bar! Nice place to watch football and eat wings and have some beers. Love this place!
2015-04-22,5,Really fun room upstairs for parties. The owners are awesome and the food and drinks are both good! Live irish music!!!
2015-03-29,5,The best pub in Hoboken! The waitstaff, phenomenal! They remember who you are, what you drink, the people you come in with, and best of all... Your name! I have decided to make this my local spot. It is decent pub grub for sure! Great specials. Great tap selection (always seems to rotate- I had some Hoboken brew recently) This is the "CHEERS" of Hoboken! Cheers mate :)
2015-02-26,5,Great spot for live entertainment, and they have a couple skee-ball tables upstairs if you want to have some friendly games (they also do league skee-ball).Bartenders always friendly.This place used to be called Rogos, I think.Many TVs many games on.
2014-10-25,5,This place is a hidden gem, off the beaten path.  The second time we came in, about four weeks from the first time, Ed remembered our faces and our beers of choice.  He's courteous and professional, and extremely knowledgeable about his craft. (Don't trust me?  Then test him!)  Overall...great experience, great place.  And make sure to say 'hey' after reading this because we'll probably be here more often than not.
2014-09-18,5,Best wings in Hoboken.  Great bartenders, cold beer.  Great music!
2014-09-14,1,I stopped in to have a beer, and was ignored by the staff.Not a friendly neighborhood place.  Basically, if the bartender doesn't think he is going to make a lot of money from you, he won't serve you. You are better off going to Willie McBrides or Sullivan's.  They are REAL Irish Pubs.
2014-09-13,1,A friend and I decided to try out some bars in Hoboken we'd never been to last night. We always pass Finnegan's and thought why not? I could not have had a worse experience and was there all of 15 minutes before wanting to finish my beer and leave immediately. We were first made uncomfortable by a clearly over-served middle aged man in a business suit. Apparently he and his friend had been sitting in the unattended seats we scooped up upon walking in. When the men returned to the area we asked if we had taken their seats and genuinely offered to move if we had. One slurred "Yes" and so we quickly got up only to have his friend refuse to let us move. The man joked condescendingly that we could stay if we bought his drinks for the rest of the night...although they might be "a little expensive" for us. Really mature.Just as this is occurring the male bartender comes over and yells to his pals in the business suits, "These KIDS should be out dancing, don't let them steal your seats." Not only was this the cherry on top to an already awkward moment, I was extremely offended a member of the staff would even say something like that. Sorry we took your high-tipping seats away, we wanted to move. You could have politely explained the seats were taken prior to serving us there.We quickly got the message we were unwelcome and left. We did nothing to deserve that treatment. We were looking for a nice, chill night with a few drinks as many reviews on here promise. Instead we got unnecessary negativity and disrespect. I'm sure this practice of scaring potential new customers away will do wonders for a long, sustained business. Good luck!Also, I NEVER write Yelp reviews so if this place actually got me here you know it was BAD.
2014-06-24,4,Finnegans is a great bar that I have adopted to be my "local spot".  The staff is awesome, $3 miller lite bottles and bud drafts (at least on Monday nights), good food (haven't had a bad thing off the menu), skee ball, darts, pool and live music on the weekend. Friendly atmosphere and great crowd. :)
2014-06-01,5,Ed is not only an amazing bartender, but an amazing person. Brian is possibly the smartest person that has ever lived. Owen is great to talk to, runs a fine bar but be warned, he's very efficient! Haha, be ready with your order. You'll enjoy yourself with any of these guys. Finnegan's is perfect any night of the week. Skee ball upstairs and darts in the back. What's not to love?
2014-05-09,4,"I like it." At least that's what the bf told me when I asked him what I should write about this place. Sigh... sadly writing Yelp reviews comes easier for some people than for others. Left at a loss for how to begin, I'll say that I also like this place. It is a laid-back Irish bar with decent beer selection and a relaxed crowd. It's not a dive, and has a lot more lights on than your typical pub, so you can actually read the menu! That's a plus, right?They sponsor a softball team, so I'm usually in here with those knuckleheads. The fact that they haven't banned us from coming in is a testament to how cool these guys are. Nah, we are a nice crowd. That includes the people I came in with, and the other patrons decorating the outside of the wooden bar. There are little booths off to the side, but who wants to sit in the corner? Most people cluster at the bar top. The Tuesday night bartender is top notch, and is willing to toss chocolate to angry girls who need a quick fix to get them through the night without clawing out eachother's eyes as they debate who messed up that throw to second base.Cheap draft specials. Last time was $3 Miller Lt pints. Awesome French fries that you can get this awesome curry sauce with. Yum!Solid place to celebrate a win, or to relax and drink with friends.
2014-05-08,4,Inexpensive for a Hoboken Bar, no fist pumping here...  Great local bar with good people!
2014-04-16,5,I've been going here for the last year.  I witnessed the transition between Rogos and Finnegans.  The staff are great people.  Super friendly and generous (they will throw you a free drink now and again).  They get top quality meat for burgers from the local butcher and I think they have one of the best burgers in town.  It's quality non greasy beef. Most of the other burgers in town are greasy and make me feel bad after eating them. And I would have to say that their wings are some of the best in Hoboken.  Non breaded and well cooked.  Try the teriyaki as a recommendation,  very good. There isn't anything on the menu over $11 and it's all quality stuff.  Decent beer selection with rotating brews and low prices. Visit them on a certain day and you will find a special on food for an excellent bargain.  Plenty of tv's around.  A pool table.  Skee ball upstairs and darts.  I am giving them a great review because I have fallen victim to the mediocre hoboken bar scene for too long.  If you want quality well priced food and drink in Hoboken this is what I consider the best. It's not a crazy hangout. It definitely has the great old school hoboken bar mentality   -Hoboken resident for 10 years and counting
2014-04-06,2,Terrible service. I went with three friends and stood at the bar for 20 minutes waiting for 4 beers. I gave the bartender my card and closed out because I didn't think we were staying but we ended up hanging out for a while. When I went to order another drink, the bartender reprimanded me for closing my tab earlier and almost wouldn't give me another beer even though I was paying cash this time. My friend ordered a round of shots and we waited another 20 minutes. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because drinks are cheap.
2014-04-03,5,AWSOME local bar. Friendly staff, good food specials, great music on weekends, and just a good place to hang out.With pool table, two dart boards and skee ball, you will never be board. Friendly crowd so you won't have any trouble finding a partner for pool or darts.
2014-02-24,5,Awesome cozy bar! Bartenders are super friendly and helpful. I've been looking for a good neighborhood bar to call my own.....look no further! And they have a pool table in back that's in great shape and isn't swamped all the time like other tables in Hoboken.
2014-01-29,4,Great spot with an excellent staff. Love 50 cent wing nights. If you're looking for a chill spot to post up at the bar with good prices, this is the spot.
2013-11-30,4,SUCH an improvement over Rogo's. Gone is the weird smell, crappy TVs, and shady DJ booth. In its place is a great looking Irish pub with a friendly and fun staff.Came here on Friday for happy hour with a group and had a blast. Solid selection of beers all served with a Chill Right tap system (yeah, I watch Bar Rescue). Solid selection of appetizers and surprisingly tasty tacos for their taco nigh deal.Definitely coming back!
2013-11-16,5,I really like this place. I went there once when it was Rogo's and it just wasn't for me. I walked past recently, noticed it had a new name, and figured it was worth another try. I tend to prefer the more low-key neighborhood bars, so this was an appealing prospect.  The food is solid and reasonably priced. and there is a good selection of beers on tap. The bartenders and wait staff seem to enjoy their jobs and have all provided excellent service.The main bar area looks like it could get loud and crowded quite easily (not unlike any of the smaller bars in town), but there is a back room with more tables, darts and a pool table and a dining room upstairs with another bar.This is a great option for a casual beer and a bite to eat. I'll be back.
2013-11-15,4,I love going here as a low-key/laid-back/not-as-crowded alternative to some of the crazier downtown bars. This place has been recently been revamped so maybe they are trying to change the atmosphere (I have no idea) but I still feel comfortable going in there with yoga pants and a sweatshirt
2013-11-03,2,The new Rogo is a no go. It's exactly the same as the old place. Went in for football today and the bartender was nice but scatter brained. A waitress fell down the stairs carrying a bunch of plates, I felt horrible for her. I think the kitchen is upstairs but the main dining area is downstairs. This place is begging to be on an episode of bar rescue. There's nothing about it that makes it stand out from everywhere else in this area. It's just generic.
2013-10-16,1,Well, I believe this is my first yelp review in a few years!Let me start by saying, I moved to Hoboken about two (2) years ago and Rogo's was my "go to spot" on Tuesday night for wings, when they were 25 cents and drew a decent crowd.  Then Sandy happened and wings were 50 cents.  Now, I am not complaining 50 cents is a lot for wings, however, the other competition in Hoboken took my business.  10th & Willow and McSwiggens have all you can eat wings for $5 on Mondays and the beer garden is 50% off on Tuesdays.  I gave it one last shot a few months after Sandy with four (4) buddies.  We were the only ones there and our tab was well above $150 for wings and yings, seriously!  Therefore, I moved wing night to Monday's and stopped going to Rogo's.  Fast forward to a few weeks ago when I heard Rogo's re-opened as Finnegan's Pub.  I got all excited and finally decided to give them another shot during last night's ALCS game.  Seriously, it's the exact same bar.  They bought a can of paint, that's all!!!  On that note, there were only about 6 or 7 people in the place and music was playing, not the ALCS game.  Finally, the guy to the right of my buddy and I asked the bartender to put the sound on during the 8th inning.  He said "its dart league night, no".  Sure enough, I leaned back and looked in the back room and there were some "c-league" players attempting to shoot darts and I use the word "attempting", loosely!  So if you liked Rogo's post-Sandy, then you will love this place!!! But, if you like any other bars in Hoboken don't bother!!!  P.S.  Heard they get pretty busy during Sunday Football, hopefully, they put to the sound on for local games.  Guess, I will never find out...
2013-10-06,1,Great location near the zog football field. Brighter than the old rogos. But, the food isnt good and our bar tender is drinking our leftover beers and taking our shots that we paid for... Not cool
2013-10-01,5,Newly renovated, much cleaner an inviting than Rogo's used to be.  Friendly bartenders.  Great food.  Definitely my new go-to spot since the Gaslight became Stewed Cow..
