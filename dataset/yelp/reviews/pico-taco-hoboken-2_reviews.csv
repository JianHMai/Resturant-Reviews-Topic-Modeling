2021-10-27,3,As a vegetarian, the idea of mushroom tacos sounded really appealing. I was disappointed. The flavor was ok but needed more salt and spices. It was supposed to have corn, and it did have a few kernels, but not enough to make a difference.It was ok, but for the price, meh.
2021-08-26,4,This place is solid, but nothing outstanding. They make good tacos but I prefer Tacoria
2021-08-24,2,Babes I got to say it... the only thing great about here are the employees for having to deal w yall being obnoxious running in and out of the store but I KNOWWWW the reason these tacos are cheap is because they aren't spending ANY money on seasoning. Iykyk- there's def a reason this is thriving in this location...
2021-08-13,5,The shrimp tacos were life-changing!!!A bit of exaggeration but honestly the best tacos I've had in a while. I think their other tacos we got were still good (with fish following the shrimp tacos), but shrimp were definitely the best for us :DThey don't have water cups for tap water, so if you're trying to dine in I would bring your own water bottle.
2021-08-02,2,Terrible- put no onions in the notes and even called to confirm. Of course they put a ton of onions. So careless so i had to throw it out and waste money. Terribly packaged drink spilled all over the boxes just so carless all around would not order again - to many great places in hoboken that actually care.
2021-07-31,4,We ordered tacos for 4 people on a Thursday night via Doordash. When they arrived, one of the tacos was actually missing, but we were able to get a refund on that taco through Doordash.The tacos themselves are pretty good. They are incredibly filling and just piled high (especially the shrimp tacos). The quesadilla is definitely smaller than expected, but still hearty. I'll go back the next time I'm looking for tacos!
2021-07-02,1,They served old beans. Something really smelled I was starving.... Then realized beans tasted funky, asked husband to smell he said it smells like pooo too! Next morning severe food poisoning and didn't feel well at all! I used to order from here a lot!!! Called the next day woman who picked up said I'm sorry that's IT! !!!!!!!! Ridiculous never going back again and I don't recommend to anyone plus rice tastes weird too!!!!
2021-05-23,1,I used to enjoy taco Tuesday here until the Quality of food and customer service has diminished. this pass taco Tuesday I went in order 8 shrimp tacos they told me 10 minutes it took about five minutes for them to package it and bring it out to me. I drove off in my car waiting to get on the turnpike 1and 9 to 280 entrance with that traffic took a bite of my taco mushroom were so hard so overly cooked not to mention the tacos were ice cold they did not prepare these tacos fresh so I called the store and told them what I experienced and that I will be coming back to the store I was told that order was made to fresh I show them how rubbery the shrimp was in tight and tough they proceeded to say I'll give you your money back and I countered with I don't want my money back I want my meal that's what I came to the store for my meal my food not my money back I ask you to remake my order how do you should've done it in the beginning I literally had to stand in the store where are the people around being in Barris because they insisted on giving me my money back because I showed them the quality of food I receive and instead of them just fixing the problem by making my order over they was rude disrespectful and offered me my money back I eventually got four of 8 tacos me over for this reason I will never ever endorse the store with any of my friends or family any of my social media followers and I'm gonna upload my review to all markets so everyone is aware of the quality of service the quality of food and how they handle resolution and I've been a repeat customer for more than a year
2021-05-01,4,Love the burrito bowls here, I've tried the carnitas and the shrimp. Both times the food was good and really filling. Sometimes there can be a bit of a wait if it gets busy for takeout.
2021-04-24,5,Favorite tacos in Hoboken.  The Birria tacos were amazing.  Delivered nice and crispy, and the broth was very rich.
2021-04-19,2,Beware of the food quality. Tacos were decent but the night was ruined after discovering chunks of pork *in* the horchata! We only found out at the end. Mortified. Never ordering here again.
2021-04-11,4,Ordered the fish and shrimp tacos as well as the street corn and the shrimp quesadilla. All were excellent and will definitely be ordering from them again!
2021-04-11,5,Great tacos. I used to order at the taco truck before and was sad when they closed. I tried this one and was not disappointed. My favorites are the fried fish one and the Al Pastore.
2021-04-03,4,Ordered delivery on a Friday night. My favorite was the fish tacos. There was a generous amount of fish and it was breaded lightly and fried to perfection. The shrimp tacos were also excellent. The elotes were slightly overdone - though we suspect it was due to the corn continuing to cook itself during the delivery. Otherwise, the taste was fantastic - citrusy and creamy. Would love to try it fresh. Overall, the meal was fantastic. The food was delicious and the portions were generous. Would love to dine in soon.
2021-04-02,3,Ordered a lunch for the office and not one item was missing. Food is reasonably priced and they do not skimp in the meat! Definitely will be back and try more off the menu.
2021-03-18,2,Just ordered from here. Has potential but the meat, rice and beans are not fresh at all. The carnitas was hard as a rock, I suspect it had been left out all day which made it dry and was then deep fried which caused it to burn up. The rice and beans was a mush due to being overcooked. But food was still edible and the fresh veggies tasted just fine.
2021-02-28,4,My wife was in the mood for mexican so we figured to give it a shot. This is a small take-out spot that I didn't realize was there.  I tried the birria taco's since I like the dipping sauce that this dish comes with.  This reminds me of a french dip version of tacos.  I also tried the carne asada and al pastor taco.  These are more of the classics that you simply can't not try when you come. Meat is a little dry but flavor is good. I also am a big torta fan and this one had good flavor. The avocado gives it good creaminess to contrast the fattiness of the carne asada.  This was probably my favorite item on the menu.The delivery came quick and you get good portions for a reasonable price. If you need to satisfy a mexican food fix it is a good option.
2021-02-12,3,The Birria Quesadilla aren't anything like getting them in the city but it will satisfy your craving. The flavor of whatever they put on the tortilla is very overpowering and the onions or cilantro arent enough to break up the taste. The consommé wasn't the best either. The amount of food that they give you is great for the price. Would give this place another try but would go out of my way for it. Also didn't like the salsa much .
2021-01-27,4,Really solid spot for good Mexican. Amazing chips and gluten free friendly. We get tacos from them at least twice a week!
2021-01-21,2,Tiniest quesadilla in history. More like a taco. Burrito bowl was decent size. Salsa is a rip off. It's literally tomato paste with cilantro stems.  Disgusting. Taco were alright. Maybe just stick to that.
2020-12-29,3,I got the mushroom, corn, veggie tacos and they were healthy and simple just how I like it. Very tasty, but I have to give it 3 stars because you can tell right away that the mushrooms are from a can. Not authentic. Still was good!
2020-12-23,2,I ordered a bowl, but it was very disappointing - the pork was dry and tough, and the rice was sticky and stodgy! My girlfriends chicken bowl had the same rice, and the chicken was t very flavorful
2020-12-20,5,Best shrimp tacos in Hoboken. My go to is normally shrimp and al pastor and both are amazing. I also love to add on the mexican street corn. I've had great experiences ordering from there since the pandemic started and it's been on-time every time. I'm normally a hard shell taco lover but the quality of the ingredients and the flavor of these tacos make we want to order them over and over again.
2020-11-30,5,My go to for Mexican food.  Their tacos and bowls are always so delicious.  The flavors are outstanding and the food tastes fresh.  Do yourself a favor and order from here!! You will not be disappointed!
2020-11-01,4,Cashier was irritable and not very nice. Corn was tasty. Tacos are good but a bit bland, needs more seasoning or sauce.
2020-10-18,4,Great tacos! Needed a snack and this did the trick. Al pastor and chorizo tacos were good, but the real winner was the crispy fish taco. They have some outdoor seating at the moment, too.
2020-09-29,4,Chicken Quesadilla is good if your into the flavorful taste. (Highly recommend it)I also had a bowl with "Mexican rice, black beans, cheese, and chicken" the seasoning in the chicken is to die for. The rice was soft and good. If your looking for a good Mexican spot or something flavorful and good, I definitely recommend to try Pico Taco.
2020-09-27,2,Way when Pico first opened, I was excited for the new taco joint in the area. The food was good then. I dont know what happened since (pre covid). I dined in a couple times and the food was cold, tortillas were not fresh as they used to be. I was hesitant to order delivery because of the past occasions, but i did regardless, give em a chance, again.  I ordered the Asada bowl, came in a box, not a bowl, didn't have beans as described. Second, my drink was spilled inside the bag when it was delivered. Please Pico, come back, I know you can do it!
2020-08-31,3,Decided to pick up an early dinner at Pico Taco and I don't regret it. It was a cute little spot close to the Hoboken PATH Station. The staff wore masks properly and only one customer was allowed into the building at a time. For dinner I chose the chorizo bowl, chips and a side of Mexican street corn. The chorizo bowl was pretty tasty. I wouldn't say amazing but a little above average. The chorizo was okay, just average. It was a bit disappointing because it wasn't as flavorful or spicy as I was expecting. The Mexican rice underneath was the saving grace. It was fluffy and tasteful. The other ingredients: beans, veggies, tortilla crisps were all average. The bowl also included green and red salsa in very small containers. The Mexican street corn was okay. Definitely not the best, I'd say just average. It wasn't worth the price in my opinion. However, I will say that the chips were amazing. Probably the best item purchased. You could tell they were homemade and had the perfect amount of salt sprinkled on top. Overall the menu items I purchased were average with nothing special other than the homemade chips. If I visit again I'd probably choose something different. I'd say give this place a try, and if you do definitely get the chips!
2020-08-27,4,Was craving some Mexican food and came across this spot on Yelp. I remember passing by the restaurant a few times in Hoboken. I ordered the shrimp taco and a build-your-own burrito bowl. I was certainly impressed with the portions - the taco was decently filling and the bowl was big! The taco with its sauces had a nice kick to it, and the bowl too was flavorful. I wish it was a bit more spicy, but tasted great overall. Will definitely order again!
2020-08-19,5,Ordered delivery for the Pollo Adobado Taco (3pc) for $10.50, the Barbacoa Taco (3pc) for $11.50, and the Barbacoa Quesadilla for $8.50. Like another yelper noted, they offer a discount if you order directly through them. So I did that. :) Thank you all!!!Delivery arrived early. Everything was packed neatly. Great packaging! Everything was hot too. We started with the chicken tacos. The chicken was delicious! Nice charred grill flavor. Some crunch. The tortillas are soft and fresh. The cilantro, onions, radishes and limes are all fresh and chopped and sliced perfect size. No cheese on tacos. They were so delicious!! The chicken tacos are a little messy (chicken falls right out lol) so eat over a plate! Definitely recommend them. Great portion size for everything.The barbacoa tacos were also very good. The shredded beef had a delicious flavor and was so soft and easy to chew lol. Melt in your mouth good! Same with the onion, cilantro, radishes, and limes as the chicken tacos. Great portions. Definitely recommend this one too!The barbacoa quesadilla was mine and my boyfriends favorite! It's like a larger cheesy version of the barbacoa taco lol. It held together perfectly. The same barbacoa as tacos, just melts in your mouth. Nice and STUFFED (the quesadilla, not me). The cheese was yummy and melted to perfection. Definitely recommend this menu item!!!The orange and green sauces that came with everything were also very good. The orange sauce had a little bit of heat. Yummmmm!!! Very filling.
2020-07-29,5,First visit last night. Fresh. Real good flavors. I tried 3 tacos of various flavors & enjoyed all 3. I work in Hoboken & will certainly return.
2020-07-26,5,I ordered through the Yelp app and I used Apple Pay to pay for it. I got here and it was ready. Everything tasted so good. I love tacos. They put the right amount of onions and cilantro. Outdoor seating was available so I ate outside. No wait at all.
2020-07-21,2,I ordered two sets of tacos (six tacos in total) and only one set of the tacos were delivered. I spent 30 mins attempting to call the restaurant but they never picked up. There was no way to communicate the missing items
2020-06-28,5,Super delicious!! Finally went here for the first time after months of walking past, late on a Sunday. Ordered the bowl al pastor with most of the toppings - everything was fresh, plenty of flavor, high quality ingredients, and overall just very delicious. Definitely see myself coming back here on a weekly basis. Reasonably priced (especially for hoboken), and there's a great discount when you order directly on their website!
2020-06-26,5,I had a great take out experience here today. If you order directly via their website you get 25%. The bowls are great. I got the Barbacoa bowl and Mexican street corn. This is so much better than the bowls you get at chipotle. The corn was tangy and delicious. Highly recommend getting food from here and if you are getting it to go order from the website and save some $$$ * Enjoy *
2020-06-25,1,Dissatisfied. Don't let some of those pictures fool ya. The food might as well be plastic. Over-priced for mediocre food. The tortillas will leave a bad taste in your mouth, and you can only imagine the rest.
2020-06-24,5,I've been there twice now, with three tacos each time. It was Taco Tuesday and I don't recall the exact price but quite low.The chorizo and carnitas were great and I was glad to see actual pineapple in the al pastor. If you're not a pork enthusiast, the barbacoa is a good choice, and there was even a flavor-packed vegetarian option with the mushroom taco. The orange sauce was superb.
2020-06-23,5,Would have posted a picture but it smelt and tasted so good that I forgot. Honestly best tacos in Hoboken hands down! I've tried them all and they're all amazing. I'm officially a regular customer!
2020-06-16,5,So good.. needed to write a review. The portion sizes are excellent, all the food was so delicious and tacos come loaded with fresh toppings. and the tortilla chips, don't get me started on the tortilla chips, so freaking good! This might have to be a once a week meal going forward!
2020-06-03,5,Pico Taco is a new favorite. They are "two orders in 4 days" good. Thanks to Yelp's Big Night In 2.0 we placed our first order from Pico Taco on Saturday around 6:30. Fast forward a few days and we were ordering once again. We've tried nearly every taco they make and my favorites are definitely the shrimp and fish. The fish is perfectly crispy and a really good serving. Same with the shrimp. Delicious, not overcooked, and plenty of shrimp.  They are a bit more expensive than the chicken/pork/beef tacos but well worth it. Get the guac!!! It's like 3.50 for a 4oz tub and I couldn't get enough of it. Each bite of taco had a schmear of guac. I've also tried the mushroom taco (totally vegan and on a corn tortilla) and it's a great alternative to meat and fish, but I prob won't get it again. The shrimp quesadilla was delicious and perfectly cheesy. The tacos are still my favorite. But can't wait for my next order. Order online to automatically get 25%!
2020-05-26,5,I first saw this place walking by the Path this morning and I had a feeling they had good tacos. So I placed a pick up order for dinner, & as soon as I walked in I knew they had good tacos, just based on the aesthetic & aroma, this place screams good authenticity. I ordered 4 tacos, fish, shrimp, pollo, & steak (listed in order of best tasting but ALL were fire). Reminds me of the food I ate in Mexico City a few months ago before the pandemic. It's on the pricier side for tacos, but hey you're paying for quality, I foresee me hitting this place up at least 2 to 3 times a week for the foreseeable future.
2020-05-24,1,Sucked. Entirely bland with zero effort to prepare anything remotely edible! The steak tacos had chunks of steak stuck to a string of fat you could choke on. The corn was paltry coated with a dry hot rub. But thanks for the sliced dry radishes!
2020-05-11,2,I loveD this place! Their tacos are amazing in comparison to Surf Taco, but omg I just witnessed the lady pick up the chips with her hands- not washed, no gloves. I called her out on it and she was like oh no, that's for our busser...ummm yeah, but now that means the entire basket of chips is now contaminated!! I paid $8 to get sick prwttgPlease educate and teach your staff this is not okay! This is how germs are passed. Not even that, it's proper food handling!!  Update: reached out to management about this and nothing. Great customer service or acknowledgement of the situation.
2020-05-08,2,I was so excited when a taco place opened in Hoboken because the taco scene is pretty sad around here but Pico Taco was disappointing. I think it's the quality of the meat used. The steak is so fatty and chewy. I ended up throwing most of the meat away. I don't remember what else I tried but I didn't like anything. Even the Mexican street corn felt so dry with overload of dry spices on it. I had my bf try it since I can be picky and he thought most of the food was inedible too. I think Pico Taco has potential but they have to step up the quality of the ingredients - maybe visit Tacoria in Jersey city to see how it should be done.
2020-05-07,4,*Quarantine Delivery Review*Instead of ordering our usual sushi delivery, we decided to go with some tacos because it had been a while since we had some. And of course, our favorite thing to do is order too much food for two people. Here is everything we ordered:Al Pastor Tacos - these were great. Flavor was perfect and they don't skimp on the meatChorizo Quesadilla - you really can't go wrong with chorizo or quesadillaBaja Style Crispy Fish Taco - this was my favorite of the group but probably also because I love fish tacos. The piece of fish in each taco was big, which I appreciated because I hate when taco spots give you the tiniest piece of fish and fill the rest of the taco with veggiesCarne Asada Tacos - this was my least favorite. The meat was a bit chewy and it was also blandCarne Asada Fries - again, the meat wasn't great but the rest of the toppings were good. I normally don't like soggy fries but somehow, the soggy fries worked here. I'd like to see an al pastor version of the fries.Overall, everything was great (aside from the carne asada). I'd definitely order again. I think I'll try out their tortas next!
2020-05-06,5,My roommate and I love Pico. The quality of ingredients puts pico above any other Mexican spot in Hoboken. Through quarantine, we have seen delivery from some of the best spots result in a sub par meal due to a number of reasons. Not here. Pico delivery still results in food that feels like a night out. The quality hasn't suffered. We ordered the family feast for 2 and it's been our favorite meal in quarantine thus far.
2020-04-24,5,Excellent delivery- we loved the make your own tacos for two. Did chicken and steak. Will definitely order again.
2020-04-10,2,No bueno. Bowl was a bland mix of rice and lettuce for the most part, tacos not good. I'd write more but it would just be to hear myself speak... not much left to say. Don't do it.
2020-04-03,4,Hi Pico Taco crew!!!  LOVE YOUR FOOD! I had the shrimp quesadilla yesterday and IT WAS BOMB!  I tried to order again off Seamless today, but the delivery guy gave me a chorizo quesadilla by accident! Lol. It was still tasty I just don't eat meat really. I called and appreciate the refund you gave me - but would've love if you offered a new shrimp quesadilla! Haha. I used the discount code on Seamless so now I have to pay more to order next time. Not sure if I will, but can definitely try stopping in the restaurant once the quarantine is over! I have to say that the food quality: homemade tortilla shells; fresh onions, cilantro; delicious cheese and yummy shrimp + the chipotle mayo and hot sauces on side (I like the orange more than green!) is so so good.
2020-03-23,3,The food is decent. But if the option for breakfast has no end time on delivery apps, and there is no indication of any breakfast times, it isn't proper to leave a passive aggressive note on the bag as well. I am a restaurant owner as well, and I am grateful for any business in this Covid-19 time. The note, I understand. But the lines under the "only" make it rude. Will not be ordering again. Take care of your customers, we are all struggling at the moment.
2020-03-03,5,Clean, quick, friendly and not to mention banging tacos. I needed a quick bite before a panel event near by and popped into this place with no expectations. It was great ambience, clean, and close to the Hoboken train station. Must try!
2020-02-23,4,Tired of build your own salad or franchise sandwich? Then this is the option. This has become my company's favorite place to go especially Tuesday. They have half off tacos on Tuesday. I also the love the fact that they have so much options - al pastor, carne, chorizo, pescado, to name a few. I am tempted to try a few protein every time I go.The one callout is the ordering system. They seemed to get my order mixed up every time I go.
2020-02-16,4,Great food!! Not a lot of places have carna Asada French fries... they were really good.. the only bad thing was my shrimp taco was made with Cole slaw.. but the shrimp were cooked really well.. and this place is extremely clean and all the sauces were made fresh.
2020-02-12,5,Carne asada fries. The best I've ever had! Crispy French fries, pour over some melted, warm queso, sprinkle some chopped red onions, cut grilled and marinated steak, and drizzle sour cream with guacamole sauce. Boom! A bowl of heaven to hit your mouth, not to be robbed by cardiologists. (Joy kill) I topped it off with Valentina hot sauce because I better not disrespect Mexican delicacy. Washed it down with an ice cold Jarritos.
2020-02-05,5,Let me start by saying how much I dislike the food in Hoboken but Pico Taco is the only restaurant in the city that I will always come back to. I usually stop in once every three or four weeks on a Tuesday for their half price deal and the quality always stays consistent. Chicken Tacos - Absolutely delicious. The chicken is flavorful and juicyChorizo - I found the meat to be a bit salty but I'm not the biggest chorizo fan so I didn't knock off any stars here Carne Asada - So good! The meat is cooked and seasoned perfectly   All the tacos are stacked high with onions, tomato, and cilantro. The salsas are also fantastic, especially the orange one. The tortillas are heated very nicely. I also love that they give you radish and limes when you do take out. The service is great and the food comes out quickly and it's super close to the PATH station makes this place super convenient after coming from home work. Overall, Pico Taco has a customer for life and I can't wait to try their newly introduced breakfast.
2020-01-24,5,I was craving tacos and this satisfied my craving! The interior is very cute and trendy, the inside is very clean and offers a lot of comfortable seating.There is a lot on the menu to choose from, I ordered the Pollo and Crispy Fish taco and felt satisfied with the amount (although if I had more time I would have ordered more). I especially liked the Fish, it was crispy and didn't taste greasy & both were very flavorful.
2020-01-24,4,Small place to pick a taco. The mushroom taCo was nice but we really loved the cheese nachos. Their hime sauces were the best. Would go again if they add few more vegetarian options.
2020-01-09,4,Pico is definitely worthy of a "taco-lover's Stamp of Approval" review.Mind you, I've never been to Mexico and had tacos made with tortillas that were hand-made by somebody's grandma... but I have lived in the City of Angels. El Taurino is where I make my taco pilgrimage, and taco trucks with bomb tortas late at night are where I've made some fond food memories (the smell of dirty dogs from stands next to them most def helped create olfactory associative ones).All this to say, I love tacos.On this particular visit, I had a fish and al pastor, as per my friend's reco. I'm not crazy about the former in general, but it was hot out of the fryer and made me smile.But the al pastor oh my goosshhh...I've had but lost all hope for finding decent tacos in the Northeast. Just the other day, I walked out of a newly opened Mexican joint sad and broken, having eaten quite possibly the driest steak and chicken tacos I've ever had (but at five bucks for 3, I couldn't resist!)But wow... the al pastor taco practically teleported me back to Los Angeles; the meat was juicy and flavored well, with just the right amount of cilantro and onion (meaning, a lot of cilantro and about half a tablespoon of diced onions). Simple, but divine.The sauce! Don't forget the sauce!! I really like the attention to detail here... they put out two stone bowls of salsa (red and verde) and a third filled with lime slices, making it feel a bit more proper. And the salsa actually has a good amount of heat! (I hate it when salsa has the same amount of heat as baby food [I'm side-eyeing you, Tito])The final bit, which I appreciated, is the radish. I remember dumping sliced radish into a clear plastic bag from the condiments area of the taco stands... and I forgot after all these years the importance of even just a couple radish bits to go with tacos.I docked a star partially due to price; I know I'm not in LA anymore and I know it's Hoboken, buuuuuuut tacos are meant to be cheap eats.Still, if I ever get the longing for a taste of the west coast, I know where to go, now.I'll be back, and I'll make sure to try each menu item. (But low key, I'm content with al pastor forever)PICO KEEP MAKIN' THEM DANK!!PS: try and pair them with an apple Jarritos! I did, and it was good! Def gonna wash everything down with my usual Mexican Coke next time, though!
2020-01-09,5,I don't think I have words to describe how delicious the tacos are at this place. Just the right size, right amount of meat and just the right amount of sauce. They are pure delight. Agreed, the prices are on the higher side. I mean who want to pay 5.99$ for a fish taco. But once you have it, I am sure you will crave for a second one. Hands down the most amazing taco place in and around Hoboken. I hope they do well and keep these amazing tacos coming.
2020-01-07,1,Order delivery to give it a try. One hour and 15 minutes later nothing. Called the store, no one picks up. Call Grubhub and they didn't pick up for them either. Good luck
2019-12-11,5,-quick service-large variety of taco options- beef, chicken, pork belly, fish, vegetarian, etc.,-they make bowls, nachos, loaded fries -1/2 tacos on Tuesdays-great interior decor -they make homemade salsas/sauces that you can put in small to go cups
2019-12-09,5,This place is great. I've been here a few times and the tacos are consistent and delicious. My favorite are the shrimp, carnitas and the steak. They have great flavor. They have now expanded their menu and added a few items. I can't wait to go back!
2019-12-04,5,My favorite Mexican spot in Hoboken!!! Their shrimp tacos are out of this world! Try their corn, just looking at it makes me drool taco
2019-11-27,3,The shrimp taco was good. It's a good takeout place. Not that great to eat-in.We got chips and salsa which was for $8. The chips were oily to the point, we could taste the oil in our mouth. Guacamole was given in a small cup not enough for the chips. The service was ok.
2019-11-02,2,Probably the worst " authentic Mexican tacos" I've ever had. The tortillas were bad. The chicken wasn't seasoned. Overall it was very bland and flavorless. Visit my Mexico over in jersey city if you want GOOD tacos
2019-10-26,1,Would definitely give a zero if I could. We ordered delivery, the order was incorrect, and none of the salsas were included. I called and spoke with Ralph, and he said there would be a refund. We called again to let them know that there was dirt (yes, dirt) in our food, and they still only refunded a portion of the meal. Stay away. Never going back.
2019-10-19,2,Got the Pescado salad bowl and a rice bowl with meat. Sadly the amount of fish and meat (which were flavorful) was much less than we expected. The bowls were primarily lettuce/rice so weren't at all proportional. Not worth the price we paid.
2019-10-17,2,The fish tacos are good, if a little pricey. But I got the pescado bowl and it had about half as much fish as ONE taco. I called to complain and they just told me I was wrong and that it didn't happen. It was basically just a bowl of flavorless lettuce.
2019-09-25,3,This place was great at first but the quality is slowly going down hill. We also had a bad delivery experience that they refused to correct & when we reordered at a later date our food was considerably worse. Kinda scared to order pick up again now.
2019-09-08,5,I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the tacos here and the interior decor. I came in when it was not very busy and had the carne asada. The vegetable ingredients were really fresh and there was just the right amount of vegetables. It wasn't drenched in sauces like a lot of other more Americanized taco places. Even the piece of radish that was served as garnish was freshly sliced. They opened relatively recently so I hope they maintain this quality!
2019-09-07,5,Awesome decor and really good food. Both preparation and quality of ingredients were great.
2019-09-01,4,Great tacos at fair prices. More like authentic Mexican vs Texmex. I get the pork al pastor every time I go and the shrimp tacos are awesome.
2019-08-09,5,Strolling around lookin for lunch and found this little taco place. I had carne asada, shrimp and fish tacos. I usually like the steak but this place has the best fish tacos I've ever had
2019-08-04,5,Great Tacos in Hoboken.  The Shrimp Tacos are Amazing. Love the Chicken and Al Pastor!!!!
2019-08-03,4,I was in the area and found this place. There are a variety of tacos to choose from. I ordered 2 fish and  2 al pastors. The al pastor is pork with pineapple and it was absolutely delicious. They gave me 3 different sauces for the tacos. There was a salsa verde, avocado and hot sauce. I also ordered the chips and salsa. That was okay. Overall I enjoyed everything I ate.
2019-07-22,4,Freshest Tacos in HobokenWent in on a whim after having heard that 'there's a new taco place in town'. We know it's hard to find 'authentic' street tacos in Hoboken so I usually go to Surf Taco. Don't hate, it's consistent.I ordered an al pastor and fish taco, and my co-worker got chicken and mushroom tacos. Hers came out first and the mushroom looked amazing! Service was pretty quick considering it was all made fresh to order. I really liked the al pastor - it was a solid showing of nicely seasoned and cooked roasted pork, onions and cilantro.  I was concerned that only 1 tortilla would fall apart but it held up. The fish taco was BOMB! you could tell it was all made to order and super fresh. Crispy fried Basa, crunchy cabbage, pico and a house made chipotle crema.  YUMHave to agree with other reviewers about the chips - they were definitely underwhelming and seemed store bought. The sauces were all quite good but the salsa verde was absolutely delicious!  Pro-tip - the sign outside said Taco Tuesday - all tacos half off. Really hope this place does well and they up their chip game. Regardless definitely going back the next time I'm in the mood for a great taco.
2019-07-19,5,I'm from Orange County originally- my man and I live in LA- I'm not humble bragging we know freakin tacos. We are in Hoboken, Jersey...what the hell are street tacos doing in a brick and mortar in Jersey? Ummm...making me fall in love. We are debating on moving here for these tacos. Melt in your mouth deliciousness- love the sauces, eat them all..collect them, marry them. Tacos A+++
2019-07-14,5,This is probably one of the best tacos I've had on the east coast. I got the pollo, nachos, and carne Asada and both were really juicy and flavorful. The hot sauces that they come with are also good. The interior is really refreshing and nice. Overall I'd probably come back!
2019-07-13,3,¿Mi Masa es New Masa?My lady friend and I got takeout around 7pm on Saturday. The tacos al pastor were good. Well, specifically the al pastor was good. The actual tacos, that is to say the tortillas, were no bueno. Unfortunately, what we were served with all of our various tacos, were prepackaged yellow corn tortillas (more like SCORN TORTILLAS), not the beautiful, clearly handmade, white corn tortillas that we had mentally prepared ourselves for prior to ordering. Perhaps they had a very busy Saturday and ran out by 7pm? Perhaps. I'm just hoping this bait-and-switch isn't a trend, or even worse, that those store-boughts are not the new delivery method for the very well-executed fillings.
2019-07-08,5,It's rare for me to get excited over...tacos. But have to say I look forward to ordering here about once a week. I'm paying the extra money to get fresh ingredients, hand made, super goodness in my belly. Newport Mall is less than a mile away if you want cheap Taco Bell. The employees are super friendly and enthusiastic about working there, not unhappy drones looking for a paycheck. This is a welcome addition to Hoboken, I hope they don't lower their standards like The Taco Truck did.Edited to add - I looked at the other upset reviews. You people realize they were doing a "soft open" when you wrote that, right?
2019-06-30,5,Tried the carne asada, al pastor, and the fish tacos. HOLY MOLY THE FISH TACOS! Honestly, some of the best tacos in Hoboken. The ingredients were super fresh and well seasoned. The tortillas are homemade (with love). One of the only soft tacos I've had that did not fall apart from the moisture in the filling. 2 tacos are definitely filling enough for one person. The tacos will come out with a giant wedge of lime and 3 different sauces. Get yourself some chips to scoop up all the goodness from your plate! I already can't wait to come back
2019-06-30,5,Tacos were super fresh, delicious, and ready in less than 5mins. We had the Al Pastor, Carne Asada and Fish tacos. Chips and salsa was also great. Will definitely be back for more!
2019-06-22,5,Best tacos in Hoboken. Coming from South Philly where there is a plethora of great Mexican food, this is the first that we've actually felt was even on par with the authenticity we are used to. Taco Tuesday is buy one get one on tacos and they are BYOB so this is becoming a weekly for us.
2019-06-04,4,Yes, there's finally a decent taco place in Hoboken.  (For you Surf Taco lovers, I'm sorry, but those tacos aren't legit; luckily pico taco has come to the rescue).  I like that it's stark white inside, but I'm not a fan of those red and white table cloths, even though it brings a pop of color - I think they can do it a different pay (color trim, maybe?).   Also, it did take a bit between ordering and when the tacos were delivered to the table and when it finally got to the table, we noticed the carne asada didn't have the guacamole on top, so it needed to be sent back to get the guac scoop... but it was okay!I was able to try 4 different tacos (barbacoa, carne asada, mushroom, and carnitas) during my recent visit.  TBH I wanted to love the mushroom, but I just didn't get it.  The mushroom was a little soggy and there was no texture to be found in the filling.   In stark contrast, I loved the carnitas though - it was nice and crispy how carnitas should be!    I'm definitely going to be visiting Pico Taco more in the future.
2019-06-03,5,I stopped by this place on a whim when they had their soft opening, and now I can't stop coming here. These are the best tacos in town, hands down, and probably some of the best in the entire area. They're fairly affordable, especially compared to Surf Taco, which is good but way overpriced. Tuesdays are buy one get one free too, which is an awesome deal. I think they need to work on their vibe a little... it's very sterile and strangely uninviting when you walk in, but the hostess/cashier is super cool and friendly. This storefront has been like 3 things in the past couple of years, so I really hope these guys break the trend and stick around for a long time. I'm definitely a huge fan (and I am very picky and have had real street tacos in Mexico many times).
2019-05-27,4,Excellent tacos! Inexperienced service! The food was very flavorful and very good. I love al pastor taco. It was meaty and flavorful with the right amount of filling to taco ratio. I love that the pineapple is grilled which adds slight sweetness to the taco. We ordered 2 Al Pastor, 2 chicken, and 1 chorizo tacos to go but we were given 2 al pastor and 2 chorizo tacos. Unfortunately we didn't realize we got the wrong order until we got home. It took 45mins to get our order and there was only one person in front of us. Needless to say we didn't bother going back to get the order rectify. Overall the food is amazing but the service has to improve. It's not acceptable to wait 45mins for tacos and then given the wrong order.
2019-05-26,1,Very disappointing experience overall. After taking 40mins to finish the order, one of the tacos was missing. After mentioning this to the staff, I received another taco but that was the wrong kind. For the price and experience so far, I won't be going back
2019-05-23,5,Pico taco has really good, authentic tacos. They have several meat options but al pastor is my fave.
2019-05-08,5,Just walked by and saw the sign outside, and I hadn't seen it before so I stopped by! I got the carne asada, the Al pastor and the shrimp. It was 3 for the price of 2 but I still ended up paying about $11, which is fine for 3 tacos but steep for 2. However they were delicious, and the carne asada was definitely my favorite. Will return when they have deals but probably won't pay full price
2019-04-19,5,We went during the soft opening and were really impressed. The place has a cute and clean style, and the menu is limited to a nice selection of tacos. Al pastor is my favorite and it was great. Really flavorful and you can tell it was made thoughtfully. Will definitely be back and will be sad once they're open late night and the lines out the door.
2019-04-10,5,Tacos were super delicious. Wife and I had the al pastor and carne asada. Will definitely be coming back to try the others.
