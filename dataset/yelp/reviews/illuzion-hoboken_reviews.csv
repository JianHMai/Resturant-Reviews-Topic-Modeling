2021-07-13,1,Food was terrible tonight! They are not consistent with sushi! Some days were good and tonight was not fresh and very fishy!i hope I don't get sick:(They just don't care and said over and over it's the same fish and that they get it everyday fresh. I said it was not fresh." I called to let them know I was unhappy tonight and was a  good customer. They didn't care .  I said then I won't order from you anymore. She said ok!  I suggest you look somewhere else for some good sushi. I read the same bad reviews noTerrible food and worse customer service! not cheap either!! We won't be ordering from them any more!!!
2021-07-13,1,Have ordered many times but tonight the special rolls tasted foul. We called to let them know the fish was not fresh tasting and they couldn't cate less. Not sure what's happened to this place but would not recommend this to my enemy...well maybe I would. Not fresh and even worse custom service. Do not order from here.
2021-05-15,4,This spot has good sushi as well as ramen. Both times I've gone I've had good service and didn't have to wait long for a table. Food was tasty - I'll definitely be back!
2021-05-08,1,I would give this restaurant negative star if I could  So ordered a sashimi regular tonight and got the food in 30 minutes. Not the first time to order from this restaurant. When I took the first bite of the salmon sashimi, I notice there is a stink flavor taste like it has gone bad. Then I ate other fish and they seems to be fine. So I took another bite of the Salmon, this time I threw up because I was 100% sure the salmon is not fresh and has gone bad. So I called the restaurant, explained what happened, and what I meant is to remind them check your salmon fish, maybe they are not fresh anymore and you don't want to serve that to other customer. The woman who answer my phone was so  rude, saying "our fish is fresh, we clean the store everyday!" Honestly, I called them out of a good intention and I wasn't planning to leave bad review - since I ordered from them before and I am always a big fan of supporting local restaurant in Hoboken, especially during this difficult time. But their response just shocked me. What an awful customer service!! Do you realize that people could die from eating un-fresh raw fish??  But then I read other reviews saying that the restaurant owner doesn't like to hear customer complains or suggestions and it seems that the owner never apologize for any customer's bad experience. The owner even replied to one of the negative review saying that "if this restaurant is not cup your tea, you should go some where else" WOW. Simply WOW. How arrogant is that but that just explained EVERYTHING.  Will never go back and will warn all my families and friends in Hoboken. And for the owner - you don't have to reply to my review, because I know you simply DON'T CARE.
2021-05-02,3,Average food, mediocre service, not dying to go back My brother and I ordered a whole bunch of appetizers & desserts, in addition to ramen. Food was nicely presented & decorated, likely to hide its mediocre flavor from you. Ramen was essentially flavorless...and very disappointing for a Jap restaurant. Nothing really stood out to me except for the food presentation.SERVICE: Slow, inefficient, took a long time for some dishes to come out (indoor dining)
2021-04-17,5,It's been several years since I've eaten here, and the quality is still excellent! Grabbed at an outdoor table; there were a few out distanced from each other.We got the chirashi lunch special which came with octopus, uni, fatty tuna, salmon, and yellow tail.  We also got the tricolor sashimi lunch special which came with tuna yellow tail and salmon sashimi.  Normally lunch specials come with soup and salad but apparently we could only get one.  And also got the rock shrimp.Nonetheless everything was delicious with quality pieces of sashimi.  Glad to see that nothing has changed over the years.
2021-04-09,4,Wide variety of sushi rolls and lunch options! For a group of four, we shared four special rolls. Everything tasted so fresh and flavorful. I especially loved the ones with avocado and mango. Service was pretty quick and they have outdoor seating. Each of the chef's special rolls was $17. You can definitely get better deals with the lunch specials that come with miso soup and salad. Would come again to try their other dishes!
2021-03-24,1,I understand that we are all in the tough time and restaurants are doing their best that they can. I'm mindful of that whenever I write a review. And we are all about supporting local business. But what happened this evening at this restaurant has nothing to do with this and realize that this is simply what they are (I read a couple of reviews of this restaurant before writing this and clearly ours is not an isolated incident) and we didn't like what we experienced.We have been eating out often enough to understand that sometimes restaurants can have off days. My sashimi deluxe was fine. She ordered 2 special rolls and the rolls were full of artificial coloring which made the rolls look very unappealing. Even tuna, we saw distinctive color difference between the ones they used for sushi deluxe and the ones they used for the rolls. I tried them myself and seemed like this artificial coloring was affecting the taste.But what irked us the most was the way the staff behaved when we made the comment. They got very defensive, practically yelling at us for not telling them sooner (but she didn't finish any of the rolls!) and someone who looked like the owner went on and on about how long they have been in the business (We already knew. We saw their website and their bio. That's why we came!) as if we didn't know what we were talking about. No "Could we get you anything else?" Or no "We will take this off the bill" None of that.  Their behavior was so inappropriate that it topped the food quality they served this evening We won't be returning and I don't believe we would be welcomed back either. We had so much better experience at Saku which is nearby.
2021-03-14,5,Delicious sushi and awesome service! This place's menu was very extensive! The sushi tasted super fresh and there were so many choices to choose from. I would definitely come back here for more sushi. Prices were extremely reasonable and the meal was pleasant!
2021-03-07,4,Best sushi in Hoboken! Loved this place- the vibe, location and amazing sushis. We ordered shumai, pork dumplings and sushi. Everything was on point and delicious.
2021-02-05,4,They got my order wrong and charged me an incorrect amount. I called to see what was up and I got yelled at in broken English. I saved the receipts and disputed with my CC company for a successful refund. In other news, the food was absolutely delicious! Might try again.
2021-01-09,4,I always liked illuzion. It is my goto place when I have my sushi crave I like their spicy pieces the best.  They are a tingling mouthful and a topper to your senses. They only drawback is when you have to wait but not their fault because they are always busy!
2021-01-05,4,This is my favorite spot for sashimi in all of Hoboken! Always fresh and delicious. The only downside is they're on the pricey side, but you also get what you pay for. Highly recommended!
2020-12-17,5,This spot had great sushi and we had great service while we were there!  I got the sweet potato roll and the spicy california roll and loved them both.  Please note that it is BYOB.
2020-11-28,5,Great service, good food--and I appreciated that unlike many Hoboken businesses, they are actually following the laws with regard to distance between tables. I'll happily go back.
2020-11-11,5,A great place to eat, where everything is fresh and delicious. Been there 3 times and each time I am impressed with the quality & quantity of the servings! Also they allow you to bring your own alcohol. There isn't a corking fee so feel free to bring yo drinks!
2020-11-04,4,BYOB. Good portions. Salad was delicious. They have a decent variety of food to chose from and their Sushi rolls were big and tasty. Sat outside during covid times and I had a good experience. I think it's fairly priced as well.
2020-10-15,5,We did outdoor seating (October) and it was perfect weather and vibes. Great sushi and Rock shrimp  fast service ! I love their spicy mayo here too, it's definitely spicy but amazing! Byob which is always a plus. Also, you must must must try their tempura ice cream!!!!! So good I wanted another order! Will be back
2020-09-29,1,DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!My wife and I ordered the maki lunch special which was quoted on their website as $12. When the food came we were surprised to find out that we were charged $16.50 per special as they have changed their menu.When we called to ask for a refund of the difference we were bluntly told that "you should of looked on our Instagram or Facebook as we don't use the website anymore". HOW IS ANYONE SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT! If your website is not going to show correct prices take the website down!When we pushed further they said the only options were to accept the charges or have them come back and take back their food. Until they can get down to 1 consistent price and own up to their wrong pricing to their customers, I highly suggest staying away.
2020-09-20,3,I had a box with rice, teriyaki chicken, sushi, a spring roll. It all tasted amazing. I'm not a big fan of there soup with tofu and spinach. The reason why this isn't a 5 star is for the waitress demanding a bigger tip. I was 3 buildings down and the waitress screams wait and we wait. She said we have to give her a bigger tip in cash, on top of the credit card tip.
2020-08-28,5,My boyfriend and I just happened upon this place, and I was blown away by the wonderful service and high quality of the food. Everything from the miso soup to the sashimi and sushi rolls were fresh, flavorful and beautifully presented. The outdoor seating was nice and quiet, and everything was perfectly completed with a red bean mochi ice cream. We will definitely be back!
2020-07-01,5,Illuzion has always been my tried and true sushi love in Hoboken.  I was sad to see them close when the pandemic hit because what else was I supposed to eat on meatless Fridays during the remainder of Lent?  I had to settle for less than, that's what. Cut to their return and I couldn't have been happier.  I haven't mustered up the courage to dine-in (outdoor service) yet, but I can tell you Illuzion's take-out was just as impeccable as I remember it being.  Ordered 3 specialty rolls and 1 sashimi platter and it was all delicious and fresh and not mushy like some of the competitors takeout has been.  Gotta also mention the shrimp tempura in the specialty rolls were still crispy as well, which if you've had sub-par shrimp termpura, you know how icky that could be.   Score because there was octopus and lobster in the sashimi platter too which generally doesn't even happen - whoo - treat your self! To top it off they provided ample ginger and soy sauce for the order -0 whereas I've had to dip into personal soy sauce stash for some of my other orders during lock-down. Anyways, I'm glad to have Illuzion back in business if you couldn't already tell.
2020-04-20,5,Please open again during this quarantine! Best sushi in Hoboken. We order here once a week. Rock shrimp is amazing. Their special rolls are all on point. I just wish they would upgrade their hibachi game. Maybe just one or two hibachi tables that have to be specially reserved.
2020-03-03,5,The best sushi & sashimi in Hoboken. Our favorite!  So popular that deliveries may take a bit longer, but worth the wait.
2020-03-01,1,Nobody answers the phone. Prices on their website menu are way different than prices listed for online yelp orders. It's just sloppy and not a good way to run a business.
2020-02-10,3,3.5*sI had not been to Illuzion for years, remembering it as mediocre to above average, but not exactly my favorite sushi place in Hoboken.  However, when my friend decided to have her birthday dinner there, I was looking forward to trying it again.  She was able to reserve a large table in the back of the dining room and even bring a pitcher of her renowned sangria, since the place was BYOB.  The patient server was helpful in addressing the questions some of the party had, and the staff allowed us to linger and close the place down long after we had finished our meal.  For my dinner, I ordered the Nasu Miso, which was broiled Japanese eggplant topped with a creamy miso sauce.  I had eaten this dish at several other restaurants and typically received it heavily marinated in a thick miso glaze, while this version was more of a light dressing over the separately cooked vegetable.  In a way, I liked that this eggplant was not swimming in miso, but I also found it less flavorful for the exact same reason.  I also opted for an Eel Avocado and a Shrimp Cucumber Roll, both of which were fresh and well-textured.  The service on my recent trip to Illuzion certainly surpassed what I previously experienced and wrote about in my initial review.  The food, while not overly memorable, was still enjoyable.  Lastly, the modern decor and BYOB option made the meal an even more positive experience.  I would now rank Illuzion at 3.5-stars.
2020-01-19,4,Illuzion was decided on after a long debate between Hoboken sushi restaurants. Came in at around 9 on a Saturday, and it was quite empty. We started with miso soup, which was delicious. I then ordered King Salmon Avocado, Yellowtail Scallion, and Shrimp Cucumber rolls. Presentation was lovely, and I particularly enjoyed the salmon avocado roll. The shrimp and yellowtail left something to be desired, and I couldn't really put my finger on it. Service was super fast, and we were out in 45 minutes. The place is a cute, small and typical city sushi joint. Since most sushi in Hoboken had similar reviews, I would be open to trying a different place next time I'm in town.
2019-10-26,1,This place has gone downhill. It's hard to believe that people rate this sushi the "best in Hudson County". Clearly they've never had fresh sushi before. The fish tastes slimy and fake. We ordered the other night and none of us could even finish our meal. I wouldn't recommend.
2019-10-15,4,This place is pretty good! Their rolls are good along with the edamame. And they have good tea too. One thing is that it gets really crowded and service can be slow. But overall a good experience
2019-10-09,5,Homerun!!!  Fantastic sushi!  Clean place and especially wonderful staff!  All the food was incredibly fresh!!  My favorite!!  You must come here for a great meal and amazing sushi!!!!  The best place in Hoboken bar-none!!
2019-09-26,4,The food was really good and the miso soup, wow it was superb! I would recommend Illuzion to friends and family.
2019-09-23,3,There is never a dearth of solid sushi options in Hoboken and Jersey City, and it had been a while sine I had been to Illuzion. I went in the middle of the afternoon, so the place was empty, and I got to sit up at the bar.I got their three maki lunch special with soup and salad, with shrimp tempura, California roll, and tuna avocado, all with brown rice. The soup was salty in all the right ways and the salad was just iceberg with a nondescript vinaigrette dressing. The sushi itself was okay, with the shrimp tempura being best with a little eel sauce. The other two rolls were just okay, and needed to be saturated in soy sauce to be enjoyed better. Other than that, the service was polite and the price point wasn't totally obscene. Overall, this wouldn't be my first place for sushi, but it definitely comes in a pinch.
2019-09-12,5,Just finished my spider ramen and my green tea tempura! Delicious! Service was good. Which is fine cause the place was empty anyways. No complaints here! Good fair pricing too!
2019-08-24,5,I have been coming here and ordering pick up from Illuzion for the past seven years. Every time this place surprises me with fast service, amazing food, and great deals. Not only is there sushi great, but their presentation is awesome, as well as their side sauce. They're also very willing to make same day reservation when it comes to the weekend crowd.
2019-07-21,4,The best sushi in Hoboken. Hoboken has boundless numbers of sushi restaurants yet somehow illuzion is the best in that it sucks the least. Prices are a little high but are worth it for tuna that isn't electric pink
2019-07-20,5,Been living in Hoboken for 6 years, and I've tried every Japanese place at least twice. I stopped going anywhere else except Illuzion. The sushi here is far and away the best. Fresh with top quality fish. On several occasions I've tried non-sushi options (usually teriyaki dishes) and I was similarly impressed. To top it off, Illuzion has the best fried ice cream.
2019-07-06,5,Best sushi in Hudson county. What is not to love about this local BYOB? The owner, Amy, greets you at the front door and remembers all her regulars. Items to love: the rock shrimp and gyoza for starters, the summer of hoboken roll and spicy bad girl are my go-tos. We always get the special roll of the day as well, usually they do not disappoint. If the blue point oysters are on the menu, make sure to order those too. They are fresh and delicious. Not only is the sushi fantastic, but so is the service and the staff. We love to sit outside, eat dinner and people watch. If you have a group of people, be sure to call in advance and reserve the top tables. They are great for groups and a little separates from the rest of the restaurant.Be sure to stop in for some dinner, you will not be disappointed!
2019-06-30,4,Great food, quick service, and cute atmosphere. I wish there was a bit more customer service but they were relatively nice. Prices are great too.
2019-06-28,1,I tried their $15 dollar lunch bento box twice this week. Just found add on tax is different for the same $15 lunch boxes.  Both 16.1 and 16.05 are overcharged based on NJ tax rate 6.625%. This is unacceptable and illegal. Please check your receipt very seriously !!!
2019-06-27,1,WORST SUSHI PLACE EVER!!!!!I used to LOVE this place and would order from here religiously. But all it took was one bad experience for me to never get food from here again. I placed an order through seamless and when I saw it was getting late I called the restaurant asking for an ETA on my delivery. Time continued to pass and I called again getting the same "he's on his way" answer. I got so fed up called seamless and they then told seamless the delivery man delivered my food but NEVER DID!!! 2 hours later and no food!! Horrible customer service and no desire to even fix their screw up! Save yourself people from the headache!!!
2019-06-20,2,Rude rude rude. Frankly there sushi is actually very good but after years of ordering from them, I can no longer look past the terrible attitude that permeates down from the ownership through to the staff. I've honestly never cared much about bad service from a restaurant if the food was good and that's because usually, bad or hostile service is rare and due to an off night by a staff member. But in the case of Illuzion, it is shockingly consistent: you will get a bad attitude and especially if you order via a delivery service. Besides the normal grumblings I get from the delivery man from Illuzion, he actually once complained about the $3 tip he received. Seriously? Maybe Id tip more if you didn't consistently complain about having to buzz up to the apartment, preferring instead that I come downstairs.These are unhappy people and I've finally looked to Jersey City to order online from for a comparable alternative without the poor customer service.
2019-06-13,5,First time stopping in here. I was taking a spin class in town with a friend and we decided to grab sushi afterwards. I was recommended two sushi spots to check out - we picked this one. This spot is also byob! Huge plus. My friend and I walked a block down to grab some wine to pair with our meal. The service was great. Our waitress was very attentive to us. We had a table outside given the good weather. We ordered one chef roll: Crazy Weekend and two hand rolls: Smoked salmon and cream cheese. Both were delicious but if I had to pick one. The Crazy Weekend wins. I will definitely be stopping in again.
2019-06-04,2,I recently ordered two rolls for delivery: salmon avocado and spicy tuna. The salmon avocado roll was good, but the spicy tuna roll was so fishy it was inedible. I've been here only twice since it re-opened and the first time was decent, but I will not be ordering from this restaurant again after the very fishy spicy tuna roll.
2019-06-01,2,I spent the weekend in Hoboken and wanted to try a local restaurant. The reviews seemed fairly good, so I decided to try Illuzion for the first time as I love Asian food. The service was the bare minimum, which was alright since my boyfriend and I were sitting outside talking, but if you want more attentive service, this is not the place. The food was subpar. The potato cakes appetizer was good, however my sushi had pieces of crab shell in it. I spit out about two of the pieces because there was so much shell in it. My boyfriend ordered a completely different roll and had the same problem. It was off putting and made me lose my appetite. About an hour or two later I ended up feeling slightly sick. Also, the online menu is completely different than the in house menu. About 80% of what is on the website does not even exist on the actual menu. Definitely wouldn't return or recommend.
2019-05-04,5,Just took a spicy tuna avocado roll, shrimp tempura roll, and tamago to go. It was delicious! Packed perfectly and ready so quick! I've eaten in before and liked it but this was also a great experience.
2019-04-28,4,Best sushi  spot in hoboken with a great staff, they do take reservations in advance but the party needs to be all present to be seated, I highly recommend ordering sushi here even though they do have a great selection of noodles and other authentic Japanese/Chinese dishes. Normally Grace works behind the counter and will seat you and she's the best person to ask any questions to, if she's not there I recommend a waiter/runner who's name is Prince (fancy hair style), there is street parking, but best bet is parking garage a few blocks away on Hudson St. You have to try their special rolls! Enjoy
2019-04-19,5,My husband would eat sushi everyday for the rest of his life and of all the sushi places in the area, Illuzion is always his preferred choice. Their special rolls are so tasty, our favorite is the summer of Hoboken (no rice, just avocado and it's soooo refreshing and delicious). The iron lady, rock of love, and so many more I can't even list are sooo good! The miso black cod, the short shell crab appetizer and the gyoza are also a prefect way to start every meal. Oh, and did I mention it's byob and the owner is the sweetest and most accommodating!
2019-04-16,5,This is my favorite sushi spot! Nobody can beat this service! The manager Amy is so wonderful and helpful, the service is amazing! Sushi is always FRECH, it tastes ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS and is 100% worth the wait!!! I have tried many places in the area and have never received such Amazing service! THANK YOU!!!!!
2019-03-24,3,It's my go-to spot if I'm craving sushi for lunch only. Their 3 maki roll special for lunch is inexpensive and comes with a side of miso soup and small salad. Service could be better - delivery is occasionally slow; and the one time I went to pick up my order, it wasn't ready and I had to run some errands before returning to pick up. If you're looking for a sushi restaurant for a nice dinner or date, try Saku instead on Park Ave
2019-03-19,4,Very solid sushi. You can tell it was very fresh. 4 stars instead of 5 because the service was not stellar. It was difficult to get glasses of water and utensils. I will definitely be back though.
2019-03-09,2,Halfway decent sushi served up with an overdose of bad attitude. Don't bother expecting anything resembling friendly customer service.
2019-03-06,1,Order delivery with a couple of coworkers after waiting for quite a long time the food arrived and my pork ramen ended up having a softshell crab instead. Not happy after paying good money for poor quality food that you can't eat. Never again.
2019-02-13,5,BYOB, friendly staff, tasty sushi. Need I say more? Ok. Usually order 4-6 special rolls (that's 32-50 pieces) which come with soup and salad. And then I ask what my wife wants to get. Haha. Great sushi spot
2019-01-25,4,Expensive but great sushi. Never disappoints, I get old man in the sea almost every time. BYOB which is nice, on Friday and Saturday expect to wait during prime hours.
2019-01-09,1,Do not order from this venue! Overpriced and extremely substandard. I ordered, received my order of salmon teriyaki which was way over cooked. ice cold upon delivery and disgusting in addition to 1 order of salmon sashimi which was not fresh and substantially smaller than any other sushi I've ever ordered. I've reported them to American Express and would highly recommend that you stay away. If I could give this zero stars I would. I will also add that the prices on their website menu are different (and lower) from the prices they quote over the phone. When I explained that to the girl taking my order she said that that had not updated their website. When I asked that she send me a current menu with my order, she refused. When I asked to speak with a manager she refused again. Needless to say I have disputed this charge on my Amex and will never order from this establishment again. There are many other options for sushi in Hoboken. Do yourself a favor and order elsewhere!
2018-12-21,4,We order from Illuzion pretty often and it is always pretty solid and consistent. There isn't a lot of flare to this place but the food is good.
2018-12-09,4,Really cute sushi place but pretty pricey for me. If you're looking for good takeout, go somewhere cheaper, but if you want a cute date night or nice celebratory outing this is much more suited.
2018-12-07,5,Fresh good sushi. Good vibes. We felt a little rushed because there was a line tonight. But the food was really good. The service was good also.
2018-12-01,5,I was looking for a new sushi spot because I just recently moved to Hoboken, I am so glad that I stopped in here. The appetizers and sushi rolls were to die for (especially the special rolls). It was also a BYO, which was convenient and saved some money. Cute location, great and quick service!
2018-11-28,5,I just love this place. I've never ate in the restaurant but I order from there super frequently. The sushi is really good. It's a little bit expensive but I think is worth it!
2018-11-18,5,Illuzion was a nice location to host a group of 11 friends. Food was good, service was also friendly. I did not have to wait very long for seating and the food came out in a timely manner. BYOB
2018-11-08,4,I am the biggest lobster fan and had a major craving for lobster tonight.  So I ordered off Seamless tonight.  Delivery service was super fast and my food was hot when it arrived.But I'm from New England, and I've been spoiled with real lobster.  So this didn't compare.Might try a different place for lobster next time.  But it wasn't bad.
2018-11-04,5,Not just GREAT food but a TRUSTWORTHY  place! I left my sunglasses and they saved them for me,  we came back 2 weeks later and they were there. I felt like homey!  Really recommend their grilled seafood with coconut rice and their rolls!
2018-10-28,4,The sushi was fresh and the gyoza was delicious. Service was very efficient. Will definitely try again!
2018-09-29,3,Been here any times for lunch and dinner. Also have ordered delivery and takeout.  Food is consistently good, whether its sushi or other items on the menu. Tuna tartare is my personal favorite appetizer.  Every roll is fresh and portions are just right. Shrimp shumai, various gyoza and rice dishes never disappoint. Service is fast and efficient and BYOB is really cool. Consistent I value that in a restaurant over anything else and Illusion does not disappoint.
2018-08-28,1,We were hoping to find a reasonably good sushi restaurant in the JC/Hoboken area, but this is not meant to be. I ordered a sushi deluxe with the description saying that it has 9 pieces of sushi. Typically, at a restaurant in the city, that would mean 9 "different" types of sushi. But I was naive, and it turned out to be only 4 types of sushi: 2 tuna, 2 yellow tail, 3 salmon and 2 mackerel. All of them were surprisingly bland. The rice didn't have much taste -- probably didn't have vinegar or salt/sugar. I had a taste of their dragon and avocado/eel rolls, and there were ok.
2018-08-24,3,It's a standard three-stars place. I love the sashimi of white fish & Scallop, very fresh and tasty. But sushis tasted awful. The rice tasted like raw with fried bread on it.
2018-07-18,4,I liked illuzion a lot. The sushi tasted fresh. It's a good casual place to come and eat dinner if you are in Hoboken. The service was fairly quick. I always have a difficult time finding a place to eat in Hoboken, illuzion seems reliable especially if you are craving sushi.
2018-07-11,3,The sushi is overall fresh, the kimchi was a surprising appetizer very fresh homemade and good.  One disappointment was the choice of sushi rolls.  The menu changed since we went last so we went with the special roll.  Every roll on the menu seems to have spicy tuna and lobster or yellowtail and quite pricey.    The special roll was very bland and had to ask for spicy mayo to give it flavor.   The chicken stir fry udon had excellent flavor except chicken was hard to chew.   Seafood soba was good.  Server was busy and not happy every time we had a request.  I felt like I was a bother.    Overall ok place for decent Japanese food.
2018-07-10,1,Worst service ever. I ordered through seamless and it said food should be delivered within 40 minutes later. Almost an hour and 15 minutes later, still nothing so I called the restaurant. The woman answering the phone told me that it was extremely busy and he was on his way and would be there any minute. 15 minutes went by and still nothing so I called back. The same woman said she would call the delivery guy and call me back. 10 minutes later and no phone call back so I called the restaurant back. She was extremely rude, put me on hold for about 5 minutes, came back to tell me the driver probably wouldn't be there for another 15 minutes at least (I ordered my food at 8:15 and now it's after 10 pm) I explained that I understand they're busy and likely just have on driver; however if your order delivery window is supposed to be 45 minutes and it's going to be double that, it would be nice to at least let the customer know that beforehand  instead of just telling me you're busy. She also never once apologized and actually told me to go ahead and cancel the order if I want and they won't bring me the food anymore because she has another 30 orders anyway.... This obviously was not appreciated by me who has been waiting patiently for over double the expected delivery time and is only NOW getting frustrated because yes, it's 10 pm and I still haven't eaten dinner and if I had known it was going to be approximately 2 hours before my food was delivered as opposed to the 45 timeframe listed online, I wouldn't have ordered from them. HOWEVER, the more aggravating part is that I call to check on my order and the company tells me they're going to call the driver and then call me back but then never actually calls me back. Then to make matters worse, when I call THEM back to see what the deal is, she essentially tells me they don't need my business and HANGS UP ON ME because she has to go (I quote "we only have one line and you're taking up all my time" as I  hear 3+ phones ringing in the background). To say I'm disgusted is an understatement. I RARELY wrote yelp reviews, much less one this in depth...but I'm still sitting here 2 hours after I placed my order waiting for my food, so I might as well do something productive with my time and try to help prevent other customers from having such a terrible experience. Side note: I realized after about an hour and a half of waiting that I've actually ordered from here before and the order that time as well was 40 minutes late and when they did actually deliver it, they forgot the second bag of food that had the appetizers, soups, etc so we had to wait all over again for those items that we already paid for because they can't refund orders placed online.If I could rate this as a 0, I would. At this point, even if the food is PHENOMENAL, I've been sitting here starving to the point where I had to eat something else anyway.....
2018-04-11,1,Absolutely terrible customer service. They don't care about the food they are making or their customers. All they care about is patrons in and out. If you ask for the manager they ignore you. I have never in my life refused payment on my meal. This is the first time. The manager is a terrible excuse for a human being. Wasted my lunch hour and didn't even have a meal because I lost my appetite after this experience.
2018-04-03,5,Beyond the best restaurant in hudson county  the fish is fresh food is always a+ quality is go there often with my kids and the waitresses along with the cashier ate very friendly it will always be my number one sushi place delivery is also fast mind you i live in Weehawken i would recomend to anyone eat dine and enjoy here plus is byob which is the be
2018-03-31,5,Illuzion is the best.  Great Prices & good portions.  Lunch special is more reasonable if you're on a budget.  Service is good and atmosphere is pleasant. All in all an excellent dining experience.  I have been coming to Illuzion for years & never had a bad meal.  A word about irate customers.  If you're unhappy with a restaurant regardless of reason don't call and harass the manager and staff.  Particularly in restaurants that serve foreign cuisine, the manager and staff may not speak elegant English.  If the restaurant attempts to placate an upset customer, if food is returned uneaten and the credit card charge cancelled, let it go!  Bullying and threatening to sue is beyond the pale.  Come on folks, write your review on Yelp and don't patronize that establishment.   Simple as that.  Judging by the way some people get on it's no wonder the world is in such a mess!Have a blessed Holiday!
2018-03-25,4,Ive eaten at their resturant and have gotten take out from them many times; Ive never been dissapointed. The food is really good and basic (but the good kind of basic). The resturant has good service and delivery is very quick. Also the shrimp risotto is bomb!! One of the best sushi places in Hoboken.
2018-02-13,5,Best sushi in Hoboken!! Very unique rolls.  The ginger dressing on their salads is purple with plum in it-- very good!
2018-02-04,5,Come here for the excellent service. Its a gem in midst of hoboken. Vry considerate staff, amazing ambience. Def coming back.
2018-01-24,4,Miso cod is to die forGreat portion, surprising these daysEverything else is just as greatKudos to you HobokenOnly time I'll ever say that
2018-01-13,1,Some of the poorest customer service I've dealt with in Hoboken. I went to pick up an order, it was incorrect, and while I was waiting for my correct order, the cashier had the nerve to ask for another dollar. This is the last time I'll eat here. There are plenty of other sushi places in Hoboken that actually have better food and service, this time was simply out of convenience but lesson learned! I'm still considering calling management to complain.
2018-01-10,4,Excellent and fresh Japanese food in a nice and bright space. I love the black rice and you can request it (like a dollar extra?). Squash appetizer and miso cod also delish. Great choice in Hoboken.
2017-11-28,4,I love this restaurant. I was introduced to it by my boss.  She used to order from here all the time when we worked in Jersey City.The restaurant is quiet during the weekday lunch hour. Prices are reasonable and the sushi rolls are fresh.
2017-11-13,4,Good for a quick and cheap bite. Rolls are mediocre. Enjoyed outdoor seating. So it deserves 4 stars. More casual bites. Would try again
2017-11-13,3,Good sushi and reasonably priced. I was very happy they were able to get us a table without a reservation on a Friday night. My one complaint on this place is how obnoxiously bright it is in there. Turn the lights down and make it more intimate!!!
2017-11-10,1,They gave me the wrong hand rolls in my order as a delivery, as it was a "lunch special" that came with soup, salad and two rolls. They didn't want to refund my money because they claimed I ate the soup and salad, so they started nit-picking the order because I ate the $2 dollar soup and a $3 dollar salad. Talk about CHEAP and now they lost a customer who will never order from them again over $19 bucks. HIGHLY do not recommend them, I will go to Okinawa every time now
2017-09-26,1,Indoor and outdoor seating available right on Hoboken's Washington Ave.  We ordered a California roll, shrimp tempura roll, one spicy tuna roll and a yellow tail roll.  Rolls were small, no attention to detail.  Avocado in the rolls were hard and unedible.  We called our waitress and told her that the rolls were hard, even the seaweed in the rolls was unchewable.  So we asked for the check so we could leave.  She comes back out with more sushi and tells us it's on the house.  We try the second set of sushi and it was just as bad.  No attention to detail or quality.We paid for our check and left extremely disappointed.  Never again.We have been on a losing streak with restaurants lately
2017-09-25,5,such a great place..I ordered the sashimi luch yesterday.it's very fresh ..I think this place must best in Hoboken .highly recommend ..
2017-09-17,5,I'm obsessed with Sushi, and this is the best of the best in Hoboken, they really know how to spot the best-quality  fresh fish instantly... BYOB and enjoy your date
2017-09-02,2,Sushi is ok nothing special,, more rice and cucumber then fish, very cheap on the fish,  waitress had a huge attitude... we came there to eat at 8pm, sat outside place was half empty,, I still had half my food on the plate and was talking to wife 20 waiting after we sat down  nasty waitress runs over and asks do u the rest to go, really lol we just sat down..plus they bring the whole order out first appetizers and main course together on a tiny table, unorganized.. plenty of other normal and better sushi spots in that area, deffinetly skip this place if you want to relax and eat and not be hurried out the door
2017-08-12,5,My wife and I have been going to Illuzion for over 10 years now!  The sushi is excellent and the service is great.  Extensive menu, and the sushi is always fresh.
2017-08-04,5,The absolute best sushi in Hoboken! Everything is fresh and amazing. The portions are enormous and the service is amazing. I moved out of Hoboken and I still come back the sushi here.
2017-07-26,5,My favorite sushi spot in Hoboken! Byob is a plus! Seaweed salad is always fresh. The rolls are creative and the bento box is plentiful!
2017-07-16,5,Best Japanese.. love this place... everything is good! From shrimp tempura to gyoza to spring rolls to sushi ... etc etc etc
2017-06-30,2,The food is average but their lunch specials are very reasonable. Unfortunately, the delivery guys are rude and they give me such a hard time for living on the 4th floor of a walk up. Hello!! You're located in Hoboken, most apartments in the area are walk ups! I tip them very generously too but I guess that doesn't matter. I use to order from them if not once a week then every other week, but I will probably stop. Very unprofessional staff.
2017-06-15,1,We usually order here for lunch to the hospital, but the last two times the sushi tasted funny...I guess it's the illusion of fresh sushi that's over priced...guess we're not ordering from here anymore. I only ate two and I feel sick.
2017-06-06,3,Most of the times i've been to Iluzion its been busy and very tight seating. I only recommend the sushi bar if you are starving and can't wait. The sushi itself is okay, not really worth the price. BYOB which is a plus.
2017-05-25,3,Went on a Wednesday and had no problem getting a table. The sushi was good, I've definitely had better and I've definitely had worse. I wouldn't tell anyone not to go here but I also wouldn't categorize it as 'can't miss' or anything like that,
2017-05-21,1,I ordered Chirashi and Udon. Udon seemed made of cheap ingredients and sashimi was not fresh. On top of that the delivery man was so impatient. He kept ringing the door bell at 11PM in night so I ran to the door to stop him. Then he yelled at me asking for tips, so I said please wait, I will come back with your tips explaining i didnt have time to take tips because I rushed to stop him waking up my roommates and neighbors. He did not understand what I meant and kept yelling at me and opened the door which was automatically closing and he attempted to enter my house!!!!I won't order here anymore. NEVER EVER!!!!
2017-05-19,1,I decided to order from Illuzion Sushi, I asked for riceless sushi rolls and they answered that they were not able to do them. I have been to many japanese restaurants both in Usa and Europe, it's the first time that it happens to me. I am very disappointed, on the way to Honshu in Jersey City probably the best sushi place around here, they do amazing riceless sushi!
2017-05-07,1,Do not go to this restaurant!  I went there yesterday and got terrible food poisoning!!!!!!! When I called to let them know they said that there was no way that this happened. It happened and it was awful.  For the good of your health, do not eat there!
2017-04-29,5,chicken teriyaki..great.. sushi fresh!!! the very rare grern tea tempura dessert..yummy!!!@
2017-04-24,5,My favorite sushi spot in Hoboken! The Invictus roll is the best! The owner is a lovely lady, she knows my face cause I'm there at least once a week lol They can be tricky with reservations but the food is awesome
2017-04-19,3,I was there on a Tuesday night and it wasn't crowded at all, when we first went no other customers were there and the staff was nice. I ordered the stir fried chicken with Udon, I wanted to substitute it for ramen but I wasn't allowed to(but the Udon was really good). We ordered the Crazy Weekend from the Chef's Special Rolls. It was pretty good. **I was charged $1 for spicy mayo.. that to me seemed super cheap of the restaurant to do, I've been to so many Asian restaurants and I've never been charged for spicy mayo** The tables are kind of tight but it wasn't  an issue like I said it was pretty empty so I didn't have to worry about being too close to others.
2017-04-14,4,Best Chicken Teriyaki I've probably have had. The only thing the bothered me was how close the tables are. But besides that food was great. Great service by the waiters!
2017-03-22,5,Best sushi! Moved out of hoboken and still come back often for dinner. Love this place! service great and sushi outstanding! Great portions of fish, definitely best place around.
2017-02-16,3,The sushi is amazing.   The staff is not very friendly, I wouldn't say rude...  But close. My order came to 9.00 and some change, I handed the cashier my credit card and she said $10 minimum.  I just looked at her, should I take my card and leave her and my order sitting there. So I said just charge the card for $10.  I guess I would go back. It's been 8 months and I haven't been back, so not likely.
2017-02-09,1,Ordered from here and they confirmed my order. They didn't make much of an effort letting me know that they cancelled until I called back at 2:30PM asking where my lunch was.
2017-01-07,5,Ordering Yelp eat24 from this place for probably the 5th time this week. So good and comes very quickly. Love it.
2017-01-07,1,I did Seamless from Illuzion. Possibly the most disgusting sushi preparation I have ever had in my life. My nigiri salmon sushi came with the skin half on it. I thought that was kind of strange but maybe I was being too picky. The piece was hard to chew because the meat closer to the skin is tough. I had to spit it out after a few bites, totally grossed out to chomp raw fish. The tuna was a gigantic slab of meat, probably an inch thick. Again, totally gross presentation. I threw everything out.
2017-01-02,4,The food here is very good and the portions are larger than we expected. It's a BYOB which is great. It's a casual  atmosphere. I made reservations the day of and my party was about 20 minutes late but they held the table for us anyway. The service was below average (we had to call a server over every time we needed something) but everything else made up for it. Over all I would return. Great for groups!
2016-09-04,3,Meh.Sometimes average restaurants live on for years due to good location. Sometimes good location provides an endless supply of customers, and there's no incentive to improve.  I suspect that's the case here.  I've had both delivery & eat-in sushi at Illuzion a few times and haven't been impressed.  I've tried a number of different rolls, and they all suffer from the same flaw:  below-average rice.  Their rice doesn't hold together well - the texture and consistency aren't right - and it also seems entirely flavorless and unseasoned.  Illuzion, please send your cooks to Robongi to learn better rice prep.  Beyond that, the fish and other ingredients that fill the rolls are just average.  In Hoboken, Okinawa (my #1) and Robongi (my #2) are far better for sushi.
2016-08-15,1,Ordered in. Sushi, noodles and Chicken Katsu for the kids. The Chicken wasn't good - The kids couldn't touch it and when I tried it was rubbery... So I called the restaurant to let them know and to ask them either to send a better one or to give us a refund. NO! The chicken is fine she said... rude and nasty... Will never order from them again
2016-08-12,1,My wife is pissed after being forced out from having dinner with a friend from out of town here. The owner came over to the table and told them their 1hr and a half is up and that they had to go. Then she approached again and lifted their wine bottle up and asked if they were done?! We have been going to this place for 10+ years and have spent a lot of money here, will never go back. If you are going to impose a time limit to enjoy a pricey dinner then disclose that to your customer before they sit down, don't treat them like tourists and push them out. Get a clue on restaurant management and how to time out tables to maximize sales.
2016-07-29,4,This place is a great spot on Washington Street, BYOB and outdoor seating are a plus. The waitress was very attentive and food was great. A favorite of mine.
2016-07-19,5,Hamachi Kama is absolutely delicious!! A must get! Nigiri is large slab fresh fish to rice ratio :-) salmon my favorite. The gyoza very good too.
2016-07-15,5,The dinner was great, the food is fresh and the taste is soooooooooooo goood. Recommended.
2016-06-29,4,This places rocks for take out, feels as though you are eating in the restaurant expcept in the comfort of your home. Unfortunately there delivery timeline is about 1-2 hours after you place the order. :(
2016-06-20,1,Please do not eat here!  I ordered vegetable spring rolls and two special sushi rolls for delivery and when I opened the cartons they smelled so fishy!  And there really is no reason a vegetable spring roll should smell fishy in the first place.  I tried a bite of everything -- what got me the most was the spicy tuna was gummy. Like a chewy, fishy, gummy texture.  Please save yourself the money and frustration and go to one of the higher rated sushi restaurants in Hoboken/JC.  Yuck.
2016-06-18,1,Illuzion was recommended to me by a friend so I decided to give it a shot. I ordered delivery, and when it arrived, I noticed while eating it that there was a STAPLE in my spicy tuna roll. I'm glad I noticed before eating it.
2016-06-02,1,Bad smelling sushi a disgusting sushi. Never order anything from here. Threw all after the first bite. I am wondering how are they able to sell the Sushi even after so many bad reviews. The worst customer service Winny the owner need to close shop. We WILL make sure this place gets shut down FOREVER. Anyone reading this. PLEASE REPORT what has happened to the Better Business bureaubbb.org/consumer-complai...
2016-06-02,5,Illuzion is by far my favorite sushi place in Hoboken. The fish is always fresh and there are so many choices for special rolls. Lunch special is a great deal. Highly recommend!
2016-05-24,2,After several times eating here (both in house and getting carryout) I've decided to stop giving Illusion my business aside from rare circumstances. The service is mediocre at best and the quality of fish is questionable. Their lunch specials are okay and reasonably priced, but they will give you a hard time for not meeting their credit card minimum although the price of the lunch is under the minimum? Side note - they're almost always playing weird techno-pop music. Rare for a Japanese restaurant. Bottom line is there are better options in Hoboken.
2016-05-19,5,This is my favorite sushi spot in Hoboken. Try the rock shrimp app and the block miso cod. They are always on time with deliveries and have great service in the restaurant. This place is worth checking out. They have outdoor seating on Washington if the weather is nice to take in some people watching. Enjoy!
2016-05-06,2,The prices on their website (also linked from Yelp) are not accurate. I called today to put in a lunch order. When I got my final bill it was a lot higher than expected. When I looked into it, the prices were all higher. For example the Sushi & Sashimi Lunch $13.50, is now $17.  Among other differences. When I asked about it I was told the website is wrong and the prices changed a couple months ago.    I'm sorry but that is just disingenuous. I get that prices change, that's fine but you know it's wrong still let people order expecting to pay a certain amount.   How hard is it to keep your prices up to date?  I cancelled my order I was so annoyed.I should add, that I live close to Illuzion, like their sushi, and have been their a number of times. But this just really irked me, and I need to say something in the hopes that they at least fix this. Then I'll consider going there again.
2016-05-01,1,I finally found a sushi place I love and then I get harassed about leaving a tip when I order delivery. Mind you I always tip. I spent 5 minutes or so on the phone with a lady that works there trying to first understand what she was explaining to me -- then I realized she was saying I must at least tip $3 to her delivery person. I thought that was rude -- because I always tip at least $3 or more. She went on to explain to me that her delivery person gets mad at her because he will drive outside of Hoboken and some people will tip him $1. That is not my issue. And if its been a issue than include that in your policy that outside of Hoboken there will be a fee. But don't have me on the phone for 5 minutes telling me what I need to do because I am not the person you need to be talking to --- besides who does this to a customer? Not to mention one of their delivery guys set my bag of food on the floor while I signed my receipt!! That was rude and I still gave him a $4 tip. Unfortunately, I will have to tell others not to patronize this place because of its poor customer service.
2016-05-01,5,One of my favorite takeout and delivery sushi places. Very fresh fish, great combinations, fair prices. My only warning: if you order on a busy night, it will take much longer than the estimated time. It's worth it and it is to be expected.
2016-04-07,1,I always order take out (lunch time) and pay with my CC. Last time, the lady told me that i need to spend $15 min. So tht they can charge my card. I was like what? That never happened before? She was rude and said if you want your food pay or leave.... I left! Not coming back! They need to learn how to treat customers.
2016-03-20,5,I've been here a few times and I'm never disappointed! The food is always great and I would definitely recommend the green tea tempura ice cream as a dessert!
2016-03-13,2,I ordered nigiri and it was not fresh. I couldn't it and the waitress didn't even care to ask why. When I ordered my food and tried to order nigiri, she was clueless. That should have been the first indication. I will never come black to this place that serves unfresh sushi.
2016-03-09,4,I have walked by Illuzion so many times and everyone inside always looks like they're having the best time. So I finally had the chance to go for dinner and had the spicy trio rolls: tuna, salmon, and yellowtail with a seaweed salad. Everything came out fresh tasting and full of flavor. I believe them when they say nothing is made with MSG. Also note that it is BYOB!
2016-03-04,1,Placed an order on delivery.com; 40 minutes later I get a call that they "don't want to deliver since are too busy " . If they continue this way , pretty soon they will never be busy . Hope this place goes out of business soon. Absolutely horrible service , horrible food , and horrible business practice .
2016-02-27,4,It's my go to for sushi in Hoboken. Delivery is consistent. Eating there is even better. Place gets very busy on the weekend and they aren't open on Mondays, it's also byob. Their chef special rolls are great and filling. The rock ship appetizer is AMAZING and addictive. If you order it I recommend getting it there and not for delivery so it is still super crunchy.
2016-02-13,1,If I could give this negative stars I would, and only for one thing. The delivery driver was SO MEAN I'm honestly astounded that this happened. The delivery came exactly on time, about 30-40 minutes after I ordered, but when the guy got there he literally YELLED AT ME because the drive was too far. Mind you, I live in the heights and this place is in hoboken. It was barely a mile away. He comes up to my door, shoves the food in my hands, and yells "THE DELIVERY WAS TOO FAR, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE ME DRIVE ALL THAT WAY, IT'S SO F'D UP!" I'm sorry, if it was too far someone from your restaurant could have called and cancelled the order? It's completely understandable to have limits to the delivery distance but if the place you're delivering to is within the allotted distance then why would you come up to my front door yelling at me?? And that's really something you should take up with your employer. It's not my fault that you had to do your job.
2016-02-10,1,Crappy and belligerent customer service. It took over 20 minutes for them to serve me two simple (and very mediocre) sushi rolls at 8 pm on a Wednesday night. When I asked where my food was they said "so busy!" Then they charged me for green tea. I told the cashier that I didn't want to pay for the tea because of the ridiculous wait. When she said no and that it was "so busy! there are a lot of deliveries!" I said I wasn't going to pay the bill till she took it off. She then declared that she was going to call the police! I repeated that I just wanted her to take the tea off because the wait was ridiculous and she kept saying that I drank it so I had to pay for it. A waiter came over and I hoped he would get her to take it off so I would go away. But nope. He said he was calling the police. I pointed out that having the police at your restaurant wasn't particularly good for business. She didn't care. I don't think they actually called the police. I stood my ground and finally they voided the first charge and charged me for my rolls and no tea. I left a $3 tip on a $12 bill (what I would have left on the $15 bill) because it wasn't the waitress's fault. couldn't believe that she was going to piss off a new customer.  This was my first time here and not only did she lose my business, I am going to make sure everyone I work with at the hospital a few blocks away knows how crappy their service is.
2016-02-09,1,Really bad service. Rude crew. My friends and i decided to have lunch here and we were waiting for another person so we reserved a seat for 5... As we all know its difficult to find a parking spot in HOBOKEN during Sundays so our friend was late for 30 minutes... The place wasnt busy at all so we werent being inconvenient by just keeping 1 chair. But one of the waitresses kept coming back asking if our friend was still coming... Mind you in 30 mins she asked like 5 times. Also we left a tip of cash on the table and some on our debit cards because we all had to pay separate.. And she was complaining about how we just left $5 on the table and failed to realize that some was on the debit card. SMDH.
2016-01-30,4,My go to Hoboken sushi restaurant. It's byob, quick but not rushed service, a wide variety of rolls and hot Japanese dishes, and reasonably priced.  The menu is 6 pages long so they have a lot of different options to choose from. During my last visit there, I tried their Rock Shrimp($11) with plum sauce which I loved. It was sweet, crunchy, and perfect way to start a meal. We also got a bunch of rolls including the old man and the sea special roll ($14) which had a variety of fishes wrapped together and a good crunch. Rolls range from $4-7 and special rolls are $10+ but they give a good size portion for the special rolls. If you go on Friday or Saturday night after 7:30, plan to wait briefly but it's worth it!
2016-01-23,5,3.5 stars? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? This place is amazing. The food is absolutely amazing. The rolls completely rocked my socks off! I recommend 100%!!!!!
2016-01-17,5,Lunch special is amazing! This is the spot I come to when I want to be alone with a cold one and a book. Service is alright sometimes I'll wait for awhile to get something but whatever cause sometimes they are just that busy. Only had a problem once when my friend forget her ID and the waiter was about to throw out the wine instead of letting me drink it , seriously I couldn't believe he was about to throw out the wine I nearly had a heart attack. That was awhile back though I've totally forgiven these people cause this place is that good. Definitely check it out with a date and wine. Oh and the miso soup is on point , it's the only place where it doesn't taste so salty.
2016-01-12,1,If this platform allowed me the option to not leave a star I would. Based on my experience with delivery through the service "Seamless" I would never give this restaurant my business ever again.  I will also continue to spread word of this horrible experience being the worst customer service interaction in my life.  On January 8 at 4:07 pm I placed a simple order of a Shrimp Tempura Roll & an order of Mixed Tempura.  My order was $13.50 and I chose to tip $2.50, now typically I prefer to tip in cash based on punctuality of the driver and experience with the drop off, I only had $2 cash on my so I was going to use my discretion whether I would tip more than what I had already charged on my credit card.  Fast forward an hour and my food still hadn't arrived.  If you have never used Seamless it's quite nifty, the service provides you with a time frame in which your food will arrive as well as an update of when your food order was accepted, prepared and left the restaurant. The time frame provided to me was 45-55 minutes...an hour and fifteen minutes later my food arrived, 20 minutes late. I opened the door and greeted the delivery driver and before he even handed me my food or greeted me back he looks at the order invoice and said to me, "We have a problem, we need to talk about your order" I thought I made a mistake or maybe they made a mistake and asked what the issue was. He then continued and stated, " you only tipped me $2.50 and where you live you have to tip at least $5, you can't tip so low you have to tip me more." At this point I was in complete shock that he would even have the courage to demand more money from me when he was late. I do not live far from the restaurant either, it's 1.2 miles from my home I didn't think this was an issue especially because the ONLY requirement while ordering was $10 minimum order, there was no tip minimum or delivery fee, nothing else. I asked him, " well is there a minimum? Because I didn't see anything online" his response was, " No there's no minimum but $5 is a good tip and if you don't want to fine! You don't order from us anymore. Order somewhere else next time!" The nerve of this delivery man...I was so confused and shocked. He just told me I can't order from them bc I didn't tip him 40% of my $14 meal! I took a couple deep breaths and decided to let it go, I wanted to enjoy my meal. I opened my meal and it was wrong!!! The roll I paid for was Shrimp Tempura the roll I got was a California roll. I ordered Mixed tempura which is supposed to come with shrimp and vegetables, I got Vegetable Tempura. To top it off my tempura was cold and soggy and my roll was falling apart, poorly assembled. I decided to call the restaurant and tried to speak to the manager. The first woman who answered asked me if she could help me with anything I said no I just wanted to speak to the manager and she was very persistent and kept asking me what was wrong.  At this point I felt like she knew I was upset and didn't want me to complain. After about four minutes of going back and forth about me wanting to speak to a manager I asked what the managers name was and she told me she didn't know and that she was new. I was in disbelief this was happening to me, then I asked to speak to someone else who was not new, she passed the phone to someone else but first filled her in on what was happening. The next employee I spoke to also wouldn't let me speak to the manager,  three minutes into going back and forth and trying to get the managers name she finally gave me the name Wendy, but that she was there.  I hung up very upset and feeling very swindled and all in all confused and like I wasted money and still hungry.  I decided to call the next day using the name she gave me, I asked for Wendy, the employee said she was not in I asked when she would be back the employee said she didn't know. I let a couple days go by and called back today, the same scenario happened, Wendy wasn't there and no one knew when she would get back. I am at a loss here. The only thing I can think of is take time out of my work and school schedule and visit the restaurant, which I might do. If you want to visit here don't!!!!! If you want sushi takeout, ORDER SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!!! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME, MONEY OR SANITY!!
2016-01-12,1,If this platform allowed me the option to not leave a star I would. Based on my experience with delivery through the service "Seamless" I would never give this restaurant my business ever again.  I will also continue to spread word of this horrible experience being the worst customer service interaction in my life.  On January 8 at 4:07 pm I placed a simple order of a Shrimp Tempura Roll & an order of Mixed Tempura.  My order was $13.50 and I chose to tip $2.50, now typically I prefer to tip in cash based on punctuality of the driver and experience with the drop off, I only had $2 cash on my so I was going to use my discretion whether I would tip more than what I had already charged on my credit card.  Fast forward an hour and my food still hadn't arrived.  If you have never used Seamless it's quite nifty, the service provides you with a time frame in which your food will arrive as well as an update of when your food order was accepted, prepared and left the restaurant. The time frame provided to me was 45-55 minutes...an hour and fifteen minutes later my food arrived, 20 minutes late. I opened the door and greeted the delivery driver and before he even handed me my food or greeted me back he looks at the order invoice and said to me, "We have a problem, we need to talk about your order" I thought I made a mistake or maybe they made a mistake and asked what the issue was. He then continued and stated, " you only tipped me $2.50 and where you live you have to tip at least $5, you can't tip so low you have to tip me more." At this point I was in complete shock that he would even have the courage to demand more money from me when he was late. I do not live far from the restaurant either, it's 1.2 miles from my home I didn't think this was an issue especially because the ONLY requirement while ordering was $10 minimum order, there was no tip minimum or delivery fee, nothing else. I asked him, " well is there a minimum? Because I didn't see anything online" his response was, " No there's no minimum but $5 is a good tip and if you don't want to fine! You don't order from us anymore. Order somewhere else next time!" The nerve of this delivery man...I was so confused and shocked. He just told me I can't order from them bc I didn't tip him 40% of my $14 meal! I took a couple deep breaths and decided to let it go, I wanted to enjoy my meal. I opened my meal and it was wrong!!! The roll I paid for was Shrimp Tempura the roll I got was a California roll. I ordered Mixed tempura which is supposed to come with shrimp and vegetables, I got Vegetable Tempura. To top it off my tempura was cold and soggy and my roll was falling apart, poorly assembled. I decided to call the restaurant and tried to speak to the manager. The first woman who answered asked me if she could help me with anything I said no I just wanted to speak to the manager and she was very persistent and kept asking me what was wrong.  At this point I felt like she knew I was upset and didn't want me to complain. After about four minutes of going back and forth about me wanting to speak to a manager I asked what the managers name was and she told me she didn't know and that she was new. I was in disbelief this was happening to me, then I asked to speak to someone else who was not new, she passed the phone to someone else but first filled her in on what was happening. The next employee I spoke to also wouldn't let me speak to the manager,  three minutes into going back and forth and trying to get the managers name she finally gave me the name Wendy, but that she was there.  I hung up very upset and feeling very swindled and all in all confused and like I wasted money and still hungry.  I decided to call the next day using the name she gave me, I asked for Wendy, the employee said she was not in I asked when she would be back the employee said she didn't know. I let a couple days go by and called back today, the same scenario happened, Wendy wasn't there and no one knew when she would get back. I am at a loss here. The only thing I can think of is take time out of my work and school schedule and visit the restaurant, which I might do. If you want to visit here don't!!!!! If you want sushi takeout, ORDER SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!!! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME, MONEY OR SANITY!!
2016-01-07,1,Don't write reviews much but figured I'd help warn a few people. My brother ordered some sushi and I ordered the teriyaki kitchen special with chicken. Both of us got sick, my brother was actually throwing up. I'd suggest going somewhere else
2015-12-30,1,Not good... Have some ok rolls, but I ordered Tuna Sashimi & came bleeding - TWICE!!! Yuck!!!!
2015-12-18,1,Coworkers ordered lunch from website, (which is under delivery.com). Site was having problems so we called restaurant to confirm order. lady that picked up was rude, when we asked to confirm order 4 out of 6 were wrong. We ordered beef for one person n they sent all shrimp (coworker is allergic). When we asked to correct order the rude lady said we could not and that she gets paid either way so we should just call credit card and cancel purchase. Asked to speak to manager, lady continued to be rude and stated to call my credit card and cancel. That they will just throw food away and still get paid. HORRIBLE customer service! DO NOT DO ONLINE ORDERS With them.
2015-12-09,4,I've only ordered delivery from here, but I've done so many times and the sushi is great!  I highly recommend the Heart Stealer roll.
2015-11-27,5,Amazing!!! Every specialty sushi sounded great! We ordered the crazy weekend the summer of Hoboken! To die for!!
2015-11-16,2,Update - went here again because my friend wanted to meet someplace convenient in Hoboken.  Mediocre food - place wasn't croweded - kids were seated in front so asked if we could sit in back and were told it was "closed".  Waiter rushed us - then we wanted desert but he just dropped off the check and never came back.  I'll make every effort to AVOID this place in the future.
2015-11-07,5,Amazing sushi!! I don't think you can go wrong with any of the specialty rolls. Spicy Bad Girl is extremely good but so were all of the others I tried.  It's BYOB and the atmosphere has a good vibe.  I will definitely be back:)
2015-10-08,2,Great food and this used to be my daily lunch spot while I was at work but they just changed the credit card minimum to $15 and I don't carry cash so I'm out of luck. I was really upset how I called and from one day to the next they changed the minimum and when I said I ordered everyday but now had to cancel with the new minimum they just said okay...apparently my business for the last 5 years means nothing. Disappointed.
2015-09-12,5,Illuzion is my favorite Japanese/sushi ever ! The obsession first came 2 months back when my boyfriend and I ordered delivery...fast delivery and extremely fresh fish! Also, all of the colors looked very bright which is important to me when eating fish. We've gone back twice in the past month to eat at the restaurant. BYOB is a plus, staff is friendly and the delicious food comes out quick. I have dreams about the food here, can't wait to go back !
2015-08-25,1,DO NOT ORDER A LUNCH SPECIAL HERE. I ordered the sushi/sashimi lunch special here, it being a few dollars more than their Hoboken competitors, hoping the quality would be better. It is AWFUL. Literally, two of the pieces of sushi are smaller than the width of my finger, and they didn't bring any soy sauce or wasabi. When I called to inform them, she was nasty and unhelpful and spent the whole time unapologetic and trying to convince me that $16 for a sushi lunch was somehow cheap and that I should've expected the quality to be poor. Go for Robongi or Yeung II for your sushi lunch - I definitely will be.
2015-08-25,3,Good sushi spot in Hoboken with outside seating. The service is prompt and food is yum. The illuzion frostee is quite good (lemon mint tea with coconut cream).  The rolls are good and i had a beef dish served over rice which was quite good. Prices are reasonable and the people watching can be entertaining.
2015-08-23,4,It was date night for my boyfriend and I, we knew we wanted sushi. This place stood out due to the fact it's BYOB. We went on a warm summer Saturday night around 8:30. I was happy we were able to get seated outside!!! For an appetizer we ordered edamame and the rock shrimp tempura--- AHH--maz--ing! I wish we ordered two orders of the rock shrimp it was absolutely delicious!!!  When it comes to sushi my BF lets me do the choosing from the menu for us. I chose the angry dragon roll, something about a slice of Mango on top of the roll just complements the fish so well! We ordered a few other rolls which were all fresh and delicious. I think I found my new fav sushi spot!
2015-08-12,4,Made my first visit to Illuzion this past Friday night with a friend. The menu  had plenty of options and I really enjoyed the fact that it was BYOB. The two of us had split the edamame, I got a small salad and my friend had the miso soup. I must say, both were generous portions and nicely presented. We had then ordered 2 specialty rolls and 2 classic rolls. All were delicious and I'm pretty confidant we will both be making our way back! The ONLY thing I would mention is that if you're sitting people outside and it's getting late, you might want to warn them that the outdoor seating closes at a certain point. (Since we were firstimers we were caught off-guard when finishing our meal and then felt a little rushed.) Other than that our experience was great!
2015-07-12,4,Illuzion's sushi is fresh and delicious.  We go here all of the time, but the deliver service is so much faster. The rolls are great but I prefer the sashimi. Either way, good sushi for Hoboken.
2015-07-10,5,The new special roll, independence roll was spectacular; Specially the king crab on the top, they look nice and taste better.I would recommend the Kumamoto oyster and the live scallops.
2015-06-25,5,Have been going here for a few years now. Illusions has turned into one of our go to spots. My husband and I always split 2 rolls each. (Try the spicy bad girl roll and mani salad) They are always fast with our orders and don't mind if we sit for a while and drink our wine slow. Also its a plus that it is byob!!! And there is a liquor store about a block away! Very well priced!
2015-06-09,1,Picked up a lunch special here for takeout. Between the tasteless miso soup, questionable fish and my rolls completely falling part it was one of the worst sushi experiences I've had by far. Will never come back here.
2015-06-09,5,Taros are melted in your mouth, fresh fish, as well as the kitchen food! The Black Cod dish is the best! I couldn't stop eating it! BYOB too! Great food, fun time with friends!
2015-05-31,2,Got delivery from here. First off a warning, their prices are wrong on their web site and is actually more expensive, but won't tell you that over the phone unless you ask. Very shady. They claim their web site just hasn't been updated in a few years and not to go by those prices. Very ridiculous. Also delivered food without any utensils (not even chopsticks for sushi). Very poor service indeed.
2015-05-24,3,If I could give three and half stars, I would. However, they only had one visible server on a Tuesday night who was clearly serving at least 8-9 tables at a time. It wasn't his fault but we had to ask for the check a couple times. Even if they chose to have one additional server, the service people received would be that much better. As far as the food goes, we had the vegetable spring rolls which were okay. Then, I had the grilled seafood with coconut brown rice which was delicious! I would consider coming back to dine in and give them another chance.
2015-05-21,4,sushi was good and fresh. servers were attentive and patient with us as we studied the menu. since we were with our dogs, we sat outside, but they didnt forget about us. i had regular rolls, including an eel roll which i particularly liked. my friend had the sweetheart and the brave heart, she enjoyed them both.
2015-05-11,1,Worst place i've been to in Hoboken. The service was so bad that we kept contemplating having to go inside to see if the waiter forgot about my table. The place wasn't even crowded so it was completely unacceptable. To make things worse, the was food was disgusting. I'm not going to be bias and say every roll is bad but please do yourself a favor and stay away from the chef's special dancing lion roll. Unless you plan on throwing up that is....I don't plan on ever going back to this place.
2015-04-30,4,I usually come here for sushi but I love that they also serve ramen. It's delicious and portion is generous. I frequent here often for both lunch dinner, usually on weekdays. Service is always quick!
2015-04-26,1,I just came from there. I was supposed to have dinner with my husband. The moment I walked in, the placed smelled fishy. One would say, well it's a sushi place. It should smell like fish. Well again, it shouldn't. I'm there to eat sushi but not to smell it. It was an off moment. The waiter sat us down, offered to get us something to drink. Everything was fine until I got my order. I ordered Edemame for a starter and it came out more of pods than actual peas. They barely had any peas in them to be eaten. As an entre, I had Chameleon rolls and something that had Paris, also another kind of rolls. They were both gross and tasteless. The Chameleon was too fluffy that the roll broke once I tried to pick it up. What was really annoying and disgusting was when we asked for the check. They still added the rolls I didn't eat to the bill. I had one from each and they still made us map for it, although I made it clear to the waiter that I didn't like them. That was the cheapest place I've ever been to and I'm never going back there again.
2015-04-23,4,Illuzion is our go to sushi place for girls nights.It's BYOB and the menu is huge, so there is always something for everyone.We usually start out with some smoked edamame, rock shrimp, shrimp shumai and gyoza - all fantastic.We then usually each get one special roll for dinner which always fills us up. They're pretty large!  My go to roll iis the Blue Heaven - the fish is nice and fresh and flavorful so I like to taste it without a whole lot of other flavors (spicy mayo, tempura, etc).I've tasted a few other rolls though and they're all really good.The fried ice cream is the best way to end the meal. One order usually feeds 4 or 5 of us just perfectly. Of course sometimes we need chocolate and order the lava cake too.
2015-04-22,4,I went here last night and I must say the service was fantastic and the food arrived very quickly to our table. My boyfriend and I split the Mango Avocado and the Chicken  Tempura roll and they were both quite delicious. Next time I plan to try some of their specialty rolls.
2015-04-11,4,I ordered veggie udon and it came noodles. Ridiculous. But I was chatting with friends so I didn't bother talk to the waiter about it. The noodle soup is very light, which is good. Entree comes with salad and despite of its pinky color dressing, it tastes good.
2015-04-05,5,The food and service are always great! Staff is always very attentive. Definitely a good place to frequent for dinner :)
2015-04-03,5,Illuzion is awesome. If you have not tried their specialty rolls, you're missing out. And that's not just my opinion -- whenever I take visitors from out of town to dine at Illuzion, the majority of them ask to return on their next visit. In fact, quite a few of my friends make the occasional trip to Hoboken specifically to dine at Illuzion. Plus, their delivery is *ridiculously* fast. They're usually knocking on my door within 15 minutes, no joke. They also have their ordering down to a science. It takes me a few seconds to order delivery over the phone as they are able to retrieve both my address and credit card number using my telephone number. I'm a big fan of this restaurant. I hope they remain a fixture in Hoboken.
2015-04-01,4,Delivery was very fast, the food arrived exactly 25 minutes after I ordered through Yelp/Delivery.com. The miso soup was still hot. Ordered the Assorted Sushi (8pc sushi) which had huge pieces of salmon and tuna on rice. Spicy tuna roll was standard. Regular rolls come in 6 pieces. I would order from them again, the fish was fresh and most reviews show that the food quality is consistently good.
2015-03-15,4,My favorite sushi spot in Hoboken. Perfect for a quick bite after work or a weekend lunch. Though it's BYOB, the staff is always willing to open a bottle and the menu itself is varied and delicious. The only downside is that it can fill up quickly - but other than that, this is a great spot.
2015-03-14,5,It's a great sushi place. The fish is always fresh and full of flavor and they have some great hot dishes too. We usually order the sushi & sashimi combos and the spicy rolls. Salmon Spicy, Tuna Spicy and Yellowtail Spicy are the best ones. Full of flavor and with a little crispy inside. The California Spicy is also great for non-fish lovers. If you are looking for hot dishes go for the Shrimp Teriyaky or Lemongrass Scallop & Shrimp, they are great! It's a BYB place so feel free to bring your favorite wine!
2015-03-13,4,The freshest sushi in Hoboken! Must try their appetizers, rolls, noodle udon stir fry with seafood or veggies.
2015-03-08,5,Illuzion is my go to for sushi delivery. They're fishi is delicious and clearly fresh, and they put something on their edamame that makes it extra super delicious - however, it's an MSG free establishment which is awesome! Their portions are huge for not being that pricey. They are always incredibly fast on delivery - the last time I order multiple rolls, my hot was hot and the order came in under 15 minutes (I'm not exaggerating, I think they must be wizards.) I tried going in person once in a Saturday night but there was a long (40 min wait), so just be aware that a lot of people know how awesome Illuzion is so it is hard to get a seat during their busy times in the physical location
2015-03-06,1,I placed an order for delivery. They said 20-40 minutes and it took over 1.5 hours. When I called to get a status on my order the women yelled at me and hung up the phone. Finally, the food came but it was the wrong order.  Stay away. They are rude and unprofessional.
2015-03-05,3,I just got the worst takeout I've ever gotten from here so I have to vent... I got noodle soup. There is no broth in the soup. Just noodles. It gets worse. The noodles are so overcooked that I'm sure whoever cooked them took a nice long nap and packaged them while sleep walking. No conscious chef would serve this to a paying customer.This place has good ambience (+ 2 stars) but suffers the same problem that every single "Japanese" restaurant in Hoboken suffers from- totally inauthentic food that is cheap quality (+1 star for food). This town is too close to Manhattan to be filled exclusively with such boring crappy restaurants.
2015-02-24,5,best sushi ive had in hoboken! Vegetable and pork dumplings are amazing also!!
2015-02-08,5,I love this place!!! The staff is fantastic fromThe service to the management!!!! The food is fresh and delicious - the sushi is fresh and unique. And the soba noodles!!! I couldn't remember and I described the dish and the waiter knew exactly what I was talking about. It's byo which is great because you don't feel guilty about indulging!!!! The manager was so inviting and a breath of fresh air. She made us feel valued !! We'll be back!!
2015-02-06,1,I will never, ever eat here again. I used to come here all the time, as I loved the menu and specialty rolls. However, I will never eat here again. The last three times I have ordered delivery, the order has arrived to me incorrectly. The first time they brought me two tuna rolls instead of salmon, the second time they forgot part of my order, and this most recent third time they delivered me a completely incorrect bento box. When I called this time to complain, the extremely rude hostess started screaming at me, telling me that I had ordered my own food incorrectly on delivery.com.I read her my emailed receipt and she accused me of lying and told me to not order again or come back. Don't worry, I will NEVER again!  I am absolutely appalled at this behavior- let alone the fact that this same restaurant had delivered me completely wrong meals three times in a row.I will absolutely NEVER eat in, or order from there again. The food is alright, but far too expensive to have to deal with disgusting customer service. There are way better sushi options in Hoboken!!!
2015-01-12,5,Illuzion is a casual Japanese restaurant, foods there are delicious and fresh. Tartar is pretty good. Staff are nice. Very clean, prices are fair.
2015-01-03,4,I get what people say when they downgrade for the service, but the fact of the matter is that yes, sometimes the waiters/waitresses can be awkward, but in all my experiences, they are fast and attentive. Additionally, the staff is friendly, as they are always quick to greet when you enter the door and take your name and/or seat you. The regular rolls are nothing special, but again, that's regular rolls. The speciality rolls are good, but the sashimi is fantastic. It is the freshest sashimi I have purchased out of all the sushi places I have dined at. The stir fry udon entry is also very flavorful and has a generous amount of seafood for only 12.50.Once you  go to Illuzion, it will be hard to find fresher and better cut sashimi elsewhere in Hoboken and the surrounding areas. And the environment is tight, but cozy. the color scheme works, and the spacing between tables is exactly what you would find in the city. Not sure if that's good or bad, but people on here are making it out to be like the environment sucks, and that is just not the case.
2014-12-02,4,Wow! Ordered their lunch special to be delivered. 3 maki roles. They give you a bunch of choices so I opted for the California, Spicy Tuna Crunch, Spicy Salmon Crunch. It arrived promptly with a miso soup and small salad for around $13.50. I am very pleased with the price vs quality and how quickly it was delivered.I have not dined in their restaurant but I think their lunch deal is one of the best in Hoboken if you are looking for something other than pizza, wraps, and subs. This is my first time ordering it so I hope tit is as good next time.
2014-11-23,5,The food is great. Specially their lunch special. The waitress is so friendly and nice.
2014-11-16,2,The sushi I thought was good. My waiter on the other hand...she kept getting my order mixed up had to repeat several times I don't know if it was that complicated I only ordered 2 special rolls and one hand roll. when she had brought my order it was missing the hand roll.... whatever i just ordered again still no biggie...however rather than do that and admit to her own mistake or simply say ok let me get you that...she was on a mission to prove to me I had "made things up" and I "lied" on purpose. Wow...completely unprofessional made me lose my appetite and she just would not drop the subject either.  Maybe completely new to the business..? either way did not get compensated for this insult will not come back. Plenty of good sushi places with respectful waiters.
2014-11-11,1,I normally never write reviews. I just had to for this place.THIS PLACE HAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER SEEN.My birthday was on a saturday night, my fiancé planned a surprise party for me with 15 people. First of all he made the reservation for 6:15, i thought it was just the two of us. We got there at 6:20 and the restaurant called him 8 times, because we weren't there at exactly 6:15. I walk in the door, he had called to tell them earlier it was a surprise. We walk in and they say your late with a big party in the back. THERE GOES MY SURPRISE. They rush us the entire time, they are mean to my guests, they can't even understand what we were saying and got 4 orders wrong. Then they give us the bill and we paid. The waitress comes over to my fiancé and says 500$ bill and only 5 dollars tip? instead of saying the tip is not included. I mean who doesn't include the tip in a group of 15 people. Most ridiculous. I can't. This place is freaking horrible.
2014-11-08,1,Made a reservation on a Tuesday for Saturday night. (Early at 7:00 ) for 8 of us. They had a table that only FIT 6. WTH??? seriously? Tell us you can't accommodate and we will be happy to take our business else where. With that being said....Food was mediocre although fish was very fresh. Service is good. And BYOB is a plus. But the fact we were stuffed in our seating arrangement ....made the dinner a very uncomfortable situation. Won't go back. SORRY
2014-11-02,2,Atmosphere a bit too lit up and close to others. So seating was a bit awkward. Food was okay, sushi rolls were average and not extremely fresh in taste. Miso soup a bit cold. Waiter was attentive. Overall would go back if Robongi was not open.
2014-10-27,4,This place is definitely a go-to for me for sushi. Its always fresh and they have a nice variety of rolls at decent prices. They gyoza was amazing. Definitely get some of that as an app. The sweetheart roll, autumn of new york, and bulli were all so good. I loved them all.. BYOB which is great! They have outdoor seating for those nice nights out.
2014-10-18,2,Poor service, awkward atmosphere, and sub-par food made for a less than stellar experience.
2014-10-07,5,My husband and I stumbled upon this gem when deciding where to go for our anniversary.  It was nice, quiet and inviting.  The BYOB aspect is perfect in allowing us to enjoy our favorite wine while enjoying their many delicious dishes.  The wait staff was very pleasant as well.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice casual night out. You also get so much for your money!
2014-09-20,4,Best sushi in hoboken, that isn't saying much though.  Stay away from tempura, not good.  The sashimi is excellent.  Fried rice is great.  I come here every month or so and always enjoy it because I know what to order.  Delivery is also good, always fast.  Other good items: king salmon, salmon and avocado, sashimi appetizer, all rolls without tempura, miso soup, live scallop.
2014-09-18,3,Had a great meal here! So delicious! And beautiful preparation.  We had miso soup, tempura, sashimi, and 2 rolls.  The sashimi are 3 pieces per order, and very large pieces, so my dear husband ordered wayyyyyy too much. Still in all, he was shocked that the bill came to only $75. I guess drinks add up!  There is a deli down the block, so we ordered, he had ran out and grabbed some great beers while they prepared our meal.  I LOVE sashimi that is nice and thick. Monster Sushi in NYC has this style, and I prefer it over small, thin slices.  Hmm, I am drooling thinking about it now.Service was very practical and cursive. We like to eat at the bar, and the waitresses were yelling orders right by my ear the whole night.  I would LOVE to return.  However.  Hoboken being Hoboken, this place was frackin loud- louder than a bar. There was a table of 6 cackling geese behind us.  You know the cackling geese.  There are large groups of these noisy 20-something geese all over Hoboken.  Listen.  Hint little girls.  There is a reason you are with a pack of GIRLS every weekend, and there is a reason there were no MEN at that table behind us. Delicious, albeit loud, sushi.
2014-09-13,3,Illuzion is my go to sushi place in hoboken. They are the only ones who have pumpkin rolls and mango avocado rolls on their sushi menu! Their food is always consistently good and they have great prices for their lunch specials. I usually order either 3 rolls or a bento box. They have a nice selection of rolls so you should have no problem finding something to order. They lost a star because there is almost always a weird smell inside when i go; a cleaning fluid smell like bleach or windex. Another star because their service is just okay. Ive had experiences where i've waited forever to have my order taken. I absolutely love their food though so i remain a loyal customer whenever i want japanese food in hoboken!
2014-09-07,1,I would never go to this place again. Horrific customer service. Walked in and waited 20 minutes to even be acknowledged by the staff. When I asked to put my name in and how long the wait would be, the man and woman working the counter were extremely rude and acted like they couldn't be bothered to give me the time of day because they were too consumed with taking orders over the phone. Maybe next time you should pay attention to the people who are actually in your restaurant! Saw a number of people walk out for the same reason.
2014-09-02,1,I would never eat here again found RAT SHIT  onthe bench seating of dining area.  When I had asked the to clean it they acted like they did know what RAT SHIT was. Come on now . You guys are running restaurant . I reported them to Hoboken Board of health. I would give no stars. EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK! Reported to Hoboken Board of health
2014-08-24,3,Came here for dinner outside it was nice to sit outside in Hoboken. Food was good. Sushi isn't my favorite thing but they do it well here.  I will be returning.
2014-08-23,5,Best bento box in hobo!! They give you a ton of food and it is all so fresh and tasty. Try to go before 4pm so you can get the lunch box special
2014-08-23,4,Thank you for brown rice as a swap out! I love sushi but I like my whole grains too. I know, I know they put sugar in the sushi rice but still it's nice to have the option of brown every once in awhile. Food came out pretty quickly but service was slow with the check. Seaweed salad was good and my spicy scallop hand roll was yummy. Salmon roll was ok. Lots of vegetarian and vegan choices if you have the need.
2014-08-19,4,Have dined in and ordered delivery. I tend to stick with sushi and sashimi basics rather than the kitschy crazy rolls. I find the sushi here to very fresh with generous portion sizes. Have tried a few entrees, which are also fresh and well prepared. The udon and ramen bowls are downright yummy - I believe that's the technical term. The prices across the board are reasonable for the quality of the ingredients. Yes, the service is a bit inconsistent. When they're busy it can definitely be tough to get a refill on a water, for instance. Not a deal breaker for me.
2014-08-15,3,We were relieved to find out that Illuzion; a Japanese fusion restaurant located at Washington street in Hoboken was open for business during the holiday. We came here for dinner to cap our Memorial Day weekend road trip to Pennsylvania.It was late at night when we got here and since the weather was pleasant, we decided to sit outside the restaurant.The waitress introduced herself to us and handed us the menu almost immediately. There's wide variety of dishes to choose from the menu. From sushi rolls to hibachi, teriyaki and tapas. I selected the "spicy rolls medley" that consist of spicy tuna, spicy salmon and spicy yellow tail rolls served with miso soup and vegetable salad with ginger dressing.There's nothing particularly outstanding about the food, I certainly have eaten better rolls before but it was decent and they do have a solid customer service.I will certainly visit this place whenever I'm in Hoboken, especially now that I know that it's BYOB and they don't add corkage fee!
2014-08-14,5,5 plus stars. Not only meet but exceeded my exceptions. Miki our server was great she did not miss a step she was on top of every thing. Food was amazing hit all my taste buds. They give you a lot of food for the price point. In fact the avocado salad should be more then $5.50 The decor is very cool hip but not to load. Love the brick exposer. Large seating area inside and out. VERY CLEAN!!Love this place will be back very soon
2014-08-11,1,Horrible experience. We went here on a pretty dead Sunday night and the service was horrendous. It took about 15 minutes for a waitress to come over to our table and bring us waters, and another 15 minutes for her to even ask us if we wanted to appetizers. She could barely speak english, and when I asked for two of the rolls for my entree, she had to have another waitress come over because she couldn't understand me. She ended up getting the entire order wrong, and brought out all of our entrees (4 of us in total) about 20 minutes apart from each other. The appetizers were good, but no utensils were provided until after the fact. The sushi was probably the worst sushi I ever had. The rolls were extremely small and tasteless, and the rice fell off the rolls upon picking up the sushi with chopsticks. Also, the couple sitting next to us had both of their entrees messed up and look just as annoyed. I'm not a foodie or snob at all, and am pretty easily pleased when it comes to service and dining, but this was such a bad experience I just had to write a review.
2014-08-06,2,This is really a 2.5 star review but half points don't count.  The food here is delicious!  Big pieces of fish and nice size rolls.  Salmon sushi was fresh and had great color.  Tasted like butter.  The special rolls were good and well portioned for the price.  BYO keeps the price down and that's never a bad thing.  I thought it was odd that they left out pre-made shrimp and veggie tempura on top of the sushi bar.  Most places make it fresh which I prefer but I guess its better if you're really busy?  It wasn't covered so didn't seem all that sanitary.  Most of the chefs had gloves on except some official looking dude who was wrist deep in the spicy tuna.  The service at this place is for the birds.  We had a very nice but very awkward waitress who didn't seem like she had been working for very long.  Of the two specials rolls that were ordered 1 was found to be incorrect after the date ate the first piece.  Normally no harm no foul however when we asked our waitress to bring what was ordered she gave us this blank stare and said "ummm hold on".  She proceeded to walk to the sushi bar, exchange some banter with the chef, throw some side eye, and then walked past our table with a wave of her hand "it's fine."  Ummm what's fine?  We asked her again to bring the correct roll and leave the one that was ordered.  Mother manager arrives and was very nice and said that they would make the correct roll.  We thanked her however I couldn't help but laugh when the roll arrive in 7 pieces.  "How come their are only 7 pieces mother manager?"  "Well you already ate one piece."  I was floored by this lack of customer service as well as terrible business practice.  The food is great but service was a HUGE disappointment.
2014-08-01,3,Great sushi but if ordering for delivery beware of their bait and switch price.  They charged us $10 ($2 per roll)  more than what was stated on their website menu.
2014-07-28,5,My husband and I am self-proclaimed sushi snobs. We really think this is (by far) the best sushi place in Hoboken. The fish is so fresh, fish to rice ratio is perfection, brown rice can be substituted free of charge and it's BYO. I haven't tried the hot food but it always looks really good too. The staff is friendly, service is good and if you want delivery it's surprisingly good too!
2014-07-21,3,Came here for the lunch special over the weekend.  It's a pretty good deal in terms of pricing, but the sushi was mediocre.  I also had their Kani Salad which in my opinion was better than their sushi.  This is a good place to go for the deal but if you want good sushi this might not be the place for you.
2014-07-18,5,I adore this place! Great sushi, tranquil ambiance, and very reasonable pricing for Hoboken. I came here for a friends birthday dinner earlier in the week and then again on a Thursday night, both nights were pretty busy and even still the service was up to par. Loved it so much I went twice in one week!
2014-07-18,1,I think i got food poisoning from this place so stay away! the minute i walked in it didn't smell right but im picky so i just let it go thinking it was just me.. we got our sushi and it was average nothing great, the next day thats when it went down hill! worst experience ever!
2014-07-15,3,I'm not in the mood to go into a ton of detail on this one....so I'll be brief.  Some of the menu items are very pricey so be careful of what you order if you don't want to get crushed by your bill.  Last night I ordered 2 of the 'cheaper' things for delivery.   I got the spicy scallop roll and the Beef Don (rice bowl).   The scallop roll was not very good.  They use very little actual scallop.  It's ground up scallop mixed with a lot of crunchy filler....and it's very small.  However the beef don rice bowl is AMAZING  This is one of my favorite dishes and I've tried them at every Hoboken sushi restaurant.  This is the best one I have tried.
2014-07-10,3,I like their bento box for lunch, the chicken katsu one.  However they're incredibly rude when you get there a few minutes after when they are supposed to be open (excuse me... The sign says you're open...) other than that it's alright.  They have a tendency to have the girls working prep in the back, up at the tables up the steps.  It was a little weird once when we sat at the booth and they continued prepping salads or whatever.  I still like their food, no complaints there.
2014-06-27,3,I think the 3.5 rating is fair.  I'm not from the area, so I don't know if there are other japanese restaurants in the area.  From my dinner experience there on a Thursday night, I thought it was fine, but nothing to write home about.Although the restaurant is not large, it actually has a decent amount of seating both outside and inside.  I noticed that you can BYOB and people really took advantage of it. The good: Well, they have a good selection of choices.  From sushi, noodles, rice, and even some fusion items on the menu.  I had a ramen dish and others in my party had sushi rolls.  Everything looked good and tasted fine.The bad:The service is honestly not great, but I'm not local so maybe this is the norm for NJ? First when I asked the server what is the "paitan broth" in their ramen dish, he could not tell me.  He could not come up with any description.  Not one word. We sat there for at least 2 hours and he never once came to refill my water. Basically there was no "service" to be said.  However, I asked if I could charge my phone somewhere and the waitress nicely charged it for me at the front desk.So overall, it's average.  The ambiance is fine, the food is fine, and if you're in the area and want to bring your own wine to dinner, this seems like a good option.
2014-06-26,1,TINY TINY TINY TINY place. You're basically on a date with the table next to you. And... $13 for a CALIFORNIA ROLL? Are you crazy? I would not recommend this place at all. Plus the bathrooms are gross. Looks nice from outside but no.. Don't do it.
2014-06-19,4,Always enjoy the sushi and soup dishes from here. Huge fan of the udon noodle and broth dishes. They are my comfort dishes when I am sick or freezing in the winter. Sushi always fresh and tastes good as well. staff is friendly. They allow dogs to sit with you outdoors. They even brought my friend's dog a bowl of water.
2014-06-18,5,I've been eating here for two years and tried almost all the food on the menu. I like lunch box the most, the rock shrimp is perfect and only for 13, beef box is also great. I am an Asian and I can never get tired of it. They may not be good at the sushi or any Japanese traditional food, but they are really skilled at making fried food like the Chinese style. Highly recommended!
2014-06-16,2,I expected better from this place, especially in Hoboken. For the price they charge for Bento Box lunches, I expected much bigger portions. Sadly, I was very disappointed in their Shrimp Tempura Bento Box and thought the taste was a little bland. Won't order here again.
2014-06-15,4,Came here with my girlfriend. We both love sushi and this place was great. They have a great 12-4pm lunch special which we ordered. She ordered two rolls for $10 (3 for $13) and they have a great variety to choose from. I ordered the (delicious) Beef Bento Box ($12) which came with miso soup, salad, 4 California rolls, a spring roll and rice. The specialty Roll i ordered was called Crazy Weekend (which had lobster, crab, avocado) and it was delicious. They offer outside dining if you want to enjoy the weather, inside is nice, quiet, and simple set up. The service was great, they helped answered our questions and made good recommendations for our dish. Overall, we enjoyed the food very much, the service was great, and the price was right. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars if they can be consistent because i will go here again!
2014-06-03,5,Very solid sushi/rolls, have never had a bad experience here and have eaten here/ordered at least 10 times.  Very friendly staff and clean in there.  They even clean the menus at the end of the day which is a nice sign.Granted, I am not an expert and have only had lobster/tuna/salmon/california rolls, so take that for what it is.Also, a hidden gem is their fried rice (I get it with shrimp)- very tasty, and lots of meat.
2014-05-28,4,Great sushi. They've got a great lunch special, but they're good at dinner too, especially when the weather is good and you can enjoy the sidewalk seats in the evening air.I especially like their roll combinations, a light option I see on few menus.The presentation is simple, because it can be--they source fantastic, fresh fish, so there's no need for a mountain of shredded cabbage or a flashing LED on the plate. At this neighborhood gem, the food speaks for itself.
2014-05-26,2,Kind of expensive for the "un-fresh" tasting sushi I ordered. I could have gotten better tasting sushi from the grocery store...but I was hoping this place would be better from the reviews I looked at. I wasn't blown away and felt ashamed for spending that kind of money for sushi I wasn't impressed with at all.
2014-05-25,2,kinda expensive, not too tasty and dishes are small.the view is okay, service is good and there are some veggie options.rolls fall apart and they'll get your clothes dirty.bottom line - try another place.
2014-05-13,1,If I could give it zero stars I would. I had ordered from illuzion many times and have always had a pleasant expirience. But yesterday I ordered their tri color sashimi and it was not fresh, it was so old that I only took a bite of the salmon and had to discard the entire thing. When I called to speak to the manager I simply requested that I not pay for something that wasn't fresh, I received a very rude reply and no return on my card. If you promise a "fresh catch" and don't deliver then that just makes you a scam artist. BEWARE EVERYONE, next time you order you may end up hurling your lunch up.
2014-05-10,4,We came here at 7:30 on a rainy Saturday and were seated promptly. They have outdoor seating as well. It was crowded by the time we left. The sashimi delux, soup and hand rolls are all great. Fish tastes fresh and service was decent.
2014-04-29,3,Decent sushi, though a bit on the expensive side. Definitely gets points for BYO. Their special rolls are delicious (I like the Spicy Bad Girl roll a lot!) and their sashimi is usually fresh and delicious. (I say usually because one time I ordered delivery and opened my container of sashimi and was hit by a wall of fishy odor... not appetizing).Not my first choice of eateries in Hoboken, but definitely decent when you're in a sushi mood.
2014-04-26,2,We ordered delivery and the food was good, but not a very big quantity as compared to the price.  More importantly, we ordered per their website in which they charged us $5 more total and the delivery guy looked at my boyfriend because he wanted more tip, $4 wasn't enough apparently, so he gave him another $1.  So after that is when I looked at the receipt and discovered the overcharge.  They told me that no one orders from their website and that I had to come pick up my $5 after I insisted they owe me money, because they of course at first we're not going to return it.  They actually did return the money and I laughed when the delivery man handed over a menu with it.  I gave it back and told him based on the overcharge I would never order again from there.  This company needs to either take down their website or change their pricing on it.  It is a shame that companies act like this.  I received no apology, but instead a huge attitude.  This is precisely how you lose business people!
2014-04-15,5,I eat sushi a lot! This is by far the best sushi that I've had in Hudson co. Plus the ambiance is great. The artwork is nice and created by locals but is essentially for sale (aka overpriced artwork from those who struggle to actually be considered artists).  They stay open relatively late for Hoboken. The worst aspect is finding parking (as is my biggest complaint for any business along Washington).
2014-03-30,5,Ordered at 9:15 pm on a Sunday for a delivery a town out of Hoboken and it came 45 minutes later, delicious and fresh!! We had the maki roll (15 bucks) spicy tuna, shrimp tempura and California roll. We had it with brown rice for no extra price which was awesome. It came with an amazing tasting miso soup. I also got vegetable gyoza and that was also very good.I will continue to order from here. My family said to make sure to remember this spot next time we want sushi because a lot of the local spots we've tried haven't really done it for us.
2014-03-14,5,Really good, always fresh, service is always attentive and pleasant. I live right next door to the sushi house of hoboken but always come here because its much better.
2014-03-12,4,When they're "on," they're one of the best Japanese places in Hoboken (I know, not saying all that much).  They're always nice, and though it's not much of a place, it's comfortable enough.  I'd give them 5 stars for being one of my favorites, but I have been there when they're "off" and the fish isn't so great.
2014-03-01,5,ramen is the best in town! And I like its sashimi, I'll say it's the best and freshest sashimi in town. Service is perfect.
2014-02-19,4,The atmosphere is very intimate, and the place is dimly lit.   The quality of sushi is decent, and the choices are numerous, all well prepared.  I'm not sure I would come back - I am not enamored with the layout of the restaurant, but it's a solid choice if you are looking for Hoboken sushi.
2014-02-07,5,Best sushi in hoboken.  Amazing service, staff is always making sure you have a great experience.  Tuna tartar is my favorite and the specialty rolls and great.
2014-02-04,3,We went on a Saturday during lunch. They have some really great Bento Box specials, the servers there were super friendly, and we were served in a timely manner. The food was pretty good, but it kind of felt like I didn't need to be in there to eat it. It tasted like you did pretty good at finding a legit take-out place...if that makes sense.Overall, can't beat the prices, so maybe it's just one of those places you have to go to a few times to find "your dish." We'll be back.
2014-02-03,4,My boyfriend and I love this place. We travel all the way from Queens to eat here because the sushi is so fresh. If you are there, you must try the grilled sea scallops along with white tuna tataki.
2014-02-01,2,Is it really true about sushi and rat meat? Because I see a couple of rats  running around as I sit eat my tuna roll in illuzion...and suddenly I lost my appetite! :(( Additionally, whatever the meat, it tastes pretty stale. My new parameter to rate good sushi is 'one that is sold at a place with no rats'...sigh!
2014-01-18,3,Came on a rainy day, wasn't busy so got seated quickly. Our server was a bit shy but she was attentive. We got gyozas and shumai for starters. Nothing too special about them. We made it in time for lunch so a few folks in my party got the bento lunch, again average. My roll was the Old Man and the Sea. Now this was the star of the table. Fresh tuna on top of basically a shrimp tempura roll. So good! I'd advise to pick something from the "Chef's Special Rolls" because they're different than normal rolls. The roll cost me $13.50.. Also got a taste of their Ramen, wasn't impressed either. Rolls are the way to go here. Nice corner joint in Hoboken, but definitely have had better.
2014-01-11,1,I was very disappointed with the customer service here. We specially chose this place to eat lunch at because we wanted to go visit Carlos's Bakery for the first time. After waiting one hour in traffic on the bridge to Hoboken, finding parking which is difficult in the area and entering the place, we were seated in a very bad portion of the restaurant. I can tell you the manager runs this place like a factory. She knew it was cold outside and she could have given us seating upstairs where there is more space and the place was literally empty. She made us sit downstairs in a very small and uncomfortable spot and places a small heater besides us. They don't show new customers proper seating. I was warm with my jacket on and I would have been cold if I didn't. When the time for the bill came, I never even asked for it. They just placed it on my table as though they were waiting for me to leave. Although the food was good, I cannot go back to a place where customers are treated this way. I came here with a lot of hopes but there as first time customers, my spouse and I were very dissapointed.
2014-01-08,2,Skip it. Illuzion's japanese BYOB in hoboken is an ok place to drop in if you're craving some sushi (it's perfectly adequate, often crowded, yet nowhere near perfect). The food is ok, the service is lackluster, and the decor is just fine. If you have a craving for BYOB sushi, ok, stop in, but by no means would I recommend going out of your way to try Illuzion. Too overpriced for the generic decor and flat fare, I suggest trying one of Hoboken's (many) other culinary gem's instead.
2014-01-04,5,Great sushi! I strongly recommend the shrimp tempura. If you make it at lunch time, you can get the special. 3 rolls of a choice of MANY types of sushi, miso soup and a salad for $13! WHAT A DEAL! Excellent service too. Their heat was broken so they put a space heater right next to my table. Everyone said hello and goodbye to us, very nice, Oh and they have a Batman painting on the wall. 5 stars all the way!
2013-12-30,4,I go here a lot for sushi and sashimi, there a BYO so that helps with the cost, there is a liquor store one block away. I have eaten most of the menu but we always seem to come back to the large sashimi plate and a few rolls very good value for money and tasty at a good price, the staff are friendly and the place is usually busy. This is a cheap Japanese resto bear this in mind you are not paying Nobu prices so don't expect Nobu service quality of fish etc, I love it and go about once every 2 wks .
2013-12-30,3,In a sea of mediocre Asian restaurants in Hoboken, Illuzion holds it's own. While ordering a three roll lunch combo was a challenge ("sorry, this no available") what did arrive was above average; except for the salad. The sushi rolls were well crafted with fresh ingredients. The miso soup was tasty. The salad was laughable - iceberg lettuce with pink dressing that seemed like a combo of mayonnaise and traditional ginger dressing. Had the salad been better and their prices not been a couple dollars more than the rest, maybe another star.
2013-12-22,4,I have had sushi here more than 5 times and it is always great. Actually, I think it is one of the best sushi places in Hoboken ( I have no idea why people like Sushi Lounge as this place is much better).
2013-12-19,5,The prices are pretty good.The sushi is always fresh. If you like to eat more than your average California Roll, try the fresh sushi from Japan platter.  They say its flown in daily.  Ultra-fresh and melts like butter in your mouth.  The California Uni and miso cod appetizer are also great.Great neighborhood place.  BYOB.  Always a steady stream of customers which of course is great for a sushi place.
2013-12-17,4,It's way past time for an update to my Illuzion review, and they've gained another star! In the past year, I've had countless Seamless orders from them during lunch and the fastest the delivery has gotten to my office about 9 blocks away is 20 minutes from punching GO. That is fast! Of course, I'm always ordering the same thing: Sashimi Lunch Special, so there's no cooking involved LOL. Still, I get more than enough fresh sashimi, plus miso soup and salad. It comes so fast that I don't have to worry about room-temperature fish. Their smoked edamame is also good, with an herbal taste of star anise and/or cloves. A nice switch from standard edamame.When dining at the restaurant, I like their bento box lunch specials. Last week I had their grilled miso black cod. It was cooked to perfection and very moist. Well worth the $13. Their saba bento box is good too.I'm still a bit put off by Illuzion charging $2.50 for green tea, but at least they may have read my old review and got rid of the tacky cut-up cardboard and now use little trivets or coasters for their teapots on the table ;-)
2013-12-07,4,The service was superb, very attentive. Food was fresh and delicious, from appetizers to dessert. Varied menu. Prices were reasonable and love that it's BYOB.
2013-12-03,4,I have been eating sushi at a particular place in Hoboken for about a year on a regular basis, so I decided it was time for a change. After looking at a bunch of places up on Yelp I decided to give Illuzion a try.The first time I tried it, I got it to go. I ordered my usual, being miso soup, sweet potato roll, salmon avocado roll and a side of spicy mayo. Price wise, it comes out to be about the same as the other place I used to frequent which is more than reasonable. What I noticed about this place while picking up my order was the environment. There was music but it was definitely not loud,  you could easily hold a conversation without having to yell. The place is dimly lit and isn't very large. The first thought that came to my mind is that this could be a great date spot. As for the food itself, I have to say that I noticed right away how fresh and flavorful the fish was. I got the same roll from here multiple times afterwards and it has been consistently good. As for the sweet potato roll, I have to say that it was somewhat disappointing. It definitely was not bad but I had better. The miso soup was good but I could not distinguish it from any other miso soup that I previously had. I came to the restaurant twice to eat in. The first time was really good and I was impressed with the service. The second time was for my birthday and I was with a group. Our orders took a very long time to come and for some reason came later than some other tables that ordered after us. Since it was a happy occasion and I was surrounded by friends, I didn't notice it as much, but if it was just an ordinary night I would have been quite annoyed.There is a place for improvement in terms of the sweet potato roll and the service yet this has become my favorite Sushi place in Hoboken.
2013-11-25,2,I have been to this restaurant twice. The first time I had a pleasant experience, nothing special except byob. The food was decent, but the service was non existent.The second time I came in I wanted to punch myself in the face for eating the frozen chewy fish they served me instead of complaining. It wasn't all frozen, some of the rolls we ordered were ok, but I have definitely had better.The bathrooms were disgusting as well.I think I will pass on Illusion next time I am looking for sushi in Hoboken.
2013-11-21,1,Ordered sushi from this place. Moral of the story - don't do that EVER.Ordered three rolls. What would you expect to get? A spicy tuna roll, yellowtail roll and white tuna. We received a slab of fish and a less than acceptable spicy tuna roll aka one piece out of six. It was absolutely ridiculous.Tried to call Illuzion to ask if we could send it back and receive something else and the woman wouldn't reason with us whatsoever. She continued to scream at us telling us we ordered the wrong thing for 5 minutes straight. I've been ordering sushi in Hoboken for a long time and never had an issue like this.True life: suck it Illuzion and the rude woman who you can't even understand but know is being rude anyway.
2013-10-28,3,I have been here twice - both times I got the Chicken Katsu.  They give you a good amount of chicken here.  The chicken is tasty, juicy enough.  My wife really likes their chirashi - they give plenty of sushi at a very fair price.  No skimping here!
2013-10-20,3,The ashimi is really fresh and not fishy at all. I'm talking about the Salmon, Tuna, Yellowtail, and White Tuna. Really impressive, especially for Hoboken, which is not known for good Japanese food (I know what I'm talking about, I grew up in New York and spent some time in Tokyo). The rolls are what made me knock this review down to three stars -- they're absolutely  terrible. Sure, they're edible. A lot of things are. But they're so darn dry and have way too much crunchies. Someone needs to teach this sushi chef how to make rolls, because he's an embarassment to this place. Also, the waiter was a bit shy. Which made me and my wife feel awkward. I shouldn't ask you to speak up more than once.
2013-10-16,5,This place has the best sushi I have ever had, and I eat sushi quite often! The fish is very fresh and melts in your mouth. Although it gets really busy, they are pretty quick about getting your food to you. I would recommend this place to anyone.
2013-10-04,5,It's been more than 7 years that I'm coming to Illuzion for my sushi fix. Even after I moved from Jersey, I still come here. It's simply the BEST: fresh fish, rolls that are not overstuffed with rice, moderately priced (considering it's in Hoboken) and very diverse menu and great service. Oh and its BYOB so you don't have to spend 40$ on a bottle.  Their special rolls are a must!
2013-09-23,5,Best sushi in Hoboken.  If you come here and are ordering sushi make sure you order off the special rolls section.  This place has some of the most unique rolls.  (schwa of chicago is my personal favorite ( blue fin toro, crispy pumpkin seeds, red tobiko, topped with slices of scallop & Jalapeno)).  Every person I have taken here loves the rock shrimp appetizer (if you're getting appetizers get this!!!).  The staff is great and extremely accommodating.  The atmosphere if stylish but still very casual.  Great place to go with friends or even on a date.  BYO doesn't hurt.  I eat here all the time and have yet to have a bad experience.
2013-09-17,4,Had some pretty good sashimi here. It is a long and slim restaurant with some very fresh seafoods in the NYC area.  Pair this meal with being right in the heart of downtown Hoboken, and being so close to NYC and you have a full meal!
2013-09-16,2,2.5 Stars Illuzion is a decent byob sushi joint in Hoboken.  The ambiance is nothing special... The food is usually fresh whenever I go there, but the service sucks.  I usually get a couple pieces of plain sushi or sashimi to start off to taste the quality of the fish that night and then follow up with a few different rolls.  like I said, the service is poor.  Servers speak terrible English and rush you through your order like you're at the McDonald's pick up window... it's fine for a quick bite, but don't go there thinking you're gonna get a romantic meal or any good service.
2013-09-01,3,Food was delicious, very fast. They took our order of 13 and they were accurate. Waiters/waitresses are very nice but sometimes seemed like they didn't understand us maybe because of the language barrier we had to repeat ourselves a few times.
2013-08-26,5,Great sushi. I was actually surprised how fresh everything was. Had some great special rolls. Will definitely go back soon!
2013-08-25,4,Lunch specials ftw. Choice of bento boxes or sushi specials. I had the black miso cod bento box, which was so so good. You can never go wrong with that. They gave plenty of ginger, even though I only had 4 sushi rolls in my box. Sushi, soup, salad, spring roll, rice, cod for $13.50. M had the two roll special for only $9. The waiters/waitresses were very attentive and kept refilling our waters. I drank maybe 5 glasses of water.... I was really thirsty, okay?
2013-08-23,5,Haven't had a bad meal here. Sushi is always fresh and a large cut. The salad dressing is amazing. Creative rolls, also. After less then 5 times there, wait staff knew us and what we usually order.
2013-08-20,2,Not the top of the list in Hoboken but if you are looking for quick sushi -- this might be your spot.  This place does not have a liquor license but they do allow you to bring you own wine.Staff is ok, generally no smile and not to excited to be working there.As for food, sushi was ok.  Tried the vegetable sushi sampler.  It wasn't the freshest or the best but did the job.  Edmame was definitely a big hit but you can't go wrong with that.Overall, would give this place a B-.
2013-08-12,3,I feel like it's gone downhill.  Haven't been loving it lately, and didn't feel the restaurant was particularly clean.  Disappointed
2013-08-04,4,this place is great!!! We went saturday evening and we got the table with little wait outside . The staff is friendly and the food comes out quick. My fav there was the Angry Dragon and the Spice Bad Girl. I love this place and cant wait to go back again!
2013-07-15,5,This is by far my favorite restaurant in Hoboken. I've dined here many times and have never had a bad experience. The sushi are excellent. I've also recently tried the Kimchi Seafood Ramen and it was really good and filling. The waiter asked me, "It's a soup, is that OK?" I was like, "Yeah I know what it is." They also seemed to think that not everyone knows that Oolong tea is not like an over-sweetened American iced tea. I guess they're used to the Hoboken or NJ suburb crowd many of whom don't know how to even use chopsticks and going out to town means going to Hoboken to take a picture in front of Carlo's Bakery (Cake Boss). Anyway, don't be put off by that. They're only trying to make sure you'll like what you order. Definitely check it out if you're in Hoboken. This place is on par with the better sushi restaurants in the city. Also, don't forget to get a bottle of sake one block down Washington St. It is BYOB.
2013-07-07,4,Pleasantly surprised. We came on a Saturday night at 9PM and got a table with minimal wait. The waitresses/waiters were very polite and the food came out pretty quickly. For food, we got 2 special rolls and 2 regular rolls. Both were pretty good- good portions of fish vs. rice. Also, I'll give them bonus points for offering brown rice substitution for no extra charge. I have to say that the special rolls were a tad on the expensive side.. but the fact that it was BYOB made up for that in how much we would have spent. Overall, I'd recommend Illuzion and will be back.
2013-07-01,4,Great and fresh sushi. Very fast service. Have gotten both take out and eat in and no complaints. reasonable priced too!
2013-06-18,3,I love eating here, the food is always pretty decent. I definitely would've given 4 stars if it weren't for the delivery man ALWAYS yelling at me when he's arrived. Am I supposed to be waiting on my front porch for him so he can go right away? He doesn't even ring my door bell to let me know that he's outside.It just makes me not want to order from Illuzion anymore and just eat in whenever I'm in the area. The wait staff is very nice, not sure why the delivery man is rude.
2013-06-15,1,good news- delivery came in less than 30 minutes. bad news...the delivery came...ZING!!!seriously, the food is not good.
2013-06-14,1,STAY AWAY from that place!!! The most awkward place i went to. Staff and service is horrible!!! Suchi were okay and super overratted. I asked for spicy mayo with my sushi (which i suppose to get for FREE) and was charged ¢80 PLUS TAX, just for a tiny contaner of mayo. R U KIDDING ME?!!! These guys have no idea what the cuatomer service is all about. NEVER EVER will i go near that place and would not recommend to any of my friends. Also, the atmosphere  was coldand not cozy at all!!! Visited that place twice and it smelled horrible!
2013-05-22,4,Never been here but I order delivery from here. They do deliver to Jersey City. It is real expensive but its sooo good so ya gotta splurge once and a while, right? Def my favorite sushi place in Hoboken.
2013-04-29,3,Food - The rolls were forgettable, sashimi was forgettable but dessert was a nice surprise.  The prices were very reasonable and I don't remember disliking any food.  I really liked the way they served the tea it was in a proper tea pot and the cups were a nice heavy porcelain just like you are suppose to have green tea.Atmosphere - (Note we came on a Saturday around 8pm)  Mostly filled with people that in their late twenties drinking cocktails before going out on the town.  Not the classiest people but hey, it's Jersey!  I liked how people in there was out to have a good time.Customer Service - The people were very polite and cordial, definitely one of the things I remembered.  Would I come back?Yeah why not?  ** For all my Garden State folks, don't get your spray-tanned knickers in a twist, I'm just poking fun :).
2013-04-22,4,I love this place.  This is my favorite sushi joint in Hoboken.  The service is great, the fish is fresh and the portions are decently sized.  As far as hoboken sushi goes, this one is top notch.  I have tried others in town and none are up to par with Illuzion.  I highly recommend the California Sea Urchin.  Just don't eat it all. Make sure you leave some for me. :)
2013-03-31,1,We have been customers of Illuzion Sushi for many years and generally never have complaints about their food.  Tonight is a different story.  After sending us a tuna roll that tasted so fishy we couldn't eat it, they were extremely rude and acted like we were lying about the problematic rolls.  When we asked if they could replace them with another roll they refused and said they'd return the money and needed the rest of our roll back.  They then told us that they were very busy and that their manager tastes everything - basically insinuating that we were lying again and that they didn't care about their customers.Long story short - horrible customer service - and tonight very old, fishy tasting tuna roll makes this a place we'll skip from here on!!
2013-03-17,4,One of my go-to take-out places in Hoboken.  Generally very fast, and mostly accurate.  Interesting chef's rolls: One Tree Hill & The Clown.  Have also eaten in several times & enjoyed it.  Service is generally prompt & always friendly!
2013-03-14,4,If you live in Hoboken this is the only place you should be going to get sushi.  I have eaten in and ordered take out from Illuzion easily 20 times over the past two years... it helps that I live two blocks away from the restaurant, but I digress.I have had my fair share of sushi in my life and Illuzion rates up there with the best of 'em, even the overpriced NYC hot spots.  The sushi is ALWAYS fresh and delicious and have never had a complaint.  You really can't beat the prices either for the quality of food you get.  It's BYOB, so order and extra roll with the money you save on alcohol.The staff is always polite, courteous & super friendly.  It's tough to get a table on the weekends (especially in the summer), but the food is well worth the wait.
2013-03-10,3,The sushi is good. They have a great seafood soup with tons of fish in it. The waitstaff is a little overbearing. There is no need to constantly ask if we need anything. It starts to feel like they just want to rush you out. Not ok.
2013-03-06,4,This place is great. Amy, who is either the store manager or owner, really listens to her customers. The food portion has gotten smaller the last two years or so but everything is done perfectly. They have reasonable hours and great lunch and dinner specials. Service can be a little better. I am not sure if they were understaffed the time I went, but the waiter was running all over the place trying to service everyone, and I commend him, just wish we had more attention. Other than that, the food is GREAT.
2013-03-05,1,I was here a while ago and haven't been back.One reason: it smelled so, so, so fishy. I have no idea if it was a fluke or an everyday occurrence, but I haven't wanted to return to find out.
2013-02-27,2,Went to Illuzion my first time this past weekend, and have to say I was very disappointed. I should have walked out the door when I saw the mob of people waiting at the front, there is no way this place actually goes by reservations. I made a reservation, guy didn't even ask for my name, kept saying "few more minutes" every now and then, and soon enough it turned out to be a half an hour wait! Would never have waited that long if we knew. Don't even bother making a reservation here as they don't write anything down.When our table FINALLY was ready, no one walked us to the table, no apologies for the wait, the guy at the front simply waved his hand and shooed us to the back to our table, incredibly rude.To top it off, the waitress was surly and it took us asking 3 times and finally asking a separate waitress to get water.The only good thing was that our food came out quickly since we were starving from the wait. Also, I had the summer of Hoboken roll, the spicy tuna and salmon had absolutely no "spice" to them.Overall we paid a lot for mediocre food and poor service. Go somewhere where your money is appreciated!
2013-02-25,5,Excellent sushi and amazing service. I got the spicy tuna and spicy salmon rolls and was so happy. The fried rice and vegetables roll was good too. BYOB so saves money off alcohol. Ended up paying 30/person so not that cheap but totally worth it. Tipped 30% cuz service was so good.
2013-02-14,4,BYOB.  Really enjoyed the calamari age starter.  Had the Old Man and the Sea, Buddha and Zen, Spicy California and the Avocado Cucumber rolls.  Enjoyed all 4 rolls and the fish seemed really fresh.
2013-01-14,4,Affordable GREAT sushi, add in BYOB and it's love! On weekends you'll probably want to try to score a reservation. Next, grab a bottle of wine and come to Illuzion. Start out with some edamame and tuna sashimi, then order the Summer Of Hoboken with spicy salmon tempura and avocado and indulge. Fantastic!
2013-01-11,4,This place surprised me. I've been living a block away from this place for a year and I haven't tried it. They are always busy on the weekends so I thought I would give it a try. They have a really good sashimi selection and source some Japanese fish that the fly in same day for some specials. Also all the staff is Japanese which is a big plus in my book. Tasty, good fish for the money and great service. I wouldn't travel to come her, but I'm glad its just down the block.
2013-01-11,4,Sushi was good, but the seafood udon noodle soup was amazing! I am a big fan of noodle soups in general. The seafood was cooked perfectly and the broth was delicious.
2013-01-04,5,So glad I came here! I can always count on my fellow yelpers to point me to the right place! Great sushi and great portions. Generous balance of rice to fish on the sushi & rolls (hate it when rolls are covered in thick layers of rice), and everything is really fresh. Prices are great too. Extremely reasonable for what you get! This will be THE place I go for sushi next time I drop by Hoboken.
2013-01-04,4,unexpected gem in hoboken. fish is fresh, HUGE serving at a great price. i've ordered for delivery and it's still good.  Definitely my go to place for sushi in hoboken.! I have been back time and time again.... service and food is very consistent. you will not be disappointed.
2012-12-28,4,I first came here for a sushi dinner with a group of friends. And I was so impressed with the food that I returned to try one of their lunch specials the very next day! (I would've gone the following day as well, but I didn't want them to start recognizing me.)For dinner, I chose "The Old Man and The Sea" as my sushi roll, & I shared a side dish of Shrimp & Vegetable Tempura with one of my friends. The sushi was delicious! The shrimp tempura was huge, the rice was perfectly cooked, and the tuna was so flavorful. My only complaint is that I did not expect the ribbon of spicy sauce drizzled on top of my sushi roll. Thankfully, it wasn't too strong and actually added a pleasant bite to the fish. Dinner service was great - our server was very attentive & accommodated all of our requests (brown rice, extra sauce, etc).I caught a glimpse of the lunch menu & decided to try their Bento Box the next day. OMG - the portions are incredible. I ordered Shrimp & Vegetable Tempura to go, and it came with Miso soup, Salad, a few pieces of California Roll, a little egg roll, and white rice. It was so good ... I wish I could've finished it!I went back once more to have a lunch-sized Vegetable Tempura with Chicken Fried Rice ... so good. Again, the portions were so big that I couldn't finish it all. But the food is fantastic.Price-wise, the food is a bit more expensive than I'd like, but you definitely get what you pay for. I can't go there every day for lunch; but when I can, I know I'll be satisfied for the entire day. It's a great place for dinner with friends - or maybe a date? - but the restaurant is a bit small and I'd anticipate a wait on the weekends. But don't worry ... the food is well worth the wait!
2012-12-24,1,i ordered spicy tuna avocado roll and yellowtail avocado roll and had very bad food poisoning, not sure if it was the rice or fish, but sounds like it was fish infected with salmonella. I ordered before from illuzion several times and everything was fine. So be careful when you order those rolls.
2012-12-21,3,There is a lot to like about this place - the great service in particular but the sushi is too inconsistent to give it much more than 3 stars.Having been a few times now I can say there's nothing bad about this place.  But there's nothing compelling either.  I thought about giving it 4-stars but there are just too many other places in town that taste better.If you're close and in the mood for sushi, I say give it a try... if there's a wait elsewhere
2012-12-16,5,I absolutely love this sushi restaurant! Whether you come for a table for two or eight, the servers are sure to make your visit memorable. Their green tea is amazing, even if you forget to BYOB.Be sure to try the rock shrimp appetizer, as well as their specialty rolls. With names like "foxy lady", "spicy bad girl", and "brave heart" you will want to try them all. But take my word for it, you will regret it if you don't save room for dessert! Their tempura ice cream is the best I've had anywhere. I've been going to this place for about ten years now, and they change just enough to keep things exciting while leaving your favorites to draw you back. One of my favorite parts of this restaurant (aside from their food) is the ambiance, which includes a modern interior and pop art pieces that are sure to feed any art enthusiast's palate as you eat.
2012-12-06,4,I went here for the first time on Saturday. This place had a few different things going right for them that night. (Food, Art work/ Decor, Price and Service).  I must say I was very surprised on how good the sushi was here. I've been eating sushi for a long time, and so I usually order a bunch of items to get the ball rolling.. lol. All the fish was fresh and the crunchy items were just right. Truthfully I wasn't really a fan of the strawberry / banana desert, just wasn't my cup of tea. I could  see it being somelse's fav though.. The art pieces of women really caught my eye very unique and fitting to the decor of the restaurant. So the sum up. 4 Stars.
2012-12-02,5,Great Sushi! Great quality and a very clean restaurant. Delivery is very quick as well! One of our favorite stops in Hoboken!!!
2012-11-27,5,I can't believe I haven't written a review of this place yet, especially considering that I get takeout/delivery from here at least once a week, and take advantage of the BYOB and laid back atmosphere for dinner every now and then with my girlfriends. If I stop in to place an order to go, I never wait for more than 10 minutes, and if I get delivery, it usually comes in record time. Even when I dine in, everything is out remarkably fast. The sushi is fresh and delicious. My go-to roll lately has been the Summer of Hoboken roll - seriously, give it a try! Any of the other rolls I've tried have been delish as well. If you're looking for something a little different, try their coconut kabocha, which is mashed Japanese pumpkin with coconut milk. You can't go wrong at Illuzion...check it out!!!
2012-11-15,3,This is your pretty standard Japanese place with standard Japanese fair.  The high point here is that the quality of the food is good and the fish (sushi and salmon dish) is VERY fresh.  If you are looking for a standard Japanese place, this restaurant will do in a pinch.However, there is nothing about this place that makes me go 'wow'.  I honestly think they could do to lower their prices.  Even if they had to cut down on the number of menu items, I'm sure the quality of the food would more than make up for it.  My big knock against it...overpriced.
2012-11-08,3,DeliveryDelivered quickly, less than 30min and I was about half a mile from them.Salad - small, dressing could've used some reducing.Yasai gyoza - not bad. dumplings are hard to deliver but they were average.Chicken fried rice - moderately spiced, moderately bland.Spicy Tuna/Spicy Salmon rolls - good
2012-10-22,3,I have been here a few times for dinner with mostly OK results. I've ordered the sashimi chefs choice option a few times and have found it to be simply average. I also tried the spicy tuna tartare here and was slightly underwhelmed since in my opinion was not very spicy. Overall it's a decent option, but not something I would write home about.
2012-10-14,3,Great spot for lunch and dinner. I order the chicken teriyaki over white rice. The food was okay. I heard the sushi portion was big if you are into sushi.
2012-10-11,4,I'm from Chicago and was just passing through Hoboken for a night.  My friend and I decided to pop in to Illuzion for a late lunch and just caught the tail end of their lunch special.  Coming from the land-locked Chicago, where only a few places are really dependable on their sushi quality, Illuzion was a nice change of freshness.We had the entire restaurant to ourselves at 4pm on a Monday afternoon, so obviously the service was attentive and friendly.  The lunch specials include some pretty great deals - you can mix and match rolls, you can go with the standard bento box type of meal, and they have some better sushi and sashimi combo options than most sushi lunch menus.My friend and I both went with the chirashi bowl lunch special.  For only $14.50, we got a huge bowl of sushi rice topped with tobiko and a great selection of sashimi.  The fish servings were very generous, and this was easily a dish that should normall cost $25.  Each bowl had 3 pieces of tuna, 4 pieces of salmon (super fresh salmon I might add), 3 pieces of yellowtail, 2 pieces of striped bass, 2 pieces of seabass, and a generous helping of the large masago...that I can't remember the exact name of.  The bowl also comes with miso soup and the house salad - nothing mind blowing there, but the soup was solid and the salad was just a small bowl of lettuce and a pink fruity ginger dressing.The quality of the fish was excellent and I definitely recommend this place when you're looking for a quick hole in the wall sushi place that's affordable and delicious.  This isn't a fancy Saturday night kind of lounge atmosphere, and it's welcoming and cozy.  They take pride in their food and do a great job.
2012-10-08,4,I love Illuzion.  Been here a few times already; the most recent, a few weeks ago to celebrate a friend of mine's birthday.  The food is consistently good, the staff very hospitable, and it's BYO F'in B.  I brought a six pack of wine to the party, and ended up ordering the following:- Chilean Seabass cake - good- Soft shell crab appetizer - very good- Tempura dinner - very good (breading wasn't over the top)- Ikura roll - very good- Stir Fry Udon - very good- Spicy scallop roll - good- Yellowtail scallion roll - good- Sashimi deluxe - very good (even came with 5 pieces of chu toro)- Avocado salad - good- Lava cake - very good- Tiramisu - goodEven the clientele are friendly.  My 4-year old son was kickin' it to two girls sitting next to us.  He even gave them a ring pop each, and he LOVES ring pops.  One even said, "No one's ever given me a ring before!".  And another customer came by the table to give us the rest of his six-pack of beer because he heard that it was someone's birthday at our table.As you can see, our overall experience on this occasion (and on the previous ones) will tell you why I'm a fan.
2012-10-07,3,Very mediocre sushi ( spicy bad girl and sunset boulevard). Tastes of rolls blends together with no real taste popping out to you. Decent vegetable spring roll, the sauce for that was the best part. Restaurant looks pretty cool on the inside. Wait service rushed us out as we ate. Not ridiculously rude, but with very underwhelming taste and a slightly obnoxious server I probably won't return. There are much better places to order rolls from in town.
2012-10-05,5,The sushi always fresh with generous portions. They have a great turn around in the place, so they don't skimp on the quality of the fish. Sushi is well prepared. Lots of special roll options is always a nice change. Staff are very friendly. If you haven't gone here you need to try it!!
2012-09-30,4,First off, this was my first time to New Jersey.  Bring your own wine into the restaurant with no corkage fee!?  that is fantastic!!This place is right in the middle of the main drag, kind of a cool area there overall.  Service was great, we got a nice table on the sidewalk, waitress was attentive.. We had a variety of Nigiri  and Maki, it was all pretty decent - the fish tasted fresh and the bill was pretty reasonable (probably had something to do with not ordering a bunch of sake ;)  Would definitely go back!
2012-09-29,5,Excellent sushi, the best I have had in this side of the river. The spicy beef gyoza is exceptional. Sushi is always good quality and the option for brown rice makes it even better.
2012-09-23,5,Our go-to sushi spot!This place is awesome. The space is really nice, the service is great, but most importantly the food is delicious. We love that we can come here any day of the week for a great dinner. Prices are really reasonable too.
2012-09-07,3,A pretty good example of your standard, Chinese-owned sushi joint. They seem to be pretty busy, so the fish is usually fresh since they cycle through their inventory relatively quickly. Just don't expect to be wowed.The three roll lunch special is a great deal at $12.
2012-09-02,5,Love the outdoor seating in the summertime, and BYOB, and service is great. Not a sushi connoisseur, but I think the sushi tastes great.
2012-08-21,5,I've visited other sushi establishments in Hoboken since my last update, and honestly, you won't get a better deal than at Illuzion. They recently just expanded their menu so there is a greater assortment of specialty rolls, and I gotta say, they have stepped up their game with the quality of their sashimi (new distributor perhaps?).My boyfriend and I come here so often the owner and waiters/waitresses always have a smile on when we arrive, a nice change from the last few months.Recommendations: anything with avocado is just too good here!
2012-08-20,5,I have walked by this place a lot.  I am glad I found a parking spot right across the street, hungry from a 5 hour drive from VT.The kimchi and seafood soba soup not only hit the spot for noodles, but it was loaded and filled us up.  The flavor was not spicy.  You were able to taste the fish and the noodles were a good source of subsistence.  So the entrees were good.  Now for the sushi.  Very good.  Yellow tail scallion was nice and light to finish stuffing us up after.  Prices were very reasonable for a modern Japanese cuisine restaurant here in Hoboken.  The staff was moderately useful too.  One of the better spots in Hoboken.
2012-07-31,1,worst Japanese food I've ever had.  Sushi was sub-supermarket quality, the teriyaki/bento box was uneatable because the the beef tasted like dog-meat.  the gyoza was clearly frozen.  Avoid this place at all costs.
2012-07-11,2,Went  here last night only because it was open late. The food was tasteless and really bland. And the sushi was really bad - thick chunks of mediocre fish on very un-sushi rice (mushy and dry)
2012-07-08,2,Menu is boring. Food tasted plain. Was overall a wasted meal. Should have went to sushi lounge
2012-07-02,5,I have eaten at this Hoboken BYOB sushi spot a few times and have always left satisfied. For one, there are tons of creative and interesting rolls available which is always a treat. Furthermore, the fish I have had here has always tasted fresh and the service is a lot better than other sushi places in Hoboken.
2012-06-22,2,I was disillusioned by Illuzion... sorry.While reading through the menu and the impressive array of choices on offer, I thought to myself, "I'm in for a real treat". And seeing the dishes flying in and out of the kitchen or off the counter, I thought I would be impressed...However when our dishes actually arrived at our table...what a dissapointment. Fish did not taste so fresh and rice was dry (kept crumbling). Taste was very mediocre. Moreover, there was a really funny/nasty smell in the restaurant which was a major turn-off for our dining experience. Waiters are friendly, but also rush everything and appear somewhat stressed out. Would not go back to Illuzion for sushi. Pity.
2012-05-28,2,Not bad. Not the best in Hoboken, but the rolls are more flavorful than some other Hoboken sushi restaurants that are more highly rated on Yelp. I can't praise the freshness of their fish. Even the cooked items (eel and shrimp tempura) tasted like they were cooked well in advance and then thrown into the rolls when the time came. I ordered my rolls in person for pick-up around 7PM, so it wasn't exactly an "off" time.
2012-05-26,3,Eh. As many will point out, this is just another mediocre sushi place in hoboken.  nothing mind-blowing. Nothing that's not completely inedible.  We definitely don't make regular stops here.
2012-05-14,2,And the Quest for Decent Sushi in Hoboken Continues...Had early dinner here last night..was excited by the daily special..we ordered some Blue Fin Toro and California UNI to start with. Tasted quite fresh and worth the money. About 10 bucks for the Toro and 6 for the Uni. The rest of the meal is where it all went downhill..We ordered the El Bulli Roll and the Fallen Angel..both very dry and you could tell was def not fresh. Some points of my Fallen Angel roll just came off the rice, that's how dry the rice was I guess. The Miso Soup was OK. Entire time after the meal my stomach was making weird noises and felt odd.. Not Cool...I guess I should stick to taking the Path ride into the city every  time I have a sushi craving.P.S - I eat sushi very often in NY, so I am not one of those diners who has a weak stomach...
2012-05-09,1,The sushi here is NOT fresh by far one of the nastiest if not the nastiest tuna I've ever tasted. The rolls look like a second grader rolled them and fell apart right away. Overall I am very sorry I ordered from this place NEVER again let me not forget how overpriced it is. Hoboken deserves better.
2012-05-07,4,Great food and pretty affordable.  BYOB.  Decor is funky, Coney Island type art.  Service is sometimes attentive, sometimes rushed, but both the cushi and the cooked appetizers are top notch!
2012-05-01,4,I've been there a few times now, since I discovered it! The sushi seems to be fresh, the Miso soup is very good and I was not disappointed at all by Salmon or Scallop Terriaki. The Salmon Terriaki was served with spinach and the portion was huge.  My husband can't get enough of the angry dragon & dancing lion rolls, and now usually requests this place, when sushi comes up as an option for dinner.
2012-04-22,4,Good food.  Not the best I've ever had, but definitely good.  My only real complaint is the fact that I find the staff somewhat rude.  I understand the need to keep an eye on your tables as a waiter, but when the entire staff is staring at your table as you eat it gets somewhat irritating and unnerving.  Still, both the quality and quantity of the food were very nice and I will definitely consider returning.
2012-04-21,3,As many other yelp readers said, the sushi is pretty reasonably priced and I found the portions to be very generous.  I tried for the first time a salmon skin salad and the Spicy Bad Girl Roll, Philly Roll, and and Avocado Roll.  Everything was pretty good but not amazing.  I think Robongi is probably the freshest sushi in town.  Delivery was fast and the price, again, is a major plus! One downside and I have no idea if it was related, that night I didn't feel so great.  I didn't end up getting food poisoning but something didn't sit right down there.  I don't know if I will be choosing this place over Robongi but it is not a bad choice if you want to give it a go!
2012-03-26,5,Delicious fresh Sushi, generous cuts, good price.
2012-03-04,5,Best sushi in Hoboken.  Their special rolls are incredible....very creative and substantial.  You could just go down the list, I've had just about every one of them and have never been disappointed.  I'm getting hungry just writing about them.  Good variety no matter what you're in the mood for.  Their sushi is always fresh, never fishy or gamey.  Their appetizers are good too.  The atmosphere is a bit modern for my taste, but you can't beat their sushi.  And when I'm ordering sushi for delivery this is my top choice every time.
2012-02-28,4,Best sushi delivery in Hoboken to my knowlege.  Consistant high quality fish
2012-02-25,4,This is probably my favorite sushi place in Hoboken.  It's unfortunate that Hoboken doesn't really have any great sushi places though but this will do for now.  Illuzion has the most constantly fresh fish and the portion sizes are very good.  Of course the restaurant is BYOB which is always nice and Sparrow's downtown is only a block away.I go here for lunch on the weekend at least once a month.  They have a pretty standard set of lunch specials including plates from the kitchen and the sushi bar.  I tend to get the 3 maki roll lunch which is $12.  The lunch specials all come with miso soup and salad that comes with their yummy version of the standard ginger dressing but Illuzion's adds beets to their dressing for something a little different.  The list of rolls for the lunch special is limited to about 20 rolls but that comes to be expected since you are getting such a good deal. I've been here for dinner with large groups several times as well.  The food is just as good in the evening.  I've had a handful of sushi entrees including the charashi (a mix of sashimi on a bed of rice), an assortment of special rolls, sushi and sashimi.  All of these have been consistently good.  I've also had a lot of their appetizers, one that stood out to me is the octopus appetizer and I would highly recommend it to all who go to Illuzion.  Kitchen entrees are pretty good as well but I have to be honest that sushi has a place in my heart so I usually stick to the fish. Service at Illuzion has always been pretty good.  It's nothing special but your water glass is always full and they your empty plates won't be in front of you on your table for long when you are done eating.
2012-02-24,4,I'm a frequent take out /delivery customer for years. The fish more often than not are fresh and consistent - people need to realize that the freshest days of the week is Wed, Thurs, and Fr. Sundays and Mondays are usually not the freshest in MOST sushi bars in general since the fish markets are closed so chefs use one-day old fish meat. Don't complain if you get salmon slightly off on Monday nights, that's just how it is.The sushi is not out of this world, but I find that it's the fresh yet in Hoboken. The service and delivery guys are super friendly and accommodating. Sometimes they throw in free mochis (we're good customers). However, the house salads and miso soups lately had declined severely in quality. A wad of ice berg lettuce, one grape tomato, that's it. The miso soup is very "watered-down" so it taste a bit bland.Overall I'd keep coming back for the variety they have, in general, totally acceptable when you're in the mood.
2012-02-14,3,decent sushi, nothing that will knock your socks off though. I usually go during the week and it's always busy....service is okay, but i feel like they're always rushing you out. plus they never bring the food out at the same time. my friend and i always go and order different appetizers, and they are never brought out together which bothers me. overall i like it though and a good option.
2012-02-09,3,PROS:Fresh sushi and extremely tasty low sodium soy sauce. Not sure if/what they add to it, but I cannot get enough!  A bit pricier than an average place, but worth the difference in quality.  I've dined in and ordered out, and both experiences have been great (food wise). This is my go to spot for sushi in NJ.CONS:Their ordering and delivery staff can sometimes be a little impatient/rude or ask for more tip. The other negative I can mention is the lack of your typical rolls - Philly, Boston, etc. They'll make it for you but they'll charge extra. Not sure why cucumber is $1 extra. Lastly, the prices seem to be going up every few months.With that said, I come for the fresh fish and typically get:- Miso Black Cod- Sushi Appetizer (removed?)- Sushi Regular or Deluxe- Chirashi- Alligator Roll- Spicy Girl Roll
2012-02-07,3,Lunch review. 2 or 3 roll special comes with a miso soup and salad. Lately the salad has been a complete joke: iceberg lettuce, square beets, and dressing. Soup's soup. The rolls are hit and miss - the spicy ones tend to be on the mushy side. The hand rolls tend to be a favorite among the lunch crowd.If you go for other lunch specials, the udon soup is humongous and much improved with some hot sauce. The bento boxes also have the sad salad and a poorly made California roll.
2012-02-02,5,Although I constantly find myself wasting hours on Yelp, [prior to this instance] only once had I taken the time to actually write out a review.Way too often it seems like Yelpers forget the purpose of writing reviews.... As an individual who owns their own business, I see Yelp as an informative tool for the consumer AND an 'opportunity' for the business-entity.  Critique properly as a Yelp review can make-or-break a business.  Someone recently wrote that they enjoyed their food, but they were upset because they were charged $2 extra for a substitution, and then had the nerve to rate this restaurant ONE STAR.  I'm sorry, but you're an idiot.  You even said yourself that you would have rated this place three-or-four stars, but rather than being rational, you decided to be a moron and give this place ONE star based on the contingency that you're cheap.[/end rant]My thoughts on Illuzion... There are only a handful of places in Hoboken that consistently provide both great food and great service: Illuzion is one of those places.  I've tried every sushi place in Hoboken, as well as countless amounts of places around Manhattan.  In Hoboken, it is easily the best.  The fish always tastes of the freshest quality.  The rolls are beautiful pieces of art; they are unique, they are large, and they are delicious.  If they don't have a specific roll you are looking for, they will cater to your needs and try to create it as best as possible - if it's not what you were hoping for... THEY TAKE IT BACK with no complaints.  The interior is as tastefully done as it gets in Hoboken:  It is young, modern, and they're often displaying new art.  There is no techno music blaring like some of the other places in Hoboken.   You don't have to beg for air conditioning in the summer or heat in the winter like those other places as well.  They hang your coat as you walk in.  The staff there is incredible.  They are personable.  They help you with the menus and constantly give you recommendations.  They make sure you're comfortable and happy throughout the meal.  They make sure your glass is full with water, and your other beverages [sake] are served correctly as well.  When you're finished, they don't rush you to pay the check or leave - even if you're there after close.  Most importantly it is ALWAYS the same staff.  This place has ZERO turn-over!  You know them, they know you.Pricing is more than reasonable.  THIS IS SUSHI PEOPLE.  It is not meant to be cheap.  Not quite sure if people are familiar with the process of purchasing seafood on the wholesale level:  EVERYTHING IS MARKET PRICE.  This means that there is no set price for that piece of tuna you're eating.  One day they may pay $7.99/lb and the next day they could be paying $9.99/lb.  Add in the fact that there is a bidding war for the fish as it comes to the market.  Places like MASA [which is a set minimum of $400 per person, and you don't even get to choose what you will be eating] have the best quality sushi in the United States based off the fact that they have more capital to bid with, and will ALWAYS get first pick of fish. If a sushi restaurant is cheap, they are likely working with 'yesterdays' delivery or buying from a discounted fish wholesaler.  Special rolls at Illuzion typically range from $10-$14, but they're large rolls - and absolutely delicious.  I will argue with anyone that this is the best sushi restaurant in Hoboken - and to be quite honest I happen to think it's better than Manhattan's Nobu or SushiSamba [which both are far pricier].If you are looking to eat great sushi in a great atmosphere, there is no better place than Illuzion in Hoboken.  I highly recommend it, and think most will enjoy it.  My go-to rolls are the Nowhere Boy, Fallen Angel, and Blue Heaven.  Their unagi is delicious, as is their calamari appetizer.  Can't go wrong with anything here.-Jonathan
2012-01-24,4,Best sushi place in Hoboken, and I love the decor. Great date spot just don't sit by the door in the winter as its freezing! Staff are generally attentive, occasionally it gets busy and they fall behind. Also, delivery comes super fast!
2012-01-23,5,This is my favorite sushi place in Hoboken.  Great location, great ambience, and great sushi.  BYOB also so you can't go wrong.  If you like salmon try the Autumn of New York roll, that's my favorite!
2012-01-22,1,Ok - I'll be honest, I would have put 3 or 4 stars, but I am putting 1 star only because they charged by $2 extra because I wanted to swap the yellowtail makis for california makis in my maki combo menu... which was just scandalous!The food is ok, but I won't go there because this place is just a scam for asking $2 for a maki swap. Come on!
2012-01-14,5,I absolutely LOVE this place. The sushi is delicious, and the service is great every single time I come here. I go here for lunch and dinner with my girlfriend all the time and they never disappoint.It has a nice ambiance with a very modern setting. There is also outdoor seating for the nice weather and big screen TVs inside to watch games.Definitely a great place to dine casually, but not a classy place you would want to go for a first date.
2012-01-09,5,This is the only place in Hoboken I'll order sushi from. The pieces you get are always huge, and always super fresh. The menu is updated pretty regularly, and a lot of the special rolls are good. I also really recommend the grilled squid appetizer. Since it is BYOB, two people should never really run more than $60, unless you are ordering a bunch of Toro. Great lunch specials there too.
2012-01-02,1,My experience at Illuzion was, unfortunately, disastrous. A group of 5 of us came here on Dec 30th because our usual sushi spot (Sushi Lounge) had a very long wait. The service was perfectly fine and the menu selection was good as well, but the quality of food killed it for me. Bottom line: Food PoisoningI had a piece or two of the salmon avocado roll and noticed the fish was a little warm, maybe a bit "mushier" than I would've expected. I woke up New Year's Eve completely incapacitated, which went well into New Year's Day (obviously nixing any NYE plans).I was the unlucky one in a party of 5, possibly out of anyone that ate there that whole night, but 1 bout of food poisoning is still one too many.
2011-12-27,3,I went there yesterday with a friend, to catch up. It's a small, but cozy restaurant, definitely the place to have an intimate get-together. The staff was very friendly, from the hostess to the very attentive waiter. My only major complaint was how quickly they rushed us out after finishing our meal, even though the place was fairly empty. That a quite a turn off, but not a huge deal. My recommendations: The Fallen Angel and Brave Heart special rolls. Their tuna, salmon, and eel rolls are also quite tasty.
2011-12-27,3,Good place to eat. It used to be much better a couple of years ago. The past couple of times I got semi-frozen pieces of tuna sashimi on my plate along with the rice that was falling apart.My main complaint is that there have been at least three occasions when we spent a lot of money for dinner, finished our meals and wanted to stay for 5-10 min after to finish our wine. The waiter came up to us and asked us to leave as other people were waiting for our table. This place has a great potential - modern decorations, clean restaurant with a great location. With a few small changes, it can be a five star place to eat.
2011-12-25,4,Kick butt sushi rolls that have a unique flair. I won't put this joint on the caliber of NYC sushi but they aren't too shabby either. They have the staples like Unagi rolls but also try the Yellow Submarine for something different yet just as delicious.
2011-12-05,5,The freshest sushi I've ever had. Clean but small restaurant, friendly staff, BYOB and free corking service. Nice outside seating in the summer, cozy seating inside.
2011-11-25,4,My favorite sushi spot in Hoboken. My the great speciality rolls! My boyfriend and I order from here about once a week, we just love this place!
2011-11-15,3,Hoboken Foodie hit Illuzion for a quick lunch and was pleasantly surprised. This review is going to be short because my stay was short.The place had a nice urban feel to it. Nothing overly memorable but decent. It had a nice smell to it. To me there is a certain smell that a good sushi restaurant has and it should hit you when you are inside. It's hard to describe but trust me this joint has it! As I was in quite the rush I sat at the sushi bar and ordered the 3 roll lunch special. What I find a lot of times at various restaurants is that they skimp out when it comes to the "lunch special". Well not the case at Illuzion.I had a spicy scallop roll along with a white tuna roll and a salmon avocado roll. Now this came with a salad and soup all for $12.50!Such a deal!The miso soup was so/so and the salad was nothing more than iceberg lettuce with an OK raspberry vinaigrette.So full size rolls, not the "slender" version that some places toss your way with the lunch special. The fish was so fresh I would have bet it had a hook in it's mouth that morning. The spicy scallop was by far my favorite. It had just the right amount of "kick" with a little tobiko (flying fish egg) mixed in. The salmon avocado roll came in second with the white tuna in third.So I'm giving Illuzion 3 stars with the hope I will go back for an extended stay and experience more of what this gem of a sushi joint has to offer.And that's all I've got to say about that!
2011-10-07,5,Illuzion is by far the best sushi restaurant in Hoboken.  The basic rolls are great.  I have had the basic spicy tuna roll and california roll.  They do not skimp on the amount of tuna and the crab/avocado in the california roll was so fresh and good.I have also had a few special rolls that were very tasty.  The sweetheart roll is good if you really like tuna, and  the moonwalk roll is a must (shrimp tempura and spicy tuna)!Great place to go with a few girlfriends or a date.  BYO is a plus!
2011-10-03,5,Best sushi restaurant in Hoboken. The sushi is fantastic quality and they have an excellent menu with a lot unique specialty rolls (my favorite is the Fallen Angel). I always get the sushi when I go but my friends who don't like sushi say that the regular dishes are very good as well. This place also has a great atmosphere and a very cool design for people that care about that sort of thing.
2011-10-02,3,Came here with a group of friends and thoroughly enjoyed the place. The sushi was phenomenal and the restaurant had a BYOB policy which was nice. The staff was good; however, I found myself a bit taken back by the pricing. Either way, this is a great laid back restaurant to go to.
2011-09-27,4,I've got to tell you, the sushi here is awesome.  The ambiance needs some fine tuning...I wish I owned the joint cause it would be hopping!Great sushi + byob = great evening.
2011-07-28,2,Ate outside on a nice spring weeknight.  My boyfriend and I wanted to try a different place besides our usual Asian favorite.  I was totally unimpressed.  The inside smelled very fishy and the dinners were fine but not worth the price.  We tried lemongrass scallops and a chicken and vegetables dish, neither were great.  Probably will not be returning.
2011-07-12,3,Good sushi, reasonable prices.  Pretty much what you'd expect; very similar to almost every other sushi place I've been.  So, if you're looking for sushi on Washington Street, you can't go wrong with Illuzion.  But, if you want to go to another sushi join along the street, that's fine too.
2011-07-12,3,reservations don't help if you don't write them down. there were tables available, but they made us wait. the hostess showed me the listing of names where she had placed all reservations, but mine wasn't on it. when were finally seated, we were given a wobbly table that faced into the kitchen. i asked for a different one, but was told that it wasn't available. two seconds later, the table i requested was given to a couple that had walked in after us. other than that, the rest of the evening was fine. don't know if i'll be returning though.
2011-06-11,4,YUMMY!! I stopped here for lunch with the roomie. I had the sashimi lunch, it came with 10 nicely portioned pieces of fish, soup and a salad. My roomie had a tuna avocado roll and a shrimp tempura shrimp roll. The service was very nice--attentive but not invasive. Our total bill was $23 pre-tip. Great for a lunch! We'll definitely be back.
2011-05-14,4,Really delicious sushi and entrees. The older lady that works the take out orders (she might have been the owner) is such a sweetheart. I remember once I tried to give her a tip and she wouldn't accept it (not in a mean way) because she said I had already spent a lot of $ already on takeout. She was very friendly and urged me to come again soon. Aside from take out, I have eaten inside the restaurant about 3 times and it's always very good. Definitely recommend Illuzion.
2011-05-03,4,Lesson learned: never put me in charge of going to the liquor store before going to a BYOB sushi restaurant.  Since I couldn't decide what we should have with our meal, I opted to bring 2 bottles of wine and 2 bottles of sake.  Needless to say I greatly enjoyed my time at Illuzion.The service here was very good.  They immediately prepared our bottles for us.  Afterwards our server was around when we needed him but never hovering around.We ordered sushi, LOTS of sushi, and it was really good.  Not too much rice and the fish was fresh.  You definitely should sample the house specialty rolls.My highlight was the fried ice cream dessert.  I had green tea flavor and it was fantastic.I also got to watch the Yankees win, nice bonus :)
2011-04-25,4,Good stuff! Came here last week with 4 of my girl friends on a Thursday evening. It is good in taste, quick in service AND BYO. So naturally, I was pretty thrilled about that. The service is friendly, and the food is not pricey. We were able to share some different things at the same time. The sushi was definitely creative and overall it was fun. We were debating over Maru and Robongi, both of which I had been to, so this was a pleasant change. I will definitely be back.
2011-04-05,3,I came here a couple years ago for a friend's birthday and remembered having some huge/creative rolls. This past weekend, I was wandering the streets of Hoboken looking for a place to dine w/the parents and as we were waiting for Bangkok City (next door) to open, it dawned on me that we were standing right in front of Illuzion. Naturally, we walked in for dinner since they were open.Sushi was still good and creative, though I stuck with the basics - spicy scallop, spicy california, white tuna cucumber - the special rolls were a little too overwhelming this time around. All were great, though I think the white tuna would be great with some scallion sprinkled in.My parents and sister shared some non-sushi dishes that were also tasty. The table favorite: Miso Glazed Black Cod. Slightly sweet and smokey, served over sticky black rice.Lemongrass Shrimp and Scallops was lacking a bit in the flavor department - expected a little more oomph with the description. Chicken Fried Rice had great presentation and wasn't overly greasy, but not a must try.
2011-04-05,4,I live on the block and we eat here on average 1-2 a week - whether take out or the pleasure of eating in.  They treat you so well...and i'm a self proclaimed sushi snob.  The food is fantastic!  The roll selection is amazing and they have very good specials going on continuously, as well.  The Spicy Bad Girl, Salmon Tartare, Autumn of New York, (current special) Weekend roll...All good!  And they don't charge extra for brown rice or tweaking your rolls which is a very pleasant surprise.  And unlike many of hoboken's BYOB places, they are VERY fast at getting your drink situation set up.  I highly recommend Illuzion!!  Additionally, their standard green salad is the biggest i've ever seen at a sushi place.  As I keep going on and on - yes - the Miso Black Cod is fabulous as are both the scallop and shrimp appetizers, as well.  Enjoy!
2011-03-31,4,I am continually impressed with the sushi establishments in Hoboken and Illuzion was probably the best I have tried in Hoboken so far.  The sashimi (salmon, tuna, fatty tuna) was good and fresh but I wasn't a huge fan of the yellowtail.  The spicy scallop roll and  Fall Angel roll great but I was disappointed that they didn't have a Rainbow roll on the menu.  There were no tables when we went so we chose to sit at the empty bar.  This worked out great except at the end of the night when they began to clean up.  We did not want to see them move all the fish around so we moved to an empty table.I was impresesd by our server, she was friendly and attentive.  The interrrior is long and narrow so it may be a little difficult to accomodate a large group at a single table.  Illuzion also gets bonus points for being a BYO (there is a liquor store just south on Washington St. that sells Saki, Sopporo, and Ashi).I find it hard to believe it is only rated an average of 3.5 stars.
2011-03-21,4,Hit up this spot after a day of therapeutic boutique shopping in 'boken, and I must say it was a great choice!The place was small, cozy and intimate (redundant?) but it really was all of those things, kind of had a coffee shop feel to it.  There was BYOB and the service was attentive and prompt.  Dishes of note:  The lemongrass scallop & shrimp dish was spectacular.  It was slightly tart, and slightly sweet, and a really good choice over a some well-prepared (albeit a bit tiny) plate of fish.Also of note: after several futile attempts to get few good hits in on my dessert, my date was defeated... (I rendered him weaponless with some well choreographed fork action).  The prize?  "Pounded sticky rice" with strawberry ice cream inside (mochi).  Believe me, you'd fight for it too.
2011-03-17,4,It seems the Sukiyaki was a fluke, because the tofu teriyaki my dining partner had on a return visit was exceptional. The Bentos are a fantastic deal. Service is a bit brusque at lunchtime, and the sushi pieces can be uneven, but overall a very enjoyable meal.
2011-03-16,5,I LOVE Illuzion! I have eaten at many of the Japanese restaurants in Hoboken and find that Illuzion has some really tasty and innovative rolls! I tried one with soft shell crab, lobster salad and spicy tuna on top... Absolutely melt in your mouth and delicious flavor! For the price of their sushi, you get a HUGE roll and it is so fresh!Also, it's BYOB and I love that about this place. The atmosphere is fun and relaxed. I HIGHLY recommend Illuzion if you want a great sushi place!! Great service too!
2011-02-05,5,Great, decently priced food! I probably go to Illuzion a few times a month and I bring my out of town friends here. I lovee their noodles, the lobster sushi is great and the dumplings are my FAVORITE in Hoboken. BYOB definitely helps with the bill. Love it!
2011-01-31,4,This is my favorite sushi in Hoboken. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is bc I have had better sushi in NYC and in Vegas. What I really like about Iluzion is: A) Not too much rice on the rolls, even the inside out versions. I think the other sushi places in town go overboard on the rice. I like that Illuzion uses more fish and filling than rice. B) The special rolls are amazing and still fit in your mouth. Nothing annoys me more than splurging $10-$15 for a special roll and not being able to taste it bc you can't fit it into your mouth and when you do you can't breathe and are trying to just get it down. The special rolls here are amazing, creative and although a bit larger than a regular roll, not too large to enjoy! C) Delivery is ROCKET fast! D) They understand little changes to your order and get them right. I don't like avacado so some rolls I order I order without avacado or add cucumber, and they always nail it. D) BYOB! Its my favorite in the summertime bc my friends and I can sit outside along 4th street and just chill and drink wine or beers and they are so accomodating. They don't rush you at all and we have sat there for 2 hours sometimes, ordering as we go, and they are great! They never get annoyed if we order 10 times over 2 hours and are just wonderful. E) The appetizers are awesome! I love the smoked edemame and have never seen this anywhere else! The rock shrimp and soft shell crab appis are also amazing!
2011-01-20,5,My favorite sushi place in Hoboken! Their specialty rolls are the best! The Sunset Boulevard roll is the best! The fish is always fresh and the service is great. We've tried all of the other Japanese places in Hoboken yet we always come back to Illuzion!
2011-01-17,4,A decent place for sushi in Hoboken especially for the lunch crowd. However, with a large selection of the big fancy rolls, the prices tend to get up there for a lunch option. The rolls were good, though a bit small. It's also Chinese owned/run, so was a notch from authentic. But all in all, a comfortable place. I could imagine coming back at night for sake lounging.
2010-12-31,4,I'm really not sure how this can get less than 4 stars!?  They have great service and its BYOB - Hollahhhh :D   Delicious Food   ::You must, must, MUST order the Miso Black Cod::   It melts in your mouth and the flavors - ahh, so good!  Trust me, its scrumptious.  And my favorite roll is the Spicy Bad Girl ;)  not b/c of the cute name, but b/c it really is delicious.
2010-12-14,4,My sister treated me to dinner here and found it to be a satisfying experience. The waitress was pleasant attentive. The menu is nice and diverse. The food itself was well-priced. Kinda sucks that they don't put cucumbers in their california rolls; I suppose next time I'll ask for it. I do wish they'd come up with a more comfortable and cozy seating arrangement - I could tell you word for word what the folks at the table to my right were saying and that would be too close for comfort.
2010-11-22,2,Never mind.  I don't know what happened but I'm bummed that it did.  The other night my order of california rolls fell apart and were only crab and avocado...no crunchy cucumber.  Lame.
2010-09-30,4,It's a BYOB! How can you not love it?The app - please get the miso black cod! It's a delicious piece of cod over a bed of sticky sweet black rice. It's SO good, we get it almost every time we order from here. If you come here, order off the special roll. It's pricey but you can get a California roll ANYWHERE. Their specialty rolls are amazing. Tried the spicy bad girl, fallen angel, brave heart, and a couple others - would recommend all of them. I love that they also have soy paper and rice paper for those who aren't too fond of seaweed paper.
2010-07-29,4,Good sushi, a bit pricey given that its nothing special. The outdoor seating on Washington St. is certainly nice though.
2010-07-19,1,PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT EAT HERE.  REALLY.  I signed up on Yelp to b!tch about this place.  it's horrible!!! the food is defintiely nothing great.  the service is HOOOOOOOOOOOORIBLE.  i ordered food for delivery and was quoted 20 mins and took over one hour and the food was cold!!!
2010-06-25,5,the best sushi in Hoboken, by far!BYOB, tons of delicious rolls, and friendly service make this my favorite weekend restaurant spot!
2010-06-15,2,Holy crap, I have a backlog of reviews to write.this one will be easy.really mediocre sushi that I somewhat enjoyed the first time I tasted it, but wasn't impressed when it repeated through the night and into the morning.'spicy' rolls were almost blander than the ones without the word attached to the nameand no beer.Plus, the constant reminders about how the outside patio closes at 11, and that they have to clean so you need to leave by 10:55 should have been matched with more attentive service to turn the table.
2010-03-15,4,Great fresh sushi. Try the spicy dirty girl.
2010-03-07,4,BYOB is always a wonderful thing. Unless you're coming from the chaos of the irish parade, completely sober, looking for a place to down a little sake (get to the point) and you then discover it's BYOB. And then you cry into your coca cola....But the food was so good it almost made up for our sober pains.  The chicken and vegetable tempura tempura were fresh, crispy, and delish.  The spicy tuna roll was pretty good...everything is really fresh and relatively cheap.  I could have tried some funkier dishes here if I were feeling more daring/enthusiastic and I'm sure they'd be awesome.
2010-03-04,4,i went here last night because my friend wanted to go "someplace we've never been." it's BYO, which is always great. we ordered vegetable tempura for an app (anything fried is amazing) and i had beef teriyaki as my main meal. delicious taste and i thoroughly enjoyed, but beware of the wasabi mashed potatos hiding underneath! (i don't like wasabi)oh, i also love how their carrots are shaped like stars :)
2010-03-03,3,Illuzions is a decent sushi restaurant but it's not on the top of my list of "fave" sushi spots to go to. As soon as I walked in the restaurant, I found the place to be too warm. I understand its a bit chilly outside but I was worried that the excessive heat would affect the sushi. The decor was ok and the service was good. I ordered "The Good Earth" and "Autumn of New York" special sushi rolls. The sushi was ok. I wasn't really impressed. I really loved the rock shrimp appetizer and the fried ice cream. I took advantage of their "Happy Hour" special. My overall experience with Illuzions was just "ok".
2010-02-14,2,Not bad. Not out of this world either. The spicy roll medley was quite tasteless. Not my favorite sushi joint.Service is good.I wasn't struck by the freshness of the fish or anything really.
2010-01-27,5,This is my favorite sushi place in Hoboken. Everything is fresh and they have a lot of inventive specialty rolls. I tend to not have sushi delivered because I find you are given a lesser quality, but this is not true of Illuzion, who also has a lightening speed delivery service.
2010-01-21,3,I don't really have much to say about Iluzion. There's nothing terribly remarkable about it, though folks new to sushi restaurants will keenly enjoy it. Here are a few notes, though:1. Iluzion is NOT a Japanese restaurant; they are a sushi restaurant. They serve the absolute basics (tempura, teriyaki, etc.), but you will be a sad panda if you're looking for anything else.2. Iluzion is run by Chinese, NOT Japanese, people. I don't have a problem with this, but I can see how some might. 3. The prices are pretty average for a sushi place, but are negligibly more expensive than its surrounding competitors (Robongi, Rice Shop, Wild Ginger, etc.)4. They offer delivery, but take a while.
2010-01-20,4,Great place all around. If you eat here, request upstairs seating, it's not as cramped. Sushi is definitely one of the best in Hoboken. I order in a TON from Illuzion's and it is hands down the best delivery of sushi in town. I have them on speed dial and they have all my info saved for quick ordering.
2010-01-18,3,Cute Sushi restaurant in Hoboken.  Can't say I am impressed or unimpressed by this place.  It was just a normal sushi restaurant to me.I ordered their Bento Box Lunch special - which comes with Miso Soup, Salad, California Roll, Veggie Spring Roll, and a choice of different main entrees, I choose the Miso Cod.I thought the food was pretty good, but a little bit salty for my taste.  The Miso Cod had a sauce on top of it that I thought really smothered the delicate taste of the cod.  It should be just glazed enough to give the cod some flavor, but not so much that the delicate cod was drowning in it.  What should have been a very light and delicate dish, seemed much heavier than what I expected.We also ordered the Special Uni roll that they had - which was Toro on top of a roll that had avocado and uni.  It was pretty good with some soy sauce and lemon, but by itself, there was a strong fishy flavor that I wasn't too crazy about.  Also the toro, which should be fatty and buttery, really didn't have much taste and seemed like maybe it was defrosted recently.I looked around at the other tables and I thought presentation wise, I'd seen a lot better.  But of course, I didn't try their sushi, so it could have been off the hook taste wise.I'd definitey come back again.  It's one of my friends favorite sushi restaurants in Hoboken.  Good for if you are just having a casual lunch with your friend.To me, this is equivalent of going to get a sandwich for lunch but in Sushi form if that makes any sense to anyone else but me.
2010-01-10,1,the sushi at this place is absolutely awful... think supermarket sushi and then subtract 1 star from it and you get the rating for the sushi here.  i think they must have missed a key ingredient in the sushi for the batch we had.  it might have been vinegar in the rice...
2010-01-08,4,This has become our new go-to Japanese restaurant in Hoboken.  The sushi always tastes fresh and is priced reasonably.  They also have great noodle soups which are perfect for this freezing winter weather.  The service here is also pretty good.   Of course I could be biased since we go there so often that now they recognize us.  Still, the food is usually brought promptly and they're quick to take plates away and refill water.
2009-12-27,4,I've been craving Sushi, and since my wife is preggers I can only reminisce... As far as Sushi places in Hoboken go this our favorite. We are very into old school/traditional sushi so I can't really comment on the special rolls, nonetheless the fish are fresh and taste good, and lets face it, that is all we really need... The kitchen dishes were also a pleasant surprise
2009-12-27,4,tasty and easy for new or reluctant sushi eaters.
2009-12-19,4,I got 23 piece of sashimi dinner for $23.  This is probably the best deal in hoboken.  On top of that, its BYOB.
2009-12-11,5,LOVE this place.  Not only is it the best sushi in Hoboken, but some of the best sushi I have ever had.  Very reasonable prices, fresh fish, creative and delicious rolls.  Though it is modern and "chic" inside it is still a neighborhood sushi joint and they know us by name.  We go there at least once a week - it's that good.  The service is prompt and very friendly.  I have been to very expensive sushi places in my day and this stacks up.  Plus it's BYO!  You have to try the alligator roll!  I cannot recommend this place highly enough.
2009-11-01,4,i think the Yellow Submarine roll is my new fave.  Fried Banana with kimchi roll.  Sounds so weird, but so good.  I appreciate inventiveness.
2009-10-31,4,Sushi was very good especially the special rolls. I recommend the kite-runner roll. The service was somewhat slow but have had worse.
2009-10-30,4,My boyfriend and I ate here last week...Definitely one of the best sushi places I've been to in Hoboken so far. The special rolls were delicious yet slightly pricy for the size. The service was far from great, but not worth passing the opportunity to try the food. I will be going there again and hopefully the service will be a little faster this time. The decor and setting are super chic and funky, good atmosphere.
2009-10-21,5,GREAT sushi and even better delivery service. I came here based on a tip from a friend and I was NOT disappointed. This has become my weekly sushi place .. yes I eat it that often. Sadly I could probably eat it everyday .. but my wallet can not handle that. Why I like it .. 1. Hoboken has too many sushi places .. but this one is very clean and modern looking. Plus it is NOT loud like some others. 2. They have more inventive rolls and much better customer service. 3. BYOB !! 4. Decent prices. 5. The rolls and pieces are always fresh. 6. The roll of the day is always interesting. If you decide to do takeout they are normally at your door within 25 minutes and the rolls/pieces are just as good.
2009-09-16,5,Yes it's in Hoboken, but I'm gonna say it dammit! This might well be my favorite sushi place EVER (I tried Blue Ribbon Sushi in Broklyn once and I didn't actually like it very much--nothing special). I've only been for lunch but the food is always great. I've never tried a special roll I didn't like, even if the ingredients sound nutso (mozzarella, strawberries, whatever). The staff is super friendly and attentive. They pour my tea for me almost every time. The selection is great for the lunch specials: not just a set 2 or 3 roll prescribed combo; you can pick your own and the choices are very good (spicy tuna or salmon, eel avacado and/or cucumber, tempura sweet potato... not just salmon, tuna, cali roll boringness). The decor is a little nouveau modern for my taste--all steel and stone, but it all fades away when my food arrives anyway.
2009-09-04,4,Normally B.Y.O.B for my friends and I would result in several bottles of wine being consumed.  However, we ate so much at Hoboken's Illuzion that only one bottle was killed between four people.Seaweed and ginger salads were great and the boys (because they were a bit scared of the sushi) ordered spring rolls which were delicious.We ordered Foxy Lady, Old Man and the Sea, and then several rolls containing crab, lobster, and tuna.  Nothing was overly spicy and the flavor combinations went really well together.  This together with fairly fast service made the dinner great.Overall, great for people watching if you sit out on the sidewalk, very accepting of large, loud groups, and very good food you will definitely want to share!
2009-07-08,3,Tried it for dinner on a relatively-slow night.Place was ok... vibe and crowd was fun and a bit subdued.  Had the chirashi (sashimi combo over some sushi rice) and it was quite good - fresh fish and generous portions.  Staff was attentive and able to give me some substitutes (going for low fat, low sodium - not the easiest in an Asian place).A minor nit - with the open doors/etc is that there were flies/insects in the dining room.  Summertime in 'Boken... bring it on, Andrew Zimmern....Will definitely be back... gotta remember to BYO next time !
2009-06-30,4,On Washington Street you have 8 different Sushi joints(all own by Chinese) in 6-7 block radius. Illuzion is no different compare to other places in the area. Above average service and hot tea is served in traditional tea maker pot (Heavy little blackstone pot). The Lunch specials are excellent and prices are very fair.Pros: Good eats and pr$ce, 2/3 rolls for $9 / $11. Basic Sushi & Sashimi order will only set you back $13.50 (Very large and generous pieces). Happy-hours 20% off on certain macki rolls.Cons: Place smells like a mop during early lunch hours. Corner building so human/car traffic if you decide to dine outside.
