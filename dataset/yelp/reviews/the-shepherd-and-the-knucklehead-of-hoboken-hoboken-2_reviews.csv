2021-11-15,3,Cost: $11.95Pros: Fries were good.Cons: It was literally chicken fingers, bleu cheese & Frank's Red Hot sauce surrounded by a wrap - lettuce and tomato were negligible. The wrap was falling apart, I could barely grip it.Rating: 5.1 / 10Bonus: I ordered the $10.95 Philly Cheesesteak spring roll. Not a fan.
2021-11-12,5,I've ordered multiple times and every single time I order everything is 100% correct, down to the sauces. Definitely doesn't go unnoticed!
2021-11-07,2,In one word "Disappointing".  We headed here because my partner and I are Jets fans and followers of the Badlands Pod Cast.  Our experience at The Shepard and the Knucklehead was a disaster.  We arrived early more than an hour and a half before kick off. We came from work so we were hoping to eat.  When we walked there were many open tables.  They were offering an all night open bar for $45.00. My partner doesn't drink so this wasn't an option for us. We hunted around and finally found a table that did not have a "reserved" sign on it.  Eventually a very kind  but poorly informed waitress arrived and told us that this table was also reserved.  She was unsure if we could order food from the bar. I spent about 20 minutes trying to flag down the ONE bartender they had for the all night open bar to try to get a drink or some food. There was no designated area to order from at the bar; an absolute necessity with an open bar for an event.  I can't comment on the food because after an hour we just gave up and left. But the service was poor, disorganized and not well planned for an event.  When we left the "reserved" table we wanted to sit at was still empty. I get the feel they are not used to hosting events. I can only hope this is not their usual level of service, but you never get a second chance to make a first impression.  An event is an opportunity to introduce your venue to potential new customers. Sadly I don't think we will be making a second trip.
2021-10-30,1,I'm writing this review in response to a disappointing delivery experience I've had, with a restaurant that I used to enjoy. More than an hour after placing the order, I was notified that my address was "out of delivery range" and that the order was now cancelled, which is initially problematic since they have delivered to my address dozens of times over the past year plus. I certainly can't expect a delivery from a restaurant that is unwilling or unable to fulfill an order and am also willing to ignore the incongruous reason given. However, I would and should expect that information to be relayed to me sooner than the hour it eventually took, for me to be told that the order was cancelled and that food was not on the way. This is not how you handle whatever staffing issue you may or may not have, that resulted in the initial issue, but it's certainly how you lose regulars.
2021-10-13,1,Wow. This place used to be reliable. Last two times I've ordered they messed it up or came 1.5 hours late. Tonight I ordered a cheeseburger, fries and a cheesecake. Simple enough. How could they mess this up? Half an hour after my order I get a notification that my food is on the way. Great. Then I get a notification that the flavor of cheesecake isn't available so they cancel it. No chance to get another dessert. Just canceled. Half an hour later I'm wondering where my food is, so I call the restaurant but no one answers. Call again. No answer. An hour passes before I give up on my dinner. Guess even a cheeseburger and fries is too difficult for this establishment to handle. Never ordering from here again.
2021-09-26,5,Threw a 30th birthday party at the Shep for 35 people and couldn't have been happier with the service we received! The owner, Joe, was absolutely amazing to work with - very communicative and took away all of the stress that comes along with throwing a party. He was present for the entire party and despite being clearly very busy he made time to help with anything we needed throughout the night. Prices were very reasonable and they accepted Venmo for payment which I loved! Joe made this party about our experience not about the money, which I was very appreciative for.We had the back section under the lights which was a beautiful space. The serve assigned to our party (who was also serving 2 other parties that night) was extremely attentive. Anything we needed he got us within 30 seconds. Was so impressed with the service we received. The bar itself was very packed due to a football game and UFC fight but that didn't slow down the amazing bartenders who made sure everyone got their drinks in a very timely manner. Didn't wait more than a minute to get a drink for the entire night. The food was great - got a few trays of sliders, Mac n cheese, fried zucchini sticks, fried pickles, salad, fries, and chicken fingers. Every last bit of food went which speaks to how good it was (or we were all just very hungry haha) Overall would definitely recommend hosting a party at the Shepherd and the Knucklehead. You won't regret it!
2021-09-20,5,I've been ordering from The Shepherd & The Knucklehead for 4 year, and I am rarely disappointed with my meal. My friend and I decided to watch Sunday football here and had a hard time deciding which beer to order because this bar has a large number of craft beers on tap. This is great place to watch the games because they have the NFL ticket and show all of the games. Even though they were busy, the bartenders and serving staff kept our drinks coming and delivered our food while it was hot. Molly and Chase checked in on us regularly and made us feel welcome. I recommend the Poutine Tacos and Steak Quesadilla. All of the flavors complemented each other, and the portions are huge. Also, if you like wings, you have various flavors to sauce them up! I have had the pretzel sliders on previous visits, so I also recommend those. Overall, great spot to watch sports, drink beer, and eat tasty food!
2021-08-21,2,Ordered delivery because I was craving a good burger and this was very disappointing. The burger was dry, the brioche bun was hard and the lettuce was brown and super soggy. The fries were really dark which makes me think the oil was old. I woke up in the middle of the night extremely sick and have had stomach issues all day.
2021-07-21,3,Shepherd and knucklehead is kind of only a spot where locals that are hoboken-savvy know about it. Right on the edge of where Hoboken meets Weehawken allll the way up town, it's easy to miss and very easy to forget about. But I personally like it, it's not the kind of place that's gonna be bumping club music and you see smokeshows bringing out Grey Goose with sparklers on them like some of the places you see near Washington Street. But the ambiance is nice, it's a pretty spacious bar and their Buffalo chicken spring Rolls just may be the cure to the HIV.
2021-07-01,5,This bar has great service, and is very clean! They have trivia night which are super fun, and a great place overall to watch the game.Amalia is def the coolest bartender there so ask for her
2021-05-15,3,This was an average experience. Went on a Wednesday when they had Trivia night. We were seated quickly but it took a really long time for them to take our order. They have a good collection of beers. The honey glazed spicy kielbasa was brilliant. The chicken spring rolls were okay. The biggest letdowns were Poutine and pulled pork sliders which soured our experience. The vibe was good.
2021-04-08,5,I really njoyd eating here this week.. I worked in this location for 2days and we ate there both days... the wings are great!!!! (old bay, Buffalo park. Dry rub) OMG!!!!!! and the owner/Bartender very attentive and friendly... next time I'm working in the area or in the mood for some good wings... this is the spot!!!!!!
2021-03-16,4,Tried the Buffalo chicken wrap the other night and was pleasantly surprised. I always expect burgers and wraps to be good from bars, but this was better than I expected. It was different from most Buffalo chicken wraps but it's hard to pinpoint exactly why.Chicken was crispy and I loved the grill marks on the outside of the tortilla. It came with an extra side of Buffalo sauce, but it would've been better had that been blue cheese or ranch. That's really the only knock I have.Sweet potato fries were above average. I'm hoping this wasn't a fluke and that this is how Shep & Knucklehead's buff chick wrap actually is. Will def be stopping by again soon
2021-02-22,5,Always know I'm gonna get good food and local beer whenever I'm here, and that makes me a VERY happy man. Went with  th mozzarella wedges this time (probably top 3 in Hoboken) so amazingly crispy on the outside and cheesey goodness on the inside. Buffalo wings up next that were the perfect amount of heat and covered in parm, like CMON! So good! Lastly, slow-cooked bbq pulled pork sammy with a wonderful bbq flavor only enhanced with sharp cheddar ughh amazingness. Great local beer from Kane Brewing Co. Not pictured, but complimented the meal wonderfully!
2021-01-22,5,We had the ahi tuna tacos and the steak fajita tacos. Both were delicious. Owner recommended a local blonde beer that was also very good. Great food, great service, great people. We will definitely be back.
2021-01-16,5,Amazing service and delicious food! Great environment for a big game night! Love the beer selection and the owner is present and attentive to ensure everything runs smoothly!!!  Great playlist as well!!
2020-12-16,5,Love the food and a great beer list. Definitely worth stopping into. Owner recently reached out to clarify an order mishap personally - Thanks!
2020-12-04,4,Kielbasa was amazing great service & good food. We showed up an hour before close and they were still friendly.
2020-11-01,3,I was craving Mac n cheese and this place is right near my apartment so I decided to order for take out. I got a notification that my food would be ready in 20 min, but ended up getting there in 35 min. I also figured it would maybe take a bit longer which happens.. Once I get there it takes 5 min for someone to talk to me then another 15 min for me to actually get my food, but I'm usually pretty laid back about service because you never know what the situation is so I didn't dwell on it once I left. The Mac n cheese was honestly a bit disappointing because it literally tasted like noodles with cheese sprinkled on - zero flavor. I decided to give them a 3 star only because they have a fun atmosphere otherwise (pre covid) and I've heard great things about other menu items that are super good!
2020-09-08,4,The Shepherd & the Knucklehead is several steps above most sports bars, particularly as it pertains to their substantial drink menu, with 60 beers on tap, a lengthy list of mules, and a handful of custom cocktails.  The place is also very spacious with a bunch of tables and plenty of space to congregate.  On my recent visit, we grabbed a table outside and ordered a Bloody Mary, which I had majorly been craving.  The spicy drink included a lot of horseradish, as well as hefty dose of vodka.  But, do not let that description turn you off, I mean all of that in a good way!  In fact, I wound up ordering two of the Bloody Mary's...in the middle of the evening.The Shepherd & the Knucklehead is a fun place to enjoy an afternoon, watch a game, or try some local brews.
2020-08-13,5,First impressions mean everything, and today I had the most amazing one. Let's start at the top, shall we?I was able to call and actually get kind friendly assistance from Joe, who I learned was the manager when I arrived. There was a small wait(expected at this time) but Joe made the waiting experience pleasant. There was a community waiting table(socially distanced of course) in front of a walk up bar where you can order drinks while you wait. I had a Galaxy Dust DIPA that was so amazing that I purchased a 4 pack to go!Joe took the time to ask how we heard about the place, and tell us a little backstory and invite us to come back and be regulars. That may seem like a small gesture, but with everything going on in the world right now, it's a grand gesture to be so hospitable. The menu had a pretty good selection of food you expect to find at a pub/bar and grille. They also have a large selection of steaks that they say a cut daily on site. Loved the mash and seasonal vegetables, steak was tender, my only wish was for more seasoning. But, I would rather it be under-seasoned than over seasoned. Overall, the food good and I would gladly go back. I am excited for the world to go back to whatever normal is so I can sit inside as well. The atmosphere seems very upbeat and welcoming.
2020-07-26,3,Special instructions were not followed tonight unfortunately. Tonight we were delivered raw chicken wings, undercooked fries and a rare burger. This was for my boyfriends birthday dinner and it was all wrong.The owner kindly gave me a call and he refunded the order which was very kind of him. I appreciate restaurant owners who care about their customers.I hope his employees will feel the same as he does.
2020-07-25,5,Stopped by for a beer to sustain me in my walk home weighed down by Trader Joe's bags full of groceries.  Manager was helpful and the beer was great.  I've never been there before but when life goes back to normal, I'll try it.
2020-07-09,5,Trying to support local restaurants and tonight decided on Sheph & Knucklehead. Its a place I brought many friends and family, pre- COVID, to enjoy amazing beers and food! The food was amazing.... arrived still warm from delivery with a 30 min turn around. Joe, the owner, was extremely helpful with recommending options and being flexible with the menu. Can not wait to go there once open again, but take out will def be happening again!
2020-06-29,3,Drinks and service are always great but the food constantly misses the mark. Everything is very oily and breads stale. Drinks and service is good tho! Would suggest for a night out or Sunday football, just not food.
2020-06-23,5,I came here for my birthday. Due to Covid and outdoor dining being fresh in NJ, reservations were going by quickly. It was difficult to find a spot in JC/Hoboken area for 6 people but this spot came in clutch last minute. I made reservations the day of 3 hours prior. They were very accommodating and friendly. We sat outside and food/drinks were on point. Service was great. We had a waiter who was a teacher and conversed a bit with us. It was a chill first time out in awhile. Will definitely be coming back. Thanks so much!
2020-05-20,1,Ordered a pulled pork sandwich & sweet potato fries for delivery. The flavorless, dried out pulled pork was adorn with a few shreds of cold cheese and set upon a soggy roll. The fries were a cold pile of mush. Total waste of $
2019-12-11,4,-I went on Trivia Night (Wednesdays) and the place was filled! Trivia was a great time! -They have great happy hour drink specials -They have tons of beer on tap- Great bar menu selection and variety: apps, burgers, sandwiches/wraps, salads-I had the buffalo Parmesan wings, Philly cheesesteak egg rolls, abc Mac and cheese. My favorite were the buffalo parm wings. It was such a unique flavor and the parm was a great touch
2019-11-02,5,Just stopped here for lunch before going to Trade Joe's which is across the street.   It's a nice pub with a good beer selection.   Food was very solid. I had the ahi tuna tacos and my wife had the ahi salad. Our server was very friendly and helpful.   They have a ton of tvs so it looks like a good place to catch the game too.  I'll be back for sure
2019-10-22,5,The Shepard & the Knucklehead are SUNDAY FUNDAY GOALS!! They checked off every box for me - ambiance, delicious food, great service. good music, plenty of TVs for my honey's Sunday football. I literally can not wait to come back! Loved the casual, spacious ambiance along with back to back hits playing while brunchin' it up!  Your boozy brunch options are $25 Prosseco buckets, $15 pitchers of sangria or $5 Bloody Marys! I was in a bubbly mood so went for the prosseco. I am blown away by how much I loved both brunch entrees! The steak & eggs was a plate fit for a King - fully loaded with potatoes and french toast. The sea salt on top of the skirt steak was the perfect touch to a tender, juicy steak. The taylor ham, egg and cheese french toast sandwich was on an other level! The perfect savory and sweet combination!! Service was great, super attentive and friendly. Parking isn't the greatest in this area but good news is there's a lot right across the street. Shepard & the Knucklehead, see you soon! :)
2019-10-19,1,Too bad I can't give it zero!  Bar was busy and l waited behind two guys that ordered.  I asked for an IPA recondition and a stout for my buddy.  Bartender says we have 15 of them on tap - no recommendation.  Then he says I am too close to the service area - he didn't want my business so I left and went to Pilsner house.  Why ever go here???
2019-09-18,5,No surprise that this place is as good as it is. The menu is basically identical to the original location, which has been in business for 21 years. The owner is very welcoming and helpful. The food is on point, and the atmosphere can't be beat. A perfect spot for watching a big sporting event, with myriad TVs visible from most areas of the restaurant. No matter what you order, you can't go wrong!
2019-08-18,5,Amazing service, great food and awesome cocktails. Came with a bunch of friends on a Sunday afternoon and the servers were attentive and the food was absolutely delicious. They were playing great music and it was the perfect way to end a weekend. We all had a great time!
2019-06-15,1,Food is always meh. Service is always poor and slow. Layout is bad. If you're going to watch sports that's all this place has going for it but prepared to listen to music so loud you have to scream over each other to hear. Won't be going back again even though it's a few steps from my apartment.
2019-06-13,4,This bar exceeds expectations of what you would consider your average sports bar. Starting with the food, I've ordered the mushroom burger as well as the buffalo spring rolls, and both were delicious! The burger was nice and juicy with mushrooms and cheese on top, and it came with a side of sweet potato fries which were very crispy and fresh out of the fryer. The buffalo spring rolls are also fried so how can you really go wrong with that? One time I did order the tuna tacos and they weren't great, the tuna was very overdone, but after I ate my boyfriend told me that's not something to get at a sports bar. So moving forward I went with the burger and spring rolls.  The atmosphere is also great, it's a very big bar relative to the size of the other bars in Hoboken. It's covered with so many TVs on the walls and also has a huge on tap selection of beer. My boyfriend and his friends like to come here to watch sports games sometimes, not really as a place to go out at night.
2019-05-07,5,I hosted a surprise birthday party for about 20 people here and it was a huge hit! Their food/brunch and drink specials are great, it's a fun atmosphere, and the owner could not have been any nicer or more accommodating! Would highly highly recommend.
2019-05-05,4,The Shepherd & the Knucklehead is such a great bar | food joint.Food : It's extremely casual and the kitchen stays open late, they serve up your typical bar choices and then some! Angus Sliders were well cooked with cheese perfectly melted on them. Buffalo chicken egg rolls were a little dry, but still a great surprise!Drinks : They have a great selection of beer - the bartender here actually opened up my eyes to pink delirium beer which I'm now hooked on.Service : Friendly and quick.Parking - Street parking or across the parking garage near Trader Joes
2019-05-05,5,This place is amazing! I threw a surprise birthday party here and it was perfect. Joe was beyond amazing from the day I emailed him asking about party options up until the party ended. He was very accommodating and always got back to me right away. The space was perfect for our large group, food/beer/music was great. Highly recommend this place for your next party!
2019-03-23,3,Mixed on this place. The food is actually quite good, and generally speaking they have good craft beer. The issue is the service. I've been here many times and each time it feels as if I am doing the bar tenders a disservice by ordering a beer.  I should feel privileged that they're serving me.  They're not very helpful, and are not knowledgeable about craft beer at all.  They are also trying to do too many things. They try to cater to families during the day, try to be a craft beer bar AND and sports bar, and a total out of town bro fest on Saturday nights. I get it, they want to maximize revenue, but this place oftentimes has me a bit bewildered.
2019-02-10,3,They have several different types of old fashioneds on the menu that sound interesting but are very expensive. Wasn't a fan of the dj, would go back for happy hour to score a nice deal
2019-02-10,2,It started out ok. But then this place started playing weird music like Enya and Celine Dion. I was out of there.
2019-02-08,1,This place was kind of gross.... it smelled like pee and the food gave me a stomachache. Enough said.
2019-01-22,3,Amazing beer selection but average to above average food. The server we had was friendly until she peace it for the night. We never saw her again. We then had to move to the bar and pay our tab there. The buffalo burger was delicious but served on the wrong bun. They said brioche not pretzel. My girlfriend's salmon BLT was good as wellBut serves on a hard cibatta over sliced bread.Odd but whatever, I would go back for the beer
2019-01-06,2,We went here on a Saturday night during a football playoff game and they charged us $9 for a Chardonnay bc they were out of Pinot Grigio! First - how are you out of the most common white wine women drink? If you want this to be a frat house with just beer and fireball shots just put that on your menu.  Second - the bartender ran out of wine glasses! So they served my fiancé her PG in a Goose Island glass and it was a weak ass pour for $9.  We def won't be back even though we live around the corner.  I'm giving it 2 stars bc at least they had a DJ during the commercial breaks which signifies you know your audience somewhat.
2018-12-18,5,Great local bar with an easy-going, sports bar type of vibe. I have definitely become a regular here, especially during football season. Large beer selection on tap, including many craft beers from NJ. Food is good and they have specials on Thursdays. Staff is always friendly and they work really well together. Lots of seating as well!
2018-12-09,5,The Shep is my favorite bar in Hoboken. Great beer selection, plenty of seating, pretty good food, a place you can bring your friends. I will say that the nachos on Tequila Thursday are not as good as they once were... But otherwise no complaints from me!
2018-12-02,3,Tons of beer selection! Typical bar food such as chicken fingers and fries. Layout is very spacious and stocked with tons of TVs. During football season they have EVERY game on.
2018-11-28,4,I've been here several times for the bar, never to eat. I love this place because it's pretty causal and my favorite part is the darts. Usually have a slight wait to play but everyone there has always been friendly. Great selection of different beers.
2018-11-16,3,Big place, great for Sunday football, much emptier during the other weekend nights. I prefer the location in Haledon, its smaller more intimate
2018-11-14,5,Went for Good Beer Passport Weekday Happy HourFood - 5/5. Angus sliders were of good thickness and a beautiful medium rare. The cheese melted perfectly to look appetizing and cover all of the beef while the pickles gave that refreshing bite to balance out the richness. Buns were nice and buttery while having a slightly firm bite like a pretzel. Fries were very crispy and golden brown. The sliders and fries both went well with the house sauce which was creamy and piquant with a hint of sweetness. Tasty!Service - 4/5. Friendly and quick.Value - 5/5. Their happy hour shaves off $2 for tacos and sliders making the slider plate $10. $10 for three fat sliders and plate of fries is a great deal. Awesome happy hour!Parking - Street (Metered)
2018-11-12,5,I never take the time to give restaurants reviews but this place is seriously so good. I'm the pickiest eater ever and so hard to please but everything I've ever ordered from here tastes amazing. Best pretzel I've ever had.
2018-10-14,5,Really good service and a fun place to hang out! The manager introduced himself personally and made sure we were taken care of which was much appreciated. They have great drink and food specials too! Definitely a fun bar to hang out at or to have a meal (delicious GF wings too!!)
2018-09-17,1,Very slow. Wanted 40 minute for a burger. I have nothing good to say about this place.
2018-08-10,5,We went to that place for the Canada day weekend and the service was impeccable. We were with our 2 children and the staff was very friendly. We tried the poutine and other starters and it was very tasty. If you are looking for a nice place with cool vibe, try this place.
2018-08-01,4,Great happy hour and beer selection. Bar food staple in Hoboken - would recommend the burger, buffalo chicken egg rolls, and wings. They have a hot pretzel which is also tasty for an app! Tons of beers on drafts to try a few different ones with your meal.
2018-07-15,4,This is a great, casual spot! Cant believe I hadn't been here before yesterday. They have a big menu with everything from sliders to tacos, plenty of drink specials, and there wasn't a wait for a table...which is rare in Hoboken on a Saturday. Also, the people that work there are very friendly and helpful. Definitely a good place for brunch -- only $15 for a huge sangria pitcher (that tasted amazing). Everything we ordered was delicious (definitely try the mozzarella wedges - so good). I'll be back again soon!
2018-06-22,5,I'm there at least 10 times a month. The staff is filled with excellent people who go out of their way for customers. The food is a small upgrade from the typical "bar food" and is well made.The selection of beers changes weekly and the bartenders are all excellent at recommending a beer based on what a customer says they like. If you're not certain if a particular micro brew IPA is right for you, they are quick to provide you a taste of a couple.
2018-06-15,2,I've been here for food and beers at least 15 times since moving here and tonight is probably the last time.  They have the best craft beer selection in Hoboken, some great happy hour deals, and good food.  Even with all of that, I don't think it's worth it for the consistently terrible service.  Tonight (early evening on a Friday), I was literally the only person sitting at the bar and sat with an empty glass for 20+ minutes while the bartenders chit chatted with each other at the other end of the bar.  I ended up just cashing out rather than ordering another drink.  If this was the first time this has happened, or the bar was busy, I'd chalk it up to an off night.  However, this is the norm at this bar - I can count on one hand the times the service has been even average here, and I've had similar (though not quite as bad) experiences in the past.  It's honestly disappointing - I live a minute away from this bar and I love the beer selection and the food.  But with 100 other bars in Hoboken, the service is so frustrating that I've finally gotten to the point where I'd rather walk somewhere else.
2018-06-03,1,Love a good beer bar in Hoboken, and we def need more. But I don't like when the bar has 5+ beers on their menu that have kicked. Re-print the beer menu, it's not difficult. Also, the list has deteriorated and the nachos may be the worst nachos I've ever had. The Haledon spot kills this place. Brutal
2018-05-16,1,Tremendously unimpressed.  Others seem to like it, so maybe it's me.  Thought the food was bland for such an intriguing menu.
2018-04-23,5,I had my daughter's Baptism party here and it was amazing. Joe the owner was wonderful to work with. My husband and I had 90 guests and the space was perfect. Joe went above and beyond to ensure that the party went off without any hitches. He helped us pick out our menu and made suggestions for the floor plan. The bartenders and waitstaff were really friendly and our guests really enjoyed the food and their amazing beer selection, over 60 beers on tap!  There is a parking garage across the street which made it real easy for our out of town guests who drove in for the day.   There is a wonderful stage area where we hired someone to perform on acoustic guitar.  Please consider the Shepherd and the Knucklehead for your next event.
2018-04-22,4,This used to be the Old Smokin Barrel however the food here is different.  I was in Hoboken yesterday enjoying nice day outside. At it was getting around game time for some sporting events.  NHL/NBA playoffs and also some Mets baseball.   I decided to come here.  What a great set up to watch some sports. Long bar 4 TVs at the bar and at least 7 more scattered around.   Some Bruce Springsteen was playing.  It was a decent crowd.  There was only one spot at the bar so I took it.   A huge beer selection on tap but I'm more of a bourbon guy.  So I ordered a Makers on the rocks.  Then bartenders were very attentive and welcoming.  The food menu was nice and looking at the pics on yelp the food looked really good. More if an upscale bar food menu.  There were a few things I wanted to try. Like the several burgers they have. Or the different types of egg rolls.  Homemade jalapeno poppers.   Different wraps and Sammies.  Check out their menu.   I decided to go with the grilled chicken Sammie and added bacon of course.   The way to a good Sammie is a good piece of bread. And they had that here. It was a nice long chibatta roll that was lightly toasted. With thin as pieces of grilled chicken. Lettuc, tomato, red onions with mayo on the side. It was a good Sammie.  The fries were ok not as crispy as I would have liked them.   All in all a great place to watch a game and have some drinks. Check out the daily specials I posted. There were some decent offers there. Too much to write. Lol. There are also 2 dart boards if u get the urge.  Trader Joes is across the street. And I believe you can park in the garage and walk across because parking in Hoboken can be a disaster.
2018-04-10,1,My wife and I went in for a drink before dinner Saturday night. We were seated and waited 10 minutes before a waitress acknowledged us. After we finally ordered a drink we waited another 10-15 minutes before another waitress came by to ask if we were ready to order....as our drinks sat on the bar waiting to be served. The Moscow mule (a signature drink there) we ordered had so much ginger beer in it, it was undrinkable. The kicker is I look at my cc statement this morning and they charged me more than what we signed at the restaurant! What an awful experience. I wouldn't recommend.
2018-03-29,5,Every day outside of Sunday this place is great. Could have just been a very busy Sunday football but that was my only issue. Great beers on tap and good quick food.
2018-03-01,3,Considered one of the best beer bars in NJ, I was in the neighborhood for work and decided to stop by for happy hour. The draft list is legit with an impressive number of local NJ brews. Represented breweries included Magnify, Carton, Brix City, Kane, Firestone Walker, Victory, Wet Ticket. Diverse brews ranging from wheat beers to IPAs and stouts, but did not have any big bourbon barrel stouts which are a personal favorite. The bartender was super friendly and willingly provided tastes of different beers before settling on my order.The food was ok. Not great, not terrible. I've starting digging those beer bars with an elevated gourmet style menu...this food fell well short of that. The pulled pork sliders were more bread than meat and lacked flavor outside of me dipping it in bbq sauce.I'd come back for the beer and friendly, but prob go elsewhere for the meal!
2018-02-26,4,They have one of the better beer selections around and an extensive food menu. The food was ok, above typical bar food but not too memorable. Good spot to catch a game and have a few beers that don't end in "light".
2018-02-23,4,Great selection of craft beers on tap, probably the best list in Hoboken. Bartenders and staff are extremely nice and welcoming. Great place to walk in and grab a beer at the end of a day.
2018-02-18,5,I had a great time here two weekends ago for a friends 30th birthday. I live near the original location of The Shepherd & The Knucklehead which is a great local bar for craft beer and drinks. The Hoboken location also creates the same atmosphere and has great craft beer selections. However, this location also has a more "party" vibe and music as the night progressed. It absolutely has more open space for dancing potential and a small stage like area with dart boards on the side.We were able to do an open bar special for $35 which included beer and wine or $40 for beer, wine, and single-mix liquor drinks. We had a great night and this is definitely a place that I would want to return.
2017-12-17,1,If their was less then a one star rating I would 100% give it.  We walked in and we had to find our own table which was dirtier then the floor.At this point the waitress was no where to be found.  It took a solid 25 to 30 minutes before she came over to ask us what drinks we wanted.The food on the other hand was absolute trash.I do not recommend this place for anyone.  You are better off eating out of a dumpster.
2017-12-15,4,Went here for $2 taco night on Thursday. The tacos were pretty good and the margarita pitchers were a good size for $15. The guac flight wasn't really worth it. At the end of the night though our waitress disappeared and we had to hunt someone down to get our check. All in all a pretty good relaxing bar.
2017-12-12,3,The Shepherd & the Knucklehead is a nice local sports bar in Hoboken. If you're looking to watch a New York team in a great atmosphere, you will enjoy this spot. The food is typical pub food - sliders, wings, french fries. Everything is decent - nothing special but definitely pretty good. The drinks are also a good price - I was slightly annoyed when three different cocktails/ciders were unavailable, but there's always a large enough drink menu to find something. On game days, be prepared to be there for awhile. The service is incredibly slow with the crowds, which makes sense but is worth noting. Definitely do not go here for a quick bite to eat. The tables are also very sticky, which was weird and unsanitary to me. Overall, a decent sports bar.
2017-12-04,1,I rarely write a review if it's negative however it needs to be known that the food I had delivered was absolutely terrible. I had chili that I had to pull out the strainer to get the at least half inch of grease on the top removed from it.  It did not taste like chili, it tasted like nothing but ground beef and grease.  I threw it out.
2017-11-29,4,This review is for take out only. I ordered dinner from here a couple nights ago. We ordered the steak salad, with blue cheese and red onions over greens and then the poutine, with pork shoulder. It came within 40 minutes, but the order was wrong. The delivery guy knew it was,He asked me to check.They brought back the right food just a short time later with an apology and they did let meKeep the wrong food. Why the star reduction? Food wasOkay. Definitely the salad had barely any lettuce, too many red onions, and way too much tomato.I would not get the salad again, it was sort ofTough to eat.
2017-11-06,1,I was there a while ago but it was that bad I need to review. We ordered mussels as our appetizer sounded good said there were carrots in it which I don't like but cam eat around, but when it arrived I saw no carrots so was like great. But not great right when I tried my mouth was burning, there were jalapenos in it, I looked at menu again and it has no mention of jalapenos, I could not eat at all. Them the main courses came out, not good, but we ate. By the time we got home my boyfriend was sick and throwing up from the food. Needles to say never again, we actually cringe when we drive by.
2017-11-04,4,Good craft beer bar in Hoboken. We ordered some food and I was impressed how good it was. Good place to have a few beers before heading out. We went on a Friday night so there was live music. The music was pretty loud but other than that it was a great time.
2017-10-29,3,Had the chicken fingers and pretzel which were slightly over cooked. Also tried the fish tacos which were very good, but spicy! Beer selection is good. When it gets busy during big games, they seem to be understaffed and hard to get attentive service.
2017-10-25,2,The beer was good but the service was terrible.My gf and I sat down at 1:20am and wanna order sth to drink but were told it would be the last call...what? The bar was suppose to be closed at 3am. The lady told us it would be closed at 2am tonight. Ok that was fine. After the 1st round we would like another one but the lady refused us saying the last call had been over... but there was another group of people keeping ordering drinks for multiple rounds...Then we paid the bill, left and decided wouldn't come again even though it's just a few mins walk.
2017-10-18,4,This place is great! My favorite time is happy hour, when they have a great deal on their beer specials.  However, anytime is a good time to be here.  They have daily specials, including an all you can eat wing night (on Wednesdays) which happen to be maybe the best wings in Hoboken.  This place is a great place to catch a sports game and drink a good craft beer.
2017-10-09,1,Ordered spring veggie soup tonight through ubereats. Very disappointed with the serving portion. The smallest serving size of soup You could imagine for the price 7$. Lol. Total waste!!
2017-10-01,2,They have a lot of tvs which is awesome for football but not sure how I feel about the dj in-between commercial breaks.  The food is soso not uneatable but not amazing.  Service was decent for how packed the place was.  They keep the window open which is really nice but people smoke way too close to them so if you at a table near the window it's really bad if your not ok with cigarette smoke.  Over all an average place, would of been 3 stars but the smoke issue knocked it down 1.
2017-09-26,3,Came here in the evening, it was pretty empty and seat yourself. It took a while for anyone to come over and greet us/take our order. The slow service continued, we were able to order appetizers but once it got busier we barely saw our server. Took way too long to finish the meal due to slow service, and we ended up spending 45 minutes waiting to get the attention of our server to get the check and then get him to come back and take our card to pay. The food was good for bar food, but the margarita pitcher was disgusting.
2017-08-26,1,Ok... worst experience in my life going to bars and restaurant in NYC and Hoboken... Hector charged me with extra drinks... when I asked why he yelled at me ( Surveillance cameras should be available, I was next to the service bar so in a possible lawsuit for discrimination I may ask for it) I talked to the owner, who sent me to get the check, when I went back the bar manager send the security guys after me... I will ask for my rights somewhere else... maybe as a latino the did that to me... I may have been the only one that night there so I felt like wow, even the girls next to me stopped talking to me because of that! ...  I know they have camera all over the place, so I know what I did.. do they know what they did???
2017-08-24,5,Came here at first because of the name. I was a little worried because there weren't a lot of people. BUT the food was great. We had chicken spring rolls to start. Then the ribs and the pesto pasta with cheesecake to finish. The food was gourmet and delicious! Not like any pub food I've had before. Definitely a great uptown hoboken place to try. Highly recommended.
2017-08-21,3,*Taco Thursday Review*The Shepard and the Knucklehead looks and feels a bit like a dive bar, but with a bigger space. It smells like old drinks and the tables are sticky. If you don't mind that, they actually have some pretty good drink/food specials - especially on a Thursday night, when you can get $15 pitchers of margaritas, and build your own tacos for $2-$3.The tacos aren't anything to write home about. Definitely not great tacos, but they're pretty good for $2-$3. Chicken, and chorizo are $2 each, and steak, ahi tuna, are $3 each. It's nice that you get to choose your own toppings (lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, pico de gallo, cheese, sour cream) and your choice of a few sauces, which comes on the side. The pitcher of margarita is a tad sweet and seems watered down, but we deffo started feeling something after one. They'll def sneak up on you.Service was a bit lacking and it wasn't even that busy. It took a while to get our tacos. Another couple sat probably 20 minutes after us and got their tacos at around the same time. Regardless, I'd still come back - especially to try their Monday $6.95 burger and fries special.
2017-08-09,4,I recently moved in to an apartment very close by here, so it has become my new go-to! The beer selection is great and the bartenders are always so helpful with recommendations for someone who isn't very knowledgeable about craft brews. My dine-in experience has always been great, servers are very polite and attentive and the first time my roommates and I came here, the owner came over, introduced himself, and chatted with us for a bit. The only reason I deducted a star was because both times I ordered for delivery there has been issues. The first time, they dropped off the wrong order and the second time, I ordered a burger that came cold and the fries were mushy from being in the plastic container for too long- definitely disappointing, especially since, like i said, I live very close by and I had expected it to come pretty hot. Other than that, it's a great place to stop and a have a bite and a beer if you have the time!
2017-08-03,4,Came here on a Monday. Staff was helpful and informative. We ordered a pitcher of sangria (red) which I would def order again. An order of regular buffalo wings (which during happy hour were 75 cents) and the giant pretzel with cup of cheese. For entrees we had the burger and the Mediterranean salad with chicken. Everything came out as expected. Service was fast and efficient. The only downfall and reasons for only 4/stars was that for a Monday night the  was atmosphere was dead. There was even a yankee game on and besides my table and one other table there were only five people at the bar. When we walked in it did smell like they just moped which is a good thing but then again I rather smell food when I walk into a place to eat not cleaning supplies. It's also kinda off the main strip which could be a downfall if trying to bar hop at night. But I would def recommend coming here for happy hour or dinner with friends. I'm sure I'll be back again soon myself !!
2017-07-29,3,I really appreciated the top notch service and the atmosphere, as well as the endless variety of beer they offer.. unfortunately for me, the food fell short.We ordered the poutine to start. It was hard to pass up by the way it was described in the menu. What we thought we'd get: a big mound of luscious meat smothered in melty cheese.. what we actually got: a few dollops of pork with a few sprinkles of cheese scattered on top. It was disappointing because after a few bites we were left with a bowl full of chips and no meat. I will say the pork tasted really flavorful but again.. portions were so disappointing! I also had the veggie burger which was really dry, hard, and bland. The only good thing about it was the aioli and the fries it came with. Above all my favorite part of dinner was my drink, it was deeelicious. Get the coconut mule!!!
2017-07-28,5,This place is awesome! Upon walking in we were greeted and seated by the owner Joe. Shortly after our waitress took our drink order and let us try a sample of the beer to make sure we liked it before ordering.  We then ordered the tuna tacos, the pork tacos and the veggie spring rolls. The food came out fast and was DELICIOUS!!! So flavorful and fresh! Joe came by a few times to make sure we had everything we needed and were happy with our order. Even on our way out Joe shook our hands and thanked us for coming. Overall great service, food and atmosphere! Definitely coming back!!!
2017-06-29,5,First time here...great atmosphere with good music, food, and specials. Would definitely recommend and will be returning!
2017-06-27,1,Wellllll...this place sucks. Point blank. Went in...sat my pretty ass down...waited 10 minutes for a waiter....no one came...left....the end.
2017-06-27,2,First time we came here it was a 3.5.  Came here on a Tuesday, June 27th.  We sat ourselves down and waited 10 minutes.  Girl at front played on her phone the entire time and did not say anything as we entered or left.  Good beers on tap, pathetic staff. Sad
2017-06-17,3,This is our first experience and it's rather underwhelming.  We came here under the previous ownership, but we are here tonight for happy our (they do it every day 3-7 and have really good drink and food specials).  Pro's: outdoor seating, extensive beer list (domestic and foreign with an entire page dedicated to NJ brews), happy hour every day, and an extensive bar food menu. Con's:  slow service (even when it's not busy and on an off-peak day/time), and the food is a strong mediocre).  Worth a visit if you're looking to try a new local beer on tap.
2017-06-04,2,Food is ok at best. Gave this place a second try and did not really rise to the occasion. Waited at the front door to be seated for a good 5 minutes with no indication from anyone. Wings are ok, burger was dry, service was eh. Most likely will not be back. Sorry
2017-04-13,4,Dropped by to catch a game and grab some grub.  Spacious, uber beer selection, and interesting menu.  Service was attentive and gracious.  Beer cold and fresh.  Opted for the ribs over rice and fresh veggies.  Ribs were wonderful!  And veggies fresh and a terrific compliment to the meal.  Definitely a go-to place for decent food and beer.
2017-04-13,5,First time going to their Hoboken location. It's definitely nice inside and good for groups. They also have outside seating. Now the important stuff, happy hour 3-7 pm. $2 off beer, sliders, and tacos. And daily specials on top of that. Did I mention 60 beers on tap? If you like craft beer and don't suck at life S&K might just be for you.
2017-04-09,5,One of the best brunches I've found in Hoboken/the city hands down.  Very reasonably priced and outrageously delicious food. I had the french-toast ham egg and cheese sandwich, which is possibly the best breakfast food I have tasted!!! A perfect mix of savory and sweet...every bruncher's dilemma finally solved (pancakes and french toast or bacon and eggs???) We also got the pork poutine quesadillas - also phenomenal. We loved it so much we went back the next day.  For lovers of bottomless, they do buckets of prosecco which are $25 and get the job done (OJ and cranberry juice on the side for color ;)). They also have 60 beers on tap. This place really just has it all. Everything that you'd want in a bar/eatery they do. Great food, great drink selections, reasonable prices, lots of TVs for sports, darts, live music...my new favorite place!
2017-04-06,2,2nd time around... there was a big dropoff in the food quality. I tried the salmon sandwich was not very good. The fries were also not as good as the first time.  Seems like their standards have slipped since it first opened up. Will try it again probably but was disappointed on this visit.
2017-04-06,4,My favorite go-to bar in Hoboken! Great beer selection, although most of the time I go, the taps I want are kicked :( But, other than that, great service, friendly bartenders, and cool HH deals. Obsessed with their giant pretzel and buffalo chicken spring rolls!! If you're in for some entertainment, they also have darts.
2017-04-01,3,Great beer selection but food is so so and I haven't had a meal yet that has blown me away. Good place for a happy hour and catching up with friends!
2017-03-27,4,Great place to hang and grab a drink and a bite to eat. Amazing pretzel and sauces, the cheesteak wrap was messy but worth it, great fries!
2017-03-16,3,It pains me to give The Shep 3 stars, but just know that this review is based on several visits here and does not reflect the delicious food or the quality of the friendly waitstaff.The 3-star review I am giving The Shepherd & the Knucklehead is based solely on the countless number of times I have been charged almost twice what I've owed because the restaurant has simply forgotten to apply Happy Hour specials and new menu prices to my bill. Just last night, what ended up being a $50 bill originally came to me and my boyfriend as over $100 because the waitress forgot to take off the Happy Hour specials and forgot to change the price of our beers from $9 to $2. This wouldn't be a problem if this were the first time it has happened, but this has happened EVERY TIME we've come here, and I suspect the owners just think people won't say anything--but I'm not one of those people. Fifty dollars is a lot of money, and if you advertise Happy Hour specials, be prepared to take those out of the bill.As for the food, I've never had a bad dining experience here, and I'm an especially big fan of the veggie burger and the mac and cheese (which I once got for free from a secret Happy Hour menu!). The beer selection here is always diverse and there's always something for everyone, plus the prices are reasonable (~$8 for a pint). If I didn't have so many problems with my bill every time I came here, I'd be back much more often.
2017-03-05,5,Wing lovers unite!! You want knock your socks off, clean your clock, polish your pallet wings? Look no further. Definitely venture out from the standard buffalo, the Thai sauce was really something special. This down to earth joint would even have that fat idiot Guy Fieri spinning in his chair. The beer selection is pretty kick ass too! I will definitely frequent this place more often.
2017-03-03,4,Very very nice bartenders and waitstaff! Wasn't crazy about the food, but I tried the signature poutine and it had a very sweet pork, which it mentioned, that threw me off. My fault, not theirs! They have 60 beers on tap which is a lot but not too overwhelming. I didn't drink any but my girlfriend liked hers!
2017-01-13,4,Really cool spot! Great craft beer list they have so many unique beers to choose from. The food was really good. High recommend the pretzel for an appetizer as well as the buffalo chicken spring rolls! Would definitely come back here.
2017-01-06,5,I went here with a group of friends and the service and food were excellent. I was very pleasantly surprised. The food came out quickly and was delicious me well prepared. The servers were all friendly and checked on us numerous times and brought everything out promptly. Good for a group or just two people. I'll definitely be back.
2016-12-29,5,Amazingly enough, the second location of the Shepherd & Knucklehead has managed to surpass the original location. I met with a large group of friends on a Friday night and we had plenty of room. This bar is fairly large for Hoboken, and the parking is somehow better than its location in Haledon, thanks to the garage across the street and the distance from the rest of Hoboken's bars.Although the Shepherd and Knucklehead was mostly known for its beer selection, the manager, Greg, really has his cocktails down. Tried a few drinks including the original Moscow Mule, the Santa Mule, and the one that comes in a giant golden coconut. The Santa Mule with Rosemary and Cranberry Juice was extremely well balanced and delicious, one of the best cocktails I've had. We munched on a few appetizers as well and they were fine. Definitely one of my favorite bars in Hoboken now.
2016-12-18,5,Fantastic place to watch sports and have something wonderful to eat. Good ambience and lighting, wonderul and polite staff and the owner is always walking  around ensuring the quality is very high
2016-11-28,5,Best food, best service, best drinks in Hoboken. Their drink options are endless and they have specials every day!!
2016-11-21,4,Large selection of draft craft beers. Cocktails are awesome and super affordable. Always have great specials going on. DropIn app also works here!This is what has been missing from uptown Hoboken.Lots and Lots of TVs, Bartenders Rock, and plenty of seating. Food here is solid. Past few places in this location have failed. Make note the food at TS&TK is what has been missing from this area. Very good chicken for Football season!
2016-11-20,4,I have only been here once so far to watch football. They had good drink specials and the food we had was good! It was a fun place with a lot of energy and I will definitely be back!
2016-11-18,2,As someone who enjoys craft beer I was very excited about this place opening.  But after coming last night, it left much to be desired.  To put it simply, $7 for an 8oz pour of a pretty regular IPA is insane.  I was at Cork City earlier in the night and paid the same price for a much better, and rarer, stout that was 10oz.  This place has an impressive tap list, and I'd love to go back, but I simply cant justify paying so much for so little.  Fix the prices/pour size and I will be a returning customer!
2016-11-17,3,This place has 4 star service and a 5 star beer list, so definitely come to drink. I had to weight down the overall rating due to the food. The best way I can describe it is disappointing, or sad even. The dishes are generally much smaller than you'd expect for a place like this, mercifully sparing you from having to eat too much of it. It's like the higher end prepared meals from your favorite grocery store. So, get a snack or whatever, but go for the excellent beer selection and great service. Also a great place to watch any sports event, especially if you're not too hungry.
2016-11-16,4,came here on election night with a friend to try out the tuesday specials. the location of this spot is a bit off the beaten path, but allows for a good amount of space! theres plenty of TVs and seats along with a large bar. the tues specials were $0.75 wings (6 per order), and discounts on sliders and tacos (both come in orders of 3, sliders also have fries). they also had $4 select craft beers. i partook in a local IPA that was on special. the beer selection here is great! tons of different choices. the food menu had standard bar food, sandwiches, fries etc. my friend and i got a dozen wings and chose buffalo and asian sauces from the 4 different flavors. we then got an order of classic sliders with cheese and bacon. everything was really good and i love the honey mustard type of sauce that came with the sliders. the fries were also great, really crisp and handcut like. we were so full and couldnt finish the food, this place was a deal for some tuesday fun!
2016-11-10,3,We've been twice now, mainly because its practically next door. I think it's just kind of average. It's a little better than Smokin' Barrel, but the same layout and pretty much same decor. Both times we have been it's empty, very empty, which is concerning. On Football Sunday's it's obviously packed, the bros come out in full force on Sundays. Other times it's pretty quiet. It just reminds me of a suburban chain restaurant (which technically, I guess they are).They do have an excellent selection of beers, and besides Cork City this is it in Hoboken for solid craft beer choices. I do enjoy that, however the service staff doesn't seem to know much about the beer at all. So you are on your own there. I haven't sat at the bar, so hopefully the bartenders are more knowledgeable. Servers are very friendly but fairly absent.The menu has pictures of food on it, I expect that from diners and Applebees, not a place like this. I've gotten the sliders, buffalo wings and the wife has had the chicken wrap and grilled chicken sliders. The food was just meh. It looks good, it sounds good but it's just average. The only thing that stands out are the fries, they are very good. The buffalo wings were puny and the thai sauce was very bland, the buffalo was OK. The grilled chicken sliders were super dry. The burger sliders were just ok as well. Overall, I'd come back for a quick bite and a beer because it's convenient but it wouldn't be my first choice for a meal.
2016-11-05,5,Great service, delicious food, and just right prices! They have a ton of beers on tap and even offer flights. I've had the wings and grilled chicken sandwich both of which were perfect. The owner has come over to our table both times we've been there to ask how everything was and seems to genuinely care about making sure the customers are satisfied (this always scores brownie points in my book). Plenty of TVs and specials. Good for dinner or for watching a game. Don't pass it by!
2016-10-25,3,Had dinner with friends a few days ago. The food was a little disappointing - very under seasoned. Drinks were good and service was good. Just wish the food was better.
2016-10-23,4,Love the original place in Haledon. I just recently checked out this one in Hoboken this Saturday night and the quality of the food was awesome just as it is in the Haledon location. I haven't had anything here I dislike. It's my go to place for burgers especially. They always cook the meat to a perfect medium-rare. The service on the other hand isn't the same quality as the one in Haledon but that can always be worked on and there's always an adjustment/settling in period to be considered with a new business. Same awesome atmosphere, awesome drink selection, and I look forward to trying out the brunch which I didn't actually know about. Definitely a go to for foodies and for people who love trying new beers.
2016-10-23,5,Giant game this morning.  No better place to watch and celebrate the win than the S&K. First time here. Fantastic menu and craft  selection. Waitstaff was very cool and attentive.  Owner was there, and very involved in the ebb and flow. Just read about the mission and the charity/giving profile of the owners. All the more reason to avail yourselves of this establishment. Next stop Haledon.
2016-10-17,5,Their location in Haledon is my favorite bar, period. Started going a couple of years ago with my older son who absolutely loves beer. And why shouldn't we love this place? Food is exceptional and they have literally 90+ craft beers on tap. The interesting thing is that whenever you mention the place to anyone, they start raving.It was with this expectation that we headed to Hoboken to try their new location and, as above stars indicate, it's also exceptional. Tipping the hat a bit closer to sports bar, the beer selection, food and especially the service could not possibly be better.This is how businesses grow. Create an awesome environment, stock it with good people and watch things happen. With The Shepherd & The Knucklehead, as long as they continue to follow this formula they should be able to keep opening new locations and winning over new customers. I honestly can't think of a better match then them and the great city of Hoboken. In a place with a virtual plethora of drinking/eating establishments IMO they reign supreme.When selecting 5 Stars, Yelp reminds you that you're rating them as good as it gets. With this location, they've certainly accomplished that. The only negative is no Tony but perhaps they can clone him :)
2016-10-17,4,good food, big menu, lots of tvs/tables/space for football watching, pretty good drink specials for the games from 11-3. HOWEVER do not get the sangria, there is almost 0 alcohol in it. definitely going back though.
2016-10-16,4,If you're a Giants fan, this is your home. Bartenders, servers and DJ all wearing jerseys while a sea of blue t-shirts cheer loudly (and drunkenly) as OBJ makes a late 66 yard TD to win the game. Even if you're not a Giants fan, fear not- they have several TVs and every game will be on. Great craft beer selection (we had 6), good sliders and good enough wings for $50. They have specials for football on Sundays and service is good. It was packed so we were standing the whole time and ordering from the bar, but a waitress approached us several times to make sure that we were ok on drinks even though we weren't at a table. Good experience- will be back for football!
2016-10-12,3,Average on every level.  Nothing special about the food, service or atmosphere.  I'll be back from time to time.  Was really hoping to find a more interesting menu after reading the name.  Waitress claims they're known for their steaks.  Given they just opened not sure how they're known for that.  Just a cheesy up sale technique.  I got a $18 steak sandwhich.  Nothing special.  Fries were not prepared correctly.  Like they were sitting in a bin forever before being served.  Lot of crappy little pieces like left overs.  Insides soggy.  One thing really bothered me here and I was just to leave 1 star because it really made not enjoy the place as much.  They sell you a $9 pretzel.  Ok, I get it I'm in a restaurant its going to be a little more money.  However, you can go to Philly and get a much better pretzel for a dollar.  They'll sell you 20 for like 10 bucks.  Nothing special about this pretzel.  Then after I order it the waitress tells me I have to get the special cheese sauce for the pretzel.  It was another 3 bucks for a tiny ramekin of cheese sauce.  Really?  You have to nerve to hit up your customers for another $3 on an over priced pretzel?  I'm in $12 plus tax plus tip on a mediocre pretzel.   $12 for a pretzel in an average restaurant in a terrible location in Hoboken with nothing special to offer.
2016-10-11,3,Wow...Craig just blew my mind.  I'm not much of a rum drinker but he just introduced me to two new brands.  Rum J.M. and El Dorado 12 year old cask.
2016-10-02,5,My fiancé and I went here to watch the NE game. They were so accommodating and provided incredible service! The food is delicious! I had the breakfast burger and highly recommend it! To top off a great experience, they have a wide variety of pumpkin and fall beers on tap! We will be returning!
2016-09-28,5,I've been here a few times, and I plan to keep coming. This bar has an impressive selection of craft beers. Impressive. And they change constantly, which might not be great for some people, but for those of use who like craft, it's a great thing. whoever is in charge knows what they're doing. If you know what you like, the bartenders can help you find a beer to drink. If you don't know what you like, they can STILL help you. I've only had the pub grub, but it's been terrific. No complaints.All in all, highly recommended.
2016-09-23,3,A step-up from the dreadful Smoking Barrel, if anything they're over-staffed but the service we had at the bar was friendly and attentive. The food is actually quite good and the beer selection impressive. There's no getting away from the fact that the venue itself will detracting . It's way too big, would have been nice to see some booths installed to cozy it up, and I'm sure when its actually filled (tough given its size, but probably a football game) it's feel like a 'rave'. Incrementally, however, this is definitely an improvement from before.
2016-09-22,5,Great food, great ambieance,  amazing beer selection and awesome service. will be back for sure
2016-09-22,3,I am cutting this place a little slack because it's week 2 but as of right now, pure amateur hour. Considering this isn't their first location, I'm being extra generous.I live in Weehawken right across the bridge so I was hoping to finally having a local craft beer bar in walking distance. Now, I'm thinking probably not.1) I came here on a football Sunday but for some reason they hired a DJ to play during the commercials of the early Giant game but leave when they were playing music instead of game sound during the later afternoon games. Huh?2) Menu notes "VIP Hoboken residents coming soon!" Guess they don't care about my business and think there's going to be tons of tourists coming besides it being nowhere near the PATH.3) It's week 2 and I saw many taps finished without being replaced. Extra worse considering they don't sell bottles.4) It's a craft beer bar but sizes are based on pricing rather than ABV (even though they aren't advertising "all beers $7 or less" or whatever it is).5) It's craft a beer bar but no good descriptions or RBV/BA ratings.6) It's a craft beer bar but bartenders don't seem to be well trained on what to recommend when a person asks for a Bud/Coors and told they are out.7) Week 2 and they were already running out of specials on NFL game night so much that by the late game they just had to say they had no specials because they ran out of cans.8) What bar, no matter what they're specialty, has no Jack Daniels?9) I tried the poutine tacos and they were pretty bad. No gravy and no cheese curds. I was told by other people that the burgers are good and the giant pretzel looked good though.In summary: it's nice to have a 2nd beer bar in Hoboken (after Corck City) but I was expecting so much better.
2016-09-18,2,This place COULD be awesome, but they really need to know their audience.Here on a Sunday afternoon to watch football and have a couple beers (like everyone else here) and the music is blasting Ja Rule at 300% volume. They have a great tv setup for watching the game and so many beers on tap, but I'm currently ready to walk out because the NFL Sunday vibe is ruined here. On NFL Sunday you can play music during commercials, but don't shake the booths seats from 1-7pm straight with bass to the point that you can't have a table conversation.
2016-09-09,5,We just went for the grand opening of this Hoboken iteration of what has been called NJ's #1 craft beer bar. We were not disappointed. First off, the beer selection is second to none for Hoboken. They have 60 craft beer taps that cater to a wide variety of styles and tastes. I hate when craft beer bars stock mostly double IPAs and neglect the many other styles people enjoy. Also, their happy hour (M-F $2 off beers, 3-7pm) puts a lot of these special beers within the same price range as a Miller or Yuengling here in Hoboken. We only had appetizers, but we devoured them. Everyone from the owner to the wait staff made us feel welcome, even with a baby in tow. Haven't posted on Yelp before, but I felt compelled to do so because we had such a great experience. My husband, who is much pickier than I am, really loved it and was making plans while we were there to come back with his friends. I can see this being a fun spot on NFL Sundays. We will be regulars here!
