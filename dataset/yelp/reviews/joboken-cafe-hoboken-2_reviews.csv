2020-11-24,5,Visited this cafe before work and decided to get a hot chocolate. I got a small but there is a small and large option. The staff was very welcoming and nice. She was smiling the whole time which was great to see early in the morning. The hot chocolate tasted fresh, chocolatey, and of course HOT. Perfect for the cold weather. I love that the place is small. Seems homey and the Christmas decor is so festive and nice. Will try something else next time!
2020-10-25,5,I am not sure why others really did not enjoy this place either. The simple, cute, chic decor. I tried their special drink and it was solid! The service is good from a friendly staff. I had a great experience at Joboken Cafe.
2020-10-20,5,Excellent coffee, no bs. Great food options. Music is great too. Makes me feel like I'm in a palace video. get the banana bread it's delicious.
2020-06-29,1,It's in a prime location so I had to try but I don't think I will try ever again. Their cappuccino was just unbelievably not tasty. Maybe it's just their milk or overall cappuccino making skills. There was literally no form. It tasted like a watered down coffee and some milk.
2020-02-19,4,I'm a regular! I work in Manhattan and stop here nearly every morning on my way in. The location makes for a seamless stop on the way into the city. My usual order is a hot coffee with a bit of almond milk and sometimes their GF, V banana bread. Pastries are tasty, staff is friendly and gets orders out fast, coffee is, in my opinion, delicious and the best option in the area.Only reason I gave four out of five stars is the to-go cups. Without fail, the coffee leaks all over me. Somehow, the lid just deposits coffee all over my hands and jacket. I've never had this problem before. It's bad enough that it sometimes deters me from stopping there, even though I love the coffee.
2019-10-12,5,Banana bread and over night oats from Joboken Cafe are my to go breakfast on most days. Big fan of their coffee and creative signs on black board outside!
2019-10-07,5,Amazing iced coffee! The cold brew is so refreshing and not the slightest bit acidic. The staff is friendly and prices are low too! Would come here daily if I lived closer.
2019-07-10,5,One of the best cold brews I've had. The banana bread was to die for.Nice quick service which is needed for a place near the train station.
2019-05-18,5,I very few requirements for a good coffee place. Joboken hits all of them: great brews, fast service, and friendly staff. Im sure it gets crazy packed on the weekday but I fought 0 line on a Saturday and enjoying the heck out of the cold brew. Their prices are also on par for any coffee place in NYC for sure. I will be sure to come back as, insider tip, I rent cars out of Hoboken and will need a caffeine fix to accompany my drives.
2019-04-29,5,Joboken is the cutest lil coffee shop with the cutest darn name. It is the perfect place to stop right before you hop on the path and head into work. The shop is small, but I have never experienced bad lines because the baristas are so good at getting your coffee to you asap. Skip the starbucks and head to Joboken!!
2019-03-20,5,I look forward to seeing Andrea and the rest of the very sweet friendly staff every morning. I'm always in and out in under two minutes and I like the homemade breakfast they offer, specifically the homemade seed/granola bar. Sometimes I go out of my way to come on weekends even though I don't need to go toward the path because the iced oat milk latte is that good & they always welcome my pup
2019-02-14,5,Andrea, the barista is simply amazing! Actually,  the whole staff is super friendly! Every morning I look forward to grab my "Joboken" coffee and get on with my day! The spot is so convenient and the pastry is fresh as well! I feel like grabbing coffee from Joboken is a routine now and talk to Andrea who is always in a great mood and makes customers  feel like she is your friend!  Love love!
2019-01-04,5,Every morning I start my day with the banana flax seed bread.  Today was by far the best yet, it is the perfect texture and moist. Although it is always very tasty, sometimes it is very dry. Keep making them just like today's batch on 01/04/2019. Thank you and Happy New Year!!!!!!!!!
2018-12-27,5,Convenience is a big thing for me when it comes to cafes. Theres no indoor seating but i think thats intentional. Its there for us busy commuters who just need a cup on their way to the path and for that its perfect. Staff is also super, super sweet. Its an intimate setting and when you go there enough, the staff really gets to know you and how you take your coffee. Coffee isn't the absolute best but everything else is perfect.
2018-12-05,5,I love everything about this coffee shop. The staff is super friendly, the coffee shop is so clean, great location, and I LOVE my hazelnut latte with skim milk.  Only thing is I wish they opened at 5am because I take the 538am train, nonetheless I'm always happy with coffee and the service
2018-10-30,4,The location is really convenient and it's the perfect place to pick up coffee in the morning before going to work. It is small, but really cute with outdoor seating.I ordered a small ginger-lemon tea and a chocolate croissant totaling to about $7, which is fair. I originally wanted the tea to be hot, but unfortunately the ginger lemon only comes in cold. The chocolate croissant was not toasted and honestly tasted average. I wish there were more food options, but for the small space, it can't be helped I guess. Adding something warm to the menu would be appreciated, especially with the cold weather coming up.This place is not AMAZING, but it's a cute and convenient cafe to grab a quick bite and drink before your commute.
2018-10-13,5,Great spot next to the path. The coffee is hands down one of the best in hoboken. Rather surprising considering the location but the lines are very reasonable. Highly recommend.
2018-08-17,5,Best coffee in town. Try the cold brew! This place is as authentic and convenient as it gets!
2018-06-29,4,Just to start off, the location is prime for us commuters! Before this place opened the only other option for coffee right next to the path was Dunkin...need I say more...The coffee is of quality (the prices definitely reflect this), and the whole milk super creamy and delicious. I also love that the Small and Large sized teas are priced equally--I appreciate the honesty there (after all, water is free!).Would give 5 stars, except the coffee is never actually reasonably filled up to the brim (a pet peeve of mine as an ex-barista) and my espresso shot has been burnt a couple of times. Other than that, a great addition to our town!
2018-05-24,2,The owner was rude and the coffee wasn't great. Wont be going back unless I'm desperate for a coffee before my commute!
2018-04-30,5,Very cute grab and go spot. I've been getting the hot matcha (hoping it warms up soon so I can try the iced version), tastes great and the service was super friendly.
2018-04-25,2,I wish I could give this place better rating because the cafe is cute and the staff is very friendly. Location is convenient as well as it's right next to Path station. No room for seating unfortunately.The coffee is average. Pastries are decent. I felt like the prices were high for what they are serving compared to similar cafes in Manhattan. There are a couple of better options within 2 blocks of this cafe so I'll recommend those.
2018-04-21,4,This cute little place is just right in front of the Path entrance in Hoboken. In my opinion the coffee is really good, but the sizes are small.
2018-04-17,4,I don't buy coffee every morning. But every now and again I like to order a cappuccino. I'd prefer to support local instead of going to Starbucks when possible. This morning I tried Joboken. The workers are super friendly and pleasant. The cappuccino was $3.75 and the cup was about 30% smaller than the cup that you get from Starbucks, more like an espresso cup... my immediate reaction was disappointment. After discussing this with coffee aficionado friends (which I am definitely not) they suggested that this is probably because the coffee/milk is better quality and it's the correct ratio of coffee and milk. For me though, someone who doesn't really know the difference... I was bummed at the small size. If you're super into coffee and have the refined palate of a barista, good on you! You'll probably love it. The coffee is tasty for sure and they have Balthazars pastries which are excellent. The coffee cup sizes are "normal sized" so if that's what you want you're in luck. But for specialty coffee drinks, if you're not a coffee aficionado and prefer cup size over quality (lol so I've been told), you may get more bang for your buck elsewhere...
2018-04-09,5,It's a teeny tiny place, super cute and great espresso. Outdoor seating only. It looks like they're still working out a lot of the kinks and details, but I don't hold it against them. They're a great addition to my morning commute.
