2021-10-21,2,The coffee here is good but the girls who work there don't pay attention to customer orders. I asked for decaf as I am very sensitive to caffeine but still enjoy the taste of coffee in the morning. I am currently sick to my stomach because the girl working there this morning 100% ignored my request and gave me caffeine even after I asked her again when handing me the cup "this is definitely decaf right?" and she said yes. I get very sick from caffeine to the point that it makes it beyond difficult for me to stay at work. This is the second time this happened at this location, except last time the other girl was nice enough to admit that she messed up and made me a new cup. I get it that it gets busy in the morning, but flat out lying that you gave me decaf is very wrong, especially when I am paying almost $5 for coffee. Obviously, I can never come back here because I can't trust the staff. The moral of the story is if you can only drink decaf... DO NOT GO HERE.
2021-08-12,5,Cute whole in the wall cafe with an actual vault as their fridge!! I've tried three drinks so far a Iced Dirty chai with oat milk which was okay not my favorite but that's because I'm not personally fond of spicy chais, the iced oat milk latte with lavender and rose which was my all time favorite that I used to get somewhere else but haven't been able to find those flavors anywhere until now!! If you love floral flavors and a nice dairy free iced drink I definitely recommend you try this. I also tried the iced coffee with caramel which was also amazing! The espresso is amazing in flavor and so is the iced coffee. If you're in the area you should definitely give this place a try you won't regret it. They also have pastries but I didn't try anything.
2021-07-03,5,so quaint and cozy! coffee is very tasty, with the perfect amount of sugar added. staff are really friendly as well!
2021-05-14,5,Bean Vault is the perfect grab-and-go coffee spot just around the corner from the Hoboken PATH station.My coffee order is the most basic (plain old drip coffee), but their brews are bold and strong which I really like. The have a variety of milk, sweetener and flavor options as well if that's what you fancy.I love that they have artwork for sale by local artists displayed.
2021-01-09,4,Tiny coffee spot that's right by the Hoboken path and Pier A park. I've walked by here so many times and just recently tried it today. I got a cappuccino and it tasted very good. Definitely one of the better coffee shops in downtown Hoboken area.
2020-06-06,5,Hidden gem in Hoboken...great coffee, great service, definitely a new go-to. A ton of different drink options and reasonably priced when compared to other coffee shops in the neighborhood. Love it!
2020-05-20,5,The nookiest of all the nooks! Bean Vault has been one of my favorite places to grab a cup of coffee before hopping on the path since I moved to Hoboken just over 4 years ago (going to take a step back and gasp about 4 years ago for a second...) Andddd back to Bean Vault! It's a cute little shop without any seating tucked away off the beaten path. Since Hoboken went into lockdown they are only open until noon Monday - Friday but the staff baristas greet me with a friendly faces when I visit. They have delicious coffee, lot's of sweet treats and a plethora of cute gifts. You'll love it. Remember: this is not the shop to go and sit and do work! But if you need a cup of amazing coffee to go, make sure you try this spot out.
2020-04-03,5,As of April 2, Bean Vault is open until noon, Monday to Friday. Today was my first visit. After my longest-ever stretch without espresso since the 90s I was thrilled for the life-sustaining jolt of the iced Americano. The large is really big. Today I was depressed at times, angry at others, as I contemplated my own circumstances as well as the selfishness, xenophobia and socio-economic conflicts that have been enhanced during our world crisis. But for the last three hours I haven't been tired. I'm not a planner but I'm glad I picked up an extra Ameiricano for tomorrow. Thank you for the great coffee and for being there, Bean Vault.
2020-03-29,5,For the past 5 years I have been going to Bean Vault Coffee. Hands down the best ice coffee in hoboken. The girls that work the counter always remember my order and always up beat even when it seems like they're working really hard!
2020-01-09,3,Bean Vault is definitely located off the main path. It'd be hard to come across unless you're looking for it. It's a pretty small shop with no seating. I generally look for coffee shops with seating because I like to work in them. But the decor inside is really cute with a rustic vibe.The coffee wasn't that great. I got a latte and it tasted like a cheap cup of coffee. The barista was really nice to us though. On another note, I have come here in the summer before for their lemonade and that is pretty tasty.
2019-10-04,2,Coffee quality is pretty good. However, there is no seating, the store is tiny. Also, the menu claims that "NJ Sales Tax is Included" in their price - which was a lie as I was still charged tax. Will not come back until that is rectified.
2019-08-24,4,It's a tiny spot, a speck really, and I only noticed it because for three days in a row, I was taking the PATH from Manhattan to Hoboken where my company's office building is on River Street. While I enjoyed the riverfront walk, on my last morning there, I made a detour onto Newark Street and found this coffee shop. Just a kiosk but a nice one embedded in a beautiful brick building. I just got a $2.85 Drip Coffee (photo: bit.ly/2ZlUcU9), and it was what I wanted, which was basically anything but Starbucks. But it indeed surpassed that modest threshold.COFFEE - 4 stars...locally roasted beans bring a nice richness to the brewAMBIANCE - 4 stars...no place to sit but it's a handsome walk-in closet, ideal for commutersSERVICE - 3.5 stars...certainly friendly enoughTOTAL - 4 stars...I'll take Hoboken...OK, not really but the coffee is fineRELATED - Lost in Jersey? I can't help ya but here's a collection of places I've visited and reviewed: bit.ly/2HnXQqD
2019-08-24,5,One of the best coffee spots in town and you must try Tom and Geri's cookies which are the best cookies  in town and they offer gluten free cookies and dope merchandise. No bathroom but very good music. My favorite drink is their Cortado in the fall or a nice cold brew in the summer. They get their coffee bean from Toby's estate. There is no bathroom  or seating but there is a pier down the block where you can enjoy the New York skyline . They accept cash or credit and have amazing snacks and BV merchandise, ask for Tara, Shanel, Katelyn, manager Gwendolyn for recommendations or love advice! They're hip and the dopest!
2019-08-18,1,The worst americano ever!!  I went this place on sunday afternoon to get an iced americano.  It was luck warm.  Not enough ice in it and it tasted like an old brewed coffee.  (I paid for an iced americano.)I asked for more ice just in case but i had to throw it away after I took a ship. I would never go back here again.  I am a coffee drinker and love to travel to find a good cafe.  This place was disappointing.  The worst coffee place ever.
2019-06-17,1,This is by far the most inconsiderate establishment ever. Order a tea and when given the tea I proceeded over to the sugar and milk station. I began to pour the agave into my tea and, I guess the establishment didn't bother to squeeze the top on properly so it all spilled into my tea, causing the tea to splash and burn my hand very badly. I stood there crying and no one acknowledged me. Only a customer, who ask if I was ok. This happened last week Tuesday, and when u reach out to the store to speak to the owner, they say that he's a cop and that he isn't there every day. I literarily can't even take a proper shower. My hand is burnt very badly.
2019-02-22,5,The staff at Bean Vault is so friendly and lovely. It is the perfect place to stop in the morning on my way to the PATH (it's SO close and convenient). It's pretty tiny, so not a great place to hang around and sit down (there is no seating) but the coffee is good and the baked goods are all delicious!
2019-02-22,2,Location is bizarre. Walked up into this place and it's small. I like that they had a decent amount of dairy free alternatives. This coffee is not great. We've had better. Ordered a latte and a caramel latte with almond milk to try. It was $6 for mine! Ridiculous! It was NOT WORTH IT. They actually charge 0.70 for almond milk and 0.60 for flavor! FOR FLAVOR! I will not return here. Never been to a coffee shop that charges for flavor. They don't even have cups or sleeves with their label on it. They're saving money on marketing even. No need to charge customers THAT much. I wish I could get my money back. We've had better coffee elsewhere. For that reason, I don't recommend this place. If you like just plain coffee, it's still expensive! Choc o Pain is much better.
2018-11-08,3,I gave Bean Vault three tries this month. The location is extremely convenient. It's on the way to work for me. However, the coffee was not my favorite. It tasted of acidic and bitter to me.  Not sure if this is how coffee is supposed to taste or if its just personal preference.
2018-07-25,5,Great cold brew and espresso drinks! The ladies who work here are what make this place though--they're super friendly and sweet (always have a smile and a kind word) and they HUSTLE...really efficient, fast service! Love that they display and sell local artists pieces and they always play dope music!
2018-07-05,2,We were early to meet my cousin in Hoboken for brunch, so we decided to stop for some coffee at Bean Vault. They seemed to have pretty good reviews on Yelp, so I thought hey, why not.Staff was friendly and we were in and out pretty quickly. Prices were reasonable. However, the cold brew that we all got was so-so in my opinion. It was so bitter that I had to add agave to my coffee, which I never do. I never, ever put any sugar in my coffee - not for the past 5 years or so. I'm not sure I'll be back the next time that I'm in the area.
2018-07-03,1,Horrifyingly acidic coffee!Eight of us went and only those who got the lattes sort of finished, and the rest of us threw our coffees out. I guess nome of us enjoyed the acidic, medicine-like coffees.I am very confused by the rest of the good reviews; I am willing to try again and update my review in the future. Hopefully, we just chose a wrong day.
2018-07-02,5,My wife loves this place and I finally tried some on our way home, even though I'd had 3 or so different cups or shots of coffee. It was quite good! They have a really solid cup of drip and pour over coffee, and single origin beans. I was impressed. I'd passed this place often and never noticed it was there, until my wife pointed it out as her daily coffee stop. Even though we make espresso at home in the morning before her daily commute into her office in Hoboken. It's another one of those places you have to stop in and try their varieties. Where you can see real baristas at work in their craft.
2018-06-22,4,Small no seating but good for quick grab and go.  I got cold brew w/shot of vanilla and cream per request.  Was good, need to return for espresso drink since barista seemed experienced.
2018-04-24,5,Bean Vault Coffee is definitely one of the best coffee shops around hoboken. This coffee shop offers a variety of drinks, but most importantly, they offer pour overs! Ranging from single origin beans to beans that are blended together from different regions. If you are a coffee lover definitely try their pour overs. The baristas take their time and care in insuring that you have the best coffee experience. Also, don't forget to try their cold brew! I've been to a bunch of coffee shops around hoboken, their cold brew is definitely the strongest and most consistent in taste and quality.
2018-04-20,4,This coffee shop is a touch above when I compare it to any other Coffee places in New Jersey. They use beans from Joe coffee in NYC. Which already makes this quite special. I took one star away from this place because they don't have a wide variety of pastries. Or at least not that appetizing. But as far as coffee is concerned, it's awesome.
2018-03-16,4,Great coffee! High prices and no seating area... but that's common these days right?I got a hazelnut caramel latte for $5 from here this morning and it was pretty good. The cookie jars weren't labeled and I was confused about whether they were self-serve, so I skipped... Wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, but I'd visit if I were really close by.
2017-12-10,5,The service is just as awesome as the coffee! Highly recommend this cute and cozy coffee shop right near the beautiful Hudson River.
2017-11-05,5,I've been here a handful of times for a cup of coffee. I love it here! The staff is very friendly, and I've never had a coffee here that I didn't love. Definitely check them out and then walk down to the water and enjoy! Heads up: it's a small little place with no seating so not somewhere you can do work or hang out
2017-10-19,4,Coffee wasn't that great. Very foamy. BUT the pastries I bought (cheese puff and chocolate chip cookie) were amazing. The shop is very cute. Love that they sell art and little things in there.
2017-10-19,5,Cute cozy coffee shop. Great location - right beside the Hudson river bank and there is a nice common area nearby. Coffee was good too. I got a jumbo size iced latte. Tasted good. Will come again if I visit the river bank region again.
2017-09-01,4,I always come this cafe because the tea is great...and the staff there as well. I give it a 4 star and not a five cause the owner Justin could learn something from his staff...when engaging with his cousmer. So I'm in the shop sitting as always having my tea and outside was a little bit chilly so the door was closed cuz to keep the heat in. He came in and kept the door open. so I didn't realize that he was the owner for the cafe...so I simply say can you please close the door the other customer reach over and close the door. He replied "no leave that door open" I said its cold that's why I'm asking for it to close. So I asked jis employe to him to close the door. She replied " no I can't because he is the owner". So I said excuse me and try to get his attention just asking if you can push it in half way he looked at me turn his back on when an open the door wider and said no so then I have no choice but to take is it because I'm on the black woman who sitting in your coffee you disregard what I'm requesting would you have listened to me what I was trying to say if I was white. These services and continue to exist but my god when your loyal customer you think you'll be treated very pleasant from the staff which I do but then to expect to be treated like a piece of s*** because you're black from the unit is very sad. I recommend a place because it is good to coffee is good it's very expensive but the stuff are good and the staff are very pleasant.  I won't recommend a place because he should not give services and your money to people that who disregard people of color or any other nationality if you're not white. I have businesses and organization and I do not treat anyone that contribute to pocket differently no matter what race they are. I know when he probably look at me probably looking to see a black girl sitting there was not up to his part to get his attention even though I try to reach out to him and try to speak to him to maybe apologize for coming on so strong about closing the door. @BeanVaultCoffe.
2017-09-01,5,Their regular drip coffee is great here and the iced hibiscus tea is amazing! Both strong in flavor, not watered down.
2017-08-02,4,WOW..... This is a very small place with parking IFFFF you win the NJ Lottery and actually gind street parking. The espresso was "good" but didnt blow me away
2017-07-23,5,The coffee here is always so good. Way better than any of the chains, and I love one of my specific chains. The staff here is extremely friendly and helpful and their assortment of healthy snacks and treats is impressive. I love their loyalty program and the music they play on the sidewalk too. Shop small and give this place a chance - you won't regret it! (Favorite is their cold brew and the Om Sweet Om muffins.)
2017-06-15,3,I don't see the hype. Walked past this place yesterday and it smelled amazing but I didn't have time to get anything. Came back today and got a green tea latte with almond milk. The ladies ringing me up and making my drink seemed very uninterested, mostly the one making my drink. I don't blame the lady ringing me up for being annoyed bc the customer before me could not figure out how to pay, she was legit paying with pennies or something and taking forever it was even annoying me. I saw the lady making my green tea latte and I could see they didn't have enough matcha powder, she even made a comment under her breath about not having enough - didn't they have more elsewhere? She ended up giving me less than a scoop of the matcha powder and mixed with the almond milk. I basically paid $5 for a small steamed almond milk with a hint of matcha powder. Not worth it.
2017-06-11,5,This coffee spot is my go to for cold brew! The large coffees are actually large and the staff is very friendly.
2017-05-29,3,First time visiting Hoboken and I wandered into this place. The coffee shop is quaint and warm. I ordered a small ice soy latte. ($5)I got my order in less than 60 seconds. My latte had a cigarette after taste and it only had 1 shot of espresso. It was like drinking just soy milk. I won't be trying this place again.
2017-04-20,4,Staff were very friendly and explained why this coffee and their menu was unique! Their waffle was probably one of the densest waffles I've tried and super sweetChai latte is one of my favoritesThe iced milo was pretty great!- Ice cream in hot chocolate! Cons: no wifi and only one outlet available I think it'd be great if they had some purse/jacket hooks under the tables
2017-04-16,4,Very helpful baristas. Came in for coffee, left with that and hot sauce. Like the variety of other items available.
2017-04-02,4,This place is super tiny but simple. A good decent brew with snacks around that fits all types of allergies and diets. I recently took home a bar of their soap. Though I can't routinely buy handmade or organically crafted items, I like to0 at times, as well as support a small business. The staff was relaxed in waiting for me to make a decision. Place was upbeat and had a great coffee menu. They accept card, which means the world to me, and should be the norm in 2017 now, despite the charge minimum. ( I'm a business owner and believe that) this place is right off the station, near hoboken little school, and is crazily near the Starbucks off of Newark ave , I believe. I would say that both have great food, but a cup of simple coffee is okay here.
2016-12-15,5,This place converted me after a decade-long Starbucks addiction. I was fed up with the wait times at the downtown Hoboken Starbucks so stopped by Bean Vault on my way to the path one day, and now go every single day. The coffee is fantastic (I always get a latte). The women who work there on weekday mornings are AMAZING--friendly, fun and somehow have every person's drink order memorized and are ready with your drink in two minutes even when the place is packed. LOVE!
2016-11-10,3,Four stars for the espresso-based drinks and friendly service.  More like three stars for the drip coffee, and the lack of seating as the tie-breaker brings it down to three overall.The espresso-based drinks I've had here have consistently been good. Macchiatos (which lack milk and therefore expose any weaknesses in shot-pulling) have been very good, as have the lattes, which are always capped with thick layers of properly micro-foamed milk.  The regular (drip) coffee isn't quite up to that standard.  It's decent, but I prefer the french-pressed coffee at City of Saints uptown, as well as (dare I say it) Starbucks' brew.The Tom & Geri cookies they have are tasty and massive, and at $4, I guess they should be.  More than I'd really want to eat in one sitting, but your mileage may vary.  Prices are on the high side ($5 for a latte) for a place that's so small / presumably has lower rent & overhead costs.  Finally, there's no seating at all.  Fine on a nice weather day, or if you're getting it to go, but this is not a place to come and linger.
2016-09-21,4,This is the BEST coffee place in Hoboken, and quite frankly the ONLY place. I come here on a regular basis, and I have to say everything I've had here is on point. Their drip coffee is solid and their treats are super tasty. When I'm really wanting to treat myself, I get the pour over which is filled with amazingness that will get you through ANY type of day. Basically, therapy in a cup. Yesterday, I had their green tea latte and it was amazing! I also love that they substitute all kinds of milk, especially almond milk. Yummmmm. Yes it can get a bit pricey, but I am a New Yorker and I'd much rather pay a few extra dollars for quality A+ coffee. I would never settle for anything else. If you're lucky, sometimes they give out free samples by the PATH station ;) Looking for amazing coffee in Hoboken? Look no further. You've found the place.
2016-08-26,5,Just the cutest grab and go for your cup of joe! Everyone working there is so sweet and the coffee is amazing!
2016-08-14,4,I loved walking down to this little place every morning when I stayed in Hoboken! It's near the water, and a really pleasant walk. The coffee is great- the baristas are pros. There are some great menu items, as well as a small selection of bakery items and treats.
2016-08-02,5,Seriously the best coffee shop I've visited. Hoboken is lacking in the coffee scene, but even if there were a million coffee shops, this place would still be the best. The staff is friendly and fast, the coffee amazing, and the music they play is ridiculously amazing. Makes the morning commute start out that much better!
2016-08-01,5,This place is awesome! Placed near the waterway front and near the Hoboken child care center. It really is a fantastic location to go to coffee. I got the green tea latte iced and my husband got a iced coffee with a double espresso shot, both larges. Ours came out to be about 12.00. Reasonable since it lasted us the whole waterway walk. My iced green tea latte was good, so good. Nice matcha flavor, creamy but not overpowering. Loved the iced part since it was so sticky today.
2016-07-29,4,A great coffee shop right near the PATH, waterfront, Post Office, NYSC, etc. -such a convenient location. I've been here a few times now and it's not just the coffee that keeps me from coming back, but also the service and atmosphere of this hole in the wall place. No matter the time of day you can find Bean Vault Coffee playing some classic Motown, hip hop and classic rock tunes through their window. The staff is always incredibly friendly, and if you're a regular here, the baristas for sure know your order as soon as you walk in the door. The coffee is great, and I believe they use Toby Estate beans. The prices are pretty average for a NYC cup of coffee (between $3-$5) depending on what you get. All in all, a great cafe to order coffee to go. Next time I'm here I'll have to try a specialty drink, but the cold brew is always addicting.
2016-06-30,4,Had a great cappucino and sat on the waterfront,  Great vibe, great service and wonderful coffee.  Perfect compliment to the view. Will go back!.
2016-06-28,5,Cute little coffee shop near the path! Way better than Starbucks...No seating which is the downside...but just walk over to a bench on the water 100 feet away and enjoy the NYC skyline!
2016-06-28,5,I don't go here enough! I've gotten the cold brew, regular coffee, espresso, and a soy latte once or twice and everything is great! The best thing about this place is the people though. The folks behind the bar are always super friendly. Prices are on par with any coffee shop. If you're gonna spend $5 on one, might as well be a local business right? The area inside is a little tight, but it's got a nice vibe and ambiance. I've never felt too crowded in there.
2016-06-07,4,I wasn't that impressed by the hot chocolate-- it was a bit too milky for my liking-- but the coffee here is phenomenal.
2016-05-25,4,this section of Hoboken has been somewhat lacking in good coffee for quite a while since Chock Full o' Nuts closed. what's around here, off the top of my head: Starbucks (NO), a Dunkin that I'll hit up as a last resort, and delis with unreliable coffee. I think that's finally been remedied.it's a small place - but the staff are cheerful, work efficiently, and make some damn fine coffee. I've actually only had espresso and espresso-based drinks here, but they've never let me down.  disregard the fact that I only have one Yelp check-in; I sometimes rush in and out so fast I forget to check in!the baked desserts always look good, but I've yet to try them.Bean Vault is my new go-to spot when I need a caffeine fix after getting off the PATH train.
2016-05-09,5,Love this place! The best soy latte anywhere!! I don't even usually like soy lattes but here it is so nutty and flavorful, you will find yourself craving it when you are anywhere in the vicinity.  I think I finally felt like a New Yorker after ordering a 'small iced decaf soy latte'....uhhhh, how many adjectives is that? well, more than i usually use. yeah. but it was sooooo good.  And it being a beautiful Spring day, I decided to splurge on some desserts (that were supposed to last a few days, but are sadly half gone....how did that happen?): got the 'tom and geri' (the owner's father i'm told makes them) AMAZING gigantic chocolate chip walnut cookies: towering, and when you bite into them, the cross section of layers of chocolate chips and cookie dough is so intricate and layered: it's like a 7layer cake but layers of cookie dough/walnut/chocolate chip yumminess!  It has a bit of salt that counteracts the sweet.  Justine's bicotti's are to die for: I tried the coconut:  wow!!  I was not surprised to learn she is filipino: seriously, they have mastered baked goods...I was just having this discussion earlier with a filipino friend who is a mad good baker. Finally, the everything free muffin (gluten free, vegan, soy free, gmo free, organic) ... I will admit, i was skeptical, but it was also delicious: pumpkin spice flavored and satisfying.  so what makes it so good?  i need to read the ingredients next time. good to know there is a gluten free dessert option that's tasty and satisfying!
2016-04-17,5,I've tried different kinds of espresso(cappuccino/latte/americano)  and coffee! Taste great and people here were nice too.
2016-03-26,4,Hands down the best coffee in Hoboken! Tasty, strong and some great music playing as you walk in. Lattes are good but the simple hot or cold brew are simply awesome.
2016-03-13,3,This place might be hard to find if it weren't always blaring music for the whole block to hear.  The place itself is a bit of a closet, so there's no seating, but with the Hoboken waterfront so close, it's not that necessary.  The Hoboken train station/PATH is close too, so it's great to stop by if you're coming in/out of the city.  The basic coffee is great, and they mix it up with festive and seasonal drinks.  Prices are high, but hey--even in a closet, you have to pay that Hoboken rent somehow!
2016-02-03,5,Lovely staff, delicious coffees, heavenly treats accompanied by great tunes--sometimes you have to linger until the song finishes. The Bean Vault is a Hoboken Oasis. Cheers!
2016-01-25,4,Great spot for coffee right near the Hoboken PATH station.  Small store but very lively spot - music always going, and in the warmer weather the music drifts out of their open door and cheers up the block-radius.Staff is always friendly and cheerful, and drinks always seem to be prepared with care - plus you don't get that "assembly line" feel like at a Starbucks or DD.Definitely worth a visit!
2015-12-03,4,It's nice to finally have a good coffee place in Hoboken. The coffee is always great and the people working there are cool and very friendly. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because I feel like they might be outgrowing their location and staff size. The last time I was in their store I ordered a pour-over that took about 10 minutes to prepare because of all the people they were trying to serve. I think a bigger & better location and larger staff would really do the trick. But other than that, this place is great!
2015-11-02,5,Tiny place a bit tucked away from the Hoboken Terminal, this place is worth hunting down. Cold brew is on point and the lattes are delicious. This is a wonderful in and out place but don't expect to set up shop here- there is zero seating. But if you're looking for a caffeine jolt on the go, don't pass this place up.
2015-09-30,5,This is my favorite coffee shop in Hoboken, hands down. I come here every morning and it makes the day so much better. Besides the awesome coffee, the staff and awesome music bring a smile to my face even when I'm dragging at 7am. Thank you!
2015-09-27,4,Great spot with great coffee and locally baked goods. Only minor problem is that there's nowhere to sit in the shop itself. Fortunately (and I'm sure the owners built the place with this in mind) there is an abundance of waterfront benches within yards of the shop itself which creates a very desirable place to enjoy your coffee, but it's still nice to sit in a cafe on a rainy day. Overall, I highly recommend this coffee shop!
2015-09-26,5,So happy to have quality coffee right off the path. This is my new happy place. It's nice to have local non chain options. Good vibe. Highly recommend. No seating if you need a work space but awesome in/out option.
2015-09-18,2,Capuucinos are Latte have this "Feel the Burn" taste lately.May be baristas needs to be trained more or bean supplier could be changed Maybe its me ..What do I know right?When you pay $4 for a Latte which costs max.$.90 cents you have a right to ask for more..
2015-09-15,4,One line verdict: Stick to the coffee. Avoid the lemonade. The coffee is phenomenal. Especially love their latte. Always on point, strong and not too diluted.Tried the lemonade (both lavender and strawberry) a couple of times over the summer and was disappointed. It was way too sugary and syrup-y. Ladies - please use real lemon and less sugar syrup next summer. The staff is really nice and welcoming. And the location is great...grab a coffee...hit the waterfront. Perfect.
2015-08-12,1,I was excited to try this place since I was in the area. I love supporting smaller business over big chains. Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed. The place is really cute...small but that didn't bother me because I just wanted a good cup of cold brew. It would've been nice to have been greeted with a tiny smile. The girl who took my order looked like she hated being there (at least fake it for a minute). She gave me my change with singles to obviously leave a tip (which I was going to anyway), but I didn't even get a quiet thank you after putting the only bill in the tip jar that only had loose pocket change. I took a sip and thought the flavor was a little off/acidic, but thought maybe that's just their coffee.  I didn't even realize until I was already in my car and a couple of blocks away and looked at the bottom of my cup, that the soy milk was spoiled. Yeah, soy might settle to the bottom after a while but it should NOT have curdled balls at the bottom of my cup. I should've taken a picture but was so grossed out, I threw out my $5 large cold brew. Fail. I could've forgiven the lack of friendly service if the coffee had been made well. Correction, maybe the cold brew was really great but since the milk was bad, I wouldn't know.
2015-08-03,5,BEST COFFEE IN HOBOKEN!Cold Brew is a must!Staff is so friendly and the vibe is perfect.Also great music, chill and inviting vibe.I've had their drip coffee too and its great also. I'll be trying more of the hot options when the colder months come! For now, I'll stick to the cold brew with Almond Milk. YUMMM
2015-07-31,5,Probably the best coffee in Hoboken! In fact possibly one of the best coffees around... Be sure to stop in and get their flat white a strong latte in a smaller cup. Basically a no-frills coffee shop with a few good baked treats on the side including some gluten free.
2015-07-25,5,Just had a life-changing Arnold Palmer iced tea with Bean Vault's signature lavender lime syrup. I'll have a hard time drinking normal iced tea again. even my own recipe tea. Wow!
2015-07-13,5,This place is a bright spot in my work day.They:feature Toby's Estate coffee from Brooklynmake a really good iced latte with almond milk (.50 extra).have pour over coffee if that's your thing.The people who work here are upbeat and very nice. The last time I went there, the music blasting on the stereo was Tears for Fears, "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" and Run-DMC's "It's Tricky". What more could I ask for?
2015-06-30,4,A tiny shop shoehorned onto a street corner near the water, this place is simple. Want good coffee? Want good pastries? Otherwise don't waste your time. The coffee options are vast and caffeinated. The Tom and Geri cookies are the size of your head and lovely. Give the chocolate macaroon a try too.
2015-06-21,3,A nice refreshing iced latte made the walk along the Hudson even more relaxing. The barista was fast and attentive and because it's a smaller place only one person was working behind the counter. You never felt that he was frazzled or impatient. A quality bigger chains should recognize and try to emulate. Next time we're in hoboken I'm definitely going to make a stop.
2015-06-20,5,Not only does this little shop have delicious coffee (Toby's Estate), awesome employees who memorize your order within the week, and great music playing everyday, they also have a punch card (buy 10 get one free)!
2015-06-03,4,Great selection of drinks and sweets. I LOVE that they have Stumptown coffee, too. The customer service is always on point here.
2015-06-03,5,Great coffee and simple pastry from Baltazar and great service. Unique setting  a bit hidden but worth the find!
2015-05-20,3,I've given this place a chance three times now, and it kind of gave me the feeling of just Meh... I really wanted to love this place. One time I just wanted a plain latte, it was too milky and cannot taste the coffee. The next time I wanted a vanilla latte, and it was still very milky. I want to taste the coffee and they cannot find the balance between the milk and the coffee -- I realize a latte comprises of milk and coffee, but it doesn't have to be too milky. So the third time, I just wanted a coffee, plain and simple. The coffee was too tangy and not strong. I know it could be due to the beans they used that day, but it wasn't very good. I will update my review once I give it another try.
2015-05-12,2,Let me just say that the coffee is great. It's delicious, I love it, and I don't even mind paying $2.35 for a small. However, I'm giving this place only 2 stars for the following reasons:1) The cups consistently leak. I used to think that I was crazy when I looked down and saw drips of coffee on my hand and clothes and figured that I must have spilled it. But no, the issue is that the tops of the cups do not form a perfect seal around the cups, so some coffee always comes over the top, is not blocked by the lid, and drips down the side of the cup. This could be caused by cups that are slightly disfigured (stretched out or uneven), or by lids that are not specially made to fit the cups. I have never, ever had this problem with cups from Starbucks. 2) The layout of the store itself is inefficient. The milk, sugar, and other toppings are crammed into the window area, where really only one person can fit at a time. So wait in line behind someone who orders some crazy drink, then wait behind that same person while the slowly fix up their drink by the window.I love the staff and the coffee, but please fix these issues.
2015-04-26,5,Great coffee! Great service! If you are a coffee lover nothing else need to be said!Lastly, this place is dog friendly!
2015-04-24,3,I came here twice... both times I ordered the lavender honey latte.  The first time was fairly decent, but the second time was disappointing... and no latte art during both visits .. =(
2015-04-13,5,Disclaimer: I love the smell of coffee but hate the taste. So for a tea drinker this place was a wonderful surprise. Even on the coldest days they offer two iced tea options. Lemon black tea which is excellent, and a mango tropical that is my fav as it isn't watered down and has a nice slightly spicy after taste. Their steamed chai is some of the best I've had. Hot chocolate was good to the last drop with no cruddy sludge left behind. Nice and creamy and not too sweet. I try to steer clear of the pastries but on my weaker days I've been happy to indulge. The apple cinnamon being my favorite. I don't think they are made in house as it's such a teeny spot but they are always fresh. The staff are super friendly and always happy to answer questions. This has become my morning stop between the train station and my office.
2015-03-30,4,Stopped in on a Saturday late morning before hopping on the PATH. I'll admit I usually hit up the chains on my walk to the PATH mostly due to familiarity and convenience but I thought Bean Vault would be a nice change. And that it was. Coffee menu is concise but with all the favorites (drip, latte, cappuccino, macchiato, etc.). I opted for a drip coffee ($2.25). There's the usual table of fixings which had a variety of milk and sweeteners as well as some sugar-free options behind the counter. My coffee was smooth but bold and exactly what I was looking for. The space itself is very tight - not a place to sit and savor, just grab and go - but the service was very friendly and quick.
2015-03-15,5,BVC got the Best Chai latte & coffees in the town... The barista's make you the perfect taste... Cheers to BVC
2015-03-02,5,Always friendly staff, amazing coffee. I can always count on going to this place when I want something delicious and different. I also enjoy that they keep expanding what they offer, they always have yummy deserts and snacks. Their sweet drinks aren't overloaded with sugar either. All in all my favorite coffee place in the area. I'm sad when I can't be in Hoboken all the time!
2015-02-14,5,Great coffee and service! Good place to stop before getting on the path. Lots of gift ideas to for the hard to find person.
2015-02-08,5,I love this place. It's for serious coffee drinkers but their setup and service is humble enough for anyone who got lost on their way to S****ucks.I have had almost everything at Bean Vault. I regularly drink their plain coffee, but I have tried their espresso and tea drinks and love them too! I also buy their bagged coffee beans because I am now hooked on Toby's coffee! Their service is also amazing. All of the employees have been so friendly and helpful. I've never had a single bad experience! Their location is small, but cozy and filled with great music and art.Their baked goods are great, but once I tried the chocolate chip-walnut cookie- I haven't really gone back to try anything else. It's super pricey, but absolutely worth it. It is the closest thing Hoboken has to a Levain bakery cookie. :)Bottom line- Bean Vault is the best coffee place is Hoboken.  My only complaint is that it's far from my apartment!
2015-02-06,4,I like this place. Great staff, easy fun vibe, etc. I will say the drip coffee is 4 star (good not great), but overall the place is a wonderful, local, cafe. I don't have anything against Starbucks in general, but it is a chain. Go to your local!
2015-01-21,2,I know I'm a coffee snob and all, but this place really didn't do it for me. I went here one rainy day with a couple of friends (maybe the bad weather biased my mood?). Anyway, I ordered a cortado but I could barely taste the espresso. It was very milky and the milk was too hot. I can't remember if they automatically serve double shots every time like in NY or if they are single shots. I hope it was just a single shot considering I couldn't taste it. The place is very, very small so it's more of a grab your coffee and go kind of place. This didn't work out well for us as we were waiting for our other friend to get there. I was just so disappointed after seeing all these good reviews. Overall, I do not recommend this place. Not one bit.
2015-01-19,5,LOVE this coffee shop!  It is a small spot near the Path train and is just for picking up to-go coffee.  They also have small snacks including vegan/soy free/gluten free treats.  Have almond milk and soy and I don't think they charge extra for those milks.  The cappuccino is absolutely delicious every time.  In my opinion it is better than Red Lion and even Bwe.  Perhaps the best thing about this shop is the excellent staff.  I had a baby in September 2014 and have been going here at least three days a week since then.  You cannot easily bring a stroller into the shop, because there are two stairs leading up to the entrance and all I have to do is open the door and they know my order.  The girl at the counter comes to take my money/punch card and then returns with the coffee.  It's a small gesture, but very much appreciated because I would not be able to go here with the baby if they didn't do this for me.   (Of course, I make a point to go when it's not busy so they don't have to waste time waiting on me while people are waiting in line).  I live next to the Red Lion uptown, but will continue to walk downtown for this coffee!
2015-01-16,4,So refreshing to see Toby's estate coffee in hoboken!! I love this place and it's so cute inside. There's no seating but I get coffee on my way to work so it's perfect location too.
2015-01-15,5,Tucked away on a side street near the Hoboken Path, the tiny Bean Vault is one of my favorite coffee spots in Hoboken. Here's why:I enjoy the Toby's estate coffee that they serve. I love the small selection of "local" snacks they carry, especially A&I Nutritreats which are made right in Hoboken. The girls that work there are awesome. Always friendly and give me service with a smile.
2015-01-07,5,Bean Vault is easily my favorite coffee spot in Hoboken and honestly, anywhere I've ever been. The people are friendly, the vibe is great...and oh yeah the coffee is ridiculously awesome. There's always great tunes playing and the shop is filled with local art of things around Hoboken. In my mind, that's great because it shows some pride of where the shop is. Everyone who works there is beyond friendly and always has a smile on their face as well.  The latte and cold brew are where it's at. Despite a lack of sitting space, I've taken everyone I know here. Whether it's a date, friends or family...I've converted them all to Bean Vault. It's also slightly tucked away on Newark Street which is both good and bad. I wish it was in an area where more people would just walk in, but it might not be the same then. Judging on the owners and employees though, I doubt that would be true because as I mentioned...everyone is really friendly. In the morning, it's a quick operation...I'm in and out in 2 minutes no matter what I get. Long story short, check this spot out. You will thank me later!
2015-01-05,4,I stop here for a latte more often than I should. The coffee is prepared well and with care. I cannot say enough good things about the delicious selection of muffins! It isn't cheap, but it's not out of line. The staff is friendly and they have always given me an excellent cup of coffee!To respond to the comment below: hi! You have a great shop! I think the cappuccino muffin is my favorite probably but the one with cranberry is also quite nice. I stumbled across a lavender latte elsewhere the other day and wonder if bean vault might consider the addition to the menu? Either way I will of course continue to stop in!
2014-12-22,4,Great artisan coffee shop downtown in the most charming location. It's right by the terminal which makes a very convenient location. Barista was friendly and knowledgable. My latte was bolder than what I'm used to but still good. No seating but I'm more of a grab & go type of gal. I was slightly disappointed that they don't serve breakfast sandwiches.
2014-11-27,5,My favorite coffee spot in town. Locally owned and cared for. I love stopping here in the mornings on my way to work. The quality of snack and coffee is top notch. They have some interesting flavors and everything is authentic. They even make their pumpkin flavored items from actual pumpkin puree, not some syrupy crap. Tips: - They have every kind of milk you could ever need, coconut, almond, soy, etc. - They have a coffee club so every 10 cups you get a free one!
2014-11-21,5,Great coffee, friendly staff.  Support local Hoboken businesses!  They have a spiced pumpkin latte
2014-11-15,5,Let me just start by saying I drink A LOT of coffee.. walked into this place to have my third cup at around 5 pm with a friend. We had a pumpkin spice latte a "cold brew".  Both were equally awesome! The cold brew was smooth and flavorful without milk or sugar and strong like a regular hot coffee usually is but iced! The pumpkin spice latte was perfect as well.. not too sweet or syrupy like other pumpkin flavored coffee drinks. I don't particularly like pumpkin flavor but I think this one is my new favorite. Definitely recommend it!
2014-10-26,5,BVC serves up the best tasting coffee in Hoboken by FAR.  Not only is it in a charming location, it really has the feel of an artisan coffee house.  I stopped in this morning for a quick pre-jets-game brew and Albert crafted my Americano to perfection.  He is easily my favorite local barista; efficient behind the bar, delightful to chat with, and made sure I had everything I needed.  Bean Vault Coffee is my go to! Thanks Albert & BVCEdeana & Brian
2014-10-23,5,This place is AWESOME and the pumpkin spice poison is THE best coffee I've ever had.Not to mention the fantastic customer service provided by Albert
2014-10-22,5,Nice local coffee shop. Good coffee and friendly staff. They take credit cards via an iPad square app. They offer every variety of milk (soy, almond, Etc) and sweetener (agave, Splenda, etc). Be sure to get a stamped reward card.
2014-10-14,4,Love the coffee at this place!! Was tired of the Starbucks stuff I was having, all of them had started tasting the same. You can actually taste the coffee and the flavoring in your latte. The price is slightly higher than Starbucks and it's a really small place in an alley in Hoboken. Had the caramel latte and the black & white latte(white and regular chocolate) paid  $9 for both.
2014-09-19,5,Best Pumpkin Spice Latte!!  They actually make the pumpkin spice mix from scratch w/ real pumpkin puree.  If you want to drink a ton of artificial chemicals go to Starbucks. If you want a delicious & healthy version of the PSL go here to the Bean Vault! They're even pet friendly!  Will be back soon!
2014-09-18,5,My favorite coffee in Hoboken- the lattes with almond milk are to die for. It's a bit expensive, but worth the splurge every once in a while. The service is great- they're always so nice and speedy!
2014-09-16,4,Toby's Estate brewed here. They're obviously doing something right here. With a tiny, no seats, cafe and with one barista they surprisingly dish out "specialty coffee" pretty darn quickly. except of course if you get a pour over in which case you gotta wait. Essential considering their location, right next to the Path train. My boyfriend is guilty of asking the barista too many questions, he gets like that sometimes. The barista answers them fairly quickly, giving him his coffee with a dash of sass. I like it. I like it. I like it like that. Prime location to grab a latte or pour over if you're taking a stroll in Hoboken. I like it by the water. And now you know.
2014-09-13,5,The coffee is great--wide selection of milk/sugar (clearly I'm not a real coffee drinker). But what impressed me the most is the service. I was walking with my dog and baby and stopped in to get coffee. Usually, stores don't allow dogs (which I get), so I secured him right outside the store with my stroller and took my infant daughter in. They immediately said I could bring him in and after my purchase, one of the baristas volunteered to watch my dog while I put my daughter back in her stroller and put sugar in my coffee. Was very impressed by their thoughtfulness. Thank you for a lovely experience!
2014-09-04,4,This is where my work day starts.  Love Al, Wendy and the crew always service with a smile.  The shop has a great vibe, and the coffee is, dear I say, the best in Hoboken!
2014-08-25,1,Came inside... No hellos? No welcome? Alright this is what happens when you don't welcome your customers.My girlfriend and I went inside this place since the reviews said that their coffee was amazing. Well not really.MY girlfriend ordered a capuccino and I ordered, like always, an espresso shot(you really can tell if a place serves good coffee if they can make a great espresso shot).BOTH BAD.Also, this store had the ambience of a friends club rather than a coffee place. The baristas and cashiers were more involved in their own conversations than their wandering customers.This place needs workers and good coffee.Because I did not have my great cup of espresso... I was rather sad #FWP.
2014-08-11,5,Best cup of coffee ever. I never new coffee could be so good. I have been drinking watered down,burnt and stale coffee and now I know better. These beans and not just freshly ground they use freshly roasted beans. What a difference.
2014-08-10,5,Bean Vault Coffee is among the best coffee I've ever had, if not the best. I've visited this gem only twice and found the service to be absolutely outstanding on both occasions. I actually met both of the proprietors separately, both of whom referred to each other as "my buddy." On my first visit, I walked in shyly, uncertain of the welcome (or distaste) I'd be met with. Boy, was I in for a treat. Café crawling, as it's called, has become a new hobby of mine and I'm drawn to capturing the perfect shot to encapsulate my experiences. The wood floors are a gorgeous two-toned parquet (I think?). On the ceiling are twin Restoration Hardware light fixtures that I'd ironically seen in store and marveled over. The walls have shelving to hold various sundries: t-shirts, etc. Of course, a gleaming espresso machine is perched behind the counter, among other brewing apparatuses. There are quite a few displays that encase some of the best accompaniments to a coffee, ever. They have scones, cookies, and the like. All are delicious, fresh, and worth the dough.The guys at BVC encouraged me to go behind the counter to get my much-sought-after winning picture! I was so taken aback! Still timid but with burgeoning giddiness, I declined and said I'd already got it. The gregarious owner gave me some stickers and in true, genuine Hoboken style said, "Have some stickers, stick 'em places." Gladly, I took them and put them to use. Our barista was kind, attentive, and handsome. What more could you want? The lattes were ready in an extremely timely fashion and the casual small talk made waiting all the more of a pleasure. BVC is truly the sole place to go for a damn good caffeine fix. The coffee is spectacular and the atmosphere is very relaxed, no pretense or punches pulled. My lattes were creamy, rich, ultra-satisfying, all while alluring me to waltz on over and order another.My second visit was just as pleasant, as I met the other proprietor. He was extremely warm and was patient with the extensive "staging" for my picture. He seem delighted to hear that I'd already found them on all social media platforms and planned to write this review.  I urged my mom (my companion for most of my trips) to get a hot coffee this time, as nothing beat the latte I had had previously.  She ultimately savored hers but I couldn't resist finishing it within minutes.  We said our goodbyes and exited the little one-room café. By the end of our transaction, I felt as though we'd become happily well-acquainted with the guys at Bean Vault.Did I mentioned we traveled an hour to visit again a week after our first visit? Cause we did.
2014-07-30,4,This is our new favorite coffee shop in Hoboken. The coffee is great and we Love the laid back atmosphere! The baristas are great and really know their coffee!
2014-07-20,5,I was just walking through Hoboken and stopped to asked a couple of folks in front of the shop about a good place to eat and also for some baked goods. He said come on in. They were really friendly and set me up properly for my trip back to Houston.  The PB&J bar was delicious. If you're ever in Hoboken,  do yourself a favor amd stop by Bean Vault Coffee not only for the baked greatness but also for the great service. I know I will.
2014-07-13,5,Awesome little local coffee shop in and old bank in Hoboken. They even have the original vault doors still within the store. The menu is small but they do amazing coffee. The staff is super friendly and very happy to be there. Skip the chain coffee in Hoboken and give it a shot!
2014-07-12,5,One of the places where Groupon works - I've come here many times after first picking up a Groupon for it.  The iced coffee here is not the most in terms of quantity (so if you're really thirsty for avg iced coffee, go to the sbux/dd nearby), but if you want a great tasting iced coffee while walking around the pier, Bean Vault is a great option.
2014-07-06,4,Delicious iced coffee and right next to path! Its a tad on the pricier end but worth it since the snacks and the drinks are sooo good.
2014-05-28,1,Good coffee does not make up for #stale croissants and a rude dude working the cash register #badexperience
2014-05-25,4,They offer a cold brew which is rare. It's a little pricey, but usually this top quality is. Very friendly staff and needless to say the product is top notch.
2014-05-24,5,Great to see an artisan coffee shop downtown. I don't blame the Modcup guys for leaving downtown Hoboken -- I wouldn't want to stand outside working a cart every day either. They use beans from Toby's Estate in Brooklyn. When I went, they only had one bean available for brewing with pour over -- the Muungano from Congo. It was very good. I wish they had more choices. It shouldn't take more effort to have 2-3 different beans available for pour over unless they aren't getting enough turn over in the pour over beans to justify it. I noticed the Toby's Estate beans all had a roast date on their bags which indicates that the roaster cares about freshness. My wife got the hot cocoa since she doesn't do coffee. That was also pretty good.There's really no reason to go to Starbucks with BVC covering downtown now unless you like your coffee brewed from stale, over-roasted beans.
2014-05-10,4,Omg! How overdue is this review?! I'm such a jerk! Ever since Modcup abandoned us lowly Hobokeners for The Heights (hating), I was SOL for fresh coffee and was sucked back into the Starbucks black hole of triple grande 3-pump caramel 3-pump vanilla no foam-with whip lattes. Then one day on my walk from the PATH to work, I noticed a sign knocked down and being battered by the wind. This sign pointed me in the direction of a new local coffee shop! I felt the heavens open and heard the angels singing!Fast forward....I've been stopping at Bean Vault just about every weekday for the last couple months and it has made my life. All the coffee/espresso variations I've had have been delicious! My newest fav is the cafe au lait/cafe con leche! Coffee w steamed skim. It's so much better for my pockets and my waistline (not that I really care about the latter lol). Everyone who works there is so nice and helpful and after the 3rd day, they had memorized my order. They also have a loyally card with Loyal Blocks. You can download the app and get a free drink after your 10th drink. (Getting my next free drink on Monday!)Go to here! Support local businesses! :)
2014-05-05,5,Five star coffee and cappuccinos.  You can tell they take pride in roasting the best coffee.  The prices are roughly a 50-75cent premium to Starbucks. Now that the word is out, i hope they are able to keep the line moving as more people stop by during the busy times. So far so good, but something to keep in mind.
2014-05-02,5,I'll keep this short and simple.  The people who work here are very nice and they serve well-made, high-quality coffee at a reasonable price.  That's all I am looking for from a coffee shop.I also prefer this place to the coffee they serve at the Mod Cup cart, which is simply too light of a roast for my tastes.If you appreciate good coffee and prefer to stay away from the charred mud they serve at Starbucks, I highly suggest you give these guys a shot.  Keep up the good work and I will be back.
2014-05-01,5,I just went for the first time and I'm impressed. It's a quaint, one-room, no-seating coffee shop with really friendly staff and pretty good coffee. I went in not knowing what to expect, having no idea what I wanted and asked the barista for suggestions. She prompted me on a few preferences and ended up giving a suggestion (which was just what I wanted). Aside from your standard milk and half and half, they offer almond milk and coconut milk among others that escape me currently.  From now on I'll be going here rather than Starbucks whenever I can. I'll definitely be making this a regular stop on the way to the train station. Love it!
2014-05-01,5,Stopped by the Bean Vault early this afternoon  for the first time and I have to say that I was impressed with the latte. It was just amazingly delicious. The barista recommended the chocolate chip graham cracker cookie...soooo GOOD! It was a perfect pair for my iced mocha latte. The place has no seats available but that's fine. It is very cozy. The store was a little warm but I think that's because the guy barista was kinda hot. Definitely will recommend. 5 stars!
2014-04-26,3,Cool spot and I hope it does well! We should support small, local businesses for a lot of reasons. I have swung in here a couple times when returning from the City on a weekend morning. Good coffee, nice folks. I'll add another star soon enough.
2014-04-10,5,Solid, solid, solid coffee! Excellent. I love dark, strong, clean & crisp cups of coffee and BVC serves just that. I don't like to add anything other than milk... For $2.75 my piping hot cup truly was perfect ($4 for iced brew). I'm not even sure what else to say other than its great. Oh, the location is tiny & there's no room to hang out.... Considering I take the PATH everyday & that this week be my coffee joint moving guard, I'm afraid there's going to be a huge line after ppl read this review lol  Also, while you're in there try their macaroon's... gooey in the center, toasty outside.
2014-04-04,5,I'm SO grateful for a (very good) alternative to Starbucks/Dunkin. I work around the corner so it's super convenient. And about the coffee temperature (regarding the other reviews I saw), my Americano is nice and hot. Definitely stop by on your way out of the train station!!
2014-03-26,4,The coffee was great, way better than Starbucks. I'm so happy that a small coffee shop opened up by my work. The latte I got was delicious, no weird after taste and came with a smiling service.I would say the prices are a bit steep (4$ for my small latte), but the taste was well worth it. Definitely coming back.
2014-03-23,4,A very nice and very small coffee shop. I can't believe that I've never heard of this coffee shop before... I need to get out more. Over all they had great coffee. I went with two of my friends and all of us really liked the coffee. Very nice style/feel to the shop. Nice employees. I would suggests to go and try it yourself
2014-03-20,4,I'm really loving this place especially since it's so close to the terminal. The employees are really nice and always happy! The place is tiny but very clean. It's a pick up your drink and go spot, which stinks because I love to sit down and get some work done before school. Lattes are bold and my large cup of dark roast coffee with soy is always on point! One thing I have noticed twice is my coffee isn't always hot...it's warm. Not really what I expect when I order a hot drink. But this is definitely my new go to spot for coffee/lattes before a 3 hour class!
2014-03-15,5,This place is great and the coffee puts Starbucks to shame. I highly recommend it!!!
2014-03-10,2,Seems like a decent enough shop. Small, no seating (fine with that), no frills, and nice looking.Went with a friend. She got a drip coffee (~12 oz.) that was "decent and strong, but not great" for about $2.25. I got a mochaccino for $3.50. (I give pricing only to help fellow Yelpers.)  First, I was taken aback to receive a ~8-oz. cup (could've been smaller, but definitely wasn't larger). Second, it was, at best, lukewarm; I wanted a hot coffee, and this is something I don't understand: Coffee shops (especially the small ones) seem to have a fear of making something hot. Guys, don't be afraid to make a hot drink hot. Not warm, not sorta hot, but hot. That's a basic; it's either HOT or it's iced. Tepid coffee's not a good thing.
2014-03-09,4,I commute to the city 2 days a week and now look forward to getting my cup, from Bean Vault.  It's good coffee, and I'm stoked that there isn't a bunch of  ridiculous coffee concoctions that narcissists take an hour to order,  Everytime I've been there, it's just been people getting coffee and getting out- perfect for people who just want good coffee, not an "experience".The decor is cozy and the place is kept clean.  Also, the dairy carafes have never been empty.I really hope locals support this place.
2014-03-02,4,Stumbled upon this place a few weeks ago while running errands. Just had opened because they didn't have their cappuccino machine yet but their coffee was excellent! Also had a delicious pastry! Employees (and I think the owner?) were very friendly. Will definitely be back ! Best of luck to them!
2014-02-25,4,I really like that the shop is small so people cant camp out on their laptops for hours. I also loved that the barista was SOOOO knowledgeable on the products. Thats a great sign! He was genuinely interested in educating me on their products and was helpful with a recommendation. I felt that the price was high for a large cup of coffee (i forget what i ordered) 16oz (2.75) I felt that it would be acceptable if it was a 20oz. They also only sell small and large. I will be returning and recommending to friends in the area! The shop is located on a side street RIGHT next to the terminal which makes it very accessible for commuters.
2014-02-19,5,Simple, no-nonsense quality. That's what The Bean Vault Coffee is all about. When you're in Hoboken, there's finally a better option than Crappin' Donuts. Friendly barristas with a story to tell and laugh to go with it. I live in Brooklyn and we don't even have this kind of place. Before you hit the PATH, hit the Bean Vault. You'll be glad you did.
2014-02-16,5,Hoboken went from having no legitimate coffee shops to a couple of really solid options, in what seems like overnight, with Bean Vault Coffee taking the top spot. Coffee quality and selection is amazing, very friendly and helpful service, bar stocked with delicious pastries, AND it's right by the PATH making for a perfect morning spot.
2014-02-14,5,I had my first Bean Vault Coffee experience this morning, and it was so amazing that I had to follow up with a review.  My boyfriend and I were having a miserable time trekking through slush and snow on our way to work, and decided to grab some coffee to cheer ourselves up.  The barista was incredibly nice (and sympathetic), and recommended some blueberry scones to accompany our lattes.  It was a wonderful suggestion, and I couldn't decide which was better: the latte or the scone.Before we left, we overheard the barista asking a customer whether he liked his cappuccino wet or dry.  Definitely worth noting that the staff actually cares about serving customers coffee to their tastes, instead of rushing them out the door.  It's not an exaggeration (well, maybe) to say that coffee can be a deciding factor in whether your day will be optimistic or not.... Bean Vault Coffee basically guarantees a positive mood!
