2021-11-08,5,I love to be surprised, and this was a good one. Ordered late night delivery on Halloween weekend and wasn't expecting much but this place came through big time. Got the requisite buffet of fried delicacies: boneless wings, prosciutto rice balls, and mozz sticks and all were crispy and delicious. Also got a big Margherita pizza which was perfectly cooked and downright tasty (as were the leftover slices the following morning). It's a definite yes from me, will order again.
2021-10-21,1,Ordered homes style chicken tenders (which I have ordered many times before) for pickup and they gave me a chicken cutlet cut into pieces. When I went back to ask the two employees were insistent I got the chicken tenders. I didn't enjoy being laughed at as a loyal customer as they know they gave me the wrong thing. I will never go back.
2021-10-09,1,Hate having to write these negative reviews for a local spot, but this food just couldn't be described as anything but atrocious. I fully blame myself, because you can obviously tell that this place isn't anything special. Right next door is Napolis, some of my favorite pizza and "order in" italian in Hoboken. Now you can tell the difference when you walk by these two spots on a Friday night, every table at Napolis, filled. Tables at the Brick..not so much. But, nonetheless, I have passed this spot multiple times and figured it was time to give it a shot. We started off with a free plate of garlic knots, which honestly were very good. Pleasantly surprised, we looked forward to our appetizer, prosciutto risotto balls. To say these were disappointing is an understatement. First thing we noticed is that the middle was cold, not only that but the only real taste we got, was an overpowering hit of salt. Not good. Next, I got a personal pie, vodka sauce with prosciutto and arugula. The pie came out super soggy (if you ever walk by this spot, take a look at someone pie, looks like it came from a school cafeteria). Easily the worst pizza I have had in Hoboken. I normally put down 4 slices, I couldn't even finish this personal pie. Then came the worst part of our meal, the chicken parm with penne. The sauce definitely came from a can, reminded me of college pasta that my roommates would make. Dump a tub of ragu in a pot and call it a day. The chicken was definitely frozen, you could just tell how chewy and dry it was. Again, this tasted like it came out of a hospital cafeteria this time. Service was okay, no complaints on that. But the food definitely was as close to inedible as it could be. TLDR: go to Napolis next door instead, save yourself the grief
2021-10-01,2,I was very excited to see the extensive gluten free and vegan menu at this restaurant. The first time I ate here I was advised that there is a dedicated gluten free fryer for the gluten free menu options and I thoroughly enjoyed my food. I called for takeout recently and asked again about the fryer just to be safe, and was told everything is actually mixed together in the same fryers. As someone with celiac disease I was disappointed this wasn't stressed to me the first time, and I unfortunately can no longer eat here and enjoy the food. Celiacs beware.
2021-09-22,4,After about 4 grams of Morning Breath the munchies were in full roar lol. Now I'm wit some carnivorous companions so I gotta find a place that's gonna make everyone happy. Boom!The Brick. They have a separate fully vegan menu and man did they come correct. I smashed this burger. It was loaded with everything a growing boy needs. Guac, lettuce, tomato, onions. Delicious. No cap we came back the next day haha. Def recommend.
2021-09-13,5,Vegan cheesesteak is weirdly AMAZING!! Seriously recommend. It's also huge so plenty leftover or good to split. I am not a vegan and this is one of the best vegan meals I've Ever had. Super quick for pickup as well. They almost always have free garlic knots for dine in.
2021-09-03,5,Best Vegan restaurant I've been to .. friendly, fast, amazing taste waiter Aaron was amazing
2021-09-03,5,We went to The brick last weekend with some friends. Although it is about a mile walk from Hoboken path station it is absolutely worth it!! 5 stars for everything:*Setting* - casual, outdoor seating. It's quaint and they have lit up the area with string lights. It looked very pretty and inviting *Service* - fast, polite and helpful service. Our server was attentive and was able to answer all our questions regarding items on the menu *Food* - what can I say! Everything was delicious. We ordered Cajun fries, fried calamari, fried asparagus and stuffed portobello mushrooms from their appetizers menu. If you go there I highly recommend their stuffed mushrooms and fried asparagus (it's quite different and delicious ). We also ordered two medium pizzas. Eggplant Parmesan (minus bacon) and sweet mango pizza. Sweet mango was unusual for a pizza as the name suggests (we knew it when we ordered of course!) Although the flavor profile doesn't really blend well with a pizza it was certainly sweet mango ! Eggplant Parmesan pizza was perfect. We enjoyed our dinner immensely.*value for money* - our bill was ~$80 and we were pleasantly surprised.Definitely recommend this place. FYI - it is BYOB (there's a store close by if you like to have a beer with your pizza )
2021-08-05,5,Nice place for a sit down dinner. Great flavors and great value. Service was great. Would definitely recommend you give it a try if your in the neighborhood.
2021-08-04,5,Really good pizza, followed by an extensive menu!Their appetizer selection was amazing - buffalo cauliflower, bacon brussel sprouts, and the calamari were perfect!The most impressive, which I would highly recommend are two pizzas; the Garlic Knot Pizza, and the Everything Bagel Pizza. These were definite faves - and were HUGE. You'd definitely come here with a to-go bag for your leftovers.
2021-08-01,5,Pleasantly surprised with our visit to this restaurant. We love visiting new vegan spots and this was definitely worth it. The vegan mozzarella sticks were huge and so worth it. The garlic knots were delicious. The tomato sauce had a great flavor. The vegan Greek salad was very refreshing and had delicious dressing (can't wait to try their other salads). We ended up ordering large half vegan buffalo chicken and half can't believe it's vegan pizza. To be honest the apps were where the excitement was. The pizza crust / flavors could have been a little more balanced, but the apps make up for it!! We went back and tried a personal vegan plain pizza and it was so much better! Sometimes more simple the better! There is an entire vegan menu and we can't wait to come back and try more entrees. The restaurant is located on a beautiful street great for date nights. Free parking on Sunday. They have a variety of gluten free options as well. Oh and the best part is they have a dog friendly patio out front!!On our second visit we had the vegan Caesar salad, vegan beyond nachos, vegan Caprese salad, and a personal plain vegan pizza. They were all phenomenal 10 out of 10.
2021-07-30,4,So great to go to a place with a full vegan menu! It's a very impressive selection of food. We especially loved our appetizers, the fried asparagus and garlic knots. The pasta with sausage and broccoli rabbe had a sauce that was too thick and lemony for me - I think it would have been great in just some olive oil. Service was fast and friendly. Overall, definitely recommend.
2021-07-29,5,The food is sooo good! I came here with my family and we had trouble deciding between foods because they were so appealing. The spaghetti and meatballs were made with such prestige; marinara sauce and Parmesan blended brilliantly together for a great classic meal!
2021-07-29,5,Absolutely delicious! Incredible vegan options. The asparagus chips, vegan penne, and vegan garlic knots were a HIT! The non vegan options were also amazing, some of the biggest hits were the lobster/crab ravioli, penne vodka, stuff rigatoni, and of course the classic spaghetti and meatballs. The service is incredible and we all just had an amazing time. Truly recommend checking them out!
2021-07-23,5,Food was great and big portions. Vegan Baked penne taste good and was a large portion. Vegan Mozzarella sticks were also good. Sausage and peppers sandwich was flavourful.
2021-07-20,5,SUCH amazing pizza and incredible service. Also do not skip out on the cajun fries they are amazing. get the bruchestta pizza
2021-07-16,5,This spot is a great place for intimate, Italian-esque dining. Soho feel, right in the middle of Hoboken. Great flavors, quality ingredients and loads of options. Tabitha was such a joy to interact with too. This is my 2nd time here, and I will definitely be back. 10/10 recommend.
2021-07-15,5,Pizza was absolutely amazing!! Better than all the pizza we've had in the city. The service was also amazing. Our server was very attentive, nice, and knowledgeable. Come here for great food!
2021-07-14,5,Not only was the food ABSOLUTELY amazing the service was impeccable, and Tabitha was so welcoming and friendly. The garlic knot pizza was incredible!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
2021-07-09,5,This place is where it's AT! They have some amZing and unique menu items you're gonna love! They also have a whole separate vegan/vegetarian menu as well! How cool! Get the garlic knot crusted pizza!!
2021-06-29,5,This please was absolutely delicious. I tempered my expectations being that we were eating off their vegan menu...and I didn't need to do that, because everything was delicious. We had the vegan mozzarella sticks, vegan garlic knots, my husband had the vegan Buffalo pizza (off menu), and I had the beyond meatballs and spaghetti.  I honestly wouldn't have been able to distinguish between a regular slice and their vegan buffalo- because it was just that good of a slice. If you have a gluten allergy, dairy allergy, or just prefer a vegan diet- this is definitely a place to try. The host was also very kind and attentive- which was very much appreciated as they were busy.
2021-06-29,5,This place was amazing! I just recently found out I developed a dairy allergy and was missing pizza so much. This definitely hit the spot!
2021-06-28,5,Very nice food! A lot of vegan options and variety on the dishes I personally loved the vegan Puff pastry, delicious and I'll definitely be back to try more options
2021-06-21,5,The spot is amazing! It features indoor and outdoor seating and it is BYOB. They have an extensive vegan and gluten free menu which is great and serve several different types of food!
2021-06-11,5,This spot is straight up deliciousness!!!! Amazing service, great atmosphere, awesome items on the menu! Check it out great for vegans and non vegans alike!
2021-06-02,5,First time here, im always looking for some great vegan pasta.I was surprised to see the extensive vegan options they have on a whole separate menu. My friend ordered their penne vodka with chicken while I ordered the vegan penne pasta with their vegan chicken. It was so yummy!! We'll be back to try the pizza next time.
2021-05-30,5,Great Italian and pizza spot with a large menu of gluten-free and vegan items. Delicious and can't wait to come back!
2021-05-30,5,Delicious  vegan food.  Wanted to try something new so we found this spot and they have a great vegan menu. Got pizza, stuffed mushrooms,  garlic knots and the buffalo flower. Glad we made the trek here. Definitely come back again.
2021-04-22,5,Awesome pizza and great service! Server Aron was very informative and let us try the vegan Cesar and it was delicious, will definitely be back.
2021-04-19,2,I went here to pick up an order and didn't like it. One of the workers talked to another one about me while I was standing right there and made me feel really uncomfortable as though I was not a customer. The food was also nothing special. It was a weird and very scary experience.. like I felt I was being harassed. I also told a worker I would be outside waiting for my order and no one ever called me. I just walked back in, guessing the appropriate pickup time at some point. I was intrigued by the vegan menu but I'm most likely never going back unless I go with someone else. Sketchy..
2021-04-18,5,This is a really great pizza spot in Hoboken! They have two full menus, one regular menu and one that is 100% plant-based/vegan menu. My friends and I enjoyed everything we had here. The customer is service is amazing; everyone is so friendly and more than happy to help. I really enjoyed the Buffalo chicken pizzas, both vegan and non-vegan. Definitely a great place to visit or order out in Hoboken. Highly recommend!
2021-04-16,5,Ordered two pizzas and Cajun fries. Food was great.  Overall. Quality place. Friendly service. No pretension. We'll be back.
2021-04-08,5,Was excited to try the vegan menu. My kids tried the regular menu and the food was amazing. My kids are a bit picky and they loved it. As for the vegan items, they were phenomenal. Staff was very friendly. Everything was delicious and I would recommend this place. I will be back and will be ordering delivery.
2021-04-02,5,Wouldn't have known this is vegan if I didn't come here myself! Great food and great service!
2021-03-31,4,The Brick has a large vegan menu! My husband and I were so excited to try what they had on their vegan menu. We ordered the mozzarella sticks, nachos, garlic knots, and a medium half buffalo chicken and half traditional pizza. The service was phenomenal. Our waitress was very considerate. She constantly checked up on us. Their food come in large portions.
2021-03-29,5,Ummm hello vegan menu!!!! Amazing. I haven't had a Philly cheesesteak in YEARSSSSS until I found the vegan option here
2021-03-20,4,The vegan options are really great.  We enjoyed the asparagus fries, garlic knots, penne with brocolli rabe and sausage sauteed in white wine and garlic.  I would highly recommend The Brick as a fun vegan dining experience.
2021-02-25,1,this was my first time here. Me and my partner spent 42$ for a pizza pie that was hald inedible and fries that were so mediocre and greasy and some vegan mozz. sticks that were the only thing i ate. i spit out the half of the Margherita pie it was so bad, the cheese was hard and not fresh at all. I wanted to go back to try and get money back but My partner was over it with how sick he felt after and just wanted to go home. never again
2021-02-17,1,The food was absolutely inedible. Flavorless eggplant parm and the Buffalo cauliflower had a really weird metallic taste so we threw the whole order away. So gross. Seriously, Buffalo cauliflower isn't rocket science.
2021-02-11,5,Come here!! Stuff bolognese and the best pizza! So good for take out and a bunch of friends! We couldn't even wait to eat it!
2021-01-11,5,Love their vegan pizza and the vegan mozz sticks. Delivery always takes a little while but I just plan accordingly. Worth the try.
2021-01-04,5,Great Mediterranean cuisine. Good promotions from restaurants.com. Enjoyable and worth the somewhat modest price. Place and tables could be bigger though.
2020-11-20,1,I ordered a pizza with half chicken and half grilled shrimp and paid $50 but thee meat toppings on the pizza was so scanty that u can hardly get a piece of shrimp or chicken on a slice this is awful. When I called back and reported this issue all he said was sorry u got that pizza.
2020-11-05,2,I hate to do this to a place but this pizza was barely edible. I went with a plain slice and a chicken bacon ranch slice. Both looked better in the window than  in front of me. The one thing that stuck out is that both were insanely greasy.  The pizza becomes very flimsy from the oil and it gets soggy.  I can't even chalk that up to a bad day at the office... this pizza was just not up to par.   Pizza is usually something I can eat even if it is average and I couldn't even get this one down. The garlic knots were the only edible thing here and the saving grace to the meal.  I will definitely not be back.
2020-11-04,5,They use great fresh ingredients  !  Love their amazing  brick oven Meat Eaters Pizza ! Loved the sausage and crisp pepperoni
2020-11-02,5,This is one of my Top 10! Not only do they offer an 100% vegan menu on top of a regular menu but it's also very delicious. I can't complain about anything. The best service, hospitality, cleanliness, and presentation. They have amazing vegan pastas and sandwiches for a great price. You can't go wrong with a vegan philly steak sandwich or the vegan Bolognese pasta. They also have a really good mint lemonade that's worth a try.
2020-10-22,5,They have a very good thin crust margarita pizza. Outdoor dining service was excellent. Would come back again.
2020-10-22,5,I'm vegan and I loved how many vegan options they have. I had the vegan Margherita pizza and it was delicious!
2020-10-17,4,This place has a great gluten free and vegan menu, and a wonderful outdoor heated lamp
2020-10-17,5,Vegetarian gal here. I love their pizza. Probably one of the best in Hoboken. If you're around, definitely give this spot a try!
2020-10-17,5,As a vegan it's really hard to find Italian spots that also cater towards vegans/vegetarians. I'm so happy I found out about this place. I come here all the time for my pizza/Italian cravings. I highly recommend! Will be back for more.
2020-10-10,5,This spot is amazing! We had a totally vegan dinner thanks to their vegan menu .. they have a totally (non vegan) menu as well.I have to say that this was my favorite "cheesesteak" I've ever had! I will definitely be back again! Great outdoor setup as well.
2020-10-09,4,Another great Pizza spot in Hoboken. We had the buffalo cauliflower appetizer and a traditional pie which was banging. BYOB which is a plus and the outdoor area has heat lamps which were clutch for an October Night dinner
2020-10-09,5,We stumbled upon this place and were so glad we did by the end. They have amazing vegan dishes and their sauces are A+. Def would recommend the beyond stuffed mushrooms.
2020-10-07,5,This was a great spot for vegan food in Hoboken.  I'm always on the look out for vegan nachos, and found delicious ones here.  There was something here for the whole family.  Will definitely be back when I'm in the area!
2020-10-06,4,Nice place, the waitress was really nice, the margherita pizza was great and the hamburger was okay, although the fries were really good, I deeply recommend them.
2020-10-03,4,Order the White Pie and you won't be disappointed.Service is decent, but not the best.
2020-10-03,5,Amazing Vegan/GF options! They make the vegan cheese and sauces in house (cashew based). Personally obsessed with the vegan gf ceasar, gf buff cauliflower and vegan Philly. Delicious. Also we love the server Trixie! She has helped us both times we have dined here.
2020-10-02,5,Excellent steak and rice.  Friendly staff and quick service.  Lots of selection on the menu.
2020-10-02,5,This is my favorite Italian spot in Hoboken! They have an amazing vegan menu, but also have a regular menu! Service is great and they also have their own app to order from. Highly recommend if you haven't been already.
2020-10-02,2,Went there two months back and quite liked the place.. went there earlier this week and am never coming back!- Food: Buffalo Cauliflower  were so so so oily.. it was like they were retired 2-3 times and yet weren't crispy.. which clearly meant they weren't fresh- see picture below of the oil I framed on tissue till I just gave up (and no it wasn't buffalo sauce, it was oil)- Vegan Pasta- Trader joes packaged pasta is better! -Vegan Pizza- Crust was no great, sauce seems flavourless.. it was like those $2 pizza slicesyou get in nyc and totally not worth the price- Waitress- Rude-ish. No smile, mask was always below nose... came so close to ya while speaking even though I was clearly backing away in my seat cause her mask was below her nose, Curt one word type responses.. like she did not even give us half a smile while we were there. Long wait for the bill and then the card payment even though the place was almost empty (only one other table filled besides us)
2020-09-28,5,Amazing vegan options. Nachos were good + spicy. They made their vegan Caesar salad into a wrap and it was perfect. Vegan BBQ jackfruit was also amazing.
2020-09-28,4,Love the atmosphere. Nice ambience, great vegan options. Lots to choose from! Got the vegan margherita, eggplant bruschetta and a great salad! Second time here loved the pizza
2020-09-28,5,The Brick is one of the best Italian joints in Hoboken, especially for vegetarians and gluten-free individuals like myself. I am especially impartial to the pina colada salmon, which is served over the most incredible bed of creamy coconut rice. (I've tried recreating this at home to no avail.)On the vegan menu, I highly recommend trying the mozzarella sticks, the Buffalo flower, and the vegan nachos. Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu -- it's all superb.Ironically enough, I've never actually tried the pizza here, but my fiancé is a big fan. Their delivery is also super fast and well-priced if you're looking for a quick and affordable at-home option!
2020-09-25,5,They were awesome! The pizza was delicious and all the vegan options were incredible! Will be back for sure!!!
2020-09-24,2,I really wish I could say good things about this place. Took my boyfriend here for his birthday and we were excited all week to try stuff off the vegan menu because we saw some good reviews! The vegan margarita pizza was not good, the cheese wasn't melted at all(I know vegan cheese doesn't melt too much but it wasn't melted in the slightest) and the crust was not cooked. We didn't get our drinks until after our food was served and the waitress was rude when we asked for a new water because there was a hair in it. I wouldn't waste my money here but I will say there vegan mozzarella sticks were good.
2020-09-19,5,This was a great stop for lunch with a vegan friend- options for both of us, quick & friendly service and delicious meals!
2020-09-12,1,Was a loyal customer and loved this place but over the years the quality has gotten worse and worse. Not sure if it's a new chef or management but now their pizza is no better than Dominos. It used to be good speciality pies, decent regular pie, now I've tossed my leftovers the last 3 times I've ordered. Im done supporting this place, such a shame. Same delivery driver has also had a bad attitude the last time Ive ordered.
2020-09-12,5,This is a great restaurant. The service is friendly and the food is tasty and filling. Ranking in top three vegan places in NJ. Will definitely come back. Thank you to Tabatha for a great service and Mike for answering our questions. We enjoyed our food a lot.
2020-09-07,5,The service here is amazing! Came here for the first time and tried a few vegan options... The stuffed mushroom are scrumptious!!!
2020-09-05,5,The Brick in Hoboken, NJ is absolutely incredible!! They have a 100% plant based menu and regular menu. I attached the vegan menu and some images of what I ordered.The vegan ceasar salad, the Beyond vegan stuffed mushrooms, vegan margarita pizza with homemade mozzarella and vegan napoleon were out of this world. Everything is homemade and top quality.I highly, highly recommend it.#vegan #plantbased
2020-08-30,5,Had the "It's Not What You Think" vegan pizza pie with my girlfriend and we both loved it! The beyond meat and the jalapenos combine to make a really good taste.
2020-08-29,5,Excellent menu variety, evening ambience, and friendly service! Definitely a fan of their person pies, all great choices! Plus their apps are a perfect meal starter! Definitely coming back! Oh and it's a great date spot :)
2020-08-29,5,Incredible. My sister is vegan and we always have difficulty finding a place to eat out when she visits but this was perfect. Great service, felt safe and the food was amazing. Portions are big and we had leftovers. We had vegan garlic bread, vegan eggplant parm and vegan baked penne. Vegan ricotta mirrored real ricotta.
2020-08-28,1,They couldn't properly cook the pizza. They don't get it. The dough is still raw but somehow the crust and bottom is cooked. I don't know wha's going on over there. I appreciate that they tried to make it right by sending me the second pizza, but they don't care. Avoid at all costs.
2020-08-22,5,Amazing vegan menu. A great place to go out to eat if you're a mix of meat eaters and vegan. It was hard for me to decide what I wanted from the menu.
2020-08-22,5,Great food and service! Extensive options for vegan and non-vegan eaters, which is a rare find for pizza in Hoboken. Loved the garlic knots and sriracha chicken flat bread!
2020-08-22,5,We went on a Saturday evening and though it was busy, the staff too great care to be safe and socially distant. All servers and cooking staff wore masks and gloves the entire time. Service was quick and the menu was surprisingly broad for a pizza place. The vegan menu is just as expansive as the regular menu. It was a great place to go when half of your party is nondairy/vegetarian and the other half just really wants a cheesy flatbread. Very solid food for the price. Good sized portions.
2020-08-19,5,Amazing food!!!! Had a vegan dinner with the vegan greak salad and the Buffalo flower.  So So yummy. Salad was super fresh and a great portion. Thie Buffalo Flower was the best I have had ... Ever!!. Service was wonderful! Our waitress Tabitha was very accommodating as well. Will definitely come back back asap.
2020-08-15,4,The service here is impeccable. The portions are extremely generous and the deals are great. As for the food itself, it's good but not the best Italian in Hoboken. Regardless, I recommend this for a family dinner, especially if you have young kids since the staff could not be more accommodating.
2020-06-14,5,Great service! Great food! One of the best places in Hoboken! Food was delicious! Highly recommended!
2020-05-17,5,I WILL NEVER STOP EATING AT THE BRICK!!! I've posted another review earlier about their vegan/dairy free options and felt I needed to post again. Every time I order and eat a dairy free menu item from the brick it's like the first time all over again (haha). The vegan pizza pies are amazing. The vegan mozzarella sticks are to die for. The vegan Caesar salad is out of this world. How is it so damn good?! I'm so happy I found my go to vegan/dairy free pizza fix in Hoboken.
2020-05-01,5,Originally, my order was 1 hour late and the delivery person had a mix up where they left it downstairs for me and it appears that someone else took our food.Fortunately the manager made it right, personally called and delivered our order again after hearing about the incident. Excellent customer service. Thank you, Mike!
2020-03-14,5,Found this place thru UberEats then checked it out in person. Both times yummy. Saturday afternoon lunch with the 1 year old and my other half. The staff is SO SO FRIENDLY, very neighborhood pizza spot feel. Super accommodating about my cheese less pizza for my kiddo. (FYI- no slices here, only personal or large pans) the vegan cheesesteak and vegan sausage peppers sandwiches are SO GOOD! The sweet chili cauliflower appetizer is quite delicious, the kiddo even enjoyed it. I learned that even the vegan ranch dip is made from scratch.The vegan sausage & broccoli rabe was not a fave.Great place, will be back.
2020-03-07,5,We wanted to try the vegan menu and were so impressed! Staff were very friendly and happy to make recommendations. We had the vegan mozzarella sticks and the "This Can't Be Vegan?!" Pizza. Both were good, the pizza was delicious. We tried a vegan chocolate cake and loved it. Will absolutely be coming back to try out more of their menu. I loved that they were proud of their offerings, and we enjoyed trying them.
2020-03-07,1,Walking on Washington street this Saturday night I'm passing a couple pizza places and I choose to try The Brick. Looks nice and pizza looks pretty good. I decide to give it a try. I order the baked ziti slice and a plain slice. 8.50, not cheap but it's Washington street rent, I get it. I'm waiting for about 10 min and all of a sudden the pizza chef asks me what I'm waiting for, long story short they forgot to put my pizza in the oven, ok no worries. But then he grabs the pizza with his bare hands. I'm extra sensitive right now with the Corona Virus news but he just grabs the pizza no gloves. Fine maybe a pizza chef is constantly washing his hands, I give him the benefit of the doubt. My pizza is ready and they hand me the box. I ask for some Parmesan to put on top. The worker said he couldn't find it, I'm like ok no problem do you happen to have any in the back. He grabs the box walks around the counter and with his BARE HANDS that have been touching cash and dirty iPad and register screens and him coughing into his hands, reaches directly into a container of shredded parm and completely shamelessly and without any regard for the customers health and safety sprinkled the cheese on the pizza. I was in shock, I couldn't speak. I walked out and threw the pizza out. Don't care if your pizza is good, get your operation in order. You have a responsibility to the Hoboken community to keep everyone safe, ESPECIALLY in this current environment.
2020-02-14,1,Worst place that this guy makes you wait for ever for take out! They send orders for table that booked after us and then keep sending grub hub orders. No respect for take out deliveryThe reason we chose to do take out in person is from Another previous experience when they cancelled our order placed from their website with no apologies, by just sending an email after half hour from order time. No courtesy call what so everThis place is so cold and not conducive environment to sit and eat. Wonder what options this owner really leaves for one to eat anything from here.Only reason we come back after such mistreatment is they have vegan pizza
2020-02-13,5,I have been coming here for a year now. I just can't get enough of their pizza. There's a lot of other pizza locations around Hoboken but none like the brick fire baked pizza. Fries are so crispy and yummy! amazing customer service, sanitary place 10/10.
2020-02-03,4,Vegan pizza in Hoboken! I ordered the Vegan margherita pizza and it was delicious. We called ahead for Super Bowl Sunday and the delivery was seamless.
2020-02-01,1,There's not a lot of vegan restaurants in our area so we were excited to give this place a try. We placed an order for 2 pizza pies, caesar salad, mozzarella sticks, and buffalo flower appetizers. I'm not sure if the delivery guy decided to take a nap during his shift but it took us two hours to get our food. Maybe they wouldn't have such terrible reviews if they gave their customers a heads up about wait time. We felt bad for making our guests wait so long. When i called the restaurant to check on the status of our order, a man answered the phone with an annoyed "yes?". Poor business practices.I would recommend only ordering a salad from here since it's already cold food. None of the "hot food" items on the menu will arrive warm.
2020-01-25,5,Not your traditional Hoboken pizza shop as they have an extensive VEGAN menu! So far we've tried the vegan mozzarella cheese stick, Buffalo cauliflower, various vegan pizzas and the vegan Bolognese GF penne.  ALL amazing.This time we decided to sit down and dine in and the service was friendly and warm.  Looking forward to making this our regular place!!!  Bonus tip it's BYOB!  Vegan palates rejoice!
2020-01-04,5,They have an extensive and super delicious vegan menu.  They make their own in house vegan cheeses and it shows in the taste and quality!!!  We had the vegan mozzarella stick, great flavor and texture.  The vegan pizza, good crust great flavor.  The eggplant bruschetta, super crunchy tasty bread and flavorful olive eggplant topping.  The vegan meatballs with a minty vegan yogurt dip, great texture and soft meatballs and super relish sauce.Even our non vegan family members loved the food and actually kept eating our vegan mozzarella  sticks.Well certainly be back!!!
2019-08-04,5,Fresh hot pizza. What else can you ask for?! Friendly great staff too! Can't complain about a pizza spot that's open until 4.
2019-07-29,5,From the second we walked in the hostess was incredibly nice and friendly. The pizza was absolutely delicious! That part of Hoboken is great to be in and "The Brick" just adds a little more to the greatness.
2019-06-29,1,Used to love this place. Last few times ordering here the pizza (just 1 pie) comes about 2 hours after our order. Call to check in and they say 15 minutes no matter what yet it still doesn't arrive. Doesn't make sense considering how close we live and how little we order every single time. Too many good pizza places around to ever order from here again.
2019-04-24,2,Don't believe the website's pictures. This is the "Sicilian pizza" they sent us, complete with burnt cheese and non of the fresh basil that they advertised.
2019-04-10,4,A friend sent me Brick a few weeks back - and I have to say, it did not disappoint! I was fairly shocked to read reviews saying the food never showed up or was delivered hours after ordering. I can't be too certain what time the friend ordered the food, but it showed up on my doorstep at 9:30pm, still HOT! I had a margerita pizza, the parmesan fries, and the oreo truffle dessert. As I was sick this night, I couldn't go too hard too fast on the food. But my bites the first bight were exceptional, and then just as good the next day when I reheated it all up! The oreo truffle dessert was the nicest touch on a nice meal, and I wish I had a never-ending supply.  Was Brick the best pizza I have ever had? Nah, that's hard, there's too much pizza in the world. Did I enjoy every bite? Absolutely! Would I recommend this place to someone else? I definitely would! If I come here again, I definitely want to cross over into Hoboken and dine in instead of eating out, as I have heard the food is even better that way!
2019-03-04,1,We ordered the Sicilian pepperoni pizza. It was so dry!!! Definitely worst Sicilian pizza we've ever had. The photo is very telling if you're any bit of skeptical.
2019-02-12,5,Favorite pizza place in Hoboken. We probably order from here at least once a week! Their margarita pizza is delicious, fresh and their delivery is always fast. I've never been to the actual restaurant but I'm sure the pizza is even better dine in. We've tried their wings and sandwiches too - all good!!!! Love this place.
2019-01-19,5,This is my favorite pizzeria in Hoboken! They have an incredibly robust menu filled with innovative fusions and vegan items as well what else could you ask for?! OH WAIT B.Y.O.B that's the cherry on top!
2018-06-08,5,In New Jersey craving for some pizza and pasta. Looking around the area in Hoboken. Found this place after watching a movie. Arriving at the restaurant the at night time was amazing. The lighting was fabulous and the food too! I order a Margherita pizza and Smoked Asiago. The dishes was delicious. I couldn't be that much satisfy.
2018-04-16,1,Ordered delivery from here--just terrible. The "shrooms" app was ok, though odd to stuff it with so much ricotta. They called me to say they didn't have the lemon tilapia I ordered, so I got the chicken francese instead. This was a very soggy mess since it was completely drowned in sauce (which at least tasted ok but they should put sauce in a separate container if they are going to give so much). The mac n cheese was just awful. How do you screw that up so badly? Even mac made from a box would have been a million times better. Instead the macaroni was again drowning in some liquidy yellow sauce that was definitely not cheese and very bland and odd tasting. Had a few bites then decided to try to eat it next day instead. That was a mistake--when I heated it in the microwave the next day the "sauce" just immediately turned to a thick oil! It was just gross. Just threw it away, which was hard since it was all fairly pricey.
2018-03-10,1,We ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with mozz and roasted peppers (one of their standard sandwiches) and they put it on a hamburger bun- disgusting. Don't pretend you know italian when you serve an Italian sandwich on hamburger buns. We also got the garlic bread with cheese- of course no cheese, no seasoning, NO garlic- just oil or butter soaked bread- we threw our dinners out. We also order a pasta dish with whole wheat pasta and for the 3rd time they were out of whole wheat pasta- their pasta is NOT fresh its boxed pasta so why every time I order do you not have boxed whole wheat pasta (lasts for over a year and is less than $1 a box). Disgusting wont order ever from here again- go to Rosarios at Willow for much cheaper higher quality consistent food. Such a disappointment you continue to be and give Hoboken bad Italian food.
2018-02-23,5,This is my second time here. First time I used a Groupon. The food was great!  Ordered mozzarella sticks, calamari and large margarita pizza. All were delicious!  Love the fact that it is byob. The service was excellent. Bathroom was super clean. Will definitely be back.
2018-02-07,5,I live in FL now, but I'm from NJ and used to live in Hoboken, so every time I come back my first stop is usually for a good slice. We popped in here randomly to seek refuge from the freezing rain. Perhaps my pizza judging skills have softened a bit, but I thought the pizza was great. I ate way too much and now want to throw up. That's always a good sign. The place is cute and cozy and the music was good. Just a solid joint in my opinion.
2018-02-03,4,Probably the best late night pizza joint in Hoboken. Great Sicilian slices. Excellent service
2018-01-20,5,Visiting from California, this place is near my Airbnb and I've pretty much had dinner there every single night lol everyone is super friendly and the food is great
2018-01-01,1,Be careful when you order from this place via GrubHub. In my experience, the food did not arrive. On top of that, they also claimed that they called and waited at the door. I had asked my doorman if anyone arrived downstairs for a food delivery and his answer was no. When I called GrubHub to get a refund, the restaurant refused to issue the refund.There are other pizza locations in the area that have better quality service and they won't cheat you out of your money. This place needs to be shut down and be replaced with something better in food and service.
2017-12-16,1,I'm afraid I will have to say "goodbye" to this place after being a customer for years. They have the worse delivery speed and I hate the $2 delivery fee that is higher than competitors. The food had been wrong, cold or burnt by the time it shows up. It used to be great and then it became good and then it became "hit or miss" - now it's just a "miss". There are too many other great places to waste your time or knew here.
2017-11-21,3,I ordered pizza from Brick for delivery, and I would do so again.I tried out a southern style pizza. I gotta say, I loved the BBQ sauce on it. The pie was about $17, which was worth it. Of course the more basic pizzas are cheaper, but I wanted that sweet, sweet BBQ.If you like brick oven pizza, give Brick a shot!
2017-11-07,1,They stole my money.Last Saturday night my boyfriend and I went to the Brick after going to a bar.  It was late, but seemed to be a popular time since there was a line of people.  We got to the front of the line and there were only two slices of pizza left.  We thought it was our lucky night.  We were wrong. We ordered the two slices and i took out my card to pay.  The waitress said the would not accept my card, it was either cash or venmo.  Ive never heard of this but ok, i didn't have cash but i had venmo.  So i paid with venmo ($13.38 for 2 slices of pizza - absurd). But we were hungry so it was fine.  We stood waiting and the waitress rudely told us to sit down, that she would bring it.  so we sat and waited as more people came in and out.  Maybe 5 minutes go by and we decided we didnt need it that hot, so my boyfriend got up to check on it.  When he got up there the waitress said she forgot and gave our pizza away!! As rude as seemingly possible, she said they would refund our money and make us new slices.  We sat for another 10 minutes waiting for reimbursement and pizza. After another complaint, the waitress brought out a small calzone - not at all what we ordered. We ate it because we were starving and figured we weren't getting our pizza at that point.  We asked again about the reimbursement and were again told they were going to do it.  The whole time she was extremely rude and dismissive.We ended up leaving in hopes they were sending the reimbursment, but we were too tired to wait any longer.  Of course they did not.  My boyfriend tried numerous times to call themd uring the week and was told each time someone would call back.  the last time he called he was told that they sent the reimbursement and its no longer their problem, to call venmo.I sent them a Venmo request for the amount and i have yet to receive it.  It has been over a week.I will never come back here.
2017-11-05,1,Pick a different pizza place. I ordered food and it never showed (Spoiler Alert: They refused to give me a refund) so I contacted the restaurant and the woman who claimed to be a manager told me the delivery man knocked and nobody answered (we were up until 5 am binge watching Stranger Things). So he "left" the food on the floor and left. The delivery man's explanation of what happened is actually impossible because I have a front desk that is manned 24/7 and there were no deliveries for my unit. There are 7 or 8 buildings in my community so he must have bought it to the wrong building. I'm not upset that my order was never delivered. I understand mistakes happen. I'm upset because when I called this establishment they accused me of lying and and after 10 minutes of arguing with them they told me I would expect a refund in 3-5 business days. I then called Seamless, who called the restaurant who told them they would not offer me a refund. Moral of the story don't purchase food from this restaurant.
2017-10-01,1,It pains me to write this review. I've been a Brick customer since 2014 - love their fire baked pizza. I've taken nearly every visitor that has come out of town to the Brick and have had good experiences while dining there (BYOB, usually you can find a table, pretty quick service).However, delivery has been an entirely different ball game. As mentioned in many other reviews, the delivery service is always grossly late. I've dealt with the slightly cold pizza, whatever. What I cannot get over is terrible customer service.The past two times I've ordered delivery from here I've received the wrong pizza. Only after the delivery person left did I open the pizza and realize it was the wrong one. Of course, both times I called and asked for a new pizza to be sent, and both times I didn't get a new pizza!! The first time they asked me not to eat the pizza that was sent so they could send another one (Are you kidding me? We were starving by then). The first time I laughed and said, "It'll be tomorrow by the time the next pizza gets here, we'll just eat this one." After the first incident, I decided to shop around for a new favorite pizza place. It's been a few months since I ordered from here. Fast forward to this week, in the midst of a move, I decided to give the Brick another shot. I ordered a margherita pizza with pepperoni. The pizza is delivered and to my dismay, they sent just a margherita pizza missing the pepperoni. I was sitting in my empty apartment, no food in the fridge or cabinets and started wondering to myself, "What's their accuracy rate with orders here??" It's like they read the first line of the order and that's it. I called and told the manager, Mike, what happened. I asked if they could send a new pizza. It was late, and they were about to close, and Mike said that he couldn't do that. He offered to refund me the charge for the pepperoni - I paid cash. After explaining to him how much I love the Brick's pizza but the continuous issues with delivery, Mike said that the next time I wanted to order, call and ask for him and he'd take care of me. My boyfriend called total BS, but I was hopeful.Last night, I called and asked for Mike; he wasn't there. After explaining the situation, the lady on the phone took my order for delivery. I was happy and relieved that they honored Mike's word and were attempting to fix their mistakes. I kid you not, ten minutes later I get a phone call from the Brick from the same lady. She had the audacity to say that she questioned my story so she called Mike, and guess what Mike said? You know what he said. No, he wouldn't be taking care of me. She said that they wouldn't be sending me a pizza unless I wanted to pay for it. I literally laughed out loud and said, "Okay, you just lost a loyal customer that's brought you business for the past 3 years," and hung up the phone.The Brick will fail for its absolutely terrible customer service and lack of proper management.
2017-08-10,5,Brick is hands down the best pizza spot in Hoboken. Open late. Their Margherita slices are phenomenal. Coming from a born and raised jersey girl there is no better pizza spot in town. Staff is great pieces are normal and always clean inside.
2017-08-03,5,Brick is my favorite pizza spot in Hoboken because they're simply the BEST. They have the wonderful selection, an awesome and friendly staff, and they even accept venmo! Some of my favorites are their penne vodka pie, garlic knots, and their mozzarella sticks. Never have to wait long for your food and always greeted with a smile :)
2017-07-25,3,Pretty standard Pizza joint. The best part about it is it's open late, and under normal circumstances I'd say you should walk 50 feet over to Napoli's - The Brick is usually the last pizza / food spot open in the neighborhood on a Saturday night.Pizza isn't terrible, but with so many qaulity options in Hoboken / NYC area, it's hard to justify the calories of a pizza or calzone when you feel like it wasn't worth the calories you just consumed. Staff is friendly and ample seating. Most people just order to go once they get their food in the evening time. Spot is BYOB if you feel so inclined.
2017-06-25,5,I'm surprised by the reviews. I order the eggplant parm here all the time and it's delicious. Other things I've had have been similarly good. Delivery usually 30-60 minutes. All good in my book.
2017-06-24,1,If I could give them less than 1 star I would. I don't  even write on things like this but need to let everyone know how ATROCIOUS this customer service was. We ordered through seamless who had a glitch in their system and it said the pizza would be ordered next day when we wanted it right then.  We called seamless told us to speak with the pizza place who said there is nothing that can be done. Seamless refunded us and we placed a new order with Brick directly (giving credit card information and all) another hour later no pizza.   We call back again and they said that since my husband mentioned that it's sad he'll have to give them a bad review over $14 due to the seamless glitch and they then cancelled our order completely AFTER giving them our CC information. Then managers response "since you said you were going to give us a bad review, we didn't think you wanted the order" MIND YOU we already gave them our CC info AGAIN. 2 hours later no pizza. TERRIBLE place for pizza that's not worth it. It's just late and we had no other option. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!
2017-06-22,4,Great place. Very friendly staff and super friendly. Great with kids.We had Tortellini Bolognese which was delish. Sauce had carrots and celery and was not overcomes.The chopped salad was fresh and had a great dressing which tasted home made.The pizza was thin and crunchy and very good. Two thumbs up.
2017-06-17,1,Ugh! Why, oh, why didn't I read reviews on here before ordering from this place?Ok. I order $50 worth of food. I live 4.5 miles away and I'm thinking "hm, they are a tad far." But they charge $2 for delivery and it's late at night. So there's no traffic and it shouldn't take them more than 15-20 min. to get to me, right? Wrong. The food is supposed to be delivered between 11:45 and 11:55 p.m. We call them at 12:05 a.m. to check on it. The woman on the phone said that it is on its way. She doesn't know what time it will get to us and sounds offended that we'd even ask. No apology or anything. 12:30 a.m. I call again. This time she rudely says that the food should be delivered "momentarily." Her: We are located all the way in Hoboken and it takes a long time to get to you.Me: I know that you are located in Hoboken. It takes 15-20 minutes to get to where we are. At this point, our food is 30-40 min. late. So I would like to know a specific time when it would get there. Her: I already told you, it will be there momentarily. Me: I understand that, but it's getting late. We are tired and would like to go to sleep soon...Her (cutting me off): I already told you we are all the way in Hoboken and it's far. I don't know what else to tell you. *** How about the obvious choice in quality customer service - call your delivery person, find out where he is and get back to me? *** Me: Ok. If the food doesn't get delivered to us within the next 15-20 minutes, I'm afraid I'm going to have to cancel the order.Her: Where did you order from?Me: GrubHubHer: I can tell you right now that they aren't going to refund your money.*** REALLY?! Well, I had a surprise for her. ***Me: Ma'am, I'm paying in cash, so I don't need them to refund anything. She paused. Then raised her voice. At this point, I just hung up on her. The food arrived eventually. It was edible. Soggy blanched French fries. Mac & cheese = rotini pasta instead of mac and some white watery sauce instead of cheese. That's the first time I've had "mac & cheese" that tastes like vinegar. I specified "please add REGULAR, not Buffalo chicken" to it. I got spicy Buffalo chicken anyway. The panini I ordered was made with bread so tough, I was afraid I'd chip my teeth or something.All in all - not a good experience. Never again.
2017-05-28,1,Thanks for canceling my order over an hour after I placed it.  The food has always been a solid 3 stars out of 5,  but the overall lack of customer engagement, including the restaurant's failure to respond to negative comments (unacceptable in this day and age), simply indicates the absence of management/ownership.  Sorry but service is paramount in this business and the lack thereof necessitates a single star.
2017-05-27,1,Had a fail with delivery order tonight. Pizza was totally too oily. See napkins used to blot excess oil. And very, very and salty.  Ended up throwing it out.  And the chicken pasta entree that was $15.00 came in a tiny, side salad sized container. We've  ordered from here before and the container was twice the size. Either someone was lazy or this place is getting really cheap.  An entree should come as a full sized portion.  $45.00 wasted!!
2017-05-11,1,First time trying Brick after being a long time Napoli customer (just wanted to try something new).  Only ordered a traditional pizza and wings... 2 hours ago.  Expectation was 40-55 minutes, called after an hour for an update and they assured me it was out for delivery.  30 minutes later we received it, freezing cold.  Called to complain and assured me we would have a new order in 15 minutes.  That was  another 30 minutes ago.  Called again to see and they said out for delivery.  Would have appreciated an honest explanation and at this point, a refund.
2017-04-23,1,Do not order from here- they have the worst food and customer service and manager Mike Aziz is beyond rude and terrible at his job. This is the second time our delivery was late. The first time it was two hours late and the second it was over 40 minutes late. On top of it our order was wrong and cold. one pizza was hard as a rock- as if it had been sitting for hours, another was missing toppings and the sides of pizza sauce, and the bruschetta was just a mess in the box and they definitely use ham even though it's advertised as prosciutto. I have called both times and no matter the day or time they are "always busy" which is why your food is late. They never apologize. Manager Mike Aziz told me that my order isn't a priority because I live in Jersey City and they "prioritize Hoboken orders, that's just the way it is" (mind you we live 1 block outside of Hoboken). When I asked for a refund they stated it was up to Grubhub and they would call- which is the same thing I was told the time my order was 2 hours late, cold, missing items, and I never got a refund. I received no apology just a bunch of excuses and rudeness from Manager Mike. I called GrubHub myself who assured me that the restaurant is in charge of their refunds, not Grubhub. Grubhub managed to get me a full refund. Do not order from here you'll just end up hungry hours later and ordering from somewhere else!
2017-04-11,1,If I could go lower than this I would. I ordered delivery and was estimated to be 30-45 minutes for delivery. Totally acceptable, right?An hour later I called to see if my order was out for delivery yet, but I couldn't even get anyone on the phone after trying to call twice. The third time they said it would be there in 10-15 minutes. I asked if there was a reason for the delay and the women sounded almost offended that I would even ask such a thing and told me that I'm on the other side of where they deliver, which is funny because I'm only a mile and a half away. No apologies, nothing. Finally got the order after waiting over an hour after the estimated delivery time... still. NOTHING. Not that I could have eaten it anyway being that I missed my entire lunch break thanks to them. I called back to get a refund which supposedly I'm getting. I guess they never made it or they are used to this. Needless to say I was hangry today. Definitely not the type of place I'll be going back to. They need to understand that customers are what keeps them open. Treating them like garbage isn't a way to keep them.
2017-03-14,1,I had to wait 3.5 hours for a cold and congealed sandwich. I called 1.5 hours after waiting for my food to be delivered  to hear that the delivery was on its way. After 2.5 hours, I called again (seeing as the restaurant is 3 miles from my house) to hear that it was still being delivered. Really terrible service and pretty awful food. Might have been good if it were warm.
2017-02-19,1,ah pizza is okay. Ordered a large pie on 2 separate occasions and they  didn't fulfill the oreder. I got a lame excuse from the delivery guy. With the delivery charge and the lack of customer service ill go else where. thanks
2017-02-12,1,Order was over an hour late.  Customer service sucked.  Never again.
2017-01-20,1,Absolutely terrible.  Ordered a nacho supreme pizza it came missing all the ingredients. When I called to inquire the first woman who answered seemed to just put the phone down. Eventually a manager picked up and told me there was a new menu but did not clarify exactly what that meant. He said they could send me a new pie but since it was Friday it could take a couple hours. I told him to just refund me the amount for that item. After some resistance, he agreed.  Let's see if it actually comes through. Oh wait, we also ordered another pizza...not sauce, barely any cheese.  The brick panini was tasteless. My GF had to add mayonnaise to give it some flavor.  The chicken fingers at first appeared to be standard frozen breaded chicken but after a closer look, they seemed to be wrapped in a layer of gristle.   Food was on time but cold.  If I had read the reviews in advance we never would have ordered from here.  Especially after seeing price gauging after Sandy.  Never again.
2017-01-03,1,I am really unsure what happened to this place but it has continued to go downhill over the past year.On one occasion I dined in with a friend and it took them 30 minutes to bring us our dessert when there was only a single other table in the restaurant, the server was on her phone, and I had to interrupt her to get service.On another occasion we ordered pizza for delivery. Half Chicken Bacon Ranch, and Half The Brick.  Instead of receiving what we ordered, I got a whole Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza.  We had to call, complain, and then wait another 30-45 minutes for a small The Brick to arrive.About a week and a half ago, I ordered for pick up a large pie half and half and a salad.  Given the mess up before, I really should have checked the pizza before I left, but it couldn't happen twice in a row, right?! WRONG. As soon as I arrived at my friends apartment and opened the box I saw that it was Half Buffalo Chicken and Half Plain when I had ordered Half Buffalo and Half the Brick.  My receipt even had the correct order. But for some reason, the people who make their pizzas are unable to make them according to what the order actually is.I loved the pizza here but the bad service and mistakes every single time I order have really not been worth it.  I will not be coming back.
2016-11-08,1,Rude and miserable old man barely acknowledged my presence after several minutes. After asking what I wanted, finally, I asked if they had plain slices at all. His response was coming right up in an uninterested tone and with no attempt at eye contact. I asked a moment later if it would be 5mins? 10mins? I explained I wasn't meaning to be impatient but I was hungry. He responded with "1 minute", again with no nicety or proper manner about it.When he took the pie from the oven, he cut me the slice with the giant burnt bubble in it. I nearly asked for a different slice that wasn't clearly the runt, but stopped myself because I knew the guy was simply throwing an angry vibe at me. The other person working there rang it up and I left with my burnt/bubbled, avg tasting pizza.Lame. Never going back.
2016-10-08,1,No exaggeration: Don't order from here if you want your food within 2 and a half hours of placing your order.
2016-10-08,1,NEVER ORDER FROM HERE. Ordered food at 5pm. Called restaurant at 6 and said food was on it's way. Called back at 6:30 and they said the order was never made, so they lied on the phone. Awful service.
2016-09-21,1,I've lived in Hoboken for 6 years so I get that we have a real lack of good delivery options, and my expectations are always low.... ;).  BUT this has to be the worst. The spaghetti meatball parmigiana - remember those cans of Heinz alphabet soup spaghetti you had when you were a kid? Well that's what I got. With some crusty meatballs. I guess at least the meatballs weren't out a tin but the rest was. Big insipid mess that I threw straight in the trash. Oh and the chicken carbonara had some pieces of bone for their grade D factory chicken. AVOID.
2016-09-20,1,DO NOT order from here. The worst service I have ever experienced. I called in an order for pick up and came 30 minutes later. The staff asked us to sit because the order was not ready yet. After 40 minutes, they told us it was ready. The staff could not process the credit card machine and when they finally got it to work, they handed us the wrong order. When I asked where the order that we placed 45 minutes ago was, they told us it was on the way and it would be a few more minutes. After waiting another 15 minutes, we were told our order disappeared and that they didn't even start making it. The entire time the whole staff was disheveled and had no idea what was going on and had intention of helping the customer. They didn't offer a solution or an apology. We had to leave the restaurant after waiting over an hour!
2016-09-10,2,I ordered "The Brick Salad", menu shows fresh mozzarella! My salad was missing fresh mozzarella. Thanks
2016-09-05,2,Delivery review - We've ordered from the Brick before, and would say they're usually on par with Napoli's, which is to say the experiences have been very good. Tonight was another story - most of it forgivable.  Delivery took 90 minutes and I'm 4 blocks away - not a huge deal.  One of the pizzas was wrong - not a huge deal. I called to ask about the mistake and see if I could have it corrected, and got passed around and was given instructions about what to do on my next order. What? Still, we're talking about pepperoni here, and we like this place, so we'll get over it, right? Then I bit into a chicken finger, and it was raw.  It's not undercooked, it's RAW.  They all are.  I'm looking at it right now - looks straight out of a Perdue package. There are too many good pizza places in Hoboken to do this again.
2016-08-21,2,Having an order delivered does not mean we as paying customers should be okay with cold food, and waiting 30 min past quoted delivery time (of 1hour) is not professional.  If we dined in your establishment, face to face, please know I would have addressed your management directly with this feedback. P.S. We shouldn't see mostly sauce when we order a sausage, pepper and onion pie.
2016-08-20,3,I order from The Brick a decent amount and their food is good, but tonight I ordered their nacho supreme pizza, and instead of letting me know they were out of guacamole, they delivered it at full price. It's a good place, but this is the first time customer service would have been nice.
2016-07-23,5,Amazing Food!! We sat in the patio and did the BYOB! I started with theBrick Bruschetta!! It tasted amazing even though it was 4 small pieces of toast! I also got the Lettuce Chicken Wrap! That was a smoky chicken flavor but I enjoyed something different! We then ordered a Traditional Cheese Pizza which tasted like a nice oven baked pizza! Nothing crazy about it, just regular pizza! The sweet potato fries where good but there was a spicy dipping sauce I was not crazy about! Now The Brick pasta was savory with a slight spice! I had to order the tiramisu which is home made by the owners wife! It had the traditional Italian flavor with a new twist! Had a cake base taste! I enjoyed all of it!! Our waiter was very helpful! He guided us into what we would enjoy! For it being our 1st time we truly enjoyed this hidden Hoboken GEM!!
2016-07-08,1,Don't support this business. They price gouged during Hurricane Sandy, when more reputable restaurants were giving away their food for free. ($45 for a pizza, are you kidding me?) I know it was years ago, but to take advantage of the community at a time when everyone else was coming together to help their neighbors out, speaks volumes about this business and the people who run it. I won't forget....
2016-06-09,4,We just ordered from The Brick for first time on Seamless and both thought it was great. Not sure what bad reviews are for exactly. We each ordered the grilled salmon with roasted veg and mashed potato sides. Delish! Nice presentation and generous portions. The reason I docked a star is because the food containers arrived in just a plastic bag, without the inner brown paper bag which keeps everything in place. Will order again for sure!
2016-06-01,4,BYOB always nice. Friendly staff. Groupon offer. Apps:Prosciutto Rice Balls: super nice and crispy with a great marinara sauce and decent amount of fillings. The only thing is why was there shredded cheddar in there? It also happen to be the part that didn't melt was more obvious. Pretty good though, the cheddar just confused me. Salad:Chicken Salad with Habanero Ranch: great dressing! Perfect kick of spice, if I could buy it in a bottle, I would. Super crispy chicken, one of the better salads I've had. They know how to get a good crisp on things. Would def get again. Pizza:Margherita: yum! Lots of basil and good sauce! Would def get again. Chicken Pesto: this was disappointing. I couldn't taste the pesto that much and it was a bit bland. Also shredded cheddar again! Why??Bottom line:Would come back again for margherita and chicken salad even if if no groupon.  Please stop using shredded cheddar randomly though!
2016-02-23,3,The Brick had a strong start this summer, and there was actually a buzz about it. My friend and I are both gluten free and their gluten free pizza crusts were the best I've ever had. But slowly, the place has been losing its edge. I called for delivery one night, then got a call back later saying that they were out of the gluten free crusts and would refund my order. When my friend and I went there last month, they were out of Coke (!) , so the manager sent a kid to a bodega to get us the drinks. And the gluten free pizzas were over-cooked and simply not as good as our experience in the summer.We also ordered the steamed garlic mussels, which was described to us as having a hint of tomato, but what we got were mussels drenched in tomato sauce with sliced pepperoni throughout. It was simply awful, to the extent that we couldn't eat it.What's funny is that my neighbor, also gluten free, said the pizzas had gotten terrible (this was before my second visit) and I just couldn't imagine a place so good in August could have fallen so far in just a few months. While I wouldn't call the pizzas terrible, they certainly weren't great anymore and I don't plan to go back for awhile. I appreciate the manager going out of his way to get us our Cokes, but how can an Italian restaurant run out of CocaCola? Or its gluten free crusts? What a shame. It had a fantastic start, but something ran off the rails. I hope they can define the problem and get back on their feet.
2016-02-05,5,Ordered delivery the other day. My salmon, veggies and mashed potatoes were so fresh and tasty. Even the presentation was awesome! Great prices too. Eating here again very soon!
2016-01-24,1,I would never order from here again. The pizza is just okay and the service is terrible. They delivered me the wrong pizza and two hours later I am still waiting from them to deliver the right one. Appalling!
2016-01-20,3,Went back a few times after I first moved here and I have to say, I wasn't as satisfied with my experience here. I'm talking mostly in terms of taste.
2015-12-31,1,My boyfriend and I had reservations for 6:45 on New Year's Eve. We walked in the door. There was 1 family of 4 seated in the whole place. We stood awkwardly for a few minutes at the front door because there was no one to greet us at the door. I went up to the counter and asked if we should seat ourselves. The waitress said yes, to sit wherever. After sitting down and getting a bucket of ice for our wine. The same waitress (and only waitress) said that she was going to move us to a different table. After moving us to a different table, there wasn't any silverware or glasses. The waitress was no where to be found for 15 minutes are so. We had to ask on of the delivery guys for napkins, silverware, and glasses for the wine. After having some wine, the waitress still didn't come over to ask us if we were ready. 30 minutes has now gone by. We saw the busboy taking orders from a table that came in after us. We had to grab him to order our entrees. My boyfriend had the lemon chicken and I had the Athletic penne. Our food took about 40 minutes to come out. After that everything went smoothly. The food was good. Fast forward. I am currently sitting in the ER as my boyfriend and I have food poisoning. It hit my boyfriend much worse and much earlier than me. He was in excruciating pain, vomiting and dry heaving. The EMT'S assured that he had a pretty bad case of food poisening. I have diarrhea. My boyfriend does not have many stomach issues, ever. He also has a high tolerance for pain. I have never seen him so distraught. I would like everyone to be aware of what we have experienced so that others may take precautions.
2015-12-06,1,I'm from New Jersey, but I'm not a pizza elitist.  However, when I order a buffalo chicken pizza I expect to receive a buffalo chicken pizza.  Instead, they sent a pizza topped with only mushrooms.  In addition, the delivery guy asked for a tip after I already included it on my order (via delivery.com).  When I called up to complain about the mushrooms, they chalked it up to me being drunk just because I called in late.  I am never ordering from there again and strongly recommend others to avoid it as well.  Best $25 I ever spent. (Sarcasm.)
2015-12-02,4,Never tried this place before, decided to step in- very friendly staff and clean place! Good ambiance. ATM in here, too (they take credit though, no worries).This review is not about the pizza, btw.Stuffed mushrooms are so worth it. Not greasy, don't fall apart easily, and pretty big. They only give you three, though... So if you're not in a group of three, expect some damaged relationships.I got the lemon chicken as an entree, pretty good. They didn't have two of the pastas I chose, which is concerning but whatever. I asked for no tomato but got it on my dish anyway- I had to fork them out and put them into my boyfriend's chicken parm. The dish itself, once de-tomato-fied, was pretty good. Sour to savory ratio was perfect, sauce kind of too thin, and plenty of mushrooms. I like mushrooms. If only I had stopped finding so much tomato under everything. It was like I was being punked.My boyfriend liked his chicken parm, but he'll eat anything that tastes okay, so it doesn't count.For dessert, they were out of two of their four (that's half). They had a sign out for smores pizza which I had to get, of course, so I opted for a small one and tried to put the fact that they had no tiramisu and key lime pie at 2pm out of my mind.The staff is so friendly that they went to go buy ingredients for the smores pizza btw, because they don't have any of that either... so I'm going to be understanding... Not sure what to think of that. No food vs having such great service that they go out to buy the ingredients. But then again, unpreparedness. Plus now we'll have to wait. I suggest to not advertise the product if you don't have it. HOWEVER ONCE IT WAS SERVED TO US, IT WAS GREAT! Weird how they put graham crackers on it instead of somehow incorporating them into the crust, but still really really good. How can you go wrong with roasted marshmallows and chocolate anyway?Bottom line: good, but pricy. Won't be back here in a while, but will be looking forward to it.
2015-10-31,1,Do not order from here ! I ordered delivery from here and it took over 2 hours. We had to call two times and on both occasions they said it would be there in 10 minutes which clearly was a lie. When the food got here it was cold. And besides being cold it was not good. The salads were not good. The pizza is average ...nothing to wait 2 hours for. There are definitely better places in Hoboken and I will never order from here again.
2015-10-14,5,For gluten free people who are missing pizza, I highly recommend this place. They are my gluten free pizza salvation! Best I've had, and I've tried many. My go-to's are the brick and the tomato basil, which I add grilled chicken to - both are great. I'm sure their other GF pizzas are great too. Enjoy!!!
2015-10-09,1,I truly don't know why I continue to order from this place, probably b/c it's not the only edible gluten free pizza in town. However tonight is the last night. After waiting 1.5 hours for delivery, getting cold pizza and having ordered an app that they apparently "forgot to include" but still charged me for, I'm officially done. This place is absolutely awful. The customer service is beyond atrocious. Don't even bother with Brick. Go to one of the 100 other pizza places in Hoboken.
2015-09-16,5,I never have posted a reviewOn yelp but I have to defend The Brick because I have no idea what these people are talking about with the negative reviews. This place is awesome and I am not easy to please! We have been ordering from them about once a week and have never been disappointed. The pastas a delicious, the salads are fresh and the Nutella cannoli is to die for! On top of that, the management is super friendly and delivery always fast enough.
2015-08-28,5,Absolutely love this place. Come here at least once a week. Great staff, food, atmosphere, and price. Not a single thing on their menu is bad. Fries are especially fantastic, as well as all the pastas.
2015-07-30,1,Wow I really like the food  usually. but it took 2 and half hours and food is still not delivered !
2015-06-11,3,The brick isn't horrible. It is a lot better than Molfetta that was their before, which was terrible. I don't know if it's the same owners or not but the quality has gone way up.It is basically a Napoli's type lay out. I imagine it's tough with Napoli's next door, which is why I am surprised they kept the pizza theme being one door down. I can't comment on anything but pizza from here however.I usually swing by sometimes for lunch when the stroller mafia has taken over Napolis. They have similar deals, 2 regular slices and a soda for $5 and 2 specialty slices and a soda for $7 (plus tax on both). Their regular slice is pretty decent, nothing amazing but pretty good average plain slice. No complaints there, they are usually a good size too. Bigger than Napolis give you when you get a regular slice. Their buffalo slice however is outstanding! This is really the winner here, if they are out of that is usually when I switch to regular slices. Really though, try their buffalo slice it is really good and very, very hearty. You will be full!Overall not bad, and A-OK with me.
2015-06-09,4,The second best pizza spot in Hoboken, I think. It's not the wispy, margherita style that seems to be popular in town but a legit slice of pizza. I haven't had anything else from here except the Tiramisu, which is good but not top notch.
2015-05-25,4,Love this place! We order from them regularly for work meetings. It's one of my favorites in Hoboken! It is a little pricier than usual for pizza which is the only reason I won't give them 5 stars! The prosciutto, pear, Gorgonzola pizza is AMAZING, something different but so so good. Their Sicilians are just perfect, crunchy, cheesy, great sauce! They even have Nutella dessert pizza! Great to share (small one is enough for 4-6 people) even tho they say it's for 2-3.
2015-05-07,1,I am on my third day of dying with food poisoning and the last thing I ate was a chicken parm dinner from this place. Half way into eating the meal I felt my stomach kind of turning but it wasn't until the next morning that my first vomit session occurred. The chicken parm looked good and tasted decent, so I would of had no way of knowing. I'm not sure if this was just a freak occurrence on Bricks part but every since Tuesday AM I have been violently sick and have not had any relief since. Ended up going to urgent care and the doctor agreed that my symptoms aligned with food poisoning. Safe to say I will never come back here again. As for the rest of you, the choice is yours. Being this sick is not fun,  choose wisely.
2015-03-03,1,Ordered at 10:56 am.....it is12:31 noon and still no delivery.  Would rate the food, but it hasn't arrived yet.  Will NOT be ordering from them again.  I should be reimbursed at least half of my total order.
2015-02-25,1,The pizza is above average but the delivery time is abysmally slow.   I live a few blocks away and the wait time for delivery is over an hour every time.  It's often an hour and a half.  I have experienced this over a dozen times.I recently had a conversation with a woman who answered the phone and I nicely explained that they should consider more delivery people or a better system to support incoming orders.  Her response was unintelligible  - something to the effect of "like... we take orders and cook the pizza...when we took the pizza."   She did not believe an hour and a half wait time for their pizza was excessive.  This place probably won't be around long because it is not well run.  I'm at a point where I can not support them commercially.
2015-02-13,1,Without a doubt the worst delivery service ever.  2 HOURS for pizza is ridiculous! AND the pizza is mediocre at best.  Girl on the phone said "sir we're just really busy". GREAT customer service guys!
2015-01-31,1,I was really looking forward to eating here after reading previous reviews.I ordered the brick oven pizza with fresh mozzarella, pepperoni, mushrooms and gluten-free crust. First, the delivery guy was late, which I overlooked, because I was so excited to try this incredible pizza. Then I took my first bite, and noticed how salty & greasy it was. I pulled the toppings off, and...ugh...still salty. I called and spoke to the manager. He said that it was my toppings that made it salty. He offered me a free pie only if I re-order & pay for a new pie first. That's Nuts! My order was $35 w/o tip. Never again will I pay for another meal here. I get hyper tension just thinking about it. Ugh!
2015-01-30,1,This place is a poor mans Napolis !Nasty . They put out the pizza that didn't sell the night before for the next day.
2015-01-23,1,I really don't like giving bad reviews. "Eek! Methinks not."  is the caption that appears when one gives a one star review on GrubHub.  Sorry, Brick, (I'm not sorry) but the food was awful.  I will admit that I ordered late, at 11pm, but if they didn't want to make me a decent $30 meal they could have called and said their kitchen was closed..or something...anything...anything but what they delivered to me.  The panini was a stale piece of chicken on white bread.  I don't know if they even bothered pressing it, but it didn't matter.  There was a soft piece of lettuce and a slovenly amount of chipotle mayo as if that would make up for the nothingness that was the sandwich. The chicken wings were cold and soggy.  My thoughts, 'invest in one of those red heat bags.'The tiramisu was...well...my fault - I should have known better than to order tiramasu from a place like this (though how would I, having never ordered from here before).  What's the point of having something on the menu if it's this bad.  It should have been thrown out days ago.  The cake was old to say the least.  It had, over much time I presume, turned a pale greenish color: inedible...so I didn't eat it.The simple answer is DO NOT DELIVER FOOD IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE THE TIME TO MAKE IT DECENTLY.  $30 for a meal may not be a lot for some, but for someone in the service industry like myself it is.
2015-01-03,4,Awesome specialty slices and good service. Great buffalo chicken, barbecue chicken slices. Better pizza than Napolis.
2015-01-01,1,I ordered the brick panini for delivery and it was terrible. The only good thing was the honey mustard sauce which hid the taste of the dry slab of chicken. The bread was not grilled but instead hard, barely any cheese and half a piece of bacon that was not "crispy" as stated on the menu. I will not be ordering anything but pizza from here again.
2014-12-29,1,If you order takeout and prefer receiving your food to come in less than 2 hours at a reasonable temperature, The Brick isn't the place for you.  Called after one hour, at which point the woman on the other line said that the delivery guy was on his way and immediately hung up. Fast forward another 45 minutes, at which a second phone call revealed that the driver was purportedly in the immediate vicinity and would be arriving momentarily.  Tack on another twenty minutes and the delivery driver arrives at the door...with the wrong food order. Upon telling him of this, he asked us to hold on so that he could run to his car to retrieve the correct, albeit small portioned and cold, order. Did I mention this was on a Monday evening (not the weekend) and we live a mile from the restaurant?
2014-12-05,1,Terrible service and horrible pizza! We placed our order at 7:52 pm and we were told a 45 minute wait. Called them after 1 hour (at 8:52pm) and the lady said that the delivery guy was leaving in 2 minutes. Guess what, the pizza was delivered at 9:38pm!!! Of course it was completely cold, soggy and on top of that, salty. They just lost a customer. Don't waste your time there!
2014-11-22,5,Pizza gets 5 stars! Original, crispy, flavorful and great staff! Try the chicken bacon ranch, nacho supreme, and BBQ chicken with Gouda...
2014-10-28,3,Ordered take-out from The Brick last weekend, and was pretty pleased with the end result. I started with the Rustica salad which was quite rich, but also quite good. They do not skimp on the prosciutto which is appreciated, but it's also not the BEST quality that I have had. The rest of the ingredients (grapes, arugula, gorgonzola, etc.) were all good complements to each other and tasted fresh, even though it was a take-out salad.Followed this up with the Southern Style Pizza which is just a Barbecue Chicken Pizza w/ Gouda slices. The pizza itself is OK. The crust, cheese, and chicken were all fine - nothing spectacular, but not bad (seeing a theme here...), but I don't really understand why the gouda was included on top. It's not really a great complement to the other ingredients on the pizza, and I thought it was a bit odd that a "Southern Style" pizza was accented with a Dutch cheese. Experimenting gone pointless, I guess? Didn't make the slice BAD, but certainly didn't add anything.I don't know if I will order from here again. Like I have noted, there isn't anything wrong with The Brick, but there are better options for the type of food that they serve.
2014-10-19,1,Would never step foot in this place again after their Hurricane Sandy price gouging. Of course this  was under their old name, Molfettas.
2014-09-22,5,This place is simply amazing. My friends and I waltzed passed The Brick after some time at Pier13 and wanted to grab something quick before heading out for the night. We looked at the menu and it seemed like a standard pizza place but the thing that really hooked us was the waiter who told us to come sit down. I assume this is the same waiter who has gotten honorable mentions on here before, but ours was named Jonny. We had a few drinks at the Pier and wanted to keep drinking, Jonny offered to run down to the liquor store and get us whatever we wanted. Way over the top service. We ordered jalapeno poppers (they are wrapped in bacon, yum!), Chicken bacon ranch pizza, and The Brick panini. Jonny suggested that my friend substitute mozeralla cheese for the cheddar on the panini which he agreed to and found it to be fantastic. The pizza was fresh and crunchy with tasty ingredients. Oh did I mention it was one of the chef's birthday's so they gave us a free slice of birthday cake? The Brick offered service that I haven't experienced in a long time and will certainly be returning soon. Thanks for the great service Jonny! The price tag (alcohol excluded) was only $33 for an appetizer, panini, and pizza. Pretty great in my opinion!
2014-09-12,3,Overpriced.  Food is good but not THAT good.  This place needs to check itself with the prices it charges for things like jalapeño poppers..$8 for 3 poppers...give me a break.
2014-09-04,4,We went to The Brick for a double date with a couple that was newly engaged.  We ordered the Margharita Pizza (yum), Crispy Calamari, Caprese Bruschetta, and Shrooms (stuffed mushrooms) for the four of us to share.  The pizza was thin and the crust was crunchy, just how I like it.  The ingredients tasted fresh and everything that came out of The Brick's kitchen to our table that night was delicious.To top it off, our server was phenomenal.  I wish I could remember his name so I could give him a shout out here but he made our double date experience a lot of fun.  We enjoyed his service and attentiveness to our table.  Oh and this place is BYOB (like a lot of places in Hoboken).
2014-08-10,1,Horrendous. Absolutely horrendous. We order online from (blank).com, which was offering a discount for the day. After an hour we called to check on the order status. I was told: "the delivery guy is about to leave". Wut? After an hour? My instinct was to cancel. After I suggested that, I was told/promised the deliver would arrive in no less than ten minutes. Okay. I guess we'll wait. Ten minutes became twenty and so we really cancelled. The delivery called finally but a cancel is a cancel. Well, decided to call (blank).com to complain. I was told that within ten minutes (can you guess where this is headed?) the food would be headed over gratis.  We had already started cooking dinner, but gratis is gratis. Even if cold the gesture was appreciated. Ten became twenty again. Called the driver. Food had ended up gratis for another customer. I guess I was mistaken when I was told we'd be the recipients (and the email we got from (blank).com must've been in error). In any case, at this point, too livid to care. Notwithstanding the x% discount from (blank).com for my next order, I cannot bear punishing myself again. Hoboken has enough places to order from. If a place can't even give away food properly, I'm not sure I can trust them. (To be fair, they did offer to remake the order.  But after two hours this did not seem worth it.)
2014-08-06,4,We went there around 5pm and we were the only one there. We ordered  sweet potato fries, calamari, shrimp scampi and half of magarita and half of vagetable pizza (dont remember the name).Shrimp scampi came with rice not with noodle  but it was  good. Calamari and fries were just ok. the pizza was really good love the dough its really crispy and soft and full of flavor. We actually order small size of another pie for to go .* the waiter ( forgot his name) was SUPER nice, really enthusiastic over his job and friendly.  Gave a good tip :) 3for the food 5 for the waiter :)
2014-08-05,3,BYOB which is a huge plus! Big menu with lots to choose from, and a lot of creative pizzas. We had the bruschetta (so good with fresh bread and tomatoes!) and the pesto pizza - good but very oily. Would give it another try, but will be hard to break my Napolis habit!!
2014-08-04,1,I don't currently have a US phone (I was living overseas). I've used Eat24 in the last month for delivery without an issue as the delivery people came to the door and I always made sure to be downstairs and visible (the area is well lit) to avoid any issue. Today, I went downstairs at 1030 and waited until about 1105. I did see a car with two men in it, but the onus is not on me to approach a car with two men. Neither came to the door, neither ever got out of the car. Neither asked if I had ordered food. They were visible enough that I saw the glare from their phone. I have in my delivery note that I would come downstairs and did do. Delivery should be, at the bare minimum, to the door, no effort was made and it is not ok for the company (The Brick) to have this poor level of service.
2014-03-19,1,Total waste of time and money.   No improvement in the service or the food since this place was called Molfettas.  Guess this is just a ploy to "re-brand" themselves after they price gouged during hurricane sandy.  Oh...they totally ripped off Napoli's design and color scheme. (which is 2 doors down)  Nice try guys.
2014-03-14,5,I have ordered and picked up from here several times.  Everything is fresh and super flavorful, the porterhouse pizza is a favorite but honestly I can't say one bad thing about anything else on the menu from the salads to the pasta, a very welcome addition to the uptown neighborhood!
2014-03-14,5,Order the baked potato pizza!! Absolutely amazing. it tastes just like potato skins on pizza, which may sound weird but is beyond good. Great service and it's BYOB.
2014-03-13,5,The food was amazing... Had stuff mushroom for the first time! Omg!!!! Yummy!!!! Main course  which you must try was fettuccine & shrimp....delicious....and the tiramisu was out of this world.  The place is clean, the Staff is friendly and the chef came out for a greet and meet. I will def. Come back again especially that is a byob. Big plus!
2014-03-07,3,Pizza-only review.The Brick is a newly-renovated pizzeria at the former location of Molfetta. What was once pretty much a slice joint, is now a nicer, sit down BYOB pizzeria, nicely furnished with about ten tables and a pleasant decor all around. The construction is a major improvement.I had a margarita pizza, which I thought was decent. They are getting a good char at the bottom of the pie, yet the crust/dough was a bit flat in taste. The fresh mozzerella and tomato sauce were good, but still, the sauce needs something, maybe roasted garlic or more oregano. Good but could be better.The staff I encountered were pleasant and courteous. I wish them well in this competitive market.  In addition to pizza, they have a variety of entrees and sandwiches available.
2014-03-05,5,Great pizza, great guys. I love it so much more than Napoli. The Ranch dressing is fabulous! Next time I am going to get the strawberry salad. The server gave me a sample of the dressing and it was amazing. I will be back many more times!
2014-02-22,5,I had an amazing experience with the BBQ pizza. The ingredient and the crust were amazing.Delivery on Friday night was under 40 minutes. I spoke to the managers there and they seemed very friendly and really nice. They are taking over their fathers place and they have renovated the place to be one of hoboken's landmark. The place was there for over 20 years.This place is amazing specially with new delicious dishes.
2014-02-21,1,Here's what this place is crap with a new wrapping let's explain this was previously Molfettas the worst crap food in Hoboken. I thank god hurricane sandy hit because it's what actually drove this place to close shop because they were dumb enough to rip off their own community by price gouging. Alas they spent some money they made by ripping people off on a shiny new sign and furniture instead of actual good food. Guess what you get when you wrap a big turd in shiny wrapping paper? a big fin turd or in this case molfetta 2 aka the brick so if you like to eat turds come here for a new shiny turd
2014-02-14,1,to everyone that lives in hoboken, please do not bother.  This is just another pizza place that is not that great.  There is nothing brick oven about this pizza and the sauce is super sweet and the crust was soft.Just eat at the pizza places you like, this is not worth your time
2014-02-13,1,I ordered pick up. Very friendly on the phone. Food was not good at all. I had the scallops which were not fresh and small. The riscotto was the best thing from that dish. I also ordered lettuce wrap and chicken marsala. Not good at all... would not order from this place again, unless I want to try there pizza.
2014-02-09,3,I've only had the pizza here and have ordered it twice now. The pizza is just okay. For anywhere outside of the immediate NYC metro area, it'd be pretty good pizza. But since we're talking about Hoboken where there seem to be pizza places on every other block, you better be pretty darn good if you want to stay in business. Especially with the location they chose, they've got Napoli's just a couple of doors down and Johnny Pepperoni's a couple of blocks away. Let's start with the good. They delivered our pizza on Super Bowl Sunday within 30 minutes of ordering. Maybe this is because they're new but it's still pretty amazing that they were able to do this.We got a margherita and a sausage+garlic. They were both pretty good but the crust was just too chewy and not crispy enough. I thought having the nice crispy crust was why you have a brick oven! We ordered again a week later and the crust was the same, so the soft, chewy crust was not a fluke. Crisp up your crust and maybe I'll reconsider but until then, I'm sticking with Napoli's. Or you could try reopening your business to fill a restaurant need that isn't completely saturated in Hoboken... ;)
2014-02-05,2,I was excited to see another restaurant open nearby. Ordered the eggplant parmigiana and pasta primavera.  Both were oily, mushy and bland. My wife would give our order one star. I heard the pizza was ok.  The only reason I could see going here over Napoli's (on this block) would be for a slice, as they seem to have more pies out, especially later in the night.
2014-02-04,1,Went in for a slice or two.  The displayed pies looked a little long in the tooth, but the waitress assured me they were fresh.  Looks were not deceiving.  The slices  were soggy and the crust a little stale.  Too bad, as I had High hopes.  The north end pizza places need to understand that they need to toss their pies after a few hours because the money they save by serving old pizza is dwarfed by the business they lose by serving it.
2014-02-02,5,This is the best pizza place in Hoboken, on par with Grimaldi.  I do not say that lightly, as I have been a discerning and dedicated fan of Grimaldi's for 3 years.  The Brick pizzas are thin crust, lovingly sprinkled with just the right amount of ingredients.  The ultimate test of a pizza restaurant are not their fancy pizzas,  but the basics.  I fell in love with the Brick margarita.  Just like the plain Grimaldi pizza it is just flawless.   Not too much crust, every ingredient is fresh, the seasoning is just right.  You'd think every pizza restaurant could make something that is deceptively simple - and yet only 2 out of dozens of Hoboken pizzerias manage to.Of course if you are not like me you can choose from many different creative pizza styles or make your own.  Prices are very low.  The service is remarkably good - I've had much worse service at $200+/person restaurants.  The chef is friendly and he takes great pride in his trade.
2014-01-31,1,Ordered 2 pies online at 6:30 on a Friday with a 30-45 minute delivery estimate. After an hour, I called and was told the driver had just left. Called 20 minutes and was told the driver had just left. Called another 15 minutes and was told the driver had delivered it. To someone else. The owner then promised to hand-deliver the pizzas in 25 minutes. 45 minutes later and we're still waiting. Luckily my wife is 5 months pregnant and is super patient when she hasn't eaten what she wants after waiting for 3 hours. I'm going to raise my own cow to make cheese and grow some wheat to make my own crust. It'll be faster than waiting for this.
2014-01-30,5,Absolutely delicious and the delivery man was so nice! I ordered a pizza as well, and they do not charge more for Whole Wheat crust which is amazing! Also, perfect portion sizes! I would recommend this place to anyone in Hoboken.  It is a pleasant surprise since there are so many subpar restaurants in Hoboken.
