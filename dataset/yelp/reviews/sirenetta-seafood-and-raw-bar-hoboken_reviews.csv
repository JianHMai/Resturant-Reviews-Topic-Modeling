2021-11-10,5,We had a fantastic meal at Sirenetta.  The oysters were so fresh and delicious accompanied by the sparkling wine flight. The octopus appetizer was delightful, perfectly cooked with newly introduced flavors. Dinner was a difficult decision to make.  Menu offerings were so interesting.  We decided on the Frutti de Mar, which was so much better than the usual red sauce offering, and the squid ink linguine. My husband and I tried to determine the interesting flavors with each bite.  Amazing!  We chose the Sirenetta il Bianco which paired beautifully with our meals.  We can't wait to return to taste more of your menu.
2021-10-28,5,The food at Sirenetta is delicious. The portions albeit small are filling and flavorful. The wait staff, especially the manager is extremely attentive. The squid ink pasta is a must!
2021-10-08,4,Good atmosphere and drinks. Staff was friendly. Enjoyed the indoor setting next to the open windows, nice mix between indoor and outdoor as well as being further away from traffic.Would recommend
2021-10-04,3,We made a reservation for 3 people on a Sunday night.  The restaurant was half full.  A seafood raw bar is next to the main bar and had a board with prices for various seafood and shellfish.  King crab legs were $37 for 1/2 pound, which we ordered.  We also had spicy shrimp, caesar salad, butter salad, broiled oysters and raw oysters.  All were very good and we did not feel we overpaid  for the food and experience.  We ordered seafood pasta and beef ragu pasta.  Both were delicious and the portion were acceptable but on the small side.  The reason I gave 3 stars is because of the size and quality of portions for the $37 king crab legs.  A few splinters of legs and 3 knuckle pieces were underwhelming and offensive.  We ordered wine that nobody came over to pour after the first one and nobody came to wipe the tables in between courses.  We had seafood drippings all over the table.  They also do not supply wetnaps or hand wipes.  This is a seafood raw bar.  Overall, service needs to improve, food portions have to be more consistent and they owners have to make the customers feel the food and experience justifies the prices.  ($130 pp with tip)
2021-09-25,3,Very pretty. Enjoy the ambience. The downfall is that they are not accommodating to any "special" requests. I can't eat seafood so I asked for the pasta seafood dish without the seafood. Should be easy enough to just give the pre made pasta. But they wouldn't so I just ate t some biscuit rolls for dinner.
2021-09-18,1,Tried to have lunch here today. The place looks very nice, but every time my friend and I tried to order something they didn't have it. The paper menu wasn't correct. The online menu wasn't correct. The server wasn't sure what they had and couldn't tell us. After trying to order two or three times we decided to pay for our sodas and leave. It's a shame because the place is beautiful and the menu looks nice. If only it was available. After this level of incompetence I have no intention of returning.
2021-09-11,2,Was really excited to try this place but services and food were very basic. Not worth the price.
2021-08-29,5,Amazing dinner that wowed us all. Lol e the raw bar, pasta and gelato desserts. Bravo!
2021-08-24,3,I had been looking forward to dining at Sirenetta for a while now, as I love Sorellinas. That said, the experience left a lot to be desired. Overall, I thought the food was good, but the service was less than great. I do understand the predicament most restaurants are currently in with being short staffed, but it wasn't a particularly busy evening (we dined on a Monday) and so I cannot imagine what service is like when it's packed. We sat outside and had to ask for our server several times in order to get a single ticket in. It took about 20 minutes just to have him take our drink order. The other interesting thing was that none of the servers knew what tables were supposed to get what food. I thought that was overall pretty odd. I also noticed that the manager (or I'd assume that's who that was), was pretty rude and cold. I think it would have been appreciated had he stopped over, acknowledged it was a "night" and thanked us for our patronage. Instead, he dropped food to our table without even saying so much as "enjoy." He felt rude. Overall, it was surprising that a simple dinner on a Monday night (sans desert) took almost 3 hours to complete solely because of the staff (not even because of cook time, which is always understandable when fresh).I hope to come back and try again because I love the concept and the menu is beautiful. Just think the kinks need to be worked out.
2021-08-21,1,This review is only for the service since we unfortunately never got to try the food. Long story short: this restaurant is only for those who want to exercise their white privilege.We had an 8:30pm reservation for a group of 3 females. We arrived on time, the restaurant was packed, the hostess said our table wouldn't be ready for another 20 minutes, but that we could enjoy cocktails in the back lounge while we waited. We agreed and ordered a round of drinks, which were great. We finally received a text at 9:05 that our table was ready, so we closed our bar tab and proceeded to reception. On the way, we noticed every table was still packed and that nothing seemed ready to be sat. We checked back in with the host stand and the two employees at reception started whispering to one another. We overheard one say she had just given our table to a walk-in party, so the other one whispered back "just have them sit at the bar." They proceed to ask us if we wanted to eat at the bar and we said no, we want to be sat for our reservation. Then they said we had to wait at the front bar because nothing was available at the moment. Frustrated, we walked to the front bar only to be told by the bartenders that we couldn't sit there because the seats were "reserved". At this point, we were extremely annoyed with the runaround so we left. We just so happened to be the only minority party in a room full of caucasian customers, so we couldn't help but feel like this was a blatant act of discrimination. Not once did any of the hosts offer us an apology for the wait or admit the mistake of giving away our table. They treated us as if WE were inconveniencing THEM. We had an 8:30pm reservation that deserved to be honored and Sirenetta left us feeling slighted.
2021-08-20,5,Was looking for a great place for appetizers and this place did not disappoint. Have the best lobster biscuits around. Sat at the bar and what a great experience. The service was awesome and will definitely be coming back. I recommend to make a reservation!
2021-08-17,1,manager is rude to customers and employees! He raised his voice and was condescending to my table and when I got up to go to the bathroom I saw him yelling at all of the staff (seemed like he was having a breakdown). Entirely unprofessional.
2021-08-14,4,Really enjoyed my experience here with two friends for a girls night. Our party had the shrimp and fries all which was AWESOME, the branzino entree, salmon entree and I had lobster rigatoni as shown in the pic. The only thing was the lobster was very dry which was a bummer :(Our service was really good, enjoyed our waiter as he was attentive and kind. We all enjoyed our drinks, they were really good. I got the Paloma and another one with mezcal but can't recall the name. Inside vibe is really cute- nice for a casual or a dressed up day/night out. I would definitely be back.
2021-08-13,2,My friend and I were really looking forward to coming here to try the seafood. We ordered our drinks- which were delicious, and split 4 appetizers between the two of us. Somehow, we still managed to be very hungry as the portions were very small. We got a dozen clams, but they must have been the smallest clams we have ever had. We also got the baked brie, lobster biscuits and scallops with pork belly. The baked brie was probably the best thing on the table but again, very small. I would not recommend sharing this dish with more than two people. The service was great and the drinks were good. I personally, do not care to come again and spend the $$$ on stuff that could have been better.
2021-08-09,4,I love seafood, so I was thrilled when Sirenetta opened.  However, I kept hearing mixed reviews about it, similar to the contrasting feedback I had received about its sister restaurant across the street, Sorellina.  Well, I managed to try Sirenetta first and really enjoyed it!My friend and I met for dinner and decided to sit in their outdoor space, which may have been why our service was so slow.  Now, don't get me wrong; our servers were extremely nice and knowledgeable, but it just took so much time for our food to arrive.  I started my meal with a custom cocktail from their impressive drink list, which also included mocktails and alcohol-free beer!  While I was amazing to see these thoughtful options, I went with the traditional "hard stuff".  My Pantera Rosa was by far one of the best beverages I have had in Hoboken.  The cocktail started with housemade, jalapeno-infused tequila that was paired with fresh strawberry puree and lime juice.  It was spicy and tart with just the perfect amount of sweetness.  Sadly, the restaurant did not offer any bread to enjoy while we waited for our meals, though we were able to snag some thin, long breadsticks that had been sprinkled with salt and black sesame.  My Grilled King Salmon entree finally arrived, and I loved it!  The fish was cooked perfectly and was seasoned with hints of blood and cara cara orange.  The reasonably sized filet was served over Italian escarole, which kept the dish light and healthy.  I really enjoyed Sirenetta and would definitely count myself on the pro side of the reviewers.  In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I went back a few days later for another Pantera Rose.  We sat at the busy bar on that Saturday evening, which was definitely more of a buzzy environment than I had initially experienced on the quiet outdoor Monday night.  Either way, I found it a terrific addition to the town's restaurant scene.
2021-08-08,4,Great food, loved the swordfish Milanese and the steak. Bartenders are fantastic as well- super friendly. Hostess was not good- we got there at exactly our reservation, she looked around (place was half empty) and said it will be a few minutes. Sure that's fine, so we sat at the bar for a drink. 15 mins later we realize the hostess is no where to be seen- I got up and tell the new hostess (who is also a manager) that we have been waiting for 15+ mins. She looks at me and says that hostess is on her break now. No real apology or anything to make up for their error. In my opinion their service at front of the house leaves a very bad impression, but the food is good so I just rolled with the punches. Will be back but will try to avoid the icy glares from the hostess counter. Smile more guys!
2021-08-06,4,The seafood is awesome. Portions are small and expensive, tand the atmosphere is missing that certain something, but service is good, and the food is awesome. They had the best cocktail sauce for the oysters, which were also amazing; and the salmon, though a bit salty, was perfect. How imaginative to include peas, squash, and other veg with the Salmon. Who knew oysters grew in Minnesota???? They were good. A tad expensive at 3.50 each, but very very good. I wasn't crazy about the vignette. I think the vinegar they use was too sweet. The tuna tartare , which is played out in general but one of my favorites, was worth it as well. I was so impressed.  Maybe they darken the lights later in the evening but this and Sorallina across the street should be staples on Washington Street.
2021-08-02,2,We were thoroughly unimpressed with the service tonight. The server was plenty nice but was alone outside and did not check on us as much as they should have. We were only asked about drinks twice and I would have enjoyed more cocktails. And one of our meals came out cold after a long wait. The food was fine but absolutely not worth the time and frustration
2021-07-29,5,Place is owned by same people as Sorrelina across the street.   I had not been as opened during pandemic.I finally went as was open on Monday when many places are closed.  Was also open past 9 and though covid rules are done the mentality lives on. We sat at the bar which is our preferred seating and happy to do as even as indoor seating returned that did not as places kept with the high tops near the bar.  The bartender Brooks was great.   The food was also as got three good dishes and dessert was so good ordered a second.We will he back.
2021-07-25,2,Waited very long for drinks. Got our entree before we got our drinks. Food came out all at random times. They are clearly understaffed and the owners should invest more in their current restaurants instead of just opening more. Food was decent but stingray lounge across the street is a much better seafood place overall.
2021-07-21,3,What an interesting evening my party of 4 had at this establishment. Located on the main street, parking is a bust. You can attempt to find street parking (metered) but it could take you awhile or you can find a paid lot, which can run you a pretty penny. Seating is offered inside and outside. The inside dining area is quite large and definitely gives you a cool vibe, super cute for date night, while the outside area is smaller (less than 10 tables). 2/3 FoodFor appetizers, we ordered the baked brie and the tiger prawns. The baked brie was honestly the best item of the entire evening, the crust with the gooey cheese that agrodolce sauce, to die for. As a place that claims it is a seafood/raw bar, the tiger prawns were overcooked and the actual meat was tough to eat. It tasted as though it was cooked hour prior and kind of just sat there. For the main entrees, we ordered the swordfish milanese and the Caribbean yellow snapper. The swordfish was just fresh, light and perfectly seasoned, my only complaint was the plating. I guess right after the fish came out the fryer, whoever plated the dish added the arugula and tomato directly on top of it while it was still hot, which is pretty to serve but cause the arugula to get wilted and lose its freshness. My SO loved his dish with zero complaints. 0.5/1 Service The biggest issue I had with this experience was the service. When I arrived and went inside to check in, I stepped up to the hostess, SHAUNTAL, we made eye contact and our conversation went like this:Me: "Hi, I have a reservation for 6:30 for xyz.? Her: "Ok, and?" with  an attitude. Me: "Ok, and I am here?"Her: "Oh I see that. Let me seat this party and come back to you." So I stepped outside to meet the other people in my party, and now we are just standing outside in-front of the front door so we don't take up room within the actual dining room. The hostess proceeded to walk pass us and made eye contact again and ignore us. So now, my SO's Godfather walks in and explains again that if we can be seated, and the hostess starts rolling her eyes at him as though we are bothering her. So finally, we are being walked to our table and we were deciding between which table we wanted (under a tree or not) and her response was "Well, it doesn't really matter, its like the same thing, the sun is setting anyways." with such a irritated tone as though I we have been arch enemies for the last 50 years. As a hostess, you are the first impression to customers, if you hate your job, please don't take it out on your customers. However, our server, Jeff, an absolute angel. He was super outgoing, friendly, and engaging. Literally, he is what saved this review from being complete shit tbh. 0.5/1 Price For the location, the prices were understandable. However, such we got weird service vibes, it wasn't worth it in my opinion. You go out and spend a few hundred dollars on dinner, you want to be treated nice from the moment you walk into the establishment til when you leave, not some 50/50 bs.
2021-07-18,5,Love the menu & chef & staff . Excellent flavors all around -5 Stars XO
2021-07-11,4,I made reservations for me and one of my girlfriends for 1pm. When I arrived I was lucky to find parking. Parking on Sundays in Hoboken is terrible. I walked in and told the hostess I was there for reservations and she sat us. I really liked the decor of the restaurant. We were served by Zack and he was nice. When he wasn't around another real nice young lady helped serve us. For appetizers my friend ordered the lobster biscuit. I tasted it and it was tasty but too cheesy. For entrées my friend ordered the lobster all'amatriciana and I ordered the salmon burger. My friend really enjoyed her meal. The salmon burger wasn't bad. It was big and filling though. The bill came to about $60. All in all we had a good experience.
2021-07-10,1,I first made a reservation at this restaurant days in advance for 8:15 as my gf wanted to try it.  When we arrived the curly haired host confirmed outdoor seating even though I specifically requested inside in case of rain. She completely lied to us and told us that the table wasn't ready and we needed to order a drink in the back bar before we can sit. We clearly saw at least 3 empty tables when we walked in. After 30 mins of trying to get a drink we didn't even want they said our table was ready. We tried to cancel the drink as we didn't even want them and they were rude and gave us a hard time. Also I'd like to mention these drinks were $5 more than others at the regular bar. Eventually, they sat us at the table that was already open when we walked in. We were clearly upset and the curly haired hostess tried to blame forcing us into a crowded bar to order a drink on being safe and spacing people out due to Covid (which makes absolutely zero sense). Covid shouldn't have been their excuse, as there were no Covid safety precautions taken if they were trying to be safe. Maskless waiters and all.  When we sat down the waiter was good but the whole experience was already ruined. To top the whole night off it started pouring when we got our entrees and we were forced to rush to eat and head inside to the crowded bar. If they would have sat us when we arrived we would have been back home before the rain ever started!  I will NEVER go back here unless they at least attempt to reach out and right these wrongs. I highly recommend not going here....especially considering the bill came to $100 per person.
2021-06-30,5,This was a fun place! The servers and bartenders were great, and the place has a very cool vibe. Fun place for a date; or for a group of friends.The menus they had at the restaurant were different than online (there were more options!)- we split a small tower from the raw bar, which was delicious- octopus starter, which was tough and charred a little too much- lobster ravioli, which was good, but salty.- my friend had the seafood spaghetti, which was also salty.We also ordered a couple of cocktails (Pantera Rosa) and a couple of glasses of wine.The restaurant very nicely comped our wine, which was appreciated:)I would go back and probably just order oysters from the raw bar since I've had a chance to try a sampling from the tower; I want to try the squid ink pasta, and try a few other apps. I also would specify not to add too much salt to my entree.
2021-06-27,2,Save your money, go elsewhere. Have been dying to try this restaurant for months and finally went. First, we ended up picking up a pizza on our way home because we were still hungry. We ordered the lobster biscuits which were way too salty, stuffed clams sat on a bed of salt and couldn't taste the clams, the grilled octopus was ok though. For entrees we had the lobster pasta which didn't even have as much lobster as a claw and was Like eating pure salt! And the branzino which was actually pretty good but was only half the fillet of fish for $26 and the side of vegetables was useless. So after spending nearly $200 we left there still hungry and chugged a gallon of water each that night because of how heavy handed the chef is with the salt.
2021-06-16,2,From the staff to the ambience sirenetta is a great spot to dine. The lack of the  three extra stars is due to the chef being accommodating to any religious or normal allergies. He refuses to make any modifications to the menu even if it's just not putting cheese on the potatoes or leaving the pork out of the pasta. Food is very limited if you have any dietary restrictions. If you decide to come here make sure there's something that you can eat as is!!!
2021-06-05,1,Horrible experience at sirenetta! My sister highly suggested it to me because she lives in the area. Arrived there at our reservation time and our table wasn't ready.  they had us sit in the back "lounge", which was a LOUD bar for 30 min waiting while no one served us until the last minute. They finally brought us to our table and told us the kitchen closes in 30 so to order fast. The appetizers were sub par and our salad came undressed (sent back, never received a replacement). Our final appetizer was the spicy shrimp. We watched a waiter deliver it to the adjacent table to us and the patrons say they didn't order it, however they left it there. Shortly after, our waiter came back to the table and said sorry we sent to wrong table, and proceeded to deliver it to our table! We asked to replace with a fresh one, and that never came either. Wait staff never Checked in on us, in fact we had to call the restaurant to ask for a manager to come to our table. While we explained the experience to him, he chuckled and chalked it up to short staffing. He also said that the waiter had told him that we cancelled both the shrimp and salad appetizers, which was not true!  After a $200 bill I asked him to please adjust based on the issues we had. Him and the waiter fought with us and said the bill reflects the meal and the restaurant is always right. After we paid the bill, the waiter stayed around and argued with my sister and I. Beyond unprofessional and inhospitable. Food was subpar and management was obnoxious to customers! Would never recommend coming here based on how pretentious the service was.
2021-05-30,3,This was our first time visiting Sirenetta. We're Hoboken residents and every time we pass by the restaurant it's busy. I tried to make reservations but was only able to secure a table 2 weeks out. The bustling activity + the booked reservations made me think that the restaurant was very good. Unfortunately my review doesn't match my initial thoughts. Pros: Very nice restaurant decoration, ambiance and service. The fish in the main course was cooked perfectly and tasted very fresh. Cons: The food is rather salty and I was not impressed with the taste and quality of some of the other dishes. Our reservation was for 7pm on Saturday. I tried ordering the scallops to be informed that they were sold out. That was a little disappointing given that it was rather early in the night for something to be sold out but that's my personal opinion. I then proceeded to get the spicy shrimp frittes with french fries. When I told my husband that the fries tasted like McDonald's he didn't believe me. But once he tasted it he understood what I meant. Maybe by the picture alone you can tell that they were a little sad looking. They were salty and soft. The tomato chili sauce on the shrimp was tasty but the shrimps themselves were not. There was something missing and I think it was texture. The shrimp was a little soggy. The dish didn't taste like a stew so the firmness of the shrimp wasn't working. Even though I didn't try any of my husband's oysters he mentioned that they weren't 'meaty' enough or at least they didn't meet his expectations since he's a fan of oysters. I can't comment much on this since I don't like to eat raw.When the main course arrived, we had to ask for the kitchen to warm up the house potatoes because they were cold. I ordered the swordfish milanese which was very tasty on its own. The dish arrived with an arugula salad that was salty. Unfortunately I had to move it  to the side of the plate. The seafood gravy was delicious though! I had a bite of my husbad's snapper and it was good. I'm a sucker for sweets and even though I was looking forward to dessert, my husband and I decided to skip it. Because we were underwhelmed with the food, we didn't want to be disappointed with desserts too so we asked for the check and decided to stop by a store for some candy instead. Even though this review is a bit of a miss I do want to say that the decor and ambiance was very nice. The service was also good. Our orders were taken promptly and the food arrived pretty quickly. There was also no delay to get the check and pay.
2021-05-23,4,Excellent service and wine selection. Raw Bar was also very fresh and the presentation was great. I believe We dined on an off day. (Sunday)There are some issues with some dishes.Crispy Rice Hamachi Crudo had no seasoning or any acidity And the rice part was not crispy at all. It was plated as plain rice. Wish the rice was deep fried or at least browned a little bit. The dish was definitely missing the crispiness.I could not taste or see any clams on `Semolina stuffed clams`. The marmalade is a good idea as a sweet element but the amount they put on the clam was overkilled the entire dish. Sweet and unseasoned stuffing.Had the same problem with the squid ink linguine with agrodolce. The pasta was cooked perfectly but The proportion of the agrodolce was not right for my palette. The sweetness of the sauce was dominant and the acidity was not enough. We feel like we are having sweet pasta. Wish there was some acidity.Seabass was also perfectly cooked and we enjoyed it.,overall friendly service, great interior. Food is not something i was actually expecting.  chef prefers to be on the sweet side and it ruins some of the dishes on the menu. I would definitely come again for friendly hospitality prosecco and for the raw bar.
2021-05-16,2,The venue is really pretty and the mules were good. The staffs were super friendly but the food was .... the portions were small and the flavors were off
2021-05-16,4,The restaurant is gorgeous! They did such a beautiful job. It is hard to get a reservation right now because the location is prime in Hoboken and the environment is perfect for a date night or dinner with friends or family!The fish is beyond fresh! They clearly have an amazing chef and I love the creativity and flavor choices! The crispy rice / yellowtail dish was amazing but I wish they gave more then one rice cracker as there was a great portion of fish and not enough rice. I loved everything I ate and I cannot wait to go back again! Highly recommended!
2021-05-16,4,Really cute seafood restaurant in uptown Hoboken. The decor is totally my style (we almost bought the chandeliers they have for our own home haha). They did great with social distancing compared to most places we've been in the area so kudos for that. And they have these huge windows that they open on both outside facing walls which is great for airflow but also just a great vibe. The food was actually really good. We had some oysters (they only have east coast but that works for me because I realized I don't really like west coast oysters) and even tried the raw bar clams for the first time. Good oysters always leave you wanting more! We also got the shrimp and frites app and the shrimp was cooked well and tasty. Husband and I shared a fish and pasta for the entrees and they were both pretty good. I personally really enjoyed the pappardelle with vodka sauce and fried oysters. The pasta felt homemade and almost felt like it melted into your mouth.  We tried the swordfish at the waiters recommendation and it was lightly fried. Totally my fault for not realizing it was fried but I like fish to be more tender and melt in your mouth so it just wasn't what I was expecting fried fish obviously isn't going to be like that. It was still made well and tasty. They have a good wine selection as well and so many mule options (though that's not what I got). After dinner we asked if the speakeasy attached Backstage had room (which is apparently first come first serve) and the waiter graciously went back to take a peak for us and said there's definitely room. So we closed out and grabbed a post dinner drink. The speak easy is super cute and decorated well (also had a whole wall open to the outside so not that speakeasy like LOL but still really enjoyed it). Overall enjoyed the experience will definitely be back.
2021-05-05,5,Beautiful little corner bar. Had the lobster with gluten free pasta. Lobster tender and plentiful, pasta a little under cooked but still delicious. Caesar salad fresh & delicious. Will definitely come back. Best cosmo ever!!
2021-05-04,4,Small menu but have good options. They don't allow substitutions for sides. I enjoyed appetizers more than the entrees. Spicy shrimp and fries and calamari is great. Loved the oysters
2021-04-30,4,My boyfriend and I wanted to come here for dinner tonight. We started with two of each of the oysters, a couple clams and a chowder soup. Don't get the hoboken clam chowder soup. It was not like new England so we sent it back. It's not good for what it is.We ordered the Stone crab and it was small. It's also a lot of work! Not worth it. Not flavorful. Its served cold..You don't get warm butter or a crab cracker! Don't get the Stone crab. Awful. And overpriced.Best oysters and salmon in town!!! Fresh vegetables. We will return for the clams and oysters from the raw bar and then get the grilled salmon again. Absolutely delicious. Cooked perfect. Perfectly seasoned. Nice crunch on the crust.The grilled octopus was okay, though we wouldn't get it again. It's small and pricey. Cooked perfect. Flavor was okay.We finished with Amaro Montenegro. It's incredible!!! We LOVE it. Perfect aperitif.We also had an amazing server!! Great job Matt!! He made excellent recommendations. Superb service!! Very attentive. We hope to get him again next time we're in! :)
2021-04-29,1,Very disappointed as we waited several weeks to get a reservation. We took an early reservation since that was all that was available just so we could try it. The portions were extremely small, NYC priced and tasteless. The fish was overly cooked and had absolutely no flavor with tiny sides that came with it. Very disappointed as we were looking forward to this restaurant opening. Had to go to dinner elsewhere afterwards as we were still hungry.
2021-04-26,3,We were finally able to get a table here, and the best thing was the oysters. We didn't enjoy our main dishes too much, we will just stick to drinks & oysters if we go again. Atmosphere is great, still a must try for yourself.
2021-04-25,1,We are big fans of Sorrelina and have been for awhile, but we arrived late last night and asked for a table for 3 for drinks.. only two of us had arrived. The hostess escorted us to the "lounge" because she said if we were just drinking that's where we had to sit... annoying, but that's okay! The back had a speak easy feel. We were very excited to try some of the cocktails on the list. We placed an order with a server and when I found out our third guest was coming hungry I asked if we could move to the front of the restaurant, so she could eat a full meal. The waiter said he'd check with the manager on duty.We sat there for 25 minutes when finally the server came back again and said that he was going to grab a manager (I thought you were already doing that?) We still hadn't gotten our drinks when the manager came over and told us we needed a reservation to sit in the front. When I told him it was fine and that we still hadn't gotten our drinks he went over to the computer and told us pretty rudely that they had only been put in 6 minutes ago which may have been true but by this point we had ordered them almost 30 minutes ago. We ended up leaving. To make matters worse, I left my bag on the back of the chair and when I called the next day they insisted they didn't see or have it. Super shady considering I knew exactly where I left it. Just all around a poor customer service experience and we didn't even eat or drink.
2021-04-19,5,Having lived in both the US and Europe we have been fortunate to eat in many fine restaurants.  Sirenetta Seafood & Raw Bar is one of them! Between the extraordinary food, impeccable service and atmosphere it's truly a restaurant you should definitely visit - you will not be disappointed.  We cannot wait to return!
2021-04-13,4,Sitting here now / girlfriend and I ate 24 oysters, lobster biscuits, swordfish Milanese, gnocchi and unfortunately the butterball potatoes. I really enjoyed my Negroni, she enjoyed her tiki mule and then I also enjoyed, if you cannot tell another cocktail called captain jack or something.Honestly I expected this place to suck (pessimism), however y'all rocked my socks and everything has been great with the exception of those damn potato's.I ate them but honestly they're just potato's. Y'all could do better, I was pleasantly surprised but the potatoes fell flat. 5 stars if you fix your potatoes.Potatoes,Lou
2021-04-12,1,I don't write reviews much, but this place merits it. It really is a major hit or miss, and two things ultimately informed my decision to review it. Firstly, this restaurant has a sister restaurant across the street, allowing one to form patterns. Secondly, the restaurant did not respond to my post-meal inquiry about some of their issues, and therefore can be assumed to be confident in their approach to this.If you want the short version, here it is. If you like their sister restaurant, you will probably like this too. If you did not, or if you are in any manner sensitive to salt, you should not eat here, in my opinion. If you are not sure, go and have one dish and some really nice drinks in a pleasant setting, before you risk the possibility of spending $200 for food you cannot eat.PROSThe drinks from the bar were fantastic. Well-made Old Fashioneds, and while the beer menu was quite poorly designed (it is made for exactly one palette type, with no meaningful variety from a beer-lover's perspective), the choices they did have were quite good choices for this genre of beer taste. The wine list was good.The service was great. Brooks and Zac were our servers over the course of the night, and we found them to be very helpful, understanding, and professional. Brooks made sensible recommendations, and worked proactively to resolve a minor issue we encountered. I would also point out that we made reservations, and were seated efficiently as soon as we arrived. CONSIn my opinion, the salt usage has is beyond the pale. Many other reviews have stated this as well, and they are correct. This is not 'regionally salty' food; that would be excusable, since some areas of Italy, for example, make their dishes notably saltier than in other reasons. This nuance is not present; the Smoked Crab Spaghetti was inedible; the cheese biscuits that came with one of our soups were too salty, though not inedible.I do NOT agree with the person who said the stuffed clams were too salty; while it is true that they are (literally) served on a pile of salt, it is up to the diner to choose to add this, and if you sprinkle it on liberally, then of course it will be too salty. I did not think the stuffed clams were good - they were poorly balanced in terms of flavors, very amateur in their composition - but mine were not salty at all.CLOSING THOUGHTSIt is worth noting that this salt issue is - like all questions of flavor - somewhat subjective. I do not eat at this restaurant group's sister place across the street, because it is - in my opinion - also too salty. So, if you have gone there and had a good experience, you may decide that you do not experience this level of sensitivity to the salt, and may as well give this spot a try. You will also notice that, for every review mentioning issues and (specifically) the saltiness, many folks have gone here and not had an issue with it. So, you should take this into account and make a balanced decision on whether or not to go.When in doubt, go and have a few drinks and try one or two appetizers, and then decide whether to come back for a full dinner. You will be supporting a local business, and may decide that the experience is one you will enjoy.We also had a minor issue - a massive fish bone in the chowder - but our waiter proactively took the dish off our bill, so we consider that problem to have been solved to our satisfaction. While the size of the bone (about three inches) certainly indicates a lack of sloppiness in the plating, I believe that an issue like this can happen when you are eating at a place that serves food made in-house from real ingredients, and that this issue could have occurred as easily at another restaurant.
2021-04-08,5,BEST SEAFOOD SPOT IN HOBOKEN the seared tuna, raw oysters, grilled steak are ALL phenomenal Looking forward to trying more on the menu
2021-04-05,2,Food was ok. The lobster pasta dish that the server recommended was super salty but still edible which we mentioned. Raw oysters were fine and the octopus was cooked well. They forgot the stone crab dish which we mentioned at the end of the meal and they comped a dessert in it's place which was ok. They also got me a silver tequila instead of the reposado I ordered but I just didn't bother bringing it up. Wine was decent. The decor is really nice inside. I wouldn't come back though. Too many off things and there were only about 5 or 6 other tables in there. The servers were nice but I guess didn't care enough to get the orders correct.
2021-04-03,3,Service was good, drinks were fine, octopus appetizer was extremely small,  my mahi-mahi was also small...
2021-04-03,3,Ambiance is awesome. The restaurant is beautiful and really nicely designed. I would say that it was pretty loud and tough to have a normal conversation without having to raise your voice for people to hear you a couple of knoches.  Drinks were good and  service was good. What got me was the food. We order the grilled octopus and what came out was a joke.  For $16 I imagined it would be a decent portion.  What they served was tiny and not worth the price. The squid ink pasta was just straight weird.  The pasta was undercooked and sauce was weird. I took 2 bites and could not eat it anymore. I didn't like it at all. My husband got the lobster pasta and that was decent. Desert we chose the peanut butter cook desert. It was ok but nothing special. All in all for what you pay for the food wasn't that good. Don't plan on  going back.
2021-03-27,5,Amazing food, service was great. So happy we have such a great place to go to for raw bar so close to our home. Atmosphere is wonderful. Ate indoors with windows open it was delightful.
2021-03-20,2,I have been wanting to go to this place for months.  Their sister restaurant across the street was really good and more of Italian fare, so when I saw a seafood restaurant open across the street , I was so excited.  We had a dozen oysters for happy hour, these were really good and better than the standard blue point oysters you get during happy hour. For apps we had the stuffed clams and lobster biscuits.  These probably could have been good but were so overloaded with salt, that's all we could taste.  We didn't even finish our clams because they were just too salty.  I did tell our server that everything was extremely salty and to please make sure our entrees weren't over salted.  Another person asked how the food was so far and I said it was "ehh just ok", and he walked away. Our entrees came out.  We had the gnocchi and hanger steak.  The gnocchi was undercooked and the sauce was so salty that any crab or truffle that was in the dish couldn't be tasted. The steak was cooked great, but this had zero seasoning and the salad with onions was so overly salted it wasn't edible. I mentioned how salty everything was again, but it didn't seem to matter. We were just given our $200 check and told "thanks". We left here and went to another restaurant after for dessert and some apps to have something that didn't taste like pure salt. It was disappointing I had to pay so much money to eat an immense amount of salt, but worse when no one seemed to care about the dissatisfaction toward my meal.  If you have high blood pressure or hate being dehydrated, I would not recommend this place.
2021-03-19,2,We have been trying to get here for months and honestly happy it's out of the way At this point. I'm literally ready to suck down water as I'm sitting here writing this review. It was incredibly over salty. We even asked after the apps if the chef could ease up on the salt, unfortunately that wasn't the case. We had the dozen oysters, that was honestly the best thing other than the drinks. The lobster biscuits were okay but so damn salty. Would of been a favorite if they didn't have as much salt. The stuffed clams were flavorful but def over salted as well. The gnocchi with truffle was alright. Sauce was overly salty and the gnocchi was undercooked. Still not a awful dish, would I pay 38 bucks for it, no. The gander steak was cooked to perfection.....with no flavor. You used salt in every other dish with a heavy hand, but this one dish that could of used it, got absolutely nothing. Unfortunate. Their sister restaurant was so much better directly across the street, but after this I don't really know if I'm willing to give my money to this group.
2021-03-16,4,Dined at Sirenetta inside during COVID and felt very safe as the tables were very spaced out. They have a great list of cocktails and wine. The food menu is very seafood focused (obviously!) but they have unique twists on a bunch of seafood dishes where everything sounded so intriguing. My husband and I split the semolina stuffed clams to start and the table split the lobster biscuits. The biscuit were DELICIOUS and there's enough for a large group to try if you cut them in half as they are pretty heavy. The clams were awesome as well. For entrees, we split the lobster rigatoni and king salmon. This was the perfect combo to try to dishes but not get overly stuffed with a pasta dish. The king salmon was super fresh and perfectly cooked. It was a really refreshing dish with orange and escarole on the side. The rigatoni had a ton of lobster in it which was nice they weren't skimping you! Would definitely come back for dinner or just a drink and oysters/raw bar items.
2021-03-12,5,From the outset I was in the Seafood Bar I felt welcome. I then stated with the Career Salad which was delicious...whole Romaine and against very good. Finally went to the Sea Bass. Excellent to the core. Tasty and filling. Highly recommended!!
2021-02-28,5,Best seafood restaurant in Hoboken! Try the lobster biscuits, they are so soft and tasty. They have a great oyster selection, if you're not sure what to order the server can help you out. Staff is very friendly and quick. The cocktails were delicious. For entrees you have many choices even if you're not a seafood lover! I had the smoked crab spaghetti and I was surprised how all the flavors blended in my mouth. If you don't like spicy I would recommend you let them know as it could get a little too much if you're not used to spicy. My boyfriend had the potato gnocchi it was scrumptious, only downside was the small portion. If you're looking for good seafood and crafty cocktails definitely head here, they really know what they are doing!!
2021-02-22,4,Food was amazing and staff was friendly. Only complaint is that they have a truffle burrata appetizer and it only comes with one piece of bread so you can't really share it.
2021-02-22,4,My friend and I had dinner at Sirenetta for the first time this weekend.  When the restaurant first opened, it was really hard to come by a reservation however I looked on Resy the night of and they had several openings for 2 after 7:30 pm.  When booking on Resy, they do require a credit card as there is a $25 cancellation/no show fee. The interior of Sirenetta is gorgeous.  It feels very clean & bright, with the white marble and gold accents.  If it weren't for Covid, it would be really nice to come in and sit at the long bar for drinks & oysters.  They converted the back area into a lounge like area where we were invited to have drinks at after we finished our dinner.  In the main dining area, they had plenty of tables.  The service was very good throughout the entire meal and our waiter was very helpful in answering all of our questions about the menu as first time diners. We decided to split  1/2 dozen oysters, the lobster biscuits and the citrus fried shrimp to start.  The biscuits were delicious with the lobster butter - warm and fresh.  Oysters were good.  The fried shrimp were OK but for $18, you don't get a lot of shrimp - it's mostly just a plate of radicchio.  I would pass on that app.   For our mains, I had the lobster pasta which was a decent sized portion - the dish has a kick to it. I liked it but the pasta was a little too al dente.  My friend tried the sea bass and said it was very good.   For drinks, we each had two espresso martinis which were made perfectly.  They have some interesting cocktails on their drink menu that I would drink the next time.  Overall, it was a pleasant meal and I would dine here again.
2021-02-21,5,I had such a great experience at Sirenetta. Have been meaning to try this place since it opened and figured it would be good for a birthday dinner. It was a perfect place to celebrate!Started with a couple cocktails: the Empress of the Sea and a Moscow Mule (classic and very good, the crystallized ginger was a nice touch). The Empress of the Sea was delicious and reminded me of an Aviation cocktail. It was a fun purple color and not too sweet.Appetizers all looked amazing but we decided on the Fried Oysters and Shrimp & Frites. Would recommend both of these but if I were to go back, I would opt to try something else over reordering the oysters. For entrees, we went with the Lobster Al Amaraciana (not sure if I spelled it correctly) and the Squid Ink Linguine. The Lobster pasta had some kick to it and was spiced nicely! I preferred the squid ink linguine of the two. It had a ridiculous amount of pancetta in it but was very nice with the shrimp, green onions, and black pepper. My fiancé said the squid ink pasta/sauce was a little sweet for him. For desserts, we tried two different espresso options: the Mocha gelato affogado and the Frozen espresso bomb. The mocha gelato was the best gelato I have had in Hoboken. The espresso bomb was my favorite though! I think it was also gelato under chocolate ganache? I didn't catch the server's name but she was very kind and helpful! I felt comfortable eating indoors, and our table was spaced out well from others. The interior of the restaurant is just gorgeous, lots of cool light fixtures. The music wasn't too loud either which I feel like happens too often in fancy restaurants haha. After dinner, we went to the back of the restaurant where there is a little speakeasy called Backstage. Seating is limited because of Covid so try to go earlier in the evening to guarantee a spot. The bartender (Alex?) was very helpful and put on a good show when making the drinks!Overall a fantastic experience! Looking forward to returning, maybe for brunch.
2021-02-14,5,This place was great! Went here for a celebratory drink right after proposing at the waterfront and they made us feel at home and so special. They brought us two glasses of champagne and our waiter was extremely attentive and awesome. I got a Manhattan and it was made to perfection. For the appetizer we got the truffle burratta and I really did not expect for so many truffles to be on it. It was amazing. Thanks so much for everything and we will definitely be back!!!!
2021-02-09,5,Took my wife here for her birthday dinner last night and it was spectacular. Our waiter, Brooks, was extremely knowledgeable and made several good suggestions for appetizers and wine. Very impressed. We'll be back.
2021-02-03,3,My first Sirenetta experience was interesting but good. We came in with big expectations due to the high praise from others. We booked a Friday night reservation almost a week in advance, and we were seated pretty much right away.The place is gorgeous and clean. We sat at a table close to the bar with clear sight light to the raw bar. And arguably most importantly, the staff was great. The hostess, the two managers, our server, and the bartender were incredibly kind, professional, and personable. We ordered two drinks from the Moscow Mule Bar, both of which were delicious. One was made with Jameson and peach liqueur, the other with bourbon. We love mules, so this was a no brainer for us.For starters, we ordered the Grilled Octopus. This was our favorite dish of the night. Absolutely delicious, great char, big flavor. Highly recommend.Our starters were regrettably less than impressive. Our Mahi Mahi was tasty but undercooked, to the point where it could have, and maybe should have, been sent back. The very middle of the fish was noticeably raw, but the rest of the fish was good enough. It was served with a few different forms of eggplant, the thinly fried eggplant being the standout side component.The other starter, as recommended by our server, was the Lobster Rigatoni. The lobster portion was generous, and the lobster itself was awesome. Unfortunately the pasta was a little too al dente. I like my pasta a bit softer, but this bordered on chewy. It was especially disappointing because it was homemade pasta.Overall it was a good, but not great, experience. I would definitely return to Sirenetta again, in fact I look forward to dabbling with the raw bar and other dishes.
2021-02-02,5,Very impressed by this place!!!I went by on a snow day and was happy to see it was empty so I could check it out. I had high hopes because I was disappointed when Maxwell's shut down and was replaced by a business that wouldn't be doing live music but I now feel that this place is a great addition to Hoboken! I love their cocktail menu. Not too many to choose from but there is definitely something for everybody. I got one signature, the empress of the sea and one classic, a winter Negroni. Both drinks were perfect exactly what I wanted. I got one appetizer to go to bring home from my boyfriend: the lobster biscuits. He LOVED them. I had a bite too it was DELICIOUS. $14 for 4 biscuits sounds like a lot but I still think it was worth it. The food is definitely pricey but not too crazy for Hoboken. Perfect spot for a fancy date. I can't wait to come back to try their hand made pasta!! The service was great too. Nobody seemed upset to be working on a slow snow day. Everyone was pleasant and attentive and the place is beautifully decorated.
2021-01-17,5,This place is really a great addition to uptown Hoboken! I recommend making a reservation because it was quite busy for dinner when I went on a random weekday. The pasta options looked too good to pass up so instead of apps we split a pasta as a starter. We opted for the lobster rigatoni which was unreal, pasta perfectly cooked and a decent  amount of lobster was also included. We can't forget the mule bar completed with extremely delicious homemade ginger beer, the one with amaro in it was so good! My meal was the highlight though, I got the swordfish Milanese which i thought was an interesting take on a Milanese but it was lightly breaded and came with a lovely broth to dip in. Portion sizes were good as well! I will definitely be back here!
2021-01-10,4,I felt very lucky to grab a seat here for Saturday brunch on a whim. Indoor seat around town is limited with covid social distancing and we didn't have a reservation. My friend and I walked in after Elysian (a few blocks down) only had outdoor dining. It was 30 degrees and we were not about that. Friends of ours have been eyeing dinner reservations at Sirenetta for awhile so we didn't expect to get in, but around 12:30 there was a lot of open tables. By the time we left at 2/2:30, nearly every table was full. PS They have online reservations available on Resy (unlike Elysian which is currently call ahead day of only)Formerly Maxwells, I was excited to see what they did this this place. Their sister restaurant Sorellina is across the street and super nice so my expectations were high. The ambiance is super chic and the light color scheme and the mid century modern details very on trend. Everything felt super roomy and relatively covid safe. There's a bottle of hand sanitizer at every table as well as a QR code menu. Compared to some other covid indoor dining, however, I would say they could do a better job by temperature scanning guests and perhaps taking down diner information for contact tracing. Brunch is a great deal and the cocktails are the same price as the appetizers (our meal was about $120 for 4 cocktails, 1 cappuccino, biscuits, fish platter, including tip). This is the kind of place that charges you $4 for still water, just fwiw. My friend and I split the smoked fish platter (omg the salmon belly is soo good) and a side of pancetta and fontina biscuits- which came out warm and flaky. Both were very good, but I'd probably try other items on the menu before ordering the same thing again. We also felt like the slow cooked eggs in the smoked fish platter could've used some extra oomph, like scallions, to elevate them from homemade.  Our server Laura was very friendly and also a food lover. She had a great balance of checking in but not being too hover-y. A lot of establishments have time limits when tables are full (which I would say they were about 90% by 2pm) and we did feel the hostess wanted us out by the end (by her movements of asking if we were done eating and getting us our check), but then the staff was very lenient on actually picking up our payment. That was a little confusing. I will be back again and can't wait to try other meals and menu items.
2021-01-09,2,Been waiting since November to try this place once I'm a fish lover and I'm sad to say it was a waste of my time and money . The place is beautiful but service is simply HORRIBLE in more ways than one .We come in and are seated at a table right across from the front door , I asked to move tables because every time someone opened the door there was an awful gasp of air , they said NO !! After a waiter herd me comments to my boyfriend about me writing a Yelp review than the hostess came and offered another table but by that time was already a bit late because I was already annoyed . The waitress tells us we must order everything at once because we have a 90 minute limit at our table but than she disappears for almost 15 minutes while we just sat there and waited to order , than she  asks 3 times if there's any food allergies she should be aware of ? I said yes I'm allergic to spicy food ( all 3 times she asked ) . I ordered an appetizer and the base of it was simply on fire it was so spicy . Remember she asked 3 times about food allergies . Ok than we ordered dinner and I must say it was very tasteful however the menu said it was for 2 people and honestly there was barely enough for one person . After having my dinner at a very uncomfortable table I asked the waitress to please close the curtains by the front door a little because it was to cold , she walks up and closes barely an inch and as people kept coming in the curtain just went right back to where it was . The atmosphere in general was just bad . No such thing as friendly service in this place . Very disappointing because would be nice to try other dishes on the menu , however the vibe and the service provided are just not worth the aggravation .
2020-12-31,4,Overall, experience was average. Our server was great, COVID precautions were in place, but the menu/food is where the rating went down a bit. We ordered the small seafood "tower"; oysters, clams, shrimp & crab legs, When we ordered this tower, we thought it would come out on a tiered presentation. Well, no... it was just a large bowl of seafood. For main dish, we ordered the "Whole" branzino for 2. We ordered thinking we'd get the whole fish; the head would come with it, and it will be presented on one plate. That is not the case. We received two separate plates with a filet of branzino on each. The menu is a bit deceiving, and the portions are pretty small. Taste of the food was great, just wish we got more!
2020-12-30,4,Food, ambiance, and service was great. We started with the stuffed clams, spicy shrimp, and a small seafood tower. My boyfriend had the lobster rigatoni and I had the scallops. We also had two cocktails, I had the empress which was not only pretty but delicious. We ended with the frozen espresso bomb. For the price, we expected the portions to be a little bigger. Tasted delicious but unfortunately we didn't leave as full as we thought we would.
2020-12-29,4,Overall good experience at sirenetta! I really enjoyed the seafood appetizers, obviously given the name this is their specialty. The restaurant was beautifully done in terms of indoor decor. The shrimp was my favorite and I liked the lobster pasta I had. My friends had some other pasta dishes that we all did not like, so next time we will stick to the amazing seafood apps. Entree portions were also very small (the scallops shown below are an entree, my friend left starving) however I got lucky with my lobster pasta bc it was a decent size. Next time I want to try more stuff from their raw bar!
2020-12-28,1,Disappointed, was very excited to Take my girlfriend here for her birthday and the seafood gnocchi came out cold. The lobster pasta dish was ok at best, as was the octopus appetizer. Drinks were also pretty weak. Would definitely expect way more out of a $200 dinner. Never been one to complain about a restaurant but in this case it was hard not to.
2020-12-23,5,Great addition to Hoboken. Dined inside...covid precautions were good and the food and drinks were tremendous. Seafood gnocchi and lobster alla amatriciana were both delicious. Great oysters and cocktails too (recommend the winter Negroni and penicillin cocktails)
2020-12-20,4,I'm so glad I finally tried Sirenetta! My roommate and I went for dinner and the atmosphere was excellent and I felt very safe with their COVID restrictions. We started with the Semolina Stuffed Clams and I still have dreams about the orange marmalade sauce. Great choice for a starter. I got the swordfish milanese. The piece of fish was huge and I was very satisfied after my meal. The combination of arugula, brussel sprouts, bacon and gravy with the swordfish was the perfect combination. My roommate got the potato gnocchi. The gnocchi was delicious but the portion size was a little small compared to the price. We also decided to splurge and get the shaved black truffle but it really wasn't worth it. If it was double the portion size it would be worth the price but go for something else if you are hungry. We ended the night with the frozen espresso bomb and the pumpkin mousse. Both excellent dessert choices. Will definitely be back again!
2020-12-19,2,Since my last review was deleted. Swordfish is awful, tasted like a chicken patty/ fish sticks.  Who breads swordfish?  Great ambiance and drinks though, which is why this is getting 2 lone stars otherwise it would Be 0 based on the entrees.
2020-12-10,5,Honestly this place is fantastic. Service, cocktails, food were all excellent. Also the decor is gorgeous and clean. Our waiter recommended winter Negronis with their house made spiced bitters and they were so so smooth. To start we shared tuna crudo, baked clams, mushroom fritters. A few people mentioned portions were small so we ordered three but this was not necessary. Baked clams were huge and the tuna crudo was perfect for two. Lobster rigatoni and caesar salad as main. Both were so delicious. Pasta is easily best in Hoboken to be honest. We finished off with a peanut butter budino. (chocolate cookie on bottom, peanut butter silky mousse, topped with sweet cream ) One of the best parts of the meal.
2020-12-10,1,This is the second review I have written. The first, I complimented the service at Anthony David's, this is not as positive. We came twice so I could give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt. The fish is bad. We ordered the seared tuna as an appetizer and had to send it back because it was rancid. Probably the only time I have ever sent food back in my life. They put citrus and different fruits all over all the fish to disguise the taste of the fish itself. The lobster pasta is the most popular dish - the pasta is good but the lobster is frozen lobster that they defrost. You can taste it. I never write reviews but the lack of fresh seafood for a seafood restaurant is concerning die the diners.
2020-12-06,5,Had a reservation on Saturday night - all tables are safety 6 ft + apart. Our waiter, Zac, was great and very friendly. Food was delicious, ordered a bunch of apps and each got our own main. All pastas can be made gluten free.
2020-11-22,4,This is definitely a very cute spot for a night out. They only have indoor dining right now. I really enjoyed the service & staff was very friendly. Due to time restrictions (90 mins per reservation) they ask you order appetizer & entree at once. We got the biscuits w/ lobster butter (delicious) and Oysters to start. For main course I ordered the Squid Ink pasta w Calamari & Octopus. The food was delicious. The fresh pasta was soo good. I'm only taking a star off because they have a small menu (assuming it's going to be rotating but can't confirm that) and my calamari was rough chopped so some of the pieces were a little tough to chew. Dessert was delicious I got the coconut cream pie that came with lemon gelato. It was delicious and refreshing. Besides the calamari being a little chewy, it was a really great meal, my friend got the lobster rigatoni and the espresso bomb dessert and she really enjoyed it! I look forward to going back & hopefully trying more meals here!
2020-11-21,5,First time visiting this restaurant! Really enjoyed the cocktails - we had empress and rattlesnake! We also tried the oysters - 1/2 dozen and those were great quality as well. For main, we shared lobster rigatoni which was excellent! The pasta was cooked al dente and there was plenty of lobster! We thought we were done but then added the mushroom croquette which was the only disappointing item on the menu. Needed salt and the sauce lacked flavor. All in all a great experience and we will be back!
2020-11-17,4,Good service , great contemporary decor, and good food selection. For appetizers we had oysters, Caesar salad, and tuna. The best part of the apps was oysters and Caesar salad. The scallops were okay and the salmon was really good. Only reason I'm giving 4 stars and because of the nice and attentive staff .All around I could skip.
2020-11-14,5,What a great time. We came randomly to check it out and didn't expect to find seats. They luckily had 2 seats at the bar and we went from it!  This is a newer place and has this chic vibe to it.  Perfect for a dinner date or drinks. The bartender Michael was such a nice guy and he made the whole experience really fun. We tried a few different small plates. The octopus was flavorful and very tender.  The fried shrimp agnoletti was an interesting take on the dish. I prefer it boiled but this variation was solid. The squash latka's were also pretty good even though I thought it was potato. For dessert we tried the bread pudding with ice cream. It was decadent! So good. For drinks we tried a few different red wines and all of them complimented the meal perfectly. I will definitely come back for a full dinner. I would prefer to sit at the bar even if I eat dinner because the service was on point.  They also have a speakeasy in the back of the restaurant. Not sure if you need a reservation but it had a cool vibe. I wish this place the best! Good luck!
2020-11-12,5,I was extremely excited to have a seafood/raw bar come to Hoboken. I made sure to make a reservation for opening week and I'm happy to say I've already gone again. The oysters are incredible and by far best I've had in Hoboken. The cocktails were all so different yet tasty. My favorite so far from what I've tried has to be the orchard mule. The biscuits we got our last visit were INCREDIBLE. Favorite part of my meal honestly and if I could have, I would've taken a whole bag to go. Overall a great spot to go to for really great food, awesome service, and a really nice ambiance. Will point out that this is definitely a special spot and a little pricier than some places in Hoboken but... seafood is expensive and you are definitely getting exactly what you're paying for.
2020-11-11,5,The food was absolutely amazing. Especially the Squid Ink pasta! I would recommend the seafood tower as an appetizer as well. The one thing I didn't think was worth trying were the cauliflower croquettes.
2020-11-10,5,Holy fish cheeks!!! This place is absolutely delicious. Culinary creativity woes the senses with variety and artful pairing of flavors that leave your palate eager for the next delicious bite. Couple that with unique craft cocktails from Michael the mixologist and your mouth will thank you. Completely thrilled for this new addition to the neighborhood!
2020-11-07,5,MUST TRY (make the reservation now)! The food was amazing, our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable, and the food was OUT OF THIS WORLD! Already making another reservation!
2020-11-07,4,Was so hyped for a seafood centric restaurant in Hoboken, especially the sister restaurant of Sorellina!The interior is so nice and open. I really like the big window concepts so even the windows were open for more air circulation. The decor is really pretty too. For appetizers, we got the raw bar: oysters and clams. They were delicious! They tasted really fresh and I liked the sauces that came with it. The mignonette was more peppery which I loved. For entrees, we got the spicy lobster rigatoni and it was delicious. The sauce was a good spice level and there was a good amount of lobster meat too. The pasta was cooked al dente. We also got the swordfish which was good with an arugula salad on the side. For dessert, we got the espresso bomb which was delicious. Overall, I'm happy with my experience here. The most memorable dish was the lobster rigatoni.
2020-11-07,4,New modern resturant in downtown Hoboken, located right across the street from its sister resturant Sorellina (which is also really good btw). We ended up ordering a few raw bar items, the lobster rigatoni and swordfish. The oysters and clams were really fresh and the pasta was really good. Swordfish was ok, I think we should have ordered something else besides that. Also, the espresso bomb for dessert is a must. This place is definitely a little on the pricier end, and portions are a little small, so be ready to spend money if you're coming here. Overall,  I was happy with the food and service.
2020-10-28,3,We wanted to love this spot so much, so I'm sad to leave a bad review...but I hope they make some changes! The raw bar items were fantastic, as well as the wine, and the service was on point. However; we were both super disappointed with our entrees. My salmon was cooked well and flavorful but the portion size was tiny. For $28 I expect a full fillet and probably 1-2 decent sized sides, yet it was about 1/3 of a fillet over a small bed of broccoli rabe. My boyfriend got the swordfish, which was also smaller than expected and dressed poorly. We want to give it another shot, but the price point doesn't make sense. At almost $200, we just expected more. Hoping that they will make some menu adjustments because the space is beautiful and we'd like to return, but definitely aren't running back anytime soon.
2020-10-25,2,Great service and atmosphere weren't enough to save this Sorellina outpost. Menu was limited and not executed well. Overpriced.Cocktail - Lonsadale - 8.2. Sweet and fall flavors. I like it.Apps - Stuffed Clams - 3.2. Fruit stuff on top was terrible. Too salty and all over the place.Seafood chowder - 3.0 bland as fuck. Needs salt, pepper, paprika.Muscles Scampi - 6.3. Standard but sometimes that's enough.Gnocchi - 3.5. Gnocchi was overcooked and sauce was lifeless.
2020-10-24,4,Needed more food, portion sizes were small but overall the food was delicious especially the raw oysters! We got ourselves Moscow mules which we're on the sweet side, and he had a good old fashion. For food we ordered oysters, stone crab and stuffed baked clams. I loved the clams with the oranges on top, sweet and citrusy. For entrees he ordered the potato gnocchi (small portion) and I ordered the lobster rigatoni. The rigatoni wasn't my favorite meal but it was still good. It was very spicy for my taste buds. Because the menu is pretty limited I can see myself coming here once every so often, but definitely need to try at least once. Overall great job!
2020-10-23,5,Hoboken needed this! The ambiance, decor and food were amazing.  West village/LES vibes and high quality drinks and food.  Haven't had this tasty a meal in this area in a long time.  Had the oysters, mushroom croquettes and Lobster all'amatriciana. Highly recommend!
2020-10-20,5,I was so excited to try Sirenetta after seeing it just opened and it definitely lived up to my expectations! Started off with drinks and I decided to get the "Empress of the Sea" cocktail which was delicious and so visually pleasing. Next, we decided to do some appetizers and the large seafood tower. The appetizers were awesome (zucchini fritters, cauliflower & grilled octopus) and the seafood tower was fresh and delicious. The oysters were some of the best I've had in a while! If you decide to stop here the seafood tower is a MUST!
2020-10-17,5,I have not had meal like this in YEARS. Such amazing service, freshest raw bar, delicious homemade pastas. Everything here is so well thought out. The most impressive restaurant in Hoboken!
2020-10-15,5,I have been waiting for them to open as Hoboken needs more spots for oysters and seafood and it did not disappoint. I was so highly impressed with everything--from the service to the food to the ambiance. Our waiter was energetic and gave us some great recommendations. We got oysters and the seared tuna to start and both were great. Entrees - I got the salmon and my boyfriend the swordfish Milanese which was just so delicious. Both were good but the swordfish stood out for sure. The entree sizes are not huge which some people may not be thrilled about but I loved it. The fish and sides complimented each other so well. Desert - the espresso bomb was delicious. The ice cream was so creamy Cocktails - I got the gin cocktail with coconut and egg whites and it was absolutely beautiful and tasted like a better version of a pina colada. Great way to finish a yummy mealCheck it out for sure! Can't wait to come back
2020-10-08,2,Wanted to love this place but unfortunately probably won't be going back. The cocktails were average at best which was fine but the food is where they lost us. The crudo was ok, the branzino and corn was great the hamachi and tomato was pretty awful. We also got the fried shrimp agnolotti....it was SALT, just salt.  Grilled octopus was average and the portion size was so small I was suprised they even served it as a dish. I got the monkfish cheek main, while the flavor of the sauce was good the monkfish was like little rubber balls. Not appetizing at all. The service was really good but the place is way too bright. Dim the lights and throw some real candles in there not the weird fake ones you have now. It just needs a little more ambiance. We paid around $400 for 2 of us and I felt robbed. Had a reservation for later this month which i've already cancelled.
2020-10-07,3,This new restaurant is very nicely decorated. The lighting is pretty bright, not dim lighting. Overall it was pretty good. The waitress was pleasant and attentive. I had the Hemingway daiquiri cocktail which was delicious. I tried the stuffed clams, which were good not great. They are served with a pink salt at the bottom which I didn't know it was salt so I mixed it in and it was extremely strong. I ordered the mussels scampi it was delicious. Our main negative comment is that my friend ordered the Lobster rigatoni which tasted very good but it had two tiny pieces of lobster, nothing as advertised and it's a small plate for $28. Seafood isn't cheap so it would be nice to have a decent portion of what your are paying for not two tiny lobster claws that you can barely even find.  I would give this place a second try to check out other dishes and cocktails. Hopefully their menu becomes a little more extensive in the future.
2020-10-06,4,Alright, I really wanted to give this place like 3.75 stars but I realize it was opening night and I really think by the end of the week they'll nail the 4 star rating no problem. I'm pretty picky and don't give 5 stars often, so a 4 is very good. Since this is the first review, I'll try to be specific.Covid - Everything was fine, masks by all, large windows open, servers with gloves, etc. No problems or concerns here at all.Service - This is what knocked them down a little, but I think a lot of that was due to the staff still trying to get into the swing of things. We were promptly seated at our reservation time and water showed up immediately. Then, we sat, and sat, and sat. Probably a solid 10-15 minutes before a waitress came over, and she came up to see if somebody had taken our order yet. When we said no, she was very apologetic and friendly. It seemed like the staff was just generally unsure about who was covering what sections and tables, which I'm thinking was just due to the staff getting into the groove of things. I'm sure this will be resolved after a few days. For the rest of the evening, our waitress was really attentive and the staff was great about clearing silverware and share plates in between various appetizers and our meal.Drinks: Ordered a Cosmopolitan and a Manhattan. The Cosmo was good and had a nice bright lemon finish to it. The Manhattan was decent but not as good as the cosmo. I was also a little bummed they don't use Luxardo maraschino cherries, as I think they really make the drink.Food:In general, we liked it. We had a late reservation and we were pretty hungry so I didn't get pictures of the appetizers like a good little Yelper. Whoops.Seafood Chowder - This was polarizing at our table. I really enjoyed it, but my wife wasn't a fan, as we was expecting something thicker and more along the lines of a New England style chowder. I'd absolutely order this again, and she definitely wouldn't. I heard another guest comment that the consistency of it wasn't what they expected as well. I really enjoyed this as it wasn't overly fishy or pungent. Nice presentation as well.Prawn Cocktail - They were decent, but they definitely weren't thoroughly deveined which was kind of off-putting. Cocktail sauce almost seemed like it was seasoned with crushed red pepper rather than horseradish. I really didn't like it and prefer a more traditional cocktail sauce. My wife thought it was interesting and enjoyed it being a little different.Semolina Stuffed Clams - These were interesting and I have mixed feelings. The stuffing really reminded me of a thanksgiving stuffing, which I wasn't expecting. It was also nice that they weren't oily like stuffed clams can be in restaurants.Rigatoni All-Amatriciana - This dish was hands down my absolute favorite of the evening and I thought this was exceptional. House pasta was really tasty and cooked perfectly. There was a nice serving of lobster and the heat was really well balanced. Not quite as spicy as a fra diavolo sauce and it had a more complex flavor as well. Really nice dish.Mussel Scampi - I liked this dish a lot but I'm not sure I'd order it again, as the shishito peppers were an interesting twist on a classic. I really liked that this wasn't overly fishy, as I've had some mussel pasta dishes in Hoboken that were really off putting. This was good, but definitely not a traditional scampi.Overall, I think this place is a great addition to Hoboken and I'm sure they'll do well. Hoping I can bring this review up to 5 stars on my next visit!
