2021-11-01,5,Both the bolognese and their specialty pizza were to die for. Really good authentic Italian, and the place was super ambient on a friday night! :)
2021-10-28,5,I love the food here! My cousins and I did family style and just shared 3 pasta dishes: rigatoni pesto, penne vodka, and a sausage orriechette. It was all so good but the pesto was my favorite! The calamari is also very good! Highly recommend.
2021-10-24,4,Solid 4! Haven't been back in years so I was excited when we were able to grab a table Saturday night around 7pm for 3! Our server was very nice and we didn't feel rushed out at all despite how packed it was both inside and outside. We ordered Caesar salad and Burrata. Great to share! We then ordered the Mussels, You Want a Pizza Me and Seafood Margherita pasta (for one) it was huge. The pasta was very fresh and delicious. I loved everything but would likely try a different pizza next time and pasta since they had a lot of delicious options! We also had 2 bottles of red wine- I thought they were BYOB but they aren't!! (I believe they have a corking fee) I am looking forward to coming back- great location and overall good meal!!
2021-10-21,3,Food was good, service was ok. It was kind of dead in the restaurant yet I had to keep asking for water. This is a BYOB but they charge a fee for wine and any individual can or bottle you open when it's multiple bottles.
2021-10-09,4,There was no wait to get in and the staff was really lovely and attentive. The food came out quickly and was very good. The liquor license now is a big plus. We got a bottle of wine to share and cocktails after. Although the food is good, it's not quite the same as it used to be under the previous owner. But, still good quality food and a great dinner experience!
2021-09-13,4,So after going in person once and having a pretty iffy experience we definitely wanted to go back and give them a second chance. We went rather early tonight before they got busy.  We were greeted instantly and given our choices of where to sit. We started with the peach margarita and a bottle of red wine. The peach margarita I'm told was really really good. We ordered the delicious fig snd truffle honey pizza. It was amazing. It was exactly what we were craving today. We went for the Caesar salad with shrimp and vodka chicken parm with cavetelli. Honestly that chicken parm is fantastic. I wouldn't get anything else there personally. I usually order that in most places around but nobody does it better. Lastly we ordered the pistachio tartufo for dessert. Another fantastic dish. It was perfect for the summer heat and really tasteful. The service was on point throughout the entire meal. This is exactly how we expected it would be and most likely caught them on a really off night the first time. We will without a doubt be back especially with some of the best Italian around!
2021-09-02,5,Consistently good food and service. Reasonable prices. Nice atmosphere. Great for a date night.
2021-08-21,2,We order food to go once every two week but we took my parents yesterday and the service was subpar. We waited about 45 mins before asking the status of our food. The servicer said it will be ready in 5 mins. 20 mins later it started to drizzle so we asked can we cancel our food. They didn't try to keep us which means they probably were not done making the food. We may still order food but we will never go back here in person. P.S. the chicken parm and marsala are great.
2021-08-16,5,Delicious food awesome cocktails and friendly employees definitely will go back and recommend
2021-08-11,5,Mouthwatering pasta! My friend raved about the good pasta at Margherita's so she brought me to try it out. The place has a cute romantic vibe with the decor. It is a small space though with a lot of tables inside which I did not like. Other than that we were sat quickly and the waiter was very sweet. We only had waters since we had been drinking prior. We got our food pretty fast. My bolognese was the best I've ever tasted. The meat sauce had such a nice flavor and the ricotta gave it a nice kick. I also love that it was served with pappardelle. I tried my friends pesto pasta since I had never had that type of pasta before and wow!! I thought the pesto taste would be strong but it was not. So delicious! Overall it was a smooth experience and I'm definitely returning to get more pasta!
2021-08-11,5,Went back to Hoboken for the day with our kids, haven't been back in almost 2 years. This was one of our favorite spots and figured pizza would be good for kids--new ownership was obvious BUT what an impressive renovation! Decor was gorgeous. We ate outside but then it began to rain and the staff helped us move ourselves and the kids inside before it started to get bad. Angela, our waitress, was particularly courteous and kind. No one was upset by the kids making noise, and they threw in a little vanilla ice cream. What great improvements to an already great spot! We will be back!
2021-07-22,2,Claudia believes I was mistaken that I don't know what I'm looking at when eating.  This bolognese lacked the soffritto (carrots, onions, celery garlic). Not only did I not see it, the taste reflected it as well. Aromatics add complexity. I cook so I know a little more than the average.  The arrabbiata was basically marinara sauce with tabasco.  The taste was incorrect. Tabasco belongs in mexican cuisine, not italian. My date barely ate her meal.  The waitress didn't even care to ask if everything was ok.  I understand things get rushed during busy moments. If I was the waiter I would have asked what was wrong.  I would have comped the dish and brought the matter to management and chef. 25 years in business has nothing to do with anything. All we have is the present moment.   I'm just keeping things real.  Hopefully my review will make this establishment even better.   In conclusion Margherita is a decent restaurant for locals wanting a meal.
2021-07-21,4,Great pasta, great portions, great prices. What's not to love? This is one of our favorite Italian spots in Hoboken for both dine in and take out. If your lucky enough to be there on a day when they are serving their spicy vodka sauce, definitely take advantage!
2021-07-18,5,Decent food & drinks, always friendly staff and very relaxed and down to earth atmosphere. I feellike they always have a place for you, I never reserved a table and always could get one even if the restaurant is almost full. Portions here are large, and everything tastes fresh. They have tables for large group of ppl, I mean it's really nice place for casual dinner or lunch with friends or family. Love this place, eat here ones a week for a long time!
2021-07-11,5,My go to place in Hoboken. The food is always fresh and you can taste its homemade pasta. Friendly staff, great seating indoors and outside. Love it here.
2021-07-06,5,Stopped by while visiting family in New Jersey. Great service and food was great but baked clams were our favorite. I will definitely come back
2021-07-05,4,A great Italian spot in the middle of Washington St. I recommend trying their pizza and their entrees I enjoyed their lobster  ravioli and would like to try their pizza next, I hear it's quite good and also dining in is quite an experience with their quaint rustic decor , perfect for a date and they do serve alcohol it used to be only BYOB, but now they have a bar.  They have specials and a popular pie is the mamma Mia cheesy pizza which is delish and also the garden st pie. Their chicken parmigiana is also very popular, but also vegetarian options.  Prices are average and moderately priced and they accept cash or credit card. They don't take reservations it's first come first serve, it's a must try. Enjoy  .
2021-07-03,5,Everything was phenomenal! The food was delicious along with the dessert and I loved the ambiance of the outdoor seating especially on a beautiful summer day. Definitely coming back!
2021-06-30,5,I've travelled to 62 countries around the world and the stuffed clams at Margherita's are the best I've ever had! A must if you come to Hoboken.
2021-06-16,1,I came here because of the good reviews in Yelp and I'm totally disappointed in the quality of the food. We order the veal Milanese and it is so dry and oily and has no flavor. And that dish is a special weekly course. The pasta is very bland . The food is bad and extremely overpriced. Never want to come back
2021-06-09,5,Love love love this place in Hoboken NJ!Lovely little Italian place downtown. This pasta bolognese with burrata cheese is the best I have ever had! 5 stars for this dish. They use 3 types of meat: pork, beef and veal to make the sauce and it was VERY TASTY! The pizza was also good but I would come back for the pasta! The place Issa very clean. Their bathrooms were spotless and that is how you can tell of their kitchen is clean too. Look at the bathrooms; if they are clean so is the kitchen and food! The service was nice and friendly and I would definitely go back! This place is a must go and try! Enjoy!
2021-05-31,2,They are really slow, we waited more than thirty minutes for the appetizer. They didn't take our order for a long time. The food is great tho. If you have a lot of time and if you're patient, you should visit this place.
2021-05-18,5,This place is a must try! The service is great. The food is delicious. I've gone a few times and no matter what I decide to get, it's always amazing plus it's BYOB.
2021-05-04,5,Haven't had really good pizza in a while. Their Gluten Free margarita hit the spot and did not disappoint! It was flavorful and didn't look or taste like it came out of a box. They made an exception for me even though there was an error and I appreciated that so much. Great service, super fast delivery, and great tasting food. Couldn't recommend more.
2021-05-02,5,This was our first time eating out in a year! It was absolutely incredible! The service was fantastic and very covid aware which I loved. The food delicious. The waitstaff was patient and polite. The overall experience made a perfect "first night out since being vaccinated" dinner!!!We decided to try Margherita's as we had both never been. We did not make reservations but they were incredibly nice to seat us right away. Our waitress was really sweet and let us check out the menu on our phones while she brought over bread, olive oil, and Parmesan cheese. Their olive oil is the BEST!!!!!!! Also the fresh mozzarella is AMAZING!!!I am Gluten Free and the waitress was so amazing and super careful with my order. I ordered an arugula salad with grilled chicken which was perfection. The chicken was so juicy and seasoned perfectly!! My boyfriend got Penne Vodka with Chicken. He said the pasta was so fresh tasting and the sauce was really delicious!!! The food came out hot. I really loved that no one rushed us to eat. We met the lovely owners Matt and Nicole. They came over to say hello which I loved!!! They are the NICEST and most down to earth people. That's the BEST part about small businesses in Hoboken you get to meet the people who put their heart and soul into it. 5 stars all the way..from start to finish the meal was perfect!!! We will definitely be back!!
2021-04-30,5,Awesome food, great service...perfect environment. We truly enjoyed the food and can not wait to go back with friends. I appreciate the atmosphere and the attention to the details such as a sparkling clean restaurant and the lovely plants are a plus!
2021-04-26,4,Delicious Italian food, filling portions, tasty cocktails. This place offers outdoor seating and the waiters and waitresses are friendly. I tried the tiramisu, pappardelle  Bolognese,and chicken penne allá vodka. All items were freshly made and were enough for left overs.
2021-04-24,5,The food here is amazing.  We just decided to stop by on a Saturday at around 1pm and it wasn't packed.  There were seats both indoor and outdoor.   We opted to stay inside.  I ordered the ricotta toast and my fiancé got the sausage hash.  Both dishes were amazing!  The ricotta toast had white truffle honey which wasn't overwhelming and was so good. The arugula and tomato salad paired well with it.  My fiancé loved his sausage hash.  Overall we would definitely visit again
2021-04-22,3,Ordered takeout. It was okay but there is better italian in area. Shouldve ordered from il tavalo. Vodka penne was fine, nothing special. Same with calamari. Food was average, but overpriced for the value.
2021-04-20,5,Margheritas is our go to spot. Everything is 10/10 food, service, staff, drinks, byob. This is one of the best places in Hoboken. I have not had one bad meal or experience here. The inside is gorgeous and outdoor seating is amazing. We come here at least once a week  pesto pasta is amazing and pizza is also awesome need to try different things because we come here all of the time. the staff is one of the friendliest here in Hoboken. Overall favorite restaurant. NOT pictured prosciutto and bufala mozz appetizer because we ate it all. Also mozzarella sticks are amazing!
2021-04-17,5,Best chicken cutlet sandwich in all of Hoboken. Hands down. BEST bread. So warm and soft and crisp. With chicken cutlet and peppers and arugula and tomato. Amazing. So worth it. The penne vodka used to be the best in the world (a few years back, before remodeling) but it's not as good anymore. Still has capers tho.
2021-04-08,5,This was the perfect place for our first outdoor dining adventure with a toddler and infant. There was space to park the stroller next to the table. It was pasta all around for everyone. The pasta was cooked just right, rigatoni pesto with sundries tomatoes. What made it better? Obviously a fig basil lemonade on a warm night. Will be back with the kids. The staff was great.
2021-04-05,4,Ok wow this place is 5 stars just for the burrata alone. I don't think I've ever had such fresh and creamy and absolutely stellar burrata before. We ordered one more after we devoured the first one. We decided next time we come- each person will get their own personal burrata. No sharing. TOO GOOD. Also the bread that comes with it is divine. Perfectly toasted on the outside and soft on the inside. But the pastas came and drinks came and they were all mediocre at best. The ravioli skin was too thick and filling was nothing to rave about. The eggplant for some reason looked and tasted like fried tofu. The penne vodka was disappointing. The only pasta that had robust flavor was the FUSILLI W BROCOOLI RABE AND SPICY SAUSAGE. That was really great except every pasta was over cooked. I wish they got it al dente. For our drinks- the peach margarita did not have any peach flavor whatsoever. It was just a plain margarita. Service was 10/10 though. Super nice staff and allowed us to order off the dinner menu during lunch. So we were super grateful for that. GET THE BURRATA THO FRFR!!!
2021-03-16,5,A+ showing of chicken parm marinara AND VODKA SAUCE options. @ChinCanParm has officially declared it the summer of margs after this. One of the best in Hoboken
2021-03-08,4,Pasta and pizza was good. Service was good, nice ambiance!
2021-03-07,4,The food is delicious from the bread to the pasta. We ordered the pappardelle with all beef sauce and burrata. All great, but a huge star off  (and honestly if it wasn't during a pandemic I would take off more stars) for their service which seemed incredibly attentive to everyone else but for some reason took 20 minutes to take our order, then didn't give us everything we had ordered and generally ignored us while having 2 waitstaff attend to the same tables at some instances. I'd do takeout if anything because the pasta was that good but wouldn't subject myself to that type of treatment again.
2021-02-23,3,I'll start this review by saying social distancing is not recognized here, as customers who sit at the right side tables are not separated by 6 feet from other parties. If this bothers you, I suggest you do take out.I came here on a Sunday for a late lunch. It's a small but quaint restaurant. Bread was served, and while it was a bit tough, it's still free bread. I opted for the Fusilli with Broccoli Rabe & Spicy Sausage, and other members of my party got the Chicken Francese and the Chicken parm. My Fusilli with Broccoli Rabe & Spicy Sausage was tasteless and the bottom of the bowl was filled with the white wine reduction. It was not fun to eat, and I ended up picking at most of it. I tried a small piece of the chicken francese, which was flavorful and filling. The chicken parm was enjoyed by members of my party. I saw a very cute pink drink that I chose to try. It was supposed to be watermelon fig but mostly tasted like fig. I did not enjoy my drink. Prices are average for the portion sizes, but I'd stick to their pizzas because they looked good and are moderately priced.
2021-02-15,3,This is strictly around takeout orders. I love the food here but when you order food and are told a specific time then that should be adhered too.  I was told 35 minutes and I got there right around the and was then told it wasn't ready yet which was not a big deal.  I then had to wait an additional 20-25 minutes for my food to be ready. That is unacceptable especially in these times when so much of their orders are takeout.   On a normal day I would give four stars.
2021-02-14,5,We ordered dinner for Valentine's Day and got a few dishes off the specials menu - it was ABSOLUTELY amazing. By far best Italian in hoboken!!!
2021-02-14,2,This is disgusting. And I literally love all pizza. Even 7/11. There is no sauce, crust is barely cooked.
2021-02-09,5,Wow the food here is AMAZING! They do not take reservations it is first come first serve. The restaurant is not big but decorated very nicely inside. The staff were pleasant and attentive. This restaurant has a full bar and it is also BYOB! We ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and they were really good! We were all amazed at how great each plate tasted! We will definitely be returning here soon!
2021-02-05,3,This was my first time trying Margheritas and I did take out. I've been wanting to try after seeing pictures of the food on different posts. I ordered the mozzarella sticks as an appetizer which was pretty good. They weren't greasy or overly breaded. They had just the perfect amount of mozzarella in each one. We also ordered the Pappardelle Bolognese and the Chicken Parmigiana. The Pappardelle Bolognese definitely looked better in the photos. The taste was flavorful however we felt it needed more sauce. It began to dry out. I wasn't a fan of the chicken parm. The pieces of chicken were very thin and not that much cheese were on them. I did enjoy their sauce however. I also order the cannoli which were perfect bite sized cannolis what were so good and just enough to satisfy the sweet tooth. When I ordered they told me it would take 45 mins but when I got there in about 35 mins it seemed my food had been sitting for a minute. The food was no longer hot. I'm a firm believer that restaurant food taste better in person at the restaurants. I would like to try this place again but to eat there and hopefully update my review.
2021-02-03,4,Incredible pasta and apps. We've gotten the mussels in white wine sauce (spicy) and a few pastas that have been drool-worthy. I'd skip the pizza, though, as it doesn't feel like the authentic NY/NJ pizza we're used to.
2021-01-28,5,Cute little Italian restaurant. Nice staff. Big portions and delicious food. We ordered the raviolis, garlic bread, salmon and bolognese. Definitely will be coming back again.  Kind of a small place wouldn't recommend for a family needing high chairs etc during busy hours.
2021-01-24,5,SO delicious. Had to wait a long time but once seated the staff was impeccably nice, quick service, and AMAZING pizza. Can't wait to come back!
2021-01-23,5,This is my favorite Italian restaurant in Hoboken. The penn Vodka and the veal sandwich is my favorite!!!!
2021-01-17,4,This review is solely for takeout. We ordered Margherita pizza with pepperoni and penne a la vodka with vegetables. Both were delicious! Pasta portion was large and both were well worth the price. We really enjoyed it. Pickup was easy and no issues with it.Did notice that indoor dining was pretty full inside, but they had heating lamps with tables outside and some people were dining. So you have the option of both.Will definitely order takeout again from here and recommend to anyone looking for some great Italian food!
2021-01-03,4,This was my first time here. We came for the pasta and was not disappointed. I have seen the Instagram photos and have been dying to try this place. The staff was friendly, attentive and served up hot French bread upon arrival. We shared an Argula salad with fresh mutz, roasted peppers  and tomatoes. The salad was big enough for three people. Topped off with a balsamic drizzle it was fresh and delicious. I had the Pappardelle Bolognese topped with ricotta.  This was an excellent choice. It was so good, I actually ate the entire plate, which was big enough to share with someone. The restaurant observed Covid guidelines for distancing and capacity. The staff were wearing masks and there was hand sanitizer available.  Overall a very pleasant experience and definitely looking to come back to try some of the other pasta dishes. The only down side was that I was too full to try the homemade Tiramisu.
2020-12-29,5,I ordered delivery for seafood Margherita and vodka sauce penne pasta with shrimp. This place is perfect when you want to just wear pajamas and do pasta and wine party. (You get to enjoy the pasta purely - I felt like I was Julia Roberts from Eat Pray Love but pasta version)Seafood Margherita was superb. The linguine was homemade and chewy. Tomato sauce was thick and amazing. This will definitely be my go to menu if I order from this place again.Vodka sauce penne pasta was good but I think I got into thick seafood Margherita's tomato sauce more. I added shrimps with a little bit of doubt and worries because most restaurants give you small shrimps. But this one came with prawn like shrimps and it went well with penne pasta.I gave 5 stars but beware of the pasta portion which is huge and they mostly pair with wine so well you will end up drinking up your wine too much.I will order homemade tiramisu and cheese pizza for pajama wine movie nigh next time.Stay safe :)
2020-12-14,2,For several years this restaurant has been a personal favorite never had issues or complaints a few weeks ago however was a different story i called in an order and asked for a dish that I've had plenty of times while dining in and was told it could not be made i proceeded to order something on menu asking for one item to be altered and was placed on hold for 5 minutes to then be told we don't do that here which i know is a total lie as I've had it times before needless to say after picking up my order the food was just okay not the amazing flavorful dishes I've had before the biggest let down wad the unwillingness to even add the item to my dish because it wasn't anything out of the way needless to say i live a half hour away and drove from far just to have their food both flavor and service were lacking I'll triple think before returning shut a shame because my job family and i have been long time customers
2020-12-08,4,Stopped in here randomly after spending a day day-drinking on the pier. We were able to be seated quickly without a reservation despite the dinner rush's slow trickle in.Kicked things off with some complimentary bread and very reasonably priced wine. For dinner we had the pasta (pictured) and a nice pepperoni pizza with green peppers. Both were delicious.Great place to stop by and eat outdoors (if available).Go here fam.
2020-11-29,5,Went here about a month ago. Tons of outdoor seating with heated lamps Came here with a group of six people, and we all ordered our own entree not realizing how large the portions were. Would definitely recommend sharing!Their pizza/ pasta are on point, absolutely delicious.Big plus- they have a full bar however still allow BYOB. While waiting for our table, we walked to the liquor store a block away to get a few bottles of wine.Will definitely be coming back!
2020-11-21,5,Worth the wait! Such a gem. Pesto pasta was to die for and the Margherita pizza was the best in the area-- to no ones surprise! Love that it's BYOB and right on Washington to people watch. Amazing date night spot-- we actually ate here 2 weekends in a row! Looking forward to coming back.
2020-11-14,1,So I don't eat meat and I don't eat fish.  Every time I've eaten in the restaurant I've been accommodated and they've made me a pasta with red sauce and vegetables.  I just called for takeout and asked for rigatoni, capers, and onions.  Not only was the woman who took my order extremely rude, but apparently the manager told her that they cannot make me a rigatoni dish with capers, onions and red sauce.  I had been adamant about supporting restaurants during COVID but I will NEVER go to this place again.  The response to my request was 'Umm we don't do that here' ... well since you don't make simple pasta I'm done with you!
2020-11-08,5,Not sure if they have always done delivery and I missed it but happy to add this to my weekly rotation. Food is always the best quality and friendly people.
2020-11-07,5,Such good Italian food! Our faves are the garlic bread and chicken parm w penne vodka sauce
2020-11-06,4,We have had Margherita's both in the restaurant & as takeout. The food has always been delicious! Great pasta offerings, excellent chicken cutlet sandwiches, and good service.
2020-11-01,5,Food here is always amazing. The pappardelle Bolognese is so good but I forgot to take a picture of it, it's very tasty. I got the chicken francese and it was delicious and lemony. My mom got the chicken Florentine which she said was really good especially the potatoes. We ate outside and they had the heat lamps which was great because it was a little chilly outside
2020-10-23,5,Awesome!!!! The bolognese is delicious, the clam oreganata delicious, key lime pie delicious!!! Full Bar, and BYOB, gluten free options. Awesome music, nice vibe, what's not to love .
2020-10-09,2,Service was good and I liked the outdoor seating, but the food was honestly terrible.
2020-09-29,5,After seeing so much about this place on Yelp and IG about their amazing pasta, I had to come see what this place was about. I popped over on a Friday evening around 7 PM and was able to be immediately sat. They have plenty of indoor and outdoor seating and I will say, even though I sat inside, they had everyone spaced out enough to where it didn't make me feel uncomfortable at all. I was able to sit in the small nook in the window right under the fun neon sign and enjoy the view of everyone else on the street. The customer service was superb, they have fantastic COVID precautions in place, everyone was wearing masks, sanitizer was available, and all the menus were via QR code! Strong start. I got their rose Aperol spritz, their penne arrabiata (hello spice!), Pappardelle Bolognese (it was everything I had hoped it would be and then some), and their baked clams (*chefs kiss* perfection). I ended the meal with their tiramisu (basically devoured it within seconds of it reaching the table) and left so happy and slowly waddled my way home.  The ambiance, customer service, and quality of their food was superb and they handled their adaptations for COVID incredibly well. I'm super happy that I came here for dinner and am looking forward to going back again and again in the future. 15/10 would highly recommend for a great night out.
2020-09-26,4,Everything we ordered was delicious, from the burrata to pizza to pasta. BYOB...have never left dissatisfied!
2020-09-18,1,Worst service ever. Ordered delivery at 6:45 pm and our food NEVER arrived. We called twice, once at 8:00 and once at 8:30, and was told our food was out for delivery. When we called back and asked the lady on the phone what the deal was and told her that we were concerned about our food being cold, she could not even put together a sentence and hung up on us. Very, very disappointed in this business! Do not recommend. If you can't handle delivery than don't do it.
2020-09-13,1,Wow!  In today's environment would think that customer service would make or break a restaurant!  We ordered food tonight at 750ish on their website as we wanted to support them directly. After 75 minutes (the site originally said 45 to 50 minutes for delivery), we called and inquired about the status. At which time the girl who answered the phone told us that it went out already and that it will take 15 to 20 minutes to get to us. We live 6 blocks away from the restaurant!!!  We then asked a simple question - wouldn't our hot food be cold by then?  She then proceeded to hang up for us without any further answers!!! Shockingly when I tried to call back no one would answer!  So I had to use my boyfriends phone and miraculously someone answered!  When I asked to speak to a manager, he basically said he was sorry and that due to the street closing in Hoboken that's why it would take that long!  Now that we got our food 90 minutes later - it's as expected COLD!
2020-09-12,3,The aesthetics of this place is amazing. The food looks really good and it's perfect for Instagram haha. The service was great as well! Me and my friends ate outdoor seating and the ambiance and everything was nice. However, the food was very lackluster. I'm not sure if we just ordered the wrong things but none of us were big fans about our dishes. It wasn't terrible though but since it looked super appetizing we expected more.
2020-09-12,5,Went to Margherita's for outdoor dining and the food was fantastic! They had a lot of good options on the menu and I went with the watermelon basil lemonade and the pappardelle bolognese which I highly recommend.
2020-09-01,5,We recently used Margherita's to cater an event in our apartment building and couldn't have been happier. Claudia was wonderful to work with and helped answer all of my (many) questions to ensure we had everything we needed. The food arrived on time and the setup was seamless. All of the entrees were delicious and we're still enjoying the leftovers today :)
2020-08-21,4,I'm visiting family in NJ and drove to Hoboken to have dinner. And decided to eat at this cute little Italian restaurant and it was delicious. They provided warm French bread and I had the penne vodka pasta with shrimp. So good! My bf had sea bass with crab meat with spinach and it was so good too. It's a must try!
2020-08-19,5,I came on a Saturday around 6:30pm and i was expecting to having to wait a little while to get seat but we didn't have to wait at all because there were a couple of seats available. We got seated instantly outside of course as they are following Covid guidelines. All the staff was also wearing masks as they should and the staff was so friendly and attentive, making sure we were comfortable and all. I decided to give the pappadelle bolognese a try and honestly one of the best pastas i ever tried. I am a big fan of Italian food and this one did not disappoint. It was cooked to perfection and it was so flavorful. If you decide to give this place a try the pasta bolognese is a must! I will definitely be coming back and ordering that again. Literally still day dreaming about it!
2020-08-17,3,One year this place won the St Ann's pizza contest. I'm not sure how. It's not terrible but... I don't get how.
2020-08-15,5,Service:- They had great COVID precautions in place, unlike some of the other places on Washington street - Servers were wearing masks, gloves, and sanitizer was available - The waitress I had was so lovely! Food:- Rigatoni pesto w/ sundried tomatoes - You want a Pizza me (arugula, prosciutto, tomatoes) - Both dishes were tasty and larger portions than I had expected. I'd recommend either of themDrinks:- Treat yourself and get a frozen aperol spritz..or three!! I'd come again just for that drink. Overall, I had a great dining experience at Margherita's and I'll be back another time to try something new. Cheers!
2020-08-12,3,Visited my daughter and asked her for a GREAT Italian Food place and she said that Margheritas was the BEST around West NY. The food was delivered on time and I was very excited to try this place being that I ate at a couple of really good places in Hoboken in the past. The food was Good but nothing to write home about. We ordered two fried calamari appetizers $15 a pop and it was like rubber. Totally overdone and the size of the appetizers were really chincy. My wife had eggplant parm that was tasteless and soggy, I had the Bolognese that was very good my son had the Chicken Alfredo that was EHHH not cheesy enough and bland and my daughter had Chicken in Vodka Sauce that she said was very good. Maybe was expecting to much of this place the way my daughter hyped it up but for the money wasn't worth it. I would go back to the other places in Hoboken for Italian next time.
2020-08-01,4,Ordered the bolognese and the rigatoni with Pesto. The bolognese with burrata was probably the best I've ever had. The pesto was not good in my opinion but I will be back for the bolognese.
2020-07-25,5,The food was great and the service was amazing!! The waitress Jesenia was so sweet and attentive.  Definitely feel safe to go back!!! Drinks to go were amazing!!! Thank you for the amazing food and service!
2020-07-17,4,delicious italian food!! first of all, their garlic bread is perfection. i got the penne vodka, and i think it may have been the best i've EVER HAD! my cousin got the linguine and clams and she said it was delicious as well. i have to deduct one star because they forgot to give us forks, which made eating this during our picnic very challenging but we made due. (used garlic bread to scoop pasta... yea it was messy haha) none the less it's super yummy and i highly recommend! check out my insta @kaiteatsfood for more!
2020-07-11,4,Penne vodka good! Wish the seasoning was better on the chicken parm.  The chicken Marsala was good but it was sweeter which I personally like. But overall a good experience.
2020-06-23,3,Great outdoor seating and friendly staff. Food was fresh but a bit bland. We had the penne vodka, chicken Francese and garden salad. Chicken francese needs a bit more flavor, it was missing lemon and butter seasoning. Overall, a great first dining out experience after Covid.
2020-06-23,2,Very sad with our order, we ordered for our office which was maybe 10 people and let me tell you it was expensive, like close to $400 expensive. BUT, we were blown away with how much came with the orders and how beautiful they looked, until we tasted it, every thing was super bland, no flavor and the burrata tasted a bit spoiled, which was $18 came with a few cherry tomatoes-few strings of basil and thats it, and unfortunately was thrown away. Over all an egh rating. Expected it to be amazinggg also bc they have been in Hoboken for a while now.
2020-06-07,5,Great Italian restaurant for date night. I haven't been here before the renovations, but I love this spot. The ambiance definitely feels like a date night spot, with dim lights and soft music in the background. We were surrounded by couples and then it's just me and my mentee celebrating her getting two internships. It ended up being a great time. She ordered a chicken Caesar salad and I ordered the eggplant parm. We both loved our dishes and the bread they served was amazing with the olive oil. I don't know why it's so good, but I ended up using the bread to soak up leftover marinara sauce I had on the plate and it was perfection. Staff is very friendly and our waitress was very sweet and checked in with us multiple times throughout our meal. Once things open up again, I'll be back here with my husband for a date night.
2020-05-30,5,Last night, my wife and I ordered Margherita's for the first time since it reopened, and it was outstanding. Our two pizzas arrived promptly, warm, and deliverd with a smile. The pizza was excellent! Thank you Margherita's for giving us our new go to pizza place!
2020-05-09,5,The Chicken Parm is the best I've EVER had. Delicious! My favorite Italian place in Hoboken.
2020-05-08,5,One of the best take-out meals that we have had during the lockdown. No complaints about the size of entrees. The grilled pork chops were excellent...hope it becomes a permanent item on the menu!
2020-04-21,3,Amazing, Delicious, perfectly seasoned and cooked pizza with a crust you just can't throw away! The food?? SKIP IT... Since the reopening we have tried several menu items including ravioli and clams with linguine entree. The 6 ravioli ($18) were most likely frozen and arrived nearly ice cold. Next time I want something like this I'll go to the dairy section of Acme and have my choice of packaged items. Unfortunately, the worst item I've have from this location was the Clams and linguine. Seriously? Use some pepper flakes, some salt and maybe even some stock instead of flavorless water. ($26???) Also make sure your order is correct and they have the proper advertised items in stock, or you'll be waiting for hours. Stick with the pizza.
2020-04-13,5,Decided to order up my solo Easter dinner from Margherita's and was so happy I did!!! Wow. The food was exceptional, even tho it was takeout. I decided on  the Broiled Sea Bass with Crab Meat - and cannolis for dessert. It arrived fast and hot and was so, so, so good! Thank you for staying open and providing us food when the world is not so great right now. Can't wait to come back and dine in but until then.... (So looking forward to the leftovers today too!)
2020-03-30,4,Nice place when you are not looking for anything out if the ordinary , byo keeps pixels way down also
2020-03-08,5,Amazing place and service!! Came in on a busy Friday night, server was so polite and friendly! Food came out so fast and fresh! Reasonably priced and worth the wait AND is BYOB!! Definitely will be coming back!
2020-03-07,1,Came here with my son and his girlfriend. Thought I would treat them to a nice Italian meal in Hoboken. Needless to say I did not make a good impression with Margherita.  I can honestly say I won't be back. Pasta was way overcooked.  The chicken parm was some chicken disguised in a whole lot of bread crumbs doused with sauce and cheese on top of overcooked pasta. Why bother.  I could MAYBE see how someone could give a 3 star review, but 5?  People seriously?
2020-03-06,5,Margheritas is a must go in Hoboken! It is quaint, newly renovated, family owned and a perfect spot for any group! They do not take reservations however, you can leave your name and walk across the street to another local bar to grab a drink while you are waiting. And trust me it's worth the wait! Every dish we ordered was amazing and you taste the authenticity of the Italian food. Major plus that this place is also BYOB!!
2020-02-22,4,So Margherita's had great service and they were accommodating for my anniversary. However the food was just good. It didn't leave an impression and it wasn't like anything to die for. The pasta was good and so was the tiramisu for dessert. However, we did LOVE the mussels. We have this thing where we try the mussels every where it's included on the menu... and honestly this one took the top spot. The sauce was excellent and we even asked for more bread to sop it up! We ate it so fast that I forgot to take a picture. Definitely the main highlight of the meal! Also this place is BYOB so don't forget the wine!
2020-02-21,5,My first visit to Margherita's, and I'll definitely be back! I know they were closed for a while because of a remodel, and they did a great job on the space. It's quaint and rustic with lots of exposed brick and hanging greenery. We came in for an early dinner at around 5:30 and it was fairly empty, but within an hour every table was occupied (and on a Thursday too). So, even if you don't plan to visit over a weekend I suggest looking into a reservation.The menu is large with all of the Italian classics, plus some interesting entrees on special. Pastas are $16-$22, and meat / seafood entrees are $20-$30. Pretty standard for the area and this type of spot.My sister and I shared a ceasar salad and the pappardelle bolognese. The split the salad into two individual portions which I always love. The salad was a dressed a little heavy for me, but luckily the dressing was creamy and delicious. Next time I'd just ask for a little less, or maybe on the side. The pasta absolutely stole the show. This dish normally comes topped with ricotta, but for an extra $3 you can sub for buffalo mozz and for an extra $8 you can sub for burrata. Because we were only sharing one main we decided to go big with the burrata. This was the best decision possible. Burrata is good standalone, and above a meaty bed pasta it's even better. The meat sauce was so good and flavorful. My only complaint is that the noodles were soft, I wish a bit more al dente. Portions are large! A salad and one pasta entree split amongst two was more than enough. Plus some tasty bread and olive oil to kick off the meal.Hoboken has an overwhelming amount of Italian eateries, and Margherita's is definitely not one to overlook. Mangia!
2020-02-17,5,I see why that girl took all her wheel of fortune girl used l her winnings to open this place back up. I don't see why it ever closed. Very good pizza and pasta and very cheap as well. Penne in vodka sauce with chicken for $14, very reasonable. A definite come back
2020-01-31,4,i had their ravioli and it was very good! filling lol. i just had 3 and u get 6. their bread was my favorite. soft inside and crunchy outside. the only few cons is that its very tight, loud, and long wait. luckily we only waited 15 mins for just 2 people. i would go back in the future though
2020-01-30,4,Went for lunch today. Had a great meal! The pasta lunch specials are so affordable and huge! My boyfriend and I split one and we were totally satisfied. Highly recommend!
2020-01-12,3,This was my second time coming to Margherita's. Once before they closed and first time since they reopened. Decor is much better, space is much better.Customer service was excellent. We started with the calamari. It was perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked. Crispy. The marinara was excellent too. It was perfectly flavored with herbs, it was not acidic. It was the perfect temperature. We love when the marinara is warm.We also ordered the chicken Florentine and the chicken parm. The Florentine was excellent!!! Delicious white sauce. The chicken was cooked perfect for both dishes. The spinach had garlic cooked with it, which was excellent. The potatoes were cooked perfect and were yummy! Just needed some salt and pepper on them. We highly recommend this dThe chicken parm of course had delicious marinara. The spaghetti was cooked perfect, al dente. The cheese was good. However, we have had better chicken parm at Augustinos so we wouldn't order the chicken parm again. But everything else was excellent!!! Very happy. It was $65 for two.Update:We tried the chicken Alfredo and meatballs today. The alfredo sauce was thick but the garlic flavor was missing and it was also missing pepper. The Alfredo also comes with peas and tomatoes in it, which I'm personally not a fan of. The chicken was cooked perfect but lacked flavor. Very bland. Grilled chicken is WAY better. Romano in Weehawken has a PERFECT Alfredo. Spaghetti was a little overcooked. We like al dente. Everything came out hot which was great. The meatballs were very dense with no texture. The marinara sauce was flavorful but acidic. We keep burping it lol. Overall, we would not order either of these dishes again. The bread that comes out first was hot and delicious. The butter melted nicely.
2020-01-03,5,Been walking past Margherita's for a couple months and finally made plans to go to dinner. Luckily got out of work early on a Friday and met my husband at 6pm with wine in hand (BYOB). Got a table within minutes, as you can't make a reservation. Good thing cause the place filled up quickly after. Ordered the bolognese with mozz which was exactly what I was looking for - delightful. My husband, who hates pasta dishes, even liked the few bites I allowed him to eat. He got the pepperoni pizza which was both spicy and sweet. When we left, we both agreed that we needed to come back soon and try something else!!
2020-01-02,5,What better first review of 2020 than my last dinner of 2019. I've been oh so patiently waiting for one of my favorite BYOB spots to reopen and on a walk down Washington the other weekend, I was delighted to see it finally was. No reservations but they do allow you to put your name on a list via phone, and not just in person, but you have to be able to make your table within 10 minutes of being notified. No problem as there are a million bars all around to grab a drink beforehand. Armed with two bottles of wine, we got our table around 8, pretty spot on to when they let us know to be ready for. We started with the mussels in white sauce and could not get enough bread to dip in it, so good. Me and my friend were both craving seafood pasta so we got the Margherita's seafood pasta for two. We could have fed another person there was so much food. But it was delicious so I ate well past my threshold. Mussels, shrimp, calamari, all. so. good. We got it in the red sauce and it was perfect, topped with lots of parmesan cheese. So, the table next to us was terribly loud and rude. Just so terrible. Nothing at all to do with the restaurant and we never ever held the restaurant accountable but they were incredibly sweet and treated us to coffees and desserts on the house to make up for what wasn't there fault to begin with. Our table split the tiramisu and cannolis. The cannoli was the better one for me, and although the tiramisu wasn't amazing, it was pretty good and satisfied my sweet tooth. And it's always perfect to end the night with a cappuccino. So happy they are open again and cannot wait to come back!
2019-12-13,2,We never went to the old Margherita's, calling it "the oversauced place," but we wanted to try the new one. The food was excellent--vegetables were not overcooked but held their snap, the pasta was delicious, the staff was friendly. I'd certainly order takeout from them. So why will I NEVER EVER COME HERE AGAIN? Because the noise level made for a totally annoying and uncomfortable experience. The bros at the tables were practically screaming, whoo-ing, and howling non-stop, and the women weren't much better. When did people start thinking that restaurants were their private living rooms? And why does the staff seem to encourage it? The experience, despite the delicious food, was so uncomfortable, that we left without ordering dessert--and we wanted dessert. Won't be here again.
2019-12-13,3,We stopped going there long before they closed for renovation because we thought the food had gone downhill, but we wanted to give it another try now that it has reopened. We had heard from a friend that it was "noisy" so we thought if we went early on a Thursday night maybe it wouldn't be so bad. Boy, were we wrong! It was quite possibly the loudest restaurant we've ever been in. Every table seemed to be shouting, and one table of 10 people in their late 20s/early 30s must have thought they were the only ones in the place because they were literally screaming like they were in a sports bar. No consideration for any other customers. My wife and I literally couldn't hear each other across the table. I know this is fairly typical these days in a lot of restaurants but some places will ask the customers to calm down if they are becoming disruptive, and Margherita's did nothing about that one table, where each of the 10 people (obviously drunk) was acting like an entitled jerk. When the food came it was quite good, so my rating of three stars is a cross between five for the food and one for the atmosphere. The service was good too--I can't blame the waitress or hostess for the type of people that were eating there, and they did their best. We will order from them online and eat at home if we want their food again, or maybe try it for lunch on a Tuesday or something when it won't be filled with screaming immature idiots who have no idea how to act in public.
2019-12-07,5,Believe the hype.  This place lived up to all of the buzz.  I hope Matt (owner) opens several more restaurants in Hoboken as he is levels above most other restauranteurs in the area.  The service was incredible.  Ambiance on point.  Food excellent.  The chicken Parm is the best I've had in a long time.  Bravo Margherita's.
2019-11-30,5,Margherita's has been a part of my life for as long as I remember. Just like everyone else I eagerly awaited the re opening of the restaurant and it was well worth the wait. Never in my life could I imagine that Margherita's could get better, but it did just that. It exceeded my expectations... by a long shot. Walking into the restaurant you are greeted by the lovely hostess and I must add that the vibe of the restaurant is aesthetically pleasing. It has a rustic Italian feel accompanied by classic musical hits to complete the pleasant atmosphere.The waiter was extremely attentive to our every need. We started off with the pizza. It was everything a pizza should be; homemade tomato sauce, perfect crust, topped off with just the right amount of fresh mozzarella cheese. As a certified pizza addict I have tried countless pizzas in the New York and Boston areas and I must say nothing can beat Margherita's Pizza, THE PERFECT PIZZA! The calamari was fresh, cooked just right, and tasted great paired up with the pizza to start off. I ordered the Chicken Florentine as my entree and it was absolutely exquisite. The plate presentation is something that should be noted as well. The white sauce complimented the chicken, spinach, and potatoes beautifully. The dish is truly a work of art. My party also ordered the Chicken Marsala and Chicken Parmigiana which were just as great. You cannot go wrong with any plate. For dessert I had a Tiramisu cake. SO SO GOOD! The Tiramisu cake is homemade, delicious, and will not disappoint.Overall, a heavenly experience in Margheritas. It is perfect for the family, to bring that special someone, or just to grab a quick bite. You do not need to go far to feel like you are in one of Italy's finest restaurants.  Huge props to the front staff, the chef, and the owner for continuing to hold Margherita's legacy as the finest food in Hoboken!
2019-11-30,4,Wait times are crazy! My fiancé and I went there in a Friday night with my daughter and another couple - put our names in at about 7:10 pm and we're told to come back in an hour. An hour  goes by and we return only to be told to give it another 20-30 minutes. We understand they just reopened about three weeks prior so they were extra busy. It was pretty cold and we were running out of places close to us that allowed us to sit and kill time. Almost everything in close vicinity is a bar, so it's not like we can stop and grab a drink until the table's ready. We ended up at the Dunkin' Donuts for the second wait time to pass.Well, after coming back and being told that they were still waiting for a table to get up, and that hopefully it would be only another 15 minutes or so...we waited and stared at the table holding us up from dinner for another 20 minutes. It was becoming increasingly frustrating to keep a cold and hungry 10 year old kid occupied and in good spirits. We finally were seated at 9:50! While I understand it's not the hostess' fault, I'd like to think that if people were waiting more than than an hour after the expected time they'd been told a seat would be ready, that they could have been a little more pushy with the table service in an effort to encourage any one who is taking an obnoxiously long time to leave. As for patrons who visit and see a small packed restaurant and people standing outside, perhaps a good rule of thumb is to  try to leave within 10-15 minutes after asking for a check. Asking for a check typically indicates you're heading out shortly. Staying an hour after asking for the check throws everyone off, the staff and those other patrons  waiting outside suffer. The hostess was apologetic and that helped. The staff was very accommodating, they quickly brought plates out and removed dirty dishes from the table. The food was amazing! Aside from a hair in the calamari, which of course was replaced immediately, the food was very tasty. Portions are large  and prices are good ~25+ for entrees. No kids menu by the way.
2019-11-26,5,Don't believe the imposters, this is the REAL Michael T and I have to say the new Margherita's is  fantastic. I visited on a busy Thursday evening and was seated right away. The first thing that struck me was the decor. The renovation has created an environment that is romantic and elegant, yet rustic and unpretentious. I was also delighted to find that the Puglia region of Italy, le radici della mia famiglia (the roots of my family!), was strongly represented on the restaurant's walls in the form of posters, maps, and photographs. I had the mussels in red sauce and the Regina Margherita (Queen Margherita) after taking much time to choose from several alluring options on the menu of creatively-named pizzas. The mussels tasted fresh out of the sea, and while the sauce was impeccable the mussels were not drowning in it. No gimmicks here like at chain restaurants who drown crappy meat in heaps of sauce. Just a good clean dish. As a connoisseur of authentic Napoletana pizza-making, I am naturally skeptical of new pizza restaurants and I have high expectations and a discerning palate. HOWEVER, this pizza was delicious. The San Marzano tomatoes in the sauce were so robust they nearly jumped right off the plate!  I could taste the quality and care in every bite of crust, and I'm still trying to figure out the zesty secret ingredient I swear I tasted in it (true story: my waitress, who was very attentive and sweet throughout the evening, ran over to my table at one point to ask why I was making so many puzzles faces). The Sicilian olive oil and fresh basil created a delightful finish and after-taste. I was dining alone that night and struck up a conversation with the girls at the next table, who let me try a bit of their pasta. Unlike most restaurant pasta that comes from the supermarket, the freshness was self-evident here. It tasted like something that's actually grown out of the ground. The new Margherita's exceeded my expectations and I can't wait to bring my parents there next time they visit the area. It is a house of good clean eating, unlike many American-Italian restaurants they serve you a heart attack on a plate. Every dish was prepared authentically, reminding me of the hills of Naples and the masserias of Puglia. One disappointment I must share however - I didn't leave room for dessert!
2019-11-25,5,My absolute favorite Italian restaurant in Hoboken (which says a lot given the number of Italian options around here!). Their rigatoni with pesto is legendary! Definitely recommend if you're in the area.
2019-11-21,5,Solid penne vodka with grilled chicken. Food all around looked super delish. I wish they had more dessert options but can't wait to go back!
2019-11-20,4,Wonderful little Italian restaurant! Wonderful staff, pleasant and friendly. The wait time is a bit long, it would be great if they incorporated a reservation system through Opentable or Resy. Other than that, the food was delicious and worth the wait! It's BYOB which is awesome. My fiancé and I came here for our anniversary, it was our first time and we loved it! We'll definitely be back for more.
2019-11-18,5,Without a doubt, this spot is still my favorite restaurant in Hoboken.  I was a customer for years before they closed for renovations.  I have been twice since they reopened and it's better than ever!  The ingredients are fresher, the service staff is friendly and attentive, and the renovation looks fantastic.  Make sure you try the pizza and the penne vodka.  Always end with a super fresh cannoli.  5 very big stars to the new Margherita's!! Great job on the re-opening!
2019-11-18,5,Ate there for the first time last evening and I thought their fresh pasta was the best I've had since being in Rome last spring. I was with 3 others and we all had a pasta dish. Portions were generous. We had the mozzarella and prosciutto appetizer and the mozzarella was a little creamy and very good. We had cannolis for dessert and were expecting small ones but they were full sized and just as delicious as the rest of the meal. The place is small and does not take reservations so be prepared to wait but well worth it. Staff is very friendly, excellent service.!
2019-11-16,2,The old Margheritas was always our go to for a great, inexpensive, Italian dinner. A few years before it closed down though, the quality and service noticeably went down hill, so we were excited about the renovation and new ownership. Unfortunately we were very disappointed. Both of our pasta dishes were so overcooked, they were essentially mush.  We let our server know, and she did the right thing by taking it off our tab. Regardless, it will make us think long and hard to visit again, especially since the original Margheritas was already in a state of decline.
2019-11-10,3,What happened to the food? My husband and I have been anxiously awaiting the reopening after renovations.   We were a little disappointed by the food quality and are hoping it's just a fluke as they get back up and running.  The menu was significantly condensed and the prices on some items have gone up. We ordered the calamari ($14.95 - quite high compared to other italian places) and the dish was nearly burnt to a crisp.  I've never had calarmari that was so overcooked it would easily snap in two.  Then my favorite dish, the pesto with sundried tomatoes, was very different than it was previously.  Was okay but the amount of basil was significantly reduced and the flavor was bland.We will be waiting a few weeks and then will try it again before making a final verdict, but disappointed this time.
2019-11-08,4,Margherita's has been closed for a long time for renovations, so I was stoked to return upon their reopening. As far as I know, this was their grand reopening weekend. Though they weren't taking reservations, I was able to put my name down on the wait list. Even better, when I was texted that my table was ready, I asked to be pushed down the list because I wasn't ready. They were very accommodating.The staff during dinner, however, were not as courteous. We felt rushed from the moment we sat down. Our waitress was seemingly in a hurry to take our order, and a nearby table of friends had expressed the same overbearing urgency.  Despite the service being a bit of a nuisance, the food was excellent. The baked clams appetizer was awesome. The chicken parm was delicious, and the portion was huge. The fussili with broccoli rabe and sausage was outstanding.If you're looking for a really good meal, look no further. Don't bank on attentive service however. With that being said, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt because they just re opened. That factor alone bumped the review from 3 to 4 stars. Hoping this place sticks around for good.
2019-11-05,5,After nine long months I am happy to report that my favorite restaurant of 25 years is back and better than ever. The renovations inside are beautiful and a perfect update that keeps the soul of the Margherita's I grew up with. The food is as amazing as ever and the updated menu keeps all of the best things you'd want. The additions to some of the traditional pasta dishes were the perfect updates to brighten up everyone's favorites (for ex the clam shells and cherry tomatoes to the linguini w clam sauce and the peas and cherry tomatoes to the fettuccini). A delicious meal as always!!!!!
2019-07-09,5,My go-to Italian spot in Hoboken! And the first-ever restaurant I ate at in the city I've called home for nearly four years :) they are currently undergoing renovations, and I'm so excited to see the new space and get my penne vodka fix!
2019-02-14,5,Nice lil corner restuarant that allows you to bring your own wine or beer in ! Food is delicious , waiting staff is friendly . It gets crowded on the weekends so come early .Old world motif from the 50's .
2019-02-09,5,The food here is UNREAL- some of the best Italian food I've ever had and I've been to Italy many times before so that's saying a lot. The pasta is homemade and their meat entrees are huge and incredible. I haven't got one bad thing from here before. If you order online for delivery during their lunch time, you can get lunch specials which are the same size as the dinner portions and half the price. They don't at all rip you off here. Best Italian food around! (& follow their insta for some drool-worthy photos)
2019-01-26,5,Great family meal at Margherita's Pizzeria.2 x 12 inch pizzas and 1 share pasta all for $58+tipService was friendly and helpful, food served quickly and was delicious.My 4 year old son claims the best pasta in Hoboken and I think I agree but I'd also add the pizza to that list too. Good Job! Will be back soon.
2019-01-25,5,Easily one of the best restaurants in Hoboken and some of the best Italian food I've had in general. BYO which is great and very reasonably priced. It's small and can get crowded at times so be sure to call before or come a bit early if it's the weekend. I've lived in Hoboken for over 5 years now and this is my go-to place to take people to show off how good the restaurants in Hoboken can be! If you're a fan of shrimp and pasta, the Shrimp Primavera is amazing. If not, whatever you order will probably be amazing too!
2019-01-18,2,Average, average, average...nothing special about this pizza restaurant. The food is average, the atmosphere is average, the seating stinks! I can see a subpar effort for a family style Italian seating which failed horribly. If you're dining out with one other person you will be miserable with the seating. We were literally sitting elbow to elbow with the party next to us, we can hear their conversations, smell their cologne and even read their texts!!!I'm not sure why this place have 4 stars but I would not give it more than a 2!
2019-01-09,5,I have to give Margarita's pizzeria a five star review, my experience overall was excellent! I have been wanting to go here for a while because I can actually smell the delicious Italian food from the street when passing by, and I finally had the chance to enjoy some as well. The clams appetizer and the spedini appetizer were delicious, tasty sauces and flavors do you enjoy. The margarita seafood pasta dish was incredibly satisfying, I enjoyed the garlic sauce and shrimp especially. My favorite out of everything that I have tried there, definitely the pizza! There were a ton of pizza selections that had toppings they already repaired, or the option of a cheese pizza and for a surcharge you can add other toppings. We had many meat toppings added to our pizza. I would definitely get this again, but it is also attempting to try something new :-)
2018-12-31,5,Great little Italian restaurant on Washington street. One of my favorite things about this place is that the food always comes out piping hot. It's also BYOB which is a plus. Their homemade pastas are delicious. For that reason I can't help but order pasta every time I go here. The food is consistently delicious. There could be a wait on a Friday or Saturday night but it is well worth it.
2018-12-23,5,Came here with my best friend, she's been here a fewTimes this was my first time and omg I'm a jersey born die hard American Italian food lover and from the bread to the mussels to pasta it was delicious the best I've had in awhile and fresh good quality food the sauce was phenomenal def coming back here with wine next time great service too!
2018-12-07,5,So. Good.I've been coming to Margherita's since I moved to Hoboken nearly 2 years ago and have only just recently learned how great they are for take-out/delivery, too.Quality is so great and the portions are massive. I find that I always get 2-3 meals out of a single dish so while the prices are fairly high, it's worth it. My go-to is the penne vodka but my friends all have their own unique go-to's so I'm convinced everything is probably delicious. We don't usually get the pizza but I have heard it's also great.Dining at peak times, you will probably have to wait as seating is limited but you can put your name down and wait it out in the bar across the street. I most recently went late on a Thursday night (~8:30pm) and it wasn't crowded at all so we sat 4 at a 6 person table immediately. And staff have always been very friendly to us!
2018-12-02,5,This place is so good! The service is also always great. I have celiac disease and their gluten free pasta is some of the best I've ever had and reasonably priced which is also rare to find.
2018-11-29,5,Have visited this place a few times now. The food in general is very tasty. My favorites are bruschetta and garlic bread for appetizer and penne vodka pasta for the main course. In our most recent visit, we tried the penne arrabiata pasta too which is also really good.
2018-11-27,4,omg this place totally lived up to my expectations! got the best chicken parmigiana of my lifeee! i special requested to have burrata and it was the best decision i ever made. try the calamari.. pasta was over cooked my only complaint
2018-11-26,5,We have ordered pizza delivery from here and the delivery was in time and pizza really delicious! My kids love it better than Napoli's and we do like it as well. I think it is one of the best pizzas in Hoboken! Will be checking out other dishes too.
2018-11-20,3,Margherita's used to be my favorite in Hoboken but I think it's gone downhill in recent years to just okay.  Specifically the cheese ravioli filling is not good.  And a lot of the food is over-garlicked. Please get better Margherita's!!
2018-11-15,5,Had a really great time at Margherita's. It's a small spot so gets crowded easily. We had dinner on a Sunday at 6pm and were lucky to get a table. Chicken parm was on point and the pasta was homemade! It had a nice texture. We also had some pesto rigatoni which was also tasty. Portions were huge so we brought some home. It's BYOB. Definitely dining here again.
2018-11-08,5,First and foremost, before you dine please take into account that parking is horrendous in Hoboken especially where Margherita's is located. Although, parking sucks but strongly believe that the food is so worth the hassle. It's very authentic and you'll experience that yourself once you walk in. The pizzeria had vintage decor and even photos of their family nicely framed on the walls. The aroma in this restaurant was very tempting so come hungry! As an appetizer, we ordered the spedini which is basically stuffed bread with cheese in a marinara sauce. I enjoyed it more than my mother did but we both agreed it was very flavorful. For dinner, I had pasta Bolognese topped with ricotta cheese and my mother had the eggplant parmigiana. The pasta seemed like it was made from scratch and the bologonese was very rich in flavor. My mother enjoyed her dish and thought it was perfectly cooked.  To end our dining experience, we tried their homemade tiramisu and loved it! We cleaned our plate and it was the best tiramisu I've ever ordered. We both felt like the portion was above average for an Italian restaurant and most definitely would be back.
2018-11-05,4,I had not been to Margherita's in about 10 years.  The lengthy wait time was always a deterrent, and my previous visit had only included a basic salad, so I had not been dying to give it another shot.  However, my friend felt differently and pushed for us to go there for a recent dinner.  It was an unseasonably warm fall evening, so we grabbed a table outside and received immediate attention.  We had decided not to indulge in the BYOB option and focused on the food instead.  My friend and I began with the Fresh Mozzarella Salad and a Side Order of Meatballs.  The salad started with a large plate of field greens and was topped with roasted peppers, tomatoes, thickly-sliced cheese, and a basil pesto.  While the tomatoes were not the juiciest, the mutz was light, creamy, and fresh.  The meatballs were firm and slightly dense and were laying in a bowl soaking up their sweet tomato sauce.  Interestingly enough, the meatballs had only been referenced on the menu as a pizza topping, and no other red meat dishes were anywhere to be found.  So, we were thrilled that they satisfied our cravings with a side order.  We used slices of the standard, yet flavorful, Italian bread to sop up the sauce and support the mozzarella.  When it came to the entrees, I selected the Chicken Carol, a massive plate that included two sautéed chicken breasts that were topped with roasted sundried tomatoes and capers in a garlic, white wine sauce.  The thin and tender cutlets were served with steamed mixed vegetables (carrots, zucchini, and squash) and red potatoes that had been roasted with shaved onion.  My friend's Shrimp Primavera was in a similar, but more lemon-infused, sauce and served over homemade linguine.  Both dishes were flavorful, traditional, and substantial for under $25 each.  Don't let the name fool you, Margherita's Pizzeria offered more than cheesy, saucy pies.  Their food, service, and prices were all terrific.  The homemade pasta and relaxed family vibe were perfect for a carefree evening.
2018-11-03,3,Used to be good, but has definitely taken a turn downward.I knew things were starting to trend downward when they stopped giving out the free bruschetta.They stopped giving out parm cheese in a shaker at the table, instead the waiter needs to come over to your table to provide shredded - not the same!The chicken parm - my go to - has been off as of late.  A sauce a little watery, and I feel like the portion size may have shrunk a little.  Price certainly has crept up.On my last visit they were out of Italian bread for the table!  In their defense, it was later in the night, but how can an Italian restaurant run out of Italian bread.Not sure if the restaurant has new owners or management, but definitely not a turn for the better for a former go to restaurant.
2018-10-29,2,Went here on October 28, 2018 and had a horrible experience.  Didn't get the typical bruschetta that they used to serve, and was instead informed that they charge for that now.  Didn't get any bread for the table and was told, without apology, that bread always runs out on Sundays. Guess what? -- ORDER MORE BREAD FOR SUNDAY!   Upon receiving the antipasti salad we ordered, I noted what used to be a ton of meat and roasted peppers was now basically 4 small pinwheels of meat on a mound of lettuce.  Disappointing for $15.It took an extremely long time to get our entrees, and when they came two of them were completely wrong. My wife ordered the salmon special ($25) which amounted to a filet of salmon cut up into pieces and placed on steamed vegetables.  What a crock.At the end of our horrible experience we were offered coffees on the house.  Being that it was 8pm at night on a Sunday, I passed, not wanting to caffeinate my inner rage.
2018-10-28,5,Excellent Quattro cheese w/ mushrooms and extra red sauce added.Mushrooms were thick and had a nice firm texture , almost a crunch - perfect Crust was perfectly cooked , thin,  not too thick w/ a nice char.  Got my NJ pizza fix all the way from Memphis.
2018-09-25,5,One of my fav Italian restaurants in Hoboken. I ordered the house special shell stuffed with chicken and it tasted great! This place never disappoints and all my friends love me for recommending this place!
2018-09-22,5,I don't post too often but I need to tell everyone about Margaritas .  First off it's not really a Pizzeria, but a charming Italian Restaurant .  So why am I posting about a Italian restaurant in Hoboken NJ when there are so many??   The FOOD  I have ordered the chicken scaloppine the last two time I have been there and I'ts amazing. My Daughter orders Chicken Marcella and believe me it's great.  Stop by and be delighted.
2018-09-06,5,My old sweetheart from Hoboken got me into this place, I must say "this place makes wonderful food", especially their signature item the Margherita pizza. Always delicious, friendly staff too & you will be a repeat customer after eating here once. Thanks for great food & great memories too.
2018-09-04,5,Where to start...I've been to Margheritas multiple times and have always been satisfied. Whether it's the calamari, rigatoni in vodka sauce, bbq chicken pizza, or cannolis, I always leave the restaurant full and with a smile on my face. Don't forget to bring your own wine because this spot is BYOB.
2018-08-27,5,I love this place!!!!!!!  My boyfriend lives right around the corner from this place and we are here almost every weekend. The place is small but it makes you feel much more cozy (: I have not one complaint.
2018-08-08,5,It's a small BYOB in Downtown Hoboken. Much easier to find parking than uptown and yet still worth driving around for 40 minutes to look for parking, LOL. It's one of my most favorite Italian restaurants and I've never left dissatisfied after a meal!
2018-08-03,3,It was just okay . Calamari was good , I didn't think a Cesar salad could be anything but amazing but there's was just okay . We got the buffalo chicken pizza with blue cheese and arugula ...it was so spicy I asked for some blue cheese on the side and they were out. Now that I look at the pizza there's no blue cheese on it all so basically it's just spiced chicken pizza . Like I said it was just okayAlso was super hot inside I had to ask to be seated outside as soon as there was space available . Very loud as well , if they opened the door they would get a nice evening breeze and all the voices wouldn't bounce off the walls . But maybe they can't since it's under a residential building , not sure
2018-07-15,5,This place was absolutely amazing! The pasta was fantastic, the pizza was great, and the wait staff was so attentive! I would 100% return here!
2018-07-05,3,Was in mood for pizza so visited this place with friends. A nice family run restaurant that is a good 20-30 min walk from the path station. It was almost full when we arrived around 7.30 pm. However the cooling does not work well. It was hot inside and we noticed a few other people using the menus as hand fans.This is one of the very few places that does not provide complimentary bread and still makes you wait 1 hour for the food. We ordered smoked mozzarella pizza and spinach cheese Ravioli. The food took forever to arrive, and then the server gave us a small pizza instead of large. We asked her how long will it to get a new one and she said 10 minutes. However, it took another 30 minutes to get the pizza. By that time we had waited over 90 minutes for our food and were not even hungry anymore. Like many reviews mention, order pasta over pizza. We found both the pizza and the Ravioli very average. The service is really slow. It took us another 30 minutes to get the check. So in all, go if you have plenty of time and are not super hungry!
2018-06-22,5,Not sure how this is only rated 3 1/2 stars because the food is outstanding and has been consistent each and every time. The entree dishes are fantastic the chicken parm and chicken Marsala are mouth watering and the penne ala vodka is as good as anything you will get in NYC. Kudos to the chef on a job well done.
2018-06-14,5,Very awesome place! Always go here when I'm in Hoboken! Big portions for lunch for a good price, dinner a little expensive, but they give a huge plate. Penne vodka sauce, chicken parm, bbq pizza, and buffalo pizza all amazing!!
2018-05-06,5,Margherita's is a wonderful, authentic Italian BYOB spot in town. It's a hole in the wall restaurant, so expect a small wait on the weekends, but the food is worth it!The ambiance makes you feel like you're in an Italian kitchen - very family-oriented, which is a nice change for Hoboken! They have an extensive menu, and the portions are HUGE. I could not finish more than a third of my penne vodka - I had leftovers for days! For great food, portions and BYOB, check out Margherita's!
2018-05-05,5,This place is a hidden gem their food is delicious prices are reasonable portions are large and service is great I absolutely love this place and recommend it
2018-04-29,5,I had Margheritas cater for a party of 60 and it was great! They brought everything we needed and arrived on time. My guests raved about the food and most had seconds (some thirds!) The favorites of the evening were penne vodka, chicken francese and meat lasagna.
2018-04-15,5,Margherita's hands down has some of the best Italian food in Hoboken (and that's saying a lot). Their pizza is great, but their pasta is what really makes them stand out. It's also BYOB, which is nice in Hoboken, and their ambiance really makes you feel like you're stepping into a family restaurant. Two things to keep in mind: this place does get packed for dinner, so be prepared to wait a bit, and their portions of pasta are really large.
2018-03-11,5,Nice italian place in Hoboken. Stumbled upon it and I'm glad we did. They give you bread at the beginning, but we also ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer, which were spot on. I got their spinach ravioli - definitely recommend. I would get it again. And their calzones are huge! The place is a little small, but it didn't get too crowded and the service is quick and friendly.
2018-03-09,3,Poor experience at Margherita's in Hoboken! I have been here before and enjoyed it but tonight was such a disappointment. The (most popular) Margherita pie was thick and heavy BUT the service was even worse. Sat down for dinner at 9pm and the entire meal was totally rushed! The staff continued to clear our table as we were still eating. They took our wine glasses away too as we were trying to enjoy a nice glass of wine over a conversation after dinner. Here's the icing on the cake- at 11pm they turned all of the lights on in the restaurant alluding that all of the customers should leave so they can finish up and go home. Very disappointing.
2018-03-07,4,I have been here off and on for the last 12 years, more when we lived opposite, it used to be a lot cheaper and less busy, the menu is typically American with a hint of Italian influences, it's kind of love it or hate it, the pizza is thicker than my wife prefers, I don't mind it, the calamari is good, they sandwiches at lunch are still a great deal, the pasta is not for us we are both chefs and can cook pasta at home !I will use it for lunch occasionally and it's a BYO so that's a big plus now that Hoboken has a $10 pint of Guinness at the Grand Vin
2018-03-02,4,My husband and I went to dinner last night at Margherita's Pizza.  To our surprise it was super crowded, but luckily we were able to get a table.  The food was so so good.  The mozzarella & arugula salad was so tasty! Also, since I'm gluten free they did have both gluten free pasta and pizza options available.  The pasta was delicious. Next time, will have to try the pizza.  Bonus points for being a BYOB place.
2018-02-25,2,Ordered penne vodka takeout. There was literally 30+ capers in the dish....who puts capers in vodka sauce?? Pasta was way over cooked too, like mush Not impressed
2018-02-25,3,We ordered take out on a Thursday night and the pizza arrived on time, about an hour after ordered. We got a small cheese pizza and mozzarella sticks and both were just okay. The mozzarella sticks were not warm and the cheese was not stringy at all (kind of like biting into a stick of breaded string cheese). They did include a giant marinara sauce size (which somehow was warmer than the food?) and some salad greens for garnish. The pizza was a bit warm and only okay. A little too flat and a little too saucy.
2018-02-01,5,Classic italian food, simply rendered but done well. Come for lunch and you will almost certainly leave with tomorrow's lunch as well. Affordably priced.
2018-02-01,1,Very disappointed with Margherita's. I've had good food from them in the past but the last two times I've ordered delivery there have been issues. On the first occasion my spaghetti and  meatballs were so over cooked it wasn't even edible. I called and they said I would get a refund and never saw it... I wanted to give them one more shot and they completely messed up my order last night and brought us (and charged us) for a pasta order we did not want. 3 pasta = $60!!! $20 for per pasta. Literally a rip off... it's not even that good. You can get way better italian food in Hoboken. I do not recommend this place.
2018-01-30,3,I've definitely had better pizza elsewhere in Hoboken. We ordered the Marchetto pizza (pepperoni, meatballs, sausage, peppers, onions, mushrooms, olives & eggplant). It was kind of soggy but I think it was because there were too many ingredients on it. We also ordered the seafood pasta in some type of white wine sauce. They give a good amount of seafood, which includes clams, mussels, shrimp, and squid.I'd come back to try some appetizers, and perhaps a simpler pizza.Tip - avoid the corner table by the window if you can - it's right and uncomfortable to dine at. Also, it's BYOB.
2018-01-11,5,I dined alone on a weekday afternoon. I enjoyed awesome NYC traditional Italian food. I started with the friend zucchini which was battered perfectly with a great side of marinara sauce. My main meal was the Penne Arrabiatta. It was perfect. The hot peppers were perfectly cooked with the right amount of heat. With the sweet onions and marinara sauce, it was one of my favorite Arrabiatta sauces, ever. I finished with an espresso and a Cannoli plate. It came with 4 Cannolis on top of fresh whipped cream. I look forward to bringing my wife here next time.
2017-11-27,5,Great pizza, and great Italian food.  Very reasonably priced with very large portions.  Casual dining area.
2017-09-22,5,I ordered the marchetto pizza, and it was delicious. The crust was thin but surprisingly sturdy enough to hold up the monster size pieces of meat. Sausage, pepperoni, onions, mushrooms were all delicious. The sauce was very tasty too. The service as great too. Very friendly, attentive, and boxed my leftovers for me.
2017-09-18,1,Below average the "homemade" pasta was over cooked and the sauce tasted like it came from a jar.
2017-09-17,4,Was intending to go to a different restaurant, but with an hour wait, we decided to walk to another spot. I had heard good things, so we stopped in for dinner with a bottle of our own wine. I had the veal piccata on special and my date had the red snapper. We had bruschetta for an appetizer, which was good but prepared differently to me. It as plain bread and then a pile of seasoned chopped up tomatoes, so you built your own piece. I'm a picky veal eater and asked the waiter if it was good and warned him I would send it back if it was tough. Well, he said it was fresh and good and he was right. The veal was as good as I have had in the NY metro area in the last 7 years I have lived here. My date also loved the red snapper, so overall good service, and very good food. I'm a fan and will return.
2017-09-06,2,We've had a condo in hoboken for 6 years and have eaten everywhere ... but never here.    (Primarily because they don't have a bar).  But it's always crowded and the reviews are excellent.  So I decided to try it finally.  My daughter and I just had dinner here and it was pretty good.  We wanted to have the clams oreganata as a starter but it wasn't available (although it was 6:30 and it wasn't crowded).   For her entree she had the mussels marinara which she enjoyed. And they didn't skimp on the mussels - there were more than she could eat.   I had the red snapper entree.   It was fairly tasty although the wilted spinach that it came with wasn't very good.  The service was excellent and the prices were about right.   Just not my type of restaurant.
2017-08-26,2,Been ordering from this place for a little while and it's gotten progressively worse.  Just ordered a "large" pizza and it was a lot smaller than it used to be.  Actually thought it was a small pizza they accidentally put in a large box.  Also they raised prices $3-$4 on a pie.  Less food and more money.
2017-08-26,1,Me and my husband ate there for a quick lunch, at first sight we were thrown off by their menu selection. We decided to still give the place a chance and ordered cavatelli e broccoli and Caesar salad. The Caesar was horrible, you can tell the dressing was old and the pasta was awful, was drowned and garlic. A bad imitation of Italian cuisine.
2017-08-12,5,When you live in Hoboken, there are a lot of Italian options. But you'll find that there are hot spots that each fulfill a particular need. Come to Margherita's if you are looking for a casual spot that feels like home with friendly staff and heart-warming homemade pasta (my favorite being the penne vodka with shrimp). It's a great spot for reliable classics and homemade pasta. It is BYO and they do not take reservations. I find there is always a long wait in the winter as the place is relatively small and groups often occupy the larger tables. But in the summer, the wait is relatively short because there are many tables outside.
2017-08-06,2,Pretty disappointed with the linguine and clams. I believe the clams were canned, and instead of linguine it was spaghetti. They were over cooked and the sauce was pretty mediocre.
2017-08-01,5,What a great cozy mom n pop original Italian place. I ran into the mail lady on the way in as I reviewed the menu and she was raving about their sauces. Although I did not eat any of the pastas with sauces, I did have the arugula salad with red peppers, mozzarella and salmon and I almost licked the plate. The only downside is that they did not serve wine but I later learned you can bring your own and they will cork it for you at no fee. Great place!
2017-07-29,5,Great Italian BYOB place in Hoboken. I have come to this restaurant twice in the last two weeks because the food is so great. Calamari and fresh mozz special for had was great along with my penne vodka! Would suggest ordering light sauce on all pasta dishes if you don't love the inundation of sauce.
2017-07-02,5,Best Italian food in Hoboken. Don't believe any of the haters.  The Chicken Parm and Chicken Arrabiata are my personal favorites.
2017-06-23,2,The food is great but every time I call for a delivery, the staff isn't the best. I have ordered a Caesar salad with grilled chicken like 10x from this place. Every time they make a big deal about adding the chicken. If chicken wasn't anywhere on their menu, I'd understand but it is. So either all your other chicken dishes are pre-made or frozen. Gross either way. When they finally agree, they charge me $18 and the delivery always takes more than an hour. No thanks, it's just a chicken Caesar salad, it's not rocket science. I'll take my business elsewhere.
2017-06-18,5,So there I was, walking down Washington street with my girlfriend and puppy by my side on a magical Friday night searching for a place to unwind and drink lots after a long week of work. We curiously stumbled upon this gem, Margherita's Pizzeria. We first noticed the outdoor seating arrangements and beautiful floral designs. With wine in hand we entered the restaurant. We sat outside. Drank. Ate. Talked to the owner (very sweet and played with our puppy). The food, excellent. The service, great. We ended up staying there for about 3hrs just enjoying the atmosphere. Would deff recommend. A must go. Perfect BYOB.
2017-06-17,5,We took my father in law here tonight for Father's Day. The food, the atmosphere, and the service was beyond excellent. I am gluten free and notoriously ordering and judging the gluten free pizzas in town. This place gives Grimaldi's a run for their money. It was the perfect size, great taste, and felt like I was eating a regular pizza. My father in law and husband both enjoyed their meals as well. I can't wait to return and try more of their gluten free options!
2017-06-17,1,Delivered pizza cold even though it was only 3 blocks away. Despite the delivery tips, refused to walk up the stairs to deliver the pizza.
2017-06-15,4,Every time a new restaurant opens in Hoboken, there is a very good chance that it is going to be serving Italian cuisine. Due to Hoboken's history, it is overloaded with Italian establishments, ranging from delis to somewhat fancy restaurants. While I do like Italian food quite a bit (and prior to discovering different cuisines it was my go-to), I have been reluctant to frequent too many of Hoboken's Italian restaurants. My boyfriend, on the other hand, is a big fan of Italian food and he's the one who brought me here several times.I have come here on a date with the bf, as well as with larger groups ranging from 4-10 people. What is consistently true is that if it's a weekend evening (not in the summer), there is going to be a wait. They have taken our number previously and called us when a table was available and we never had to wait for longer than half an hour. During off peak hours you might get a table right away.The service ranges depending on who you get but it is always at least decent, and the hostesses are nice. The restaurant itself is pretty causal, homey and somewhat inviting. It isn't very large but regardless of where I sat, I was pretty comfortable. The prices here are definitely reasonable considering the portions and quality.What I like about Italian restaurants is there are usually a good amount of meatless options, that is true of Margherita's as well. I most often order the Penne Arrabiatta (Fresh, homemade penne pasta, marinara sauce, hot cherry peppers, onions, basil, garlic & olive oil), which isn't actually spicy but I enjoy it nonetheless. I recently ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo which I have been eyeing for a while and found it to be even more delicious that my usual "safe" order. I have once ordered Mozzarella sticks due to an odd craving and they were just ok. The boyfriend usually sticks to their Penne Vodka (Fresh, homemade penne pasta in a light tomato cream sauce with capers, shallots & a hint of vodka, add chicken) or Chicken Parmiagana (Lightly breaded chicken breasts, topped with our fresh, homemade mozzarella, served with a side of linguine with marinara sauce) and he swears by both.While my not so secret wish is for Hoboken to diversify its food options a good amount, I would still like for Margherita's to stay because it is consistently good.
2017-06-03,4,I had the buffalo pizza and it was so delicious. It had generous amounts of cheese and chicken. The crust itself had a lot of flavor and was toasted just right. I also has the stuffed mushrooms which were kind of disappointing although the sauce they were in was good. I would go back with family. Not really a cool place to hang out with friends.
2017-05-31,5,Margherita's is our favorite BYOB place in Hoboken. The owner and waiter Omar are both knowledgeable and very friendly hosts, you feel like at home. Whether the mussels appetizer, baked clams, pizza are all excellent. The pasta is mostly home made and fresh. If you still have room left; get some ice cream or cannolis. And as it is a BYOB bring your favorite wine or get one from the store next door.
2017-05-25,4,I have been to Margherita's at least 4 times and every time i enjoyed the meal and the service was great! Please note this is a BYOB and on the weekends it can be very busy! I love Margherita's because everything is homemade and has a very comfortable feel inside. If the weather permits, try to sit outside and enjoy a bottle of wine. I am always skeptical of sitting outside because the service generally is lacking, but at this establishment that is not true. They will continuously check up on you and make sure you are ok. The food quality is good and the portion sizes are large. I would highly recommend Margherita's looking for good food with a warm and friendly environment. I would rate Margherita's as follows: Food is 4 Stars, Price is 3.5 Stars, Service is 5 Stars and Atmosphere is 4 Stars. The views expressed are of my own and are my true personal experience at this establishment. My personal experience may not reflect this actual establishment, their quality or someone else's experience at the establishment.
2017-05-23,5,My friend and I came for lunch and we ended up getting two different salads, but we each ordered Cajun chicken on top. Each salad was amazing, as was the chicken, the portion of which was enormous. And each dish was just $7.95!!! Say what??? I took home half and had another lunch from it! Great service, great food. We both agreed we'll be back.
2017-05-15,5,Wonderful service and great food. Omar the waiter was just awesome! The food was delicious and everything came out beyond our liking. I usually don't often write Yelp reviews but I was very satisfied. Will definitely come back!
2017-05-01,4,Family run, old school kinda vibe that feels cozy and laidback in the comforting way that we were craving for a late Sunday lunch. Straightforward menu with not too many frills - the bread is out of this world (each basket we were brought was hot and seemingly fresh out of the oven) and the penne with arrabbiata hit the spot perfectly.Will definitely return to try pizza next time we're in Hoboken.
2017-04-22,4,Came here on a Friday night around 8:30pm and waited over an hour to be seated, which is why I'm giving only four stars. We sat across the street at the bar to escape the cold and it was fine. Other than that the food was AMAZING. I had the chicken florentine and shared the cannoli (came with two) between three of us for dessert. I would totally go back but maybe durning the week or earlier for less of a wait.
2017-03-26,4,Chicken parm was uhhmazing. Their homemade mozzarella was the best mozzarella I've ever had, they kept refilling our bread and butter basket-always a plus, the service was quick friendly and attentive. Cute atmosphere. Free bread basket and bruschetta. Tiramisu was decent.
2017-03-03,2,I will never order delivery from this restaurant again.  We placed order at 7:30pm, but after one and half hours and 2 phone calls with the restaurant, we still didn't receive anything.  We were told that the pizza left the restaurant at 8:30pm, but even though we live just 4 blocks away, we haven't been able to receive it yet.  This is unacceptable.  So save your time and order your pizza from somewhere else.
2017-02-25,4,Went last eve with a couple of friends. Service was impeccable. We were first seated outside because the weather was so nice, but we requested to get a table inside and work promptly given one as soon as it was available.I ordered the lobster ravioli and the lobster ravioli and sauce was perfect. I highly recommend this place for an intimate quiet dinner with friends.
2017-02-11,2,Have eaten here a few times. Food is above average family style Italian. Last time I went I was told 20-30 min for a party if 3.  Over the course of an hour and 10 minutes multiple parties of 4-5 were seated ahead of us despite arriving later.  Eventually I took our names off the list and I will not be going back any time soon.
2017-02-01,5,I've been selfishly putting off writing a review for Margarita's because I consider it my favorite restaurant in ALL of Hoboken and I don't want to have to wait longer for a table here. It is an old school family owned Italian BYOB restaurant.  Servers are always friendly and accommodating and make you feel welcome. They provide complementary bruschetta once your sit down. They have a daily list of specials (I always look out for the rigatoni bolognese because it's THAT good).They have all of your standard Italian fare (apps, pastas, meat dishes and desserts).My go to appetizers are the fried calamari and Caesar salad. It's even better when you put the calamari on the salad!For dinner, try the chicken parmigiana and ask for them to substitute their vodka sauce for the marinara over the dish. It will blow your mind!
2017-01-20,5,Whenever my girlfriend and I want a nice, delicious dinner we always go to Margherita's. The place is small and cozy, and as Italians we feel right at home with the decor and setting of the restaurant. All of the dishes they serve are absolutely massive and can easily be shared for two, though we always each order our own dish and bring half home. The service is quick, the food is fresh. The chicken florentine is incredible! You must try it.
2016-12-11,5,Came here for the first time. .awsome food ..great service... definitely come and request  Johanna the waitress super nice sweet and attentive.. #happy first time customer
2016-12-05,3,For god's sake, when will Yelp add the half star option? Margherita's deserves a 3.5. I've been wanting to come here for like 3 years, pretty much ever since I moved to Hoboken. Last night was THE night and I was pumped. I left feeling a bit underwhelmed. The restaurant itself is cute and quaint but small and cramped when it's busy. We were seated against the wall; I was in the wall bench and my boyfriend was in the chair. We had plenty of space to start but as the restaurant started to fill up it wasn't very comfortable. By the end of the meal, my puffy winter jacket was on my lap and the waitresses had bumped into my boyfriend several times because there wasn't any space for them to walk through the aisle. We ordered a mixed greens salad to start; I got the penne vodka with chicken and he got a personal buffalo chicken pizza. As far as buffalo chicken pizzas go, this one leaves a lot to be desired. You're better off with Napoli's. The penne vodka, however, was delicious and the portion size was - *Trump voice* - UUUUGE! I ate until I was stuffed and then still had enough for lunch the next day. Margherita's is one of the few Italian places in Hoboken that does homemade pasta and it did not disappoint. It was fresh, perfectly cooked and didn't get grossly soggy by the next day like others usually do. Conclusion: come here for the pasta, not the pizza, and come early if you'd like to actually relax
2016-12-02,5,5 STARS!! I have not had a meal here I did not like!! Mainly the margarita pizza with water!!! I love it!! However I've stopped in for some need to be changed (aka NJ move to CA)
2016-10-08,5,Great atmosphere, terrific menu. My girl had the special: lobster with scallop and crab on a bed of fresh pasta. I had the special stuffed shells on top of this being a BYOB it was great. Visiting friends in town while away from Tampa Florida. We will be back for sure!
2016-10-07,4,Tried this place for the first time this weekend after hearing all about it and overall we enjoyed it!  The food was great, but boy was it crowded. At times it got loud, but that's a good sign I guess. Everyone in my party enjoyed their entrees and the complementary Bruschetta. The portions are huge so come hungry and be prepared to take some home. BYOB is a huge plus and entrees are very cheap for the area. My only complaint was the cannoli was very average and the space is tight. But you can't beat the food and price in Hoboken.
2016-08-26,5,Such a great little Italian spot in Hoboken.  Been in the area for about 6 months now and never came here until last night.  I was really missing out.  From the delicious, complimentary bruschetta to the perfect chicken parm, this place had it all!  Also, the service was top notch as everyone was quick and friendly.  I cannot wait to come back!
2016-08-23,5,Honestly I don't give out 5 star ratings "easily," but this one was easy to give. We stopped in at about 10 on a Friday night and it was moderately busy. We were quickly greeted and brought bruschetta, and our drinks while my husband ran next door for some wine (yes, it's BYOB!)The kids DEVOURED the mozzerella sticks that came out first, hot and fresh and my husband made a FOOL over his manacotti, which --stuffed from the large portion he insisted on finishing.  The pizza was AMAZING, and the kids loved folding their big slices and loved both the pepperoni and cheese both.We just ADORED this little gem in the city and will be back for sure. They are doing LOTS of things right :)
2016-08-22,4,Neighborhood Italian restaurant with reasonably priced pasta dishes and large portions. Complimentary bruschetta to start was a nice touch. I loved my linguine with clams (though they weren't in the shell, boo) and my date almost polished off his chicken parm, which was extremely impressive given the sheer quantity of food. Amaretto tiramisu was the perfect bite to end the meal.BYOB, but there's apparently a wine store a few blocks away.Definitely merits a repeat visit :)
2016-08-20,4,Been here twice now, once for lunch and once for dinner and I can already tell I'm going to be here all the time. The pasta is seriously delish. And it reheats well too which is good because the portion of vodka penne I got was freakin' huge. The bruschetta that came with dinner was a nice touch. My lunch salad was delicious too. The service is very attentive. I went for dinner on a Thursday night around 7 and had no problem with seating. I love Hoboken food!
2016-08-06,1,Just tried ordering a Grilled chicken Caesar wrap and apparently you can't order a wrap for dinner. Wtf is that? First pizza place that's ever told me that. I will be taking my money elsewhere from now on.
2016-08-04,4,The place is awesome for outdoor dining. Super cute and the Bruschetta appetizer is great. The penne vodka was also really good!  The cheese pizza was good but nothing special.
2016-07-27,1,This place is horrible!!!! Food took a turn for the worse- she obviously isn't using her ex husband mozz from Vito's- save your dollar and your time. Benny serves better pizza. Update and clean up is well needed!!! #newcooksneeded.  #updateyourstaff #renovate!!!!
2016-07-25,5,Cozy spot. We stumbled upon it at lunch time. Staff was friendly and prices can't be beat for the huge portion sizes. Had pasta which were very tasty but pizza and salads looked great too
2016-07-15,4,Cute Italian restaurant in mi-town Hoboken! Didn't love the pizza, but the entrees were fantastic and quite large.
2016-07-11,4,Quality. Friendly servers. The bruschetta is one of my favorite small items of theirs.. Too good!Everything else was tasty, chicken parm to chicken sorrentino ... To the calamari and chicken cesar salad. All goodVery cozy, family vibe... The only thing I would speak against is their menu seems a little too concise.Otherwise, worth a return.
2016-06-27,5,Amazing pizza! Made fresh, to order and you get complimentary Bruschetta. We ordered the chicken penne vodka and it was delicious. The staff was very nice and I also enjoyed the nice outside seeking on a summer night. I definitely recommend this place!
2016-06-18,5,Great food, good prices. Just a heads up... It's byob but there's a tavern across the street that sells beer and wine to go.
2016-06-12,4,Went here this past weekend.  The mozzarella appetizer was delicious!  We had penne arrabiata and rigatoni and they were good.  I was going to give it three stars  as the pasta was good, not outstanding but service is excellent which is why I upped it to a 4.
2016-05-15,2,nothing about this place is real italian. After reading the reviews about homemade pasta and amazing pizza, i decided to bring my friend here for her birthday. The reviews raved about the pizza and how you need reservations to get into this place. Well, we came here on a tuesday night and the place was empty. I should have taken that as a hint. We ordered a pizza, salad, mozzarella sticks and penne ala vodka. The only thing that tasted good and decent was the penne ala vodka. The sauce was great. The pizza was rubbery and not good at all. Just a typical pizza you can get at any pizzeria. The mozzarella sticks were the prefrozen kind you make at home. Ive never had worst mozzarella sticks. Thats how you can tell this place isnt really italian. The salad was gross. They charged me an extra $1 to get olives on my salad. Which i wouldnt mind if they were kalamata olives. They gave me the HUGE black olives that come out of a can. ANother indicator that this is not a real italian restaurant.The dressing on the salad was horrible. The worst balsamic vinigrette ive ever had in my life. My salad also had slivers of zuccini in it. Who the fuck puts zuccini in a salad. Our waiter Samuel was amazing. Very helpful and always checking in on us if we needed anything. Very eager to do his job and to do it right. I wont be back here though. Average american food trying to pull itself off as this amazing little italian place that makes homemade pastas and pizzas.
2016-05-11,5,I had a really great evening here with 5 of my coworkers on a Friday evening. I was worried that we couldn't make a reservation but we got there at a good time and were seated right away. We ordered lots of apps: stuffed mushrooms, calamari, mozzarella sticks, baked clams and all were delicious and perfect for sharing. Then we each got our own meals and not one complaint was heard! Best of all this is byob. You can come here to enjoy delicious food, good service, and hopefully as good of company that I had.
2016-04-20,5,One of my favorite restaurants to eat at in Hoboken. Old school Italian feel with excellent food, I had the chicken parm which was amazing and my wife had the penne vodka and hands down the best Italian food we've had so far in Hoboken. Will definitely be returning.
2016-04-16,5,This place is amazing!! The atmosphere is cute and nice and the food is the best Italian I've ever had! We got the fettuccini Alfredo, sundried pesto, and the spinach ravioli and they were all amazing! If you're in Jersey definitely give it a try!!
2016-04-15,4,Definitely a great place for pasta, however the pizza is just ok in my opinion. If you notice a lot of the worse reviews complain about the pizza, unfortunately people think that is what to order since it is in the name. Skip the pizza and order the homemade pasta, you wont regret it. I have tried their tomato buffalo sauce stuffed chicken shells which was one of their specials, and the Chicken Parmigiana Sandwich for lunch. Both were great. The place is BYOB and can get crowded early in the evening. It has a cozy vibe.
2016-04-05,4,I love this old school place! I only have been here for lunch because due to it's popularity it's always packed in the evenings. That being said it's my go to place for comfort food chicken parm which is always great.
2016-03-28,5,This place is a must-visit in Hoboken! Both food and service are ON POINT. We had a large birthday party here last weekend and they were SO accommodating. They did everything they could to fit a large group at last minute's notice and never gave any attitude. The waitresses were attentive and incredibly friendly. Everyone's food came out piping hot at the same time - major props to the kitchen for managing that! - and everyone thought their entrees were delicious. Overall, we had a great time. BYOB is a huge plus as well. Margherita's is highly recommended for any occasion. We will definitely be back!
2016-02-26,5,My wife and I come here every so often and each time we have a fantastic meal. The meal starts with a really fresh and tasty bruschetta. The place always smells great, even when you're walking by. The pasta is homemade and fresh and we've never been disappointed by out selections. Most recently I've had the Calamari with Linguine in a wine sauce, the Chicken Paramgiana and the Lobster Ravioli. All great portions, you won't go home hungry, and the sauces are all incredible. Luckily they give you bread to soak it all up with. It's friendly, tasty and an excellent Italian eatery. We always bring friends and families here as well.
2016-02-22,5,Best Italian restaurant in the town!!! Quality sauce with every dish. Unfortunately seating is very difficult especially on a busy weekend night. I remember the first time I went here and got the house salad with the house dressing and it was the best salad I have ever had. I remember thinking to myself "if the salad is this good I can't imagine how good the pasta is". I never had enough room for the dessert but I can imagine it is just as delicious. If your Italian and you haven't visited this place your missing out.
2016-02-15,4,This is our go-to for Italian take out in Hoboken. Large menu with many options for all types of eaters, and prices are very reasonable for the generous portions!  We've ordered many different pastas as well as their pizza, and have never had a bad meal. Dining in at Margherita's is also a great experience. Their staff is very friendly with a great atmosphere, and they're BYOB. Their complementary bruschetta is also amazing!
2015-11-15,5,Every time I come here it gets better. I want to eat myself to death because I can't tell the difference between heaven and reality. Best Italian in my life! Thank you!!! (Great food and ambiance, I recommend to anyone with a pulse.)
2015-11-06,1,Chicken was overcooked and unevenly cooked with a very weird texture, not defrosted properly was my wife's guess. Linguine was clumped and stuck together. Meatballs dry and tasteless. Sizable portions but not helpful if you don't like it. The only thing authentic were the photos on the walls of possibly the family that started the business. We did not try the pizza.
2015-10-28,3,What a disappointment. The relatives took me here for some delicious dinner. They had been here before and had a fantastic experience. Ours was a bit different. Of the 4 of us, only one person actually liked their meal. Now, don't get me wrong, service wasn't terrible and the food was absolutely edible, it was just... bland. Bland at an Italian restaurant is like, really bad. Maybe instead of ordering entrees (I had the chicken and asparagus in wine sauce special) we should have ordered the pizza (which looked amazing).Liked the BYOB!
2015-10-27,3,The environment was nice and romantic. I went with my boyfriend and we were able to have a nice quiet conversation instead of the usual "talking loudly so I can hear you" at other restaurants. The food was decent italian food but nothing that impressed me.  Cute, romantic and pleasantly quiet restaurant.
2015-10-24,4,Delicious homemade pizzas and pastas for a relatively good price. The gluten-free pizza (especially the crust) is quite delicious. I live close enough to walk here, but delivery is free to anywhere in Hoboken during dinner hours. Nice people running the show, too.
2015-10-09,3,BYOB family owned Italian restaurant with plenty of homemade pasta!They start the table off with bruschetta and warm bread. Bruschetta is top notch. Here's what we ordered:- garlic bread: heard this was good, but our batch didn't have much garlic? - calamari: ok. Big portion. Very lightly breaded and fried- penne vodka: OMG Amazing. As in, the best I have ever had! Very rich and accentuated with capers. Portion was also large. Get this!- gnocchi special: sausage, broccoli rabe, and homemade gnocchi in...a soup? of white wine and garlic. This dish confused me. I did not expect the dish to come out in a deep dish to hold the soup and was underwhelmed by the gnocchi. Sausage and broccoli rabe were better though. Skip this one and go for the penne vodka!The tiramisu is made by Margherita's mother and is supposed to be amazing (next time). Fun fact: Mikie Squared is owned by Margherita's brother. Head over there for a drink afterwards!
2015-10-03,5,"I heard good things about Margaretas" So we went and were extremely pleased. Cozy, warm atmosphere, excellent Italian food and pleasant service.
2015-09-22,3,Came to Margherita on a Sunday night. Parking as always is a pain in this area - even with a Hoboken permit. Anyway - the restaurant is a good average size and BYO. The staff is friendly and there was a good mix of people inside - including some Stevens college kids. We ordered a small sausage and hot pepper pizza to share. It's pretty basic pizza - a thicker cheesier crust. The cheese was loaded on it and pretty tasty however I can't say there was anything that stood out about the pizza. The pastas looked good - and huge and we didn't have desert. Not sure I will be back but that's more out of convenience and location then the food. That said for two people we spent 20 dollars and got bruschetta (on the house) and hot bread for no extra cost.
2015-09-18,4,Started going here a few months ago and love this place.  Nice and cozy atmosphere inside, love the old family pictures and outdoor seating as well.  The food has been very good, have not had anything we disliked.  We have tried the ravioli, the rigatoni w/meat sauce & ricotta, the veal parm, the eggplant parm, penne vodka, penne arrabbiata, the fried calamari (DELICIOUS!!) the mozzerella salad (mutz is amazzzingggg!!).  The Italian bread they serve is delicious.  Our first visit they placed a dish of bruschetta on the table & it was delicious.  The only negative I would say is they bring out your main dish too quick.  This is a BYOB, with a liquor store on the corner or a bar right across the street to purchase.  Servers are very nice & attentive.  Busboys are helpful and nice too.  Prices are very reasonable.
2015-09-17,4,Went on a Tuesday night, there was only one other couple dining inside, and several groups outside, so we were seated immediately. The bruschetta and warm bread brought out immediately were good-nothing amazing, but a nice touch-especially because I was so hungry. My partner ordered the special of BBQ Chicken pizza and loved it (and considering he is from Memphis-the home of BBQ-that is saying a lot!) and I had the Chicken Parmesan which was delicious as well. I was a little put off at the prices when we first sat down, but the large portions more than make up for it (I got 3 meals out of my 18.95 Chicken Parm). Our waiter was charming and friendly. As others have mentioned, they are BYOB. Will definitely be back.
2015-09-15,4,This place has some of the best fried calamari Iv had in a while! I will go back just for that! I got the spinach ravioli the first time I went and also enjoyed it very much. The second time I went I got a personal pizza and wasn't thrilled about it. I prefer my crust to be crunchy and theirs was very floppy. I will 100% go back for the calamari and pasta!
2015-08-18,1,We brought out of town guests here on Sunday night at 8:40pm. As we walked up, we saw the hostess seat a table of four. My husband asked for a table and the girl said they stopped seating at 8:45. When he asked why they just sat another table, she said "I'm sorry." Hours say they close at 9pm on Sunday. Seemed lazy and the worker just wanted to go home. Maybe I wouldn't be as annoyed if they didn't seat a table as we walked up. We won't be going back anytime soon.
2015-07-30,4,Popped in for a quick lunch on a hot day and was greeted by friendly staff members.  They quickly brought waters and waited on us.  I shared the rigatoni with meat sauce with my son and it was delicious. Hubby had fettuccini Alfredo and it was pretty tasteless. Garlic bread was amazing though. Would go back for the rigatoni for sure.
2015-07-22,1,OK, I get that sole is a fish that is both expensive and popular.  As a restaurant owner who wants to offer sole, you have a number of different options.  You could offer a large portion and charge a high price.  You could offer a smaller portion at a more reasonable price.  You could just decide not to sell it.Or, if you run Margherita's, you could offer a large portion at a reasonable price but then deliver what is very obviously tilapia to your customers.As Chris Rock says, "Yeah, you could do it, but that don't mean it's to be done".
2015-07-18,4,I have been here quite a few times and love this BYOB pizzeria, food here are solid, we never had a bad meal, service has always been friendly and fast. They got outdoor seating in the summer and is dog friendly (like most of the places in Hoboken).I have tried many different dishes including pizzas, pastas and seafood dishes. It's all great. Haven't had anything that is not good! Price is also very reasonable, there is a wine shop just 2 blocks away, so it's not difficult to get drinks at all.
2015-07-17,3,I should have known that something was up because we had no wait & the restaurant was empty the whole time.  When I lived in Hoboken over 15 years ago, the restaurant was always packed with lengthy waits.  The food is decent, but no longer spectacular.  My husband and I shared the fried calamari & had penne with vodka sauce.  The recipes have changed.  My husband and I have dedicated most of our life together trying to recreate the amazing vodka sauce they used to serve.  Now their sauce is no better than an average supermarket brand.  What happened???
2015-07-16,4,Go to delicious Italian. At least a once a week experience for our family.  Friendly staff and wonderful specials. One request... Please add your delicious chicken Francese to the regular menu!Did I mention it was BYOB?!!
2015-07-13,5,Came in with my boyfriend and had the Seafood Margherita for 2 and it was BOMB. We both like seafood and were craving pasta so we picked the white wine garlic sauce. You get a ton of seafood and so much linguine (perfectly cooked), we had lots of leftovers. Service was speedy and friendly, BYOB is always a plus, and the free bruschetta to start is delish.
2015-07-11,4,Great pizza, good other entrees - always a yummy meal.  The staff is friendly and the service is pretty quick.
2015-06-20,3,I think it just depends on your preference when it comes to food. I think Johnny Pepperoni's food is better but the service at Marg's was better - both BYOB so I can't argue with that.  I do have to say there is no real comparison on the pizza (Marg's is too doughy with the minimum amount of ingredients to call it an actual pizza). But the chicken parm was actually very good here. Outside seating is nice and the free bruschetta is pretty sweet.
2015-06-14,4,Penne arrabiata is wonderful! Large portions and the sauce was spicy and delicious. Will definitely be back!
2015-06-10,4,Came here for lunch with two friends and was so happy we chose this place! We all got different pastas- shrimp Alfredo, chicken parm, penne vodka. My shrimp Alfredo was a bit too milky for my liking but still great. I tried my friends penne vodka and I loved it. I recommend getting that!!
2015-06-07,5,Great food, and awesome service! Their pizzas are so yummy. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. The atmosphere is relaxed. Would absolutely recommend.  Added bonus- they stay open a little later than most other boybs in hoboken!
2015-06-01,5,Cute and quaint place to have a casual dinner with friends and family. Great variety of Italian dishes and pizzas. My favorite is the salmon caesar salad and the personal pizzas
2015-05-26,4,All the good I mentioned previously.  This is a staple for my fiance and I and they deserve another star!
2015-04-23,3,I came here for a girls night once and ordered pasta with pesto sauce.  It was okay, definitely not my favorite. Would try something else if I go back.We also ordered pizza from here once and they totally messed up the order. With so many options in town, I won't be ordering delivery pizza from here again.
2015-04-18,5,I ordered the Penne Arrabiatta with their homemade gluten-free pasta and it was honestly the BEST gluten-free pasta I have eaten yet! It was so good, I had to ask the server to confirm that it was gluten-free pasta. The texture and flavor was like regular pasta; it was amazing! The sauce was good too.  I have been trying various types of gluten-free pasta for several years now and it usually gritty, a bit tough, a different color or has a strange smell to it; this was truly indiscernable from the real deal. It costs a few dollars more, but it's SO worth it!
2015-03-31,4,I really, really like this place. I've been going to Margherita's since ~ 2009 when I was dating a guy who lived uptown. It was our go-to date night spot since the prices are reasonable, the food is great and BYOB is awesome! Since then, I've gone back with girlfriends a few times and almost every year for my birthday with my family (we cheated one year with O'Nieals when I started eating meat again.)The bruschetta is out of this world delicious AND complimentary (score!) My go-to order is Julia's pizza which is inanely delicious with fresh veggies and pesto (and available with whole wheat crust if you're pretending to be "healthy," while still eating pizza.) I've also tried some of the pasta dishes and highly recommend anything with Vodka sauce. My dad has ordered (and I've tried) both the Chicken and Shrimp Francese (his fave) and that was awesome as well! The portions are generous and everything is super fresh.As others have mentioned, they don't take reservations and there is usually a wait. But there is a great dive bar next door and they're happy to take your number and call your cellphone when your table is available. The last time I was there (for my birthday last year) a table wound up opening up almost immediately despite expecting a 30+ minute wait and they were kind enough to hold the table while we finished the drinks we;d ordered at the bar.I'm surprised about many of the 1 and 2 star reviews. It seems like a lot of them are for delivery, but I've personally never had a problem. I've ordered pizzas (the large cheese pizza from here is so good and such a good deal at $14!) and pasta dishes on numerous occasions and they arrive freshly prepared, hot, fairly to largely portioned and always within an hour. I wouldn't recommend ordering the bruschetta for delivery, however, because it's just not as good as the complimentary stuff at the restaurant :).
2015-03-22,5,Awesome family friendly pizza and food.  Spent an afternoon waiting in line with the family at a local bakery and boy was this place a great break!
2015-03-03,2,I have passed Margaritas Pizzeria by numerous evenings and witnessed a packed house almost every single time. I guess what I never noticed was that no one was eating pizza...Being in the mood for pizza tonight my fiancee and I decided to try out Margaritas. It was quiet evening as was snowing so service was swift and on point from the moment we walked in. The appetizers of mussels fra diavlo and Ceaser dressing were really good and we were just getting started. The bruschetta for the table to start was also a welcome and tasty surprise. The pizza. Oh the pizza. So bad for so many reasons I had trouble explaining to my server why it was so bad. To start you would expect a place with Pizzeria in the name would make a half decent pie. Not the case. After the first bite I couldn't help but look around and  notice we were the only ones eating pizza in a pizzeria.   We had Margaritas Pizza, (not to be cofused with a margarita style pizza), which is fresh tomato, mozzarella and prosciutto with no sauce. The pizza was a dry flavorless piece of cardboard that made me wish for one of those pizzas I used to get for lunch in public school. Cheese...dry and burned to crisp. Prosciutto...maybe it was maybe it wasn't. It was so overcooked it was unrecognizable. I may bring myself to return to Margaritas Pizzeria one day bit it won't be for the pizza. I suggest some re-branding for this establishment. Don't make pizza if your hearts not in it. Your patrons can tell when you don't care.
2015-02-12,5,Nice cozy restaurant.  Perfect for a date but sometimes hard to get a table since the place is small.Food is delicious, we ordered the chicken parm dinner and the rigatoni with pesto and chicken.  The rigatoni pesto was awesome and really stood out.  Never had a bad meal here.  I would recommend this if you are in the mood for Italian.
2015-01-30,2,This place is called a pizzeria. Therefore the pizza should be their selling point as a taqueria should make good tacos. I ordered their pizza once and it was chewy and very stale tasting, over baked and greasy. I froze it and considered just tossing the pie as it was not very good so why eat all those calories with little flavor or freshness. I have heard their pastas are their selling point. Would try their pastas however will not be ordering their pizza again. Perhaps better food and freshness in house?
2015-01-30,3,good pizza.
2015-01-25,4,Adorable, romantic BYOB place that's pretty much a staple in Hoboken. I had been many times when I lived in Hoboken, but stopped coming once I moved. Anyway, a friend of mine suggested we check it out one Saturday night as we were all in the mood for some heavy Italian food on a freezing cold night. We arrived around 7:30pm and I was surprised to see there were actually tables available (the place is almost always packed). We were told a 30 minute wait so we gave our cell phone number and walked out. Upon walking out, they called us and said a table was ready. Awesome! Upon immediately sitting we were given tasty toasted bread with homemade bruschetta dusted with olive oil and freshly baked bread. I asked for a side of olive oil, which was excellent. They have a ton of nightly specials which all looked delicious, so we proceeded to order food like we were going to the electric chair. We started with the mozzarella salad (a staple on the menu). Three huge pieces of fresh mozzarella which were super creamy and out of this world on top of arugula salad with a thick balsamic dressing. Delicious. Then we ordered two appetizer specials: jalapeno poppers and clams stuffed with crab meat with some cheese on top. The jalapeno poppers were tasty, breaded and fried, very cheese and served with marinara sauce and the clams (I believe there were 5) had fresh crab meat in them and were excellent. For dinner I went with the lobster ravioli, which came in a creamy pesto sauce. Interesting pairing for the lobster ravioli, I liked it. The ravioli was very tasty, huge pieces of lobster, yum. Overall service was very good. Our food came out fairly quickly and the place is so small that you never have an issue locating your server if you need anything. Because the place is so crowded, it tends to be a bit loud, but overall I like this place, very relaxed atmosphere and the food is always delicious!
2015-01-19,2,I ordered the cheese pizza and was disappointed. I was expecting a classic Italian pizza at best or a New Yorker pizza at worst. What I got was just like a normal  pizza like you can get at any pizza chain with medium thickness crust. It was just regular pizza, nothing Italian or Jersey-like about it. I could've ordered Domino's. Next time I will be sure and try something different on the menu because I feel like they may have more potential than the dish that I chose.
2015-01-12,4,Quality, homey, Italian food.  Great portion sizes and prices.  Excellent service.  The marinara sauce is amazing - shared an appetizer of mussels, dinners of chicken parm and eggplant ravioli, and cannolis for dessert.  Everything was delicious - and LOVE the BYOB!  Restaurant space was a bit tight, so wouldn't plan to go there with more than 2 or 4 in a party.
2015-01-06,5,Walked in New Years Eve and had a great meal.  Service was great for a busy night and food was top notch.  My first time ever eating in the restaurant, have always gotten take out.  They had Veal Piccata as a special and I asked them to make parmigiana instead.  They were accommodating and the portions were huge.  Will be back soon!
2014-12-29,5,Went here for lunch and it was great. Cheap prices, tasty homemade food, attentive service. Will definitely be back. Only problem was the massive food coma I had afterwards -- oooof!
2014-12-21,4,Went here for dinner on a random week night with a friend. We were immediately seated. We didn't realize it was BYOB until we arrived, so my friend ran down the block to a small shop to grab a bottle of wine. I got the special which was delicious. I don't recall specifics, but believe it was some sort of pear and cheese tortellini. Good service, good food. Overall, would go back again for a quiet, casual dinner.
2014-12-16,3,Ordered a pie to be delivered from here, half plain & half four cheeses. The medium pie was rather large, however given all the pizza places in Hoboken I felt as though this pie was pretty bland. I had a slice of the four cheeses re-heated the next day and there was virtually no flavor! Not the best, but not the worst!As the place itself has such a cute ambiance, I will be going again to dine-in and give other dishes a try!
2014-12-09,4,A fine pizza place with decent prices, quick service and yummy food. While the pizza tows the line between artisan and a traditional Jersey grease pie, it will still hit the spot in a cinch. I was particularly impressed with their pesto sauce.
2014-11-27,4,Excellent food and very generous portions at prices that are more than reasonable!  You will not leave hungry.The space is a little tight inside and they do not take reservations.  You have to go in, drop your name with the hostess, grab a buzzer and go next door to 8th Street Tavern to have a drink at the bar while you wait.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone for some great Italian food!
2014-11-26,1,Hah! I don't know how this place has such a high rating. A school cafeteria could make better food than this place. My boyfriend and I split a pizza and pasta dish- both dishes tasted like NOTHING. They tasted very bland. There was no taste to these dishes at all. They used super cheapo marinara sauce and dumped it on packaged pasta and called it a day. Same goes for the pizza. This place was a disappointment and a waste of money.
2014-11-12,4,We've ordered from Margherita's a couple of times and it's been a hit or a miss. The Pesto Rigatoni has been consistently good and the Alfredo pasta not so great. Last week we decided to stop by on a Sunday evening for dinner and the place was packed. Margehrita's resembles a cozy old school joint with a bustling staff and vibe and it won our hearts the moment we entered. Heads up - they give you complimentary bruschetta and hot bread and butter within 10 minutes of sitting down. We didn't know this and also ordered an app and then couldn't finish our main meal.We got the mussels in garlic sauce, the rigatoni pesto and the seafood special with linguine pasta. The mussels were our least favorite part of the meal - a little chewy and didn't taste fresh. Had trouble finishing it.Both the pasta dishes were really good and the portions were large. Between the three people it was more than enough.The sea food special had two types of white fish, scallops and the delish pasta on the side - this was really the highlight of the meal and the husband loved every bit of it.Definitely give Margherita's a shot if you like home style comfort cooking.(Byob)
2014-10-26,5,First off, this place has excellent service. They have bountiful staff on hand to assist in a very timely manner. Secondly, the food is awesome. Great tasting, and the portions we're good. Lastly, we we're pleasantly surprised when we received the bill... Such a great price for everything we got! Will definitely be going back!
2014-10-21,5,I recently ate this spot by accident, but was pleasantly surprised. While we were bummed they were out of the baked clams on a busy Friday night, we ordered the muscles in a garlic white wine sauce which was delicious. The staff was generous with the multiple orders of bread we requested to soak up the broth and the food portion for the chicken parmesan was generous and delicious! Our glasses were always filled and empty plates were taken away at the perfect moments. Attentive, pleasant wait staff, warm delicious comfort food and BYOB to top it all off! Opt for a nice bottle of Chianti from the liquor store down the block, sit outside if the weather is mild and enjoy the view and meal. Romantic, and good for groups.
2014-10-14,3,Another great BYOB Italian joint of Hoboken! Their pizzas are really their best menu item; they have several choices and you can even get whole wheat dough :) As for their pasta, it is OK but not as good as the other italian restaurants in Hoboken. If you're looking for some pizza and your own bottle of wine, I'd go here, but for a nice pasta dinner, I'd suggest one of the other restaurants.
2014-09-16,4,NIce little place to get homemade pasta. Prices are reasonable, and food is consistent and very good. My favorites include the chicken marsala (with a substitute of a side of fresh pasta, of course!) and linguine with white clam sauce. BYOB.
2014-09-12,5,I can't believe this place doesn't have 4+ stars. I'm blown away, and as a frequent customer, I'm disappointed, but less of a wait for me.This is just one of those places that you have to go to once a month because it's THAT good. Why you ask?1) Everything here is homemade, from the pastas to the pizzas. 2) Free bruschetta for the table3) B.Y.O4) Cheap!5) Homey/Cozy feelIt gets crowded here, and they don't take reservations which is annoying, but they have fast service so table turnover is fairly quick. However, you definitely can just sit there and drink as many bottles of wine that you brought and they won't kick you out. The place is small, but they squeeze people in and it's tight. They can seat anywhere from 30-40 people inside is my guess and when the weather is nice they have outdoor seating. The specials change weekly, which is great, but some of the best dishes are on the permanent menu. The penne a la vodka is unreal, as is the seafood pasta dish (for those who like seafood). The chicken parm is also amazing. In my opinion, get a pasta dish here over pizza. You can taste the homemade goodness. If you order a chicken dish that comes with veggies or potatoes - swap for pasta, you're more than allowed.  I miss this place the most of all since I left Hoboken and whenever I come back to visit, I make it a point to come here. **Note: 2 credit cards max per table, so bring cash**
2014-09-04,2,The first time I ate here, I ordered the chicken parm sandwich, which I found to be really tasty. When I came back the second time, I was disappointed to find out that the sandwich is not served at dinner time, since it's a lunch special.  The linguini served with the chicken parm platter was too undercooked and sticky.  My boyfriend ordered the lobster ravioli which sounded great on the menu but was not appetizing at all. If you are interested in this dish it is not served in a  red sauce, but rather a creamy herb-like sauce.  I didn't want to give up on this place because of the great reviews and the location, so I went back again and ordered a chicken Caesar salad. While the grilled chicken was juicy, it was thrown on top of a bed of lettuce, which lacked everything that makes up a Caesar..no parmesan cheese or quality dressing. The salad dressing tasted like a cross between Ranch and Caesar store dressing. Disappointed to have paid what I did for it. The service was extremely slow, and the owner (I think) checked to see if everything was ok. I didn't complain. The credit card machine was not working when it was time to pay. Having no cash, I walked to the nearest ATM and paid a $2.00 fee. When I got back to the table, I thought they would at least take off my soda or something...nothing.  I understand some things are out of our control, but paying extra was not fair to me, the customer.Maybe this place should just stick to their pizza, which apparently they seem to be known for. I'm ready to try some place new.
2014-09-02,5,We absolutely love this place!  Among other entrees, the penne vodka with chicken is superb, and the service is outstanding.  It's a cool little spot, and we will keep coming back.
2014-08-19,4,I am a huge fan of Margherita's! The food is reasonably priced and really delicious and the staff is generally quite good. My only problem is they close super early on Sunday nights and rush you out of there even if you've made it in time to sit down. Considering the place is closed on Monday it seems a little weird to close so early on Sunday (kitchen firmly closes at 8:45) in a town like Hoboken.
2014-08-18,3,Came for dinner and tried several items off the menu. No surprises here. Traditional Italian with no bells or whistles. Items ranged from slightly bland to slightly above average. Can't see myself returning.
2014-08-03,5,I absolutely love this place.  I do not know why they don't have a higher rating.  Their homemade pasta is unreal.  Now that I am gluten free, I am so thrilled that they offer gluten free pasta.  Their sauces are delicious.  The vodka sauce is their best.  The ragu is also fantastic and even just getting pasta with garlic and oil is fantastic.  Their only sauce that I don't love is their pesto.  Also, their clam sauce is not made with fresh whole clams, so that is a little bit of a disappointment.  Their chicken parm is the absolute best I have ever had at any restaurant.I love that they bring you bruschetta with your meal and that it is BYIB.  When we lived in Hoboken we frequented this place often and were never disappointed.  It can feel super cozy and romantic and they never rush you out of the door!
2014-08-02,5,I love this restaurant! We live in nearby Jersey City, so this is an easy place to get to. That said, I would rather go here than most Italian places in Manhattan. The food is excellent, the service very friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere is lively and fun. And it's reasonably priced. BYOB.
2014-07-21,5,One of, if not the best, chicken parms I've ever had.  Their entire menu is delicious, but I go for the parm.  And it's BYOB!  Tough to beat.
2014-07-18,2,Not the best slice in Hoboken but not the worst. Pizza without tomato sauce is like a human without a soul.
2014-07-12,5,One of my favorite Hoboken BYOB locals. It's been consistently good over the years. I generally order the chicken parm and end up taking at least half home for one or two more meals. The chicken cutlet is always tasty and that Vito's mutz can't be best. Speaking of mutz, the spedini is quite a treat as an appetizer. The cavatelli and broccoli is also very good, but doesn't deliver that well and arrives a bit watery for me. In the restaurant it is much better. I'm not a fan of the pesto because it is cream based, but I guess people like it. My husband always orders the penne with vodka sauce and chicken.  I don't love that it contains capers, but I think you can ask them to leave them out. If I have to say anything bad - it would be that the delivery can take quite a long time and the bread that comes with is not very good. If you go in the winter, the place is so small that you can end up sitting near (or almost in front of) the door and when it people are going in and out, you get blasted with cold air. They should get a heavy curtain or fix that somehow. I've had dinner with my coat on once or twice, but I keep going back because I really do like the food. It's not some super trendy restaurant for people who want to eat healthy- it's a old-school Hoboken classic that will impress you with its food.
2014-07-11,4,Margherita's is a nice local Italian spot. Like many Hoboken restaurants, it's a BYOB. The food is consistently good and I love that they make their own pasta!Ambiance: quaint old school Italian restaurant feelService: great service! Attentive hostess and wait staff. My daughter and I waited for my husband for almost 30 mins during prime dinner time and we did not feel rushed. After dinner, while going out the door, the two waiters that were holding food almost broke that back trying to hold the door for us! How sweet!Food:Our go-to dishes:* Antipasto - big salad w/ endives and ample portion of meat and cheese and can feed two as an appetizer * Penne Vodka - can't go wrong with good pasta and sauce* Chicken Arrabbiata - love the kick in this dish and the hot cherry peppers add so much flavor* Chicken Carol - love the capers and wine sauce* Filet Of Sole - this is a great dish to have if you're going low carb; it's quite buttery though but great flavor.* Margherita's Pizza - my fave; fresh mozz, tomatoes and prosciuttoThe special that was so special:I had the clam and shrimp fra diavolo w/ black fettuccini yesterday and wow I was so impressed! The sauce was spicy and great flavor! The clams were cooked perfectly  but the shrimp was overcooked just a smidgen. I absolutely loved this dish so much that I had to write this review about it today! :)
2014-06-26,1,If you're looking for great Italian food--or even mediocre? Keep looking. Anyone who thinks this even resembles Italian food, needs to get out (of Hoboken) more.Nothing about this place is good, or Italian. The pasta, was gummy, say no more. if you call yourself an "Italian restaurant" and you can't get that right, you've got some problems, and this place does. the "antipasto", was ridiculously American. Poor ingredients, with no inspiration from Italy, whatsoever. Now, granted, the bar in Hoboken for good food, or real Italian food is pretty low, but this place is so far below the bar, that you'd be better off at Olive Garden--no joke.And to those that seriously think this is good, or "real" Italian food, I suggest you start with a trip to NYC, and then to Italy.
2014-06-22,4,Wonderful cozy little italian place on washington street. Ive been coming here for years. The food is always good and it is BYOB which is unbeatable. Sometimes there is a wait but they give you one of those alarm buzzers so you can wait in the bar next door for a table to open up. This is one of my favorite date spots in hoboken.I always order the penne vodka with chicken and have never been disappointed. They bring out complimentary bruschetta and fresh bread first too. One of these days i'll try their dessert but i never remember to save room!
2014-06-09,5,Wow was I impressed. Roommates and I wanted to get something small since we all had off of work. We went in and got a small cheese pie and shared a salad. It's byo so we brought a bottle of wine that the had opened. Not not was the pizza fresh and yummy, the bruschetta and bread they serve complimentary was deliciously fresh and very delicious. Service was great for a couple of girls just splitting a pizza!Will be back for more food!
2014-06-09,3,Went for lunch with a large group. It is a tiny place so we are lucky They could accommodate us. We ordered a variety of food so I can comment on most of the stuff in the menu. The salads were excellent, the pasta came out underdone (weird for an Italian place) and the sandwiches were right on point. Our food took so long to come out that I was dying for some food. I was jealous of the people who came in after us and finished their meal while we were still waiting They do give you bread-and-butter when you sit down but it really is nothing special. It feels a little crowded with all the stuff hanging on the walls and the tiny tables but I guess that's what they have to work with. The staff were nice enough but never went out of their way to make it accommodating for us. You can tell that this place is authentic as they get and has been here for a long time. I would like to try it again for a better experience!
2014-05-21,5,A friend in Hoboken took me here back in November and I've been hooked ever since. The portions are huge for the price and the food is absolutely delicious. It's one of those places that, for me, has been so consistently good I've been compelled to bring friends and family here when they visit. I usually get the penne arrabbiata and substitute the red sauce for the tomato cream sauce. It's fantastic. Talk about a food-gasm! (If that's not a "thing" I'm making it one right now, that's how good it is)The last time my dad came to visit my boyfriend and I brought him here and he got the seafood for one and now it's my new favorite. $20 bucks gets you a huge portion of seafood cooked perfectly in a red sauce and pasta that absorbs all the seafood juices......It. Is. AMAZING. I'll admit I haven't been here when this place is packed, I usually try to go on low-key nights since its a small place and doesn't take reservations. It's also BYOB, which pretty much seals the deal for me. I leave feeling fat and happy in the best way possible, and a walk along the water after makes for a perfect night.
2014-05-18,2,This BYOB Italian restaurant is average at best. The restaurant always seems to be crowded. I never really understood why.  I haven't been to the restaurant in several years because I though the food was OK. my wife and I recently decided to try it again. It's still bland food. We tried the mussels app. They were decent. My wife had the shrimp primavera. It was very bland with no taste. She barely ate half of it. I had the chicken and penne. It's was average. The sauce was medicore. I will say our server was great. We won't be back.
2014-03-20,2,Strictly OK food.The portions are huge for the price but just so full of cream. I was there with a group and got to try a couple of different pastas and sauces. They were all just OK in taste. Not going back.
2014-03-02,2,This hurts to write, it really, truly does since Margherita's has been one of my favorites since relocating to Hoboken almost 5 years ago. It has really taken a step, maybe two back, in recent months. I could speculate all I want but something just ain't right. The once tasty and decadent meals now feel more like Olive Garden assembly line. Just no personality or flavor to them the past few times. ALso, the meals come out so fast that you feel rushed. I get it's a small place and they have to turn tables but I'm not OK with a 20-minute restaurant experience. Let me at least finish the bottle of wine I brought. Once that's done you can kick me out! The service is fast and polite, but also kind of smothering, especially the busboys trying to clear something as soon as you put your fork down.Maybe I've caught them on off nights or with the B team, but consider this tough love! Get back to4-stars, M's!
2014-02-12,5,Love the armosphere at this restaurant it's set up very beautifullyThe head guy opened the door for me and also greeted me right away.They bruschetta with bread right away but also warm bread an butter such a great duo !I ordered the chicken parm and I'm not exaggerating it was one of the best chicken parm I ever had! The price was right for the amount of food they give you! Service was quick and very friendly . Lastly, we topped it off with a tartufo And the presentation was fantastic and god I can't wait to go back to this place
2014-02-04,4,I'm so in love with the fettuccine alfredo with shrimp/chkn mix. DELICIOUS!! I have been searching for a local Italian place that serves the best version of my favorite dish and I've found it. The place is rather small, so dinning is pretty tight and it does get very loud but the food is that good to bare it. The food even over shadowed my bad date.. haha so that's great. You can b.y.o.w which is good, i'd like it better if they served their own but It's fine. I suggest you call ahead and make a reservation and ask to be against the wall or you will be touching elbows with person next you. Enjoy..
2014-01-12,4,This place is a Hoboken staple. Great Italian food and reasonable prices. Byob. Complimentary bruschetta and delicious warm bread. Make sure you get there early if going on a weekend because it's small and gets crowded. They do have the buzzers which work at the bar across the street if you have to wait for your table. Alternatively they deliver and are on Seamless. Food delivers well so don't be afraid. I have been eating at this place maybe once every month or two for years.I'm a huge fan of their chicken dishes, especially the chicken florentine, but the pasta dishes are great too. They often run great specials so be sure to ask. The fried calamari can be really good too, but sometimes they undercook it so be sure to ask for it crispy. Pizza is just ok at best...you definitely can do much better in Hoboken. As I said this is great Italian food! Great interesting dishes with lots of flavor. The only issue I ever have with Margs is consistency. If they're real busy then they can get sloppy you can occasionally get a bad meal ...ie something under or over cooked. But more often than not everything is perfect. Margs is defiantly worth it if you've never had it. I definitely get a craving for it ever now and then.
2013-12-07,4,Great place for a quality Italian dinner at a reasonable price. Byob always helps. Chicken Marsala was fantastic. I also really like their home made penne vodka... Free bruschetta never hurts.
2013-12-02,3,Pretty good Italian place in Hoboken. The service was a little slow but that's pretty typical at Italian restaurants. The food was good just not Amazing. Decent prices and it's a cool little place though.
2013-12-01,5,Bruschetta came out immediately and was served on divisors crostinis. We started with fried calamari that fed 4 and was crispy and amazing. I had the fettuccine Alfredo for my entree. The Alfredo sauce was as good as any but the homemade pasta was incredible. Finished with a tartufo and espresso, both of which were just spot on. First time, but not last time there for sure.
2013-11-03,4,This is my new favorite Hoboken Italian eatery (why did you forsake me, Tutta Pasta???). I've been here for their pizza and pasta, and both specialties are awesome. My latest visit to this fine establishment was yesterday afternoon (11/02) to celebrate my move to Hoboken. I was with my boyfriend and my sister, and we were all starving and worn out from the stress of packing, unpacking, etc. We ordered fried calamari and Spinedi (sic?) for appetizers, which were delicious. The Spinedi was fried mozzarella with capers, served with their homemade tomato sauce. NOM NOM. For our main entrees, I had rigatoni with meat sauce, my boyfriend had meatball parmigiana, and my sister had pasta with sautéed broccoli. I almost finished my dish, but I wanted to save room for dessert. The pasta was al dente, and the bits of meat were tender and added a nice texture to the sauce. My boyfriend's meatballs were also flavorful and complemented nicely by the cheese in his dish. For dessert we ordered the chocolate mousse cake. I loved it, but my boyfriend thought the cake-to-mousse ratio was heavily in favor of cake. Pshaw. More dessert for me! We ended up taking the calamari, Spinedi, and the meatball parmigiana home. I just reheated it and finished the leftovers now--still delicious. You've earned yourself a loyal paying customer, Margherita's.
2013-10-31,4,Good food, good atmosphere and its a BYOB. Highly recommend the marg. pie, it's delicious. I will be back for sure.
2013-10-18,5,Love this place and have been going here for years. This is my favorite italian in hoboken...perfect date place the food is not that expensive and its always a good time. I see new spots opening up all the time in this town.... I try them and always come back here.  Perfect example: otta strada (over rated -- just a trendy spot right now.)I always get the penne vodka and am never disappointed :) extra capers is a must for me ha. My husband always gets the chicken parm sandwich...And we always get either the mozzarella sticks or the garlic bread with mozzarella (and a side of marina )Added bonus. BYOB. Die hard fan
2013-10-17,2,I don't seem to understand why this place is so crowded always.. I tried it once for lunch. The pasta was undercooked.. the marinara was just tomato puree and nothing else. It was a disaster! Then I decided to give it another chance and went on a busy Saturday evening and tried a Salmon special. The salmon was so dry.. the sauce was decent but even my husband's entree, the ravioli, left a lot to be desired. Try Gigi's instead! It is a tiny little new Italian cafe.. nothing fancy.. but has amazing food!!
2013-09-21,2,We ordered a calamari appetizer and then I had the linguini with clam sauce. The calamari was deep battered and fried - tasted like fried cardboard! My linguini was bizarre. The pasta was fresh - absolutely amazing. But the sauce was made from a can! Why would you use canned clams?! Oh, and to top it off, it took an hour before our food came out and our waitress barely came over to even apologize for the wait or refill our water. Not planning a return.
2013-09-06,1,Horrible. Should have left the second the hostess was rude to me and my parents when we walked. She seated people who came in after us in a table we asked for! Apparently she knew them. Nice! So we stay anyway. The clams casino was oily, cold and inedible. The pasta watery and overcooked. The sauce had an odd aftertaste. The restaurant smelled like bleach. And to top it off our waitress was rude too. If you want good Italian go to Augustino's down the street. For a good byo with nice service go to piccolo Roma or Havana cafe. Don't give your business to these creeps.
2013-08-23,1,We went to this restaurant as a group of 9 adults, 3 children and one baby. They refused to sit us outside since our group is so big for them. The manager advised that max number of people can sit on a table is 4-5. Since we were so hungry and I didn't want to walk anymore I said we can be seated in 3 tables no problem. Then she said  maximum number is 4 people per table..I said ok, we can sit in 4 table as well. As she really tried to lose our business, she said the only way they can serve us if she assigns 4 waitress with 4 different check. I nodded and said OK. She was not aware that the total amount including tip wouldn't change..she finally said I can not bring the stroller and it has to be left outside of the fences..There is no way I am leaving my 3 weeks old baby girl outside so we walked out..unless their pizza is the best pizza in whole area , no need to spend time on this business where they do not value their customers.We walked one more block to Benny Tudino where we were seated outside..their pizza was so good! oh btw, one awesome waitress took care all of us..
2013-07-22,5,The location & food are incredible. Far enough off the stretch to be quieter than the rowdy Hoboken, but close enough to walk from the PATH.As far as food, the prices are around $12-$20, but the portions are gigantic! Each time I go I take home leftovers.BYOB too! The bar across the street sells wine bottles for a reasonable price.
2013-06-30,4,Food was amazing!!!!!! Very exquisite recipes. If you like over the top service, ask for Rafael. He will accommodate all you needs and preferences....
2013-06-26,3,I am torn should I give this place a three or a four.... ok so three. They do give complimentary bruschetta which is nice, but I thought the flavor was lacking and the toast was a little hard. The buffalo chicken pizza was AMAZING. I really did enjoy the pizza- it was their special that day. It had great flavor and perfect amount of kick. The calamari was just ok. Sitting outside on a nice day at a BYO is always good with me. Next time I come, I will stick with just the pizza
2013-06-24,4,I've been here a few times since moving to Hoboken and the food is consistently good. I came here with my mom once and she ordered the Mozarella appetizer salad, and for less than $10, we expected something totally tiny. Boy, were we wrong. The salad came out with tons of house-made mozzarella on a bed of arugula, tomatoes, and olives. There was enough for us to save for later. The pasta is always a huge portion and I love to save it for later. I would go 5 stars except for the staff is sometimes confused about orders and getting things right. I also think the prices are slightly high for frequent visits, but it is nice to pay $20 for pasta and have tons of extras. They also give a lot of bread (always a plus), a plate of bruschetta to start, and it's BYOB.
2013-05-14,5,Better pizza than Mack and Manko of ocean city nj. More cheese with mozzarella added.  Sauce excellent. And lunch 2 slices and soda. $5 wow
2013-05-07,4,Okay, maybe a new favorite since Tutta Pasta "mysteriously" closed their doors.  This place is tight, like most Hoboken establishments.  There was no surprise there.  It's BYOB so great for guys like many of us that could be paying a mortgage on a 6000 sq foot house anywhere in the country for the amount of rent we pay to live in this 1 square mile of thievery. I've ordered twice in the last two weeks.  Once in the restaurant, and once for take out.  It's a toss up between Trattoria Sapporito and here.  I'm going to give the nod to this place just because the value is much better.  Both are delicious.  I think you have a little more variety here b/c you can get pizza here too if you don't want to go too extra.The bill was reasonable, the food was great, and they delivery version was served hot even for a place that is  a few blocks away.  Hats off to the cavatelli and broccoli with chicken.  It made great leftovers.Check this place out if you haven't already.
2013-04-30,4,I have been going to Margheritas for years.  It is the only Italian restaurant besides Augustinos that I think is worthy of my dinner presence in Hoboken.  It is enjoyable in the winter to eat inside given its warm and cozy feel.  it is also enjoyable in the summer to sit outside and people watch on Washington Street.  Plan to wait up to an hour and a half if you get there after 7 on a Friday or Saturday.  Enjoy a drink at the bar next door with your buzzer.  Unlike Augustinos, it is BYOB and you don't need to reserve months in advance.  I really like their baked calamari and get it over linguine with a spicy sauce.  It never disappoints!
2013-04-03,4,Been coming here for years. Great BYOB place in Hoboken. Priced right, good food, good atmosphere, and noce location. I'll def be going back here.
2013-03-15,5,I LOVE this place! The people are always friendly, the food is always good, the prices are reasonable and the portions are great! This is my go to italian place.
2013-03-07,4,First time here and I loved it! BYO so Ben and I brought a bottle of red. They start you out with some bruschetta which tasted fresh. We ordered a Caesar salad to share  and I'm glad we shared because it was massive! Great Caesar. I had a ravioli special with sausage. The sauce was amazing on top. Ben had rigatoni and meat sauce and the pasta was cooked to perfection...tasted homemade to me. We went on a Sunday around 6 half the restaurant was full...as soon as we sat down the place filled in quickly to the max. That being said we still had excellent service. I even indulged in some cheesecake at the end which is not like us to order dessert. Delicious. I will be back :)
2013-02-27,3,I have ordered from this place a few times and it's very inconsistent! Fist time I ordered the pizza was amazing, the second it was burnt as if it had put in the oven twice, the third it was too greasy! I'm not sure what's going on here! It's not the most expensive place in town and their portions are good but I just don't get the inconsistency!
2013-02-25,2,My husband and I lived in Hoboken 8 years ago and this place was delicious-pasta was very fresh. We just ate here last night and it was average. Sad to see it go so downhill. New ownership maybe?
2013-01-27,4,The definition of a Hoboken neighborhood joint. Filled with local families. Very large portion sizes (makes for a great lunch the next day) and friendly waitresses. Never tried the pizza but l can certainly say the fettuccine Alfredo is great if you don't care about that diet for a day.
2013-01-26,2,In northern NJ you expect to find great Italian.  I found mediocre at best here.  The lunch special is priced accordingly and you are loaded with a ton of food.  The pasta was under cooked.  The meatballs were overcooked and very generic tasting.  The sauce was also pretty marginal.  Nothing really prompted me to come back unfortunately.  Saving it was the price, the waiter, and the convenience.  You can tell they care.
2013-01-25,4,I think this place is family-owned.  It sure felt like it on the visits we've had at this place.  The bus boy to the HNIC were very attentive.  The food there is pretty good as well - from the complimentary bruschetta, to the pasta dishes, and to the pizza.  Did I mention it's BYOB?  Oh wait - I forgot.  Yes - it is, and worth mentioning again and again.  Margherita's is rock solid.....
2013-01-19,5,Wow! LOVE LOVE LOVE. Do urself a favor and go! my girlfriend and I (who is an extremely picky eater) were craving Italian food and wanted to try something new. Well I'm glad I picked this place. Food was AMAZING omg! She had rigatoni with meat sauce -5 stars and I had the chicken parm with linguine & marinara sauce. The pasta taste so fresh and homemade. And the marinara sauce was probably the best I ever had. This is def our new go to spot for Italian food. No complaints here. And it's BYOB!!! Perfect place. Oh and to top it off a delicious cannoli ! And we had food to take home.Check was only $40.  Can't beat it.  ***Whoever posted the review that said its pasta with ketchup clearly doesn't know what Italian food is lol.***
2013-01-13,4,Nice little hidden gem here!  You'll have to put up with a short wait at this BYOB pre-bar hot spot, but it's worth it.  Pasta is home made and the chicken parm is really tasty.  Their a la vodka sauce is very, very good.  Portions are pretty large as well.  Service was good and friendly.We watched groups of 25 year old women walk in and out of here for like an hour, so guys should be on notice that this is a good place to meet that "special someone"  (nyuk nyuk).Not as good as Augustino's, but for the money, it's without a doubt one of the best values in Hoboken.  Looking forward to coming back.
2013-01-04,2,I stopped here for dinner with friends one evening. The menu was in my opinion not very impressive. In any case I got one of the specials, which was gnocchi with Italian sausage. Our table ordered for an appetizer the fried mozzarella, which was good.  It's essentially one large mozzarella stick.  The bread they bring out prior to the meal was in my opinion also good. The entree however left a lot to be desired. First of all the gnocchi was oddly shaped and bland. Additionally, the plate/bowl it was served had so much broth or whatever it was the dish was soupy. One other issue that irked me was that I explicitly said I did not want any dessert and they mistakenly brought me out a $10 cappuccino. There are too many better options in Hoboken and I likely won't be returning here. I would have given this place 3 stars for the app and the bread, but the below average entree and service issue I mention brought it down to 2 stars.
2013-01-04,4,Went to this place for the first time in the summer and it was delish!  We were looking for a nice relaxing dinner outside and this place was exactly what we were looking for.  Like everyone mentioned, the complimentary bruschetta is a great start to your meal.  We had the linguine with white clam sauce & the specialty pizza for dinner.  The LWCS was perfectly sauced and not at all soupy like you sometimes get at other places, but the pizza was the piece de resistance.  The specialty pizza had mozzarella, cajun chicken, broccoli rabe, & roasted garlic.  We got it with whole wheat crush and it was cooked to perception.  We saw a lot of other awesome dishes come out, which we will definitely be going back to try!
2012-12-26,3,I have already professed my love for Napoli (and Grimaldi's to a lesser extent). That said, I try to make sure something is really the best before jumping to conclusions. Thus, I had to try some other outpost in Hoboken.After perusing the menu, I was rather impressed with the variety of offerings. Pesto on my pizza? Yes please...Julia's Pizza it is (with pepperoni added, of course).The result? Not bad. Pretty tasty. Compared to Napoli, however, I could feel the pending myocardial infarction. I found the pie to be very greasy (read: I know I'm a messy eater to begin with and Emily Post apparently had no impact on me, but this stuff really messed up my shirt with the grease drippage). Also, the crust was chewier than my desired "crisp" thin crust.Would I eat it again? Perhaps. That said, I don't believe Napoli to be dethroned just yet.
2012-12-07,4,Solid BYOB Italian joint in town. The service here is always pretty solid. The owner or manager there always says "welcome to Margherita's" and gets you a seat. The place is cramped in the colder months when there is no outdoor seating. The pictures on the all are all of what I can assume are family members. The last time we were there we brought wine the same gentleman from above said "let me take that, you worry about enjoying your meal and I'll worry about this." That one statement and taking our wine I think was spectacular and a rarity in a lot of joints.The food is pretty darn good. The bruschetta they give you complimentary to start is excellent and plentiful and the bread is also warm and delicious. The pasta, sauces, meats are all excellent. I had the chicken rollatini special and it was fantastic! My wife got fettuccine Alfredo which was also pretty good, not the best but pretty good.I love old school, local Italian joints it reminds me of my grandmother and I love me some nostalgia while I eat...minus getting whacked with a spoon. I also love the BYOB option. I still haven't tried their pizza though which I keep meaning to do because pizza is my weakness. Give it a try!
2012-12-02,4,My siblings (+ s.o.'s) and I took our mom out for her birthday on a Friday night recently . We wanted to check this place out specifically because it's a BYOB and were very happy there. May have partially been due to all the wine I drank but I thought the food was delicious, and so did everyone else I was with. Had the mussels with a marinara based sauce, the spedini, and mozzarella sticks for appetizers, then got some pastas and pizzas for the main courses. Service was great especially considering how large/obnoxiously loud of a group we were. Only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the prosciutto pizza really didn't have enough prosciutto at all (only a few small pieces) but otherwise this place was a home run. Reasonably priced and right on Washington for a bonus.
2012-11-30,1,How in the world can someone find the food tasty. It's awful! Especially their pizzas. Messy & gooey. The pastas dishes are terrible. Makes me wonder if the owner pays people to place reviews. See for yourself, you will be sorry.
2012-10-19,2,Really confused by this place, because while it has a solid reputation and is very popular, we simply had a terrible meal.Service was fine, and our appetizer (mozz and tomato salad) was tasty. My wife had the Chicken Carole, which was bland, soupy and generally unappealing.  Even the simple sides were all wrong; The carrots were undercooked, and potatoes were tasteless and mushy... Gross.  My step-son ordered pizza that can only be described as jaw-droppingly bad considering the competition in Hoboken from other pizza options; It truly resembled a pre-assembled frozen pizza in taste and crust quality.  The best dish was the pedestrian pasta special I ordered.  Honestly, we were shocked at the quality of the food.Maybe we had an off night, and we'll probably give it another try based on reputation, but two stars is all I can give it for now, and that may be generous.  I know the other Yelpers reviewing this place must know good Italian food since we're all familiar with the Hoboken area and all of the great options, so I am scratching my head over this.
2012-10-17,4,This Italian spot has been in Hoboken for who knows how long. But for the longest time I avoided it and it fell out of my favor. I am not sure why. Maybe when I was younger the prices (which now seem extremely reasonable and worth it) were too very much for my little allowance, or it felt too much like a couples retreat or family dining. But now, I am obsessed.My boyfriend and I go all the time, especially when we are in a foodie pickle. Hoboken has a lot of great restaurants, don't get me wrong, and it is deffo fun to try out new places and see new things. But sometimes, you just want what you know. And we know Margheritas. The food is pretty much always consistent, though sometimes portion sizes differ slightly, and sauces can be mildly different or thinner. But all in all, you are headed for a good Italian meal when walking into the door of the restaurant.Currently I am stuck on the lobster ravioli drowned in a creamy pesto sauce. I am deffo a sucker for pesto, especially creamy pesto (which is hard to find). And these large stuffed pastas, drenched in the perfect combination of salt, basil and cream and oil, really hits the spot. There are only maybe five or six ravioli, but I get full every single time. The pasta tastes so fresh and feels handmade, with just the right amount of lobster and cheese to create the perfect ratio. The pesto is also delicious, smooth and subtle, though sometimes there is a bit too much sauce. My boyfriend seems to be permanently stuck on the chicken parm, which is the biggest portion I really see throughout the various Italian restaurants in the area. The plate is huge, heaping with perhaps slightly overcooked spaghetti, and large pieces of breaded chicken breasts, smothered in mozzarella cheese. He actually gets full. It is not the dainty amounts that you sometimes see and pay more for.The desserts are also always a plus. Please please please try the crème brulee cheesecake if it is on the dessert chalkboard when you are there. There is something about it that screams both cheesecake and crème brulee. Maybe it is the bruleed sugar on top of the cheesecake that is toasted to a perfect brown, but sometimes I think it is actually the cheesecake that is different than others, less tart and cutting. The staff is generally friendly, buzzing around and taking orders, bringing out bread or bruschetta, and the manager always seems to be around. Sometimes there is a wait, depending on the time or day, but the place never seems empty, which I think is a good sign. The prices are so right and my belly is always full when I leave. I do not see any kind of hiatus from Margheritas in the near future.
2012-09-30,1,Overrated! We went to this place and were really disappointed. The place was crowded when we arrived, setting some high expectations. Although the food was ok, not outstanding, the waiters made it a bad experience. They were shabby and didn't bother about their guests at all. When we got home, my girlfriend and I both got sick.
2012-09-15,4,The best part about this place was the service, although it took a little long to get it started.  The owner asked us if we'd be ok with moving over one table and because of this minuscule inconvenience he offered us dessert and coffee on the house and the waitress was very attentive.The food was decent enough.  We ordered the spedini, penne vodka, chicken carol, chocoloate mousse cake and cannoli.  The spedini, penne vodka and desserts were ok.  The chicken carol was superb minus the mixed vegetables.
2012-09-13,5,After deciding that we wanted Italian food for supper, we came across this restaurant and it was packed with only 1 table left; so we took it. The free bruschetta was good. The homemade bread was good as well but their homemade pasta and sauces were awesome. I didn't feel rushed nor felt like they were trying to get rid of us, despite the fact that there were many people waiting for tables. Actually, the owner even came to our table and chatted with us a bit and we had never eaten here before. All in all they had very good food and atmosphere at great prices. I totally recommend Margherita's.
2012-09-04,5,I love all the food I have eaten hear. Free bruschetta AND a bread basket. It's BYOB so the food costs are lower than some others. The portions are large and I always have a doggie bag to take home for lunch the next day. I recommend the fresh moz salad, fried zucchini sticks, chicken parm, rigatoni with meat sauce, chicken sorrentino, flourless chocolate cake is amazing for desert if you have room! I am sure the rest is just a wonderful but these are what I have personally tried.
2012-08-27,3,I met my family in Hoboken for a Sunday lunch. My criteria was Italian, casual, and preferably with pizza. Margherita's showed up on Yelp, so we gave it a whirl. The restaurant was larger than I imagined, with about 3 long rows of tables inside, and a few outside. They didn't have any brunchy egg dishes on the menu, so we all got pasta and pizza. My pepperoni pizza was pretty good, but the tomato sauce was a little too chunky for my liking. I appreciated that it had small fresh tomatoes in it, but that's not my jam. The real standout dish was my mom's linguine with clams. She assured me it was fresh pasta, and it was served in a creamy sauce. This dish was garlicky and so flavorful. Definitely the stand out on the table. It was pretty empty for 1pm on a Sunday, so they had one waiter for the whole place. That made the service a little bit spotty, but not horrible. Would I go back? Probably not.. too many other choices in Hoboken.
2012-08-11,4,Had a very enjoyable meal here. The place has a nice sidewalk patio and a very cozy and welcoming interior.  Service was good.  The free bruchetta was tasty.  Our salads were fresh and plentiful.  And the two pizzas we ordered were delicious. Prices are just right. I do wish the place served alcohol, but apparently you can BYO.  A very nice place to stop and enjoy some good food!
2012-07-19,5,Food is amazing. Cozy atmosphere. Great outdoor area. BYOB is a plus!
2012-06-28,5,Have been going to this place very often. Rigatoni pesto rocks! So does the Julia's pizza.
2012-06-26,3,Margherita's is okay, and I always have a good meal here, but it's nothing special.  They've had the same menu for so long, though they do change the specials now and then.  It's a good bargain, as the portion size is HUGE, so maybe that's why there is always a crowd waiting outside for a table.  I particularly like their cavatelli and broccoli.
2012-05-25,3,Margherita's is a very small corner restaurant in Hoboken, probably houses no more than 10-15 tables.  Service is friendly, but very abrupt, and this made me feel quite rushed to finish my meal.  Food is only so-so, definitely not impressed with the overall food quality.  We started out with mozzarella sticks and their bruschetta for starters.  The tomatoes were really fresh and the mozzarella sticks oozed gooey deliciousness as long as you ate it upon arrival.  I ordered their Rigatoni Pesto with Sundried Tomatoes, a fresh, homemade rigatoni pasta in a pesto cream sauce with sundried tomatoes and pine nuts ($14.95).  Their pastas are supposed to be homemade and I don't know what "homemade pasta" is supposed to taste like, but if what I ate was homemade pasta, then I guess it just means that it is more chewey than the Barilla I purchase.  The dish promised me pine nuts, but I am more than 3/4 way through my leftovers and I still have yet to encounter one (tricky-tricky because I loves me some pine nuts and I ordered this dish because of it).  Good news is that it still tastes good the next day so the quality maintains its consistency.  HORRENDOUS parking experience.  It took me a half hour to find parking, circling all of Hoboken at least 5 times.  I feel like I've had an easier time finding parking in NYC.   It is a good location since it is on the busy main street, Washington, but far enough away that I would think twice before making guests trek 15-20 minutes over to Margherita's if they were taking public transport.  Since they don't have a parking lot either, I would think twice before asking guests to trek over unless they're current residents of the town.
2012-05-10,5,This place was amazing! The clam sauce is off the chart!! I couldn't believe how delicious it was! The bruschetta appetizer is on the house, enough for 2 and oh so good. It is byob which is the icing on the cake.
2012-05-03,4,Not even a fan of Italian Food but this place blew my mind and I finally realized what authentic Italian food tastes like. The service is so friendly too. Always a smile :)
2012-04-20,5,Just an update on previous review, this place only gets better and better. Try the chocolate peanut butter cake... just amazing
2012-04-03,5,My husband and I love this restaurant. It is BYOB, so depending on what kind of alcohol you bring, it is a very reasonably priced night out. The prices are great, the service is great and the food is delicious. It is always really busy, but the staff is very attentive and very friendly.If you are looking for a nice date night...definitely check it out!
2012-03-25,2,I really wanted to like this place- it's seconds from my apartment, there always seems to be a bustling crowd out front waiting for a table, and wait for it, wait for it.... BYOB!  But in the end, I found the wait annoying and thought that there were way too many tables packed into such a small area.  I ordered pasta with vodka sauce after reading that this is their specialty.  I was extremely disappointed with this dish.  The pasta was obnoxiously overcooked-- how does a place that specializes in pasta get this wrong?   I also thought that they put too much sauce on the pasta, making it feel like I was just eating pasta soup.   I am still giving this place two stars though because, like I said, I want to like it!  I would be willing to try again on the chance that my experience was an anomaly.
2012-03-19,3,Went there last night with friends. Very cozy, as are most Hoboken places, but we got a good seat. The Chicken Carol was decent but my husband's pizza was delicious. Although he only sacrificed a bite, it was filled with a generous amount of great topics and the crust was perfect. The service is quick and as another person mentioned, it's not a leisurely dining experience. I wouldn't say it's fast food either but as soon as its clear you aren't getting dessert, your bill arrives a millisecond later since there is a bit o a wait (esp on a Friday night).
2012-03-07,4,Excellent Italian food, some of the best in town.  Definitely the best linguine and white clam sauce I've had in town.  Good specials.  Even their desserts are good.  And it's BYO!  Very reasonably priced for what you are getting, especially in Hoboken.  It feels a little cramped inside, though, and there is almost always a wait.  But if you can deal with that, you'll be in for a good meal.
2012-03-04,5,This is one of my favorite restaurants, so much so that I'll cross state lines--a lot!--for it. I started coming here in 2005, with a friend who lives in NJ. Seven years later, we still meet here to confab, gossip, and drink a whole lot of (BYOB) wine.I always order the same thing. It's become such a running joke between my friend and I--we always think that we'll try something new, but I always get rigatoni pesto with sundried tomatoes, and she always gets something with shrimp. We always split garlic bread with mozzerella. And everything on the menu looks awesome, but it's like, why eff with tradition? But my dish is good, there's always enough to bring home leftovers, which I never do, because I invariably end up leaving my bag of leftovers on a random bar stool. Sorry. We also always bring Little Penguin wine, which we always purchase at the Sparrow wine store. And then, we walk up Washington to put our names in, and more often than not, head over to the 8th Street Tavern (cash only) for a beer. I feel like I'm giving some sort of operating manual instructions, but honestly, this is like, my ideal girl's night out in Hoboken.Stuff to know:--Sometimes there's a wait, but the electronic buzzer has a range that'll bring you to the 8th street tavern. Head there, have a drink, keep in mind it's cash only.--Complimentary bruschetta=really effin' good--Tables are close together so make sure you check around you before you start bitching about a coworker--it's happened a few times that I've run into people I know there.--After, you can stumble down Washington for more drinks. It's our little tradition to go to Mikie Squared after (why? the name doesn't make sense, the drinks are average at best, and it's nothing special, but it's just what we do) then mosey back to the PATH station.
2012-03-04,3,Great atmosphere, decent Italian food. Have had pizza- which was great...solid thin crust pizza, chicken parm is average, penne a la vodka is average. BYOB is great.
2012-02-29,1,I called to place and order for delivery and the girl hung up on me! Guess i won't be calling anymore
2012-02-23,5,One of my favorite places to go out to eat in Hoboken! Here is why:1. BYO woohoo!2. Intimate atmosphere, great service, good people watching3. Brushetta AND bread, fo free!4. Daily specials, always delicious5. make their own mozzarellaEverything I have ever ordered here has been delicious. Great service every time. Be sure ti come either early or later to avoid the dinner rush, as it get's pretty packed! The best part is in the summer when they have seating outside on Washington. Can't beat it!
2012-02-19,3,Margherita's is a great neighborhood Italian destination with generous portions large enough to split at a very fair price.  Also, it's BYOB!We started with the tomatoes and mozzarella for $10 which was easily enough for 2-3 people to share.  The mozzarella was moist and soft and melts in your mouth.Two of us shared the seafood margherita for one for $23, and paid the extra $2 for the homemade whole wheat pasta.  It was pretty good, but not great.  I think next time I will try the cavatelli with broccoli.
2012-02-16,1,My recommendations:-Where's the kitchen...bc I can't see it...and that right there, sort of scares me-Re-vamp the menu...i.e. local, FRESH, organic choices are always welcome-Improve the atmosphere...not to be snarky...but it can use MUCH tending to-Improve the meal selection...chicken sorrentina should resemble its actual name...not grey chicken cutlets swimming aimlessly in a brown bath of cold broth (ew!).  Lets not forget the misplaced dollop of tomato sauce atop said sad grey chicken cutlet-Finally, food poisoning central...please steer clear of the green salad with grilled shrimp...it's not worth suffering for days
2012-02-16,3,Got whole wheat pizza with mushrooms + grilled chicken over greens ... pizza was really well done, grilled chicken was wonderfully moist and I was full without feeling heavy. Nice stop on business in Hoboken.
2012-01-26,5,This is our "go to" spot when we can't decide on something to eat. Sometimes we find ourselves here twice in a week. MMMMFresh mozz is off the chain here and we ALWAYS order a mozz salad to start. I usually go straight to the specials menu and I am NEVER disappointed. Most of the pasta is made in house so ask if your aren't sure.We also like getting treated well when we go somewhere and they really hit on that here. Our favorite/only/favorite waitress is Sarah. (Sit in her section...seriously) She is super cool and has great opinions on the menu. All in all I gave this spot my only 5 star to date. Not because the food is the best I have ever had but it ALWAYS delivers on quality, flavor, service and satisfaction. (Sometimes all of those are hard to come by at the same time, every time) We will be back ;)
2012-01-05,3,Delicious Italian-American fare. You will definitely feel full after a meal here, especially if you also order the spedini (fried mozzarella) to share as an appetizer. I love the feel of this restaurant with its wooden decor. The staff is really attentive. You will wait for a table on the weekends, but luckily their buzzers reach the bar across the street so you can have a beer at 8th Street Tavern while you wait.We tried the cavatelli with broccoli and the Ravioli Mondella. The ravioli were a little bit bitter, which means they didn't quite cook the eggplant properly but the marinara sauce is delicious.BYOB! woo hoo
2011-12-05,5,Love Margheritas!!!!!  The homemade pasta is fantastic!  BYOB...can't get much better than that!  Prices are very reasonable.I've had the Penne Vodka (some of the best Vodka sauce around) and the cavatelli with Broccoli (ultra garlicky which I love!).  Both dishes were excellent.  My boyfriend raves about the Chicken Parm (i'm a vegetarian, so I can't comment).  My family loves this place and so do my friends.  This is a great go-to spot for a date (atmosphere is kind of romantic) and it's also a great spot for small groups.  The wait staff is very friendly and the awesome owner always recognizes me when I come in.  I love the complimentary bruschetta (it's super yummy).  Can't wait to go back!
2011-11-26,3,This place is just ok. Our appetizer was excellent...but the main entrees not so much. We weren't even finished with our appetizer when our dinner was already being brought to the table. I understand that they want to serve as many customers as possible, but really it was way too fast. My dinner was not very good at all. Ordered white linguini and clam sauce. Pasta was very chewy and overcooked. The clams were not in their shells and tasted as they came from a can and the dish was so salty!  My husband enjoyed his chicken parma, but his pasta was chewy as well. Maybe if they didn't rush so much things would of been better.
2011-11-15,4,Food was fantastic!  personal pizza, chicken parm, mozz stix...all made me very happy..byob so its really cheap to go here..only thing is it was very packed on a fri night..and the crowd looked like they were visitors - not saying that is a bad thing, just an observation..
2011-10-19,4,Thanx to Judith Marciano for holding an amazing open house at 1100 Adams Street and even more for choosing Margheritas to cater the event! The chicken marsala was delicious and their salad was fresh! The realtors here at Empire Realty Group, LLC. want to thank you for the great food! See you for dinner soon!
2011-10-18,5,My fave place in Hoboken to go to!!! Its BYOB, and I love theres salads and pasta!  Oh and there mozzarella sticks are nice and gooey.  If you get tehre for dinner, they give you bruschetta, which isnt avalable for lunch, so I would suggest you going there for dinner.  I've been going there for about 8 years and still drive the half hour to ge my fave dish, which shrimp fra diavolo!!! Yummmmmmmmmmmm!!!!!!
2011-10-15,3,While visiting my sister in Hoboken, we ended up going here for dinner.  We walked in and were able to grab one of the corner tables by the window.  The place is pretty small and there are not a lot of tables so we were definitely fortunate to get seated where we did.  On a side note, they do have outdoor seating.  We brought some wine and beer with us since the place is a BYOB.  Right after being seated, they bring you out their bruschetta which I thought was very good.  We started off with a couple of apps - the stuffed mushrooms and some mozzarella sticks.  I was excited to try the stuffed mushrooms, but to be honest, they were a little bland and I just wasn't that impressed.  Mozz sticks were pretty ordinary - nothing special.  We ordered dinners and I decided to go with a ziti special that had sausage and meatballs.  My dinner was pretty good.  It wasn't over the top spectacular but it was good.  The veal meatballs were the highlight of the meal.  My wife had the penne arrabiata that she really liked and I sampled some of that, too.  Nice and spicy - just the way I like it.  Overall, everyone I was with really enjoyed their meals and the service throughout the meal was very good.  It is also worth noting that the prices are very reasonable.
2011-10-11,2,Hobokeners, I'm pretty disappointed in you.  I've seen this place packed on many occasions, so I finally decided to try it.  This town is known for its strong Italian presence, so I figured you all knew what you were doing.  And yet... you're satisfied with this mediocre, low quality Italian food???  Come on.  The pasta was boring and soggy and bland.  Yes, the bruschetta at the beginning of the meal is nice, and so is the warm bread.  But this was really a letdown.  I thought I was going to have very authentic, rich, savory, old-family-recipe gourmet italian food.  That is definitely not what I had.  I looked around and noticed many patrons were ordering the chicken parm, which looked like a mountain of cheese drowning the contents underneath.  I could go to the Olive Garden for this, and pay a hell of a lot less.  Not planning to go back.
2011-10-05,4,Awesome good food and low key to go any night of the week.  The people here are very friendly and everything comes out tasting good but not so salty or flavorful that you actually feel like it's bad for you.  All the ingredients on the veggie pizza we had was good.  The calamari we got to start with was fresh and flavorful as well.  This is a great place to go for a great low key dinner around the corner.
2011-09-10,3,There's something to be said for consistency.  Margherita's is consistently good, never disappointing, but also never the best either.  Its pretty affordable and features both indoor and outdoor dining.  You will always get bruschetta served to your table too.My favorite dish is definitely the pasts arrabiata but then again I love spicy food.  If you do too definitely go for it.  If you are looking for a safe restaurant option for standard Italian fare, Margherita's is always a great option.
2011-09-10,5,I have been there 3 times and every time I have had a great experience.  Costumer Service is top notch  - everybody is extremely friendly.  Even though it was very busy I did not feel rushed at all to finish my meal.  Food is great and well priced for the quality and quantity.  I would definitely recommend eating there.
2011-09-05,5,This place is delicious! They have awesome pizza, pasta, and salads. And when the weather is nice and you can sit outside it is always a perk. Plus, BYOW - bring your own wine!
2011-09-03,4,After a 10 year hiatus from this place for no particular reason, I recently started going here again. The pizza is downright awesome (and I am a very tough critic when it comes to my pizza) and the calzones make a great once in a blue moon treat. You can't go wrong with the pasta dishes either.  Just make sure you ask for it al dente. I believe on two occasions it was a little too mushy for my personal taste. The only thing I regret is taking off a decade from this fantastic, warm, family owned restaurant. Better late than never though!!
2011-08-30,2,The food is unquestionably good.  What's not good is the service or...well let's say the cost upfront!When your menus online say something is 12.95, and you order two entrees and two apps (bread and mozz sticks!) you don't expect a 50 dollar delivery bill.  But that's what I just got.  They don't update their prices online, and don't provide an itemized receipt so you don't know what you paid for unless you call...and that's when they give you the new prices.Reco:  Make sure you ask for prices before you order.  The food is good, but not THAT good.
2011-07-27,4,If there is one thing that Hoboken does well, perhaps it is creating a refuge for B-list celebrities. Oh wait, no that's not it. Washington Street is a surprising mecca for Italian Food! I reference of course the scandal created with Grimaldi's and the one place on Earth I know I can find a satisfying vodka sauce. Walk by, get your name on the list, and you'll have time to go buy a bottle of something before you're seated.Margherita's is a charming place with comfortable seating and literally the Best Penne Vodka in the known universe (the use of capers paired with a heavy creme - hard to pin down, impossible to replicate). Absolutely great for lunch with a group (check for specials), or for a dinner date. Salads are fresh and filling. Pizza is crisp and has flavorful ingredients (nothing is passed over). M's is worth the walk up Washington, to be certain.Not to harp on this penne vodka thing, but you gotta try it. Whenever my fiance and I order penne vodka anywhere else, we both take a bite, look at each other, and acknowledge that Margherita's is better. If this place is full up and won't seat you sooner than an hour from now, the closest substitute is actually at Maxwell's on 11th, believe it or not. We used to offer to babysit our nephew just to have an excuse to come uptown. BYOB (wine shop about a block North is perfect) and also BYO huge carbo-loading appetite of Italian descent! And if you're not Italian, just fake like you are. Everyone will think you're a B-list celeb and treat you real nice.
2011-07-21,3,I stopped by for lunch today and ordered a Caesar salad and the sliced ham sandwich with roasted peppers and fresh mozzarella.  The salad was medium size with fresh romaine, but the dressing seemed mayonnaise based.  The sandwich was pretty tasty (I took half home) and their bread is really good baguette style rolls.  All in all a good experience, but I wasn't blown away.
2011-07-06,4,Great booth up front in the window for my family of 4. The food was fantastic!  Really large portions (took home leftovers). Wait staff was adequate and helpful...but just did the basics. Really glad we found this small little restaurant during our stay in Hoboken. If it wasn't for recommendations on Yelp! We probably would have never stopped, but instead we found a great little Gem!
2011-07-06,5,Best Italian food in Hoboken. They have fantastic dishes and the specials are always fresh and changing. Its fairly priced and the portion sizes are tremendous. I'm a big eater and I've taken food back from there a number of times. The service is always good, even on a busy night. The BYOB aspect is also a nice touch since if you want good Italian in Hoboken there's no other BYOB options.The only downside is that its a small place and very popular so on busy nights expect to wait a bit, but its definitely worth it.
2011-07-05,4,Really great spot in Hoboken for Italian Food.  I do enjoy thier Rigatoni and Meat sauce.
2011-06-17,3,Ok, so Margherita's is really good. Love the food and its cheap...what more could you want, right? Really the only thing i can complain about (and its kind of a big deal) is how the waitstaff forces everyone to eat at lightning speed. I have been there 3 times and they were all kind of off days and times so i cant even justify it by saying they had a huge wait - because they didn't. Correct me if I'm wrong but don't Italians like a nice leisurely meal? Just saying... I am an ex-service industry person so I would never in my life be rude to waitstaff. My girlfriend, however, had no qualms telling the waiter to back off (in better words), and I'm glad. To wrap it up, I really like Margherita's but the waitstaff needs to pump the breaks when it comes to rushing people out.
2011-06-05,4,One of the best in Hoboken.I've lived here 15 years, and this has always been one of our very best restaurants. The owners are great people and they strive to create an enjoyable experience for every diner. I feel the consistency has dropped over the past two years, that's why I'm giving it four stars, but if you're new to Hoboken, this will definitely become one of your regular spots. If you're visiting, it is worth checking out--especially when the weather is warm. It's definitely not for the ruthless and toothless as you can read from the negative and ridiculously illiterate reviews-not every place can be like T.G.I. Friday's. Pasta dishes & pizza are your best bet. This is the place for delicious, casual fare in a friendly environment. Price is great too.
2011-05-28,2,Ten years ago, this place was absolutely amazing.  Now, it just sucks...  If I wrote this ten year ago, it would be 5 stars in a heart beat.  To write any more is waste of my time just as if I was to eat here again.
2011-05-04,3,Decent food. Decent pricing. Very mild decor, laid back old world family style environment. We ordered the mussels and clams as an appetizer. They were on par with similar items I've ordered in any other eatery. Nothing spectacular but not bad. I ordered the lobster ravioli with pesto sauce. I've ordered lobster rav far and wide and have never really experienced anything noteworthy. This was no exception. Overly creamy sauce and mushy lobster. Pricing was average for the most part. Their pizzas look good, my girlfriend raves about hers. In summation, decent place but your buck is probably spent best elsewhere.
2011-04-15,2,Customer Service was good but we ordered three things for take out that should have totaled thirty two dollars according to the menu online and ended up having to pay 41 dollars without getting a receipt of a break down of the charges. The fried calamari was good, but as for the fettuccine alfredo wheat pasta it was over cooked...noodles ended up melting in your mouth mush style..i ended up having to cook my own pasta to go with the sauce and ended up throwing their noodles out. We also ordered cavatelli e broccoli which was cooked okay but the sauce was extremely lacking...way watery and not flavorful as it should have been. We ended up staying away from the seafood dishes as our friend had just recently gotten food poisoning from one of the dishes under this category but we have heard the chicken dishes are good.
2011-04-04,4,When I think of the Italian restaurants in Hoboken, this place falls somewhere in the middle.  Pros- BYO, they take credit cards, the central location is great for meeting up.  Cons- they don't have ice buckets for white wine, the food isn't quite as good as say Leo's.  I've had pasta, salads, and branched out to the calzones- all are good.
2011-04-02,4,delicious pizza, amazing mozzarella salad, fast delivery service.  This is a great choice!
2011-03-03,5,Margherita's has been our go-to-restaurant for two years now.  Whenever we can't think of a different place to try, or have guests come in to town, we end up at Margarita's - and that's not a bad thing.  The place is, in one word, reliable.  Terrific food every time we come.It seems every time we come here there is a reliable 30-40 minute wait (but seated in 20-30). Reliable lively crowd.  Reliable dishes that we keep coming back for.Pizza - good, cheap, fillingChicken Parm - possibly the best in Hoboken.  I even prefer it to Onieals, which is saying a lot.  Huge portions.Lobster ravioli - My GF gets this every time.  Absolutely swears by it.  The sauce is out of this world.Various chicken/pasta dishes have never disappointed.  I am pleased every time we come here.BYO, btw.  So make sure you grab a bottle of wine or two to have with this classic Italian food.  When its warm, make sure to grab outdoor seating.
2011-02-25,4,Stopped here for lunch & very pleasantly surprised. Excellent service & the food was really, really good. I personally had the sausage & peppers hero & it was excellent. Sliced Sausage was real Italian along with fresh peppers & onions all in a delicious tomato sauce. Others with me had raviloli which they both enjoyed. I'd recommend you go there as I know I'll be going back.
2011-02-20,4,I like this place because it's nice, small and the food is great. I actually never tried their pizzas but every time we went there the other dishes were very good. However, they don't serve alcohol but you can bring your own bottle of wine.
2011-01-27,3,I really don't like pizza.  There.  I said it.  And I'm not sorry for it.  Despite this fact, I ate the vegetable pizza from Margherita's and it was pretty decent.  Everything was fresh (spinach, mushrooms, broccoli) and definitely not previously frozen like you find from some places.  But you know what?  It better be because a miniature pizza from here is going to run you $10.  The caesar salad, a bit of a better bargain, is big and comes in at $6 but there's way too much garlic in the dressing. So, the place is a bit pricey (I'm sure the BYOB makes up for it if you're drinking) but it's a decent casual neighborhood pizza place...Just nothing to write home about.
2011-01-17,5,Margherita's is always a winner. It's friendly enough to take your family or a group of friends, yet small and intimate enough for an inexpensive (but classy!) date. Complementary bruschetta and warm bread are a nice start to the meal. I've had most of the appetizers and they're all quite tasty, but the real stars of the menu are the pasta dishes. Margherita's penne vodka is hands-down the best in Hoboken and probably in the top three I've ever eaten. The most wonderful part? They give you so much food that you can have enough for a second meal.Look for outdoor seating when the weather warms up. Overall, a snappy casual kind of place that is perfect for pretty much everything.
2011-01-07,5,I've never been disappointed! I especially love their chicken dishes but the pasta is wonderful too. You can't beat the complimentary bruschetta & the BYOB. Seating is limited but it's worth it!
2010-12-31,5,Love their food!  Great Caesar salad too!
2010-12-19,4,Amazing, amazing, amazing. The pastas here are just fabulous and many are homemade- try the shrimp primavera or the cavatelli and broccoli. Zucchini sticks are really good- their preparation isn't just a big pile of fried garbage, but lots of big zucchini pieces. The veggie pizza is awesome, too. Atmosphere needs work- the tables are really uncomfortable and cramped, and there's zero at work in terms of decor, so go in the warmer weather and sit outside. Not a fancy place, and acoustics sort of suck, but for awesome Italian in Hoboken, you must come here.
2010-11-17,5,i have nothing bad to say about this place. the service is super friendly and overly attentive (which, ps.. is a good thing). the pizza was served hot and tasted delicious (margherita and juliana, two small pies for two people is plenty) and everytime a server walked by with an entree i drooled and thought about my next visit! it's BYO- another serious plus. but it gets super crowded. all the time. not sure if they take reservations but it's worth the wait, or going at odd eating hours. sidenote: need to go back to try everythingggg on the dessert menu!
2010-11-12,4,I brought my lovely friends here on the hottest afternoon in August - that day was also the day that they helped me move! It was hot and sticky outside and we needed a place that would serve us food and keep the water coming. Margherita's fit the bill!  The staff was friendly and we were immediately served water and when they saw how quickly we were drinking it they stayed on top of the situation without fail. While we waited for our individual pizzas, we were served bread with a lovely tomato-ey-mixture-of-goodness. The pizza was pretty good, but not what I would think of when I think of Hoboken pizza. They were small (personal pizzas, of course!) but the crust wasn't the best. Next time I come here, I'll probably opt for one of their pasta dishes and I'll bring a bottle of wine since it's BYOB!
2010-11-08,5,I love this place.  The food is unbelievable, its BYOB and they seat you quickly.  I normally get the Chicken Marsala or the Penne Ala Vodka.  Both are the best I've ever tasted.  The only issue is that they often close early so you gotta get there by 8:30 or so.  Bring a couple bottles of nice wine, split a pizza to start, go for the Marsala and thank me later.
2010-10-27,4,I love Margherita's. It's cheap, tasty and BYOB. Their seating has much to be desired for, as some tables are an ass on an ass, but all in all, a solid Italian restaurant that consistently delivers great food. Try the penne vodka, chicken sorrentino, shrimp cocktail, chicken penne arrabiata, linguine and clams; should I keep going? They take credit cards but not reservations. Bonuses: outdoor seating, daily specials, complementary bruschetta at every table and portions are ginormous; you'll be going home with lunch tomorrow!
2010-07-18,4,This is a go-to place for me and my girlfriend. The whole menu is pretty good and we love the byob aspect of this place. Service is good, ambiance is good, location is awesome, prices are great. We can split an appetizer and an entree with complimentary bruschetta and get out of there for under $28. ( we bring our own wine too ). Great place!
2010-06-14,1,SKIP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I ordered a pizza.... nasty dough tasting pizza (not brick oven, even though it might seem it would be)... There were plenty of Italian places with KILLER pizza in Hoboken, I almost shot my foot for choosing to order pizza hereStuffed Mushrooms and it was sooo nasty.We also ordered a pasta dish, it was OKAY... AFTER my mother put salt, hot sauce, pepper and anything else to make it flavorful...(disclaimer: my sister says I'm every chef's worst nightmare, I don't thinks so, I gave plenty of 3 and 4 stars!)
2010-05-30,2,If you have pizza in the title of your restaurant I expect it to be top notch ... The pizza here was no better then frozen pizza that u thaw out at home. I had the margherito pizza and the regular both were sorry examples of pizza. The only good part was the prosciutto on the margherito and the fact that I was able to bring my own wine. Even my 5 year old daughter didn't eat more than 1 slice and she's a pizza monster. If u go here don't order pizza order something else and hopefully that will be good.Also, I know this is not the fault of the restaurant, but there was a very loud graduation party there that made it almost impossible to talk to my family. Many guests complained but they did nothing..
2010-05-21,5,*WARNING* - It is a BYOB!!! You'll hate when you show up with no wine in hand, but once you replenish your supply you'll be right as rain. I was a culprit of that BYOB negligence, but solved it down the block at a liquor shop then rushed back to my table. Once I had my wine, I lingered over the fragrant and overly hospitable complimentary Brushetta as I ordered a fabulous Shrimp Fra Diavolo with a spicy marinara I have not tasted since Tucci Benuch in Minneapolis. The dishes were divine and the prices were very generous. I would greatly recommend this restaurant to any local of Hoboken.
2010-04-25,4,It's Spring and outdoor seating has returned! For Thur - Saturday night, if you want to sit right away, wear a track jacket or light sweater and take a table outside . . . Otherwise, you, like the schools of other mulling around Hobokeners last night, will have to wait.Food is fresh w/ very good ingredients, and bringing my own wine - even on a night I'm "taking it easy" - is excellente.
2010-03-29,3,* 3 1/2 * starsThe wait here can be pretty horrendous (especially on a Saturday night).  I've only had the penne ala vodka here and it's pretty good but not the best that I've had.  They also give you complementary bruschetta which is decent.  The biggest selling point is that it's a BYOB.
2010-02-26,2,Maybe I am spoiled with living right next to little Italy but this place was nothing to write home about and certainly not worth waiting 15 minutes for let alone an hour. I came here with a bunch of friends last weekend because it was the most central location between all of us. The service was rushed and not very friendly. They told us we had to leave at the end of our meal because they had other people waiting. With Pleasure lady!The food was mediocre at best. I had a pasta special and it was greasy and swimming in butter. The vodka rigatoni tasted like it was marinara sauce tossed with a little cheese. It was nasty and filled with salt from all the capers they threw in there.  Other dishes around the table, you could tell that it was mass produced and frozen previous to being on my plate.  Talk about overrated. I will not return.
2010-01-24,4,One of my favorite spots in Hoboken. It's a BYOB and there is no serving fee for your B. The food here is just excellent. We've had almost everything on their menu and have never been dissapointed. One of my favorite dishes here is the Margherita Pizza. They serve free bruschetta when you dine in and it really hits the spot while you wait for your food. We've also had take out from here several times and its just as good as eating there. The owners of this restaurant really pay attention to the quality of their ingredients (i think they make their own pasta) and it shows. I didn't give it 5 stars because in the summer and warmer nights, it's difficult to get a table and you really feel shoved into the restaurant if its cold out. You have to get there before it gets really busy but this is one of the best dinner spots in Hoboken so regardless of the night, it's never a guarantee if you'll be able to get a good table. Oh and parking SUCKS - but it's Hoboken, so what can you expect?
2009-08-05,5,BYOB, cheap, and you can sit outside. And if there's a wait and/or it's cold, you can head across the street without wondering when your table is going to come up. When you sit down, you are promptly served some amazing bruchetta on the house, and the corking fee for your wine from down the street? A big fat $0. But aside from all those great things, the standout here is the homemade pasta. Everytime I go to Hoboken, I ask - no, insist - that we go here for dinner one night. And I prepare all day by starving myself... ;) kidding. But go hungry.Oh. Get the penne vodka...gosh I have dreams about that shit.
2009-06-09,3,Fairly standard Italian restaurant, but not as fancy and high-strung (read: snobby and costly) as some of the other places.The pasta arrabiata was really good. Nice and spicy.Place is a bit tight.Good place to bring a date.
2009-05-04,3,There's the good and bad here at this little busy Italian spot on Washington Street.The good - a waiting system that includes little glowing boxes that let you walk up to a block away - although most people make it across the street to the 8th St Tavern to drink or just stand outside. BYO, uncorked for you if you bring wine. There's fresh bruschetta to snack on initially, then bread, and the fresh, homemade pastas and pizza.  Willing to substitute various meats for the missing sausage (see below). Service isn't bad, a small place, two waitstaff cover the room, basically. Nice chilled shrimp (8) on the shrimp cocktail (with an interesting orange version of cocktail sauce).The bad - it's crowded, and a tight, no-holds barred dive to the back of the room to get to the serving station where you can put your name down (they need a host station up front!) makes for poor logistics when it comes to walking around. Forget about large groups bigger than 6... you'll be hard-pressed to find space here for that. The bruschetta was watery, as was the fettuccine alfredo (in a soup, almost, of watery creamy sauce). No ice for the white wine we brought... hm.Neutral... lobster ravioli with pesto wasn't bad, and they were out of sausage (otherwise would've gotten then gnocchi special with sausage).Overall, not a bad place to grab a quick meal, although I have other favorite Italian places in the area.
2009-04-07,3,So I'd really like to give this place 5 stars because I thoroughly enjoyed the loud, fun, good looking scene this past Friday, and it's BYO, and there's outdoor seating in the summer.However...I'm 99% sure the vegetables I got with my dish were frozen.  That's just not gonna fly.That said, the pizza and pastas looked very good and my dish overall was good for the price (once I got over the initial WTF??).  The staff was very friendly and everyone seemed to pitch in to help everyone else's tables.I would definitely go back for the atmosphere, but next time I'll go with a pizza or pasta rather than something with a vegetable side.
2009-02-19,4,Margherita's is a small but nice italian restaurant and pizzeria. The pizzas are not by the slice, but rather personal pan size or regular pie size brick oven style. Nothing I've ever ordered there has been bad; from the smoked mozz pizza to the penne vodka, everything is delicious. Personal pizzas are about $8-9 , and the pasta was about $10 without chicken (with chicken was like $2 extra). not the cheapest option, but it's worth going around lunchtime in the spring or summer where you can sit outside and enjoy your meal. Really great
2008-09-07,4,I've been to Margherita's several times and it never fails to impress.  Delicious pastas, complimentary bruschetta when you sit down and BYO bottles-- how can you go wrong?  My favorite dish is the rigatoni and meat sauce (with a creamy-licious blob of ricotta plopped on top), but I've branched out and enjoyed other dishes as well.  The rigatoni in pesto cream sauce is decadent.  My friends also say that the pizza is delicious, but I've never tried it.The wait can be a bit long on weekends, but they'll give you a buzzer and you can go across the street to 8th St Tavern and have a beer while you wait for your table at Margherita's.  Once you sit down the food comes pretty quickly-- usually.  Last night we inexplicably waited for over 30 minutes and the restaurant wasn't even busy, but that's an anomaly in my experience.  Margherita's is definitely my favorite Italian spot in Hoboken!
2008-07-03,4,My wife and I had dinner at Margherita's on a Thursday night and both of us were very impressed.  We were able to sit outside on a nice summer evening and since it's BYO, we brought our own bottle of wine.  Before we ordered we were given hot, fresh bread and a sample bruschetta which was a nice touch.  We did have wait a bit before our order was taken, but we were in no rush so that was fine.  I had the shrimp fra diavolo and my wife had the penne ala vodka with salmon.  Both dishes were fantastic.  I happen to like spicy food, and the fra diavolo was very spicy.  The pasta was also very fresh.  While there are a number of very good Italian restaurants in Hoboken, Margherita's is worth trying.
2008-06-27,3,Margherita's can be hit or miss.  One night we went and our server was unhelpful and the food was cold.  But when we went the following month with my parents the food was great and our server was great.  I've always gotten the pizza which is really good.  Just be aware that it gets very, very noisy in there.  I also wouldn't recommend going with a large group on a weekend because it'll be hard to get a table and you probably won't be able to hear everyone you're with.  But if you don't like 'em that much then just order some pizza and enjoy!
2008-01-20,4,Margherita's happens to be one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken.  The small space is always packed from wall to wall.  The prices are very reasonable, and the BYOB situation makes it even better.  Some of the highlights are their homemade pastas and the delicious, garlicky sauces.  I am torn while ordering because the linguine with clam sauce, which has almost more clams than pasta, is hard for me to refuse.  If you want a solid, affordable, gut-busting meal, Margherita's will serve you just fine.
