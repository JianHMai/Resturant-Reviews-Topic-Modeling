2021-09-29,5,Old school, one of the best bakeries I have ever been to! The bread has an amazing flavor and is perfectly cooked with a great chewiness.
2021-08-28,5,I have been going this place for a while and by far they have the best baguette I ever had. My parents are visiting me from abroad and they also said this is the best so far.
2020-12-20,5,Best sfogliatella that I've ever had.  Crispy and flaky on the outside but perfectly moist and flavorful on the inside.  Ample powder sugar.  Also like the no nonsense style.  Looked like he was only selling 3 things (sfogliatella, bread, cold tomato pie).  Cash only (I don't recall there even being a register).  He packed the pastry in a pizza box.  And once again, it was the best sfogliatella that Ive ever had.
2020-08-16,1,I asked a local for the best Italian bread in Hoboken - this was one of the two places suggested. What a disappointment. I bought two loaves of bread, 'meat' bread and pizza. Picked up these items at 11:30am and served them at 1 and they were all stale.
2020-06-15,1,I went in there today and the staff were really rude for no reason. I wanted to go in and support a local business but I'd rather give my money to another ShopRite after that interaction.
2019-09-27,5,Nice traditional Italian place. Really like their cheeseless pizza. Great prices too.
2019-09-03,5,When you ship your bread to Sinatra you have good bread. Scratch that. Great bread. I've been living in California for 40 years and every time I fly back to NJ I buy a loaf of Doms bread and a lb of butter. I sit in my hotel room in the city and eat the whole loaf. Crazy Bernie May be from Bloomfield but my bread heart is in Hoboken
2019-05-23,4,Dom is awesome, I come around 6 AM during the week to get his awesome breads that are still piping hot. The only problem with coming so early is his pastries aren't available until around 8-10 :( , but at this time of day you can double park on the street without getting hassled as you'll be in and out of the store in under 5 minutes!
2019-04-07,5,A Hoboken institution!!!  Specializing in Bread with a few pastries.   The breads and focaccia are as good as it gets.  Our favorites are any bread and the tomato focaccia rounds which are basically a thick crust pizza without the cheese, take them home add your favorite mozzarella and toppings, bake and you have the best (semi)home made pizza ever!!!  Go early in the day, they don't bake an unlimited supply and when it's gone, it's gone!!!
2019-03-28,4,Come in early to town n needed to kill 1 hr I search for places and came here for coffee n light breakfast .... no were to sit . Great place to grab n go
2019-01-21,5,I ordered five medium loaves of bread for a family party. Everyone could not stop raving about the bread, and they were begging us to take some home with them. Not only is the bread good, but the people who own and run Dom's are so friendly and accommodating. They make all of their customers feel like family. I highly recommend this bakery for residents and outsiders of Hoboken!
2018-10-22,1,They have flies everywhere, food in the open, and don't wash their floors at all by the looks of it.
2018-09-30,5,One of the best kept secrets in Hoboken. This is throwback to the days before Hoboken was a one-stop-shop for all of your Acia Bowl and Pressed Juice needs. Go in before 8 and you'll find Dom behind the counter helping you. He's an older guy that's super friendly and knows everyone that walks in the door, evidenced by the variations of "Dom" everyone shouts as they go in to pick up their bread orders. The coal fired ovens in the back have been in use for 120 years and are a throw back to days before it was trendy to be gluten free.The sfogliatella (Sfoy-a-dell for those who neither grew up in North Jersey nor have an interest in the actual Italian pronunciation) are the first to go, so get there early. It took 4 trips before I was actually able to get my hands on one of these, and for good reason. They are easily some of the best I have ever had. In addition to various types (shapes, if we're being honest) of breads, you will find two sizes of tomato focaccia that are unbelievable.One morning, Dom and I were chatting and he asked if I wanted to see the oven. It's kind of crazy how large is is, probably 10ft deep and 20 ft wide inside. Friendly guy and I can only hope that Dom's continues on just as it was after Dom eventually retires. It would be truly tragic to lose another great Hoboken bakery to cater to the shallow wants and desires of pretentious paycheck-to-paycheck millennials that now comprise much of Hoboken.
2018-08-20,4,Brooklyn is known for its Italian delis, pork stores, and bakeries. It's also known for its sense of irony.  So I suppose it makes perfect sense that, pizza excepted, I almost never seek out Italian eats in BK. Instead, I head to Staten Island. I've even been known to go to the Bronx, though I draw the line at Little Italy in Manhattan.  As for Hoboken, I have made some half-hearted attempts to explore it over the years, but it's only now that I finally get it.  'Ole blue eyes, aka Frank Sinatra must have been in Italian food heaven living there back in the day:Anyway, I was charmed from the instant I set foot inside this bare bones throwback of a *mostly breads* bakeshop.  It didn't hurt that the counter guy, who I am guessing was the eponymous Dom himself, indulged hubby's penchant for engaging in joking banter with random people.  The two kidded back and forth while I settled on some goodies for us to try:Sfogliatelle:  We enjoyed this while sitting on a bench right outside the shop, flaky, crisp shards of pastry and snowy powdered sugar, raining down upon us with each delicious bite.  The custard cream-like filling, which hinted of lemon, had firmed up maybe a tad too much, but it was still pretty darn irresistible.Tomato Focaccia:  I heated this in the oven back at home, and it was beautiful in its simplicity, boasting the sort of light, airy crust you want to keep eating.  Even if you don't especially like crust.Sausage Stuffed Bread: This was lurking in the depths of our freezer for awhile, and I almost wish I'd forgotten all about it.  It barely contained any sausage and was so disappointing it brought down my initial 5-star plus raves.As we were leaving, I caught a glimpse of the ancient looking brick oven that churns out all these treats. Man...  How this bakery continues to fly below Yelp's radar, while countless stupefyingly mediocre places rack up four and five star reviews is beyond me.:(
2018-04-16,5,Wow! The bread is perfection and the pastries are the best we've ever had. Thank you!!!
2018-01-20,5,Been going to Dom's for years and it is indeed the best around. I'd never had the sfogliatelle though, why, I don't know. Holy hell is it delicious, and trust me, I've had some good sfogliatelle in my day. This is one of those places that I hope will last forever. A gem.
2018-01-05,5,Great italian bread made in an old wood fire oven. The first time we walk-in the shop the owner took us into the back to show us the operation. Hasn't changed in years. Still made the old way. They make sfogliatelli only a few days a week and you better get there early while they are still warm. The are the best I ever had. Definitely worth the time to Hoboken.
2017-10-03,5,Don't let the grouchy cashier lady scare you away. The bread is phenomenal and worth the trip to Hoboken. I recommend the baguette and the tomato focaccia!
2017-10-03,5,This is what I've been looking for! I can't eat cheese so all the pizzerias in the area were making me envious. This place sells tomato focaccia (tomato pie) and it is delicious- 2 slices for 2.50 make an excellent, affordable lunch :)
2017-08-18,5,Great traditional Italian bakery and the last one in Hoboken, where so many flourished in the past.  Grand St. Bakery, Marie's, Antique Bakery are all gone now, but Dom's is still here and still great!Dominic and his family and longtime helper are at the counter or in the back.  There is a great array of fresh, craft Italian breads in all shapes & sizes, focaccia, sfogliadelle (pastry breads, GREAT!), stuffed breads and much more.  Lived here 40 years and still haven't tried everything.You won't be disappointed and I hope the young folks always appreciate a non-fancy, great craft bakery with the lifetime of skill and comittment it takes to make great breads.The picture of the soot-marked, ancient brick oven should say it all.  But in case it doesn't convey what is waiting at Dom's, that's a classic oven you're looking at and it's the last one in Hoboken.Thanks Dom!
2017-02-02,5,I'm ashamed to admit, I live 3 blocks down and only now made it to Dom's. The bakery and Dom himself is virtually a Hoboken institution. Dom tells me proudly that he has been a Hoboken resident for the last 62 years! Wow. I decided to try everything in sight - the tomato focaccia was outstanding. The sauce unlike any other I've had in Hoboken so far... tangy, fresh and with the perfect amount of zing. I also had the pleasure of getting a sfogliadelle, a shell shaped flaky Italian pastry brushed with sugar. This was absolutely delectable - while the crust is flaky, the filling is sweet cream, not too sweet, but just perfect so you don't end up feeling too guilty. I could have easily eaten at least two-three of them at one go! In the end, I also got a fresh baguette and went back home and had it with butter and tea. This type of bread makes life feel so good. Really. Everything I had was so inexpensive and so delicious - proving once again that life's simple pleasures don't have to cost an arm and a leg. Dom's is a highly accomplished baker... testimony to the fact that he supplies the bread to most of Hoboken's Italian delis. I also peaked into his giant old-school oven - unlike no other I bet. He starts baking at 9pm every night and is done by dawn. Go check out Dom's if you haven't and make it a regular feature in your life - I certainly intend to.
2017-01-16,5,The bread is fantastic. But the sfogliadelle is so amazing. Best I have ever had. We go to the Bronx usually for them, we just saved 15 dollars in tolls because these by far are the best I have ever had.
2017-01-09,5,This place is so amazing! The variety of bread is huge. I was visiting my friend in Hoboken and she'd never had bread from here before. We picked up some loaves and even though I was only in town for the weekend, they were gone so quickly that we contemplated going back for more. My favorite was an herbed bread that I of course can't remember, but it was so delicious with olive oil and salt! And the bread is so inexpensive, too! I am going to make sure to stop by Dom's every time that I am in town.
2016-12-30,5,The gold standard.  One of the reasons I live in Hoboken is because this place is about 20% of my annual caloric intake.  First timers should ask for the small baguette and if they have it the foccacia square. Graduate to the garlic breadsticks and sfogliatelle. For sandwich bread make sure you specify to slice the loaf.If you dont see it they dont have it that day and they dont take any bullshit.  Also dont show up on a Holy Day looking for bread unless you pre-order.  Cash only and would it hurt you to bring a few singles because they dont have change if you try to pay with a $20.  None of these issues comes close to changing my 5 star rating.
2016-08-13,5,If you want the best Italian bread, home-made pizza, then this is the place to go.  Friendly service and great bread. What else could you ask for!
2016-07-22,5,Ive only had two loaves (in two days mind you), and i cant get enough. Its the italian equivalent of finding the perfect baguette. No pretensions, no frills but awesome execution and skill in this little place.
2015-12-29,5,Dom's is as good as it gets.  This bread has no equal.  Texture and taste collide in a symphony of carbo-delight.   Sure you can eat it with things - like unbeatable mutz from Fiore's around the corner - but the beauty of this bread is it can also fly solo.  Did I say fly? I mean soar!  Long may Dom bake.Just so I'm clear and you're not confused - I like this bread...a LOT.
2015-01-31,5,If Dom's weren't around, I perhaps would move. Its presence is a large reason I love living here as it represents what Hoboken was and what Hoboken is. Dom's is named after Dom, a warm older Italian man who has been running this place for at least 40y and when he isn't there, often Esther is in his place, a warm Puerto Rican woman who grew up in Hoboken, during a time when Hoboken was even more family oriented: she tells me that back then, if you had to run an errand, the neighborhood block would watch your kid.  At Dom's, they make a handful of breads (different size rolls) foccacia (the best you will ever eat), a few freshly baked incredible Italian pastries and Wow! You will keep coming for more. On the weekends I sometimes do my morning 'rounds', which I cherish, which includes Dom's for bread and foccacia and Fiore's nearby for mutz (and if it is a special occasion like a bday or guest, will include Carlos' lobster tails). Dom is a kind, generous spirited baker with much pride in his bread and in its crust. He gave me a tour of his magnificent oven. He is perhaps the only person I know for whom 'byob' refers to 'bring your own bread' which he told me he sometimes does as his standards are quite high for bread. Looking forward to my morning rounds there tomorrow morning! We usually get rolls and a sliced sourdough, foccacia. You cannot go wrong.
2015-01-21,5,Just had the tomato pie. With out a doubt one if the best things  I've ever eaten. If you've never had it stopping at Dom's is a must. It's the best
2014-03-26,5,Tomato Pie is all you need to know. My partner is a vegan and this is the only thing that satisfies her craving for pizza. Quite frankly, I can give up pizza in exchange for their tomato pie. Be sure to get the full tray, only $24, because one slice is surely not enough. Don't be deterred by the looks of this place, for me it definitely adds to the charm of the bread.  Cash Only
2014-03-03,5,best foccocia ive ever eaten in my life.italian bread is delicious
2014-01-21,5,Not a long review- this bread is the best around.  I always forget to stop by and pick some up- but every week we eat out and invariably that rest. is serving Dom's bread with the meal.  So...I eat this bread every week.Love it with cold butter...and homemade pasta!
2013-07-13,5,Not a huge selection, but what they've got is delicious.  I love the old classic feel of this place.  Not even close to fancy, but this place just gives you that feeling that they've been here forever, not because of their selection, or because of some amazing business smarts by the owners, but simply because make good bread!
2013-02-08,4,This is a wildly old school bakery with just a few choices, all great: italian long loaves, round loaves and occasionally Sicilian pizza. When you walk in you'll think you're in someone's kitchen! Low prices and great bread keep us coming back.My kids insist on stopping for a fresh loaf at Dom's on our way to the city via Hoboken. It usually is gone before we hit the PATH lol.    When we got all food geeky and asked to see the oven in back they were completely gracious about it, let us admire the ancient setup.Sfogliatelle every Sunday morning. Amazingly crispy, flaky thousand-layer pastry shell around sweet cream with bits of candied lemon, dusted in powdered sugar, don't miss these! Check out the picture. Cash only, as it should be!
2011-11-29,5,In Hoboken you have two bakeries putting out arguably the best bread.My personal favorite is Dom's.Dom's estimates they bake about 1,000 loaves a day, which the they sell in the store and deliver to such Hoboken eateries as, Dino & Harry's, Luca Brasi's Deli, Fran's Deli, Vito's and more. The best sandwich is made on the best bread, so it's no surprise everyone goes to Dom's. There is nothing better than coal oven baked goods.Beyond your standard baguette, they also sell onion and olive loaves, several different varieties of my favorite focaccia (tomato sauce, cherry tomatoes, olives), garlic bread sticks, and many more varieties of coal oven baked goods. Depending on the day and the time, what you get to choose from might be different. They sell out almost everyday so if you have a order you need filled, call ahead and place it a day or two before. That way you guarantee they won't sell the last one before you get there.This is one of the places on the Hoboken food tour, so don't miss out on what everyone else already knows. They have been featured in Esquire, The NY Times, NY Serious Eats, & NJ.comesquire.com/blogs/food-f...nytimes.com/2003/04/13/n...newyork.seriouseats.com/...nj.com/entertainment/jjo...nj.com/hobokennow/index....
2011-06-24,5,This is hands down best loaf of Italian bread in Hudson County.  I have been coming here with my grandfather since I am a child and the place reminds me of him and old hoboken :). I get two small loaves.  I think the smaller dimensions makes for a crispier crust and fluffier inside (for some reason). The inside is not bulky but airy. The selection is limited and they only have certain things on certain days but the staples are always there (long Italian bread, panelle, focaccia, etc). Antique is a close second
2009-03-11,4,Tried the tomato focaccia today - amazing!  Can't wait to go back and try another one of their breads.  Definitely a hole-in-the-wall, but I LOVE hole-in-the-walls!  Highly recommended, go check it out.
2008-02-14,5,Pardon my language:  This place is a sh*thole.But it doesn't matter one damn bit, because at Dom's, their mission is to make amazing bread.  When the bread is this good, who cares about how pretty the place is?  There is not a huge selection of breads here - maybe 5 or 6 types, in addition to a wonderful tomato focaccia.   They know what they do best and they've stuck to it for years. Take a look in the back at the missive old brick oven and you'll quickly understand why bread like this can never be replicated.If your timing is right and you get a loaf right out of the oven, you might as well just jump into the Hudson, because nothing is going to get much better than ripping off a hot, steamy piece.Other random fact:  Many of the local deli's use Dom's bread, which is part of the reason, as a whole, Hoboken has the best Italian sandwiches of any single town in the tri-state area.
