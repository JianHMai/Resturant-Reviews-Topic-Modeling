2020-03-06,5,I just wanted to post my beautiful gelati. Cherry and mango Italian ice and vanilla custard.. I know it's mouth watering.
2019-10-07,1,Man they've really let this location go.Broken window out front. No chocolate custard because "the machine is broken".  That's one of your two main flavors! All this could have been a complete coincidence, and them just having an awful day but then I look through Yelp and see another review cite the same two issues, over a week ago!  You couldn't fix one of these two giant problems in a full week?! (And that's assuming best case scenario for the shop, it was likely longer). That says a lot.  If ownership doesn't care why should customers?
2019-09-29,1,Rita's is famous for their custard. Yet each time I come here, they only have Vanilla. Windows are cracked. Place is run down and degenerate looking. Sad but true. Yuck.
2019-08-04,1,We got the wrong order the last 3 TIMES! Their phone number has been disconnected for a couple years now, so incorrect orders are never corrected. Turn your phone service back on, are you serious??!
2019-07-08,3,Five stars for great selection of frozen desserts. We had a lemon geloti. One star for rude cashier. It was like she was waiting to get her nails done. She appeared bored and uninterested in helping us.
2019-06-09,4,As a Jersey girl, I've always loved Rita's! This location is great, located on bustling Washington Street. Classic, delicious Italian ices for a decent price too. I love the Mango italian ice topped with some whipped cream. Absolutely delicious!
2019-04-05,5,LOVE Rita's!! The staff is friendly and remembers our order when we stop in. I love it! The soft serve ice cream is perfect. I love all of the flavors of Italian ice here too. We frequent here. Glad it's open again! First day they opened for the season, they were giving a free Italian ice out! Price isn't bad; $5.47 for the cone and soft serve. Worth it!
2019-03-26,5,Growing up in Philadelphia, the area where Rita's was founded, I used to love going to Rita's during the summer. Naturally when I stumbled upon this Rita's in Hoboken, I was pleasantly surprised. My goto in the cherry ice and vanilla custard Gelati. If you haven't tried it, I highly recommend! So good : ) One of my favorite desserts!
2018-09-05,4,This was my first time in life trying Rita's, and I had heard great things about the chain. I ordered the strawberry watermelon ice and it was super refreshing. It's a little sweeter than the things I would normally care to eat but the flavor was good overall. My BF ordered the custard. It was also my first time trying any custard. It's too thick for my preference (and I know it's meant to be), but I mixed some custard with a bite of my ice and actually really enjoyed it. Apparently, there's a menu item that I missed that's Italian ice with a dollop of custard so I'll make sure I get that next time. Not sure if their Italian ice flavors rotate, but I hope so. Would love to see different flavors on there since strawberry watermelon was the only one that caught my eye.
2018-08-21,5,Timeless and classic Rita's. Best water ice in Hoboken. Ambiance: Small, in and out type of place.  The order: I personally love the cotton candy ice, but s'mores is hella good too. Taste: Very sugary so gotta keep that in mind and only get a small but it's great. Service: The service was good. Very quick, very nice people. Overall: Not reinventing the wheel, know what you're getting yourself into, but fantastic regardless.
2018-07-29,3,Not too many flavors offered. But if you come back you can request a flavor. The guy taking our order on Saturday night seemed rude. He didn't want to be there was sitting down the whole time on his phone until we finally decided on what he wanted. Then got annoyed that more people were coming in. Customer service wasn't thay great
2018-07-20,4,Great little spot for Italian ice. I have three kids and each wants something different, so it's nice and convenient this it's directly across the street from Coldstone. My eldest gets Rita's and my 2nd daughter gets Cold Stone. The baby...she's happy to get either.I like that this is always made fresh daily. I like that there is actual fruit in the Italian ice. Overall, a fantastic treat during the Summer. It's a bit cramped in here as it is almost literally a hole in the wall but there are nice little benches to sit on outside.
2018-06-23,1,Rude cashier .  Looking at her iwatch while I wait to pay for my ice. Then when I say Hello she stares at me and says nothing. Looking annoyed as if I just disturbed her. It's Sat at 7pm and she said she was the manager. After I gave her a speech on her behavior apologized ..but why do I have to explain that to the manager ?
2018-05-07,1,Love Rita's but am disgusted with Hoboken's customer service on this evening. I ordered via UberEats at 9:15pm and was rejected at 9:34pm. When I went to reorder UberEats indicated that they were no longer available as they closed for the evening..... but it wasn't even 10pm in which is the advertise store closing hours. I attempted to call and inquire as to why I was denied but didn't get an answer.  I will not be ordering from this location anymore.
2018-04-14,4,Ambience. CService. AFood. APrice. AA local chain around northeast area. Stand outside and que a line to place order and receive product. Line goes pretty quick. The Swedish fish tastes like Swedish fish!I tried the flight of 4 flavors. It's equivalent to getting a large. $3.60. I'm a fan of the Splenda tangerine, mango and lemon ice!  Delish!I was not too thrilled with the cookie dough ice. UghOverall nice family or date night ice cream getaway.
2017-07-09,5,I've always wanted to try out Rita's, but since I'm in located in NYC, the trip to the Coney Island location is a long one, and this located is far closer.  (Oxymoron there.) Located on the hustle-and-bustle of Washington Street, is this cute little shop that serves refreshing goodies and Italian ice. This was my first time here, so I settled for the basic strawberry/cherry Italian ice with vanilla custard. The vanilla custard which tasted like ice cream (if it wasn't) and it complemented my Italian ice well. Everything was refreshing for a summer night and was perfectly sweetened. The store employees were nice and I received my order in a matter of seconds. Overall, I really enjoyed my first experience here and I'll definitely be back in the near future! Kinda wished they had more NYC locations though.
2017-07-03,5,Honestly, a great ice cream visit every time I go! My ultimate favorite treat would be the orange ice with the vanilla custard. If you love a creamsicle you will love this! I have tried all of the custard and each one is amazing. Super sweet and tastes just right. I have been to Rita's in NJ and Allentown and both experiences tasted exactly the same. The service is fast which always makes my experience great.The price is perfect for what you are getting. Every dollar is worth that sweet treat!
2017-06-12,5,AH-MAY-ZING! My boyfriend takes me here alll the time ! & I love it . This is deff my go to spot ! You will not regret not even one cent if you come here !!
2017-06-04,4,Tried the 4 flavored Italian ice samples and liked that I got to choose so many at one time. You can ask to try a couple of flavors and then order your favs. Lemon, cherry, mango, passion fruit were my fav 4!  The raspberry and suger-free tangerine weren't as good and lacked the sweet component. The line is kinda slow and that was annoying.
2017-05-22,4,Rita's is by far the best frozen custard and Italian ice, and you can get the two together! Lemon is so refreshing but you can get samples.The young girl behind the counter was sweet and patient event though she was working solo and there was a line of patiently waiting people.
2017-02-15,4,I live in JC but originally from PA so I was super excited when I saw a Rita's in Hoboken.  I was in Hoboken to grab a bite and randomly pasted Rita's and I had to stop in for my favorite dessert.  This place reminds me of a small little pop up shop right in the heart of Hoboken.  The staff was super friendly and quick to take your order.  The only negative aspect to my visit is that they didn't have chocolate water ice, which I thought "every" location had regardless of the day.  Apparently they have different flavors everyday.  Anyway, I still enjoyed it and will be returning as soon as I can.
2017-02-13,5,Love this place!  Wishing they were open in the winter.  I know it's cold, but still fun to go.  I am glad they have the smaller sizes for kids. Some Ritas don't and I end up having to buy a giant one which is annoying.
2017-01-15,4,Ritas is a staple of every jersey kids upbringing. I had never heard of it before my NJ friends.I love they variety they offer. You can mix and match flavors and custard with ice. There's a little for everyone. My favorite combo so far has been cheesecake and pineapple. I don't remember which was the custard and which was the ice but it tasted like a cold pineapple cheesecake.I'll definitely be coming back to mix up some more flavors and to get my new favorite.
2016-08-28,4,When I visited Hoboken, NJ, I was hoping to stop by the Ice Hut.  Sadly, that wonderful purveyor of frozen treats is gone.  Feeling dejected, but needing a cool ice fix, I saw Rita's and decided to give it a try.  It was a great call.I had hoped to have the orange/vanilla swirl from Ice Hut.  Rita's gave me more of a choice.  Looking at the flavors, I decided to go with a blood orange Italian ice topped with cheesecake ice cream.Personally, I love mixing the smoothness of ice cream with the tartness of ice (One of my favorite combos is chocolate ice cream with raspberry sorbet).  Rita's blood orange/cheesecake combo didn't disappoint.  The blood orange ice had a wonderful rich flavor which mixed perfectly with the cheesecake ice cream.  It was basically a creamsicle with a cheesecake twist.The service was very good.  There was only one woman working there at the time, but she was quick and friendly.The place is small.  There is some sitting in front, but when I was there (around 2-ish), there was no shade.  Instead I took a walk to the Hudson River, which was pleasant.So, while I was disappointed at the loss of my old haunt, Rita's Italian Ice did more than drown my sorrow.  I hope to stop by again when I am in Hoboken.
2016-08-16,5,Favorite frozen custard spot in the New Jersey - New York City area. This place has just about everything you want and lacks all the things you don't. The small shop is a take out with no seating for a crowd. It helps keep the space open and clean. The service is really good here with workers making treats at a quick pace and willing to help without starting a ten minute conversation on what you might like.I asked for custard, any flavor, their choice. The worker said ok and walked away to make a black cherry gelati with custard at the bottom and top. Very delicious, easily beats most because of the unique combination. The custard alone is the best I've had. Much thicker and creamier than what you'll get at any chain custard spot. The gelati is very fruity (even had little pieces of cherry skin in it). Would make a trip for this place if in the mood. The park near by is also nice to hang around in while eating. Would recommend for groups (because ice cream always tastes better with friends).
2016-07-28,4,What's not to like?  Custard. Gelato. Spoon. 'Nuf said!We were looking for a treat to cool down on a hot summer evening, and this place certainly hit the spot.  I chose a simple mix of vanilla custard and wild black cherry gelato in their Gelati Mix.  It went down smooth and was very refreshing.  Was hoping they had orange flavored gelato so I could have a Creamsicle, but it was not to be.Guess I'll just have to come back!!!
2016-07-27,4,The Quick: Why aren't there more Rita's in NYC? get the gelati with water ice- I recommend mango. You won't be disappointed!
2016-05-04,5,Love Rita's!  I don't see how anyone can not love it.  The gelati is the best - a dollop of frozen custard on top, huge layer of Italian ice, and more yummy frozen custard on the bottom.  As for all their items, you can choose any mix and match of flavors you like.  Service is always courteous, and I often see the owner himself taking orders.  I only wish they were up uptown so I could have Rita's more often.
2015-09-27,4,Their Blendini which is a mix of ice, soft serve and nilla wafers was one of a kind dessert i ever had. It tasted great and the crunchiness added by wafers was unique. I got a small size blendini which three of us shared and felt very content. It is a must try if you are craving something sweet while strolling in hoboken!
2015-09-06,4,Custard! You could never go wrong with custard especially if it's coming from Rita's! In the event that you are looking for some yummy savory ice cream then Rita's is your place with it's soft churned whipped frozen swirl. The quality serves it's purpose and Rita has won the hearts of many custard fans. Coming from Florida I was crazy excited that this ice cream place has made itself to the lovely block of Washington St. in Hoboken. Rita is always a hit and will leave plenty of smiles with it's delicious creamy taste.
2015-08-17,3,Got the custard - aka soft serve. Pretty good - but only vanilla and chocolate. That said we got the swirl - it hit the spot.
2015-05-29,2,They recently changed owners and evidently the cherry Italian ice recipe. This tastes watered down and overpriced. I used to love coming here but not anymore. Very disappointed in the flavor.
2015-05-15,3,Cute location! Like some people said some of the flavors are a little bland but other than that it's pretty good.
2014-09-28,5,Never disappointed.  Oh and did I mention they DELIVER.  I love them.  Such a great staff too.  The only " bad" thing is that it's so good you might eat it too fast and you will actually lower your core temperature.  This has actually happened to me lol.  Worth it though.
2014-07-17,4,We visited the Rita's after dinner in one of the restaurants around. It was almost 11 in the night. But still, the staff there was cherrful and helpful and amazing. They also gave samples to try, which actually were big enough to fill our  sweet cravings :-)We tried the frozen custards here as ice is not our cup of tea. The only issue I have is limited flavors of the custard. Though they taste good but I seriously yearn for some more variety to visit them again.
2014-06-09,5,The italian ices are the best in the area.We love italian ices and rita's has the best flavors and are not overly sweet. Excellent. Plus the service is great.
2014-05-26,4,I ordered a cherry Italian ice and had a some of my friend's vanilla custard, which was pretty good. I expected the Italian ice to be very sweet, but it wasn't.
2014-04-06,5,Rita's makes some amazing Italian ice and frozen custard. Apparently they're a sizeable chain but I've never come across one before. The service was great and they take credit cards. I can't wait to go back to try some of their creative concoctions that combine ice and custard in one treat which sounds iffy but everyone seems to love it. This time around I just got a simple medium custard on a cone with sprinkles (about $5) which definitely hit the spot.
2013-09-12,5,This review is for all the Rita's in the world in terms of flavors. Flawless. I wish this place was open in the winter as well just for the cravers of this delicious Italian ice. It hits the spot during those hot summer days. It's like they used 5 star quality ice and mixed in 5 star quality ingredients to make the variety of flavors they offer.My favorite is the Mango with the Vanilla frozen custard. When I first had this concoction for the first time I was intrigued that oh its only ice with soft serve ice cream. First bite together I was like damn I need to share this place everyone who I care about. Then I was sad for a minute because I thought there was no more soft serve until I saw there was more on the bottom and I was like"What!! Say What!! This place is Dope!!" So as a result I bring everyone I know who doesn't live in Jersey to this spot because it's more amazing than Carlo's bakery. I also have tried the bubble gum, strawberry starburst, cherry, Swedish fish, and root beer. They are consistent every time I come back to try it again. Rita's 4 Life!
2013-09-03,5,I had Rita's twice in one day within 4 hours...smh that's how bomb it is!Coming from Seattle, we have NOTHING like this so when I heard about this frozen custard, italian ice creation I had to try it! The gelati is something amazing man...for real...lol...perfect on a hot ass day!Now I get SMH (shake my head) at the fact that Seattle ain't got nothing similar to this or even close and I have to wait to go out of state again to have it...womp womp womp
2013-06-24,3,I love to come here on the first day of spring because they give away free Rita's. In real life though, I feel like I'd much rather get frozen yogurt or ice cream as their ices are super sweet the flavors aren't that exciting.
2013-04-01,4,First, I'd like to start off by saying that this place is pretty small. So, I wouldn't recommend this place for large groups. However, if you are planning on basically going in and out after your order, this is the place for you. Secondly, the quality of the italian ice is pretty good. Growing up in Queens, and having lived in Corona (the land of italian ices in NYC), that is saying something. Third, I would like to say that the workers were very friendly. Keep in mind, that this place only opened about 2-3 weeks ago, so this may change as their customer volume increases. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place for people with a sweet tooth in Hoboken, NJ.
2013-03-27,4,Amaazing water ice & frozen custard.I love rita's water ice is fricken delicious. I love it.This place is pretty small & clean. The people here are super nice. They give you samples so you can try.No matter how many times I come here it will always get a 5 star !
2013-01-08,4,Listen: Swedish Fish flavored Italian Ice.That is ALL you EVER need to know about this delicious place!Custards are creamy and sometimes, as rich as a meal in and of itself, so eat with a friend and enjoy this place in the heat of a summer trip to Jersey!
2012-07-30,5,Swedish Fish flavored water ice....Ah-mazing!!!
2012-07-03,3,As far as Italian Creme ice goes I've had way better. This was a quick stop on the way back to the NJ Transit. I got the Mint Chocolate chip which was ok...my wife got the cherry ice...sounds like we should have got the custard. Listen I'd rather go to Ralph's...and if I could Rispoli's. Sorry Rita's you were hyped up too much.
2012-05-19,5,When I think soft ice cream, I think frozen custard. When I think frozen custard - I think Rita's.Don't know what frozen custard is? Well, it's soft ice cream for the laymen. Basically way back when on Coney Island, New York, they discovered that ice cream melted too fast, but by adding egg yolk into the ice cream mixture - viola! It doesn't melt as fast, and tastes just as good, and is even denser than regular ice cream.History lesson aside, I love Rita's. I often stop here walking my dog, and they offer me a "pup cup", which is an ounce frozen custard with a dog treat! Who does that in Hoboken?! My dog literally will steer me directly off the sidewalk and into the store because he knows that's where the treats are. Plus I love the fact that I can walk into the store with my dog, and he doesn't have to wait outside.The owners of this Rita's franchise also work at their store. They are very hands-on, and make sure that their employees are really friendly and top-notch with service. The price target here is reasonable, and I love this place. Best in Hoboken for ice cream.
2012-04-29,4,The plain custard is worth trying.  You're taking a huge gamble experimenting with other items on the menu.
2012-04-10,4,UPDATE:  This Rita's location is now piloting a new low-fat vanilla to replace the fat-free vanilla they had before.  The little extra added fat adds a TON of flavor, so now I'm going there even more than before.  Which I think contradicts the whole reason WHY I get the low-fat version to begin with... No one ever said being an ice cream addict was easy!!!
2012-01-22,4,Sometimes I like to try to explain why water-ice is so magical and special, but my West Coasties just don't get it. I don't care. I love Rita's. Have you heard of the people that map out Wal-Mart stores across the country and travel according to where the Wal-Mart leads them? That's me, only with Rita's. If I see one, I stop and I get something. Mostly because we don't have them in California and they are just a little cup of awesome waiting for me to consume, and also because when it gets really hot and humid, Rita's makes it all better.
2011-10-25,4,You can take almost any combination to the face.  There are all sorts of custards to add to the ice.  A favorite flavored ice is Swedish fish (yes, like the candy!) and there are sugar-free options for those of you who don't need the sugar!  You can purchase by the gallon if you're interested, too.  They got rid of the stamp card, but it doesn't make it any less better.  Plus they give out PupCups for your dogs!
2011-10-18,4,After visiting Karma Kafe, Rita's was a really nice way to top of the meal! Cool and refreshing, this is water ice (they say) and boy, is it ever!  It's kind of slushy yet crumbly, a different consistency than an Italian ice or snow cone.You can mix the flavors together which will create different ones.  For example, chocolate ice and peanut butter ice equal Reese's.  They even had Oreo cookie as well as Mint Oreo cookie which my husband got---it was green and brown and I really don't think I could've eaten it based on looks alone.But the flavor that rocked my world was their Swedish Fish.  Yep, it's electric red and tastes EXACTLY like the candy!They also have custard, but bleccch, the thought of that doesn't do it for me. Open seasonally.  No restroom.  Outdoor seating.
2011-09-13,4,Very small Rita's location, but its clean & and I enjoyed getting my custard/gelati/italian ice fix.  I sampled the vanilla & strawberry custard (servers were really nice about giving samples too).  Order the vanilla custard - you cannot go wrong with that.  It's so thick, creamy & delicious, but in the best way possible.
2011-08-24,5,Loved the "Swedish Fish" flavored ice.Make room for this sweet treat.
2011-08-11,3,Our realtors love this lil spot with lots of ice on Washington Ave, especially on a hot summer's day! Rita's even has a cool feature (pun intended) where they'll text you the flavor of the day! They even give your doggie an ice cream cup made just for them! If you're in Hoboken, you have to make a stop at Rita's!
2011-07-28,5,The staff here are always friendly and they will pack you office sized party bucket Rita's to go. Perfect for a Friday afternoon soiree in summer. Coupons, punch cards, and flavor mixing all just add to the fun. I like to mix it up and try different things, plus Rita's will never break the bank, which is cool as ice.
2011-07-18,5,They let you mix flavors! Indecisive FTW.They also have this nifty feature where they text you when your favorite flavor is in for the day. Unfortunately, it just so happens that Green Apple is only available when I am not in Hoboken for the day. Boooooo.
2011-06-08,5,It's super cheap, staff are always helpful and friendly and I have a sick addiction to their blue raspberry or cherry misto shakes!If you happen to go by with your pooch, they give you the most adorable little pup cup with some custard in it and a doggy bone -- really cute touch.My little dog LOVES the place if she was on Yelp she would give it 5 stars :)
2011-06-06,5,Its not really summer until I get my Ritas, especially on Free Ice Day.  You can pick just about any flavor and you'll love it.  My favorite is the swedish fish.It would be one thing if the ice was great and that was that.  However, Rita's is constantly adding new flavors and offering different deals.  The Hoboken branch is on Facebook and picks fans for free ice periodically.  If you don't mind liking companies on Facebook, this is a good one to latch onto.  I'm just happy Rita's is within walking distance of my job!
2011-05-24,5,I grew to love Rita's during my undergraduate days in Pittsburgh, so I was so happy to see that there is one in little ol' Hoboken too.  Rita's is the same wherever you go, so wherever I go, it'll always be 5 stars in my heart!I used to love their italian ice - it's super delicious and it's not that expensive.  But I've grown to love something else there: frozen custard.  It's like creamy ice cream/sundaes.  I always get the half and half cup and finish the cup by the time I walk home!I used to get the custard/Italian ice combination, but I found it a little weird after I ate it a lot - I like to keep my custard and Italian Ice separate :)The nice thing about this Rita's is that there is somewhat of an interior, as in, you go through a door into their store to get stuff.  Some of the Rita's don't have a door for you to go through, and instead, just have a counter to walk up.  So in case of inclement weather and you are craving Rita's, well, you have a place to temporarily stay dry.
2010-09-03,4,Best snack place on hot days in Hoboken.  I cant get past the mint choc chip.  I could eat a gallon.
2010-09-02,4,What else can I say that hasn't been said before.  Seriously... the black cherry rocks!  Little cherry bits! Check!  Vanilla ice cream!  Check!  One reason to love Hoboken.  Why isn't this everywhere??
2010-08-23,4,Gelatini- what a great invention!  Bottom is Frozen Custard, middle is Italian Ice with excellent flavor, and top is more frozen custard.  It's a delicious frozen custard sandwich- yum.Also- staff are super friendly and let you try as much as you'd like!
2010-08-19,5,I'm hesitant to give it 5 stars, especially with only one visit (to this particular location), but it's deserved.Rita's is awesome. Cherry all the way! I love finding chunks of maraschino cherries in my ice. I've been to a few locations, and the quality is pretty standard, which is nice. I would give 4 stars based on the ice and custard alone.The extra star is for the customer service at the Rita's in Hoboken. The staff is so friendly! I had a conversation with them about... something random, I don't remember. I do remember that I was a happy camper when I left though. Great customer service never fails to make me smile.Also, you get 20% off if you show them your same-day receipt from any Hoboken restaurant - great way to save a few bucks on dessert!
2010-07-24,5,Although Rita's has been in town for a few years now, I never made it through the doors until Memorial Day weekend. The ices are delicious, the place is sparkly clean, and the workers are polite and not, to my knowledge, morons. (The same cannot be sad, sadly, for some of the other frozen treat purveyors in town.) The Misto shakes are a fabulous blend of ices and frozen custard. A great treat on a hot day.
2010-06-21,5,Rita's is my favorite summer treat. Currently, I am addicted to the Mango Peach Slenderita - combo of fat-free vanilla custard and sugar-free mango peach Italian ice. I suggest taking your purchase on a 3 block walk to the Pier and marvel at the New York City skyline. Absolutely divine.
2010-06-07,4,I like the Misto's here. A combination of your favorite Italian Ice and Frozen Custard blended into a cool, creamy, delicious customizable treat.The strawberry flavor is my go to gold. They don't always have it though, which is a let down on hot summer days.
2010-05-24,5,Their ice creams and italian ices, and what nots all sound good. I had a coconut cream italian ice. After one try I was sold on it. It was not icy like most italian ices. It was also packed with tons of flavor. My sister and I happened to stumble upon this place after lunch and leaving the packed line at Carlo's Bakery. We randomly walked in wanting some gelato or any cold treat on what was a nice day. This place has plenty of options.Oh man was that coconut cream italian ice the best I had. I would definitely go back any warm day, and I live in Brooklyn.
2010-05-20,5,Please tell me you're coming here to see the address, not to ask if you should go or not.  If you're asking, you must not have spent much time in Jersey during the summer or never got out.  If that's true, go there now, make sure to get some ice with custard, go for flavors that make sense and enjoy.  Yes, I said go now.  If it's between April and October, get up and go.  Now.  Don't worry about me, I'll wait...Have you gone yet?  You're lying, I can see you still sitting there.  Just go, don't be a punk....Good job, you got your Rita's on.  It's an institution for a reason you know.  The custard is killer, the cherry, Swedish Fish, Mango, and a bunch of other flavors are great.  If you get a weird flavor and it tastes weird, you have nobody to blame but yourself.  Be smart, get something tasty, and don't eat too fast else you'll get a wicked case of brain freeze.  Enjoy it during the summer because it's closed the rest of the year.
2010-02-20,4,I have Ritas all the time during the summer..there is one in Old Bridge where I used to live...The one in Hoboken is pretty much the same thing.  I love their cheese pretzels!  I usually get their misto shake! Its basically a gelato mixed with your favorite flavored italian ice.  I usually get a cherry misto shake..the best, and eat it with my cheese pretzel...the cheese is inside the pretzel.
2009-08-13,5,Came here after eating some overpriced sushi.  WoW! The ices were amazing.  I had a passionfruit ice and it tasted so good.  Best italian ice I've eaten.  And for the price, it is so worth it.  A big cup of delicious ice is what everyone needs on a hot day.
2009-06-03,5,Love love love frozen custard and love Rita's! Really good stuff. And the fat free flavor doesn't leave you feeling cheated, which is saying something.
2009-05-11,4,Coming from New England, I'd never heard of Rita's until I started working in Hoboken.  The entire office is a big fan of Two-Stamp Tuesdays.  :)
2009-04-27,4,Mmmmmm.  Perfect on a hot night!  I was walking back from the Path dreading my ride back to Manhattan when I came across Rita's and thought this will definitely make my awful Path trip more enjoyable.  I felt a bit rushed when I was ordering so I just quickly chose but my chocolate mint was really delicious.  Lots of little chocolate chips and nice mint flavor.  Totally refreshing and yummy.  There were also some guidos sitting outside - if that doesn't make for a better evening I don't know what does.
2009-03-23,4,Nice and tasty -- and on my walk home. They give free cups away on the first day of spring. Try it then, you cheap bastards.I had the coconut cream. It was dreamy. Like a pina colada without the rum.
2008-10-15,5,Although I enjoy a good froyo now and then, I generally skip out on the heavier frozen treats like ben & jerry's and it's-its. But when I first tried Hoboken's finest frozen custard and Italian ices, it was dessert love at first taste. I've since downgraded to the fat free vanilla custard, which is every bit as frozen custardy as the real stuff, and I'll usually go crazy with some caramel topping or chocolate sprinkles. Celebrate the seasons with their ever-changing Italian ice menu -- mix some pumpkin pie ice with the custard, and who needs Thanksgiving? And don't forget your frequent buyer's card on Two Stamp Tuesdays!
2008-10-06,5,This is the best Italian water ice I have ever eaten, and I've eaten just about every one I lay my eyes on! It actually have chunks of fruit in it. Years ago, it seems they slightly changed the recipe and maybe cut some corners by scaling back the fruit chunks. I was so upset I stopped going. But it looks like they went back to their original recipe and there are plenty of fruit chunks in their ices. Plus, now they have new things like wafers and other things they put in their custard. My husband likes the misto shake. I like their gelato and ices combo.
2008-09-29,4,Who doesn't like a gelato? Tell me and I'll shoot them ;) Rita's is a Jersey staple... we're lucky it's in Hoboken!
2008-07-24,5,I was driving through Hoboken when my friend suggested i try Rita's. He suggested the gelato but when I walked in I noticed the frozen custards on the menu.I decided on the coffee flavor on a waffle cone,mmmmmmmm. Creamy and rich, the  sweet coffee flavor hit the spot on this hot day.
2008-07-07,5,The Rita's chain offers a terrific variety of Italian ices, both cream and dairy-free.  They also offer several options for mix-ins, shakes, etc.  They also offer a few sugar-free ice flavors.  Discounts include a frequent buyer card offering a discount after several purchases, 15% off if you show a dinner receipt from a neighborhood restaurant (and are there for dessert), and local coupons.  Cone and cup sizes range from kiddie to large.This particular location often has a line out the door.  There is very little room to stand within the shop, but they have a small bench outside offering some seating.  I have only tried the Cookies N' Cream, Sugar-Free Pink Lemonade, and Sugar-Free Tangerine flavors, but I love them all!  The Cookies N' Cream variety is packed with Oreo chunks and the sugar-free types are very flavorful without the artificial sugar after-taste.  Rita's is delicious and really hits the spot on a warm day.
2008-05-26,4,I was a little confused when we initially walked by this place.  Was it an ice stand?  Was it a custard place?  Was it an ice cream joint?Kids, the answer is all of the above.  You can get any of the above at Rita's.  You can even get them blended together - their signature dish is a layer of custard, a layer of ice, and another layer of custard.  Italian Ice is an art form that has not made it to the midwest yet, so I was really excited to re-live a part of my youth.  The ice here did not disappoint - it was cool and light and yummy.  A nice alternative to the heavy Cold Stone across the street.
2008-04-05,5,I'm a sucker for a good Italian ice.  I admit it.  No other offering ruins my Yelp star curve like Italian ices.  Maybe it's b/c they are near impossible  to find in Manhattan.  Anyway, Rita's is a franchise that started out of Pennsylvania (ritasice.com/about.html) that makes a really good water ice.  Similar in consistency to a slushie.  I tried the mango and black cherry and both were great.  Loved the little chunks of cherry in the black cherry.  Not quite as great as Long Island-based Ralph's (yelp.com/biz/ralphs-famo...) but I'll be hitting this place whenever I'm in 'boken...
2007-08-28,5,So good. So freaking good. My nephew did a great job with his roller blading last night, so we were all treated to Rita's Italian Ice. I love that kid! They have lots of different, and unexpected flavors, including Mint Chocolate Chip, which my nephew absolutely loves. I got a Gelati which is italian ice and frozen custard together. Sounds weird, but it's fantabulous. The custard is all kinds of rich and the italian ice (wild black cherry in my case) compliments it perfectly. I told my nephew that he has to roller blade every night so we can go back Rita's.
2007-08-12,4,After a night of good food, my friends and I decided to stroll the streets of Hoboken to burn off the calories we consumed, when we passed Rita's and couldn't resist the temptation.  I got the coconut ice which was delish.  It brought back memories of my childhood when I enjoyed a cool coconut bar sold by the Mexican street vendors in California. How I miss the good ol' days.  The other flavors were good too (mango and black cherry).  So good, my friend was wearing it ( it was a hot night).  I can't wait to go back and try the other flavors.Update:Went back and tried the cookies and cream flavor.  Interesting to say the least.  Ummm...I don't think I'll be getting it next time.
2007-05-31,4,I'm afraid that I can only give it four stars. Granted, I was only there once and maybe I chose the wrong flavor that day (i had the cookies and cream) but I did not like it.But thats not to say that you should not come here. The people who work there are probably the most personable people that I have come across in a Hoboken business. They were so nice, very talkative and lively, and just all around good people. They'll give you coupons for a rainy day, meaning that if it rains on a particular day you can get a free ice cream, or is it a deeply discounted ice cream. But whatever, its still a great deal.I will be back, there's no doubt about that. And I know now NOT to get the cookies and cream. One of my fave Hoboken stores already.
2007-04-28,4,I went to college in St. Louis, where frozen custard isn't just a dessert or a snack.  It's a way of life.  The place that made frozen custard famous is Ted Drewes:teddrewes.com/Drewes.aspAnd so today, I was strolling through Hoboken, and I thought, "what's Rita's?  I've never been in there."  Even after looking at the menu on the wall, I still couldn't tell exactly what it was that Rita's served... ice cream?  Frozen yogurt?  Smoothies?  I wasn't sure.  So I figured I'd just order something to find out.  "I'll have a regular chocolate," I said.  "A regular chocolate what?" the kid behind the counter answered.  "Custard or ice?"Custard???  This is a frozen custard place?  I hadn't had frozen custard since 1989 (yes I'm really that old,) and I was delighted to find it was available out here.  I, of course, ordered the custard instead of the ice, (next time I'll go back to find out what the "ice" is,) and was ecstatic to find it tasted exactly the same as I remembered.
2007-04-05,5,If you're looking for a healthier alternative to Coldstone (which is right across the street) this is it.I love ice cream in almost any form and I'd seen something on the Food Network about this phenomenon called frozen custard, so I thought I'd give it a try.YUM.First, probably since the store was almost brand new, the employees could tell I'd never been there before.  After I'd stood and stared at the menu for two minutes, they offered to let me try things.  So then the tasting began.  I started with the italian ices.  The flavors change day to day, but that day I tried mango, mint and orange.  Then they suggested mixing the italian ice with the custard for what they call a gelati.  It's basically layers of each until you get about three inches above the cup.  When they mixed the orange italian ice with the vanilla custard I was in heaven.  It was a creamsicle!!!  My favorite ice cream truck popsicle as a kid were creamsicles.  After that I was done.  I walked out of the store with a big grin on my face and orange italian ice dripping down my chin.After that first visit, I started going regularly.  It's not just the custard and the italian ices that are great, the service is spectacular.  I'm always greeted with a smile and offered samples and suggestions.  And they're very patient with me when I take forever and day to decide what I want.  That alone gets 5 stars!
2006-10-05,4,They just opened their 400th store in Hoboken a few weeks ago.   My sister raved about this place when she lived in Pennsylvania, so the other night when I had a craving for ice cream and a coupon for Rita's, I tried it out.It was much better than I expected.  They have frozen custard (I call that soft ice cream) and Italian ice, and a combo of both.  I had the combo - vanilla ice cream and tangerine Italian ice.  Yummy!For a very thorough review from a real Rita's expert, check this out:philly2hoboken.com/blog/...
