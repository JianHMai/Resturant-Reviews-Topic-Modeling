2021-11-08,4,This place was great! Cool ambiance and amazing food. Service was really good too only mishap was charging our cards double but it go fixed. Would definitely recommend but make sure you has reservations in advance!
2021-11-06,5,AMAZING!!! love the atmosphere, cocktails and the food. ORDER THE HOT OIL SHRIMP- you will not be disappointed, I don't even like shrimp and this is one of the best things I've ever had. Waiter convinced us to order the wedge salad as well (not pictured), very good with homemade blue cheese dressing (if you're a blue cheese aficionado I highly recommend) I ordered the hanger steak with herb sauce and my boyfriend ordered the Branzino (not pictured) - both were amazing. I loved that the hanger steak came with a perfectly cooked bulb of roasted garlic. Herb sauce was good, but the hot oil sauce would have been better with the steak. We never order dessert usually, but the skillet cookie was too good to pass up. It was out of this world. Peanut butter chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream and hardened chocolate on top. We will be back! The craft cocktails and atmosphere alone are enough to visit antique bar and bakery!
2021-11-01,5,Best bread pudding ever!! Amazing service, hh deals, and stuffed eggplant parm bread. 10/10!!
2021-11-01,5,We live around the corner and are here frequently. Billy makes amazing drinks- try the mussels!! Sooooo good
2021-11-01,1,A few days after posting my initial review, I receive this disgusting message from the waiter Pedro. Real scumbag.
2021-10-27,5,Truly a Hoboken gem! Came here for my birthday with some friends after being recommended this place so many times. I thought to myself, how good can this place be?I was so wrong.Where do I start, the ambience, building itself, the oven, the food, the food, THE FOOD. Easily some of the best pasta I've had in the Tri-State, with very generous portion sizes. We ordered so many dishes for the table and not a single one disappointed. I had the mezzi rigatoni and the dish came out piping hot and delicious straight from the oven. The servers were very knowledgeable and were very communicative as the kitchen was very busy the night we came in.  My top recommendations are the macaroni & cheese, stuffed bread, and roast beets for a touch of sweetness. Will be coming again soon for sure!
2021-10-25,5,This place deserves my very first Hoboken review. First you are greeted by a friendly, laidback staff. The decor/theme is on point - giving vintage Hoboken, as if you are going to sit next to Sinatra himself at the bar. The drinks are strong but delicious, aromatic flavors. Next the food. Wow. Truly incredible dishes made with quality ingredients and a lot of love. The kitchen can be seen from your table - incredible touch to the vibe by the way. If you were considering coming here for drinks, lunch, dinner, really anything - my suggestion is to put your phone down now and run straight to the Antique Bar & Bakery.
2021-10-25,1,I live in Atlanta and have family, two being elderly, that live in Westwood NJ.  I saw an AB&B ad on FB and everything sounded delicious, so before my next visit to Westwood, I had decided I would order the dinner to be picked up and bring it back to Westwood to eat.  This would be the easiest thing to do considering the age of a couple of family members.  I arrived in Westwood on a Wednesday and we decided I would order the food on Sunday.  That Friday, I called the restaurant to get specifics about ordering because their website states several times that delivery and pick up orders are between 5pm-9pm.  I spoke to a very friendly female that said you can call and place your order before 5pm, but the order would not be sent to the kitchen until 5pm and should be ready for pickup around 5:20, so I told her I would call back around 4:30 Sunday.  Sunday afternoon, everyone looked at the online menu and decided what they wanted for dinner.  When I called on Sunday to place the order, around 4:20, I spoke to a young gentleman that was taking my order and stopped me to say I must have looked at the wrong menu on their website.  He explained what I needed to do to see current dinner selections that are available for pickup, so I told him I would call him back.  Our group reselected most of our choices and I called again at approximately 4:40.  This time, a female answered and said they don't take pickup orders and I needed to call a particular vender and they didn't take orders until 6pm.  This totally changed our dinner plans.  When you have two elderly family members that typically eat at 5pm and had made an exception to eat around 6:15, certainly were not going to wait to eat dinner around 7:00.  We had to totally change our plans and ordered from Andiamo's that delivered our food before 5:45.  AB&B needs to update their website for pickups because it's totally incorrect information and we wasted a lot of time.  I will not be trying AB&B again.
2021-10-20,5,Went on a Sunday night with a large group and had an amazing dinner. Everyone was very happy with their meal. Portions are good sized. Only complaint was the location of our table, which was back by the open kitchen and dishwashing area, but that's just the layout of the space. Servers and staff were super friendly and helpful. Can't wait to go back!
2021-10-12,5,I'm a long-time Hoboken resident and this was my first experience at Antique. Husband and I went for a date night, and BOY did it NOT disappoint! The food was OUT of this world, but the reason I'm here, writing a review, is because of our server Ian. I've never experienced such good service at any restaurant...ever. He was SO knowledgeable about all of the menu items, gave amazing recommendations and was overall so upbeat and friendly and perfectly attentive. I can't wait to go back..this place is unreal. Oh, and the ambiance inside is reallllyyy great too. Highly highly HIGHLY recommend!
2021-10-09,4,My first time trying bread pudding and it was amazing I can see why they're famous for it.the crispy outside and soft af inside - delicious. Also got the eggplant stuffed bread and that was sooo good not to mention so much bread for only $10!! Also victor our waiter was super friendly and loved havin him!
2021-08-31,5,Ooooh this place was so fun! The vibe is very moody with a bar and tables towards the back. I noticed a lot of people ordering martinis. You can this place is old school and a little swanky.They also have one of the biggest coal fired ovens in the country? Grateful for that oven because the bread coming out of there is amazing. I had a spritz and we shared the shrimp, spaghetti squash carbonara, crispy artichoke salad, and meatball. The spaghetti squash carbonara was unbelievably good (a must order). We had the rigatoni with n'duja cream and it was amazing, another must order. We also loved the hanger steak with herb sauce. And just do what you need to do to order the $20 bread pudding. I promise you be thankful that you did.
2021-08-31,2,Where do I begin...We were visiting relatives who were very excited about visiting this particular establishment. Let me start by saying that Victor-the server was very pleasant.However, he was waiting on all the outdoor tables alone!?!One of the orders arrived with no plates, utensils on table.It took a while before 2 bottles of warm water arrived on a hot summer day.EVENTUALLY, another order arrived.We reminded Victor a couple of times that 2 of our guests had been waiting for their food as well as a drink that had been ordered.Both times we were told he'd check on it. Who missed the ball?The remainder of the food took well over 45 minutes to arrive.Victor could have been a bit more diligent about checking in. However, how could he with such short staffing!?!Perhaps a manager could have been more visible/ available.We ordered the bread pudding with the original order, and that took FOREVER!!!We asked the bus boy for utensils, water and take out boxes. We were told that he could only get us water???!!!Can somebody give Victor a hand/ break?Eventually the bus boy did bring us forks-sheesh!The food was both a bit salty, spicy.We finally decided to pay the bill inside on our own.If not, we might've been there another hour or so.Get more help please!!!!!
2021-08-29,5,Went there for brunch this morning and it was fantastic. From the environment to the food, everything was top tier. We had the pancake, omelette and bread pudding and every dish came out better than we expected. We sat next to a good critic who was reviewing almost every dish on the menu and he was raving as well. Go! You won't be disappointed.
2021-08-26,4,Came just for drinks but eager to go back for dinner! Would never suspect such unique decor inside based on the plain outside. We sat at the bar and the bartender was great - offered suggestions and thoughts on the menu, even adjusted one of our cocktails a bit to be a new recipe he had been working on. Cocktails were delicious, staff was knowledgeable, and was happy to find a seat at the bar on a crowded night!
2021-08-22,5,One of my favorite restaurants!!!! Food, drinks, service, vibe = 6 stars!!! My bff was visiting from Puerto Rico (celebrating her bday) and I made sure to bring her to my favorite restaurant and let's just say, she was not offended or disappointed. Paige our server, was exceptional! Sweet, genuine, knowledgeable, and fun!! LOVE LOVE LOVE A B & B
2021-08-22,5,Enjoyed great company, great food, great service and great ambiance. The hustle and bustle comes alive in Antique B&B especially when you're seated towards the back. The swanky decor mixed with 60s music, and a touch of retro makes this establishment quite unique amongst the plethora of restaurants in Hoboken. Nestled in an 100+ year old bakery are chefs and waiters devoted to serving amazing food. Each meal is prepared with heart and grit, you can see it happening in the heat of fire blazing pans and dishes sitting waiting to be brought to tables full of hungry guests. We started with the hot oil shrimp and wedge salad. Both did not disappoint. The shrimp had the perfect amount of heat, oiled up, large and hearty in a bed of herbs and seasonings, and a half lemon for extra zest. The wedge salad was remarkably well prepared with homemade blue cheese. Crunchy and bursting with flavor.Next up, and as a Celiac, I appreciated my main course of the gluten free version of their chicken rigatoni. Just the right amount of creaminess given by the sauce without being too overwhelmingly heavy - I topped my plate with dashes of red pepper flakes, and would've cleaned it up, but wanted to enjoy it for Sunday lunch the next day. My husband ordered the hanger steak - medium, prepared with a hearty side of chimmichurri sauce to pour over the meat to your heart's content. A la carte, he fashioned for the Mexican cauliflower as his side accompaniment. Fabulous all the way.Drinks: Dr. Gonzo, and a cocktail I cannot remember the name of but was amazing (dark rum, pineapple, nutmeg). Incredible. We ended with espresso martinis for the hype/clout. I haven't had one in forever, and it was SO good. Cheers to the bartender. The meal from beginning to end was chef's kiss haha. We can't wait to return.P.s. Italian or Sicilian? Don't forget to grab the Perugia lemon and orange candies before heading out. They're located in a large glass door right between the bar and cafe area. I was so nostalgic - it was the perfect ending (little sweet treat).
2021-08-14,5,I returned this summer early evening for the Tuesday Beer & Burger special. You can't scream it's the best burger in town without me knowing about it. Answer? YES IT IS!!!!!! Holy WOW!!!!! Read my previous review here of how much I love this place and what I usually order from here as the menu items are awesome BUT This Burger RIGHT HERE?! Slap your grandma and the sip your beer that came with it. I won't even describe every component of it's glory because it was too gourmet-good and no ingredient should sway you to decide for yourself.  The fact that a burger got its own review from me says enough. Enjoy!
2021-08-06,1,Upd: besides that I got the comment under my review that they have been reaching me out SEVERAL TIMES and my drinks were comped. It's an absolute lie. The assistant manager texted me directly yes but not even apologizing offered a free dinner like this is a solution and I was looking forward for that. I am disappointed even more.
2021-08-04,5,Seriously, the food and drinks are phenomenal! The staff is knowledgeable and super friendly! The atmosphere is positive and refreshing. The French toast is literally a drooler! Be prepared to dance in your seat and secretly unbutton your jeans. I can't wait to go back!!!
2021-08-03,5,We ordered from here the other night and are freaking obsessed now. Their spaghetti squash carbonara is delicioussssss. Their chicken is amazing and so was the eggplant stuffed bread (HUGE) portion. The herb sauce was really great. It's almost like a creamier version of a chimichuri or something maybe parley like? Not an herb expert- just know it tasted great.
2021-07-31,5,Loved it! Surprisingly, they have quite a few vegan options all of which tasted amazing! The arugula salad was so fresh & the dressing was perfectly proportioned & soooo yummy. The staff was friendly, attentive & very knowledgeable. Annaliza was the best! She knew exactly how to make every dish vegan & double-checked to made sure every single item was prepared properly with the right modifications before it got to the table. I was extremely impressed with this place! 10/10 recommend
2021-07-29,1,Went recently this past Sunday for brunch, i have been wanting to try this place for years. We had a reservation for 2 at 1.30pm, it was not busy when we walked in but we got seated at this weird section in the corner out of sight from everyone with the weird A/C next to us. We waited for at least 15-20 mins but no one came to say hello or anything, i had to walk up to the front and asked if anyone knew we were sitting where we were because no one came, soon after i said something this waiter came and took our order which we ordered everything we wanted at once afraid that we wouldn't see him again which we were right!! No one came to check in on us at all nor refilling our water, once we finished our meal, i again had to walk up to the front/bar area to ask for our check. It was such a shame because we loved our food and drinks but service suck big time!! :'( With so many other places to go to around there, we shouldn't have to tolerate such bad service like we did. I guess i could say at least i tried this place once and never again!!
2021-07-25,1,We came to this place for our first time, is not what we expected there's no specials available to order, we felt unattended by our server, everything that we really wanted to try wasn't available it is not a la carte restaurant is just a ordinary bar with a bigger selection of food I wouldn't recommend it neither I'd come back in our experience is not even worth 1 star, food took forever to come, order got mixed up. If you just want to drink and snack it might be the place to go to but not if you'd like to have a Sunday dinner or a dinner date. BTW food was ok nothing to brag about this spot. Very disappointed!!
2021-07-24,5,Great Saturday brunch. Service was friendly & attentive. All of the food was amazing. Enjoyable unique cocktails. The appetizers were shared & were hot oil shrimp with dirty lemon & mushroom ragu rice balls. Both were full of flavor & amazing. Four of us each ordered something different & each entree was cooked perfectly & again full of flavor. We ordered the bone marrow French fries as a side. While they were delicious, we wished they had more of a bone marrow taste. We shared the bread pudding for dessert... AMAZING!
2021-07-12,4,I came on a Thursday at around 4:30pm for happy hour with a friend. The cocktails are decently strong and are only $10 for happy hour (usually $14). The All The Way tastes watered down, but I don't think it actually is (it could just use some more flavor). I can't remember the name of the second drink we got, but it was gin based and tasted very strongly of cinnamon. They do have some nice outdoor seating that we didn't sit at because it was raining.Antique Bar & Bakery was nice for drinks, and I look forward to going back and trying their food next time.
2021-07-07,5,Went for the first time last night and it was fantastic! We started with the mussels which were 10/10. The sauce was so amazing. I got the burger, which was also great!! So flavorful and the mushrooms and onions were yum. The fries were also great. Boyfriend got the chicken and loved it. We got a side of the mexican cauliflower which was great. Drinks were also so good!! Such a good spot and great service!
2021-07-03,5,Another great meal.!!! (Although no AC so it was hotter than hot) this time I brought my parents they felt right at home (they live in FL) lol anyways moving onto food! We started with prosciutto stuffed bread (delish) and the squash carbonara- honestly one of the best dishes to share! We then ordered mussels, the cavatelli/ricotta pasta, and the burger with French fries. So without including my thoughts on service/ambience/no ac- Its worth any hassle - the food is 5/5 every.single.time.  Also get the bread pudding. It's a must.
2021-07-02,5,Their drinks are phenomenal. We got the Johnny friendly, the blue eyed lady, and this really pretty one with gin.  Each one was better than the other. The apps are good and a little heavy. We go the ragu Risotto and the mutz special. Boy very flavorful but the mutz could have used more peaches- it was a lot of cheese (I love cheese but it was a lot of it!) The staff was awesome too - super friendly and really easy going.
2021-06-24,5,Popped in here for dinner on a friend's recommendation and I'm thrilled I did. I had the fish of the day "dorado", asparagus, and artichokes. All were EXCELLENT. But by far the best part of the evening was Analisa, the assistant manager. In addition to being an absolute delight, she was so accommodating. She even gave us recommendations for future meals during our stay. Foods great, service is even better!
2021-05-29,4,I been wanting to try Antique for a long time now and the food did not disappoint. The ambience and decor was unique inside. It was very loud so hard it was a little hard to here my date in there. The food was 5 stars. We had the mussels, hot oil shrimp, arugula salad and split a burger with fries. So much food but everything was delicious We had the hot cookie skillet for dessert and definitely did not need it but it was amazing Service was not that great. Table and plates could have been cleared faster and server could have been more attentive I would definitely go back here. A few other things I want to try that i bet are great
2021-05-24,5,I just can't say enough things about our wonderful experience hosting a bridal shower at Antique Loft -- catered by Antique Bar & Bakery! Kelli, Sara and everyone on site was absolutely fantastic, the food was delicious and everything was absolutely beautiful. Everyone there was gushing about the space and the service and it was just a perfect day!
2021-05-24,3,I have had such an interesting relationship with Antique Bar & Bakery ever since we moved to the Hoboken area, let me tell you. You know when you can't decide if you want to swipe right on someone but they keep popping up as options for you in your area? You always wonder, but you just can't bring yourself to give the person a shot. (I imagine this is what it's like on the apps. Unfortunately I was in a relationship when they became a fad so I really just make up my own stories about them.) Anyway, I never could bring myself to make a reservation at this place.Friends of ours suggested from their experience, it was overpriced. But I loved the story behind the place - and especially how they pivoted during COVID for takeout. Right before leaving the Hoboken area, we came for my birthday. It was an easy walk from the apartment so we figured, why not?One thing to know: this food is HEAVY. Even the salad is drenched in cheese and a thick dressing. I'm making the transition to veganism which basically means eating entirely plant based during the week and potentially indulging (is that the right word to use when you're doing something you don't believe in? Not really...) in some cheese or seafood so as not to be difficult at a restaurant on a special occasion. We decided to get the mushroom balls as an app and a vegan bottle of wine. The wine was truly great and I'm not disappointed in it. Our server was attentive and encouraged us to order the bread pudding every time he visited the table, despite him all-knowing that judging by our order, we were going to have to run home to the bathroom. Future Husband got the burger and I ordered the cheese plate with a bit of lettuce. (Ok, it was the baby kale salad with pecorino but less salad, more cheese.) we got a side of cauliflower, which was my favorite part of the meal. I indulged in THE ENTIRE SIDE DISH that was, too, drenched in "Mexican cheese." I had to keep taking fries from Future Husband's plate to break up my bites and cleanse the palate with some salt, if you will.This is all to say that the food WAS very good, but we couldn't bear to order the bread pudding, and I'm sure that would have made the meal even more delicious.... And thick.Yes, the bill was expensive but this is a sort of Hoboken establishment - Sinatra used to get his bread at this bakery - so remember that. I just think they can go lighter on the cheese. I did make it home in time, but let's just say my body had QUESTIONS. Like, "what happened to the fake plant based cheeze with a z? Let's stick to that Sar."
2021-05-23,5,Went here for dinner on Friday night and loved it! We didn't make a reservation ahead of time but were lucky that there was one table outside that was available. The food was fantastic - we got mussels to share and then I got the rigatoni and my friend got the rib eye burger. Would definitely recommend!
2021-05-22,5,Living in Hoboken for a year, I usually walk down Washington, however, decided to change it up and passed this spot. Walking pass, the food looked amazing and knew I had to try it out. This place is super popular and I actually had to make a reservation a week in advance! When arriving the atmosphere was amazing and the waitress was super friendly explaining everything on the menu. We ended up ordering the hot oil shrimp, the mussels, the artichoke salad, the mac and cheese, the lasagna edges and the famous bread pudding. We had drinks too but forgot the names (they're STRONG!). Everything was amazing but the stand outs for me definitely was the artichoke salad and the bread pudding. Simply amazing food. Will be returning for sure.
2021-05-21,5,I had so many different people recommending this place for its delicious food and great ambiance. It definitely lived up to the expectation!! Ryan, our server, made sure to explain the menu thoroughly with all of his favorites as well as crowd pleasers and talked to us as if we are friends. Drinks were unique and tasty. We over indulged in food with the spaghetti squash carbonara and meatball appetizer and our own entrees of the lasagna edges and burger. All of which were huge portions and amazing!! The real star of the dinner was the bread pudding that came out the size of my head and was so delicious that i am already thinking of the next time i want to eat it!!! Would absolutely come back with friends or family. Environment is great with awesome music and fun people! Definitely a must go!
2021-05-20,5,Ohmygoodness. I have found my new favorite restaurant in Hoboken. With "city vibes" and a menu the rivals some of the spots in the Big Apple, Antique Bar and Bakery is by far the front runner in the square mile. The shrimp, mussels, rice balls, and artichoke salad are all upscaled versions of classics -- but you won't be able to stop eating them. Talk about umami--the chefs here have figured out the perfect pairings of salty, spicy, and creamy sauces. The drinks are incredible and Dan the bartender was such a pro -- walking us through different mixology and drinks until we got exactly what we wanted. That is an experience you don't typically get in Hoboken. Sean our server actually sat with us to go through the menu and walk through his favorites! Such incredible service. The whole staff made it such a fun night for my girlfriends and me. We were blown away by the food and ambiance -- sitting in the "kitchen" so we could see out food being prepared. I cannot wait to get back and now it makes so much sense why it's difficult to get a reservation here! And ANTHONY !!! Omg he was the best.
2021-05-13,5,This our second time here. Both times our experience has been fantastic. The drinks are exceptional with quality ingredients and balanced flavors. This visit we came with another couple and ordered many appetizers. Each was on point and flavorful. Shrimp, Mussels, Mozzarella, Cauliflower, meatball, rice balls, and an Arugula salad. Each dish had a unique quality, from the pesto sauce for the mussels, to the spicy cauliflower this is a must place. Oh, and the staff is attentive and helpful.
2021-05-10,5,Antique Bar & Bakery seriously lived up to the hype, I'm already dying to go back! I visited a few weeks ago for dinner and was so impressed with the food. They have a nice range of healthy and splurge-worthy options. I actually decided to make a reservation here because my mom is gluten free, and she was so happy to see all of their GF options. The spaghetti squash carbonara is so delicious, you forget you're eating squash and not pasta! It's an appetizer but you could definitely eat it as an entree, it's so filling. I also tried the crispy artichoke salad, and all I can say is WOW. The dressing is creamy and flavorful without being too heavy, and the artichokes were perfectly crispy. My fiancé doesn't even like artichokes normally and he thought it was delicious too!One small note - it's very dark in the restaurant and the menu print is tiny, so bring your glasses/prepare to use your phone flashlight to read it!
2021-05-09,2,Do not order the Pork belly BLT - it was just pure fat and no pork. So not pleasant and the tomato hard as a rock. I only wish the chef has to eat this for his next meal
2021-05-09,1,Wanted to try and enjoy this place but the service was so bad we left :/    15 dollars for a "glass" of wine aka this is a shot glass-- Enjoy a drop my friend.   Out of all beers....lol
2021-05-02,4,Enjoyed my first dining experience here. Had been here before just for drinks pre-covid.  Was hard to get a reservation for Saturday night but set an alert on Resy and was able to score an 8:15 for 3.  Has a cool ambiance inside. We had a high top table in the back area near the kitchen so we could watch everything being prepared which was cool. They have as many tables as I would have expected preCovid so not really sure if they are following indoorCapacity rules. They don't have a big wine list, but they have someInteresting cocktails. I had the All the Way which was good and not too sweet.  Since we all had never been before, we tried a lot of different dishes.  For our starter course, we shared the mushroom ragu rice balls (4 in an order), a stuffed bread with eggplant and the burnt lasagna edges.  All three dishes were good.  For our mains, I was very bummed they didn't have the priest stranglers dish available. They also didn't really have any specials which is strange for a weekend.  I tried the cavatelli with meatballs which was good but I was pretty full and didn't have much of it. My friend had the Mac & cheese. I tried it and it was a very good classic Mac & cheese; breadcrumbs on top were very good. My other friend had the spaghetti squash carbonara dish with a poached egg on top. None of us particularly liked that dish.  She also had the artichoke salad which is basically a Cesar salad with artichoke in it. We were all so full and had tons of leftovers. We decided to get the bread pudding to go since so many people post about it. It didn't have the same raised top like it does if you have it dining in, but it was still pretty good with the caramel sauce On top. Overall we had a good time; service was good. I'd come back to try other things like the pasta dish I didn't get to have.
2021-04-28,5,I love this place, inventive menu, consistently great food. Delicious. They have a great "tapas" style menu or you can order as normal. Champagne & Wine menu could be a bit more extensive, but overall great. My new go to.
2021-04-25,5,Came here on a Sunday night and it was still pretty busy! The ambiance of the restaurant literally transports you out of downtown Hoboken and into a trendy and fun ambiance.We ended up skipping drinks for tonight but the menu looked like it had good options.For appetizers, we got the mushroom ragu rice balls and they were absolutely delicious! Would definitely recommend to anybody looking for a decadent appetizer.For entrees, I got the squid ink pasta special and it was pretty good. My friends got the artichoke salad and the lasagna edges and they tasted really good too!Lastly, we got the bread pudding and it was SO GOOD. I've never had anything like this before! The outside was crispy and the bread inside was so soft. They put a caramel/cinnamon syrup on top and it was just delicious.Overall, I'm really happy with my experience here. Definitely recommend to anybody looking for a great time with great food in downtown Hoboken.
2021-04-08,5,This place is a gem! Had the best bartenders/waitresses take care of us...amazing cocktails and the food is excellent...must have the bread pudding for dessert!
2021-04-02,2,Definitely more than 50% capacity, which immediately made me uncomfortable. Hard to enjoy your meal when you're thinking you might catch Covid any second. We had a table along the side that is closer to the front. Don't see how more tables could be fitted along there, so that section is running at close to 100% capacity. Don't get me wrong, food was great, server and other staff friendly and efficient. Host not welcoming though, which was enough to put me off going back. Sure, we arrived late for our reservation. But still, could show some professionalism.Oh, and the server didn't mention the dessert would take 20 minutes to be served, which should be standard info for people ordering the baked cookie.
2021-03-29,5,Amazing experience! Pedro was the best waiter and we felt taken care of the entire time. His class and professionalism paired greatly with his Witt and ability to make us feel welcome. 10/10- excellent service!
2021-03-23,5,Such a vibe and probably the best mussels I've ever had. The cocktails are unique and delicious. The wait staff is very knowledgeable and passionate about their work.
2021-03-22,5,My boyfriend and I were starving and couldn't decide on where to get some food. Hoboken has a ton of options and we were overwhelmed until we saw a photo of the bread pudding on Google. WE. WERE. SOLD. The atmosphere here is awesome. Lively and unique with the decor and lighting setting the mood. The real star? THE FOOD. Oh my god. This place is mind blowing . We had the following:(cocktails)All the way Johnny Friendly (Appetizer)Plantain N'duja croquettes (Entrees)Mac & CheeseHard Herb Sirloin (Dessert)Antique breading pudding I'll let the photos and videos speak for themselves. Loved the open kitchen layout, the lively atmosphere and even the menu was laid out as a tv script! I will be visiting again.
2021-03-19,4,Love the aesthetics. Great date night. A bit of an intimate setting. Food was terrific!! We had the Rice Balls as appetizer and the mussels as my entree. Mussels were under appetizers but good for an entree, as well. The pesto and fresh bread to pair made everything. I mean it is a bakery...it'd be a tragedy if their bread wasn't good My friend had the chicken and at Antique you can make an appetizer as a side. He enjoyed the meat balls and mentioned their sauce was perfect. A MUSTTTT have is the pudding. Due to covid there is a time limit so make sure to be on time and have your whole party there. Went on a Thursday with 5:30PM reservation and by the time we left dining was at capacity. I wish I can remember our waiter and hostess' name. If you were working Thurs. 03/18/21....you were great && your suggestions were appreciated!!!
2021-03-12,5,Antique is the best. Went last night for a girls night with my sister. Our server Ryan was incredible. He made our night 1000x more fun. The service, atmosphere, and food at Antique are above and beyond! Such a special place to have here in Hoboken.
2021-03-10,4,Ordered for pickup online through their website. An estimate was given for a range of time the food would be ready for pickup but I wish that there was an actual notification sent when it was ready since there is no other way to track the order progress. I ordered the Steak Pizzaiola Sandwich, lasagna edges and two stuffed breads (Eggplant parm bread, Antique Stuffed Prosciutto Bread). The steak pizzaiola sandwich was just ok. The steak is cooked medium rare so just be aware of that if you don't like your steak cooked rare. It was a bit chewy and I did not love the large amount of parsley piled on top. The lasagna edges on the other hand were delicious. The pasta is served with cheesy bread which was great to soak up the sauce. I did find a whole raw clove of garlic in the pasta which was sort of strange? The stuffed breads were a hit. I might come back and just order a few of these breads. The eggplant parm bread was great after slicing and heating in the oven. Probably my favorite item!overall, skip the sandwiches, try the breads.
2021-03-06,1,DOUBLE CHECK YOUR BILL - I have gone here two times within the last 6 months and on both occasions items that we order never come out but still show up on the bill. Also, we arrived on time and still had to stand and wait 30 mins until a table became available. The host didn't care at all
2021-02-23,5,If you're looking for an evening of fun outside the city, hop on over to Hoboken and head to Antique Bar & Bakery - a hole in the wall bar and restaurant that used to be a bakery. In fact, they still use the coal oven in the wall to prepare most of their magical meals. The oven itself is sort of scary and looks like the entrance to hell or Freddy Krueger's hideaway. But I digress. It's a small, narrow joint, a lively and loud place as they crank great music and stay open late. So if you're looking for a quiet, romantic dinner, keep looking (:  They have great drinks and amazing appetizers, steaks, burgers, pasta and more! We shared the stuffed breads and rice balls... and perhaps a few other starters. Then I sealed the deal with the Cavateli w/ crumbled meatballs and ricotta which was magnificently mouth-watering. I look forward to going back!
2021-02-22,5,One of my favorites in Hoboken! Fantastic food, drinks, service and atmosphere. The spaghetti squash carbonara, antique meatball, broccoli rabe, and bread pudding were all amazing! Definitely will be coming back soon.
2021-01-26,5,I had been to Antique Bar & Bakery several times over the past few years for dinners, brunches, and even solely for drinks.  However, I recently visited just to pick up an order for takeout.  The front counter was buried in a disorganized array of to-go bags, but the staff made sure to carefully double-check that all orders were complete before letting them out the door.  My brother had previously placed and paid for the order, so I just had to grab my food and go, but I decided to add a bottled cocktail into the mix.  I looked at the beverage menu and spotted one of my favorites, which was called My Fate.  It was priced at $14 on the list, but when I went to pay, I was told the drink would actually cost me $23; apparently, the price on the cocktail menu was for a dine-in, 8 ounce pour, rather than the 20 ounce flask portion I was getting.  I was a bit flustered by the price discrepancy, but purchased it anyway.When I got back with the bag, we plated the food and poured ourselves a glass of the drink, which included reposado tequila, blood orange, cucumber, lime, and simple anise.  It was a refreshing and potent blend of smokey, tart, and sweet flavors.  From a food perspective, we had ordered a random mix of appetizers, sides, and an entree.  The Hot Oil Shrimp had been cooked with the heads on, which allowed the shellfish to maintain its tenderness and left the heads full of succulent juices to either pour on a slice of toast or drip right into your mouth.  The Sweet Potato Hummus was topped with a dollop of herbaceous thyme tahini and a drizzle of jazzy chili oil.  The creamy, plant-based spread was served with a slice of toasted baguette.  The Cavatelli with Crumbled Meatballs was heavenly!  The pasta was cooked al dente and had been tossed with big chunks of flavorful meatballs in a rich tomato sauce infused with creamy ricotta cheese.  It was definitely an elevated take on traditional spaghetti and meatballs.  Lastly, the side of Spicy Brussel Sprouts had been perfectly browned in a peppery marinade.  The sprouts should have come with crispy bacon, though we opted to leave that out, and we actually did not miss it.Though I loved the classy, retro atmosphere of Antique Bar & Bakery, I was thrilled to have still enjoyed their delicious cuisine in a more isolated spot.  I suppose you can take the food out of the restaurant, but you (thankfully) cannot take the flavor out of the food!
2021-01-23,1,This restaurant sat me and my pregnant wife at a high top in the middle of the entryway while there are TONS OF OPEN TABLES. They will cry the social distancing card but it is poor customer service. Then within 10 seconds of sitting down the waiter comes over and says sternly that we have exactly one hour to eat and he will be back in a minute to take our full order. Last time I checked when you spend $200 on dinner the restaurant showed respect to its customers. I understand small business are struggling and I am a small business owner myself. With that said, you have to respect your customers who pay high prices for a quality experience. Very disappointing.
2021-01-18,4,So glad i decided to get some takeout from Antique Bar and Bakery. Ordering was easy through their website and delivery was quick - even on a Friday night! The chicken sandwich was really good, and i LOVED the mac and cheese (but it was a very small portion for the price). The sweet potato side was also super yummy. Looking forward to trying some more things on the menu in the future.
2021-01-05,5,We are absolutely obsessed with this place. By far the most amazing meal I have had in Hoboken. Everything was cooked fresh and to perfection. It's amazing because everything is cooked homemade and to the order as well. We sat in the bar area so we could see our food being prepared from the open kitchen which is so cool! This is definitely a place you bring people if you want to wow them with a great vibe and amazing food!! Our waitress was also amazing!! So attentive and made the dining experience wonderful! If you go here you need to get the dessert it is big enough to feed the whole table and drool worthy
2020-12-22,5,This place was seriously some of the best food I ever have. The ambiance is great, with gun decorations and a great music selection. A great place for a date, to bring family, or just a fun dinner. The food was to die for!
2020-12-13,3,Our waiter was great, but very disappointed to see one of the workers in the open kitchen blatantly not wearing a mask during peak COVID (Dec 2020). He had a bandana around his neck that wasn't covering his face the entire time we were there, and we were seated inches from the kitchen. Overall not impressed with the food especially for the high prices. The pumpkin rice balls were very bland and has some weird nuts in them. The burger and spaghetti squash carbonara were pretty good but everything is overpriced. Its a nice atmosphere (if you're not seated inches from the kitchen) but we will not be returning.
2020-12-06,3,After watching the "NJ Restaurant Hunter" and since we love steaks, we made reservations. The place is relatively small and due to the pandemic with very limited seating. We were first sat by the main oven and were directly underneath the air conditioner (it's Winter and temperature was 37 degrees). After asking for another table, we're quickly moved to another less breezy spot. We did not other appetizers because we had planned to order the DIRTY RIB-EYEBone to bone cut, 30-day dry-aged, 2 lb.+ at $125 with a side order of barbecue sauce, Brussels sprouts, and chimichuri potatoes.  We were aware that there's a wait for the order to be served, so we asked for drinks while waiting.  The servers are inattentive. The food came, and the steak was medium rare (as ordered) but very fatty.  It's not really sensational as represented in the program.   We won't return because we know of much better steak places in NYC and NY.
2020-12-02,5,Since I've checked in here so many times on Yelp let me just update my review. I actually was anticipating this places return during the pandemic. It came back better than ever. The menu has more variety on it than before. It's the uniqueness and freshness of the food for me. Whatever magic they work In that massive old oven back there has me coming back for more. In my endeavors I've had a half roasted acorn squash that was dug out, mashed and fondued up with cheese, large meatball with ricotta, pumpkin rice balls which are amazing and half of organic chicken. One of my favorites is the spaghetti squash carbonara. It has pancetta and fried hard boiled egg. I have never had a bad meal. The drinks are always on point. I live for a good Manhattan and their "a stones throw from Manhattan " drink is perfection. I do wish their wine list was a little longer as I enjoy some res wine. Lastly, I don't do dessert but I manage to have it here every time ! The bread pudding is so fluffy and moist.. it's not too sweet and large enough for 2-3 people. The chocolate chip cookie is is massive. It's warm, soft, and literally the best cookie I've had. It has vanilla ice cream on top as well. Antique is one of my favorite spots I hope it survives the pandemic as it is a tight space.
2020-11-24,5,My first and my last food experience in Hoboken. I love their down to earth attitude to food. Nothing too fancy but at the same time some crazy artisanal showpieces that leave ALL Hoboken's Italian restaurants wishing they had thought of that. Wine and liquor selection is limited but you won't find their selections anywhere else. Service is family-level, they really want you to enjoy it. Loved it, love it and will love it.
2020-10-05,5,Very happy that Antique is now back after shutting down temporarily for COVID.  Food and specials are still excellent!  We went at 6:30PM on Friday and just made it before the rush. One of the best restaurants in Hoboken!
2020-09-27,5,Amazing food and cocktails. 100% recommend their stuffed bread, mussels and garlic shrimp.
2020-09-25,4,I absolutely love this place. We called and asked if they were taking reservations. They said for parties of 6 or more only. We said we had a party of 6 and made one. When we showed up, the manager said we don't take reservations. Just wow. Unfortunately our excitement was met with disappointment. I understand these are extreme times. We will definitely be back because this place is just so damn good and we've nothing but excellence here prior to this.
2020-09-24,5,Antique Bar & Bakery is a staple of Hoboken. A must when visiting and a regular visit as a resident. I absolutely love it here. From the fresh squeezed juices in their craft cocktails to the eclectic menu chef Paul created. This is a place you want to impress your date/group of friends with. The cocktail menu- one is better than the next. By far, the best I've ever had. They even have to go cocktails during the pandemic.The food- you taste every ingredient that's carefully chosen for these dishes. So many options for specialty diets and they're very accommodating if you make them aware. As for Covid- I saw on Instagram that they SCRUB the place down. The bathrooms have disinfectant spray and wipes for your use. They added a new walk up window, so you can fill out your order on your one time use menu and bring it up to place your order or pick up your to-go order from the window. Overall- antique bar and bakery is the place to be. With the history, amazing food& drinks, & fun staff, you're guaranteed to have a memorable night each time you go. We'll be back very shortly!
2020-09-15,5,One of my foodie connects told me to put this place high on my list but I couldn't find it! This is one of those places that you would never expect to be fine dining but then you get your first course and you're immediately blown away.I'm convinced everything they serve is made fresh and in-house! Their vibe is dope and the service was excellent.
2020-09-05,5,I ordered delivery from antique yesterday and, while I wasn't crazy about every dish I ordered, I was SO obsessed with a few of the dishes, that I still have to give them 5 stars.Alright here was the worst part: we ordered the chicken family dinner, which was listed as coming with the arugula salad (one of my absolute favorite antique dishes with the most delicious almond puree) and it showed up with a very lackluster kale salad instead, so that was highly disappointing.Here were the fine/good parts:The lasagna edges, smashed potatoes, and zucchini. All perfectly fine but not something I would seek out to have again. I also thought the bread pudding was just good/fine but I must disclaim I'm not really a bread pudding person-- my bread pudding loving partner thought it was great.And here were the parts that blew my socks off and still have my mouth watering just thinking about:The chicken. Holy chicken. I quite literally have never had better chicken in my life. This is why I'm still giving 5 stars because the chicken is worth like 100 stars. GET THE CHICKEN. Get 2 of them. You will not regret it. I know chicken doesn't sound that exciting but trust me on this.The garlic bread with some delicious pesto-looking spread. Crusty, salty, delicious. Couldn't get enough.The vegetable soup!? Who gets excited about vegetable soup? I certainly wasn't but was shocked by how tasty this was. Made me forget how mad I was about my missing arugula salad. And I can hold a grudge, so you know that means some damn good soup. The cocktail! I got the all the way and mmmm it was divine. Definitely weak- didn't even feel tipsy after but I wasn't mad about it because it was so yummy.Will definitely be ordering again. Really appreciate the family meal options which make antique more affordable and not just a special occasion place.
2020-08-22,5,Is this place reopening? I miss the Cobb-goblin and the $30 mac and cheese that's called lasagna for some bizarre reason.
2020-06-29,4,Dinner and drinks are good but would not suggest for brunch. We asked for toast and got a hallowed out baguette. Service is good but would avoid for brunch.
2020-05-29,5,This review is long overdue, but I don't know where to start, because I'm too busy salivating over the thought of my next Antique meal. My bf and I have been going to Antique since they converted to a restaurant, and continue to consider it our favorite since. To say neither brunch nor dinner disappoint, is an understatement. I've tried to skip the "main course" several times to make sure I can fully immerse myself in their desserts (because trust me, you want to), only to fail miserably once the delicious aromas seduce me into ordering appetizer, mail course AND dessert. I suggest you keep your stretchy Thanksgiving pants handy for meals here.That's the other great thing about Antique--you could wear your stretch pants here because the place is unpresumptuous and cozy, as if you were laying on the couch in your living room, enjoying a sinful meal with no judgement. The music is straight out of the real MTV days, and though hard to hear sometimes, nice to catch a note of in the background to add to your comfort vibe.Full disclosure, in the very beginning, we had one bad experience regarding wait time after being seated. Typically, I wouldn't go back to a restaurant where I had a bad experience. However, I was compelled to write this review (and return) because the staff acknowledged their mistake, in a professional and kind manner. That combined with the flavor explosion of every dish I've had there, made it very easy to forgive and eat on :-) Antique is also our go-to place whenever we have guests from out of town, and they have all walked out thoroughly impressed and full--and making plans for what they'll order on their next trip! Also, if you ever have a private event, be sure to check out their Antique Loft. We celebrated my bf's 50th b-day there and the quality of food and service seamlessly transferred to their private events, along with an amazing view.As I read over my review, I realize it seems like I "drank the coolade", but if Antique is making it, I'll have extra!!
2020-05-28,5,Such a cute spot in Hoboken. Once you enter the restaurant you are transported back into the 1970s. From the hits of the 70s playing in the background, to the vintage decor of Fornasetti, this restaurant is a unique place to dine in. The menus resemble a script, which pays tribute to background story of the restaurant and its owners. Make sure to order the bread for the table. It's no wonder Frank Sinatra used to stiff suitcases with the delicious bread for an indulgence on the other side of the river.
2020-03-14,4,Charming and cozy space with an urban hip feel.  The ambiance is great.  As we walked in the DJ that night happily greeted us.  He was spinning some great music for dinner and drinks!   Other than the DJ the staff was pleasant but cold. They did their job and didn't really do much to make me feel welcome or valued.  We came in for dinner and had to wait a bit. Some people that came in before us got seated- not the most organized situation. We had two of the starters and the "killer garlic bread".  The starters were brilliant. I got the spaghetti squash carbonara. It was so so flavorful. I've had carbonara in Rome (and it was unbelievable)- this was better. I will say that the fried egg on top wasn't what I expected and it was over the top.  It was a fried soft boiled egg. I just think the breading in the egg did nothing for the dish. I didn't eat it all.  My partner had the rice balls. They were amazing. Like so good that next time we might order 2. The loaf of bread for the garlic bread was legit. The garlic/pesto bit was eh.  So overall I can't agree the garlic bread was killer or worth it. My drink was excellent. Well executed and very creative. My partner got the same thing without alcohol as he doesn't drink.  They charged me the same price for the alcoholic and non alcoholic version. COMPLETE BULLSHIT MOVE IMO. I pay for non alcoholic drinks all the time. Usually they charge like $10 instead of $14- I mean I get it there's the labor and inventory cost but it was not appropriate to charge the same price. That has never happened to me anywhere. No matter which city I am in.  When I asked for an adjustment it wasn't granted so I requested my shot of alcohol that I paid for....and got it.  So okay I guess.  Overall I can look past some of the misses.  The food was delicious, vibe was lit and we'll give another visit.
2020-02-27,4,So I've always heard great things about this place but never looked into it for myself. My friend and I wanted to try something new for dinner so we ended up coming here. Ambience is super cool and I love the Hollywood/script type theme. Drinks were so good and the food was even better. We ordered the mussels and hard herb steak. Overall very solid and very enjoyable. I was very tempted by their specials as they seemed unique and delicious. Maybe next time :) Overall this place is great for a night out with parents or family, date night, or a special occasion. I did hear it gets absolutely lit at night, but I have yet to experience that.Last bit of feedback Is price. This place is very expensive with generally $35-50 entrees. Be prepared to spend some moolah! My friend and I had a $140 bill between the two of us!
2020-02-26,5,Amazing!! Impeccable service amazing food we can't rave enough!! From the greeting at the door to our very knowledgeable server. What an incredible evening. Thank you to the entire staff!! We can't wait to return!!
2020-02-24,5,Hidden Gem on a quiet street in HobokenBy far one of the most unique restaurants in New Jersey, former bakery turned restaurant with a completely open kitchen featuring a 400 sq ft coal oven. You can tell by eating here the amount of time and effort they put into prepping everything, from the breads and buns to homemade mozzarella and desserts everything is fresh and homemade. Recommend ordering a bunch of food and sharingMenu is always changing and haven't had a dish I didnt like. Definitely recommend the mozzerela, herb steak, cookie for dessert.
2020-02-16,1,Absolutely horrible experience. Service was terrible they screwed up multiple times on our order. The staff was a cast of characters, one was more bizarre than the next. I can't believe I made it through dinner with out walking out. They couldn't get anything right. The tables were old and wobbly as well as the chairs. The food was overpriced and portions were very small. Even the bathroom was strange poorly lit and the hand dryer blew cold air. The tables were on top of each other and it was uncomfortable to have a conversation. If it was free I wouldn't go back.
2020-02-16,2,This was our first visit to Antique Bar and it will be our last. The place is tiny and I mean tiny. When you first walk in, the bar is literally right at the door and crowded. They have an open kitchen concept which is nice however they seriously need to address the ventilation system. We felt like we were at a bonfire. Our eyes were burning and we smelled like smoke upon leaving. The menu is very limited and when I say limited, most of what we wanted was sold out. How do you only make 12 burgers a day?  How do you run out of bread?  How do you run out of desserts when "Bakery" is in your name??  The food  we were lucky to get was good, but it can't make up for the lack of options and running out of food. I will say when our party jumped from 6 to 10 they accommodated us quickly. The service at the bar was a nightmare. We placed an order with one of the bartenders and when the other bartender asked what we were having we told him we gave our order to the girl and he said she never told him. Wtf? Don't get me started on the prices way way way overpriced for the selection. I wanted to like this place but it just wasn't happening.
2020-02-15,3,Great atmosphere, perfect music (Stevie, Otis, Ray)- wasn't too loud but we were at the bar. Started with lemon oil prawns- they were pretty good but would be nice if gave you 4.  The Osso Buco manicotti is delicious!   But the baked chicken was underwhelming, under seasoned and overpriced at $24 for plain baked chix on a plate.  It comes with a side of dipping sauce but they don't give enough to make up for the lack of taste.  You can order a second sauce for $5 - seems a lot for so little.  Sides are a la carte- $11.  The brussel sprouts were tasty but I have had better. Overall it gives Hobokenites an NYC Village vibe which we could use but needs some work on some of the dishes and for the NYC prices they could throw in a few breadsticks!
2020-02-14,5,I've been coming here for the last three years and the experience has been consistently great.  There isn't another place in the area like it.  There's always awesome music playing, the open kitchen and unique oven are one of a kind, drinks are always perfectly made and menu is fresh.
2020-02-09,5,Absolutely incredible!!!! The food is Delicious!  Especially loved the butternut squash and the cookie dessert. The pepperoni stuffed bread was also incredible!
2020-02-07,4,Very nice ambiance here. Exposed brick, old posters, signage and art make it special. The facade outside could definitely be improved. They have some drinks and beers which are good (not a huge selection, for option moguls), and food is delicious. Portions are properly sized, not small nor big, and food is a bit expensive, but in my opinion worth it. If it's your vibe, definitely check it out.
2020-02-06,3,Brought my boyfriend here for his birthday and was really disappointed. The Brussel sprouts were burnt, not charred and our appetizers just didn't live up to my expectations. I had been here for apps and drinks before and enjoyed the experience. Our main courses weren't the best, the service was really slow and considering it was a special occasion I wasn't thrilled.The highlight of the meal was the bread pudding for desert, but the portion was large enough that I had to bring some to work the next day so I didn't throw it out. Blood orange cocktail was pretty good but needed a little more tequil
2020-02-03,3,Overall *** Going in I was very excited after hearing the back story on the place but maybe I'm just getting too old for this level of cool. My weighted grading system comes in at 3.33 Stars, I enjoyed the food but between the drive, parking, service and price it was just was too much of a hassle for me to want to go out of my way to return.Setting **** Located a bit out of the way on the West side of Hoboken and without much available parking as it is in what looks like a more residential area with only street parking. While relatively nondescript outside, inside it is a classic Hoboken pub, absolutely packed, long and narrow with very high ceilings, a huge wall facing bar and two dining rooms. We sat in the back near the open kitchen and admittedly watching them open the door on the wood burning oven and seeing the raging fire was enjoyable.There are a few issues for me though; There are only two single use bathrooms for this size space is ridiculous. The one just past the bar is about the size of a closet and by 7:30 it was decimated and resembled a port'o potty at an outdoor concert. The one nearer the front is a bit larger.The restaurant itself is dark, I mean ridiculously dark. Looking around the tables nearly everyone was using the light on their phones to read the menu.Service ** Our server was friendly and the manager who eventually took control was very nice but at 6:30 on a Saturday night it was a frustrating experience. It took nearly 15 minutes for our first round of drinks to arrive and then we were told that one of the items ordered they were out of. A replacement drink arrived after another 10 minutes. The drink service was insanely slow all night and the food pace wasn't much better.This may not be technically a service issue the tables are packed in so tight that you get bumped by servers and patrons all night along with having servers carry plates over your head.While waiting on line for the bathroom I watched the bar and a man who seemed like some type of manager was getting in the bartenders way besides sticking his fingers in every glass he picked up.The menu itself I thought is ridiculous, it has very small print, difficult to follow and with lots of attempts at being amusing but their little phrases in fake "Red marker" generally make little sense. For example they list a whole host of sauces with certain entrees but none of them seem to work with the entrees and, at least with our server, she never suggested a special sauce. Under the drinks menu they list Rose as "ALL DAY". Really? They serve Rose wine all day, they are amazing!The "Antique Burger" they only serve 12 per day. That's just obnoxious, why even put it on the menu then? Just make it a special. Food **** Overall the food was very good with more hits than misses.Sweet Potato Hummus and the side of Brussel Sprouts were outstanding. The Manicotti, Lasagne and Herb Steak were very, very good.My table mates enjoyed the Mussels more than I did and while the Pork Cheek was ok the Shrimp was a notable laggard as they were small and in their shell. The dish was described as ok but not worth the effort. Value ** The entree portion sizes in most cases were smaller than the appetizers to the point that it was nearly Tapas looking. The price point for those portions is absurd to me but it is the drink prices that are truly painful. Their special drink list are $14 each and were served in tiny wine glasses. We switched over to mixed drinks after one round but still they were $14 for a short pour.All in for a party of six was $553 which is not completely soul crushing but that is still nearly $99 per person and would have been higher but as mentioned earlier we couldn't get drinks delivered.
2020-01-28,5,Bone marrow Ribeye burger is divine. Cocktails are outstanding. Pancetta in the squash carbonara is sexual.
2020-01-19,5,Always have a good time at this spot. Perfect for a group that likes to share. Great food and drinks. Cool atmosphere.
2020-01-11,4,innovative menu and great quality. prices are a bit high for the portions but worthwhile for special occasions or to entertain foodies.
2020-01-05,5,I have been living in Hoboken for 3 years and finally got around to trying this amazing place! It's cute inside. The food is absolutely delicious and the cocktails were amazing. The sides are for sharing and the entrees are large enough to keep you full but not overwhelmingly huge. We went right before the holidays and the Christmas decor was adorable. Such a cozy spot!
2020-01-05,3,This used to be one of my favorite places to brunch in Hoboken. Unfortunately lately it's been going a bit downhill. First off, they stopped serving the sticky buns and lobster pasta on a regular basis. Those were prob our favorite items on the menu. The burnt ends lasagna was terrible, nothing like a lasagna nor the crispy yummy corners of a lasagna. Instead it was a salty super cheesy sauce with mushrooms over pasta. This DOES NOT resemble anything remotely close to a lasagna. The burger was okay. Best thing we ate were the French fries.
2019-12-28,2,I live right around the corner and have been to this place about a dozen times over the last few years. Food is always great. I booked a reservation for 5 people and a baby 3 days in advance. We arrived on time for our reservation last night and there was a 4 top reserved for our 5 person party and a baby. We had to wait 25 minutes in the bar with our 1 year old, while the host/manager scrambled to find a larger table.  I've worked in very busy restaurants over several years as a GM and I understand that from time to time these things happen. The table where we wound up sitting, was left empty without being cleared for nearly 10 minutes after the previous guests left, when a tall gentleman from behind the bar wearing a white hat with a large round brim approached the table. As he was finishing setting the table I told my party that the table is all ready, so we can go sit down. The guy looks back at me and with a super confrontational tone and goes " oh is it it really ready, though?" He looked like he wanted to fight me, as I stood there with my one year old in my arms. I don't know where you found this guy, but he does not belong working in hospitality. After he barked at me, I asked him if he wanted to hold my baby, who I had been holding for nearly a half an hour, due to the restaurant's mistake, while i finish doing his job. He gave me nothing but attitude and was super confrontational. He stared me down as if though he wanted to kick our entire party out of the restaurant. The kitchen fired our food quickly, the waitress was great and the host/manager gave us a free round of Prosecco, due to the mess up for not originally reserving a table of the right size. I don't know how you hired an individual with this type of attitude to be working front of the house in your business. He is absolutely awful and I would of fired him if I heard this interaction in any of the places that I have run over the years.
2019-12-23,4,Up beat, noisy and in a great location. Met my girl on a Thirsty Thursday for a cocktails & a small plate. Drink's - A delishFood - B really good Atmosphere B really good, one must be in the mood for noisy Lot's of groups & gal pal's on the night we were thereOur waiter was new*Order the meatballs, don't forget to dip said bread in the gravy (sauce) before anyone takes your plate away*
2019-12-21,4,Good food, although service was a bit slow. For an app we butternut squash carbonara which was delicious. We got the Steak wasn't as good as I would have hoped, but that's what you get for a $27 steak. The cookie at the end was amazing!
2019-12-21,2,My boyfriend and I had our anniversary dinner here last night. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy nice places and am willing to dish out for a high quality meal. This place is extremely overpriced for the quality of the food. Everything we had was just ok, vegetable sides were $11, which were not included with the main. We both had cocktails which we enjoyed, but the wine we both had was not very good and was also a tiny portion.  The interior of the place was really cool, and had no issues with the service.
2019-12-11,5,I went to Antique Bar & Bakery for the first time last night.  This place is a 10/10.  Chef Gerard has created an amazingly creative, delicious and diverse menu, that is perfectly executed by his kitchen.  The atmosphere is warm, inviting and entertaining, and the service was perfect.  The food that Chef Gerard pulls out of that coal oven is truly unique and so delicious, it has you planning your next visit during the first bite.  This place is a winner for anyone who likes good food.
2019-11-25,1,Horrifyingly slow and neglectful service.  Will never return.   Was not my first time here but will certainly be my last.  Read all the reviews lately regarding service and change what you are doing if you want any return customers!
2019-11-23,5,This is the best place in Hoboken for a million reasons. Perfection & fun  with a great vibe & killer food
2019-11-23,1,This was the second time we've gone to Antique Bar - we liked the ambiance the first time around and wanted to give it another try. To put it bluntly: the ambiance is not worth it. The menu says "only 12 burgers per day" which we asked the waitress about - it's a straight lie. Also for $34 a burger they could really improve the output. We honestly would have preferred to buy 34 McDonalds cheeseburgers for $1 each and would have been happier and fuller.
2019-11-15,2,I won't be coming back to Antique, when you factor in service, food, and drinks, antique is just not worth it. I would much rather go to Corto  in jersey city for this type of open kitchen dining experience. I don't need to see the intricacies of the kitchen regardless of what hip dining trend is going on. I would rather go to Dino and Harry's if I wanted dry aged beef and pay $135. Again antique falls short with their burnt rib eye that although dry aged, is not as flavorful as dry aged beef from places like dinos or peter Lugers. Everything as far as appetizers and sides were good but nothing out of this world. Nothing is gonna blow your mind, nothing is life changing. $50 for a whole chicken, what can I say, the chicken tastes like chicken. And Our server..... he was unaware of what drinks/alcohol was available at the bar. I had to go ask the bartender myself to find out if they had a particular liquor, which they clearly had and was well displayed. He also forgot the coffee order we made with our dessert. Do yourself a favor and skip this place.
2019-11-15,2,I made a reservation a month ahead of time. My expectations were high after seeing this place on RHONY and blogs. Atmosphere is incredible. The restaurant is petite and vintage so you give up space and comfort for a unique and genuine setting. It took 20 minutes to get drinks and take our order which to my disappointment meant the last burger of the day had be sold. The server tried to accommodate which was kind. He appeared to be the only waitstaff for 6 tables and was as efficient as he could be. The food was hit or big miss. The arugula salad was so salty from the pile of Parmesan on top. Underneath was an almond purée which we loved. The lasagna edges were tasty but could have used more flavor and richness. The $27 Herb Steaks were dry and tough to the point of being inedible. There was no follow up to our entree delivery so I was out luck to ask for a fix. The Mexican cauliflower was my favorite dish I loved the creamy combo. The steak fries had no flavor and came with one semi pan fried pepper when I was expecting more of a spicy kick to the potato not a garnish. $235 bill for food I could have made myself for $50 and dare I say could have made better. We may have over ordered you could have done with one appetizer with its giant bread and shared one entree. Had the bill been $100 I would have still been disappointed. This restaurant is adorable and I hope they get their kitchen up to level it could and should be.
2019-11-10,3,Good food and cool decor.  however the service here is really bad, one of the worst in NYC area I've experienced.  First off the service is really slow, takes 15 minutes just to get water, and 30 minutes for a coffee.  And the staff are pretty universally unfriendly.  Has a bad vibe about it.   Lots of better places in Hoboken.
2019-11-02,2,Straight to the point: food is totally average and overpriced. Not much more to say than you will get decent food at double the price. Nothing will knock your socks off besides the bill and the amount of pesto used.
2019-11-01,2,Straight to the point: the food here is great, but MAN the service is ridiculously slow. We came here on a busy Friday night, made a reservation for 7:30pm on Yelp. Came in, got seated right away. The tables are incredibly cramped and right on top of each other, you can't get out of your seat without moving the table. Ordered drinks and garlic bread, both took about 15 minutes to arrive. The garlic bread is spread with pesto, which they really should mention. I forget the name of the drink, but the tequila and blood orange was very refreshing, just needed a touch more tequila. The vodka, Prosecco, and berry drink were a bit too acidly for my taste. We ordered our entrees and the dessert at the same time, being that the cookie takes 20 min to make. For our entrees we asked for a side of fries, which she brought out before our entrees. We thought that meant our entrees were coming soon, but we didn't get our food until 8:40pm, over an hour later. Our fries were cold but I didn't care at that point. I ordered the hard herb steak and I really enjoyed it. It had great flavor, but for $27 it was an 8oz steak with no sides, very pricey. Once we finished with our entrees we asked if the dessert was coming out, the waitress said it wasn't ready yet. I then got frustrated and told her that we specifically ordered the dessert with her at the same time as the entrees, which we waited over an hour for. So I didn't understand what was taking so long. I spoke to the manager and told him the situation. He comped our desserts. He must've been having a bad night though because he kept slamming doors and kicking them open. The bread pudding and peanut butter cookie were both amazing. There's no denying that this place has good food, but the experience was less enjoyable for us because it is not managed well. Not worth having this experience again.
2019-11-01,5,I used to buy bread there years and years a go. There was a little lady behind the counter and a few loaves of old fashioned crusty Italian. We went some out of nostalgia and some a mailing from yelp with excellent reviews but with a little hesitation.   That said we were stunned by the excellence of the food. Exquisite.  The staff is all young and sweet.  The decor old neighborhood gem.  We walked in on a Friday night and they welcomed us squeezed us in at the bar.  Ryan the bar tender cheered us with his wine and his joy of life. We had the shrimp appetizer, lasagna and beef marrow pasta and loved it.   Enjoy.
2019-10-30,4,This place is absolutely wonderful.  It is like a NYC vibe in Hoboken with excellent cocktails and wonderful food.  Sitting at the bar or dining at a table will both provide wonderful experiences any day of the week.Enjoy!
2019-10-29,1,My fiancé and I went last Friday night. Offensively overpriced. Tables are on top of each other, basically rubbing shoulders with people next to you. Music is way too loud. I could barely have a conversation or hear the waitress. Everyone is forced to shout. When I asked if they could turn it down, the waitress laughed and said "this is how it is here". Food was actually very good. We had the Mutz (mozzarella appetizer with bread) which costs $24. They ran out of burgers which is just them trying to copy places like Raoul's. Overall I think this place just tries too hard to be trendy and blast music.
2019-10-28,3,After reading many glowing reviews and reading the recommendation of HobokenGirl blog, we decided to dine here, specifically to try their 2lb, bone-in ribeye. The ribeye costs $135, which was a splurge for me. However, i might have come with too high of an expectation. The ribeye was cooked to temp, tender, but lacking in flavor. The crust looked completely black and tasted bitter. The meat around the crust was not too enjoyable, but I will give this a pass since the steak was cooked in a coal fire oven and maybe I'm just not used to it. At this price tag, I was expecting Japanese wagyu level of taste but was quite disappointed. I felt that I have had better flavored meat from my local butcher (a good, marbled piece of USDA prime, angus steak) and grilling it myself, and which would have costed around 1/4 of the price.Otherwise, service was attentive and friendly. Steak portion was generous. The hot oil dipping sauce and whole garlic that came with the steak were nice. We might be back to try other less expensive items on their menu.
2019-10-26,3,Making the decision to move to Hoboken from New York City was like agreeing to Ursula's arrangement in The Little Mermaid. In exchange for covetable livability (a close-knit, tree-lined, park-filled, shop-fronted, meticulously maintained community, all a stone's throw from Manhattan), I had to surrender something precious. Vibes. The pure, uncut, deliciously trendy vibes of being in "the city"; a no name izakaya with an outstanding juke box, French New Wave on corner marquees, a dive bar playing Tom Waits at 2am, a friend of a friend's coworker's crashable backyard BBQ party in an enviable corner of Brooklyn. Metaphorically speaking, the moment I signed my 07030 lease, these vibes were all zapped into a nautilus shell, hanging around the neck of a sea witch.A lot of it has to do with New Jersey's liquor license policy. These licenses cost upwards of $350k and continue to cripple the potential for a revitalized dining scene. A majority of places in Hoboken are BYOB, which is all well and good for customers, but for restauranteurs, it's a stranglehold to revenue and at the end of the day, it's far too risky to experiment and invest in the bar/restaurant scene the way that NYC does. So, while Hoboken boasts its bars-per-capita stats, it seems the bars themselves boast their own flatscreen-TV-per-wall stats; most establishments are loud, uninspired sports bars. And in a reverse Field of Dreams sentiment, if you don't build the scene, the scenesters won't come.Which is why I was so struck by Antique Bar and Bakery. My boyfriend and I had heard about it, never been, and spontaneously embarked one evening last week. Immediately, our jaws dropped. Is that...a framed vintage poster of a Sophia Loren film? Are those viles at the bar storing artisanal cocktail ingredients, like spooky little potions?? Is the menu formatted like a film script?!  Our tails were wagging as we got situated at our bespoke dining table. How did it take us so long to come here? Hoboken  does  have it all! Screw the anti-Jersey hipsters brooding across the pond, we have our own cred now, dammit it. Let's start the revolution, reopen Maxwell's, get back on the map!Alas, the food was terrible. And so were the drinks. At prices you would encounter at a Soho House. And to top it off, all served by a bizarrely inattentive waitstaff.The 'Smokey Bandit' cocktail had, perhaps, a thimble of mezcal and my $14 Chenin Blanc was served warm, in a serving size made for an American Girl Doll.We ordered three appetizers: the Mussels, the Mushroom Rice Balls, and (shudders) the Spaghetti Squash Carbonara.-The mussels were tiny and flavorless, most had already abandoned their shells in search of a better life, and this was served with a baseball bat-sized garlic bread that was soaked in oil.-The rice balls felt like a dorm room experimentation of producing a gourmet dish from several boxes of Trader Joe's frozen foods.-And then there was (retches) the Spaghetti Squash Carbonara - a beige nightmare, a cold pile of squash swimming in flavorless gravy senselessly topped with a fried, poached egg. The aftertaste was unbearable. It's difficult to describe without being crude, but to any SATC-savvy readers, I would describe the flavor in the same manner that Samantha describes Bobby Cavannale (nudge nudge, wink wink).So, why 3 stars, do you ask? Because, despite the $77 bill and the necessary $5.99 purchase of mouthwash at CVS after the fact, this was the first time I finally felt the sickly sweet familiarity of what I've been missing since I started living here: the vibes. While Antique Bar and Bakery is clueless when it comes to, well, almost everything that a successful restaurant should have going for it, it really does have a great atmosphere. On a rainy weeknight, it was a refuge for artsy Hobokenites desperate to be at a bar that's not blasting Ariana Grande or flashing sports games in every square inch. The bar and restaurant are amazingly designed and decorated, you can tell that the team really took great care into curating the space and making it Hoboken - there's even a film projection on the wall playing a loop of  On The Waterfront.  I'll be back...but only for an untampered beer.
2019-10-25,1,Sooo I heard about this place and decided I was going to check it out on a Thursday night with my boyfriend once we like to explore different bars and restaurants in Hoboken . I arrived there at 5:05pm on a Thursday afternoon and it was so early there were only 3 people seated at the bar , there were also "2" Bartenders, I walked in and sat at the bar ......none of the bartenders welcomed me however I figured they were busy with the other 3 customers they had .. WELL I sat there unattended for 20 minutes while they actually chatted with each other , they didn't even tell me hello I'll be right with you or here's a menu .. NOTHING ... ABSOLUTELY NOTHING , I sat there for 20 MINUTES , so I just got up and left and went to another spot in Hoboken where people actually know how to do business . I'm just wondering if there were only 3 people at the bar and no guests at the restaurant with 2 bartenders and they didn't even take the time to serve me a drink , how long do you actually wait for your drink when the bar is crowded??!  Certainly don't want that experience again . Don't waste your time going there , you'll probably wait 2 hours for a waitress . ‍
2019-10-23,4,Antique bar and bakery has great food and music. Drinks are great as well. Wines BTG could use some amping up and the prices are quite high. We were seated by the oven and the line which I didn't love so with limited seating there are some not so great seats. Unfortunately, I don't eat bread but my party loved the delicious baked goods which came out of the wood fired oven. It's a splurge! But a yummy one!
2019-10-18,3,Came here for our anniversary dinner and had high expectation due to the reviews. The ribs was supposed to be good but I must say we were a little disappointed. We ordered a medium rare and they had the temperature nailed down. The exterior meat was cooked more well than others but we didn't mind it. We got the hot oil sauce which was a nice touch. I also liked the whole grilled garlic cloves which we can scrape to put on the meat. However, I can't fathom why a dry aged meat can be so tasteless. I had to request for salt and additional sauce to help remediate the situation. The cook must have forgotten to season the meat. There were several meat pieces but only the bone-in meat was flavorful. For $135, it wasn't worth it as I can cook better at home with a good piece of meat.Apart from that, the waitress and waitresses were very attentive and provided good service.
2019-10-03,2,Sorry Guys, This place is overrated.  The mussels were good and the bread smothered with pesto was nice to dip in the mussel sauce but besides that.... I'll pass.  The daily special of calamari was fresh and well cooked but the sauce served with it was thick and tasted like just Mayo.  We ordered the Pork cheeks with Smoked Mozz because we could smell a wonderful aroma of smoked chips and thought we have to try this but when it came out it was cold and you needed a saw to cut the smoked mozz on top.   The hostess was also the waitress, so our service was slow not very attentive.   The food runner was so confused because we ordered a bunch of appetizers and we ran out of room on our table so he stood over us saying over and over again, there is no room to put this on the table.  No one was sitting to our left or right so we took the plate from him and placed it on the table next to us for the moment.  The Shisito peppers were OK but nothing to write home about.  We thought about dessert and asked for a menu and then we were shocked that a piece of chocolate cake was $22.  Not worth it for dinner but a very cute spot in Hoboken for a drink.
2019-10-01,5,This place was AMAZING. The atmosphere was dark and sophisticated with an old world Italian flair. The food was out of this world, superb! We had the mussels (so fresh) shishito pepper is that were BOMB. And then for entree we had an out of this world fresh fish dish and pasta dish. This is an absolute, must go place. GREAT food great vibe
2019-10-01,3,Would be a 5 star if they didn't ruin the chicken leg on my freebird range half chix..  but the b tender and beer made up for it.  For inspiration, El pollo Loco could guide the chef on how a chicken leg is done! but thank you for the effort and the wicked porcelain brick oven heritage...
2019-09-25,4,Love this place, amazing food & drinks. A lot of great specials, just wish they had a few more healthy or lighter options so I wasn't rolling home each time
2019-09-23,5,Finally got a reservation! Make sure you make your reservation at least a few days ahead. It's in high demand, and with good reason. The decor is dark and cool. The drinks are on par with what you'd expect in Hoboken and NYC. The food was creative and delicious!I'm definitely going back for more.
2019-09-20,4,Once I saw the amazing pictures of the huge desserts here I just had to go!  I had already picked out what we were going to have for dinner because I looked on the menu online.  Unfortunately,  they didn't update the online menu so some of the items were no longer on the menu.  A good idea for the restaurant is to keep their menu online current.  For appetizers we had the spinach and cheese stuffed bread and the mushroom rice balls.  The spinach and cheese stuffed bread was out of this world good!  The mushroom rice balls weren't good at all!  They were hard as a rock, and there was like a disgusting cheap tasting cheese wiz sauce surrounding it.  For entrees we had the burnt lasagna edges and spinach spaghetti is pesto sauce.  The burnt lasagna edges was DELICIOUS!  It was so unique, and tasted nothing like lasagna.  The cheese and the mushrooms they used gave it an incredible flavor!  Unfortunately, the cheesy bread it came with was hard as a rock because it was burnt to crisp!  The spinach spaghetti in a pesto sauce was good, but no were near as good as the burn lasagna edges dish!  For dessert I ordered the cookie in a skillet.  The waiter told me it was suppose to be a huge chocolate chip cookie.  The only problem is there was no chocolate chips!  When I dug into the cookie it was very mushy, and it looked like it wasn't cooked to the right temperature.  I called another waiter over, and he said that's how it's suppose to look.  I also asked where are the chocolate chips?  This waiter told me it was a peanut butter cookie, and wasn't suppose to have chocolate chips.  Overall the taste was still good.   However, it would of been fantastic if it actually had chocolate chips in it, and it was cooked a little more.  I'd love to come often here to dine her, but the menu as of now is too limited.  Definitely, add a few more appetizers, and add at least two more pasta dishes, a filet mignon or a strip steak, and another seafood dish to keep regulars.  Another thing this restaurant needs is air conditioning!  Last Sunday it was boiling HOT inside, and we were sweating profusely!  I wouldn't dine here if it's over 70 degrees out unless they install an air conditioning system!  Overall, Antique Bar & Bakery is a really unique place and most of the dishes were really good!  I highly recommend dining here!
2019-09-20,4,The vibe is warm and kitschy with a 70s vibe. The dark room warmed by the glow of candles and the heat of a coal oven is wonderful.  The music!! Playlist is retro, familiar, welcoming, and varied.  Volume still allows you to have a conversation. Foodwise... promise me you'll try a stuffed bread, ok? Pepperoni is the best in my opinion. My friend and I usually  share s pepperoni  bread and then share a pasta dish called lasagna wedges. Earthy with wild mushrooms and herbs with textural component of aldente ruffled pasta. It is really good. Comes with cheese bread! Cocktails are creative and good, but at nyc prices in this Hoboken establishment...the bill can be an unpleasant surprise at the end of the meal.Good food, good vibes, good music. One bartender who was do nice and professional, but I dont remember her name. Dark hair and was there on a Wednesday evening
2019-09-13,4,That atmosphere here is amazing. Old and charming. Relaxed yet sophisticated. It's a little pricy but the cocktails are great and the food delicious.
2019-08-30,4,Had a res for 5 ppl at 7:45pm on a Thursday before Labor Day and it was still crowded!! Came a bit early to get a drink at the bar before dinner. I went with an IPA but all of the cocktails looked great and the bar tender was top notch. My fiancé got the mr. freedom tequila watermelon mint cocktail and loved it.Now for food....we ordered a mozz special (plum and red wine reduction), hot oil shrimp, arugula salad, and the spaghetti squash carbonara. The spaghetti squash carbonara was probably my favorite...so amazing with the breaded/fried egg ball on top. For entrees, I split the burnt ends lasagna and the hard herb steak with my fiancé. Others for the burnt ends lasagna, chicken, and short rib on top of green pappardelle. The steak was awesome but we asked for it rare and it was definitely more medium rare. The burnt ends lasagna was in a butter mushroom sauce...amazing!!! Didn't try the chicken but my sister raved about it. The green pappardelle with short rib was actually an herb green sauce. Super fresh and the flavors went so well with the beef. Loved the vibes here and the food was unique!! Worth a trip for sure.
2019-08-27,4,Such a fan. Somethings can be hit or miss, but if you stick to the standards - mussels, pork cheek, steak, pasta - you will have a great meal!
2019-08-26,4,Came here with 8 people, we ordered family style, the food was excellent! Everything is cooked in their 100 year old oven, which gives a unique characteristic to all of the food. From where we were sitting, we could see everything being prepared which made the meal very personal.I ordered the "Johnny friendly" cocktail and it was very refreshing. They have a full bar with a short list of cocktails that everyone enjoyedEveryone loved the appetizer that had spliced tomatoes and pesto over bread. For entrees we had 2 steaks, a full chicken and the fish. I'm generally not a fish person but i ended up eating at least half of it! For dessert, the 8 of us shared 3 desserts, the cannoli sundae, the antique bread putting and the decadent cookie. The cookie takes about 20 minutes for them to prepare and was worth it!Personally I felt the menu was difficult to read (especially at night time).  This just made us ask a lot of questions before ordering.I loved the atmosphere, if you're coming with more than 5 people I suggest making reservations so they can prepare a table for you. Jordyn was our waitress and she did an excellent job making sure we were having a good experience. As a side note: they only have two single person bathrooms so be sure to take that into consideration on a busy night!
2019-08-23,5,What to eat: For apps: the mussels and the squash carbonara. Pasta: lasagna ends! Meat: ribeye! Dessert: GIANT COOKIE IS A MUST (but another table had the bread pudding and it looked sooooo good). This is easily one of the best restaurants in Hoboken/JC.  The cozy, chic atmosphere is perfect for a date night, girls night, or small group.  There is a cute bar area, and the bar makes good drinks. The food is superior to most other food in the area. It is a little pricey depending on what you get, but the portions are huge and the quality is high. All the food we ordered was delicious but our favorites were: 1) squash carbonara app which tasted loke mac and cheese with bacon and was insanely delicious 2) the lasagna ends pasta which also tasted like the best mac and cheese you have ever had and was so rich and filling 3) the giant ribeye which was cooked perfectly and covered with spicy peppers and roasted garlic 4) THE COOKIE for dessert-- just do it. Save room. Eat the whole thing.
2019-08-21,4,It's a very good, cozy place, I love their decor!Their cocktails are really good (no any disgusting sugar syrup). Their mussels are the best!! Definitely should try it! Staff is very good too!However I didn't love their dishes (I ordered some chicken and salad, don't remember names). It was too salty for me and I couldn't eat.I would recommend this places for amazing cocktails and appetizers!
2019-08-13,5,I go for the squash carbonara with the Scotch egg and then love everything else I order.
2019-08-06,5,Best place I have eaten in Hoboken so far. A little hot inside but great view to the kitchen ... just wear less ... the food is out standing!!!!
2019-08-05,5,I have been here countless times since this gem opened up.  We've been here for everything from drinks to happy hour to dinner to brunch, even one of their cocktail classes (amazing), and a pig roast on the 4th of July (excellent).If you're in Hoboken and you haven't gone here yet-I have so many questions for you, starting with why the heck not? Chef Paul (head chef), can usually be found here most nights-he's always been very kind to me, my friends, my husband.  He's not like traditional chefs where he's too good to interact with people-super cool guy.Also, the cocktails are expertly made-I believe his daughter (or daughter in law) works behind the bar and develops a lot of there seasonal concoctions.  They're worth a try-especially around the holidays.The vibe inside is awesome, but I will tell you this-if you're looking for a quite intimate night out-this isn't your spot-especially not on the weekends.  They've got music pumping, sometimes you'll hear stuff from everyone working the kitchen, but that's why you go.  The kitchen is exposed to the entire back room, so you can see everything which is awesome.   I've had everything from the steak to the lasagna edges and the bread pudding (a must try) and everything has always been delicious-you honestly can't go wrong.  If you haven't tried it-you need to.
2019-08-02,2,I've been here probably 4 other times and would have given this a 4.5/5 star review. Seems like there's a new manager in town and he doesn't know how to run a business. Pretty disappointed.
2019-07-28,5,This place is amazing! Here's some history 1. Largest coal oven in united states (425 sq. Feet) 2. Coal oven is over 100 years old 3. Back in the 1960s bread was made here and sent to Manhattan where it was sold road side 4. We sat at the table which used to be area where hay was kept for horses ....it just took has back to pre world era and then the 60s -70s.. this used it be only a bakery and now Converted to restaurant about a year and half ago!!!
2019-07-19,2,The ONLY reason for the low rating is the restaurant is so HOT inside you feel like you are melting. The service was great!  The food was awesome!!  The oven is right where you eat and they have do not have a proper air conditioning system. I think this is a cold weather restaurant only.
2019-07-15,5,Steak, steak just eat steak. Top ten steak dinners. I was very happy to see Brooklyn has invaded Hoboken as we could use a break from the Upper Westside stroller influenced meals that are rampant in the area. Thanks,​ Antique for being one of the first to care about food, atmosphere, ​and drinks ​.The server​r was a rockstar and managed our table like a boss.
2019-07-14,1,My husband and I do date night 2x a month,  we saw this one on one of NJ show case restaurant shows!  It looked so good! So we made a resavation for 630 7/13.  We arrived at 6:25, we ordered by 6:35.  We ordered pulled mots and it was ok ..I had an ice tea my husband a diet coke.  We sat for 45 mins and no food.  The waitress came by and told us that oven was old and there were issues, she was going to check.  She never came back.  We waited another about 15 to 20 mins more.  My husband said enough got up and said we are leaving!  Never have my husband or I walked out of a restaurant ....now mind u this steak is 80.00.  He found the waitress and asked for the bill!  She went and get the manager.  My husband said we really shouldn't pay anything ,but to be fair he would pay the 12.60 bill.  The manger said thank u for being fair!  LoL. Thank u for not knowing how to manage your customers!  or how to manage your kitchen!  Never once did the say you food is cooking , we will rush it.  Nothing just sorry about that....cause if there was an 80 t bone steak cooking! One would think they would ask u to stay. Nothing thank u sorry! Have a good night! Very Disappointed
2019-07-03,3,The service here is so incredibly bizarre I have no idea what's going on. Whenever I go to antique - which is only like 3 times - I always get seated in that little corner hallway place and it's no man's land over there. It would definitely be smarter to sit at the bar since all the staff seems to only care about that area. The food is good but not good enough to endure the pain of their service
2019-07-02,5,Easily one of the best restaurants in Hoboken. Great drinks, food, vibe, music and service. Go in hungry!
2019-06-23,1,My daughter took me there for father's day.  Ordered the t-bone steak. Menu said market price.Steak arrived burned , we ordered medium. Was charged $135 for the steak alone. Wrote two emails and no response. Shame on them.
2019-06-22,3,I would five it a 3. Just came on the Saturday after Valentines's at 6pm. -Pork cheek: okay. Could have done with some garlic or additional flavors.-Mussels: good but I have had better. Could have used a bit of salt to help bring out the flavors. The bread that came was too soaked in oil.-Herb steak: at $26 for 8oz with no sides, the price is steep. The steaks came out warm at best so we had to ask them to be rewarmed. They were good but expensive so not really worth it.-Smashed golds and chimi: good flavor but way too oily (they were sitting in a large pool of oil, see pic)-Chocolate chip cookie w peanut butter: good but way more undercooked than I expected (even the edge was raw-ish when usually this is the part that cooks fastest).Overall the food was good but nothing special. For a$165 meal, we have no leftovers and are barely satisfied. I will not be returning.
2019-06-20,5,This place rocks!! Just got the appetizers and drinks and kudos all around. Stuffed bread, mussels, mozzarella, shrimp in some incredible spicy sauce, kale salad and the drinks...jeez...the drinks..they just got everything right. The staff is impeccable. Owner and multiple servers spoke to myself and the team, gave us a history lesson on the place and were just super great. I will be back!! ASAP.
2019-06-13,1,NYC prices, NJ qualityWe were shocked at the prices on the menu. $10 for garlic bread and a $22 dessert! This is not a Michelin star restaurant but a neighborhood eatery with no frills and a lot of smoke from the rotisserie/oven. So these prices are unwarranted.We ordered a 1/2 chicken and a side of fries to share. The fries were so salty, we couldn't eat them. The chicken was very small and it looked more like quail.Overall, a big disappointment.
2019-06-12,5,Great atmosphere and even better drinks and food! You can't go wrong! Great date night spot or dinner with friends. Get the octopus!
2019-06-09,3,Good ambiance, nice place for a date night. My husband ordered the steak, which they had sold out of. He settled for the red snapper, served supposedly filleted but head and tail on. There were so many bones still in the fish that it distracted from the rest of our meal. The waitress also seemed uneducated about the menu. Overall, an average experience because the rest of the food was great and the drinks and ambiance were also lovely. But one dish prepared poorly means we probably won't be back.
2019-05-28,5,Great food, great staff, great scene. Only place I go as many times as I possibly can hoboken. If you want a balanced cocktail without the typical Hoboken bar crowd this is your place. Don't expect a television in the place. But do expect someone with something interesting to talk about behind the bar. Thankfully they expect people to converse with each other and the atmosphere is perfect for it.
2019-05-15,2,Expectations and hyped just did not work for Antique B&B. The venue and ambiance happens to be the best part to this place.  Their $14 mimosas are ridiculous especially for the size of the ones they served. I ordered the burger with a side slab of bacon. I guess it was good? Just did nothing for me. We as a table ordered about 2-3 items that were never delivered or even on the bill. The service was as bad as it gets. Sorry but I wouldn't ever return here.
2019-05-09,3,Dinner for 2 on a Wednesday night.   Atmosphere and service were both really good and we liked our cocktails a lot but the food prep and value were in the C grade range,   We ordered the specialty $130 rib eye and it wasn't nearly the cut quality it should have been and It was not prepared well.  It was very salty and the charred lemon overpowered the meat.   The $11 per dish sides were also unrefined,   The potatoes were in a puddle of grease and the Brussels were smothered with bbq sauce.   Overall, we spent $300 with wine and tip.   I would go back, but only for a pasta.
2019-04-28,2,Great vibes upon walking in. Had 9:30pm dinner reservations on a Saturday night. We ordered our $15 each cocktails (which were pretty good). Waitress went through the specials menu verbally which included fish dish and crab cakes. After finishing her spiel, she mentioned they only had 1 crab cake left and mentioned they were out of fish completely. I don't understand why she even mentioned the fish specials if they didn't have any to serve ...We then proceeded to order apps and dinner. My husband wanted to get the rib eye and broccoli rabe as a side. Apparently they were out of both since they had a busy night. Basically, they were sold out of 2 of the 3 main courses so he would've been stuck ordering pasta, which he did not want. After hearing that, we asked the waitress to just bring us the check for the drinks. She did not offer us any options, did not call over her manager to convince us to stay, nor did she apologize for being out of the main dishes and for the inconvenience. She simply brought us the check. I don't understand how you can be a trendy bar with city prices and lack such common sense/ hospitality as a waitress. She was clearly dense. The place was cool with good food (we've eaten there before, again experiencing subpar service). If you are a patient and flexible person, go for it. But if you have high expectations and standards, I would steer clear since going to end up costing $250+ for dinner and drinks here.
2019-04-25,4,Cocktails are delicious. The menu is amazing with the exception of brunch, that I won't return for. However, a nice happy hour/dinner is quite the treat. The bread and the mussels, yum! Lobster pasta doesn't disappoint either. One thing to note, the waitress lost our credit card from the table to the register. We were only offered coffee for the headache, but they called the next day that they found it. So we had to go all the way back, only to be met with an attitude from the staff when we asked for the card. One would except after all that hassle the restaurant would've offered something additional. Something to think about.
2019-04-20,5,This place is absolutely exquisite, and I don't think I've ever used the word exquisite in my vocabulary before. The decor and dim lights make it feel like you're back in the 70s, and for a girl who loves bellbottoms, I was exactly where I needed to be. The best part about this place is it doesn't just stop at their environment. Our waitress, Kimberly, who was on her A game the entire night (regardless of the busy crowd), took her time to explain the old brick oven story before taking our orders; I'll let you come to this place and figure it out for yourself. And of course the most important part, the food! Each dish was on point, and this is coming from a girl with an old Italian mother who knows how to cook her meatballs. I'd give this place a 10 star if I could! All around amazing night and I will be back to fill my stomach with bread and my heart with cheese.
2019-04-15,5,Can't say enough good things about this place. Cocktails are wonderful. Stuffed breads are great to take away for parties. Dining in, I always order: mussels, spaghetti squash carbonara, lasagna edges, Brussels sprouts, and bread pudding (like monkey bread! SO GOOD). Atmosphere is great, wait staff is attentive, and the food is fabulous. There's a reason my parents (from Texas) got me a gift card here for Christmas after they visited last summer!
2019-04-07,2,The vibe is lively which instantaeously sets the mood for a fun dining experience. Our server was very attentive and described the specials quite vividly. We ordered the Octopus special as our appetizer based on her suggestion. We were blown away with the size- such a large portion which made my husband very happy. It was delicious! Best octopus we have ever eaten. The lamb shank was delicious as was the spaghetti squash. We enjoyed the experience until we received the bill. The octopus appetizer was $62 dollars! We believe the common courtesy would have been to tell us up front the prices of the specials. If you go ask the prices of the specials.....
2019-04-05,2,Only gets stars for service. We ordered hot oil shrimp and mussels in green garlic sauce. This place is stupid expensive for the quality and quantity of food. The shrimp were okay. Much better places for seafood than this place. Tutta Pesca is the best! The mussels didn't have a great flavor. We got a lot of cracked shells and closed shells. Disappointed. This was not worth it and we haven't returned since.
2019-03-30,2,Very cool atmosphere but majorly overpriced. Shrimp appetizer tasted off and chicken was really dry and bland. Greek fries were awesome that we shared. Bolognese pasta and steak entrees were enjoyed the most. Will probably go back for drinks and music next time.
2019-03-27,4,What a great place. Kick back, enjoy great food, prepared with flare, in an unassuming setting. We had a team of eight people coming in on a Wednesday evening, but that got whittled down to five. So I called over and got Lynette on the phone and she was able to get us in at 7:30. We all arrived before 7:30 which was a miracle when two were from the West Coast and two were from Boston, plus me. Cocktails were incredible. The place is eclectic inside, and very well run with food runners, hostesses, bartenders, bussers and servers. We started with the fresh mozzarella clay pot, which was "ok". Melted muzz in a pot. The squash was incredible, kale salad was great, fries were "ok" and the lobsta pasta were all good picking plates. The calamari had fresh mint in it. I didn't dislike it, but also wasn't wowed. Then went to the full chicken and 2lb bone in ribeye. We split it all, and the steak, while cooked as ordered, could have been sliced a little more thinly given we were splitting. The charcoal grill is really a weakness of mine. Had a snafu with what seemed like very over priced cheap light red wine, and styles ran out, but we eventually found something similar and staff accommodated what seemed like an off taste on one of our bottles. Didn't expect desert to be so good, that dirty chocolate brownie with icing piped over it was pretty good. Furniture and decor was PERFECT. Exactly what one would expect for a smaller foodie place. And the playlist was incredible (George Harrison, Paul McCartney, The Kinks, etc). Just go to the bathroom before you get here, there are two single bathrooms that are hard to figure out. No biggie.It was super expensive for the food alone. Not a place I would go to more than twice a year based on the hefty price tag.
2019-03-11,3,My fiancé and I have dinner with our friends that live in Hoboken every few months and it was our turn to go to the restaurant they selected, which naturally for them was in Hoboken.The restaurant is pretty small, but with a nice bar area.  The music is fairly loud and it was at times hard to talk over it. I will say upfront, that the food we ordered was overall very good.  However, there was something just off about the entire experience, and it was a combination of the fact that our server was just not paying attention and overwhelmed or the kitchen completely ignored the fact that my fiancé has a gluten allergy.  Literally every dish where gluten was supposed to come on the side, came with gluten smack dab on top.  This is frustrating for someone with celiac because it's not like they go into anaphylactic shock, but it causes severe stomach issues later in the day.  For anyone with allergies that cause an immediate bodily reaction, I strongly urge you to reconsider eating here because they clearly do not take them seriously.  At one point in the evening our server handed us the wrong drinks and came back 8 seconds later and picked them up and took them on another table.  She then came back with our drinks, I have no idea where our drinks were and whether the person to whom they were served by accident had already taken a sip at that point. We ordered the following to share for the table:Special cheese order, basically like melted mozzarella.  The bread came on top of the cheese instead of on the side.  The cheese was delicious, but the consistency felt like the kind you get on a piece of pizza, albeit a very tasty one. The plums offered a lovely sweet contrast to the saltiness of the cheese.Shrimp - again bread came on the plate.  These were nicely spiced and flavorful. It's a little annoying that they can't just add 1 shrimp to the order for an extra charge. Kale salad - I love kale and the salad was very good, but probably the least memorable thing we orderedLobster pasta - this one they couldn't make gluten free because the lobster is breaded.  I thought this was fine, I don't really like pasta too much so it was probably lost on meThe large format steak.  This was incredibly moist and juicy, very well cooked in most parts (some parts of it were over cooked, but still soft).  Overall a solid choice.Side of Brussels sprouts.  The Brussels were themselves nice and crispy/well cooked, but the pork on top was inedible, and also looked deep fried (which would not be gluten free even though our server said it was) Potatoes.  Delicious, crispy and perfect.  Though our server told us these were mashed potatoes... they aren't they're just little roasted potatoes.For dessert we shared the sundae, which came out with a cookie on it.  The server came back to confirm it was a gluten free cookie, which I'm sure it was but our confidence was just completely gone at this point. The sundae was decent though I probably wouldn't suggest it (it was the only gluten free one).To pair with our dessert, we asked the server if they carried any port because it wasn't on the menu and she didn't know so had to go check.  It's little things like this that I feel like she should've been on top of.Honestly, writing this review made me realize how much of a mess the service really was, which is a shame because the food was really good and they have fun cocktails (assuming you get the ones you actually ordered).
2019-03-11,4,The back story: this restaurant replaced a 100 year old bakery and Hoboken staple with New York food and pastry chefs. The decor is throwback. What's good:- Amazing decor, excellent music, mixologist with personality, they put the bill in old paperbacks (we got the graduate), the hangar steak with half piece of garlic, the beets, the burnt end lasagna, the drinks - Fate and Tom Collins thing - fresh ingredients and well madeWhat's ok:- The sausage bread - it's sausage in hot bread and while I was expecting some badass rolls made in-house - that's my bias - it was just good as was the marinara dipping sauce. The service is good at times and ok at others but perhaps it's hit or missWhat's meh:Even with reservations you could end up waiting a while for a seat and if you have a small party you may end up at the seat right against the kitchen and specifically right in front of the coal oven - which is hot as hell. The 21 dollar dirty chocolate cake - so its gooey which is nice but it's not hot but it's in a cast iron skillet. It should be hot and gooey. We ordered ice cream with it - it was alright but I won't order it againI will definitely be coming here again to try more drinks, the 2lb ribeye , the cookie and bread pudding and brunch. Happy to have this spot in Hoboken.
2019-03-08,5,I am pretty sure there is not a piece of art on the walls that I wouldn't pay way too much money to have in my living room. I think this is going to be one of my new favorite places to come for drinks in Hoboken. We sat at the bar and took in this place in all it's glory. I had the Johnny Friendly and my boyfriend tried a couple of their whiskies. I am not afraid to admit that I think straight alcohol is super gross, so the Johnny Friendly was a great cocktail, maybe a little too sweet (that is probably the agave), but still delicious. On a Friday around 7, this place was in full swing. I think we must have been lucky to get two seats at the bar and probably would not have been so lucky if we actually needed a table. I think you are going to need a reservation most nights. Besides the drink, I've stopped in early in the morning for a cup of coffee on the way into the city. Yup, bar and bakery is an actual thing. They do it all. Can't wait to come back for another cocktail and actually stay for dinner this time.
2019-03-08,3,Had a ladies night here with the four of us. Made a reservation 2 weeks in advance. I have been here a couple of times and each time I felt it was overpriced and service was just ok. Pro: Food was fair, a bit salty but mostly enjoyable.Funky DrinksCool ambiance/decorCon: ExpensiveTight seating arrangementsExtraordinarily slow service
2019-03-08,2,I've been to this restaurant several times and up until last week I considered it to be one of the best restaurants in Hoboken.  The food is fantastic and the experience is one-of-a kind for the area.  My fiancé took me here last Friday to celebrate my 30th birthday and we could not have been more disappointed.  The service was ATROCIOUS, especially in comparison to previous experiences.  When our server finally showed up after a long wait, she rolled her eyes at our appetizer order because we only wanted garlic bread. For whatever reason we must have done something that pissed her off because from that point on it was like pulling teeth getting her to come to our table.It took almost an hour after we ordered before our food finally came out. I ordered a second glass of wine to go along with my entree.  Wine by the glass is $15-20 which seemed a bit excessive.  I wanted the wine to go along with my entree so I waited for her to come back...and waited..and waited. She was nowhere to be found so I started eating. My wine finally came out after I finished eating which is a real pet peeve, especially for a $17 glass of wine.I'm not going to knock the quality of food because as always, it was good.  The lobsta pasta is probably my favorite entree in Hoboken and it's easily worth the $52 price tag on a normal night.  For whatever reason it was half the size (particularly the lobster tail) and the breadcrumbs over the lobster were burnt. Again, it was good, but at $52 I really felt like I got robbed.  My fiancé ordered the seafood stew special which was really really good and flavorful.This is where things started to get weird.  We finished our meal and waited for the waitress to come back for our dessert order. And again, waited...and waited...and waited. We tried to make eye contact and flag her down but it almost seemed like she was avoiding us. It was almost an hour before she came to took our dessert order.  We ordered the bread pudding (which I highly recommend even though its way too much for 2 people).  While I was in the bathroom my fiancé spoke to the waitress and asked her if she could put a candle in the bread pudding.  When our waitress finally brought it out she forgot the candle.  Not the biggest deal in the world but definitely annoying.By the time we finally got the bill, we had been in the restaurant for just under 3 hours. The bill was wrong and she overcharged us for an additional glass of wine. She never once apologized and every interaction we had with her seemed like we were bothering her for being there.  And I'm sorry, 3 hours is entirely too long for a dinner for two.All told, I really do like this restaurant.  Some of these comments do seem a bit nit-picky, but the entire experience....the excessively long wait, the server's general rudeness, the smaller than usual entree, the lack of a birthday candle, just made for a very poor experience. And with a $190 price tag for a dinner for two...this level of service is frankly unacceptable.  Again, I really enjoy the food here but I doubt I will be back.  If I am paying that much money for dinner at a minimum I deserve to be treated with respect. There are plenty of great restaurants in Hoboken and this place is just way too expensive for what it actually is.
2019-03-02,4,Been here a few times, the food is always fantastic and the atmosphere - a 70s style basement is very unique and quirky for Hoboken. Just deducting 1 star as the service is really dependent on the server - have had amazing servers who were accommodating for food allergies (I'm Celiac) and other whos had no idea what the word Celiac meant... All in all bring out of town guests here as the food is delish!
2019-02-24,5,We celebrated our son's 27th birthday this evening at this amazing restaurant.  Our son works in the food industry, and really enjoyed watching the chef and others preparing the food.  Kat was our waitress, and she was great.  Each of the staff were so accommodating, and very pleasant.  The food.....it was simply out of this world.  We had 4 different appetizers - one was better than the next.  For our main dishes, we had lasagna, short rib and risotto, steak, and several side dishes - each was AMAZING.  Then...to top off this experience we had bread pudding, a delectable warm chocolate cookie with peanut butter, and a macaroon and chocolate shake!!  And did I mention the cocktails - again - just perfect!!  We will totally be back to this gem!!
2019-02-22,5,Love this place! Atmosphere and the music is awesome! A great date night spot with crafty cocktails and really good food. Been here several times with my boyfriend and friends and had a great experience each time. Kat was our waitress the last time we were there and she's fantastic! Definitely recommend!
2019-02-21,1,Terrible pasta. Salty fatty and not tasty. Also a very small portion. The appetizer was also terrible.
2019-02-18,3,Stopped by on Sunday afternoon for some drinks and lunch. We have been here a bunch and always was fascinated by the operation and the creativity behind the plates but have been disappointed by the service. The staff was friendly but very inexperienced, as there were drink tickets backing up and patrons dying of thirst. Could very well have been a day where the "Junior Varsity" was called in but if I was management I would try to reel this in as fast as possible. At one point I heard the bartender say we ran out of that, just give them this, they won't know the difference. This was referring to a bottle of wine a table ordered. YIKES...Overall the food was decent but shocked at what I was witnessing. I hope that management and PG recognize this shortcoming and make the necessary changes because Antique Bakery has a great reputation and I want that to continue.
2019-02-17,4,The cocktails and the overall vibe get this place 4 stars. Hoboken really needed a cool spot that knows how to mix a good cocktail. The food, in my experience, has been hit or miss. The first time I went, we got the half octopus special that blew me away, plus the cookie and ice cream dessert, and that experience left me thinking that I would be going to Antique on a weekly basis. But then the second time, half of my table's food was cold and the service was lackluster.  The cold food issue has been a repeat problem in subsequent visits. There is 5 star potential here with some minor adjustments.
2019-02-15,5,Best restaurant in Hoboken! We live across the street and Antique is our go to. Simply put- amazing food, amazing service. Have Grace or Ricky mix you a drink at the bar, you won't be disappointed. We usually just get an assortment of their delicious apps, but if you're looking for something more the ribeye is to die for. A super cool Hoboken spot, off the beaten path from the usual hot wings and beer spots.
2019-02-15,5,Amazing food (bread pudding is hands down the best dessert in Hoboken) and amazing cocktails (personal favorite is the my fate). The bartenders make you feel right at home, especially Grace and Jack. Will be coming back here all the time!! For sure
2019-02-13,5,We have lived in Hoboken for 4 years, blocks away, and have never stopped in! I am so glad we did!!! The inside of the restaurant is cozy, upbeat, urban 70s chic. We were seated at a high top by the kitchen (which is open and you can see them do their "thang"with this amazing coal oven they have!) The menu is stellar - we wanted to order EVERYTHING! The Boar Ragu was so tasty (like no other I've had) and lobster pasta did not disappoint! And be sure to save room for dessert - the bread pudding is OUT OF THIS WORLD! The service is top notch (you feel like you're part of the family) - our meals were hand delivered by the chef himself and our waitress, Alicia, made sure we had everything we wanted! It was the best "pre-Valentines Day" date night for my husband and I - romantic, cozy, and everything we never knew we were missing! We will most definitely be back soon!
2019-02-06,3,It was an hour and thirty min wait even after making a reservation. The service and food was amazing; however, the bartender charged us a bottle of wine that we did not drink. Make sure to check your bill at the end!
2019-02-03,4,Had drinks and dinner here on Friday evening. What a warm, cozy place. The staff was so friendly and knowledgeable! They have great cocktails and I was so happy that they used Fever Tree Tonic! Our waitress was passionate about the food and everything was delicious. Only 4 stars because service was a little rushed and prices a bit high. Also, I prefer to drink wine from a wine glass.
2019-01-30,5,I really enjoyed this eatery! The unique oven that the food is prepared in is a wonder in and of itself. We had a vast sampling of about 8 dishes but I would have to say the 32 oz rib eye was the best and did not disappoint. The prawns would have had to have been a close second. I am not a pork eater but my friends had the ribs that were cooked in banana leaves which they said added a flavorful twist. The whole garlics and lemons charred for garnish were even delicious. The wine pairings were great as well. We started with a Prosecco with the seafood appetizers and moved to a white and ended with a smooth red when the rib eye arrived. For dessert there was a chocolate peanut butter cake that I found hard to resist even though I am on a low carb no sugar diet. The place was pretty loud and also dark which gave it more of a lounge feeling. By the end of the night there was a dj playing great music and a dancer decked out in full Afro and hot pants dancing on the front bar. It was a very fun atmosphere. I'm not sure if it's more intimate on other nights but I can appreciate more upbeat surroundings every once in a while.
2019-01-30,5,We hosted a private event at the Loft space (event space owned but Antique bar and bakery at 33 Newark) last week for my husbands surprise 50th.  Not only were they incredibly accommodating and hospitable but the food was amazing.  The space is breathtaking, it's the Penthouse of the building.  Exposed very high ceilings, floor to ceiling windows, a wrap around balcony with direct NYC views.  In my option it is by far the nicest private event space in Hoboken.  The event was customized and she was great about working within my vision of food, timeline, and even helped implement all of my little extras (photo booth, balloons, floral, signs etc).  I'd highly recommend Kelli and the space and would absolutely host there again.
2019-01-28,4,First time here - had a great brunch with friends everyone got a taste of something different! The shared breadbasket was delicious!! Our waitress was very pleasant although a bit quick to take your plate and glass.  Their version of a Bloody Mary called the burnt Mary could use a bit more flavor.  Mimosa was good.  Atmosphere and decor really great. We'll be back!
2019-01-26,3,I came here once just for drinks and they were good. This time though we came for brunch and I ordered the dirty burger. It looked really good, but it tasted pretty bland. The burger meat was not seasoned at all, and the only thing on the burger was the grated cheese, which looks like a lot, but it's actually a tiny amount which you can barely taste. I kind of liked the chewy toasted bun, but it just wasn't enough to elevate the burger. The fries were a bit better, slightly spicy, but again not seasoned nearly enough for my taste. So, yeah this is basically just a review for the burger.
2019-01-26,5,Very interesting place. The food is good. Ambiance is nice. Service is OK. Drinks are OK.
2019-01-25,1,Called and made a reservation for this weekend. I was told on the phone by the gentleman who took our reservation that someone would call me today to confirm. When I made the reservation he took down my name and number and all of my information. No one ever called to confirm, so I called them the day of and they told me they didn't have any record of the reservation and couldn't do anything about it. That is such poor customer service. How are you ever supposed to know that your reservation was ever really made? Not even going to bother with this place now
2019-01-23,5,Super cool and trendy is the most appropriate description for this place. The food is definitely their strong point. Everything coming out of that kitchen is bound to hit the taste buds at the right places. The decor and ambience is perfect for a Friday evening. Especially the dj (on Friday) is extraordinary.
2019-01-22,5,Went out for sunday brunch with my girlfriend here. Food was absolutely amazing with entertaining flavors in each bite. The wait staff was very attentive (my water glass was never empty even when i tried to chug it on purpose to test them) also had a cappuccino which remained steaming hot for a very long time. Highly recommended place. Also saw a table bring their own champagne and order orange juice for mimosas which was a genius idea . Will definitely keep that in mind for when i return
2019-01-20,5,Really amazing food in a cute corner of hoboken! All the drinks have fresh squeezed juice for their cocktails and the bread basket was to die for!I highly recommend brunch great sauces and variety of fun yummy things to eat
2019-01-18,2,This is probably the most overrated place in Hoboken. After hearing all of the hype around Antique I was expecting something incredible but it was extremely below average. Even with a reservation we waited 20 minutes for our table. The hosts were very nice and accommodating but the overall service was terrible. 3 hours from when we walked in until we left. The food was nothing to write home about and the only highlight was the mussels appetizer and bread. The plum and mozzarella appetizers was TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS. It tasted like Polly O string cheese covered in jelly. Mussels 8.4/10Bread 7.8/10Mozzarella and Plum appetizer 2.5/10Herb Steak 5.4/10Cannoli Sundae 6.1/10Boar Ragu 6.1/10If you want to overpay for a below average meal then Antique is the perfect place to go.
2019-01-17,5,Andremontique and Kimberly were one nothing but amazing the food was amazing And the ambiance was great! Can't wait to come again!  This place is a must!
2019-01-13,1,I wanted to like this place but after my 5th time here I have to say the service is ABYSMAL. We were 5 minutes late for our 9:15 reservation ( bc the last 4 times I went I waited at LEAST a half hour for my table) and they said we will TRY to seat you - like they are doing me a huge favor. 35 minutes later we sit down to find so many items we wanted were sold out. After another 30 minutes we get our appetizer, then another hour and a half our dinner finally comes. Everyone around us was complaining about the awful slow service when finally the waitress says the ovens were out. Excuse me? You couldn't tell us that earlier? And there was no manager or owner on site to complain to. The girls next to us raised such a fuss and had their entire meal comped. Finally when we are done with dinner at MIDNIGHT the waitress casually tells me they can't find my credit card and the staff is pointing fingers are each other and acting like it's no big deal. NEVER going here again. Don't go if you have a babysitter you'll be spending a fortune.
2019-01-12,3,Went to the Antique Bakery tonight with another couple. Food and atmosphere was excellent. I'm ok with the cramped seating. Actually like it. Had an 8:30 reservation, was seated at 9:10. Ok with that too. Had a few libations waiting for our table. Here is why I gave the Antique Bakery 3 stars. Plain and simple, appetizers came out 40 minutes after we sat and dinner came out at 11pm. Unacceptable.. at that point we ate dinner in 5 minutes, got the check and skipped the dessert. Maybe this was the exception. Not sure, first time there. Again food was excellent. Just couldn't enjoy it..Bill Segulin
2019-01-10,3,Was looking forward to brunch here, but our group left disappointed. Service was slow, unfriendly at times and drinks took too long to arrive, mine was forgotten twice. We were sat right next to the kitchen which we liked. Sticky bun is great... but we had to chase it up twice (to be fair, they took it off the bill which was generous). Not really a typical brunch menu and minimal options for vegetarians, I had the sweet potato and beet hash which was burnt and smothered it yogurt over rock hard eggs, others in our group had small portions and weren't impressed. Also charging NYC prices - overpriced, especially the cocktails, $14! The sticky bun did save the experience but we won't come back, shame as it's so close to our apartment.
2019-01-10,5,This place is expensive, but it really is a treat.  It is just fun to be in there, although they really do have some good tables, as well as some bad tables.  My wife and I really enjoyed the dirty shrimp and the roasted chicken, so decadent!  It actually is fairly simple cooking, and it makes me want to take cooking for myself more seriously.  Our last visit was last night, and everything was perfect except for the yahoos at the adjacent table.  It was a husband and wife, and the wife was really running that poor server ragged.  She had endless questions, special requests, and complained about everything.  She kept saying that the food was cold, while her husband apologized to the server and clearly felt bad.  I felt bad for the server, her husband, and honestly for myself for having to endure her.  Some people just don't know that they are obnoxious.  She also kept telling that idiotic "See Food" joke.  You know the one where you ask someone, "Do you like seafood?"  And when he says "yes," you say "See Food" while showing the other person your mouthful of food?  She did that 4 times!!!  Four times!!!  The first two times the husband gave her courtesy laughs, the third time, he didn't answer, and she did it anyway.  The fourth time he curtly said "No, I do not like seafood," and she still did it!!!!   Looking back, maybe I am just being a grouch and I should have appreciated this as an amusing night out.So, that was a random one-off experience.  I definitely recommend Antique Bar and Bakery.
2019-01-10,1,Yesterday, my husband and I visited this bar, and unfortunately I can not advise this place.                we ordered 3 appetizers and one main course.   The first apetizer (mozzarella) was brought in 1 hour. and here is a surprise, it was cold, although it should have been at least warm. we said that the waiter that waited so long, and hungry, but it is cold. the administrator came and apologized, we were brought in 10 minutes later another plate with a warm snack (father-in-law can cook this dish in 10 minutes, not in an hour). The main course with other snacks was brought in an 1 hour 20 min. I have never seen such service anywhere, honestly. at the expense of prices, I will say that they are too high for this place. food tastes average, but prices are not justified, and if you are ready to wait for food for half your evening, then you decide.
2019-01-03,4,Fun lively atmosphere with great food. We had the fish special and shrimp appetizer both were amazing, full of flavor and cooked to perfection.
2019-01-02,5,In love for so many reasons ... 1. The service and staff - incredibly energetic, passionate and helpful. 2. Ambiance - warm and contemporary. 3. BREAD PUDDING!!!! Ok so yes we had other great dishes here including the mussels which were bathed in an incredible garlic herb lemon sauce. Branzino and steak were also great but again BREAD PUDDING. New obsession found.
2019-01-01,5,Excellent food! Great bread and the desserts are phenomenal. The front of house is a fun charming gentlemen too.
2018-12-31,5,I love absolutely everything about this place. The cocktails are always creative and delicious. Food is on another level, the chef is always changing up the specials and every single thing I've had there has been out of this world. Definitely worth the price, and all the servers and bartenders I've had have been sweethearts.
2018-12-30,5,Girlfriend and I hit Antique last night for her birthday, which we did last year as well, and they never disappoint. Thanks chef Paul for coming over to greet us and hooking us up with some apps on the house!! If you are lucky enough to sit in the kitchen area, you will get to watch chef gio and the crew work there magic. Order the "my fate", the mozz, shishito peppers, beef cheek parm, honestly anything here is great!! We had amazing service from Kimberly, who understands every ingredient on each dish and really recommends the best! We'll be back for happy hour next week!
2018-12-26,5,Best bread I have ever had. From the stuffed to the simple Italian bread... this place is delicious. Owners and services are always a pleasure. If you get there earlier enough the bread is still warm!! Best place around!!
2018-12-22,4,The food is excellent and the atmosphere is fantastic. We took out 18-month old daughter and she had a great time as well. My wife's carbonara was the best she's ever had in the states. The only caveat is it's a little pricey, so expect your dinner to be near NYC prices for a trendy restaurant. But it's worth it every once in a while.
2018-12-19,4,Antique Bar and Bakery is a place I had wanted to try since moving to Hoboken. We got the chance to go for brunch and it did not live up to the full hype that I was expecting. That being said, the food we did get was good, however they were sold out of the burger and we had to revise our order. It has a nice ambience and we will give it another shot for dinner.
2018-12-15,5,BEST FOOD IN HOBOKENThis place is NOT to miss. If you want KILLER food and AMAZING service you should go here. Also their Christmas cocktails are spectacular. I can't say enough about this place. I've been here twice and each time was so memorable and delicious. It's the type of place you find yourself saying "I can't wait to go back there!" It's definitely a little pricey... so prepare for that. My only callout is that the 40oz steak was a little fatty - I wish it was trimmed a bit more - but I get it, they want to retain moisture and FLAVOR. Everything tastes REAL and clean - everything has such unique flavor. PLEASE GIVE ME DIRTY LEMON ON EVERYTHING and that roasted garlic!!!!!! Shout out to Kimberlee the and Andre the maître d' who TRULY went above and beyond to make our experience extra special. I really feel like I'm part of the neighborhood when I go to this historic gem... I'm proud to have a place like this in my neighborhood. Keep up the good work ABB team!! xoxo
2018-12-11,4,I know there are mixed reviews here mostly based around the expense for the quality. This restaurant is a whole experience and the creativity that goes into the atmosphere, decor, menu, and dishes is something to appreciate. I've visited more than once and enjoy the occasional splurge just because of the thought that goes into each dish, which is always new as the menu rotates per season. I recommend for a fun date night or group dinner with friends so long that everyone is ready for that splurge too!
2018-12-05,5,I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. Antique Bar and Bakery is my absolute very favorite - and also most frequented - restaurant in New Jersey. Whether you're coming here for brunch with your parents, dinner with friends, or drinks on a date, Antique totally kills it. Every time someone comes to visit me from out of town (my parents, my siblings, my fiance's family, my friends from France, friends from California, friends from Texas and, most importantly, all of my friends from NYC), I make sure to drag them here.  We always get the spaghetti squash carbonara, whatever is a special for that day, the lobsta pasta, the broccoli rabe, and the beef cheek parm. The specials are always killer. My favorites have been their giant plate of crabs with homemade linguini (unbelievably good - I cannot wait for summer and for them to make this again), the calamari, and the octopus (my fiance has been talking about this for weeks now). If they have fresh mutz as a special, order it. We've also loved the french toast, the cinnamon rolls (OMG), and the dirty cookie (worth the wait x100000). We really loved the elvis sundae they made back when they first opened, hoping to see that back on the menu as a special sometime in the future...The Johnny Friendly cocktail (the one with bourbon, ginger, and lemon) is my favorite cocktail here, but you can't go wrong trying whatever special drink they have on a given day. I recently had their cocktail with apple cider and bourbon and that was excellent. Not only is the food amazing and the drinks are incredible, but the vibe is just so enjoyable. Very 70s inspired (my favorite) decor and the best playlist on the planet. Everyone who I've taken here for dinner or drinks has commented that the space and vibe is just so cool and I totally agree. If you live in Hoboken, you really need to visit this place. If you're visiting from out of town, just grab an uber or park in a lot nearby and walk over. Don't be afraid to try something new and a little charred.
2018-12-05,4,This place is so great. Everything from the cocktails to the food to the ambience. I wish we had more restaurants like this in Hoboken instead of more and more fast casual or sports bars. I haven't tried anything that I didn't like here. If you go make a reservation or at least call in advance to check the wait and be prepared to spend some money, your meal won't be cheap but it's definitely worth checking out.
2018-12-02,5,Just went for brunch and had a great experience. We arrived a couple minutes before they opened on a Sunday morning and they seated us right away and were super friendly despite not quite being open. Atmosphere and service was wonderful, food was excellent with generous portions. History of the place is really interesting, will definitely return.
2018-11-28,4,Great cocktails and amazing ambiance. It was definitely a plus that our waitress knew and told us the history of the establishment. Apps are top notch. I recommend the shishito peppers and anything with cheese. I wish the prices were a bit better. This is a true hidden gem.
2018-11-21,5,Def a go to spot.    Not many great higher end fun spots in Hoboken.  This one differentiates itself.    Great vibe, awesome food, cocktails and service (shout out to Kimberly).    Will be back
2018-11-19,2,We came on a night when the weather was not cooperating so maybe they weren't at their best.  Either way, the appetizers were good, the shrimp is a great dish.  We ordered the steak for 2 which had a MP next to it.  We didn't expect to pay $125 for it however!!  That is WAY overpriced for any steak for 2, anywhere, period.  Let alone in Hoboken.  Furthermore, there were some weird grainy particles in the steak dish that we could not figure out.  We asked the waitress and she said that it could be grizzle from the bone, seems odd to me.  The dish wasn't right.  We felt like we were eating sand.  I would love to give this place another chance but the the prices are WAYYYYYYY too high for what it is and it's location.
2018-11-12,5,Amazing service and delicious food cat was my waitress she is a doll. The atmosphere was so homey and cozy.
2018-11-11,5,Grace and Kat were so welcoming! They chatted with us, recommended drinks to us, and made us the BEST drinks I have ever had! Never been disappointed with the service! Recommend to anyone for good food and a relaxed evening!
2018-11-11,2,- expensive for what it is ( 2 people mains and shared apptezier one glass of wine for $68)- on a Sunday at 1pm 20% of their menu was unavailable/sold out (all protein sold out, no chicken no beef no fish) - thoroughly burnt the hash & room temp mushroom balls
2018-11-10,5,Dear Yelpers, If i know you well enough by now, you are always after a hidden gem! When you are visiting New York, if you want to stick with Soho for good food, you are not a real yelper yet:) When we were looking for a place where we could have a food orgasm, i happened to find this almost secret place in New Jersey side, Hoboken.On their website, please watch the chef's video, it'll give you some idea about his character, and his food. On a rainy Friday night, We started with the Greek fries, and mussels (see the photos) the Greek fries had some goat cheese on it and some herb but was not crispy enough for my taste. The mussels were heavenly and i must say that the sauce was even better than i had in France! They bring a nice freshly baked bread with it and you can dip in that amazing sauce and have a gut orgasm there! I couldn't stop smelling the plate. That is a must-order guys, no pass on that! As a main course, we had half of a chicken that came with herb sauce, and steak with another special sauce,  these guys know how to play with herbs let me tell you! The trick is the giant oven they have there! And the good part is, if you sit right next to where the kitchen is, you can be a part of the show! There was one guy there cooking and dancing at the same time, i thought there is a reason why the food is this good, because the staff enjoy what they are doing. The chef must have hired the crazy guys to make a good team! They also brought us their freshly made mozzarella with a special touch! I'm not going to give all the details here not to share their secret recipes:) you must go and try yourself and be prepared for the surprises! They have daily specialties (or for the weekends) besides the menu. They had a nice octopus that came from Spain, but we wanted to try to meat first so skipped that. I'm very curious though, cooking octopus is tricky, i had the most amazing ones in Sardinia island and Aegean coast of Turkey so I would be super critical there, i passed! I wasn't impressed by their wine (as a vino) menu but beers were amazing! If this was my main food critics blog i would mention a few minor improvements for the meals but not here! Becoz this place deserves a 5 star! Ambiance is very rustic and also romantic, insist to sit near the kitchen, and be part of the ceremony.Oh cant pass this part, The host was amazing and made us feel very special! Thank you Andre! Send the Michelin guys over there! Check it out!  CheersAsli,
2018-11-08,5,The favorite bar and restaurant of my wife and me in Hoboken. We have always had great food and service and will continue to eat and drink there any chance we get.
2018-11-01,5,Man, what a great dinner. One of the best nights out in a while. Got to try a bunch of dishes from the menu and only had one complaint, which is as good as you can ask for. First and most important: the dry rub steak. Oh man. Ordered it thinking the waitress was recommending it in part because it was pricey but damn was it good. Definitely the best thing I ate that night. Juicy, cooked just right, and seasoned so well. Highest of recommendation since I'm still thinking about it the next day. The  whole chicken is very good, too, and spiced ao well that it makes chicken tastes good. The lasagna ends was a nice meal too if you're with or are someone who wants to avoid meat for the night. As for the starters:-- Yes on the mussels -- The fresh baked bread, with different toppings is nice and comes with marinara-- The cheesy cauliflower is cheesy and buttery and good-- The brussel sprouts were the only miss because of the seasoning
2018-10-23,5,It feels more like Brooklyn than Brooklyn! Had brunch there this past Sunday with my wife and friends and I must say we were impressed!  The rustic vibe of the open kitchen and the glow from the large bakery oven that takes up an entire wall with beautifully prepared dishes being whisked to their tables makes this place a must try spot in Hoboken!  Just remember to save room for dessert! You won't be sorry.
2018-10-21,2,We really wanted to say great things about this restaurant-had heard about it for awhile and made our maiden visit this weekend-  but we cannot.  It certainly is 'good', but not exceptional. Certainly not as good as the postings. The vibe is cool- not as loud as we were warned- lots of 80s music, kinda cool.   We had the riceballs(came out cold), arugula salad (WAY too much cheese), hanger steak ( sooo small. was it really a steak???), cavatelli (VERY good). What was bad?  SERVICE!  SERVICE!!!!Way long to get server after we sat down. Wayyyy too long for drinks.  Mentioned to server riceballs were cold, said would get waiter-never came.  Then suddenly entrees came before apps were done and no room on table.  Server asked if we were done and took dish before we could say no. Oh- the bread came AFTER we got the check($145 plus tip for a disappointing dinner).You are paying for the vibe here - not the food or service.  Lots of better food options in Boken.
2018-10-13,5,The food was amazing. The atmosphere is comfortable, homey. The service was fantastic, Kimberly did great. They messed up and delivered Cavatelli with the meat when we asked without meat specifically, but then brought out a new one without meat and took it off the bill instantly. Steak was very tasty too. Will come by if in the area again.
2018-10-10,5,This is a very small restaurant but it's cool great vibe great food just watch the bill at the end make sure that they don't overcharge you for things that you didn't actually get .. I went with 14 people , wouldn't recommend going with this money I would say 6 to8 tops like I said because it's small you will be more comfortableBut you should definitely try I don't think you'll be disappointed
2018-10-05,5,This place is way better than many places in the city! Is so unique and amazing! Also the food is unbelievable.. definitely recommended
2018-09-30,2,I don't like leaving negative reviews but I can't keep this one to myself. We had a Sunday 10amBrunch reservation - we entered at 10 and staff was confused and disorganized. Took 5 min to get seated in an empty restaurant. Took another 5 minutes to get menus which were were told were not updated. Some items not available. Waitress barely explained which items these were. We first ordered a donut from the front case to hold us over as we had a feeling this would take a while- it never arrived- asked for it 3 more times at least. Waitress was running back and forth for three tables like it was a packed restaurant. We overheard the table next to us send their cocktail back twice for being made incorrectly. Donut finally arrived- looked much better than it tasted. Food finally arrived - 45 minutes later. Eggs baked in tomato w/ garlic bread and the pulled pork. Both very good but the disjointed service and inconsistency of it all clouded the whole experience and we won't be back anytime soon. Oh and incorrect change was given to us - had to ask for the change twice after we paid and it was wrong. Also -- $14 for mediocre Bloody Mary is a joke!
2018-09-28,5,My husband and I just moved to Hoboken and we live right down the street from this place so it was one of the first places in Hoboken we tried. It is by far the best restaurant food and atmosphere wise in the area. I am from Italy and it is hard for me to find restaurants that remind me of places back home but Antique Bakery has such unique and delicious dishes, good service, it is definitely a place you need to try!
2018-09-23,5,We love it here. It is pricey but there's nothing like it. If they have the mozzarella special its a must have. My husband lives for the dirty oil shrimp. I love all the pastas, the lobster pasta doesn't disappoint. We have had every main and always are happy. The bread pudding is another necessity.
2018-09-21,5,Came here for the first time the other night and was really pleased. I sat at the bar and the bartender ( lenny) was welcoming and really helpful in suggesting drinks/ food. Everything was delicious. I'll definitely be back!
2018-09-16,2,We came in at 8:30, by 9 the bartender left and there was no other bartender available...their website says they are open until 12 on Sundays. There were others dining and the rest of the staff tried to rush them out. Very strange....
2018-09-13,5,This is probably my favorite place in this city. We celebrated my wedding with 6 people, it was amazing.Thank you for making our dinner special.the staff are incredible, fun and friendly.
2018-09-11,5,Fantastic!!! Came here on a wimb and will certainly return. Fantastic drinks, food, & service. 10/10
2018-09-11,5,What an amazing experience!!!  The cocktails, culinary delights, and service were superb!!!  Absolutely one of the best meals I've had recently.  The fresh home made ravioli special was delectable!  We started with the Hottest Oil Shrimp - seriously get it!!!  Kimberly, our server, was knowledge, efficient, and made perfect recommendations!  10/10
2018-09-04,5,Hidden gem in Hoboken. Feel good music along with feel good food. Mussels are a must!
2018-09-03,1,Avoid this place at all costs. Poor service, overpriced and extremely mediocre food. Ordered a $100+ steak and it was extremely small and mostly fat. It was not a good cut. My girlfriend and I are foodies and value a good meal and a good experience and the waitress was completely rude and unprofessional.
2018-09-01,4,Have been wanting to try this place for a while and finally was able to get here for a dinner with the guys.  We got a table right in the middle of the room and place was incredibly lively with great music.  Christine was very attentive, friendly and helpful with our menu choices.  We pretty much had one of everything on the menu and shared family style ... the winners were definitely the 40oz bone in rib eye cooked in the 100 year old wood burning oven ... close second was the bucatini pasta with lobster.  Even though we were stuffed, had to try the famous Antique Bread Pudding and Dirty Chocolate Cake.  All-in-all, a great meeting place with a ton of energy.
2018-08-28,1,Went for a girls night out.. we all work in the live in the city and came to meet up with a friend who lives in Hoboken for dinner and drinks. The service was absolutely terrible. If it weren't for the great company, I would've gotten up and left. We should've gone elsewhere around Hoboken or just stayed in the city... Avoid.
2018-08-23,5,Unbelievably impressed by the food, service, and atmosphere at Antique Bar & Bakery. We got a bunch of apps to share, all of which were delicious. Great drink specials (the bartenders are AMAZING). And the cookie dessert is to die for. Special shout out to Kimberly for being a great waitress, very insightful and kind. Will definitely come back again!!
2018-08-19,5,Service was excellent as always. Cristine is always a delight when I dine here, Her recommendations are always on point. Drinks are hand crafted by the lovely Grace can't go wrong another hidden gem in Hoboken. Go for the Ribeye never disappoints!!!
2018-08-19,2,So this spot is pretty cool and a good vibe, love the 70's theme and feel. However , I feel this place is extremely overpriced.  Went here for a drink w my wife and two small dishes to pick on.   I had an Aperol spritz and she had a cocktail.   Then had a very small broccoli salad and rice balls, $65 , really!!  A few pieces of broccoli for $15, slightly insane, I mean it's a small side dish wtf. Sorry but overrated and overpriced.
2018-08-17,5,Great food, great vide and excellent service! Kimberly was our waitress and she was great! My mom has a food allergy to garlic (which is not an easy allergy to accommodate!) and she was very attentive and engaging with a great sense of humor. She not only gave great recommendations but also helped us to figure out what could be made without garlic. The food was very tasty and interesting combinations- would highly recommend the shrimp! It's a little on the expensive side, but worth it if you're going for nice night out. We will definitely be back!
2018-08-16,5,We can't rave enough about the hot oil and charred veggie goodness at this restaurant. It is super cool atmosphere. There are always healthy options. The hanger steak is tender and memorable. We can't wait to return.
2018-08-16,5,I LOVE this place. Old-school, classic, screenplay vibes throughout. Amazing food. Delicious/unique cocktails. The portions are small (sort of like tapas), so make sure to order a bunch of different things! Everything I've ever had here has been fantastic. Whenever someone asks me to recommend a restaurant in Hoboken, I always tell them to come here! Everyone that I've sent, has loved it just as much as I do!
2018-08-15,5,Absolutely phenomenal! I haven't had a meal that incredible in a while. Definitely one of the best restaurants I've been in Hudson County and beyond. Every single morsel beyond delicious! I can't say enough! Seriously, a tastebud extravaganza! The cozy atmosphere and fantastic lighting an added bonus. Drinks fantastic as well!Waitresses Christine and Kat amazing!!Paul owner/chef so warm and accommodating. Love Antique bar and Bakery!!! You have to go!Thanks for wonderful experience!Warmest regards,Wayne
2018-08-13,5,Damn Antique... you really got a hold on me..  (Smokey Robinson & The Miracles harmonizes in the background) This GEM in Hoboken has the most unique decor and approach. My strong opinion is that they are true winners in this cookie cutter town.From their ever changing, locally picked, handwritten - directed and executed menu to their cleverly named delicious cocktails -- I fell in love the second I walked in and felt the antique vibes take over my very soul. I won't get into much detail over their menu since they do have rotating specials but I will have you know that I had the BEST. LAMB. RAGU....of my life while sitting next to their 1000 degree burning oven -  roasting away, salivating over every dish that was ushered out of their open kitchen. Chef Paul has the upmost passion for his craft and not only does it show, but it shines through as it's executed from his table to yours. Their desserts are award winning and sicker than your average boxed tiramisu and frozen cakes you'd typically get from other establishments in town. Without digging deeper, I'd highly recommend making a reservation and heading there with an empty stomach and trusting the waitstaff to lead you into their menu and tastebuds - as everything they recommend will not be a disappointmenWhat I will say and end this review on - is -- when I tell you to go for that housemade LAMB RAGU - trust me...because it's so dreamy and creamy that ... I'm on my way now...(End Script)
2018-08-12,5,Cristina is amazing.  Give her your "I'd like" and she'll create you something to die for.  Fabulous cocktails.  Classics you will never match.
2018-08-07,4,Been here about 4/5 times and thought it was really good! For some reason the first time it was out of this world good, but it is a great meal. Love everything from drinks to lasagna edges to cookie dessert to the vibes. I also enjoy just stopping in and having a drink at the bar. Great addition to our neighborhood.. we really needed it!
2018-08-06,4,The food was excellent and the service was wonderful too. We had the mussels and their divine pesto garlic bread, such a treat! We were a party of 3, and shared the items I mentioned just fine. The drinks were also delicious. According to the previous reviews, it seems we were lucky with being seated fairly quickly. The hostesses were kind and friendly, we were seated within 10 minutes of arriving. I do not think I will make a reservation next time I try to visit, as it seems they do not really honor the times. Also, the music is a perfect contribution to the atmosphere of the restaurant. What a great touch, looking forward to strolling by again soon.
2018-08-05,5,Quite possibly the best meal I've had in the NYC area.  The service, ambiance, and food were all best in class.  A true gem in Hoboken!
2018-08-02,5,I went there last night for my anniversary.  My boyfriend was running late (as usual) and I was offered a glass of water while I waited at the hostess stand to ensure I was comfortable. We were seated at a table right near the open kitchen and were treated with "Chef's table" level service. The chef provided us with a sampling of some delicious steak. We enjoyed rice balls, decadent stuffed bread, and delightful pasta. When we were too full for dessert our server still brought us the yummiest complimentary gelato since they knew we were celebrating. The staff all seemed to love their job and all wished us a happy anniversary as we exited. The atomoshere is cozy and interesting, the food is fresh, delicious and unique and the service is stellar. We also loved that they had local brewery Departed Soles on draft. It was a nice touch. While it may be a bit of a splurge for most it is wonderful for a special occasion or a "treat yo self" evening.  It is a wonderful reimagining of a Hoboken staple and somewhere everyone should checkout.
2018-08-01,5,Just had one of the best dinners imaginable FridayThe food was excellent and service just as good. Very friendly atmosphere.  A must try is the ribeye steak and grill shrimp.I would most definitely recommend a visit. Wish I could give 6 stars
2018-07-31,5,This was the first place I've visited in Hoboken. My friends have been RAVING about it. The food was amazing. They were going a special tapas menu for the night- to die for! The bartenders, grace and Christina were so attentive and friendly. Such a cute place! 10/10 would recommend. I will be coming back soon
2018-07-30,3,Came here for Father's Day on a Sunday and made a reservation. The bread is amazing! I was not too fond of the food, ordered frittata and we waited a long time for it to come out. Maybe they were backed up because it was Father's Day. If I didn't have to wait so long I may give this place 4 stars for the ambiance as it feels like a speakeasy and they had live band on Sunday. I loved the 50s decor and how was they decorated the place. Small to fit a stroller but they do have high chairs.I think the drinks were a bit pricey along with food but worth checking out.
2018-07-27,5,I have been following this restaurant on Instagram since it opened!  Photos of food are amazing!  Finally got to go tonight with other family members to celebrate my birthday!  The food is so uniquely prepared and the taste is great!!!  I truly enjoyed every plate I tasted!  This restaurant is definitely a must if you are in the Hoboken area!
2018-07-25,5,Great meal and incredible service. Kara gave great suggestions, she was personable and genuine. Food was delicious. We ordered way too much but ate it all!! Hand pulled mozzarella with grilled peaches, lasagna edges, ribeye, and Greek fries- can't go wrong. Bring your appetite!
2018-07-23,5,The first time I went to Antique I met a friend for drinks and LOVED the atmosphere. The bar staff is knowledgeable and fun! I then went back with my boyfriend for his birthday dinner and had one of the best meals we have had in a long time. The killer garlic bread and kale pasta with sausage were perfect. The octopus was cooked perfectly, which from experience I know is difficult! We also had the rice balls  and the hot oil shrimp which were delicious. We finished with the best birthday dessert, the dirty chocolate cake! Looking forward to coming again.
2018-07-23,5,My friends and I made the greatest decision last Wednesday night to go to Hoboken instead  of Brooklyn for dinner! We try and have as many dinners out of the city as we can..always trying to find hidden gems and this is definitely one of them. The service was great...our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly and the food was absolutely outstanding. From the spaghetti squash carbonara to the pasta with lobster and one of the best steaks I have ever had in my life! We forced ourselves to have dessert despite being stuffed and had the chocolate chip cookie and the cannoli sundae..both amazing. The restaurant itself has a great vibe...the decor is very cool..the walls are covered with awesome photographs and movie posters. The check was on par with Manhattan restaurant prices but to be honest you get what you pay for and it was well worth it! We will definitely go back!
2018-07-18,5,We had an OUTSTANDING dinner tonight at Antique! Not just delicious seafood, but also cooked in ways I've never had before, most notably the Hot Oil Shrimp (not just 'hot-spicy' but also 'hot-hot' -- the oil is still bubbling when your dish is served at your table!) The wait-staff is always great there, and a very fun atmosphere helped by esoteric 60s music and vintage posters on the wall ranging from very young Robert De Niro to Peter Fonda (from 2 different films!) to Pattie Smith.
2018-07-14,5,I've lived in Hoboken for 6 years and I've never experienced the food and hospitality that Is antique. Every time I eatHere or stop in for a nightcap, the staff is welcoming and fun. You can tell everyone is passionate about what they are doing. Food is amazing. Drinks are amazing. What else do you need? Props to chef Paul and his team.
2018-07-14,5,A hidden gem in Hoboken. A really unique, fun eclectic dining experience. You do not feel like you're in Hoboken, it has almost a hipster, Brooklyn vibe.As far as the food, everything was amazing. Shared a few apps: Buffalo mozzarella with apricot and the Spicy garlic shrimp, both paired with char-grilled bread for dipping. They are known for their bread but is not made in house. I tried the prosciutto stuffed bread, it was good but the other apps were better.For my main, I had the lobster pasta and they were not stingy with the lobster. Really flavorful, and garlicky, and sooo much lobsta. Highly recommend! Was too full for dessert. They have a sexy, cool bar area. I'd come back again just for drinks and apps.
2018-06-30,5,Excellent food, excellent service, great music, ambiance is on point! We need more places like this in Hoboken.
2018-06-30,5,My boyfriend and I love this place. Great vibe, food (and drinks) and service. You can tell they put a lot of work into what they do and care about their customers! Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great unique place in Hoboken.
2018-06-25,5,My favorite spot to take a date. Food is always incredible and drinks are even better.  Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a cool, unique vibe.  Music is great, staff extremely friendly... best food in Hoboken no question.
2018-06-25,5,Awesome experince friday night. The food was out of this world. The music was perfect ambience was like a time travel to the cool ages of soul and funk music. and that bread pudding dessert is to die for.. Great for a first date to break the ice to meeting someone and showing them a great time !!!!!
2018-06-25,5,There's no other place in Hoboken quite like antique. There's always something going on there. Their peanut butter cookie dessert is out of this world. Everyone that works there offers warm hospitality and the owners/managers have been super cool when I've seen them on the floor. This place is everything a small business should be and a great place to represent and have in Hoboken.
2018-06-23,5,I recently was visiting my brother on the Lower East Side and he mentioned this place in Hoboken has the best steaks. I am not a huge meat eater I lean toward veges and fish but he insisted the steak was worth tasting. I said it better be if we are gong over to Hoboken. The trip over was closer than heading up to the upper east side and the vibe was much cooler than i remember Hoboken was in the 80s when i worked in Jersey City. We arrived about 8 30 and the place was very cool, I enjoyed the feel quite a bit. I favor older buildings that have some history which this place has. The server was attentive not overbearing especially when I ordered tap water. Told her I would make it up with all the food I would order my lack of drinking. We ordered a few appetizers but remember we came for the steak and the steak we got was cooked to perfection (fired) I mean. The place has a 30 ton oven I think that uses coal to cook the food so in essence the Chef is cooking with Fire. The steak really was amazing. I have been to Ruth Chris at least 10 times Smith and Wollensky over 100 times, use to be a regular for several years and slipped in a few visits to Shula's as well. All of their steaks are highly respectable but they typically all fall along the same line of flavor, with Antique it was different the flavor the presentation the tenderness I mean as much as I myself yearn to want to be a vegan it's a steak like this that throws me off the rails. If I lived up here in Hoboken or even in Manhattan I would find myself  falling off the red meat wagon and doing pounds of this steak. Thank God I am back in Atlanta the home of Longhorns and Outback I am safe at least for while. My brother was right which I hate to say best steak I ever had. I left a good tip and took into account the amount of waters I had.
2018-06-23,5,Always such a wonderful meal! At times can be a long wait for food but so worth it! Also very accommodating for food sensitivities like gluten for celiacs
2018-06-15,5,Unreal atmosphere. Our server Kimberly was an incredible waitress and hostess. She treated us extremely well and I can't wait to come back!!
2018-06-09,5,Great drinks! Great food! Great people! Cristina made my night! She made me and my friends amazing cocktails the entire night. Ask for the Natalie!!
2018-06-09,5,Cristina is the best bartender I have ever seen!!!! Great food, excellent service! Pride of Hoboken!
2018-06-04,2,I'm gonna second the "addiction clinic" with over priced hospital food. The first time I went, we sat at a table and our waitress was sweet, attentive and very fun. I thought it was cool that uniform allowed her curly hair to be out and shown off, she had great hair haha. The drinks, not so great. They tasted like roses lime juice and cheap liquor. Food was hot which was a plus considering how long it took to get it, but not worth the wait. We went back again this past weekend and our fav waitress wasn't there, instead we got one that seemed to be more interested in Instagram selfies than making money. Maybe the third time will make up for it.
2018-06-01,5,We just left....this place is off the hook....awesome food....best mussels ever....rice balls incredible...red snapper delicious.   Not to be be outdone by lasagna edges......Kat was great and the Elexlis and the welcoming staff gracious and hospital......love this joint
2018-05-24,5,The absolute BEST in Hoboken and BEYOND!!! Every aspect of this amazing restaurant/bar is innovative and unique. Utilizing a 1000 degree coal fired brick oven that was in place over 100 years in the original bakery, this team lead by award winning chef Paul Gerard, creates original dishes that wow the palette! There is so much care and creativity in this establishment. From the retro decor that whirls you into immediate sense of nostalgia of days gone by to the upbeat motivated staff, to the unique ideas for nightlife and holiday celebrations, there are just not enough adjectives to fully describe what you will experience. The scope of what is offered ranges from early morning coffee, breads, pastries, quiches and the like, to innovative lunch and dinner options. Their brunch in off the charts in every aspect. Traditional favorites amped up by the coal oven leave you wanting to come back weekly. They use all local, in season produce which allows them to create seasonal menu and specials. One of the few restaurants that have dining late into the evening and even a special after midnight menu. The ambiance is further enhanced by wonderful music selections, that still allows for conversation. The cocktails and the creativity at the bar are outstanding! Great effort and attention to detail provides perfectly mixed drinks. Cheers to the visionary, gifted and dedicated owners of this restaurant, who created such a unique space with the very best of food, drink, and desserts. How refreshing in a town of endless sport bars serving bad bar food, you get this GEM! So no need to head to JC or the village right here at 122 Willow Avenue in Hoboken dining perfection! Potential patrons who complain about wait times during peak hours, really should just head to a sports bar because clearly every exceptional restaurant worldwide Is high demand during those times and if you are that impatient you are likely clueless about a truly great dining experience anyway.
2018-05-22,1,Came here with friends last Saturday. Upon arrival the host was incredibly rude to us. He asked if e we're on the list and not having made the reservation ourselves said "I think so" his reply: "you think?" After clicking around on his iPad for a while (not even sure what he was doing a list is a list either you're on it or not) he finally finds us on "the list." Since the policy is that they will seat you within an hour of your reserved time we ordered drinks at the bar and made ourselves comfortable. Drinks were fine and bartender was fine. After over an hour my friend asked if her table would be ready soon. She was snapped at By the hostess who said she can't make people get up from her table. Finally, the hostess comes over holding garlic bread saying our table is ready. We leave our bar seats and push through the bar crowd only to find the table has been seated by the rude male host. At that point, we have no seats at the bar, no table, and no idea how long it will be until we can eat. Garlic bread disappeared as well. We made reservations at 630 and walked out of that restaurant at 8 with nothing but an over priced bar tab. Waiting and a crowded restaurant is one thing but the rudeness can not be excused. I've never felt less welcome at a restaurant for simply arriving and waiting patiently for a table.
2018-05-21,1,I have never had a worse experience in a restaurant than i did at Antique Bar & Bakery on Saturday.  We had relatives from Switzerland visiting and made 'reservations' well in advance.  Mary (hostess) called Saturday to confirm our reservations, which were at 7pm.  We arrived at 6:50 and were informed by the hostess that several 4-tops were settling up and that it shouldn't be long until we were seated.  Fast forward to 9pm and we were still unseated and still receiving the same information.  Other parties began seating themselves out of frustration.  It was chaotic, extremely overcrowded, and it was very apparent that people who knew people had priority over us.  It was a disastrous night...  we left after we were beyond fed up and extremely hungry and were luckily well-received and attended to at Del Friscos Grille.  I woke up Saturday to an email from Open Table questioning why I did not make my reservation which added to my disgust for what transpired.  I hope Antique Bar & Bakery learns to treat just us regular Hoboken people with dignity and respect...  I've never been so poorly treated by a restaurant. It was so bad that this is my first YELP review ever... It was as if nobody was in charge/in control of the situation.  Truly maddening...  definitely not the night out (Babysitter at home) we had hoped for!  The 1 star is for the bartenders who served us while we waited for nothing....
2018-05-21,2,Do not come here if you have any food allergies. The server did not know what was in the food, described things wrong when we asked questions. We had to send back one meal at brunch, when we asked for something else off menu they came back and told us the menu had changed? They did comp the meal with problems, and the other items were good but not worth the price. We saw another table have to send back their meal as well.
2018-05-20,5,We recently had a party for our daughters graduation from grad school. The food was amazing and the entire staff was accommodating and welcoming. I highly reccomend Antique Bar and Bakery!! Thanks for making a great party!!
2018-05-20,2,Food, ambiance, and music were great but they get a two star review based on their unintelligible reservation policy. They took my reservation several weeks before our dinner but, on the day of, called to confirm and mentioned they don't really take reservations and that we could still wait up to an hour. Since it was a Saturday and there was little chance of getting an alternate reservation at the last minute we went with it. They kept us waiting over two hours as they did with several other irate customers. With all the competition in the area we won't be putting up with this place again.
2018-05-19,3,This place is decent but overpriced. The cocktails were pretty weak (they tasted good but did not have enough alcohol in them to justify the price tag). My least favorite part of the meal was the bread pudding dessert. THIS IS NOT BREAD PUDDING. what you get are basically a large number of chunks of French toast. Quantity over quality. It was crap.The food was decent except for the dessert but at this price point it's not worth going back. It sucks, Hoboken has a serious lack of nicer restaurants but this one just doesn't make the cut for me.
2018-05-17,2,The food is good and so is atmosphere but it's not worth the price tag. $250 for a bottle of wine, 1 app, and 2 entrees is over the top.
2018-05-13,5,Just had brunch here with my wife, mother and grandmother. They had the best time and loved the experience. The service was amazing - everybody was so incredibly friendly and accomodating.  The bread basket and deviled eggs were standouts.  We had the best day and can't wait to return to try their sticky buns!
2018-05-13,1,Service was fine. Attentive enough. My issue was the food. Both appetizers I ordered were not flavorful or delicious. Pumpkin rice balls are odd tasting and spaghetti squash carbonara wasn't flavorful except for pieces of pancetta. The hanger steak was decent but the blackened beets again odd flavor. I wouldn't go back for the food. Poor execution of flavors. Not worth the money.
2018-05-12,4,The food was amazing. The waitress was horrible my mother did enjoy her meal and so did I. However the waitress had another waiter assist her. I wished that i had tipped him instead of her. The gentleman that help made sure we were taken care of at brunch thank you soooo much. Oh I paid for the check and the waitress did not give me my cards, so i had to travel far to retrieve my card  (smh). I will be back again I just honestly wish i knew the gentleman name.Funny story we came back to retrieve my card and mother went looking for he gentlemen , so she can give him the tip we gave a few hours ago. Lmfaooo Ya just gotta to love your parents smh.
2018-05-01,3,Pretty overpriced for what you get. They are a bit careless with cooking times so some parts of your food will be burnt while other bits are still raw, this was apparent with everyone's different meals. The service is extremely slow - waited about a half hour to even give our orders and then another half hour trying to flag down the server to get the check. It's a fun atmosphere and the flavors are good, it's just not worth the money.
2018-04-29,5,If this was my last meal, I'd be thrilled with that. Antique Bar and Bakery kills it again and again. It's everything you want in a night out and as a brunch spot. Besides the on-point staff who is friendly and happy to be there, the food is devastatingly good. Dinner on a Friday night is delicious and fun with the vintage music vibes and late nice dancers. Everything on the menu is good. I recommend trying to save room for the bread pudding, even if you hate bread pudding. It is impossible not to fall in love with it. Today we tried brunch for the first time and my husband and I came close to crying it was so good. Homemade sausage, peppers and eggs, pesto potatoes. Get me a wheelchair because I may never be able to walk again. A poor choice in attire, I wore my high waisted jeans, sadly that didn't stop me from devouring everything on my plate. The bloody Mary's are special as are their mimosas. Nothing is typical here and I like it. If you haven't tried Antique, I'm sorry be we can't be friends. It's spectacular. Run, don't walk there.
2018-04-24,1,While Antique has a cool atmosphere and decent food, we had an extremely frustrating service experience here. The food is very pricey for what it is, albeit tasty. I called to make a reservation for 6 a week in advance and had to give the host my CC info in case of last minute cancellations. No problem, I understand that with smaller restaurants. We show up for our 8PM reservation on the dot and are told that the previous party is getting ready to leave and our table should be ready within a few minutes. Again, no problem. Cut to 20 minutes later, where we're told we don't actually have a reservation, but just a "preferred spot on their guest list which doesn't guarantee you'll be seated right away". What?! Then what's the point of me making a reservation and giving you my credit card info? And why wasn't I told this on the phone when making my reservation? Or when I got an email confirming this reservation? Or when I arrived at the restaurant?Cut to another 40 minutes later and we're actually seated. So we waited 1 hour total after our "reservation" to be actually seated. The manager who we hadn't met till this point had some appetizers waiting for us when we sat down which was definitely appreciated. But I would have loved to hear from him during the hour prior when we were being listed a jumble of weird excuses from some extremely incompetent and inarticulate hostesses. The table was crammed in the back and I was constantly being hit or shoved by staff walking by. The place is extremely loud and definitely not suited for a group meal. I'm sure this would be a fun place for cocktails with friends, but I won't be returning any time soon especially for a pricey meal.
2018-04-19,5,Had a great dinner experience here on a Thursday evening. Started off with mussels appetizer and a bottle of Pinot Noir. The mussels were fresh and nicely seasoned. Served with a garlic loaf was spot on!  I had the lasagna ends and my date the lobster pasta.  Both were good.  Lobster pasta was a great entree and the lasagna ends were tasty (especially if you like cheese!).  Ended with the cannoli sundae which was the perfect ending to a nice meal.Decor is very cool and the service was very accommodating and friendly. Definitely a place to enjoy!
2018-04-18,1,Way over priced for very salty (but still decent tasting food). Went here recently on a work outing so the bill was covered, but I still have to say the price is absolutely rip-off worthy. First of all, they serve a chicken, which honestly tastes worse than a grocery store rotisserie, for $48!!! It's small and just tastes like...chicken. The only special thing is it comes with an herb sauce on the side. The appetizers are all $11. Regardless of what you get. Do NOT get the burnt Broccoli. It comes with 3 tiny heads of broccoli atop a small mound of essentially grits. The potatoes or the butternut squash are waaaay more food for the same $11. They should honestly price things differently. 3 pieces of broccoli for $11? Ripoff.Some cocktails are large, and some cocktails are about 2 sips for the $12 they cost.The beers are local "crafts" but run $9 a pint, so again, fairly pricey.The music is also obnoxiously loud. I had to shout to speak with my 2 other guests. I wasn't expecting the music to get ramped up to almost nightclub levels.The place was packed, but I won't be coming back as I feel it does not justify the prices they charge. It's just way overpriced for the portions and flavors. Everything was slightly too salty or buttery. Even a simple pasta dish will run you around $30 here.
2018-04-09,2,PROS- Cool atmosphere, very unique menu, and very well-known story throughout Hoboken.CONS- Not many vegetarian options, the cocktails are miniscule (not worth the value), and the brunch food is so fancy, that it is hard to eat.I am a vegetarian, so finding a brunch entree was very hard for me. Not as hard as finding a table. The staff was able to accommodate us real quick, which was really nice. I decided on the Antique Benedict. This is two poached eggs, baked inside a mini loaf, and comes with a very spicy sausage. I asked my waitress to nix the sausage and asked to add extra veggies instead. Perhaps some onions, peppers, mushrooms scrambled below the poached eggs/bread? Oh NO! I was greeted to a mini loaf with poached eggs, salad on the plate, salad inside the mini loaf and a side of salad! So basically  i got a full bag of salad with eggs and bread.. lol! I would return back for cocktails. The cocktails were amazing. Each one handcrafted, the only con was the size- they want you leaving more! But at $14 a pop be very careful. I would recommend ordering wine or beer here. I hope to see more vegetarian brunch options on the menu.
2018-04-06,2,What's the deal with the sticky buns?   After being featured on the Chew back a while ago I've stopped by three different times and they are no where to be found.  You would think with that type of recognition, exposure and free advertising they would increase the production to make sure they are always on hand.  On three different days of the week at three different times over three weeks I was told each time to come back later? I'm starting to think they don't really exist.  I gave them two stars because the breads and other baked goods are OK but not worth a special trip.  Three strikes and you're out, I'm going back to the French place on first!!!
2018-04-05,5,Let's just say if your looking for a restaurant with beyond amazing food, New York City vibe and a great Freeaakkiing time this is it... I came in on Friday night, the moment you walk in the bar/restaurant was PACKED! I was greeted right away by the friendliest person I've ever met (wish I remembered her name). I added my name on the guest list by a friend who recommended it prior, Had a couple drinks at the bar (Johnny Friendly my favorite) Once we were seated service and food was on point! Talk about down to earth people. Ooh and let me not forget the dancers, crazy but cool bartenders, and the scenery. Whoever decorated the place needs to be my new best friend as well as your DJ I mean I was dancing to every song very 70's disco 60's. Last but not least I was literally sitting in an open kitchen and saw my ribeye being cooked and the kitchen crew loving their job. Awesome job guys, See you soon antique. PS: Get on the guest list!!! I waited a couple of minutes but soooo worth it
2018-04-04,2,My boyfriend and I went here on a Tuesday night when the restaurant was less than half full (guests at about 5 tables). Overall it was a very disappointing experience, and the two stars are for good (NOT incredible) food. This place is pretty high on its "cool" vibe, but it's really not that cool, and that's never going to be enough to cultivate loyal customers anyway. Highlights of the evening include: 1) The service. We waited 20 minutes for 2 glasses of wine at the start of the evening. (I'll remind you the place was mostly empty.) We asked to speak to a manager and were told no one was available, but they did comp our drinks. Our waitress checked on us a bunch (again, mostly empty restaurant), but she was super aloof, and we weren't confident she knew the menu at all. 2) The hostess. We found out they didn't have gluten free bread available even though we called beforehand to confirm they did. 3) The menu. The menu is laid out like a film script ("fade in", "cut to") with hand written edits. They are trying to be clever, but let me tell you that the effect is not delight, but confusion and annoyance. I couldn't stand looking at it. Additionally, check out the attached photo. Just wondering - what exactly is gluten free and vegan? - because there's nothing in that circle. Also, which dessert would you say comes with yummy peanut butter? The menu was clearly printed with the red text a bit shifted down from where it should be, but I guess that doesn't matter at a place this cool. Also, the waitress initially handed us one outdated menu, and one up to date menu. 4) The soundtrack. At one point, I kid you not, they played Christmas music. It's April. 5) The portions and prices. We ordered a side of broccoli rabe, which came on the world's tiniest plate and cost $11. I live in New York, and I can't think of a single restaurant that would price such a small side over $9. The difference of $2 may not seem like much, but it's really an indication of how pretentious this place is. 6) Ambiance. The lighting design of this restaurant is horrible. It's too dark and too orange. 7) Food safety. I had a stomachache all night and my boyfriend had the runs this morning. You've been warned.
2018-04-03,4,My daughter loves this place, she lives a block away and we were finally able to go together for dinner.  We ordered and shared a bunch of dishes, there were five of us.  The best were the garlic oil shrimp, half chicken, boar ragu and the cookies dessert was to die for!  The lamb dish and beef cheek was just okay.  Its a busy and pretty loud place but nice atmosphere.  If you want to be in the middle of everything, request to sit by the open kitchen.
2018-04-02,3,Came here for Easter brunch. Menu was different, more limited with unique dishes.  Not being much of a breakfast food person, I went with a pasta. I asked the waitress what her favorite was, working in hospitality I know employees usually know best. She gave me two choices, one of which I had previously and didn't enjoy so I picked the second, the lobster pasta which was priced as Market Price. With the other items in this section of the menu ranging from $20-24, I thought perhaps it would've been $30, maybe a little higher. Well definitely got sticker shock when the check came and MP was $52. Granted, I should've asked, however with a price like that it should be on the menu. Don't think the dish was worth $52, I would've expected leftovers of some sort to get a second meal out of it, and the portion wasn't THAT big. No desire to return.
2018-04-01,5,Love this place. The food is really good and ambience great. It is as good for a friends happy hour as for a first date. Strongly recommend the hanger steak. Bear in mind that their reservations are exactly what they say: a kind of waiting list for that hour. They mention something about that at their website and it is actually like that. It is almost as if they put you in a waiting list without you having to be there, when you arrive you got the first table available ahead of the walk ins (not sure if it is exactly this way but seems like). On top of that, they have two tables that shouldn't exist, so let them know ahead of time that you don't want to seat there. One is right in front of the restroom, which I question if it is even a proper sanitary space to eat. the second one is right in front of the brick oven and the shelves where they store their plates and bring the dirty dishes from everybody else tables. You will toast and be afraid that any of the serves will through you something as an accident. I had a very expensive coat with me and was freaking out the whole night.
2018-03-27,5,Come here for dinner, lunch (only on Fridays), HH whatever, you won't be disappointed!!!The food is authentic, and whoever manages the restaurant knows how things are done in ITALY!!!  The food is so amazing and service is great.  We've never had a bad drink or meal here.  During their Friday lunch, they have a wonderful spread of grilled veggies and etc for you to eat and the waitstaff brings you food as you eat.
2018-03-23,5,About a week ago, a group of my work colleges and I really enjoyed our time here. The atmosphere is tough to compare to other locations in the area, only because after a half hour here you'll forget you were ever in Hoboken. You will get a classy, fun New York City experience without ever having to leave Hudson County.
2018-03-16,1,Reservations mean nothing. The bar gets way too crowded during the wait time. Wish I could comment on the food but we didn't even get that far.FYI-A high top directly in front of the bathroom and to the left of the server station is not, under any circumstances, a proper place to put a table. The fact that this establishment thinks it's an acceptable table location speaks volumes as to how little they care about their customer's experience.Also, wine should be served in a wine glass not a old-fashioned glass. If you're going to give the illusion that your bartenders know what they're doing, at least equip them with the knowledge to decipher what drinks go in what glass.I had super high hopes for this place but ultimately there's no way I'm paying NYC prices for a NJ experience.
2018-03-16,3,Ate here for the first time while traveling on business. It was OK, not bad but certainly not great. The pros are unique menu items, funky decor, solid wait staff. The cons are extremely tight seating with barely enough room between tables to squeeze by, menu items that are vague in their descriptions. I ordered Lasagna Edges, which I assumed would be something resembling lasagna. Not even close, it was Mac & cheese that used lasagna noodles as the pasta. No red sauce, extremely rich cheese sauce, very disappointing when my stomach was looking forward to a tomatoe based dish. I would not dine here again for dinner.
2018-03-10,2,I'm going to tell you the truth and exactly what I thought about this place. The only reason I gave two stars is because I like the vibe. Otherwise its a horrible place with astronomical prices. I went with six people and we pretty much ordered everything on the menu. Including all entree's,appetizers, and drinks. Yes our bill was around $1,000 but who cares.. you only live once and let me tell you we didn't like anything and sent back 50% of the food because it was either to salty, over cooked, under cooked , or had no taste. I mean am i right when you pay $48 for a whole chicken, you want that chicken to be amazing you want it to melt in your mouth or be cooked to perfection but instead you get shoe leather that tastes like a block of salt. Or if you get $120 steak that steak needs to be top notch steak house quality and not some fatty piece of meat from shoprite fried up in a frying pan,   i thought that was a joke. The beef cheeks are just meatballs. The $16 salad is just arugula sprinkled with the saltiest parmesan cheese known to man. They charge $6 per piece of bread. The mussels are NOT Fresh. And he lasagna is all cheese and sauce. I cant believe this place has such crazy hype. Is hoboken so desperate for a good eatery that this is what they settled for? Its a joke. An over priced sad joke.  Come here if you want to waste $150 per person for dinner and drinks. Just take an uber into tribeca and eat somewhere amazing for that kind of money. We are talking Avra madison, milos, peter lugger, nobu money here.
2018-03-08,5,If I could give Antique Bar and Bakery a 10 out of 5 stars, I would. Went there with a few of my girlfriends twice now. The first time we went, we and had coffee and some pastries and chatted for a while. The decor and vibe of AB&B is very cool and welcoming, almost as if you are in a Hollywood movie. The second time we went, we sat at the bar and was served by the very nice JD. We ended up ordering the pumpkin rice balls, the spaghetti carbonara, and the parsnip dip with garlic bread. All three were incredible and we couldn't resist getting another order of the rice balls... Seriously, get them. This place is truly a hidden gem in Hoboken, and I would recommend it to anyone!!
2018-03-03,2,I wish I could say I loved this place because I really really wanted to. The vibe is cool, the food smelled delicious and the music was great. However - the service is abysmal. I made a reservation at 745 and did not get seated until 850. We got seated at a tiny table on top of another couple. They kept trying to get their uneven table fixed so it didn't rock off the ledge of the area and no one could help so they left too. We sat for 20 mins, no servers came by and we decided to give up. I went to the bar to pay our tab and it took over 15 mins to get anyone to close us out. So if you don't mind being ignored, rude hosts and no consideration for your time - this is a great Saturday night spot for you.
2018-03-01,1,Beware!! The octopus "appetizer" is OUTRAGEOUS in price.  Tastes ok but for triple the price of everything on the menu is out of control. Not even at the best restaurants in the city have I paid this much for an entree. Unreal!
2018-03-01,5,The perfect place and atmosphere!  Good food, fun crowd and great staff!  The vibe is something I would need to travel into the city for but no more!
2018-02-24,1,If I could give them a negative star I would..everything from start to finish at this place was deceitful and shady..I made my " reservation" over a month ago for 8:30pm..on the day of my reservation at 1pm I was called and told that technically my "reservation" wasn't a reservation and that it was actually a wait list and that it was first come first serve and they would seat us when they could..oh also they said that a new policy was that on Friday and Saturday nights for parties of 6 or more there was a $100 pp minimum spending fee.:the day of my reservation after I made it over a month ago! I asked to speak with the manager and said this was completely unacceptable that I was being informed of this now..the manager (a female) agreed and said we wouldn't be held to this..so we decided to get there by 8pm due to this apparent "waitlist, not a reservation" policy bc we actually wanted to make sure that we got seated by 8:30..we got there by 7:55, gave our name and waited..our 8:30 "reservation " came and went.. every few minutes we were being told oh our table is almost ready..an hour later our table still wasn't ready..the male "possible manager" bought us a round of drinks but was nasty, rude and pretentious and acted like he was doing us a favor by giving us the drinks after the awful communication issues..apparently several people after us were also under the impression that they had a reservation but they were then told it would be 1-1,5 hour wait, they were furious and completely confused..some people left..finally they were seated and did bring us complimentary apps.. food was ok, nothing so great that would make me want to go back..however, I also brought a cake for my friends bday..I asked when I made the reservation if this was ok or if there was a cake cutting fee..I was told this was fine and no..so they cute the cake, we get the bill and we see a $60 admin fee on our billl..we asked what this was for and they said it was $10 pp for the cake cutting fee! That was more than the cake cost..again they said it was on their website, which it's not..I said to the waitress we were never informed of this, that this was crazy and we would not be paying this..we were once again confronted by the rudest male manager(wish I knew his name) saying that I could not tt his staff that way and that was not acceptable..I was floored..I'm being disrespectful to your staff bc I'm asking why I had a $60 admin fee, why I was told I had a reservation when I didn't, etc..I was told to please leave and not come back again! I was horrified and disgusted with this mans behavior and if he's not an owners the owners should know what an inhospitable man they have as running the place..it was a joke and everything was shady and deceitful from start to finish..I will never ever be eating here again and I wouldn't recommend it ever to anyone else..they are rude, classless, liars and millenials who have no idea how to run a restaurant and should be ashamed of themselves..customer service is probably the worst I have ever had in my life..I will be contacting so many entities to let them know how horrified my friends and I were..you should be ashamed of yourselves antique bakery..just ashamed..
2018-02-19,5,I have been here several times and every time it has been an outstanding meal.    The spaghetti squash carbonara is amazing.   And their coal oven cooked steaks are better than just about any other steak you can get in.  Perfectly seasoned.  T
2018-02-18,3,Unfortunately, our meal didn't live up to the hype. Pasta was 1-2 minutes shy of being al dente and everything was way over salted. The cocktails were good and the bread was amazing. Service was ok but we felt rushed even though we were only there for an hour. Not planning to go back again, especially considering how over priced the meal was.
2018-02-14,5,One of the best restaurants in Hoboken. Drinks are excellent. Bread pudding is to die for. Must try the sausage bread. Most everything on the menu is excellent although I'm actually not a big fan of most of their pasta options (although their Mac is delicious). Ambience is very nice...do plan for a crowded place and lots of noise. Did I mention the bread pudding?
2018-02-12,5,One of the best meals that I've ever had in Hoboken / JC, if not one of the best meals that I've ever had. Antique is a 100 year old bakery that recently turned into an ultra swanky bar and restaurant. This restaurant is so in-demand that they don't even take reservations. Instead, you have to put yourself on the waitlist which basically means that you have an hour time slot and will probably end up waiting for a full hour - especially if you are in over a weekend. But, because you can post up at the bar and enjoy a cocktail the hour wait is not so bad.Everything on the menu sounds amazing and we had a tough time figuring out what to order. I really wanted to try the stuffed bread (after all, this is a famous bakery) but because it's filling our waiter advised us not to try it during our first visit. Instead, we started out with pumpkin arancini and fresh mozzarella which was on special.  Both very cheesy dishes, so looking back we maybe should have switched one up. But both so incredible that I'm happy we didn't. The arancini is literally served over cheese fondue, stuffed with cheese and has a generous sprinkling of fresh parm on top. Cheese here, there and everywhere is something I support fully. The rice balls were hot and gooey on the inside and crispy on the outside. The portion came with four large rice balls. The mozz was served like a fondue, basically just a hot dish of gooey cheese with tomatoes, and served with crusty bread for dipping.For mains we shared the hanger steak and boar ragu pasta. The steak is perfectly charred on the outside, rare on the inside and topped with cherry peppers for some extra flavor. You can also choose a dipping sauce -- the bordelaise was incredible. Oh, and the steak is served with a whole clove of roasted garlic. I wish the pasta dish had more pasta to go along with all of the meat, but it was still incredible. Soft and pillowy fresh made pasta topped with a hearty boar ragu. And of course - more cheese! The fresh ricotta on top really made the dish. I'm glad we didn't order a side because we literally did not have any room. Although I do wish we saved room for their dessert which I hear is incredible.Antique Bakery brings it. My fiance and I were in absolute awe and are still thinking about this meal a few days later. Next time I'll be back to try the stuffed bread and dessert. Hopefully that next time is very soon.
2018-02-11,5,This place is amazing!  Great vibe/ambiance and killer food.  I'll start off by saying my husband said it was the BEST MEAL OF HIS LIFE!  For me...best steak of my life.My husband and I went here for a date night and were blown away.App: melted fresh mutz with balsamic and roasted plums.  SO GOOD!  It was some of the best mutz I've had in Hoboken (which is saying a lot).Entree: Ribeye for 2 - it was like steak butter.  It melted in your mouth and was so flavorful.  The char from the 100 yr old coal oven they cook it in gives it a nice flavor.Side: Charred broccoli and semolina - good but given all of the other food, wasn't needed.Dessert: Chocolate cake - OMG, it's like I died and went to chocolate heaven.  Don't skip the dessert, this place started out as a bakery after all!!The only "negative" is it can get pricey...although we did order the most expensive thing on the menu.  The Ribeye is $115 (but so worth it).  The sides were $14 each and tiny.  Also we asked for extra toast with our mutz and were charged $3.  Howeever, none of this would deter me from going again.  We will definitely be back!Oh...and suggestion for the chef.  Creme brulee would be AMAZING in that coal oven!
2018-02-09,5,Antique Bar and Bakery is a real gem in Hoboken. It has more of a West Village feel rather than the typical Hoboken establishment. The food is absolutely delicious. The chef has really taken the time to marry the perfect ingredients to create the most amazing flavor. The house made mozzarella is unbelievable, as are the chicken and steak entrees. For desert the decadent cookie is to die for and the macaron shake is also a real treat.I have been here many times and I have seen chef Paul Gerard every time I have been there. He is very involved in the kitchen and very friendly to the patrons. Rocco is also there often and stops to talk to the tables.I would recommend sitting in the back room where you can watch the kitchen prepare the meals, it's a very entertaining show!
2018-02-08,1,believe it or not, i'm not a connoisseur of quality, but i have some standards. this place has so much potential but misses the mark entirely due to awful customer service. i can get hammered and eat dominos at home so sue me for wanting to have a good time when i hit the town. so what if i don't like devoting a single minute of my precious life to being treated like the trash person i am? considering how many awesome places there are in hoboken to hang, i would suggest going elsewhere to spend your hard earned dinero.
2018-02-03,4,A higher end bar and restaurant in Hoboken. My friends and I have come by here twice after our now somewhat frequent visits to nearby Tony Boloney's. Service here has always been really friendly and the bartenders, if you choose to sit by the bar, seem to always be willing to help you find a drink that would best fit your taste preferences. Their cocktails are also really well made: I had one of their Hey Hendry cocktails and also one of their Lost Time cocktails. I liked the latter better than the former, though both drinks were quite good. The place can get super crowded, but I would still recommend you come by for a well-crafted drink if you happen to be in the area.
2018-02-02,5,Basically amazing. One of the best dining experiences that I've had in a long time. Fantastic and attentive front of house and a talented group of cooks in the back. This place serves the kind of food that folks in the restaurant industry like to eat and drink after work. They serve a really fantastic mix of rustic Euro-centric peasant food with incredible finesse. Yet the spot is laid back and fun.  At any given time a server or cook could be grooving to the music.  There was admittedly a very long wait for a dining room table even at 9PM. We waited for 45 minutes and didn't care as we were able to pass the time with some really tasty cocktails up front. The food that we had was basically excellent. No one in the back was trying to "updo" the peasant food.  We had the boar ragu, hot shrimp, arancini, garlic bread and arugula salad. Everything was spot on. The stars that this spot has are all well deserved.
2018-01-21,3,Over-rated. If there was half ratings my real rating would be 2.5 stars but due to ambiance and atmosphere I will give them the extra half point. We started with drinks at the bar which were fantastic. When we finally sat down and ordered the same thing (cucumber martinis) the drinks came back 4/10. The first was 9/10. Inconsistent. Considering it's been a Bakery in town for almost a century, the bread was par level at best and nothing special about it. We got the dirty garlic bread which was meh...soggy and saturated in butter. We also got the shrimp appetizer priced at 3 shrimp for 20 something dollars or 6 for 36 dollars. We were two people and I asked the waitress how big the shrimp were. She replicated the size which was much smaller than what came out. I ordered 6 shrimp because I thought they'd be small, they ended up being much larger then she explained.  Although she under promised and over delivered on size of the shrimp 3 would have been plenty for 2 people due to the size and the fact that we had garlic bread. The shrimp were served head on and should have been cooked more for the top quarter of the shrimp connected to the shell. It was also loaded a Calabrian chilies which gave it a nice touch. Points off for service technicality. We then ordered the 2lb bone in rib eye for $110. This was served at the perfect temperature but DEFINITELY not worth $110. I don't know who these people are charging $18 for a martini, $36 for shrimp, and $110 for a bone in ribeye which was subpar. If the prices were reduced by 20-25% there would be a different rating. They redeem themselves only by their desserts which are a must try. My girlfriend on the other hand, claims she wouldn't eat there again even if the food was free...
2018-01-21,4,Super fun Sunday brunch. Arrived a little early and were invited to hang at the bar. Mike was our entertainer-extraordinaire. We had a great time - pastries, apps and mains. And of course, lots of booze. Really enjoyed the charcoal lemonade and rose-b wine. Hot oil shrimp were served whole - googly eyes and all. What a great 2 hours of my life.  And the playlist was old school 1970s - amazing!
2018-01-13,1,Food was excellent!  Servers were good.   Girl who took our order was terrible.  Told us we had to make our table available by 8pm. Rushed our party.  Treated us like second class citizens and then another hostess confronted  us about the tip we left.  Tip was slightly below 20%, but her approach was very distasteful.  A LOCAL group of friends gets together for a nice dinner and are portrayed as second class citizens when leaving.  Your staff definitely ensured that your establishment will no longer be graced with our presence.  People say Hoboken has changed.  I always dismissed the people who spoke ill of Hoboken, but the only change necessary in Hoboken is certain people in your staff.  Again I commend your kitchen staff and wait staff, but do yourself a favor and get rid of your terrible demeaning hostesses. Hope you can make the necessary adjustments.
2018-01-12,5,My wife and I just had dinner here and were more then  satisfied with the food and service. Great ambience and attention to detail....we sat right next to the action and being from that environment I especially enjoyed it...great job guys ....going back tomorrow
2018-01-12,5,Quite possibly the best restaurant in Hoboken. Rotating menu of appetizers and drinks. Sat in the back of the restaurant and it is apparent that the people who work here love their jobs. Paul the chef, surprised us with a few appetizers on the house. Hanger steak and squash carbonara are some of the best I've ever had, plus the mozzarella special. Great restaurant in a neighborhood that needs more restaurants like this.
2018-01-09,4,I want to start this review by saying that the food was really excellent. Like...really really remarkably good. Creative, well made, tasty AF. Unfortunately the actual experience of dining here was pretty unpleasant and as good as the food was...I'll make sure to never arrive at a peak time if I return.1. We had a 1 pm reservation for 4. We were told to wait and given no information about what was going on. I finally asked (at 1:30) and was told that they "don't take typical reservations." I have no clue what that means, but..."your reservation is meaningless" is how we experienced it. We sat at 1:40.2. I got an appetizer as my meal. This was discussed with the server, but the food came out as an appetizer. So my friends watched while I ate. Then I watched them eat. Boo.3. Server completely forgot to place our drink order, bar tab (and credit card) was not transferred to our table as discussed. Everything was just generally in disarray. I hate to leave a negative post, but I really feel like this place would be great if they got their act together. The food was truly phenomenal, so if you can go at an off peak time...do that! They just can't handle the brunch rush.
2018-01-03,4,What a neat concept for a restaurant! I loved the history of Antique - half of the property was a bakery for a hundred years, hence the brick fire oven in the back. The entire restaurant had an eclectic mix of decor and a homey feel, although space is tight and tables are packed close together. The food was outstanding and had so many unique ingredients and flavors; definitely not food you can get anywhere else. Our group of four split the mussels, hot oil shrimp, and beef cheek parm before ordering our respective entrees. My dining mates had steak and the Roaming Razorback Boar Ragu, which they enjoyed thoroughly. I had the Lasagna Edges which were great as well. Finally, we split the Antique Bread Pudding which was phenomenal - super hot and fluffy, almost resembling monkey bread or cinnamon rolls rather than traditional NOLA style bread pudding. The service, while very polite and well-knowledgeable, was pretty slow - there was a large gap between the time we received our appetizers and when our entrees finally came. In fact, our dinner took around 2.5 hours total from the time we sat down until the time we paid the check and left. Despite this, I would absolutely come back here and look forward to doing so!
2017-12-31,3,Honestly this was subpar at best. We went there for New Year's Eve, expecting an expensive dinner, but willing to splurge for the holiday. Well it was a huge disappointment. The mussel appetizer was the best thing about the whole dinner. The rice balls were just okay. I had lobster pasta that I actually asked the waiter if the noodles were supposed to be so hard because they were thicker noodles and he replied they were al dente so I ate a couple chunks of lobster and paid $52 for it. My boyfriend had hanger steak with no side, it is was good. Our bill was $270. We are absolutely willing to pay if the meal is good, but this absolutely did not meet the price tag.
2017-12-31,3,This place is great - definitely a unique spot in Hoboken.  The ambiance is cool, sometimes an old moving playing, sometimes live music. The food is good, always changing but a little pricey. It gets pretty busy and it's hard to really move at all of you have to wait for your reservation at the bar.I went here on a date the other night and after we paid, the hostess asked us if the service was ok because the tip didn't reflect good service....mind you, my date paid and this was extremely mortifying (also should note this was over a $200 bill for 2 people). He explained he gave more than 20% and wasn't sure what the issue was. Turns out it wasn't legible and he spoke with the waitress to clarify before we left, but I didn't think that was appropriate. How embarrassing?
2017-12-28,5,I tell you hwat. You throw some beef cheek parm on some garlic bread you got yourself a scrundiddlyumptious bite to eat right there, yes sir.
2017-12-27,3,Dinner is pretty good and great atmosphere but I also stop in on my way work in the morning for coffee and sometimes breakfast today. Most of the time it is fine but there are some mornings that the open sign is on but when you get inside there is no one at he register yet and one of the girls from the back comes up to tell you "not open yet" because the register person is not in yet.
2017-12-24,5,This place was absolutely phenomenal. The aesthetics alone are enough to reel me in and keep me there all night. Such a rich history to accompany the welcoming atmosphere. Although it is a smaller space, they don't lack for quality by any means. A group of my girlfriends and I met up for dinner and we decided to wait at the bar and share some drinks while we awaited our table. Hands down the best craft cocktails I've ever had - the Johnny Walker, although my friend raved about the My Fate! Time honesty flew by until our table was ready and I can say I didn't mind the wait one bit at the bar and it only got better. We ordered a few appetizers to start - the fresh muzz and plantain special which our divine waiter, Jonathan, helped us with. Then I order the gnocchi Lamb Ragu while my friends decided on the whole fish and burnt edges Lasagna with a side of Greek fries. I can say, as we all shared, I cannot decide which dish was best. All tied for 10/10. The fish melted in your mouth. The lasagna was perfectly cheesy. The gnocchi was clearly fresh and the lamb was so succulent and tender - I wish I had more as I write this. Such a wonderful experience and will DEFINITELY be back (with friends) to try other (and *maybe* a few of the same) items on the menu!Oh and just a fun fact: the check was delivered in a paperback novel! Just another unique characteristic of this coal-fire oven legend of a place.
2017-12-24,3,I really liked the interior of this place. It was quaint and historic. They had great music playing. However the drink options were slim. They didn't carry certain vodkas and other drinks were very overpriced for some reason. They did an up charge on a drink. The kitchen smelled great. Maybe I'll come back and try some food one day.
2017-12-24,5,Amazing place! It's a bakery during the day and then it turns into an amazing restaurant in the evening. We went around Christmas and the place was decorated like I've never seen in Hoboken... and they had Christmas music playing! It was so wonderful i didn't want to leave. The drinks were amazing and the staff was so incredibly nice. We will definitely be back!
2017-12-22,2,Atmosphere is cool and drinks are good. I was really looking forward to trying the food here...too bad that will never happen because the hostesses can't seem to keep names on a list and they don't take reservations. We came in on a Friday after work....630'ish. We checked in with the hostess for a table for two. We were told there was a wait....no biggie it's a Friday night, I totally expected that. The bar was packed but we got drinks and hung out. After an hour we checked to see where we were on the list. Hostess says, "when people get up we'll clear tables and seat who is next"....(um yea, I get how that works, I was asking for where my name is...). After another half hour, we checked again, and the hostess said our name isn't on the list.  ...good bye, see ya never! If a restaurant chooses not to take reservations then they need to have the hostess station able to handle the job.
2017-12-21,1,Once again 2nd trip to Antique Bakery and service was an issue. We were asked to get here at 6:30, we did and got here even an Hour prior, and they have not seated us yet!!! So annoyed! I wish I could tell you about the food!
2017-12-20,1,Haven't even been yet this rating is for their awful customer service. Whoever answered the phone hung up on me  as soon as I said I wanted to reserve a table for tomorrow then rejected my call several times before placing me "on hold" for 20 minutes. 12/20/17 8:30pm. Haven't even stepped a foot inside and already disappointed. Smh and I was actually looking forward to going here. NEVER MIND !
2017-12-19,5,For the amount of years I've lived in Hoboken, I had no idea this was a restaurant.My boyfriend, now fiancé, made a dinner reservation here for after his proposal.  The moment we walked into the restaurant, we were inundated with warm and fuzzy congratulations by all staff.  Everyone treated us with utmost care - they had reserved the best spot for us to celebrate our night.Our waitress gave us champagne to toast to and the chef gave us many on-the-house items to try.  I was not only utterly surprised that I had missed this restaurant around the block for so long, but was amazed by the food and service.  They truly knocked it out of the park!+ Bread & Mozz (on-the-house), was absolutely delicious - it was super cheesy and the bread was deeply marinated well+ Bone Marrow - my first time trying this delicacy and it did not disappoint+ Stuffed pepperoni bread - super STUFFED and cheesy; it was just as good when we warmed it up the next day, too+ Lobster Tail pasta - literally CHUNKS of lobster meat+ Lasagna - not your typical red sauce lasagna; I don't even know for sure what was in it.  I can only tell you that this entree is a MUST ORDER+ Beets (on-the-house) - this one was a little too spicy for me+ Bread Pudding - oh. my. goodness. The portion of this dessert is huge and also good warmed up the next dayCollectively, everyone helped build us a night to remember forever.  We cannot wait to go back again and might have to form a traditional and celebrate here every year now :).Side note: if you really wanted to know why there's a sparkly panda in every photo I've posted here, it's my ring box, haha!
2017-12-17,2,I have been going to Antique Bakery since the week they opened and at least once a month. It was hands down my favorite place in Hoboken. Unfortunately things are taking a turn for the worse in pricing and portions. My partner and I went this past week for a drink and dinner and we couldn't believe that the same drink (Gimlet) that we have been ordering for a year now is currently served in a glass that looks more like a shot glass with a stem. Price? $12+tip+tax. Outrageous. A) because that is not a gimlet glass and b) because is half the size it used to be. We then ordered the mussels which were good and for being a starter size the amount was just right but we followed it with the lamb gnocchi at $26+tip+tax. There were LITERALLY only 3 gnocchi. I got 2, my partner got 1. That's not only outrageous is borderline scam. What was the worse part? When they brought our food, mind you the place is pitch dark, what seemed to be the gnocchi (served in same type of plate under a lot of sauce) turned out to be 2 meatballs. We informed our waitress that we had not ordered it but we had regrettedly touched it already. She was angry, took it, said is ok, and it was served to someone else. Ewwwwwwwwww. I am not surprised they are having issues money wise which might have prompted the reduced portions of food and drinks considering that in the lil over an hour we were there we were serviced by 8 people btw water boys, waitresses and people checking with us and cleaning the table. So unnecessary. They seem to always be trying to justify being there. We used to order 3 drinks each and we cut it at one this time. You know when you are being taken advantage of. Unfortunately it was a major let down for us and I seriously doubt we will be heading back any time soon.
2017-12-11,3,My friends and I came here for my birthday on Thursday night and it was quite busy.  I got there early and had a drink at the bar.  They had a really cool drink menu offering various cocktails and a great wine list.  My friend made a reservation on open table but when we checked in they said they don't take reservations and that was for a wait list despite open table confirming our reservation.  Thankfully they were able to seat us but if they weren't this review might have turned out quite different.Our service was great and waitress knew every aspect of the menu.  I actually found it impressive and a bit comical at how she described each dish but totally appreciated that she was a foodie.  We ordered a bunch of dishes to split and I thought the food was really good but expected a little better considering the cocktails were amazing.  To start we got the burrata which was warm and slightly melted which was delicious.  We also ordered a half order of shrimp that was similar to scampi but not as buttery and garlicky.  For dinner we split the burnt broccoli and polenta which is a must get.  We also ordered the steak which was good but not great.  The portion was small and we only had one piece of meat each (3 of us).  The pappardelle ragu was split amongst the 3 of us and the pasta was really good but again not the best I had.  The pasta dish came with a generous portion of meat but the chunks of meat were a bit big and could have been shredded better so each bite was more balanced.For dessert, the waitress brought out a chocolate cake with chocolate icing which was very tasty.  It was served in a cast iron pan which was a great presentation and large enough for the 3 of us split.For a busy Thursday night we were not rushed out and the staff let us enjoy our meal and drinks.  I would def come back but would be more interested in ordering drinks and apps vs dinner.
2017-12-10,4,Really great food in a super quaint & warm atmosphere. We had early brunch reservation and we were seated immediately. Our only complaint was that they asked us to leave within literally 3 mins of paying our check... While they did it somewhat politely, it left a sour note on an otherwise nice meal.
2017-12-06,4,If you're looking for a change from the standard bars and Italian kitchens of hoboken definitely come check out Antique. This spot feels like it belongs in BK! I've been here twice now. The food and cocktails are always on point. Priced at a premium, but delicious. Hangar steak is a must, along with any of the appetizers. "My fate" is my my fave cocktail, if you enjoy tequila, get it! Service has been a mixed bag. I learned on my second time visiting here that I believe it's Thursday- Saturday night that the reso you think you're making on open table isn't actually real. It's actually just getting you a spot on the waitlist.. so some room for improvement on wait management. The space is small and it gets packed!! Servers have always been super knowledgeable about the menu and provide helpful recos.
2017-12-03,5,By far one of the best dining experiences that I have had in the Hoboken/Jersey City area in a LONG time!  I had been stalking this place for a while on Instagram before actually making a reservation. A friend and I decided to take a 6pm Saturday reservation to beat the primetime dinner rush, which was a good idea because the restaurant got packed quickly!  My advice if you are considering this restaurant -- do it!! And also order as much as you can, we were blown away.  We had the mussels and bone marrow appetizers. Both were huge portions and were almost too much for 2 girls to eat, but we did it!  The mussels were in a delicious green garlic sauce that was flavorful but not too overpowering and the bone marrow with garlic bread and balsamic onions was honestly too delicious to put into words. For entree we split the octopus special and the lasagna ends. The pasta was phenomenal, simple yet well done and I would definitely order again.  The octopus dish (which was big enough to feed 4 people easily) was probably the best octopus I've had in the US. Cocktails were standard, creative and tasty. I can't wait to go back and try the bread pudding dessert (another huge portion that we couldn't handle after clearing our plates from the first 2 courses). I also give an A+ for service, as the waitress that we had was phenomenal. I can't say enough good things!
2017-12-02,5,This is my new favorite spot in Hoboken and will be in my A+ rotation alongside La Isla downtown, The Cuban, and Augustino's.Took my boyfriend on a date on a whim last night - we were greeted with very enthusiastic welcomes by front-of-house staff and ushered to the bar to enjoy a cocktail while we wait for a table to be available. We both had the "All The Way" - vodka, burned cranberry, citrus, prosecco. It was a bit tart, a bit sweet, a little strong, and came in beautiful, heavy glassware. Within 5 minutes we were seated.Our waiter, Johnathan, was very hospitable and explained the history of Antique Bakery and provided some insight into the menu. For appetizers we went with the Bone Marrow (with hot onions and sweet thyme wine) and the Spaghetti Squash Carbonara (with a fried poached egg on top). They were both absolutely delicious but the bone marrow is something special and came with the most delicious bread I've ever eaten.For our main, we shared the Roaming Razorback Boar Ragu, Pasta Rags & Ricotta. After enjoying appetizers that were on the larger side, this portion was just right for us - however, if we didn't have the apps, this dish would have been too small for us to share.Then the real breakout of the evening for me was dessert - we had a glass of red wine and the Antique Bread Pudding topped with caramel sauce. TO. DIE. FOR. The dessert was the largest dish of the night. The pieces of bread were charred on outer rim in the most deliciously caramelized way and I'm salivating writing this. If nothing else, go for a coffee and this dessert.Great food, wonderful atmosphere. I've heard complaints about noise from friends who have dined here, but I think the crowd is a testament to the warmth and great time you'll have at Antique. We will certainly be back!
2017-11-27,3,This was a tough one- I have to be honest it pains me to hit em' with the 3 star review.  Let me lay it down for you... Service was decent (a balance between great/friendly but slow which doesn't bother me really), the space is an absolute crowd pleaser of an enviornment, and the food was well above average (and I mean that as a compliment).  The tipping point you ask?  I just can't say the prices (portions considered) warrant a 4-5 star rating.  It is just not fully justified- I'm not sure if it was a combination of the final expense and portions combined with the high top table we sat at that hardly seemed like it should have existed...I mean we had a $500 meal with 4 people squished next to the bathroom and we shared 1 entree with a couple of apps and sides... yikes!  It may have also been $15+ thimble sized dirty martini (although delicious and I loved the glassware!).  Here is the thing, if you're not paying- go.  A wonderful date-night or celebration location.  Otherwise, it's a once-in-a-while 'hosting some new comers to Hoboken' type place.    Don't go hungry and you'll be very happy!  I hope they do well and I think they will- there is nothing like it in town and it brings a little NYC to the dirty JerZ side of the Hudson.  We will be back but we likely won't come for more than a drink and a few bites.
2017-11-25,3,First off, we were seated at the high top by the bathroom which has to be the worst table in the place. If you are seated on the side of the bathroom everyone bumps into you including the servers. Not a good location for a table.That being said it is a cool place and unique for Hoboken. I love the open kitchen concept. The drinks take a little while to get to the table. The old fashioned was pretty good once it did arrive. Not sure why didnt send bread to the table before the meal got started. I assumed they would since it is a bakery. We started with the shrimp appetizer, a pasta dish, and the beef cheek with cheese. Everything was very salty. The beef cheek was the best thing. The shrimp was overcooked but I did like the flavorful sauce. The pasta also coulda been a little more al dente.For entrees we ordered the steak. It looks good but it was tough and fatty. $125?! That is insane considering the size. Wayyy overpriced.I do recommend the beet side dish. Very good. I do not recommend the charred broccoli... it had a burnt taste and a lot of bitterness. The peanut butter dessert was a little runny but had good flavor. Overall, this place did not live up to expectations. It was insanely overpriced. $500 for 4 people and we all shared an entree! We each had 2 slices of steak. I will try again but damnn this missed the mark. The reason I gave 3 stars because I see they are trying and so I admire any business really going for it. They just need to sort some things out.
2017-11-25,1,This place was recommended for it's monstrous ribeye for two,  instead we were fooled by only four slices of steak and a side of bone. I was completely shocked they would charge $115 and serve us so little of this over-seasoned meat, we walked out of there feeling ripped off and still hungry. Along with the steak, we ordered two sides: burnt broccoli and broccoli rabe. Both sides were served on tiny plates; one with only about three small broccoli florets and the other with about 1/2 cup of broccoli rabe that tasted like over cooked spinach. It didn't help that  bartender was absolutely clueless, answering our questions by pointing at the menu or trying to hunt down someone else. What a disappointment! I never write on Yelp but I felt that nobody should go through this experience of being ripped off and hungry.
2017-11-19,5,Really chill place! Food and drinks are great and it feels very "Mad Men-esque". The rice balls and lasagna are my favorite! The first time I came here was on a Friday and my friend commented on how rude the hostess was to her when asking for a table. I came back a few days later and there was a different hostess who was sweet as pie! Definitely make a reservation because it is always packed.
2017-11-16,5,Coolest place in hoboken . If you're steve Urkle you walk out of this place lookin like Jimi Hendrix . Dope food , good vibes and stellar service . Big antique fan . Big fan . Stop wasting your time with these other joker spots . Antique has got my vote even if you're trekking in from manhattan , bk, burbs, etc. well worth the wait/commute .
2017-11-14,4,Came here for brunch - Unique atmosphere- highly recommend the sticky buns.Dishes are definitely good but not everyone is amazing. I had the dirty burger which was amazing but the sausage peppers and potatoes was about average.I still would recommend coming here!
2017-11-13,1,My husband and I ate here on Saturday and had the worst dinner experience that I can seriously remember having in a long time. Which is unfortunate because we were here about a month ago and had a really great night. Not sure which night was a fluke, but will not be returning. First of all, their "reservations" system is a joke. If you make a reservation, it comes with the caveat that they "will try to seat you within 45 minutes". How does this equate to a reservation? Why not just keep a first come first served list and not take reservations if this is how you want to operate? We went here on Saturday night with an 8:30 reservation and sat down at 9:20. The place was a mob scene and I knew we were going to be waiting a while the second we walked in. Even with our "reservation". What's funny is that we saw people come in after us be seated before us. And, we waited at the bar next to two girls who were there before us, and got seated after us. It seems like they forget about you. So, instead of drinking at the bar like they suggest, I suggest hovering over them at the front until they seat you so you aren't forgotten about. After we sat, things were fine for a while. The food here really is good. So... they have this decadent cookie for dessert. It's amazing - less like a cookie, more like a cookie pie, seriously yummy. The menu advises that it takes 20 minutes to prepare and to order ahead of time. We forgot to order it with our entrees. So we asked the hostess, who just happened to come around and ask how things were, if we should order it. She said yes and that she'd tell our waitress. This was BEFORE our entrees came. After we finished our entrees, our waitress asked if we wanted anything else and we told her we ordered the cookie (about 20 minutes ago at this point). About 15 minutes later, she comes back to say that there was a delay with the cookie because they were making it from scratch and it would be another 15-20 minutes (...okay?). We said we were fine with that, got a couple of free drinks, and waited. Another 15-20 minutes later, a man dressed in a hoodie and t-shirt (maybe an owner, partner, idk?) comes by and asks if we're waiting on anything, and we say the cookie. At this point, its definitely close to an hour since we originally ordered it. The funny thing is that cookies were coming out left and right all night! Our waitress is avoiding us like the plague at this point. We have to ask the bus boy to send her over. She keeps apologizing, keeps saying it'll only be a few more minutes. And I know it's not her fault, but obviously there is a problem with the dessert and it's not being conveyed to us. If it's not available, just tell us! We decide to get the cookie to go and ask for the check (which takes her another 5 minutes at least to bring). We give her our card right away, but it takes another 10 minutes for her to bring the check back! Seems like she was stalling to try to bring the cookie with the check. She finally came back with the check and all she said was, "again I'm sorry about this". Nothing about the cookie. We just left at that point, absolutely livid that we sat around for an extra 45 minutes for a dessert that we never got. Thank you Antique Bar for a truly garbage night. Hopefully you can get your act together so the place isn't such an insane asylum. At this point, I don't attribute it to growing pains anymore. The place is just poorly run. Maybe improve your reservation model. And like some other reviews suggest, get rid of the high tops. They do not result in a nice dining experience, especially where they are located (basically two feet away from the bathroom doors). I feel bad that I highly recommended this place to several people after our first visit.
2017-11-12,5,I've lived in Hoboken for a bit now and have enjoyed the bread from Antique for several years before the renovation. We were really excited when the new space opened and so far have gone for two dinners and a brunch. The Highlights:- Drink menu is fantastic and served in great vintage glasses-HOT OIL SHRIMP- I like the open back space and seeing the kitchen happening- the atmosphere itself is really fun-waitstaff is generally great and are working their best in a very busy businessFYI (not criticism but things you may want to know)- I have no idea how you'd get a stroller in here.  I have no kids and only go with my husband or friends, but it is definitely a tighter space. -the wait can be a bit ::get the cocktails!!:: in the evening.  Do not go in on a peak time on the weekend and expect to be seated immediately. They don't have a traditional reservation system and you will have to wait. If you can't handle this, maybe try another time.  Highly recommend for Brunch, Drinks, Dinner, and of course, bread.
2017-11-12,3,Came here for brunch.  After arrival, we discovered that they don't have a traditional brunch menu.  And the menu they have is very limited.The meal we got was pretty good.  But the prices were high, the portions were meh, and the service wasn't great- I think they initially lost our order or something.  I wouldn't hold that against them, because the service is probably usually better than what my table experienced.On the way out, we were still hungry, so we got some bakery goods.  A donut and cookie.  They were dry and not sweet enough for desserts.  The whole point of a dessert is to taste good, not to try to be a health food version of a dessert.  Fail.I'm not a huge fan of the menu, so I probably wouldn't come back, though if you like the items on the menu and don't mind relatively high prices, it's not a terrible place to visit.  Would not recommend the bakery desserts.
2017-11-12,2,If it wasn't for the lovely hostess, I would've given one star. But she deserves 5 stars on her own for dealing with the rest of that staff today. Let me start with the food, since it was at least edible. There's a twist to every dish, and not necessarily in the best way. Might just be my opinion. My friend's mimosa was sprinkled with black pepper.. odd pairing one might say? My burger was on a bun that was toasted so well that I couldn't bite into it. The top of the bun was even harder and holding the fries so I gave up on the bun altogether. The worst part- the waitress did not want to work today, clearly huffing and puffing and buzzing her "f-words" around our table. Her half-hearted "thank you" at the end of our meal was unpleasant too. Hate to give a bad review, but a little criticism can be useful.
2017-11-08,4,We swung by very late in the evening for supper. The vibe in this place is so different from most places in Hoboken. It's vibrant, cool and quirky. More East Village or Jersey City in it's vibe. It was a busy evening and the staff had clearly had a busy shift. That said, they we're still very pleasant. The food is thoughtful, rich and wood oven cooked. Nothing on the menu is 'standard fare' you'd see elsewhere, it has the surprise and unexpected quality that hip NY joints have. The menu alternates a fair bit, and everything we ate was good but try the Spaghetti squash carbonara. It was amazeballs. Couple of negatives for this place: 1) the wine list is dreadful. Can't put it any other way. It's a miss. Secondly, the menu itself is virtually impossible to decipher - I think this is one example of taking the unexpected / hip restaurant thing too far. But overall a gem, among a sea of sports bars pizza and meat joints in Hoboken.
2017-11-01,1,This wasn't my first time there, in fact I have had a great time previously there when they first opened. But this, this was amateur hour at its finest.  They hired a new Bartender who openly admitted she hadn't been behind a bar in two years. For an artisanal bar with what is an over priced bar(charging 9 dollars for a can cider that you can easily find in town for 4-5 dollars, not to mention I also work in the industry and I know exactly how much they get their liqour/wine/beer, their robbing you) that's embarrassing, especially since they thrive to stand out as "unique." She forgot our orders from first drinks, apps, and even our entrees. We waited 30 minutes before they embarrassedly admitted that they forgot to put our order in. Besides their extremely poor excuse of service, they better quickly realize that charging beers a 3 dollar mark up above a standard price than their neighbor bars and their soon to be played out menu,  isn't going to cut anymore.  Also, this is something out of norm for me to do. But service was that bad and after realizing the pricing, I highly would recommend not to even waste your time or money. You can easily go to downtown Jersey City more for your money.
2017-10-30,5,Over achiever.  Very tasty food amazing garlic bread good atmosphere . Two thumbs up, try the ribeye and casino shrimp ridiculous
2017-10-29,2,We had a reservation for 11 and were forced to wait 20 mins for a bartender to show up.  Following that delay we were told wait an additional 40 minutes for a table.  Upon finally getting a table, they sat us at four small tables with enough seating for 8, not the 11 we had a reservations for.  We heard good things, unfortunately we were unable to experience it.
2017-10-29,5,My family lives in Jersey and we live in Queens, so it's always a pain to find a place in-between to meet for birthday dinners. We usually end up in Hoboken, but until Antique opened, we had to deal with crappy bar snacks and a bunch of televisions blaring. Antique Bar and Bakery is a game changer--it's beautifully and thoughtfully designed, the staff are uniformly adorable, charming and on the ball, and the food! OMG, the food!The food is incredible. Last night, we had lobster pasta (HOLY SHIT, SO GOOD!), hangar steak, baked oysters, the fresh mozzarella (shut up, we were hungry), oh, and smashed potatoes, which were like crispy little bits of heaven. I still think about the pesto farro they served at our wedding, but I'm kind of glad it wasn't on the menu last night, so I could branch out a little. Oh, yeah--we love this place so much we got married there. The dim lighting, cool 70s garage bands, psychedelic projections, and vintage wallpaper and artwork are utterly unexpected for Hoboken, which has had so much of its scene ruined by frat boy sports fans. It reminds me of the Hoboken I used to love, back in the '80s, when Maxwells was fun. My only reservation about the place is that I'm not sure Hoboken deserves it. Reading some of these snippy reviews by diners who would have been happier at Chili's or Applebee's makes me wonder about you people.
2017-10-29,1,Just tried to eat here with my well behaved kid and baby. No one acknowledged us for 10 minutes while we stood there, only a waitress asked us to move out of the way. The people in the front I would have thought were hosts were playing some game with an older kid and couldn't be bothered to open the door. Very rude especially since we couldn't exactly plop ourselves at the bar, so we walked out.
2017-10-28,4,Huge fan of their reimagined space. Visited a few times and each time lead to its own story and experience, all with happy endings. Its a fascinating space that serves up unique cocktails, reimagined classic dishes, and quirky entertainment options (think karaoke but done with movie scenes). If you are a non-all the time hardcore sports bar fan looking for a different night out, or perhaps a banging brunch do yourself a favor and visit this spot. A few notes to make your experience supreme: be patient with the service, they aren't the quickest on the uptake so be aware of that, the menu - albeit super cool - is difficult to navigate (ask for help if you need it), and put aside some extra cash because it can get a little pricey because you will be tempted to try a few things. Strap yourself in and enjoy the ride! Antique Bakery is taking off!
2017-10-28,4,I really like this place it is a great venue and interesting menu. We got a small bar table in the back by the kitchen. The mixed drink menu is interesting and not sweet. Their menu seems to be more for big tables. But they have good size appetizers. We got 2 apps and split an entree and a side. It was plenty and good. I think the food was good my husband says it is not his taste profile.
2017-10-28,4,5 stars for the vibe, 3.5 stars for the food.  Not that there was anything wrong with the food.  It seemed very well prepared and my wife really enjoyed it.  Just not really my flavor palette.  They did an amazing job on the renovation.  Very funky décor.  We sat right next to the wide open kitchen which was very cool to watch.  Staff was attentive and friendly.  Definitely on the dark and loud side.  We started with the Spaghetti Squash Carbonara and Rice Ball apps.  Both were yummy although the rice balls had some uneven very spicy bits.  Had the lasagna edges for dinner.  Wanted to love it, very flavorful but just thought the sauces, spices and cheese were not the best combo.  We had a French red wine which was very nice.  Looking forward to going back and further exploring the menu.
2017-10-27,2,Overpriced for what you get.  The 2 of us ordered a hangar steak, lasagna edges, and an arugula salad appetizer.  No drinks, no sides, no dessert. $80 including tip.  Overall the food quality was good (except for the arugula salad which looked like it was on top of a mush of something that looked and tasted like garlic hummus).  They crank up the volume on 70ish music which is annoying when you're trying to eat dinner and have a conversation.  Interesting decor and they hand you the bill inside a pocket-sized paperback book which was popular in the 60s and 70s.  But overall, it wasn't worth the cost.
2017-10-21,2,The food was excellent and really deserves 4 stars, but unfortunately the good food did not make up for the lack of consistency. The bottomline is, this place is super small and they have a tiny kitchen and bar. The staff can't keep up with the demand so the overall experience for the diner is at best, fair. We waited for an hour for a table, ok, fine. The bar was so packed with waitresses trying to get drinks for their tables that we had to wait 15 mins for a drink..mind you we were sitting at the bar in front the bartender. Once he got around to us, the drink was good. Our appetizers came our quickly but our meal was served 35-40 mins later. During that time at least 4 people came to ask us if we needed anything...yes, food! The waitresses were in weird outfits; just wear a uniform. The highlight was seeing Rocco from RHONY. Despite the good food, I don't think I'll be back.
2017-10-19,5,Went for dinner on wednesday 10/18 with my wife and daughter. With the help of our waitress katherine who was awesome we ordered hot oil shrimp, burnt lasagna, steak, burnt broccoli, plantains. everything had a unique flavor. to top it off we had bread pudding and their special cookie, one would have been enough and both were excellent.
2017-10-18,2,This place is overrated for food. Maybe one of Hoboken's few trendy places to eat..but stick to the drinks. Way overpriced and service is way too slow. Food is average at best.
2017-10-12,1,My previous rating was for the real Antique Bakery, not this place.  I don't know why these guys took Antique Bakery's branding and even their yelp page.  I have been here a few times and every time I walk away thinking how obnoxious the people who work here are.  Whether it's for dinner or when I come in to get some coffee, I always leave feeling that the people who work here consider customers to be an inconvenience.  On top of the poor service, the food is very overpriced and nothing special.  I am done with this place.
2017-10-06,5,Our server Cristina hit it out of the park with her energy, description of the menu and personality.  When we had questions about specific wines on the wine list she went out of her way to bring us a sample of each wine.  Our food was on point, cooked perfectly and the timing was impeccable.  Highly recommend.  We will be back soon!  Thanks for making our night so special Cristina!!!
2017-09-30,2,Went here last night with another couple. Ordered mussels, shrimp, rice balls, and sausage bread apps. Mussels and rice balls and sausage bread were delicious. 2 of 4 at our table thought the shrimp were not fresh: mushy, fishy, and generally unpalatable. For dinner, we ordered the $115 bone-in ribeye and a hangar steak. The waitress discouraged us from ordering the hangar because she said the ribeye was huge, 40 ounces (the menu said 2 pounds plus) but we took her word it would be a large steak and nixed the hangar steak. She also said the $52 lobster pasta was 1.5 lobster. When our entrees came, the steak, though cooked well (we ordered medium rare) and very tasty, looked like about 25 ounces (including bone). There 5 smallish slices of steak on the bone. 5. My husband tried to scrape more meat off the bone but wasn't very successful. It just wasn't a lot of meat. Not what one would expect of a $115 steak. The lobster pasta was a similar situation. Barely any meat in the half shell (only one half shell) but a lot of breadcrumbs. The claw meat that was supposed to be mixed into the pasta was, well, we had a tough time finding it. We mentioned the lobster to the waitress, didn't even bother bringing up the steak. And she said, well, this is the first time I've heard this (complaint) but said she was happy for the feedback because she likes customers to be happy. Then we ordered two desserts and coffees and in the end nothing was comped, not even the coffees. We were very surprised. The waitress also forgot to bring the ice cream I ordered as well as forgot a drink. Overall there was an issue with service and an false advertising problem with the menu.
2017-09-30,1,Omg..how disappointing.  Place is SO small, barely any room at the bar, then they stick you at a TINY hightop table, so small I said to my date,  how are two dinner plates even going to fit on this!? Well, because the portions are so small served on tiny plates! Lol... But the worst is The place is SO DARK!!! YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING ON YOUR PLATE!!..  DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU'RE EATING! !!Would never recommend or go back, since there are So many other nice restaurant..And food was just ok!
2017-09-24,3,Nice interior and vibe. They play oldies but I thought the music was a bit too loud. Our server was friendly and informative. Now the food: Squash carbonara: this was delicious with a fried egg. It almost taste like real carbonara. But feels a lot healthier.Black bass: they didn't get rid of the scale and the fish didn't taste fresh. Lasagna ends: loved the cheese. This was the best dish Hanger steak: perfectly done as a medium cooked. Tender and meaty. Tl;Dr so-so in the Hoboken area. Everything with cheese tasted good, but the rest just weren't up to par.
2017-09-24,2,This was my third try here and don't see myself going back. The only decent part of this place is the hostess staff as they were really sweet, but even then their reservation system sucks and you will always wait 30+ minutes in the narrow bar area to be seated. Lots of close calls to either have food spilled on you while the wait staff walks by and the dangerously close candles on the tiny ledge. Once we were seated, we met our waitress who was inattentive and a bit cocky when she wasaround. Had to keep grabbing other staff to get my drinks refreshed. Perhaps because they believe they are the hottest place in hoboken, they cut corners on service and food quality-- yet still charge a lot of money for it. It was annoying that the food didn't come out all at once. When I asked the staff where the rest of the food was, the staff said that the entrees always comes out staggered, instead of just apologizing and saying that it is on its way. . ...... how does it make sense to give me only some of my entree and then wait 15 minutes to receive the sauce the goes with it.  This is what you call service? Fucking rude and pretentious. I asked for the hanger steak to be medium. It was medium well / well done and it was the toughest piece of meat I've ever chewed. It was so exhausting that I just ate a fourth of it. Disappointing.Overall-- this is just a knockoff /wannabe Brooklyn hipster restaurant. Because it looks so different than everywhere else in hoboken, people will continue to come. But ultimately it's too expensive for the quality of food and I'm better off going to my old favorites in the neighborhood.
2017-09-22,5,Came here last night with my boyfriend.  We really debated between a 4 and 5 star review but i decided to go with the 5 because the food was amazing and we certainly plan to come back for more.  The inside decor as mentioned by other reviewers is really cool.  They restored an old bakery from what i understand, and added some cool retro decor on top of it.  I also understand that it exists as a bakery during the day, offering their fresh breads and treats, some of which you can order through the restaurant (see STUFFED breads -- Mmmm). It was *very* packed when we came in so we suggest making a reservation or expect to wait.  Due to our lack of reservation we ended up taking a slightly awkward bar top table which is partly why we debated the 4 star review here.  It would have been nice to be back in the restaurant away from all of the foot traffic.  But anyway - we ordered their proscuitto & prov stuffed bread, lobster pasta, and half chicken + grilled zucchini side.  Everything was amazing.  I actually was very uninterested in the chicken that my boyfriend wanted to order but it ended up being so SO tastey and juicey.  They have a short wine menu, but the bottles are very nicely priced and the one we had was pretty good (~$40 - Tempranillo).  The only other drawback was the slightly slow service, but to be fair our server was very well informed and also very busy.Overall great experience and we plan to be back to try other things on their menu!
2017-09-19,2,Went here on a Tuesday night. Were told no less than 4 times by the hostess, "only a few more minutes." After more than an hour of waiting we left. This place needs to learn how to manage a wait and set expectations. Very disappointed.
2017-09-18,1,Read the great reviews about this place, and was excited to try it, but we will not return. When you make a reservation it is only a holding spot, not an actual reservation.After hearing this when we arrived we were upset.  Luckily we sat quite quickly when we arrived, but we had to sit in a high top seat which was annoying, but we made it work. It is VERY loud in here, so its hard to hold a conversation. I enjoy music and having a good time, but you can barely hear the person sitting next to you. The service was just okay, we had to ask for our server a few times since random people would walk by and we didn't see her for a bit. The food was not good.  Had the cheese platter with cured meats, only two different cheese options and deli meat. The server did not even tell us which cheeses we had. No explanation at all.  Not worth the $20 plus price tag. For dinner I had the half a chicken with street corn, it was bland and way overpriced for the amount of food you got. I do not mind paying for food if it is good or worthy, but this was junk.  My friend had the lasagna she said it was pretty awful. Our wine was hot which made it super uncomfortable to sit in there and drink since it was very warm in the restaurant as it was. Lastly, we ordered the decadent cookie which was supposed to take 20 mins, ours came out in 5 mins which was nice to be quick on the delivery, but we could tell it sat and was pre-made. It was not hot and we ended up pushing it aside after two bites. Save your time and money, go elsewhere. This spot is overpriced, too loud, has crap food and isn't worth the wait if you are someone who gets stuck up to an hour like they told us may happen.
2017-09-12,5,I've been here 6 times, every thing I have eaten has been spectacular. Also, their cocktails are AMAAZZZINNNG. Love you Joe, Paul, and Elyse thanks for a great time every time!
2017-09-11,5,Hoboken needs more places like this! My wife and I are relatively young and like to go out for dinner on the weekends. We typically go to NYC because we are tired of the typical sports bars in Hoboken that draw the in school crowd. We also heard about 4 other people say Hoboken needs more places like this. Awesome atmosphere, super hip, friendly staff, and good food. It gets 5 stars for a great start to a new category of Hoboken restaurants!!
2017-09-11,5,Wow ! What a great place for date night. We haven't gone out much since having kids so we thought what better place than this lively restaurant in Hoboken. We could not have had a better time! To start we were greeted by the perky and enthusiastic Amanda, who positively set the tone for the night. Even after the 35 minute wait, we were excited and hungry as ever. The wait staff was on top of us throughout the whole night, and the atmosphere felt more like hanging with a bunch of friends than dining at a restaurant. The rice balls are so on point, I wanted to order more for the road. The hanger steak with that sauce, I think the borderlain sauce ( spelling may be off) was absolutely killer! My wife is the best cook I know and even she was thoroughly impressed. We didn't get a chance to try any drinks but from the way the bar was vibing they looked enticing. I can't praise this place enough. The music,  the atmosphere , the look and most importantly the food. Definitely will recommend this place to the few friends I have and am looking forward to dining here soon !
2017-09-10,4,Good addition to lower Hoboken that's classy and not the "bro" type environment.  Cocktails are tasty but only limited selections.   Overall ambience is good for a date night or can be a casual get together.
2017-09-10,4,Drink are pretty good and very good ambiance for a small group or a date. We tried 2 of the dishes at dinner time but felt like you got way too small portions for the price. Somewhat overpriced but overall it was good still. Tight space for large groups but good service.
2017-09-09,5,Where do I even start?? From the second you walk in the door, Antique is such an experience! From the decor to the staff, I loved every minute of our visit here. We had drinks while we waited for our table, which were so amazing (the all the way is my favorite!) and the bartenders were all so fun. The host, Amanda, did her best to get us seated quickly even though it was a super busy night, and we only waited about 30 minutes in the end-much appreciated! The food is the star of antique, everything was so great. We had a couple seafood appetizers, the lasagna edges and the ribeye, which is hands down the best steak I've ever had. You muuuust try the sides, especially the French onions!! Our waitress, Cristine, was so knowledgeable and fun, she helped us pick everything out and was such a treat. We will be back soon!!
2017-09-09,1,Ew. Literally just walked out after spending $300. Kept rushing us out the door. Food was good but service was soooooo ridiculous. Servers were wearing skimpy clothes, kept taking our food away when we were still eating... fine your food is good but the service we received was beyond sub par. Couldn't enjoy our eating experience because they kept rushing us out. Rude rude rude and a little bit of skanky.
2017-09-03,1,We would've loved to have tried their food, but they didn't honor our "reservation". We checked in, hung out at the bar for an hour and had a drink (after waiting 15 minutes for someone to notice we were there). The drinks were weak at best, but tasty. Nobody even offered us a menu. The hipster bartender with the passé handlebar mustache was extremely rude to colleagues and customers alike. He yelled at servers and bar backs who were trying to support him. There was no management anywhere, thus the free-for-all atmosphere. It's a shame as their music was great and it's a beautiful setting.  I give them 6 months if they don't change their infrastructure!
2017-09-03,5,The best mozzarella cheese. The breads and meats are always excellent too, but that cheese is one of the best I've ever had & I've had a lot.
2017-09-03,4,Cool spot, good food, good service, great breads, worth a visit.Scene:I love that they revived this old institution and kept it nostalgic with a new age twist. You can see the guys baking, the really hot oven doors and coals burning, making the ambiance really great and cozy and warm and romantic.Food:The menu is interesting, different, and posh. Kind of limited though. Definitely try the breads, but get them stuffed with dipping sauce or else they are a bit too dry. We like the sausage one a lot. They are huge but they save well and reheat well. The appetizers are all yummy, it's good munchies.Drinks:They have some cool twists on popular drinks and a full bar which is great. Brunch drinks are tasty and dinner cocktails are interesting and flavorful. Definitely a good drinks spot.Service:We were impressed by the staff, they are like a family. They all hug when they greet each other every morning or shift. They are friendly and you can tell they want to be there and have fun. It's not amazing attentive service or anything but they are genuinely nice people.Top things:Coffee cake, sausage bread, cocktails.Avoid:Pre made breakfast sandwich (dry), bread with only cheese, or showing up an hour before brunch as they will kick you out of your seat.
2017-08-26,5,This renovation-creation is a really hip, edgy vibe with amazing quality cocktails and food. They don't have a traditional reservation system but you can actually make a res on OpenTable. The bar scene is really lively where you wait until your table is ready. The highlight was dessert - the bread pudding is an absolute must. I can't wait to try more drinks and food when I go back!
2017-08-25,4,Amazing bar scene w Mustache Mike!Espresso Martini and the old fashion were anything but ordinary!Super spot.  Gonna come back soon and dominate the Dirty Ribeye for $115..
2017-08-22,5,By far the best spot to eat in Hoboken. Great food, atmosphere, & service. Our waitress, the pink hair extraordinaire, went above & beyond to explain the food menu & drink options. Thanks to her recommendations, we got the beef cheek parm, the burnt beefsteak tomato toast, the ribeye, and the razor clams. So delicious- bold and balanced flavors all around! We enjoyed watching mustache Mike, mix our craft cocktails behind the bar, while we waited to be seated at our table. The All The Way & the Blind Tom were my favorites. To finish things off, we got the TCB- a golden banana split. Over all, we had a great experience & cannot wait to come back & try more of the menu.
2017-08-21,5,Went on Saturday night for our anniversary. One word sums it up...AMAZING! The unique combinations of flavors and spices bring every dish to another life! We had a few apps for starters. The Beef Cheek Parm, Smoky Mutz, Hot Oil Shrimp, Dirty Lemon and Spring Peas & Rice Balls, Burnt Mint Aioli. They were ALL AMAZING. So hard to describe, you HAVE TO TRY EVERYTHING! I just know that the shrimp, tasted like we were on a beach and just caught them and whatever seasoning they put in it, just enhanced that experience and made us feel like we just caught them and they ate. SO GOOD! For entrees, we had Lasagna Edges (just deliciousness cheesy goodness), Burnt Butter Mushrooms, Hard Herbs & Cheese Toast, Hard Herb Hanger with a coal baked side called Smashed Golds & Garlic Scape. For dessert, we had the Peanut Butter, Bacon & Banana Split. Such a wonderful way to end this delicious experience. Chef Paul and his crew really outdid themselves. They did not disappoint. Please do yourself a favor and EAT HERE! You won't regret it!
2017-08-20,4,Love it! Stop by the cafe this morning to pickup a breakfast sandwich n cafe mocha n a freshly baked chocolate scone! Just yum! No words for it! The total cost it's a bit pricey but worth the price! Will come back to try other items again!
2017-08-19,3,Ambiance is great. Food is subpar and pricey. Service was slow. We had the following:-Garlic bread - amazing-Mozzarella special - like a ball of glue-Lasagna ends - inedible; very salt-Radiator pesto pasta - bland-Potatoes and scapes - pretty good-Hushpuppies - very good-Corn - very goodCocktails were interesting and tasty.Caveat that we're vegetarian and meat dishes may be better.
2017-08-18,2,I was so, so, so looking forward to dinner at Antique Bakery. Unfortunately, this is the worst birthday dinner I've ever had. Long story short, I had high expectations that fell well short and I will never be back. First of all, they DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS. We made ressies on OpenTable but when they called to confirm ours, they said basically they run a "guest list." Say what? Okay well then. Except they don't. We arrived 5 min before our "reservation" but there was a miscommunication between the two hostesses, one of whom said "Ok, 9:15?" while the other was checking us into the "guest list" and then corrected her. We go wait in the bar and fortunately get seats a few minutes after ordering. Cocktails are just bad. Way too citrusy, no levels of flavor, etc. Then, 50 minutes after our arrival (right at 9:15..... maaaaybe a coincidence....) our table is ready. We are starving so order a bunch of food, which very unfortunately is hit and miss. Hits: razor clam pasta, rice balls.  Misses: fish special (bland, I can make better at home), and the kale side (seriously inedible - burned!). It was my birthday and we skipped dessert. Maybe I should have started with that! On top of that, they were out of the first two wines (off a list of less than 10) we ordered, the "lasagna ends" are not even in a tomato sauce (and they were out of lasagna noodles so it was penne with mushrooms in a butter sauce?) and some "VIP" the owner knew or was trying to impress showed up 30 min after us and was seated 15 minutes before us. Oh and every person we sat next to (including the VIP) was disappointed. One and done.
2017-08-15,2,So I finally tried it out and was excited. The place was much bigger than I expected.  The food I had was excellent (Lasagne edges). I had side of charred Zucchini which was good but overpriced at $11.00. My biggest complaint was a glass of port for $14.  The Port was Fonseca Bin 27. A Ruby that is OK but not great.  The pour was 2 Oz.  That means they are selling that bottle for $177.  Totally outrageous! The manager claimed that 2oz was standard which it is NOT! Typical pour is 3 to 4 oz. I came away spending $100 for  main, side and 3 drinks.  As an aside the music is way too loud. Not inclined to return.
2017-08-14,4,Unique menu with delicious flavor combinations. My boyfriend and I came with another couple we were visiting who recently moved to Hoboken. Loved the atmosphere which somehow manages to marry a traditional bakery with a hipster bar/restaurant.Definitely get the rice balls to start. We also tried the beefsteak tomatoes which were decent but a tad salty on the pesto. The "banana" app was also delicious, consisting of a whole plantain coated in chilis, chili oil and roasted garlic. The ribeye entree is enough for 4 to share if you're going for a family style kind of night. Also topped with some chilis (not too hot) and accompanied by your choice of sauce. We went for the herb butter which was reminiscent of a chimichurri to me. As for sides, get the Greek fries and Hoboken street corn. This could be a pricey meal depending on what you order but perfect for a date or special occasion.
2017-08-12,3,The music is far too loud during early dinner service, even early. That may be particular to where we were seated in the adjunct narrow right hand side vs. the back. We both had a little difficulty with the menu as in it's difficult to read, especially in the low light. My friend and I ordered the same pasta main. I liked it; she did not. We agreed it was overpriced. My friend also noted that it smelled too much like the kitchen for the prices charged. I didn't mind the smell of garlic wafting about. They need to tune the menu to have a at least one lower cost protein mains. The low cost, high margin item was a half chicken for $23 (no sides).The greeting and service was terrific. Unique atmosphere and menu in Hoboken which is appreciated.
2017-08-12,1,One of the worst dining experiences in recent history. DO NOT come here on a weekend night with a large party (or really ever, for that matter) Here's why:1. Horrible table placement. They tried to seat 13 people at a table that, at max, sat 8. People couldn't get up throughout the entire dinner, because we were blocked in by the table next to us.Every time the waiter/busboy/customer walked by the table, I was hit in the head or pushed in my chair Bc space was so tight.2. Busboy spilled a plate of food down my back.  The manager's offer? "We will pay for your dry cleaning."  No offer to remove the meal from the bill.3. Service in general was abominable.  Took forever to get drinks when ordered.  4. Three out of 8 people didn't get their ordered entrees.  When it came time to pay the bill the manager insisted we pay for one of the entrees we never received.5. Music was INSANELY loud.  The waiter couldn't hear us when we ordered.  Had to repeat ourselves several times and literally scream into his ear.6. Prices are absurd for the quality of the food. A side of dry hush puppies is 10 bucks.  If the food was actually good I wouldn't mind paying it...alas, it isn't.6. Last but not least, the owner of this place is an asshole. We spoke with him on our way out and he offered NADA by way of apology. When we stated that he was basically ensuring that 8 people would never return to his establishment, he replied, "I'm OK with that."Do not spend too much of your hard earned money on a subpar meal with horrible service here.  Too many other good spots to try.*** Important to note: My group consisted of really good people. We are all adults, in our 30s, who have all worked as servers in restaurants at one time or another.  When the bill came we checked that gratuity was included.  It wasn't.  So we made sure to leave the server a respectable tip despite our horrific experience.  This is not a customer issue.  This is an "Antique and it's owner" issue.
2017-08-12,5,Dim lights, motown blasting, rustic-chic bar and amazing cocktails set the scene for a cool bar/restaurant reminiscent of cocktail bars in NYC. I love that you can call ahead and the staff is so nice and accommodating. The food is delicious and menu is designed for sharing. I especially loved the rice balls and lasagna edges. The drinks are amazing. If you're looking for a cool, hip dinner out for a date or a night with the girls, this is a great pick.
2017-07-28,4,I used to buy bread here - such an interesting changeover into a restaurant !It's a bit in the privy side but the food is good. Eclectic photos on the wall - Bathroom has contact sheets with pictures of Hoboken scenes and people - Looks like a fun place and I'll be back
2017-07-24,5,Antique Bar and Bakery opened about 6 months ago and, from what I can tell, it's off to a rousing start. I had the pleasure of eating there on July 23rd and was, from top to bottom, thoroughly impressed.It's refreshing to see a restaurant in Hoboken with real personality. Thematically, atmosphere is solidly rooted in the 70s. It's a dark / casual vibe that blends from bar to fine dining with ease.The menu is inventive and a pleasure to read. Again, terrific attention to detail with the movie script themed menu - don't forget to read the editor's notes. You might miss some good additions.Prices are closer to Manhattan with entrees from $27 to $99 (dinner for 2) and cocktails coming in at $14 each. That said, I have no problem with the pricing since it delivers on a great night.Excited to come back for bar-only activities some night soon. Apparently they switch to a bar menu until 2am and drinks are served until 3am. Again, rare for Hoboken.
2017-07-19,5,This is the best restaurant I have been to in Hoboken. I dined at the Antique Bar and Bakery on  a Friday night by making a reservation through Open Table. We had to wait about 10-15 minutes past our 8pm reservation time, however it was not unpleasant.We grabbed drinks at the bar prior to dinner and were shortly seated at the kitchen counter, which was such an awesome surprise. We were able to watch the chefs cook every dish, which was extremely entertaining and enjoyable for me. We tried the garlic bread and the pepperoni bread as an appetizer. These were absolutely delicious and it could have be an entire meal on its own .For the main dishes we shared Hard Herb Hanger and Mussels with Green Garlic Butter & Bread. Both were fabulous. The green sauce used in the Mussels was insane and it is served with more bread to dip!The chef completed our meal with a complimentary dessert that was not on the menu. It was a peanut butter ice cream with a berry sauce that was incredible.Overall the experience was amazing and we left stuffed and happy.
2017-07-16,5,Nestled in a neighborhood with tree lined streets and beautifully renovated brownstones, this once bustling bakery has been converted into a quaint little eatery with the perfect marriage of yesteryear and millennial chic. The DJs eclectic mix of hip-hop, R&B, Jazz, and Rock will have you dancing in your seat and humming along to songs from your childhood as you savor each bite of the delectable menu options. I had the pleasure of celebrating my birthday here, and am so grateful to the warm and welcoming staff for making it a memorable evening. Amanda, the hostess with the mostest, greeted us at the door and quickly made arrangements for our reserved seating-she also made it a point to thank us for choosing Antique Bakery, as we were leaving. In fact, everyone on staff makes you feel like you're a distant relative, stopping in for a visit. But, it must be mentioned that we were especially lucky to have Christine as our attendant, for the evening. She guided us on our culinary expedition and encouraged us to delight our palates with a variety of delectable treats. Boy we're we delighted! Wether your celebrating a birthday, life, a new job, or just needing a good place to break bread with friends, I highly recommend you give this little gem a try. A few menu suggestions: If traveling in groups of 3 or more, try ordering a trip of entrees and sides to share. My squad and I shared their amazing roasted garlic bread, hanger steak, a pasta dish, and the beet salad. We were extremely satisfied. For dessert, most recommend the bread pudding, which is divine, but I personally love the cannoli Sunday. It's absolutely delicious!!
2017-07-13,4,Food was very good .. presentation great with rustic simplicity with lots of fresh herbs . Atmosphere is eclectic hipsterdom, extremely noisy and some seating arrangements are a bit off as in a few inches too low from table ( couch in back) Great service and friendly management .. mix drink a little light on alcohol balance but it was a warm day. If your ok with noise factor, you have a great meal and pay for it.
2017-07-10,5,Trendy and fun -great food it was like being in NYC I'll definitely be back! They had amazing cocktail choices. Love the decor! I had the lobster pasta!
2017-07-10,4,My husband and I came here early on a Thursday night so we could try to avoid the weekend craziness.  We were seated on the side of the front room, which at the time had zero customers besides us, which was a little awkward.  I love my husband but if I wanted to sit in an empty room and have dinner together we would have just stayed home.  Especially in a place like this you come for the vibe & atmosphere.  We of course shyly asked if there was any way we could move to the back room which seemed much more lively and luckily they obliged.  Later on when we walked out the front room was very busy so I think ultimately it would have been fine, but I'm thankful they were okay with moving us.Onto the real stuff.....We had the blood orange margaritas which were very very good, loved them!  I'm a former bartender and a bit picky about cocktails, they are doing these well.  For food we ordered the squash carbonara app, the hanger steak, & the lobster pasta.  The squash carbonara was good, but likely not something I would order again.  The hanger steak and the pasta were both delicious. The steak is definitely a bit of a small portion but it was cooked perfectly and very tasty!  It comes sliced with your choice of a dressing on the side.  The lobster pasta comes over large spaghetti (I'm not sure if that is the correct term) with a half breaded lobster & claw on top.  I kept going back and forth with which one I liked better but I think the lobster won overall.We go out in NYC often and like to treat ourselves to a nice dinner, but this place is not cheap - $54 for the lobster pasta.  I think for Hoboken, the land of BYOB's it was a little bit of sticker shock - the bill with a few drinks each was $200+ for 2 ppl,  but I still walked out feeling good about it which is all that matters right??
2017-07-07,3,Overall, I will say 3.5. This place is almost too cool for downtown Hoboken. I can't imagine a lot of bros going here, but that's a good thing. We came in the Sunday of July 4th weekend with a late reservation at 8:15. I was surprised how busy the place was. They really did a great job with the space, I used to go to the bakery quite a bit, obviously it's very different now. The decor looks like an estate sale from an artsy old man. For some reason it works, even with the paneling. It's quirky but sets a cool tone. The hostess was a doll, let us get a drink while they set our table up and they brought us to our table and brought our drinks to us.We were seated by the open kitchen, unfortunately next to the service station which was kind of annoying because the space is already small. Our server was friendly and answered any questions we have. I will say, I didn't like the menu layout at all. I know they are going for a movie script theme but it was just too all over the place. It was too much on the page. Chill it out a bit. We started with the fresh mutz special which was about a half pound of mutz with a few small tomatoes and one piece of bread. It was great until we got the bill, this was $25 which is absolutely obscene for what it was. I could get like 2 pounds of mutz at Fiore's for that. So if you are ordering specials be ready to pay a hefty price for them. For meals I got the hanger steak and a side of Greek Fries, the wife got the radiator pasta. Hers was good, not amazing but good. My steak was delicious albeit on the smaller size for that price point on hanger steak. The greek fries were good, but the star of that dish was the creamy feta cheese. We decided to order bread pudding for dessert, it was a huge portion, but the top was burnt beyond recognition and wasn't even edible, which is disappointing, once you got down into it though it was very good.Overall, a good spot that has a fun atmosphere. The food is good but really for downtown Hoboken it is overpriced for what we seemed to get(but the beer is priced great). I'd come back but it wouldn't be a regular spot for me.
2017-07-06,3,If you want a trendy spot for a good Instagram, go to Antique. Like any trendy place the prices are high, so be prepared for a $14 cocktail (That being said, the Blind Tom gin cocktail was delicious).  Reservation is needed and even with a reservation, the staff still makes you wait to hit up the bar. The staff was nice, but rushed you from the moment you sat down. Overall, the food was good but not great.
2017-07-05,5,After hearing (and seeing!) so many great reviews about Antique Bar and Bakery I finally got to stop in. We ending up going for brunch one Saturday morning and didn't have to wait at all! We got two cocktails which were very unique and amazing! We split an appetizer of the Sticky Buns and they did not disappoint. I have never eaten a sticky bun like this in my life. So warm and ooey gooey is the only way to describe how soft the inside was! Our waiter and bus boys were so friendly and were able to make some great recommendations. My date got the burger which came with spicy fries and they were the best thing ever! I ended up getting the beet and sweet potato hash. So so yummy and very unique flavors mixed in. I cant wait to go back for the dinner menu!
2017-07-02,1,I went to this place because of all the good reviews here. But it was such a disappointment to us. We ordered lobster pasta, and it came with "extra ingredient", hair! Apparently it was not mine or my boyfriend's, both of us have dark hair, and the hair in the pasta is blond curly hair, really gross... I also ordered the popular porterhouse steak, which is over priced ($99), more expensive than Morton or other 5 star steakhouse, which is fine if the flavor justify it. Again, another disappointment, too salty on the outside but bland inside. The only dish we liked is the mussel and cocktail, for almost $150/person bill, I would expect much more.
2017-07-02,5,I love love love this place! Amazing food and the service was outstanding!! They take all your orders at once and bring it out to you when they're ready-- everything's made from scratch! Shrimp was marinated in a delicious sauce and sticky buns were served straight from the oven. Overall a really well run great establishment with phenomenal food.
2017-06-28,4,Thoroughly enjoyed this place. What they have done to the bakery I went to 20 years again is amazing. Cramped and chaotic, the food is amazing and the cocktails second to none. Octopus was phenomenal, shrimp was delicious, nettle pasta was wonderful. The chef has fresh chiles and orange peel infused in these dishes enhanced by the smoke of the coal fire.There are no short cuts. All is special and delicious.Go, but expect to be cramped in. We went on a Wednesday night and we just had to deal. I want to assure you, it's worth it. They try hard and they deliver
2017-06-28,5,Excellent addition to Hoboken food scene.  Great throwback ambiance, fun staff, great cocktails, and... great food!  I've lived in Hoboken for years and this is the best new place.
2017-06-27,4,Yummy baked goods and breakfast sandwiches.  We've only taken out, never ate in. The one time we tried to go for dinner, it was insanely loud, like unbearably loud, between the patrons and the music.  So we passed.  But for breakfast takeout, it's yummy, if a bit overpriced for Hoboken.
2017-06-27,2,SOME OF THE BEST FOOD IN HOBOKEN but..... I give this 2 stars SOLELY because of the experience I had. First bit of advice-- when the hostess asks you if you're okay sitting at the bakery tell them NO. Sitting at the bakery means you're literally sitting at the cashier.... on the cashier's side of the COUNTER.. on stools.... smelling the mix of coffee grinds and garbage. You'll also feel like you're in the way because the host and waiters are reaching under and around you for boxes and bags. You'll ALSO feel like you're an unpaid greeter because every time anyone walks in or leaves the restaurant you're the first/last person they see and they think you're the host. I got a last minute reservation for 2 and was told the wait might be 30-45 minutes- -for it being a Friday I had no problem and said we'd wait at the bar. The bartender ended up giving us two drinks on the house because he must have made the wrong order for someone else (plus points in my book).. these drinks ended up being the same drinks we were about to order so we were really sitting pretty at the bar. After about 45 minutes of waiting and two rounds of drinks-- a host comes up to us and says that we could be seated at the bakery now.. when we asked how long for an actual table all she said was " reallly long"... so of course we were going to go try to sit somewhere. Had I known what seating arrangement would have been.. I would have stayed seated a the bar and order from there. The bar was much more comfortable and a much better option than the make-shift excuse they provided. The food itself is out of this world and I WILL BE BACK-- but I'm hoping to try to get INTO the dining room next time.
2017-06-26,1,Tried this place 3 times want to like it! The service is beyond terrible. It's a shame! Cool new spot in hoboken but not worth the terrible service.
2017-06-24,5,Came here for dinner and had an amazing experience. First of all, the atmosphere is so unique. Really enjoyed the cozy feel of the dining room. We had a salad, pepperoni bread, rib eye for two and fingerling potatoes. Everything came out perfectly. The steak was phenomenal. Really looking forward to trying some other things on the menu.
2017-06-23,1,Never even made it to the food so this purely based off service. Made a reservation for 9:30, which they called to confirm, like any restaurant that takes and stands by their reservations does. We arrive and are told that we will be seated "soon" - we ask what soon means and apparently it's 30 minutes if we're lucky - and that they don't actually take reservations. Why bother to have a reservation on open table if you don't actually take reservations in practice? In the words of Seinfeld, it seems they know how to take a reservation but not how to hold one. Stick to one option - either you take reservations or you don't. Will not be going back - it's like they're trying to be city but don't know how to.
2017-06-18,5,Passing by this place after a walk in Hoboken. We decided to check it out since I had it bookmarked for a long time. There's bread and desserts display to the left of the entrance. We were definitely attracted by the bread. After talking to the cashier, we found out this place used to be a bakery and the bakery is now moved to Jersey City. The bread is still coming from the bakery itself. We decided to get the salami stuffed Italian bread a try. It turned to be very good, which reminded me of a calzone but not as cheesy. I would definitely like to come back here and try their food menu. And also visit the actual bakery in Jersey City.
2017-06-18,4,Brunch yesterday was very good, a little different, and perfect for our group of six plus baby. Portions are HUGE.  Music is too loud to have a nice conversation though, and at times runs the good food vibe. They can be cutting edge and successful without killing eardrums!
2017-06-17,5,We had dinner with some friends and absolutely loved the food and the vibe. Yes, it's expensive, but you know that before stepping foot in the place. We ate at the bar and had numerous cocktails, and awesome food. Fennel salad, hot oil shrimp, and shishito peppers for apps. Then had a whole striped bass and the dirty rib-eye for entrees. Banana split and the milkshake for dessert. It was all delicious and the service was very attentive. Will be back often.
