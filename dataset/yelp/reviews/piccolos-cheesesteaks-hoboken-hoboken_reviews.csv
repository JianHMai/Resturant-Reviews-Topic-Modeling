2021-11-15,5,The absolute best! I called up asked for a cheesesteak to go and boy did i get the experience with it! Patty boy answering the phone is a scene out of a movie. When you show up it all makes sense. They make incredible cheesesteaks different then any other place. I got the cheesesteak with hot peppers it was so good and not to heavy. Next time i may have to order 2 of them! Wow so happy i found this place. Thank you Patty it was really incredible. Love this neighborhood spot.
2021-09-02,4,Haven't been to this gem since quarantine and I was so excited to come back! I'm incredibly happy that they're still in business and hope they will continue to stick around.Their cheesesteaks are $10 each and they only accept cash. Luckily, they have an ATM right near the door. Their portions are very generous and the whole sandwich was filled to the brim with fillings.I'm not a huge fan of peppers so my usual order doesn't involved that, but that might be up your alley. The onions, on the other hand, are so good with this sandwich. The meat tasted pretty good, was slightly tougher this time around and that's what's pushing me to a 4 stars but it's usually more tender. Combo of sweet onions, savory meat, toasted baguette, and creamy cheese whiz here is *chef's kiss*Do not skimp on this place, I know I will definitely be back
2021-07-24,5,Looking for something to eat a coworker told me stop by Piccolos for a cheesesteak, I'm glad he told me.best place I have eaten in Hoboken since I been here.
2021-01-14,1,For such a "famous" cheese steak place, the service is pretty horrible.I simply asked for the onions on my cheesesteak to be well done, and was rudely told by the cook that the onions are "already premade" And I couldn't grill the onions according to order...All it took was for the cook to throw the onions on the grill directly for 5 to 10 minutes.Pretty pathetic. I'll never go back here again. Waste of $10.
2020-12-22,5,Outstanding cheese steak; a good char flavor on the meat.  Be sure to get it w hot peps.Soup is really good too.Cash only.
2020-12-01,5,We love their cheesesteaks! Real steak is used which is a plus for us,will definitely go back!
2020-11-24,5,This is simply the best Cheesesteak I've ever had, and I've had them all from Philly. I'll rate this a 9.7 on a scale of 1-10
2020-11-17,5,My new fav spot!!! They just literally grill a full steak and put cheese on top. Cooked onion goes very well with the sandwich. Their hot peppers are to die for. They are truely Incredible! Steak is cooked so perfect. Their fries are hot and fresh. 10 dollars per sandwich. I looove everything about this place!
2020-11-13,5,The best around , everyone knows this isn't a secret . If you want to have the best cheesesteak of you're life piccolos is the way to go .
2020-05-24,5,Ummm how have I lived in Hoboken and never eaten here? Yeah I don't understand either. The way to go is a cheesesteak with hot peppers. At first the meat looks like it's going to be too thick for a cheesesteak but it's so tender!! And everything just works from the bread, cheese, meat, onions and the beautiful addition of peppers. Had it without the peppers one time it was good but needed something to balance the richness- peppers do the trick. Everyone is really nice in there - common in if you are like me and never realized what I'm missing out on!! *enjoy*
2019-09-09,3,Cheesesteak is a little misleading, its closer to a steak sandwich. And its freaking amazing!! I lived in Hoboken for years and never seen it opened before I tried it on a random weekday and it was packed - ton of locals and regulars that seem to be having the time of their lives. I had the sandwich with the fries and they were okay, I like it a bit more crisp but they did the job. The food was a 4 for sure. I think my disconnect was there was nothing I saw about cash only. I had used atm which made an 8 dollar meal to 11. Then the waiter said its actually 9. Hmm  very odd.
2019-08-08,4,Basic. Nothing that great, but basic sandwiches. Yes, I know they have Ben around forever but it doesn't make the sandwiches anything that special.
2019-01-22,5,Simply THE BEST! Have been going to Piccolo's for more than 30 years and now living out of state, it's always on my to do list when in NYC. Happy to report it hadn't changed and Patty is still doing Sparky justice. Ty he cheese steaks are custom trimmed, whole ribeye steaks grilled and served with onions, and cheese on THE best Italian rolls. Perfection!The guys working the counter seem to have been there forever, this it's consistency. Homemade soups and daily specials are also served toba loyal following of regulars. Oh how I wish they were in Tampa!
2019-01-03,5,Yummy yummy yummy. That's all! Don't miss a cheese steak, after 11, don't know why you can't have one for breakfast earlier.
2018-08-12,5,I love this place my father use to own the bar around the corner i use to ask for 10 bucks all the time to get there fries and steak or chinken n french fries its funny how im 32 years old my father had passed away and when i walk in this place it brings back so much memories that i tear up because nothing has changed. Its a place where now i take my son n kids Thx Patti for the wonderful memories.
2018-07-18,4,I was visiting the area and wanted a Philadelphia cheesesteak. I was told this place was the best. It was not a made using thin steak but rather a piece of steak on a roll. The reason I rated them so high was because the roll was very good. I would look elsewhere if you are looking for a nice cheesesteak.
2018-06-22,5,Great food and amazing atmosphere. A lot of working class people getting working class portions. Feels like you are in a different town or time when you step in.The cheese steak was an actual piece of tender steak, the cheeseburger had an amazing flame-broiled taste, the pasta fagioli had a rich wonderful taste, and the fried chicken was crispy with obviously homemade breading. Definitely coming back.
2018-01-15,5,A cheesesteak and fries from Piccolo's is a real treat. The place is old-school legit. If you are an admirer of the cheesesteak arts, then you definitely need to give it a try. They also make a good cheeseburger, though they're smaller than they look, so if you're hungry order two.
2017-12-06,5,What can I say, best cheesesteak I ever had. Real rib eye, the best Italian bread from a local bakery, smothered in peppers and onions, and topped off with the classic american cheese. Add the french fries and it is pure heaven. No Cheese whizz, so don't ask. This is a Jersey Cheese Steak.Man, I want to take the drive right now!
2017-09-21,3,I've been meaning to try Piccolo's for awhile now because of the great reviews and it's super close to my apartment. They close at 4:30p.m. so I didn't get the chance to go until yesterday when I needed to get lunch on the go. The space inside is very cute and old-timey. I ordered the regular cheesesteak with onions and hot peppers. Whew, those peppers are pretty spicy...and I'm usually very good with spice. The meat was not the greatest, to be honest, and kinda hard to bite. For $9, it wasn't a bad lunch, but I've definitely had better cheesesteaks elsewhere. TIP: They only do cash and there's an ATM inside.
2017-06-12,4,Ordered cheese steak and was very pleased. Simple sandwich with American cheese, onions and steak on a grilled roll. Very good taste, not overwhelming. Clean, old school type of place, no frills. Would do again. Not the Philly version but if you've never had that version, you'll enjoy this place. Sinatra music awesome.
2017-03-03,3,I used to be the kind of person that said a cheesesteak is a cheesesteak but since coming up north after growing up near Philly and their famous cheesesteaks, I have to rescind that statement.Piccolo's does it okay, a smaller probably healthier option for what you'll get from any typical Philly steak shop, but doesn't really come close to the REAL thing.They toast their bread which is a nice touch. The steak seems to be a frozen to unthawed piece of whole ribeye that they just throw on the grill and serve up. Not chopped up, not seasoned at all, it had no flavor, I had to add salt and pepper to make it better. A little cheese and some fried onions and that's about it.I was hungry and it hit the spot, but definitely wouldn't fufill my fixation when I crave a real juicy, wiz cheesey, huge cheesesteak like that from Jims, Oregon, or any place in Philadelphia. The decor is very historic and Frank Sinatra is blasted throughout the building. Clean, nice seating area. I heard they do breakfast too, might try it at some point.I've had faux sandwiches from other places in the area, not impressed. The NJ/NYC area does a lot of things right, but real cheesesteaks isn't one of em. 3 stars.
2017-01-28,5,Buddy was telling me about these Piccolo cheesesteaks so I had to stop in for one.  Definitely a delicious stop. Nice cut ribeye on a fresh roll, none of that thin chopped up brown/grey meat.  Onions and hot peppers rounded this off for one of the best cheesesteaks I've had in the area.  Will definitely return for another.
2017-01-21,3,Old school cheese steak place. The guy behind the counter is a real jersey guy. It is very refreshing that this place doesnt try to be anything but a cheese steak place.That being said i found the cheese steak greasy. The flavor was good but even the peppers and onions were greasy. Bread wasnt bad.It isnt your classic cheese steak it is more of a steak sandwich. Not a big deal but it isnt like the cheese steaks you normally get. The fries were definitely store bought but you dont come here for them.
2017-01-15,5,This place is a timely classic .. such a simple sandwich with outstanding ingredients. You can tell why this place has been open as long as it has .. if only yelp gave you more stars to hand out cause I would definitely give them 10 stars
2017-01-02,5,Not much to say the best best best cheesesteak. The bread and the cheese make this steak phenomenal. The fries are excellent we might have trouble getting a spot for your car but you have to go to this place it's not your regular cheesesteak it's an actual steak sandwich with cheese
2016-12-30,4,Neighborhood char broiler of burgers and Jersey Cheese Steak(no chop chop)   Homemade soups and proper fries. and Frankie on the juke
2016-12-11,5,If you want a yummy tender tasty meat sandwich, Piccolo's cheese steak sandwich is it! Delicious!
2016-08-21,4,If you're expecting Philly cheesesteak style/quality you're going to be disappointed. However if you're craving a steak sandwich that isn't some frozen sports bar take on it, then you'll be more than satisfied. No frills place, but good quality, price and an authentic experience.
2016-07-16,5,Simply the best rib eye steak hero in the USA  from the best town in the USA.   HOBOKEN.
2016-06-19,2,It's just a piece of thin rib eye over bread, nothing special about it. In my opinion, not worth "the best cheesesteak" they claimed
2016-05-02,5,I have never been a fan of cheesesteaks in my life... Having tried my very first cheesesteak right in Philadelphia, I figured if I didn't like that, I probably would never like any cheesesteaks ever.Took a bite of my boyfriend's cheesesteak (topped with mushrooms and onions) from Piccolo's.....and proceeded to devour the rest of it in a matter of minutes. He wasn't incredibly happy with me after that, but I couldn't care. It was DELICIOUS. They use a thicker slice of beef/steak rather than the thinly sliced pieces (mush) that is normally used for cheesesteaks, and it was juicey and tender and oh-so-tasty.Oof - will be coming back here.Only downside - they have really strange hours (often only open till 4:30pm I think), so plan accordingly!
2016-01-23,4,I tried this place last week because I pass it almost every day.  First of all, I love the old school homey atmosphere.   I got the cheesesteak and it was different than the ones I have had in philly but I liked it.  I would definitely go back, my only complaint would be the hours.  Then again it makes you want it even more.
2015-12-09,5,This is real Hoboken. Not the nonsense you see up and down the avenue. Probably my favorite cheese steak I've ever had ( sorry, Biggies, you're 2nd ), it's an actual piece of steak,  not a thrice processed steak um. The service is solid and the owner is always available to chat. As others have said, the hours can be rough but it adds to what they are.
2015-10-05,4,Okay so I now know why I never see them open. Because their hours are 6am-4pm! I finally got to try this place and ordered a cheese steak. This thing is the real deal ...fresh steaks on delicious bread with caramelized onions and American cheese. Very tasty. Wish you'd be open past 4 but I'll check it out again sometime during lunch.
2015-09-11,4,I give this place 4 stars only because portions aren't that big compared to what you're paying for, they only accept cash, and have terrible hours of operation. Other than that this place is 5 stars hands down. Might have been the best roast beef I've ever had. Cheesesteak is very good too. If you're around when they're actually open def stop by.
2015-09-01,5,Best cheesesteak you'll get in Hoboken, and yes it's a ribeye on Italian bread and not tiny slices of meat on a boring roll. A hoboken classic, and the other offerings on the menu are delicious too!
2015-08-11,5,Piccolo's is a Hoboken institution always filled with locals. The philly cheesesteaks are delicious with fresh bread, thick cuts of steak, and healthy (maybe hardy instead of healthy) portions of cheese and onions. I've been going here for over a decade and the atmosphere hasn't changed however why tinker with a success. You know you are in the right place when you hear Frank Sinatra blaring non-stop. The place can get very busy so it is often easier to do takeout (bring cash). My biggest compliant are the hours (8 AM -4 PM Monday through Saturday and closed on Sunday). Piccolo's has the loyal following that they'd be busy if they served dinner and were open on Sundays as well.
2015-06-22,5,I work right around the corner. I tried this place for the first time a few years back. Food is amazing. The cheese-steak is not a regular cheese-steak. Its an actual piece of steak which is very good. The hot peppers on the side give it a great kick. The fries are simple but taste really good. I have tried a few of their soups and they are all pretty decent. My favorite is their pasta fagioli soup. I recently starting getting other sandwiches and they are delicious. You pretty much can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The owner is also a very nice guy and takes care of his customers. This is one place I will definitely continue going to.
2015-06-18,5,This place is awesome and quite the experience. They don't have many things on the menu, but you have the get steak, onions and cheese on a roll. They make it right in front of you on the grill. It's a nice treat. Looks like a bunch of mobsters run the place. Really cool vibe. Nice lunch spot.
2015-06-13,4,Excellent cheesesteak and fish and chips (Friday's only). Interesting ambiance - almost like an old boys club - but great food!
2015-06-05,5,Great cheese steak and fries. I've been coming here myself since I'm a child and love the food and the great ambiance. True Hoboken/ north jersey spot. Worth going to if you're in the area.
2015-05-21,2,Underwhelmed is the only way to explain this place. A lot of hype for being a Hoboken landmark. Best cheesesteak? Confused how it warranted that title. I asked for peppers on it and it had none. I got a chewy piece of beef with a lot of fat on it. Not into it.
2015-05-12,4,The place has character -- so many pictures against the walls of I assume people who have eaten there -- (okay, I mean, Pope John Paul II's pic was there too, so I don't know)It's Deli-like, long counter with tall chairs -- hardly changed since the 70's I think. They do have really good cheese steak sandwiches. It's a little pricey for a cheese steak, $9, but you know they have Sinatra playing in the background non-stop. If you ever stop by at lunchtime, you'll see the people that comprise your neighborhood -- the handy man, the cops and firemen, and even the priest from the nearby parish.It's a must for anyone who's just moved to Hoboken.
2015-03-04,5,This is not your normal cheese steak. You do not get thin slices of sauteed beef and onions/peppers with cheese.  The cheese steak here is a grilled ribeye with cheese and onions/peppers.  It is phenomenal!  So good that I eat it up before taking pictures of it (this is rare).  I tried other items before and the food is decent.  I highly recommend trying cheese steak and fries! Note: Bring cash!
2015-02-21,5,I have had this argument before, and the concensus is, this isn't a "cheesesteak".  Well, if you can get past the technicality of it being a steak sandwich with cheese, and who couldn't.... You will be left with a sandwich that puts to shame most cheesesteaks, or steak sandwiches, or whatever category you think this falls in.  Two things make this simple sandwich incredible: fresh bread, grilled with a slight char...and fresh cut, rib eye steak.  Hands down the best I have had....love the old school atmosphere too.  Who doesn't love Sinatra?!
2015-02-07,5,classic atmosphere , soundtracked by sinatra , the cheessteak different than your used to but simply amazing
2014-12-23,4,First off I'm not big into cheese steaks but this one is amazing! They use a good cut of meat, great bread, good onions (you have to ask for onions). They have hot peppers that you can put on yourself. The sandwich is small, don't be fooled by seeing the long rolls on the counter, and expensive, but totally worth it. Also note its cash only, really old school place.
2014-11-01,3,Pretty good cheese steak not the thin sliced steaks. Onions on steak is caramelized to perfection. Fries dry and bland
2014-10-16,5,I work in Manhattan and we order from there. The delivery guy takes the  ferry over and I meet him by ferry for my food. The cheesesteaks are great. It's real rib eye and not steak-ums. The meatballs are off the charts as well as the roast beef hero with gravy and sautéed onions. I also like the side of hot cherry peppers on the side. I highly recommend Piccolos.
2014-09-05,5,Worth the trip and pain in the neck parking, , old school place walk in and sinatra playing.what can I say the steak with cheese was awsome. Cooked in a fire grill the bread is equally good..and the fries were cooked exactly how I like them golden and crunchy...go try it u wont regret it.
2014-08-08,4,Overall really liked this place.  Location very close to our apt, and overall took only 10-15 minutes from order to pickup.  The cheesesteak is like others have mentioned - not a true Philly-style cheesesteak but very tasty.  The cut is a little thicker than what I would prefer though.  The fries were more standard fare but also enjoyed them as well.  Overall will be coming back again, but I also plan on trying some of the other places that have popped up in the area for variety.
2014-07-17,4,This place is as old school as it gets.  The cheesesteak is a great fried rib eye on delicious chewy Italian bread.  Pickled peppers on the table add some real heat.   Daily soup I had was good too.  Only bad thing is how long it took me to try them.
2014-06-28,5,Do not make the mistake of comparing this gem to a philly style steak sandwich. The steak sandwich served here is in a league of its own. The sndwich consists of real deal grilled steak with or without onions encased in a authentic piece of Italian bread. dont forget to add the vinegar hot peppers.  I must also say the soup of the day is amazing no matter what day it is.
2014-06-25,5,I live in Philly. That said, there is absolutely no comparison between a "Philly" cheesesteak and Piccolo's cheesesteak.In Philadelphia, the cook takes a "Steak-umm"-shaped very thin slice of meat and chops it into little pieces while it's defrosting on the grill. At Piccolo's, as I'm sure you've read again & again, a nice, whole ribeye is used. Steaks from either locale can satisfy, but for my money, Hoboken has it hands down over Philly!I also like the fact that, after 7 years of visiting Piccolo's at least once a month, I have never gotten even a second look from passing police at my double-parked car!My favorite cheesesteak!
2014-06-06,5,First off I'd like to start by saying to compare a Hoboken cheesesteak to a philly is wrong. In Philly, they roast the entire loaf of meat then slice it thinly into what you all are used to seeing. At Piccolos, they actualy slice the Rib Eye steak raw and cook it on a char grill. The cooking practices differ by a mile.I just had my first cheesesteak from Piccolos In about 10 years and they taste exactly as I remembered when I first had them. The steak was very tender, the onions were cooked to perfection, the cheese was oozing and that old world italian bread combine to make this a great sandwich. This is the makings (in my opinion) of a great Hoboken cheesesteak! I will visit Piccolos again soon. I love that in a small town like Hoboken, Hidden gems like Piccolos are available. I like to keep them secret because then I wouldn't be able to get another ever again.
2014-04-25,3,Maybe its the Philadelphia in me, but this place just isnt very good. 1 big slab of meat that doesnt take up the entire roll. But like I said, it might be the philly in me. Just wasn't a fan, but the place has a ton of old school pics and has that old Italian feel. I enjoyed the experience.
2014-03-12,3,The steak was absolutely delicious! The beef was seasoned and grilled perfectly, the crusty hoagie roll was perfect. Delicious onions, loved the cherry peppers on the table. I have no complaints about the sandwich itself. It was just perfect.My criticisms are around some hygiene issues. Number one --the short Latino chef handled money operated a cash register without gloves, them picked up a piece of beef and placed it on the grill --dirty hands on good beef-- a no-no.Number two --the condiments on the table -- the mustard container was dirty.  The ketchup bottle too.   Number three-  the place was a throwback to the old days for sure and the place reeked of cigars and cigarettes of. Bygone era.But just to reiterate, about the cheesesteak sandwich it's self-it was outstanding.
2014-02-17,3,This is at best 3 star place.  Portion is small and it tastes just average.  Meat was kind of tough.
2014-02-17,4,Have you ever just had a craving? Today I was in the area & just felt like a steak sandwich.Using my yelp app I saw that this place was close,open & bookmarked.Ok let's give it a shot.It's definitely old school.Opened in 1955,it has the brown paneling on the walls with tons of black & white photos from yesteryear.Don't be confused because technically it's a rib-eye sandwich not a cheesesteak.But it was very good.It was served with Carmelized onions and cheese on a hoagie roll.I do understand that Hoboken is not known for these kind of places.But if I can nitpick just a little,$8.50 for a sandwich this size was a tad pricey.But I guess that since these places are kind of limited around town, they can charge a few dollars more.Let's keep in mind that this place is a landmark.It's not a cheesesteak shop in Philadelphia,where they are located every other block.(No disrespect to our neighbors).Let's just enjoy these places while they still are around.
2014-02-02,4,I live near here and often eat here for lunch when I work from home.  The food is usually pretty good, although I haven't been that impressed with the cheese steak.  However, they have the best fish and chips in Hoboken (Friday lunch special), good ravioli and some other specials, and the best french fries in Hoboken.
2014-01-28,5,Place is the best ! True Oldschool Hoboken at its best....Went in and ordered a cheese Steak with onions , fries....The bread they hues is Italian , and the steak they use is real...not that other crap you get from those wanna be philly places ..fast service and a mix of yuppie and blue collar crowd ,and some old school Italian cugino in the back if you know what mean ( kidding) ...anyway would highly recommend this place ...Chesse Steaks are unreal the best....
2013-11-15,2,Sooooo yeaaaaaaa.... I do NOT see what the hype is about. Lets start with the fact that when you say cheesesteak, imma need you to be referencing THINLY sliced beef that is sauteed then either covered or mixed with cheese and placed into a delicious roll. That is not what I got here (yea I knew this going in but it irks me).What I did get was a slice of meat (I think they say its rib-eye [I don't care]) with some cheese and onions laid on top and the whole thing placed on a split roll and folded in half. Both the meat and the bread were kinda tough. This made it increasingly difficult to eat 1-handed while scrolling through my Facebook timeline. The flavor was ok, I guess. But seriously nothing special.The atmosphere...I felt soooooo uncomfortable walking into this place. I very literally almost walked right back out. It could be really endearingly old school...but its not. Its just kinda creepy. I didn't want to make direct eye contact with the 2 other gentlemen who were sitting at the counter, so I'm not 100% sure but they seemed pretty creepy too. Customer service was nonexistent, the 2 cooks were not very chatty at all. They just looked at me when I came in. I wanted to sit at a table away from the creepy patrons but I was pretty sure I'd never even get the chance to order if I did. So I sat at the counter. Food was pretty fast at least. Then again, they just laid a piece of meat on the grill, flipped at some point, then put it on some bread.Anyway, I probably won't be back. Actually, I definitely won't be back. Too far and too creepy. #sorrynotsorry
2013-09-01,1,Such a huge disappointment...First lets talk about how this place is NEVER OPEN. I have heard about this place a lot after living in Hoboken for about 2 years now and how it is the "best cheesesteak in town". Of course, I was set on going after hearing that... But this place operates like The DMV, Open 9-5 and most likely they are closing up shop at 4:30. Now lets tall about the smell... I can only Describe the smell as rotting fish that punches you in the face as soon as you walk in the door. This is strange as they are known for cheesesteaks...The cheesesteak itself is small and just average at best. No options for condiments, lettuce or tomato. Meat was over cooked, thick and flavorless.Finally, I'll say the crowd That was in there reminds me of the crowd you would find on a Tuesday morning inside flash dancers. Weird and creepy, for those of you people who haven't been to a strip club, and it made me feel uncomfortable the entire duration of my stay.  If the Management from piccolos ever reads this, please do yourself a favor and call Gordon Ramsay ASAP.  You need the help!
2013-06-28,4,Great cheese-steak sandwich.  I've not had one much better than this one- they are quite good at their craft here.  The bread, meat and cheese are all equally good.In addition, there are other non-beef choices including chicken and some pasta dishes.
2013-06-09,5,I've lived in Hoboken for more than ten years and couldn't believe I had not discovered this place until it was mentioned in the Times article about Hudson county restaurants. Let it be known that the cheesesteak is as good as they say it is. Simple and straightforward: one terrific, perfectly cooked piece of steak resting nicely on a grilled roll with a slice of cheese. I added onions and took my sister's tip to add hot pepper and ketchup. Fold it up and enjoy; the  flavors meld together gloriously and bonus points go to it being not at all messy. I couldn't stop raving about it during and after eating it. It's not huge but I found the portion size appropriately satisfying.
2013-06-08,5,Super delicious "cheesesteak".  The rib eye is tender and tasty and it's perfectly balanced with the bread, cheese, sautéed onions, hot peppers and a dash of ketchup.  If only it were a little bit bigger...but yum, I'm definitely going back.
2013-04-15,3,Came here for a steak sandwich after driving by it at least 3x a month.  It is a Hoboken institution.  Pros: Solid piece of steak on that cheesesteak.  Delicious cheese.  Nice scoop of onions on top.  Real bread.  Fast service.Cons: The sandwich is insanely small.  Lived in Philly for 5 years and those are like 2x the size for less.  Ridiculously expensive for what you get.  $10.50 for a sandwich and a drink.I may or may not come back.  I guess I would have to be in the mood.
2012-12-26,5,This place was attached to my building when I lived in Hoboken and is one of the things I miss most about the city.Steak sandwich is unreal.  I've tried a few other things there and they don't compare to that sandwich.  This place makes you feel like you're in an episode of Sopranos.
2012-12-06,3,Haven't been to Piccolos in a while because I realize they are a bit pricey and the portions are not enough. The service is good but not worth paying $8 for a steak sandwich and the portions are small.
2012-11-20,5,Excellent steak sandwich, a nice cut of beef, fabulous bread, not greasy made to order. The place is an old fashioned lunch counter with great character. Good Coffee too! Not gourmet- fresh, simple and good.
2012-10-13,4,I can keep this review nice and simple. Order the cheesesteak sandwich with fried onions and a side of fries. It's a slice of ribeye and not your generic steak-umm cheesesteak. The meat is brought in fresh a couple times a week and the bread daily from a local bakery. I've never tried anything else here and haven't really ever felt the need to. The guys that work here are good guys, and it's also kind of fun to see the photos of the owner (Patty Piccolo) with customers over the years.
2012-09-03,3,Piccolos was good but very pricey.  Finally found it open.  They're closed on Sundays which seems to be the only time I crave a steak sandwich.The guys in the store were nice and the food was good; didn't have to wait long to get it either.  I got the steak sandwich and the fiance got the cheesesteak.  Both were tasty and would get them again.The only problem is the price.  It was just under $20 for two small sandwiches.  Again, both the sandwiches were good, but I felt like I needed another, and I'm not usually one to complain about portions.I'd recommend going to Luca Brasi's just a couple blocks down on 1st.  Longer wait but similar quality and much larger portions.Piccolos, please lower your prices and I'll be back all the time!
2012-06-17,5,As others have mentioned, cut to the chase and order the Rib Eye Steak Sandwich. Be sure to ask for it mid-rare so the blood runs all over the cheese and onions and flavors the crusty roll and let the carnage begin. In my opinion this Jersey style steak sandwich is much better than a Philly Cheesesteak which might be the most overrated sandwich genre in the world. I do not know what else is on the menu, and in this case I believe ignorance is bliss. Yes, 5 stars is high for what is basically an Italian American dive, but some places become legendary on the strength of a single item or two on the menu. Reviewing the rest of the items becomes pointless when a place has an iconic dish that it becomes known for. I believe Piccolo's has been around long enough and has been producing the sandwich at a high level for enough time that they can be granted this type of status. Others will probably disagree and review it based upon it's entire body of work and give a more balanced review with pros and cons. I cannot argue with this approach, especially if you think that the signature item is not strong enough to carry the day.My criterion for greatness on a dish is whether it can cause a craving and satiate one  at the same time and Piccolo's Steak Sandwich meets that standard.5 Stars.
2012-04-16,4,It is actually a cool little Boken spot off the beaten path of Washington. I would recommend trying their steak sandwich. I will definitely be back soon.
2012-04-09,4,Finally made a trip here a few days ago, since I had to see what all the fuss was about! We both got a cheesesteak with onions and I was left pleasantly full, my boyfriend was still hungry. The rib eyes were fantastic, and the onions were perfect. Although it's a little pricy, I'd definitely try it again. If you have a big appetite, order a side or two, or else you'll probably leave wanting a little more.
2012-01-12,4,The steak sandwich is great but it's a little pricey considering it didn't leave me completely full. Go with a friend and eat one and a half each.
2011-12-06,5,Great steak, and do not forget the soup.  You cannot miss with either the Pasta Fagioli or Chicken Pastina.  Patty and the staff are great.
2011-11-14,4,Passing through Hoboken, I stumbled upon Piccolo's.  Seeing all the cars double parked for lunch, I had to give it a shot.  Do not confuse this steak sandwich with the philly cheesesteak.  The sandwich they offer at Piccolo's is nothing like a philly steak and that's a good thing.   Cooked on the spot and made to order, it is worth the wait.  The Italian bread had enough bite to sink your teeth into but not to tear up your mouth.  The steak is a rib-eye cut that is grilled to perfection and not overdone.  The seasonings are simple... S&P.  Throw in the onions and cheese and you've got a winner.  After taking one bite, I ordered two more to go.  Table space is limited but you can belly up to the counter.  This is worth the wait.
2011-11-11,4,I had the cheese steak and really enjoyed it, its real steak so its a little different than other cheese steaks I have had in the past but change is good sometimes I guess, haa.  I also like the very "old school" hoboken feel that this place has.
2011-08-29,4,Don't even play here, just order the cheesesteak. It is the best in the city. Share an order of fries and you have a nice lunch.  Get the pastina soup with grated Italian cheese on a crisp, winter day.  Savor your food as you listen to Ol Blue Eyes. If you like Rutt's Hut type deep-fried dogs, that's how they do them here too.  Bring cash and get here before 4pm, they close early.  Only reason not 5 stars is that they are getting fairly pricey, lunch for two will be 30 bucks if you're not careful.
2011-06-12,5,Normally I don't care for "real" steak sandwiches, preferring a philly-style instead.  My co-worker is a born and bred Hobokonite who swears by Piccolo's and know everyone who works there by name.  After reading all the positive reviews I figured I had to give their cheesesteak a shot.  I was so glad that I did!  The steak was tender and juicy, the fried onions and melty cheese were a perfect match with the crusty italian roll.  The hot peppers they gave on the side added just the right kick for those of whose who craved it.  (5 of us had ordered the cheesesteak.)  We ordered delivery, but order early because they get busy!
2011-06-08,5,Love this place! Great food great place and really great value.  Not the healthiest option, so we don't go as much as we'd like.
2011-03-10,5,Frankie on anytime you walk in and cheese steaks that rival Philly.
2010-12-13,4,Steak Sandwich with cheese and onions.  Plus a side of fries.  The moment you step in the door you know going to get a great meal.
2010-07-14,5,This is a must try.Went here expecting a cheese steak.  Its not quite what they serve.  However, I really loved my sandwich.  This should be classified as a steak sandwich with cheese on it.  Its a slice of Ribeye on a long roll with cheese and onions.  It was good and I was considering ordering a second cause that is how much I enjoyed the first one.  But they $8 a piece so I passed.  Really good meal and worth the walk from Washington street where its the same ol crap every day.  Also noticed this place is huge with the locals and Old School Hobokenites.
2010-04-06,2,I was told about this place through somebody who was related to the owner and they said they had the best cheesesteaks.  Now, if anybody heard that, they'd envision Philly style cheesesteaks, right?  If I wanted a steak sandwich that wasn't a Philly Cheesesteak, I'd drive a few blocks and have Arthur slap a slab of their best between a loaf of bread.  So being let down in a major way when I received this dry McRib with onions, you can imagine how disappointed I was.  Maybe down the road I'll try some of their other items, so until then I have to rate it like I see it.
2010-03-03,4,Well the cheesesteaks were ok, not as thrilling as I was expecting based on the other reviews. They were made with real steak and delicious fresh italian bread and I do think they were great. The best part about this place was its character, pictures covering the walls and newspapers covering the floors. The cook chats and hangs out with the customers and really makes you feel welcomed. I would be thrilled to go back if im up to the walk back over that way.
2009-12-24,5,If I had one last meal in my life I would go right to piccolos !!soup and cheese steak w/ onions. perfection!
2009-11-07,5,Piccolo's continues to impress. They only have about 10 different things on the menu, but everything is executed perfectly. If you want to experience the Best of Fast Food - enter please. The Frank ($3) - terrific. Best hot dog around - they deep fry it, and out comes this perfect, crispy frank - mouth-watering goodness. No kraut needed. Just a bit of ketchup, bit of mustard, bit of relish and perhaps a hot pepper or two. I'd order 2, as you will suck down 1 in 20 seconds flat. The Turkey hero w/ gravy ($6) is out of this world. Probably my favorite sandwich in Hoboken (with Park & 6th Brisket/Mozz coming in 2nd place). It's very high quality roast turkey breast on a fresh-baked italian crusty hero, with awesome hot gravy. I also add a few hot peppers. Perhaps an order of fries w/ ketchup for dipping on the side. The Cheesesteak is fantastic - they cook a ribeye on the grill and add some cheese, little peppers, little onions and bam, there you go. Fresh and wonderful. Heart attack on a platter. I haven't tried the Virginia Ham, or the Pastrami or Corned beef yet, but look forward to that. And on Fridays, they have deep fried seafood (shrimp, fish fry) and Fried Chicken - that should be awesome. Be careful - this stuff will clog your arteries - but a once-every-2-week habit of Piccolo's is just what the doctor ordered. I am all in with this place .
2009-05-15,5,best cheesesteaks ever! hands down!! enuff said! the freshhhhest!
2009-02-16,5,Piccolo's cheesesteak sandwiches are hands down the best I've had in the area.  What makes these cheesesteak sandwiches so good is the properly cooked, fresh rib-eye steak and the combination of fresh bread that's just the size.  The bread doesn't drown out the tasty, tender steak.  This is NOT one of those over-cooked, straight from the freezer, cheesesteak sandwiches with stale, thick bread.
2009-01-07,5,If you're too early for lunch, they make a mean breakfast. The rib-eye steak sandwiches are fantastic. You will never want another philly-style fast food cheesesteak once you've tasted one of the hand trimmed proper rib-eye steak sandwiches here.A proper rib-eye steak sandwich from Picollo's makes one realize that the "cheesesteak" sandwiches we've been eating in PA or elsewhere are just fast food for children.
2008-11-06,5,This place is a throw back. Technically it is a luncheonette. And they don't claim to make Philly Cheese Steaks. They Grill a Real Rib eye Steak , add Onions if you want and Cheese of course. It is then placed on a fresh semolina long roll and served. In a word "Great". They have a menu with daily specials and everything is made fresh. This little Luncheonette is a Hoboken Fixture and one of the hidden places that Longtime residents know about and new residents eventually discover.
2008-02-12,4,I hesitate giving this place any sort of good rating because I am afraid that the cheese steak mafia is going to have me whacked.  There are certain foods that many people believe they are "experts" at and, if something is not prepared perfectly in line with "the way it's supposed to be", the food nazis go crazy.   BBQ is one of those foods that gets lovers of souther-style smoked meats emotional.  No one in these parts can ever be satisfied with Italian food because they always know someone who makes a version of something much better.   And cheese steaks are something that the Philly purists defend furiously.  Piccolos cheese steak  will piss the Philly "Pat and Gino's" crowd off tremendously but, I'm sorry to tell them, Piccolos can give Philly a run for its money any day.Everything is worth trying hear (start with their homemade soups, they are always great), but the cheese steak stands out.   Thick, tender, and char-broiled with just enough fried onions (should you choose) and hot peppers (should you be daring enough).   The excellent bread helps round it out.Most certainly the type of place that causes a craving...
2006-09-10,5,anything in this place is a must have to try...it's been around forever and has people from out of state visiting often, that's gotta say something!
