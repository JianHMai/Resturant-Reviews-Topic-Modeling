2021-10-27,1,I used to love this place but they must have changed their pastrami because the last couple times I've gotten it, the texture was completely different. Tasted like was board head pastrami from a grocery store deli. I was so upset, their sandwiches use to be amazing! They also don't give you cole slaw with your sandwiches anymore
2021-08-21,1,Ordered the hot pastrami sandwich. It was rubbery, unappetizing, greyish-red meat. Zero flavor. Definitely not recommended
2021-06-27,3,I would like to be able to re-review this place and give them the four or five stars they deserve based on past offerings, but after today's sandwich I cannot. In the past I was given great sandwiches from this place but today I received what looks like Boars Head pastrami on a slicer.  Anybody who has grown up around kosher deli's will tell you that a pastrami is supposed to be slightly greasy and have plenty of burnt corners full of seasoning and flavor. My sandwich was full of long stringy continuous pieces gummy meat, not the small slivers of goodness that you should be accustomed to. To explain what I mean, I attached a photo of their old sandwich and what I received today.  No comparison..
2021-06-01,4,Just a quick update. I ordered the foot long Hebrew National with a side of bake beans for takeout.  I came home and opened the container to be sadly disappointed with two small hotdogs instead.  Another Yelp customer wrote last year that this happened to them, too (yelp.com/biz/pastrami-ho...).  Apparently, this not an aberration. Don't order the foot long hot dog if you expect to get one.
2021-05-26,2,I ordered pickup from here about a month ago. The customer service was very poor.  It wasn't even busy and I waited for a couple of minutes for someone to even address me.  There were probably 3 people behind the counter.  Finally I spoke up. My order was sitting basically right there. I wanted to add a drink and for some reason the one I was speaking to couldn't ring me up for the drink. Pretty absurd that they all just can't simply ring up a customer. I had to wait for someone else and that took forever so I just left and didn't buy the drink. On top of that the food was subpar. The barley soup barely had any barley.  The potato pancakes were decent.  Not sure id give this place another shot though.
2021-04-17,2,I'm surprised how high the ratings are on this place. We got two pounds of hot pastrami. Sides were : steak fries, potato latkas, Mac and cheese, potato salad.The pastrami is not good. Pastrami is supposed to be tender. Melt in your mouth, cut with a spoon tender. This is not that. The texture is gummy, stringy, and chewy. The flavor is ok. Overall, the texture left a lot to be desired, especially given how much you are paying. You may get better quality pastrami in just your local deli. This place has pastrami in their name, they should do better.The sides were also bad. The potato latkas actually had some good flavor, crispy, ok. They give it to you with sour cream and apple sauce, this was actually as expected. The Mac and cheese and French fries did not have hardly any seasoning on them. The potato salad was sweet and was made with probably the cheapest Mayo they could find based on the taste. If the pastrami was excellent then we would have been ok with the bad sides, but how it was this was just the cherry on top on a horrible experience.Will not give this place another try. If you think you are getting Katz level pastrami, then just don't bother.On a side note, the delivery was actually pretty fast. Based on the reviews we were expecting slow service and great food, instead we got the opposite.
2021-04-15,3,The place is ok, a bit below average, but can be so much better.  Train the staff on how to stack meat on a sandwich.  Get better pickles and cole slaw.  Dont put knishes in a metal sealed container, just wrap them for delivery. Thats a start in the right direction.  Overall, I enjoy the food and it checks my deli fix.
2021-04-14,1,Probably the worst takeout I have ever had in my life. Ordered the matzo ball soup, potato croquettes, and split pea soup. The matzo ball soup was swimming in a pool of salt and oil. I had one taste and almost vomited. My husband who eats everything found it completely inedible. The split pea soup we were told was vegetarian. First thing we see is ham floating in it. The potato croquettes which essentially is fried potato was old and flavorless. How you can mess up fried potato is beyond me but it was nasty. We threw all the food away and ended up eating cereal. Waste of $$$
2021-03-25,5,Wow, fastest delivery ever ... excellent Reuben and sloppy joe! Got the "smaller" size and it was perfect. Thanks!
2021-02-27,4,Had a junior hot Pastrami on rye:Pastrami - flavorful, tender, not too fattyBread - soft, chewy, freshPickle - crunchy & sourPortion - could have had some more meat but it wasn't skimpyOverall: Yum! Definitely a repeat.
2021-02-20,3,This spot is decent. The pastrami sandwich was good but the breakfast sandwich was horrible. Onion rings were straight from the freezer but surprisingly they tasted ok. Staff is a little unprofessional.
2021-02-18,5,To food is basic, pretty great and The staff members there are kind. They are extremely personable and awesome to joke around with. Everything was fairly priced as well The pastrami sandwich was soo fresh and tasty. It comes with a pickle and Cole slaw. Usually I hate Cole slaw with a passion but I really like theirs. The grilled cheese was super basic, which made it delicious. You can probably add extras like bacon but I chose not too. Both sandwiches had a good ratio of bread to their respective insides. I will return.
2020-12-30,4,Went twice in a week- very good pastrami sandwiches!  We got the Reuben and the large pastrami sandwich- both were so tasty.  The beans were good too.  The knish was solid - but pastrami was the obvious star!
2020-12-24,4,This is one of those places wish Yelp did two ratings one for food/experience and one for value for money. The sandwiches I got here both that brisket and the turkey club were good.  They mostly come in two sizes 4oz And 7oz.   Mostly meat as this is not a sub shop where also getting lettuce tomato onion cucumber pickles banana peppers etc to make a much bigger sandwich.  I think you can add those for like a dollar per.  The brisket was good though turkey was a bit bland only added by the bacon which is hard to screw up. I got 7 oz and ratio might have been better on 4oz.   Like side pickle and mini cole slaw.  Can be a bit slow as been only one in there and can take awhile to get sandwich.  Will give them slack with covid as sure keeping staff down.
2020-12-12,1,Not reliable for delivery and poor customer service. I ordered (for delivery) on Door Dash 4 days in advance for a holiday dinner. I called the restaurant directly the morning of to confirm the order - and was assured everything was set. Around the time I was supposed to get my delivery, I even got a notification that my order was being processed. 30 minutes after when my food was supposed to be delivered I got a notification from Door Dash that my order was cancelled because the driver couldn't get the food from the restaurant. I called the restaurant (multiple times) and no one answered. We called Door Dash since the restaurant wasn't answering, and they said it was the restaurant that cancelled the order. I called the restaurant the next day to see what the issue was and give them a chance to make things right. Surprisingly they answered; however, whoever answered the phone just said he wasn't there last night and didn't know. He took my number, but no one ever called me. I can't tell you if the food is good because I never got it, but the service was horrible. I will never order from here again.
2020-11-08,3,I've been trying to love this place since they first opened (and went back and forth on whether or not to even write a non glowing review of any place right now, but thought I need to at least give people a heads up) - I actually really do like the sandwiches too, which is why I'm still giving them 3 stars. My problem is just that, without any exaggeration, I don't think I've ever actually gotten the sandwich that I ordered.When they first opened I chalked it up to them needing to figure out their routine. It kept happening and sometimes I'd think maybe delivery isn't their thing but it has happened when I order in person too.  I like most foods so if I order delivery I probably won't even complain, though I have gotten my sandwich switched once on delivery, and also when I've gone in and checked outside the store. It's not even a matter of them forgetting an ingredient or just adding mayo when you don't want it or something like that. Today I got a large sloppy sandwich instead of the small corned beef Reuben I ordered - I feel bad for the person who got mine instead!So if you want to hit the equivalent of the "I feel lucky" button of sandwiches (and it does seem to be only their sandwiches that they mess up) then this is your place. Given you don't have any food dislikes you'll get a solid sandwich, it just probably won't be what you ordered.
2020-11-05,5,I was pleasantly surprised by their version of the Philly cheese steak (the cyclone). I ordered from them because I had a craving for a hot dog and their hotdog is good when the footling is available (unfortunately this time they gave me 2 junk small hot dogs). The reason I gave it a 5 is that on a whim I ordered the cyclone as a snack for friends coming over to eat. Everyone was surprised how good it was. Bread was high quality and the sandwich had good flavor. While it might not be a "true" Philly cheese steak I recommend.
2020-10-12,4,Made a last minute decision to grab lunch here as we were walking by and made the right choice! Had never heard of this so was a little apprehensive but they did not disappoint. Got the small pastrami sandwich on rye (4oz) and it was great! Got the Cole slaw and Russian dressing with it, and it even came with a small container of extra slaw on the side and a pickle. Pastrami was warm and fresh, sliced perfectly thin and was very lean, and the rye bread was super fresh. Happy and would return!
2020-10-05,2,Living a few doors away, I was very excited to see a new establishment starting here last year. And boy do I love a good sandwich!We came during the soft opening (many months ago). No line, but waited a solid 20 mins for our food to go.Soulless. The bread fell apart, pastrami was average at best and the slaw was all mayo and shredded veggies. Maybe try some acids and celery seed for flavor next time. This place has other locations? Can't see it being possible as this seems like a rookie trial run.Why am I writing this review almost a year later. Because I have athesma. Because of covid. Because I'm in the food business and I'm a decent human being. The outdoor *eating area* has been permanently turned into an employee smoking pit during all business hours. It's the same 3 filthy employees. Yes they say hello when you walk by and may be nice. But the fact that I walk by the store at least 4 times a day and have to walk through the smoke pit with getting in my mask and all over clothes just disgusts me. I can't wait until their lease is over and they go back to their other filthy locations.2 stars for the whoever stocks the beverages and Junior's cheesecakes. Good job. Very pleasing to look at.
2020-10-03,3,Pastrami House is a relatively-new lunch spot in Hoboken. It's all takeout, and the interior features a large display-case deli counter and a 'grab & go' fridge in the front.  Given its namesake, I ordered a large pastrami sandwich on rye which comes with a pickle slice and single-serving of cole slaw. I found the pastrami quality to be good, perhaps better than a supermarket slice, but not at the level of the premium delis of NYC (but in fairness, not the high price of NYC either). Likewise, the pickle/cole slaw were good.  Large (extra slices of meat) sandwiches are around $12.   My feeling is that Pastrami House is a solid 3-star takeout option, and perhaps a strong contender for party and game-day platters.
2020-08-31,1,Was hoping this would work out but the health salad had to be at least three or four weeks old the potato salad was disgusting the knish was not crispy but moist and soggy take the ride to Manhattan go to Katz's or go to Queens For Bens this is garbage.
2020-08-25,5,Had a lunch meeting there today..sat outside..all i can say is..The BEST pastrami reuben ever...ots a must go when in Hoboken...BATTS loves this place !!!
2020-08-18,3,I've had great sandwiches here, and terrible ones, it all depends on who you get making your sandwich. I love their Reuben sandwich when it is made right, which involves cutting thin slices of the meat and layering them on the sandwich. Unfortunately, the last time I ordered a Reuben it came with big chunks of meat that had been hacked off rather than the thin slices shown in the  photo on the web site. The sandwich was terrible! So if you order a Reuben of hot pastrami sandwich, be sure the specify that the meat be cut in thin slices and layered into the sandwich, not big chunks of the meat.So overall I like Pastrami House a lot, but they need to more carefully train their help so the sandwiches are consistently good.
2020-08-17,4,Glad that Hoboken has a Jewish Deli. I've only been here once. To me, it wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worst so that's why I'm giving it 4/5. I had a corned beef rueban & I felt that the corned beef was a bit too dry for my liking. But, my friends and family love this place, so it really depends!
2020-08-01,2,The first time I was at the Pastrami House was right after it opened, and I thought it was good (not great). However, after today's experience, I don't think I'll ever return. It was literally the worst pastrami sandwich I (and my guests) have ever had. My parents were in town and I decided to take out lunch for the family (four pastrami sandwiches and knishes), since they are pastrami lovers. The sandwiches were literally inedible and the experience was not only embarrassing, but a huge waste of money. I NEVER waste food, but we literally threw at least $30 worth of sandwiches in the garbage. First, the sandwiches had about half the amount of pastrami we expected for the price. Second, the pastrami was rubber and literally could not be chewed. I'm giving this review two stars only because it's during COVID, and I'm giving the benefit of the doubt that this may have had something to do with it. Nonetheless, I will not be back to find out.
2020-07-21,5,I've been craving a good deli sandwich since the WFH environment started, and I would 100% order from this place again. The corned beef reuben was amazing, and the chicken matzo ball soup was a perfect pairing for it. Definitely check this place out.
2020-06-22,4,I went to the Pastrami House in Hoboken for the first time Sunday. It was a bit pricey, but you expect that for a true deli sandwich and corn beef.  The price was certainly worth it for the quality you get. I was however very very disappointed with the potatoe salad.  The potato was hard (undercooked) and the sauce tasted acidic,  bad. The size seemed as though it was a small.I would go back but stay away from the sides
2020-05-27,5,Pastrami House is a welcome addition to the Hoboken food scene--for once, not another Italian place! I've been here a few times to get the pastrami sandwich and the hot dogs. Plus, they offer a ton of other options like side salads, PICKLES, soup and cheesecakes. Make sure to support this local joint!
2020-05-27,3,3.5*sA few months ago, my boyfriend, who loves Matzo Ball Soup was sick, so I went to Pastrami House to buy him a quart.  Sadly, he was not comforted by the bland and watery broth or the mediocre balls.  I was bummed that my attempt at soothing his ailment fell flat.  However, we recently had an abundance of bread that we needed to utilize, so I suggested that we give the deli another chance and pick up some meat.  The Hot Pastrami was lean, thinly sliced, and juicy.  The Roast Turkey Breast was slightly dry, but flavorful.  We also grabbed a quart of Half-Sour Pickles, which were crisp but could have used more pickling, as they tasted more like cucumbers.  While this was an improvement from our first experience there, it was still not as enjoyable as say, Katz's, but few delis are!Overall, Pastrami House was a welcome addition to the Hoboken food scene, but I would recommend sticking with their namesake meat, as it was the best thing we tried there.
2020-05-26,5,The pastrami house opened in front of my apartment and i gave it a try! They have a lot of good stuff: pastrami, brisket, corned beef, you can even go for the lean options. We always order the pastrami, latkas, and matzo soup. Awesome place and very friendly staff. I like this place and order at least once a week! I recommend, pay them a visit and check it out for yourselves.
2020-05-12,4,Needed some variety in my pandemic dining choices and this place was on the American Airlines dining program. I was able to order a delicious dinner and also preserve my American airlines flight miles. I got the pastrami Reuben, which was good but not prepared the way I'm used to. The pastrami was extremely tender and put on two pieces of rye bread with sauerkraut and French dressing. I'm used to a grilled Reuben sandwich but this was also good. I also ordered the pastrami eggroll, half portion, And the brisket muffins, which were different and tasty.  Be sure to ask for the gravy on the side if you were doing takeout. I do not live in Hoboken so the parking was a pain.  I wish the restaurant would do true curbside takeout.
2020-04-22,5,Delivery #2...Ordered lunch this time from here and it was super quick. Find that it's easier especially during the week than on weekends for dinner. Anyways the Mrs is working from home these days and I happened to be off.She had a junior club sandwich for $9.95 with a side order of sweet potato latkas and apple sauce. I went for a large Reuben sandwich ( lean is $2.00 extra) on whole wheat bread. My side was a pastrami knish. Everything was still warm when it arrived. Pastrami House hasn't been around all that long. If I had to guess less than a year. Everything was very good. And yes, we'll have leftovers again. So glad to try this place out for the first time. A nice alternative for lunch, plus they deliver to the Jersey City Heights area.
2020-04-21,5,Ordered delivery from here today for the corned beef Reuben large 7oz, hot pastrami large 7oz both sandwiches on rye, philly cheese egg roll, and the pastrami balls.Delivery arrived quickly, almost on time lol. Everything was packed neatly and order arrived hot. The pastrami balls are delicious! A mix of meat, rice, and mozzarella in the center in a fried ball. Outer shell was crunchy! Reminded us of the suppli we had in Italy. Yum! $5.95 totally fair. We would get them again.The philly cheese egg roll was actually DELICIOUS!! We were quite surprised! I ordered it just to try and they sent two. Due to size difference maybe? But wow soooo good! You guys have to try these!! The meat was juicy, peppers/onion fresh and flavorful, and little bit of cheese. Crunchy outer shell. So amazing!! $4.95 for a heavenly flavor and crunch. Yes!! Will definitely be ordering these again!!The pastrami sandwich was delicious too! Pastrami was nice and tender. Not much cheese. Rye bread is perfect. Great flavor and 7oz is a great portion for us to share. $11.95 fair price. The coleslaw is delicious too! Creamy and crunchy.The corned beef Reuben sandwich was good too. We both have had better reubens but it was still okay. We wouldn't order it again though and I would recommend the pastrami sandwich over this one. Needed more Russian dressing. The corned beef is also difficult to bite through. We were pulling meat out from the sandwich every bite. Also $11.95. Fair price for the amount of meat they give.We're very happy we tried this place!!!
2020-04-02,2,Picked up some knishes, soup and croquettes. I thought the total of $37 was ridiculously high for what I got. After reviewing the receipt on the walk home I saw that I was overcharged for the stuffed pastrami knish.  Price rung up as $9.95 for 2 and that is what I was charged for 1 knish. Matzo ball soup was tepid not hot and the matzoh ball was extremely salty. I bought another knish to have another time and when I took it out of the foil container, the plastic wrap covering the knish was soaking wet as if it had been standing in water or condensation.
2020-03-29,5,Great initial start! Sandwiches were lean and flavorful, ordered a Sloppy Joe "triple decker" it was moist and flavorful and lean corned beef Reuben and Pastrami sandwich -- both were great! Great Linzer torte (it hails from Linz, Austria, hence Linzer torte, not Linser torte!) and very creamy rice pudding. Sweet potato Latkes hit the spot and came with sour cream and apple sauce! Only negatives, please allow sufficient time to permit Swiss cheese to melt on Reuben, not just soften, and when one asks for extra mustard on the sandwich or to provide it on the side -- do so! It would be sad to hobble your patronage by ignoring such mundane requests! Looking forward to our next order!
2020-03-17,2,Ordered food online (through seamless) for a scheduled pick up. Got a confirmation & arrived at my scheduled pickup time. I waited over an hour (!!) and got a different quoted wait time every time I asked the girl at the front. After an hour, I cancelled my order and left with no food (!!). If they can figure out their logistics issues, they'll be good. But even when I've ordered in person I've always waited 25+ minutes for my food. Really disappointing.
2020-03-14,5,Really great sandwiches, I ordered ahead and got  3 Ruebens when I called they said the order would be ready in 10 minutes. My sandwich came with a small side of coleslaw and a pickle. The rye bread was toasted perfectly and the pastrami was not super fatty. Overall this was a great place to get a quick lunch!
2020-03-12,3,I grew up with Harolds and Katz's, so my standards were very high. I ordered a pastrami Reuben sandwich and side of pickles. It wasn't my favorite and I don't think I'd order this ever again. Harolds in Edison is still #1 by a long shot. The meat felt weird in my mouth ...I don't know how to explain it, but the quality isn't there. Had an interesting texture. If you're really in the mood for Jewish deli food, then go for it. Otherwise, I'd steer clear. Sorry! I really wanted you guys to win!
2020-03-04,5,The pastrami rueben sandwich was perfect. Glad to see another great addition to Hoboken's Washington st! We will be coming back soon!
2020-02-17,5,I love pastrami sandwiches and latkes but for some reason they're ridiculously expensive in New York. This place is amazing. A huge pastrami sandwich for less than $10, an order of big thick latkes for $7... yes please! Definitely will be revisiting this for lunch, multiple times. New favorite.
2020-02-16,1,Pastrami is good but the worst customer service. Ordered delivery twice in the last month and both times I requested extra mustards and russian dressing. Both times they left it out completely. This time I called and spoke to the mgr. After explaining that I wrote it down twice in the comment section too make sure I would get the condiments delivered and once again not included in my delivery, he hung up on me. Will never order from this place again and hope the mgr doesn't take us Hoboken residents for granted. The pastrami isn't that good my man that you can disrespect a customer. Will never be a customer again
2020-02-12,2,Came here last week to pick up a chicken salad sandwich with tomato and pickle chips.  Sandwich which was excellent. Chicken salad was delicious white chicken shredded  Chicken and  Great dressing. Came back today ordered the exact same thing. My roll was not  Toasted as I had asked for a toasted roll. There was hardly any chicken salad inside the sandwich and they charged extra for the tomato and 2 or 3 pickle chips that they put inside the sandwich. If the sandwich was good  I would not mind paying $11 which is what they charge me for the chicken salad sandwich. But same exact sandwich was ordered today that I ordered last week and this one was totally crapy. I called in and I let the guy know who answered the Phone thatI had a bought a great Sandwich last week and that I ordered the same exact sandwich today and it was horrible and his response to me was, well maybe the guy got in trouble last week for giving You a good sandwich. Are you kidding me? Then he told me well you could come back and bring it back and will try to make you a better one but I'm sure the guy got in trouble last week for giving you too much chicken salad on your sandwich. Well guess what, I won't be coming back. To have such a great great chicken salad sandwich last week and to make such a crapy one today same exact sangwich but totally different to me it says that the manager who was there today which is February  11th  2020 at around 7:30 p.m.  Is telling the workers to make less then good sandwiches. A shame because I had really really enjoyed my chicken salad sandwich last week.
2020-02-09,5,Pastrami House has authentic Jewish pastrami to offer.  This is not that Boarshead drek that is mass-produced.  Each pastrami is made by hand through a complex distillation process, steamed, and carved.  This is a true delicacy, the cream of Jewish culinary invention.  It is not kosher, it is "kosher style," so you can have Swiss cheese with your sandwich, if you so desire.  They also offer such traditional favorites as knishes, latkes, Dr. Brown's, kosher hotdogs, and matzoball soup.   The pickles were brined in vinegar.  The traditional Jewish way is with dill water, some peppercorns, and garlic, but no vinegar.  The menu also features some fusion experiments like pastrami eggrolls and so forth.  I love the concept of focusing on one thing and mastering it.  If you are going to focus on one thing, it may as well be pastrami.  The place is take-out only, so there is no seating.  Deli fans come for the old school atmosphere, so it is lacking in this department.  If you want a rare, spiced meat with the taste of old New York, than Pastrami House is your only option in Hoboken.  This is true New York Jewish pastrami: double-cured, steamed, and carved.  Let's put it this way.  In a blind taste test, I would put this joint up against Katz's, 2nd Avenue, or any of the famous, old school New York Jewish delis.
2020-02-07,5,One of the best pastrami reubens in town.  They live up to the name! If you call yourself the pastrami house you better deliver on the pastrami and they did! The sloppy joe was also pretty solid.  The sandwiches are on point here and it will definitely be a go to for me when I am in the mood. Solid new addition in town! I ordered delivery and it came pretty quick.  Along with the sandwiches we ordered some onion rings which were good.  They weren't oily and had a good bite to them. We also had the cole slaw that was good.I will order again from Pastrami House. Give it a try and make sure to order the reuben.
2020-02-05,5,Folks. I am sure a few of you have shared the same idea when thinking about another new restaurant opening in Hoboken. Is it really going to be good or is this just another in and out? I tried the Pastrami Reuben today when walking home from work, and no joke this is the real deal. Fresh hot pastrami with all the bells and whistles of a true Reuben sandwich. It was exceptional and tasted authentic. It's by far the best Reuben sandwich I have had in Hoboken. If you're into pastrami, especially Reubens, give this a shot. What a pleasant surprise. Photo evidence included.
2020-01-31,3,Rye bread tasted old and pastrami was chewy I couldn't bite through it. Mini knishes were great though. There's no where to sit in the whole establishment which seems bizarre to me for a food place so be prepared for that. They have 3 drink refrigerators but no stools or tables.
2020-01-31,3,Very excited to hear that Hoboken had the Pastrami House open up on Washington. It's one of my favorite lunches, so I need to try it out. We came on a Saturday afternoon to find a massive line out the door. Very good sign. We ordered a little bit of everything including a Reuben, pastrami sandwich, pastrami hot dogs, Mac and cheese, onion rings and fries.The meat sandwiches were good. Not great at all. The texture of the meats were a little off. Little rubbery. The onion rings and French fries were just blah. Nothing special. But the MAC AND CHEESE?! The worst I've ever tasted. Of course my girlfriend ordered this but I warned her this isn't a place I would order Mac and cheese. I stand by my comments, as bad as it gets. Flavorless, watered down, just gross.  I'm happy a spot like this opened up, but I'd rather travel to Katz in a snow storm.
2020-01-28,5,Was really excited for this place, and it did not disappoint! Cool atmosphere, good breakfast. I'll have to try it out for lunch.
2020-01-27,5,I am so happy that pastrami house opened in Hoboken. It is all of the food that I was missing in this town, pastrami, matzoh ball soup, knishes, and other deli favorites are available here. I tried the large pastrami sandwich with cheese melted on top. They definitely know their pastrami here :) I definitely will have to come back and try some other things. I took the pastrami egg rolls to go and was able to enjoy them today. I liked them actually a lot more than I expected, and I saw that they have pastrami hotdogs on the menu which is also unique. They seem to have many desserts that look both handmade and things like cheesecake from juniors in New York. I will definitely be enjoying more food from pastrami house soon. This is definitely a place to get takeout from and they also deliver online, no seating yet but I hear that might happen down the road. All I can say is, Yum!
2020-01-25,5,This is the best sandwich I've ever had. They have GREAT food here. Even the lean pastrami is melt in your mouth good. And the people who work here are super nice.
2020-01-23,4,Had to get the Hot Pastrami sandwich for my first go because anything else would have seemed wrong. It was still warm by the time I got home (there are no tables to sit and eat there FYI). Thought the pastrami was fresh, juicy, and tasty. My one knock on the sandwich would be that I wish the rye bread was a bit fresher. The large sandwich with accompanying pickle (good) and coleslaw (fine) was the perfect portion for one.Service was slow but I'll give them benefit of the doubt considering they're still in soft opening phase.I hope they work the kinks out and stick around because Hoboken has long needed a good deli in addition to their arsenal of Italian delis.The knishes and pastrami egg rolls looked awesome so they're on my radar for next time.
2020-01-23,5,This place is amazing. I ended up getting the sloppy joe sandwich and the matzo ball soup. Both were great but I have to say that the matzo ball soup was the best I've ever had...& I grew up eating matzo ball soup so that says a lot. The workers were friendly and polite. They also have some great root beer. I'm so excited for this addition in the neighborhood!
2020-01-22,5,I stopped by today as a follow up on matzoh ball soup from yesterday.  Pastrami House is a solid addition to Hoboken. The food is well made, it's brand new and clean inside and the staff are working to get up to speed and to please.  I haven't had good matzoh ball soup in a long time and I can't get to 2nd ave deli that often. Real soup with real chicken. This is my go to going forward -- especially when sick.  :)   Today I came in for the turkey Russian sandwich and a knish. I love the Millburn Deli, and this was just as good. Finally Hoboken has a sandwich shop that makes a good deli sandwich. Not Italian (we excel there)  or a chain (too many of those).  Thanks Pastrami House!  I'll be back for the Pastrami this weekend
2020-01-18,4,Soft Open ReviewFirst off. This isn't Katz's Deli. Please stop with the Katz's Deli comparisons. There's only ONE Katz's and it is Katz's. So with that being said, I had a 10 ounce Turkey Rachel. To those who are unfamiliar, it is like a Turkey Reuben, except instead of sauerkraut, you swap coleslaw. I highly recommend it. I found it was quite delicious. I'd even hazard to order less turkey next time and just get a large. My rating would be an 7.8 out of 10. I'd order it again. I'm not going here every weekend to order. Probably something i'd try from here like once a month.Everyone needs to be prepared that the restaurant is NOT at full speed. I got there at 5:40pm on a Friday. They had six people behind the counter. One was at the register. Five workers. We had six customers. It took me over 30 minutes just to get my sandwich. It was painfully slow. I was aware this was a soft open, but at the same time it was annoying. Also - there are (currently) no seats at the deli. They are coming later. So be aware that it is take out only at the moment.
2020-01-17,3,I really wanted to like this place, but the food was just ok.  A lot of people seemed busy behind the counters, but they were just busy bumping into each other. Ordered a  grilled cheese for my daughter, and the cheese wasn't even melted - just slices of cheese between barely toasted bread.  Someone thought I ordered pasta salad when ticket had "pastrami" written on it, and the sandwich itself was just ok. Not the worst, but also not Katz quality meat. For a store called Pastrami House, you would think the star is the pastrami.
2020-01-13,1,Judging only on the soft opening. You have to provide edible food at the very least. Ordered two hot dogs with mustard and kraut. They put them in the container 5 minutes before the fries were ready and gave one portion of fries when each dog should come with one side. The order was for two, after all. I watched them put them in the container and they forgot the part about mustard and kraut. Had to remind them twice.  Dogs weren't just cold, they weren't cooked through! One bite and they went in the garbage. Kraut was ICE COLD as if it had just come out of the fridge. Kraut should be in a pot on a low flame during business hours period end of story. Fries were decent, added two pickles to the order and they were decent but not deli-special like old school pickles. Soda's were warm. Soft opening should have soft prices - like 50% off. Spent almost $20 for fries, two pickles and warm soda.
2020-01-13,4,Had classic Pastrami on Rye. Very fresh. Could have a little more spice and be more generous with the pickle (a thin wedge).  I'll go again. They just opened and are figuring things out.
2020-01-11,4,Great knishes! So awesome to have something new in town then the same old. Looking forward to trying more
2020-01-09,5,I'm so happy this place opened! They are still in their "soft opening" phase, so there's a couple of service links (very very minor) -- but the food is outstanding. Tonite was my second visit -- so far I've tried chicken soup, matzo ball soup, pastrami eggrolls (slightly greasy but gooood), potato croquettes, shrimp caesar salad, and a chicken balsamic sandwich.I'd get all of the above again except the sandwich - I didnt think it was anything special, especially with Vitos and Bagels on the Hudson being a couple doors down. The sandwich was good, but shame on me for not getting a pastrami sandwich or one of their other specialty sandwiches!
2020-01-08,3,Pastrami is pretty decent. Unfortunately I was not given any MUSTARD with my order. How do you forget to include this with a take out order( it's take out only) in the first week since opening? Bread was meh. Brisket is dry, tough and tasteless. Gravy wasn't good enough to save it. I might go back for a pastrami because it's the only show in town. I don't think this place has much else going for it. I don't know if it will last. Hoboken especially that far uptown is usually a wasteland for small businesses. I wish them luck but they are not off to a great start.
2020-01-07,4,New opening for Pastrami House in Hoboken. A little bit of a weird vibe when you go in (went at 1pm on a Monday). But I guess they're still getting the hang of things. Music would be a nice touch for sure. Had the pastrami rice balls which I thought were decent tasting. More rice than pastrami but I guess that's expected. The pastrami dogs were tasty. The meat over all was good but there were too many huge fatty pieces. The sauerkraut balanced it out well. Maybe on a different roll, the hotdog bun didn't compliment it. Served with steak fries. The hot pastrami sandwich to round it up was pretty good. Definitely no Kats but maybe in time. Maybe I'll come back in a month and try again. Definitely interested in the pastrami egg rolls and knishes!
2020-01-07,4,Just had a decent "Large" Brisket Sandwich from here. I was honestly expecting more. They do have an expansive menu. Service was good and the place is very clean. You can tell of the bat that Pastrami House is run well. I'll give it another chance, but after being spoiled by the other fantastic deli's in Hoboken the past 19 years, these guys really need to be on top of their game to stand out here. I will say that it's not fair to judge a place from one item during it's 1st week, so I gave them 4 stars. It does seem like a solid place and it has a lot of potential with all  of the items to choose from, so definitely give Pastrami House a shot. Who knows, it might become your new favorite. I think it's going to be a good addition to the deli offerings that Hoboken is known for.
2020-01-07,5,Went to Pastrami House's soft opening. There was a line around the block Saturday and Sunday afternoon. My thoughts:-Nicely designed-Various options on their menu and in the window by their counter -Sandwiches are a great size: (you can choose from 3 sizes) -The meat was of good quality -They do an interesting spin on some classics ay has the pastrami egg rolls -You can buy meat by the pound -They offer breakfast options
2020-01-06,4,Chicken soup for the soul! I can never find a non-sodium ridden chicken soup which is terrible when I'm sick. Pastrami house chicken soup is solid! It is your mom's chicken soup. It's great for this weather and when you're under the weather. You can't go wrong with pastrami here! Solid pastrami sandwich. They have a wide range of offerings. Can't wait to try them all!
2020-01-06,5,So excited that this opened here in Hoboken!  We have needed a good old fashion Pastrami Deli for years compared to more falafel and pizza.  We stopped by during their soft opening this week... wait was a bit long but the food was worth it in the end.  We just pasted by there again and had to stop in for a tasty treat...  looks like they have ironed out the wait time and the food is top-notch still and great for a local quick bite.  Hopefully, during the summertime, there will be outside seating.
2020-01-05,1,Wanted to love the place , but it turned out to be very blah . First off the service is horrible.  I waited 20 min for them to realize they lost my ticket.  I witnessed the owner screaming at his employees for tickets , very unprofessional and off putting.  The potato pancakes were tasteless. Not to mention I got charged for 6 and received 4 halves. Not sure if this is how it's supposed to be or not . Overall unimpressive .  Def will not be back !
2020-01-05,4,Good pastrami! Nice to have something different in town, this place has a ton of potential and I look forward to seeing their full menu when they fully open.  Knish was pretty good too, bummed that they ran out of matzo ball soup before I got there but this was their soft opening so we tempered our expectations.
2020-01-04,4,Great addition to the area.This place was going to be a bagel shop (kind of bummed that that didn't come through, as we don't really have a good one uptown)... BUT this is a great addition to the superfluous amount of delis in town.  The great thing about this place:  it has on the go/pre-packed dishes sides soups and drinks to go, and you can not only order brisket/pastrami based sandwiches, but cheesesteaks and chicken based sandwiches as well.  They do catering, and you can even come in and get certain meats by the pound (brisket, pastrami, etc).  Can't wait to try one of their latkes.  So happy to have a great Jewish deli with all of their fare in our neighborhood!
