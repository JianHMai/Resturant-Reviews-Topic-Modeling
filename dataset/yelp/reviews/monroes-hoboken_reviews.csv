2021-11-04,3,3.5*sI have been to Monroe's several times and spanning various experiences - from happy hour to full meals.  Each time I visit, I leave with the same feeling that the drinks and vibe were great, but that the food was simply OK.  While the menu is extremely unusual, the preparation can fall a bit flat.I will try to summarize a few of the menu items that I have tried.  From a beverage perspective, I do love their Avissi Prosecco from Veneto, Italy, which is available by the glass and also during their happy hour.  Their cocktails change seasonally, which I appreciate, and a recent one that I tried was the Dressed to Empress.  The drink included Empress Gin, Grand Marnier, lemon juice, peach puree, Junmai Sake, and club soda.  When the pretty orange beverage arrived, I took a sip through the straw and found the drink super sweet and juice-like.  However, after a quick stir, the cocktail became much more balanced and enjoyable.  When it comes to the food, I have mainly tried their seafood dishes.  The Misfit Tacos came in a trio and consisted of raw salmon, red onion, jalapeño, and a ginger soy sauce, all within a heavily-fried shell.  Though the fish was fresh, I was not a fan of the crunchy shell, which had reminded me of an egg roll wrapper.  The Eel and Avocado Roll was tasty, but rather mushy and a bit too warm temperature-wise.  The Salmon, Avocado, and Mango maki was an improvement, and the included fruit added a refreshing sweetness.  The Sexy & I Know It specialty roll was decent...The inside included cooked shrimp, cucumber, and mango, while slices of seared scallop and avocado were draped over the outside.  There was supposed to be a wasabi truffle sauce included, though, looking back, it had not been.  Lastly, my companion had stated that their Angus Sammy Burger was also just fine, and after sampling one of his accompanying French fries, I found that they tasted like they had been frozen; they were also very bland.I will also note that there is a Prohibition-style cocktail lounge called The Sinatra Room that is hidden behind a bookcase in the basement.  This was a cool space with a separate beverage menu.  I wound up just getting an Aperol Spritz there, but it was a well-made one, and I did enjoy the hidden, secret atmosphere.While I like the vibe Monroe's is after, I think the food could be a bit better.
2021-11-03,1,DO NOT EAT HERE! I made a delivery order last Friday night as I was craving some sushi and had been to their restaurant before and enjoyed the food. Huge mistake! My food arrived and as I opened the container to one of my meals, a small COCKROACH crawled out of a sushi roll and on to my table. I was so shocked and immediately called the restaurant to inform them of the situation. They validated what a problem having a cockroach in my food was but then told me their manager couldn't be available at the moment and would get back to be ASAP. Personally, I think that's ridiculous that a manager couldn't step aside to discuss a roach issue with a customer but I let it slide being that it was a Friday night dinner time. I've worked in many restaurants myself so I tried to be understanding of that. A few days later....no one reached out. So I called back to re-introduce my problem and get in contact with a manager. Again, no one was available to speak with me. They then suggested that I email the manager myself to request a refund and discuss my situation in which I said absolutely not because I should not be the one hunting down their management to get refunded for a roach in my meal. It's been almost 6 days now and I STILL HAVEN'T HEARD BACK. I'm absolutely shocked and disappointed in the lack of follow up and "service" of this business. I haven't even received a refund for my meal yet which I entirely threw out after finding the roach to begin with. I will absolutely not be giving this place any further business and will make sure to spread the word to family and friends not to either. Roaches and poor customer service. No thanks!
2021-10-26,5,We've eaten dinner here many times and the food is always delicious and the atmosphere is fantastic.Recently we hosted a baby shower here. Yin the manager was very nice and super accommodating. Everyone said they had a great time. A few people said "when I have a baby shower, this is what I want." The day couldn't have gone better.
2021-10-23,4,The drinks here are amazing. The flouts flower bomb is probably my favorite. I love the theme and decor and this place has one of the best happy hours in Hoboken. The food is OK - I tried the guac with dumpling chips. The guac was amazing but the chips just tasted fried and lacked flavor. You can't go wrong with their sushi rolls though!
2021-10-16,5,I hosted my 27th birthday party at The Sinatra Room (in the basement of Monroe's) and can't say enough good things about it! Firstly, Yin helped me plan the private event making sure that every detail was perfect leading up to it. I even got to choose 2 signature cocktails (and name them!) which were presented to my guests in a cute frame. If you have been here before, you know that the music, food and vibes are on point and this night was no different. The bartenders were great too and made sure that our glasses were never empty during the open bar! I would host an event here again in a heartbeat.
2021-09-25,3,so here's my take on Monroe's. The service is absolutely horrible, there is no other way to put it. They need to either hire more waitresses or get better ones. The food was good but the sushi took over an hour to come out and was definitely sitting out got a while and the drinks were rushed and not amazing. This place has the potential to be great but service is super important and needs to be handled first.
2021-09-25,1,I want to start by saying the 1-STAR review has nothing to do with the food. The food at this establishment was AMAZING but the service is HORRIBLE and for this reason I will NEVER be returning.We had a 7:30 pm reservation for 6 people. As soon as we sat, we were greeted and asked what type of water we want. We ordered drinks and they took awhile to get to us but we were okay, it was Friday and we were busy catching up.We order 4 appetizers. They take awhile too. During this a drink is spilled on my by accident by the waiter. No biggie, accidents happen. But I was wet and sticky and surrounded by glass. A bus boy came to clean it up and didn't clean under our table just around us. The waiter was SO apologetic. Randomly 30 minutes later (after ordering a second drink) I get a drink from the manager to apologize for the spill for a drink that I did not like from the first go around.Then we order dinner. We were with my pregnant girlfriend. We specifically came to this place because they have cooked sushi options. My fiancé and I actually raved about it because we came in the spring with family and LOVED it. My girlfriend confirmed her rolls with the waiter and he checked with the cook to ensure it would be safe to eat. We order dinner and continue to catch up.Then two hours go by. It is almost 10 pm and we do not have dinner nor has anyone come to check on us, ask us to order drinks or even fill up our water glasses! We go and speak with the hostess and she goes to check on our food.Finally the food ones... all on one plate for 6 people. We ask the hostess and waiter which rolls are which and get conflicting answers. Now I am a picky sushi eater, I want what I ordered and my girlfriend is pregnant - she does not want to risk eating something she isn't supposed to be eating. It is chaos. Finally the manager who is also pregnant (whom must of said that to us a million times) said she eats this roll and points to a roll all the time and she is fine. Well I am sorry that answer does not sit well with us. We did not drive an hour away to for cooked sushi that we think my pregnant friend could eat. She did not feel comfortable eating there so she did not.We asked to speak to a manager and we informed by the hostess that she was the manager. Instead of apologizing all this manager did was make excuses. "I am 6 months pregnant," "We are slammed tonight," "It's his 4th shift," "there is a language barrier with the chef." Not once did they own up to their mistakes and apologize. Then she left us and never came back to check in or apologize or work anything out with the bill.We also had 9 pm reservations in their speakeasy for a night cap after dinner. Needless to say, we did not want to go. The manager saw us leaving and finally came up to my fiancé and I when our 4 friends had already exited saying please come down for drinks, we will comp  them. I told her how embarrassed I was for dragging my friends an hour away for an evening that was anything but horrible and  that we just wanted to go home. Again instead of apologizing all she did was blame her pregnancy and how packed they were.It was honestly THE WORST DINING EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD.The chef is amazingly talented though - the food was bomb. However Monroe's needs to restructure their staff because it is being poorly managed and driving customers away from such a gem.
2021-09-24,5,Cool vibe, Unique menu,  lol the tacos are mini but if you  more plates you will be fullFun dinning experience Amazing service, Hannah is a sweat girl that took great care of our table
2021-09-22,5,The food and drinks were on point and the service was spectacular. I've went back more then once because I love the food
2021-09-20,2,I do think this was just a bad night. We waited for someone to take our drink order for only a couple mins. But then 3 separate people came out to take it. They didn't taste right but they were just strong. We finally ordered after another good 10-15 mins. We tried to order another round of drinks but none of them came out right. Come to find out their bartender had walked out on them. We decided to call it a night and just asked for the check. It was impossible to get any service at that point. When we got the bill we saw they had charged us for numerous drinks we had never received so straightening that out required the manager who actually said to us "look, I'm tired and pregnant" - guess the customer isn't always right. Maybe we'll give them another try. But the prices were high for such awful service.
2021-09-10,1,No stars.  None.  This place is a disaster.  The worst dinner experience ever.  Service was horrendous.  Our drink orders were always wrong.  Always.  At times the waiter tried to pass them off as being correctly made.  Not even close. Most times they never reached our table.  We complained over and over and we were told they were sorry.  Over and over again.  But no attempt was made to rectify. It just got worse. We asked for the check which the gave to us promptly. Imagine that. The check had $100 + of drinks that we ordered but never received.  Never received.  The ones that we received were wrong. More I'm sorry's.  I was with an  important business client and his wife.  I was mortified.  An absolute dumpster fire. Avoid.  This place is an embarrassment.  They didn't even have sake and they service sushi. Epic fail. You deserve better.
2021-08-26,2,I have returned numerous times. The service here is really really bad. Slow, forgetful, unattentive. Sat outside and got ignored. Sat inside with few other tables, and got ignored. Honestly, good food but go to Saku instead for sushi
2021-08-01,1,Just go for brunch, you'll see! Slow service, mediocre food, lack of management. $0.99 drinks with brunch entree but it takes 99 mins for a refill!
2021-07-17,5,This place is the full package. You can make a whole night out of dinner, the Sinatra room, and the events they host. The food, specifically sushi was great, cocktails were awesome, and service unmatched.
2021-07-15,2,Last night I came here for friends 30th birthday with my girlfriend. The drinks were good, a little on the stronger side, but good indeed. The food options were delicious and no complaints there. The only thing that bother me was that there was more than 30 ppl in attendance and not one fork or spoon for the sauces was in sight. I mean come on I get it's finger food but it's party you should be prepared with silverware and napkins not just food on plates for ppl to pick with their hands. Besides that the staff was pretty great. JoJo I think her name was soo nice and kept the party goers entertained. A1 service from her and the lady that was running the food and swiping cards for tabs. The bartenders on the other hand, little short Spanish lady, didn't get her name but could careless for it anyways, but if misery was a person it's her. My girlfriend tried to strike up some friendly convo to only be hit with a nasty and rude response. Ignored me to use her phone while I was standing there waiting for a drink and they asked someone else who came up after me if they needed help. Smug attitude like she didn't want to be doing this party. I mean come on. I've been in the industry for years. If you're bartending you should be smiling and inviting so people will want to come back. I mean Jesus what's the say? "If you don't like your job then quit!" Literally written all over face how she wasn't haven't it. I give it to her for making good drinks but shit girl smile more you'd make more in tips and people would actually want to come back and see you. Other then that one bad apple I had a good time and thank everyone else for playing their part...
2021-06-28,4,Nice jazz band at summer nights. but in terms of the capacity, you may need to ask for service a couple of times. Overall it's a good place to chill  and chat.
2021-06-27,5,This is a pretty nice spot. Food and drinks were pretty good ! Can't complain about the service, our waitress was very friendly and attentive
2021-06-25,2,I came here for brunch with a group of women to celebrate my friends Bachelorette party and her birthday party.  The restaurant is really nice aesthetically both inside and outside which will make for great IG posts. The menu is interesting and the food was good I had one of the poke bowls and I cannot complain.  Where Monroe's falls short is their service.  Our waitress was less than hospitable and appeared to be bothered. There is a choice between mimosas or bellinis which are reasonably priced for brunch. When people in our party were ready for their next drink they were told they needed to finish what was in their glass before another one would be given as they use the same glass. So at one point our waitress was taking all of our glasses away to refill them with mimosas but how could she possibly know which glass beloved to who? This seems like a very unsanitary practice to employ. Also before they would bring out our meals she said that the appetizers needed to be finished first, it just felt very controlling. Then when it was time for the bill we saw that gratuity was already added which explains the poor service.  I think this restaurant could provide an overall great experience if they focus more on service as well as not reusing glasses and making guests finish their apps before their meals would be brought out.
2021-06-12,3,Food - CreativeAmbiance - Old SchoolMusic - Lovely  Service -GreatSo why three stars?Flash Migraine inducing photography!
2021-06-10,4,Nice sushi menu , bar is good for cocktails and sheeshas. They have amazing outdoor sheeshas which are seasonal. Overall a nice place in Hoboken to meet friends or have relaxed time with your better half
2021-05-28,2,Poor customer service all night-- took forever to greet us and take drink orders, food came out at separate times, no soy sauce for sushi rolls, etc. Then slapped our party of 5 with the 20% auto gratuity which was policy for parties of 6 or more. Not classy-- won't be back!!!
2021-05-22,1,This place was absolutely terrible, first of all their was no AC and it was 90 degrees inside the restaurant. The sushi looks like it was made 2 and half years go. Please do not go here. I promise you will be wasting money. 160$ for 2 people. I would've rather had a dirty water dog.
2021-05-22,1,Such a scam, they charged us $40 for water?!?! This is absolutely ridiculous. We asked for "still water" over sparking, after given only two options. Thinking "still" was the only option that wouldn't cost me the equivalent of a bottle of wine. I asked to speak to someone about this and was immediately brushed off. BEWARE would not recommend. I am highly disappointed in the service. $40 for water?! Thanks Monroe's. I won't be coming back.
2021-05-22,5,Great service, food, etc. The staff is so sweet and the food and drinks are exceptional !!
2021-05-15,3,The food itself was tasty, but the entire atmosphere was quite strange. All of the decor was themed based off of Marilyn Monroe but the food was a asian fusion with sushi being the majority of the menu which I was not expecting. The lighting was very dim, making it hard to see the people I was at the table with and the music was very loud so I needed to shout to be heard.
2021-05-08,5,I loved this place! Great atmosphere! Amazing service! Amanda was amazing. Argenis was wonderful too! This place is great but make your reservations before you go! You will not be disappointed
2021-05-07,1,Super disappointed. I got there at 845 pm and ordered within 10 minutes. We did not receive our food until 1045. Once we received the food it was not good. Not only did we not get a single apology but we were asked twice how everything was before we got our food. Lol. On top of that. We paid $260 (before tip, it wasn't the waitresses fault) for mediocre food and a 2 hour wait for food.
2021-05-05,4,Was super surprised to see the inside looked the way it did. Had never been here before. Really dark but definitely like older times vibe. we had sushi and two Asian appetizers which were all amazing. Drinks were good, but service was slow which is my only complaint. Food runner was so so friendly!! Will definitely be back.
2021-05-05,4,This is the second time I Have been at Monroe's.  The first time I was hear, I sat outside. I ordered a few drinks, calamari, sushi rolls and a hookah. This time outdoor dining was not open (they were shooting for may).  There were only a few tables when we sat down inside and the service was alright upon arrival.  We ordered the chips and guacamole to start. These were pretty good.  We also ordered a few rounds of drinks (beer and a margarita). Both were pretty solid. By the time we went to put in the rest of our order the place filled up in front quickly.  The staff was definitely overwhelmed.  The forgot on of our apps but blamed it on another server for not ringing it in and then later saw it on our bill when we were closing out. The food here is really good and the pricing is reasonable.  Once they hire more staff for the summer I'm sure the service will be back to normal.
2021-04-28,3,We got there pretty early and was one of three tables. Service was pretty good from the beginning since it was pretty slow. As the night went on the tables started to fill and the servers were def overwhelmed. If they had more staff this place would be dynamite. The food was pretty decent. The wings had really good flavor, guacamole was alright, actually liked the chips more than the guacamole. The sushi roles were good and fresh. NThe atmosphere is really cool in there with a good vibe. There is also a speakeasy downstairs that seemed to be pretty busy. I'm assuming the staff was split between those two spots which definitely hurt the Resturant a bit. I'd like to come back once the outdoor space reopens. They have really reasonable prices on the food as well, would like to try a few more rolls next time as well as the nigiri. Hopefully they are able to get a little more staffing by the time the busy summer roles around.
2021-04-03,5,Firstly, I just wanted to say thank you to the entire staff. My party of 3 last night had the best time, and I cannot say enough good things about the entire experience. The staff was attentive, friendly & incredibly knowledgeable. The drinks were amazing & it was the perfect night, really. I have not felt comfortable going out AT ALL minus the essentials during COVID times & Monroe's/The Sinatra Room staff put my mind at ease completely. It was so worth making reservations & having to wait a little. Seriously- come here!!!
2021-03-30,5,What an amazing experience! We made reservations for a large group for a Friday night and due to COVID were highly concerned that they could not accommodate us.  However, the manager made sure to go above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. The place is very nicely decorated with a decent amount of tables.  there was also live music which was a great touch to our night.  Additionally, the service and the food were both great and overall we had an amazing night.  Thank you to the management team for truly taking such good care of us!
2021-03-29,1,HOLY CRAP! Good luck trying to get a reservation to the new Sinatra Room with these INCOMPETENT fools. I've been trying for weeks to get a damn reservation, and it's been the most painful experience in my lifetime. Reservations can only be made via email, and they have idiots handling the account. "I'll take your first available Friday or Saturday in the month of April for 2 ppl between 7-9pm". WHAT IS SO DIFFICULT!?? It is beyond infuriating that this moran cannot comprehend what I'm asking. 3 days in between each email correspondence for stupid follow up questions with incorrect information. I was so excited to come here and try out the new drinks. Until you can get some competent staff to take reservations or better yet, a reservation system that is not via email - I would love to one day try this place. How can I give YOU a date when YOU are all booked up?! I'm asking YOU for your first available date! Wtf is so hard to comprehend???
2021-03-29,4,I have mixed reviews on Monroes. The ambiance is awesome. There was a live singer and then great music afterwards. Drinks were pretty good but nothing crazy. Huge food selection! We got the Tuna Rice Krispies and wow, definitely my favorite! Also got the Yellowtail tacos and the Cod Bao buns, both were good but wouldn't get either again. As for the sushi, our two sushi rolls tasted very similar/bland despite being completely different fish. Service was really great and attentive in the beginning and then started to dwindle. Our sushi entrees were brought out with our apps, which was overwhelming. I also think we were given one wrong sushi roll but our waitress swore it was correct. We then waited a good 20 minutes after dessert just to see our waitress and ask for the check. Overall, I would go back and maybe try a burger and then hit The Sinatra Room downstairs for some cool cocktails.
2021-03-27,4,Our daughter, who lives in Hoboken, took us to Monroe's and we had a great experience, except for the noise level.  We were a party of 5 with her roommate and her roommate's boyfriend joining us as well.  We all had a very difficult time communicating to one another across the table.  I thought it might be due to our age, but given that my daughter and her two friends were in their early to mid-20s and also couldn't hear, we felt the noise level took away from the wonderful experience of the restaurant.  I mean, who goes to a restaurant to not talk?  We asked the wait staff a few times if the music could be turned down, but they were unable to accommodate us.  Oh, I should mention that the live music that evening (March 19th) was fantastic!  She was a great singer and had a beautiful voice, but again, the only problem we had was that we couldn't communicate amongst ourselves.  The table just in front of the singer was a bridal party and they had no problem screaming at each other to be heard, but to the detriment of the performer who probably picked up on some of their screeching in her mic.    Anyway, overall, good food and fun drinks were had!
2021-03-24,4,The ambiance and decor was a cool vibe! The menu had a bunch of interesting options to choose from. The Asian fusion sushi take menu with a pop ambiance made this a fun experience. The actual food itself was good but could use more flavor.
2021-03-11,5,Monroe's holds a special place in our hearts. We have been twice, both for Drag Brunch, and the energy is u matched. The staff is welcoming and professional, the owner Melanie is amazing, and the performers and vendors brought in our so much fun! The pricing is so great for a 3 course meal and endless bubbly and it's sooo good. From sushi, to burger, to steak, to dessert it's all so good! We have planned this for our anniversary dinner this year and we can't wait for the next Babes who Brunch! Make a reservation here, it is a must!*returned last night and Alondra provided amazing service again! Sushi was fresh so great see the pizza guess below!
2021-03-06,5,Monroe's has excellent service and great  food!  Tables were socially distant and all staff wore masks and practiced Covid safety protocols.Make reservations for the Sinatra Room a secret bar located downstairs of Monroe's.For our GNO, we shared the wings and guacamole for starters. I ordered a Hoboken Girl hard seltzer, and my Girl Gang had some mock-tails and cocktails.I ordered the Sammy burger- tasty juicy burger with cheddar cheese and bacon on a soft bun served with crunchy fries. The menu had a lot of sushi rolls and unique fusion dishes. We didn't have dessert because we head some drinks at the Sinatra room downstairs.Looking forward to coming back to try the brunch!
2021-03-06,5,This bar has the best service in Hoboken. The food is great and the vibes are even better. The hostess's kindness and compassion blew me away. I believe her name was Erica. I highly recommend Monroes!
2021-03-05,5,Monroe's is fantastic! The night was great, we got to see the speakeasy, try some delicious cocktails and the food was great as well. The server was accommodating and kind. I will definitely be back!
2021-02-28,5,Came here with my husband to celebrate our anniversary and I'm so glad we did. Started with dinner at Monroe's. The food was so good and fresh. My favorite appetizer was the misfit tacos, we had tuna and they were delicious. My favorite sushi roll was I only love my sushi and my momma, I want to go back for that for sure! We were super impressed with the quality of the sushi.  It was so fresh, perfect temperature, and prepared perfectly. The cocktails were very good and nicely presented. We will definitely be back in the future. The Sinatra Room. Loved it! The service was great, the cocktails were delicious, and the ambiance was perfect. Also, the bar so was so clean. The server thoroughly sanitized all areas every time a party left. My favorite drink was And then he kissed me, so refreshing and tasty. My husband really enjoyed the Life is but a dream. Copacabana was also very good and easy to drink. We loved the decor and the set up. The drinks came out quickly considering they are cocktails and take time to prepare unlike a simple rum and coke or just ordering a beer. We had plenty of time to order all the drinks we wanted even with the 90 minute time limit. Can't wait to be back with some friends to enjoy these delicious cocktails.
2021-02-28,2,Real shame, real shame. Good food, awful service. Saturday night date nights should be memorable, but when the entire staff forgets that you exist it leaves a bad aftertaste. We showed up ten minutes prior to our reservation, and as we were watching the high top I specifically requested (and was told by the hostess minutes prior) be cleaned off for our use, it was given to some snobby couple that walked in after us, and we were then given the table that they had turned down (I had SPECIFICALLY requested a high top). As I sat down I proceeded to unroll the napkin and my knife fell out, not a big deal, the hostess came and retrieved it, I never saw a knife again, isn't it common practice to replace dirty silverware at restaurants? Now, our server, if you can call him that, took over ten minutes after we were sat to pour us water, we were unable to order drinks or food quickly enough as he disappeared again. 7-10 minutes later he reappeared and took our drink and appetizer order. The crunchy rice cakes by the way are awful, Hudson and CO's are far superior, there is far too much rice in the ratio at Monroe's and it legitimately hurts to crunch, what the heck. Our server then dropped off incorrect drinks (that's fine because we weren't charged for them), and take our entree order, this would be the LAST time we would see him basically all night. The hostess came and cleared all plates, chop sticks, and silverware, giving us a gentle nudge to leave, only thing those were our appetizer plates and we hadn't even seen our entree. So when our entree was brought out, we had no utensils or plates to speak of, had to flag down a completely different server to provide us with the essentials, oh and soy sauce doesn't come with their sushi apparently, had to ask for that. By this time my beer was empty, and the server glanced from a few feet away as the other server brought us what we needed, obviously assuming he didn't need to help us since another staffer did? Wrong. I watched as our actual server chatted up other servers at the bar POS system, in plain sight of everyone in his section. I never got another beer, and the server had the gall to show up an hour and twenty five minutes into our reservation to see if we needed dessert or drinks. No thanks. Real shame, because everyone had told me this place was such a great establishment. Best part of the night? Picking up Artichoke Pizza down the street to wash the Bad taste of this bs experience out of my mouth.
2021-02-27,1,Let me start by saying this is the coolest idea. The Sinatra room speakeasy downstairs has great cocktails. We did have to wait over 30 minutes for each round so by the end of our 90 minutes time limit, we had just received our third drink. We had booked a dinner reservation for upstairs at Monroe's after the speakeasy reservation. The speakeasy reservation ran over because the drinks so long so we went upstairs to the Monroe's hostesses about 9:30. I explained that we had made a post speakeasy reservation for dinner and the reservation downstairs ran long. The one hostess told me to give them 5-10 minutes to clear the table and they'd seat us. After about 20 minutes, I approached the other hostess to ask about the status of our reservation. She nastily responded to me that i didn't actually have a reservation and that they were doing what they can. I told her I had both email and text confirmation of the reservation and showed her the text message. She then told me the table was being cleared and it'd be about 5 minutes. About 10 minutes later, she told me the party was leaving and we'd be seated. We waited almost an hour to get seated after initially being told it'd be 5-10 minutes.Once seated, we were not provided or offered water: the waiter came over and asked for our drink and small plates order. I ordered a couple of plates of the fries and we as a group ordered some cocktails and additional appetizers. A few minutes later, the waiter came back and asked for our entree orders. At this point, I asked for water because it still had not been provided or offered.We received cocktails before the sodas that were ordered. We receive entrees before the appetizers. The order of fries was a joke compared to the price. The slush orders did not come with soy sauce. When you asked for soy sauce, you received a tiny plastic container. The staff at Monroe's made us feel unwelcomed, and the drinks and food did not make up for it. This is a great idea with terrible execution. In addition, the women's bathroom was disgusting. It looked like it hadn't been cleaned in days and stalls were missing toilet paper.Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.
2021-02-27,1,I really don't like to do this - please let me preface with that. But holllyyyyy cow.We started the night down in the speakeasy called The Sinatra Room. You get 90 minutes and only 2 cocktails. Grant it, the cocktails are delicious and the vibe is fun, but really? 2 cocktails in 90 minutes. Yikes.We had a reservation schedule for right at Monroe's after but after everything was said in done...we were late. And then they tried to say we didn't have a reservation. They would accommodate us though in 10 minutes (but really it was 30+).Don't waste your time at Monroe's if you want good service and good sushi. Especially for their price point. It is not worth it. We had to ask for water. It only got worse from there. We ordered cocktails and some non-spirits (literally a Diet Coke and sprite) and we got the sodas after the cocktails. LOL wut? Where is the logic. Our food orders were delayed and out of order. Sushi rolls and main entrees came before appetizers and sashimi. What we got was not what was pictured on their social. Don't expect to get soy sauce with your sushi automatically either - you need to ask for it.  Not worth it. There are better American/Japanese fusion spots in the area. I understand that the establishment is new and but yikes. There is a lot of room for improvement. A lot.Best of luck but I wish this was still Biggies.Also, did Frank Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe even eat sushi? Just wondering. LOLAnother edit: what is up with the sticky bathroom floors? And there was no toilet paper either? Lmao I'm so glad I can laugh about this with my friends. This is wild.
2021-02-27,2,I have no problem paying for quality but this was just meh. The food is not worth the price. The speakeasy bar is great but avoid the restaurant.
2021-02-14,5,Great place to go for a girls night or take a date out. I live the Roaring 20 vibes and the food was delicious. They had everything from sushi, seafood to steak. Out waiter also mention, it will now have a speakeasy bar. Follow Instagram for the password. Great place for a cocktail to start the weekend.
2021-02-12,5,Loved the service! The food was amazing. Usually i'm not a big fan of sushi since i'm a simple girl. but they changed my mind towards that! i loved the food so much, it was delicious and amazing. Also, the staff was so nice. they gave us everything that was needed and didn't have to repeat ourselves once. they did their jobs very well, i had a great experience overall. I was a little iffy due to the fact i've never been here but they didn't disappoint. I will be coming here every time i have a special event and will be recommending everybody to come to this place. Not just for the food, but for the experience and the staff. If i can give more than 5 stars, i will.
2021-02-11,1,Went for brunch. They had one waitress servicing in the entire restaurant. I was ordering regular cocktails (not even the brunch specials) and it was impossible to get fresh drinks. Two women who appeared to be managers were working ... but not helping the staff on the floor at all.They then started an Instagram photoshoot! They had a ring light that was  shining in our eyes. I didn't care for the strange asian-fusion brunch selection and the food was mediocre, too.Will not return.
2021-01-31,5,Loved their new cocktail and brunch menus. The atmosphere is great and always great food. Since i last visited in summer this place has come a long way and I'm excited for the new speakeasy to open. Recommend - Rice Krispies and I only love my sushi and my momma roll.
2021-01-28,3,I'm so glad this place is open during this terrible pandemic. Very nice atmosphere as well good drinks. Wings were ok sushi was magnificent. Would recommend for a nice cozy date.
2021-01-19,5,This place was a 10/10 for us! We went for Brunch on Sunday after finding out about it on the ig. The brunch deal is amazing - $25 entrees and then 99 CENT cocktails! Our waitress Alondra was absolutely lovely and so much fun. The restaurant was quiet when we first got there and followed all covid precautions. We will definitely be back and do recommend to anyone on the edge of deciding to go!
2021-01-17,5,Came here tonight and had the best time. The cocktails and sushi rolls were both amazing. Ordered the Spicy California, Shrimp Tempura and a Salmon roll. They were all phenomenal. I had a Moscow Mule. Ordered a second, that's how good it was. The cherry in the Old Fashions was great. Staff was super kind and attentive. Would definitely come back again. The bartender also informed me a speak easy will be coming in downstairs. Excited to check that out. 10/10 for me. I highly recommend this place. The rolls are decently priced. Nothing over the top. Specialty drinks are as they would be anywhere else. Make a reservation if possible. You won't be disappointed.
2021-01-04,4,Nice drinks, date night environment and HOOKAH! Our food was pretty flavorful. The drinks were a little weak but everything else checked out. I love finding places in the Hoboken area that support an urban crowd. Finally a nice place, great location, good food, decent music and hookah. Sounds like fun to me!
2020-12-30,4,The wings were tasty, even though they didn't travel super well (wings often don't). I could tell that they would be even better when fresh or even heated up in an air fryer. My cousin reheated the leftovers the next day this way and said they were better after being crisped by the air fryer. The wasabi blue cheese was very good. The wasabi was very subtle, not at all overwhelming, which I had been worried about because I'm not a huge wasabi lover. The rosemary fries were fun but steak fries aren't my favorite. I think they'd be better as smaller fries. I did enjoy the mustard dip option they came with. The green salad was ok. Nice fresh ingredients for sure, which I appreciated, but just a little over-simple. The adult kale seemed to be missing something, since it can be hard to eat raw and relatively  plain. I'm a kale fan, so I did eat it :)Very cool fusion menu here. the last item we tried was a sweet potato roll. I was tempted to try additional sushi rolls but there was already too much food for two of us :) Sustainable and nice packaging.
2020-12-14,3,We have mixed feelings about Monroe's! So the drinks were amazing. We got a complimentary tequila hot chocolate where they came over and roasted the marshmallows on top. I also got a drink called the butterfly effect that changed colors when you stirred it. So the cocktails here are 5/5 on presentation and flavor. On the other hand, we were not to impressed with the food. It was pretty basic calamari and a pretty basic burger. Nothing really stood out too us besides the drinks. So we recommend this place for cool drinks and appetizers!
2020-11-09,5,Try the lavender drink! Really fun atmosphere. The Rice Krispie apps were the best !!!
2020-11-08,3,I reviewed this place extensively before going, and  despite the mixed reviews, I went because it was a nice place for people who like sushi and are with people who don't, so I appreciate the variety in their menu. We got the beef misfit tacos to share (we knew that they were going to be that small), my friend got the Old Money pasta dish, and me and a friend got two special rolls, Lost Love & All I Need. The tacos were okay, I tried my friends pasta dish and did not like it all, it was very plain and bland; obviously nothing compared to pasta I could get at a real Italian restaurant in Hoboken, but it was fine for my friend. The rolls were fresh and yummy. We sat outside and the music was extremely loud and annoying to have to scream across the table to talk to your friends. Overall would probably not come here again, as I've better sushi elsewhere
2020-11-01,3,I would give Monroe 3.5 stars if possible. My boyfriend and I came here for a late dinner on Halloween.  We got the Blurred Lines and Butterfly Effect to drink and The Blind Date appetizer to share. The drinks tasted ok but we could barely taste the alcohol. The appetizer was tasty but expensive for what you get. The tostones could have used a little salt.To eat we had the Carraway pasta and Kennedy burger. The pasta was good and the burger was ok. Overall our experience was just very average.
2020-10-11,1,Wow!! just wow!! and not in a great way. First, I would like to say unbelievable! I thought Monroe's would be a great choice after passing along a few restaurants but boy oh boy was I wrong. It's a Sunday so they are serving brunch and the first disappointment  was the weird avocado toast which was on lightly toasted wonder bread with artificial crab meat that was Strike 1 but hey let's give it a chance right? Here comes second course this should be better right .. nope it gets worst, Mushy French toast with canned mango fruit and I guess it was also suppose to be coconut syrup. I took a bite and couldn't believe what they were serving not to mention the scramble egg and onion something something tacos (couldn't make out the rest) that also came to the table ... this is when I had enough and asked to speak with the manager ... here I am about to spend $80 for this?? Come on!  Okay I guess the drinks are cool and the atmosphere but what about the food? Maybe if I had got tipsy enough before eating at this brunch spot I wouldn't have noticed and my standards would have been so low that I would have been tricked to pay this bill.  But I wasn't there for the drinks I was hungry and wanted something good to eat. I asked the manager to allow me to pay for what I ate and not to serve me the rest. She came over with an attitude and continued to talk over me before listening to reasoning. It was set in her mind that their food is delicious and that I was going to pay the bill. I politely removed myself from the table to have a conversation with her on the side where others would not be interrupted while having their meal. She refuse to keep it between just us and snatched my money (upset that I only wanted to pay for what I eaten) said her kitchen is struggling and yelled for me not to come back. I was flabbergasted. So this is why I'm being treated this way because your kitchen is struggling??? I yelled back at her (mask on) Have a great day!! But she didn't like it that much and continued to share her unprofessional(ism) with her other guest and continued to talk about me as I walked away. All I wanted was to pay for what I ate and leave but she continued to send others out to talk to me and give me a hard time. Who does the hiring around here. I honestly feel anyone above her wouldn't be any different. The only thing I can do is not ever go back there. I didn't get her name but she claimed to be a manager. All I wanted for this Sunday is to get something to eat outdoors and have a wonderful day and I did just that I walked a few feet up to La Casa (latin American food) and the food and service was impeccable! Thanks for ending my day :) Stay Away From Monroe's if you want good food.
2020-10-11,5,Fantastic place. Sucks they opened when they had to but the staff is amazing and the food is incredible. Great place to go if you want sushi but you're with someone who doesn't love sushi. They have everything. Cocktails are amazing too. One of the better openings in Hoboken recently
2020-10-06,4,post-Covid, Monroe's is all the vibe. the music is lively, the drinks are fun, and the spacious outdoor seating and decoration is charming.went on a Sunday night around 7:30pm, energy was pretty low key but they do brunch so the attendance was fizzling out by then. a dynamic menu to choose from including sushi, burgers, salads, and tacos. seems crazy to blend all that but it works and it's all quality. service/our server was ehhh but the manager Ben is a way cool and generous dude that made our time memorable. cocktail menu is interactive and refreshing. great place for a 1v1 date or a group setting.
2020-10-04,1,Sadly, I had a horrible experience today at Monroe's that wasted 40 minutes of my time. Today, I made a 1 PM lunch reservation at Monroe's Hoboken and truly looked forward to dining outside and ordering sushi.When we arrived, it was slow to be seated. After seated for about 5 minutes, a woman arrived & nicely asked if we had any questions about the menu. We said no & stated we were ready to order. She explainedthat we had to wait for the waiter. I did feel bad noticing they only had one waiter for all the tables outside. Finally the waiter came to take our order at 1:40 PM. We waited a full 40 minutes for him to come. He then told us that we "had to order alcohol" and that we wouldbe forced to do a special brunch menu. I explained we don't drink alcohol but would be happy to order a la carte. He said no - we would have to order the pre-fixe brunch menu & that this came with a carafe of alcohol that we would be charged for, even if we don't drinkalcohol. Nowhere online did it say this when I made the reservation. Additionally we were not told this when we were seated. We had to wait 40 minutes for this news to be delivered. Truly upsetting and a waste of time since we left after that. To force people to order alcohol - and to not allow people to order a la carte is irresponsible. There was in fact a minor at the table next to us, who was not carded & he was gracious enough to say that he was not 21 - but then was still told he would be charged for the alcohol despite this. I won't return to Monroe's and feel these business practices and encouraging binge drinking is irresponsible. A carafe of alcohol per person is frankly ridiculous.
2020-09-30,4,Monroe's went above my expectations - pricey but the food is good. Came here twice during the pandemic and I felt safe both times. It's an interesting mixture of modern American Asian cuisine with a hookah bar. Starting with food, again it's pricey ($$) - rose fries (thick cut fries, not my favorite but you can't go wrong with fries)- cry me a river / onion rings: not worth $10. Thin slices, oily and not flavorful- misfit tacos: you get to choose 3 of the same tacos for $9. Super flavorful BUT small. Each taco is the size of a slice of orange - sushi: good combination of flavors. Didn't like that most of their specials had shrimp tempura since I have a shellfish allergy - skip the crispy fried cheesecake, it's just okay Hookah/shisha was a fun experience. Try it with the pineapple head for more flavor; and they give you individual tips to avoid contamination - a big plus during the pandemic. Finally, Monroe's is exceptional at service. Our waitress Z was really nice and helpful with recommendations. She made the experience worth it and from other yelpers, seems to be a common experience!
2020-09-27,4,Came here during happy hour and the outdoor seating is spectacular. They just hadn't updated their menu officially so a lot of things I wanted were not on the menu. Service was nice though!
2020-09-17,5,Love the brunch there !! My friends and I were walking around looking for a place and the outdoor seating area caught our eyes... The food was delicious.
2020-09-13,5,I was very visiting my daughter and this place caught our eye because she's vegan. Dang that edamame was amazing. My drink was so good, blurred limes. You gotta try it. I shared a burger with a friend and it was tasty. Had a very hard time deciding on an entrée because everything looked great but I realized sharing was better since we planned on drinking after.  Great staff and Vibe
2020-09-06,1,I was very excited to visit Monroe's for the first time! A different type of spot in hoboken with an Asian fusion! I went with five girlfriends for brunch. We arrived and were told we were not allowed to order any drink or item outside of the brunch price fix. We told our server we would be happy to pay the additional price for a different beverage since the price fix including beverages had to be ordered together. They were also out of 2/5 of the drinks on said menu. She told us no and then finally agreed to check, which was approved. When she came back she told us that was ok and she had recently started there. Understandable and a couple of us have been servers so we were trying to be nice. Every request was met with annoyance (basic things like salt/pepper, pitcher of water, etc). We had to ask for our drinks and items multiple times. The manager came over and was unapologetic and told us the bartender was busy and could not make additional sangria. The place was empty and when I went inside he had ordered domino's at the bar. The food was lackluster and one of my friend's got avocado toast which one side had no avocado.I never write negative reviews and normally give the server the benefit of the doubt but the lack of care was really what got me. The majority of the staff needs a class into speaking with people and customer etiquette. Icing on the cake 20% was included on the tip. So apparently they don't care about customer service since they know they're getting the tip. I didn't have it in me to argue.I left in a horrific mood which never happens to me post eating and drinking. Monroe's did that to me. Do not go!! Such a horrible experience all around. The one bright spot was the lovely employee who did not speak English and helped us adjust the umbrella that kept falling on us. He deserves all the praise and was so friendly and accommodating! He is why I gave one star.
2020-09-01,2,While the food at Monroe's was super good, their service was not. Our waiter kept coming over to us to tell us we only had a few mins left until we had to leave even when all our food wasn't on the table yet, we felt so rushed (on a night that wasn't even busy, majority of the tables were empty) We even ordered a hookah that took 30 mins to come out so we didn't understand how they expected us to just rush through our food and hookah when they were the ones taking long. -- once our friend came who knew the waiter personally, she never mentioned the time limit again which was so annoying because it just showed how when it's people she knew the "rules" didn't apply.
2020-09-01,3,Tasty food/drinks were good, and the service was alright. The music was extremely loud, it was barely 2pm on a Sunday. I asked if we could be moved because we were sitting directly under the sun and at first the girl told me there was nothing she could do about that but then she figured it out. I appreciated that but she should have not told me she couldn't do anything about it before trying something out. Something that I did not like was the added gratuity on to our bill, it was just two of us and the 20% gratuity did not add up the total of our bill. With tax our total came to $79.99, the gratuity added as stated on the receipt was 20%- $15. I am sure they manually imputed the gratuity because clearly the math does not add up. I am super generous when it comes to gratuity but when it's imputed on a bill of only two parties and clearly inputted wrong, it makes me question what other shady stuff they're up to...
2020-08-30,1,Were really in a mood for hookah. Got there at 4pm on a Sunday. The hostess made us a reservation for 4:30pm which was fine. Waited by the water looking at the menu online and picked what I wanted to order. Came back at 4:30pm and got seated. They had my favorite hookah flavor, peach, on a  menu. However, the waitress told us they only had limited hookah flavors. So I had to order something else. I wanted to order the drink I picked and was told I can't do that and can only order from brunch menu which is served until 5pm. After looking over a brunch menu we decided we don't want eggs at 4:30 so we thought we can just smoke hookah and have drinks and wait until 5pm to order from regular menu (once brunch time is over). When the waitress came back she informed us that we can't just do hookah and drinks. We HAVE to order brunch or make a new reservation for 6pm and come back then. We just got up and left. Would be nice if all these weird timing and food ordering process would be mentioned online or by the hostess when we made reservation in a first place.
2020-08-27,5,Earlier this month was my first time dining at Monroe's and I already made plans to go back!!! This quickly became one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken and our waitress Z was AMAZING. When I go again I will seriously ask to be seated at one of her tables bc she was that awesome. The food is amazing and definitely unique -that's what I love about this place is you won't get this food anywhere else. We had the squid rings as an appetizer which were incredible (shared with about 4 people and there was plenty to go around) & the old flame special roll for dinner (again, absolutely delicious). Would definitely recommend this place!! Even the cocktails were superior!
2020-08-27,2,I wanted to like this place (- I had a reservation)and try out the food. But when I went the Music from the live DJ was so loud. it sounded like a club! I had to practically yell  at the waiter was 2 feet away (that was the only way she could hear me) was the music going to be this loud the whole day? She said yes. There was no way I could eat and enjoy good conversation without yelling. 3 hours later the place was packed and the music volume was still lower but still loud you would have to really exert yourself to just talk. Outdoor seating is great, if  I have to yell more over the music defeats the purpose of safe outdoor seating- covid can spread in airborne particles. Specially if you are speaking louder and sitting on the same table.
2020-08-23,3,When we got there, our group was sat in an extremely sunny area, although most of the other tables were covered with umbrellas. When we asked to move somewhere more shaded, the host told us there was nothing he could do. Although eating while sweating profusely, the prix fixe brunch was yummy and more than filling. The included karaffe very likely had only a splash of alcohol in it, although it was refreshing. When our server realized how hot the plates were (from baking in the sun, along with us), she had a busser BRING OVER AN UMBRELLA. It was that simple, so it was evident the host was just shady (pun intended). The service otherwise was great. However, beware, gratuity is included (even for a party of 3!). While we fully intended to tip well more than 20%, this not being communicated was also shady. Probably won't be back but I enjoyed my meal here.
2020-08-23,1,Waitress would not keep her mask on. When it was on it wasn't on properly. Many of the waitresses did the same thing which confused us. Additionally waited 57 minutes for our food and things were still missing when they came out yet we were still charged for them in the end. When I asked about the missing food the waitress said "oh should I cancel it? Everyone's waiting." Wouldn't come back! I suggest working with the staff on proper hygiene during a global pandemic. The only people who were practicing safe measures were the awesome bus boys, we appreciated them for that. Perhaps promote them to waiters?
2020-08-22,5,Our waitress Zuleima gave us excellent service. The food and drinks were great. Zuleima made our stay very amazing. Great overall service. Will definitely be coming back.
2020-08-22,5,Zuleima gave us the best customer service I couldn't ask for any other waiter. Very courteous and had a strong understanding of what was on the menu and gave us great recommendations. I would highly recommend her for any questions on may have for a great night out at Monroe's. Thank you Zuleima, I drove an hour away to come here and you made it worth it.
2020-08-22,5,Food was great drinks were great ! and our waitress Zuleima was amazing ! for sure coming back !
2020-08-20,5,Service was great!!! Food was wonderful !!! Would come again !!!  Gotta try the Spicy California Roll !!!! Ask for zulima
2020-08-20,5,Zuleima was the best waitress! First time here and she definitely had the best recommendation for sushi rolls  would definitely come back
2020-08-20,5,Loved this place! Z was great- even when the food took a little longer she came over to update us and made sure we knew how much longer it would be. The tacos are tiny but DELICIOUS and the sushi was amazing. Definitely will be coming back!
2020-08-20,5,Monroe's is a great spot!! Great sushi and very Covid friendly! Our waitress Z made the experience very enjoyable!
2020-08-20,5,Z was an amazing waitress. The sushi was incredible and the service was 10/10. Great social distancing. Highly recommend
2020-08-19,5,Such a pleasant experience at Monroe's! The menu is pretty wholesome so you get a great variety BUT needless to say that the sushi is the star here. Fresh & delicious. Our service was also top notch! Our server, Z, was an absolute sweetheart who took the time to actually chat with us (but not overbearing!) She was attentive and just overall a great addition to the Monroe team!l.
2020-08-15,5,My best friend recommended we go to Monroe's for her birthday celebration and we loved it! Our server Z was nothing but excellent the whole entire time! Making sure we were happy and had everything we wanted. She also made sure my best friend enjoyed her celebration! The drinks, sushi and hookah we amazing!! Can't wait to go back
2020-08-15,5,I highly recommend Monroe's! I happened to stumble upon this place when I was walking by one night and finally had the chance to try it out ! The atmosphere is a great vibe and our server made it even better ! Make sure you ask for Z! She exceeded all of our expectations and gave us recommendations and would constantly check up on us , super nice girl ! Not to mention the hookah was great ! Definitely going back to try out brunch make sure to give it a try!
2020-08-15,5,My God where do I begin!? Came here with my home girl a few times already and the experience is to die for! Not only is the food impeccable but the service and hospitality during these hard times is top notch. The staff is so attentive and detail oriented which makes this place one of a kind. Hands down to their sushi and Margaritas the best I've ever had so far!
2020-08-15,5,From the service, to the food, to the hookah... everything about Monroe's in Hoboken is fantastic! I recommend it to everyone I know and they say the same. The fusion sushi is absolutely amazing - I suggest the Mistress, you won't regret it - and the atmosphere is comfortable during these Co-vid times. On the weekends they have a brunch special and a DJ playing outdoors! Gives you a little sense of normalcy during these times.
2020-08-15,5,I absolutely love this place. The food, the atmosphere, the service is truly top notch. Their dinner menu is to die for and just recently tried their brunch and it did not disappoint! This is a truly hidden gem and I will continue coming back over and over!
2020-08-15,5,This is one of my favorite restaurants. I went for drinks on the soft opening night and fell in love. I love the entire menu, both food and drinks. The sushi is soooo good. I can't even choose what to highlight because I love it all. Their brunch is definitely worth a try. The atmosphere and theme of the restaurant is so unique. I mean who doesn't love Marilyn Monroe?! The staff are very attentive and friendly. And they have hookah, which is a plus. Overall this place is welcoming and you leave happy and satisfied.
2020-08-15,5,Monroe's is such a fun restaurant/lounge! The staff is super friendly, the food/drinks are amazing & let's not forget that this is the first spot in Hoboken to have hookah!! If you havnt yet tried this place you need to ASAP.
2020-08-15,5,My friends and I came to this restaurant last night and let me just tell you.. the outdoor seating is SO cute! When we walked up to the host stand (because we had a reservation and also called to confirm we were set for 8:30 and were told yes) the host told us that she actually never accepted/denied our reservation. She then proceeded to get a little nasty with the one waitress and told us that "she's sorry for her(the waitresses) mistake but she guesses she'll seat us anyway" now myself and my friends all work in hospitality so right off the bat, we knew that wasn't the right way to handle a situation. As soon as we sat down THATS when our reservation was denied because we got a text message at exactly 8:30 saying so. But we weren't going to let the hosts rudeness get in the way of our night so we sat down and was greeted by the MOST AMAZING waitress named Emma. She was extremely sweet and gave us the best service we could ask for. The bartender Ben is also phenomenal! We kept telling him to make whatever drinks he wanted and every single one was great! I am so happy we didn't let the first impression of the restaurant make us leave because both Emma and Ben made the experience so fantastic and we will strictly go back to see the both of them!
2020-08-14,2,Main issue with Monroes is the lack of masks and hygiene for the staff.  Our waitress repeatedly removed her mask when taking our order and even when it was on her nose was popped out the top. Took longer to get the drinks then it did the food. I'm actually still here waiting for my entree when my friends had already finished their food. Overall the food is okay - wings were good but the sauce wasn't great, tasted like a blend of franks red hot and kimchi.Drinks are also alright but nothing to brag about.
2020-08-14,4,I loved the atmosphere and the variety of types of food on here! The sushi was good, our drinks were great, timing was good, and our waitress was very friendly!I give it a 4 due to the manager. We ordered a medium burger and it came out with raw meet still inside. We like pink, but this meat was raw. Our waitress happily took it back but a few seconds later the manager came back with the plate in hand and stated that this is what we ordered and this is how a medium comes out. We stood with our decision that it was raw to us, and we would like it cooked more. She proceeded to 'inform' us that it's based off temperature and this is what a medium always looks like. Without arguing we still wanted it cooked more. She said she was able to take it back to, but that "for our future orders there, or in any other restaurant" that is what a medium looks like. I've ordered many medium burgers and none of them have come out RAW. Just an overall aggressive attitude making it award for both the waitress and us. On top of that she stood at a high top behind our table and sat on her phone smoking hookah blowing it into our table. Like I said- good place, not great management.
2020-08-12,4,Monroe's did a great job with the outdoor dining space! Tables are distanced appropriately and it's fully shaded for a hot summer day. We enjoyed all the rolls we ordered! The system they have for taking down orders seemed to be a little disorganized but could have just been an off day- one waiter would take down drinks, another waitress would ask if we ordered our drinks, that same waitress would take down our food order, the waiter would come back with the drinks and asked if we ordered our food etc. But overall great ambiance, friendly service, and loved our outdoor dining experience!
2020-08-07,5,Came across this spot this weekend and what a nice surprise! The patio was perfect especially during quarantine, they had great sushi rolls (who would've thought) but the overall vibe was my favorite. Unlike a few of the "bro" bars in Hoboken, this place was perfect for hanging with friends and GREAT cocktails. I got the Cool as a Cucumber drink and it was light, refreshing and not too sweet; def recommend if you like gin.
2020-08-07,5,Stopped by this little known gem on a Friday night. The patio is beautiful and perfect for a date night setting or a Nice Sunday funday out in town. I've read a few reviews complaining about the long wait time for drinks. But anyone who actually knows about craft cocktails know it's not as simple as pouring a jack n coke so we didn't mind the extra wait especially since the place was so packed. I got the "Hbkn Smash" which was fruity and refreshing but still packed a punch with the bourbon. My girlfriend got "The Butterfly Effect" which comes with a whole show and dance at the table. We stuck to the sushi rolls which were mouthwatering and out of this world. Everything made fresh to order and it shows. Overall had a great experience and will definitely be back!!! Show support to your local businesses during these trying times
2020-08-06,3,Cute outdoor area but terrible service.  Took 20 minutes to get a drink and over an hour to get our food (we were only a table of 3).  Think they are understaffed and all would be fixed if they just added more staff (refill my water please!).  The waitress told us both the bartender and sushi chef were very busy so that was why everything took a ridiculous amount of time.  They also had someone walk inside without a mask and she walked by 3 staff, made it all the way to the back of the restaurant, and then was told to go get a mask.  This really bothered me - she should have been stopped at the door or by one of the 3 staff she walked by.  Food was average - wouldn't say it was necessarily worth the wait.  Sorry, Monroe's!
2020-08-04,5,Had to say, it's my first time dinning post-covid, looking forward to eating and lounging out. Monroe's met my expectations and more. The Hookah and service was just extraordinary, not only because of the nice ambience but mainly the service. My server, Zulina (Z) who was by far the most on point, friendly individual I met. She kept connected with her customers evenly and often enough but yet where it's not too much!  Just something I look for and promote in a restaurant. Definitely a spot to visit. Hookah is good!
2020-08-02,3,Went for $36 prefix brunch. It comes with a Karaffe of your choice. I ordered a mimosa. This drink did not have alcohol in it. I asked the waitress to go light on the orange juice but she reported they were premade. Basically you're getting orange juice and water? Possibly a splash of champagne? Otherwise the food was delicious. Definitely will be returning to try their dinner fusion options. The server was very attentive and the outdoor decor was "insta-worthy"
2020-08-02,1,It's a beautiful looking place. This was my first and last time coming to this cocktail bar.. The prices seem reasonable but the drinks were so water down with so much ice. It was terrible. We order a pitcher of the blond margaritas and it was like drinking a pitcher of lemonade. Even the capton and coke was watered down that my fiance ordered. The rose fries are gross. The fries was really mushy, soggy and cold in the center of them. We also ordered the Calamari which was also soggy and cold. I thought the choice of sauces with it didn't really go with the Calamari. Also the service was lame. The waiter wasnt friendly. We felt like they were rushing us to finish fast even though there was a 90 min time. They took our pitcher off our table when we didn't even finish it. And when we complained about the food the waiter did not say one word to me. The waiter even try to charge us extra for something we didn't get. This was the worst place in Hoboken. I rather have the old restaurant that was there before. This place sucks so bad.
2020-07-30,1,I went to this restaurant in July and it was a less than ideal situation. It took about 20 minutes for us to get our first drinks. I went with a small group. We ordered appetizers and entree at the same time. The calamari was bad and heavily fried. It came with dipping sauce of mustard, ketchup and spicy mayo (wtf?). The edamame was decent. I ordered a burger and the others ordered sushi. I got my meal about 10 minutes after the apps. The others did not get sushi until 60 minutes later. I expected the sushi to be shortly following my burger. As a polite person would do, I waited. We tried to order various drinks during this waiting period but we were told numerous times that they did not have the ingredients to make the various drinks. Things like a kamikaze shot, green tea shot, two different signature drinks they had on their menu, limes (at all). Not sure what restaurant doesn't have limes. We very politely were wondering why the sushi was taking very long and the manager told us the sushi chefs appendix just burst. I guess that was a very unfortunate circumstance. Either way, nothing was worth going to this restaurant. Don't.
2020-07-21,2,Heard about this place for sometime now & wanted to check it out. It has a beautiful eating set up outside with enough space to follow social distancing rules. Food was delicious (edamame, fried squid, lava cakes). Unfortunately the place is severely understaffed & it will have you waiting for a longggg period of time for things. Sooo, if you're hungry please bring snacks in your purse lol. If you're inpatient I wouldn't suggest going right now, especially in this heat. Or order everything in one shot.
2020-06-25,5,I went to wine and dine by myself and got the best experience thus far as a single wine and diner. I recommend this place for date night and girls night. It is appropriately sourced for both accommodations. I loved the food and drinks I cannot wait to come back here. Also do not forget the Palo Alto smudge when you go into the restrooms
2020-06-13,5,While both the food and service were excellent, the Friday night band was SO loud that we literally could not have a conversation throughout our dinner, making it NOT an ideal place to meet to catch up with friends. Our throats literally hurt from having to scream over the music to speak all night. It was only 7:30pm! Monroe's desperately needs to sound check but otherwise the menu was great and has potential to be fun. UPDATE: since our first time, we have ordered Monroe's pretty much every Friday during quarantine, and must say that they have been truly great. They are delicious, creative, and we genuinely enjoy the food so much. We love the sushi and appetizers. Definitely worth checking out for delivery!
2020-06-12,5,This place is off the hook! The food is orgasmic!! The sushi is unlike I've ever experienced. The buffalo chicken wings are beyond words with the blue cheese garlic dressing. It's a marriage made in heaven! Every single person in Hoboken and Jersey city should have the privilege to taste the delicacies of Monroe's. Ask for Argenis, he's a champ!
2020-05-14,4,I needed sushi last week! Like was on a mission but was nervous about quality- Monroes didn't disappoint! I ordered directly from their website (as many 3rd party are taking profits) and called to ask them to modify something and the manager couldn't have been nicer! She assured me everything was fresh and noted not to add salt to the fries. I offered feedback in adding a comments section to their site when checking out to avoid calls and she mentioned it was a new platform and appreciated my suggestion. I ordered Rose Fries ( they are very thick steak fries, not what I was expecting), 2 role combo: My Sushi Romance & Dilemma (very good) and a spicy California roll! Rolls were generous and packed perfectly. They included a side of soy sauce and chopsticks which I appreciated! I didn't see any brown rice options or no-rice rolls? But I would recommend if you really need your fix! Hope they do well and happy to support!
2020-03-30,5,Honestly the best restaurant in Hoboken.  I went when they first opened and the ambient is so lavish,The food is amazing and the service is outstanding, everyone was so friendly , and now during this hard time when all the restaurants are closed Monroe's team has the best and fast delivery service I've ever had. is awesome that you can have the Monroe's experience in your house as well.
2020-03-30,5,Never disappoints! The service is wonderfully refreshing, the ambience is delightful. They're offering take out and delivery service during these terrible times where businesses can no longer be open to the public. So I encourage everyone to order for delivery or pick up, because these small businesses are the ones that matter the most. Especially when they're great!
2020-03-30,5,I heard about this restaurant via a friend who said they were delivering during quarantine. I live 23 miles away from Monroe's and they still came and delivered to me! The food and cocktails were delicious! The customer service was beyond my expectations. ( they even added free shots as a thank you) Once we get through this pandemic I will definitely be dining here in person. 10 stars!
2020-03-24,5,You can't go wrong with anything on the menu everything is absolutely delicious! The "Me steak love" is so tender and juicy and the "lost love" sushi dish is  execellent!
2020-02-24,4,This Is a new place, me and some friends tried it today for lunch. The menu is options aren't much, and they have a buffet style lunch which was good but didn't offer many healthy options. Will like to come back and try the drinks and hopefully they'll add more to the menu. Overall I liked the space and ambiance.
