2021-09-20,5,Our favorite sushi spot in Hoboken! The owner and staff are amazing and we love the food.
2021-09-10,5,Was pleasantly surprised with this place, considering there was a fair amount of negative reviews. My friends and I (group of 4) went on a Friday night and were immediately seated. It's a very small place but felt pretty cozy. There were plastic films placed in between each table, which contained hand sanitizer, and the staff were all masked. The wait for food wasn't long at all.I ordered the sashimi platter (regular) while my friend ordered the sashimi appetizer. They're both the same, but the platter just has more pieces. Both contain salmon, tuna, and yellowtail on top of shredded cabbage. The tuna came with a light soy glaze while the yellowtail came with eel sauce and spicy mayo (we think).  The sashimi platter came with a salad but you can also opt for miso soup. The waitress forgot to give us some complimentary rice but gave us some later. The salad consists of lettuce and cucumbers dressed in a ginger sauce (again, we think).The salad was delicious, with the ginger sauce adding a nice hit of sourness. The sashimi was very good and tasted quite fresh. The soy glaze on the tuna wasn't too overpowering and added a nice hint of sweetness, while retaining the tuna flavor. The yellowtail, some would say, was smothered in sauce. That being said, it tasted very sweet and very good and mixing it with some rice was nice. No complaints with the salmon, it was just great salmon, no flaws there. Finally, can't go wrong with steamed rice.I would say, it was kinda pricey but this is a nice, cozy splurge spot just off of Washington. The food meets your expectation and hopefully goes beyond. Looking forward to my next visit.
2021-06-09,1,Food taste is not good. Prices are very not good. The spicy dumpling soup is tasteless dumplings in tasteless broth. Should cost $3 or $4, not $11. The Ubu Roll isn't good.... Tasteless. Also, they aren't honest, as there is no crab inside.
2021-06-03,1,Worst sushi I've had in a long time. Rice is over cooked and soggy, fish is warm and terrible quality. I got a soondubu soup and it was the worst thing I've ever had. It was tasteless cold and disgusting.
2021-04-24,5,Their food is great, service is wonderful. Great spot, deserves more positive attention!
2021-03-30,3,Typical Hoboken fushi but will somewhat satisfy the sushi craving if you are in a pinch. I ordered for pickup on a Monday evening and I got there a little early but didn't have to wait too long until my order was ready. I just had the Fivestar roll (tuna, salmon, yellow tail, white fish, crab, avocado, cucumber and spicy sweet sauce). It wasn't bad but it was a little bit too saucy for me. I think if I order again, I would probably just stick to the regular rolls, without all the sauces.
2020-12-10,2,Got the ugly roll and spicy tuna. Ugly roll is misleading, it sounds just like a rainbow roll,  since it is a california roll with different types of fish on top, but you actually get something really different. Its a california roll with like a weird fish poke salad instead of sashimi pieces like a rainbow roll. I did not enjoy this at all, the fish weren't soft and the sauce tasted odd.I also got the spicy tuna, which is my favourite roll, and could not even finish, i got no tuna flavour and instead had some odd spiciness that i dont usually get with spicy tuna. I would suggest Robongi, illuzion, yeung or ayame! Those 4 are the way to go, sorry! :(
2020-10-01,3,Not worth it, in my opinion. It's hard to tell if they can't make tasty food or just prepare Japanese dishes in a different manner - perhaps more Korean style? Not sure. E.g. for the age tofu, they use teriyaki sauce and it is served dry, without the dashi (broth). The ramen is overcooked. I ordered miso and it was tasteless with a few pieces of broccoli, half of a boiled egg and some tiny pieces of tofu. The only sushi I ate was an appetizer. It had some unnecessary dressing (mayo or soy sauce) and some of the fish was extra stringy. Overall, just not worth it on any level.
2020-08-11,5,We finally found a great sushi and Korean food spot in Hoboken! The prices are unbeatable - perfect for lunch or a weeknight dinner. They have a cute outdoor dining space with tables that are actually 6 feet apart (unlike many places in Hoboken) and a nice tarp for shade. Service was quick, attentive, and very nice! Their menu has a lot of great gems and a huge list of special rolls. The two of us shared 4 special rolls and a hwe dup bap (Korean sushi over rice dish) and the food was very fresh and delicious. The hwe dup bap was SO refreshing and really hit the spot on hot summer night. We will be back again for sure!
2020-07-30,5,I just moved and tried every sushi spot in Hoboken and this spot has the freshest sushi... and I'm very tough on sushi spots. Won't eat there unless it's the real deal. The customer service is also phenomenal. Family owned and very caring. The spicy tuna salad is a must!
2020-03-07,5,This is my favorite sushi place in Hoboken. Really good sushi. The fish tasted really fresh. Not overpriced. The owner is really nice. Definitely a good place to share a meal or a drink with a date or friends or family. It has a cozy hole in the wall ambience.
2020-02-15,1,Bad experience! First time ordering (for pickup) & the gentlemen was extremely rude on the phone. Disregarded that problem because i Wanted my sushi so baddd! I Went to pick up and he was just having a rough day *i guess* but he was sooooo f****** rude! And didn't wanna give me extra soy sauce even after i offered money for extra sauce. Come on brother lighten up! The worst thing for me is the experience at a restaurant with the employees! Your food could be amazing but the service here sucks!
2020-02-02,5,Stopped in for dinner last night with my wife.  It's clean and the service is good.  Ubu is conveniently located on Hudson near 3rd.  We both had a couple of rolls that very fresh and Miso Soup which is always a  good choice.  We threw in an order of dumplings and that completed our meal.  The beets part is the price total cHeck was $35 and thats good for Hoboken in my opinion.  If your a BYOB type person there is a $18 minimum purchase policy which is reasonable.  We will definitely go back
2020-01-04,5,Please please please go and eat at Ubu!!!! My boyfriend and I just finished eating dinner there and the service and food were impeccable. It's a small, intimate restaurant and the sushi is out of this world. Our server was an absolute gem who even gave us a complimentary dish to try. We will 1000% be coming back here!!
2019-12-27,5,Very unassuming place, but has become one of my go to places for a quick meal for sure. My friend had the tofu soup and thought it was great. Probably the most reasonable prices for sushi in the area, and great quality. Awesome service. Come by for no gimmicks sushi that won't disappoint.
2019-05-23,5,This place has the best sashimi  I have ever eaten anywhere.   We go to NYC 4 or 5 times a year.  We make a point of heading over to Hoboken to eat at Ubu every single time.  The owner is very pleasant and gracious.  Can't wait to get back up there!
2019-04-25,5,Delicious sushi! Quality fish! Super friendly owner and staff. Lots of variety and choices here. Space a is a bit cozy, but food quality is high!
2019-04-04,1,Horrible place. Owner refused us because we had two strollers. The place was empty. It was 1:45pm. He didn't even try to accommodate us.
2019-02-25,5,Love this place. I have eaten here many times and today was just fantastic. Top notch service as well.
2019-02-01,5,I've tried sushi from a lot of different places in the area near my work, but the one I keep going back to is Ubu. The salmon/tuna rolls are quality and taste fresh. The owner is a very nice guy who is always courteous to me every time I visit. This is an old school sushi place, so don't expect anything fancy, but the food quality is there.I was waffling between giving this a 4 or a 5, but I think the 5 is warranted due it being a step above other sushi places in the area.
2019-01-09,4,Came here on Friday with a buddy of mine and it definitely hit the spot. We just got out of work and decided to try Ubu out. We walked in and it was a small and empty place. Only 2 other people came the entire time we were there which I was surprised for a Friday night. We started off with some sushi rolls which were pretty decent in terms of quality. We each ordered ramen next. I got the pork ramen. The broth was pretty flavorful and had a milky look to it. Was very happy with the broth, ramen, and seasoning. My one complaint was there were just 2 small pieces of pork. Our server was great, he wasn't pushy and came at exactly the right times. I was overall satisfied with the service, ambiance, and food. Will be back
2018-11-29,5,This place is awesome.. The sushi rolls are delicious .. Dream II is amazing and they are cheap. Jay is absolutely precious and he gave us free ice cream ! The service is great, the food is amazing and its def an underrated sushi spot in hoboken. If you want delicious affordable sushi this is the place to go.
2018-08-21,3,Come here for the soon do bu (spicy tofu soup dish)! Funny enough, although this is a Japanese restaurant, my favorite dish is a Korean dish. Hoboken is definitely lacking in the Korean restaurants so it's nice they have this dish here. Honestly not a fan of the sushi here, the portions aren't too big and the quality is not quite there. The prices are decent though so if you want a quick meal at a decent price, drop by here!
2018-08-17,5,Update: came here half a dozen times over the past month. Sometimes eating in and sometimes getting take out. Service is so wonderful! And always good!! Best place I've had in Hoboken.
2018-07-27,1,Terrible. Ordered from here on GrubHub. The delivery man never showed up. It's been two hours as of now. We called 30 minutes ago and the guy said "he left a long time ago, he should be there soon" and was rushing to get us off the phone without an explanation. 30 minutes later, nobody has shown up and they no longer will answer their phones, meanwhile they aren't supposed to close for another half hour. Unreal.
2018-07-03,1,Ordered delivery through Seamless and not only was the delivery more than an hour late, they told Seamless that the food was delivered when, in fact I declined to accept sushi one hour late in 90 degree heat. When I called the restaurant to inquire about the delivery, they were rude and hurried me away with "driver should be there soon".
2018-05-20,5,Great food and service!We were here on a Saturday afternoon. Place was quite and we got our food quickly. Fantastic server and we will be back for more!
2018-05-01,5,Absolutely one of my best dinning place in Hoboken/Jersey city area for Asian food. The food is not just tasty but also makes me feeling at home. Service is so good not saying the free tofu cake and ice cream!!!
2018-04-11,5,My favorite place to get ramen in Hoboken. The service is great and they will always bring you something "on the House". Nothing can compare to the way they make you feel like family not a customer. Always a warm welcome and a warm goodbye!
2018-03-30,1,AWFUL DELIVERY, RUDE RESTAURANTI had never before experienced such a horrible experience as I did with ordering Ubu. I ordered off grubhub and my food came one hour after the estimated arrival time. I understand that sometimes restaurants get busy or streets have traffic, but I called Ubu and was concerned when the own restaurant was shocked that my food had not arrived. They had no idea where the delivery person was and instead blamed it on the delivery company they used. I had to call a second time, again no explanation and it was the delivery company's fault. When my food finally came an hour later, there was an item missing and I called Ubu requesting a refund due to this and due to the restaurant having no idea where my food was for the past hour. Instead of siding with the customer, the restaurant yelled at me on the phone when I requested a refund, denied items being missing, and then hung up on me. I had to call grubhub in order to get my refund back and was told by the grubhub representative that the restaurant did not give her an easy time. The restaurant also denied using a delivery company and apparently they had their own delivery guy. Their stories do not even match up. It is not okay when a restaurant has no idea where a delivery person is for an hour. How can they expect a customer to feel safe consuming food that has been unaccounted for over an hour?
2018-01-30,3,Other reviews are accurate. Service is very friendly and that is a plus. The prices are reasonable. The fish is so so and a bit skinny. We received 2 tofu skin sushi on the house. We will come back again but to try the ramen.
2017-12-11,1,WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE!Let me start off by saying..if you see all of my other reviews, I'm usually on Yelp giving positive feedback as I work in customer service, and know how IMPORTANT it is to appreciate the good experiences you have! On the contrary..this place was so horrendous that it has forced me to WARN others. I arrived here at 12:25pm. I figured I could grab something quick at a sushi joint as they are usually pretty fast with service. I ordered BEEF TERIYAKI. It got to be 12:55, still no food, which was completely okay since I understand it's lunch and gets busy. I kindly asked for my food to-go as I was in a rush to get to work. I pay, LEAVE A TIP, and rush out the door.When I go to unpack my food I realize that what I received was something I DID NOT ORDER! It looked and smelled disgusting. I had no idea what it was. When I got a minute, I ran back down to the restaurant (meanwhile I'm also 6 months preggo!!). I go in and I say "excuse me I was in earlier and my order is incorrect" the man looks at me puzzled. I go "I ordered beef teriyaki and I'm not sure what this is" he then thinks it's in his best interest to berate me in his establishment where others are eating! "YOU ORDERED DICED BEEF!!!!" Yelling at me. I go "No I ordered beef teriyaki" he then goes "diced beef, beef teriyaki big difference!!" UH YEAH YOU THINK?!!!!!! He keeps repeating himself and at this point we are both yelling at each other and I needed to get back to my job! He offers NOTHING, not to correct my order (DON'T YOU THINK THE CUSTOMER KNOWS WHAT THEY ORDERED?!!!!?), not to refund me for the dog food they pawned off on me, not an apology for yelling at me and publicly embarrassing me...NOT A THING!!!! So $15 later, and I had throw out the inedible crap they wouldn't take back. The most UNPROFESSIONAL establishment in Hoboken!!! Best part is I work in town with hundreds of people who live here..so don't think they won't know about this experience too.
2017-12-09,5,This is my first time eating at this restaurant and I was impressed by their exceptional service. My fiancé and I ordered the Chirashi bowl and Soon dubu and they were delicious. We sat by the bar and we saw how meticulous the sushi chef was when preparing our dish. This is definitely a place we will visit again!
2017-09-16,1,Rat droppings in food!! I called and they said "okay we'll refund only the food with droppings." Then they said " Hurry up, I don't want to to talk to you anymore." Are they nuts? I promptly called seamless, and then the health inspection office. If you want to get sick, then this is the place for you.
2017-08-24,3,We were trying all the sushi places in Hoboken and I really wanted to like this place. Its atmosphere is cozy and the owner is super nice. Unfortunately, the sushi was not the freshest. We had the fish bowl, spicy lobster roll, and a Dream 2 special roll. The fish bowl was great and the portion was huge for the price. The spicy lobster roll tasted fresh as well, however, the rice was mushy, not like regular sushi rice at all. The most disappointing, however, was the special Dream 2 roll. The spicy tuna on top did not taste fresh and has a dull red color (also confirm it wasn't the freshest). We didn't finish all the pieces because we didn't want to risk getting sick (we didn't, thankfully). All in all, I'd recommend coming here for the Korean dishes, like the Fish bowl and maybe even the ramen. However, there are definitely better sushi options in the area.
2017-08-16,5,I just finished eating a meal at Ubu and I am impressed by their friendly staff and the food is delicious. They have a variety of food and they give you a nice little drink after you eat. Also they gave me a complimentary sushi while I waited for my meal. Very nice experience. I recommend this sushi place.
2017-06-20,5,We absolutely LOVE this little hole in the wall. There's only 1 type of broth ramen and it's a bone broth and DELICIOUS. We have brought our out of town friends here and they love it too! Good for sushi if you're feeling an appetizer or dinner. They always have sushi specials. Their ramen runs around $11 (good price if you know your ramen). It is BYOB. The older Japanese man is the only waiter (and presumably the owner) and his smile makes you smile :-) It's just overall a really wonderful local joint!
2017-04-28,3,This place was pretty decent and I don't really have anything negative to say about it, other than the fact that there's nothing special about it. Just your usual run of the mill New Jersey sushi place. Nothing amazing nor terrible. The sushi rolls are reasonably fresh. The chef (and possibly owner) is really friendly and the service was great.
2017-03-15,1,sushi was very bad, didnt hold together well and the fish did not taste fresh. It looked like an amateur rolled it. The tempura shrimp/vegetables were awful. We got 2 pieces of avocado and 2 shrimp.  The specialty roll had a fishy smell to it. It just was not a quality meal and will not be back.
2017-02-18,4,Not a bad cozy place in Hoboken. It was my first time visiting this place with bunch of friends. One of them had been there for 10 years. The waiter was very friendly. I had the spicy tofu soup with seafood. My husband got pork ramen and yellowtail sashimi + salmon roll. I definitely had fun and enjoyed the food. Like other Korean places, you would get the yogurt drink at the end of the meal.
2017-02-15,5,This little restaurant is amazing. The service is phenomenal and the food is always fresh. If your ever in need of some good sushi come here. Plus it is BYOB, you can not go wrong.
2017-01-15,4,I've been to ubu a few times and the service and food is always consistent. Ubu is very low key which is a great change of pace. The fish is always fresh and you really can't go wrong with trying anything on the menu. My favorite is the salmon and tuna rolls. This is a smaller operation and the staff are amazingly attentive.I love the mom and pop feel and if you do too stop by here.
2017-01-09,5,Delicious fresh sashimi. Seared fish sushi also good as was the salmon teriyaki and tuna maki. A small, quiet place with a friendly owner/manager. BYOB. We'll come here again next time we're in Hoboken.
2016-12-10,5,Yum yum yum I love the seared sushi. It's a good place for dinner. The sushi and the fish are very fresh. The food in general is super good. The service is great too!
2016-11-23,5,Really terrific food and terrific service.Japanese food made by Japanese people.Really tasty and looks good!Have to try!
2016-08-20,5,My favorite sushi place around. My food is always fresh. I've been a customer for over 6 years and I've always been more than satisfied. The place is BYOB so it's a great place to wine and dine.
2016-07-16,4,Me and my friends were only in town for the weekend and happened to stumble across this place because we were staying in the hotel down the street. Absolutely loved it! The employees were welcoming and beyond sweet! Plus the prices weren't bad at all, definitely someplace you should try! It's a smaller place that only seats 25 or so but we will be back here the next time were in town!
2016-06-03,5,This place is nice, small and quiet. Service is good. Enjoyed Soon Doo Boo and Dadaki a lot. Can eat them every day.
2016-04-26,1,Very disappointing that I ordered a spicy scallop roll and they tried to pass off a spicy "imitation" crab instead. When I called them out on it they tried to tell me their spicy scallop roll is mixed with imitation crab. Of course I referred them to the menu that does not mention this anywhere.
2016-04-01,4,This is my go to place for food when in hoboken. Its small, but comfy . Food is fresh, and its quick. Good prices. Can't complain
2015-11-23,1,The rice is not very good, which is a very important component for a well made sushi. And i was charged for 6.5 bucks, for a 5.5 dish on menu. Wont go there for a second time.
2015-11-13,4,They do some things really well.  Their fish bowl which in Korean is called hwe dup bap is really good, always hits the spot and it's healthy and got a generous amount of sashimi.  Their sushi quality is above average and the price reasonable. I would definitely pick this place over sushi lounge which isn't too far away.
2015-10-29,5,owners are from Korea and so nice people. I like fish bowl but it's cold . Tofu soup is also delicious, I usually go there when I taking path. But it close early sometime
2015-09-17,4,One of my favorite sushi joint in Hoboken!  This is owned by an older Korean gentleman and it's a hole in the wall.  I love their fish bowl which is hwe dup bap (Korean version of Chirashi).  If you are feeling adventurous, try to spicy ugly special roll! Note: Hoboken sushi joints are less to be desired compared to it's neighboring towns such as NYC and Edgewater.
2015-09-06,1,This review is based solely on the extremely slow service, and the lunch sashimi plate that was enough to feed a toddler and consisted of thinly sliced, poor quality fishPass
2015-08-01,4,I have definitely had better sushi in Hoboken but I love the little 'hole in the wall' feeling this place offers.  We had the shrimp tempura appetizer which was a pretty big portion for the price (4 pieces).  We shared a few different roles-all average in taste and nothing special.  What I loved most about Ubu was the adorable waiter who was so friendly and attentive.  He had a smile on his face the entire time and I really just wanted to kidnap him.Good experience, meh food.
2015-07-27,5,Really nice place for casual meals, I go there at least once a week. The food quality is consistently good. My favorite dishes are ugly spicy roll, tofu stew, eel don and free ice cream. :)
2015-05-20,5,I like this place. One of the first places my bf brought me to in jersey. Everyone there is really nice and their rolls are pretty good. Just a nice, quiet atmosphere. Good for dates.
2015-04-14,5,Friendly service. Consistently good quality sushi. No-frills & down-home restaurant. My go-to for the past year and a half for the lunch special. A great local business to support.
2015-02-04,5,This is my only go-to sushi place in Hoboken.  We try other places to branch out and are always disappointed that we missed out on going to Ubu.   We go every single week.First off, we LOVE Jay (the owner).  He's so nice and makes us feel special every time we go in.  He has our order memorized and he starts working on our rolls right away.I'm very particular about my sushi...I don't like the rolls too big or over the top.  The menu at Ubu has a great mix of rolls and you get a good amount of food.   My favorite roll is the Rainbow II.  His basic rolls are reasonably priced and his specialty rolls are unique with plenty of options.  My boyfriend likes Red Rock, Valentine's Roll.  Dumpling Soup is perfect during the winter.If you're looking for your new favorite hole in the wall sushi place, this is it.  Ubu is unique to the other sushi places in town (not a lounge, no dark lighting, etc) and you know you can get a good meal here.
2014-12-18,4,I've been going for 5 years now and I enjoy it. The food is delicious and the people are polite.
2014-12-11,5,I order from here everyweek my favorite delivery spot! I love their fish bowl- consistently amazing two thumbs up. And gyoza is a great addition. Delivery is fast on time and the delivery staff and chef is friendly- even by phone.
2014-09-29,3,I have been coming here for years its my go to spot for sushi and Japanese dishes. Definitely recommend anyone to try this place. I have brought many people who either never tried sushi or didn't like it once they had the volcano roll they were instantly changed. I have never found another place that does the volcano roll quite like here. It's BYOB and the atmosphere is very homely the cook and server are very friendly.
2014-07-06,2,I feel awful posting this but wanted to in case others have had this experience.  Used to love, love love UBU- quiet, friendly service, low key, good sushi.  However the last 2 times we have been here me or my husband has gotten unbelievably ill a few hours after dining.  Both times we had the dirty ugly spicy special- maybe the name of it says it all.
2014-06-21,4,Best sushi in Hoboken that I have ever had. The fried ebi was cooked to perfect crisp. The UGLY GIRL roll is the best and I always get it on the side of my meal. They make sushi right in front of you and always bring you piping hot tea, but you have to request it first. The ladies are very nice and accommodating to the point where you feel like you're in a fine dining place. The miso soup is from a dry-powder pouch and isn't that great nor is the salad. But always for the sushi.
2014-06-15,2,The sushi itself is fantastic, but seriously, don't order from or sit down at this place unless you have a good amount of time. We waited for 45 minutes for our food when there were 4 parties seated at the place; one table with four people and the other three, including us, were couples. The four-person table next to us had their entrees (each ordered their own plate, not sharing) delivered 10-15 minutes apart. When we got our food, we really liked it, but were still really disappointed by the wait. I've also ordered takeout and had the same issue. They said 10 minutes, I gave them 20, the place was nearly empty and my 2 rolls were still not ready. Went home to wait and was back 10 minutes later and still waited another 10 minutes. The sushi isn't any better than what you get across the street. I'd rather pay more at Sushi Lounge than spend so much time waiting!
2013-10-07,2,Still trying to expand my Hoboken lunch horizons. After hrs of trying to figure out what type of food I was in the mood for, I decided on Japanese. Then it was off to Yelp for some searching. Came across Ubu. The reviews weren't too bad so I figured what the hell! Sadly, I was not in the mood for sushi. Instead I opted for the shumai and beef udon soup--big mistake. The shumai was...basic shumai. I'm pretty sure I've never a "good" or "bad" shumai. I think everyone gets them from the same place. That udon doe... It may have been the most flavorless broth I've ever tasted. The only "taste" I got from it was from the oil that also happened to be clearly visible. The meat inside--zero flavor. The broccoli and string beans (really weird in a soup)--zero flavor. I was highly disappointed. Perhaps I will go back and try their sushi, since that's what most reviews are about. Though when it comes to bad reviews, I'm usually a 1 and done. The Yelp might be changing that though.
2013-09-07,4,Saturday around lunch time, we sat outside since the weather was really nice. We were the only customers, but the waitress wasn't very attentive. Good deals for combos. no lunch specials but the same menu all day. We were able to substitute different sushi rolls in our combos. Our food was brought out really slowly, especially considering we were the only people there. The amount of wasabi and ginger they give you for three rolls is a little sad though. The price is great. I'll be back still. Conveniently close to my apartment
2013-08-27,4,Small family run place. Sushi is always fresh and well worth. Small place and usually  a two person operation .  Service is always friendly and they accommodate what you want. Forget the trendy tourist traps in Hoboken. When in the mood for good shushi Ubu is the place to be.
2013-07-23,2,Food was good; service was insulting.  No need to come back here.
2013-05-03,1,I had eaten here a few times back in the day and the food/experience was decent.  (Probably around 2006-2007)  I ordered delivery from Ubu last night and WOW what a change in quality & service.  I called my order in at approx 7:45 and paid by credit card.  I asked for the total and the guy on the phone said "Im busy, we will call you back".  About 40 minutes passed and No callback.  I called back to ask for the total again..and to see if they had sent out my order.  He said the order left already and should be delivered within the next 10 minutes.  Another 30 minutes passed and I was about to call back to cancel my order when the buzzer finally rang.  It was now after 9pm.  Over an hour and fifteen minutes to deliver my order (i only live a few blocks from the restaurant).We opened the bag that's when the real disappointments began. First...the salads were literally nothing but lettuce and a container of ginger dressing.  No tomato, no cucumber, no carrot.  Just brown lettuce.  We ordered the Oyako-don rice bowl.  It's supposed to come with grilled chicken, stir-fried vegetables, egg, and brown sauce over rice.  I opened the container and it was ground up, rubbery, dry chicken over white rice and nothing else.  Not one single vegetable.  I took a picture and added it to yelp as proof.  I was shocked at how carelessly it was prepared.  We ordered miso soup that came with almost no tofu and no seaweed.  The tuna roll we ordered had almost no fish inside it, and was very loosely rolled so it was falling apart.  Between the carelessness, length of time we waited, and overall poor quality of the food..i wont be eating at Ubu again.
2013-04-27,1,Good food, Beyond terrible service!Everything seemed okay until we paid. I even thought the food and service were better than Robongi for a second.However, when the waitress brought our credit card back, she told us that people were waiting in line.Once we paid, we didn't have any reasons to stay sitting there any longer, so you didn't have to say anything to kick us out.Watch out, Hoboken moms! Especially if you have a baby, this place is terrible. Yes, we took our baby with us. This doesn't mean we took longer to eat. The chatty customers who were already eating there when we walked in had left not that long before we paid.
2013-04-24,1,Turned out to be the worst place in Hoboken. Been there over 50 times at least and the food is okay/good though it could get very slow. This owner has multiple personalities; you get good service and food when he's happy (i think most of the time THANK GOD) but there are times he's not happy, oh boy I almost wanted to call a cop on him the last time. He's been acting funny recently; he might need to see a doctor or something. Never going back. Never thought he could be such a rude/scare person. This restaurant should be closed down.
2013-02-16,3,I got a couple sushi rolls for lunch at Ubu last month and it was awesome, so I ordered dinner from there tonight. I got an avocado roll, which was awesome, and there was a salad and miso soup, which were okay (the salad dressing was crusty, I couldn't use it). But then, I opened my "beef teriyaki" and was absolutely horrified to find that it was just minute steaks (IE philly cheesesteak meat) with onions, and a side of rice, sprinkled with sesame seeds. So, stay away from that horrendous situation, stick with sushi and you'll be happy. What a let-down!!!!!!!
2013-02-15,5,Went there last night and food was fantastic!  We've tried just about every sushi place in Hoboken and Ubu is by far the best & freshest.  And the service was excellent too and even though it got very crowded, they didn't make us feel like we had to vacate our table.  Will be bringing my parents here...Dad is part Japanese and he hasn't liked any of the sushi places in town thus far.  He said Sushi Lounge was one of the worst and completely overpriced.
2013-01-02,5,Very prompt service. Fish are all year around fresh.Sushi are by far the best in town.And the price is very competitive
2012-12-08,5,This is hands down my favorite sushi place in Hoboken. Jay is the best! The fish is always great quality (both sushi and sashimi), and they have a nice menu of special rolls. I am partial to the spicy dadaki appetizer and spider, dragon and spicy white tuna/avocado rolls. This place is delightfully not a scene (go across the street to Sushi Lounge if that is what you want) and definitely one of those hidden gems worth checking out. Please do.
2012-12-01,4,I will always say yes to Ubu.  You must try the fish bowl.  It's a collection of various different fish combined with a delicious sauce that will guarantee to fill you up.  I will admit I was skeptical at first, but it is completely worth it.If you see the Ugly Spicy special, BUY IT.  It was an awesome arrangement of sushi cuts layered on top or a roll.  It certainly is ugly, it certainly is spicy, and it certainly is delicious.  All for $12!Ubu may be small and off the beaten path, but their sushi is worth every penny.
2012-09-22,4,Went here tonight for dinner and can say that the place is pretty top notch. The rolls are pretty dope and kindve make me look like forrest gump every time he runs into lieutenant dan. In fact not once did i feel like lieutenant dan everytime he runs into forrest gump. Because im unoriginal and fear change in the way that george clooney seems to fear commitment, i ordered the california roll (again, im unoriginal. i stress). The ingredients and the food tasted beyond fresh, with nothing seemingly sitting around for days on end looking for somebody to purchase it. Because the dude i was with is an idiot, he also ordered the california roll, and because we're both idiots, tried one anothers. I can sincerely state that his was top notch as well, and in fact at one point, because i'm an idiot, sortve wish i wouldve ordered the same dish. seeming to sense that i was paying with a credit card, they presented me at the beginning of the meal with two leadless pencils that i had a really difficult time signing my check with, and tipped the guy with two round holes that i hope is seven dollars.anyway, if you dont mind heeding the words of an idiot, check this place out. its great.
2012-08-19,2,Service wasn't that good. The sushi chef didn't come across friendly. The yellowtail sushi was good. Others than that, it wasn't impressive. Just another mediocre sushi place.
2012-07-09,3,I have eaten at this restaurant a bunch of times.  Each and every time the food was decent.  The fish has always been fresh and the staff is always friendly.  They load the hand rolls up with fish (more fish than rice.. which is a good thing).  The best thing about this place are is the price.  Normally when you get inexpensive sushi, the quality is low.  This place has high quality fresh fish and it wont hurt your pocket.  Note: This place is BYOB and they will happily open your bottles for you!My only issue is that they never have Sea Urchin even though it is on the menu.  But to be honest, I find this to be an issue at most smaller sushi restaurants.I will continue to frequent Ubu.
2012-04-04,2,My wife and I always walk by this place.  Last night, we finally gave it a shot with a takeout order.  We ordered the beef negimaki, spicy scallop roll, a sashimi platter, and some ikura sushi.  The beef negimaki was OK.  The teriyaki sauce it was in was missing 'something'.  The sashimi seemed like it was frozen, and the ikura sushi looked like it belonged in a Happy Meal; in other words, they were small.  However, the spicy scallop roll wasn't bad.  With all the other sushi joints around the area and in Jersey City, I don't think I'll be coming back to this one.
2012-01-31,1,Sorry Ubu...You guys have gone from pretty bad to REALLY bad. I know the rule of thumb: "don't order sushi on Mondays" but you know what? Sometimes I want sushi on a Monday...And I order it.  After a string of Robongi orders, I decided to re-try Ubu, expecting their dinner service to maybe beat out the lunch I had there.  No dice.  The salmon was brown-ish at the edges. Yep, it was so old and bad that it was discolored.  It went in the garbage.  Edamame was slightly frozen but dry but I ate it since I figured that was the only thing on my dinner plate that likely wouldn't get me sick. I figured right but dang, was I still hungry. Not exactly sure what's going on here at Ubu but I would rather order from one of those Chinese/Japanese/Thai/Malaysian/etc places I can't stand than risk a repeat of last night.
2012-01-25,4,This is my boyfriend and my favorite date-night place. Ubu is cozy, with a great selection and lovely atmosphere. Everything is always deliciously fresh. The Sushi Lounge is right across the street, and maybe that's the place to go if you're looking for bass-pumping music and overpriced drinks. But if you're looking for a BYOB restaurant where you can actually have a conversation with the person across from you, Ubu is the place.
2011-09-18,4,Great Sushi.Nice Lunch Bento type combo options.High quality food.
2011-08-05,2,Ubu needs to step their game up.I used to go there often considering that I work around the corner from the place. I also used to love it. It was affordable and yummy. I went there last night, though, and ordered the spicy tuna roll and it was gross. It tasted rotten. It has the rotten meat after taste. No wonder it was so cheap.I'd rather spend more money for quality sushi at Sushi Lounge across the street.
2011-07-22,4,Decent sushi in Hoboken. I recommend the chicken tempura rolls.
2011-05-15,2,Over the last few months, the quality of the sushi has been so inconsistent that I'm going to break my allegiance to Ubu and branch out.  Unfortunately, the other options for sushi in Hoboken aren't much more exciting.
2011-05-10,2,I came here for the first time a few months ago for a quick relaxed solo lunch. The service was good enough, the food is sufficient and the lunch menu isn't a bad deal (notice the luke warmth). Maybe that time I wasn't really paying attention, too busy reading the New Yorkers stacked by the window. I came back the week after the tsunami in Japan, receiving nasty rushed yet disinterested service (wacky combination, I know). She acted as if a solo diner was too much of a bother, maybe the ring wasn't high enough. Somehow I inextricably tied those two things together---bad service and tragedy. Blame it on my vivid imagination, but I pictured the hostess/waitress/owner sobbing behind closed curtains waiting by the phone for a call from the shoreline that would never actually come. I took rachmones on her (a form of pity for all the kids who didn't grow up with a tough NY Jewish grandmother).  Yep, call me crazy. I really hoped she would pull through the sadness--- even if it was all a machination. Stupidly, and blindly optimistic, I've come back 2-3 times since to the same service. Always curt, always the bum's rush and she gives me a look that's a mixture of dislike and confusion. I think she's just plain mean. Tragedy doesn't make you mean--- and if it does, I won't be patronizing out the storm.
2011-05-06,5,Crazy Spicy Roll (always on the specials board) is the best sushi roll ever. Great sushi, great price, great hole-in-the wall spot.
2011-03-25,5,Fantastic - THE casual sushi place.Jay the head sushi chef is wonderful at what he does and so very nice.I have gone 20+ times and still clamoring for more.  Very reasonable prices for top grade sushi.A must try!
2011-03-06,4,Every time I go back to Hoboken, this is the place I must stop by. Love their ugly spicy!! the food is decent there, the stuff is very friendly. And the price is very reasonable.
2011-02-01,1,I ordered sushi from Ubu on a Sunday night. I eat sushi on a regular basis and had high hopes for this place. Boy was I disappointed!After I placed the order, I patiently waited a whopping hour and 15 minutes before breaking down and calling back. Whoever answered the phone told me that there was a lot of traffic in Hoboken and their delivery person had left 20 minutes ago. ...I only live a few streets away from Ubu, I don't think ANYTHING takes 20 minutes to get to! Food finally arrived- I asked the delivery guy if it had been a busy night. He responded with "No, it's actually been kind of slow tonight". Figures.I had ordered a sushi combo for myself and a sashimi combo for my boyfriend, both of which come with soup and salad. The "soup" was a joke, not even 1/4 of the plastic container was filled. All of my sushi rolls had the tiniest sliver of fish in them- all I could taste was rice and seaweed. My boyfriend's dinner was supposed to come with rice on the side which they forgot- at that point I was too annoyed to bother calling back and dealing with them again.Even though the sushi was not expensive, I would much rather pay a little more money and get something that was of decent quality and actually included the sushi I paid for. I will definitely never be going back.
2010-12-17,5,Everything is great about this place. From the cozy atmosphere to the extremely friendly staff. My girlfriend and I went on a Thursday night and brought a bottle of sake and a 6 pack of Sapporo. That's right, for the two of us. The staff graciously continued to refill and heat our sake everytime our mini-bottle was empty (which was about every 5 minutes). They had a smile on the entire time and it felt as if they were truly glad to have us there. My girlfriend ordered the Philly Roll (I personally think she just orders that because she lived in Philadephia for a year) and I got the Lobster, Spicy Tuna, and Rainbow Rolls. Everything was fresh and delicious. I think the bill was $36, and I left a $13 tip because I was impressed with the service, and drunk. I'll definitely be back soon.
2010-11-08,1,The draft coming from the street on a chilly evening, the grey beef Teriyaki that was hard and tasteless, tiny sushi pieces, waitress with an attitude, salads with 5 pieces of lettuce, watery miso soups... the list can go on and on.There are so many Japanese restaurants in Hoboken. Given the choice, I'd go elsewhere next time.
2010-10-02,3,I always love a BOYB sushi place but was really underwhelmed with the quality of their fish.  Was hoping for a better experience based on the previous reviews; went on a Monday if that means anything.
2010-09-10,4,My husband and I have been to Ubu twice.  We've been really happy with it!  The sushi is always fantastic.  Super fresh/delicious.  We have only ordered salads and maki rolls.  Love that it's BYOB and the price of the sushi is incredibly reasonable.   When we go out for sushi, we typically get edamame, an app (salad), and 3 specialty rolls.  With tip, it's usually less than $55.  Great! It's a really small spot.  During the summer, it's nice to sit outside.  The inside only seats about 20 people.  There's not a lot for ambiance, but the service is very attentive, and the food is great.
2010-08-24,5,Love, love, love this sushi place! The food here is great, it's BYOB, huge very fresh portions of the fish. Sashimi platter is a great price and large sizes of the fish, along with a salad and soup. I had a few of the specialty rolls and was very impressed, best sushi place in Hoboken, blows Sushi House out of the water... Far better than Illuzions if you're not interested in decor and ambiance
2010-07-06,4,Frankly, I love this place. The sushi is good, especially for the (extremely reasonable) price. It's not going to make you swear off all other sushi houses, but it's definitely yummy, with fresh fish and well-seasoned rice. You're not going to be drowning it in soy sauce to get it down, trust me.What is better than just good is the age-tofu. Age-tofu is one of my favorite dishes and I make an effort to try it out at most Japanese restaurants I go to. The age-tofu at Ubu might be the best I've ever had. What it lacks for looks it easily makes up in sheer flavor. Seriously, it's like a soft, meltingly warm cloud of lightly fried goodness in your mouth.
2009-12-08,5,Sushi houses are a dime a dozen in Hoboken, and it's a pretty accurate assumption that you will pass at least one, if not two, on every block of Washington St. In fact, bars are probably the only other establishment that rival sushi houses in number, and that is a big statement. Therefore, when I hear that Ubu has the best sushi in Hoboken, I have to go see for myself.It is definitely a small place, and is easy to miss if you are not looking for it. When you step inside, it is everything I would have imagined a small sushi house in Japan to be like. It's small and quiet with no bells or whistles. The staff at Ubu was extremely friendly and helpful. Not only was the hostess very courteous, but the chef was smiling and greeting my friend and I as we were being seated. I am not sure how they are when things get busy, but from my experience so far, their service was superb.But as we all know, good service can only do so much. The true test of value comes in the food, and boy do they deliver. Even though it was hyped up to me as THE definitive best place in Hoboken for sushi, the restaurant rose to the bar that my friend's recommendation set. The meal started off rocky with an appetizer of Gyoza, which is a steamed dumpling that might have been steamed a little too long. The flavor was there, but texturally it wasn't. However, my order of Mixed Tempura Shrimp and Vegetables made a strong case for Ubu. The shrimp, broccoli, and potatoes were cooked beautifully, and may have been some of the best I've ever had. And trust me, I've had my share of Tempura'd foods. What really sold me though was the sushi, which was the reason I was there. Between my guest and me, we had a Chicken Tempura Roll, Spicy Salmon Roll, and a Spicy California Roll. The sushi tasted fresh and delicious, and the rice was perfect sushi rice. The only thing that I had a problem with was the size of the rolls. Their normal rolls are a bit smaller than I am used to. However, the Chicken Tempura Roll, which cost a bit more, was classified as a "Big" roll. I wasn't sure what that meant, but I did get my money's worth when it was served since it was almost twice the size of a normal roll. All in all, while it was not the singular greatest sushi experience of my lifetime, it was one of the better sushi lunches I've had in quite some time. The small, simple, and quiet space made me feel like I was in an authentic sushi house in Japan. And if that wasn't enough, the great staff and excellent sushi definitely make this place a spot you don't want to miss. I guess there is some truth to the saying that great things can come in small packages.
2009-08-26,4,Nice little Sushi place near the path and river street. It earned extra +1 Star from me because I enjoy the Vegie Donburi aka (Hwe dup bop). The sushi and udon was nothing special but excellent service more than makes up for it.Pros: def try Hwe Dup bop worth $12.50. Non-Chinese owned Sushi place in Hoboken.Cons: Could be bigger and place could use some updated decor/ lighting.
2009-08-22,3,Perhaps I need to give Ubu a second try.  Perhaps I'm spoiled by places like Yasuda in Manhattan. When I saw 5 stars from previous yelpers, I was really excited, thought wow this must be on par with Yasuda and Megu, closer to home.  But in the end, I left a little disappointed.  First, the service was great, the waitress was very friendly, and so was the sushi chief.  The place is cozy, quiet, and comfortable.  Good place to bring friends and family.  The food, however, was just like any other sushi place, it was decent, but didn't blow me away.  We got the Ubu Special Maki Combo, which did come with a huge variety:lobster roll, spicy tuna, dragon, spider roll, etc.  The fishes were fresh enough, but didn't have that melt-in-your-mouth type of freshness.  My sister had the udon, the soup was tasty, but the udon is a little too soft.  My dad's miso soup, as he claimed, lacked miso flavor and tasted watery.  He preferred the soup in my sister's udon.   We also got the Dadaki for appetizer.  I was expecting tuna pieces to be more seared on the outside, providing the contrast against the raw texture of fish on the inside.  But the  Dadaki was just very plain, and the fish tasted a little rubbery.   Maybe I should try the spicy version next time.  Though in my experience, anytime a sushi place put too much spices or sauce, it usually means that the fish is not as fresh, and the chief is compensating or hiding that with sauce.    The salmon on those maki rolls seemed fresher and was tastier than the tuna.  The lobster roll, fried tempura wrapped around the lobster, stuffed into a roll, is a bit wasteful way of cooking lobster.  A lobster should be utilized in sashimi so you can savor its flavor.  Overall, my expectation was so high that I set myself up in the end.  This place, IMHO, is still better than other sushi places in hoboken.  The Sushi Lounge across the street is a faux-japanese trendy fake food.  This place at least had some decent rolls.
2009-04-11,4,Went here for dinner to get away from the hustle and bustle of sushi lounge across the street and on recommendation from a friend on the sushi.Ubu was nice and quiet and cozy. The fish was very fresh and the service was excellent and attentive. Jay at the sushi bar station is super nice and on first name basis with many patrons.It doesn't stand out as the best place i've ever been to in my life, hence the 4 stars, but it was pretty good sushi.BYOB and yes the spider rolls were good
2009-03-19,5,My lady and I absolutely LOVE this place... Jay (the sushi chef) is the NICEST dude. The place might not be the biggest or most glamorous but the service is great (why is there a new girl serving us each time though? hmmm... they've ALL been extremely nice though!), the sushi is EXCELLENT (fresh and tasty) and it's not nearly as expensive as some of the other places in Hoboken. BYOB is awesome. I'm getting hungry just thinking about their AMAZING Spider Rolls (must have). Best place in Hoboken to have some sushi. Go there, you won't be dissapointed and check the wall of photos, you'll see my gf Claudia, her family and myself celebrating her mom's bday here. Say hi to Jay for me!
2008-01-17,5,My bf and I go here at least once a week.  The fish is always fresh, the service is always friendly.  It's BYOB which is also a nice touch.  Highly recommended.
