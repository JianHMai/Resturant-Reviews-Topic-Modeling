2021-11-05,4,Grand Vin is a staple for drinks and dinner. Really amazing food, good portions, classic meals!
2021-11-04,4,A very hyped up spot. Decor and ambiance was amazing, live music and dim lighting. For apps we had the tuna tar tar, calamari, meatballs and truffle fries.(Decent) For mains we had the halibut (very good), two different pastas (both kustokay), short rib (very good). The drinks were very good, but pricey! Service was also good.
2021-10-14,4,The ambiance of this place is unmatched. Definitely would suggest making reservations ahead of time. Had to sit in a odd but cute location by the front door. Had to get a glass of rosé, my fav, to start. For $14 per glass it was definitely a small pour but delicious. Had a charcuterie 6 combo board to share and tuna tartare. Both were amazing! Definitely needed more crostinis with the board but loved all the meats and cheeses. Also enjoyed the live music as well. Even though it was packed with music playing, it wasn't too loud that you couldn't hear across the table when talking with your friends. Cannot wait to come back and try the short rib and risotto. Perfect late night find in Hoboken and open until midnight during the week FYI :)
2021-10-10,2,Disappointed.. Read the reviews and thought this place had potential. It's a nice place for ambience but everything else not so good. We had the waiter recommend a wine, he suggested a Malbec. It was gross. I couldn't finish it. We order the stuffed shrimp appetizer- I couldn't eat it. Very fishy taste I did not care for it all. So decided to try a different appetizer. I was apprehensive about ordering the scallops appetizer because the shrimp was so bad but we did. It was good. After that there's nothing. We waited and waited for our waiter to take our entree order but he never came back. We literally sat there for what seemed like an hour waiting to order something else but no one came by. We actually had to go to the bar to ask and Pay our bill. I don't think we be back
2021-10-06,5,My Fiancé and I had our first date here in 2018. He have come back here for our anniversaries brought friends and family there. The place never disappoints
2021-10-05,5,Grand Vin hosted us for our engagement party, and it was honestly one of the best days of our lives! I highly, highly recommend them if you are looking to host a shower or any kind of celebration!To start, this restaurant is our happy place. We come here about once a week ether to have dinner or enjoy a drink at the bar. So, when we were considering having an engagement party, we knew it would have to be at Grand Vin.Decor reminds me of Napa, like a slightly rustic (but also super classy) wine bar. You don't even need much decor because the string lights and greenery throughout the restaurant set the perfect, romantic vibe.The service is top-notch, Amanda and Mike (the managers) were communicative and so helpful organizing everything. I was able to drop off decor the day prior and then leave everything fully in their hands to execute. We spent about the first 45 mins or so of the party hanging out in the bar area with passed appetizers, then were all seated in the dining room for the meal. They timed all of the courses perfectly and the portions were incredibly generous!The food is insanely good; everyone kept talking about it. I dream of that sea bass and gnocchi all the time!We had about 45 people seated in their back dining area, but they can fit a bit more than that if you rent out the whole space. There is also a parking garage about a block away (a SUPER huge plus for all Hoboken venues!).
2021-09-28,3,Came to Grand Vin with my best friend to celebrate her 27th birthday! They didn't have any reservations that day but they offered us comfortable seating at the bar, which was great! The lighting, ambiance and mood of the place is immaculate! They had live music playing on a Saturday night, they had shiny lights placed everywhere to light up the place, which was pretty dimly lit to begin with. I loved the quaint and simplistic decor on the walls too-- bathrooms are also SUPER clean and well lit and smell like lavender. I loved how clean it was! The music just makes you want to sway in your seat! I loved the aura it created.Parking in general is not easy in hoboken, and it definitely isn't in this area either, especially on a busy Saturday night! I'd leave an extra 10-15 minutes before your reservation to be able to find some street parking. In terms for service, the bartender was super nice! He promptly asked us for our drink choices - after giving us enough time to scan the QR code and peruse the extensive wine list. He came back to ask us for our appetizers and dinner choices too. The only issue I had was that we asked for our app first (which was just truffle fries) so we could munch on those with the wine we chose for a little bit before we dove into dinner- but it all ended up coming out at once. No big deal, just a small caveat, I'd be sure to specify if you want your app separately if you visit. We picked the cheapest white wine they had honestly and it was delicious! It was dry with the perfect amount of sweetness and paired very well with the food. The fries I mentioned were TO DIE FOR! They were sooo HOT you could tell they had just made them and they were perfectly seasoned. I love mixing my mayo and ketchup and dipping my fries into my mayo-chup-- I'd recommend trying that if you choose to visit it was really really good. Grand Vin took fries to another level. Where I was kind of hoping for better was dinner food. I got the small portion of ravioli for $16 and I got THREE pieces of ravioli. THREE. That was more like a snack then a small plate. It was delicious when I topped it with red pepper flakes, but I don't think that it was worth the price. My BFF got the rigatoni in a cheese sauce with "vegetables" and the only vegetablE - singular- in there were chunks of cucumber. This dish was kind of bland, even after adding pepper flakes the sauce didn't offer much, and was also a similar price. I wouldn't even mind paying the price for the dish if it was absolutely delicious OR at the very least it was OK and filled me up-- but these dishes sadly didn't do either. If you get dinner here - be sure to get the large plate. A large plate of the ravioli would've been a good move, but I think I'd stray away from the rigatoni. Don't think I'll be back here, but it was a good experience for a one time try.
2021-09-18,3,Loved the food (3 stars), wife loved the drink, but service was lackluster. The host didn't seem to thrilled to be there and after checking us in for the reso he was about to take us to our table until the phone rang. He answered and we were put on pause. I've been a host for the past few years and the phone is always last priority until we've accommodated the guest in front of us. While we waited a few minutes for him to finish the phone convo, he was finally ready to take us to our table. Once we got there, there wasn't a gesture or even a verbal indication as to which of the 5 empty tables was ours. He just stared at it & my wife asked, "this one?" and he said Yeah. No interaction so that was a little surprising for a place of this setting.Once seated, a table was sat behind us about 5 minutes after us & were already greeted by their bubbly server who brought them water and was engaging about the menu. The host must have noticed us looking around because he went over to our server to tell her he sat her section, whoops! Took her a minute to get to our table and the interaction was minimal. No personality, pretty much matter of fact. She had a shadow & the outdoor section so maybe she was overwhelmed? The shadow was nice & showed personality when asking how we liked our food (we were only checked on/asked this 1/3 plates that were dropped). Another thing we thought odd was when our first drop was cleared, we had put the silverware on the plates to try and have a full clear. However, the busser (after watching us place the silverware on the plates) removed the silverware, and placed them back on the table with the tips of the forks directly on the table. No thanks! We asked for new silverware. I'd definitely return for the food (everything was SPOT ON!) but the service was not what we expected.
2021-09-01,5,The staff is very attentive and the atmosphere is always buzzing. The food is good, the cocktails are great and I always look forward to my next visit. Closest it gets to a LES vibe on this side of the river
2021-08-11,5,Love this wine bar!! Great service and they have a cute, super cozy vibe!! Their chicken entree with vodka sauce was really good as well as the pastas - both the rigatoni and capellini. Great food and drink menu! There was live music on a Friday night.
2021-08-08,1,Don't waste your money here! I don't understand why this place has such high reviews. The food was horrible, none of the staff is knowledgeable about the wine and the wine list was tiny, overpriced, and full of nothing but mediocre wines. Hoboken and your wallet both deserve better.
2021-08-07,4,I mean the food is amazing, but to be honest it's tooo BUSY! Yes being busy is a good thing, but having a connection with your waiter is also key. The waiters seemed to be too overworked and not really excited to engage in contact with the customers. I love this place but hopefully that's one thing they can improve on.
2021-08-04,5,I've been here for many a family birthday dinner. Come early if you want a quiet evening. This place is dark, loud, and lively at night. I almost never order pasta when I go out, but this seemed like the place. Delicious angel hair! Yum! But, could have done without the peas IMO. I would have it again. Loved the figs and also sprouts salad. The drinks are crafted well and the staff members are great. They are attentive and helpful in such a way that they aren't too "in your face," loud, or "try-hard." How it should be.
2021-07-31,4,All in all we had a good time here ! The spot is beautiful - I love green and white floral decor personally. We came for a Saturday brunch and were seated with reservations outdoors. The prosecco sangria was tasty and the drink menu was extensive. I LOVED my smoked salmon toast which was delicious and huge for $7. I also liked the arugula salad. My friends enjoyed their entrees as well. Honestly, my only gripe is the service. We weren't server for 45 minutes. I had to ask a server if we could order bc we were starving and sweating outside lol The server later apologized saying no one was ever assigned to our table, which makes sense. We were literally forgotten. BUT, the food and drinks were great so I'd still recommend!
2021-07-29,5,Cute restaurant with intimate seating both inside snd out.  Recently attended a Baby Shower and everything was perfect from decor to food.  A clean and inviting interior that was "on trend" decoration wise with attentive service.  Food was served at correct temperature, flavorful and tasty.  Salad was fresh, Pasta was perfectly cooked (al dente) and the NY Strip Steak was cooked to temperature order with a yummy Mushroom sauce. A very nice day.
2021-07-24,1,I have been living in Hoboken for six years and has always wanted to try grand vin. Thankfully, I only went once, considering I got food poisoning from my meal. Very disappointed and over priced menu.
2021-07-21,4,Went for dinner on a Sunday and it was pretty busy. Started with oysters, which were very disappointing- no flavor and the condiments were weird with it. They were stuck in the shells and were kind of dry...but The mussels were good! Our server was okay, forgot a few things but overall fine. The gnocchi was really great. I got the small portion which was perfect size and amazing. Overall pretty good spot but would give it a 3.5-4
2021-07-17,5,Ambiance, music, food all around amazing tonight. Go for the specials and on a night where they have live music.
2021-07-15,2,My friend and I went to grand vin last night to celebrate after not seeing each other for a while. We were so excited to go to as we both had never been before and it was on our list of restaurants to try as we had heard great things. Unfortunately we were greatly disappointed and do not plan to return. Overall the service was fine but my friend was first served the completely wrong meal after waiting 45 min for our dinner to come out. It then took another 10 min for the correct dish to come out which was the spinach ravioli and it was inedible, do not order the spinach ravioli!!!, we both tried it and left every piece on the plate sadly especially for it to be $25 which is a bit outrageous for 5 pieces of vegetable ravioli. I ordered the ratatouille arancini which claimed to be "stuffed" with veggies but there was literally one small zucchini slice in each massive rice ball which was also disappointing. Everything else we had was sub par and not worth the high prices. Do not plan to go back any time soon.
2021-07-06,4,Have been dying to try this place since moving here. Made a reservation for 6 people 7:30 on a Friday evening, table was ready and water was provided quickly. The drinks were all fabulous. The service was slow after we placed the drinks but once we put in appetizers and entrees the service became much better. We got mussels, burrata, artichokes, and calamari to start. They all were amazing.For entrees, half of us got the pappardelle small portion since we were full from appetizers, we all really enjoyed this dish.Another got the chicken entree with the cutlet and vodka sauce, he subbed the mash potatoes with pasta, it was incredible and cooked to perfection. Overall, great experience and will definitely return. Only reason I did not give it 5 stars was it took us about 30 minutes to place our appetizers.
2021-06-21,4,This place is just so good. The food is always delicious and the ambience is excellent. It's the perfect place for date night or wine night or any special moment. We started with oysters which were fantastic. We just wished they were shucked a little more. (Hard to slurp them out!)We also ordered the fried calamari buschetta which was a nice spin on the classic. (Included a drizzle of balsamic and tomatoes) We probably wouldn't order this again because some of the calamari were chewy. For our entrees, we ordered short ribs and the capellini. Short ribs melted in your mouth and the capellini wasn't heavy - which I was afraid of. We would order both of these again!
2021-06-20,3,I was excited to come here for brunch because I had heard things about this place. I tried coming a few weeks ago, and when I called they said there was a 90 minute wait. I was excited to have gotten a last minute reservation, because I thought the long wait time would be indicative of good food and service. Unfortunately, that wasn't really the case. When it comes to service, everything was very fast. Too fast, actually. The reservation was made for 11:45 am, we were out by 12:15 pm. If I'm paying to go out to a restaurant, I'm paying for the food, service, and the table itself. The server I had wasn't very personable during this short time either, so I left with a lot to be desired in that regard. As for the actual food, I had the avocado benedict and my dad had the pulled pork benedict. There wasn't much avocado in my meal, and the little bit I had was doused in lime juice and still slightly brown from sitting out. My dad had a ton of pulled pork, but I'm pretty sure they just braise the pork with a tub of BBQ sauce. I tasted no seasoning in the pork and it desperately needed some pepper at the very least. Overall, it wasn't a terrible experience, but I'm not desperate to come back any time soon.
2021-06-18,3,Came here to celebrate my boyfriends birthday after seeing great reviews. This meal was a true rollercoaster... so buckle up!!When we walked we were truly impressed by the interior and exterior decor and lighting. There was a live musician who played at a perfectly low volume and created a great ambiance. I had noted on the reservation that it was a special occasion and I appreciated how the hostess wished my boyfriend a happy birthday when we were seated!After browsing the menu (by scanning the QR code on the table) our waiter stopped by to take our drink order. Shortly after getting our drinks he took our food order.... and then trying to catch him again for anything else became mission impossible!! I literally had the stand up at the table and wave him down to get another round of drinks. He would all but sprint by the table without so much of a glance in our direction whenever he would walk by. He was so short with us when we would order our drinks I could barely get out what I wanted before he would walk away. I've never seen behavior like this before from a waiter. 20 minutes after finishing our meal I had to wave down a different waiter for our check who ended up walking over to our waiter (who was sitting at the bar eating!!) and informing him we wanted to leave. Now for the food. The bread that was served as soon as we sat down came with the most delicious basil dipping sauce. And props to the bus boy for bringing us another round of bread!! So good. For apps we ordered the stuffed mushrooms and burrata. The burrata was just average and really nothing special...it also needed salt but we did enjoy the dried meats that came with it. The stuffed mushrooms on the other hand were absolutely delicious. I would come back here just for those. As for the main I got the Chilean seabass. This was hands down the worst piece of fish I have ever eaten or been served. It was straight up rubber. I am not even kidding when I say that I could not cut the fish with my fork and knife. Chilean seabass is supposed to flake apart. This fish literally bounced! For the money I paid I was so incredibly disappointed. I couldn't eat the fish at all and worse... I couldn't tell the waiter about it because he was no where to be found!! What had started off as a great evening with a great ambiance and delicious stuffed mushrooms... ended with horrible service and the grossest piece of fish I've ever been served. So disappointed :(
2021-06-15,5,Grand Vin is your ultimate date night spot. First date, already been dating, married, it's just a gorgeous intimate space and the food is fabulous. The meatballs are my personal favorite, and they always have yummy seasonal options as well. They have an amazing selection of wines hence the name, but the ambiance is truly what makes this place special. It's intimate, has perfect lighting, with candles on each table. I love this place, and miss going as often as I did when I lived in Hoboken.
2021-06-11,3,It was decent but nothing to brag about. I wouldn't be coming back. I asked the waiter the cheese selection and she couldn't help me out. I had to google more information on all the cheeses. The waiter was very friendly though.
2021-05-23,5,Great restaurant for outdoor brunch! The overall atmosphere and decor of the restaurant is pretty, and the service was good. They have covered outdoor seating so it wasn't too hot and made for a great dining experience. I got the Brie burger and thought it was very tasty!
2021-05-21,5,We've been trying to come here for such a long time and finally made it. I'm so happy we did! All of the food was delicious. It was hot, fresh, great portions, and the flavors were all amazing! The stuffed mushrooms are so good, the risotto is perfect, and the short ribs are so soft and tasty. It's hard to choose what was the best dish because they were all great. The service was also good, although our sever was busy that night he made sure we were taken care of. Please make a reservation since they do book up in advance. I will definitely be back to try other things on the menu. We were very impressed.
2021-05-21,1,Last night a few friends and I had a bad experience at the bar at Grand Vin. The bartender, Mark, claimed my friend was "unhinged" and "belligerent" after a glass of wine and 1 shot within an hour and a half of each other. Throughout the time we were there we were talking among ourselves and sang along to the live music just as friends would do. Mind you this is a Thursday night and we are working professionals in our late 20s and 30s....Nobody was out of control or causing commotion until he decided he didn't like us. Mark decided to chastise grown women and dictate how their night should be and what they should and shouldn't be doing. My friend's drink was taken away before it was even finished and I didn't finish mine because we unfortunately could not stay there a minute longer and pay to be berated by this loser. It's funny because we even asked for water with our drinks when we sat down...Mark had a chip on his shoulder the minute we sat down and it was apparent the entire night. He was so unprofessional and made us all feel uncomfortable and threw the bill at us at the end to pay. The manager repeatedly asked "What can I do? What can I do?" without taking any further action. You know what you can do-give me back my money for the drinks that were taken away from us. I have never not tipped until last night, I was completely speechless...I was a waitress for 6 years and have never thought to speak to a paying customer that way and I can assure you we will never come back or recommend the place to any of our friends. It's a shame because I have been here many times and have spent hundreds of dollars here but after such an awful experience I can't justify ever coming here again when there are so many other places with amazing and friendly staff.
2021-05-17,2,I have no idea how this place gets 4 stars. The food was BLAND. No taste at all! Went for brunch...ordered an omelet and it was profoundly blah. We ordered Avocado Fries up front - they were OK but somewhat greasy.  Also the have a bucket near the table where they put the table cleaning supplies but they also keep the pepper shaker in it. Seems a bit gross. Also slow service. Much better options in Hoboken.
2021-05-13,3,I use to LOVE this place. Sadly, I've tried to order pick up around 10 times the past two months, all on different days of the week, and they never take orders anymore. The food is incredible but the service when you are there and for picking up is poor. :(
2021-05-04,5,Decor is great food is amazing. Outdoor seating is comfortable. One of my favorite spots in Hoboken
2021-05-02,5,I LOVE THIS PLACE!! I have been here many many times for different occasions. I have been on dates here with my boyfriend and we have not a single complaint, just great things to say! I have also been here for a friends birthday with a group of 8 more recently and we were seated in a nicely set up area and our waitress was absolutely amazing. The Arancini appetizer is to DIE FOR! The strip steak entree is the best I have ever tasted. They have live music that truly makes the intimate restaurant even better! You truly can not go wrong with the Grand Vin! I will be back many many more times...I've never enjoyed a restaurant so much!
2021-04-29,4,I need to come back and try the food. It looked good. I popped in for a glass of wine. The wine was atrocious, but I chose it so I can't blame the restaurant. It was the orange wine. It had a rubber chemical aftertaste. I normally love orange wines.
2021-04-19,2,Came here on a Wednesday night with a friend for dinner. When I arrived the hostess was rude right off the bat and had a terrible attitude so immediately I did not feel welcomed. The food was just ok and way too overpriced for what it was. Cocktails were good, but nothing spectacular. All around service was awful and un-accommodating. The only con is that they had live music the night we came.
2021-04-18,1,Wow what a let down this was. We had been there prior and had an amazing experience and decided we had to come back. Well that was a mistake. We came for brunch around 1215pm. It was pretty empty. We ordered within 10 minutes of arriving. It took almost an hour for our food to come out. It was stone cold and just plain disgusting. Sad to say we will not be returning.
2021-04-18,3,Food is always delicious and ambience is beautiful. Grand Vin makes the dining experience intimate during these challenging times. I have to give 3 stars because of the service last night. Our server didn't check on us once, didn't ask if we wanted any other drinks or dessert or how our meal was. It was very, very disappointing.
2021-04-17,1,Terrible service! Salad came out all wrong, missing ingredients that nobody even bothered to inform, oysters were bad, service is slow food took forever to come out then rushing us out for their next reservation. Like I get it but how fast do i have to eat if the kitchen and service is slow?! Never coming back!
2021-04-12,4,Grand Vin is a gorgeous little Italian spot perfect for dates and small gatherings.  We had a small roommate dinner there and the food was excellent and the ambiance was really nice.  One thing to note was this is a much better place to take a date.  Everyone in the restaurant were couples that looked like they were on their first or second dates when we dined there.  Defiantly a good place to make a reservation if you are in the area.
2021-04-10,5,Food was absolutely delicious and the drinks were just as good. Came here for Valentine's Day and the decorations and ambiance were exactly what we were looking for. Perfect place for a date night.
2021-04-08,4,The restaurant was beautiful and had a wonderful ambiance. The food was decent, my favorite was the stuffed mushrooms! A wonderful place to have a dinner date or a Sunday brunch.
2021-04-01,1,WOW !!!! I usually do my best to find a good thing about the places I visit :( however this one is just that bad .. let me start with : Service : it is TERRIBLE !!! the servers are so rude , it's like they are doing you a favor by serving you .The food : food was ok but definitely over priced for the quality and the presentation is not appealing at all , it's like they just throw the food on the place and serve it . Honestly if you are going to be over priced than at least present the food better . The tables : they tried to make it safe and put dividers in between tables , however it's extremely uncomfortable because it's way to tight .On top of all that they take at least 15 minutes to get your drink and food order and yet they want you out .. I mean OUT in an 1-1/2 hours , I wasn't even done with my drink and our check was already at the table and the server told us we needed to go .So this was certainly the WORSE 1-1/2 hour of my life . I haven't had such a bad experience like this in a while . We both agreed we will definitely NOT GO BACK . And if you want a great time and value your money I'd suggest you to go elsewhere . SMH !!!
2021-03-27,5,We visited Grand Vin late last week and had a wonderful experience!  The waiter, Mike, was super nice and very attentive.  He suggested a glass of wine for me that was perfect with my meal.  Our party of three all ordered something different and we were all very happy with our dishes.  Delicious, savory food that felt perfect for a cold and rainy night.  However, I would suspect their food would taste perfect for any type of evening.  I loved the ambience of this restaurant with the lights and foliage on the ceiling.  The noise level was perfect for dining with our daughter, who lives in Hoboken, my husband and I!  Can't wait to return on our next trip out to visit our daughter!
2021-03-24,5,Went for brunch and loved it! The food was great and very reasonably priced! Very good service as well!
2021-03-22,5,This place is amazing! I had my wedding here a few years ago and I have come back for my anniversary each year! They were able to add beautiful personal touches for my wedding day and were very accommodating. There food is always amazing and the staff is very professional! I will always come back for more!
2021-03-22,5,Nothing but great things to say about this place. There's always great service and amazing food and drinks. The atmosphere and ambiance is one of the best in Hoboken, and their outdoor dining setup is super cute as well. They used to have a good deal for happy hour on Tuesday's with cheap wine flights. Hoping they bring it back post COVID.
2021-03-14,4,I went to Grand Vin for brunch this weekend and was thoroughly impressed! The decor is stunning - fake plants and ivy hanging from the ceiling with twinkling lights and they had cute dividers between each table for social distancing. I ordered the breakfast Mac and cheese and it was great! It had large pieces of chorizo and it was such a large portion for the price. We also ordered the pulled pork Benedict which was absolutely massive! To drink, I tried the brunch sangria and definitely recommend it! It had a lot of flavor and wasn't too sweet (which I prefer) like a lot of brunch drinks are. The Everything Bagel Bloody Mary was just ok, but thought the mini bagel on top was a cute touch. Grand Vin was a great bunch spot in Hoboken and all the food was fairly priced, especially for how much they give you. The drink prices were a little steep though. Would definitely return here for brunch and I'm interested to check out their dinners here in the future!
2021-03-08,4,So I will get the bad over with. The hostess was not good. We asked for a table near the music and she delivers us to the back passing two empty tables. We ask "can we have one of those?" Oh its reserved (never saw someone show up later) "How about the other one?" which she then begrudgingly gave us.  Food: OUTSTANDING. Tuna appetizer, super fresh and a great sized portion. The chicken parm with vodka sauce and fresh mozzerella  has now ruined it for me to get it anywhere else. Our waiter was great too
2021-03-08,5,I went to Grand Vin yesterday with my friends for brunch and it was such a great menu and atmosphere for brunch! I had an outstanding truffle omelette with a spiced apple mimosa and I loved both so much! The omelette was super rich and extremely filling as well. The mimosa has cinnamon sugar on the border and a great taste of apple in the drink itself. The prices, especially considering it's a Hoboken brunch spot, are pretty reasonable. I will definitely be coming back and I'm looking forward to trying new things here in the future!
2021-02-16,5,My new favorite spot in Hoboken! Grand Vin has a beautiful, romantic vibe and the food does not disappoint. The ricotta gnocchi was to die for and the service was excellent! All of the staff were wearing masks and they had wooden dividers between the tables. Oh, and the cheesecake was some of the best cheesecake i've had in years! HIGHLY recommend
2021-02-14,5,Every time I have come to Grand Vin, the food has been amazing. Love the ambiance as they frequently have live music. The decor is always very pretty. I have also had a great dinner eating at the bar. The cocktails are always great too. I haven't been here during Covid yet, so I can't speak to that. But my experience dining here has always been fantastic.
2021-02-06,5,Such a great restaurant. Super flavorful food and good menu. Loved the fish, tuna tartare and gnocci. Even a good brunch. I wouldn't eat inside during Covid but beautiful and romantic lightening/ restaurant.
2021-01-30,5,Loved eating dinner at Grand Vin! Such a great atmosphere and wonderful food. We will be back.
2021-01-28,5,Great venue. Reminds me on a wine bar I went to in the UK. Good selection of wines is always a great way to start. They had a very good Sancerre Rouge. Super light and great flavor. We started with a pasta as an appetizer. Delicious. Their pasta is all freshly made. Started with the rigatoni which was delicious. For the main course we did the short rib entree and the salmon entree. Both were extremely tasty and flavorful. We did the chocolate mouse cake dessert which was also very well made. No complains. Nicely tucked away place for a great time. Highly recommend if you're in Hoboken.
2021-01-27,3,The atmosphere is great but the food is very average. This is definitely a great spot for drinks post covid.
2021-01-23,5,I'm so glad I found this restaurant, great drinks as well as very great brunch! Nice selection & great customer service,  great Covid-19 measures taken as well for indoor seating.
2021-01-21,5,Amazing parparedelle and fantastic nebullo!!!Come for happy hour too. Incredible atmosphere:)
2021-01-19,5,My fav Hoboken restaurant. Love the meatballs, scallops pasta, really everything! Great drinks too! And family friendly early in the evening.
2021-01-17,3,Great ambiance, but the server Nelson was definitely not fond of my friends and I being of color. Never came back after serving our food and came back with a check an hour later saying have a nice day..
2020-12-27,5,So happy with my choice to dine here for dinner tonight! The food was excellent and so was the service. The ambience of the restaurant is fun and cool. Nice and quiet on a Sunday night! Just how I like it. The bread was awesome following along with the Gnocchi which was just heaven in a bite. A 10/10 will be back!!!
2020-12-14,5,Great service, great food, great vibes! Not much more you can ask for. When you first come in the place is beautiful with low lights and great music playing! They also have live music which is always a nice test. They have a great wine and cocktail list  with something for everybody! We enjoyed wine and a Smokey whisky! The food is just next level. Everything was cooked to perfection and absolutely decadent! We got drinks, appetizers, two meals, and a dessert and the prices are not bad at all especially for Hoboken!! Great spot for a date, dinner with family, or really any occasion!!
2020-12-10,4,I recently went for a friends birthday party during quarantine. We ordered appetizers to share (the calamari and the cheese board) and some drinks to celebrate. The calamari was seriously the BEST calamari I've ever had, the cheese board we could've done without. My drink was great and strong so definitely worth the price, I got the Devil wears nada. For dinner, I got the Pappardelle and it was so EH. There was so seasoning and very bland. The ambiance and vibes were great, such pretty lighting but if you're going during a pandemic, I would definitely suggest 4 people max because the seating will be uncomfortable otherwise. They took our number down for covid caution and did have separations up which made me feel better but I still felt like because the place was small, the restaurant felt super packed. Overall pretty fun experience. **Definitely suggest when you go here to get the Chicken Parmesan (my friend got it and enjoyed it) and go with a smaller group on Thursday before 7 (they have girls night specials).
2020-12-09,3,I came to Grand Vin for a friend's birthday and was slightly disappointed. The ambience is very nice, but the food is subpar. The free bread in the beginning is delicious and warm! I loved the bread and even asked for more. For appetizers, we ordered the meat and cheese board for 4 choices ($16). The meats and the cheeses were not as good as I expected, but the fig jam was delicious. The fried calamari was amazing! It came with 2 dipping sauces- a pesto and a marinara. Both were great! I also loved the balsamic glaze on top.I ordered the Pappardelle pasta ($18) for my entree. I thought this was a little flavorless. I needed to add salt and pepper to this. I enjoyed the lightness of it, but it definitely could have been elevated with a little spice. It also would have been better if the scallops were put on top, not on the bottom. In an area with so many Italian restaurants, I think you can find better Italian food for the price, but you want a nice intimate dinner, Grand Vin would be a nice place to go.
2020-12-09,5,This place is truly magical. The service is great. The food is super delicious and the drinks are to die for.My friend and I went over the weekend and had the avocado fries to start (so good!) and for the entree we got the chicken BLAT. Yummy!Plan to go back ASAP. I definitely recommend this place specially for a date night ;)
2020-11-29,4,Need better outdoor heating option to keep guests warm with colder weather. Food was great as always. Chilean sea bass was phenomenal and the drinks were solid.
2020-11-29,4,The food and atmosphere at Grand Vin are great! Before Covid it was always a great spot to at least get a glass of wine before going to dinner and they always had pretty good live music. Right now there are partitions between the tables indoors which is great. The only reason they don't get a full 5 stars is because the service leaves a lot to be desired (with the exception of the hostess - she's always friendly and gave us a spacious table when we had a baby in a carrier). It can be difficult to get a reservation which speaks to the good quality of food I think.
2020-11-25,4,While I recently reviewed Grand Vin for dinner, I found myself there again the other day for brunch and wanted to share my experience.  As always, the service was terrific!  We sat outside in their comfortable streetary and began our experience by sharing an order of Avocado Toast.  The crisp bread was topped with mashed avocado, sliced cherry tomatoes, olive oil, and crushed red pepper.  While the ingredients were bright and fresh, I think it could have used additional red, or even black, pepper for an extra kick.  From there, I ordered the Truffle Omelette, substituting egg whites and goat cheese instead of cheddar.  The hearty omelet also included mushrooms, spinach, and truffle oil, which I think went better with a tangy goat cheese.  The egg dish was served with their version of home fries, which were chunks of potatoes that had been pan-fried with sliced onion and fresh red pepper.  They were delicious and not very greasy.  My brother ordered the Pear and Arugula Salad, which also included goat cheese, as well as prosciutto.  He also topped it off with sliced, grilled chicken.  The poached pears were my favorite, seasonal addition to the mixture, and the white balsamic dressing really tied all of the ingredients together.  Yet again, Grand Vin offered an excellent meal.
2020-11-21,5,The Apple mimosas were outstanding. Food was delicious and service was so quick and on point. They were very accommodating on a cold day to move us from outside to inside. Definitely looking forward to coming back and trying more!
2020-11-20,5,Very fantastic.  TRULY great people and food.  Best food in Hoboken
2020-11-19,4,Great surprise In Hoboken .Food was great and great atmosphere.We had Muscles , tuna and calamari. All were great.Can't remember dinner due to the great drinks.I recommend this place.This was my first time and I'll def. revisit.
2020-11-13,5,A very romantic restaurant - perfect for a date. The entire place is lit up with fairy lights and greenery - the ambiance is what makes it unique for the area. For food, we ordered the burrata, rigatoni, and Chilean sea bass. Everything tasted amazing and I love that they use local ingredients. Overall, a bit pricey but you're paying for good service, decor, and food which I didn't mind. Social distancing is followed at this restaurant, I didn't feel like I was too close to any parties around me. Definitely will return again soon!
2020-11-08,5,This is a quality restaurant and I am never disappointed when I dine here. The portions are very generous and the food is always delicious. The cocktails are also very creative and tasty. Don't have pictures to show, but highly recommend this establishment for any meal.
2020-11-07,3,I can't complain about Grand Vin too much, but if there are any complaints at all, that means it's a 3 for Sarah. We were seated outside almost as soon as we arrived even though we were a tad early for our reservation (it's nearly impossible to get a reservation here unless you book a little over a week out). Our table was totally socially distanced, though it was on the corner of the sidewalk, close to wear diners step outside for a cigarette, so that wasn't exactly ideal. I was really psyched to try the cocktails here, firstly. I ordered the In The Nude tequila drink which seemed so interesting, but unfortunately it didn't ring the bell. I kind of just made up that phrase but I'm picturing that carnival booth where you hit the platform with the leather pounder, that's probably full of diseases when I think of it, and the slingshot doesn't QUITE reach the bell at the top. I could taste each of the ingredients in this cocktail almost separately. Maybe it was just this particular rendition of the beverage, but it didn't result in a beautiful harmony. Great that I was able to munch on the dried apricots, though, while I waited for my app SINCE THERE WASN'T ANY BREAD. You know how this aggravates me. And even when our tuna tartare came (which was really fresh and delicious), the crostini was certainly TINI. Don't even bring me a cracker if it's just a tease. The fish, recommended by the waiter, was good, but Joey's chicken saltimbocca was better. I kept picking at it as if I was trying to discover a carb somewhere underneath its surface but nope, just spinach. The tartufo was yummy - the chocolate shell really did it for me - and the waiter took awhile to bring out the Sambuca for our espressos so he ended up bringing us two and that's probably why I have a headache right now at 5:44 am. I guess my favorite thing about this meal was that we walked there and back on a nice fall evening (which says nothing about the restaurant) and that the tuna tartare was so fresh. I just googled "what does Grand Vin mean in Italian?" because I suspected it meant "grand finale," so I was going to make a joke about bread being the "grand vin" that never made it to the table but turns out it means "the best wine." Now I know why my cocktail was blended with Prosecco. Both the tequila drinks on the cocktail menu are blended with wine, come to think of it. But for a restaurant fully committing to mixing liquors, thereby offering you a headache on a silver platter, you'd think they'd at least bring out some bread.
2020-11-04,5,Delicious food & awesome service! My party felt very comfortable with the guidelines Grand Vin has in place for COVID and social distancing. My favorite dish is the pappardelle pasta with scallops but the cheese board is also incredible! I love this place!
2020-11-01,4,I've been to grand vin several times prior to Covid, mainly to have wine at the bar and catch live music. I dined there Halloween night for the first time since Covid. I was able to make a reservation on Yelp and we could specify we wanted indoors which was great since it was freezing out. I was surprised to see how crowded their inside bar was - all the stools were out and mostly taken with barely any social distancing.  Luckily we were in the main dining area and not on top of other people.  Service here can be hit or miss, but last night it was on point, maybe because it was slower being Halloween. Sadly they had no live music last night. To start, we shared the stuffed mushrooms. So good! An Order comes with 4. We then shared the chicken entree and the pappardelle with scallops as our mains. These dishes also delicious and big portions.  We had a great meal and weren't rushed out as we finished our bottle of wine.
2020-10-27,3,I came here with a friend on a weekend afternoon for brunch. They had plenty of indoor and outt seating and the decor was impeccable. While I was waiting for my friend, a table was ready immediately ready. Our waitress was very kind and provided me with coffee while waiting on my friend.The service was impeccable and the outdoor/indoor dining decor was lovely. For my brunch, I chose the truffle omlette. Despite the cheddar cheese, it felt like it was missing flavor and it was a little on the drier side. Same thing with the home fries. I got some truffle fries afterwards and those were very, very good.All in all, I had high hopes, but perhaps I chose the wrong dish. I'll give it a shot another time!
2020-10-25,3,Celebrated my birthday here. Food was pretty good. I asked in advance if they'd have oysters and they said they would. When I came in.. no oysters ( and that was one of the main reasons why I booked the place). The waitress didn't seem to care it was a special event, no one even said happy birthday or brought out a little desert (with the money we've spent you would expect something little?) she was not pleasant either and barely attentive. Then at the end they added a huge gratuity tip for themselves on the check and for what I will never understand. Not a place to host a group dinner in my opinion, maybe 2-3 people.
2020-10-11,5,Beautiful decoration, cozy ambience and amazing tasty food . Oh, have a mentioned the staff ? So nice and friendly. Five stars is not enough for this place. The food and service are great and price is pretty fair. We ordered for appetizer Tuna Tartar and for entree Pappardelle Pasta. So yummy !!! We closed with a Tiramisu. Food was so great that we forgot to take a a picture. Highly recommend this place.
2020-10-11,1,I'm writing this while sitting at by table. We really had high hopes for this place. We cake for brunch and order 2 mimosas. Those came out in timely manner and our waiter (Nelson) came to take our order. We said 2 words and he tried to zoom off. I caught him in time to tell him the rest of our order. Our apps came out those were fine. Fast forward a whopping 45 minutes and still no food. No one came to see if we had more water, if we needed more drinks. Nothing. I got up. Went up to the hostess and let her know what happened. Fast forward it becomes an hour after the apps come out and no food. Everyone else (people that came after us) had their food. Finally the food came and we were so over it we barely ate and asked for a box to take home. That led to waiting another 20 minutes just for the bill. I'd say the fastest part of our service was paying for a bill that honestly we shouldn't have even paid for. It is unacceptable to come to a restaurant where it's nearly empty and wait over an hour after being seated to eat. That being said we probably won't come back.
2020-10-11,5,Grand Vin is adorable with excellent food, large portions, and a cute outdoor seating area. Love the stuffed mushrooms, artichoke, tuna tartare, all pastas, short rib.... well, everything! Very reasonably priced for the amount and quality of food. Great value and they have live music too.  Yummy cocktails too!
2020-10-10,5,I came here with my date at exactly 11AM for brunch out of fear of having to wait in line. It paid off because we were the first to be seated, and as we were being seated, the line to get in started to form and in minutes, the restaurant was full! I found out that you CAN make a brunch reservation (the hostess had asked if we had a reservation) but I think you'd have to call in. Reservations online only showed times for dinner. My date and I had a great time. When we first sat down, we were given a carafe of infused water. Each table had a QR code to scan using their phone for access to the menu (love it!). I ordered the steak and eggs, in medium, and it came out perfectly cooked. My date ordered the pulled pork Benedict. The both of us upgraded our home fries to truffle fries and it was the best decision we've made! The entrees were so delicious that my date, who normally scoffed at brunches, was completely wow'd and was already making plans to try out their dinner and to bring our other friends! It wouldn't be a brunch if we didn't order drinks! I ordered two apple spiced mimosas, the lambrusco mimosa, and a glass of the Prosecco sangria. They tasted delicious and honestly didn't seem that strong but once we got home, we both KO'd, so I guess they were lowkey strong - the most dangerous kind. The service was great for me. I am a person who hates being constantly bugged mid bite to reply how my food tastes and so this is usually how I judge my service. Our waitress came a total of 4-6 times in a span of a two hour meal, but her timing for each visit was impeccable.The restaurant also did a good job following COVID guidelines. Tables were situated a good distance from each other. All waitresses wore masks. The hostess stand had hand sanitizer. And the menu was accessible by phone so we weren't touching menus that were passed through people all day.Overall, this restaurant was excellent and I'd come here again for sure!
2020-10-08,4,Came here for a double date on a Saturday night. Had a reservation and we were promptly seated outside. Their outside space was decorated very cute with benches and pillows and covered. My boyfriend and I ordered the calamari for appetizer which was a large portion, enough for us to share and then some. It was good, nothing special. For entrees I ordered the pappardelle which was also a huge portion and delicious! The sauce seemed creamier than what I was expecting but not like an alfredo. There was also a decent number of scallops. My boyfriend ordered the special of lobster ravioli which he enjoyed. For dessert we ordered the tartufo and a dessert liquor which were both delicious. Overall, it was a great dining experience and would recommend!
2020-09-27,5,Great outdoor seating during Covid. We went for brunch, our food was good and the apple cider mimosa was delicious!
2020-09-22,3,Came here a couple of weeks ago, had a reservation and was seated outside, which was pretty good. I had high hopes for this place, especially after the wine bar in downtown JC had closed. So at first, it was okay, waiter was attentive our food and wine order was placed pretty quickly. I'll start with the wine first. Now I wasn't expecting anything crazy with the wine, but it was pretty watery. The food was a little pricey for the amount you get. I had the gnocchi which to be honest was pretty good. My girlfriend had the rigatoni, which was just okay, nothing really special which is crazy considering how much you pay for a plate of pasta. By then end it felt like our waiter forgot about us and it took a long time for us to be able to get our check. Overall I'm not unhappy that I tried this place out, it was okay, but I probably would not come back
2020-09-13,5,They have a very cute outdoor seating set up. The staff all wear masks and provide great customer service. I would recommend for brunch for groups up to 6 people
2020-09-07,5,Grand Vin is delicious! 10/10 if I could give ten stars on yelp! I've been here a few times while visiting my sister in Hoboken and I have never been disappointed.We went here impromptu yesterday evening, a group of eight of us. They were able to get us a great table (apart from other tables in the restaurant for COVID regulations) and the decor on the inside was so lovely. All of the employees at Grand Vin were so accommodating and friendly as well! Couldn't do enough for us! My boyfriend ordered the pear ravioli which was extremely rich and had great flavor. I ordered the capellini which was super tasty. My grandmother, mom and sister also all got the capellini and said it was delicious as well! It was in a beef bolognese sauce with peas, prosciutto and mushrooms. My brother in law had the pappardelle with scallops which was extremely fresh tasting scallops and a large portion for getting the small pasta dish. I would highly recommend Grand Vin to anyone visiting Hoboken and looking for great pasta dishes, great service and terrific ambiance. You will certainly not be disappointed!
2020-08-25,5,The best! Nothing better than Grand Vin. Every single thing is delicious and the staff is always super friendly.
2020-08-17,5,Grand vin has always been one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken - love the atmosphere, live music (pre-COVID), and homemade pasta! I recently dined outdoors and they have a great setup. I ordered the mushroom ravioli and the Tequila Mockingbird cocktail; both were delicious. Highly recommend!
2020-08-07,5,My favorite place in Hoboken. Excellent food and great atmosphere. Also the best and most accommodating bar/restaurant in town. Delicious food with great live music that brings together the best of both worlds and all that you could ask for on night out on the town
2020-08-03,5,Great food, great ambiance, and incredible to-go cocktails during COVID!
2020-08-03,4,Had not been to Grand Vin in some time so came here with some friends . Outdoor seating is well laid out and comfortable although the sun still has access to you which can be a challenge if sunny. So we ordered a bunch of apps and mains to share . Firstly, the drinks are wicked strong so that's a plus. If I may be honest, I never cared for the food at Vin previously - that has changed . Everything was excellent  especially the short ribs ( served with risotto ) , sea bass, salad and the gnocchi . Chicken was good but 2nd tier to the others but still good . Service was personable and attentive . All and all - I'm happy to visit again as everything was pleasant . Get the short ribs hands down .
2020-07-18,5,We have been wanting to eat at Grand Vin for a few months now and finally we're able to... all our expectations were completely met! Amazing food, amazing drinks and great service! We sat outside and it was a beautiful night! Definitely would recommend!
2020-07-17,1,Was looking around for a place to get drinks to-go and stumbled upon this place. I had been here a few times to eat and the food is delicious, however, they charged $22 a drink. Absolutely ridiculous. We thought it was an accidental double charge but we actually got robbed. They have no prices on the menu because no one would willingly pay $85 for 4 drinks. I cannot support a business that would be so deceptive and implore you to not patronize this establishment. Shame on Grand Vin
2020-07-14,5,Favorite spot in Hoboken! Dinner is incredible and you can't go wrong with their brunch - mimosa flights and croissant French toast? Say less.
2020-07-08,5,We first ordered Grand Vin for takeout as their outdoor dining wasn't open yet. We ordered the short ribs with Parmesan polenta and it was delicious! The flavor of the ribs and polenta was amazing. The short ribs were fatty, but that's to be expected with that type of meat. I also ordered the rose cocktail to go and it was very fruity and very strong, definitely getting your money's worth. The second time we dined at their patio and decided to try a different dish. We started with their burrata which was so fresh, went very well with the salami. We ordered the chicken parm as an entree and as someone who is extremely picky with chicken parms, this parm was delicious! The sauce was very flavorful, the chicken was crispy, and the roasted cauliflower was a nice accompaniment to the dish. Overall, both experiences I have no complaints. The food was excellent and I can't wait to come back to try their brunch!
2020-07-05,1,At 8:45 pm last night I called to see what time their kitchen is closing. 10:30 is what they told me. Literally called back 10 minutes later for a pick up order (coming from Asbury back to the city) and they would not answer the phone. Clearly they are screening the call. Pulled up at 10:15. A party of 1 sitting by herself and a party of 3 to the right. They said they would take my order. As soon as they sent it to the kitchen the little short cook/chef came out furious and angry at the woman who took my order. He was openly frustrated and I even suggested take my business elsewhere. He said forget and walked off. The dark haired bartender came outside and complained to the table of three (2 females and 1 male) about my late order. Then the waitress said they are out of Risotto and can't make my order (short rib and risotto).Took forever to bring out my modified check & credit card. You would think they would be appreciative of my order granted it was late night still. Can probably get more bang for your buck elsewhere. Don't believe the reviews on here or Google
2020-07-01,5,Great outside dining experience. The staff were amazing, and the outside area they have created is perfect. The food was really really good and the $12 wine flight is great value. Will be back!
2020-06-29,2,I have tried this place a couple of times and I wasn't super impressed by their foods nor drinks. Drinks are considerably overpriced compared to some of the other restaurants in Hoboken (over $10 for brunch cocktails). I tried this place three times all before the pandemic so my review might not be very current. I had their short rib and rigatoni and it was $28 and $20. Short rib was just average braised short rib that wasn't anything special and same with Rigatoni. Nothing special.
2020-06-21,5,Grand Vin has been on my list to try for the longest time and when we moved into town a few months ago I knew it was a must but then everything shut down :( Fortunately, they are doing a wonderful job reopening with outdoor seating. When we heard restaurants were opening we were a bit skeptical but after waiting so long to give Grand Vin a try we decided to let them our first test. And let me tell you it was a great decision. They've built a little outdoor patio but we sat under the awning because the only reservation we could get was at 3:45pm and it was still very hot. Regardless it's super cute. When we went it was not crowded at all and the tables are significantly spread apart. The hostess told us they aren't taking walk ins so it's reservations only and they definitely didn't fill the tables up. We each had a specialty cocktail and they were both delicious (I had the Hazy Tea Yumm). Then we tried the stuffed mushrooms and they are probably the best I've ever had. A must! We shared two entrees - the gnocchi and the sea bass. The gnocchi was good and very creamy (a little bland for me but really can't complain). The sea bass was AMAZING! Literally melted off and melted in your mouth. They also brought out an adorable BIG bowl for the pup. I always appreciate when they treat the pup well. I feel awful that I don't remember the waiters name but he was great as well. Gave us time to decide, had his mask on, was attentive. They're doing great! If you're comfortable, give them a visit and if not get take out. Their food is too good to go too long without!
2020-06-20,5,I've been here a couple times. I would rate this spot as one of the top 3 resturants in Hoboken. The food here is so good, service is great and the ambiance of the place is really nice. You can't go wrong with anything you order. I recently just dined in after resturants started opening for outdoor dining only after the COVID-19 shutdown. They did an excellent job of keeping the tables 6 feet apart and all employees wore mask and gloves at all times.For appetizers, the clams and scallops are really good options. The sauce that the scallops are cooked in is so buttery and savory and the bacon is a perfect compliment to it. The baked clams are also really good. For entrees, any of the pasta dishes are good. The mushroom ravioli is definitely one of my favorite. If you're looking for an entree, I'd go with the short ribs. Meat is cooked to perfection and the it's cooked in a savory sauce. Highly recommend this spot.
2020-06-17,3,I can't really comment on anything other than their takeout cocktails, which I felt was super misleading. The cocktail to go menu is extensive, and I love love loved that they had froze on their menu! However, both drinks in apparently a 16 oz cup size were $25 each. Each were supposedly 2.5 servings, but when we poured them out, the red sangria (with 3/4 of it filled with ice) didn't even cover 1 cup!! Also, as you can tell in the picture, it wasn't even sealed! It was just in a coffee cup with a lid! No tape or anything! The frose covered about 1.5 servings but not really bc in the picture, it's just 1 persons cup. I mean $25 for a cocktail to go is A LOT, especially since it's only 1.5 servings. That's like paying $18 for a single serving in the restaurant. I've gotten a $10 margarita in a bottle (no ice) that's about 16 oz from On The Border, and it filled up 2 full wine glasses for me, and they were strong! I personally will never order to go cocktails from here ever again, but hopefully, they don't rip you off when you dine in the restaurant.
2020-06-13,4,My indoor bar experience has been amazing. Great selection and delicious food. To-go, new Covid menu, is great also...except, once they run out of their to-go packaging, drinks will be served in coffee cups and regular juice bottles. Still tasty but presentation lacking.
2020-06-05,5,We've been frequenting Grand Vin since we moved to Hoboken, 4 years ago. It's been consistently great. But feel compelled to write a review now, after they've opened back up post COVID and having ordered pick up from them twice since. We've been eating a lot of takeout. Also from similar restaurants around town that were always sit down, but have pivoted to takeout given the current situation. And Grand Vin's food is just infinitely better than anything else we've had. They're nailing the takeout game right now. The Chicken Francese I had from our last order was exceptional. I plan to reorder the exact same thing very soon.
2020-03-16,4,We love coming to Grand Vin for any meal or just for drinks. They have the CUTEST ambiance and decor in Hoboken, and it's perfect for a romantic date night or a girls night. They are also excellent about accommodating larger groups or private parties if you contact them in advance.
2020-03-06,5,Grand Vin has one of the best wine selections in Hoboken and they make it incredibly easy for you to try multiple wines without breaking the bank. Tuesday night wine flights are usually heavily poured and always enjoyable. I really love the atmosphere and the food is always on point. Whether you want a full portion or half, grand vin will easily accommodate.
2020-02-27,3,Came here on a Thursday evening to enjoy a glass of wine and light dinner.  I was by myself so I sat at the bar. The decor is cozy and cute enough that I may give this place another chance but I wasn't overly impressed with the service and food.  I could tell the bartender was a little busy, even though the bar wasn't full he was also tending the high top tables which were mostly full.  So I was not surprised that there was no attempt at even a little small talk, but it was a little weird/cold that he did not make eye contact with me once the entire evening. Having only moved here a few months ago maybe I should stop expecting friendly service in this area.  I got the French onion soup and stuffed mushrooms - both good but not overly impressive.
2020-02-23,5,Beautiful place and lively bar! Went at 9:30 pm on a Saturday without a reservation.  We were told the wait would be an hour but was only 30 minutes!  Live music was a big plus.  The scallops and gnocchi were delicious! The only thing to skip is the dessert cookie dough bites! They were rock hard and impossible to eat.  I went to cut into one and it shot across the floor! Other than the dessert, I was very pleased with my experience I would definitely come back and skip dessert.
2020-02-23,1,The food was VERY good....however the front end hostess was a very rude and nasty person! It ruined the entire experience. Twice I tried to take the high road and be nice to her as it was a busy Sunday afternoon. On both occasions she was demeaning and treated myself and our party of 6 like children. Never eating here again. The great food CANNOT make up for the repulsive staff.
2020-02-16,2,Absolutely terrible service from the moment we sat at our table.  Food was fine but nothing special (though my son just got sick so jury still out if that's from dinner or the virus kicking around his school so I won't pass blame yet).  Clearly just looking to push people through service - unfortunate because the place is really cute.
2020-02-16,2,Never again. I drove an hour for this? Food was fine, nothing special. Service was AWFUL. Waitress was rushing us, inattentive, rude. One dish had hair in it. No apology from the waitress. They botched 2 other dishes - obviously not listening. Delivered entrees while apps were still on the table, not bothering to clear them. Take a pass on this place, there are a million other restaurants in Hoboken.
2020-02-16,5,Amazing place. First of all, the decor aesthetic is gorgeous and stays relevant for all seasons. Beautiful greenery and twinkle lights leave a romantic setting. We ordered a carafe of wine but browsed the cocktail menu and will definitely return again to try those! The food is remarkable and perfectly portioned. We ordered the burrata appetizer, short ribs, and tagliatelle. All were amazing. Perfect for a date night out.
2020-02-14,5,Came here a few nights ago and there was a real Macaroni the Clown behind the bar. He was slinging drinks and serving up Piatelli's like the best in the business. Definitely will be back.
2020-02-13,4,Awesome place! We went with a group of friends for brunch on a Sunday. I had the dog & Brie burger which was absolutely delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly, it had fig jam a slice of Brie cheese as well as caramelised onions. The fries on the side were truffle fries which we all loved! A friend had the pulled pork egg Benedict and had only nice things to say about it. We also had the flights of mimosas which consist of 3 - very decent size - glasses of mimosas for $12! The mimosas were apple, orange and grapefruit juices with champagne. The ambience of the restaurant is also really nice and well-thought. One remark would be that, while most of the staff was stellar, our waitress wasn't the nicest person. All in all, a great experience. Would give it 5 stars wasn't it for the waitress polite but cold behavior.
2020-02-13,5,Perfect place for a bridal shower!The Grand Vin is a warm, beautifully decorated bar and restaurant.Once inside you feel welcome in the inviting atmosphere. The back area has plenty of room for a shower or party. There is a wide variety of brunch and/or foods to chose from. The food comes well presented and was delicious!Ann Marie and her staff helped make the bridal shower perfect! The staff is polite, courteous and very professional. I plan to stop in again for drinks and food.
2020-02-05,5,Came for dinner for my boyfriends 30th birthday. While he was in the restroom I was able to coordinate  with our waitress to get us out by a certain time to make it to The Stewed Cow around the corner for his suprise party I had planned. She did just that stayed on top of our drinks and appetizers to dinner times. Although the only thing I will complain or comment on is the host that answers the phone needs better stress management skills, because when I called to book I did it 3 wks prior on a Tuesday night around 5pm and I had a couple of questions and she told me she has people in front of her and doesn't have time to answer my questions. So kinda rude but whatever maybe she was having a bad day but she could've put me on hold and attended to her customers that were standing in front of her and then came back on the phone to answer my questions.
2020-01-28,5,The hostess is always so sweet and helpful! She remembers the people that come in even if they haven't been there  for quite some time. She definitely makes it a very pleasant experience!
2020-01-28,2,Don't come here around the time they open, they never seem ready. They're eating, chatting or on their phones. The  bartender definitely seems bothered if you want a drink and the electronic menu is annoying.  The food is  mediocre at best and there are much better restaurants in Hoboken and definitely Jersey City.  Apparently  they don't  participate in restaurant week either.  The hostess was very nice and the decor is pretty but it's not worth the  price.
2020-01-15,5,Amazing ominous & delicious food. I have been DYING to visit this restaurant & it did not fail my expectations!
2020-01-14,3,Great lunch with my wife and daughter at Grand Vin! It was a Sunday afternoon and the place was jumping ... and loud. But, we had a great time. The drinks were just OK ... I had the Moscow Mule Mimosa and would not recommend it ... very small ... not much taste ... a disappointment. The cabernet was very good. My daughter and I both ordered the Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict ...only to be told they were out of pulled pork ... a disappoinment. Instead, I got the Fig and Brie Burger, which was excellent. And the fries were among the best I have ever had! I'd go back to Grand Vin again, but I'd skip the Moscow Mule Mimosa.
2020-01-07,4,4 of my girlfriends and I went to Grand Vin for Sunday brunch. We made reservations for 1:30 and, of course, some of us were late. However, they still sat us before the rest of our party came. We ordered drinks until the rest arrived. I ordered a Bloody Mary, mimosa carafe for the table, avocado toast benedict, and the breakfast mac 'n cheese. The Bloody Mary was garnished with a bagel with cream cheese - the bagel was dry and cold so I didn't eat more than a bite. The avocado toast Benedict was delicious! The toasted bread, creamy avocado, and poached egg was heaven in one bite. The potatoes were also cooked well: crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The breakfast mac 'n cheese had mushrooms, spicy chorizo, and topped off with two eggs. This was honestly a bit bland even with salt and pepper added to it. I wasn't too impressed by it. One of the girls ordered the chocolate chip cookie dough brownie bomb and they were hard as rocks. After a few minutes, they thawed out a bit and were a little easier to eat. The food took a while to come out. We didn't receive our food until 2:50... so I took off a star for that. Otherwise, the venue is super cute and the wait staff was outstanding! Our server graciously took group photos for us and went above and beyond by staging our table and taking photos from several angles. This is a really cute brunch spot to go with a group of friends.
2020-01-05,4,I've been to Grand Vin a couple times. I love the ambiance of the restaurant and the rustic feel! Every dish I've had here is amazing. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the avocado toast. It really had no exceptional flavor to it, it was very basic. Good, but I wouldn't order it again. I got French toast with blueberries and strawberries and it was so good and my roommate got steak and eggs and it looked absolutely amazing! I was the plating presentation was a little better, but other than that great experience! The service was also very good!
2020-01-01,5,Favorite restaurant in Hoboken. Great decor, amazing food, service and wine! Love when they have live music.
2019-12-23,5,Amazing food! The drinks were awesome, very unique and tasty. The ambiance is beautiful and very romantic. Will definitely be coming back.
2019-12-11,1,I was quite disappointed during my experience here. We walked in on a rainy Sunday -- 2 young adults and 2 adults in their 60s. The place wasn't busy but we stood there several minutes unnoticed. One of us had to walk to the employee entrance of the bar to ask for a table for 4. Once we were seated by the door, we then watched how every single patron after us was rushed over to by staff. No hesitations or delay. And there were different staff members showing the same level of attentiveness that was not shown when we arrived. The table next to us was seated 10 minutes after we arrived but were served their drinks first (mind you they both got Bloody Mary's which require some time and thought to make. We ordered waters and a coffee). They also were asked their order first and ordered and got their food well before us. We eventually got our food when they were finished up their meal and second drink. We even said something about the experience once we saw them order before us thinking that a polite complaint about slow seating and ordering our food after that table would make our server more attentive. That wasn't the case. As we waited a long while for our food, our water ran out but no one came by to check in on us. Again, we had to flag someone, this time a different server to get us water. We were exacerbated at this point and honestly wanted to leave but our food was being made. We all really felt discriminated against. As the only people of color at the restaurant at the time and seemingly the only ones just sitting and waiting unnoticed the whole time, it was hard not to feel isolated and discriminated against. We expressed our frustrations at this point to the second server, who apologized and tried to convince us otherwise. The original server came back after and was cold to us. I do not recommend this place. Food wasn't even good. Despite our experience, we still tipped 20% because I'm sure it was expected for us not to. It was like being in a warped reality there. If you want a Pinterest-esque ambiance that caters to one type of person, definitely visit this place. Otherwise, I highly recommend taking your money and time elsewhere.
2019-12-01,2,I really don't get what all the hype is about here - sure, the atmosphere is nice and aesthetically pleasing but the waitress we had was rude and trying to get us to buy higher priced items and the food is mediocre at best. We got the wine flights which were just ok. My boyfriend got the mushroom ravioli ($24 for 5 ravioli?!?!?) and I got the capellini. Overall, super disappointing and definitely don't plan on returning
2019-11-29,5,I came here for a birthday dinner on a Friday night (6 people because I was told they could not accommodate larger parties- strange). Everything about Grand Vin was perfect from the food to the intimate interior. The dainty floral and fairy light décor was so beautiful without being too crowded/tacky. The space itself is dimly lit- perfect for a more intimate dinner. Even the live music was tasteful and very enjoyable. The food was spectacular. It can be very hard to find vegetarian options at a lot of the fancier restaurants in Hoboken, but Grand Vin had a nice selection and everything was delicious! My favorites were the baked eggplant and the mushroom ravioli (10/10!!!). For the pasta dishes, they allow you to choose if you want a half or whole serving- and I definitely think the half serving would suffice. It was more than enough for the people at my table!
2019-11-26,5,I came here on a Sunday night around 6:30 and it wasn't too crowded which I liked. There was space between myself and other customers, which gave some privacy. Don't even get my started with the interior of the place! Yelp photos do not do justice. It truly is a elegant place with glistening lights everywhere. Its definitely a perfect romantic spot, which is where me and fiancé decided to celebrate our anniversary. The food is great and I recommend the papardelle.. sooo delicious:)
2019-11-26,5,The restaurants ambiance is very nice and romantic. In addition to the live entertainment it really creates a mood that is enjoyable. The food is also very good I recommend the gnocchi!
2019-11-23,1,, I miss 3A's! Best Lobster ravioli that was prepared in a dreamy butter Citroen sauce! EXCELLENT! Always on the mark- consistency! I know that you think Cos left you the recipe an maybe he did. Unfortunately something missing!! Maybe it's Hospitally? Small details due matter! Best of luck!
2019-11-14,4,So far the prettiest restaurant in Hoboken with very chic decor. We tried four different cocktails and all of those were amazing! For appetizers, we tried Pan seared scallops in bacon sauce which was delicious and for entree we got Mushroom ravioli which was average but would go again for drinks and appetizers!
2019-11-05,5,Great vibe! Tuesday nights are the best with the live entertainment and $12 wine flights. The French onion soup is a must-try!
2019-11-05,1,Cancels my order after it sat open for 30 minutes. Completely wasted my evening waiting for the food to arrive and now I have to scramble and figure out something else.
2019-11-02,3,Good vibes, nice place for a date night if you want to have wine. But I was disappointed with the food - slightly overpriced and wasn't worth it. I'd say food was mediocre at best.
2019-10-27,5,Cutest place ever!!!! Live music, amazing ambiance, great food and drinks! No wonder this place is always packed- they deserve it !!!!
2019-10-21,3,Good wine selection, decent menu, iffy service and unprofessional staff. If nothing else the above us always consistent. I go here for the cute decor, wine and apps and always leave annoyed with their young and very loose staff. Management should probably address how their waitresses hang out and are very lax / not on top of actually serving guests ... eating in the restaurant and licking their fingers right before going over to take an order as if they're not on the job. Very odd behavior for a pricy joint
2019-10-20,5,Love this place!  The atmosphere is good and the food is delicious!  I went with a group of girlfriends on a Tuesday night and we were pleased to learn it was "wine flight" night. Flights of 3 wines, all good pours, were $9-12.   We ordered several apps - artichoke was the best.  Stuffed mushrooms were good. Fig guac was just okay - probably because the chips were a bit stale.  Many of the girls had pasta and all thought it was good. Two of is had the short ribs and they were melt in your mouth yummy and not too fatty.
2019-10-08,5,I've been to Grand Vin a few times, but must say as a Celiac, the gluten free pasta is ridiculously good in terms of all the fixings and seasonings. I love heading there in the summer to sit outside, enjoy some food and a nice glass of wine or a cocktail. My coworkers and I recently had our team dinner there a few months ago, and even the entrees aside from pasta are fabulous. Try the salmon, you'll clean the plate! Service is friendly - atmosphere is warm and inviting. I'm looking forward to going back during their happy hour to try out some oysters and more!
2019-10-06,4,Cozy neighborhood wine bar! Great spot to visit when you want to stay local, food and service was great. My girlfriends stopped in on a Sunday night, we shared the Burrata app, veal meatballs, and a small pasta order. Would recommend this hidden gem!
2019-09-30,5,I just went here twice in one weekend for drinks! There is both indoor and outdoor seating which is great. It is a trendy and chill vibe, definitely a good spot for a date night. The staff was so friendly and super accommodating. Even though it is a wine bar, there are also a lot of delicious cocktails as well. The cheese board selection is also out of this world! I loved it here, I will definitely be back!
2019-09-26,5,What a great place! There are so many reasons I love grand vin. The atmosphere is awesome (cute rustic decor with a perfect live band!) The wine and cocktails are fantastic (and a good selection of both). But most importantly the food is delicious. The best calamari in Hudson county without a doubt. I'm a vegetarian and they always let me make modifications to meals. I love this place.
2019-09-22,5,The food was delicious, they offer half portions which is plenty. The ambiance is nice as well. The service could have been better we waited about 30 min just for the check and didn't get asked if we needed refills on our drinks.
2019-09-19,5,LOVE this spot. The decor inside the restaurant is beautiful and warm. Make sure to get the pasta with scallops and the vodka sauce. Got the chicken Parm with prosciutto! So good. The wine selection is great too!
2019-09-17,5,Definitely one of my favorite places in Hoboken. My favorite times to go are flight night on Tuesdays (a variety of wine flights and charcuterie boards) and brunch on the weekends. Their food is amazing and their wine is also exceptional. This past Tuesday was especially great because we had an amazing waitstaff and a great host Karina. You are always felt welcomed here!
2019-09-15,4,Great wine selection amazing Italian food live music and great service. What more can you ask for
2019-09-06,4,Grand Vin is an Uptown Hoboken landmark. My partner and I arrived here mid-week for a little date night. The menu is exciting with many options on it, specifically my favorite, seafood. However, on this night my partner and I opted for a pasta dish coupled with some seafood. Both were excellent, and the service was friendly but not too professional, which given the neighborhood nature of the establishment makes sense and makes for a comfortable dining experience. This cannot go without being said. The pasta dishes are HUGE. If I am not mistaken there is an option for a half portion, do yourself a favor and got with that one. It is almost enough for two people. This spot is a classic date night spot either for first dates or night out on the town with your significant other.
2019-08-30,5,This place is special for my fiancé and I! We went on our first date here, celebrated 2 years here, and our engagement here! We've been many times between these celebrations and they never disappoint! Great ambiance, food, drinks (wine and cocktails). They often have live music which is so nice!
2019-08-28,4,This place is really a hidden gem in Hoboken! Being far from Washington Street I think it is less explored as many of the options available right when you enter Hoboken. Regardless it is a very good spot for food or happy hour with friends! The decor is well thought out and cozy with string lights all around and cute center pieces! I would say the menu is a bit limited for vegetarians but overall the food is very good. We had the fries to share along with mashed potatoes as appetizers. Followed by a main course of the gnocchi. Was a very potato filled dinner, but delicious! Personally for me, the truffle fries stole the cake! About a block away there's street parking available that has meters, other than that it is all residential parking so be careful if you're parking near there! You can also park on Washington and then walk down if that's easier, because the walk isn't too bad to make it all.
2019-08-26,5,Loved this place! It doesnt look like much on the outside but its very cute inside and comfortable to sit outdoors. Great prices for Hoboken in my opinion. We got the make your own cheese board to start and a carafe of red wine. For entrees we ordered the chimichurri steak and the pasta with chicken and bacon- both were amazing! Total bill came out to less than $100, great deal!
2019-08-20,5,This place is super cute.  I went for my birthday and they gave us the best table! The server Ricky (not sure if I spelled that right) was very friendly and super knowledgeable about the wine!  Excellent organic wine selection and she discussed the differences between them.  The food was good.  There was a singer who sang acoustic songs and the whole vibe was on point.
2019-08-15,3,About the food:We ordered the calamari for the appetizer which was very tasteful and fresh. As the entree, we both ordered the special which was filet mignon (both medium). The presentation wasn't our favorite and the texture of the filet was more medium well than it was medium. The plating of the filet mignon did not reflect its price, over all it wasn't visually appealing. We didn't hate our meal but we didn't love it either. About the drinks:I got the wine tasting! It was my favorite part of the niht! Terrific idea! About the atmosphere:Absolutely beautiful! Super cute decor and lighting. The tables are a bit to close together which causes you to squeeze in order to get to your seats. About the service:My boyfriend and I went here on a Tuesday night. We got there at about 9:45pm at that time the hostess notified us that the kitchen was closing. I saw her speak to a woman who appeared to me the owner or manager and she said sure let them sit let's give them 20 minutes. I, well we appreciated that since she could have simply denied us. That was a great first impression! Thank you.
2019-08-10,4,Cool atmosphere. Service was lacking. Wasn't a fan of the ravioli but my partner loved his meal.... burrata was great and they have a big selection of wine.
2019-08-05,5,Literally the best place for a date night or brunch  in Hoboken. The wine is incredible and they have awesome specials during the week.Definitely try going on a Tuesday night because they do $12 wine flights! Super worth it. The brunch is also awesome. Try their breakfast mac n cheese or the avocado toast benedict. You won't regret it. The food is just excellent all around. It's consistently delicious. Our favorite is the pappardelle with the scallops! The cheese board is a must & if you're really hungry also try the fig guacamole or the calamari as appetizers! Can't wait to go back! Probably next week, ha!
2019-08-02,2,It's just ok.The place was at 2/3 capacity but we waited for about an hour for our entrees...no apologies or anything at all. After such a long wait, we expected the food to be great, but it was srsly just ok.The interior is nice. But in my opinion, didn't worth the $$$.Probably won't come back.
2019-07-26,5,One of my favorite spots in Hoboken. Their wine flight is never a bad decision and you cant go wrong with the kale salad or charcuterie and cheese board. The food and service are always very good as is the live music. Their brunch is also nice if they aren't booked for a private event.
2019-07-22,2,Have been a couple of times but had a particularly poor brunch recently. Started with the attitude of the hostess when we asked to move one table over from a loud group as we were being seated.  This brings up the second issue, it is LOUD in there.  Even at 2/3 capacity you either have to yell or learn sign language to talk to your party.  There has to be some paneling or something that can install to mute it in there.So we try and order and they're 1, out of the wine we ordered... ok that happens, but then 2, out of kale for the kale salad.... yikes.  So they substitute for it.  All of the food comes out fine.  Seemingly well priced, but the dishes are quite small.  I got a sandwich that was mostly bread with the thinnest chicken you've ever seen and didn't taste like much.  So overall on the food, it was fine but no reason to go.  Wine might be good... if they have it (also, why have an electronic wine list if you don't keep it updated?)Server took forever to bring and then process the bill... which was annoying given how loud it was and how much I just wanted to get out of there!
2019-07-21,3,Food was delicious and the place was adorable and intimate. However, the only downfall was the night we dined there - a very hot night in July - their air conditioning was not working properly and it was uncomfortably hot in the restaurant- to the point where my boyfriend kept having to get up and walk outside to cool off. He was sweating at the table and it was hard to enjoy the delicious food in these conditions. Our surrounding tables were also complaining of the temperature and humidity in the restaurant. We finally asked the waitress if there was something wrong with the air and she said there was but not sure what exactly. She did apologize, however I feel that being that we had to cut our dinner short due to being so uncomfortable she could have sent over a dessert (for example ice  cream) as an apology since it was our first time dining there and didn't have the best experience. I think the service could definitely use improvement. We felt nauseous the rest of the night after our dinner. Probably won't return until the winter time!
2019-07-20,5,I went to Grand Vin with my friend for brunch, and we had a great time. The decor was so cute and they had fresh flowers on each of the tables. We tried their apple mimosa and it was delicious! The service was also great!
2019-07-18,4,I went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary and was not disappointed. The food was excellent and there were a variety of wines to choose from. My boyfriend is not really a wine drinker but he found that there were plenty of other alternatives for him to drink. The only reason that I did not give five stars was due to slow service. By the end of our meal it did get a little more crowded so it was completely understandable. I would 100% come back for another meal.
2019-07-18,5,Finally had dinner here after living in the area for 3 years and I'm so upset I haven't tried it sooner. Great place to impress my parents for a night out as well. Nice rustic decor, great service, and some amazing CBD drinks! I had a perfectly good seared swordfish piccata and Parmesan orzo . So good and I'd definitely go back to try other menu items.
2019-07-18,2,Food was excellent. Service was terrible.  Our waiter I think hated us. Half the night wee were discussing why the service was so bad.  The live music was a nice touch. We finally had to get the Manager to help us.  Maybe our waiter was just having a bad night.  I tried to cheer him up and say something funny and nice. My girlfriend laughed. The waiter looked at her and said, "Why are you laughing?!" In a really mean tone. And she was like. "I laugh at everything he says. But it was just really off putting.  I also work in the service industry and know everyone can have a bad night, but it was my first time there, and I probably won't go back. Food on the other hand was five star. Both Sea bass and Steak were really good and I would recommend.
2019-07-17,5,Great service and food! We had to look up a restaurant to have dinner last minute, and Grand Vin turned out to be an amazing choice. Will definitely come back.
2019-07-17,5,I've come to this place a few times and it is a great experience every time!!! Only once have I walked through the doors and the place wasn't jam packed (I managed to get the very first dinner reservation, but it was full within mins). Try and make a reservation!! They do have outside seating but I have never experienced it. Tuesday is a good night for the wine flights, "$1" oysters and the cheese w/ meat pairings, but every night they have some form of happy hour special. The atmosphere I've noticed, changes, if you're looking for a quieter dinner or have children be sure to go a little earlier in the evening. The service is great! Everyone is very attentive.
2019-07-14,4,Loved our brunch today- it was hot but they brought out carafe's of water and even a bowl of ice water for the puppy I'm dog sitting! We enjoyed our food, we tried the avocado fries, the grilled chicken BLAT, and shrimp tacos. Everything was pretty fresh and came out in a timely manner. Our serve Ricky, could not have been friendlier. My friend who has a dairy allergy was assured nothing had dairy and she even double checked to make sure aioli was ok with back kitchen. I wished our truffle fries were crunchier, but they seemed a bit healthier. Highly recommend this spot, out door seating was so great and I love the ambiance even more inside! Very romantic and cozy- great spot!! Ps. They don't really take reservations, but call ahead to ask about availability!
2019-07-06,5,One of the best places to come and eat in Hoboken. I don't just throw around that type of title lightly either but this place hits the mark. There is a lot of average places in Hoboken so it was great to see Grand Vin open up a few years ago. The vibe in here is modern and fun. You can come for pretty much any occasion. I have been here a bunch for engagement parties, birthdays, etc. I would make a reservation though since it is packed most of the time.  I hear they also do private parties as well. When you come you have to try the eggplant parmesan. If you don't like eggplant you will like it after eating it here. They also have good specials and a lot of good italian dishes. This is a favorite of my wifes too when she goes out for girls nights. It has a good wine selection and the servers make good selections if you aren't sure. Come check it out.
2019-07-01,4,The food was good but the cocktails were even better. We started with the burrata and the fig guacamole. The guacamole was nothing special. For entrees, the rigatoni was delicious but very rich/creamy and the pappardelle was good. We had the chocolate peanut butter pie and the cookie/brownie bombs for dessert. I'd get the pie again.Our server was patient/helpful and the restaurant was accommodating with modification requests.
2019-06-12,1,Worst experience among all the places i have been to. Was about to leave waiting for food for over an hour, then the waitress came and told us the food is ready. The pasta was salty and we had to return the food back after waiting for one hour. Over all horrible, if possible i would have given 0 star the 1 star is for the ambience of the place.
2019-06-12,1,Terrible service!! Food tastes good but you literally will starve for it! My husband and me waited for over an hour for 2 pastas. Hopefully it will be here soon ( I am writing the review as I continue to wait for my food ). No one pays any attention to the fact that your order is super delayed nor can we grab anyone's attention to ask for the status of our order!! Doesn't look like I will come back to this place.
2019-06-02,5,My favorite restaurant in Hoboken! Anytime people come to town this is my go to spot and it never disappoints. I've only had dinner and or drinks here but I've heard the brunch is equally as good.
2019-06-02,5,The Grand Vin is absolutely beautiful. It is well decorated and has a great ambiance. The staff at this restaurant are very kind and welcoming.They were very accommodating. I like that they allow you to be seated even if the rest of your party is not there yet.  I started with a glass of rose and fried calamari. The sauce that came with the fried calamari was excellent. I ordered papperdelle for my entree and it was good. For dessert I had a chocolate chip ice cream sandwich. It was delicious and a good dessert to share with one other person. The menu is a little small but they have enough to satisfy people who are gluten free and vegetarian.  This is a great restaurant for celebrations.
2019-05-29,4,Love this place!  The decor is amazing and so is the food.  Might be slightly on the pricey side for Hoboken but there also aren't many places better, if any.  I've been there multiple times but the dish I get the most is the short ribs.  They are incredible!  You can pull them right apart with your fork and it's served with a Parmesan Risotto that is mouth watering.  This is also a great place for brunch and they have a great selection of wines.  Also the S'mores sundae for dessert!  You'll thank me later!
2019-05-23,1,We brought friends from Australia who arrived at the restaurant before us. When we arrived, the hostess told us they they thought our table guests were 'back there'. Usually, the hostess walks you to the table? We ordered cocktails, appetizers, dinner and wine.  The food was good but the service was lacking. Plates picked up before food was finished is an understatement. However, after being at the table for an hour and a half and spending nearly $400,  a man came to our table abruptly and told us we had to leave as he needed the table? We were shocked and embarrassed for our guests. No mention was ever made to us when we made the reservations or when we arrived that the table was needed later. We left and called later to express our frustration. The manager informed us that it was in fact him who booted us from  the table?!! He said he felt pressure from the next guests? He also said " he would make it up to us when we came back". Ah, we won't be back. I guess business is good and they don't need repeat business.
2019-05-13,4,Went here yesterday and sat at the bar.  Had the Smokey bourbon which was awesome! The bartender smoked the glass and put a slice of lemon, a dark cherry and a big square ice cube..i don't drink often but that was soooooo good! All I needed was one drink, smooth and strong! For appetizers I had a mix of the meatballs, eggplant rollatini, and tuna tartare.  The meatballs were my favorite.  The sauce was so awesome.  Everything was delicious! The atmosphere of this place is very cozy and romantic. For my entree I had the pappardelle.  It was good but very heavy! Don't get me wrong I had a lot of appetizers but next time id want to try the skirt steak! I definitely suggest coming here on a date night or catching up with an old friend.  Great place to talk and the music isn't too loud!  Great drinks and amazing food!
2019-04-25,5,Great food and a solid wine selection. I've tried several different dishes and they've all been good. The restaurant can sometimes be a bit noisy and I would recommend getting a reservation, but it's definitely one of my go-to places when we want a nice meal in Hoboken.
2019-04-19,5,Adorable spot, great food. What's not to like?! Went for an early Sunday dinner. The wait staff was friendly and helpful. Wine was delicious. Would absolutely go again and recommend to anyone looking for a nice dinner spot.
2019-04-17,5,Awesome food, drinks and atmosphere. I tried de ribs with mashed potatoes and the tequila mockingbird, and I absolutely loved it! The live music was really good too. I am totally coming back!
2019-04-14,1,Thief bartender was running me a tab even though I was paying cash each round and then held my cash for the last round hostage for fifteen minutes. Also way overpriced.
2019-04-07,2,I've been here a few times before and had a great experience, but tonight was truly disappointing. We arrived around 8:40 and sat by the bar. A bartender threw a tablet menu our way - subtract a star for the cheesiness of the tablet menu off the bat. We then took a glance and were ready to order asap but took another 15 minutes to get someone's attention.We ordered 2 glasses of wine and then the bartender hands a food menu towards us, and  before we can take it from her she takes it back and says something like "you're not ordering food right?sorry the kitchen is closing in two minutes." I had wanted to get a little cheese plate with the wine, so she demanded I make my decision on the spot, and I did without complaining. Fast forward to an hour later, and she brings us the bill unprompted.  Since it's 10pm and the place closes at 11 (per Google and their Yelp page), my boyfriend asks if we can order one more glass of wine each before closing the tab. She tells us shes been instructed to close down - even though there were 3 other parties still sitting with full drinks. This used to be a favorite for a nice glass of wine and some snacks, but I guess not anymore.
2019-04-07,4,This is one of the best spots in Hoboken. The experience will likely be determined by your server (some are better than others), but The food seems to consistently get better, great ambience, and great wine selection. Difficult to get a reservation!
2019-04-06,2,My husband and I want to grab a couple glasses of wine and food so we decide to go to grand Since they had great reviews. It was about 4pm and I expect a nice classy restaurant but I was sadly mistaken. There was a bunch of frat boys screaming and cursing while everyone was trying to enjoy there food (not to mention the kids that were around). My check was over $100 and I just did not expect that kind of behavior. I wanted to enjoy my meal.
2019-04-05,2,Good food, terrible service. I was taken here to a surprise engagement celebration after my fiancé proposed to me with my closest friends, so this was always a place I'll remember. The food is great, but I visited with my family this week and we had a terrible experience.  On March 24th I made a reservation for April 5 with my family to celebrate a birthday.. when we showed up they told us they didn't have our reservation but they would be able to seat us in 45 mins. It wasn't so bad so we decided to wait, even though we knew we called and made the reservation for the right day.   After waiting 1.5 hours they kept telling us we would sit shortly it never happened. Then after we saw a large party that the host initially claimed "had our table" got up, they still didn't seat us. To make it worse, it was a birthday dinner which I specified when making the reservation over the phone because they didn't show availability online for parties over 5. My whole family ended up having to go to another restaurant and the staff was rude. Ruined my birthday dinner after having such a good experience there the time before.
2019-04-05,1,They dont honor reservations, even though they'll take them - be prepared to wait. We had a reservation for 8 and by 10 we still were'nt seated.
2019-04-05,5,My boyfriend and I go to Grand Vin every Friday after work as our favorite way to start the weekend. The atmosphere is very dark but also has a very feminine touch, with good music as well as good beer, and fantastic cocktails and food.We always sit at the bar and share two appetizers along with cocktails, and today we shared the stuffed shrimp and small portion of raviolis. In short both were phenomenal.The shrimp came with three pieces stuffed with mozzarella, prosciutto and spinach, and it came out with a delicious fragrance of garlic. The dish was filled was so many flavors including cheeses, garlic and lemon juice.  I just wish there were 4 pieces of shrimp instead of 3 since it was the two of us sharing.  The small ravioli portion was perfect, it was stuffed with cheese and sausage and the red sauce had the perfect amount of sweetness. The light ricotta and sweet sausage was a good balance with the heavy sauce and light pasta.Overall we absolutely love Grand Vin and plan to come here every Friday forward. Thanks as always for having us!
2019-04-05,5,My absolute favorite restaurant/bar in all of Hoboken. The bartenders are mixologists and make fantastic cocktails. All the guys i know love the smoky old fashioned and i love the fruity cocktails. Their pasta is great and they sell half orders which is definitely enough to fill me up without finishing. Love the decor, the vibe, the food, and the live music. Perfect place for a date night.If youre not a fan a 90's music you may not like it as its the most popular cover music. Place is definitely geared to the older more sophisticated Hoboken crowd and I love it.
2019-04-01,5,I have been here a couple of times. Once, for Valentine's Day prefix dinner and another time for brunch. The place is very classy and perfect for a date night. Had great experience both the times. I had croissant French toast with Nutella, easily the best one I have had ever. It was crispy, crunchy and super tasty. My husband liked his chicken burger too. The fries were super delicious. I just wish there were more vegetarian/vegan friendly options. But other than that, the food quality and taste is really good.
2019-03-29,5,I came here on March 10th to celebrate my best friends birthday. Excellent service and helped me make that night special for both of us! The food was great and the live music was wonderful. Would come here again ASAP.
2019-03-26,5,Went here with my boyfriend on a Friday night without a reservation and were told it would be about a 2-2.5 hour wait for 2 so we decided to sit at the bar.  It ended up taking over an hour for a spot at the bar to open up but the live music helped to pass the time.  We started with the stuffed mushrooms and brussel sprouts gratin, both were delicious.  We then ordered half orders the papperdelle and rigitoni, again both were delicious and very generously portioned.  Everything that we ordered exceeded all of my expectations.Will definitely make a reservation to return in the near future!
2019-03-24,5,I came here yesterday the 23rd with a large party to celebrate my birthday and we had an amazing time. We made the reservations about 2.5 weeks ahead since the place is not large and we had 13 of us but they were able to seat us comfortably and on time. The place had a great vibe, live music, a nice little bar area, ​and the food was delicious!!! I had the Gnocchi. I can't​ remember our servers​ name but she had glasses and a curly bun and was GREAT. The restaurant​itself​f had a nice vibe and was decorated really cute. Would defintitely come back / recommend friends to come here :)
2019-03-17,4,Great brunch menu! Haven't been here for dinner yet, but definitely will have to check it out soon.The homemade fried mozzarella and prosciutto is delicious...like a mozzarella stick but better! For my entree, I ordered the Avocado Toast Benedict which was so good. The crispy bacon on top was definitely the best part.While the food was great, the service was so slow. We waited almost an hour for our entrees, and we probably would've gotten another round of drinks but our waitress never came back.
2019-03-16,5,We did shared plates! Which is a nice option, they have small or regular pasta portions. Got the "everything spice" Calamari it was good just wish it was more everything spice, at times it was like eating regular calamari. Brussel sprouts salad was great. The four cheese gnocchi was so fluffy and fabulous but it is a stinky cheese so you have to get over that when it first arrives. Overall good experience and I would definitely go back. Restaurant turns over around 10 and live music goes on which is a great touch!
2019-03-11,5,From the atmosphere to the food...everything was amazing! The cutest place with such a great vibe. The food and service was spectacular. I had the shrimp risotto and my friend got the skirt steak. The steak was delicious!!! Will definitely be coming back anytime I'm in jersey.
2019-02-24,5,Great place for brunch! This place has great vibes. The decor is really cute. Service/food was good. I definitely want to go back for their dinner menu!
2019-02-21,4,The restaurant is beautiful with a great vibe but the entrees were average at best. We both agreed the appetizers (baked eggplant & burrata) were good but neither of us cared for our main dish. We ordered halibut (special) $34 and gnocchi and were both unimpressed. The side of potatoes was the best of it & may be some of the best I ever had, I would probably go back for that alone. GV offers flight wine at happy hour but 1 of the glasses of the 3 wasn't good, I don't know if it was the glass that smelled bad or if it was the wine. The desserts were below average. Don't order the brownie ice cream , I should have sent that back but didn't want to bother our waitress. Our service was good, we never had to look for our waitress or anything. They play music and even have a live singer. Personally, I prefered the radio over the singer but it is nice they have music at all.
2019-02-20,4,Beautiful place good service .Best eggplant parm I've had in a long time and the 4 cheese potatoes were out of this planet and the house wine was very good for house wine .Had the halibut which was ok nothing special and the desserts were average but we had a great time and would definitely go back .Good reasonable spot in Hoboken
2019-02-11,5,2 years since my first review of Grand Vin and its still my favorite Hoboken restaurant! I compare everything to it. I like to try new restaurants with one of my girlfriends and at the end of every meal we give it the "Grand Vin test". If we would have rather eaten at Grand Vin then we cross it off our list and never go back lol
2019-02-10,2,This was our first time going and the food was delicious. However, the service left a lot to be desired for. This would be a 5 star rating if the service was better. First the host did not even greet us she was too busy looking down on her phone. Took us to a table in between 2 other couples when the rest of the restaurant was empty. We asked to move and she was less than friendly about it. The server was very polite and definitely knew her menu and wine. However, needs better organization or at least servers helping each other with things as simple as refilling the water, especially because the restaurant was not busy and there were servers sitting down at the bar on their phones. The food was delicious and fresh and came fairly quickly we had the Chilean seabass and the short ribs and both perfectly cooked. Also the flourless chocolate cake was soooo good and creamy and the server did offer a wine tasting to go with the dessert which was nice. But it kills the whole experience when all you see is the bartender, the host and the servers on their phone sitting down, yet we were waiting to be taken care of. We would definitely go again because the food was very good and original and the decor made you feel like you were somewhere in Italy. However, the service needs a great deal of improvement if it wants to succeed in an over crowded restaurant scene like the one in Hoboken.
2019-02-10,4,The decor is very inviting.  We came for brunch on a Sunday.  The service was prompt and gracious.  We had bloody Mary's and a Moscow mule.  Everyone was happy with their drinks.  I had eggs Benedict on a portobello mushroom with asparagus and a side of sautéed potatoes: delicious!  The fig and Brie burger got raves.  The chicken sandwich and brunch burger also got good reviews.  We all enjoyed this meal and would return.
2019-02-09,4,Tasty brunch/Americana joint. Nice rustic decor and friendly service. Food was good too. Moscow Mule Mimosa - tasty and gave me a buzz. It did its job well. Brie & Fig Burger - savory and cooked perfectly. Kale Salad - that turned into an arugula salad bc they ran outta kale... wifey seemed happy w it. "Thick Cut" Bacon Strips - regular run of the mill bacon strips. Not the thick Canadian bacon I was expecting hence the quotations. Truffle Fries - who doesn't love truffle oil or fries??Chorizo Mac & Cheese - unexpectedly tasty and addicting. I ate more than I wanted to and was happily full for longer :)
2019-02-07,5,10/10 came for a friends birthday and all 6 of us left so full and pleased with the service and amazing food. Tuesday's are live music and $12 wine flights. Can't beat it
2019-02-05,5,Been to this spot again and love it still! Came for wine on a Saturday night and the vibes were great. Lots of young people and polite service! Great spot for a nice drink on a low key night in addition to a great meal if you come for dinner!
2019-02-05,4,What a little gem in Hoboken!  Upon entering, I immediately fell in love with the ambiance and vibe. The food thus far is above average and hasn't disappointed the 2 times I've gone. Great food, romantic/chill setting for a nice evening of relaxing
2019-01-28,5,Great food, amazing customer service. Located in a quiet area in Hoboken, which has great street parking. HighlyRecommended.
2019-01-26,5,My favorite restaurant in Hoboken. Difficult to get reservations sometimes but the food is amazing and the drinks are great. A+
2019-01-26,5,This is probably my favorite Italian restaurant in New Jersey! If you are going to Hoboken, this is the place to do it ! Great service and great food !
2019-01-22,5,We had a really good time at Grand Vin for dinner. Make a reservation, otherwise you'll be waiting awhile. The hosts are cordial on the phone and make you feel welcome in person. They're great with updates on the status of your table and will invite you to grab a drink at the bar while you wait.We got a table all the way in the back, which was nice. Overall I felt comfortable with the space. Service was also attentive and friendly. I never felt like I needed anything since they were so quick and proactive. We started with some cocktails and also had an order of burrata as well as 4 meats and 2 cheeses for the charcuterie board. Great presentation and everyone really liked the spread. For entree, I had the pappardelle with scallops. Great texture on the homemade pasta, the tomato cream sauce was on the lighter side, and the scallops were nicely cooked as well. I went for the full order, which was a mistake. It was a huge portion and I wasn't able to take any home - so in hindsight I'd go with the smaller portion next time. I give 5 stars because they've got great front of house, ambiance, menu selection, service, and food. I'll definitely be back and will recommend to anyone.
2019-01-21,4,I hadn't been to Grand Vin in a while, but I was pleasantly surprised when my boyfriend and I met up with some of his friends for an early brunch. We were an early reservation, but wouldn't be seated until our party was full (we were missing a couple people, which was no sweat for us, but keep in mind when you go). All but two of us ordered cocktails, but in any event, service for drinks was a bit on the slow side. We all ordered different things, but as for me and my boyfriend, we both went with the truffle omelette.Portions were sizable, but not at Cheesecake Factory levels. The omelette particularly was cooked thoroughly, with chunks of mushrooms and bits of spinach really shining through and bringing in the texture and flavor. The cheddar cheese was orange and salty, but not at all in a bad way. Personally, I could only taste smaller hints of truffle, but maybe that was intentional? The accompanying home fries were fabulous, a standout that didn't always need ketchup despite the fact that I used it regardless.Overall, a must-try for brunch in Hoboken!
2019-01-15,5,Impressive place. Much more than a wine bar and one of the better charcuteries in hoboken. Good for a dinner and/or date.
2019-01-13,4,Had an excellent dinner here recently! It was a Friday night and very crowded. We made a reservation, which I would highly recommend. It was a little loud inside and they had live music which didn't really help. The bar area is very lively, but the dining area was a little quieter. Our server was awesome and very friendly. The food was fantastic! We started with the shrimp, calamari, and buratta. The buratta was particularly good. I had the shrimp risotto and loved it! The shrimp was very fresh. They also had a good wine selection and cocktail list. The only downsides were the noise level and that we waited for our table for 20 minutes even though we had a reservation.
2019-01-08,4,Love this spot - good music, but not too loud!!! Plenty of seating. Great drinks from a friendly and attentive barkeep. Can't wait to go back.
2019-01-06,5,Let me just say AMAZING! Great service, great vibe and great food! My friends and I all went so we pretty much got one of everything on the menu so I got to try out majority of the food. The sea bass was my favorite, but everything else was amazing as well. This is a great date night or a ladies night out. I will definitely be coming back soon!
2018-12-29,3,The three stars are for food, decor and ambiance and two deducted for service.  Such a shame. Excruciatingly slow service.  First time at dinner and we had early reservations so the place was less than half full.  Today for lunch same experience - took 30 minutes to get our drinks after speaking to the hostess twice.  It's really unfortunate as the servers are pleasant and knowledgeable but disappear for long periods or are just inattentive.
2018-12-23,3,3-1/2 star, came here with my family on Saturday, the nice hostess was nice to accommodate our party of 9.  We didn't have a reservation but was seated 45 minutes.  It was first time there for brunch, overall the food was good.  My husband and mom ordered the steak and egg, the steak was cooked perfectly and juicy.  I wish I had ordered that because my omelet was overcooked.  The truffle fries were good,  Mac n cheese was good too. The Bloody Mary was nice and spicy!  I definitely recommend Grand Vin and will go back.
2018-12-21,5,Grand Vin is a problem. Everything on the menu sounds so damn good that it's impossible to order. Unique pastas, meat and seafood entrees, a huge variety of small plates, meats and cheeses, salads... the list goes on and on.After marveling over the menu for several minutes we all decided to go with the skirt steak topped with chimichurri and served with a side of broccoli rabe. But of course there were also apps in the mix. Our group split a cheese plate with prosciutto, sopressata, gruyere, truffle goat and a brie/blue mix. The truffle goat was definitely the star of the plate. The brie blue was a little stinky for my taste. My only complaint is that the cheese plate only came with two crackers - I wish there were more! We also ordered the Brussels sprouts au gratin. The portion was huge and came with a deep dish of Brussels sprouts topped with melty cheese and bacon. Hot. Damn.Okay, back to that steak that I mentioned earlier. The skirt steak was buttery and cooked to perfection. The chimichurri added a delicious flavor and the portion of both steak and broccoli was generous. The food is enough to warrant a five star experience, but I'll also mention that wines on tap were on a $7 special all night long. Oh, and the decor is spectacular. The walls and ceiling are adorned with tons of hanging string lights and ornaments. I highly suggest visiting around the holidays because of how cozy it is!Our night ended on a sweet note with chocolate brownie cookie dough bombs. They were in fact bomb. Except I wish that they were a little less frozen because they were hard to cut.I'm looking forward to returning again and again. Specifically on a Tuesday when they offer wine flights and 3 dollar cheese pairings.
2018-12-20,5,My night was pretty much perfect, complete with good steak and good wine in what is basically a winter wonderland. Grand Vin is the perfect place for any kind of dinner out. We came on Wednesday for an early dinner, about 5:00 and got to fully take in the magic that this place created with their holiday decorations. It's actually really wonderful. We started off with wines from their happy hour menu as we perused the menu. (Wines on tap or $7 on Wednesdays). The three of us decided when you see a meat and cheese board, you order it. And that we did. You get to choose from a list and you can have as many or as few options as you'd like, priced accordingly. As a started we also feasted on the Brussel Sprouts Gratin, which were covered in cheese in all their glory. Before our waitress came over to take our dinner order, we all had very different dishes in mind, but with one question about the steak, that was no more. Three Skirt Steaks it was and ohhhhhh myyyyyy godddddd. These steaks were incredible. Very thin and cooked so perfectly. It came with an avocado chimichurri on top and broccoli rabe on the side. Oy that was a good steak. Cut like buttah, as my mom would say. We ended the night with the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Brownie Bombs. They were as much a mouthful as their name. It was a great dinner and I can't wait to come back.
2018-12-19,5,Grand Vin has quickly become our favorite restaurant in Hoboken. The service is amazing, the wine selection is phenomenal and the ambience is so cozy and warm. Our favorite pasta dishes include the homemade gnocchi and the rigatoni. The Chicken with burrata is also hard to beat. Highly recommend!
2018-11-25,4,Had a wonderful dinner last evening. The service was great! We had a 7:45 reservation for 4, but asked to change it to 5 upon our arrival. The host accommodated us without a problem! The atmosphere was warm and cozy on a cold, rainy evening. The Brussels sprouts salad was delicious! Everyone enjoyed the pasta dishes and love the fact you can get a smaller portion. The warm bread and pesto was an added bonus!
2018-11-22,4,Love this place!  The wine selection is amazing and the atmosphere makes you want to stay longer and longer. Staff is kind and diligent on their service as we never had an empty glass but not pushy.  The salmon was amazing!  We will be back for sure!!!
2018-11-20,5,A really cute spot to take your significant other.  I took my wife here for her birthday and she absolutely loved everything.  It was a little busy but we were seated fairly promptly.  We had the mushroom appetizer and were very impressed.  It really is very beautifully decorated.  I look forward to the next time we come here
2018-11-19,5,Best Italian restaurant in hoboken! Great service, incredible ambiance, and amazing food + drinks.
2018-11-03,4,Just excellent. The food, service, music. It's a wonderful little gem. RICKI was amazing. And you should try the misunderstood whisky cocktails.
2018-11-02,5,Great food and cocktails! The Tequila Mockingbird is fantastic. We came on a Friday and the live music was the best part. Murph was the absolute best and we'll definitely come back when he plays again!
2018-10-28,4,Really fun bar atmosphere. They often have live music. Great selection of drinks. I love their appetizers and small plates.
2018-10-21,4,Went here for brunch and the food was delicious! We got the Mac and cheese and eggs Benedict. They have a brunch special with drinks half off so we definitely indulged.the service was on the slower side but the food definitely made up for it. Can't wait to go back!
2018-10-10,5,Fantastic place. I highly recommend it.The food was wonderful and the service was the best.  I am definitely putting this on my top 10 list!!!!!
2018-10-02,5,This review is long over due. This is by far my favorite restaurant in Hoboken. From the ambiance to the food to the live music and happy hour everything is great. Every time I come here I wonder why I don't come more often.
2018-09-30,1,I wouldn't go back. The service was slow. The food is overly salty. I didn't have a good time. #regrets
2018-09-27,2,Was very busy and were seated at the bar.The mushroom appetizer was good.The disappointment - The Seabass - Very disappointing, totally bland, did not like at all.
2018-09-24,4,Grand Vin is lovely!The venue itself is beautifully decorated. It has a barn/greenhouse vibe which is quite romantic. We had awesome service and the food was delicious, cant wait to go back again!
2018-09-23,4,Had a wonderful time! Here is my opinion. I had a reservation at 8:45, and we showed up early. The woman sat us down at 8:25 so off to a great start! The atmosphere was perfect for a young crowd at this time, there was live music and the bar was hopping. The server was very nice and attentive at first, however our food came out a little too quick. We had just finished ordering and within 5 minutes the appetizer came. We had just finished our appetizer and then our dinner followed immediately after. Don't get me wrong I am not complaining, but it was a little on the faster side. The food however was phenomenal! We got the buratta to start, which was delicious! Followed by the scallop pasta (the sauce was amazing!!!) and the salmon which was cooked to perfection! We finished every scrap. And like I said our server was very nice! Overall, great food! At the time we went it was such a fun atmosphere, and the staff was very nice! My only complaint was it was a little rushed!
2018-09-17,5,So glad we discovered this place! It's adorable and charming and the staff are wonderful. The food is great, the short ribs were out of this world and the fig salad was delicious. Can't wait to go back!
2018-09-17,5,My goodness - was Grand Vin a treat! The restaurant is so beautifully decorated, and the food was excellent. I had dinner here on a Tuesday night, and it was incredibly busy. We ordered the $12 wine flight (great deal!), a dozen oysters, fried calamari, and the papperdelle. Their wine selection is excellent, their oysters were fresh, calamari was perfectly fried, and the papperdelle was a show stopper. The sauce, noodles, and scallops literally danced in my mouth.The only thing I had a mild issue with was the way the oysters were served. Most places serve them in ice, but they served them in a tray with some seaweed garnish. Unfortunately, the oysters didn't stay cold, but that gave us more incentive to eat them pretty fast. Parking in Hoboken sucks, but that's not their fault, haha. I definitely recommend coming here for a date night or a girls night! They have live music once a week, so I definitely want to check that out one of these days.
2018-09-17,4,They were very kind to allow a group of 16 sit together for a family gathering.The drinks and the food were really good .They only complaint I had was they had one waitress for all 16 of us plus she was also serving other tables around us!! Not fair to blame her for the poor service management should've been wiser and had her either serving our table only or adding another server to the area.They also had music playing which makes it difficult for the group to hear each other.Great place for smaller parties
2018-09-14,3,When you go to a wine bar and they don't have the first three glasses of wine you request it's kinda not a wine bar imho.  Food was meh too.  But the atmosphere is what saved them!
2018-09-10,5,From the decor, to the service, to the food, Grand Vin does not disappoint. My husband and I went over the weekend and everything was so amazing and delicious. We highly recommend the sprouts salad, calamari, rigatoni, and the spicy shrimp bucatini if they have that as a special that night. Will definitely be back!
2018-08-30,2,Not sure what the hype is. This place tries to use a modern feel to make up for lousy service, tight seating and small but pricey portions. Ordered 12 oysters, 6 were inedible due to being in spawning season. Technically edible but otherwise gross and should not be served. The other 6 oysters were warm, and we were not told which items were which, as we had ordered a mix and match off the list. Happy hour wines and beers were fine. Discounted wines were typically crappy California options, One Italian. Pastas are ordered as small are large portions, around 12 and 20$ respectively. We ordered the large capellini which was about an average serving size for one person. Definitely not a "large" portion by any means and barely enough to be shared. And no, we are not fat Americans looking for 10lbs of spaghetti to be served for $2. The service at our table was horrendous. Waiter was rude and hesitant to answer questions. The table next to us had a young female waitress who seemed to be pretty efficient, and we all wished she was our waitress that evening. Recommend trying other options as this place should easily fall off your list for Italian food-(yes, even the $1 oysters are not worth the visit )
2018-08-28,4,PARKING - Sucks. No way around it so just be patient :pFOR GROUPS - The first time I came here with a group of friends we were seated in the dining area for dinner. The place is not the most spacious but the decor and atmosphere give it a very intimate vibe for any occasion. We had a good time and I really liked their [DIRTY MARTINI W/ GIN]! Also loved the live music :)FOR DRINKS - During the most recent visit we arrived around 10ish on a Saturday. Place was pretty packed without much standing room for our group of 10 or 12. Luckily they were able to accommodate us at the seating area outside right in front. It was perfect for us to chill and hangout. [PURPLE HAZED] - $14 - COOLEST DRINK EVER. comes with a joint of lavender and sage(?)[GIN & CHRONIC] - $14 - meh.Pricey drinks but there are some very interesting-sounding cocktails that I'd love to try next time!
2018-08-27,5,My husband and I went to Grand Vin for a recent date night and had a great dinner. Between the two of us we had the beef carpaccio, a really nice cheese plate, short ribs, skirt steak, some wine and a few beers. The food was delicious and the service was superb. Overall it was a great experience, we will be back soon!
2018-08-25,2,Girls night out with my sis & our daughters, both living in Hoboken.  I made the reservation a couple of weeks ago.  We were seated within 5 minutes of arriving on time.The atmosphere was nice, warm & welcoming, mini lights strung high above, acoustic guitar playing, relaxing, romantic vibe.Our table was towards the back with two seats on the bench, where the girls sat & the opposite two seats facing the wall and a bathroom :/ with the toilet in full view through out our dining experience.Installing a door that closes automatically would solve this issue.We waited 20 minutes to be acknowledged & a total of 30 minutes before receiving a glass of water which we had to ask for.45 minutes in, we placed our appy & main entry order.30 min later we were told they were out of the veal meatballs.  We chose the eggplant instead, it was average at best.  It did arrive quickly, kudos to that.***45 minutes later*** our waiter appears to tell us there is no more salmon.  I understand this sort of thing happens all the time.  This was so disappointing due to how far along we were into our meal and the length of time it took to share this info with us.My daughter accepted my invitation to share my flank steak, which was pretty tasty.We finished with an ice cream cookie that was ok.All in all a huge disappointment for an evening we were so looking forward to due to table service.  Perhaps a few  of the wait and or kitchen help called out sick?  I want to give this charming place another chance yet don't want to sit through the same ....
2018-08-23,5,Love this restaurant! Celebrated Mother's Day with my husband and children and had a great experience. More recently my Daughter in laws shower was held here. I cannot say enough how wonderful the event was! The staff was extremely accommodating and went out of their way to make the day very special. The food was delicious and plentiful. The restaurant is beautifully decorated that there wasn't much need for extra decorations.
2018-08-20,5,Loved this place!It was all good--from the service to the drinks, dinner and dessert. Pleased an eclectic crew with varied palettes. Equally happy diners regardless of the level of adventure when it comes to eating. In other words, inventive enough to be interesting to the foodies, yet accessible enough for the mainstream diner. Would definitely go back!
2018-08-16,4,AMAZING EGGPLANT PARMESAN!Great staff, amazing service. The server was such a delight it pains me that I didn't catch her name! I can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu
2018-08-11,3,When I walked into Grand Vin I was amazed by the beautiful decor and the whole aesthetic of the place. Loved how everything look because it gave the place a very hipster chic vibe. Perfect place to catch up with friends or even go on a date. They have a very huge selection of wine and even let you try it before you decide that's the wine you want. I was very surprise of how knowledgeable my server was about the whole selection of wine. She also inform me about how they have wine tasting events in which I am very much interested in. The reason why I gave this place a 3/5 is because the food wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be. I ordered ribs and truffle fries and they were average. Wasn't impressed at all. Lastly, I felt like the place was a little over priced compared to other places I have been too in Hoboken. Other than that, everyone was super friendly and I really liked the atmosphere and vibe of the whole restaurant.
2018-08-11,2,I REALLY want to like Grand Vin, but unfortunately it's just not that good. My fiancé and I have given this place multiple attempts, considering we live right next door. The food is average and the service is honestly atrocious. The only positive is the ambiance- the space/decor is adorable. Drinks are good, so we'll stick to the bar when we go back. With that being said- we'll head somewhere else after for good food and good service.
2018-07-29,4,Food and decor was 5 stars, but had to take a star away for service. Romantic cute little spot, we came in with a reservation and were seated immediately. We put in a drink order and felt like we kept being rushed to order, we said we'd order once we actually got our drinks and looked at the menu. We ordered a bunch of apps to share and asked that things come out as it's prepared. She brought out everything at once - about 6 dishes in a tiny table, and it was really crammed. Busboys were great about keeping water glasses full and clearing empty plates, but our waitress didn't seem too concerned with us. We also overheard a table nearby asking her about a menu item, and she responded she didn't know. Didn't even offer to ask the kitchen, just shook her head and told them she wasn't sure..  While In the middle of our meal- two full dishes still on our table, Amanda- our waitress, told us there was another reservation and we could "move our bottle of wine to the bar".... we ignored it and continued finishing our bottle and meals. She also told us the reservation was at 8pm, yet she told us this at 8:20pm so we felt really confused. There were also 4 empty tables in the restaurant and the table next to us had already been there eating before we even arrived, and no one asked them to move to the bar. The busboy eventually came over and we asked for a dessert menu. Amanda seemed anointed when she came over and saw we were given dessert menus. We proceeded to order two coffees and sat and drank them as we witnessed two tables remaining empty the whole time. We weren't bothered again about leaving, but it was a really poor customer service experience which would make me think twice about bringing a friend or coming again.
2018-07-16,3,I am so glad there is finally another Italian restaurant in Hoboken, it's a refreshing and welcome change from all the Caribbean jerk eateries, soul food spots, Korean BBQ and kosher Jewish delicatessens that totally saturate Hoboken's dining scene. We need more Italian restaurants. I had drinks here with my girlfriend after work on a Thursday. The bar service was good, the bartender was attentive to me the instant I sat at the bar, and made me a good vodka martini. There's a good wine selection from what I could tell. We ordered the meatball appetizer, which I wasn't extremely impressed by, given the price. I mean okay, it's a plate of meatballs, and it's an appetizer, so I'm not demanding Michelin-grade stuff here. It just seemed like a lot of money for 4 small, pretty basic ground beef meatballs. It wasn't a deal-breaker though. The vibe and ambience is faux-classy and a bit stuck-up (not really any fault of the venue per se, merely the clientele it attracts), and I was the one wearing a suit and tie. My girlfriend even remarked that it was kind of stuffy in there (probably knowing that I'm more of a Cafe Michelina type). This is a quintessential new-Hoboken yuppie scene, as another reviewer remarked, replete with black leggings and Uggs -- I could smell the hunt for a hedge fund man just as strongly as the bruschetta. Perhaps a separate rack to hang their yoga mats would better allow them to hunt unencumbered...The hostess was a college kid hypnotized by her smart phone, and seemed eager to get back to her text convo when distracted by her duties. She also wasn't as friendly as she could have been, being that's kind of her main job, to be friendly to people walking in. She hardly cracked a smile. She was like 20 years old, that's what kids her age do so I don't blame her, but it wasn't a good look for the management. Still, I think I'll give it another try for a full-course dinner and a bottle of wine. Honestly, the entrees the servers were bringing out looked and smelled great. The wine list looked interesting and fun to sample. I'm curious for the full Grand Vin experience. After all, you just can't go wrong with an Italian restaurant in Hoboken. Several dozen identical business models all thriving in a single square mile can't be wrong.
2018-07-12,5,Great food and menuService can be a bit of a hit or miss sometimesAll of the tapas are excellent and so is the burrata and mozzarella!
2018-07-11,4,Awesome place!! Their Chilean sea bass was def the winner of the night (along with some cocktails) def would recommend!!
2018-07-10,5,great place! the atmosphere is super cute and trendy. They have great cocktails and a decent menu!
2018-07-08,4,Came to Grand Vin on a Saturday. Thanks Yelp for the reservations. The restaurant is pretty - with vines on the wall and dim lighting. The wine menu as expected is excellent with a lovely set of wines on tap including a prosecco and pinot noir I could have drank all night. There are also a solid set of wines by the glass , cocktails and beers. The food was great as well: we had the homemade pillowy lobster ravioli and a rack of veal special. They were both excellent. The everything calamari was terrific as well - perfect fried with lots of flavor and two sauces. The dessert menu looked yummy but we were stuffed. Service was friendly. Will be back!!
2018-07-07,4,The gnocchi was creamy and rich so we couldn't manage to finish it. The salmon was very tasty except for the burned asparagus. The rigatoni and fries were very good. I loved the decor and ambiance of the restaurant. Definitely recommend it.
2018-06-29,4,A trendy, chic spot with greenery and string lights. The staff knows wine well, and the food was absolutely delicious.
2018-06-25,5,Loved this spot! Came here on a Saturday night for a bridal shower dinner- we were a party of 13. They sat us in the back, no private room, but it felt intimate/cozy. Great ambience and the decor is so cute (rustic chic). The food was delish and the service was great as well. Our server was so attentive. We brought a cake with us and our server brought it out on a cute cake stand after dinner. Around 10pm is when the live music started, which I thought was a nice added bonus. Overall, we were very happy with Grand Vin: excellent service, yummy food, and great ambience.
2018-06-23,5,The place is very pretty I went there for brunch and also for dinner I have to salad with chicken it was delicious
2018-06-22,4,Chic place in a cute neighborhood. Amazing variety of wines and drinks to pick from, and the food was fantastic! Only negative was that the moment we paid, the waitress never bothered to come back to refill our waters while we sat and chatted for a little while longer.Overall I'd recommend!
2018-06-07,5,This place is fab. I went here with a few girlfriends for dinner and the food was great. Its a very cute little place and the decor is nicely done. They made accommodations for my friend with allergies and basically customized her dish to meet her needs. They also have decent wine on tap which is pretty cheap and great to share.
2018-06-07,4,So  I had my Bridal Shower here.  It was beautiful.  The back room is a perfect setting for it.  The food was delicious.  I only have one critique and that is the way the family style food was served.  Instead of serving a dish at a time, it probably should be served all dishes a table at a time.  That being said it did not take away from the taste.  The baked eggplant is AMAZING and I went back the week after with my fiance just to have it again
2018-06-03,3,We came here on a Thursday night. It was loud and lively inside as well as outside. Sadly, the food was only okay especially for the prices. It wasn't bad, just meh. Service was particularly poor. At one point a manager stopped by our table and kind of took over because she noticed our server was M.I.A. Not sure if I want to return.
2018-05-27,5,One of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken!! Food is amazing and cocktails were superb! Ask for Ricki - best server ever! So attentive, helpful and an overall pleasure! Ambiance can get you so far in restaurants because from the photos you can see that this place is beautiful. But food is amazing and service with Ricki completes the package. In Grand Vin, you have a home run, a gem or whatever other term you want to use to describe a wonderful place!
2018-05-22,2,We had a reservation at Grand Vin on Saturday around 6:15. When we arrived, the place was only starting to get the dinner crowd trickling in. We were seated promptly and our waitress came to ask if we wanted drinks immediately. That was the last she addressed me. Throughout the night, she asked my boyfriend if he was ok and if he needed another glass of wine, but completely ignored me. Our eventual order of a cheese and meat plate came out quickly and the pastas we ordered were rushed out right after. The tables are tiny so there was no place to organize all of the plates. We felt incredibly rushed and like they couldn't wait to get us out of there. We'd really been looking forward to coming here but were sorely disappointed by the service. We felt rushed and unwelcome, especially when compared to both tables next to us who were getting prompt and attentive service.In the end, the food was very good but we won't be back. We'd planned on having a leisurely dinner and having a few glasses of wine, but we left quickly and sober because our waitress never asked if I wanted another glass and when I asked for one, she ignored me. Overall incredibly disappointed with the experience. This place was overhyped.
2018-05-20,5,Fabulous place. The food is great! I attended a bridal shower here. They rented out the whole place. And transformed it into a really beautiful location. We had avocado toast, arugula pear salad, rigatoni in a marscapone cheese sauce (TO DIE FOR) and truffle fries. The staff was so nice and friendly. I can only imagine their real menu. I'm definitely coming back!
2018-05-19,2,Grand Vin has some nice decor and beautiful bathrooms. Aside from that, everything else about this place is mediocre at best. I called 10 minutes prior to arriving to inquire about the wait time and was advised it was ten minutes. Upon arrival, 10 minutes after that call, suddenly the wait time is one full hour and there is a "private event". After instead opting to sit at the bar to avoid waiting for a table, I attempted to order one of the supposed "half priced cocktails" advertised on the restaurants website as apart of their brunch special. Despite the fact that I advised the bartender that the website still shows the special, he maintained his assertion that the special is no longer in effect as of "a week or two... or three ago". Finally, upon receiving our food orders, each of our four plates were all cold. Spending $18 a plate should yield at least a lukewarm meal. Overall, not worth it.
2018-05-10,4,Everything was great! Tuesday flight night is also a plus. Cute restaurant, good food & drinks, nice ambiance.
2018-05-06,4,First can I say that both the outdoor and indoor decor is really lovely and tasteful. I was excited to finally try this place! Met a friend for dinner during the week. We were offered a table in the dining area but it isn't as cute and decorative as the front so we sat at a high top table. The one down side was that the high tops are serviced by the bartender, who already has plenty of work to do as the bar has at least 15-20 seats! Other than that, the food and drinks were very tasty and plentiful. The food was good and I was impressed with the flavors. I'd recommend it as a fun spot for a first date or a casual weeknight dinner!
2018-05-06,5,Grand Vin is my favorite Italian restaurant and wine bar in Hoboken! With chic decor, live entertainment, an extensive menu & fantastic food, it can't be beat. I came here for my birthday dinner with a large group. We ordered almost every appetizer - the calamari, meatballs, burrata, eggplant, french onion soup and truffle fries - not a single complaint from the entire group. Everything was absolutely delicious and spot on. For entrees, everything was great, but people really seemed to enjoy the steak and gnocchi. We also drank lots of wine, so it was a wonderful night!If you're looking for a romantic date spot, or simply want to head out for a girls night, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
2018-05-01,5,Grand Vin opened after my husband moved out of Hoboken, much to my chagrin, so it was off my radar for a bit. Outstanding Yelp reviews, and looking for a wine-focused place for a girls' night with my cousins led me to Grand Vin. I tried to make a reservation for three on a Friday night, but both OpenTable and a phone call resulted in a total no go, though I was told that if we showed up, we could always hang at the bar.The three of us grabbed a cab from the train station cab line and were at Grand Vin shortly thereafter (it's on Grand, so a little more off the grid than the places found on Washington/Hudson/River, but still super easily accessible). When we arrived around 6 PM, the place was PACKED. Like, wall to wall people, and an hour wait for three. Because the place was so damn cute, we decided to get a bottle of rosé and wait it out. The hostess took down our name and phone number to text when the table was ready.The wine options are incredibly varied, and there were at least 10 different types of rosé on the menu, which made narrowing it down a lot more difficult. We ended up asking the bartender for a recommendation of one that was not too sweet, and he came back with the perfect bottle of a drier variety from the Finger Lakes ($42/bottle). As we poured three glasses, the hostess came over to us to let us know that because of a last minute cancellation, we could be seated right then. Honestly though, even if we had waited, it wouldn't have impacted the rating of this experience, because again, this place is decorated so beautifully, we had room to post up, and the wine was SO delicious (I will not complain about being led to the table early though, at all, so thank you to whoever it was who canceled!). Rather than each order a separate dinner, we ordered a bunch of small plates and apps to share. We went with (and I would HIGHLY recommend all of these): the steamed artichoke (which came with this amazing garlic sauce to dip it in), the Cajun calamari (the sauce was unreal), the meat and cheese board (Prosciutto, truffle goat cheese, Gruyere, and a sheep's milk cheese that I can't remember the name of, but it was beyond), and truffle fries, which were delicious and easily shared with 2-3 people (unless you are a glutton, and I wouldn't blame you because they are SO GOOD). We also ordered a second bottle of the rosé, because why not? Everything was delicious, the service was wonderful, the ambiance was perfect, and despite it being a busy Friday night, we never felt rushed, which was also appreciated. Honestly, I cannot wait to head back to Grand Vin - it is the perfect place for a date night, night out with friends, whatever. I'm a lot in love.
2018-04-27,4,Nice ambiance, good drinks and attentive service! Only went for cocktails and tried a couple of different ones - all were good! The guacamole with crab was delicious. It had big chunks of crab meat and the guac itself was tasty. One call out is it didn't come with enough chips (but does it ever?). Everything else on the menu looked good, so I'd definitely go back again!
2018-04-23,4,Perfect spot for a low key, ambient brunch! Food was thoughtful and delicious (can recommend the fig & brie burger especially!). The $12 mimosa flights on Sundays are a fun take on the standard mimosa deal. However, wish they offered a deal on Sundays if mimosas aren't your thing (half price brunch cocktails are available on Saturdays only).
2018-04-22,1,Customer service from the hostess was horrific. Place is beautiful. I am a hoboken native and love the vibe. The way we were treated was so rude, I was actually dumbfounded. Coming from someone who has worked in the restaurant business for a number of years it is never acceptable to treat customers so poorly. We were planning on spending a pretty penny. Unfortunately we now have a bad taste in our mouth regarding this establishment.
2018-04-20,4,Hot tip! If you hang around at the bar long enough and play the game, you should get a seat at bar sooner than table in ideal location near live music!
2018-04-12,1,If you like overpriced drinks and girls talking about how there folks need to pay for more of the good thing in life as it not easy being me this is the place for you, break out the uggs and leggings and .....Overpriced drinks, very mediocre food and live music that wouldn't be out of place in a female hygiene advertisement.You know who you are !!
2018-04-08,5,Delicious food, great service & beautiful ambiance. Highly suggest for a date night or even a birthday!
2018-04-01,4,One of the top restaurants in Hoboken. Well made dishes and a pleasant atmosphere makes Grand Vin a restaurant I will be returning to. Their menu is more varied then most in Hoboken, and the first one I've seen to offer tartar or artichoke. The food tasted good and the staff was knowledgable. There are barely any French restaurants in Hoboken and I'm happy to say I can recommend this restaurant to anyone searching for French cuisine in the city.
2018-04-01,3,We were there today, for brunch. Very disappointing... I mean, it wasn't awful, but we were expecting something in the same level than the Antique Bakery. Ambience was very cool and the wine list also very nice... but food and service... :(I ordered the Fig and Brie burger, the menu said it came with brioche bun. When the burger arrived it had regular bun, I asked the server, that didn't even know what a brioche was, she went to the kitchen and came back with a roll, saying that they were out of brioche but she could change to the roll... nope. Not even close... by their reaction I asked myself if they ever had brioche before... (at that point she actually looked at me with a "what are you complaining about? I'm offering you a different bread and you said no." face)Secondly, it was supposed to be a short rib brisket burger, so I was expecting a couple of slices of yummy, slow cooked brisket. It was actually a regular patty. In this case, I'm not sure if I didn't get the description (like the patty was made of short rib) or if they were out of short rib as well. I didn't ask. I decided to go with "that was my mistake, I misunderstood the description". Our impression in general was that Sundays are not a really good day to go there and probably the best staff (kitchen and service) work night hours. To be fair, we will give it a second chance on a Saturday night, will let you know by then.
2018-03-29,5,Love Grand Vin! Went there for a Tuesday with friends and had wine flights and half orders of pasta.  Service and food was excellent and ambiance is delightful.  Definitely one of my favorite Hoboken spots
2018-03-28,5,We booked Grand Vin as our brunch location to celebrate our wedding day. And we could not be happier!We had a group of 45 guests, and were able to reserve the back dining room. Everything about this restaurant is 5 stars. The decor was immaculate. Our food choices were loved by all (french onion burger and avocado toast eggs benedict were the biggest hits). Everything ran smoothly and without a hitch.However, the star of the day was our Event Director, Anne Marie. From the very beginning conversations, to the last minute changes, Anne Marie blew us away. She was meticulous, down to the most minute details. We wouldn't have nearly had as great of a time if it wasn't for her.We will definitely be bringing our business back to Grand Vin!
2018-03-19,4,This restaurant is delicious, and the ambiance is fantastic. Only down side is that it books up quickly and sometimes when you go to the front deck and ask for a time, they tell you an hour, when the timing may be 15 min. or another additional hour. One of my favorites, however, in Hoboken.
2018-03-18,4,beautifully decorated wine bar with delicious food! The service is mediocre which explains the lack of that final star in my rating. We asked for a basic red wine and our waitress ripped us off by giving us one of the most expensive on the menu. When we got the bill, we ran it by her and explained the situation. She was nice enough to change our six glasses of wine to the price of a bottle saving us quite a few bucks. Besides that, this is a comfortable and delectable dining experience in Hoboken. A little bit of a walk from the main drag, but certainly worth those extra steps.
2018-03-10,3,Ambience is nice but the dinner menu is limited. Food is alright nothing out of the ordinary!
2018-03-07,5,Great service, awesome menu, cool space.  Definitely one of the best spots in Hoboken, and without the arrogance of some other local establishments.
2018-03-05,4,Sooooo for date night it was his turn to pick a random restaurant to try from YELP selected based on reviews, menu items, decor and area and he did SO WELL! We walked in and it was a low lit romantic feel the bar was crowed bar the bartender directed us to to hidden seats on the far left side . Mmmm that was perfectly fine being that the diner room was packed because it was a Friday night around 7 o clock I believe . Anyway we settled in and my eye was drawn to a few cocktails that I tried and absolutely loved. The bartender told us that the special was an bacon wrapped filet of some sort and I was sold . My date got the seafood ravioli that was delicious  and we shared calamari for an app to start . Oh so when our meals came out we only mid way done with our calamari and the food runner did not hear us say we wanted it wrapped . The next time he past by us we mention the calamari , of course without making it a big deal and he apologized . Fast forward to the end of our meal while we took down our last sips of round three of cocktails ;the food runner came around and dropped off fresh calamari already packed up to go lol . I thought that was such a kind gesture that was deeply appreciated . It should no chance for my late night munchies lol Long story short I really enjoyed this place , decor and service I'll be back ....
2018-02-23,1,The ambience is great and so are the cocktails and food . However service is not great . Host and server will make you feel that you need to order and leave within 2 hours . Me and my friend felt that we were not given any space, we would have loved to order entrees and sit for more time . We ordered 4 drinks and 2 appetizers in 1.5 hours and were told that we need to leave the table in next 30 mins as we they another reservation. Extremely unwelcoming host and servers . Tip - if u take reservation for only 2 hours then please mention on ur website or when the person is making a reservation
2018-02-23,5,One of my favorite date night spots in Hoboken. Their bar area is adorable and they have a list of organic wines! I always get their ravioli which is stuffed with shrimp, scallops, and calamari, it's always delicious. I've had a few different appetizers, all are great. Perfect for a low-key, romantic night. The space is small and it gets crowded, so make a reservation!
2018-02-23,5,The best meatballs I've had in a restaurant. Had a shrimp and clam fettuccine arrabiata which had just the right amount of kick to it. My entire traditional Italian family loved this place. Wish the music was slightly lower as we were a big group and it was hard to hear the end of the table but everything was amazing. They even let us bring our own cake because we were celebrating a birthday.
2018-02-15,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! The food is so good! Service is great too. No compaints. I love how this place is decorated. Such a wonderful Ambiance.
2018-02-08,3,Very cozy gem in Hoboken. In the heart of the neighborhood and away from the Main Street but worth the trek. Eggplant parm and NY oysters were fine. Veal meatballs were excellent. And short ribs and risotto were solid. Halibut special  was good - meaty piece of fish but a tad over cooked, which was a shame. Tiramisu was good too. Live music was a treat - at around 7:45. But it gets too loud to talk then so if you want a quiet dinner go early.
2018-01-31,5,Adorable little wine bar with outdoor seating available, wine on tap, and friendly bartenders.  What more could you ask for? We came here with friends on a Friday evening for pre-dinner drinks - we got seats at the bar easily and ordered refreshments promptly.  There was wine on tap, although I ordered a Vodka-Soda.  My husband had a old fashioned and was super pleased with it. Ambiance is perfect, some twinkling lights hung up (this was still around holiday time), and cute window seats as well.  The place had an intimate vibe, despite being quite large.  Would be a great spot for a work happy hour or afternoon bridal shower.  *I only had a drink here, but looking forward to coming back for food (and more drinks!)
2018-01-31,3,Walked past this place plenty of times and was always intrigued by what it looked like on the inside. Finally made plans with a friend and had the chance to dine here one Friday evening. They don't take reservations on weekends so I decided to come at around 9pm to snag a table, hoping the wait wouldn't be long since it's post-dinner rush. Nope, I was wrong. My friends and I waited almost an hour minutes outside since inside was way too packed; good thing it was a mild winter night so standing outside wasn't too intense. What confused me was the time quotes provided by the hostess. First she told me 15 minutes as a party was wrapping up their dinner so I said great, we'll wait outside. After 15 minutes I went back to check and she said it'll be another 15-20 minutes as the party is wrapping up their dinner. After 15-20 minutes I go back and she said another 10-15 minutes because they are setting up out table now. I didn't know it takes 10-15 minutes in order to set up a table. At that point my friends and I were so hungry. We had ample amount of time to look over the menu and ordered as soon as we sat down. Overall the service here is good/standard, and food here is good, and well prepared, but I had to dock two stars for the initial confusion - had the hostess conveyed a better wait time to me I would not be as annoyed as I was that night. I understand as a business you don't want to lose a walk-in customer but quoting a 15 minute wait time that turned nearly into an hour wait time is unacceptable. Perhaps better front staff training is needed in order to ensure business/customer transparency.
2018-01-25,5,I would give more than 5 stars if I could!  We had our daughter's baptism reception at Grand Vin on a Sunday afternoon and couldn't have been happier with how the event turned out.  The Events Manager was so great to work with. She was extremely knowledgeable, helpful and her attention to detail was top notch. She created such a beautiful event for our family down to every last detail, including the table settings, the flowers, menus, etc. Our families couldn't stop raving about how perfect the event was. The food and service were both excellent. I highly (emphasize highly!) recommend Grand Vin for a special event.
2018-01-17,5,Absolutely lovely dinner! I just want to note the seating is actually delightful because you're sitting across from everyone, no round tables and it's just a bit more intimate. The food was to die for and the mixed cocktails were showstoppers on their own. They had a unique menu but I'd highly recommend the buratta to start and the salmon as a dinner. Our waitress was friendly and attentive as well.  Overall a wonderful experience!
2018-01-11,2,Go here just for the wine and not the food... actually the wine was overpriced too. Good place for an overpriced glass of wine due to the exposed brick wall and lighting. Overall the person pizza looked okay next to me but my and my dates entrees were terrible
2018-01-10,5,Great space- service is on point -  short rib and risotto is off the chart -- Wine list hits the right notes -- I dig the draft can actually tbh.This most recent Wednesday the acoustic performer was fire -  took all requests and nailed it !!  Hope he is back often !Best Wed spot on Hoboken for sure !!
2018-01-06,5,A perfect date night spot! Live music on Wednesday- Saturday, picture-perfect decor, and attentive service.The meal started with homemade bread with herbed olive oil. My husband and I both had the pasta dishes. I loved the rigatoni with bacon-chicken cream sauce. The wine and cocktails were high quality. The tiramisu was our favorite dish of the night. Excellent restaurant! Will be back soon.
2017-12-30,4,Went here for dinner yesterday. Loved the ambiance, the food was 4 stars, tasty solid food but nothing exceptional. The service could have been better. We shared a burata appetizer which was tasty, for entrees I had cacio Pepe pasta, my bf had chicken sorentino. He liked the flavor of the chicken but eggplant was undercooked. They should have precooked the eggplant separately before baking with the chicken. My pasta was solid. Would definitely come back here to try other dishes.
2017-12-28,5,I absolutely love Grand Vin!I've been there 3 times now and the service, food and ambiance has always been great.  The staff seem to know a lot about the wines as well as the dishes.  Typically for an appetizer I prefer to get the meatballs.  I don't normally order veal but these meatballs are delicious.  They are dense with a lot of flavor and the sauce has a nice consistency.  I could eat that alone!  I've had the salmon twice and I really enjoy it.  I always get a nice portion and the piece tastes seared but has a juicy center and the squash that comes with it is light and tasty.  Last night I tried the seafood ravioli and you could really see all of the fresh fish in the ravioli and the portion was plentiful for 5 ravioli.  The cream sauce was great, I just wish there was a little bit more of the marinara sauce with it because I could not stop eating it!!
2017-12-22,4,I wish they had more wines by the glass (there's really only one one per variety) but the ambiance is amazing and the live music on thurs, fri, sat, is awesome! Have so much fun here!
2017-12-22,5,Came here on a Tuesday evening and it seemed we were lucky to get there relatively early because it got super packed as we progressed through our meal. They have different drink specials every night so on this night we got a wine flight, which there were about five different set selections you could choose from, depending on your wine preference. I chose the bold and spicy, and there was not one glass that I didn't like of the three. We started off with the calamari, which, while calamari is pretty standard, had a bit of Cajun spice. It wasn't soggy at all, which can be an issue sometimes with fried calamari. I ordered the daily special of grilled Branzino with asparagus. So good, and such a large portion--it had two pieces of fish and about eight pieces of asparagus and by the end I was stuffed. Service was friendly and impeccable throughout and I hope to visit again!
2017-12-04,5,So. Much. Fun! Looks like I'll be in Hoboken more often now.I love this place. Been here twice now, and both times have been so much fun. It gets crowded at night (weekend), so try to snag a seat at the bar or the high-tops by the bar earlier. Got lucky with seats at the bar Saturday night, and we had a blast. The food was delicious, and the service was the best (thanks Mike, Mark & Javier!). The bartenders really try to get to everyone even when it's super busy. They were attentive to make sure everyone who was waiting by the bar got their drinks. Oh and you can't forget the live music by Mike Buscio--- you are the best!! Thanks for making our night such a good time.
2017-11-26,3,The decor and ambiance is very nice, staff is nice as well. The restaurant feels homie with a touch of elegance.I was very impressed by the capellini dish I had the first time I went there. Not very impressed by their wine pouring quantity. $12-15 for a barely there pour is not a good look in my book.I just went there today again, to give it another try. I, again, had the capellini pasta ($20) and this time it was pretty bad. It looked and tasted like something I would whip out at home in 20 min. Nothing like the first time. BTW, this was in a span of 1 week that I went. I also had the old fashion cocktail, presentation and taste were good.
2017-11-25,5,We went there for brunch.  The food was excellent...prices were very reasonable.  I loved the decor and atmosphere. Service was phenomenal! Will definitely go back for dinner!
2017-11-10,5,Thursday evening November 9, 2017.Had dinner last night at GV.Truly had the most great time the entire evening!Arrived just about 6:45..Place was pretty full..especially the bar area.Wonderful hostesses...Got sat at our favorite table.Great wine!Mike the manager came over to say hey......and greet us....Both our meals were just exceptional. Meat platter...Chicken Francaise...Seafood ravioli..Outstanding!!!Wine flowed thru evening....Service was professional..fun....and well-timed!Perefectlty themed live music.Can only tell you the truth!Great evening!Get over there and enjoy!Pau and I just loved the night.....cheers!Billy
2017-11-06,5,Lovely staff, excellent food and an amazing wine selection! GV is one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken! If you haven't been-- you must go and you'll keep going back!
2017-10-04,2,The food is fine, but this might be the worst wine program I've seen at a place that is supposed to be a wine bar.  Compare the wine list at Bin 14 to this, it's really sad.  12 bottles of red which included one bottle of pinot for $120 (come on guys, there's better Pinot at a huge mark up at steak houses for less).  And why in the world do you need 12 bottles of Rose' on the menu (equal the amount of red wine in sum total)?  Whoever did your wine program has legitimately no idea what they're doing. It's not a wine bar.
2017-10-03,5,Such a classy and wonderful date and girls night happy hour joint. Their HH is a flight of wine (3 glasses) for $12. They already have set combinations so I got the one that offered (1) red, white, and pink. We paired it with cheese and meat boards (also on HH special). We each also ordered the half size pasta which was perfect after eating the charcuterie; they're definitely catering to women's stomach because of the sizing options for the pastas.
2017-10-02,5,Went on a quick girls trip for a night to Hoboken and found this place through yelp. We were very impressed with everything. The decor was so nice and the server ended up being our best friend by the end of the night. We sat right away and the crowd was lively. They even had a live band that was not too loud and very good. The drinks were good and the food was excellent. We tried a few appetizers and the pasta dishes that were recommended to us. For dessert we had a brownie sundae. Sad I do not live in the area and will not be returning anytime soon.
2017-09-28,3,This place does well because there is a shortage of "wine bars" in town.  I have been here twice - both with groups.  They are accommodating changing items on the menu.  Being a non-dairy person the menu is not my style.  I went mid September and we had awful service - waiting and waiting to get more wine and find our server.  Since I didn't like any other choices, I ordered a salad with chicken and shrimp.   The waiter looked at me like I had two heads and made a comment insinuating that a big order (2 shrimp by the way and not a big order) which I did not appreciate especially in front  of a large group.  Overpriced.  Don't get the hype other than not a sports bar.  I will avoid going unless birthday related and forced to.
2017-09-27,5,Love Grand Vin for many reasons...food, drinks and atmosphere. They have wine on tap! Definitely give this place a try, perfect for a date night. It is pretty expensive compared to some other options in town but worth it in my opinion.
2017-09-21,2,I feel bad putting down such a poor rating but my experience was just horrible! I would never recommend coming here. We waited an hour for an indoor table and were seated outside. The hostess did not even acknowledge that we requested to sit inside. The waitress was the highlight of our evening as she apologized for the mishap. The apps took about an hour to come out. Over priced for the service. There are tons of neighborhood rests I would choose before coming here.
2017-09-19,4,Very beautiful atmosphere.  Eggplant and meatball appetizers are delish!  I just wish our food was hot when it was served - it was warm to room temperature.  Our server was hard to locate a lot of the time as well.
2017-09-19,5,I still need to come in here to eat, but I LOVE the atmosphere:  classy, vibrant and upbeat--(not to mention the great selection of wines and cheeses).  Beautiful decor and attentive staff.  I came on a Friday and they had a great live band playing as well.  I also love that the location is a little bit away from the main drag.  We found parking easily.  Looking forward to trying the food, the menu sounded delicious!
2017-09-12,5,Just to start with the quick version of this review- go to Grand Vin for the delicious food and beautiful ambiance! The eggplant parm and veal meatballs are two of my favorite dishes in all of Hoboken. The decor is so well thought out- the rustic wooden panels with lots of greenery, white lights and cute little knickknacks is so different than anywhere else in Hoboken. It's what you would expect from the city or Brooklyn, but fortunately we are lucky to have Grand Vin in Hoboken! Also they have Frose ́- enough said.My fiancé and I had our rehearsal dinner here on a Friday night a few weeks ago. I cannot say enough about Anne Marie who coordinated the event for us and thought of every special touch! We only had about 30 people attending and didn't think to bring any decorations or anything, so Anne Marie took care of all the details from fresh flowers on the tables to personalized menus and cute touches. Our guests had never been to Grand Vin before and they raved about the food and how nice the space was. I originally checked out Grand Vin because I know Dan Grey, the owner, so I was curious to see the place and excited to support his new restaurant. He really went above and beyond and works hard to make this a successful restaurant. My fiancé and I discussed a few options for our rehearsal dinner, but my thoughts kept returning to Grand Vin, and I am so glad we settled on it. Dan helped out to make our dinner even more special, and thanks to him and Anne Marie, we had the perfect night! I highly recommend coming here for dinner (or apps and drinks at the bar) or booking an event here through Anne Marie- she's very good at what she does!
2017-09-09,5,Absolutely fantastic. If I could give more stars I would. I was having my last dinner in town with my boyfriend and we were greeted by friendly staff and a beautiful restaurant. I saw online they had fried mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto when we asked about it on the to our server he told us it was a brunch special. However, to our surprise, he brought it out for us anyway. I ordered the stuffed chicken, and my boyfriend got the gnocchi. Both absolutely amazing! We almost licked our plates! For dessert, we got the S'mores brownie sundae, also amazing, and some coffee. Grand Vin has some of the best coffee I have ever had (and I am not a coffee drinker). Overall, I will come back to this restaurant for years to come. It gave us the perfect romantic evening.
2017-09-08,5,Favorite place in Hoboken. They have great specials Tuesday-Thursday. So cute inside and the bartenders are awesome. Food is great and I love that they have pasta available in two sizes in case you're not that hungry.
2017-08-31,3,The good:  This is a nice spot to grab a glass of wine, cheese plate and enjoy the overall ambiance.  The bad: The food is actually terrible and overpriced.  We came for dinner and I ordered what turned out to be an extremely bland pasta special (which they charged over $30 for) - I wish I knew how bad it was prior to ordering.  We even witnessed the table next to us sending back some of their food, should have realized things wouldn't go well for us either at that point.  The service was mediocre despite it not being very busy. If you're looking for a nice meal at an equally cute restaurant I'd HIGHLY suggest going to Anthony Davids instead!
2017-08-30,4,Lovely interior & nice outdoor seating in a quiet nook of Hoboken. Great for date nights or girls nights, plenty of wine to choose from. Meat & cheese plates are amazing! A bit pricey for entrees that are usually pretty mediocre/underwhelming. Sometimes the bartenders can be a bit snobby but wait staff and hostesses are always super friendly. I think the bartenders just need to remember this is Hoboken, not a 5 star restaurant in Manhattan
2017-08-24,3,Don't come if you think you'll ever at any point want to leave. Service is painfully slow, and they have a tendency to push unto you more cheese than necessary, compounded by the fact that they denied us the ability to take it home. The cozy ambiance and live music were the only redeeming qualities. Shout out to the Ed Sheeran-like guitarist
2017-08-21,3,im between 3 and 4 stars on this spot. there were definitely some hits and misses. the overarching best thing about this meal, was the delicious awesome yummy complimentary pesto dipping sauce that comes with the bread basket. you guys need to start making some entrees/ pasta dishes that feature this sauce, its amazing! second favorite thing was the capellini with peas, mushrooms, prosciutto and meat sauce. then came the chicken entree, which was a spin on a chicken parm and was topped with burrata vs. mozz and served with zuchinni noodles instead of pasta. the burrata was a nice change-up! some room for improvement was the gnochhi, it was very dense. the rigatoni, the sauce was very thin and lacking flavor. also, the meatballs were a-ok, but not knocking anyone's socks off. the marinara they were served in was awesome. i really enjoyed the overall space here, its super cute and homey with exposed wood, candles and greenery. really pretty restaurant. the wine list was also solid, we enjoyed the carafe of red we ordered. i also liked that with the pastas you could order a half or pound option. always nice to be able to try a few different things when they are served in appetizer/ individual size.
2017-08-18,5,Love Grand Vin!! The artichoke is amazing so is the shrimp!!! Never had a bad meal here.  Also save room for dessert the ice cream sandwich is amazing
2017-08-17,3,We dined with a group of 6 last evening. We are all very experienced diners. The overall service was fair at best and very loud. The food was very good and we sampled a solid variety of starters of artichokes and calamari. The entrees were short ribs/strip steak/sea bass/cappelini and chicken and everyone enjoyed.  The issues and reason for 3 stars along with reasons that will preclude an imminent return are:  It was wine down wends. The only offerings were 2 white wines. What restaurant would not have a red wine choice is puzzling especially since several of us only drink red wine. We ordered truffle fries and we were asked would you like before or with entrée and we indicated with entrée. To our surprise they arrived 15 minutes prior by the runner. It was hard to find waitress but she was difficult to corral. Finally after enjoying the meals we  were excited to enjoy the  chipwich and flourless chocolate cake for desert only to be told they were sold out. We were disappointed especially since 90% of dining room was in midst of dinner and we were early ones to sit. It just seems like these were never available. I don't recall menu stating 20% gratuity for 6 people but will inquire because honestly overall experience did not warrant. There are many restaurants in and around Hoboken that offer the complete package .Overall Fair experience
2017-08-16,5,My favorite frosé to date. The sea bass is only well done. The avocado fries is also to die for.
2017-08-14,4,This restaurant has become a 'must visit' every month when I am in Hoboken. I crave it while I'm all the way in Dallas :(
2017-08-09,3,The décor of this restaurant is really cute, love the bistro lights and the outside seating. I thought the food was just mediocre, and the service was definitely subpar. We were there on Saturday for my girlfriend's birthday dinner, and our waitress was extremely short with us. We only had 2 menus and asked for another two, to which she snarkily replied "two isn't enough?" and then never came back with more! it just felt like she didn't want to be there or have anything to do with us. She poured us wine and then never came back to refill them and when she did begrudgingly check in on us her attitude was very apparent. Luckily we were next to where they kept the communal water ice bucket which are wine was added to, so we ended up serving ourselves. Additionally we ordered a brussell sprouts dish in a cast iron skillet as one of the appetizers. The dish was dropped on our table with no words exchanged. I reached over to grab the dish and immediately burned my hand. Just little things like that marred the experience for us. The food was fine, dry salads, I had the pasta seafood special which I found to be bland, but my girlfriend loved her short rib dish. All 4 of us left feeling underwhelmed by the food and annoyed by the service.
2017-08-06,4,Love this place! Although the location isn't on a main thoroughfare, this restaurant is worth the walk!  Hubby and I enjoyed a lovely date night here last Saturday.  The ambience was very romantic, sophisticated, and casually enjoyable.  We didn't dress up.  The live music was very nice.  We made a reservation and didn't need to wait.  Only bummer was that our server seemed stress and we waited on her a few times.  The burrata, tuna tartare, Brussels sprouts, and lamb dishes were insane.  We would definitely go back! There was also plenty that was gluten free!
2017-08-03,4,Came here on a Thursday night with two girl friends. It's tucked away on a side street away from the main Hoboken scene. They have outdoor seating for a night summer night. We shared the burrata and it was AMAZING. Two of us got salads and another pasta - all loved each dish. The menu isn't huge but still plenty to choose from. Large wine list with reasonable prices.A live guitarist came in later that nice, which was a nice touch. Will be back again!
2017-07-28,5,Had a wonderful time at Grand Vin with my girlfriend. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable. The food was delicious! We had the calamari as an appetizer...one of the best calamari dishes I ever had. I got the rigatoni pasta dish and my girlfriend has the chicken. Both were exceptional! We cannot wait to come back.
2017-07-26,4,I came to Grand Vin with my best friend one of the first times I came to Hoboken. It's not super close to the PATH and in a residential area, so it's quiet and quaint. I absolutely the lighting they have inside and out, and it's so quite romantic! The night I went was super quiet because I think it was right before the bar was closing on a weekday. We both got a cocktail and they were both great. I'll definitely have to come back and try the food and other drinks! There is outdoor seating which is perfect for the summer and fall, and there's live entertainment sometimes. Love this bar and will update my review when I go back again!
2017-07-22,3,I am feeling more 3 and 1/2 stars here, so let's imagine I can do that. Far away from the popular Hoboken destinations, I think that's a good thing. Not terribly hard to find parking. Inside is so much bigger than it seems out side. Decor inside is lovely as well! Super aesthic. Kinda dark though. Food!The one thing I didn't like.. there was not a lot of vegetarian options on the menu. It's 2017 come on! So drinks I got the Frose and my boyfriend got some kind of rose wine! The Frose was kind of expensive I was surprised! So here's the thing for the pasta it comes in half $12 or whole bowls $20. We were getting 2 kinds so of course we wanted half. I asked if there was vegetarian options she said they could do a pasta with veggies and a spicy marinara. Which sounded good to me. Nice that they accomdated me! The waitress never asked if we wanted to half or whole and left quickly so I guessed or hopped it was the half. We didn't find out till we got the check it was the $20 one. I was like well... that sucks. The bill ended up more than $70 which was okay for great food but we didn't even finish every thing. So it was a tad upsetting. I guess my 3 and a half stars is from miscommunication!
2017-07-16,5,Love this place! The food is always delicious and the drinks are great too. We came for a celebration and they were so accommodating when I had to add people to my party on a Saturday night. Service was perfection and they even surprised us with champagne.
2017-07-12,2,I'm not sure why this place has such great reviews. The decor is some of the best in Hoboken without a doubt. But other than that, the food is subpar and the drinks are overpriced. I got the avocado fries and they were just not good. I don't think they added any salt whatsoever. The French onion soup also zero salt. Everything felt like it could have been better. The servers feel like they are actually trying, but some are definitely better than others. On most days it is too loud to enjoy the company you came with.
2017-07-09,2,Service: 3 out of 10Appetizer: 7 out of 10Food: 6 out of 10Price: 3 out of 10Drinks: 8 out of 10Pasta or the day was half a portion size than that of Leo's, but cost -$30!   Was too salty.    Wife's meal of chicken main course was good but the sides were just ok.Apps were good, but the sauces were minimal.  We asked for extra never came.  I liked it the drinks, pretty good.Service was terrible.  At one point I looked around the restaurant and there literally was not one Waite staff in the entire restaurant - all of them were in the back.  Really??Way over priced for what it was.   I likely won't go back, my significant other said she would give it a delivery chance.
2017-07-07,4,Omg the french toast croissant  is INSANELY good.  I honestly think about it all the time.  Great wine selection and the servers all know what compliments each meal.
2017-06-13,5,Grand Vin has rapidly become our favorite Tuesday spot! They have a special for their wine flights which give you 3 different quarter glasses of wine for $12. They also have a special for their cheese & meat platters. They have the best bread and delicious olive oil based dip with basil. So good- I eat way too much when I'm there. And they always bring you more if you ask! If we start with a cheese and meat platter we usually end up ordering half portions from the menu for our main course. It still comes with a lot of food; we always leave very full. I definitely recommend starting with a flight and meat and cheese platter. Splitting entrees is definitely a great option for a place like Grand Vin too, because while they are pricey they're delicious and big! Also mentioned in other posts, the vibe is awesome. I recommend calling for a reservation even if it is early or an off day. We went on a Tuesday at 6:30 and got the last table for the night. People usually come around 7-7:30 and are staying for the night because of the vibe and calm environment.
2017-06-04,5,I came here for a dinner date and it did not disappoint. The decor was inviting and beautiful, our waitress was friendly and attentive and very knowledgeable about the drinks and menu. It was very crowded on a Friday night luckily I made a reservation (would highly recommend). A bit pricey ($25+ entrees) but the food was delicious. Great spot for a date
2017-06-04,4,Hidden gem in Hoboken for italian cuisine. I had seafood ravioli which was spectacular. Veal meatballs were amazing. Will certainly be back for dinner and more italian flavors. Music can be loud but atmosphere is lively.Brunch however was alright, nothing out of ordinary. I had avocado toast benedict. The avocado spread was so thin, barely even on toast. :( Not my favorite brunch spot. I'll be back for pasta and meatballs. (drooling already)
2017-06-03,3,I've been here for drinks a handful of times and finally had a chance to eat lunch here. The Yelp reviews seemed great and open table rarely has reservations so i thought it would be a slam dunk. When my friends couldn't get reservations for lunch online, I walked by and asked if tables were available and they were. When we got there the place was half empty so I couldn't figure out why the reservations weren't open online. Then when I saw how slow the service was, my only guess is that they shut down reservations since the correct amount of wait staff isn't there for Saturday brunch / lunch. It took 10 minutes to get seated (no help was around). 15 minutes after that just to meet our waiter and order drinks. And one friend who ordered coffee didn't get his cup until 30 mins after (they said they were brewing some but it doesn't take that long to make coffee). The food was Great however! Sangria was delicious and my pear salad was everything I hoped it was. My friends all liked their meals too.. the pulled pork hash was a hit with us all (we like to share). My other friend did get a salad instead of fries and that salad looked more like the greens that come under a dish as decoration. So- I don't recommend a side salad replacement. Overall would I come back? Probably, but my expectations on service would be low.
2017-06-03,5,To start off, the ambiance is beautiful and the staff couldn't be any nicer. The food was incredible and didn't take too long to come out. I had the steak with roasted potatoes. The sauce was so flavorful and the steak was cooked to perfection. My friend had the short ribs, (which i tried) and was just as amazing as my plate. I'm honestly surprised this place doesn't have 5 stars.
2017-05-31,4,Very nice local spot off the main drag in Hoboken. It's decorated very nice and has a hip vibe. There is a large bar menu and a decent size food menu. The restaurant is very loud and the first time I went I had good service second time was not as great. Food I've tried/reviews:AppetizersCrab Guacamole: Excellent. A unique spin on traditional guacamole. Had a lot of crab pieces in it. It's a very savory app and big enough to share.Burrata: Very good. Nice presentation, decent for sharing, comes with capicola, prosciutto, tomatoes, olives. Can't go wrong with some fresh burrata so I recommend this appetizer.Entrees:Rigatoni with bacon, chicken, prosciutto, creamy mascarpone cheese sauce: I ordered the full size which was a very large portion. It's a very creamy and heavy dish so just be prepared. Good wintertime dish because of the creamy sauce. Very salty because of the prosciutto. Shrimp with spinach, mozzarella, prosciutto, white wine sauce, broccoli: Decent dish, the shrimps were salty because of the prosciutto and sauce. The broccoli on the side was alright but I think they can come up with a better side for the dish. Maybe like a sautéed broccoli rabe in garlic and oil. Definitely recommend if you're not interested in a meat dish. Dessert:Chipwich: Excellent. Reasonably priced. Two cookies with ice cream in between - doesn't get much better than that!Gran Fin is a good date spot or for an evening out with friends. Definitely make a reservation because it gets very crowded in there. I also think they have some good drink specials so I'd look out for that as well!
2017-05-28,2,The service was so slow that it stopped me from enjoying the food (which was alright).  The people next to us sat down about 45 minutes after we did and got their food before we did.  We ordered the same meals and when we asked the waitress where our entrees were, she said that the kitchen was backed up.  It felt like our waitress didn't seem to remember that we were there at all.  They also overcharged me on my wine.  Not worth going here.
2017-05-13,4,Only had calamari, happy hour oysters, wine on tap and a beer and made me want to come back for more. Place might try too hard on the look of an old school French bistro but make up for it with old school Service.
2017-05-12,4,Girls night out, party of two. Thursday is 'ladies night' which they offer mules, tap wine, and dirty martinis for $7.00 until 7:00pm. They require reservations, NBD. We were able to sit at the high top. Dirty martini to start, with blue cheese stuffed olives, very good. Awesome bread and flavorful Olive Oil is brought over. Burrata as an app- perfect size for two who aren't that hungry, I couldn't get enough wish I would've ordered my own. The grand salad with shrimp was perfect. My only recommendation is changing the plating to maybe something round and more bowl like I think it's easier on the eyes especially when you get around 3 large shrimp, four goat cheese crumbles, handful of nuts, two strawberries, and a TON of arugula. Will def be coming back here.
2017-05-07,3,Beautiful rustic Italian wine bar! I've been here a handful of times and had an overall wonderful experience. This past Friday was the first time I dined here and felt that it's important to share my thoughts to explain why I'm deducting two stars. The waiter was antsy the entire time, felt quite rushed... keep in mind we were seated at 6pm and the restaurant was nearly empty so I don't know why we were being rushed. Also we ordered 3-4 carafes of wine in addition to food so it's not like we were just sitting around at an empty table. One thing I would like to note is that the guacamole (first course) comes with just a few chips, not enough to finish the guacamole. So we kindly asked for more chips, however the waiter responded as if it was a ridiculous request. Also we were charged for more chips which I felt was petty for a restaurant with such high caliber. Lastly we were a table of four for the dining portion. Two friends joined us for the last half hour as we were wrapping up and didn't eat. When the bill came gratuity was automatically added as we were technically a "table of 6". Should have just settled the bill and went to the bar as I did not feel the waiter deserved his 20% gratuity. Will consider returning but probably will not dine here again!
2017-04-20,5,Grand Vin is essentially our second home. You can always expect top notch service from the staff especially our favorite bartender, Rich. The food is great and ambiance is stellar! Live music Wednesday Thursday Friday and Saturday. Can't beat it. If you're in Hoboken, go here now...Dan will welcome you with open arms!
2017-04-20,5,I came here at 8pm on Wednesday night. This place is around the corner from me, so I have been for a place of wine and a classic meat/cheese plate at the bar. I decided to sit down for a meal and I was not disappointed. I ordered the short ribs with parmesan risotto and my boyfriend got the salmon. The short ribs were amazing, and the waitress recommended a great wine to pair with. They have great deals every night of the week, and awesome live music. It's a good place to get apps and sit at the bar, and as I now know, to also have a delicious meal.
2017-04-09,3,Ok this place is nothing special nice venue but bad service. The food was descent I tried the pear salad but there was barely any prosciutto on it. They should charge more for the salad if they need to give more meat. The lady messed up on our check too, we ordered a tuna burger and it's suppose to come with fries we asked to substitute the avocado fries not knowing how different it was. So we ordered a side of truffle fries and she charged us for both? Lol that's not good service when the fries are suppose to come with the burger. Anyways, whatever she didn't get a good tip from me and I can't remember the last time I've tipped under 20%
2017-04-07,5,Marc is the BEST, makes a great drink. The ambiance is beautiful and the food is delicious. The live music is amazing to top it all off. Definitely deserves five stars!!!
2017-04-04,4,I went to the grand opening of Grand Vin and have gone several times since. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant and it's in a great location between my uptown and downtown friends. The bartenders are super helpful when offering recommendations on wine, the oysters during happy hour were delightful and there's usually a seat or two open at the bar.
2017-04-01,1,Brunch was subpar and they charge per cup of coffee.  11 coffees $28 bucks and were never made aware of this.  Horseshit service, never coming back
2017-03-11,4,We used to live down the street from the Three A's so we were very curious about Grand Vin.   I think they did a very good job updating the space. We went on a Thursday night and luckily got a high top (I'll make sure to make reservations next time just in case). They also had a singer with an acoustic guitar that night. Although he wasn't playing loudly, the space is VERY LOUD for a wine bar. Can you please do something about the noise level?As for the food, the Stuffed Chicken was very tasty although the plate looked like 2 lumps of white on a white plate. The dish needs some green if only for presentation purposes. The Capellini with peas, mushrooms, and prosciutto was excellent. I would have liked another slice of prosciutto but I'd order that dish again in an instant. Didn't know whether we needed to order bread or not. We didn't get any.As befitting their name, the wine list is a very good list for Hoboken, with a wide variety of wine and not just the obvious choices. Well done! My only quibble was that they were out of the Chianti Classico that evening and substituted a Chianti Colli Senesi instead at the same price. Don't worry, no one else will notice.
2017-03-10,4,Very nice atmosphere, good, attentive service. Short rib entree was phenomenal, crab guacamole app came with oily potato chips instead of the typical tortilla chips.. nice touch if there were more of them and if they weren't so greasy. I ordered a Bloody Mary but they did not have the ingredients so, I ordered a cocktail on the menu instead which had basil infused vodka however the drink was horrible and tasted extremely smoky and very much like it had whiskey and not vodka.
2017-03-10,2,Big selection of drinks - wine cocktails and beer. Nice ambience and cute decor. However it is extremely LOUD in here and it's hard to hold a conversation. Service was okay. The waiter didn't seem to understand what we were asking for half the time and had to keep repeating myself. Not very vegan or vegetarian friendly. Just a few options- mostly just salad. The kale and butternut squash salad came out pretty skimpy and plain. They could have definitely jazzed it up more. There were probably like 4-5 cubes of squash and 2 pecans.. at least throw a little more on there! The waiter also didn't know what vegan meant. I asked if the vinaigrette was vegan and he said he didn't know so he was just gonna put it on the side. Did not offer to find out or offer any alternatives.There is bread served complimentary with olive oil. However the food took FOREVER to come out. Waited at least an hour. Our reservation was at 8pm, we probably ordered at 8.30pm by the time we got seated, and we got our food at almost 10pm!!Probably won't return here.
2017-03-05,5,Chose this place for my boyfriends birthday dinner & it certainly didn't disappoint. We walked in no reservation around 430 on a Saturday luckily we were seated momentarily. Our waitress was great brought out bread, helped us out with wine choices & gave samples to make sure it was to our liking. Meat & cheese board was delicious and our entrees as well. We ordered from the specials the filet mignon & the Parmesan crusted chicken.. both were delicious as well as an order of the truffle fries. I secretly asked the waitress if they sang happy birthday and although she did not sing the dessert had a little candle lit for my boyfriend to blow out. All in all we had a great time although the bar and front area was busy my boyfriend and myself felt like the only ones there. The decor, ambiance and music was perfect! Definitely a new favorite for us!
2017-03-04,4,It certainly wasn't easy...When the better half offers to take me out for dinner I will always choose Italian.  Gran Vin has been around just over a year now and seems to be thriving with the locals.  We had reservations (highly recommended) for 7:30 and the restaurant was already very crowded.  After a glass of wine at the bar we were seated shortly thereafter.  It is a dimly lit restaurant which sets the tone for a nice evening out with a special someone. Our server Ricki was on point, even offering recommendations off the specials and main menu because it was the first Friday of Lent.  We came up with.....Two appetizers, baked eggplant and clams oreganata.  Both were very delicious and lightly battered.  For our entrees I had the shrimp dish with mozzarella (minus the prosciutto) in a white wine sauce and steamed broccoli.  The Mrs had the Chilean Sea Bass served in a lemon white wine sauce over sautéed spinach with garlic. Since no dinner out is complete without dessert we split the limoncello cake with blueberries, it was served with raspberry sauce and whipped cream. A very nice way to cap off our night.
2017-02-27,3,A freshly renovated space; the owners did a really nice job of upgrading a dive bar into a wine bar with a nice ambiance. Came here for an early dinner and while it was mostly empty when we arrived, is was mostly full by the time we left. We partook in some of the happy hour specials, $5 tap wine and $1 oysters, both of which were good. We opted for small plates all around and got a decent mix. Steamed artichoke - never had a steamed artichoke before. It's an interesting experience scraping the flesh off of the leaves. Not sure how to eat it? As your waitress for advice on how to manage it. The artichoke is pleasantly soaked in a rich, beef broth and a garlic aioli to dip. Burrata with Prosciutto - a good dish. The burrata is less melty than I would have liked, but still good. Veal Meatballs with Ricotta - the classic combination of meatballs and ricotta always works. Another good dish. Capellini - this was the most surprising dish of the night. I ended up enjoying it more than I expected to, with a flavorful meat sauce with peas and Prosciutto with a little bit of cream. Total for 4 glasses of wine, the food, and 2 cocktails came to about $150 including tax and tip, making it one of the more expensive places in Hoboken. The food was all good, but nothing outstanding or overly memorable. If you are looking for classic Italian or a wine bar, I would recommend Otto Strada (half the price, better food, BYOB) or Bin 14 (same price, far better food). Would I come back here? Sure, but I'd prefer one of the other two places I mentioned.
2017-02-18,5,Had brunch today at Grand Vin. Got there about 1.  Place was pretty full.Sat at a table opposite the bar.  Rich the bartender was our server.  Food was great.  Ordered the grilled chicken blt.  Great choice!  They offer a good selection of beers in bottle and on tap. Rich was fun and very accommodating to all our needs.  Left about 3:30.  Great food and a really nice Saturday brunch.
2017-02-11,5,My boyfriend and I had dinner here last Friday night and we had a wonderful time. Our server Laura was super sweet and attentive to us. I had the short ribs and my boyfriend had the capellini and both were incredibly delicious- compliments to the chef. The overall experience was great and we highly recommend grand Vin! We will be back.
2017-02-10,1,I'm with Jessica W. on this one. Super confused on the hype. Went after exceptional ratings from more than one person only to be met with major disappointment. The vibe here is way snooty and we had bartender Rich who played favorites with his clientele all night. Don't recommend if you're looking for an enjoyable atmosphere and a place you'll get the service you'd expect at a basic human level.
2017-02-04,4,20 of us went here for brunch on a Saturday. Large crowd, yes, but they couldn't handle it, even with a reservation and not being that busy otherwise. One of the girls at our table used to work here, so for much of the brunch, she took matters into her own hands.The service is the only reason I'm at 4 stars. The food was delicious.We ordered truffle fries and croissant French toast to start. Both were great and the fries we hand cut, which always excites me. I can't speak for the avocado fries, but everyone else seemed to enjoy them, which is why I never got to try them. For mains, I ordered the crab cake Benedict and split half with someone who ordered the avocado toast Benedict. The crab cake tasted fresh. The avocado may as well have been guacamole. As for cocktails the winter white sangria had a nice bite. Not too sweet and smooth for consumption. Overall, very nice space and abysmal service but very reasonable prices. The total for all of us was around $800 before tip.
2017-01-28,4,I have only been here once the other night. I only came here based on reviews from my yelp friends. It seems like a local place where half the place is a bar and they do a pretty good business. It seemed weird that there were mostly ladies sipping wine at the bar so guys get off the couch and get in there and mingle. The food I thought was pretty good as well and the waitress, Kimberly was excellent!!!
2017-01-27,4,Delightful. String lights galore. Creates an environment in Hoboken that actually feels like a mini, folksy subset of the city. Really loved the vibe, food, and attention to detail. Will be back (but it's been so crowded...looks like someone's been spilling my secrets!).
2017-01-23,5,What an awesome place! Celebrated my sis' bday Sat night along with 2 cousins bdays also. Great crowd, live music, nice bartenders, space, ambience etc. Place was clean, pretty, good food too! Definitely a must try! Owner is very cool also.Drinks could be a bit stronger but we really enjoyed ourselves.
2017-01-18,4,Stopped by for dinner with girlfriends on a rainy Thursday night and enjoyed our time here.It took a bit to get seated even tho there were a bunch of open tables. By the end of our meal the dining room was packed. Meat & cheese board was average, I'd pass on this. Crab guac was yummy and so was the winter crostini trio. Rigatoni was DEF our fave, you just can't go wrong with mascarpone cheese sauce & prosciutto, sigh. Can't recall the dessert but I typically don't like sweet stuff. They have some wines on the happy hour special, which is def lacking. Wish they had some more drinks and food options!Can't wait to check out the short ribs with parmesan risotto next time.
2017-01-16,2,I am super confused by the current ratings for this restaurant. I had such a bad experience coming here from the service to the food. The seating is very tight, I was shown to the table and we were given menus. Our waitress came and it felt as if we were being pressured to order immediately. She wasn't helpful, knowledgeable, courteous or even pleasant to be around. We ordered meatballs, tuna tartar and I had an eggplant appetizer and my date had a steak. The whole meal Was unappetizing. The steak he said was okay, and my eggplant was decent but the tun tartar was borderline gross. The tuna was poor quality there was no real sauce or flavor and avocado wasn't ripe... what the heck?!?!Our wine was good, not stellar but it was just an awful experience. I won't ever be back.
2017-01-13,1,I really wanted to like this but the fish dish came out like a damp cloth and I had to send the fries back since it was so soggy.  Hoboken needs better restaurants.
2017-01-12,4,What a gorgeously decorated restaurant - perfect for a date night. Food options were good portions and reasonably priced - the waitress was knowledgeable about wine pairings as well. definitely will be going back!
2017-01-10,5,This is one of my favorite places to go in Hoboken! I usually come here for dinner. I absolutely love the tuna tartare which is the best I have ever tasted. Sometimes I come here just for the tuna tartare. They have a great cocktail menu and a unique option for brine. My boyfriend recently tried their brine and said it was really interesting and really great. The atmosphere is one of the best parts of this place. With string white lights on the ceiling and an earthy aesthetic, this place is very welcoming and romantic. I have also had the capallini (angel hair pasta with peas, mushrooms, and prosciutto in meat sauce) here which was fantastic. The brunch is also done very well here. All around this is a great restaurant with great food and I would highly recommend it.
2016-12-29,5,I like the vibe of this resteraunt.  Have sat both outside and inside for dinner..Very friendly wait staff. My only gripe is the veal meatballs..being a vegetarian for 25 years this made me a bit upset.
2016-12-28,5,We rented out their dining room for a private party and are so happy we did. The ambiance is perfect - industrial chic feel with wooden tables and steel accents, greenery and little white lights in the ceiling make a warm and modern combination. The food was delicious and awesome beer and drink menu. Service was excellent. Our guests raved about how beautiful the space was and the food. The shining star is Anne Marie, their event planner. She went above and beyond to plan the exact event we wanted and was always in close communication, open to our ideas, and provided great ideas too as to food options, set up of the space, and more. If you are considering having a private party here - do it. You won't be disappointed.
2016-12-17,5,Thank you Vito for reminding us to come to the old Three A's. Mike the bartender gave us a warm welcome and is continuing to make wonderful drinks. Started out with the OUTRAGEOUS artichoke and all the dishes we are eating are wonderful. Having a great start to Santacon.
2016-12-15,1,Okay so went here on a Thursday night and our experience was horrible. The hosts kept chatting amongst themselves and didn't attend us. We called for a rigatoni pasta and we were offered something else which was nothing similar to the description. Later when we complained about it..we were given a replacement which was not good at all. We were really disappointed with this place. Only the ambience is amazing but the service and food are not good.
2016-12-14,2,Ambiance and food was great, but the service was very frustrating. The main reason was because our waitress was trying to upsell like I've never seen before. It felt like she was a foot-in-the-door vacuum salesperson who made us feel uncomfortable by saying "no, no, we are okay" over and over. The first upsell was absolutely absurd. We ordered a $42.00 bottle of Pinot Noir and she recommended a different bottle instead. Okay, fair game, I get it- I then see that the bottle she recommends is $118.00...!! I can understand an upsell from $42 to like $51 but to even recommend a bottle that is $80.00 MORE than the one I ordered is absolutely terrible service/waitressing. As someone who was a server for many years, this is unacceptable.We went in for a bottle of wine and a couple of appetizers, and even after saying that, were read the entire entree menu. We then were told that two appetizers we ordered seemed like not enough and asked if we want to order more. Saying "no, no, we're okay" over and over starts ruining the vibe- not to mention is annoying/gives a feeling of guilt. Once we were nearing the end of the meal, our waitress asked us "Are you going to want dessert or do you want the check?" Again- making us feel rushed/guilty for "wasting" her time- even though it was a Wednesday and the place wasn't packed to the brim or anything/ not to mention the $90.00 check. Really disappointed in this service as I walk by this place a lot and have always wanted to give it a try. Most likely will not come back.
2016-12-08,4,very nice place with great wine list, good pasta dishes friendly staff excellent service
2016-12-04,4,Great food, excellent service, and tasteful ambiance. Be sure to make a reservation or expect a long wait. There's a fairly decent wine list with nice per-glass options. The meatballs and gnocchi were fantastic, but the halibut (my wife's dish) was nothing special. Food suggestions: steak or pasta
2016-12-03,4,Waking into restaurant the decor was wonderful, drink were on point, and the food was amazing. The restaurant added a nice touch with live music. Everyone super friendly and cater to your needs.
2016-11-30,4,This place is so good, and is much cuter than I'd expect in NJ. The short: we came here for a work dinner on a rainy Tuesday night. We had an amazing, long, not-rushed meal, with great drinks, awesome service in a chill environment.The longer: we came here as a walk-in at around 6PM for an early working dinner. We started with wine (extensive wine list and some wine on tap), and my other coworker had a champagne cocktail that she loved. We basically ordered one of everything (we shared a bunch of apps). The complimentary bread is warm and served with a basil olive oil that's super yummy. My favorites: the meat & cheese plate (cheeses especially were SO good), the meatballs, the shrimp oreganata, and the eggplant. The star of the show for me, though, might be the unreal peanut butter cake. What I could live without: the caramel lava cake was okay - the ice cream was good and the center of the cake was good, but the actual cake had a weird texture (spongey flan). The autumn crostinis were cool and seasonal, but we had enough bread with the meat & cheese and the complimentary bread. We so appreciated the ability to sit and eat and chat without being rushed. Our waitress was great, and the bill was really reasonable for 5 apps, 2 desserts & 6 drinks.They have $1 happy hour and wine discounts. My friends have come here on the weekend, and they love the live music. Overall, super cute Hoboken spot and I highly recommend!
2016-11-20,2,I like Grand Vin for wine and have been a few times. Last week I had dinner with four friends there and we had a less than stellar experience. I called several days later and asked to speak to the manager and he hasn't returned my call so I'll leave my comments here. It was Tuesday night, we had a reservation for 5 people at 6:30. No issue there. We ordered wine and some appetizers and a few mins after, ordered our entrees. We waited well over an hour for our entrees after having our apps. We began to wonder if they'd forgotten to put in our order. The waiter disappeared for a while and we had to seek him out.Someone else delivered our entrees. Three of us ordered the filet special and while it was cooked as ordered there was no mention of the gravy on the steak. I again had to seek out the server. I asked him if the gravy had wheat in it and he checked with the kitchen and returned and said there was no wheat. I knew better but after waiting for so long I was ready to eat and get home. Who knows when I would have next received my steak had I sent it back. It was terrible salty brown liquid and it did contain wheat. I've been sick for days. Thanks for that. I'm irritated and also bummed. I would like Gran Vin to be a place I could put in to regular rotation, but after this I am in no rush to return.
2016-11-14,4,Great wine bar!Only stopped in after a paint night at the Art Vino Hoboken location. We ordered Sauvignon Blancs for everyone and it was delicious - I wish I asked for the bottle so I can buy it at a store. Will definitely return for the great relaxing atmosphere!Bonus/surprise was the live music!
2016-11-12,5,Fantastic atmosphere!  Excellent food!  Fabulous service (ask for Mike)!  What more could you want?!?!  Have enjoyed "The Vin" 5 times and every time is superb!
2016-11-11,4,This is a truly hidden gem in Hoboken. $1 oysters, extensive wine list, yummy food, live music, and rustic/romantic decor.... I am so in love with Grand Vin. Halifax is always our go-to place for happy hour, but I am so, so excited to have stumbled upon this place (thanks to Yelp!) We were here for farewell drinks for a work friend, and had a lovely evening.We started out with a bottle of red from Oregon and $1 oysters. The bread here is so good! The oysters weren't the best I've had but then we got the fra diavola pasta special with lobster and clams and we were licking our plates clean. The veal special was OK but the bone marrow was reallyyy good. Crostini was also decent, but I wish we had it with the oysters rather than our entrees. Overall, the food did not disappoint. Towards the end of our meal, our waiter informed us that we had to give up our table for another party who was doing the wine tasting dinner. This was a bit unpleasant but we did walk-in just for happy hour, and we were fine to move. The owner, Dan, went above and beyond to accommodate us and gave us another bottle on the house... plus some shots. Then the live music started, and what started as happy hour at 530pm ended in dinner and wine until 9.Overall, highly highly recommended for happy hour or dinner. What a lovely place! Make sure to get reservations as it can get packed later at night.
2016-11-01,5,5 stars for ambiance, wine, service, and food! Definitely recommend this place on a Friday night with live music. My favorite restaurant in Hoboken!
2016-10-24,3,I love the decor, location, and idea of this place. I live just a few blocks away but hadn't been here yet so we came for brunch and it just didn't meet my expectations. Our waiter was really nice and attentive so definitely thumbs up on his service. They have really large champagne glasses so their mimosas - of all flavors - are basically just juice. We asked for some with 'just a splash' of juice.. aka a normal mimosa and they did send those out but becuase of the lack of juice they only filled the glasses about 1/3 of the way. I won't fault them for being strict on their champagne pours but maybe they should consider smaller flutes so that a well proportioned cocktail doesn't look so measly? The bartender also took forever to make the drinks and then they would bring them over one by one... for a table of 7. So count on at least 20min for a round of drinks to be made and brought to you.I ordered the Pulled Pork Hash. The pork itself was quite tasty, but there were no visible peppers and onions and I only had 3 little bite-sized chunks of potatoes. How is that hash? The serving of pork was big - so big I took some to go - but I would have preferred a well constructed meal instead of a heap of just pork. My friends had a few variations of the eggs Benedict and really liked them. We will likely return and give this place another shot because we now know how to order drinks the right way and I'll stay away from poorly interpreted menu items because the dinner menu looks great.
2016-10-21,4,After staring at the tiny print and extremely long wine list of many varieties I've never heard of we decided on the house chardonnay which was really good. It would be helpful to have descriptions of the lesser known wine and offer a flight to try a few or at least a sommelier to explain. The food was excellent they served bread with olive oil that was infused with fresh basil which was delicious. We tried 3 varieties of cheese a goat/truffle, gouda and sharp variety, and the veal meatballs which were in a fantastic tomato sauce (tasted very fresh and not sweet). After that we were pretty full but decided to try the snapper special which was awesome it was covered in a creamy sauce and served with mashed potatoes. Definitely not the healthiest meal, but it was all delicious. I'm not a fan of most Hoboken restaurants, its great to find a place in town I can look forward to coming back to.
2016-10-15,4,Solid 4 stars for excellent food, service and ambiance. Veal meatball app with ricotta was amazing! I had the scallops special as my entree- perfectly cooked and served in a light butter sauce. I also tried the seasonal pumpkin gnocchi- delicious! Great presentation.Finished the meal with a dessert rec by our waitress- a chocolate chip cookie sandwich. Perfect ending to the meal. Just look at the picture! Bar area was nice and had live music. Fun date night spot or night out with friends. Highly recommend!
2016-10-12,5,My boyfriend and I have made nearly weekly appearances at this restaurant since it opened, and it never disappoints. The atmosphere is wonderful, the wine and cocktails are excellent, and the food (omg the ravioli) is amazing. Highly recommend this place for anyone looking to escape the Hoboken sports bars for a higher class, great wine bar!
2016-10-08,5,Had my birthday dinner here and was so impressed by the decor and food. I ordered the chicken which was encrusted in Parmesan and it came with carrots, asparagus and potatoes. It was very good. Everyone else at the table raved about their food as well. The drinks were good too, but a little on the pricey side. The atmosphere was really cute and I loved the lights hanging from the ceiling! Very cozy!
2016-10-07,5,**Our new favorite spot**We sat at the bar and the bartender was more of a mixologist. You could tell he loved what he did. We had red wine and tequila drink ... yes wine and tequila together! The cheese boards are beautiful. Warm bread. Both our meals were delicious- we had the rigatoni and the breaded lemon chicken. Lovely atmosphere and beautifully decorated.
2016-09-20,5,I really like this place.  It has everything.  Firstly, I came here a couple of time for drinks.  They have so many wine choices and even wines on tap.  They have 2 reds on tap that are great.  My wife loves bubbles and they have that on tap as well.  The bartenders were very nice.The atmosphere is inspiring.  I am not kidding.  The decor looks awesome with its lighting and motif.  It is a chill place to drink some great wines.  On Friday nights they have an acoustic guitar who does covers.  It is always entertaining.We finally went for dinner and it was yummy.  The free bread and butter are of great quality.  The bread was warm and the butter was soft.  It is the little things that make a place great.  We ordered a Rigatoni pasta for an appetizer because the pasta is homemade.  It was awesome.  The pasta is definitely done well.  The sauce and the ingredients was good as well.  We wanted a little more bacon.  It really brought the dish together, but there wasn't much of it.  We ordered the steak and the chicken.  My wife actually didn't like the chicken, but I loved them lemon sauce.  She enjoyed here steak very much.  Her side of fries was amazing.Sadly, there was one problem.  We got a caramel lava cake that was terrible.  It was very bland!  I don't know what happened, but it was not good.  SKIP IT!So, a restaurant that does so much deserves this ratings. They have great Italian food.  It has a great night life with an amazing decor.  The bartenders and servers are friendly.  They have plenty of wines.  It was really an A.
2016-09-13,5,Love love. Excellent food. YumBaby friendly too. Love the meatball and artichoke apps
2016-09-09,4,Only giving 4 stars because the service still needs improvement. It definitely takes some time to get your food, but nonetheless it comes out hot and delicious. Love this place !
2016-09-08,4,Great setting and wonderful service. The drinks are well made with special care in particular the cocktails! Food is well presented, sourced and made! Highly Recommended!
2016-09-06,4,Good food, wine, and service!  I went here with some girlfriends and we shared appetizers and 2 small pasta plates.  I liked the wine selection though none of us tried the wine on tap - we went the more traditional bottle route.  For a Tuesday night, it was packed and I felt bad for our waitress as it appeared there were only 2 of them handing the entire restaurant - though this did not diminish our service.  I'm glad Hoboken has opened a place like this - the ambiance was great and this would make an excellent date spot.
2016-08-21,5,Great wine selection!  This was much needed in the downtown area of Hoboken...live music and ambiance are good, as are the food options
2016-08-18,5,This place is fantastic.  Food is great, ambiance is amazing, the decor is on a new level for Hoboken.  Closest thing to a west village restaurant that Hoboken has.  I met the owner briefly, very nice young fella... Will definitely be going back soon.   Hoboken needs more places like this..
2016-08-17,5,Place really was excellent. I went with an Italian from Italy who spoke Italian to our Sicilian waitress all night so it's all authentic. The food was excellent start to finish. Great appetizers, steamed artichoke came out perfectly cooked; the Sicilian wine we had was spot on and the angel hair was a little oversauced but tasted great. The seating is also just spaced enough to give some privacy but full enough to give a nice liveliness. Vine leaves wrapped in lights on the ceiling give a nice ambiance. Good place for a date. Recommend in a town where there are few good Italian options.
2016-08-15,3,A little disappointed. We had a 8:30 reservation. Sat down immediately and ordered drinks. Drinks came around 9:15. A little long to wait for a drink. The service was incredibly slow and the portion sizes very small for $25-35 per plate. They said portions were big enough to share and I didn't think so at all. Also not a true Italian meal. A lot better options around town. I was upset because the decor was so cute  and welcoming. Also no AC. Realllllly hot inside.
2016-08-10,5,Hoboken needed a venue like this. It give's such an fantastic option for a weekday dinner and drinks out or great dining on the weekend. The choices in Hoboken get rather stale, Gran Vin makes all the others step up a notch.We hosted my college sports team end of season event here. The staff was awesome in helping us get setup and organizing an event for 150 of our guests. We will be going back this year.Thanks to Mike, Danny and Crew
2016-08-09,5,Absolutely LOVE this place. Food is FABULOUS!!!!! I love the brunch menu. Once of my favorites is the crab cake egg Benedict. So yummy! The surf and turf Bloody Mary is out of this world also! You honestly cannot go wrong with anything you pick. The service is always great and the atmosphere is wonderful. I love the decor. Honestly my fave place in Hoboken.  I would recommend this place 1000 times! Deff a must try.
2016-08-05,2,Atmosphere and service is great but the food...below average especially for the price. The $9 summer salad with goat cheese was tiny with barely any cheese. It should have been bigger and heartier for the price. Also got the baked eggplant appetizer. Again, 2 small pieces of eggplant for $12?? So salty I couldn't even eat it. My husband's dish, stuffed chicken. Again, small and nothing special. Also in a very salty gravy. (FYI, I love salt and put it on pancakes and it was still too salty for me). We ended dinner with an overly sweet chipwich dipped in fake chocolate with fake chocolate drizzle for dessert. This restaurant is pretending to be something it's not. If you want to pay a lot of money for food, make it worthwhile and go to Anthony David's. Or just go here for drinks, atmosphere and the live music.
2016-08-05,5,Great spot in Hoboken!!! Atmosphere is chic with beautiful dim lighting and cool decor. Food is also great and changes periodically.  Awesome date spot and the place has an amazing wine selection.
2016-08-01,4,Well wasnt sure what o expect , went for a friends birthday . There was about 10 of us. Draft beers were not available due to it being broke. But it was a nice place, all people very friendly, waiter was quick an seemed to appreciate our party. Beer menu was great.  We had some apps that were good. Kept alll the glasses filled , which i guess was a good thing, but not sure if they were just trying to increase the bill. We ordered Jack Daniels shots which seemed a little watered down, but gave us a whole round on the house. My girl got a jack an ginger and seemed the same way so id stick with beer an or wine. Over all if i lived closer id go back , food that other people ordered looked great an there was no short of people coming in an out and they had some live music as well. Again i know i seemed a little critical but id go back or recommend it
2016-07-31,5,Obsessed with this place. Hoboken needed a new date night spot and this is it. The vibe is rustic and chic, wine and food on point. Heard that they are starting wine tasting happy hours- can't wait!
2016-07-31,4,My husband and I stopped in for brunch and grabbed a seat at the bar. What a marvelous improvement from the old 3 A's.  We ordered the surf and turf bloody mary to start which was delicious, topped with an olive, bacon, and large shrimp.  I'm very picky about my bloodys, these were great.  For food we had the crab cakes benedict and the French onion burger.  Both were great but I liked the crab cakes best. Really well done.  The burger was good, but I found the pretzel bun to be a bit hard for my liking & it was hard to eat, I prefer a softer bun.  The bartender was overwhelmed, making it difficult to flag down a water refill or condiments, but it was understandable as its a large bar top and it was full - should really have 2 ppl tending.  We will 100% be back again.
2016-07-22,2,I came here over a month ago and thought it was great. I came back tonight and was beyond disappointed and frustrated in every aspect of my experience. There are way too many issues to even list but the main one I need to say is that this place needs to figure out its identity. Is it a dive bar or it is a classy restaurant? The menu claims 'you don't have to go to Manhattan to get the Manhattan experience' but what I experienced was an utter disaster. We paid for appetizers at the bar that never came, even after waiting an hour and a half. We tried really hard to give this place the benefit of the doubt because of our first experience but this time we couldn't wait to leave. Long story short: you may pay Manhattan prices but don't expect Manhattan experience.
2016-07-19,5,Grand Vin was the perfect spot to celebrate my friends birthday this past weekend! The staff went out of their way to make sure that our group had a great time. The singer that night had an AMAZING voice and did great acoustic versions of all the 90s songs that we requested. To top it off the birthday girl got to make her very own playlist during his breaks! The ambience, vast wine selection and friendly demeanor of every person we came in contact with made it a night to remember. I highly recommend Grand Vin to all of my Hoboken neighbors. You won't regret it!
