2021-11-05,5,Best sicilian slice ive tried. Make sure to get it with the sauce on top, you'll thank me later.
2021-06-09,5,Love this place they have great pizza, subs, and chicken wings.  The employees are nice and courteous.  Will definitely order again.  One of Hoboken's Finest.
2021-05-21,4,Very convenient location for picking up pizza on the go! Had gotten pizza mainly in the past, always consistent and delicious!
2020-12-05,2,Delivery was quick but wasn't super impressed with the meal. Pizza tasted like chucky cheese pizza, very doughy and thick pizza. Fries were nothing special either, tasted a little soggy :/. Not the best in Hoboken
2020-06-16,5,I've never had anything other than their Sicilian pies because tbh nothing else in the shop looks very good (so not arguing with the more negative reviews), but the pies I have had were incredible. They're my favorite pizzeria in Hoboken.
2020-06-02,5,Amazing restaurant!! A wonderfully kind family owned establishment that made my experience 10 times better! Definitely will be returning!!
2020-03-14,5,This place always saves the day! They have great pizza and an even better staff! Torna's is especially great late night and is open super late on weekends!
2020-03-14,5,Literally the best pizza! Go here every single weekend. They stay open late so it's amazing for when you're on your way home from the bar.
2020-01-24,4,Update: obsessed with their Sicilian pizza! Update to 4 stars! I am torn about this place - questionable pizza but best no frills meatball parm. This place looks like a hole in the wall and logically you would think they should have  the best pizza. This is probably my least favorite pizza joint in Hoboken. I tried it twice when I was desperately hungry and regretted both times. Recently someone told me that their meatball parm is the best no frills meatball parm in town so naturally I have to try them out. Unlike their pizza, their meatball parm is on point. If you're craving meatball parm, look no further.
2019-11-03,1,I bought a slice and accidentally left my vape on the counter while paying, Came back to get it and the guys pretended it was never there. So shitty, I remember where I left it, which is why I came back... yet it was GONE. I feel ripped off by the employees and won't return. So disappointing after being a patron for years- will settle for Benny Tudino's in the future.
2019-10-21,4,Make no mistake , this is legit local pizza . A soft textured chewy crust , mild sweet sauce and standard mozzarella with a good ratio make this a tasty pie . This is not a modern gourmet type pizza but more of a old school working man style pie . Nothing pretty , nothing fancy but still gets the job done .  Reasonably priced too !
2019-09-09,2,Was really disappointed in this place. I really wanted to like this place as I live nearby.. I gave an extra star just because the people who served us (who also looked like the family owners) were nice. Everything we ordered seemed burnt/overcooked. The flavors weren't there. The quality wasn't there. I was just overall confused. To be fair, their prices are unbeatable but my roommate and I couldn't finish our food cause we were very unsatisfied.Our calamari was rubbery and dull (frozen? I assume). The garlic knots we ordered tasted like burnt bread. My personal pizza barely had any pineapples and I wasn't even interested to try my roommate's sub because it didn't look appetizing either.It's pretty clear and unfortunate but I def don't recommend this place. I truly wanted to like it.Pros:Open late nightAffordableCons:QualityFood
2019-08-29,1,Really wanted to like this place, but sadly I found the food to not only be low quality, but also over priced. The cheese was extremely salty. The dough, mushy and the sauce flavorless. I made the mistake of adding chicken to my pizza. It wasn't the normal chicken breast that would be made into a chicken tender, but it was that nasty, cheap, rib meat. Yuck. Not sure how this hole in wall stays in business, but I have no desire to ever go back here again. Also, the undersized, low quality pizza cost me $18. It wasn't even appropriately priced for what you actually get.Definitely skip this place and go somewhere else...
2019-06-18,4,I've tried many of the abundant pizza places in Hoboken but I didn't even know Torna's existed until I saw it on the Slice app. We ordered for pickup one Thursday evening. We tried a regular slice, Sicilian slice, chicken tenders, baked ziti with vodka sauce, and the meatball parm platter. The regular slice is nothing to write home about. There are plenty of better slices in the neighborhood, so don't go out of your way for this. But that Sicilian slice...might be one of the best I've had in life. It's light and fluffy with plenty of ooey gooey cheese. If you get a topping, they put it under the cheese, which was an interesting twist that I enjoyed. You can skip all of the other dishes - especially the chicken tenders. Chicken tenders from the supermarket freezer section taste better than this. We only ordered it because we had a minimum to meet for a coupon we wanted to use, and it was supposed to come with French fries (which I was craving, and we saw it was missing when we got home).I'd definitely come back for a Sicilian slice, but nothing else.
2019-03-02,4,One of my favorite places to eat in Hoboken and one of the oldest pizza places in town, it has been family owned since 1968, it's one of the last old school pizzeria's in Hoboken, love their thin crust  pizza, great staff and is opened late. They accept cash  no Apple Pay and they also deliver, there is parking nearby but best to walk or bike.
2019-01-15,4,Visited recently and the upgrades definitely paid off. Solid pizza, nice staff, a phenomenal choice for late night.
2018-10-27,2,One of the poorest quality pizza...Totally disappointed - always knew google ratings are inflated
2018-07-26,5,Been to almost every pizza place in town and this one has by far exceeded my expectations. I am usually very picky with my pizza, especially with the dough, but Tornas is an absolute favorite. Will be sticking to this place as my go to for a while.
2018-04-19,5,Without a doubt the best Sicilian slice of pizza I've ever had. 100% Old school to perfection. I took one bite and literally went to yelp to write this. Enjoy the square slice!
2018-04-06,5,The best PIZZERIA IN TOWN...cuzin Mike and Dom has turn this place which was already a gem into a piece of HEAVEN...try their sausage sandwich with the works it is the best.....also sicilian with pepperoni is NUMBER ONE IN TOWN
2018-04-02,1,This review is not for the pizza but for the service. Came in with my husband and child to order a pie. We received a really unfriendly welcome and the person was almost annoyed looking that she had to wait on customers. Were told very sternly that it would take 25 minutes. That would have been totally cool, but after the rude greeting and the sense that she did not really care or want to make our pizza, we left. It was not very busy either. So not sure why we got that response. Oh well! Plenty of other choices around.
2018-03-23,5,All we can say is... yum! I had the egg plant Parmesan and my husband had a couple different versions of the Sicilian pizza. Nice people, seems to be family owned, authentic. The best food we have found in Hoboken so far since we got here from Houston a few days ago.
2018-03-08,2,I really don't understand. I've been coming here at all hours of the night, every day of the week for 8 years and have had nothing but good things to say. But as of 2018, I don't know what's going on. On SuperBowl Sunday, hubby and I had the absolute worst Sicilian pie we've ever had. Flat, dry, no flavor, but I thought it was a one time miss being the day that it was. Tonight, we come for a second chance getting chicken parms with extra sauce and they're the driest sandwich we've ever had! With extra sauce! Usually, they're dripping with sauce and cheese. In fact, I came back to have it remade because upon further inspection, there's no cheese on the sandwich! I've been raving about their parm sandwiches and Sicilian pies for years and all of a sudden, I may need to cut them out of the rotation. I'd rather them raise the price then cut out ingredients. Soo incredibly disappointed. I'm glad they offered to remake the meal, but I shouldn't have to come back in freezing weather to remedy in the first place.
2018-01-28,3,Sandwiches are amazing especially the meatball Parm and chicken Parm and their lasagna is awesome (just note it they make it from scratch so takes about 30 mins to make). However pizza is horrible! I'm not real picky with my pizza but the pizza there is not good at all!  Definitely worth trying the sandwiches and pasta but stay away from their sauce and pizza. Update- I have to update this review because unfortunately this has proven to be a 3 star place. Pro's- The sandwiches my husband and I have ordered have always been fantastic (Italian sub, chicken and meatball parms), lasagna is good, and from reading reviews I tried their Sicilian slice which is usually amazing!  Cons- unfortunately from what we have ordered only the above have proven to be good and they waver on their Sicilian slices (sometimes hot and crispy like they should be or cold and soggy). Also their pizza is terrible, the eggplant parm dinner was atrocious ( they should be ashamed) and the calzone (we had sausage) was not even a calzone, it didn't even have ricotta on it (so weird!!). It's unfortunate that it is so difficult to find a good pizza place in Hoboken that just makes normal Italian food properly and does not just specialize in making one dish good and all the other food suffers. Recommend ordering what you already know is good and  sadly you can't even bank on that being consistent.
2018-01-20,1,Not a fan of this place for multiple reasons. Hope I don't get whacked for saying that
2017-11-17,5,Great pizza, great chicken and great meatballs. I don't order much else but I bet it's just as good. Great prices too
2017-10-15,2,These guys let themselves go. I remember the pizza used to be very good several years ago but I went recently and the inside is a mess (broker booths, dirty floors, unclean tables) and the staff doesn't really seem to give a f**k. They were too busy smoking cigarettes out front and gossiping to take care of their business. Seems like the older Italian owner who used to run the place has given the reins over to his kids or grandkids who don't respect the business nearly as much as they should. Kind of a shame because a few years ago that pizza was really good...
2017-08-15,1,This is unfortunate as I am very proud to have been a long-time pizza blogger (thatssocheezy,com), but this place was very disappointing.I had always passed it as my girlfriend lived right above the pharmacy, so the one day I grabbed a slice. They unfortunately had to cook a new pie cause the previous one burnt (I guess reasonable), but they couldn't provide me change because they didn't have money in the till and though polite, seemed pretty uncaring that I waited 20 minutes for a slice.A lot of people swear by this place as a good night place, but maybe my experience was just the rare poorly executed one. I hope to come back one day and not be disappointed.
2017-07-28,4,Another Hoboken Staple. The Sicilian slice is always so good and the chicken parm is delicious. Delivery is always fast and the prices are reasonable compared to everywhere else in town. Love that they're open so late. My only complaint would be I've called and ordered things off the menu that they said they ran out of. I could see it happening once or twice, but it's happened a lot.
2017-05-09,4,Always hot, always fresh and always flavorful. Mistakes do happen, however the company I work for was dissapointed to have received burnt pizza one day. Do you think we wouldn't have noticed?
2017-04-22,4,Good plain pie, very reasonable prices. I come here time and time again when I just can't bring myself to make dinner.I can't comment on delivery as I typically pick-up from the place as I live nearby.I would recommend a plan pie or a meat topping.I've had trouble in the past with ordering a veggie pizza as they put the toppings under the cheese which can cause certain toppings to become sort of watery I'm my opinion.
2016-12-09,4,How can you not like this place? The sicilian is very unique since they put the cheese on when you order it and its one big slice of cheese. That being said it works! Very good.Bonus points because they are open late and you cannot beat the prices. This place has been there forever and you can always count on being filled up at a good price.  It may not look like much but you dont come here for that. You come here to get a slice eat it and get out!! Ha!Dont expect to get spumoni gardens level pizza but this place has its place in my heart.
2016-10-29,3,Have been ordering from Torna's regularly for about a year. A few of the people know me. Great pizza and fast delivery. Also enjoy supporting s local family business. However, my last order was not delivered. When I called to check on the status of the delivery, the owner swore up and down that it was delivered (to a guy.... I was home alone) and wouldn't send a new pizza or reimburse me. Called seamless to see if they would reimburse me and only then did they agree to send a new pizza. Point is, I've been a regular costumer and they could have eaten the $10 and kept my business. But the costumer service was so poor in that moment that now I want to find somewhere new. :/
2016-09-29,4,Not a huge fan of Sicilian pizza, but it is the only slice i'll get from here. A1 stuff. Been in the city for years, friendly staff, good pizza
2016-09-27,3,This place is right down the street from us-very nice people, place seems clean.  We usually order the Sicilian and I just recently got the mozzarella sticks-awesome, and I'm very particular about that.  They have delivery (which we've never needed because of proximity), and they're open pretty late (nights and weekends)
2016-07-29,5,I stumbled upon Torna as it was featured on Scott's Pizza Tours Instagram. The Sicilian slices are cut into sticks, perfect to dip in bleu cheese. Their sauce is sweet and their crust is always crunchy. One of my FAVORITE pizzas in Hoboken.
2016-05-18,4,I grabbed a Sicilian square with meatball and peppers. Nice crisp. Covered in a nice cheese melt. Great price. $4 which gives it that extra star. Lively counter guy. Feels like an old timey neighborhood joint. Very small - a take out joint. Some outdoor seating which was nice when I stopped by.
2016-05-16,1,the worst pizza in Hoboken. Not only is the service horrible, when you go at night the owners kid has all his buddies behind the counter handling the food, no gloves.. I watched one kid sneeze in his hand and try to hand a girl her pizza and she refused to take it.  My buddy and i waited over 35 minutes for two plain slices and there was only 3 other people in the restaurant at that time.  To make things worse the pizza was terrible..tasted like celeste microwave pizza. Will never eat at this place again.
2016-03-05,1,WORST slice of pizza I've ever had. Bad enough that they raised the price to $3.00. No big deal. But to get pizza worse than Domino's or Papa John's, now I'm truly insulted. This really used to be a great authentic, unpretentious place. Now it is horrible. Bad crust, thin sauce, tasteless cheese. YUCK! It's so sad. I have had cheap frozen pizzas that tasted better than this. Go somewhere else. You'll be happier.
2016-02-20,1,Chicken parm sub is not made with a real chicken cutlet. Tasted like a chicken tender on a roll. It was also swimming together and soupy. Bread was soggy. Will try a different place for a chicken parm sub next time.
2016-01-20,5,If you are not a douche... this is your spot for the best Sicilian pizza you will ever get. (Yes I've been to Sicily) it's a local favorite serving out of a house. Nothing but goodness
2016-01-08,5,Fresh crust and toppings for all their food - the Sicilian is amazing with the perfect amount of garlic and they even sent us the corner slices that we asked for! And to top it off, the delivery man was so sweet! Only thing that upsets me is that this was my first time ordering but certainly not my last!!
2015-12-30,4,I may not be the biggest fan of their regular slice but the Sicilian with pepperoni is great. Friendly staff. (Be aware of the late night weekend drunk crowd!)
2015-09-18,4,Have not been here in probably over 20 yrs since moving out of Hoboken.  This place was right around the corner from us growing up so this was our pizzeria to go to.  Sometimes on bowling night we would stop in after and have a pie and I remember the orange soda with my Mom, aunt and cousin.  I  remember the 2 dogs they had many, many years ago...would hang outside.  Also going to Brandt & HHS this was always a great lunch spot.  So on this visit we ordered a meatball parm, still tastes like it did back in the day, meatballs are good, sauce is good and the toasted bread is delicious - certainly did not disappoint!  Also ordered 2 small pies.  I remember these always (to me at least) tasting better than the bigger pies.  They too were just as good as back in the day.  The overall look of the place, the same except for some tiles on the wall and now booths and not the tables I remember.  It was a very hot day and they did not have the ac on but had the door open and it was a bit unbearable.  But will def go back again for the meatball parm and small pies! Very reasonably priced for good food.  5 stars for the food, 4 was lack of ac.
2015-08-15,5,The pizza Is absolutely amazing. It's a little dirty inside but it's a family run pizza place. So good.
2015-06-28,3,Good pizza, pretty cheap for Hoboken. I go here for the convenience as it's right across the street from my apartment, although I know and strongly dislike the owner.There's always a couple of nice guys behind the counter, Pietro and another guy. They are friendly and we chat while I wait for my pie.But what's up with the one dollar credit card charge??!
2015-04-13,3,I love Torna's. I've been going there for a long time now. I always order the Sicilian pizza. They are cheap and deliver as well. It is a family owned business that has been very successful, especially with high school students, since the High School is only a few blocks away. However, i do wish they wore gloves to serve your pizza. Last time I was there, i noticed the guy was doing it with his bare hands which was nasty, and the cheese was out in the opened, not covered or anything. He also kept making snotting noises, which made it only worse. I couldn't eat my pizza in peace. I love Torna's but think they need to work on their hygiene.
2015-02-24,2,Not great, sub-par for NJ... this pizza reminded me of something you'd make at home, if you didn't really know how to make good pizza.  The pizza seemed to have some synthetic tasting garlicy oil on it... which ended up giving me terrible indigestion.  If I were you, unless you're in a bind, you'd be better off getting your pizza somewhere else.
2015-02-22,4,The food is cheap and delicious. Got the spaghetti and meatballs. Wow. Literally wow. My boyfriend got the chicken parm and it was huge. Our friend got the meatball parm and that was delicious. And again HUGE! And the delivery was super fast. Love this place!
2015-01-09,1,Oh,where do I start?!  (So although Ive always been fairly opinionated of food and restaurants, I've never really been one to voice my opinion with others, whether it may have been a positive or negative experience, however, Tornas has forced me to just that.)Due to my close living proximity to the restaurant, and to the lack of late night food options in uptown Hoboken, I've somehow managed to order from this "hole in the wall" place on three occasions, hoping that the previous experience(s) were just a fluke.  However, the third time was definitely not a charm, and neither was the first or the second.On my first experience, I order a large meatball and roasted garlic pizza.  Absolutely the worst pizza I've ever had. I ate one piece and threw the rest away.  To elaborate, the garlic was actually raw, the tomato "sauce" had more water than tomato, the "meatballs" had no seasoning and might as well have been sausage crumbles, and the dough was brutally chewy.  However, I did like the cheese, elastic and gooey it was!On second go at it, I ordered a lace pizza again, this time, half pepperoni, half sausage.  Upon arriving on time to pick up my pizza, I saw them frantically rushing to remake my pizza, as it was clear that my pizza had just been given to a friend/relative of the family's who was in the corner devouring away at it.  (Perhaps there was a slight miscommunication here between the employees on this one, mistakes happen, I get it.)  However, upon waiting 20 minutes for my new pie, I open the box to see that they had made me a pepperoni pizza, which was not what I had ordered.  I had specifically asked for half sausage.  The lady offered to give me a small sausage pizza for free, which was already cooked, as this was actually the intended pizza for the man in the corner who had been devouring my original pizza.  I agreed, and proceeded to pay, only to realize that she was actually trying to charge me for both pizzas, after she had already told me that I would get the second one for free due to their mistake, in addition to me having to wait 20 minutes.  I spoke up about it, and she hesitantly took the second pie off my bill, acting as if I was suddenly the culprit for receiving a free pizza. For the record, the pizza was better that the first time, but still unnecessarily chewy. After much hesitation, I went back a third time, simply due to it's convenient location, and to the fact that Lisa's Deli had already closed for the night.  After browsing Torna's website, I called and ordered the Baked Ziti and I added on some Cheese Fries because the online picture looked amazingly delicious, only to find out upon returning home and opening containers, that neither dish resembled the online photos at all!  The cheese fries had melted pizza cheese, as opposed to nacho cheese that was in the picture, and the "Baked Ziti" was simply noodles, watered-down tomato sauce, and melted pizza cheese.  There was no trace of a meat sauce that the online photo had portrayed.  (Who makes Baked Ziti without meat sauce?)  At the slightest bit they could have at least attempted to season the pasta...a little salt and pepper never hurt anyone.  Needless to say, I threw the pasta away after forcing down a few bites of noodles and tomatoey water.From my perspective, Torna's is still in business, simply because it is one of the only late night options in uptown Hoboken, and what the heck does a drunk kid care about the quality of his pizza.  I also sense a strong loyalty from the Hoboken townies (those that were born and raised here) due to Torna's popularity back in their heyday, when they actually may have cared about producing a quality product.   I'd hate to see a "historic" Hoboken restaurant go out of business, but it happened to Helmer's, and it can happen to you too if you don't make improvements.  Your regulars...the one's that have been supporting you for years and years, the ones who remember how good you "used to be", they aren't going to be around forever.  I wish you the best, but I will not be returning.
2015-01-04,5,The food here is incredible.  The pizza, especially Sicilian with pepperoni, and the chicken parm sandwich is so delicious.  Love love love it.
2015-01-03,1,I don't usually leave reviews but the Sicilian pie I ordered was the worst I ever had. I love Sicilian pizza but my roommates and I were extremely disappointed.  Hardly any sauce and very bready/doughy. The slices were extremely bland. We wanted to try this place cause we heard good things but will never order from here again.
2014-12-26,4,Love this place.Meatball Parm is great I always have them toast the bread and a half is more than enough for me.Pizzawise I order a corner sicilian with extra sauce on the side for dipping, but I can eat it plain.  If I am ordering a pie I always order it well done.Their honey mustard is phenominal, I usually grab some if I am ordering fries.I have never had a problem with the staff, always very pleasant.
2014-11-20,3,This place is open late, so I frequent it probably once a weekend.  The pizza is by no means great.  This is judging it by a plain slice.  I've heard the Sicilian is much better.  Overall, I'm not a huge fan of their pizza taste.  It's a little too much garlic for my taste.  Still though, the hours are great. Service is typically quick.  The interior isn't great. However, I'm purely reviewing the place based on service and taste of food. Anything else is superficial when you're reviewing a place for food pickup/delivery.
2014-11-08,1,One year since my last review and this place continues to operate in the same disrespectful manner. I can only surmise that these guys own the building and "do pizza" on the side. Your 85' Oldsmobiles and 92' Camrys parked in the middle of the street are an eye sore and a safety hazard.  Direct messaging me on yelp and threatening physical violence is also a questionable business practice. "Why not approach those "fellas" and read your review out loud in person to one of their faces? Oh I know why, because your a pretentious yuppy pu**y."I'm going to pass on that generous offer "Joey P".  This pretentious yuppy pu**y will be eating pizza and reading reviews out loud elsewhere...in a sane environment with sane people that don't drag their knuckles when they walk.
2014-10-26,4,My friends from NY are obsessed with Tornas and we always need to stop and get a pie on our way back to my apartment after a night out when they're in. The Sicilian is personally my favorite. Service is pretty good, I always stop in to pick it up.
2014-07-12,4,This is one of those hole in the wall places that you know must have good food or it wouldn't have lasted this long. Clearly, they don't get by on their looks. That being said, the chicken parm sub is the best in town. A half sub is plenty. The pizza is not that great, but edible if you must have it.
2014-07-11,2,Torna's has been in Hoboken for decades and its so disappointing to see just how far they have fallen. Consistency is rare here.  Whether it be the tough dough, uncooked bottom, wrong orders, or nasty lady picking up the phone asking "who is this?"
2014-06-26,4,As tasty as it gets when it comes to Chicken Parmesan Sandwiches. Think the most tender breaded chicken smothered in sauce, cheese then cased in a loaf of hand baked/delicious bread. Good solid pizzas and excellent pricing. I appreciated the kind, old school feel of the place.
2014-03-15,4,This place is pretty shanty. Definitely a little hole in the wall, not very easy on the eyes. But who really cares about all that....the pizza was good. The menu is very simple too, right to the point. I will definitely order from here again.
2014-01-11,5,I lived in Hoboken for two years a few years ago and would go to Torna from time to time. I stopped by last night and was glad I did. Not a thing has changed. It's easily an overlooked spot because from the outside it's not aesthetically pleasing. Inside you feel like you're in someone's house and stool you can feel uncomfortable if you aren't in the know. The menu is simple...pizza. Stop in for a slice of Sicilian (the dough is baked with sauce on it and the cheese is added when you order a slice). The dice comes out nice and crispy on the outside, but chewy and tender on the inside. They always cut the slice in two to appear like you get two slices.
2013-11-02,2,Yes, Torna is the cheapest pizza place in Hoboken, so if you're on a budget you will get what you pay for. BUT - if you can pay a little extra to go somewhere else, I recommend you do so.  I agree with the previous reviews that said they doubt the cleanliness. I don't know for a fact if it is or isn't clean, but it does not look like a clean establishment.  When I first moved to Hoboken and didn't know any better I used to eat here because the locals recommended it.  I think Torna caters to familiar faces because everyone I know that has tried them for the first time has not had the same experience as a person that has been going there for years. The staff isn't rude, but they're nicer to people they recognize and know they get repeat business from. Also, they burned my pizza and gave it to the kids outside playing baseball.  Would have been a nice gesture if I didn't have to sit there and wait for them to start all over again.  I would have left if I hadn't already invested so much time in waiting. Its good that they have an established customer base but they're not going to make any new fans by treating new customers like unwelcome intruders.
2013-10-14,1,I never felt so bad. The guy literally insulted me when I was telling him my address. I was checking with him because when I called before, he told me to call him again in 15 min to see if they were going to deliver the pizza or not. I don't know who he thinks he is to treat my that way. Really disrespectful. They don't even deserve to be called
2013-05-21,4,I went to Torna's on  a recommendation from a neighbor on a Monday night when it seemed so many places were closed. I had in mind a meatball parm and Torna's did not disappoint. The bread was very fresh warm and ever so slightly crispy. The meatball really tasty authentic southern Italian. Can not beat it very affordable too!
2012-12-15,2,Decent pizza but the service is "blah". And the interior made me question their cleanliness. In the kitchen, the staff was preparing the food with no gloves and laughing/giggling over the food. I was hungry so I though "F*** It!" I got a slice. Again the pizza was good and thankfully I didn't get sick. May give them another shot but this time I won't be as hungry/desperate :-)
2012-08-01,4,Pizza looks average but tastes better. Atmosphere typical basic pizza joint w chairs n tables but clean enough.
2012-06-20,4,You must specifically order a thin crust pizza. I've found that the regular pies (yes, they're called pies, and not pizzas, when in nj) just don't taste the same. The thin crust pies are the perfect balance of a crunchy crust and salty cheese.
2012-03-22,5,I've been eating here for over 25 years. This is Hoboken's oldest and best Pizza place. Known for their Sicilian slices and personal pies. Their other items are great also. If you're not going the pizza route, I'd suggest their baked Ziti or meatball parm. Place is an A+
2012-03-04,3,I love this place for a late night slice. They are open late and their sicicilian pizza is phenomenal. Lived around the corner from this place for almost two years, never had a bad slice.  However, I did order a pizza once and it came burned and the cheese was all over the box. But I still recommend this place
2012-01-25,1,Worst. Pizza. Ever. Plain and simple. With so many good choices in the area, why go here? Don't get me wrong, the staff was SUPER nice and service was great. Unfortunately, the pizza just doesn't cut it.
2012-01-15,2,I'm not sure if I ate at another Torna's pizza but I can't even think about giving this place more than 2 stars and that is being nice.  I be honest the pizza was decent but after seeing the inside of the pizzeria I'm not sure if I can ever get pizza from here again. I am someone who will eat from pretty much anywhere.  I love getting street meat in the city and I take the cities DOH ratings with a grain of salt because some of the requirements are a bit ridiculous.On the night when I went here to grab two slices I walked in and the smell in the air was not pleasant.  There was guy outside smoking who followed us inside then took our order.  He bent over to grab pizza from under the counter, pulled two slices out then threw them in the oven to reheat.  It would have been nice to see him wash his hands. I should have just walked out at that point but I for some reason I didn't so I paid for my slices and took them home.  As I said before the pizza was decent but I couldn't get the thought of how dirty this place was out of my head.
2011-12-05,4,I was a little skeptical at first, but when I saw the cops frequenting this place I knew I had to give it a shot.  Solid cheese pizza slices and conveniently open when you are getting out of the bar = winning combination.
2011-11-30,2,This place is cheap, which is nice. Their regular pizza isn't good and its really easy in North Jersey to find a better slice. In my experience, the crust has been a bit raw in the middle.  If you go here definitely go for the sicillian pie.  That pie is worth eating even when its not 4am and your trashed. Chicken parms are pretty good from here too. Also, apparently they won't sell you their batteries for 10 bucks, but they will be nice to you even though you're trashed and demanding that they sell you things that aren't for sale.
2011-11-13,4,Pretty decent food and friendly staff that puts up with the shenanigans you get for having hot pizza and a bathroom at 4 am
2011-11-11,1,Maybe I just had a bad experience here, but this place gave me the worst pizza I have ever had in Jersey.  The bottom of the crust was burnt and the inside was still raw.  The sauce was so watery it ran off the pizza taking the cheese and toppings off as well. With so many other pizza places around I doubt I will give them a second chance.
2011-07-23,4,Very good cheese slice, great prices, and their *small* antipasti salad was huge and delicious.  I could barely eat half with one slice of cheese.  Torna's is a no-nonsense pizzeria with good and great prices.
2011-06-10,3,I cane here late night after a few drinks. The Sicilian had a very thick slice of bread.
2011-03-07,4,Went here during the st patricks day parade. Was very hungry, pizza was hot and delicious and came out quick. Wide slices. Delicious. At the time the bar may have been set kind of low, but at that moment, it was the best thing I had eaten ever.
2010-10-01,3,Easily the cheapest pizza in Hoboken, Torna is worth a try.  Unfortunately when I visited at about 9:30pm they were out of regular slices, but I did try their Sicilian.  It was good not great, but what stood out was the price: 2 slices and 2 sodas for $5.50The place is not sit-down friendly but perfect for picking up pizza or delivery.  As mentioned before, the prices are extremely affordable and they are open until 4am on Fridays and Saturdays!I'm hoping to make it back when their regular pizza is in stock.UPDATE: I changed it to 3 stars.  After giving a 5 star elsewhere I realized I didn't leave much room in between.  Gimme a free pass on my first review (please?)
2010-03-12,5,I've lived in Hoboken for almost 4 years now.  I have tried almost every single pizza joint in town, both dine-in and delivery.  The one pizza place I noworder with exclusively is Torna.The store itself does not look like much and doesn't offer much of a dine-in experience.  Do not let this put you off from trying their food.  This is such a fantastic pizza that I feel gets overlooked by everyone in Hoboken because it lacks the flash of other places.I will say that everyone that works there is extremely friendly and professional.  Do not hesitate to order a pie from them. And while you're at it get a garlic bread with cheese.  They use fresh mozerella that they melt between the bread.  Simply great.  And the large pie is only $10.25!!!
