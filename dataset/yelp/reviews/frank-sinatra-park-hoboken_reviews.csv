2021-07-18,5,Really dope views. The ducks dominated half the broad walk but you can still enjoy the park. They close at 9:15 but if you get there around 7 you can enjoy the sunset while looking at the city.
2020-08-19,5,When in Hoboken, the birthplace of the OG crooner himself, how can you NOT stop by Frank Sinatra Park? The answer is, you just can't. This park is wedged right between Pier C Park, a soccer field, and Stevens Park. It's just a wonderful grassy area with beautiful NYC skyline views and has part of the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway going through it. There's also an outdoor amphitheater where they host events/concerts and a soccer field right by it as well. I believe they also have restroom facilities and more there as well since they host so many other events. There's a really cool long walkway that lets you go far out into the water to get some fantastic unobstructed views all around as well. There's also a restaurant right by there as well called Blue Eyes in case you want to take in the scenery over a bite to eat. This park is super clean and the views are hard to beat. Definitely a must-visit for any tourist or local who wants to just kick back and relax.
2020-08-10,5,I love this park. It is very lively. There's many food options nearby and sometimes the ice cream truck is parked in front. I love the views of Manhattan across the Hudson. They have bike rentals nearby.
2020-04-18,5,Awesome soccer field right on the water. It is not a full sized soccer field but they split the field horizontally into 2 to play pickup games.  The turf is relatively new so it is in good shape. The view is spectacular so it makes for a great time. They do have kids sports team taking up the field and different sports leagues so it could be hard to get on sometimes. That is the annoying part because I am not sure where to look up the schedule.Anyway, if you can get on it is a good time. Be careful not to kick the ball over the netting because it will definitely be in the water! Have fun!
2020-02-17,5,Seriously who couldn't love Hoboken. Close to all New York, Jersey City.  Walk around Washington Avenue. All the little shops. People out and about with their pets. Nicest people are in Hoboken.  Beautiful Frank Sinatra Park water views. The Wicked Wolf Tavern is there. At night so beautiful.  .  When weather warms  people are out and about. Best place. Good for young and old.
2018-11-28,5,I was here the first week I came to NJ and fell in love with it. I could still see the fall colors, and with that came lot of couples doing photo shoots. It's a wonderful park close to all the cute bars and cafes in Hoboken, with wonderful NYC views. Great spot for cycling, walking, getting good profile pictures and just people-watching.
2018-08-28,5,Absolutely love this park! It is right by the water with a gorgeous view of the NYC skyline. A supermarket is walking distance away (Kings) with a ton of great Cafe's, restaurants, and bars! I've been coming here for a year to watch my boyfriend play soccer and I enjoy it every time!
2018-08-27,5,I ended up here because I was house-sitting in Morris County and had never been to Manhattan because...well frankly I don't want to explore it by myself. So until I have the opportunity to share it with someone, I needed the next best things. I simply browsed parks with good views of Manhattan and this is where I ended up. And it was very much worth it!I parked on the main road outside the park. It was a Sunday morning so there were plenty of spots and it was free. Massive soccer field is between the street and waterfront but it was easy to walk around. Then there is the view...the view is magnificent! You can see downtown, midtown, uptown, and anything else I may be missing. There's a pier going out for pedestrians and from the end you can see both the George Washington and Verrazano Narrows bridges. Easy to get to with wide sidewalks. Enough room for everyone.Truly a sight to see! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good view.
2018-05-01,5,Another great park in Hoboken. It has some of the best views of Manhattan. There's also athletic fields and green space. It's not as much green space as the other parks. There are plenty of paths to run and walk. If you're in Hoboken you have to visit the park honoring its most famous resident. It has great views of the Manhattan skyline. The park seems to be more of a collection of athletic fields and paths than the other parks though. It still has a path along the river so you can see across. There are many restaurants across the street. Avoid the Sinatra themed restaurant. This is a ripoff and tourist trap. It may not be as much of a park as the other two along the Hudson. It still has great views of Manhattan. The park has lots of places to run or walk.
2017-08-12,5,Love the views of New York City from this park. I brought some bird seeds and feed the birds and local pigeons that were in the area. Close by down town Hoboken.
2017-05-05,5,This park definitely rocks. If I lived here, I'd be here every day and my manager would have to send search parties and lassoes to haul me to work. Clean, and safe, with interesting paths that lead further out over the Hudson, this lovely park is a great place to exercise or commune with nature, without roughing it. It never feels crowded, except during the Italian festival, which everyone should attend one for the zeppole alone. I can't guarantee that the view of Manhattan will make your date rapturous, but come here with a picnic basket during the evenings and who knows what the evening will bring? It's a great place to come alone or with friends too, whether you intend to walk, run or just sit and listen to the lapping waves. There are benches with shade, or benches for who want to bask in the sun's rays. It feels like you are outside of the hustle and bustle, but close enough to the eateries on Washington Street if you ever get hungry. There are bathrooms too, here, and clean the times I've been to them. A wonderful park to enjoy life in.
2017-03-11,5,Lesser known Tourist Must Stop! Aside from Liberty State Park (that has no restaurants in the area) Hoboken is the perfect place to get that NYC skyline view. Plus while you are in the area stop by a local deli, pick up a Crepe, or go crazy on the kids jungle gym! Not Kidding Around: the Kid's park here is awesome! As a group of 20 some year olds we ruled the playground. (It was in March when no kids where actually around playing). That slide was made for some adult size slide contests! Plus who doesn't love a good spinney wheel?For some adult fun, Hoboken if filled with bars & clubs. The park is right by the Hoboken train station, or an easy Uber drop off location. So stop by the next time you are in New Jersey!
2017-01-14,5,What's really nice about this park is that it's right by the water. You have amazing views of NYC. There are lots of benches around, so you can sit down and take in the views. The park is great for taking a walk and/or jogging. Plus, it's safe day and night.
2016-09-13,5,This is a great park to take a stroll in with or without kids over looking the New Jersey sky line.
2016-08-30,4,it's a nice clean park, wish parking was a bit closer.  vending machine would be nice, I didn't see any.  the view of the NY skyline was beautiful.  even on a sunny and hot day, breezy wind and shaddy area with benches were really nice for a lunch in the park.  kids loved the soccer field, and walking around the docks.
2016-06-24,5,What a beautiful park!! I've been a huge fan of Hoboken since the days that I found out about it. Came here on a Wednesday evening for dinner, and loved walking along the Hudson in this park. The views of NYC are absolutely amazing. It is so beautiful to watch the sunset here and then the city lights once it gets dark. This place has a lot of pedestrian traffic, and it is a pleasure to people watch. There were many runners, cyclists and walkers out and about when I was there. Love the energy in this park and it is was such a pleasure to be there. Absolutely love it! This is a must visit!!
2016-06-02,4,I preform here for summer concerts every year (well, 2 years). It's a really nice place, the water is nice. There is also a rest thank nearby, it says... Blue Eyes. Anyways, it's a good place to have a walk and just relax if you need to.
2016-03-11,4,The only thing that's missing from this lovely park and its breathtaking views is ol' Frankie himself. There should be one day a week where they just play his greatest hits for a few hours. Imagine hearing, "New York, New York" while literally staring at...New York. Talk about meta....
2015-08-02,5,Sit and read a book. Run. Walk. Do yoga. Watch the sunset. Watch the sunrise. Whisper sweet nothings. Ruminate. Get some quality me time. Or take in free performances through out summer in the amphitheater. The Frank Sinatra Park is perfect for every occasion and every moment! I honestly feel that it's the jewel in Hoboken's crown. It's pristine and beautiful and offers unparalleled views of NYC, day or night. So come and enjoy, and bring your friends.
2015-07-02,4,Amazing space. Hoboken has done an excellent job on it. Years ago,  this was a nice place to buy drugs and get stabbed. Not so much today....Open spaces that are used by all. Runners, sunbathers, fishermen, dogs and kids, and everything in between. The island is cool and hard to beat the view. Worth taking the walk. You won't regret it. Have fun
2015-06-06,5,Beautiful views of NY! Such a great destination to take people that are here visiting from out of town! There is a kids park close by and many piers! I love taking my family on long walks along the water and then grabbing a bench in this park or stopping into Blue Eyes restaurant to eat some yummy pizza or gelato. The kids can get really close to the water because there is no fence, so be careful.
2015-03-03,5,Great free summer concerts and a breathtaking view of Manhattan especially as the sun sets.
2015-01-30,5,I think rather than writing a review I should just post the lyrics to billy Joel's 'New York state of mind'... so here you are. --------Some folks like to get awayTake a holiday from the neighborhoodHop a flight to Miami BeachOr to HollywoodBut I'm taking a GreyhoundOn the Hudson River LineI'm in a New York state of mindI've seen all the movie starsIn their fancy cars and their limousinesBeen high in the Rockies under the evergreensBut I know what I'm needingAnd I don't want to waste more timeI'm in a New York state of mindIt was so easy living day by dayOut of touch with the rhythm and bluesBut now I need a little give and takeThe New York Times, The Daily NewsIt comes down to realityAnd it's fine with me 'cause I've let it slideDon't care if it's Chinatown or on RiversideI don't have any reasonsI've left them all behindI'm in a New York state of mindIt was so easy living day by dayOut of touch with the rhythm and bluesBut now I need a little give and takeThe New York Times, The Daily NewsIt comes down to realityAnd it's fine with me 'cause I've let it slideDon't care if it's Chinatown or on RiversideI don't have any reasonsI've left them all behindI'm in a New York state of mindI'm just taking a Greyhound on the Hudson River Line'Cause I'm in a New York state of mind
2015-01-04,5,What a beautiful Park! The views of NYC are amazing. So many people have their cameras out taking selfies and views of the city. We even saw a couple getting engagement photos done at the park. They have nice open areas, playgrounds, little piers to walk out on, and boardwalks. Give yourself about an hour to check out the whole park and see what it has to offer.
2014-12-28,5,We'd been intending to go here for quite awhile, but previously the weather and/or the sun were never conducive to great photos.  Yesterday in the late afternoon was perfect, and the views - and the overall wonderful ambiance - make this one of the nicest parks anywhere.  The physical setting is quite lovely & peaceful, and the views are superb.
2014-09-13,5,Same place as the one I reviewed. Along the Hudson River line, you can enjoy the peace of you mind but also the "city never sleep" Manhattan midtown. You can enjoy the skyline at one time, but need not to get in the crowed streets of Manhattan.
2014-07-18,5,Amazing park. 1) It is 24/7. Always open. 2) Great views of NYC and Hudson River. 3) Pier 13/ Pier A/ Pier C are amazing to walk and get food. 4) Great place to walk.
2013-11-04,5,Really great place to do what anyone does in a park -- run, walk, contemplate their navel.  Sit, fish even.  Amazing views of Manhattan!
2013-10-14,4,Good views of nyc skyline from here but I love the view from the other side in long island much better.
2013-09-19,5,I love walking up this park on a fine day!  Great views of the city and there are lots of places to stop and rest a long the way.  My dogs love to walk this park, although there is not a dedicated dog run, and sometimes I can even convince a my friends who live in Manhattan to come out and walk this park with me.  There is a skate park and a little cafe... also if you are ever in dire need of parking you can usually find a spot where the hill starts.
2013-09-18,5,Hoboken has a lot of things going for it but lets be clear that the amazing views of Manhattan's West Side ranks very high on that list.  Frank Sinatra Park is a great place to see those views but this park has more going for it than just the views.  A lot of businesses are close by and whenever there's a festival that uses the park people really get to enjoy it.  They've also added some extensions recently and made it more kid friendly for those looking to enjoy it with the family.  Being accessible by car or public transportation is also a big plus.
2013-08-26,5,Great spot in Hoboken. Good for children, couples, groups of friend, etc.  There are play areas for the little ones and amazing views and walking paths for the rest.
2013-08-19,5,Cool views of Manhattan can be seen from Frank Sinatra Park! I wanted to pass some time before heading to EWR to catch my flight back to SEA. It was nice showing my Parents this place! I got some really good pictures of them. Seeing the smiles on their faces as they see NYC :) We strolled around for about an Hour sightseeing.I was excited as I heard the sounds of an Ice Cream Truck and ordered a really good Oreo Milkshake to cool off with the Summer sun! There were a good amount of Restaurants nearby that were filled with People enjoying good times!I will definitely be back to see how it looks in the Evening! There was something about singing a few of Frank Sinatra's songs while at this park felt like a bit of AWESOMENESS! You have a nice place Hoboken!
2013-08-14,5,This park area is beautiful, especially with this amazing weather we've been having. I take my pup Hamlet for walks along here almost every day. The grass is maintained very nicely.The view of NYC is great, the area is kept extremely clean, there are tons of places to sit and relax, read a book, sunbathe, have a picnic, etc...I also see a yoga class that meets here during the week. I will have to find out about that!Also, there are water fountains that have a little dog fountain attached so Hamlet never wants for a drink! And there are plenty of garbage cans, so I never see trash lying about. It would be great if they added a turf dog park here!
2013-04-03,5,Gorgeous views, doesn't get much better. Clean, easy to get to (right outside of Hoboken Terminal, Rail Bus, PATH).  There is an awesome park for kids too, Love coming here.
2012-07-21,4,Beautiful park with a great view of the city and water!I came here when there was some type of singing/acting performance going on.  Everyone was just kickin' back and relaxing, enjoying the show and weather.  Ahhh.
2012-07-07,5,What a beautiful park and view of Manhattan!  Highly recommend this park for families. This waterfront jewel is an amazing place to be!
2012-05-18,4,This where I come on Sundays when I want my alone time.I walk the walkway...but mostly...I love sitting on the grass and watching my old hometown from this side of the river.
2011-09-26,5,Really scenic park with a LOT of options for play & relaxing.  There is something for everyone: kids, adults & senior citizens.  I loved playing (like a 2-year-old) in their huge jungle gym complete with a (wet) sandbox.  There's a nice walkway area with a beautiful backdrop of the NYC skyline (hint hint to guys who are looking for a post-dinner stroll to take a gal after a date).
2011-06-24,5,"Start spreading the news.. I'm leaving today.. I want to wake up, in a city that doesn't sleep.." Okay. I might not be waking up in NYC but if I find my self waking up @ this park, I would be waking up to one of the best view of the NYC skyline. I ADORE Frank Sinatra (he's my favorite Jazz singer of ALL time) & I Love this small park @ his hometown in the city of Hoboken, NJ that is dedicated to him. So far, this is one of my fave place to visit while visiting  NJ/NY. It's not the biggest park but it's in a great location. When visiting the city, we usually park along Frank Sinatra Park/Hoboken area and catch the Path Train (which is only a few steps away) to the city. It saves us time trying to get out of the city and avoid the annoying traffic jam. During the weekends, parking is free by the park. I love strolling around this park. It's a great place for jogging, relaxing, walking your dog, catching up with a friend, picnics, people watching, taking a short power nap, proposal. My main reason for checking out this park? Definitely THE VIEW. And did I mention I'm a HUGE Frank Sinatra Fan?? His name alone was enough for me to check this park out.
2010-09-26,3,Where the hell is the so called park? I don't know if it's during a time of renovation but I was there maybe 10 minutes and bounced. Not really much to see.
2010-02-18,3,I agree with what everybody before me said.  However, now that the park is practically collapsing into the river, I had to do something to reduce its rating form 5 star status.
2009-05-30,5,When the idea of moving to Hoboken first crossed my mind, I was hesitant. I really wanted to live in the city, I wanted the hustle-and-bustle, I wanted a shitty apartment to make me broke. It's the American Dream, right?! :) When I realized my salary couldn't even bear a shitty NYC apartment, I began to consider Hoboken.  So, I came one day to check it out...Frank Sinatra Park is what made me want to live here. It's really a no-frills park - there's no fancy jumping fountains, there's no glitz and glamour, etc. It doesn't need any of that. It is what it is - an amazing open area to relax, exercise and appreciate our amazing neighbor city. There's the best view in the world, there is a great walking/biking/jogging path, there's fields for athletics and, above all, there's more space than you'd ever need to relax and enjoy the view. 5 stars.
2009-01-21,5,it's an ordinary Saturday morning..  we're under silky cotton sheet..  he's still sleeping..  can hear his light snoring..  cute..  it was a great last night..  he played his guitar, and sang for me at the deck..  his voice wasn't great, but soft  and enough to please me..  bright smile spread on my face..  I should get some coffee for two of us..blue shirt..  love his smell..  ok..  where's a coffee machine?  there it is..  little tiny machine..  should be fine.. just need coffee for the day..  he's calling me now..  "I'm at kitchen..  making coffee..  do you want some?"  he's behind me now.. he gives me a small kiss on my back neck..  "morning, babe..  had a good sleep?"  "uh huh, you?"  "couldn't sleep well.. I was looking at you all the night.."  good liar..  he's making pancake..  put some dried raspberry and nuts..  and more fruits.. yummy.. "want to walk?  there's a nice park near here."  "ok.. why not?"hand by hand.. we walked through 5th street all the way down till the end..  could see the silver light through the trees..  and WOW..  it's a view..  it's dreamy..  blue sky..  cool water..  light breezing..  and sparkling sunshine..  "it's Frank Sinatra Park.."  "why?  isn't it a singer's name?"  "yes, it named after him.  he's a son of hoboken.. he's born here."  "fabulous!"  "do you like here, babe?"  "yes, I have another excuse to visit hoboken!  could you sing 'fly me to the moon' for me, hon. pleeeeease?"kr.youtube.com/watch?v=1...
2008-10-12,5,The hidden secret, or maybe it's not so hidden, of Hoboken is driving or walking along Frank Sinatra Drive in Hoboken and going to Frank Sinatra Park. It's sort of an oasis away from the hubbub of Washington Street. People drive slowly along Sinatra Drive, and I can't say that I blame them.Why is it called Frank Sinatra Park? Well, Frank Sinatra was born in Hoboken, and he is still Hoboken's favorite son. I believe that Nancy Sinatra was even here to dedicate the park in her father's honor.You've got a beautiful view of Manhattan staring at you while you're driving. So yes, it is very easy to get distracted.Oh, and it's also very easy to get distracted by the female joggers and Stevens students that run in this park.
2008-10-11,5,I LOVE this park, especially daytime to sunset and the name, Frank Sinatra Park!Nice view of Manhattan,Clean walk-way great for jogging.Great Soccer field, refreshy running track, awesome waterfront walkway, amphitheater and gazebo!The park is the one of the reason that turned me to be a HOBOKEN FAN.
