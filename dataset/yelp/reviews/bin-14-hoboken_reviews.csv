2021-11-06,4,This place was amazing. We went here while on a bachelorette trip and did a pre ordered 5 course meal! The location is great, the restaurant is tiny inside but has a nice back patio that is heated and a front patio. We started with meatballs, burrata and eggplant parm. The meatballs were SO GOOD. Flavorful and tasty. The eggplant parm bites were pretty good! Crispy, unlike a lot of eggplant parm. The burrata was just okay. We then moved salads - we have the Cesar salad and the kale salad. The kale salad had a citrus vinaigrette on it that was so refreshing. Next - we moved to pizzas! We didn't love either pizza. We had the prosciutto pizza and the margarita. Both were average, not very flavorful and small. The best part of our meal was the pastas!! We had an array of entrees - pastas, steaks, burgers and all of them were amazing. The steak was cooked perfectly, seasoned properly and came with side salad/ fries. The bolognese was incredible, the truffle pasta was to die for and the sausage cavatelli was out of this world. You can tell that the pasta is hand made and all of the sauces too! The truffle bucanti was probably the favorite. The service was a little slow and they didn't mention that gratuity was already added.  Overall, would definitely go back!
2021-11-06,1,We wore there today November 6 2021 first the food was over priced and it's nothing to talk about my wife order the salmon and it had no flavor the mashpotatoes wore the consistency of rice pudding and then with out asking my wife's food was taken away with half her salmon still on the plate and told we have a party coming at 8 would we like the check thats fucking disgraceful and our bill was 300 dollars wtf  never going there
2021-10-15,4,Great food and ambiance! I got a couple of brunch drinks and the cacio e Pepe pizza - highly recommend !!! It has a good brunch and dinner menu and vibe for friends or date night. Although I would make a reservation and be there on time! We got there a little late, and they ended up having to kick us out bc they had a big reservation coming :/ understandable but it was a bummer.
2021-10-12,3,Brunched here on Sunday with some girlfriends. The live jazz music was a nice addition to our meal.Bin14's outdoor setup is great - it's a large covered deck area shared with The Madison. It started to rain while we were there and, aside from a few gusts of wind, we stayed completely dry!They offer a brunch deal (zeppolis, small plate and an entreÃÅe) for $29 but it felt like too much food so I opted for Al La Carte brunch. The brunch menu itself felt somewhat limited and I, lover of breakfast, ended up getting the sausage and peppers pizza. The serving size was just enough, but was just OK.I think I recommend Bin14 for dinner over brunch.
2021-10-03,3,Ordered the sweet sausage and pepper pizza (without ricotta). It was absolutely delicious, but the pizza itself is very much a pie for a 2nd grader. Very very tiny. I also ordered the zeppoles and they were stale, and I'm guessing baked? They also had the strangest metallic after taste. Not the typical fried and airy light ones you'd find at a local pizza shop. Overall, tasty pizza but very overpriced for the portion size. Zeppoles are terrible, skip them.
2021-09-14,2,Just finished dinner here and certainly won't return. Food was meh. We had the kale salad, 2 bruschetta, the Tuesday mussels and a chicken milanese. The kale salad and bruschetta were fine. We sent one of the bruschetta back but it was more that the toppings we chose were turned into a paste which was unexpected but maybe some people like that. The mussels were cold but the spicy sauce was pretty good. The white wine sauce tasted like water. The chicken milanese was pretty tasty though slightly unconventional bc it wasn't a cutlet, it was like pieces of fried chicken. I would say the shining star of the night was the wine- the Malbec was delicious. And here's where it gets into the no-way-I'd-ever-return territory. Our waitress was TERRIBLE! She was standoff-ish and unfriendly from the beginning but also went MIA after our mains were served. Not MIA exactly as we could see her inside on her phone the entire time. We asked a different waitress for a second glass of wine, finished it, and still no waitress. At this point we have no wine, no bread, an overflowing bowl of empty mussel shells and still no waitress. My boyfriend decides to go into the restaurant to retrieve her and she is...wait for it...on her phone, taking pictures of Barbie dolls. Long  story short, impressively bad service.
2021-09-13,4,I wish I wrote the review while I was sitting there because now I don't remember the names of our dishes ... I do remember the mimosas though The service was great.  The people were nice and helpful and kind and the food tasted awesome Had a great time Would definitely go back when I'm in the area
2021-08-11,4,Brunch is good. 2 eggs & meatball, polenta - The poached eggs are perfect. Egg in a hole is also good.
2021-07-16,2,This place used to be great but there are issues. 1. The menu rarely changes. They just rearrange the same main things and call them new dishes. Todays pork belly is tomorrow's bacon pizza. The whole menu is like 4 ingredients. I'm exaggerating and a lot of food is good but there used to be more variety. 2. The decor is dated. There's been the same damaged art in the front of the restaurant that's ugly and sun faded and wrinkled for literally years. Not a cute high end environment. 3. Climate control. There is none. Don't go in the summer because there's no functional air conditioning. It's been broken or just terrible for years. In the winter it's the reverse. Bring a down jacket to eat in. Also the bathrooms are moldy and never clean. The owner does not invest in this business. I really love this place and want to see it continue to succeed but some things need to be addressed. The only highlights are the staff. David, Soureya, Kristine, Juan, Stephanie, Angela are amazing.
2021-07-08,5,I've never eaten at the restaurant but we ordered delivery for the first time and everything was SO GOOD! The portion sizes were very generous, and everything was well seasoned. I would definitely recommend the food here, I'm excited to try it in person one day!
2021-07-02,3,I have celiac and frequent Bin14 as they are one of the safest gluten-free spots in town.  They have so many gluten-free options and a GF fryer, which is a rarity (the fries are amazing).  I only gave 3 stars because they had such good wings with a dry rub, but recently changed to what tastes like store-bought bbq sauce.  They also had a great GF kale salad, but substituted it for a salad with farro (gluten).  Please bring back the old wings and GF butternut squash salad for your GF crowd!
2021-06-27,5,Absolutely love this place!!! Perfect spot for brunch. They usually have live music too :)
2021-06-14,2,I wouldn't recommend...Staff and service was good but food was not good.My bucatini tasted like the pasta had been cooked for 20 mins and the burrata tasted like it was purchased from Shop Rite last month. It was hard  and not fresh. The pizza margarita looked like it was made in a college dorm, and tasted like it as well. I ate dinner with 3 other people and not one of us enjoyed our dinner...It was very disappointing as the decor and ambiance is super cute.I'm not sure if this is a post Covid thing based on the other reviews, but my experience was the food was awful.
2021-06-14,3,I think overall I would give it a 3.5/5. Environment and service are great, wine list is solid, but the food was underwhelming and under seasoned. Ordered the meatballs and octopus small plates as my meal. The octopus to garnish ratio was a total bummer. I love grilled octopus - I order it every time I see it on a menu. The cook on the octopus was a little off. Overall good for a drink and an app, but don't know if I'll be back.
2021-06-13,4,We ordered Bin 14 for the first time last night via Uber eats.  Everything was packaged great!The truffle burrata: the crostini's were great and had some garlic butter on them.  They went perfect with the burrata.  There wasn't much of a truffle flavor though. Clam pizza: this was good but someone had a heavy hand when adding the garlic.  If it were less garlicky, we would have loved it.  Note- I LOVE garlic and can eat it on its own, but I feel that it shouldn't overwhelm other flavors.   The spring rabbit cavatelli: the rabbit was cooked perfectly and fell apart as I ate it.  The sauce was also something I wanted to dip my bread in.  Now the pasta... out of this world.  We will order again.
2021-06-07,5,Hands down my favorite local bar to frequent. Everyone at Bin 14 is friendly and treats you like family when you are there. Service is A++ and food and drinks follow suit. We typically come in for dinner and drinks and have never been disappointed with the menu or wine selection. The bartenders (David and Kristen) always seem to know what I am in the mood for and provide an excellent background on whatever wine they have selected. Their vast knowledge in wine is what makes dining here incredible. The wine menu is always rotating and never disappoints. Stephanie the manager is the best in the biz. She is the sweetest most accommodating person and always makes sure we are happy when we come in. She assisted in planning a birthday party that we held in the back patio area that was truly an amazing experience. Also big thanks to Sirai - the wonderful server who goes out to her way to make sure everything is perfect each and every time we come in. Food is excellent - the homemade bruschetta's are out of this world. Pizza's compete with the best in Hoboken. Any of the entrees are always cooked to perfection and tasty. The addition of zeppolis to the menu have been a real pleasure, being able to stay even longer for dessert and a night cap!
2021-06-07,5,Bin 14 is truly the best! We are locals in Hoboken and every time we come in we are greeted with the utmost happiness and politeness. Every single staff member is caring and friendly! Stephanie the manager is truly one of a kind; respectful, caring, and hard working. She truly tries to make every experience the best for the customers. The food is fantastic as well as the cocktails and wine selection. EASILY the BEST wine bar in Hoboken!
2021-06-07,5,Whenever I'm in Hoboken , Bin 14 is a must visit! Consistently amazing , from the great service , delicious food, and the best of the best wine selection. It's a win for any time of the day.
2021-06-07,5,Definitely my go to place for brunch (and sometimes dinner lol) in Hoboken! Great food, warm welcoming staff, great cocktails. Whether you sit inside or enjoy their outdoor seating you're guaranteed to have dining experience that will have you coming back. Bin 14 is must! Love it there!
2021-06-01,5,Absolutely delicious! I'm gluten free and almost everything on the menu could be prepared gluten free. They made their own gf bread, and it was so yummy! Highly recommend!
2021-05-30,5,I cannot say enough great things about Bin 14, we had such a lovely experience dining here the other night. I was charged with organizing a dinner for a large group of people where all the important factors were up in the air until the very last moment. Could be 12 people, could be 6, could be anywhere in the middle? On Memorial Day weekend? Lots of things had the potential of going wrong. Bin 14 was so patient, helpful, and adaptive every single step of the way. Even at the last minute when the weather shifted to be colder than expected, they were able to move our party to the back room with the heat lamps. I am truly thankful for all the hoops and the back and forth that the staff had to go through. Christy the event manager was especially instrumental to making everything happen, and even personalized the event by getting a "happy graduation" card for the graduate we were celebrating that night. The restaurant is split into three sections, the outside front, the inside, and the outside back. Both outdoor areas are covered from the rain, the back being a little more enclosed. The entire place was very nicely decorated and had a very nice vibe. I loved all the plants and all the interesting elements that they incorporated into the decor. They say this place is known for their wine, and every bottle that we had was great. The food was delicious as well, we only ordered small shareable plats for the table but each one was delicious. We unfortunately only had one pizza, but I'd love to come back soon and try the others as well as their entrees and pasta dishes.  Thank you again, Bin 14!
2021-05-30,2,I wonder if Bin 14 is under new management?  My wife and I went last weekend for our anniversary, having been at least 2 or 3 times before (though last time was probably 5 years ago).  Prior times would have been 5 stars, but this time, the food was just totally bland and underwhelming.  It seems like the chef has changed, the crostini were not good (again, not like times past), and the pizza was just good - not great.  We ordered several different items off the menu, and none were better than average.Our waitress was good and made a good wine recommendation for my 2nd glass - but SAD:  Bin 14 has fallen off the cliff!  I would not visit with high expectations, unfortunately.
2021-05-23,5,This place is one of my absolute favorites! I love the staff - especially Sarai, Kristen, and Carlos.  The food is consistently delicious and it's easy to book for a fabulous table inside or out.  It's great for a date night or family dinner - pretty much any occasion.  If you didn't know, their gluten free pizza is THE BEST IN THE STATE! The octopus starter is yummy, and I love the wild mushroom pizza.  Visit and enjoy!
2021-05-23,1,They misleadingly advertise many of their fried food as Gluten Free. After being a loyal customer for over 10 years someone on the staff informed me they couldn't guarantee food is Gluten Free because of cross contamination due to frying zeppoles in the same fryer. Never once in the dozens and dozens of times I've been to Bin 14 has a waiter brought this cross contamination concern to my attention. I used to consider them a champion of Gluten Free dining and am extremely disappointment to have being misled for so long.
2021-05-18,5,Food was delicious and service was great. Came on a Tuesday night for their mussels special and it was totally worth it. You have a choice of 2 types of mussels, they're served with fries which are delicious and warm bread. Very filling and freshly made. I've also been here on another occasion for brunch and it was also very good. The staff is very attentive and friendly. I will definitely be back.
2021-05-17,4,Honestly I've heard of this place and I have probably driven by over 100 times and never actually knew where this was. I was recommended this place by my sister and decided to have my birthday dinner here. So let me begin with saying that the Washington St. Swizzle was amazing. My girlfriend had a white sangria and noted how great it was. For my entree I decided to go with the Sausage and Beef Bolognese and I do not regret it. It was by far one of the the best pastas I have had in a long time. I was so hungry that I ended up eating my sisters leftovers. My younger cousin and sisters boyfriend raved about the hanger steak and claimed how delicious their steak was. I am curious about the brunch and will be looking more into that for the summer.
2021-05-17,5,Neighborhood classic. Always an interesting selection of wine. My fave burrata in Hoboken.
2021-05-10,1,Did mothers day brunch.  Party of 7.  None of us enjoyed the food at all.  The pizza was bland, meatball was eneatable, burger was tasteless, zeppoles burnt , and one of the brushetta tasted like mashed BBQ  sauce..  The small plate amd entreÃÅe items on the menu domt even pair together well.  Choices made no sense.  The service was slow and lacked. EntreÃÅes being served and app plates not even cleared first.  Ugh,  what a waste of money and poor choice for my special day meal.
2021-04-25,5,I'm so glad we discovered bin 14. We had a fantastic dinner experience there last night. We got a bottle of the super Tuscan wine to split, which was full bodied and complimented our dinner. The black truffle burrata was delicious. We could've benefitted from a couple extra crostini to more evenly spread the cheese, but it was otherwise fine. The meatballs were fire, especially the red sauce. The meatballs were juicy. The prosciutto di Parma pizza was also fabulous. The cheeses were so creamy, and the fig was the perfect pop of sweetness to bring it together with the salty prosciutto. Finally, for dinner, our waitress convinced us to get an order of the zeppole and she brought us a complimentary glass of wine. The zeppole were yummy, like fried donut holes. We absolutely will be back at bin 14 in the near future. Also, the outdoor set up was great.
2021-04-18,5,This is my second time here and let me tell you why. The first time I was too drunk to remember. So I'm glad I tried again but it was DELICIOUS. I'm a tough critic of cacio e pepe after living in Italy and Bin 14's version on pizza is outstanding. Prosciutto pizza also amazing. Service is great and our waitress had great recommendations for wine pairings. Also they followed all Covid protocols. Can't wait to come back!
2021-04-16,4,Full disclosure I would give this place 3 1/2 stars.So we had brunch at Bin 14 over the weekend. It was a very cute setup outside and felt very safe and socially distant. All the staff were friendly and helpful.I made a reservation for the backyard garden but when we got there we were seated out front. I asked what happened and the host said there was a private party and they moved us. Would have been nice to have been told that before.At brunch there was this great band, but they were SO LOUD. We could barely hear ourselves and had to shout the entire brunch.The food was good, I had the salmon Benedict and we shared the shrimp polenta which was amazing!I like this place and would recommend going for dinner but would not go back for brunch, just a little too loud for me.
2021-04-07,4,Came here for brunch with some friends Easter Sunday food was delicious seating out side was beautiful, there was live music and it's dog friendly. Drinks were decent but i didn't stumble out of there like I hoped lol. Definitely would recommend!!
2021-04-05,4,I fantasize about this calamari from Bin 14. It's perfectly crispy, the capers and the peppers go perfectly...it's all just 'perfect' and magical. This is the first place I'll go for an app and a drink when I return to Hoboken.
2021-03-29,4,The one thing I love here more than anything is their calamari with peppers and capers. It's so delicious. I also love their bolognese, the other pastas aren't worth it.
2021-03-28,5,We came for a friend's bday dinner and could not have been happier. This type of dining (shared plates) is excellent for small groups as it elimates the weird moment at bill time. Easy to just split it! Everything was good, so many things we wanted to try on menu that we didn't have room for, so we will try next time. I believe based on the bill that waiter was David (blue hair) and he was EXCELLENT. We were very impressed by how friendly, attentive, and quick he was with service. He helped when I asked them to do a little bday candle with our dessert zeppoles and he even sang a bit which was fun. A very nice dinner that made for a very nice night!
2021-03-22,2,Honestly we weren't impressed.  Sure the brunch crowd packed the place both outdoor and indoor, we liked the band a lot and looked pretty good in the beginning....  but....Things went downhill pretty quickly.(1) Music.  We sat at the front window seat so we were able to hear the band pretty clearly but the restaurant decided to blast their own crappy 80s-2000s music to cancel the band music out.  I understand that the music is also for back patio customers who would have no way to listen to the band but why not just live feed the band music to the entire restaurant?  That's what ANY restaurant with live band would do.  I mean, I'm sure the band would have preferred to have the entire restaurant being able to listen to their music. (2) Speaking of music... the band went on break after a while and I saw that they were fed their meal but they were forced to stand with no space to eat at all.  I was not ok with the band members getting treated like that.  They should have been allowed to sit down like normal human beings.  If the restaurant was fully booked as I mentioned, the restaurant should have saved the space for them to eat.  (3) When the band came back from the break and started playing again, the manager decided to shut the door so that we couldn't hear the band.  Also the restaurant was getting warm and we would have appreciated the breeze from the door. Both myself and a couple from the next table protested to the manager and she was very arguementative.  This should not have even been a subject for debate at all.(4) Food was nothing special.  I had salmon benedict.  And it was too small for the price.  I had better ones in the neighborhood for sure.  We also got chicken sandwich and the chicken was too fatty.Overall, combined with rather sub par food quality/quantity and the way the management treat staff and customer in general, I don't believe this restaurant deserves that much of a hype.  There are plenty of better quality brunch spot in Hoboken that treat people better.  I don't think we would return and my recommendation is, don't waste time/money there either.
2021-03-21,2,Unfortunately, I can not give this place a higher review because trying to make a reservation for 7+ ppl was insane. They say on the website and when you call that all you have to do to make a reservation of this kind is to send an email. I have yet to receive an email or an acknowledgment of my email and my event was yesterday. Mind you, these were not last minute reservations. I think it is extremely unprofessional especially when I was not guided at all when I called to check on my reservation. When I called, I was told that someone would get in touch with me eventually and when I asked to speak to the person, they automatically said that person was unavailable. No option to leave a message or anything. I even sent 2 follow up emails and still received nothing. It is a shame because the food was good but trying to get in contact with someone was a huge disappointment. Because this was basically the only option for my friends and myself for a surprise birthday, we still went but could not have the amount of people that we desired. Overall my friend was happy but I can't help but think that she may have enjoyed her experience more if 2 of her other close friends were able to make it. If this were not the only option for us (because everywhere else did not have reservations for that day and we were able to make a reservation for 6 through the online portal) we would not have chosen this place due to the way we were treated trying to make a reservation. That is unfortunate because the food like I said was really good.
2021-03-19,4,My boyfriend and I stopped in Bin 14 for lunch a couple days ago. No one was inside which was great! The waitress seated us and gave us a minute to look over the menu on our phones.She didn't ask me what I wanted to drink which worried me "right off the bat." I just had some of my boyfriends sparkling water. Poured my glass.We ordered the Calamari to start, the Brussels sprouts, and the Bin Burger with fries extra crispy.Food came out pretty quick which was great. Sat for a few minutes cause the waitress wasn't around. Whatever. The calamari was very salty but we liked it haha. It had hot peppers and capers with it. Calamari was cooked perfect and breaded perfectly. Nice crunch. Okay portion for $12. We would get it again. If you have high blood pressure or heart problems though, don't get it haha.The Brussels sprouts were cooked perfectly. Not a bad portion for $9. Nice crunch and tasted fresh. We would get them again.The Bin burger had a thin patty. The bun was fresh and soft. $16 was a little on the high side for its size. We like dipping our fries in Bleu cheese and they don't have bleu cheese, for anyone else who wants to know lol. Fries cooked perfect!! Great chef! And we got cheddar on the burger, which the waitress asked which was nice. It was a good dish.We will be back to try other menu items. Maybe when business picks up there is two waitresses.
2021-03-13,1,Hostess was nasty, they messed up our reservation, did not answer the phone beforehand to clarify and then told us to leave. Did not even try to accommodate for 3 people on a 2 person reservation.
2021-03-10,4,Great food!! So so yummy. Kind of pricey but would still highly recommend. And the ambiance was amazing, perfect date spot :)
2021-03-10,5,I visited Bin 14 for Valentine's day and really enjoyed everything about it! We made a reservation in advance and were sat as soon as we arrived. The staff was really friendly and kept our wine glasses full. The plates were a little small for the price, but the quality was so amazing. Would highly recommend!
2021-02-28,5,Great food and great environment. Had dinner with a group and everything was delicious.
2021-02-15,3,We went to this restaurant as this place offers enclosed outdoor tent as well as outdoor heated seating which during the pandemic is a key criteria. We got the smoked hot Apple cider margarita and it was a perfect winter drink to have! We liked the truffle fries and fried eggplant Parmesan. The cauliflower gratin was a bit disappointing. We got the smoked chicken risotto and a margarita pizza which were also good but not something I would crave and go back for. The service was great and the menu offers some great variety!
2021-02-07,5,Ordered from Bin 14 Thursday and the food was great.  My favorite dish was the eggplant parm. Will enjoy going back once Covid is over to enjoy the full tapas menu.
2021-02-06,1,Nothing I can say will make me co.e back to Bin ever again. They are inconsiderate, rude ( to certain customers), obnoxious, and in bad taste faith did not honor a reservation. Will never go, enter pass nor recommend again!
2021-02-06,3,This has been one of my go to places in Hoboken but the last two visits I have had very unpleasant experiences with the hostess.  She has been incredibly rude, with a big attitude, as if I was inconveniencing her.  It's as if she doesn't want our business.  She barked at us to leave, because our time was up at our table, when we were simply waiting for the restroom.  I was very disappointed.  She could have been courteous, but instead was pushy and rude.  BIG disappointment.  The restaurant should really think about who they put in as a hostess, as this person represents your business and is supposed to make people feel welcome, it's inherent in the name, the position is "hostess"' not "rudeness". That said, the waitress was lovely and the food doesn't disappoint.
2021-01-24,5,I've been to wine bars in New York and this supersedes them all. The food is incredible, the wine is top notch and the prices are unbeatable. I will be coming here probably every week. They have live music on Sundays, and Carlos was amazing recommending his favorite wines (that may be my favorite now too). Incredible service, food, wine, and atmosphere. You can't go wrong.
2021-01-23,5,I came here with 5 others for indoor dining. Even though the restaurant is small, I felt safe covid wise as our table was in the back. Food, cocktails, & service were incredible! They did not rush us out and were very attentive. All in all, the staff was able to accommodate multiple gluten-free diets. My only issue was our initial server gave us a hard time about 2 of us not having a gluten allergy, saying they typically only accommodate the brunch appetizer option if you have such. I do understand, however there are plenty of other legitimate health reasons that require one to be gluten free. Just because somebody is not fully allergic doesn't mean they should have to explain themselves. The gluten free calamari and pizza were the best I've ever had. Their outdoor set up looked really nice, both street and out back. Highly recommend!
2021-01-23,2,If you want good Italian food or small plates, don't come here. You should go to either Sorellinas or Amanda's. The portions even for the entrees here were small and didn't blow me away. They were also overpriced. The service was pretty awful. It took them 30 minutes to come to us for drinks in the freezing cold. Even though we sat in the wooden structure they made, it was still freezing and you needed to be fully bundled. They also put an extra drink on the bill and after I told them we did not order it and to check our table, they still had to come back and ask again if we ordered it. All in all I would definitely not come back as Hoboken has way better restaurants to eat or drink at.
2021-01-23,2,Overpriced for a place with average Italian food and a half ass wine selection. The staff was rude. It took them 20 minutes to take just a drink order. Then they pressured us to order our food because the kitchen was busy but then our meal came out in less than 15 minutes ? They also put two unordered items on our bill. This place only gets good reviews because basic girls who love the idea of going to a wine bar to take cute pics hype this place up. If you know good food and good wine then you'll find this place highly overrated.
2021-01-17,5,Just moved to Hoboken last month and have been on the hunt for Gluten Free Pizza. This place is AMAZING. Best GF pasta/pizza around and Carlos is the best. This is my new neighborhood go to!
2020-12-30,5,This place is AWESOME. So so delicious!! We sat in the back patio area where the tables are partitioned by plastic coverings. Our waitress was amiable and attentive. The meatballs may be some of the best I ever had! Loved the brussel sprouts, burrata, octopus, calamari and the pizza. All small plates, tapas style, and the pizzas are tiny as a heads up.The crust of the pizza is super fresh - def need to try. I want to come back to try the beets and the squash pizza. :)
2020-12-27,4,The ExperienceThe back patio was tucked away like a speakeasy for brunches. It had plastic dividers for extra safety and lots of heaters. As if powered by my hate for frozen hands the heaters kept us plenty warm even on the 34-degree day. The online menu was a bit confusing but eventually, even our simple brains figured it out.The AccoutrementsThree bruschettas were ordered like a flight of carbs with different toppings on each. As usual, I went for the sausage, and it was a good pick. It was savory and the peppers didn't make it too sweet. I didn't try the rest but everyone else seemed happy with what they tried.The calamari was light, well breaded, and after a lemon squeeze fragrant as well. The pickled peppers (unsure if picked by a peter) added a good acidic touch as well. Twas a classic rendition of this cephalodish but well done.The Main CourseI got the egg in a hole entree which consisted of beautifully buttery brioche bread with an egg buried in the center like my emotions are buried in me. Taking time for pictures made the yolk cook a bit more but still got some good runniness. On top was ham that was good enough to seem like it didn't come from a random deli. The mornay sauce which was like a southern-style gravy brought it all together.The VerdictBin 14 is good enough to make you think they had 13 other practice bins before this one. None of the food items disappointed and the back patio was as warm as one could hope. If you're looking for a good spot next weekend check out Bin 14.
2020-12-13,1,I've had the Bolognese before and it was amazing. This time was terrible. It was just pasta in a pool of oil. It was inedible. Extremely disappointed because I normally love them!
2020-11-25,4,I have been to Bin 14 countless times over the last ten years.  The space is intimate and welcoming, and their enclosed rear garden feels like an escape from the hustle and bustle of Washington Street.  Their wine list is incredible, and their Friday night wine tastings are a fun way to learn more about several vintages within a given theme.  In fact, both have helped me discover new and unusual wines that I have not even been able to find in local liquor stores.  On my recent dinner visit, I ordered a glass of the 2018 Domaine Hamelin Petite Chablis from Bourgogne, France, which was crisp, bright, and had notes of green apple.The seasonal food menu is always enticing as well.  The fresh ingredients are incorporated into a variety of small, shareable plates, as well as larger entrees.  I just had their Quinoa Salad, which included brussels sprouts, currants, and watermelon radish.  The mix of earthy and sweet flavors came together with the garlicky tzatziki dressing.  In addition, the Pan-Roasted Salmon main course consisted of a perfectly cooked, tender filet draped over an "autumn ragout" of wild mushrooms, toasted corn, English peas, thyme, and sliced fingerling potatoes.  While these were two of the lighter options on the menu, they both packed impressive amounts of flavor.Bin 14 is a gem that offers a classy, yet relaxed atmosphere; varied, seasonal fare; and an extensive beverage list.
2020-11-20,5,What an incredible meal & even better service. So kind and take great care of customers. All peptides, main courses & drinks were delicious. Definitely coming back!
2020-11-17,2,Server acted as though he didn't want to be working, which i completely understand, except he was working. We made a Sunday reservation to sit outside. We were told the heaters were working. Turns out the heaters in the front of the place are randomly spaced in between tables  and provide no actual heat to the tables. we asked to sit in the back after being told it was a covered outdoor area with heaters. The hostess sat us and pointed to the heat lamp facing our table great. The waiter came and we asked that he turn the lamp on and he said "it doesn't work." Seriously?? Prosciutto and fig pizza was good, chicken sandwich was terrible and flavorless as was the calamari. Thankfully it was a cheap meal. Got in and got out, and will not be returning.
2020-11-04,4,I haven't been here in a while and I feel like I have been missing out. The first time I came I didn't love the experience but this time it was good. The food was the major difference this time around.  We ordered 2 cavatelli dishes.  The cavatelli with sausage and cavatelli with bolognese were both delicious. The pasta was al dente and the sauces were jusr right. We also tried the caccio pepe pizza and although it is a touch salty it was still really good. The meatball starter is spot on as well. They had a mushroom risotto that night as well but I would skip that next time.The ambiance was perfect for a date night so make sure to come with the gf's/wives. I also bet it is a popular spot for first dates as well. It has that romantic charm. The food definitely hit the mark today so I had to adjust my ratings. I will be back sooner rather than later!
2020-10-31,4,Brunch today around 1 outside was enjoyable- although a bit chilly we ordered drinks and food to help keep us warm! I also made a reservation on Resy, super easy! The server wasn't that friendly but that's ok- drinks were good and so was the food. The zeppole brunch ($29) includes a starter and entree from the selected menu. We tried meatballs, calamari, breakfast burgers and waffles. Everything came out fresh, which I really appreciated. Overall nice experience!
2020-10-26,3,I understand that the restaurant culture is to charge  a lot for a glass but when the glass of wine is the same price for a bottle of wine that just pisses me off. The food was not worth the price either nothing to boast about but I'm giving it a 3 out of 5 review because the 2 different types of wine that I did get I really enjoyed and plan on buying a bottle in the future so the place does have good taste when it comes to wine.
2020-10-18,1,Service was terrible!! Waitresss couldnt remember what we ordered and asked 3 different times instead of writing it down. Took 30 min to get drinks and we were never brought any water. I was told the slow service was due to many cancelations and some other excuse, which was not a reason to be treated that way. I understand there is a pandemic and restaurants are suffering, but i have been to plenty or restaurants throughout the pandemic and have not experienced service like this. Will not be returning!
2020-10-08,1,I usually would give Bin 14 5 stars as I order regularly however I just received my order for a Gluten Free pizza and it was regular crust which I am allergic too. I cant get through on the phone to them to fix this order. Seemless rarely refunds orders as well. Not a good experience
2020-10-04,1,I have to say, we were excited to go back to one of our favorite places on a beautiful fall day. We sat outside at a table that was reasonably spaced from the other tables. I immediately noticed the wine list had many changes on it. I didn't recognize many of the wines and so I asked to try one of the wines. I tried a rose which was not good and much too alcohol forward. My boyfriend tried a sparkling wine that was warm and flat. We both tried 2 more wines which were also mediocre but felt bad so we just drank those two glasses. We were not offered water for the table or brought any water at any point in time. We ordered an appetizer which was nothing to write about and I had the chicken sandwich and my boyfriend had the burger. I don't understand why they ask you what temperature you want your burger cooked if it comes out well done anyway. They never asked us if we wanted another glass of wine nor were they concerned with empty glasses and no water on the table. Honestly, a terrible experience and not worth the $85 for a lackluster lunch and a disappointing experience all around.
2020-09-05,4,I've been wanting to try Bin 14 for years now. I've attempted to go several times, but was never able to get in. The restaurant is very small, so the outdoor seating was a nice addition. I'm happy I was finally able to visit!The restaurant was a mix of emotions for me. For starters, I think the food is excellent and the zeppolini brunch is a great deal. For $29, you get zeppolis, an app + entree of your choice. I HIGHLY recommend the bruschetta to start - the sausage and pepper and tomato basil were incredible. For my entree, the fried chicken sandwich was tasty. My friend also got the mushroom frittata and enjoyed it.On the flip side, the service was painfully slow. We are very understanding during COVID, but our dining experience for a group of three lasted hours. We were constantly left without water, utensils, etc. so don't come here for a quick bite. They have no tap water available, so you must pay for still or sparkling water. Also, they don't let you pay cash but charge you a CC fee. None of these experiences would prevent me from coming back here again, but it's a bit of an annoyance and worth noting.I'm happy I tried Bin 14, and I'm looking forward to returning sometime soon.
2020-08-26,2,I don't have the time nor the patience to relive and write out last night's experience, so please just trust me when I say that when you go to a fairly nice restaurant and pay a fairly nice price, you like to expect a certain level of service. This place does not offer that service. The food is delicious but not worth it.
2020-08-01,3,Overall, the service from our waitress and food & drinks were great. I would've given this review 5 stars, however the hostess was greeting and serving food/drinks without a mask on. It made for a very uncomfortable dining experience. Wish mask wearing was better enforced among the employees.
2020-07-03,2,Don't get drinks here. Get them next door at Madison's. Very expensive and my girl and I can't even finish 1 drink. Watery and gross NGL
2020-06-29,1,Horrible service! They sit you down and then the waiters just walk by you until you call them and tell them that you have been there waiting for over 20 minutes and nobody came over your table. Food takes FOREVER and the place is not even half full. Food was cold and tasteless. Please skip this place and do yourself a favor!
2020-06-18,5,We've been here several times in previous, normal circumstances, and always had a great experience. Servers and bartenders are happy to recommend a wine and let you have a taste before you decide. Food is always tasty, and we've even hit a Sunday afternoon happy hour here - who does that?! Amazing. Most recently, we had a great experience returning to outdoor dining. They had good regulations in place, with plexiglass dividers splitting up tables, which made us feel safe while near other diners, while still giving us the experience of being out to eat and amongst other people. I also liked that the menu could be quickly pulled up by phone via QR code- smart and eco friendly, since they're not trashing a ton of paper menus! Servers were kind and answered our questions. Also, I have to recommend the white negroni - best summer drink ever. We will be back!
2020-06-16,5,Bin 14 has been on my list of spots to try since moving to the area two years ago. The two of us went this past Monday, now that restaurants are starting to open up and were so impressed, not only with the food and the service, but the way they are managing in this post-COVID world. We were seated out back in the courtyard - tables appropriately spaced with hanging plexiglass in between. You felt a bit more safe but still got to enjoy to feeling of being out amongst others which I know I've been sorely missing these past few months. We went with a bottle of wine, the cacio e pepe pizza, the truffle fries, and the eggplant wedges. Everything was SO good! Will definitely be back.
2020-06-01,1,Price gauging at its finest! $80 for 4 margaritas with a side of bad attitude from the servers. Never again. No wonder they had no line and Madison's next door was packed.
2020-05-13,2,I've always felt this place was overpriced and a little off when it came to the food menu. IMO, there are a handful of small plates that are decent but many of the menu items miss the boat. Ordered take out to support a local business. I thought fried chicken sounded good when I saw it on the menu. Rather than being chicken on the bone, it was a chicken breast that was cut into 4 pieces. Completely dry and tasteless with greasy batter. Good burrata should be creamy and flavorful, but this was tasteless. Not sure how the chicken wings were as they were soaking the the watery mayo from the accompanying potato salad. Pizza and salads are fine when you are eating outside. Meatballs and some of the small plates are fine when you're siting outside and drinking. Beyond that, this place isn't up to par.
2020-03-25,5,Bin 14 is a great place. Warm staff, great wine selection, wide menu options, friendly to my toddler even if he's not behaved, great to sit at the bar and have a drink and a snack, etc. Go to spot.
2020-03-21,5,I wanted to update my review to thank them for their great service.  Today, I placed an order on Grubhub.  An hour later, GrubHub did not show up to Bin14 to pick up my food.  I called the restaurant, and someone immediately came to my place to deliver my food.  So I just wanted to thank them for their customer service and for going above and beyond, especially during a time like this.  So thank you.
2020-02-23,5,The food and service has been consistently good. This place has a special place in our hearts for it was one of the few restaurants opened after hurricane Sandy hit and many of us did not have electricity or gas to cook. I'll never forget the meatballs & Shiraz!! Thank you!!
2020-02-17,1,Stopped by for a drink on our day off (Presidents Day). The bar had two seats opened so we were super happy as we've been going to Bin 14 for years. We normally have great food but just *OKAY* service. Because we have been going there for years we sorta expected that however today was NEXT LEVEL bad service. My fiance ordered a margarita and i ordered an aperol spritz. after ordering i ran to wash my hands and on the way back the server told me the bar was completely OUT of prosecco so i couldn't have my spritz. No big deal, i'll order something else. For the next ~15 minutes we watched as our server and the other bartender walked by and ignored us. finally, i order a margarita as a back up and the server and bartender disappeared! theres no one there to make my drink! took another ~10 minutes for the server to tell the bartender about my margarita. after receiving my margarita i noticed the bartender went to the storage room and came back with a bottle of PROSECCO and said out loud "look i found a bottle". now, of course after i saw this i expected our server to let me know that they found another bottle of prosecco and that my next drink could be a spritz or even offer to switch my margarita to the spritz..but NOPE she didn't do that. what she did was look right at me, lean in to whisper to the bartender and said "turn that label around. i told her we didn't have any prosecco". it was so rude and disrespectful and honestly NOT the hospitality i expect from an anthony pino restaurant. also, what kind of wine bar runs out of prosecco? aside from the prosecco incident the bar and restaurant were insanely understaffed and mismanged. the bartender and server were running food, taking food orders, and bussing both the bar and the tables. the bar back was literally standing drying dishes as the bar was left bartenderless. would've made sense to have 1 waitress, 1 bartender, and then have the barback help between the tables and the bar clean up. i'm so disappointed by this entire experience today. we sat at the bar the entire time and never had ONE interaction with the actual bartender! we won't be returning back for a while.. if we even decide to do so.
2020-02-11,3,We've been here for lunch and dinner for a long time. The food is great but the service sometimes is not that good. I don't know if just for me, it's really annoying when I'm not feel welcomed . We will sit on the table waiting for someone coming to check on us over 10 mins. However My daughter still loves to go to BIN 14 so I cannot stop to come. I just wish you can see my review and be better in the short future. There is non restaurant in Hoboken makes me feel like this.
2020-02-11,3,This place is lovely with good lighting and a cozy atmosphere. Our server was attentive and accommodating. Unfortunately the food and menu left a lot to be desired. There is a pizza oven displayed in the open kitchen but the pizza  Margherita tasted like something you would get at an amusement park or IKEA.   While I would happily return for a drink at the bar, I would not return to dine.
2020-02-09,3,I like going to bin 14 for brunch and if the rating was just about the drinks and food this place would be closer to 5 stars, but the service sucks. They are very unorganized with keeping a waitlist which seems essential since they don't take brunch reservations. I had an experience where we were skipped and the hostess tried to lie and say she called us and we didn't answer. When I called her out she told me that usually after 15 minutes people don't want to wait so she just skips them. That seemed weird to me. The waiter was pretty good, but he was definitely in charge of too many tables so we were waiting a bit for refills and such.
2020-02-03,3,I've been to Bin 14 a bunch since it's close to my apartment. This reservation is about brunch.  Tried brunch here this past Saturday. They don't take reservations online but apparently you can call and make them ( I did not know this). We showed up a party of 5 around 1:15 and put our names in. Was told the wait would be 45 min - hour. We went to bar next door for drinks as we waited. After an hour my friend walked over to check on the wait. The host said we could sit outside in heated patio immediately or a table inside should be another 25 min. The girls just needed to pay. After another 30 min went by, I called to check on things. The host said the table was putting on coats and should be leaving  shortly, to come over.  It took us about 10 min to pay our check at Madison's and then walk over. When we got there, the table was still not ready. The host said they were just sitting around and had paid. They didn't even have drinks left. This is not acceptable. Finally the host told them they needed to go. What was supposed to Be an hour wait turned into nearly two.  As far as the food, they do a brunch special which is a good deal. 29 dollars includes a smallPlate, entree, brunch drink and zeppolis to start. I had the rock shrimp which was tasty as my starter. I also tried the calamari which was good.  For my entree I  had the Cacio pepe pizza which was good but nothing to rave about. My friend enjoyed her chicken sandwich which had really good truffle fries. My friends omlette was tiny and he was still hungry in the end. I'd totally try brunch again just cause of the pricing but not without a reservation!
2020-01-09,2,Service is so slow here. Waiters pass by you and don't even ask if you need anything. Food is pretty good.
2020-01-06,4,We came for the Zeppolini Brunch and had a most enjoyable experience. The Bin Benedict was one of the best I have ever had, eggs cooked to perfection with pancetta on focaccia. I had my Hollandaise sauce on the side because I am not really a fan. The Rock Shrimp was also a great choice, a bit spicy and served over creamy polenta. Other notables were the Wild Mushroom Frittata and the Burger. The brunch included your first cocktail, 3 Zeppolini with dipping sauce (yummy), choice of one small plate and one entree. There were 6 different brunch cocktails to choose from which were $3 for 1.5 hours after your first. Wow!  We will definitely be back. A must try for brunch when in Hoboken!
2020-01-04,2,It's a wine bar with a bubbles section that says champagne. There's no champagne on the menu, and no flutes for bubbles. The "sommelier" says no one uses flutes anymore. One thing is for sure, the somm is an arse. Food is hit or miss, but consistently overpriced. Don't really get the hype. Good for a glass of wine at the bar I guess.Update: somm threw a hissy fit about my review  see pic lol
2020-01-04,4,My First visit was FANTASTIC.I sat at the bar, had AMAZING Service, and ordered a Pizza that was So Good.Came a Second time, and actually ordered the same pizza again because I liked it so much, it was just as Good, if not Better....But, this time I was with a friend, and we sat at a table. It was Relatively quiet, not busy.It took FOREVER to get a server to acknowledge us. She was on the rude side, not personable at all.I'll return, however, I feel that the waitstaff left much to be desired.
2020-01-01,1,I'm disappointed to say that we had an awful experience at Bin 14. We came for the 5pm seating on NYE - and we're so excited for the night, as it was our first time leaving the house without our 7 week old and 12 month old. It was not busy during this seating (the restaurant was mostly empty since it was so early), yet we still had pretty terrible service. We had to ask for everything - water, the drink menu, dinner menu, drinks, more drinks... we even had a difficult time flagging someone down just to order. Our server was incredibly rude to us and really no one gave us the time of the day. We were very disappointed to say the least. Especially on a holiday, a night we were really looking forward to, and paid a good amount of money for.
2019-12-30,3,Went for brunch. The food and drinks were good, but the service was poor. Our waitress would vanish for very long periods of time and we waited over 35 minutes after we were done eating for her to come back to our table so we could ask for our check. When we asked other servers if they could get our waitress for us, they stared blankly and would walk away.
2019-12-18,5,I don't normally use the word exquisite to describe anything, but my experience here was just that. From the moment I walked in I was greeted with kindness and provided a generous wine sample within seconds of sitting at the bar. All of the wine I tried was incredible and there was not a wine I did not like. Joel was very knowledgeable regarding all of the wines and Dave an excellent bartender, they both truly made my night. The bruschetta here is to die for and the portions are very generous for that dish. If you love wine, good food and company I suggest you drop by Bin 14.
2019-11-16,3,Great wine, atmosphere and reasonably prices. Burrata and bruschetta are delicious. Pizza was great but not the best. Good portion for personal size
2019-10-28,4,Cute location and has a really great brunch deal. The drinks are great and are only $3 when you do the brunch deal! Totally recommend the Hoboken Tea!
2019-10-14,4,My husband and I went for their Tuesday special, all you can eat mussels and fries.  It's a great deal if you like mussels, it was fresh and tasty.  It's a 3 stars for food but a 5 stars for our lovely server, Zehra!  She was attentive, engaging and friendly even though only her and another server was working that evening with the restaurant completely full!  We would go back just for Zehra.
2019-10-12,5,I was in Hoboken for a couple of hours and was hungry. I stumbled upon this wine bar that looked great. The bartender was very hospitable and friendly. I ended up getting the burrata and arugula pie. It was amazing and worth trying. They also have a good happy hour and a back porch area.
2019-10-12,4,The staff is okay, but the food is a above average. There is a plethora of gluten free options, but I've had better gluten free pizza at other places. Overall, Bin 14 is a cozy spot in uptown Hoboken great for a date night or catching up with friends. The fried calamari is gluten free and a highlight of the tapas style menu.
2019-10-10,4,Nice place for a date night. The ambience was very pleasant. Most of the things we had were great and some were just good. Portions were small but that allowed us to order a lot! Cute outdoor seating as well.
2019-09-24,4,I'd say come for a glass of wine and a pizza, otherwise you may leave hungry. Our waitress was super friendly and made great recommendation on wine. She also helped me settle on something when I couldn't decide between the paella and a pizza. But pizza it was. My Wild Mushroom pie was perfect and covered in delicious mushrooms just as I'd hoped. My boyfriend, who hates mushrooms, stared in disgust. It was a white pie and covered in arugula. So tasty and the perfect size for a dinner for one person. Super reasonably priced too at $14. My boyfriend got the carnitas, which although tasty, were only two tacos. Maybe they were on the filler side but still, not really anything substantial. He ended up getting a pie for himself as well. The carnitas were $16 which blew me away for two tacos. But he loved his pie and in the end left full and happy. Along with a glass of wine, it was a really nice dinner. Maybe a little on the pricey side. But I have big plans to return one day soon for that white clam pizza.
2019-09-19,3,This place has a really good wine selection but the food is alright. We got one pizza and it was okay, the pasta carbonara was decent (peas a little undercooked) there's timed seating for an hour so you can't relax there the whole night
2019-08-20,3,Love this place especially Kristen & Joel.  I stop by weekly but have slowed down coming in because of the lack of air conditioning, and also the relaxed attitude to the details lately not reflective of the staff.  Hoping for improvements; one of the best places in Hoboken and has more potential.
2019-07-08,4,The food was tasty but the portions are way too small for the price you're paying. Definitely not a place I would go for dinner again, just a place to have a quick meal before a bigger one. Other than this, the staff was very friendly. The place itself was also very calm and clean!
2019-06-29,4,I went on a Saturday with my friends for brunch. It was pretty low key and wasn't too busy. We all enjoyed the food and appetizers which we shared. The best part was the option to enjoy multiple drinks during the unlimited boozing 90 mins. The variety was refreshing and their wine director credited himself for that. Definitely a great spot to try out on the weekend. I didn't love my crab cake sandwich but might just be a personal issue. Just didn't win me over but everything else was delicious.
2019-06-17,5,Extremely friendly and helpful staff that are so welcoming and helpful especially when picking wine and food! We love coming here. Some food favorites include: cavatelli pasta, octopus app, and the 12th & Passyunk on gluten free crust! Sitting at the bar is the best experience.
2019-06-13,5,Food was absolutely delicious. I ordered the gluten-free pizza and the beet salad.. went with a big party so we all tried each other's food and it was great. Best gluten free pizza I've had thus far. Also, they had organic wine. I've never been to a place that has organic wine. I was amazed!!!! The only thing I would say is we waited 45 minutes to get seated and we had reservations ... but everything else made up for it. I would recommend them for their high quality ingredients.
2019-05-23,5,The best experience i've had in a while in Hoboken.  Excellent staff, knowledgeable, hospitable and accommodating.  Wine selection was the best i've seen in North Jersey.  Food was paired perfectly.  I'll be back in the not too distant future.  Thanks again! We had a great time !
2019-05-11,4,After coming to Bin 14 a number of times over a solid year, I have been able to eat and drink through the extensive menu enough to know it warrants a solid 4 stars.The wine program and cocktail list is quite extensive and Joel the sommelier is more then willing to cater to what you like and challenge you with new drinks that might lie a little outside your comfort zone. Even if your standby is a good ol Gin and Tonic, the amount of different Gin styles they have behind the bar will keep you trying different combinations for a long time.With the menu changing seasonally, it can be hard to have your favorites stay on all the time. Yet even for all the change, the food ranges from very good to above average. From the past year, some of my fiance's and my own personal favorites include the fried chicken, all of the bruschetta, the mushroom pizza and burrata pizza. The one complaint about this place is that the price you pay for the food compared to the portion size is way out of whack. You can walk out of the restaurant paying close to 100 dollars per couple in wine and food and still be hungry for a late night snack. Overall though, if you are looking for an extensive wine list and interesting nibbles to have on the side, then Bin 14 should be on your list.
2019-05-06,5,Probably one of my favorite places in Hoboken. There aren't too many true wine bars around so I thoroughly enjoy this one. They have a good selection of wine and good food to pair. My favorite is the mozzarella and the rock shrimp with polenta. What I love about this place is that it's cozy. It's small and quaint... like a wine bar should be. It has out door seating up front and a heated garden seating  in the back. I've sat in all places and have never had a bad time here. I prefer to sit at the bar because I like to interact With the bartender. Years ago when I was going here more often it wasn't really over packed. Now it's become popular and it's hard to get a table at times. I think they should open another one ! Hint hint.. anyway a great date night spot if you're looking for one but call ahead especially on the weekend!
2019-04-19,4,Came here here last summer in June and this place is def memorable !, they have so many delicious gluten free items for people and I didn't even notice until after I finished the calamari lol ... we sat at the bar and I believe his name was Gary ?! Possibly lol, but he was extremely helpful finding us the perfect roseÃÄ to try out... the Resturant was still fairly new and it was quite inside so I just snapped a few photos of the beautiful decor before I left ... I will def be back when I'm in the are la to try some new dishes , the meatballs were my favorite !!!
2019-03-30,2,Mediocre food with terrible service. Our waiter seemed very out of it and kept forgetting about our order. At the end when we didn't understand the bill, they sent someone over with a calculator to do the math in front of us and rudely explain what the charges meant (the charges didn't seem to match the prices on the menu so we were confused). Not worth the hype. I do not plan on returning.
2019-03-25,3,Meh.....Most likely this type of dining just isnt my thing because other people seemed to be enjoying it... but then again a lot of people do stupid trendy things just because other people are doing stupid trendy things.  We had fresh mozz with truffle honey... it smelled like gym socks and had very little taste. Wild boar sausage pizza, the meat tasted old (but that's because it was wild game). Steak tar tar.... totally tasteless. Roasted beets.... exactly the same as opening a can of beets at home. The margherita pizza was ok and so were the meatballs. But for $14-18 per small plate I expect something more than just ok.   Much to do about nothing.We wont be returning
2019-03-09,4,We went there for an evening date night. The place is quite cozy. From time to time the place does get noisy but overall ambience is feel good vibe! Wine list is average. We just had several small plates and appetizers. Food was pretty good. Their Mozzarellas are nice and so is beer salad. Overall nice, friendly Hoboken spot!
2019-03-08,4,I went to Bin 14 for a girls night dinner and the food was amazing! As a gluten free person (not by choice by celiac) I truly appreciate when a restaurant has tons of options for me to choose from.  Highlight for me was the calamari (which is done in chickpea flour).  It was so so good! We also had excellent service and a great waitress who continued to re-fill our wine glasses.  All in all, great food and options for gluten free people as well. This place continues to be one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken.
2019-02-23,4,I love this place. Great wine selection and the food is so good too! Cozy and warm vibe. Perfect for a date night. The only negative is that the plates can be kind of small, but so good that it doesn't matter. Make sure you try the truffle fries.
2019-02-17,4,Great brunch for $29... have to try the Bloody Mary and the meatball For small plates!
2019-02-15,4,Bin 14 has amazing food, drinks, and service. But There were 1-2 mishaps that I find really unprofessional. Disclaimer: I think some of my issues had to do with that it was Valentine's Day, so keep that in mind.The good:The food was the best I've had in Hoboken and I've lived here for a few years now. The service was impeccable, our drinks were never empty and the environment of the place was very nice. The food came out quickly, but we never felt rushed. I had the lobster carbonara and the creamy arancini. All of our wines and drinks were really good. I was very happy when we finally got seated. The bad: I had a reservation for 9pm and I got a text message at 7:57 telling me to be there in 30 mins. I arrived on time at 8:30 and was told I will not be seated until 9:30. Thankfully there is a bar next door and a few nearby. We told the hostess to call us, which she didn't...we walked back at 9:25 and saw two empty tables. Maybe it was perfect timing, maybe it wasn't? Who knows. The day after I booked the reservation online, I received a call around 8:45pm from bin14 confirming my reservation again over the phone. I don't think businesses should be calling that late at night. That's poor judgement.
2019-02-10,4,Went here for brunch- good deal. Three course meal for 30 dollars. Starts with zeppoles and then a small plate and entree.  Service was good they checked in on us the right amount. We sat outside, which was fine. But the inside looked way cuter and nice.  Would go back again.
2019-01-27,4,Since the waiting staff has been changed through years, I really have been enjoying the place lately. I can tell the food has been pretty consistent (which is important), wine list is always very impressive (a bit pricey though) and as I said before people are very welcoming there and warm. I hope they will keep it, I always loved the spot, but never was regular because of the unwelcoming atmosphere. Now, they have hooked me for sure
2019-01-26,3,My girlfriend wanted a boozy brunch for her birthday and this place came highly recommended. She made a reservation for a group of 10 that was CONFIRMED for 1PM. However, when we showed up at like 12:50-12:55,  we were told that we had to wait until another party left because they had the other half of our table (one table was set for 5 already and they gave our other table away). So we ended up waiting for 30 mins for our table, which was extremely annoying and unprofessional. It would have made it better if we received any type of apology or anything but the manager was very unapologetic.Anyways, we all decided to partake in the Bin Brunch which is $29 that included 1 drink, a small plate and an entree. And drinks after that for 90 mins are $3. Food & Drinks1/2 -  I started off with the rock shrimp, which came served over mashed potatoes, which was actually delicious. The sauce on the shrimp combined with the potatoes was a lovely blend. My SO decided to go with the meat and cheese board, which also was very delicious with the different variations of meat and cheeses. For the entrees, we went with the crab cake sandwich and the mushroom pizza. While my entree was pretty great, the mushroom pizza was bland and a bit oily. The one star deduction is due to the drinks. While our first drink was good, the subsequent drinks progressional became more watered down and longer to obtain. They really milked our 90 mins. Service0.5/1 - Our waitress was uhm, angry. It appeared she may have woken up on the wrong side of the bed. Just uninviting overall. Price 2/2 - For price point of $29, you can't say it isn't a great deal for the amount of food you get. I'd probably just avoid getting additional drinks, you're paying $3 for a mixer at that point. Happy eatings!
2018-11-11,2,Truly I'd give this place 2.5 stars. I had a reservation for noon for 2 during Saturday brunch. The place was pretty busy when I arrived. Our waitress was MIA for most of our stay. It took 15 minutes to put in an order, our drink arrived shortly after, but the time between the zeppoles, appetizer and then entree felt like it took forever. The waitress barely checked on us and getting drink refills was very difficult. I thought that the food was okay but nothing special, I had the bin benedict which I know would be tasty but the focaccia bread it was served on had a burnt taste which masked any other flavor there. The potatoes were fantastic, flavorful. Had my dish not had the burn flavor I know it would have been delicious. After we finished it took another 25 minutes of idle sitting and asking our waitress twice for the check before she finally brought it over. While I think that they were understaffed in general, this waitress still could have been more attentive, I was disappointed. Based on what I thought was the value of my brunch and lack of service, I may try bin 14 again to give it another chance but I can't see myself eager to go again.
2018-11-04,5,One of the best restaurants in Hoboken! Great for a date or a big group. Food is so good. Lots of small plates so everyone can try a bite of something. Pizzas are delicious.
2018-10-29,5,What a great spot! Wonderful selection of wine and Johl the waiter /bartender was fantastic. Knew exactly want we wanted.  The chef did a wonderful job at creating a mixture of palettes. The buratta, the toast, all so delicious.
2018-10-19,2,Food- delicious! Honestly, 5 star for experience- so you know what's coming... our waiter was pretty terrible (I was a waitress, so I come from an understanding of all the things involved in the experience, I promise). However, we were sitting outside in the back, where only one other table was. We constantly had to waive him down and, at one point, we were sitting with empty plates, empty wine glasses, and empty water glasses in front of us (which he could see from 5 feet away I'm sure)- and he SAT DOWN with the other customers to chat! Not kidding. He only came over when my husband went to try to get a dessert menu (probably was worried he was going to complain)- to rudely tell us they don't even have dessert. The food probably won't even be enough incentive to return for that type of treatment.
2018-09-26,5,One of my favorite gluten free spots in Hoboken. The gluten free pizza crust is amazing! The staff are super friendly and great at sharing drink suggestions. Highly recommend for a date spot a hangout with friends. Small place and can be hard to get a seat on crowded nights, but worth the wait.
2018-09-18,5,Favorite restaurant in Hoboken.   Amazing wine list and you can even buy the bottles and take them home.  The octopus is to die for.  Not to crazy bout their brunch menu but there dinner menu is top choice.
2018-09-14,5,The grilled octopus is to die for and their selection of wines is top notch!  Went here in a date night with my lady and was very impressed.
2018-08-13,5,It's inexplicable to me that this place isn't rated at least 4.5 Stars. The food is fantastic, great wine selection and ambience. I've been coming here for years and it's always been a success. Take it from a foodie who has spent the last 12 years dining all over Manhattan: this place is fantastic.
2018-08-06,1,*2018 Summer Hudson Restaurant Week Review*When you first walk in, you will be greeted with the smell of a toilet. The outdoor back patio area is slightly less toilet-smelling, so try to get a seat there if you can. We went with the RW menu, which was $30 for dinner and includes three courses. For the first course, my BF and I both went with the mixed bruschetta (tuna tartare and goat cheese fava). The color of the tuna tartare looked a little bit off but I ate it anyway and it wasn't bad. I gave the goat cheese one to my BF since I'm not a fan of that cheese. For the second course, he had the rock shrimp (polenta, pecorino and chillis) and I had the artichoke and potato rosti (poached egg, truffle cream). The polenta was actually pretty good, but the shrimp was sad looking/tasting - like those little tiny frozen shrimp you'd get from a supermarket. The rosti wasn't bad either but I couldn't really taste any artichokes in the dish. For the third course, he had the duck pizza (cabbage, gorgonzola, currants, ricotta, poached egg), and I had the fried chicken (toasted corn salsa, fingerlings, pickled red onion, hot honey). The pizza was not good. The duck tasted old and dry. The fried chicken was pretty pathetic as well. They were also dry, and probably should have called them chicken nuggets instead, because that's pretty much how small the portion was. The hot honey and the corn salad were the only things that were good about that dish.Maybe their regular menu is better than their RW options? I'm not sure but I will not be coming a second time to find out.
2018-07-30,3,I love a good brunch so I decided to give this place a try. While the food included in the brunch deal was really good (zeppoles, a small plate, and an entree), I'm afraid I can't say the same for the service. I would be more understanding if the restaurant was busy, but that was not the case. Each time one of us asked our server for a drink, it took incredibly long which became frustrating because it was very clear there was no sense of urgency. I gave three stars because I did enjoy my food and mimosas. The mimosas seemed to have the perfect champagne to OJ ratio. However, I'm not sure if I will be back.
2018-07-19,1,Nah. Mediocre at best. wine selection is good. The people are Hoboken basics so be weary. Good selection is lacking . Go only for the wine
2018-07-17,4,Came here on a Friday night, it wasn't too busy. I wanted to sit outside, but the outside area in the back is not a good atmosphere so I asked to move. I wasn't getting food so I just sat at the bar.The bartender provided great suggestions on wine and allowed me to taste before I committed to a glass. I also tried a cheese plate, a sampling of three cheeses and it came with honey, jam and toasted bread. Overall, a good experience. I would come back again, in hopes of sitting outside (in the front).
2018-07-16,5,Love their weekend brunch special can't believe I haven't been here sooner! Brunch price included a appetizer, meal and a brunch drink. Everything was delicious. Would definitely return!
2018-06-23,4,Trust the servers here - their wine recommendations are great. The place is small and can get noisy on a busy evening, but it has the right energy. Servers appeared upbeat and happy, food was great, and I wouldn't have been able to pick a better Rose had I tried - I totally trusted their recommendations on the food and drinks. The moz and bruschetta were pretty good.
2018-06-16,4,Cozy hip wine bar.  Unique wine selection and menu.  Love the small plates tapas style.  Try the Octopus and the meatballs.  You won't be disappointed.
2018-06-11,2,Surprised we were so disappointed! I've been to Bin 14 a few years ago and remember the food being exceptional. we went this past weekend and the food was average with some dishes being borderline bad. We ordered the tuna tartare, date bacon gorgonzola, and steak tartare bruschetta. The tuna tartare was super bland. The date bacon was the best one and it was pretty good. The steak tartare was downright inedible - it tasted like ground beef right out of the packet that was dried out. I'm not a picky eater but i could not eat this one. The only thing I liked was the small plates - beet dish. Maybe it was just refreshing after my bad steak tartare bruschetta? The ambiance was nice though if that's super important to you. Surprised we were this disappointed, wont be back anytime soon.
2018-05-30,1,I am not sure what went wrong with the restaurant, but had a terrible experience last October. I decided to give it another shot yesterday and nothing improved. I have been in Hoboken for 7 years, and Bin 14 was my regular place to bring friends and family. However, something had changed, from swanky wine bar the place turned into neighborhood watering hole. The bartenders are rude, dismissive and have no knowledge about the wine. The food portions are a 1/3 the size. Not to mention the music, listening to "slap the bitches" in a wine bar is really not my thing.
2018-05-29,4,I went to Bin 14 with my dad while he was in town because he was really looking to try out a wine bar type of experience. We made a reservation and were seated immediately on arrival. Staff was generally nice and attentive. We ordered a couple of bottles of wine, which I thought were reasonably priced (mostly in the $40-60 range). We also ordered 5-6 dishes to share including the mix cheese and cured meat plate, tuna tartare bruschetta, roasted carrots, prosciutto pizza, burrata, and pecorino fries. Everything was generally very delicious(especially the fries!) but we found the portions to be extremely small, especially for the $33 mix cheese and cured meat plate. You get 3 of each but on tiny quantities! Also the tuna bruschetta was only 1 piece which would have been nice to know when ordering since we were a table of three people sharing everything.  For those who care, the bill came out to almost $200 + tip. Very pricey but I would generally recommend Bin 14 if you are in the area. I also noticed that they have a garden in the back which might be very nice for summer and/or larger groups.
2018-05-27,3,I went here today for bottomless brunch with two other people and the waitress we had was absolutely horrible. I work in the restaurant business so I understand when things get busy but there was absolutely no need for the trash service we received from Sarai C. Out of the hour we were there, she came to our table twice-- first, to take our order and then second to drop off the check. She never checked on our table and never even made eye contact the entire time we were there. The food runners and bussers were outstanding and took care of us, instead of Sarai, whom I have no idea how she is still in the customer service industry. We asked a food runner if we could have a last pitcher of the bottomless mimosas before our time limit was up. Sarai, our waitress, then dropped off the check 15 min later and we were still waiting for our last pitcher only to be told that our waitress already closed our tab. We kindly asked her if we could have our last pitcher and she said (with the worst attitude I might add) that our time limit was up and we explained to her that we ordered the pitcher before she dropped the check off and she said "your time is up I can't bring you another one, I have another party coming in and I gave you perfect service this entire time so if I give you another one you have to drink it fast" (when she in fact did not lol. Long story short, I have never received such absolute TRASH SERVICE FROM SARAI C. in my entire life. If you come here request someone else because she is absolutely horrible.
2018-05-27,1,Food is great, service is brutal. Would rather go to Sorrelina on 10th with slightly worse food and 10000x better wait and bar staff.
2018-05-16,1,Keeping it simple and to the point--We ordered our food and wine, and received them pretty quickly. Then someone in our 3-person party noticed a mouse scurry under the bar. Then I saw about 3 more mice scurry past us. The workers in the kitchen and the patrons around us noticed our frantic behavior, and then they also pointed out another mouse some distance away. We decided we were completely grossed out and wanted to leave immediately, so the waiter (eventually) called the manager over. The manager told us they noticed ONE mouse made its way into the restaurant after they left the kitchen door open during the thunderstorm, which had occurred a few hours before. I told her I had seen at least 3 mice myself in the span of about 3 minutes, and the manager shrugged her shoulders. I told her we just wanted the check (honestly, I didn't think she would even charge us for the food--we had only eaten about one bite from each plate we ordered). She charged us and we ran out of there!!! Bin 14 claims to be an "upscale wine bar," but the customer service and sanitation/hygiene beg to differ. We're all repulsed and completely disgusted. Highly do NOT recommend.
2018-05-13,1,Went to Bin 14 today for Mother's Day, the waiter Dave was welcoming and his service was great. However the hostess manager Stephanie was beyond rude and had no customer service skills. She's not even presentable, her appearance alone has no justification. I would never go again!!!!
2018-05-07,1,This place on Washington St. in Hoboken has mediocre food and really bad service.  There's not much to like here.
2018-04-25,5,My favorite spot in hoboken. I love coming here on Tuesdays for their all you can eat mussels. They have 4 flavors- marinara, spicy marinara, garlic and oil, and licorice. Yes you read that right - licorice! Of course if you absolutely have licorice, do not get this sauce. However I am not a true fan of licorice and I loved it. The sauce has a cream base and is rich in flavor. I also love their pizzas - kale pizza is great. I would come here with friends and go tapas style. Their menu does change by season. The ambience here is perfect for date night, very intimate. Although you will leave here paying around 50-60 for your meal (per person), it is well worth it.
2018-04-21,1,Very bad service - not paying attention - there is no dessert menu !!!! And even no coffee ! The food is pretty ok (mozzarella was very good) but nothing exceptional.
2018-04-15,5,I took my mom and my mom's friend here when they visited and we thought it was the cutest place. Love the atmosphere here! Wine was delicious and bartender was so helpful picking out wine! Eggplant and pizza was so yummy! Definitely a great place for a date night or parents in town! I'll be back!
2018-03-25,5,I've lived around the corner for 3 years and have heard great things but have yet to try! Finally this past weekend, my roommate and I went for brunch and we were not disappointed. We sat at the bar and the bartender was extremely knowledgeable/helpful with both the wine selection and food. She even offered to sub a few things for us to make sure we were fully satisfied with our food selections which we greatly appreciated. The brunch was great, wine was great; as was the service. We will definitely be coming back
2018-03-11,3,The baby kale salad with lemon maple vinaigrette was good but wasn't worth $10. Maybe something I'll try to make at home. I got the fig and prosciutto personal pizza and that was very good. I liked that they put a lot of fig pieces on the pizza. It's a cute place that I wouldn't mind going to for a light dinner.
2018-03-02,5,Delicious! Perfect for date night... only thing is main entrees are pretty small. They have a huge selection of wine and they'll give you a taste before ordering a glass which is awesome. Love the kale salad and the steak entree!
2018-02-13,3,Went to Bin 14 last night for a family birthday. Great selection of small plates and very interesting wine list. As others have mentioned, the prices are on the high side for Hoboken, but the food is fairly high quality.The biggest disappointment was the pumpkin tortellini. It was on the entree menu, but the portion when the plate came out was just three small tortellini! The other entrees we had (beef and sausage bolognese and rabbit pot pie) weren't huge, but their portions were still filling. The pumpkin tortellini should be on the small plates menu, don't order it expecting a meal!
2018-02-09,5,Probably one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken. Probably why it's the hardest to get in on the weekends. Great service & wine list! Awesome brunch on the weekend as well! Make a rezzy in advance or eat at the bar!
2018-02-08,5,The restaurant is small and reservations are recommended. The wait staff was very friendly and knowledgable. The food is excellent and served tapas style with wine pairings.
2018-01-31,4,Tried at Hudson Restaurants Week 2018. $15.99 with a salad and a pizza. Both very delicious. Easy environment and good service.
2018-01-24,1,I am a regular here so i was caught off guard by my recent experience at the new bottomless brunch.  I typically have a great meal and service at Bin 14, but last Sunday, that was not the case. I came with 3 other friends for brunch and we all placed our appetizer order.  3 of us had the kale salad, and one friend ordered fries.  When our waiter arrived 20 minutes later with our food, he did not even stop to hear my friend say that he gave her a kale salad, when she had ordered fries.  He did not come back to check up on us for another 15 minutes, so she decided to eat the salad anyway because she was so hungry at that point.  When he came back, he mistakenly brought an order of fries for our table since he thought that's what we wanted- which was not the case.  Throughout the rest of our meal, we repeatedly had to ask 3-4 times for water.  It got to the point where another waiter noticed that our waiter was not being attentive and would come around and fill our waters and ask if we needed more drinks.Lastly, the most memorable part of brunch was having to ask for our bottomless drinks 3-4 times each time we wanted another alcoholic beverage.  My friend asked for another bloody mary THREE (3) times about an hour into the brunch.  On the third time she asked our waiter, instead of him saying anything back to her, he immediately ran to check the time clock to see if we had any time left during our 90 minute bottomless brunch limit.  He came back and told us this would be our last round, when she had asked for the drink 20 minutes beforehand and he never came back.  He blamed it on the bartenders for not making it, when we knew he just was not being attentive after he messed up our food orders, never gave us water refills, or taking 4 times to get our drinks.I was embarrassed to bring my out of town friends here after giving them rave reviews on Bin 14. I will not be coming back for brunch again to avoid having the same careless, snobby waiter.
2018-01-23,1,The kind of experience that makes you never want to come back.Came in for brunch on a Sunday at 1230. We had called earlier to see if a reservation would be needed and were told no. The hostess told us that there would be a 45 minute to an hour wait. Ok no problem, since we were waiting for the rest of our party. The hostess took my name and number and said she would call when our table was ready. I went back in 40 minutes later, and asked just for an update. She laughed at me and said "it hasn't even been an hour yet!" Ok, well do you have an update on the wait time? Now with an attitude, "It's going to be like 45 minutes, but we'll call you sir."I never did get that call. Luckily just next door is the Madison, with a very nice brunch buffet and lovely staff.
2018-01-04,4,Amazing food and great service! Our server provided excellent wine recommendations and assisted with the menu. Really enjoyed the meatballs and octopus small plates - delicious.One minor thing which could really elevate Bin 14 to a top quality wine bar - the person greeting people at the door and the girl behind the bar were both wearing sweatshirts which, despite the lovely decor, pricey menu and well dressed waiters, really brought down the feel of the place. When dining at a wine bar I for a special occasion (we went for my birthday) I would prefer the person who greets me not to be in sweats. Other than that - great place!
2017-12-25,5,My suggestion is to make a reservation... we sat at the bar here... the service was great and the atmosphere was very romantic and soothing. Everything I ate here was AMAZING!!! The meatballs were tender and flavorful. The short rib was tender and perfect!! The margaritas were good and strong. The salad had the most delicious dressing and fresh ingredients!! Well worth every penny. I definitely recommend this place to everyone.
2017-12-10,2,Went for an after dinner drink with my wife and our two drinks ended up costing almost as much as our dinner. Sat at the bar and was greeted by a very standoffish bartender. After we asked to try two different wines that were unavailable we asked what other similar wines would they suggest. Gave us a taste of one and we decided to get two glasses. Received the check and it was $36!!!!The staff is crude and they think they are high and mighty. The one thing that isn't making this review a one star is the fact that the ambience and bar has a nice cozy feeling.
2017-12-10,2,An average brunch. Not worth $29pp. Subpar service, but I think that's probably just because our server hated his life - not a true reflection on the restaurant.
2017-12-03,2,Shocked that a short time limit was put on our table when we arrived. The thought of a relaxing meal with friends went down the drain.  Management was unapologetic as we were told that it is standard operating procedure.  Better that they should learn how to manage their restaurant professionally.  If you only want a quick meal, it's not a bad spot, but it was difficult for us to enjoy it there with the shot clock on.
2017-11-30,4,Good value Italian food. I got the Prosciutto Fig Cheese Pizza which I demolished. Also, this place serves gluten free food options which is always good to know- in case you are dining with folks with dietary restrictions. I liked that they had a good selection of wines too and that the place had a cute modern rustic vibe.
2017-11-29,2,We tried this place with a small group of wine loving people and were quite disappointed. While the wines are OK they were nothing special, no happy hour or so and we paid 80$ for 4 wines and gladly left. Service was friendly but this is not NYC and a big rip off.
2017-10-15,4,Food was really good. Ordered margarita pizza and octopus. Our server William went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable. He has an excellent knowledge about wines and their food pairing. Would recommend this place to anyone in. Heartbeat..
2017-10-15,1,You know, I would love to write a better review, but it's really hard when you waited for 2 hours and never get your food. My boyfriend and I wanted to try this place because of all the great things we've heard...needless to say, it didn't meet either of our expectations. To make everyone's lives easier we told our waiter everything we wanted to order in one shoot. Great. If only he remembered to put it in...we got our wine within minutes, but it became apparent to us 30 min in that he forgot because no cheese platter ever came. So we asked him and he was like "oh yeah yeah it's coming"...15 min later..nothing. "Oh sorry they are slammed back there.." It's cheese!!! Finally 10 min later, a small plate of cheese comes out. Literally wtf. At this point we are an hour and 15 min later in. And I'm getting antsy. We finish our wine and ask for the check..doesn't even phase the guy. That took a solid 10 min as well!! He didn't charge us for our food but come on! Due to better options in the area, bin 14 is officially nixed in our book.
2017-10-01,5,The bartenders here are really helpful and informative.  Food is also great (i recommend the meatballs and their pasta dishes).  Great for happy hour or full on dinner.
2017-09-30,4,Great selection - a little bit on the pricier side but so worth it. From appetizers to the wine selection, no matter the company, the place is a go-to. Even a great place for the roseÃÄ lovers! Hell ya!
2017-09-26,4,I've gone to this bar at least 5 times. Each time I have the same experience: great service, awesome environment and music soundtrack, and good/solid food.  The food isn't excellent which is why I can't give them 5/5. However, in all other categories this place is stellar.  Love the whole vibe of this place.  great spot for a date night.  Can get a crowded on weekends.  I prefer the bar.  They have a heated back deck for winter too!
2017-09-19,4,I dont know how I've lived in the area for so long and only came to find out about this place about 4 months ago!! A cute little place in hoboken with an awesome selection in wine and great little dishes to accompany. The Cavatelli dish was my favorite mostly because I am a pasta freak!! Their pizzas are also amazing. Pricing is decent. Great place
2017-09-12,4,Not sure why this place only has 3+ stars. My homemade sausage pasta was just what the hangover Dr ordered. Waiter could not have been nicer or more accommodating with our evening. My friend's 3 year old was made to feel special and I got just the right wine! A perfect close to Sunday.
2017-09-09,4,Came here for my 27th birthday celebration. And was very satisfied! Many small plates to pick from and a wide variety. Service was excellent and always made sure we had enough wine to go around the table. Truffle fries are a must try as the crab bruschetta. I got the Cuban pizza as an entree and it was delicious light and crispy crust and flavorful toppings. Prices are a bit steep for portion size, but it is hoboken.Make a reservation it's a very small dining area we were a table of 8 and I was able to make a reservation one week prior!
2017-09-05,5,AMAZING WINE LIST! Although it changes very often they have a wine for everyone! I love that this is small plates with many options to choose from! I highly recommend the meat and cheese boards! They are so good and decently priced. The meat balls are also very good! Love going when it's nice out and sitting outside! Bartenders and waiters are very nice and love when you try wines that you've never had before!
2017-09-03,3,Was underwhelmed by the food - we ordered waffles which felt stale / not warm and fluffy. Service was average.
2017-08-28,5,Came on here today for lunch with an old friend and we were offered some complimentary tasting of white wines we were greeted by the sweetest little girl it was so funny we just fell in love with her turns out it was the managers daughter that just was dying to work as a greeterShe set us with our menus and told us what we should order that tasted really good I wanted to take a home with meThe owner took our order and we had the fig prosciutto flatbread A rock shrimp polenta. I did think that the polenta was good and so was the train but there was just way too much sauce and I just couldn't handle how much thought was on it so the manager came over noticed that I wasn't really digging it so we axed me if I would like something different and I hated to be a pain but he ended up bringing me the best fried calamari I've probably ever had in my entire life so if you come to this restaurant if I get the calamari
2017-08-28,5,Really great date night spot, great wine selection, food and environment.
2017-08-27,4,If you're looking for a good gluten-free option for pizza or pasta this is the place to visit in Hoboken, if you don't want to deal with the rush I suggest going around 6 on the weekend and before 6 on a weekday, they have a great wine bar list, I would suggest start off with the truffle honey mozzarella but if you're looking to avoid dairy try the bruschetta option, really enjoyed the tuna tartare, jalapenÃÉo scallions and capers bruschetta ($5), then I ordered the Pork belly, pickled grapes,celery root, apples and mojo as a small plate ($10)For pizza we ordered the gluten free margherita pie which is a personal pan which comes with fresh margherita mozzarella and basil pie ($11) but you can also go for a classic pie which comes with cherry tomatoes which is quite exquisite one of the best pies I've had in town especially for gluten free crust which tastes homemade.For entree in ordered the sausage & beef bolognese, tomato, ricotta, garlic and cavatelli (gluten-free) ($17)It's cash or card and you can sit outside in front of the restaurant or if you want privacy you can sit in the back. Enjoy!
2017-08-25,3,So...as someone who considered this her go to comfort food wine and food bar--this place has changed considerably. Not sure if it's new management, but the biggest difference is the service. As religious bar sitters, the bar staff are much more less attentive and more preoccupied by pretty girls at the bar and socializing than actual service....I feel like I want to tip less secondary to poor bartender service but I know I'm jipping the hard working other staff--at any rate--the service and food at this point do not deliver....will need to frequent its competition, Grand Vin more often!
2017-08-17,1,Came in at 10 pm on a Thursday with my wife to check out the late night menu and have a glass of wine.  Took at least 5 minutes for the bartender to pull himself away from a conversation with his friends on the other side of the bar to even acknowledge us and the other people sitting near us. As we waited, I couldn't even have a conversation with my wife as rap music blasted.  Don't get me wrong, I like rap, but when you go to a wine bar you expect a little bit of ambiance. At the very least, turn it down!We ordered some food (pizza and bruschetta). Both were overpriced and underwhelming. I ordered a glass of wine.  The bartender poured a tasting drop, set the bottle down and walked away for 5 minutes.  I wasn't sure what to do! Should I pour myself a healthy glass of wine or was I supposed to wait forever for the bartender to return to pour it? I waited. Forever. The bar itself was a mess. We won't be returning.
2017-08-17,5,Went there based on a recommendation.  Our server, Jack, was on spot with food and wine recommendations.  Nice ambiance... Will return..
2017-08-14,4,Always good in my book.  Love the wine and appreciate the staff letting me try it.  Food is good, more specials wouldBe cool.  found my favorite bottle ever and little secret, you can buy bottles on the spot for a bit cheaper if they are to go.
2017-08-06,1,The one star is based purely on service. I have been coming here since the restaurant opened. Sad to see that the many amazing bartenders and staff are now gone. I really hadn't visited here much in the past year as I was pregnant. So disappointed with the horrible service. So many times the bartenders would offer us suggestions and engage with us. Not the case anymore even when ordering $18/glass wine. Bartender continued to chat with other clients she knew and picked up her cell phone multiple times. Never came to check back until my glass was empty and credit card was on the bar.
2017-08-01,5,I absolutely adore this place.  The wait staff is always super pleasant and helpful.  I have a gluten allergy and feel like there are too many options.  If you havent tried the Calamari, please do so.  Two thumbs up!
2017-07-25,5,This is a must if your looking for educated wait staff on food and wine pairings! The tapas  menu  is perfect and a wonderful atmosphere ! Definitely will be back! I hate repeating back to resturant since there are so many in hoboken
2017-07-16,3,If you're seeking some fast Italian that's affordable, Bin 14 satisfies just that. Space is a bit small, but you're able to get seated quick than most other restaurants in the area. My co-worker ordered a plate of pasta while I opted for the grilled octopus. Octopus was actually cooked tender enough without tasting too raw or too grilled. To be quite frank, our appetizer (calamari) did not impress me. However, when ravenous and eager, all you care about is quelling the hunger pains, and Bin 14 provides everything you need with much expedience so you can't complain immensely after a long week of work.
2017-06-26,2,Over-over priced!  Very limited menu, small portions, and big prices.  I always leave hungry and broke.  Ambience is great and very different from other places in town so will always be busy.  The two items I used to love about the place that got rid of - Greek white wine and crab bruschetta.  I only go with people who are dead set on going like a friend who lived out of town and was visiting.
2017-06-06,5,4.5 stars!  My husband and I came in here for my birthday and decided to sample a bunch of small plates:Truffle honey mozzarella:  Really delicious combo.  We both really enjoyed this dish.  It's advertised as "warm", however, which is kind of a stretch.Roasted tomato/basil bruschetta:  Very simple bruschetta, but very tasty.  Definitely want to try some of their other bruschettas!Meatballs:  Pretty forgettable.  Meatballs were a little dry and sauce was kind of bland.Pork belly:  Good.  The real star on the plate was (for me, anyway) the deliciously tender zucchini and the green sauce (chimichurri, I think?).  YUM.Tuna tacos:  Excellent.  The tuna was so tender.  Not chewy or steak-like at all.  The jalapenÃÉo crema was zesty and packed a punch with spice.  Very good dish.The wine was also very unique and tasty and service was excellent (thanks for the recommendations, Matt!).  We will be back!
2017-06-03,4,Wonderful atmosphere. Great food, good service and plenty of options for diet restrictions.
2017-05-29,2,Wouldn't go back to this place. Food was over priced and did not taste good. Size was also very small for the money. Service was not great either. Would definitely go to Stingray over this place which is just a few more blocks down on Washington Street.
2017-05-19,3,used to love it. changed in the past 2 years. everything got just a bit blander.
2017-05-04,3,I REALLY want to like this place at the 5 star level, but I just cant. I've been here 4 or 5 times and each time I have an ok experience with average to a tad frustrating service, avg to great food, and decent ambiance. There are very few wine bar options in Hoboken so I am bound to continue coming back here. Food: They have a great variety of casual to upper scale small plates and pizza's. As far as the homemade mozz goes, thats one of the more unique plates and I can heartily recommend the truffle honey version, but not the Extra virgin olive oil, fleur de sel, cracked pepper. I've been served it cold and rock hard before - if that happens send it back because when it actually arrives warm, its delish. Interested in the pizza? Go for the Prosciutto di Parma, fig, ricotta NOT the Bacon & apple, blue, ricotta, fresnos, basil, hot hone one (WAY too much going on there and very odd tasting, and a weird choice to have on the menu in the spring). Other highlights: Baby octopus app, Tuna tartare bruschetta. NOT the Truffle fries (always soggy). Drink: Great selection of wine (obvi) and a fun fact - they do 2 oz pours in case you want to try a wine or just want a tiny glass. Service: They tend to forget about the folks in the front outdoor seating, inside gets great service, and back patio decent service. Ambiance: The outdoor back patio when its cool out with heated lamps is a cool vibe out there, though depending on your location to the heat lamps it could be chilly. The inside gets loud. Other thoughts: There is usually a wait especially in the evenings. The challenge is there is no place to wait inside and gets very awkward very quickly. If they up the service, do a bit better with food quality and flavor, and have a more reasonable place to wait, it would be a 4/5 for sure.
2017-04-28,5,Went with a large group and had an excellent experience.  The staff is friendly, accommodating and very, very knowledgeable about wine.  The food menu is fantastic.  Either splitting small plates among a group, or getting individual entrees, they are fairly priced, well portioned, and most importantly delicious.  But the big ticket here is the wine.  Their selection is fantastic, ranging from $10/glass to north of $40, they have something for all appetites and budgets.  Not one person in our group of over ten had a complaint.
2017-04-06,3,Bin 14 is pretty good. Great wine selection and tasty tapas. A bit overpriced and the tables are kind of on top of each other. Would go back for a drink but probably not for dinner or lunch.
2017-04-02,5,This review is for brunch only. And yes I certainly took advantage of the Bloody Mary bar. That hit the spot.Not only was the food great, but the staff at Bin 14 pays a lot of attention to presentation as well. My eggs benedict was perfect. It was served on top of a nice slice of dry bread that sopped up all of the yolk. The potatoes on the side matched the eggs extremely well.The whole experience was very relaxing, partly because of the food and partly because the restaurant was not too crowded. I certainly wouldn't mind coming here for brunch again.
2017-04-02,5,Had dinner Friday night. Our waiter was great, very helpful and personable, definitely made the night better. Food was amazing as always and tried some of the waiters suggestions and was not disappointed.
2017-04-01,5,God, I love it here! Excellent wine selection and the food compliments it wonderfully. The waitstaff is very knowledgeable and always recommends the perfect glass of wine. Also, the truffle fries are everything!
2017-03-24,5,Visited Bin14 on a Saturday night around 9pm for dinner with a friend. We were able to be seated without a reservation right away in the back patio with the cover and heaters. It was a great environment and very comfortable. We started ordering things off the menu one by one just to share and take our time and relax. We ordered 3 cheeses, we wish we asked for more bread because they give you honey and jam on the side which went so well with the cheeses and bread. We also ate the prosciutto and fig pizza. Very good. Our server was great with offering wine choices and letting us try some before we made a decision. I am looking forward to going back!
2017-03-13,4,The highlighted of this meal was the gluten free calamari. They have a dedicated Fryer for gluten free and use chickpea flower. The waitress was very friendly in making sure we knew what was gluten-free. A lot of the menu items are gluten free. I also liked the sausage crostini as an appetizer. The shrimp with polenta was also a highlight. The pizzas were OK compared to the appetizers. Very nice and warm atmosphere. I would come back to have some appetizers and wine.
2017-03-12,4,Came here for the GF pizza and was delighted to find out their fried calamari is gluten free too! I haven't had fried calamari in years!
2017-03-01,3,I would probably give this restaurant 3 and a half stars ... but the app doesn't allow it.  My girlfriends and I started out with wine and apps!  We ordered calamari, meatballs and the mussels! All were good -- the calamari and mussels were my favorite. For an entree I ordered the chicken ravioli with the shiitake mushrooms--- this was good and had a little kick to it. All in all the food was good but not stellar. Fun night out with the girls or your significant other :)
2017-02-20,2,After much hype, I stopped in bin14 for some tapas tonight. Cool atmosphere + concept. As far as the dishes (not so much):Truffle Mozz- very tough, kinda gross, only gave 3 mini toasts for the two of usBurrata mushroom pizza- canned mushrooms not fresh, definitely not burrata. TASTELESSRicotta ravioli with pork red sauce- no taste. Kinda tasted like chemicalsTruffle fries- theses were the only good things but they're pretty hard to fuck up so...We tried to put the sauce on the pizza and it didn't help. Still tasteless. Two thumbs down on dinner. Maybe brunch will be better?
2017-02-18,1,The food is great. That said, we were turned off by our server from the start. She was unfriendly and unhelpful. After being seated late we were asked to expedite or meal around an hour and a half in because "the kitchen was closing." Then minutes later the hostess came by to tell us they had another reservation at the table and they wanted to leave. We continued finishing our drinks as we had bought a bottle of wine then the bouncer came to make the same request. This was all within two hours of getting to our table. I cannot stress how unprofessional this experience was. I've never left a 0% tip, but hey, there's a first time for everything.Edit: the waitress asked us what happened because of her tip and told us it was" the restaurant's policy"... I would say the fact that the hostess said the kitchen was closing when it wasn't didn't help
2017-01-29,1,Abnormally Small portions for the price!  Spend over $300 and leave VERY hungry.  All mediocre food....
2017-01-28,1,We made a reservation for 7:30 to celebrate our best friends pregnancy. We have been to this restaurant many times before, but likely will never be back. The entire meal we felt extremely rushed. Our waitress was at times rude, and only offered the most expensive wines and meals as suggestions for what to order. Promptly and abruptly, at 9:15pm, while we still had food and wine at the table, we were told we had to leave because another party had reservations at 9:30. They also did this to a table two down from us. It was an awful experience and NOT how you treat customers who are spending their hard earned money (our check was just about $300 for 4 people), at your restaurant AND chose your restaurant out of the many others in Hoboken that are just as good to celebrate a very special event. We weren't even able to order desert, which we had planned on, because we were being kicked out.  These people need to remember why they are in business and start treating their customers with more respect.
2017-01-21,3,I have been here twice before but both were a few years ago. I came here once again a few weeks ago for dinner with my good friend.It was 8 pm and the small place was very busy, all the tables and most bar seats were taken and there were plenty of people trying to get a seat. My friend, who got there a few minutes before I did, got us two seats by the bar which were the only ones available at the time. Unfortunately those seats were very close to the door, which kept being opened and closed by the same people trying to get a seat at the restaurant, so I ended keeping my coat on during the meal.Since we were sitting by the bar, one of the bartenders was the ones to take our drink order. He then proceeded to not pay attention to us for a while when we tried to get his, or any of the other bartenders', attention in order to place a food order. I got a glass of cava while my friend ordered dry white wine, both of which came to us quickly and tasted pretty good. Due to my self imposed dietary limitations (being picky and ,more recently, not eating meat) there were not many options. I was considering getting a personal pizza and a salad but ended ordering a kale, ricotta, garlic and lemon zest pizza and truffle fries with romano and black pepper. My friend ordered the Ravioli with chicken, shiitake, caramelized onion, ricotta and braised tomato sauce. The pizza was really good although it would have not filled me up on its own and my friend enjoyed her ravioli as well. However, the truffle fries seemed overdone and were truly an overkill for me, should have definitely gone with the salad. I do no recall the music but it wasn't too loud which allowed my friend and I to have an intimate conversation.Although it has been a few years since my original visits, my impression of Bin 14 is the same: the dishes are either hit or miss (the pizzas are definitely a hit) but either way are overpriced for both the size and the quality of the food. However, since Hoboken lacks in the cocktail/wine bar scene, I do believe I will be back but with low expectations.
2017-01-19,5,Nice wine bar with a good variety of wine. Good service and nice music. A nice addition to hoboken area! Come by for a glass or a bottle.
2017-01-08,1,I have been to Bin 14 multiple times and the food has always been mediocre. I decided to go today with a friend during off hours as I had my young son with me. I was chastised by the manager, Robert, when my son ran several times from the front to the back of the restaurant. I had already paid the bill and was planning to leave before Robert decided to make me look like a terrible mother. In short, if you have young children, and you like good food, Bin 14 is not a place you  would want to go. This was my last visit to Bin 14.
2017-01-02,4,I came here while visiting some locals who are big fans of this spot. It was a Tuesday night and the earliest time we could reserve a table was at 8:30! The place doesn't have a lot of seating, especially for parties larger than 4 people. The setting is very intimate, with candles at every table and low lighting. A great date spot! The staff was friendly enough and everything was clean. It had a social vibe to it, but we were still easily able to talk to each other with the buzz around us.If you come here, prepare to spend quite a bit of money. The waitress explained that it's a 'tapas style restaurant' so you can order lots of small plates for the table. And they are indeed small. For me this is no problem, especially being there that late at night. However, for big eaters like my husband, that's an expensive problem to have. Everything tastes great, though! We had the charcuterie platter, which has very modestly sized pieces of 3 cheeses and 3 meats. An order of meatballs, bruschetta, and bottomless mussels filled 3 people happily. The bottomless mussels (available Tuesdays) were fantastic and each bowl came with a plate of topped fries as well. I could've eaten them until morning but the offer ends at 10pm.  Being a wine bar, it has large selection of different wines. We tried the Pentimento wine and I fell in love. We tasted a few varieties for our second bottle but ended up deciding to stick with our first choice again because it was so good. The bottle was moderately priced for the quality. Like I said, this wine was the best I've tasted yet in my short life.
2016-12-30,5,Best wine spot in Hoboken. The staff is super knowledgeable. If you interact with them, you are guaranteed to learn something. I enjoy their wine flights and food menu. The icing on the cake is that they dont have any TVs! Makes for good conversation on date nights.
2016-12-20,1,Bin14 was recommended by a few friends that live in Hoboken. I had a date meeting someone for the first time. The experience started off fine, the place was nice but very small. My reservation was early 5:30 as I wasn't sure if we were going to eat or just have drinks. We ordered drinks and 3 appetizers to share, food was good, portions were small though. Now for the problem. After finishing our food my date declined a second glass ofnwine and within minutes the bill was delivered to the table without me even asking. We spoke about another 10 minutes as I finished my drink and then the staff came by to remind us they had other reservations coming in a few minutes. I asked why we were being rushed out and they said it normal to notify parties like this. In short both my date and I were quite shocked by the way we were treated being asked to leave. I will never go back to this place again, even!
2016-12-06,3,I guess this place is good for Hoboken but honestly I think it's overrated.  Been here a few times and I am never wowed just always thinking its good for Hoboken... on am mission to find some spots in this town.
2016-12-04,5,Okay after today def 5 star Paul is wonderful the perfect host! The food came out in a timely manner and we were a party of 14, our drinks were all delivered    correctly and service never lacked. If you like wine this is the place for you...thank you for the lovely time and the bday girl, my cousins fiance who is very picky loved it! Thank you again for a wonderful night
2016-11-23,4,Good food and service. Atmosphere is nice. Been here a few times and consistently good. Value for money could be better.
2016-11-12,3,Food here was good and service was friendly.  The burrata had a nice kick to it and was really good.  The lamb tacos and meatballs were also good, but the caesar salad was a bit over-dressed and the risotto was just ok. Cocktails were good too.
2016-10-28,5,This place is one of the best in town. The wine selection is impressive and the food is delectable!
2016-10-27,5,Visiting the area and googled wine bars and Bin 14 caught our eye. Tired from a red-eye flight and not able to check into our hotel room yet, this place was a refreshing "lay over"! A very nice selection of vino and some interesting spirits. We didn't eat only because we weren't hungry, but the menu looked very tempting! Stu was a great host and quite efficient interacting with the patrons and tending to his tasks.
2016-10-19,4,Very good service always having new wines to sample. My favorite of the wines is a white wine called Rainstorm. Also a must have is the mozzarella with honey and the meatballs. So good!
2016-09-22,2,We booked a reservation for 13 for a casual birthday dinner and were given instructions to arrive early since there are 3 seating's per night and would have to relinquish the table by 9:30, but told it would likely be free ahead of time. A few days before, the restaurant called to tell us they were not sure who took the reservation, but they absolutely could not accommodate that many people. Thankfully our party size had dwindled to 10 which they could handle. They wanted to make sure everything was going to run perfectly. This was music to our ears since we were looking for a better group experience than gourmet food, something we typically shoot for. We understand serving a large party can be tricky, but with a little attention, it can run smoothly.8 of 10 arrived by by 7:25, two were slightly delayed, but the table was not yet ready. Ten minutes later they led us in to the back to 6 seats. Someone had removed a 4 top and sat customers at it. This took several minutes of us standing in the middle of the kitchen flow before anyone could figure it out and then remove the 4 customers.Our server let us know that we were fortunate to arrive just short of what would be a packed section for him, but he had our attention now. Maybe it was harmless and poorly phrased, but something about the way he said it just sat oddly with several of us. Bin 14 serves small plates meant for sharing, but after being here several times, IMHO I did not think they could pull that off with more than 6 people so I advised everyone to order an app and entree.  Initially, I also suggested everyone order wine by the glass to take advantage of their wide offerings rather than me choosing and limiting the group to bottles. Both of these things seemed to annoy our server. We ended up ordering a few bottles for the table anyway since we had an easy going crowd and I was thankful that we did.The appetizers came and the food runners could not get it right, they brought the dishes to whomever was near and asked if it was theirs and then went around the table until they found a match. This forced all of us to help figure it out, the loud restaurant only made this game worse. After trying this for most dishes and still having one she couldn't place, I asked the runner to confer with our server to help organize things, but she didn't. The apps tasted fine. nothing spectacular. Stand outs would be a smokey octopus dish, though many of the potatoes in the paired fingerling salad were undercooked and a somewhat bland burrata dish  that should have been served closer to room temp and with some crostini. We asked for some and got cold, thick bruschetta pieces (leftover?).I wanted to see a wine list and consult someone to pair some red wine with our final courses, but as the night progressed we hardly saw our server. Additionally, I wanted to ask them to clear the app plates and bring us fresh silverware, but before I could do either our entrees were being served. As soon as I saw the runner pulling the same nonsense as before, I implored her to confer with the server because I was not happy about their inability to distribute food, but again, no luck. The entrees were just OK. One dish of diver scallops had 2 diver and one bay sized scallop, who the hell plates that and deems it passable? A short rib dish was a bit bland and there were several large pieces of Gorgonzola that were cold and threw off the balance of the grits. The crab risotto tasted ok, was texturally off. Usually good food is overshadowed by bad service, but I tend to overlook service flaws as long as the food meets acceptable standards which unfortunately, it did not.I know the standard is 15% for basic service, 20% for superior, but being close to the industry and given the types of places I frequent, I default to 20-25%. Since we were a large party 18% was included and frankly I feel robbed.
2016-09-19,4,We were here on a Sunday night, and this place was pretty busy. We had great service (wait staff was very knowledgeable about the wine and made awesome recommendations). Wine was great - selection was awesome, and I really enjoy being able to sample new styles with the 2 oz pours. We also had the cheese sampler and were very impressed, delish! The main reason that I'm not giving this place 5 stars is due to the food. Not very good... definitely not with the price. We were pretty disappointed. We'd definitely come back for wine and cheese, but not to eat dinner.
2016-09-14,1,Below is the email I wrote to Bin 14 themselves, before deciding to take my disappointment to Yelp.  All I wanted in return was a simple apology, and assurance that my experience at Bin 14 this time around was nothing more than one bad night.  Apparently, management doesn't care enough to reach out - and it clearly shows in the form of the downward spiral this place has been in over the past few months.  Due to length restrictions, I've removed a few paragraphs: My Girlfriend had made reservations for a party of four, as we had friends visiting who had never been to Hoboken.  We decided to choose Bin 14, as we've always enjoyed coming here together or with a group.  Upon arriving to the restaurant, slightly early for our reservation, we were greeted by the hostess who begun the conversation by saying, "Just a heads up, we are going to be really slow tonight, so I wouldn't expect to have your drink and food orders taken for about 15-20 minutes after your seated".  Not a very pleasing start to our evening, but we sat down nonetheless.  The server finally arrived at our table to take our drink orders.  We ordered 2 bottles of wine and a martini. He never once mentioned his name, and had a hard time helping us choose our wine.  There are only 4 bottles of Rose - all we wanted to know was whether the options available were sweet or dry - apparently they were 'basically all the same' according to our server.  After about 5 minutes, the server brought our bottles of wine, returned to the bar for the martini, then brought that to our table as well.  At that point, we told him we were ready to put our appetizers in, knowing that we may not see him for a while after that.  He responded by saying "Ok no problem....be right back".  We weren't sure what wasn't clear about wanting to put our order in, but he then disappeared for another 5-10 minutes. At this point we were seated for about 30+ minutes before the server returned to take our food order.  Already frustrated with the inattentiveness, we couldn't have imagined it would get worse.  It did.. We decided to place our orders for both our appetizers and Entree's so we weren't left waiting come that time.  We put our order in for about 5 appetizers, then followed with our entrees.  My girlfriend was met with rude criticism of her order because it was "so boring".  The server asked, "Why would you come here and order that? There's so many other things on the menu!".  The first time he said it, we played along and asked his recommendation.  Not only did we not once receive a recommendation from him, but he repeatedly insulted my girlfriend for her choice.  Finally, as he finished pouring a glass of wine for my friends girlfriend, he must have realized enough was enough.  He concluded the interaction by attempting to place the wine bottle back on the table, but instead slamming it onto a water glass which resulted in the glass breaking.The server returns a minute later with the glass, proceeds to ask how we're doing and how our food was.  He then pours a glass of red wine for my friend, and while attempting to place the bottle of red wine on the table, hits my friends girlfriends wine glass, spilling the wine all over the table and myself.  As you can imagine, at this point, I was thoroughly disgusted. We received our entrees, and they were all very good.  No complaints regarding our food or wine choices for the evening.  Our server was walking towards our table from the back of the restaurant, and without fail drops and shatters a handful of plates literally within one foot of our table.  At this point we couldn't even believe what was happening.  It almost felt as though we were on hidden camera to capture our reactions.  We had finally had enough, as my girlfriend and I were getting tired of apologizing to our friends for the experience.  We asked for the bill, paid for our evening, and left.  We talked about our server the rest of the night, and even into the next day because of how unsettling the entire scenario was.  I'll conclude by saying I hope this was a one-off night, and not something we can expect to happen on a regular basis.  We do enjoy coming to your restaurant, but are still undecided if we'll ever be back.  We attempted to show friends what both Hoboken and Bin 14 have to offer, and were extremely disappointed with how this evening played out.  I can guarantee that in the case that we do return, we will immediately ask for a new server if we receive the same gentleman.  Not even a simple reply, to apologize for the disastrous evening we just went through?  Get your act together Bin...
2016-09-07,1,This place used to be one of my favorite spots in Hoboken, I'm not sure what happened. We showed up on a Thursday evening and oddly enough the place was fairly empty, so we sat down at the bar and waited a few minutes for the bartender to acknowledge us. I asked if we could have a samples of the Grenache blend, it was terrible. Super warm (75 degree warm), in fact so warm, I really couldn't get a great wine taste. Nasty. My boyfriend tried a Portuguese white wine, it tasted cheap and too sweet. He drank it. I ended up ordering a South American white. Decent at best. Bartender wasn't the most friendly bartender I have ever met. She was nice to the 'regulars', a bit indifferent towards us. Anyway, we started with the truffle honey warm mozzarella, I was expecting delicious homemade mozzarella. This was far from homemade. It tasted like mozzarella that had been sitting in a grocery store for days. Not great. The truffle honey barely had any truffle taste and the whole dish was bland and old. I then ordered crispy calamari, hot peppers, capers & lemon. The dish was terrible. 100% sure the calamari was completely frozen and was over fried. It was disgusting. My boyfriend ordered the falafel. I tried a piece, it had no taste at all and again, tasted like it was frozen and re-heated. I told the bartender I wasn't going to eat the calamari and she asked if I wanted something instead. I thought my boyfriend was going to smack me because he was go over the restaurant that all he wanted to do was leave. I have no idea why, but I really wanted to give this place another shot, so I said, sure I will have the jerk octopus instead. GROSS. I just wanted one dish to taste good. Nope. Nothing. The octopus was mushy and nasty. I've gotten octopus many times in my life and this was the worst tasting octopus I have ever had. I ate it because I felt bad giving back yet another dish. All and all, terrible food and I thought it was me, but my boyfriend expressed how extremely disappointed he was as well.
2016-08-31,4,Such a great date place! I love the small plates and the ambiance. They are mainly a wine bar but now have a liquor license to make great cocktails too! Great for me considering I'm not a big wine drinker. Can be a little pricey but worth it!
2016-08-19,2,Food quality poor - very rubbery mozzarella and the calamari was cooked in old oil. The meatballs were more like bread balls and the tomato sauce was bitter and unpleasant. Service was also very slow.
2016-08-11,3,The noise level is horrendous.  This really takes away from the experience.  No dessert!  That also takes away from the dining.  The food was fine and so was the service.  Nothing special though.  Will have to try again at another time.
2016-07-29,5,Great food and service. We came here for my birthday and ate/drank everything. I recommend the bruchettas, calamari, wings, mozzarella with honey and truffle oil, pizza with fig, and short ribs. The manhattans are good as well as the vast wine selection. Also Joel who took care of us have great recommendations and service.
2016-07-29,2,Good wine, food is very very small portions but done well. The service and hostess were horrific. The hostess had the nerve to tell me I had a time limit on my table which I not only made reservations for, but arrived on time/early if I "wanted a seat inside", on a 95 degree, 90% humidity day. No other couple that was seated, while I was standing there (three other parties), were told this. Have been there before and enjoyed it, but I don't think I will ever return. Our waiter told us to literally get up and leave, I guess not realizing we'll never be back. I actually regret tipping well. Incredibly disappointing.
2016-07-18,1,My most recent experience here is my last - the waitress spilled an entire container of ketchup on me.  When I complained about being covered in ketchup the individual who claimed to be the Manager said well if she said she was sorry that's ok.  Really?  Sure no problem I will pay the dry cleaning bill for my new shirt thanks a lot.  Even at Stout in the city when a waitress spilled a drink that barely touched my friend they reimbursed for the dry cleaning bill with her receipt and gave us a free round of drinks that night.  Unreal...
2016-07-16,2,I went here recently and the ambience looked great from the outside which grabbed my attention. The pros are cute wine bar and great wine options. Now the cons were we had pretty off service. From the moment we walked in, the hostess just stared at us without saying a word. We felt very un welcomed and confused at if we were even "allowed" to sit at a table inside. After sitting at the bar, we felt as though we were bothering the staff to order and ask questions about the menu. It was disappointing because this place seems to have a lot of potential. Maybe it was a bad night for them but it definitely put a bad taste in my mouth and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
2016-07-12,5,I have been traveling weekly to New Jersey for work.  It took me 3 months to explore outside my hotel in Weehawken.  It took a little time after that to find this perfect little gem that offers real and amazing food for us gluten free patrons.  My waitress was sophisticated and laid back, knowledgable about the gluten free options.  I ate calamari, unbelievably delicious made with chickpea flour.  It had the right balance of crispy, salty and spice.  I had pizza with prosciutto and several cheeses, something I asked the waitress to surprise me with.  GF crust was perfect, the pizza had a creamy sweet and salty mix.  Soooo good.  Then last, with little room left in my stomach, I devoured the braised bison with a creamy corn accompaniment and BBQ sauce.  Tasted down home, was simple and delicious.  I highly recommend, especially for those used to eating substandard GF excuses for food.  I lived a dream and will be back!
2016-07-09,4,The food and wine are great. So many wine choices and the bartenders are always willing to let you taste before committing to a glass. I would have given it a 5 but the last time we were there the service was off. We had a very long wait before being asked about ordering. It was not busy and we were not the only customers waiting, that was disappointing. I'm ok with a 10 minute wait but 20-30 minutes to be asked was not really acceptable. If someone had acknowledged us and let us know they were behind, that would have been nice. Again it wasn't busy so I'm not sure what the hold up was.
2016-05-23,5,Bin does a lot right (and has a few areas for improvement) but I'm giving them 5 stars because of their amazing service.  I've been coming here since they opened.  I think I was literally at Bin on it's opening night.   I've probably been here 100 times since. I've never ever had a bad experience with a single member of the wait staff.  The wait staff, bartenders, hostesses - well and the manager is about as nice, friendly and helpful as it gets.  I recently knew I had to get on and write a review when I was coming in for brunch 2 Saturdays ago.  I called to ask about a reservation, since a member of our party was older and cannot stand for prolonged periods of time.  I explained that I knew they didn't take reservations, but if there is anything they can do, it would really make our day.  The manager reserved a table for us.  And, he went a step further and made sure it was the front booth so she didn't have  to walk far to the back.  In a town where brunch "reservations" don't really exist, I thought it was amazing that the manager was able to accommodate us so graciously.  The food is great - and keeps getting better.  They change the menu frequently and have some of the most interesting brunch options in Hoboken.  I love their 2 eggs and a meatball and the chorizo toast.   They also have a bloody mary bar - which leaves a little room for improvement (needs more peppers, pickled veggies - and less powdered spices).  Some more unique options might be nice too - a thai bloody mary?  Their pizzas are terrific - and come in both regular and whole wheat crust (I think they have a gluten free option too?).  They have great meatballs, usually some nice homemade pastas and always changing veggie sides.  My only criticism is they do dinner in "seatings," which means you can only eat during one of two seating times.  Therefore, I've only EVER had dinner at the bar - and only when I've come early enough to get a seat (before 6).    We typically go there for late afternoon snacks and wine on the weekends - which suits us just fine. Anthony's other restaurant (Anthony David's) went through a major overhaul a couple of years ago - and came out exponentially better from what was already a great  restaurant.  I hope Anthony Pino keeps the hits coming with his new joint uptown.  I'm very excited for the opening.
2016-05-20,1,Disorganized and confused! The hostess needs training for sure. Has no idea how to get guests settled in. A little unprofessional and it will leave you with a bit of a bad taste in the mouth. Can't comment on the food/wine as we didn't bother to stay.
2016-05-16,4,I really enjoy going here.  I have been here more than a dozen times and I cannot say I had a bad meal here or had any service issues.  Wine list is impressive. Bartenders are the best and, if undecided, help steer you to something you like.   Big shout out to the bartender during lunch.  He is the best!I love the food, especially anything with chickpeas and octopus.  The charcuterie is excellent.  Good choices, even for the less adventurous .  Service is warm and mostly proficient.  The bartenders are even better and really know how to take care of you.  I really recommend sitting at the bar for dinner if you are in a small group.  Totally recommend this place without reservation.  Speaking of reservations, they will try to accommodate you without reservations, but I suggest calling ahead to make sure.  It gets crowded, but is worth the crowd and wait.
2016-05-14,5,Had a lovely time here last night. We showed up around 9pm without a reservation. Place was packed but they had outside seating (which we prefer anyway).We shared a few appetizers Rock Shrimp, Meatballs and A Cous Cous Salad. All delicious. For our entrees we split the Short Ribs and Burratta Pizza. Both delicious the short ribs fell off the bone and were super tender and Burratta Pizza was very creamy and tasty. Last but not least our server was the highlight of the evening. He was knowledgeable about the menus and wine and he had an awesome sense of humor. Will definitely be back!
2016-05-13,5,Ate here for the first time last night with a non gluten free girlfriend of mine.  We both split the lobster/avocado & tomato basil bruschetta (made on their GF pizza crust), fried calamari (GF) and we each had a pizza (1 GF and 1 non GF).  ALL of it was AMAZING.  By far the best GF pizza crust I've ever had. I ordered the prosciutto, fig & ricotta pizza which was delicious.Our waitress has Celiac disease so she knew exactly what was safe to eat and what was not.  Almost everything on the menu could be modified to fit someone with a gluten allergy/intolerance.I will definitely be back!
2016-05-03,5,Came here for a light dinner and drinks after work with my co-workers. We're huge fans of Bin and love to come here after work, and we really wanted to try the new menu. I had the Dead Kennedy cocktail which was sweet but not overly sweet. I really enjoyed it. It had vodka, ginger beer, cherry liqueur and maraschino in it. We started out with the Jerk Octopus, which was probably the best octopus dish I've ever had. The Kale & Cauliflower salad was delicious... and this is coming from probably the only person in the world who doesn't like kale. My co-workers had the chicken wings and the chorizo pizza and raved about both while I had the cauliflower pizza all to myself and it was delicious, with ricotta, black truffles and Taleggio. I could eat that pizza every day for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
2016-04-27,4,Came here a few weeks ago with a friend on a beautiful Sunday evening. We were able to sit outside and it felt so good to have nice weather. We ordered what we thought were $7 glasses of wine (really$18) and two brochettes; the tuna tartar and wild mushroom. I ended up ordering the prosciutto di parma, fig pizza but subbing the ricotta for burrata cheese. My friend wanted the scallops in the worst way and we both enjoyed our meals. Besides a little misunderstanding over how much our one glass of wine was, it was a pretty good meal. Would I come here just for the wine bar, no, but I would come back for the food and enjoy my (cheaper) bottle at home.
2016-04-17,5,Bin 14 hits all the right notes, unpretentious attitude, cool vibe yet selective in terms of food and drinks. The drink menu is extensive and the menu choices are wide in range making it the right place to go to when seeking great food and service. Overall amazing!!
2016-04-17,2,Visited late Saturday night for drinks and dinner. The hostess informed us that the wait for the table would be 30 minutes. We told her that we will be at the bar while we wait. She took our name down and promised to grab us when the table was ready. After 40 minutes, I approached her and she acted completely surprised, claiming I had told her we don't need the table anymore. I reminded her that if that was the case, why would she have taken my name down. She didn't have a good answer, and told me she'll get back to me in 5 minutes. After waiting for another 10 minutes without any apology or an update that she needed more time, we just settled the  bar tab and took our business next door. The only saving grace. The bartender was excellent and made the 50 minutes we were at the bar a pleasant experience.Extremely disappointed by the incompetence of the hostess. That's your only job and if you can't get that right, you are a liability for the establishment. Everyone makes mistakes, but the lack of follow-up and no sincere apology was what really bothered me.
2016-04-17,1,I really did not like this place.  Everything we ordered was overcooked and bland.  Very crowded, bad service.  Will not return.
2016-04-16,5,Staff , food , ambience is on point . Love coming in here . This is one of my favorite spots in town .
2016-04-10,5,Amazing food, wine and great atmosphere. I brought my parents here when they came to visit and I was very pleased. The food is absolutely delicious and the service is great. We were outside on the back patio which is heated and covered and overall nicer I thought then being inside, it was also a little more quiet.  Can't wait to go back!
2016-04-10,5,Secret little gem in Hoboken for brunch. Not crowded, food is excellent and a nice Bloody Mary.
2016-03-17,1,I was there last week for dinner with my girlfriend. We both had severe food poisoning for the next few days. The service itself was terrible as well, as we sat at the bar and could hear the staffs conversation. I will definitely not be recommending Bin 14 as an option to go to in Hoboken.
2016-02-28,4,The food was good, service great, and the ambience great. Nice wine bar in Hoboken with a NYC vibe. The grilled octopus appetizer is a must. Wasn't a big fan of the chicken sausage entree, was a bit too saucy for my liking and the sausage was broken up into little pieces the size of rice grains. However the ribs over grits were excellent. I would go back.
2016-02-22,4,A little sad I wasn't able to drink when I went, but the food was great. The fried calamari was my favorite - it came with red and green peppers which added a spicy kick to it. Would definitely come back to try the other small plates, drinks, and brunch!
2016-02-19,4,My husband and I both really enjoy Bin 14. We have been at least 4 times and the food has been delicious every time. We had one poor experience with the service, but found that was just a bad day and isn't true of all the staff. Bin 14 feels like an authentic wine bar which is refreshing. It's quaint with dim lighting and exposed brick. The waiters seem to know their menu well and are open to let you taste one or two wines to help pick the perfect pairing. The portions are on the smaller side so plan to order a few things in order to feel satisfied. My husband and I usually order 3 -4 menu items for dinner. The last time we got the meatballs (delicious, flavorful), the old school pizza (tasty, would order again) and the Bison short ribs for our main entree which were a home-run. If you're looking for a romantic or simply quality dinner I would recommend Bin 14. It's not great for parties of more than 4 and there is typically a wait during prime evenings Thurs - Sun. The bar is a prime spot to grab a glass of wine, but be prepared to wait. Bin 14 is our favorite wine bar in Hoboken and recommend it to visitors.
2016-02-17,4,Came here on presidents day on a Monday for lunch. It was pretty empty but then again it was snowing out at the time. I got  the calamari which was pretty good. Nice and crispy unlike some other places that make it a little soft and soggy. It doesn't come with marinara but they'll usually ask you if you want some or you can ask them yourselfI also got the chicken slab bacon cheddar grinder. It was amazing and the portion was perfect for lunch
2016-02-08,5,One of the best wine bars in area.. Staff was extremely helpful and offered excellent suggestions (very knowledgeable). Manager was a an absolute doll. Great afterwork spot ...but....Cozy and chill atmosphere either for a date or group of friends that are into fabulous wine, great service.  The Food was pretty delish as well. A must try spot!
2016-02-06,3,This was our second time here and it was nothing like the first. Everything we had loved on the menu from our first time in October was unavailable tonight - from the bottle of Malbec we requested to the meatballs and various other small plates - it was a bit of a let down to come uptown and not be able to order what we had been craving (from our first time!). We ended up ordering several rounds of small plates - meats, cheeses, and more, to an entire bottle of wine. Once we had finished our bottle, we got an additional glass to sit and enjoy the evening. We had come with a 6 pm reservation. In the middle of this last glass of wine, our waitress came and made us feel extremely unwelcome and asked us to hurry up because the 7:45 reservation had arrived. I could potentially understand this request from the waitress had we come and ordered one thing to split - but due to the fact that we had made a reservation and ordered quite a bit and at this point had paid the bill and tipped generously... I had expected to at least be able to enjoy my meal/wine in the time that I saw fit. Being rushed out the door was not appreciated and unfortunately I have to say moving forward - I will be taking my wine & tapas nights elsewhere. I am giving a 3 because the food we did order was very good, but the combination of missing items on the menu and rushed service was not ideal.
2016-02-02,1,Great ambiance but my last visit to the restaurant was unpleasant and needless to say I will not be coming back. My parents were in town for lunch so my boyfriend and I took them here, we were seated in the backyard which had warm heating lamps. I ordered the "salad" with beets and Milanese chicken which only had about 3 pieces of arugula on it - I would not consider this to be a salad, it was a $17 dish for one piece of chicken and a few beets. My boyfriends salmon benedict came out cold, and my stepmom's burger came out overdone. We waited for our waitress to come over to let her know about our issues with our meals, but she never came back over, and since we were starving we just ate it anyway. Annoyed, we waited for our check - but we had to actually ask the bus boy to bring it over because our waitress never came back over. I found this experience to be very upsetting because I used to enjoy this restaurant as a Hoboken local.
2016-01-26,5,Food is always great, excellent staff, and terrific atmosphere - absolutely one of our favorite go-to places in Hoboken.
2016-01-24,4,Yep. It's a bit pricey. But only because I keep eating and eating and ordering more glasses of wine. Really like the meatballs which never seem to leave the menu. Just saddle up at this wine bar, order some cheese and small plates and look at the credit card receipt later. Seriously, Hoboken needs more places like this.
2016-01-22,1,Snow blizzard coming typically enjoy the place but because they were closing made us wait outside for our uber.   Way to treat your customers.   I won't be coming back.
2016-01-13,5,Went there and tried out their brand new brunch menu. Anthony, the owner, kindly sent over complimentary apps that were out of this world. The salmon was super fresh, and the extensive drink menu made it hard to choose out of all the delicious boozy options. I got the 2 eggs and a meatball and the meatball was the best I've had outside of my families homemade ones. Definitely a must for brunch!
2016-01-12,5,Great restaurant and great service. The food is always amazing and has never let me down. Great meatballs and even better burrata. Excellent and friendly staff can help you pick out a great wine! Awesome place!
2016-01-11,4,I really like the atmosphere at Bin 14.  You don't have to be dressed to the nines, but it has an upscale vibe, which is augmented by the varied wine list.  I've enjoyed many of the wines there, and the food is pretty good as well.  The back patio is excellent (really nice on summer days), but the inside also is a nice setting for a date night.  Given Hoboken's lack of upscale dining choices, Bin 14 definitely stands out.
2016-01-03,4,Bin 14 is a great choice for happy hour or dinner. The food and wine are both delicious. The staff is knowledgable and friendly.
2015-12-12,3,I went here for lunch on Friday there was only like 3 tables with people the service was a it slow since it wasn't packed. Food was good the margarita pizza it's great meatballs are HUGE the lobster bruschetta was my FAV.
2015-12-08,3,Meh the food was just alright for the price. Also ordered the Fall apple cider vodka which they ran out of shortly after my first drink, not cool on a busy Sat night. I thought the food would've been more creative and flavorful. Likes were the procuitto pizza and cheese plate. Dislikes rock shrimp, definitely wasn't even close to rock shrimp. Service was ok, couldn't tell who my server was and one was very obnoxious.
2015-12-05,1,Absolutely RUDE service! For an upscale restaurant, I expect to be treated in only a polite and professional manner. Instead, I experienced an unapologetic, combative, disrespectful, and obnoxious wait staff last night. I have been to Bin 14 before and was impressed with both the food and service, however, my experience last night was the complete opposite and left me feeling embarrassed and unwanted at this establishment. I will not be returning. Upon entering the restaurant in the evening of Friday, 12/4/15, my boyfriend found two empty seats at the bar. He was roughly informed by the bartender (female with brunette hair and dark glasses) that he could not sit there. When he asked if the bar seats were reserved, she responded with a "no" and then tried to argue with him that people were waiting to sit there. The seats were empty and no one was standing next to them, so he sat down. Like she had said, the seats were not reserved?! She tried to argue with him again, but a second bartender (female with brunette hair and a tattoo on her hand) intervened and informed him he could sit. I arrived 2 minutes later and took the empty seat next to him. When explaining the rudeness he encountered to me, the second bartender, whom had obviously eavesdropped on our discussion, interrupted our conversation and explained they wanted to seat a couple at the bar whom had been waiting for 45 minutes for their reservation. So we can't take first-come, first-serve bar seats because the restaurant incorrectly booked a reservation?  Ok, great. That would have been fine, but then this bartender proceeded to snicker to the first bartender about us and what just transpired...right in front of us! Trying to prevent this from ruining our evening, we ordered 1 glass of wine each - the O.P.P. Pinot Noir from Oregon - at $12/glass. We left $25 on the counter, blatantly giving a $1 tip. We walked out and thought this bad experience was over, but no. As we hit the sidewalk, the very polite bouncer chased us outside and informed us we had not settled our bar tab. We were then asked to go back inside and speak with a gentleman in a red plaid shirt next to the hostess stand (manager)? Ok...so we went back inside and asked the gentleman what the problem was. He told us we were short on our tab. He requested our receipt from the bartender, looked at it, and told us our bill was $25.72 with tax. We were chased down because we failed to leave $0.72 for tax?? We explained we left $25 ($24 for the two glasses of wine at $12 each and a $1 tip) and then he said to "forget about it" and walked away from us. No apologies for failing to look at the tab/question his staff before having us chased down for $0.72 nor for his bartender's behavior, whom obviously was annoyed we didn't leave a tip? We then threw $1 on the bar and left.  I have never been treated so disrespectfully at an establishment where the upmost professionalism is expected. If Anthony Pino expects to continue to be successful in an increasingly affluent town with his upscale restaurants, he needs to re-evaluate his staff to ensure they understand how to treat the type of diners who frequent these places.  Honestly, you would probably interact with more courteous employees at McDonald's.
2015-12-03,5,So good! Seasonal menus, small bites to share- fresh ingredients and also wine bar- what more can you ask for! The service is always great, although they can get pretty booked up on the weekends! Intimate and cozy- love dining in the back courtyard in the summer months. This is a great date night spot or take your parents kind of restaurant. So glad this place exists.
2015-11-28,5,Great atmosphere, wine, and food with friendly bartenders. I had the gluten free pizza with 2 glasses of wine. Best gf pizza ever. Joel recommended a great cab.  I'm a happy girl. :)
2015-11-24,4,I have been trying to get a reservation here for some time and yesterday I finally did get one. Once I arrived I quickly realized why it is so hard to get a table, it is a small place. That aside I soon had one of the greatest dining experiences ever. I was looking over the wine list and our waiter asked what I liked and then said I will bring over a few for you to try. We must have sampled 8 different wines! Each in my party of four ended up drinking two or three tremendous wines. The waiter even told us that based on their pours, just order by the glass and not the bottle the price typically works out the same. Great advice, we all ordered what we liked. Now the food. Yes small plates so be ready for it. Even the entrees are on the smaller side. Given that, we ordered a cheese plate and a few cured meats, lobster bruschetta, fig and prosciutto pizza, and we split a few orders of meatballs and the bolognese. All the time drinking great wine that we liked because we tasted them before we ordered them. Three hours later, put a fork in us, we were done.tripadvisor.com/ShowUser...
2015-11-22,5,There were a few fruitFlys in the back of restaurant but I'll go back- good music. Had burger - fries were awesome. Nicest wine bar in Hoboken.
2015-11-13,1,Two words - food poisoning.Never write reviews, but couldn't let it go especially considering the night my husband and I had after eating there. Even worse than that was that my 10 month old son who had a tiny taste of our food was also violently ill for a week after.In short - don't eat here if you don't want to spend your night on the toilet.
2015-11-11,5,I love everything about this place!  The wine selection is diverse, the food is OUTSTANDING (the quinoa salad and octopus dish are two favorites) and the service is friendly and helpful.  I live in downtown Hoboken and rarely make it up past 8th Street, but I would certainly make the trek to return to Bin 14 any time!!
2015-10-27,4,One of my favorite dishes in all of Hoboken is the truffle pizza here. I always want to order two. Fun place to come on a Friday or Saturday, as it's usually bustling (in a good way). A nice complement to Anthony David's.
2015-10-21,5,Joel knows his wine.  Great service and a wonderful time.
2015-10-16,1,We sat in cold outside when they had 2 tables empty in patio/garden area.  I was told that I would be kept in mind for 9.30pm.  Why promise when you can't live up to it. Rather just say you don't have space.  We still have a bill of 250$ for 4 ppl they could have adjusted inside. We had a birthday boy and we felt so bad about sitting in this cold.  I love their food and wine but did not expect this treatment. Did not even get great service from waitress. Pizza was slightly uncooked. I believe the current staff quality has deteriorated. The Bouncer opened the door for pretty ladies but when men entered, he didn't even offer to open. Lol its not a club where you would expect such treatment. Again,  food is great. They should work on service especially in this cold.
2015-09-30,5,The wine list is extensive so even a picky customer can find something they like. The food is outstanding. My friend and I shared the lobster bruschetta and it was amazing. Get two because they are bite size. We also had the fig, ricotta and prosciutto pizza and it too was delicious
2015-09-30,5,I can't rave enough about Bin 14. The food is incredible. The wine is amazing. The servers are incredibly knowledgeable and even though they are extremely busy, give excellent service. The small plates (olives!) and personal sized gourmet pizzas are my favorite. The flatware, the ambiance, it's all just so well done. Make a reservation on Open Table well in advance - especially if you're trying for a Friday or Saturday night. Perfect for dates, the tables are so intimate. Also great for girlfriends, order a bottle or wine flight and plenty of plates. I can't wait to return! Keep up the amazing work!
2015-09-17,4,4 stars only because there is one waitress who consistently disappoints me every time I visit this restaurant. The food is awesome and I love the wine but every time I get stuck with this same waitress and she has a sour puss on her face, it ruins the experience. She once told my guests and I that our wine choice would taste earthy and "like dirt". Bin 14 people find a new waitress because I love your food but not her. Want the extra star? Make the sacrifice.
2015-09-13,5,This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Hoboken. We usually always get a table right away because we go early (before 7pm) however if you want to have a later dinner, definitely make a reservation. Usually they will say that they have a table but they need it back by a certain time, which is fine with me. The food is incredible and one of the main reasons why I tried this place in the first place was their gluten free options, and now I can't stay away. I've had the GF Margherita pizza and the GF Sausage Broccolini pizza, both amazing and the perfect size. They also have, in my opinion, the best truffle fries in Hoboken. They can do many gluten free substitutions so you can enjoy almost anything on the menu. The service is great and they are very knowledgable about their wine. This is the restaurant that I take family and friends who are visiting because I feel that the classy and modern, yet rustic atmosphere truly embodies what Hoboken is all about. Everyone I bring here is always impressed. I've never had a bad experience here and highly recommend it!
2015-09-13,4,Amazing brunch and good happy hour spot. They don't take brunch reservations but if you go early enough it's fine. Husband loves the Bloody Mary station they set up. It can get crowded for dinner as well but worth the wait for their food and wine selection. It's loud inside but that's to be expected. Outdoor patio or outside in the front are ideal spots
2015-09-02,4,I went into this place for lunch. There was not much of a crowd on the entire street in Hoboken.  I was waited on by the manager ,  and he gave me great service. I felt treated like royalty and  really appreciated for being a customer there. Besides that, the food and wine are outstanding. The prices are good and the place is spotless. I highly recommend this place as I have visited many eating venues in Hoboken and this place is first rate!
2015-08-14,5,Delicious food with reasonable serving sizes.  Great wine offerings!!!  I love that they offer a 2oz serving of wine. One of our favorites.
2015-08-06,5,I love everything about this place, especially sitting outside. They also have a back room, I just don't like the fans back there.The cheese plate is deliciously paired with honey and a cranberry sauce. I use the honey to dip my truffle fries in as well (try that if you never have, it's to die for and really sweetens up the flavor). The tomato and basil bruschetta is juicy. The tomatoes come as grapes tomatoes so it's a lot in one bite. I once had the ravioli and I'm depressed they took them off the menu. If you ever see them it's a must try! The red wine OPP is sold there, recommend it when you are eating the meat from there!
2015-08-05,4,Nice restaurant uptown in Hoboken! Food is really good, as well as a nice selection of beers! I had some issues with the service there the first couple of times, but the last few times I've been here it was really nice! Reviewing my original score, since my issue was really the service!
2015-07-28,5,Bin 14 has never failed me. My boyfriend and I had a 7:45 reservation on a Friday (I recommend making a reservation!!) and he was having trouble finding parking, so as a result I was left to drink solo at the table for a good half hour. We felt horrible, but the waiter was extremely patient. Food has always been delicious and drinks are great too. Last week we ordered a glass of wine, flight of 3 wines for me, meat and cheese plate, 2 sides and an entree for about $70, which wasn't too bad. Really don't have anything bad to say about this place.
2015-07-25,1,Had an extremely poor experience. Arrived at 12:30 on a Saturday night to share a bottle of wine with friends (as their website says they are open until 2am). We sat and immediately we're told to hurry and order food because the kitchen was closing. After expressing we didn't want food we ordered wine and beer. As the waiter was pouring our wine he told us they were closing soon but to take our time. At 1:10am the waiter stood behind the bar and said "WE ARE CLOSING EVERYONE LEAVE" in a very abrasive tone. I have never seen such a thing happen. If they have a closing time of 1am they should update their website and the bouncer should not let people in at 12:30. It was an extremely poor experience and will make sure to never go back.
2015-07-25,5,Love love love this place! Make a reservation! As it can be difficult to get a table if you just walk in. The servers are very knowledgable in wine and the small plates are delicious! Recommend getting the truffle fries and any of the mozzarella offering are great!  Come here for snacks and great wine.
2015-07-19,5,Excellent food and service on a consistent basis. Bin 14 is one of our favorite restaurants. Great wine selection as well as several beers and select cocktail specials.  As for the food it's always fresh and prepared to perfection. Big fav of the lobster bruschetta, the pizza, shrimp with grits and the meatballs. The servers are always knowledgable and courteous.
2015-07-15,3,Food is great but the prices / portion sizes are ridiculous. Ordered a scallops / risotto entree - I got 2 scallops and a couple of spoonfuls of risotto - for $18. It was barely more than an appetizer.
2015-07-08,2,Good food good wine and AWFUL clientele... Been a year since my last visit and the House Wives Wannabes of NJ found it with their forever21 clothes matching their leathered skin...  Too loud for civil conversations Waitstaff is friendly
2015-06-28,3,I've been here for dinner a handful of times. If you don't have a reservation on busy dinner days you're more than likely not going to be able to get a table unless you want to try and wait for space to open up in the back "patio."  It's not a bad date spot if you're a wine fan and enjoy places where it's not incredibly loud. In terms of the food it's very hot or miss. Some of the items I've had there were delicious but others are simply bland. Considering the pricing for this place having some bland plates is the main reason I'm rating it a 3 stars. I would return for the atmosphere / plates I enjoyed, but the inconsistency in favors is not ok.
2015-06-10,4,Great food. Great wine. The atmosphere of the restaurant is perfect - soft, romantic, but social. I really enjoyed my night here.
2015-06-04,4,Wine and food are delicious. The staff is knowledgeable about wine and always makes a good recommendation.   I love going there but have felt bored by the food selection because it hasn't changed much over the past 6 months.
2015-05-27,4,My boyfriend and I took advantage of the lovely spring weather on Saturday (05/23) and headed over to Bin 14 for a nice brunch. We were initially put off by the empty host table when we entered, and there were only two people sitting inside. While we stood at the entrance, hemming and hawing, a waiter came up to us and bluntly asked, "What's up folks? Are we staying or are we going?" That settled it. We stayed.Since it was rather warm indoors, we decided to sit and eat outside. I wasn't in the mood for anything special to drink and just ordered water, while my boyfriend ordered coffee. Our waiter (the same guy who asked us if we were staying or not) apologetically explained that the coffee they had available was made much earlier in the morning. He then asked if my boyfriend still wanted it. I know this sounds rude and I'm doing a poor job articulating his mannerisms, but there was something about the guy's personality that made his rough honesty really funny and appealing. He simply told it like it was. My boyfriend, amused, told him it was no problem and to go with it. Lo and behold, our waiter came around with a huge steaming cup of piping hot coffee, freshly brewed. (!) Note that we didn't ask him to brew a fresh pot, he simply did it because he felt bad about my boyfriend drinking stale coffee. That was mighty nice of him.For brunch delights, I ordered the smoked salmon plate, which came with two small pieces of focaccia toast, capers, red onions, halved grape tomatoes, arugula, and whipped cream cheese on the side. I'm not a fan of red onion, so I went ahead and made my own version of smoked salmon on toast, using the capers sparingly (I learned the hard way not to pile capers on top of anything). Everything was delicious. The salmon was a perfect consistency, and wasn't chewy or hard, and there were no unpleasant spiny bits. The only downside was that I didn't have enough toast, and I had to ask another server for some more.My boyfriend ordered the chorizo omelet with peppers, onions, and cheddar cheese, and he liked it. He especially liked the sauteed potatoes that were served alongside it; he thought they were cooked well and added a nice savory touch to the meal.Towards the end of our meal, a random bird (pigeon? starling?) flew overhead and shat directly onto the corner of our table, and also on my purse. Fortunately, my purse was zipped closed and nothing inside got messed up, although we spent the better part of five minutes mopping up the green goo. A female server stopped by to check in on us and was properly horrified at what happened, apologizing profusely, even though we assured her it wasn't her fault. She then told us a funny story about how she and a friend went out for dinner and her friend's mudslide got knocked over by a gust of wind and fell directly into her open purse. All things considered, I was lucky.Despite this little incident, I was mostly pleased with my experience here, and I would like to come here again at some point to try some of their small plates.
2015-05-12,4,The food is so delicious and the wine selection is outstanding.  Price is astronomical for a tiny place that has little deÃÅcor and a boring ambience.  Choose your friends wisely for this place.  Or perhaps a lunch date?
2015-04-23,4,I love Bin 14. The pizzas are great, and the small plates are actually pretty big depending on which ones you order. The menu is constantly changing based on the season, and there's always something new to try. I haven't had a single thing that I didn't like here yet.They also have a very nice selection of dessert wine/port!
2015-04-05,4,After a year hiatus, I've returned to my gluten-free, vegan ways (yes, I know, I'm just "SOO crazy!"). My best friend - being the doll that he is - scoured the area to find something that would suit both our tastes for Easter Brunch. I was shocked when he suggested Bin 14. For a wine bar, I was pretty impressed with the GF/vegan options. Their GF focaccia/crust was off the hook. They not only sub it for pizza, but bruschetta too! We shared the beet salad, tomato bruschetta, cauliflower, broccolini and a mushroom/arugala pizza. All very good.I was disappointed that they didn't have any kind of champagne; just prosecco. The prosecco was not that great either. I know I'm kind of a wine/champagne snob, but I would expect to see better options at a self-proclaimed wine bar. My friend was VERY disappointed that they didn't serve desert...which really is kind of odd. The service was pretty good. Our server was sassy - which I found amusing, although I could see him rubbing some fragile-egoed yuppie the wrong way. Overall decent experience.
2015-03-29,5,Had brunch there today with two girlfriends. Sat outside in back under the heat lamps. AMAZING service from Paul! We ordered a bunch of small plates to share: Lobster bruschetta that tasted like summer in New England. Pizza with prosciutto, fig, and ricotta was heavenly. Great cheese recommendations that came with honey to drizzle, strawberry preserves, and a generous supply of crusty bread. Grilled octopus was perfect. Truffle fries were the right balance of crispy but not hard, soft but not soggy. They don't take brunch reservations on Sundays, but we arrived at the height of brunch, around 1:15, and were immediately seated. Can't wait to go back!
2015-03-19,4,This is certainly one of the best restaurants in Hoboken.Whether coming for lunch or dinner, the menu is great.  I love the grinders for lunch - they are a great and reasonably priced option.  Everything I have ordered here has always been delicious and the service has been consistently good.  We had one waiter who brought us out a taste of another wine he thought we might like based on our other choices, which was wonderful.The ambiance is nice, with the restaurant and deÃÅcor being warm and inviting.The wines on the main menu don't change that often, but we have had good luck trying the wines they have on special that they change around.The only things that are overpriced for what you get are the bruschettas.  They are delicious, but it is tough to justify $6 for one.Definitely worth a visit!
2015-03-08,5,Amazing place, great staff.  The food was superb. Small plates style makes it great for sharing and trying everything from the menu.
2015-03-02,3,Went to Bin 14 on Saturday for a dinner with another couple, had a mixed experience. The good: the food was generally tasty, the wine was great. We had a bunch of dishes, favorites were the truffle  honey mozzarella, salami pizza (they are individual size, thin crust) and the truffle fries. We also tried the meatballs, bolognese pasta, some bruschettas.. everything was tasty, warm and well prepared. Portions were small and it was expensive, but that's what you get. The wine was also great and our server was excellent at recommending wine within our price range and taste level. The bad: I hadn't seen this in reviews, so I wanted to bring attention to it - they do seatings on weekend evenings, apparently. This was mentioned when I confirmed the reservation, but (my fault) I had called back to confirm in a subway station and honestly didn't pay much attention. I also didn't think that an expensive restaurant would be kicking you out after less than two hours at a table, but apparently, that's their policy (again, at least on weekends). We had the 7:45 seating, and when we wanted to order another bottle of wine at 9ish, the server asked if we would really be finishing it before 9:30, because the next reservation arrived then. The server (pleasant enough, great wine knowledge, sort of scarce all night until it was time to kick us out) then lurked around the table until we got up and left. It's not the server's fault, restaurant policy, but I wouldn't eat there again (at least not for dinner at a table) as long as this remains their practice. Our tab was over $250, and we would've stayed and ordered more. It broke up our evening, and if I'm paying that much for a meal, I don't want to be rushed out the door. At any other restaurant, we would've enjoyed another bottle of wine and been able to catch up with our friends. I get that it's a small place, but, to me, part of the idea of nicer restaurants is that you're paying for the ambiance and experience in addition to food/wine. For me, getting pressured to leave after less than two hours kind of ruined that - especially when it's a small plate style meal, so you tend to keep ordering, drinking and chatting. I should've asked the hostess for more details when she confirmed my reservation, and it's their right to make this policy and they do try to communicate it, but it was irritating to me, and I wouldn't recommend going there unless you're sure you're comfortable with it. To be fair, I may go back if I was sitting at the bar or it was a night when time limits weren't enforced - I think it's only a Friday/Saturday thing. But the food, while tasty, isn't good or interesting enough to justify their prices and their seating policy, so I certainly wouldn't make it a destination for a nice dinner out.
2015-02-27,4,The wifey and I hit up this joint for a Friday date night. We grabbed a reservation just in case it got crowded - I would recommend doing so too. I'm sure the only reason it wasn't packed was the sub-zero weather. We started off with a delicious Grilled Octopus - a nice sized tentacle cooked very well just succulent and tender enough for my liking. Since this is a joint all about the small plates, we got quite a few apps. The next goodies were the Lobster Chowder special - the juicy lobster bits were complimented with potatoes, corn and bacon bits; Truffle Fries with a sprinkling of blue cheese; Pork Belly Bruschetta which was admittedly expensive at $4 per piece but it was jam packed with pork belly and good flavor! We also got a delicious Duck Risotto. And since the portions were kind of small and my wife is kind of pregnant - we went and ordered a Pork Belly pizza (yeah, we went pig crazy this evening). We couldn't finish the pizza so we got it in a to go box... however, we bumped into an old neighbor and sadly forgot our to go box...Everything was really top notch - even my cocktail which I do not know the name of but can vaguely say had some cranberry, vodka and another juice in it. It's a good thing that we ordered lots of extras since they don't offer any real dessert. Sorry meat and cheese platter - a dessert menu must have sweets on it!! The tables are little small and close to each other - simultaneously giving the joint a cozy intimate feel and a chance to get elbowed in the head by a server. Also the dishes and drinks are a bit pricey - $13 for a cocktail... NYC prices eh? But I recommend it and we will be coming back... if only to get the rest of the pizza that we left there...
2015-02-16,2,Really, really bad service. The hostess stood at the end of bar by the kitchen the entire time and either whined with the barback/back waiter or flirted with them. A waiter who was interested enough to explain the cheeses to us quickly changed his tone when I asked if we could order from him. A simple 'the bartender would be happy to take your food order" would be pleasant opposed to a laugh to my innocent assumption that he would place our simple cheese order. And when I ask about a wine, don't just pour a taste for me-talk to me about the wine. Please don't act like I'm doing you a favor by being a guest.
2015-02-11,5,I'll say first off, most of the dings on this place are for the service, and that's true.  They have a weird system- they have designated "seating times" (I think like 3 per evening?).  It is hard for me to argue with this method, the place is always fucking packed. DO NOT COME HERE IN A BIG GROUP.  Parties of more than 4, go to Madison next door.  If you don't have a reservation, do not bother waiting for a table,  sit at the bar, you will get served faster, bar tenders are awesome, food comes out faster too.  If there are no seats, yea they shove you in that awkward area, which, maybe they should re think that policy, because it really seems to piss people off (including me). BUT, the food and wine is out of this world. It's expensive for the portions, but it's a wine bar, what do you want? Pork Belly, all of the bruschetta, truffle pizza, lobster (I think?) poppers are favorites, but I've never had anything I didn't love   They have this italian craft beer Fravort, best beer I've ever tasted.  Everyone there knows their stuff. The food and alcohol is an A+. If you're prepared for the weird seating situation, this place is top notch.  If you go in here blind and without a reservation, you're probably going to hate it/get offended.
2015-02-10,4,I have eaten at Bin 14 multiple times and Bin 14 never disappoints.  I always need to start with the burrata.  This time it had maple and Brussels sprout leaves.  Surprisingly it worked, maple wasn't too sweet.  Our table ordered several items to share, which is, in essence the point of Bin.  We had the pretzel dusted calamari and that was really tasty considering I'm not normally a calamari eater.  The special pizza of the evening was delish with salami and burrata.  The cauliflower gratin was actually a real highlight.  Everyone agreed!  Not to be forgotten is the great wine selection.  Looking forward to our next visit.Only slight peeve was our waiter went up by hostess stand, sat on bench and was busy texting for a bit when we were waiting to order.  He finally made it over.  Otherwise all good as always.
2015-02-07,4,Better than I thought it would be. Very small place, so getting a table is a pain.  Although I can see it being a good date spot in a way, especially for late lunch or something like that.
2015-01-25,3,Editing my below review down from 5 to 3 stars.  Went back here last week with my fiance and I would say it was a 2 star experience so averaging both - I'll give it a 3, meaning pretty standard for what it's worth.We sat outside near the street, which was nice, though a bit tight.  Inside is sort of the same.  I have never seen the back patio.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable - though a bit of a wine snob, which one can expect.  However, when he was talking about the Loire region of France where the wine was from, he pronounced it as "Lure" in stead of "Lwahr".  If you're going to be a wine snob, at least get that stuff right.  To his credit - he did bring us wines to try before recommending a bottle, which was great.  And I cannot complain about the service for the rest of the night.The lower rating has more to do with the price of the food for the quantity.  I could have been we just mis-ordered this time but the portion was toooo small.  I expected small but not like this.  We split a pizza and the spare rib entree.  The pizza was good - we ordered the basic margarita.  I would order that again.  The spare rib however is just that - a single spare rib.  It does say spare rib on the menu, we checked after the fact.  But when ordering from an entree section and not the small plates section I expected more than one.  The majority of the dish is polenta.  And the spare rib wasn't even that good.  We were going to order more food but the above left a bad taste in our mouths so we opted for apps at home instead.Overall - its a cute place.  And I did have a great experience here before - I think more due to what we were celebrating - but I don't think I'd go back, and I know my fiance will definitely not.-------------------------------------------------------------------------Came here to celebrate a recent event with my fiance.  It was probably a combination of our mood, the food itself, and the fact that this restaurant reminded me of a place I would find in the West Village with my girlfriends rather than in Hoboken - trendy but relaxed, small plates, good wine, not a sports bar - which leads me to rate my experience a 5.We walked in around 7:30pm on a Tuesday night and there was no wait, however I can see how this place would get busy on the weekends.  The menu is written on chalkboards on the walls along with stacks of wine bottles behind a long wooden bar.  Every seat at the bar was taken, which was probably due to the Tuesday mussel and fries special - all you can eat for $18.  The tables aren't huge but I didn't feel like I was cramped. Our waitress was great, I'm sorry I don't remember her name.  She gave recommendations for wine based on our preferences and let us sample before ordering a glass.  We ended up splitting a bottle of Pasini Azienda Agricola San Giovanni - I liked it so much I looked up what liquor stores carry it when I got home.We ordered a ton of food.  We would have been fine with 2 entrees and one appetizer but we wanted to try a few different things and ended up eating all of it.  The other reviews are correct - none of the portions are large and the food is not cheap but I feel like that is typical of a wine bar.  We started with the mozzarella in olive oil (one large piece to be shared), the meatballs (2), and the truffle fries (2-3, maybe 4 can split).  I recommend all of the dishes.  The fries were actually great when dipped in the red sauce from the meatballs.  I ordered the duck risotto which was good and my fiance ordered the salami picante pizza.  I think our favorite part was the cheese.  There were 2 women sitting next to us who split a pizza and a cauliflower dish for dinner - you can make the meal as large or small as you want.Overall, I would definitely go back.  So glad we tried it!
2015-01-13,4,Went here for brunch on a Sunday. At first the service was really slow. I don't get impatient easily, but I was definitely starting to get to that point. But then it turned around. The food was AMAZING. We ordered the meatball parm grinder and gluten free pizza. And the bartender was very nice too. Highly recommend.
2015-01-09,4,Liked coming to the Bin for their gluten free fried calamari and gluten free personal pizzas. My husband loves their meatballs. Their menu is tapas style, with a creative variety. It is pricey though for the small plates, more than some places I go to in Manhattan. This is one of my go to restaurants to bring out of town guests. But the atmosphere is nice, the staff is friendly, the wine and food is good!
2015-01-03,3,I had such high hopes for this place. Who doesn't like a good tapas joint? Four of us sat outback in their outdoor space on a cold January evening and were nice and warm and toasty thanks to their heat lamps! Our waitress came to take our drink order (never caught her name) and I was immediately feeling rushed to order by her. We placed an order for a warm truffle mozzarella and some bruschetta. I was BLOWN AWAY to learn that the bruschetta was $3....per piece. $12 for bruschetta? I mean some restaurants put it on the table for free. Seemed a bit steep considering the tomatoes were hardly seasoned. The crab poppers were actually a crab popper...singular. And it was just a run of the mill lonely crab cake. The eggplant dish was delicious. The Bolognese fries were the only dish I felt we actually got our money's worth of. What is this? A center for ants?I would definitely recommend sampling some of the pizzas. We did the truffle pizza which could have had some more truffle oil on it if you ask me. The Salami Picante, burrata, shishito peppers, mozzarella pizza was my favorite. I could have eaten the entire thing. Their wine list is reasonable but their dessert menu is lacking....considering they don't serve any dessert. I don't feel the need to go back uptown to visit again.
2015-01-02,3,Have been to Bin 14 many of times.  Never had a bad experience there, but haven't had an "out of this world" one either.  The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful when making a wine selection or looking to pair food with wine.Always enjoy going later in the evening after the dinner crowd left and you're not sitting on top of each other.  You'll probably wind up spending more then you think you're going to, but it's kind of to be expected when going to a wine bar like this one.Overall, it's a solid wine bar with a great selection.
2014-12-20,1,My fiance and I have been here several times before and were looking for another great evening.  We arrived at around 6:20 and waited close to 10  minutes sfor the hostess who was on the phone.  When we decided to seat ourselves the hostess finally came over and said that all of the tables were reserved.  At this point there was only table occupied in the entire restaurant.  We have always loved going here and Anthony Davids but the  hostess was rude and we will think twice about going back.
2014-12-18,4,The lobster bruschetta is literally amazing. I really want to check out their pasta but it seems that they only have it on their dinner menu. Will try to find some time to try that soon.
2014-12-11,5,I randomly stopped here on a late Sunday afternoon for a drink and sat the bar.  The bartender was super nice and I told him I wanted to try a new beer and told him what kinds I like.  What he recommended was excellent, I think it was called la bionda.  I also tried one of their pizzas (the one with the pork belly) and that was amazing as well.  Definitely have to go back and try more stuff!  Everyone raves about this place and I definitely had a good first experience!
2014-11-16,4,I like this place because the bartenders and staff are well versed with pairing their wine selection with their menu. They have a cheese plate option where you can select 2-3 different cheeses that you may like. Whether you choose the wine first and ask for a cheese to compliment or the cheese first with a wine to tie it all together, they always seem to give very good advice.
2014-11-11,3,Went here for dinner. Great atmosphere. Lovely heated back patio, perfect for out anniversary dinner. Private and more calm outside, a little loud and hectic inside.Very knowledgeable waiter who is very helpful with suggestions. Portions are very small but perfect for ordering multiple dishes and sharing. Not impressed with the entrees.Its nice that Hoboken has an upscale winebar but its certainly a place to go to for winelovers not so much foodies. AND they do not offer dessert!
2014-11-07,4,Great level of sophistication and atmosphere here!My cousin and I each had a flight (1 red & 1 white) to start suggested by our waiter based on our wine preferences. The waiter was very knowledgeable about what they had to offer, which was very impressive for the extensive wine list. He also knew a lot about the food, which was also delicious. We shared a few of the small plates, none of which were left with any scraps. My only recommendation was the waitstaff alert the customers of the prices related to ordering a flight and any glasses thereafter. My cousin ended up choosing a $15 glass and had 3 of them so the bill was a lot higher than we expected.My boyfriend later joined, and had the gluten-free pizza which was great! That's a big plus for us looking for GF-friendly dining experiences. Great place for just catching up with friends/family over a few drinks and an appetizer or even a full 3-course  meal.
2014-10-29,5,Fantastic food, great ambiance, great wine menu.  They are very busy and popular.  But they always make an effort to accommodate you.  I like that.  I wish there we more places like that in Hoboken.
2014-10-21,3,Greaaaat wine bar. Prosciutto pizza took a huge step backwards in replacing the fig with plums. Ain't nobody got time for that.Service is awesome, so be nice to the servers.
2014-10-19,5,Excellent food and service. There is not one thing I can ding them for. The bartenders were extremely knowledgable on their wine, and our service was pleasant and attentive. We shared two bruschetta's, tuna and beef (excellent), honey truffle mozzarella (melt in your mouth) and the duck risotto and beef/sausage bolognese. We both had mutilple glasses of one of their finer Pinot Noir's which was a great pairing with our dishes. I also need to credit whomever decided their playlist tonight because I loved every soon that was played. We will definitely be back!
2014-10-19,4,I enjoyed bin 14, I dined with a group of friends out on the patio while the weather was still nice. We tried several dishes and ate family style, my favorite was the pork belly and the pumpkin and sweet potato ravioli. The wine selection was nice, the server was very friendly and knowledgable. I think this place would be great for girls night or a date.
2014-09-30,4,It's good for what it is, if you want a wine bar then here it is.  Service was punctual and polite, 4 drinks cost $40.66, so reasonable.  Quiet until 7:00, then gets packed.  Bar seating as well as around the wall
2014-09-30,4,First time here. Excellent food and wine. May be a bit understaffed but that is part of being lean and green. Shrimp and grits awesome ! Wine selection impressive! Staff is responsive, polite and a tad overworked.
2014-09-28,2,Been there three times now and always is the same: terrible service, OK food (sometimes even good) and overpriced wine. Probably not coming back anytime soon. If I want tapas I'd rather look for a Spanish restaurant in Manhattan.
2014-09-28,3,I absolutely love the food here. However, I've been here two times and both times I've experienced unusually unenthusiastic and uncharismatic service, from two different waitresses! It's as if they are trained to act this way... weird. Be less miserable waitresses!
2014-09-20,4,One of my favorites in Hoboken, but stick with the pizzas and only go for dinner. Lunch appears to be their B team.
2014-09-16,5,Great wine bar and restaurant.  Wide selection of wines and servers seem knowledgeable on different wines they have on hand.  Ask for a sample if you're not sure, they will happily give you a taste before you order a glass.The food is excellent too.  Menu changes a little from season to season but it is always very fresh and well prepared.  They small plates are definitely on the small side so be sure to ask how big the servings are to know you are ordering enough.  They have a nice patio area in the back with heaters, i would recommend the patio or out front seating if weather permits.  I think the patio is open year round.
2014-09-13,2,Terrible, atrocious service.  Dined with a group of 5. Waitress immediately asked for drink order. Given the voluminous wine list, we asked for a minute and she rudely huffed away.  She didn't come back for more than 20 minutes. Didn't come back to take drink orders throughout the meal.  I ordered a 6 oz glass of the Brunello; it  clearly had been poured from a bottle that was open for about a month. After the waitress came back 30 min later, I said I would pay for it but couldn't drink it due to the sour taste. She grabbed my glass, sipped from it and then tried to argue with me about it!  During the entire meal, the owner or manager was screaming at the line cooks about turning the food out.  One chef threatened to quit and walk out. This went on for 2 hours, all in ear shot of the diners. Such a disappointment.
2014-09-13,5,Expensive but you do get what you pay forThis is my favorite place to eat in HBKGreat seasonal menu and of course the wine and cheese plates are TDFPlease keep the bolognese sauce on the menu all year long
2014-09-07,5,Can you say "Eli Manning"  WHOOP WHOOP!!!!!!!! Yes I saw the one and only "Eli Manning" from the NY GIANTS!! The wine and food were great but seeing "Eli" was the highlight of my night. Unfortunately I had to play it cool, but inside I was "Happpppppppy"!!! And yes he is a "Cutey" :-)))))) I'm coming back to Bin 14 for the food, drinks, and "Eli Manning"!!!!! ;-))))))))
2014-09-06,4,Best wine bar in Hoboken. Wine recommendations are great and the staff really knows their stuff. The food is good. Sometimes great but not consistently. Great for a date night or girls night out.
2014-09-04,1,Food was flavorless. Pasta was cooked very well (we love it al dente), but you need to drench it in grated cheese for taste. Won't return.
2014-08-17,5,Celiacs dream! Bin 14 is hands down my favorite new spot to go for dinner.  I travel from Morristown just to go to dinner there and wish they could bring a Bin 14 here. Not only is the wine list absolutely amazing but the Wine Director Joel is very helpful.  I have now come to Bin 14 twice and on both occasions Joel was spot on with his suggestions and Maddy, one of the bartenders, was equally as helpful and knowledgeable about the wines.  They both are completely aware of gluten allergies and double checked on anything i had questions about.  The gluten free bread is so amazing that my friends love getting it which makes my life so much easier.  We get mostly apps and small plates and pizzas and split everything and because almost everything on the menu can be made gluten free it makes sharing dinner easy. They have separate fryers as well so there is no cross contamination.  I honestly asked if I could order the bread online and have it shipped to my house! (the answer was no haha). Bin 14 should be your next dinner spot!
2014-08-14,4,The staff was as sweet as can be and the food was delicious. The portions are nice and small -- leaving you satisfied & not disgustingly stuffed. The place is decorated very tastefully, with subtle lights and wine bottles everywhere. They have an endless supply of wine... go thirsty and tell the waitress what you like and she'll bring you a few options to try. First come first serve for the outside seating so go earlyish.Also-- no dessert.
2014-08-04,5,I've been going to Bin 14 for years, and will continue to do so. Chef Justin is always changing the menu based on what's in season. He's never afraid to take risks, and try new dishes that keep me coming back. If you're looking to spend 10 bucks on a chicken parm, this is not your spot! This is the place to have a nice glass of wine and do some people watching. This is the place to have an intimate dinner before a night on the town. This is a place to bring someone that you are trying to impress (i.e. 1st date).  But I must say, I've also had some great brunches here, and will pop in from time to time just to get a cheese plate and catch up with old friends.
2014-07-28,5,I have been coming here for years. There is nothing like it in Hoboken. Great wines, great menu and fun bar scene. They always keep the menu fresh and interesting, I enjoy reading the specials board to see what pops up. The wine tastings are amazing. Its a solid choice whether for date night, girls night or solo. You will never feel uncomfortbale going alone and hanging out. The staff and management are very friendly.
2014-07-20,1,A disturbing, Sad and salty experience. Will not go back, for the expensive attitude - neither the absolute salty meatball - Pizza fiasco and non less a wine glass so expensive that makes absolutely no sense.the facf of being the only wine bar in town, gives them power to charge and have an attitude. I try it a few times already over the course of a year. at this point on, after this past experience on thursday, I won't go back. Not for the fact of saying that in Hoboken the food scene is pretty repellent and represent no part of the world in a fare and pure way. By the way: management - get a less according to the role snob attitude. My wife ask one simple question, and one only. " Excuse me Sir - would you mind to check on our food " - here is what you answered: Calm down we are busy - Hold on ill go check.Not worth a penny to go back.
2014-07-17,2,Food is great. Service is not.They have a strict reservation policy which is hilarious considering I've seen empty tables OFTEN on Saturday nights. Front of house is a mess (receptionist.) Also our service could've been much better. Server kept messing up our order - forgot food and added food we didn't order - and then when the bill came, the mistaken food was still on! Furthermore I was a little off put that I ordered a glass of wine - then asked for a bottle...and since we spent so much money at your restaurant, I thought the one glass wouldn't be on the bill.
2014-07-16,3,Should be getting two stars but the place itself is good.  It is the service...lack there of that was a HUGE turn off.  Went there to find out about reservations a few days prior to family in town and was told they don't take reservations after 6pm.  Thought great, so I had a glass of wine and ordered a flatbread that looks great...15...20...30, finally I asked about my appetizer and they said they forgot about it...WHAT?  So came back the following week with family and was told I need a reservation and had to take them somewhere else!!!  While walking to a different restaurant, my family from out of town commented on how the host was rude when telling me that his staff would never say such a thing!  Funny part was my family said they would never go back based on the 3 minutes of interaction with the guy!  Service horrible... restaurant great...wine list AWESOME for Hoboken...Hence only 3 stars
2014-07-10,3,Excellent wine selection and small bites, but the service was a bit off. For a wine bar, they have a nice relaxed atmosphere, though the music was constantly a few clicks too loud. The wine list was great and we found some treasures as was the menu, especially the calamari which we got after seeing every other table in the place order it. Loved the tanginess of the peppers with the calamari. Service though left something to be desired. Quite slow, didn't really check up on us, and loudly complaining about coworkers in front of patrons. Not cultivating the desired wine bar atmosphere. En vino veritas
2014-06-27,2,The food is good but the service is TERRIBLE! We arrived at seven, were first told the wait would be ten minutes, then a half hour.  An hour and twenty minutes later both the hostess and the waitress had no clue what planet they were on.  No apologies were provided.
2014-06-27,3,Been here now for brunch once & dinner twice.  It is OK, bit pricey, but more so because anything cool they have on the menu (octopus, pork belly, interesting pizzas) is all barely passing & certainly doesn't hold up to similarly priced places I have been  to elsewhere.  There was literally BBQ sauce on the pork belly.  That is a first.  And it was dry & tasted like a rib. Enough said. Wine selection, though is excellent - Great options for middle priced wines & good variety.  Service and ambiance also great.Just stick with basic Italian/American dishes here & you'll enjoy it.
2014-06-07,1,Sitting and eating lunch in the back courtyard. The food is good but the service and our waitress was very arrogant and unhelpful. We have a 8 yr old with us and we asked our waitress if we could get a simple dish like pasta for her. Those of you who have been here before or have had a look at the menu would know what I am talking about. The waitress shrugs her shoulders and says they can't do that. My husband asked to speak to the  chef and she says the "chef is not prepared to talk to us" and the kitchen is not equipped to make pasta. Seriously, what equipment do you need to make pasta? Anyway, the owner then came out and said sorry.I would not recommend this place for anyone with kids and specially if you are looking forward to courteous service.
2014-05-21,3,Outdoor seating in front and back patio. Huge wine list. 2 oz and 6 oz pours. Average price of a 6 oz glass of red was about $12. Delicious and smooth. Waiter was very knowledgable. No big complaints. Nothing particularly outstanding. I might return and try the food next time.
2014-05-18,1,I would actually give this place 0 stars.  My husband and another couple waited till 945 for our reservations and we were starving.  Server was nice and she was prompt.   However,  we were sitting by the kitchen and a song came on we liked but couldn't remember who sang it.  We asked the employee next to our table.... Just standing and not busy working.  He informed us he wouldn't answer because he was the head chef... And was very rude.  So we got up and left.  Will never eat his food. Douche
2014-05-14,4,If you're going to charge $5-$6 per piece of bruschetta, it better be pretty damn good.  Well, Bin 14 holds up to the challenge.  Definitely the most inventive and delicious bruschetta around.....some of my favorites include the steak tartare with raw quail egg yolk, and the blue crab with mango and avocado.  I want to try them all!And it's not just the bruschetta that's excellent.  Throughout the menu you'll find ingredients and preparations you won't find anywhere else in town.  Grilled octopus.  Lamb chops.  Lobster pizza.  Quail.  To name a few.It is a pricey, classy wine bar, so you can get dressed up, but casual is ok too.  Portions are very small, so expect to order several courses (which could get expensive).  There is an outdoor patio in the back, which is also nice.  We had brunch there once and had a great experience.They have fixed seating times on weekends, which can be annoying because they usually book up way ahead of time, but usually you can snag a table outside, which is first come first served, or sometimes you can get an inside table if people don't show up for their reservation (which seems to happen a lot).  Based on the food and atmosphere, I want to give this place 5 stars so badly....but I can't.  Because the service, though friendly, is slightly lacking.  Let me explain...I would think they have the fixed seating arrangement to make things easier on themselves, meaning they would have the whole service thing down to a science....but they don't.  If the main premise of your business is that you are a "wine bar", you better make it a point that nobody has an empty wine glass.  Ever.  Yet, there have been several occasions where we've had to eat entire dishes without any wine in our glasses and no waitstaff in sight.  This takes away from the experience because you look forward to the pairing of the wine with the food.If it weren't for that one shortcoming with the wine service, this place would be pretty near perfect in my opinion.  Nevertheless, it remains one of the more unique food establishments in town and their food is truly a work of art.
2014-05-12,4,I have to say this place was really good. It was probably in the top ten places i have tried. (keep in mind im new to the area) Coming from the east village i had a good selection of small plate type places and this one does a good job of proving me a good place to go.  Id suggest getting thier homemade mozz (all of them are pretty good) and the truffle fries. Both were a great starter to a meal. I still need to go back and try other dishes but for me to visit more than once is a good thing.
2014-05-11,4,Managed to stop by on a weekday during lunch and were seated outside on a particularly warm and lovely day. The food. The food was so so so good.Blue crab bruschetta: divineGrilled octopus small plate: heaven-sent Pizza: I can't remember the name but there's one with an egg on top. You cannot skip this. It is amazing!! Must return.
2014-05-11,4,Really enjoyed an evening catching up with friends over great wine! Food looked delicious and I plan on coming back next time for a bite as well. After months and months of being skeptical of this restaurant due to staff being unfriendly, rushing you out of the restaurant and overall just feeling unwelcome, I stand corrected. Staff was pleasant, accommodating and engaging. I will spread the good word about bin 14 from this moment on. Cannot wait to go back :)
2014-05-04,1,Good news - gluten free pizza crust that can be used in place of bread for a few things on menu. Bad news the Sunday morning wait staff is awful. Lazy and annoyed. My husband ordered a side of bacon and when it didn't arrive with our food he asked the waiter about it. The response? "I only have two hands) this is after we sat for several minutes just watching our food sit waiting to be picked up.  My fork was dirty with lipstick. And there you have it. It's like I was transported to Brooklyn.
2014-05-03,5,Possibly the most innovative restaurant I. Hoboken--wonderful wine list, a consistently excellent tapas menu that seems to change seasonally, great atmosphere. You have zero chance of getting a table for dinner without a reservation, but lunch is always easy for a drop-in. The grilled octopus and the quail egg/steak tartar crustini are among my favorites.
2014-04-23,4,Came here with a friend one night.  Great spot on the main street and very laid back environment.  Management is super hands on with the staff and greeted me when I went to pay the bill.  As for dinner, we had the risotto grits which was awesome, octopus was on point, pizza with truffles (my personal selection) and the meatballs (also very good).  Would def come back and their wine selection is on point!!! I stick with the reds because they give me a good buzz.  Overall i would come back again.
2014-04-21,3,I went here with 2 friends on a week night and we had a nice time. We ordered several plates to share and while nothing was particularly unsavory, I can't say that I was impressed by the food. Each plate was very one-dimensional in flavor and texture. However I enjoyed the Service, wine, atmosphere and will most likely return.Sharing plates is always fun!
2014-04-18,2,Apparently they don't take reservations?  The entire process was confusing. Was told at 6:30 the next available table for 4 was 9:30 (? Really?) Ok we will have a drink at the bar, the hostess tells us the bar seats are all full. . Which should've been or first indication they didn't want us there. Foolishly, we decided to stand at the bar and have a drink. Had a rose, it was okay.The hostess came over and asked us to move to the waiting area in the back, so we could clear the area for servers.Why not just say can you please go stand next to the bathrooms (completely in the way of everyone) and be made to feel totally unwelcome so you drink your wine really fast and get the hell out. Womp. Went next door to Madison's and probably had 20x a better dining experience than we would've had here.
2014-04-17,2,When this place first opened up I thought it was awesome. However, I feel that there's been a decline over the recent years... I went once with a group of friends. We each ordered something at the bar. My friend's food came out but mine didn't. I assumed it was still cooking. I had to follow up with the waitress and ask what happened. Turned out she forgot.... Went a second time with one friend and got seated next to a nice and DRAFTY door... Lovely. Ordered the salmon and felt starved afterwards. I also paid a ton for the wine and the food.
2014-04-13,4,I am a big fan of Bin 14 and was a bit shocked when I realized just now that I've never given the Yelp world my 2 cents on this Hoboken staple.WHY is Bin 14 the only wine bar in Hoboken?! You would think a restaurant like this would be such a win in this town! Their selection is fantastic, and the servers know what's up. I've only been disappointed by 1 selection, and in the half dozen times that I've been there since, I haven't seen that server, so let's just assume she wasn't a good fit.The food selection rotates somewhat seasonally. Via weekend specials, Bin 14 does a good job at keeping up with what is in season. But the not-to-miss dishes would have to be the bone marrow, pecorino fries, blue crab bruschetta, foie gras bruschetta, the beet salad and the mussels. I've never once been disappointed when ordering those items, and my pup Luna especially loves when I have the bone marrow because it means she gets a delicious treat once I get home! Are the prices at Bin 14 on the high side? Probably. But you're paying for pretty darn good food... So you're probably asking why the 1 star reduction? I've found that service is not the most consistent. Sometimes the waiter/waitress is always around and sometimes I can't find them for a stretch of time - almost always when I'm antsy to continue my evening.
2014-03-27,4,First time in bin 14 on Monday. I love the food and the wine list was awesome. We had the sausage and pepper crustini and a nice cheese plate. The staff  was knowledgeable about the wine, even know it was clear the the girl behind the bar was more of a beer and shot girl. All in all a nice night out we will return.
2014-03-15,4,As always enjoyed some nice wine and snacks at the bar -- big fan!!  Great ambiance, love the polenta  & rock shrimp, kale salad and pizza - my fave
2014-02-22,2,Went for the wine tasting today. Not worth the 65$! Agreed it's a wine tasting but the less than a finger pour, and the tablespoon of risotto and single slider-sized portions left me wondering what my 65 bucks were attributed to. I wouldn't recommend their wine tastings. It's a great idea, but incredibly overpriced, and your 65$ plus tax and gratuity are better spent else where ..
2014-02-18,3,Not too many options for wine bars in the area. Place is small but cute. Make reservations if there are more than two people. Truffle fries are seriously delicious and the short braised rib with polenta entree was very good.
2014-02-12,4,We love coming to Bin 14 for a casual happy hour at the bar or for a multi course special occasion.  We have found it to be very consistent as far as food and service go.  My only complaint and it is partly on me is that when i asked for a wine recommendation they brought wine for us to try.  They did not ask our price range so we assumed they went middle of the road.  They were $19/glass!  The food is amazing, it is my parents favorite place to go in Hoboken when they visit.  I highly recommend the short ribs!!
2014-02-04,3,A-MAZING food.  Always very crowded, loud, and difficult to get a table, even when you have a reservation.Recommendations:  Carmelized onion and pork belly pizza, truffled honey mozzarella, maple brussel sprouts, rock shrimp
2014-02-03,4,Seriously yummy!! The wine selections masterfully paired with the perfect bites makes this one of my favorite wine cafeÃÅs. You can't go wrong here... Flatbreads and pizzas, mussels and fries... What else could you want!??
2014-01-31,5,Lots of truffle oil varieties on the menu. The whole meal was pretty amazing. This might be my favorite restaurant in Hoboken
2014-01-25,3,I have been here twice and the food and wine has been good, but I have to lower the star count due to service. We did not come at a busy time, but when I went this afternoon both the hostess and waitress acted like they did not have time for us. Why, because they were busy hanging out with the bartenders. I would leave their names, but they didn't bother to give them. My wife and I both work in service industries and we get it. We still left 20% tip, but not even a "thank you and good night."  I like the food and wine, but the staff has no excuse for being rude or condescending. I wanted to show my parents a good time and I was disappointed.
2014-01-20,5,Service and food 5 stars. Maddy deserves special mention as an example of how all hosts should be. Great food and wine, beers for anyone who feels left out. This is a great Hoboken find and I'll be sure to be back!
2014-01-15,4,Read some reviews online about this restaurant in Hoboken, so I decided to give it a try for a date night dinner with my boyfriend. We actually arrive almost 25 minutes early and told them I made a reservation through yelp. The hostess then told me the table that was reserved for me is still occuppied, so I was told to wait by the chairs near the bar. I was given some menus to look at and the hostess was really nice and said she can take our drink order while we are waiting to be seated. We waited approximately 15 minutes and another table in the back opened up. We were seated outside in the tent that was set with heated lamps. It was a really nice setting and many couples and other customers seem to be having a great time talking and having their food. We then placed our order. Absolutely LOVED that they have so many wine selections and it comes with several different sizes to choose from. I chose the smallest size because I don't drink too much. It was a perfect fit with all the appretizers and entrees that my boyfriend and I ordered. I don't exactly remember what I ordered, since its been a while. But everything was delicious. The server was nice and overall experience is great.This is a great restaurant, I will definitely come back again. I just wish they have more food selections.
2014-01-01,2,Just had a terrible experience at bin 14 and will probably never go back.  Unfortunately I think it was merely just a poor server but with a half full restaurant was not asked for a drink order nor where we served within 15 minutes of seating so we got up and gave Madison bar and grill our service!  I think the waitress had too good of a New Years but the capper was when she was sitting on her cell phone while we waited to put an order in...
2013-12-31,4,Mediocre food and rude rushed service. Before eating here I heard good things but had seen their yelp rating steadily decline. Now I know why. I ordered salmon (the market fish that day). It arrives raw inside. Not medium rare, not a little pink, but raw. I tell the waiter that it's raw. He says, "That's how this fish is cooked. I guess we can heat it up for you." The dish returns. This time the fish is burnt and almost un-eatable.  Immediately upon finishing our entrees and before I had finished my glass of wine the waiter basically tells us that we had to vacate.Updated as of January 2015: I have had a handful of better experiences at Bin 14 since my initial visit. They are probably one of the better restaurants, by Hoboken standards.
2013-12-23,5,Recently held a Xmas event there for 35 people, things were a bit tight due to the narrow eating area , but everyone seemed happy.The manager gave us a good price on the food, held it at 1 pm on a Thursday afternoon and they closed down for us.Service was excellent, food above standard.  Sad we couldn't use the patio, about 12 degrees out!  No heaters in the world could accommodate us that day.The manager is a great guy, funny and so accommodating!  Would def visit again.Like every other place in Hoboken, parking an issue.  There are the two hour meters that if you miss by 5 seconds you will have a 30$ ticket or the lot on 15th that cost me 20 for a few hoursIf you are a big eater and enjoy a plate stuffed with food this is not your place.  It's about tastings and the experience
2013-12-11,3,The food here is fantastic and the wine selection is great. However, the atmosphere could be improved. This is not a quiet, romantic wine bar. It's very loud and the tables are so close together that you can't really have a private conversation without your neighboring diners hearing every word. There is also a bar with a number of large TVs playing sports which makes it feel like a pub. It's definitely an expensive place to eat - their prices are higher than similar wine bar/tapas restaurants in Manhattan. I could get over that if it were a more pleasant place to eat.
2013-11-28,5,Bin 14 is my favorite dinner or Saturday brunch spot in Hoboken. The bartenders always help make a custom wine flight based on my preferences and the wine selection is unbeatable. Cheese boards and pizzas are a perfect light sharable meal. I have had entrees too and nothing has ever disappointed. For brunch their spicy Bloody Mary's are amazing - especially when paired with one of their specialty grilled chesses. I recommend reservations if you want a dinner table - but grabbing a seat at the bar to eat is a nice atmosphere as well.
2013-11-24,4,A great spot worth checking out.  The food, service and ambiance were all fantastic.  I'd definitely go back.
2013-11-19,4,Had a lovely time at Bin 14 last night, thanks to the recommendations of Yelpers. I made reservations but it might not have been necessary, as we sat mostly alone on the super-cute outdoor patio. It was a bit cool but with the heating lamps, comfortable with a light sweater and much quieter than inside. Vino : him - Merlot, me - Riesling We were both pleased with the selections but what is with the oversized wine glasses trend? They look great but take up so much room on the table and require a quite undignified stem-up / head-back tip to finish. Primi: Homemade Mozzarella with Truffle Honey, Mushroom Bruschetta, Roma Tomato & Ricotta Bruschetta.   I enjoyed the mozz more than he did (he wished it was warmer), but we both enjoyed the bruschetta. The waitress gave fair warning that the servings were small. The Bruschetta comes so piled high with toppings, I would have preferred two crostini instead of one to reduce the spill factor. Secondi: We shared a Margarita pizza (added ricotta), and a side of mushrooms. Pleased with both, though the mushrooms were a bit rough chopped and not all pieces cooked all the way though. Service: Our waitress, Allison, was so lovely and knowledgeable. She checked on us regularly without being intrusive, and was politely amused at our indecisive antics. We hope she enjoys her vacation! Price: Spendy for sure. Those tiny plates add up fast. I might skip the bruschetta next time and just do the side of veg. If it was so great, where's the last star? No hot drinks and no dessert makes K a sad girl. My poor date was getting over a cold and was desperate for a cup of tea.  I appreciate a small menu but it was such a lovely meal, we would have liked to linger over espresso. A sorbet would have been a nice palate cleanser after that carb and cheese bomb of a meal. It all worked out, as Applegate Farms is right around the corner, but still.
2013-11-03,4,Great place, with a stellar wine collection.  Shared a sausage pizza with my date and split a bottle of Llama Malbec.  Great time had by both of us.
2013-11-02,3,We went there with a group of 4. Being saturday evening we had to book a table in advance. The staff was good. Food was good. But the portions were very small. Bruschetta had just one piece. Wine was pretty expensive, $15 per glass, apple cider $12 per glass. Their pizzas were good. We also ordered Shrimp and Truffle fries. Food was above average but nothing special. Definitely not worth the price. The entrees (lamb chops and short ribs) had very small portions. Ribs were not hot enough. Overall, this place is way too overrated and pricey for the small portions served. I would not go back here. There are better places to try in Hoboken.
2013-10-30,3,I love Bin 14. I love the food and the wine, but the wait staff can definitely use some work. I walked in and told the hostess I had a reservation. She didn't even respond to me and looked around the restaurant.  Literally, she acted like I wasn't even there.  After a few minutes of this, she looked at me and didn't say a word. I had to ask "so is our table ready"? Finally, she said we needed to have a seat and it would be ready shortly. After a 15 minute wait for an 8:45 PM reservation we were seated.  Our waiter was prompt to bring us wine, but acted arrogant. Once the wine was brought over, it took him 20 mins to come back to take our food order.  He was standing in a corner drinking a beer and socializing with the hostess instead of asking for our order!  I was there for the all you can eat mussels on Tuesday nights. When I ordered this he looked at his watch - implying I didn't have enough time to order this, which was the biggest joke because of the dealy of sitting and our order being taken.  Good FoodBAD BAD BAD Service and Arrogant Staff
2013-10-20,4,While I still wouldn't go here for dinner due to their awful table policy, we did try them for brunch.  It had been a year since the last bad incident, and everyone deserves a second chance.  Well I was pleasantly surprised.  I loved the brunch atmosphere, they even have a make your own blood mary bar for those OCD individuals, who think no one can make a better bloody mary than they can.  The omlettes were superb, and our waitress was super sweet.  Will def be back for more brunches!
2013-10-20,4,I was quite impressed with Bin14 and eager to return. My girl friends and I like to go out every once and awhile for wine nights and this was our most recent destination. I was worried going on a Saturday night that it would be insanely busy and we wouldn't get in, but they accommodated our request to sit at a table for two with an extra chair (a small group of three can make it work!) and they fixed a table for us immediately. Our waiter made a very knowledgeable recommendation for wine based on the types of food we were considering to order and what our personal tastes were. We were not disappointed and ordered two bottles! It turned out to be a rather expensive night but the bottles of wine was probably why :'PI very much enjoyed the crab bruschetta....I would come back for that alone! The lobster was a little lacking - kind of tasted like a lobster roll with lots of mayo - and the tomato basil was about a 3 out of 5. I thought the meatballs were delightful, the calamari and rock shrimp very tasty.This is an awesome place to enjoy lots of different flavors - and be adventurous without guilt if you don't like something! - that can be shared with friends, while being in a relaxing atmosphere with great wine. Definitely a good date or girl's night spot! Just be prepared to spend a little more here.
2013-10-19,4,Awesome Wine and Small plates.Met a old friend for drinks outside. We both shared a few small plates, and had many glasses of wine...too many. We sat along the sidewalk on a bright day and really enjoyed ourselves. Cant speak for the rest of the menu, but the small plates we both very much enjoyed (great meatballs). We both will repeat.Staff is very knowledgable and gave us wonderful wine suggestions.
2013-10-11,4,For Hoboken, it's great to have a place like this (since it seems the city has a wine and tapas bar on every block and we're otherwise deprived).  I wouldn't say the food is exceptional, but in a town that caters to the bar and grill crowd (me), it's nice to have options.I think the crostini seem a bit overpriced at $6 per, though the beef tartare was very good and would have seemed a value if the beef was split on two toasts.  The fig and prosciutto pizza was predictably delicious, and the poutine was really rich and comforting (though I think the use of foie gras was probably gratuitous to make it sound fancy), and I'd call the shrimp & polenta the can't miss of all the above.  My most interesting observation I think is that the pork belly with pickled ramps pizza tasted strangely like I think a White Castle pizza would taste.  I love Castle, so that's definitely not a bad thing.  Curious to know if anyone else agrees?Side note, I was a bit disappointed when the first two bottles (Malbec, Rioja) we tried to order were out of stock.  I did enjoy the Cab we settled on, so it was lucky there were plenty of relatively modest options (under $60).
2013-10-10,1,The wine was delicious. The mediocre food on this limited menu did not satisfy everyone in our group of 6. I realize this is a tapas menu, but how can you charge the same as a dinner in another restaurant? We were stared down the entire evening because a guest arrived late. The table needed to be released within an hour of sitting down. Clearly they didn't think we would leave in time..  The staff were not kind about this. It made for a very uncomfortable evening. We were not allowed the privacy needed to relax and enjoy our evening with friends. I will not go back. I was highly dissatisfied.  We planned that night for two weeks and they ruined it. I drove an hour for that kind of treatment. We'll see how far they get treating guests like the enemy.
2013-10-01,5,Many people go to Bin 14 for the wine, I go for the food.  They have gluten free selections which is always a plus!Their fried chicken (when it's on the menu) rivals some of the best fried chicken in NYC/NJ.  They do seatings on weekends which is a little bit annoying but the restaurant is on the smaller side so it doesnt really bother you. Another A+ for the chef!!
2013-09-29,5,FINALLY, when someone asks me what my favorite restaurant is, I have a definitive answer. Bin 14 all the way.My date and I enjoyed the warm mozzarella ball, tomato bruschetta (note that it is one piece per order), a small margherita pizza, and an order of meatballs (we considered getting another order of these - AHmazing). All "small plates" - with a couple glasses of wine - added up to a perfect meal. This is the food/atmosphere/wine I'd been unknowingly waiting for.Can't wait to go back. Definitely get a reservation - the dining area is perfectly cozy so I imagine that wait times are long without one.
2013-09-27,4,"Hoboken's Only Wine Bar"  is FANTASTIC.  This place is owned by the people who own Anthony David, so CLEARLY it's good.I came here on a Monday afternoon (please note that Mondays are my Saturdays) and spent a delightful hour here with a tasting flight that only cost me thirteen dollars.The list of wines is extensive but not expensive (especially when used to Manhattan prices) so this was that much more of a great experience.Some of the flights have tasting notes, and some didn't.  Unfortunately, mine didn't.  I wish it did.  But that's my only complaint!  Great spot.
2013-09-22,4,I really really hope Bin 14 stays true to their description.  This is a great romantic yet fun place for singles and couples alike.  It is NOT a place for kids.  Hey, I love em but there are enough places in town that have been over run by strollers and kids running around while you are trying to enjoy a quiet meal or glass of wine.  The food is really good but please- leave the kids at home before coming here.
2013-09-12,3,Atmosphere is great. BUT, if you're going to ask the waiter for a wine recommendation be sure to ask the price.  I don't consider myself cheap, but to get the bill w/a $20 GLASS of wine the waiter recommended was a bit much.
2013-09-09,2,Below is a summary of feedback I sent to the manager after hosting an August dinner for 13 people on the patio for my husband's 40th birthday:A party of four arrived a little before 5pm and neither the hostess nor the bartender knew about the private party which was happening from 5-8.  This caused confusion as our guests began to wonder if they had the right date/location.  The patio was not set up and ready for seating until after 5pm.  We noticed that there were tons of flies around us and our food.  The fans were already on so there was nothing much that could be done.  We were told by your manager on duty that this was a consequence of eating outside and he lit some citronella candles.  I have to wonder if our party was not expected, perhaps there was garbage sitting out there before we arrived?  It was really that bad.  The wines were good.  The food was average - delicious sausage/pepper bruschetta, truffle fries and octopus.  The scallops were fishy and sandy and feedback on the lamb was that it was good but I was one of a few people who didn't get to try it out since we didn't have enough to go around. Prior to booking your venue, I had received multiple comments from friends in town that they like it there, but the service is very slow.  I did not have any issue with the service - timing was good. I hope that these comments help you in the future to provide an even better experience.
2013-09-05,4,Visited this place last weekend and loved it. So far I'd consider the food to be the best quality of what we're tried in Hoboken. A little on the pricey side but every dish we had we were impressed with. I'm happy to pay for proper quality restaurant food.The bar tender was also excellent in helping choose wines that matched the dishes.
2013-09-01,4,Great food, excellent wine selection, knowledgeable staff, but service could have been a lot better. Waiter was friendly but we only got to see him rarely and spend quite a bit of time or trying to locate him or waiting for him
2013-08-29,5,Been here a few times - love their gluten free menu! Actually thought I was served regular pizza bc I couldn't tell it was gluten free.  Their back courtyard is cute, but I prefer their outdoor seating up front.  It can be a bit noisy inside.  The truffle honey mozzarella is a must-try!!!  You can't go wrong with their pizzas either.  The cheese plate is fine, but I'd opt for the truffle honey mozzarella over the cheese plate any day! The meatball appetizer and veggie sides have served well in the past too. This is a great place for tasty gluten free options and is one of our new go-to spots in Hoboken!
2013-08-12,3,Love this joint, the food and it's idea. I bring my man here but feed him first before we land, yes feed him a full meal or then he complains like a wilder beast. Portion size is small but it's a "tapas kinda place" and for these prices maybe they should not be. It is always crowded, the wait is long on weekends. This place is tiny, I am always tempted to reach over and grab someone's food while I sit at the bar. The service is ON A.D.D., some are on crack & some on LSD, Just depends on the night. No mixed drinks, only wine or beer...but if you want that shit bring some little bottles & mix them in the bathroom. IT IS EXPENSIVE and you may have to hit a diner after but go and try it.
2013-07-22,4,I had been waiting to try this place for a while. I finally got my chance a few weeks ago. It was a Saturday and we did not have a reservations (oops!) but were able to grab seats at the bar. In total we sampled three different wines and a few dishes. The portions are small so expect tapas style rather than actual dinner style. The service was attentive and we did not feel rushed - even while sitting at the bar. My only complaint about this place is that they do not offer dessert. I hope they are working on getting a pastry chef because no meal is complete without dessert. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Bin 14 and would go back.
2013-07-19,3,With my wife and friend. Bottle a wine ordered now food time. Priorities.  Place only to munch.  Lots of wine of course and a decent selection of food.  Men can go  hungry in here.  Place for some snacks and excellent wine.  The bartenders are very knowledgeable and good.
2013-07-08,5,I had no idea there was a wine bar in Hoboken! What an amazing find. And for all the Italian restaurants in this town, Bin 14 still manages to stand out with its excellent dishes & friendly service.The food was very nicely done. Light, fresh, & exactly what I was expecting. The Wild Mushrooms with Lemon & Pecorino were flavorful & a perfect accompaniment to our meal. My friends had the Seared Diver Scallops & the Wild Mushroom Pizza, which they thoroughly enjoyed (considering they finished their dishes 10 minutes before I did!). My homemade Cavatelli with Broccolini, Garlic, Roasted Tomato, & Crumbled sausage was incredible. My dish was satisfying without being heavy; perfect for the season. The fresh garlic was incredible. And my glass of Willamette Riesling was perfectly chilled & paired with my dish beautifully.The service was excellent. Our waiter was friendly & anticipated our needs, and I almost forgot that I wasn't dining in NYC. He mentioned that the new sommelier is working to revamp the liquor available at the restaurant, opting for smaller batches of quality liquor that are comparable in taste to the mass-produced standards. Bin 14's location on the "other end" of Washington St made for a comfortable dining environment (read: quiet), even while sitting outside. Inside, the crowd was busy for a Friday night. It's perfect for a date or dinner with friends.Just ... perfect. I'm definitely keeping Bin 14 on my list.
2013-07-07,3,I really do enjoy this place, great food, wine, service. Bummed that they ran out of cauliflower the other night, and hubby wasn't a fan of the small batch gin. We have spent the last 2 Valentine's Days there and had a blast. Finally ate on the back patio and it was delightful. Go Chef Pino!
2013-06-07,2,I was a big fan of Bin 14 when it first opened five or six years ago, but it's barely recognizable as the same upscale wine bar, save for the high prices.  The bar stools are packed in so tight that one becomes intimate with ones neighbor to the point that elbow action while eating and sipping is precarious.   However, my biggest gripe is how the bartenders try to promote the most expensive wines when suggestions are proffered.  Both of my friends nearly fell victim to this ploy.  I asked for a "house" (read: less expensive) Sauvignon blanc the other night and after a few sips, couldn't stomach the swill put before me. I noted that the color was off, but as I met my friends late and we planned to leave shortly after my arrival, I decided to wait for a decent glass of wine at our next stop. .   I was floored when I got the bill of $18! For that price I could have had a nice Sancerre in NYC!    Expressing my displeasure with the price, when I requested a "house" wine, an "adjustment" to $14 was made. I pointed out that the wine was "off" as it was dark, and cloudy, and frankly, undrinkable. i was told that it was a special organic wine. I didn't buy that. If I want "organic" wine, I'll go to the East Village! This is supposed to be an upscale wine bar for goodness sake.   The staff member ended up kindly writing off the bad wine, and my friends and I went on our way.      So sorry to see the demise of this once highly touted wine bar. Due to its location on the north end of town, my friends and I surmised that they are catering to the out-of-town folk driving in to Hoboken, so return local patrons are  not necessarily the clientele any longer.
2013-05-28,4,My friends had been talking this place up for a while so we decided to get together and see what it was all about.  It is very cozy inside with a long bar and a few tables.  They have an outdoor area with heat lamps that looks almost like a garden which was very nice.  I'll remember to ask for that area next time.  An extensive wine list can be a bit overwhelming but the staff was very helpful and knowledgeable, asking questions about what we liked and offering us wines to sample to make sure we enjoyed them.  The food is small plate style so the price can seem a bit high for the amount of food you actually receive but the flavors and ingredients are extremely high in quality.  The menu more creative dishes and some standard dishes, so a little something for everyone.  Gluten free and vegetarian options are also available.  Everything tasted really good and its always a nice adventure to just order a bunch of small plates and go nuts sharing with each other.  I wish it was closer to the PATH beacuse that 14 blocks is quite the hike, but well worth it.  Also a place like this doesn't need any tv's, they just seem out of place, especially the 12 inch flat screen in the middle of the wall.  Well done Bin 14.  I'll be back.
2013-05-26,4,Went here on a first date last night. Every one on the staff was friendly and helpful in offering suggestions. The wine list is of course varied and thorough. We grabbed a spot at the bar since the tables were booked up, but were offered a table at their outdoor enclosed and heated patio (since it was unseasonably cold for a Memorial Day weekend). Tables weren't cramped at all and the heat was just right. Our waiter was attentive without being obtrusive. He spilled some wine on my date (as an ex-waiter I've been there and done that, so no biggie) and insisted that he wanted to do something to make it up to us. She was wearing black anyway, but he wouldn't take no for an answer. As we already ate and finished our bottle, he topped us off. Good man.We had the 3 Rocks Cabernet, which was big and full. It settled well and had good balance. For food we decided to share the calamari, some mushroom bruschetta and the margherita pizza. The portions were smaller than anticipated and the bruschetta was ordered by the piece, and while good, I did not feel it was worth $4/serving. We sat outside until the patio closed at midnight, but offered a seat at the bar. We were never rushed and the atmosphere was great. You can tell the staff enjoys working there and that they hire very competent and knowledgeable people.
2013-05-21,4,This place boosts of being the first and only wine bar in Hoboken -- find it surprisingly but won't fight it.The place is north end of Washington St (close to 14th street).  I cam here on a date and was impressed by the large selection of wines.  The staff was friendly and accommodating - allowed us some privacy and seated away with tables so close to each other.The place is vegetarian friendly needless to say. Starters --* Go with Homemade Warm Mozzarella with truffle honey.  The cheese is big and honey adds some sweetness to it.  The cheese is fresh and just melts in your mouth* Bruschetta - Wild Mushroom and Roasted Tomatoes would be the recommended options.Main Course -Couple of options to go with for main course and all pastas are made fresh in house.  Since I am huge mushroom fan -- I recommend a Cavatelli with wild mushroom cream and shallots.
2013-05-13,4,Portion sizes are a bit smaller than I expected for the price, but generally things were tasty. My friend ordered a white pizza with spinach and it was the size of a personal pan pizza with a thin crust. It pretty delicious. I ordered two bruchettas which was what it was: lobster and foie gras. I also wasn't that hungry so it was fine. I think...I could've lived without eating the foie gras. I guess I wasn't in the mood for it. It's mostly a wine place and the bartender had lots to say about the wine selection. I'm more of a beer person so I wasn't as impressed. I just had some Sierra Nevadas. There were maybe 10 choices for beers and a whole menu full for wine.It's more for classy folk here. The owner was very friendly and sociable too. He stopped by and chatted with us for a bit and apparently has another restaurant somewhere else.  There's outdoor seating, but my friend and I sat at the bar because it seemed more lively and fun up there. Seating in other places was more intimate and I can see this being a good date place.
2013-05-10,1,We have always been HUGE fans of Bin 14 (and any AD's venture). Visited there again last night to see some disturbing updates to the menu, including Foie Gras. I'm sorry but the image of ducks being force fed until their liver bursts out on to someone's plate is enough to make me lose my appetite. What I loved about Bin 14 was that it was upscale without being pretentious. Smack on some crispy frog's legs and Bin 14 has become the most pretentious spot in Hoboken. What a shame.
2013-05-01,4,Being that I've lived in Hoboken for 4 years now, I'm shocked that i had not stumbled in to this place sooner.With that said, I have been making up for lost time.Been here twice in the past month, and both times I have absolutely nothing but great things to say about this place.Fantastic date spot.  The ambiance is modern, clean, and aesthetically pleasing.The service is great.Both times I have been there, the servers have been extremely informative on the menus and wine selection.Most recently, my girl and I decided to do wine flights - though she is a bit picky when it comes to her wine.  She described to the waitress the tastes she prefers in wines, and the waitress was spot on!We ordered a ton of food and the waitress even said that it was a LOT of food for two people, but we were ok with that.  We wanted to do a lot of tasting.The bruschetta was amazing, we had selected the mushroom and the sausage - both left us dying for more.We also did several cheeses and cures - all which were delicious and fresh.We then had the ricotta and fig pizza, the shrimp and grits, the salmon, and the cavatelli with broccolini.All dishes were fantastic, but my favorite had to be the cavatelli and broccolini!Also, if you have the choice and it's warm outside, definitely choose to sit in the garden, it's great.Definitely would recommend this place to anyone.It's a bit pricey, but it's worth the money.Wish there were more places like this in Hoboken!
2013-04-29,1,I was here friday night with my friend. The place was nice we sat in the back patio. Our waitress was  Kate or Karen (Who Cares). We looked at the wine menu which was ok nothing spectacular. We  asked the waitress if she recommended a sweet red wine. Her answer was OH  we dont have any sweet red wine you can order reisling. We got our glasses of wine and my reisling tasted completely flat. @ $10.00 for  a couple of sips was crazy. We ordered bruschetta they were good. (yo;ur get one bruschetta for the price. I ordered the scallops. I received 3 scallops for $18.00 although tasty one of the scallops was completely raw. I complained to my waitress and with NO APPOLOGIES  said do you want them  well done. I  want them edible/cooked. I didn't know I had an option of how I wanted them cooked, What the hell I didn't order steak. Anyway to make this scenario short. The food was average and extremely pricey. The waitress  was CLUELESS and had the personality of a wet mop with no customer service ettiquete . Needless to say we will not be going back.
2013-04-23,5,We're here about once a week and always have a great time. The revolving wine list allows you to sample different things all the time, and the small but seasonal menu is always delicious. The list is over priced, as is the case with any wine bar, but ignore the mark up and just enjoy yourself. If Maddie is there, you're in good hands- she is the BEST.
2013-04-13,4,This is my new favorite place in Hoboken.   Arrived last night to learn that they were fully booked inside - but that we had options to wait for a seat at the bar or sit outside in their covered/heated outdoor area.   We waited about 15 minutes for seats at the bar.Lots of great wines by the glass and the bartenders were knowledgeable and offered great suggestions.   We split a salad, a small pizza and pasta dish and everything was simply delicious.  They don't offer desserts, which wasn't a big deal for me, but may be for some.I was so impressed by how friendly the entire staff was -- from the hostess, to the bar tenders, to the wait staff.   And they looked like they really enjoyed working there as well.If you are planning to go on a weekend, you really need reservations and need to know that they have set seating times that they will book these reservations at.   And we lucked out with just a 15 min wait for seats at the bar -- the weather was lousy so it kept the crowds away.  I probably would not have enjoyed the bar dining experience as much had it been packed.    And from what I understand, if you come on a weekday, they don't have set seating times you can eat when you want.  This is all a little confusing - but the food, wine and overall dining experience is worth it!
2013-03-28,5,Went to Bin 14 for the first time last night, and enjoyed it every bit as much as any other restaurant in Hoboken - probably a little bit more. Sat at the bar, where the bartenders were extremely helpful, friendly, and honest about their wine and menu. Bin 14 is a wine bar first, but they do have beer and spirit selections. I actually started with a couple bottles of Sierra Nevada Torpedo IPA. The beer selection is macro-craft; good beers from well known breweries from all over.Girlfriend and I split a 3 cheese platter and olives - the cheeses were served with an ample amount of bread, honey, and preserves which is not always found (sometimes at all). I really enjoyed the bleu cheese, my girlfriend the gouda.After that, I got the salmon entree - it was served with red potatoes (think homefries sized), leeks, and an unbelievablly flavorful and light vinaigrette. I told the bartender (we sat at the bar) that it was one of the best tasting salmon dishes I had ever tasted - he said that it was about the 5th time he had heard that on that very night. My girlfriend ordered a pizza with whole wheat crust, however it was not initially prepared in that manner. The bartender apologized profusely, and said he'd make sure he made it up to us. The correct order came out less than 10 minutes later, and when we finished our meals, he offered to buy us an after dinner drink. I had already purchased a nice glass of red wine, and said I'd stick to that - he made sure to fill me up (and then some). My girlfriend was treated to a tasting of some of wine specials and was filled up after deciding which she liked best. The food, drink, and customer service was top notch.Will absolutely return, many many times.
2013-03-25,4,Really nice place. Just keep ordering appetizers and 2 oz glasses of wine, and you could spend all night here.  While not on my list of MUST visit places in Hoboken, if you like wine, then it is.Food and wine selection are very good.
2013-03-14,4,Great village-type wine/"tapas" bar. The "small plates" are Italian-inspired with a good selection of bruschetta add-ins like truffles, various mozzarella infusions and homemade pastas. The atmosphere is rustic and elegant. I went here on a first date and ordered the meatballs and pumpkin ravioli. Their wine list is also pretty extensive. I would recommend this establishment, but call ahead next time around, as apparently this place fills up early.
2013-03-05,5,A little bit of NYC in Hoboken!I've run the gamut of Hoboken restaurants, most of which are neighborhoody and comfortable, so I was shocked to find that Bin 14 is the type of wine bar and restaurant that I tend to frequent in the city.I was there for a birthday dinner, and I was most impressed by the depth of our server's knowledge. He suggested affordable wine and pointed out the dishes that were easiest for sharing. Everything he suggested was mouth-wateringly delicious!I'm always wary of the bill at a tapas restaurant, but it was only about $42 each including tax and tip for each of the six of us. We each got small dishes, appetizers, and two bottles of wine for the table.The only downside is that the restaurant has specific seating times, and they basically kick you out after two hours. But definitely worth a visit!
2013-02-19,4,We probably come a couple times a month since I wrote my initial review. Some of my initial reservations still exist- there's been times we simply could not get a table, they were fully booked for the night. I get that its a smaller place, especially in the winter without the outdoor seating, I guess I'm just kind of a diva and i expect you to find a way to me happy and take my money. Once we got to know the servers, we've felt more welcomed. The food is still amazing and the wine recommendations are so great, we find a new bottle every time that we go on to repurchase.
2013-02-18,1,This place is a joke.I came here, for the first time in a while, ready to order some wine with my girlfriend. After one glass, I said forget it, wine sucks, let me order a beer.oh the horror!Whoever wrote this menu really needs a lesson in beer.La Fin Du Monde, which is an excellent beer, was named a "CANADIAN ALE" under the type of beer. CANADIAN ALE? Seriously? This is a Belgium Tripple. I mentioned this to the waiter and she said well the beers from Canada and is ale in color. REALLY?I get that this place is a wine bar, but common! La Fin Du Monde is an excellent beer, but not at all a "Canadian Ale".
2013-02-05,4,Outstanding wine list and delicious tapas to share for dinner. Start off with a cheese plate (I always have them pick for me) and prosciutto. The meatballs, truffle fries and lobster bruschetta are not to be missed and are are a few of my favorites to order. Bin also serves brunch and I checked that out not too long ago. I had the lobster benedict and it was good but nothing spectacular. Stick to Bin for dinner. My only wish is that they had dessert to send off the meal. Other than that, no complaints.
