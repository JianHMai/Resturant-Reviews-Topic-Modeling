2021-11-03,4,I stopped into Purely Juiced to compose my own acai bowl, which began with a base of almond milk, no sugar added acai, and fresh banana and was then topped with house-made coconut granola and up to 3 free toppings of my choice.  I kept it healthy by adding blueberries, strawberries, and bananas.  The cold, creamy bowl was really tasty, though I wish they had a larger selection of toppings available.In addition, I purchased a package of their Chocolate Maca-Roons, which were made from shredded coconut, almond flour, maple syrup, coconut water, agave, raw cacao, maca, and Himalayan salt.  While these were enjoyable as well, I found it odd that the treats were in containers left on the counter, when they really should have been refrigerated to maintain the freshness of the raw ingredients.
2021-10-22,5,What I ordered: 1. Vinegar shot with wildflower honey (usually get this at Whole Foods and take a shot of it every morning) 2. Blue lagoon juice with extra pineapple (yummy) added a shot of sea moss heaven !! 3. Sea moss gel First off, I must say that I was so happy that I inadvertently bumped into this little quaint juice shop right across from Tony baloneys.  Surprisingly, I was actually going to get ice cream from a rather rude spot, when the powers that be changed my mind, and I made the best decision to spend my money elsewhere. Excellent customer service, and OMG the blue lagoon shake / smoothie was amazing and tasted wayyyy better than icecream, similar texture with all the added health benefits. This place is totally BOMB!! Will definitely return and rave about this spot !! My new go- to in the area !! Thanks
2021-08-20,5,I love this place! Their juices are so fresh and I am OBSESSED with their kale chips!!! I make my own juices but I still love dropping in and grabbing a protein smoothie or a juice! The staff is also super friendly! Highly recommend!
2021-06-04,5,All of their vegan meals and snacks are absolutely delicious! It's even hard to believe their desserts are 100% vegan, gluten free, and use no added sugar (my favorite is the Tiramisu). This is my go-to vegan/healthy spot in Hoboken. Plus, all of their juices actually taste super yummy. Again, no sugar added (or anything aside from fruits & veggies). Great job!
2021-05-16,4,First time we stopped in to try something here. We always walk by it! We tried the nitro cold brew. It's the only coffee they have. We wanted an americano.The nitro cold brew is a bit pricey. It had a light cocoa taste but it was overall bitter and acidic. We wouldn't order it again. Especially with all the coffee shops available in Hoboken lolBUT....the crema de coco was AMAZING!!! Highly recommend!! Also a bit pricey at $9.60. But I would get it again it was so good. Shaken before drank, it's very refreshing and creamy. I love coconut!
2021-03-27,5,Feelin juicey?! Well you better come here. I swear they could cure covid with their amazing vitamin packed smoothies or their spicy flu tea. The soups are also very flavorful. You may question yourself when pay $13 for a smoothie but you just saved your life and you didn't even know it. I've also done their juice cleanses and they are QUALITY- I highly recommend they press the fruits all in house so it's fresh- no powders. Honestly it's as if this shop is in California it's so fresh (and so clean clean)! I loved the green dream and the banana turmeric smoothie (great if feeling under the weather).
2020-10-19,4,Very good variety of juices and raw food. They even have a wonderful selection of vegan desserts. My favorite items are the kale chips- they have 4 different varieties- really good!!!  Everything here is expensive- and I rarely say that for good quality products - but seriously the prices are on the high side for everything. I wish that they would stay open past 6.
2020-08-23,2,I always love trying new places to eat, my best friend is vegan and we wanted to try something new. I came across Purely Juiced and going over their menu I felt like it was something to try. We both individually placed our orders using the online portal around 3-3:10pm yesterday afternoon. (SATURDAY) we waited in the car just to give them time to prep before going in to pick up. Around 3:30-3:35 my best friend walks in to get her order, she walks back after some time and I see she has nothing in her hands. She expressed that her order wasn't even received, the cashier had to print out the order and asked to hold on for a minute. I then walk in after and the same girl says that the dish I picked was not available. (Pesto Fettuccini) Now, is there something wrong with this? Yes. As an established and with everything that's going on due to covid, the last thing you want is for a customer to wait (more than 30 minutes assuming their food is being prepared) to then state that you don't have something. Really disappointing and unprofessional as they should have contacted me to let me know my options. She asked if I wanted to get something else or get a refund. I chose the Walnut Pesto Sandwich. I also purchased a watermelon juice. I mean, why not get something after all that time? I stepped out to have my meal and let's just say, my best friend and I were not impressed. The Walnut Pesto Sandwich was dry and not flavorful at all. The only thing I enjoyed out of the two things was the Watermelon juice. Definitely not going back.
2020-07-19,3,I had the Ginger Zinger (Bananas, Ginger, Raspberries, Beet, Honey, Mint, Coco Powder)  from here the other day! At $11 it was overpriced but tasted fresh and had a perfectly sharp ginger taste. I wish there really was a smaller size option because it was a lot of juice and didn't taste so great after it got warmer. Due to the the lack of size options and $$ this spot is a 3 stars for me. I really appreciated the freshness of their ingredients and the thoughtful combos. It's a great spot for vegans - they had a variety of vegan desserts. This spot was also thoughtfully selling sani wipes/santizer as well! lol Might come back here to try out their bowl options or maybe share a juice with a friend next time!
2020-05-29,5,It's hard to find places that serve raw vegan food that has this much flavor. While it may be pricey I am happy to support any local place that is devoted to serving healthy clean food. Every dish I've tried I love!
2020-05-27,5,Love this place, wish I had known about it sooner. I will probably come here every week moving forward. The juice presses are so fresh! Gratitude is definitely my favorite so far, but all of the juices definitely give me a boost of energy! I can't wait to start trying their smoothies and other food/snacks!
2020-05-05,5,I needed my juice fix during this crazy quarantine and this place did not disappoint.  Super friendly.  Great juices. And they press them all on premise!  Super clean, super fresh, super good.  I also purchased the ceviche, had no idea it was vegan.  I know, duh.  OMG so good and tasty.  Substitute coconut meat for seafood (side note made a quesidillia with it and it was delish)!  They deliver as well.  Definately will return.
2020-04-24,5,I love this place! So many fresh smoothie and bowl options, yummy vegan raw desserts, it's really good. The green bowl is perfection!
2020-02-22,5,The best food and staff! Everything here is a organic and a hit: healthy desserts, soup, entrees, smoothies (try the green dream and anti inflammatory). Always leaves me feeling sufficiently satisfied and guilt free
2020-02-19,3,Ok the smoothies are great and I ordered the ceviche on postmates but it was $11 for the TINIEST SERVING. How? This amount of food is maybe good enough for an appetizer but for 11??? Even appetizers at fancy restaurants aren't that friggin high. Ridiculous. For $11 I shouldn't still be hungry after. Absurd. Should at least put a disclaimer so people who are ordering for the first time know how little they are getting. Just because you're vegan and healthy doesn't mean you can just swindle people like that.
2020-01-19,4,This spot is vegan, so anything protein you get will be a meat substitute. I got the protein taco bowl and it was tasty. It had quinoa on the bottom  and tasted very fresh   I'm happy with my experience and I will come back to try other things on the menu.
2019-12-30,5,Staff here is always super friendly and helpful whenever I asked for recommendations. The food here is pretty healthy compared to the the other restaurants in this block.
2019-12-04,1,Service is terrible.  The cashier never returned my credit card and when I called back 30 minutes later they said no credit card was left behind.  That is BS - I cancelled the card.  The only thing the cashier was concerned with was having me sign the physical receipt - also an antiquated process.  I went back today and of course the member reward machine was not working - that is common.    They only had 3 salads to choose from - 2 of them had black avocado (means not fresh).  They had no salads to purchase.  This was at 7:30AM.  If you are not prepared to sell fresh products at that time don't open.  Once again I pay with a credit card and they leave it on the counter (how about handing it back to me?) and only want my signature - this time I wasn't going to leave without the card.  The store is actually pretty good but unfortunately there is regularly some sort of issue with the service.
2019-11-16,5,HEALTHIEST SPOT IN HOBOKENThis is THE BEST whole food plant-based/vegan option in Hoboken... by a landslide.  Nothing else in this town is even close.  The attention to the quality of their ingredients is spot on and simple - the way it should be. Creative bowls, smoothies, juices, and wraps/sandwiches allows you to try something new and dialed to what your body may need each time.  They seem to actually care about what they're serving and what their customer is consuming. Btw: Ive never posted on yelp and have no idea who owns this spot I'm just a fan and wanted to share.  Thanks for doing what you do.
2019-07-19,4,Coconut cream pie is incredible!!! I love the raw food selection and I appreciate that everything is vegan/gluten free. The staff is very knowledgeable and helpful if you have any questions. They also offer lots of free samples which i also appreciate. The juices are great too, but pricey and portion sizes on the meals and cakes are a bit small for the price but that is to be expected.
2019-07-16,5,Came by for as a quick pit stop for a healthy (but tasty, of course) juice and I was caught by surprise with the amount of selections they have to offer.When I say that whole fridge is packed with different juices, I mean p a c k e d. The team members greeted me and asked if I had any questions, and I just requested the most popular juice with ginger (girlfriend loves ginger). I didn't have much time so I asked to checkout immediately, but then I was told I'd be able to try the juices for purchasing. Good thing that sounded enticing because otherwise I would've bought an unfinished juice haha. The other juice I wanted to try, Liquid Gold, was exactly what I was looking for and I'm excited to come back in order to peer the rest of that fridge.
2019-06-14,2,Feeling suckered after trying lasagna for 10$; piles of spinach wrapped individually with zucchini with barely any tomato sauce or cashew 'cheese' -- not filling /satisfying at all.Drive up to Juice Journey instead for their 10$ lasagna.
2019-04-24,2,This review is based off of the açaí bowl. Absolutely not what I was expecting - the açaí bowls consistency is nothing like I've ever had before, it's more like pudding than an açaí bowl. This store really needs to try açaí bowls elsewhere to understand that this is not what it should be like. And then there were literally 4 slivers of a banana as toppings, where is the granola and all the fruits?????? Do yourself a favor and don't spend your money on this bowl, plenty better options. On the bottom of the "açaí" they add a layer of something biscuit like in consistency. No idea what this bowl was or where their inspiration for it came from. Not ordering here again!
2019-04-01,1,Ordered through DoorDash and the food quality was so poor I couldn't even eat it.  Not sure why it's all brown.
2019-02-15,3,A LOT of choices in here for snacks, premise juices, bowls, meals, prepackaged good etc but nothing really is explained. There's no signage just drawings on the fridge doors, prices are on some packages. It's a little overwhelming. Whenever I try to ask what something is or how it's made the workers seem bothered. One younger kid was pretty upbeat and welcoming when I had an açaí bowl, asked how I liked it, made pleasant small talk. But otherwise the last two times I had run in for a snack the cashier wouldn't even come to the register I'd have to leave cash and just go Bc I wasn't going to wait around al day for $5 coconut ball things lol. As someone who makes a lot of these smoothies or shakes or snacks at home, looking for a fast place after yoga to grab something, my standards for their blandness in the food just won't let me accept paying so much here.I think I'd rather have less options, better quality, and nicer service at Restore across the street.
2019-01-16,5,*** RAW, FRESH, VEGAN***Turning over a new leaf, love?New year, New you? Need a new health ritual?  Want to awaken the vegan guru in you?Say no more babe, I got the juice ;) NOTED:*=*=*=*=Simply juiced is my got to! It has quietly, but noticeably nestled its way in the hearts of the bustling Hoboken community. A landscape dotted with lots fast food, shopping and eatery's. Competition here can be a force to be reckoned with, but with their excellent juices and  inspiring back story, it's no wonder that this gem has marked its territory and been reciprocated with so much love & good energy. So go get familiar and tell them I sent ya.... ;)THE JUICE :)*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=I'm obsessed with the charcoal lemonade (ro water, lemons, raw have, activated charcoal). It's perfectly blended to a sweet healthy taste. I really love the idea of charcoal kick & health benefits. It can truly replace your "Simply Lemonade" "Tropicana " addictions. Highly recommended. 5/5May I add my favorite green juices here are "The Gratitude "( pineapple, kale, apple, lemon ginger) and "The Inner Chai" (spinach, pineapple, apple cucumber, and ginger). Simple, yet harmonious balance of flavors mixed. They never taste overly gingered or gross. These are as green as I like to go. I strongly suggest these for beginners. 5/5THE VIBES*=*=**=*=*=Organic earthy tones, bright, naturally modern with some rustic style end tables & seating.Small layout,welcoming and functional but made for a quick bite and take away Artistic wall quotes and rainbow menusSERVICE *=*=*=*=My bf & I sampled about 4 juices this time around.

I'll alway come back here no matter how many new juice shopsI explore.TIPS:*=*=$10.49 /17 Fl oz$6.49 /11 Fl oz
2019-01-08,5,The chickpea wrap is bomb. I got that and the chickpea soup which was also great, especially when it is rainy and cold outside. Amazing place for vegans and vegetarians or honestly anyone who wants to eat healthy even for dessert. I've had a couple of their smoothies as well and they are awesome. Just wish they'd package their stuff in less plastic, that'd make it perfect.
2018-12-17,5,This was a great stop for something quick and healthy. There were SO many options and add ins for smoothies, along with a variety of juices. They also have vegan soups, sandwiches, and snacks. I found it moderately priced for fresh, healthy food ($9-11 for a smoothie) and was very satisfied. I had the Choco Loco and my husband had the Hempire- we both enjoyed ours. A note: there is not much seating. The tables are small and not meant for long visits. However this didn't bother us!
2018-11-15,1,juices are not bad but service is terrible. The door says it's opened until 8:00pm, while the website says 9:00pm. I showed up today at 6:30 pm and they are closed. Just one example of bad customer service!
2018-11-06,5,Love their healthy wraps and vegan raw cakes. Their juices and shakes are also very tasty. Can't get enough of them.
2018-11-03,2,Was very excited to try this place and unfortunately was disappointed! I got the falafel cabbage wrap which I thought would be falafel wrapped in cabbage leaves but ended up being cabbage leaves with more shredded cabbage inside of which maybe 5% was a falafel spread. Not sure why anyone would eat cabbage wrapped in cabbage! I also got the buckeye protein balls which just didn't taste very good. I'll have to come back and try the juice & smoothies because I still think the place has potential.
2018-11-01,5,Had an amazing juice here last night, inner chi. The guy working was so friendly and explained a lot and answered all of my questions. I will be back!
2018-10-21,5,Service: 5/5Food: 5/5Ambience: -/5Value: 4.5/5Very friendly staff. Samples for just about everything. A bit pricey for the drinks and sandwiches, but seems to be standard for health drink shops.
2018-10-04,5,A little gem on 1st St.Usually I'll pick up a smoothie as my breakfast on my way to work (Amazon and Green Dream are a few of my favorites) and they range in price between $9-$13. The smoothies are a great portion and fill you up quick, I've had to save the rest for lunch on more than one occasion. They also have a huge juice selection but I almost always stick to a small carrot juice. Its a little steep at over $6 for a pretty small bottle- 11oz., which I think is kind of a lot, but I know that it's fresh, healthy and the ingredients listed on the bottle (literally just carrots) are the actual ingredients I am drinking. More of dessert person? Great, me too. Let's move on to macaroons, chia pudding, and coconut cream pie. All amazing and you can try a sample of nearly every dessert they offer. Which you should. Everything they offer is somehow GF and Vegan. I'm not a super crazy health nut, I'm not vegan and don't need to eat gluten free and still really enjoy everything they offer. I feel like I did my body a little favor every time I leave. (Like when you actually make sure you had 8 glasses of water though out your day). Besides the amazing service I've had every time I come here, they have a great customer loyalty program and you can accrue points just by putting your phone number in when you pay. I've gotten everything from 10% off to a free wheat grass shot. My tip for you this time is a BIG one: If you've never had wheatgrass, just know it's supposed to taste that way. You won't like it, but it's like "good for you" or something like that.
2018-08-09,5,I had the blueberry açaí bowl and man was it good! So good, I didn't even stop to take a picture! The service was great, the employees were very knowledgeable and helpful in assisting me on my first visit. I'll be sure to stop in again soon!
2018-07-27,4,What a great hidden gem in Hoboken with delicious smoothies, gf snack and a log of food choices.The service is very nice too. Definitely a place to visit when I'm in Hoboken next time.
2018-07-24,5,I love this place.  Great way to stay healthy.  Carrot juice mango is my favorite!  Get it before my morning workout.  Quite a lift and a morning energizer.
2018-07-09,5,This place stands up to any juice place in NYC or LA! It's the perfect go to after a sweaty work out class when I'm the are. I've only had their green juices like the Gratitude but SO good! Glad they come in bottles and not cups too so you can stick it back in the fridge for later. My only disappointment is in myself because I didn't know they have so many amazing sounding desserts. Time to go back!
2018-07-06,5,I love the staff and the food here. I'm a regular customer. All their stuff is vegan and fresh. I've tried almost everything and nothing has disappointed. My favorites include the chia pudding, anti inflammatory smoothie, coconut pie, Kung flu fighter tea, kale chips, macaroons, and the overnight oats.
2018-06-14,5,I recently moved to Hoboken I don't know how I,would survive without simply juiced!!!! Some places say there organic but truly everything in that store is free from the evil hand of Monsanto I don't want to be extreme but Sloan kettering should study simply juiced and cancer would disapear If that wasn't enough the staff is always friendly!!!! My wife credits them with her ability to live a vegan lifestyle I'm going there tomorrow to get a juice cleanse and the next day and every day after for my breakfast and lunch real talk simply juiced for President!!!! I love that place
2018-06-11,4,I loved my açaí bowl but it took around 20 minutes for the staff to make it- I think they forgot my order. It was worth the wait though a little pricey. Staff was very polite. They also had an interesting selection of vegan desserts and lunch items.
2018-05-21,5,One of my favorite places in Hoboken. The staff here is great, and I love the free samples :) I highly recommend the following: The Hempire, Choco Loco, the Vegan Tiramisu, the Walnut Pesto Sandwich and the Chocolate / Vanilla macaroons.
2018-03-25,5,Best juice and smoothies in town. Also very good vegan sandwiches. Highly recommended
2018-03-07,3,Cool place, great atmosphere and service, and the chia pudding was delicious. But the acai bowl was underwhelming for the price. I feel like I paid a lot for something I could have made at home.
2018-02-17,5,My favorite juice spot in town, the staff is friendly and very knowledgeable about every product and if you would like to improvise on one of the juices they would do it, my favorite drink is probably the hot beverage the kung flu fighter ($7) which consists of cayenne,  lemon/lime, ginger, apple cider vinegar, habanero pepper, raw honey, horseradish, orange and tumeric, onion and a dash of oil from oregano, this has prevented me from getting really sick and is one of my favorite elixirs. Everything is  organic and a lot of options for folks who are vegan, I sometimes also get their E3 live (blue algae shot (a ton of vitamins & only place in town that serves it), also enjoy their wheatgrass shot single or double $3.50/$6, and they also have the reboot immunity shot ($4) booster which consists of ginger, lemon/lime, oil of oregano & cayenne extract which is cold drink. The owner is amazing and so is there staff, shout out to the owner Sung, Jake, Ron Hussle aka Omentah aka slowfi, Rachel (PT Student), Bree & Teague! See you all soon. And if you're in Fort Lee they opened another spot. There is parking for bikes and vehicles but no bathroom. They do deliver and also you can order in advance and will cater.
2018-01-25,5,When I'm on my healthy vegan flow (instead of, ya know, vegan pizza and seitan tacos) I like to come here. Everything tastes good for you and is good for your body. You must try the falafel cabbage roll and walnut pesto sandwich if you plan on eating anything from here. Divine. All of the drinks are great, too. They have so many options that I attempt to try something new each time.
2018-01-25,4,I ordered from the food menu - mac and no cheese and the pad Thai noodles. The food was fresh and healthy. However, I was very surprised about the quantity. Very expensive for the amount you get. I would go back to try the juices.
2018-01-05,5,Amazing, amazing, amazing. The owner of the store himself delivered my order to Jersey City on a snow day when the delivery guys hid away from the snow. I can't thank them enough for the great healthy food they make and their service. All the best to you guys!
2017-12-27,4,I was happy to find raw vegan cakes not too far from my house. My husband got the acai paradise pie as a treat! It was very smooth and tasted very good! I wish they went easy with brazil nuts, which tasted a little bitter.
2017-12-24,4,Great place!!! Hoboken needed more natural and healthy smoothie places. The workers are very nice and helpful and the smoothies are excellent. I wish it was a little cheaper.
2017-11-05,5,Love the smoothies (Le Classique in particular). Wish I could patronize more, but $9 is so expensive for 17oz of liquid. I know, I know, they use the best ingredients! Just hard to part with that much cash (at minimum!) every time I walk in the door!
2017-10-26,5,I absolutely love Simply Juiced! It's a small juice bar with some food and treat options available too. There is some window seating and some bar table seating available that is usually pretty easy to snag as most people aren't staying to eat, although it's an option. My boyfriend and I ALWAYS get the acai bowl. It's our favorite. Everything in the shop is so fresh and healthy but so tasty! Even foodies who don't prefer vegan or vegetarian options can enjoy this spot. They offer taste tests of almost every option so you don't have to purchase something blind and hope for the best.  The staff is always so friendly and inviting as soon as you walk in. Prices are moderate but fair for what they are serving. Also, if you sign up for the rewards program, (which just means basically checking in when you get there) after 10 visits you get any juice free. On occasion they will send out promotional coupons. I love this spot!
2017-10-18,5,Stopped in because I was in the area. I never heard of this place. Looked at the reviews, they looked pretty good. The burrito was awesome. Cool presentation. The greenery and the fruit looked fresh. They made a great drink with protein. It was really clean inside. I would recommend for sure. These guys have a great thing going.
2017-10-18,5,Absolutely loved this place! Knowledgeable staff, great customer service and very reasonably priced,  especially compared to other cold juice press type places. Really delicious smoothies and healthy snacks. Come to Manhattan, we need one of these spots over here!
2017-10-02,5,Delicious smoothies! I took a yoga class across the street at Pavana Yoga and grabbed a smoothy after. The Inflammatory Smoothly hit the spot! It's a perfect location going to work or coming home. They have grab and go juices and smoothies as well as freshly made. Can't beat it!
2017-09-07,4,I just ordered an acai bowl and a choco loco smoothie. The smoothie is great and I like how it came in a bottle for the 10oz size so it was perfect for me to drink while I work. The acai bowl was okay, mine was a bit on the grainy side but I like how there was a crunch to the bowl. Would wanna try other things out with them!
2017-09-04,2,Their smoothies are good and they have a wide variety, but the guy who took my money when I paid had gloves on and didn't change them when he went to go make my smoothie...he proceeded to touch the ingredients with the gloves that handled my money. I guess I should've said something... ended up tossing the smoothie...handling money/then smoothie ingredients...gross. Don't think I'll go back..not worth the high prices if they're not clean or watching out for their customers best interest.
2017-09-03,1,Ordered their bubble gum smoothie(large size) was bottled which i don't mind but was really watered down, very disappointed, not worth the price
2017-09-01,5,The black bean soup was really good! My friend got the banana boat smoothie with coconut water and she loved it.
2017-08-21,5,This review is for the Fort Lee location which is located on Main Street. At the time of this review, I believe that this location has only been open two weeks. My husband and I stopped in to check out the fresh kombucha as well as the cold press health shots. The owners showed us around the store and gave us lots of yummy samples. We tried the cheesecake which was so delicious, the texture was amazing and it contained no added sugar. We ended up buying some health shots as well as some kale chips. Check out this place if you are looking to expand your taste buds and branch out into healthy eating. My only suggestion to the owner would be to include the nutrition information on the label.
2017-08-14,5,I am extremely pleased by the customer service at this place! In regards to my last order, I received what's called a "grab and go". Simply Juice called me and related this information to me. They also sent over their Pitaya bowl which is INCREDIBLE. More business, especially within the food industry should operate like this. I will definitely endorse and revisit this restaurant.
2017-08-11,4,Simply Juiced just opened in my neighborhood in Fort Lee NJ. I popped in to see what they had to my surprised I saw more than juice, Homemade kale chips, salads, sandwiches etc. All looked really fresh and the staff could not have been nicer offering free samples of kale chips etc. Thank you Rachel! I tried a delicious Fruits and Roots Juice. They do Organic, Raw, Non GMO, Vegan, Dairy, Soy and GF. I will definitely go back and try some food. I thought the prices were reasonable nice addition to all the new places on Main Street.
2017-08-07,5,Normally I only post negative yelp reviews because I don't like my favorite restaurants to get all pricey and packed BUT I do make rare exceptions when they are truly deserved. I wish I could give Simply Juiced 6 stars. I was a vegan for almost 20 years, I have travelled all over the west coast and used to live in San Francisco so I know a thing or two about vegan restaurants. Trust me when I say that Simply Juiced is the best of the best. Every single item I tried was flawless. Creative, delicious, nourishing, prepared with love and simply incredible. It made me wish I had two stomachs. Often vegan food falls into the trap of assuming that just because of the veganism it is automatically healthy. This is not true at all. Eat too much processed fake meat and fake cheese and you will ruin your biome. Simply Juiced does not fall into this trap. Another trap is assuming that food that is healthy is automatically delicious. This is not true at all. Fresh organic ingredients are essential, but they must also be prepared with creativity and flavor or it's just a bunch of ingredients in a pile. Simply Juiced does not fall into this trap either. Simply Juiced is absolutely incredible. I will be ordering from them every week I am in town. They are such a cut above the competition that it's not even fair to place them in the same category. Simply Juiced deserves a Michelin Star, and not even some upcycled local vegan version of a Michelin Star, in talking about the real deal here. Simply Juiced takes big fat healthy well digested probiotic sh*ts all over the competition and then starts its day kicking *ss and taking names. Eat here and tip well.Much respect, more of everything please!Dylan(But don't go get a big ego and price me out of the game now)
2017-07-29,5,Smoothies and juice concoctions are on point! I love that they compost and are conscious of the waste that is produced when working with raw/live food. My go-to's are the açai bowl, natural mystic juice, no harm no cow sandwich, and the coconut macaroons! To the wealth of your health!
2017-07-18,2,This was my first visit here. From what I saw this is a true juice bar. Many different types of (pre bottled) juices in different sizes, although on the expensive side. I tried the coconut cream pie and it was nothing to write home about. It was empty when I walked in and the young lady at the counter was very eager for me to hurry up and buy. This place is alright but it also my last visit.
2017-07-08,5,This place is a neighborhood gem.  I drop in from time to time when I feel like I need to healthy pick me up.  The workers are very friendly and seem to know most of the customers that come in.  The prices are a little steep but certainly worth it for the quality of the product.  Healthy food and snacks are also offered.
2017-06-27,3,This place is just ok.  I've been there a few times over the past 1-2 years-this review reflects those visits.Pro's: it's not too expensive (vs other places I've tried it's basically on par), they offer fresh and ready to go (pre bottled), they have healthy snacks, and give out samples!Con's:  the ingredients they write on the cooler doors are pretty hard to read (ask the person at the counter).  Also, it's really nothing special-just run of the mill.  Worth it only if it's close-I wouldn't go out of your way for this...
2017-06-09,1,No, they will not make fresh juice for you, but point to the bottled stuff on the shelf.
2017-05-30,5,had a bad impression at first but the sunflower sushi was amazing. thank you i would recommend to anyone. Also great customer service they really value there customers.
2017-05-24,4,Was looking for some healthier, grain-free breakfast options in the area and happened upon this little gem. They have a lot of options for smoothies, so far my favorite is the Choco Loco. They have a banana chia pudding that also hit the spot, although ordering them both together will set you back about $20 and is a much heavier breakfast than it looks like. Flavorful, fresh ingredients. Only downside is the price tag.
2017-05-23,5,I got the bubblegum smoothie, it is very tasty and not too sweet. The service was very quick, I will definitely stop again on my way to work! I'm excited to try their other smoothies and juices!
2017-04-05,5,Great selections of sandwiches, juices and raw vegan dishes that were ready for pickup and treated with love!!! I enjoyed the special touches they give to the packaging!
2017-03-15,5,Never ever had anything more delicious in my life. It's a pretty penny of expense but it's the best food and juices in the world. Owner is soooo cool. Cashiers so nice and one is a really cute dude with sociable personality and beaming smile
2017-02-16,5,YES! New to the area and finding a new juice spot was priority. I love all the options for snacks and food here in addition to the juice. Everyone is super friendly and helpful if you have any questions!
2017-01-11,5,Best Juice bar in Hoboken and the Tri State area. Staff friendly and helpful and informative. Always been pleased with the products and even if I wasn't the staff helped to rectify the situation immediately. I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone who juices, likes healthy food options, or is considering getting into juicing. They have lot of different options for your particular taste. Go NOW!
2017-01-10,5,By far the best juice/smoothie place in Hoboken. Sure it's a bit expensive, but what spot that serves fresh fruit and vegetable drinks isn't? Definitely worth the price for these delicious beverages. The staff is always super friendly. Very clean and cozy.
2017-01-04,5,This is the best juice/smoothie place in Hoboken (and Jersey City) for so many reasons. The employees are AMAZING - very welcoming, friendly and super helpful. The menu is top notch, ingredients are always fresh and the store is very clean. I love that they have an app to checkin and after your 10th check in, you get a free juice...no annoying punch cards to worry about. I love having this option in town - truly the best.
2016-12-11,5,All of their juices are very fresh and they have a big variety. The people who work there are also very friendly and helpful! I highly recommend.
2016-12-05,5,This place is AWESOME! So many raw vegan options. I was in heaven. So hard to find a place like this in Jersey. Everything was perfectly made and it's presentation just grabbed you right away! The vibe was very positive and Ron who attended me shined through! I bought the Choco Love smoothie, Coconut Cream Pie, Super Burrito, Mega Energy Cookies and Chocolate Macaroons! I will be definitely be coming back here many times! Here are some photos of what I bought! :)
2016-11-15,5,Took my time to write a review however am still impressed! Had a chance to try an acai bowl couple weeks ago - and it was the best acai I've had in my life! Will definitely be back for it! Great folks working at this place also.
2016-11-06,5,Simply Juiced is the juice bar to go to. I live on Long Island and travel to Hoboken on average once or twice a week to stock up on my juices. The reason why Simply Juiced is different than the other Juice/Beverage shops is one word: HEALTH. Simply Juiced beverages are freshly squeezed juices, along with being organic and tasty, which the majority of other juice shops cannot offer. This juice bar offers a variety of different drinks - my favorite ones are the detox drinks which help me cleanse my body after a long weekend of nights out socializing. Along with the friendly staff, Simply Juiced has a very positive environment that promotes health. I am waiting for Simply Juiced to open another location in New York so I can go get my daily fix of tasty organic freshly squeezed juice.
2016-11-06,5,Hands down best premium smoothie/juice place in Hoboken. And Jersey City for that matter.Let's start with the smoothies.  The ingredients are premium and include fresh young Thai coconut water (and frozen coconut meat!), raw honey, fresh mint, Brazil nut butter, hemp milk, black mission figs and, of course, kale.  You can order one of the 10 on the menu or create your own.  I recommend the Bubblegum - it's very lightly sweetened with honey only (you can customize the level). It is unbelievably good, strawberry, pineapple, pomegranate, coconut water, plus acai and goji berries.  You can't go wrong and will love anything you order.Next up: juices.  So all the juices are made in house.  One case is 100% organic.  There are about 20 varieties of green juices.   Orange juice.  Simple pure carrot juice, pineapple, even pear!  Chia seed drinks.  Spoiler alert: charcoal lemonade.  Aloe water.  There's ginger and wheatgrass shots.  And my favorite - creama de coco.  This baby is blended coconut meat and water, creating a smooth creamy masterpiece.  It's a vacation to the tropics in a bottle.Another case is dedicated to raw and vegan food.  Find veggie burgers, raw-o-licious (gf raw oats, coconut, dates), chia pudding, burritos, raw tarts, some salads like the Cuban ceviche.  All of it is thoughtfully crafted and very fresh.Pricing - ranges from $5-10.  Offering a cleanse package for $58 with 7 juices.  It's a really good deal!There's steady food traffic here.  There's something for everyone, even kids.  It's easy to understand why - the owner and his staff are super friendly and knowledgeable.  There's some samples on hand and they are happy to help you find exactly what kind of juice you are craving.  Happy smoothie-ing!
2016-09-27,5,Lots of options/combinations available and the employees were very helpful with suggestions/recommendations. They also allow for some sampling if they have some available, not just of the smoothie but also their other snacks they sell! They're also more than happy to adjust any of the ingredients in the smoothie if necessary to accommodate to customer taste.The smoothie was perfectly blended so you don't have chunks of fruits or vegetables. A little on the pricier side at about $8-$11 but definitely worth every dollar for the service and taste of the smoothies. Very content and will definitely be back for more after my morning barre class :P
2016-09-20,5,Very cute and cool place! The guy at the register was extremely helpful and friendly. Helped me pick out just the right green juice I was feeling at the time. They had many combinations of bottled juices to choose from. Perfect to grab on the go! Also the option of having a juice/smoothie made on the spot. I will be back when I'm in Hoboken
2016-09-07,5,I cant say enough about this place - it is absolutely amazing! No matter what time of the day you go or who is working, the employees and staff are so incredibly helpful, welcoming and warm. It is SUCH a good vibe and is a genuinely a pleasant experience from beginning to end. I've tried their juices, smoothies and breakfasts and they are all fresh, healthy and delicious! The best part? They have samples of most of their stuff for you to try before you buy. If you're going to be spending that much $$ on a drink etc it is nice they let you taste it first - a lot of places dont do that. Thank you Simply Juiced for coming to Hoboken! :)
2016-08-25,5,Great simple delicious juice and vegan dishes. I have eaten there several times because it was so good I had to come back. I have had salads , Desserts and juice, and it all has been excellent. The staff and owner have been very courteous, helpful and friendly . If you are a vegan or vegetarian or just want to try something different, you must check this place out !!!!Although I have moved a bit further away from Simply Juiced, it is still worth the travel to enjoy all the goodness . Can't wait to chase all the good treats .
2016-08-23,5,Great organic juice store in Hoboken. Stumbled upon them while doing a quick tour of the town. I was in the mood for a green juice so I checked out simply juiced. When I walked through the door I was greeted by Sung the owner who is extremely nice and knowledgable about his products. He runs a Very nice and clean operation. They have samples of all their juices smoothies and snacks. The chia pudding is very good. I took some goodies to go. Check them out.
2016-08-09,4,this place is mad cute!! cozy shop with fridges chock full 'o fine juices, smoothies and other concoctions. the names+profiles of the drinks are a bit difficult to read on the glass but i like the handwritten-touch! the girl at the register was friendly and let me know that you could basically sample anything and everything you wanted, in and out of the fridge. i helped myself with abandon. a guy who i'm assuming is the manager/shift leader came by to ask me how i was doing and if i was interested in anything, and asked me if i'd ever tried chia pudding before. told him i never had, so he handed me a small container of their chia pudding--good stuff! a lil like rice pudding with fun textureended up getting a small bottle of dirty chai to get me thru a weekend shift. kept well in the fridge and was a great kick of caffeine and chocolate to make my day. relatively decently priced drinks (tho the fresh smoothies seemed a bit absurd for $11+) with friendly customer service? will definitely swing by again during the hot weather when i'm around! :^)
2016-07-26,5,Very friendly staff and you can sample nearly everything! Hands down one of the best healthy food spots in Hoboken!
2016-07-17,4,After my session, my trainer & I were discussing places in Hoboken that offer healthy drinks. We threw a few names around and why they weren't consistent and that's when Simply Juiced came up.. so I had to check it out for myself. The place is super clean, it has a few tables to sit in, and a grab & go option (juices, salads, & snacks). I was greeted by the nice lady behind the counter, who asked if it was my first time. Based on what I told her I was looking for, she recommended the Green Dream($11): Banana, kale, Brazil nut butter, vanilla extract, dates, rice protein, and almond milk!  It sounds like a lot but the mix was perfect. A great post-workout drink ..I just wish it was bigger for the price tag. I was impressed with the varieties available. The staff is so helpful so don't hesitate to ask questions. There were plenty samples that I was offered to try. They also have a reward system based on how many drinks you purchase, all you do is input your cell #. . Looks like I'll be heading to #SimplyJuiced after my workout!
2016-06-30,5,Excellent juice and excellent service! Just tried them for the first time today. I ordered the Inner-Chi green juice, and it is delicious!! I cannot wait to go back again!
2016-06-28,5,This place is my new favorite.  Their juices, smoothies, desserts and snacks are fantastic.  I tried several different items and I liked them all.  I'm so glad to have found a place that has organic AND delicious products.  I will definitely be a new regular.
2016-06-24,5,Amazing chia seed pudding, charcoal lemonade and I asked for a sweet green and that was delicious too!  The gentlemen helping me even had me try a sample before I bought which was nice! Def coming back! I called other Hoboken juice spots before coming into this one - and the employees couldn't even tell me what "green juices they had that have a sweet flavor" - which is what led me here!
2016-06-14,5,I was in Hoboken for work one day, after a night of too little sleep, too much booze, and bad food.  I was parking my car and saw Simply Juiced so I decided that maybe a smoothie would be good for me.  I couldn't have been more right!  I consulted with a very helpful gentlemen(who it turns out was one of the owners), and he recommended the Ginger Zinger.  Before I was even done I felt better.  The place was bright, clean, had an open feel, and the staff all seemed happy. I'm in Hoboken regularly and will definitely be back to see what else they have to offer.
2016-06-13,5,I work just across the street and Simply Juiced has become a fast favorite. It's so easy to pop in and get a quick, healthy and delicious vegan meal on the go. Super friendly, helpful and genuinely excited staff, tasty smoothies/drinks and amazing bites.My go-to's are the dirty chais (great light pick-me-up) and the super burrito. Can't wait to work my way through the menu.
2016-06-02,5,My new favorite place in hoboken. I live in Port Imperial - the closest vegan option is in hoboken. I usually pickup in the city and bring takeout home.I now have a local option. Yay! It's a bit pricey, but all vegan places are. Quality ingredients don't come cheap. You get what you pay for.
2016-05-31,3,Cute little juice/smoothie bar with three tiny tables - definitely a grab-and-go place. Everything is vegan and organic, which I really appreciate. I had the "bubble gum" smoothie which was very tasty. As others have said, it's definitely overpriced. $9-$11 dollars for a small (12 oz) smoothie is a little ridiculous.Really friendly and helpful staff, and they let us have lots of samples which was great. But I'd only recommend it if money is no object for you.
2016-05-03,5,I love how fresh and creative the juices, smoothies, and food is, plus the soups have been fantastic. Great vegan place that is pricey but they all are and I don't feel like I'm getting ripped off here... they really care (and usually you can have a sample of something). So glad I found this place.
2016-04-26,5,Please come to Jersey City!!! Their food is SUPER clean and tastes ridiculously good. This place does it really well. Legit organic, cold pressed, raw, etc. People working it are kind and helpful. Great energy.Soups are delicious and made fresh. Smoothie options are awesome. Their green juices are the best I've had outside of Bali. That's sayin a lot. I love the Gratitude Juice, spicy pickle sandwich and the avocado/kale smoothie. (And jambalaya soup when they have it)They also deliver which is really convenient and they give you samples.  My go to!!Also-- it's hard to get this kind of quality, organic, truly fresh food from a restaurant/store. This quality is equal to what I make at home and the prices make sense to me, knowing how much I spend on ingredients myself. They are high and if you care about the quality, it's worth it!
2016-04-11,2,Ordered the zucchini lasagna and the acai bowl and my total came to about $24. (I ordered from Seamless, so that's including service fees/tip) Delivery took about an hour.Everything was delicious and obviously tasted fresh but like another reviewer said, the portion sizes are ridiculous for the price. I understand that it's organic but I've been to other organic places who don't charge and arm and a leg, and I get a good amount of food. I really wouldn't consider the lasagna entrée an entrée. It's more like a snack, honestly.I don't wanna be too harsh with this review because I have no idea how much it costs to even make healthy and organic foods. But I do kind of agree that there needs to be serious price/quantity adjustments. I feel like a huge sucker spending this much on what I would consider snacks.
2016-04-08,5,"let food be thy medicine" - simply juiced is the embodiment of this philosophy.nothing but pure love for this place - i honestly can't say enough good things. they've continued to grow and expand, constantly adding new and seasonal items, and the passion the owners have for their business absolutely comes through. a few days ago i had an experience similar to those mentioned by a few others - i went in sick as a dog and was recommended an immunity booster shot and a power punch. downed those, repeated the next day - and voila, feeling a LOT better today. i've also been doing a green smoothie in the morning for breakfast - can't remember the name but it's green and has brazil nuts in it. totally hits the spot and keeps me full til lunch. the prices are very competitive and absolutely fair for what the product is (not to mention astronomical hoboken rents and fair wages for employees). the cost of making such products at home using organic and high quality ingredients is not far off - i used to make my own green juices at home, a LOT of produce goes into a single drink - not to mention the hassle! peace, and looking forward to many happy returns!
2016-04-04,2,giving 2 stars only as the food tasted great. If i had to rate the food only, i would give this place 4 stars, however, the quantity for the price they charge is a JOKE. We ordered a sandwich and raw pasta entree, the sandwich would fill a kids belly only half was and the raw pasta was about the size of a condiment... more like pickles given as a condiment along with an entree you order. A message to the business owner, please either adjust your quantities or the prices of your items...
2016-03-25,5,Thank you for helping me survive the winter. :) With a baby getting sick all the time and running on no sleep - this winter was rough! You saved me with your immunity shots and power punch juice. One shot + juice for dinner and another for breakfast the next day and I was feeling fabulous. It's the best cold remedy around.
2016-03-01,5,Tried this on my way home, the smoothie was very good. I'm not sure if it's good that they are open when I head to work. I see more smoothies and kale in my future!
2015-12-31,5,We stopped by today for the first time.  My son had mouth surgery and is on a liquid diet.  The woman behind the counter was very helpful and friendly and let him try a few different kinds.  We got the anti-inflammatory and it was the first thing my son has drank on his own without me nagging him.  We will definitely be back soon and even after he is recovered!great addition to the neighborhood!!
2015-12-17,1,Outrageously overpriced. The pad Thai, which is listed under "entrees", is $10. But it's like a small snack. It literally comes in this tiny, prepackaged container. I'm a 115 pound girl and I would have to spend at least $25 to get full from eating here. Complete waste of my money.
2015-12-15,5,As soon as I walked in I felt an awesome vibe. The girl at the counter was very helpful and knowledgeable about all of the items on the menu. She even provided me with multiple samples before I made my final purchase. They have a great variety of smoothies, juices, and plenty of vegetarian options( sandwiches, wraps, pastas, among others). I ended up choosing the green dream. It was made to order and completely delicious. I'll definitely be sure to come back.
2015-11-11,5,First things first, EVERYTHING is organic!  Hallelujah!  Then potion master King knows what he's doing with his creative and purposeful mixtures.  He puts a lot of thought into each drink combination and he has a lot of knowledge when it comes to the healing aspects of each vegetable and fruit.  (Reminds me of an acupuncturist with their healing secrets with herbs and essential oils.)I'd be curious what drinks he comes up with during the winter since it's cold weather now and juicing can make a body very cold.   One thing I'd like to see is a really strong greens drink that really knocks me on my butt.  Where the kale, collard greens, and dandelion greens really rock it.Juice Press has something like that.
2015-11-01,5,Everything I have tried here has been amazing and the staff are super knowledgable and helpful. Even my picky 6 year old will drink the smoothies and juices! Banana boat smoothie and the greens and grains salad are my favorite.
2015-10-26,5,I'm so glad a good juice bar finally came to Hoboken!  From raw food to healthy juices and smoothies this place is even better than Juice Press (which I'm also obsessed with), because the owner and employees take the time to get to know their consumers and help them choose foods and juices based on their needs and goals.  Prices are expensive, but on par with every other juice bar / raw food place.
2015-10-25,5,This is a great place to get yummy raw food and healthy smoothies.  The staff is so nice and informative. Highly recommend.
2015-10-15,5,SUPER helpful staff and just genuinely nice people. The food is all reasonably priced and tastes good! Definitely a repeat customer.
2015-10-12,5,I've been craving a green smoothie. Walked in and wanted to try every one of their smoothies - They all looked amazing! The smoothie was so delicious I came back the next day. Highly recommend this place - custom or their own creation you won't go wrong! I will be a frequent patron
2015-10-09,4,As a brand new Hobie (Hoboken resident), I was excited that there were a sprinkling of organic, healthy cafes in the area (and I wish there were more!). Simply juiced is perfect when I am craving an organic, vegan snack. The food is pretty good. Prices are a bit steep, but comparable to what you would find in NYC. The Mexican salad with walnut taco meat is one of my favorites items on the menu. I wasn't a fan of the pad thai because it seemed a bit bland. I haven't tried their juices yet, but they always have samples near the counter (and the coconut yogurt sample was pretty good). The people who work there are really nice too. I hope this places does well and stays open!
2015-09-19,5,I am 9 months pregnant and I was feeling like I needed to be rejuvenated! So I walked downstairs to try simply juiced out. I walked in and the place was so clean and bigger then I thought it would be. They have juices / food in a refrigerator and all the ingredients were written on the doors. A very nice gentlemen walked over to me and asked if it was my first time there and helped me pick out exactly what I needed. He also gave me a paper menu- it makes it a little easier to pick out what you want! He gave me samples of juices and the chia pudding. So good!  I ended up with  gratitude, Nervana, and chia pudding for later.I honestly feel more energized! Can't wait to try more from this place. It is dangerous that it is right next to my apartment.
2015-09-08,5,Couldn't wait for this place to open and it has not disappointed.   Super fresh and delicious, and very healthy.   To me it is the epitome of clean eating I feel so good after every visit.   The staff is amazing, very helpful in explaining every item and always willing to give samples.   Not cheap but comparable to other places offering similar options, but I feel their selection is larger than most and again, very tasty and fresh.   Love that it is right around the corner from me!
2015-09-06,5,FINALLY! We have been waiting for you Simply Juiced here in Hoboken FOREVER!  We are so happy you are here. I've had the juices, desserts, yogurt, salads and it is all fresh and delicious. This is the healthiest place in Hoboken...you will feel good about eating the food and supporting a local business that is in the best interest of your health.  The owners are so inviting and they take time to educate you and support you. This is the real deal - ORGANIC!  No sense wasting money on non -organic juices and smoothies when you can now get the real thing right in Hoboken.  Congratulations to the owners and thanks for making Hoboken the home for your business.
2015-09-04,5,Stopped here for the first time today.  Had the Mother Nature juice.  It was great, really fresh.  Owner was really helpful.  Can't wait to go back and try their food!
2015-08-30,5,Everyone is so nice. Great options!! Delicious juice!!! Everything is fresh! Definitely returning for more!! :)
2015-08-28,5,Great new spot!  So clean and spacious.  Loved my green juice and the prices are so reasonable!  Service was really good too!  Hope this place does well because I definitely will be going back.
2015-08-23,5,Finally, something GOOD/GOOD-FOR-YOU has opened up near me! I had a smoothie today and it was delish! (some kind of chocolate/banana/goji berry one, I can't remember the name) Such a friendly owner as well! I will be going back FREQUENTLY, and once they are on Seamless, ordering FREQUENTLY.  :D
2015-08-19,5,I would go to Simply Juiced over Rejuice a Nation any day. Prices are competitive, but taste, freshness, and cleanliness win at Simply Juiced. Plus, King (the owner) is the man. Marc
2015-08-10,4,Visiting from Portland,  I was searching for a quick refreshing morning meal. I was relieved to find Simply Juiced. After trying a few of of their samples,  I was hooked.  I enjoyed the 'Mother Nature' and cashew butter and Jam sandwich.  Nourishing food for the body and soul. Great way to start my busy day!
2015-08-08,5,Their food is all natural, no heat added, juices are cold pressed. It's healthier than anything you'll ever eat. But what's most important is that it tastes amazing. The La Classique smoothie packs a punch with its berries and Choco Coco smoothie is sweet and subtle, making it the perfect morning drink. Many of their drinks are packed with protein which will help keep you full for longer. I know there are some sweet tooths out there and this place will cater to you too. Their coconut cream pie is my favorite. Very creamy and sweet with coconut. Lastly, the atmosphere is very friendly and the setting is very cute. So if you're ever in the Hoboken area, check this place out!
2015-08-04,5,I am SO happy this place opened. Juice: Their juices are fresh pressed, not pulverized, which keeps a lot of the nutrients intact. The GRATITUDE juice is SO good. One of my fav juice combos and I've had a lot of juices in my lifetime. They have free samples of the most popular juices!Food:The walnut pesto sandwich was super savory and flavorful. I want them to sell the walnut pesto in jars lol!  Collard green rolls are light and filling, love the sauce. Pad Thai was sold out! I heard it was really good from a lot of friends so I'm def coming back to try itDesserts:Goji Chocolate cheesecake is so rich and light and creamy and deliciousCoconut cream pie, I can't believe this is all raw and healthy because it's sinfully good. Chia pudding - they gave me a free sample of this and I almost bought another dessert lol too bad I was stuffed. But will def come back for this when I come for the pad Thai. Service:The staff working there could not be more pleasant and gracious. They kept passing out free samples and really knew their product. Everyone there seemed to really care about putting healthy organic products into the world. I'm so happy a good juice bar finally arrived in Hoboken, and what's awesome is they offer healthy vegan lunch choices too.  They have way better prices than Buddha Press too honestly. Happy I found my new lunch spot. :)
2015-08-03,4,Positives:Staff is friendly and building is a great spaceThey offer samples/taste tests of different juices and smoothiesGood pricesGood FlavorsOpportunity to Grow:More variety for Green JuicesAcai bowls far short -  I like a solid bowl with all toppings visible. Bright, colorful and enough to be a meal replacement ( even if that means hiking up the prices a bit)
2015-08-03,5,The real deal. Best juice spot from Hoboken to jersey city. Delicious and thoughtful. One of the few times a place opens and just can wow you with quality and service. Well done and looking forward to trying more items each visit. The oatmeal is something really special. The Hempire and Choco Coco were awesome.
2015-08-02,5,Yay, I finally got in!They are beyond friendly and helpful and pointed me to some samples as well as a lovely bottle of liquid gold...er emerald...because green. I tried Super Natural and Kale-ldoscope as well as the pad thai. Yum. I will be back, obvis.
2015-07-29,5,I went here on my way to work and was given so many delicious free samples. It was hard to choose because one thing was better than the next. I live around the corner and have been dying for a place like this in Hoboken. I had the Ying Yang Chia pudding and was taken to a cacao/vanilla velvety dreamland. Everyone was well informed, passionate, and friendly AND the product is absolutely FANTASTIC!  I wish them all the best.
2015-07-29,5,I came in here once on my way home from the gym and once before work in the morning. Not only is it completely delicious, healthy and FRESH, but you can tell the people there truly care about what they are doing. I've been given guidance as to what is available and free samples each time. I live close by and plan on being back here often! I wish this new business the best of luck!!! Hoboken needs you!
