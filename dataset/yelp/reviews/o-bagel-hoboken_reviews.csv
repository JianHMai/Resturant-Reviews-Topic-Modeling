2021-10-25,5,Had to hit my favorite bagel spot in Hoboken for their brand NEW "hayride" bagel with fall finally here, and you know they did not disappoint..now I know you're wondering; French toast bagel with caramelized onion, sausage, egg, apple butter and cheese whaaat? Yup, I felt the same way. However, these guys know how to blend flavors y'all and this is just another example! Fall in a savory bagel right here and hits every flavor note (besides spice, and that's good) and just works perfectly with a nice coffee/tea on a fall morning. Give it a try and tell me I'm wrong!
2021-10-24,3,Bagels were just ok. Got the BeeSting which was dynamic in its own right but the actual bagel was just alright. The bagel lacks flavor but the portion sizes and sandwiches are really where it's at. The pricing could be a bit better for what it provides but at $5 for a bagel with cream cheese and $8-12 for a sandwich, the money could be spent better otherwise. ProsPortion SizeEfficiency - service was really quick - the wait was around 10 minutes on a Sunday morning once the order was in Kind StaffMultiple locations ConsLacks variability Just bagels with cream cheese options limited
2021-10-14,5,Not only are the bagels delicious- but they're different! Every few months they come out with a new bagel sandwich and they all do not disappoint. This place has 4 shops open now, with the first one opening in a small town in Centralish/North Jersey. They clearly do very well to expand so much!The Bee Sting breakfast sandwich is one of my favorites! It's a bagel with crispy bacon, scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, scallion cream cheese, and honey! The different ingredients mix together to create an exhilarating flavor! A classic that I usually tend to go for is their Jersey Debate. This is a bagel of your choice with Taylor ham, egg, and cheese. Although this is sold at every bagel place in NJ, o'bagel tops all!Their bagels are crispy on the outside yet warm and doughy on the inside. I tend to like my bagels toasted but when I go here, I do not have to make them toast it as they're already nice and crispy as is! Check out their Instagram to see all the new sandwiches they come out with! Definitely the best bagel place in Hoboken!
2021-10-12,4,Let me start by saying the only reason I gave them a 4 was because I ordered a gluten free bagel. Let's just say it was chewy, but I've never had a good gluten free bagel. I had a breakfast sandwich which itself was good sans bagel.  Order was ready in minutes.  Staff was friendly. I hope they perfect their gluten free bagels so that I can hurry back.
2021-10-05,1,Ordered here 3 times. 1st time, the order came room temp, but we chalked it up to delivery and after we heated it up ourselves, it was promising. Decided to give it another chance. 2nd time was lukewarm but the bagel sandwich was put together well and the order was correct and tasty. I decided to order a third time. ice cold, I mean like not cooled down during the delivery but never heated, and chaotically put together - the eggs weren't even on the bagel but tossed on the side, no hashbrown liked paid for and on the receipt, i asked for toasted bagel and it wasn't, and there was no indication that the bagel, eggs, bacon, cheese was ever heated, just thrown on bagel (if it even made it on) and out the door. The order came 20 minutes early so I don't understand what the rush was? I much rather it come on time or even 20 minutes late and be correct and warm and eggs on the bagel this time. for the price of the food , and it is pricey for what you get, and the delivery fee on top of it, it is really disappointing the absolute lack of care and quality control. Don't feel like wasting more money here in hopes the order will come correct and a touch warmer than room temp. feel dumb for even giving a third chance, but hard not to when clearly from the photos on the 5 star reviews, SOME people are getting good quality from here. Wish they'd tell me what the secret is.
2021-09-15,5,Recommended as a prime spot by someone who lives nearby. Ambiance: I ordered 3 sandwiches online on a Sunday and got notified about order status, which was very helpful considering this is one of their busiest days (it was about a 45 minute wait). I was able to time our walk to their location. They have a walk in area and also an order window where you can pick up your order when it's ready. Price: Pricing was great considering its location and quality/quantity of the food.Pros: The breakfast sandwiches were awesome! I kept it plain with a Taylor Ham sandwich on a cinnamon raisin bagel, but the others in my group got their other sandwiches. I look forward to trying their specialty breakfast sandwiches in the future. Cons: The wait time at 45 minutes, and then a little longer once we got there, but it was Sunday morning and the notifications we got allowed us to time our walk their from an apartment. Overall: Definitely a great recommendation and glad I tried it! They make it easy to order and pick up food which is great way to stand out in Hoboken with so many delicious options.
2021-09-01,4,I am slowly making my way through their menu but this is the first restaurant in Hoboken I've been to twice so I would say they are really good!The bagels in general - amazing the texture of them is spot on! The only issue is they don't sell garlic bagels :( I have only every gotten plainLox n loaded - Amazing! The flavor combination and the amount of salmon you get is great. Bee Sting - this so far is my favorite bagel! The flavor combinations are great! I ate this so fast and immediately wanted another!Watchung Warrior - I got this bagel for breakfast and it is not a breakfast bagel. This bagel would be better for lunch but I probably would not order again because I was not the biggest fan of the pastrami and the other ingredients didn't do anything to enhance itThis place can get really busy so be prepared to wait 5-20 minutes for your bagel (or order online before hand for less wait).
2021-08-28,5,OMG the best bagelsSoft inside and crisp outsidePlease bring a store to HB CAOnly sad part is no low/nonfat cream cheese of peanut butter
2021-08-18,5,Just walked in like 20 mins ago I'm only in town for a few days and I walked in and was extremely welcomed by the gentleman at the front and recommended the bee sting and I'm not a huge fan of onion flavors or spices but my jaw dropped at how flavorful this was! Great experience will come here every time I'm in town in the morning... 5 Stars! - Joe M.
2021-08-13,5,Okay obagel, you redeemed yourself. I did pickup and it was ready on time. Sesame bagel is good.
2021-07-28,5,Bee Sting and Lox and Loaded were amazing ! The service here is so great and fast! We will definitely be back to have these again.
2021-07-26,2,Their bagels and sandwiches are undeniably good. However, well over $5 for a plain bagel and cream cheese and bagel sandwiches generally in the range of $10 - $13+? Offensive.I have lived in Hoboken / the JC area for the entire time this store has been open on Washington Street and have purchased too many bagels and sandwiches to count. However, what they have done raising prices into the stratosphere is obscene and detached from any rationality. It is one thing to raise prices in an attempt to "claw-back" some lost income from Covid. It is an altogether different story to offensively abuse the pursestrings of loyal customers.I will not be back.
2021-07-24,3,This place used to be really good. I'd come here a lot. Now they always mess something up. Sometimes no cheese, no ketchup, bagel isn't toasted. Overall kind of fed up with it and have switched bagel shops. Sad because the bagels are great but they need to get it together in the kitchen.
2021-07-19,4,Me and my friend who was visiting me in hoboken decided to check out O'bagel because of their TikToks we kept seeing. We ordered online and got a few calls because they were out of a few bagel types. I got the jalapeño popper sandwich with salt pepper ketchup and my friend got the classic BEC with plain cream cheese. They were both very good except for I wish the bagel had been toasted. Definitely not the best quality bagels in Hoboken (I prefer Hoboken Hot or Bagels on the Hudson) however I will definitely be revisiting for their bagel sandwiches.
2021-07-12,2,These are the best bagels in Hoboken BUT I was in there last week and a MOUSE came running out of the corner of the kitchen and past my feet. I told the cashier that was checking me out at the time - his response was "oh shit, really?" and then proceeded to do absolutely nothing about it. Really recommend you guys clean up the place and get rid of the rodents - I don't feel comfortable eating from here until this is taken care of.
2021-07-10,2,This place always has been good. But what the heck is this for 7 dollars. They barely put any lox spread on the bagel. Disappointing
2021-06-27,1,This review breaks my heart because I am reviewing this location specifically because it was not a good experience. I have been to the other O'bagel location in Stirling and gave it raving reviews.Unfortunately, this location, in Hoboken is extremely busy. I walked up and saw people waiting but noticed a relatively short line for ordering so we thought we would give it a try. We had about 40 minutes before we had to meet a little bit further down the road so we assumed 40 minutes would be enough for two bagels.We ordered a standard sausage, egg, and cheese on a plain as well as a plain with butter. We waited 20 minutes and nothing came out. Also to note, they still have their bathroom closed so we could not even use a bathroom as paying customers while we waited.I approached the woman handling orders twice. The first time was to check on my order after about 15 minutes. Typically, a bagel shop cranks out your order in about 10-15 minutes - not super weird to hope for. The second time I asked, I noticed others who ordered after me had gotten their orders and left maybe about 20-25 minutes of wait time. She said it was "coming right out" though I don't believe I saw that she actually checked. After another 10 minutes, I went into the cashier for assistance because I was now late to my meeting down the street. It was now almost 35 minutes for my two bagels. The cashier was able to check on the actual prep line and got my sandwich out in about another 5 minutes. I definitely think there was a mix up and I wish the woman at the window took my concern a bit more seriously because 40 minutes for a plain bagel and a bagel sandwich is not okay. We didn't have a good experience and no one seemed to care or take my concern seriously. Because we were late for our meeting we could not eat until an hour and half later which meant that the sandwiches were cold and stale. I will not be back to this location but I will continue to visit O'bagel in Stirling because I really enjoy their good service and fresh bagels.
2021-06-25,5,Ordered bee sting today, very flavorful. It was $8.80 incl tax, more expensive than what I usually paid for my bagel, but it's worth it!Will come back to try more
2021-06-12,5,Quality bagels. Always so busy on the weekends so I typically call and place an order for pick up. My go to bagel place in Hoboken. Every breakfast and lunch bagel is incredible! Definitely recommend
2021-05-28,5,My fiancé and I went here based on a local's recommendation, and wowwww we are so glad we tried O'bagel! First of all, the people are so friendly here! They're kind, courteous and helpful. They made conversation and gave great bagel sandwich recommendations.Obviously, we have to review the bagels. We had the bacon egg and cheese and the Ridge Diablo.The bagels were so fresh and all the ingredients were quality. They were big and soft in the inside, but firm on the outside. A perfect bagel.The bacon, egg and cheese was a classic. You can't go wrong with this one! The Ridge Diablo was also amazing, if you're a little more adventurous. The chipotle flavored sauce was delicious and to die for! Can't wait to come back and try some more!
2021-05-08,5,Greatest sandwich on a bagel I've ever had. Not completely sure the name of the sandwich but a Diablo on a cheddar jalapeño bagel is a must!
2021-05-04,2,Kinda wish I was able to step in and experience what it's indoor dinning is like but, It is straight forward and to the point it has bagels. Nothing too fantastic about them. On the "BEC" the highlight was the B for bacon and not the bagel. Nice staff though.
2021-05-01,2,Good bagels. Veggie cream cheese is AWFUL. Terribly sour and not tasty at all. Huge disappointment as we bought a half dozen bagels and a container of the stuff.
2021-04-30,1,Very poor customer service. I ordered egg whites on a bagel and I simply asked if they could make it omelet style (rather than the eggs broken up) and the clerk said "sorry we don't do that"... When it's very clear that it's something very easy to do.It's bad enough that I paid $8 for something that literally costs $0.50 to make..... Please get the basics right. Will NEVER come back.
2021-03-30,5,Love them! They are fantastic a nice crusty outside on the bagels with a nice chewy interior. The sandwich combinations are also amazing! Highly recommend
2021-03-28,5,I love their breakfast sandwiches- the best in Hoboken! I recently tried their new one (the bee sting) and loved it. In light of covid I have been ordering ahead which is great because there used to be really long waits on the weekends.
2021-03-14,1,Absolutely the worst customer service of any place i have been to in my entire life. I am not even sure how a business like this stays open. First off, if you have an online order there is a pickup time generally about an hour and a half after you order. I went there about 50 minutes before that pickup time. Told the guy "listen i understand if it wont be ready until the pickup time, but if you cant expedite, i am on a strict time schedule can i just cancel it?" Basically told me he would expedite it no problem. Go up again 20 minutes later and he says "oh yes sorry this will be ready in under 5 minutes".... another 5 minutes goes by and this guy says "hey man sorry but it still hasn't hit the pickup time listed when you made the order"... i ultimately cancelled the order. Why would he just bring this up now as i mentioned i was on a strict time schedule? I was in no way annoyed at the order system, i get it. However, the way they handled my request to expedite and ended up telling me i have to wait until the pickup time was absolutely absurd. WHY NOT CANCEL IT FOR ME LIKE I ASKED INSTEAD OF HAVING ME WAIT FOR 40 MINUTES. Absolutely awful and will make sure they receive no business from me or any friends moving forward
2021-03-11,5,My absolute favorite bagel spot on the East Coast!!! Staff is always friendly and courteous. Bagels are freshly baked, lightly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside- nothing like your grocery store bagel. I always stop by this place whenever I'm in Hoboken. My recommendations are the Ridge Diablo and the Bee Sting. Opt for the hash brown inside, you won't be disappointed!
2021-03-08,5,Can I tell you all about this bagel? I wanted to scream with how delicious and flavorful it was. Literally love in every bite. Now I can cross this place off my bucket list! Family owned and bagels made fresh in house! They even have a jumbo bagel if you want to completely devour and enjoy with friends and family! Wish I lived closer I would have these everyday. I ordered the The Bee Sting,The Southern, the Classic Becky and the Jersey debate. Amazing! Very filling and topped with everyone's favs! I personally loved the the bee sting, they add Mike's hot honey which gave everything such a unique taste and that bang! Wish I was able to dine in but it was FREEZING OUT, not sure if they do have dine in at the moment, I did see a few chairs outside but again it was freezing. Make sure you check this place out, staff very friendly and well organized, loved it. You also get a free hot coffee with Yelp check in!
2021-03-08,5,Wow!! I stopped eating bagels for a while bc they didn't seem worth the carbs but these bagels are absolutely worth it!!  Honestly the best bagel I've had in a long, long time. Toasted bagel with scallion cream cheese was perfect - light, airy, crunchy and they did not skimp on the cc. Pastrami and egg was also delicious. I'll be back for sure!!
2021-03-06,5,I think they have the best bagels in Hoboken - only complaint is there's always a long line.  Great bagels and sandwiches
2021-03-02,5,Obagel knows what is up!!! I absolutely love their French toast bagels and always get it toasted with peanut butter  super friendly staff and always serving the best bagels AND vibes
2021-03-02,5,The best fluffiest bagels around!!! The breakfast sandwiches are unique and flavorful. And they always greet you with a smile and warm greeting.
2021-02-17,5,Behold the Bee Sting breakfast sandwich from O'Bagel in Hoboken!Tbh I've passed by this place in Hoboken sooo many times in the past, but I've never stopped by. It wasn't until my cousin sent me a Tik Tok from their account that I was absolutely intrigued. And ohhhhh boyyyy, I'm SOO HAPPY I finally stopped by!I got the Bee Sting, which contains:Stacked Crispy Bacon, Scrambled Egg, Melted Vermont Cheddar Cheese, Smear of Scallion Cream Cheese topped with Mike's Hot Honey. I also got it on a toasted French Toast Pumpkin Spice bagel!Guys, I have NEVER had such a fantastic breakfast sandwhich in my life. And I'm from NEW JERSEY, so that says a lot! The bagel itself was perfectly fluffy and not heavy like most bagels I've had. And the flavor was absolutely immaculate! The ingredients inside the bagel go together SO WELL, like I had no clue scallion cream cheese, bacon, and honey can go soo well together!So if you're ever in Hoboken between the hours 7am - 3pm, I would HIGHLY suggest checking this place out!
2021-02-17,4,After my first review post the owner promptly reached out and wanted to make things right. I finally went back and gave the "Bee Sting" no bacon, another try which was at no charge compliments of the owner. It was so much better this time, no bacon on site and definitely could taste the hot honey!
2021-02-16,1,Decent bagels and spreads. But today I ordered a gluten free bagel with the Tuscany spread for $6+tax for pickup only for them not to have it and them still charge me for it. They offered me something else in place of it but without a gluten free option I was forced to take a cold brew coffee instead which in no way was $6. Why didn't they offer me a refund for my order? Whack sauce. Stick with Wonder Bagels for the best bagels in the county.
2021-02-13,1,Nothing was toasted. Things we ordered extra of barely had a singe portion in them. I hoped the first occurrence was just bad luck but this is the second time in a row. Definitely won't be coming back.
2021-02-11,5,Favorite Hoboken bagels.Interesting sandwiches. Order online and pickup - way easier than waiting on line.
2021-02-04,4,First time at this place. We had their new Bee Sting bagel sandwich. Very delicious! My only complaint would be that it is a bit pricey for a bagel joint but the food was good.
2021-01-31,3,I've gotta be honest: I was drawn in by a TikTok. Their bagels on the TikTok looked phenomenal and when we moved into Jersey City, they were at the top of our 'must-try' spots. It was so hyped up that I expected so much more.  While their menu is definitely great, and I love the puns, it seems like (out of what we ordered) something was missing.My partner and I ordered the Ridge Diablo and the Jalapeno Popper on everything bagels. Both of them sounded absolutely delicious on paper. The Ridge Diablo is Taylor Ham, Bacon, egg, and pepper jack topped with pickled jalapeno and chipotle aioli.  The Jalapeno Popper was bacon, egg, cheddar, and firehog cream cheese (jalapenos, cheddar, chives). You get hungry just reading it, right? We THOUGHT they'd be amazing. But when we got our order (which was received ridiculously fast), we were pretty disappointed. The bagels were a bit smaller than we're used to in NYC from Tompkin's Square Bagels/Gramercy Bagels/Bagels & Schmear, and despite ordering at 10 am they somehow seemed like day-old bagels. They were very tough and hard to chew.  Now, biting into the Ridge Diablo you somehow tasted each individual ingredient - with no melding of flavors at all. I don't understand how this happened since, again, on paper, it seems like they should all blend well together. Yet, somehow, each ingredient was individual and there was no cohesion of taste. Another reason for 3-stars is that the sandwich seemingly only had one egg on it, which kind of made this a wimpy breakfast sandwich in comparison to others. Individually each ingredient on the Ridge Diablo actually did taste good, but together it seemed like they were fighting for dominance rather than working together to form a beautiful breakfast sandwich that we had hoped for.  Next up, was the Jalapeno Popper. This had a lot of the same issues the Ridge Diablo had - each ingredient somehow just didn't work or blend or help the other flavors. It felt as if something was missing - maybe salt would have helped do that? Also, while most of the ingredients were great, there was one that was lackluster: the firehog cream cheese. It seemed like this batch just wasn't blended well as we often found just plain cream cheese versus the deliciously decadent description for it that would imply otherwise.The service was good and the prices were fair (though $4 for delivery seems criminal).  As mentioned earlier, delivery was insanely quick (less than 25-30 minutes). However, we don't order food for just price or convenience - we order it for taste. And somehow this didn't work.We'll try them again for just bagels and cream cheese, but we're going to skip getting breakfast bagel sandwiches from them in the future and will continue our search in the area for a better spot.  Overall I'd say that you should try them as your experience might vary, and if your bar wasn't set as high you might love them. But, as far as I'm concerned, it was just okay.
2021-01-24,5,Amazing staff , great effort to making my experience the best even when busy ! Enjoyed my ridge Diablo and bees sting ! Deff worth a shot if your in the area and would like a diff bagel to enjoy .They do get busy but try to make every customer feel special Which is highly appreciated .  Great bagels made fresh everyday , try the French toast if you have a chance .
2021-01-24,2,I have tried and tried again to love O'Bagel breakfast sandwiches but they just never seem to live up to the hype of the Hoboken food instagrams. Pictures always look delicious, but every time I am let down by what I receive. While I understand the morning rush this place sees, the bacon (aside from the scarcity of it on the sandwiches) seems to have a metallic taste due to it sitting in the corner of the grill top for hours. Yesterday I tried the new Bee Sting sandwich- no hot honey to be found on the entire sandwich and the sandwich was so cold that the shredded cheese had not even melted. Clearly assembled cold and with all premade ingredients. I am willing to pay for a great breakfast sandwich, but $9 for a bacon, egg and unmelted cheese bagel with some cream cheese.....no. This place has so much potential and I wish they would take care of every customer as well as they do the instagrammers!!
2021-01-17,1,Over an hour to get a small and overpriced bagel. 20+customers standing around waiting for name to be called. Go to JP's Bagel Express!
2021-01-09,3,Average bagel shop. Food was good but not overly unique. Had a Taylor ham, cheese and egg on a everything bagel.
2021-01-06,3,Didn't quite live up to the Instagram hype and price. If I'm going to shell out $10+ for a bagel, it'd better be a step up from my $4 deli go-to, but this was not the case. Sauce and jalapenos on the Diablo were missing. Much more bagel than egg or meat. Online ordering for pick up was easy enough, 45 mins out. Sandwiches were ready when I arrived 15 mins early, but was likely sitting there for 30 minutes getting cold. Was excited to grab their jumbo bagel at some point to share with friends, but will likely not go out of my way to come back again.
2021-01-05,4,I ordered the jersey bagel on everything. Typical Taylor ham, egg and cheese. Nothing spectacular, but I may have just not ordered the correct menu item. A good choice for a bagel if you live in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it again.
2021-01-05,3,I don't understand the hype of O'Bagel. The bagels are super doughy and hard. There are so many other great breakfast options in Hoboken and JC, this is usually a last resort.
2021-01-02,4,O'Bagel has fluffy, fresh bagels. Tried the at home bagel kit twice during quarantine, loved it. Must check out and try this bagel shop in NJ
2020-12-30,2,Really disappointed that they raised the already high prices of the food. It's good but not great, and the portion is skimpy (1 egg on my egg sandwich which was $9).  I won't be back unless they adjust the prices to reflect the portion. The bagels are big but carbs are cheap....and everything else was sparse.
2020-12-28,3,Went a few times over the past year. Food is alright, but all of the Jersey City Wonder Bagel locations are way more ahead of the game. O'bagel ingredients are somehow just dry.
2020-12-28,5,The lox and loaded bagel is PERFECT. I love smoked salmon bagels and have been searching for the perfect one. THIS IS IT. The lox are fresh, the bagel is amazing, and it requires no modifications!! (A lot of places you have to be like "add capers, make it scallion cream cheese, add tomato .. and then it's $1 extra per mod and then they forget or don't have it half the time). Not to be dramatic but I think I would have moved had I not recently discovered O'Bagel. Living in JC for the pat 3 years my only complaint has been the lack of good bagel places. I think wonder bagels is OK but nothing special. It's really baffled me for 3 years how downtown JC can be so close to Manhattan and not have a ton of great bagel places. Then one day I saw a tik tok of a bagel being ripped apart that looked like the kind of bagel I need. Low and behold O'Bagel in Hoboken was just what I've been looking for. This place is amazing (and they deliver to JC ).  If you feel like your living in a world that's dominated by overrated, plastic wrapped, mediocre bagels and you feel like you're going crazy because you know you deserve better... YOU DO... and it's O'BAGEL!!!!
2020-12-23,1,This place has the absolute worst customer service it's infuriating. My orders are constantly being changed (most of the time without even asking me first) because they run out of Plain and Everything bagels ALL THE TIME. How do you even run out of plain bagels, there's literally nothing on them. They only make 5 types of bagels and they can't seem to keep them in stock meanwhile every other bagel place around has 10+ bagel types and they never have these issues. They swap my bagels out for a different flavor without asking me and then claim they tried to call me, but in reality they make minimal effort to contact you and instead just give you a different kind of bagel and assume it's okay. This was not a one-off experience by the way, this has happened to me almost a dozen times just in the past few months.
2020-12-20,5,Hands down the best bagel spot in Hoboken! It's my go-to spot for a TEC on an everything bagel and it never disappoints. Other great options are the Scaly T (the scallion cream cheese mixed with the turkey bacon is a great breakfast sandwich) the new hayride (a little rich to eat this all the time with the french toast as bread but it was amazing) and I recently tried the Dublin (corned beef and russian dressing with egg).I've recently been into eating lunch there as well and that's also amazing. I love tuna salad and the Jim Halpert is my new go-to. the arugula and cucumber on this sandwich makes it so refreshing I could eat it everyday.
2020-12-13,4,Is it the BEST bagel in NJ? No, probably not (that prize goes to Sam's in West Caldwell, in my opinion). But do they have the most interesting breakfast sandwich menu in NJ? Probably! I love a classic taylor ham egg and cheese, but you can get that anywhere. The Watchung Warrior and Dublin are delicious, but the Sinatra is my new favorite. Yes, it's expensive. But if you're like me and just go once every couple of months after spending a night out in Hoboken or Jersey City and crashing on your sister's couch, it is well worth the money. Bagels are perfectly fine and tasty, but the fun and unique options is what makes this place awesome.
2020-12-08,1,Well O'Bag I'm done. Again, how is it on a Tuesday morning I can't call in a BEC order? You answer the phone and say to order online? I have 3 online ordering apps. Three. You're not on a single one of them. How is ordering a breakfast sandwich such an inconvenience? This place isn't about a neighborhood vibe or standard operating service. It's about the next tv show where they can promo their giant bagel. You're a gimmick. Take a page out Tony B's book and be better. That's clearly what you're trying to be anyway.
2020-11-28,2,Really enjoyed this place the first time I went, the Hayride is DELICIOUS. However, I came back for a lox bagel and asked for some modifications (tomato, onion, toasted), but got only lox and cream cheese on a regular bagel. Disappointed with the service when i'm paying 26$ for 2 bagels.
2020-11-10,5,I am sorry I took long for not updating my review. This place reached out to me after my last review. It shows they really follow up and want to make sure they do their best. So during the COVID-19 pandemic they did do on line take out. I had a rough time trying to order on line. But once it was finally often for the public I was so happy to be back in the store and order these delicious bagels. Great and friendly staff. Thank you O'Bagel for your great work, service and good bagel.
2020-11-07,2,Went last weekend. Cashier was nice and promptly took our simple order of bagel with egg and cheese and a side of hashbrown. It was difficult to hear because music was so loud and we had masks on.We patiently waited for about 15 minutes, staring directly at staff, until we started to realize no one was making our food and people who ordered after us were getting their orders. We asked the cashier and she said they forgot. Great. Took another 15 minutes and then they forgot the salt pepper ketchup we had requested. Bagel was a little small but good. Hashbrown was stale and sitting on the grill all day.This is NJ and there are a hundred other bagel places to replace you so you don't get to give this kind of poor service.
2020-11-05,4,Breakfast sandwich was mediocre but the chicken salad sandwich was delicious, obviously quality gets diminished a bit with delivery but I was overall happy with the order
2020-10-17,2,wow. in all of my years living in nyc I've never quite had an experience like this. 1)  ordered 5 bagels, only received 42) ordered a pumpkin spice bagel, got an everything bagel instead??3) all the bagels are hallowed out - definitely did not ask for that. Who does that?!? 4) the BEC is simply sad and thin. More ketchup than cheese and eggs combined. The bacon was almost burnt dry. I'm almost in disbelief how bad they messed our order and these bagels up. I feel bad for the bagel to be honest. I was excited for breakfast - now I'm just hungry and disappointed.
2020-10-11,5,Holy crap does this place have amazing bagels. Plush with a crusty exterior and the nicest staff. While passing through Hoboken we decided to stop in and take a bagel to go and were shocked by how our little pit stop led to us encountering such a jewel! Bagel was also still a little warm (which is rare in the afternoon) and so fresh. If you order one served with cream cheese, best believe it will be stuffed with the good stuff!
2020-10-11,2,Love the food - but every single time I order from here it's always incorrect. I'm still shocked that after being open this long they just can't get orders right
2020-10-10,2,The quality of to go orders has diminished. I always come back out of trying to give them another chance, and then am continuously disappointed. The egg sandwiches have become so stingy compared to what they used to be, they look unappealing. This is the second time in a row my BEC has been completely unappetizing.
2020-10-04,5,Best bagel ever!!!! Watchung warrior and halzenut coffee...we cant wait to come back ...
2020-10-01,2,This was my first time trying O'Bagel and they always seem to be busy so I was expecting a very good experience. Nope, I ordered a pork roll egg and cheese sandwich. I haven't had one since pre-covid and I have been really craving one. Well this was a waste, there was a small egg, almost non existent cheese and 2 thin slices of pork roll, the sandwich  left me very unsatisfied. Just bland and soulless. I would never go back.
2020-09-19,5,Best bagels in Hoboken. I bring my family in Massachusetts these bagels because they're so good!
2020-09-14,5,As I begin this review,  I have to say this started out making me nervous but finished extremely strong. The ordering process is unique.  I feel if I would've went and ordered in person it would've been quicker but I ordered online and wound up being a forty five minute wait.  If I was a local,  that would work as I could time it right but we were coming from North Arlington and was caught off guard. First off,  I love the Washington Street vibe.  It's just a great atmosphere to be in.  Ok, I got off track. I got the Ridge Diablo. The sandwich consists of bacon,  Taylor ham,  scrambled egg,  pepperjack cheese,  picked jalapeños, chipotle aioli sauce and yes.... I added a hash brown to this bad boy.  I ordered it on a roll but they ran out of rolls and substituted with a plain bagel.  Now let it be known that I HATE my breakfast sandwich on a bagel.  O'Bagel changed that mindset I have. The bagel was excellent.  I couldn't believe it.  I don't know how but it was made for this sandwich.  Not too doughy and not too thick.  The sandwich itself was out of this world! Everything worked perfectly together.  This was so good,  I wouldn't hesitate to make another drive over on a weekend morning.
2020-09-13,3,The bagels themselves are some of the best, but their bagel sandwiches are insultingly light on the fillings. Ordered a BEC and there was only one, poor little egg on the sandwich. With a such a thick bagel, it ends up tasting like you're eating a very thick bagel with nothing but bacon (sounds better than it is).  It needs more cheese and more egg to match the quantity of the bacon. Until then, it's just not good. Same feedback goes for their turkey sandwiches. It's one measly slice of turkey.
2020-09-03,1,1 star, maybe 2 pending my refund. Every time I go my order is messed up. Butter on my bagel instead of cream cheese, missing bagels from my order of a half dozen, straight up burning my bagel instead of toasting it, it's ridiculous. Been going here for years and the quality has declined significantly. On top of that, did not see even one employee properly wearing a mask over their mouth and nose, and many were not wearing gloves. Their ordering/pickup area also does not allow for adequate social distancing. Extremely disappointed and not wasting my money here anymore.
2020-09-01,1,I'll preface this by saying that if you're just looking for a bagel with cream cheese, you'll likely have a good experience here. I wanted a chicken salad wrap and the place I'd usually go for wraps was closed today. So O'Bagel definitely wasn't my first choice but I figured I'd give it a shot - really wishing I hadn't.I ordered 2 chicken salad wraps - 1 with avocado and tomato, 1 with tomato and cucumber. First issue, neither came with tomato. Instead, both came with cucumbers. Normally I'd be able to overlook this mix up and just [try to] enjoy what I received. BUT when the wraps look like what we received (pictured), it's pretty hard to ignore - or enjoy for that matter. The chicken salad was practically nonexistent and could barely taste the small amount given because it was so overwhelmed by the wrap. Also, the wrap was falling apart. Seemed like whoever made this didn't know how to actually wrap a wrap? It was basically just smooshed down in a strange folded situation. Definitely not what I'd expect an $11 chicken salad wrap to look like.Honestly, we're probably hungrier now than we were before those 'wraps'.
2020-08-30,4,YOOOOOOOOOO jumbo bagel is where it's at.I ordered it for my 30th birthday and it was BOMB. Can easily feed a small country. I got the watchung warrior and it was PACKED with eggs, cheese, and pastrami. Only issue is they messed up my pickup time so they ended up having to deliver it since it wasn't ready when I arrived but they were great about it. 10/10 would order again.
2020-08-22,2,I don't get it - we're required to order online via ChowNow, but yet they always forget to get it online before the afternoon. I tried ordering through Yelp and they also aren't showing as open. This is the fifth time in like two months. Someone figure out the system, please! Last time I had to go to the store and show an employee the app because they wouldn't believe me over the phone. Frustrating!!!Two stars for the breakfast bagel sandwiches (usually get a cinnamon raisin BEC) since they're the only decent bagel place in Hoboken.
2020-08-22,3,Thought I'd surprise my husband with a treat this am. I ordered 2 lox and loaded bagel sandwiches from O'Bagel. I never buy bagels in NJ because, there really is no comparison to NYC but I thought I would try it this one time since it's been so long since I've had a bagel. My once a year treat is lox, cream cheese on an everything bagel. Unfortunately, I still haven't found anything close to NYC bagels. This bagel was tough and not hot and chewy as it should be. The amount of lox was ok, but just a thin piece. Nothing like the heaps of lox I'm used to. It was a passable sandwich but for $13.95, I'll just wait until I get back to the city for my bagel fix.
2020-08-14,1,Honestly this place is a joke. Their website is crap. Tried to place an order kept getting errors or nO confirmation. Called the restaurant and basically they told me to figure it out by going to another website versus just taking my order. No thanks, I'll just go somewhere who cares about customers.
2020-08-12,1,Yuck! My experience here was way before Covid however I saw a picture of something from here on social media and wanted to leave my review because a picture can look way more appetizing than it is in real life. Waited in a long line for bagels here and assumed it was good because of the line. Boy was I wrong-The bagel was so dry and hard which ruins a sandwich. Not worth bad bagels from a bagel shop, not returning and I was totally fooled by the line. And I hope others don't get fooled by the photos!
2020-08-09,3,The food is great. Can't deny that. BUT!They can not get an order right. Every single time I order they never get it right. They forget the has brown. I order a half dozen bagels and the flavors are completely wrong. I say cream cheese on the side and it's on the bagel. It's just never correct.
2020-08-03,1,So the picture I am posting is from pre-covid, which is absolutely inexcusable under any circumstance. Not only did they not send me the right order (requested on an everything bagel), they sent this pathetic amount of pork roll for which I paid almost $13, including the fees Grubhub took. As a local business owner to be so unaware that your customers are spending extra money for your product and then have so little care is a slap in the face to everyone who orders. If it's a lack of diligence from your staff, then do your part as management and find competent workers.As I read through the comments it seems i am not the only one and many others consistently receive incorrect orders. On top of this, they also don't take orders over the phone and I see amongst other reviews I am not the only one frustrated by this. If it's a fear of them taking orders that don't get picked up, take the extra 30 seconds to take down a card number from the customer. Pure laziness, and as a direct result I've taken my business elsewhere. I would never wish for a small business to fail, but in this case I fear it's the inevitable. Given the time stamp on some of the other poor reviews, it seems that no feedback is ever taken into consideration which also reflects a very poor business model top to bottom. Seldom do I write reviews, but in this case I felt compelled to in order to keep establishments honest and not let others waste their money, seeing that I would have probably been more satisfied physically ingesting a dollar bill than the sandwich that it bought me at O bagel.
2020-08-01,1,I'm getting really annoyed with how irresponsible some businesses have been during the pandemic, and this place is one of them.  None of the employees were wearing their masks properly, if they were wearing them at all.  I'm done being a customer of businesses like this.
2020-07-31,1,Waited 90 minutes for delivery and of course when the order came it was incorrect. I tried to call over 15 times and the phone was busy. Will never be ordering from here again, especially during times like these when ordering takeout is a luxury.
2020-07-30,1,3 strikes - they're out Decent Bagels but I'm done w this place1- They skimp in the eggs on breakfast sandwiches and you have to pay extra to get 2 eggs2- They won't take phone orders and their online ordering is super glitchy. C'mon, phone orders should be on point during COVID. 3- I gave them another shot today and they forgot the bacon on my bacon egg and cheese. Super bummer
2020-07-28,3,My friend was visiting from out of town and really wanted to get sandwiches from O'bagel after seeing photos on Instagram. With Covid, the only way to order is online via ChowNow.  Unfortunately, the page isn't very flexible and the site advises anything you put in the special instructions field will be ignored.   I wanted to add avocado to the one sandwich however it wasn't listed as a substitution/addition to check off, so there was no way to request that or to ask for the bagels to be toasted.  Also no way to request gluten free. We ordered the Ridge Diablo and Jalapeno Popper both on whole wheat bagels for pick-up.   We placed the order about 90 minutes in advance of our pick-up time and our food was ready when we arrived (no wait).  Based on several Yelp reviews, I was expecting our order may be wrong, but everything was right.  Both were tasty, but I liked the Ridge Diablo more - the pickled jalapenos are a nice kick.  I wish they had been toasted / wrapped in tin foil to stay warm.  Probably not a place I am going to order from very often - $8 for a breakfast bagel sandwich is pricey, however it could be a nice treat after a night out.
2020-07-25,2,I've had a few experiences with O'Bagel in recent months that have completely put me off; All involving their online ordering. I'm a healthcare worker and work rotating weekends, so I attempt to treat myself when Saturday shifts come around. As O'bagel's hours are listed as being open at 6 am, I have tried several times now to call and place pickup orders on Saturday mornings, only to be told by the employees that answer that I would need to place my order online and that they were unable to take a phone order. Due to my schedule, I have to be in my car and on my way by 7 am, but unfortunately, despite their being open at 6am, I'm unable to place an online order that would be ready prior to 7:30. It's one thing if they're open and getting ready for their day, but I find it incredibly misleading to have their hours posted as opening at 6 am, and having employees answer the phone and tell me at 6:45 am, that I can order, but need to do it online (which doesn't begin until 7:30). Unfortunately, this rating is based solely on customer service, as I still haven't been able to try the breakfast sandwiches I've heard so many great things about due to restrictions surrounding ordering.
2020-07-24,3,The food is good, but I'd say 7/10 times your delivery order will be incorrect. They're always willing to refund you or fix it, but I'm not waiting two hours to eat a bagel sandwich.
2020-07-21,5,Hoboken's best bagel, and I don't say that lightly. Any of the breakfast sandwiches are a great time.
2020-07-15,2,After hearing all about O'Bagel, we decided to give it a try on a busy Saturday afternoon. Due to the pandemic, you must place your order online, they are not talking walk up orders. After ordering, the estimated pickup time was 25 minutes, which is very long for a bagel regardless of how busy they were. I had approached the employee at the front to let her know we wanted our bagels toasted, she denies and tells me "our toaster is currently not working but the bagels are warm". As a bagel shop, a toasted bagel is a common request and this should of been corrected. Now for the bagel, we ordered everything bagels, some with cream cheese and some with eggs. The everything bagel was EXTREMELY salty; not sure if extra salt was thrown on top or this is the normal. We will not be returning as this spot is all hype.
2020-06-29,4,I know exactly what I want from my bagel. Those little cracks on the outside and fluffiness and glutton inside. They are both there. I think there are a lot of bad bagels that are not exactly like bagels in Hoboken but this is legit. I don't like getting their sandwiches as much because they tend to be overpriced but they are good. I wish their taylor ham, egg, cheese bagel sandwich has more eggs in them but that's just my personal preference. And it's my pet peeve when the cheese is not melted at all inside. Overall, VERY GOOD bagel.
2020-06-20,5,i had the plain bagel and everything bagel to go. they are very good! i also bought the scallion cream cheese to go and its amazing! good service too!
2020-06-20,2,Pre-covid my girlfriend and I would order from here every two weeks. Once they went online and stopped taking orders by phone, O'Bagel's customer service plummeted. They have gotten our orders wrong in the past but when they double charged me for two bagels and asked "Didn't you get 4 bagels", that was the last straw. We showed the manager the bag with 2 bagels and the whole ordeal took 20 minutes to obtain a refund. I am done with this place and I will no longer return to this establishment. Bagel buyers beware!
2020-06-08,4,Amazing spot for bagels and breakfast sandwiches. This is definitely one of the top spots in Hoboken, whether you're looking for plain bagels or breakfast sandwiches. I've tried both Ridge Diablo and  Sinatra breakfast sandwiches and both were really good. The Ridge Diablo is a very meaty sandwich but it's good if you like breakfast meats. They do put a lot of pickled jalapeños on it so you may need to take a couple off. Sinatra's got a whole bunch of flavors, the Tuscan spread they add is really good.
2020-06-02,4,Simple but effective egg and cheese on an everything bagel.  Proper amount of egg and cheese.  Bagel was above-average, but wished it were plump-er.  I was almost done before it started.  Their staff is helpful and pleasant, but the social distance pickup process leaves something to be desired (might still be working things out).  As of now, it's almost like a grab-bag at a table near the window.  The ordering process was smooth and was ready prior to the estimated time. Solid choice if you're looking for a bagel spot in Hoboken.
2020-05-03,5,O'Bagel has one the of the best at home quarantine kits!! My boyfriend and I had a wonderful time making bagels at home. The steps were easy to follow and my family loved them! (Mom requested more) We became bagel making pros thanks to O'Bagel. I highly recommend snagging up a kit. Safe pick up and delicious!
2020-04-24,2,Bagels are not good! And I wasn't even going to post this but I heard this guy brag that his bagels were better than any bagel shop in Manhattan on the Hoboken Girl's podcast and I just couldn't handle that. Points for creative sandwiches I suppose... but it's a good bagel I'm after.
2020-03-29,4,Decided to try this place out after finding out that it is owned by the same owner as loquito! I've heard their specialty bagels are really good so I tried the Sinatra bagel. It has a breakfast sausage, medium egg, arugula, red onion, and a Tuscan cream cheese. The bagel was massive; so don't expect all of it to stay inside. The flavors were really good though, especially the cream cheese. However, they got some of my order wrong and I'm reading the same thing on other reviews as well. Overall I'm still happy with my first experience with O'Bagel.
2020-03-28,5,I tried O'Bagel for the first time today and I was truly floored. Their Egg Ceptional menu is one for the history books! So intrinsically creative and thoughtfully curated. I plan to visit this very location as much as my schedule shall permit. I ordered two Gringo Burritos (one for a friend) and earnestly wanted to head back for another after shortly consuming it. Lol The staff was amazing from our initial phone order to the in person hand-off since it was a to-go order. Hands down the best bagel shop in all of Hudson County. Quite possibly every County :)
2020-03-28,1,Messed up delivery order. Phone is off the hook so you can't even call to ask for correction or a refund.
2020-03-14,5,Best bagel store in Hoboken, hands down! Fast service, incredible specialty sandwiches and out of this world customer service. The line moves quick and your sandwich comes out in a flash!
2020-03-09,5,Line was long but quick!! Coffee  wasn't worth it but the joe peach tea was good. I had the Sinatra bagel  which was delicious  and my friend has the burrito . The brisket in hers was super tender !! Hmm !!!They have a handful of seats near the windows but aspect to get bumped because there's a line to order and a line to pick so it's a tight fit.
2020-03-01,5,Not only is this the best bagel in Hoboken, it's the best bagel I've ever had. The Ridge Diablo is fire
2020-02-27,5,Their egg-ceptional menu has my heart (I don't have a gift for puns, that's actually what it is called)!O'Bagel is usually packed, which is a great indicator on how good these bagels actually are. The next morning after a night out and about in Hoboken, our group was craving some messy breakfast sandwiches and wanted them delivered as close to the couch we were all sharing as possible. We ordered through their website and in no time we were chowing down. Usually all I want is a bacon egg and cheese (or BEC as it is all of a sudden always called) but after checking out the egg-ceptional menu I found the sinatra too good to pass up. Straight from the menu is the description of this guy: Breakfast Sausage with An over medium egg topped with dressed arugula, wilted red onions and smear of homemade Tuscan spread. ($8.25) I got mine on an everything bagel and loved each bite. The tuscan spread was like a cream cheese and came with a pretty heavy dose. I loved it, but if you don't want a ton of shmeer you can ask for it lite or just take some off yourself. I have my favorite spot in town when all I want is a good ol' bec, but I'll make this my place for a sandwich with a little more frill. If you're looking for a new bagel spot in Hoboken, O'Bagel won't disappoint.
2020-02-23,1,I ordered a bacon egg white and cheese and I legit got this. (No cheese, barely any egg at all, and a load of bacon) The bagels are good but unfortunately they always get my order wrong. This isn't the first time it happened. If you ever get something just get a bagel with butter or cream cheese. They can't fu*k that up right??? I mean, wth. If I'm going to pay $10 for bread and a sprinkle of egg whites - I'll go somewhere else..
2020-02-22,2,If this place could ever get an order right, I could confidently proclaim this the best bagel shop in Hoboken. But it's literally a 50/50 chance of these folks screwing up our order. Once had family visiting and we put in order for 6 different bagels/sandwiches. And they forgot to put 2 of the sandwiches in the bag. Straight up forgot them. And the other four that were - two were wrong. This is the norm. Whenever I do go, I have to open up everything before I leave. Just really really poor service.
2020-02-02,1,Average bagels. Poor service. Very conveniently located. I keep coming back due to location but I can count on my order being wrong 40% of the time. The cream cheese is fantastic so you can't go wrong with a bagel and cream cheese but anything off the grill is a shot in the dark with consistency. UPDATE: It's only gotten worse over time. They need to pay more attention on the line to the orders.
2020-01-27,4,Kind of pricey but not a bad place to pick up breakfast. I usually order a bacon egg and cheese on a whole wheat bagel which usually cost me about $5-6 and it really isn't that much different from going to a standard deli. Maybe I'll tr other things next time.
2020-01-27,5,O'BagelO' my g*dWhat an underrated spot!! So shocked to see the average star rating on yelp for this little hidden gem! What shocked me even more is the amount of times i went there and have not checked in a single time! That shows how excited i was to just be in the presence of these magical bagel experts!Every time i have gone, it's always for the buffalo chicken bagel. SPECTACULAR!! I am very picky when it comes to textures and flavors. This sandwich seems to have mastered both tasks. Im not a fan of spice but my masochism side comes out every once in a while. The kick of buffalo with its cooling cole slaw created a perfect balance that did not cause my gastric contents to slowly creep up my esophAgus. As far as the  bagel, i always got the everything bagel. They taste very fresh and fluffy. Usually the bagel is lightly toasted and put together into which ever sandwich was ordered. I recommend ordering online  or maybe going when you are not in a rush due to its high volume of customers! The line sometimes goes out the door
2020-01-23,4,This has potential to be 5 stars but it needs to sort out a few kinks. Typically a large wait time for delivery and sometimes they get orders wrong. Otherwise this is my favorite bagel place in Hoboken. Bagel egg and cheese on a whole wheat everything. Yes please!!
2020-01-21,3,its gooood- but there are better bagels in hoboken. definitely overrated. dont order on seamless because they pretty much run out of everything on weekends and youll wind up getting a random bagel you didnt order.
2020-01-16,3,A Hoboken classic! Unfortunately they get the order wrong a lot. I understand there's always a morning rush (especially on the weekends when you need a hangover bagel) but it's sooo annoying when you wait just to open your bagel when you get home to see it's wrong. It's happened more than once to more than just me!
2020-01-12,5,One of the only places outside of my hometown bagel shop I would endorse. These bagels are legit. They are chewy on the inside, crunchy on the out, perfect bagel texture and taste. Good coffee too. Place is always packed, so come prepared with the mindset there will be a line.
2020-01-04,4,Been a frequent customer at O'Bagel for more than 2 years and it's one of my favorite breakfast spots in town. In terms of their actual bagel, they're #1 or 2 in Hoboken. The staff is awesome, the store is always buzzing on weekends, and they've got a system down pat to balance busy service.This is an admittedly silly criticism, but i always notice it and it always bothers me: when I get lunch sandwiches the lettuce is dark romaine lettuce as opposed to an iceberg lettuce for example. CAnt explain why but it drives me crazy.Anyway here are a bunch of beautifully aesthetic pics from my many visits to Obagel.
2019-12-30,3,I got the watchung warrior on an onion bagel. Overall the bagel tasted yummy but the portions were a little skimpy for the price. Also the yelp free small coffee deal is not accepted there so that was a bummer.
2019-12-16,4,My favorite bagel spot in hoboken- the bagels are always so fluffy and huge. Can never go wrong with breakfast here!
2019-12-16,5,O boy, O'Bagel! As a Pennsylvania native, I'm a sucker for a quality, New Jersey bagel. We chose O'Bagel, and it did not disappoint. I tried the Ridge Diablo on Onion, and it hit every spot - spicy, fresh, seasoned, meaty! I love a place where everyone can find something that suits them and walk away happy, and that's the place! Their sandwiches are big, unique and delicious. My only complaint (which might not be their fault) was when ordering via grub hub, I could not choose the specialty bagel offerings or sides.
2019-12-15,5,Found this bagel place right on the corner of my Air bnb so decided to stop in for a quick breakfast and so glad I did! They have so many delicious options it was so hard to pick, decided to go with the Skinny girl bagel which is egg whites, spinach, avocado and turkey and it was delicious ! Got it in the wheat everything bagel and it was such a great combination, my friends got the lox bagel and the buffalo chicken and they were just as delicious. If you're looking for  a yummy quick breakfast and you're in Hoboken this is the place to go !
2019-12-13,5,O'Bagel knows what makes a great New Jersey bagel. They've got the classic down - A plain bagel will run you $1. It's fresh. It's got a lightly crispy, thin crust  and fluffy, soft interior. They have great color and shine.They experiment - From firehog cream cheese (cheddar cheese and jalapenos mixed in) to beet cured hummus to granny smith/fennel/red cabbage slaw, you know there's a creative eye behind this menu. They aren't just for breakfast, try their lunch grub - O'Bagel is open till 3pm. Pop in for one of their delicious lunch bagel combos. My personal favorite? Jim Halpert. It's homemade tuna salad with swiss cheese, balsamic dressed arugula, and red onions. It isn't just for meat eaters - Pescatarian? Try the aforementioned Jim Halpert. I promise it's not you're run of the mill tuna fish. Vegetarian? Gt creative with your breakfast bagel and consider adding crispy hashbrowns, avocado, veggies (spinach and arugula), and other toppings (like red onion or jalapeno) Vegan? While they have yet to add tofu cream cheese to their menu (which is surprising since half a block down at Hoboken Hot Bagels you can order some!) they have a delicious Beirut sandwich composed of homemade beet cured humus topped with oven roasted vegetables, charred carrots, and fresh parsley. Beware of their popularity! Come early. They sell out of items quickly. They don't always have avocado (though they keep heaps in storage, they don't serve it unless it is ripe). Lines can run out to door on weekends.Requests: I'd love to see some meat substitutes on your menu. I'm talking seitan, tempeh, impossible meat, morning star sausage patties...bring it on! For a non-processed option, consider slabs of cauliflower steaks, coconut bacon, and tofu. This will make for a more inclusive menu and expand your customer base.
2019-12-08,4,Delicious bagels! Quick line. I wasn't a huge fan of the coffee and the lid kept coming off of the cup.
2019-12-02,1,This place is the worst. The people don't take accurate orders, make accurate order, or care a bit when that is pointed out. I've gone 4 times now to give them a try. It has sucked in similar ways each time.
2019-12-01,3,Bagel itself was good.. ordered lox spread w capers and onions... no lox just cream cheese and one TINY piece of lox. Had no love put in to it.. which sucks because I grew up going to the o bagel in my hometown and they never disappoint. GIVE ME LOVE BAGELS !!!! For the price of the dam thing. They should know we expect more from them.
2019-11-18,5,Don't buy the negative reviews this place is amazing I think honestly most the negative reviews people are just looking for something negative to say. This place is so delicious friendly staff every time we visited we had a great experience.
2019-10-26,1,Cmon O'bagel - was expecting way more from a NJ bagel place.  Barely one slice of ham and cheese.  This sandwich cost $8.38.  Very disappointed.
2019-10-25,5,Wowowow, I love this place! I also just want to preface that I'm a west-coaster and this was the first bagel place I tried in the area. I walked by it the night before I went when it was closed and it looked like a quaint little bagel shop but when I went the morning after I found that it was fully packed with a line way out the door! I didn't realize it was such a popular place but that must be a sign that it's pretty good no?  The line was long but it moves pretty quickly, and I ordered the Lox and Loaded because go big or go home amirite? I got it on an everything bagel and wow...I LOVED the bagel. I couldn't eaten it plain and still have enjoyed it. Everything on the bagel was an added delicious bonus and I was absolutely full after eating it. I highly recommend!
2019-10-14,5,Ordered delivery from here today. Delivery arrived quicker than expected. Everything was packed neatly and arrived hot. I ordered the gringo burrito (which I've had before) and the Watchung Warrior (pastrami, melted Swiss, scrambled egg, and honey Dijon). I asked in the notes if I could please get that in a white wrap also like the gringo and they delivered it in a wrap! Awesome! Both burritos were delicious! Love the crunch of the hash brown in the gringo and the flavors in the watchung. I recommend both. Very flavorful!
2019-10-13,4,The best bagel place. Fresh, Soft, chewy and all the favorites. Open early and for people like me that can't sleep. The staff is friendly and happy to help you.
2019-10-06,5,Their bagels are the best in Hoboken hands down! The Ridge Diablo is amazing with just enough spice! Also their pork roll egg and cheese is another great simple sandwich and a jersey classic of course
2019-10-03,4,One of the best parts about visiting NYC are the bagels (and pizza), but let's focus on the bagels here. Our friend placed the order online for delivery and it took about an hour, but it was well worth the wait. O'Bagel's menu has a creative twist and consists of a ton of specialty sandwiches, multiple flavors of cream cheese, and bagels inferior to ordinary plain. The bagels are fresh and thick but still have a fluffy consistency to them. They are super generous with their spreads and ingredients, which results in a huge sandwich. Highly recommend if you are staying in Hoboken and need a filling hangover cure!
2019-09-25,3,Ordered breakfast for pick-up since this place seemed to have the best reviews out of all the bagel spots in Hoboken. I had the Jalapeño popper (crispy bacon, egg, and melted Cheddar cheese topped with smear of our Firehog cream cheese on your bagel or bread of choice). I asked them to scoop out the bagel and even then, I could only finish half. It's pretty heavy and oily so I probably wouldn't order this one again. The bagel itself it just alright. Nothing amazing. But then again, nothing could ever beat a NY bagel. BF had the Gringo Burrito (Sofritto braised short rib with fire roasted ranchero peppers, homemade salsa, over medium eggs, crispy hashbrowns and topped with tequila pickled onions & jalapeños wrapped in a warm tortilla). Also oily (as expected), but pretty good overall and I don't even normally liked braised short ribs. Maybe it was the hash brown that made it. Next time, I want to try the chicken salad, or this other Sammie they have with breaded chicken/ricotta.
2019-09-19,3,Food is great but I'm pretty angry that I put an order in almost 30 minutes before the pickup and when I arrived they just started working on it. I now have a nice shiny parking ticket to go with my breakfast because two seconds turned into 10 more minutes.
2019-09-12,4,"I love carbs!" is the motto of O'Bagel. I wouldn't say that I love carbs, but I do love a good bagel. O'Bagel's happens to be good enough, and I'll argue that it's is the best that Hoboken has. The others either charge too much for this simpleton food, or flat out fail at making it. With that said, O'Bagel is not be the best I've ever had, or close, but there's a lot to be appreciated in a down to earth experience ordering a competently done bagel. The service is always fair and efficient, never rude nor feigning sweetness. The decor too quite accurately sums up the service; spartan and utilitarian, with very poor ventilation to boot, it again signals that the draw is not pretense, but instead it's simple namesake. All of this no frills atmosphere will eventually amount to a bagel being delivered to your mouth. When it arrives, expect the regional basics: plain, everything, salt, poppy, garlic, whole wheat, paired with cream cheese, taylor ham, eggs, or lox. Do not expect light cream cheese, tofu spread, or other modern foo foo. You may call me basic, call O'Bagel basic, and call the bagel basic, but I'd enjoy it no more any other way.
2019-08-25,1,They underserved every order and are rude when you ask basic questions for your bagel. I highly do not recommend investing in this business. If no stores were an option, I wouldn't give them any. An absolute disgrace.
2019-08-19,4,Not cheap but done well. Only issue is the place is tiny, long lines but hey its Hoboken
2019-08-19,4,came to this small bagel joint while visiting Hoboken and it did not disappoint! it's super tight, wouldn't suggest eating in.
2019-08-17,2,Wow what a ripoff!  I was pretty hyped after waiting on a line on Saturday morning, but found myself sorely disappointed.  The lox bagel was $5 and the chicken salad bagel was $7, which we found out after the fact since there were no menu prices listed (I guess the place can charge whatever they want) and the cashier rushed us through the order before we could choose something else.  The bagels themselves were okay - not all that great compared to the other bagel shops in the area.
2019-08-14,4,Okay.  So I'm updating the review because they've made changes to their menu and they've remodeled. So I stopped in on a Wednesday morning (I'm on a break from grad school).  Their selection isn't bad- they have a variety of bagels and a few different flavors of cream cheese to choose from.  I ordered the whole wheat bagel with the fire hog cream cheese.  The fire hog is a mix of jalapeño and cheddar cheese.  Don't worry, it sounds weird but it's actually really good and not super spicy.The bagel itself was good.  I have found that sometimes the service is rushed.  I find sometimes my bagels aren't toasted all the way when I ask for them to be toasted.  However this place is usually busy and they're extremely packed on the weekends, so I can understand why they might rush when it's busy.  The space itself is tiny.  The line is usually out the door on the weekends and there are very few places to sit.  Since they recently remodeled, there is now counter seating which allows for more indoor seating, but it's still pretty crowded.  The outdoor seating is nice during the summer.I personally am not a fan of the egg sandwiches.  I'd rather eat mine on bread rather than a bagel and find their not very flavorful here, but that's just my own personal preference.  Coffee is pretty good but sometimes they fill it up too much with little room for milk.Service is friendly and fast.Overall a good place for a quick bagel, but not the best I've ever had.
2019-08-11,5,Best bagels in Hoboken by far. Long lines on weekends but worth the wait! The only thing I didn't like from there was the jalapeño cheddar cream cheese. It was very bland so I wouldn't recommend trying that flavor.  Otherwise, amazing!
2019-08-04,4,This place is one of the best bagel shops in Hoboken. All the food is delicious and I would highly recommend. Only issue I have is with the coffee. I got an iced coffee once and it tasted like tequila was in it... which hey you usually have to pay extra for amiright people? (Snare drum crashes) I haven't had the guts to get the coffee again after that experience but aside from that the food makes up for that one bad encounter.
2019-07-28,5,Awesome bagel and sandwiches!  Would definitely come back.  Long line but great service to keep the line moving.
2019-07-18,1,I liked this place when it first opened. However it's gone downhill ever since.  I decided to give it one last chance today. I wish I hadn't. I got home to find no bacon on my bacon, egg and cheese. How do you forget to put bacon on a BEC. "Bacon" is in the name of the sandwich! This isn't the first time something like this has happened here either. If I wasn't so annoyed, I'd be laughing at their level of incompetence. Also, with the one egg and one piece of cheese they put on it, it was basically like eating a bread sandwich. Complete waste of eating a bagel. Not to mention the staff gives off an idgaf vibe, which is represented in their sandwich making. No thanks. JPs going forward.
2019-07-18,2,Been here about 10 times.  The bagels themselves are great, however when you get an egg sandwich there's a 75% chance that they get the order wrong.  Bacon, egg & cheese with no bacon. Try asking for a ham, egg and cheese bagel, and no one who works there has heard of regular deli ham, (not taylor ham). I've had sandwiches with one slice of meat on it, when JP's and Bagels on the Hudson down the street pile the meats high.  They often skimp on the cream cheese or any other fillings in a bagel. The french toast bagel is amazing, however I've only seen it available twice since its the first bagel they run out of. I keep giving this place a try because the bagels themselves are great, but no one wants to come home to see one egg and one slice of cheese on their BE&C bagel.
2019-07-14,4,Bagels are fantastic, but I cannot tell you how many times I get home with the wrong order. It seems like they get a little careless during the Sat/Sunday rush. Won't stop me from going, but definitely check your bag BEFORE you leave.
2019-07-11,4,So much competition out there for bagels you know I had to chime in. In NJ the bagel war is up there with the pizza war. I think pizza is more popular but bagels aren't far behind. O'bagel is a newer place in town and is located with a few blocks of Hoboken Hot bagels and Bagels on the hudson which have been there forever. Heres how it went at O'bagel. First off when you come here it is hot in there. They have an open kitchen and you order near the back so you have to sit in the heat. In the summer you will definitely break a sweat in here. When ordering they have all the usual suspects but either they didnt have or were out of roast beef when I was there.  I swear they had a sandwich on the menu with it but I guess were out. I came during primetime hours on a saturday. No bueno.  I ordered a couple egg sandwiches. They were good but the bagel didn't pop out at me. It wasn't the star of the sandwich like it is in some other places. It wasn't bad but not great. I prefer my bagels on the chewier side rather than crunchy and Idk if this had either.It is a good spot and if you are in the area come check it out but I definitely prefer Bagels on the Hudson when ordering a bagel. I would come here before Hoboken Hot bagels though.
2019-07-08,3,The bagel itself was really good, but for upwards of $9 I think there should be more than 2 slices of meat on the sandwich. Disappointing food, nice atmosphere though!
2019-07-01,1,Used to regularly visit but stopped after a few bad experiences last year....seems they didn't learn their lesson. Stood at the counter for at least 5 minutes before I had to ask to be served. Ordered a THEC and a Watchung Warrior and BOTH sandwiches were missing the eggs! How complicated is it to make a bagel sandwich? Will never go there again as they clearly don't care how the business operates and are just looking to exploit the local foot traffic with crap service
2019-06-29,4,I'm gonna get crazy here and say this is my favorite bagel in Hoboken. They have a ton of speciality bagel sandwiches which are awesome but the bagels themselves are crispy on the outside and warm and doughy on the outside. Not to forget, they are "everything'd" exactly the way all everything bagels should be.Our favorites are the Riverwalk and the Scaly T, but there are really such great sandwich combos of things you'd never think to put together - trust they know what their doing! There is usually a pretty long line, out the door typically, but it goes fairly quick and is definitely worth the wait. I have seen people walk away because of the line and the fact that theres not much room to sit and wait inside, don't let this deter you its worth it. The bagel sandwiches are a little pricey but what isn't? You can also get your classic butter or cream cheesed bagel and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
2019-06-24,5,the best bagels in the entire world - i'm biased bc I grew up with these bagels in Basking Ridge, but honestly all my friends and I totally agree it can't get better than this. 100% recommend the whole wheat everythings, the french toast bagels, and the ridge diablo creation / miracle on a bagel. and the coffee is so so good, too. i'm so excited for the owner's new taco store to open, too! he's the best cook.
2019-06-08,4,O'Bagel is known as the best bagel spot in Hoboken, and I would totally agree. The bagels are always a good size, average in circumference (not too big or too small) and what I really like about their bagels are how much they rise. It gives the bagel a fluffy texture which I absolutely love. In my opinion their bagels are great, but not the best bagel I've ever had which is the reason for my 4 star rating. Today my boyfriend got the ricotta sandwich for lunch which he saw a few days ago on Instagram and he said it's as delicious as it looks. Only criticism would be that it's a bit messy and hard to eat. But overall O'Bagel is very consistent and I always go there when I'm in the mood for a hungover breakfast sandwhich. :)
2019-06-08,4,Came here with my friends who live around the corner and come here often. For a Saturday morning the line actually wasn't that bad. It's definitely very hot in the shop but Once you order you can wait outside until they call your name. I got a Cinnamon Raisin bagel with plain cream cheese. There was the perfect amount of cream cheese on the bagel. With my check in I also took advantage of the Yelp deal to get a free small hot coffee. My friends ordered a breakfast sandwich with avocado, which they all loved. They did mix up my one friends bagel, instead of a whole wheat everything bagel they did a regular everything bagel. Overall not a huge deal. Next time I'm in the area I definitely would come back here and maybe try one of their speciality bagel sandwiches.
2019-06-04,5,Beyond it being very hot inside the shop, O'Bagel is the best bagel shop in Hoboken. The hash browns on the bagel sandwiches are wonderful. The line is long to order but your order comes up quickly!
2019-06-03,5,Fantastic, filling, delicious, and friendly place.  Visiting my son here in Hoboken and he recommended this place.
2019-06-01,2,The iced coffee was nice and earned the two stars. Now let's talk bagels; ordered an egg cheese avocado tomato on an everything. The bagel was hard and they forgot the avocado, but remembered to charge me for it. The other bagel was a Black Russian with lox spread. The lox spread was really good, but I need to see a doctor to check out my jaw after trying to break down these "bagels". Total price was $19.
2019-05-31,3,Bacon egg and cheeses both came with barely any egg. The staff was slow and lazy. Also the menu not in store and online has lower prices than they charge you at the register. I need to remember to stop coming here as this is the second time I'm disappointed here.
2019-05-22,4,Really busy place. Order ahead and pick up there.  Highly recommend the Ridge Diablo bagel sandwich...delicious and spicy.  Add a hash brown to make it even more delicious.
2019-05-12,1,Ordered the Ricotta Love it bagel sandwich. Looking forward to it for a while. Waited in a long line. Then came home and noticed they forgot to put the vodka sauce on it. Didn't want to go all the way back in the rain to tell them they forgot the sauce. Very disappointed. For $9.50 at least get it right.
2019-04-27,2,Being a regular from their warren and long hill locations, I was excited to try the Hoboken one after recently moving here. Sadly very disappointed that my bagel was served up without the hash brown I paid for, and without the salt pepper ketchup that was requested. Service was relatively quick and cordial. Need better crowd control as they let this jamoke stand in the walking lane with his thumb up his butt. Overall, good bagel but make sure they have the correct bagel in the bag before you rub up against other patrons on the way out.
2019-04-26,1,Ughhh... I'm so sad to be writing this review. O'Bagel has been my go-to bagel spot for a long time, despite having an issue 2 years ago, which was resolved and I remained a customer. The issue was that the person who took my order and rang up my transaction (handled my cash) didn't change gloves after touching my money and proceeded to make my bagel with the same gloves. I posted a negative review, BUT the owner himself reached out to me via Yelp and apologized for this rookie mistake, and assured me he held a meeting with his staff about the issue. He also offered me a free breakfast sandwich, so in my eyes, the issue was resolved, and I was happy to remain a customer. The bagels here are awesome!However, now 2 years later, I just had the same exact issue today. A tall, younger guy took my order today, rang me up at the register, had a glove on his left hand, and proceeded to dig through the quarters and hand me my change using the glove. Then I watched as he went straight to the bagels and dug through them to find me a good one (using the left gloved hand!!). I guess I should've said something, but the place was packed and I honestly didn't act quick enough. I was just completely grossed out - took my bagel and left (of course didn't eat it).I won't go back after this. Even if this was just a mistake by one person, it's in my head now, and I shouldn't have to watch every single time someone makes my food. I just don't get it.... why wear a glove if you're going to touch money and then touch the food?! So frustrating. I'll have to find a new bagel place at this point! :(
2019-04-21,1,I visited O'Bagel today to get some bagels and coffee. On Yelp app, there was a "free small coffee with purchase" offer posted by O'Bagel. However, when I asked the cashier, she was hesitant to honor the offer and informed that she will check with someone in the back of the store. After speaking with this person, she came back and told gave me random bullshit excuses that "This offer is only for online orders" and "It's only on Yelp orders". I showed her Yelp app and the offer details where it clearly stated that you get a free coffee with the purchase. However, she acted like she doesn't know what was going on. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it. So, I took my "everything" bagels and walked away.As for the bagels itself, I felt they were a little bit on the salty side. I'm not sure if it was the bagel, or the "Tuscan" or "Mediterranean" spreads.It's a shame when a businesses advertises an offer on Yelp, but their employees are clueless and not willing to honor it.
2019-04-16,1,Ordered on Grubhub ,so excited to try them for the first time and.....26 minutes late and missing my hash browns with a side old a cold bacon,egg and cheese .Greatttttt......
2019-04-14,5,Steve and his sister have do am amazing job at Obagel.. they have amazing tasty bagels...A bagel is not just a bagle... go to Obagle ..i promice you will return..
2019-04-06,5,Solid bagels here, fresh, crispy and doughy. The lox is good and there is also outdoor seating where you can eat.
2019-03-29,2,Went here for the first time today.  Ordered their onion bagel with beet hummus topping. A few of us customers waiting for bagel freaked out as a large mouse walked across the wooden food prep table. Like he owned the place despite it being super crowded and loud at 9AM.  I told the cashier who didn't seem super concerned or perhaps didn't want to bother any of the other 5 employees to try to figure out where the mouse came from.  Prob a 5 minute wait for the bagel after 1 minute on line. Crust was excellent, the spread was at most 1/2 cm thick, a far cry from the fat-stacked bagels in the pictures, so it was more like a beet-flavored bagel than the $5 sandwich I thought I'd get.  I think it could use some lemon or vinegar or something because the hummus robs the beet flavor. I'm afraid I won't be back, didn't get the premium experience or food I was hoping for.
2019-03-26,5,Definitely one of the best places to get bagels in the Hoboken area. Their bagels are soft and fresh but the highlight of O'Bagel is their creative bagel choices - my favorite includes the Ridge Diablo and the Jalapeño Popper. Seriously addicting and a danger to any diet but worth the extra calories.
2019-03-24,5,Stop by here for breakfast and I was not disappointed! I ordered the jalapeño popper on everything bagel. Every bite was so tasteful. I will definitely be coming back
2019-03-18,1,Quality of food and customer service is a JOKE here. The picture speaks for itself, I ordered a bagel with cream cheese. Other recent reviews, show I am not alone. JP's just gained a lifetime loyal customer, never have any issues there (except the wait, but it is worth it).
2019-03-17,1,This place keeps getting worse. Horrible customer service and continuously lowering the quality of food. Ordered a Taylor ham egg and cheese but realized when I got home there was no Taylor ham. Also check out this skimpy $6 bagel:
2019-03-08,3,It should be a crime to make a lox sandwich with one thinly slice lox when customers pay $11.25 for the sandwich.
2019-02-26,4,On my quest to find the best potato egg and cheese in New Jersey, stopping at O'Bagel is a no brainer. They're famous for their giant bagel sandwich that serves a whole party!I was a little disappointed in the contents of my sandwich - the ratio of bagel to to cheese-potato-egg was a bit off. The bagel did make up for it though because their bagels are BOMB. The perfect bready crispy bagelly combo. They also only had hash browns for the potato option. It added a nice crunch to the sandwich but I'm a sucker for some seasoned taters. Overall pretty good sandwich! I just wish there was a bit more between the bagels.
2019-02-25,5,Bagels are always fresh and service is friendly and quick. Best bagel in Hoboken by far
2019-02-19,5,In my opinion, O'Bagel has the best bagels in Hoboken. It is the only bagel shop I will eat at. The bagels are fresh and fluffy, they are toasted well, and the BEC + Avo is a personal fave. The location is small but super cute
2019-02-18,4,Great customer service, delicious specialty bagels, can get crowded during the lunchtime rush.I got the daily O'special "The Castro" - ham, melted swiss, braised pork shoulder, jalapenos/pickled onions/mojito salsa. Super tasty bagel sandwich! Unfortunately, my order got lost in the mix so the wait was pretty long. They also gave me the wrong bagel type and didn't toast it as I'd requested. Initially I wasn't impressed by the service but they were very nice about it, apologized for the wait, and let me grab a free drink on the way out. It's been a long time since I've experienced customer service that good!Great place with great food and nice people. Will be back again real soon. Also, you get 10% off your first order if you check in with Yelp.
2019-02-09,5,It's hard to find a good bagel in Jersey City / Hoboken and this place has the best one! The bagels are nice and crispy on the outside and soft inside. Highly recommend the cold brew and one of their special sandwiches. The staff is super friendly and they're available on seamless. Consistently satisfied.
2019-02-07,5,The ridge diablo could be considered New Jersey's go-to bagel sandwich - ham, bacon, cheese and egg on your choice of bagel. Simply delicious! Make sure to add the hash brown thought. Also, pro tip - if you're ordering online it typically says 1 hour but go in a few minutes after otherwise you run the risk of your bagel sitting around!
2019-01-30,4,This is my go-to bagel shop. Mainly because I living around the corner, but also because I thoroughly enjoy their bagels. My fiends and I have had numerous different bagels and sandwiches and all are worth trying. Of all the bagels I've had, the Ridge Diablo is probably my favorite (with a hash brown), I think it has something to do with the aioli and jalapeños. Another favorite was the Watchung Warrior, I would never think to put honey Dijon dressing on an egg sandwich until I had this. I've also been told the the lox is very fresh and was great on a Lox n' Loaded. Their bagels are always fresh and they have a decent amount of spread options. If you're up early enough you can smell the bagels being baked when you walk by. Their hot and cold brew coffees are tasty and a nice pairing for your breakfast. The only downsides are that their breakfast sandwiches can be a little pricier than most, and the line is usually out the door just to order. I have left the line before to go to Hoboken Hot Bagels down the street because it just wasn't worth the wait.
2019-01-25,2,Third time I've asked for a bagel with 2 fried eggs and every time the eggs are super runny and practically raw. Would you want to eat this (see pic below)? The sandwich is a total mess and barely edible. I don't understand how difficult it is to make fried eggs at a bagel/breakfast shop! Also, how does someone then wrap a breakfast sandwich up like that and think it's ok? The bagel was completely drenched and soaking in super runny - practically raw egg. I understand things happen but it is a consistent trend at o bagel (the third time) and they should be more aware of presentation and ensuring people aren't going to get salmonella from eating their food. Also, each time I've ordered a sandwich the shop has also been empty, another reason why I'm confused on presentation and quality.O bagel's bagels aren't bad, but their sandwiches are a hot mess. Apparently asking for something as simple as fried eggs instead of their usual egg beaters is asking for too much.
2019-01-20,2,I ordered lox and loaded and there was no cream cheese and one piece of salmon and the whole sandwich was constructed like a complete mess. Not worth close to the $11 dollars they're charging.
2019-01-06,3,Delicious bagels, although they do end up running out of the popular ones by noonish on weekends. A bit overpriced and it's nearly impossible to find parking nearby
2018-12-30,4,Very expensive but food is really good and customer service is AMAZING. Even during their busiest times they stay calm and organized.
2018-12-29,3,Just ok. They were pretty cheap with the beetroot hummus for the Beirut. But I would still come back to try other stuff. All the fresh bagels in the shelves look really good. Otherwise, underwhelmed by the Beirut. Supposed to be Zaatar spices on the grilled zucchini (i.e. thyme and sesame) but didn't taste anything.
2018-12-28,2,Good bagels but ordered a dozen bagels for a weekend trip and they only gave me 9 bagels... very disappointed
2018-12-27,5,Can't imagine a better bagel anywhere. Best I've ever had. Get there early as the cinnamon and raisin was sold out by noon.
2018-12-27,4,Growing up in Jersey inherently makes you a bagel snob. When i want a good bagel, it should come warm and rip apart with ease. Its a very hard thing to find, but O'bagel is the closest thin you'll get to bagel glory in hoboken/JC. Love the specialty sandwiches (the early bird is my go to) and the cold brew on tap is a nice touch. Only qualm is that the layout isn't exactly the best for waiting in line or waiting for your order but how much can you knock a place for being packed! Business is good and for a reason.
2018-12-22,5,After reading all the 1-2 star reviews about running out of bagels and delivery time taking to long, I put my shoes in and walked the 5 blocks to try it.  I was not disappointed. Everything bagel was crispy on the outside and chewy in the inside.  The counter workers were polite despite the long line.  I found my new bagel shop.
2018-12-20,5,Love it here! Best bagels in Hoboken. The line is usually long but it is worth the wait. Recently I had no cash and the girl at the counter allowed me to use my credit card even though I didn't reach the card limit. She was kind and considerate and my experience better. The coffee is also very good!
2018-12-16,1,My husband went to pick up bagels for us. We orders the Beirut (Vegan) which is advertised as a bagel with roasted VEGETABLES. I've attached a photo of the photo they have on their website and a photo of what WE received which is a bagel with a few strips of bland zucchini and a thin spread of beet hummus. To top it all off there was a piece of BACON in my supposed vegan bagel!! We paid $9 each for these bagels!!! Needless to say we are BEYOND disappointed and will not be returning.
2018-12-07,4,Love O'Bagel! My favorite specialty I've tried so far is the Scaly T but I also enjoyed the Jim Halpert (and also ordering the "Jim Halpert"). Favorite bagel is the cinnamon raisin, classic go-to. Recommend getting the bagel toasted, make sure you don't forget to ask.Wish they had a little more seating, especially for the winter months when outdoor seating isn't an option, but it's Hoboken and space is limited.
2018-12-03,4,Some of the best bagels I've ever had living in Jersey. The place is small and gets crowded quickly but is definitely worth the wait! My favorite is an everything bagel with egg, cheese and avocado! Absolutely amazing and super filling. The ridge diablo is another go to! I would definitely go back and try other combinations.
2018-11-20,1,This review is from two customers who left hungry outside of the shop thanks to their lack of knowledge of their food menu.-- Possibly great options for vegetarian) healthy crowd but order taking personal don't know what they can take or not-- Whole wheat bagel was not available. Guess, have extra stock for healthier options?-- Order talking person could not find out what cheese they had - so we ended up having Bagel without cheese. We were looking for any pastureized cheese-- Worst joke is their vegan spread sandwich. No where in the menu it said, they ginna use twi breads and move on. May be I did and may be I was wrong. So I asked for clarification. Didn't get any meaningful answer. I did ask the order taking personal what it is, but he couldn't explain. Result? We ended up with a bread and a touch of hummus - which promised to have chickpea and grilled beet - had none. Sure it was a miscommunication, but I asked your rep about what it is but again who cares about vegetarian anyways-- They cook meat and veggies on same grill, if it matters to you We ended up wasting 9$ and more importantly, missed our only chance to have something to eat for breakfast.
2018-11-04,3,Bagel toasted, that was fantastic! The rest sadly not great.I ordered a poppy seed bagel toasted w butter, cream cheese and a tomato.  Cream cheese had 0 flavor and was slightly filmy, and there was a least a cup of it on it, tomatoes were light pale pink, also no flavor and there was no butter. Maybe that's a good thing. I'd like to go back again. The place always smells like burnt stuff though,  could be cleaner, many dudes standing around behind the counter,  who ever helped me was friendly though. I guess, step it up guys!  Better quality products.
2018-10-30,4,So I came back to this place and gave it a second chance because my first experience was not really all that pleasant.  I decided to come back and wooahhhh!!! I was craving a delicious fulfilling bagel and that's exactly what this place delivered . I got the ridge diablo !!! Omgsh ! This was filled with all sorts of flavor exploration , if you love jalapeños this is the bagel  for you ! You can always remove the jalepeños, the chipotle sauce is delicious on its own. If you want something quick , flavorful and fulfilling this is the bagel you should get. It's also one of your most popular ones and it was recommended to me by the really nice man taking my order ! I believe his name was johnny totally made my morning ! O bagel you redeemed ourself only because of johnny and his suggestion ! Please please turns into a taco place at night , I have to come back for that !
2018-10-28,5,Ate a bagel here this morning. Was one of the best bagels I've ever had. Was a bagel sandwich called the Scaly T, 10/10 would recommend. Such a jammy egg, super friendly staff, eat here if you want to feel happiness in the form of a bagel.
2018-10-27,1,We ordered three bagels. Toasted everything with butter, toasted everything with S Cream cheese and a whole wheat bagel with eggs and bacon. Absolutely everything came wrong. Everything. Even after I called and told them to look after the order because it has come wrong every time in the past three weekends. They have refused to replace anything and said they are too busy to toast any bagels. THIS PLACE IS AWFUL (bagels are amazing) but the staff and accommodations are far below anything I have ever experience in this town (or any other town) in the 30 plus years.  AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL.
2018-10-20,5,This place serves the best bagels in Hoboken, baked on the premises and served up by a very friendly staff. Our specialty is a toasted sesame with cream cheese and capers, which they remember every time we walk in the door, which is often! Or you can order more elaborate bagel specials from the menu.Kombacha on tap!!
2018-10-13,2,2 stars because the bagel was pretty good but overall experience wasn't. Long and slow-moving line to order. Was 10am and they were somehow out of everything bagels and out of iced coffee. After leaving saw my bagel order was incorrect and missing items. Overall very disappointing.
2018-10-12,5,***for the pop up***You've heard about the bagels. You know the diablo is legit . Do you know about the late night pop up Loquito Taqueria?!?!? This...is...genius! Every bagel spot needs a late night pop-up. (Why waste good real estate?) Loquito features a simple (in concept NOT taste) menu of tacos (pork, chicken, short rib and veggie) sides like street corn, waffle fries (seasoned to perfection) and churros for your sweet tooth. Oh I left something out...the cheeziedilla. It's only the BEST menu item. Not that hard to guess, it's a quesadilla taco. Don't assume it's a Taco Bell knockoff, this dilla is life. Topped with charred corn elotes, and fressssshhh queso it's everything you never knew you wanted. It comes with chicken but you can switch for a different protein. I personally LOVE their short rib and would highly recommend it in taco or dilla form. So what are you waiting for?? Run don't walk...but really I'm not joking, when they run out of something you're SOL. They currently open at 5pm but I think will be moving to a 9pm opening soon. So if you're in pajamas by 8 like me you should probably get off your butt and get a taco! OR you can just order from seamless but either way, EAT MORE TACOS.
2018-10-08,3,I've gotten bagels from here before and never had any problems in the past. I ordered two bagels from here a few weeks ago. They gave me a plain bagel when I asked for an everything (the receipt reflected the correct order, so the cooks screwed it up), but my boyfriend's order was fine - not really a big deal, it happens. I just ordered two more bagels from here. I specifically checked my bagel when I was still in O'Bagel. I saw poppy seeds all over the foil, so I figured I didn't need to inspect any further. I got home, opened it up, and it was another plain bagel. My boyfriend's bagel was also stale and hard as a rock, it was almost inedible. Unfortunately I'm torn since I've had some good experiences with O'Bagel in the past. I would definitely recommend opening the bagels before leaving and checking that the orders are correct - I definitely will if and when I come back!
2018-09-30,4,O'Bagel is where the Hoboken carboholics come to unite.  Came around 11am on a Saturday and there was a line out the door.  Don't be intimidated by the line, because it actually moves pretty quickly and I was in and out of the store in less than 10 minutes. The storefront is quite small so there's limited seating indoors, but they do have a few tables outside for you to enjoy your coffee & bagels.The bagels here are soft, chewy and fresh.  I also appreciate the wide variety of bagels and spreads.  It's pricier than some other bagel shops in the area, but I personally find the quality to be much better than the competition.  At times, there's a taco pop up shop that shares the same space with O'Bagel.
2018-09-30,2,Very disappointing. Ordered an egg bagel with tuna. Was charged 6+ dollars for this crap. Tuna is dry and they were cheap and hardly put anything on.
2018-09-29,2,I was very disappointed with the bacon egg and cheese sandwich as there was barely any egg in it. The bagel itself was good but they really need to improve their portions considering their high prices.
2018-09-28,3,Tacos by night - good tasting taco but they don't have sour cream - told me authentic Mexican doesn't have sour cream but I have been to Mexico and they have given me sour cream.. so...
2018-09-28,2,Don't close the grill an hour before you close. Ridiculous. Takes 15 min to clean it. Cooks were rushed and distracted, counter gal had to correct them twice. I ordered toasted bagel. Not even warmed up. The cooks shouldn't rush late orders,it costs you customers when quality suffers and food isn't prepared correctly. The young lady behind the counter was excellent and offered to fix my food. Very disappointed
2018-09-25,5,Tried this place on a Wednesday morning. I got the Watchung Warrior and it was delicious, my only regret is I didn't add a hash brown. My husband built his own sandwich which consisted of pretty much every meat offered, except the sausage, egg, pepper jack cheese & chipotle aoli - it was absolutely amazing! The aoli is so good! Will definitely come back.
2018-09-21,1,Today a (1 star review). Left after having to wait as the salesperson discussed the tattoo of customer in line.  Please when you see a line would you act accordingly?  This is unusual but I was in a hurry.  I generally give this place 5 stars
2018-09-15,5,Great food, great service, and an amazing staff. I pass by there at least 5 times a week for the amazing watchung warrior and the early bird. But the tacos they have at night are to die for. My new late night spot and it was delivered to my front door step under 30 minutes. Keep it up!!!!!
2018-09-12,5,O'Bagel is simply the best! Stephen's so creative, and the bagels are perfection every. time. The "Lox and Loaded" is my old reliable/go-to, but every time I try something new, it's super delish! It can get packed on weekends, so be sure to get there early!
2018-09-11,5,These bagels are the best! Whenever I go into the store everyone is always super friendly and helpful. Also, no joke, their chicken salad is the best I've ever tasted in my life. Do yourself a favor and order a scooped out everything bagel with chicken salad for lunch. It will change your life.
2018-09-11,5,I'm always looking for a solid breakfast sandwich shop wherever I go, and O'Bagel is easily the best north jersey has to offer. They do crazy sandwich concoctions really well (anything with pork products is a win) and have a very solid PEC (even though they call it Taylor ham, but I'll forgive them). It's a very busy spot during normal breakfast hours so I always go a little past the rush where it's normally little to no line or wait. Overall, definitely a great breakfast experience.
2018-09-11,4,O'Bagel is one of my top places in hoboken for a seriously delicious jersey bagel- really there's nothing else like um. they are huge and fluffy with a solid crunch when toasted. I love that they offer fun assorted sandwiches to choose from too (in addition to the standard breakfast sandwiches and cream cheese). One of my favorite sandwiches is the Ridge Diablo (add the hashbrown, trust me). It's a spicy, meaty mess. It really is a perfect hangover cure. it's also so filling, you won't need to eat again for a long time.
2018-09-10,4,With many bagel stores in (downtown) Hoboken.. one might think you have a plethora of choices but really the only choice is O'bagel in "midtown" Hoboken. The bagels are always fresh because it's so popular that they run out fast! My go to is the NJ Classic -Taylor Ham (pork roll for you south jersey country folk), Egg and cheese on a whole wheat everything but the special breakfast sandwiches look to die for as well... think hashbrowns and pastrami and all sorts of good stuff!!Since I live in north west Hoboken-- I hope and wish and pray that O'bagel will continue to have great success and open a second Hoboken location close to Trader Joe's although it probably doesn't hurt for me to walk 6 blocks and a few streets over to Washington !! Since my original review, for coffee, the milk is now in a fridge for self serve. I love this addition because before someone had a heavy hand and I usually ended up with milk with a splash of coffee. Regardless, I'm thinking up my next excuse to get myself to O'bagel !!
2018-09-09,1,Ok so the bagels are amazing and so are all their add ons.. it would be even better if they actually ever got my order right. I keep trying becasue I have friends who swear by this place.. but I just left walked home 8 blocks in the rain and opened my taylor ham, egg, and cheese to find a hashbrown and taylor ham on a bagel with no egg or cheese.. this ismt the 1st time. Last time a different order my tomatoes and onions were missing. I've also had under cooked egg on a sandwich. I would rather wait the extra 5 minutes and get my order right then have the staff rushing through everything and getting home to have to eat something I didn't want..
2018-09-08,5,Gringo Burrito is  WILL NOT  DISAPPOINT...it was my first time going and the staff was friendly and I was in a bit of a hurry and the food got out quick...Gringo Burrito was truly amazing can't wait to try some other stuff on the menu.
2018-09-04,4,If you want something a little different than your traditional east coast bagel and smear, I'd suggest O'Bagel. The bagels are super fresh and the sandwich options/toppings seems endless. I had the jalapeño popper sandwich whileMy girlfriend had the Jim Halpert.  We finished every last bite of both sandwiches and walked out of there with big smiles across our faces
2018-08-31,1,Honestly this place has good bagels... my issue is after coming here once every over week for quite some time they give me the right order less than 50% of the time. Unfortunately you're essentially forced to go here due to the fact that Hoboken literally has no one else that makes half decent bagels
2018-08-27,5,Favorite bagels in Hoboken! Made fresh and never disappoint. My go to bagel to bring along when visiting people from out of state who want "NJ" Bagels.  From breakfast to brunch, this spot (O'Bagels) has you covered.
2018-08-20,5,This place is just WOW! Probably the best bagel place- I had the everything bagel with Taylor ham egg and cheese and it was soooo good! The lines are long but go by really fast- so you're in and out!
2018-08-18,4,Finally made it ! Rainy Saturday morning, it was pretty busy around 11:30-12pm we were overwhelmed a bit by the menu- but also on where to get a menu.. We were looking for a large chalk board or something- we ordered breakfast sandwiches, mine an egg and cheese and his a speciality sandwich Ridge Diablo which had a spicy kick- it was really good. We didn't eat much for the rest of the day... I liked my eggs but felt it could have been a bit cheesier-  I also wanted my bagel to be more cinnamon/raisin packed- it was kinda basic but that may have been my fault. I would return! The service was good and I'm happy to support local business!
2018-08-13,5,O'Bagel is one of my favorite bagel spots in the area and an excellent representation of Jersey bagels! They offer a wide variety of bagels and the sandwiches can be created on any of the flavors. The bagel sandwiches are loaded and very satisfying as a meal. We added hashbrowns as a bagel topping along with meat egg and cheese (photos attached) but there were tons of other options to try including a variety cream cheeses, lox, and other classics. O'Bagel is open late and has outdoor seating available to customers when the weather allows for it. The outdoor very nice outdoor seating, and has a Washington Street view in addition to a few indoor tables. They have done collaborations to create a large pizza bagel that I've seen on their Instagram and definitely want to try soon too! It looks perfect for a party :)
2018-08-13,5,What a great bagel spot in Hoboken, NJ. I was extremely impressed with the fresh ingredients and the perfect hand rolled bagels, soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The staff is friendly and extremely accommodating to the needs of their customers. The perfect hangover cure for a Sunday morning, a must try!
2018-08-13,5,What a place! The staff was courteous and personable, especially Stephen. He was very patient with me and my friend (new to Hoboken) and explained his favorites. I went with the French toast bagel with the sweet nuts spread. My friend got the ridge Diablo per Stephens suggestion and wow was that good! Best bagels I've ever had.
2018-08-12,5,Another awesome bagel experience. The firehog cream cheese with cheddar and jalapeño was delicious. The cheddar went well with Jalapeños. Big fan of this place
2018-08-11,1,DONT ORDER DELIVERY FROM OBAGEL Waited over an hour for my food. Tried calling them 5 times and it just kept ringing with no answer. Spoke with Seamless who couldn't reach them as well and then helped me cancel my order. I'm sure the food is delicious but I'll never know because I'm never ordering from them again.
2018-08-09,4,The bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches are really solid here.  Bagels are quality.  Crunchy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside.  Workers are pleasant with good customer service.  Prices are reasonable.  Very well run restaurant.Lines can get a little crazy on Saturday or Sunday morning as the young people and Stevens students want their breakfast sandwiches after a night of partying.  You may be waiting 10-15 minutes if the line is crazy.  Other than 10am-12pm on the weekends the line is normal and not like this.  I think O'Bagel has the best bagels in Hoboken.
2018-08-09,5,I love O'Bagel's breakfast sandwiches!  There is something about the bagels themselves that push these to another level.  It is to the point that I find myself craving them at least once a week.  Also on occasion the will do a pop up shop with taco and they are some of the best flavors combinations I've ever had.
2018-08-07,5,THE GREATEST BAGEL SHOP EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI  if you're looking for that authentic NY/NJ bagel this is the only place you need to check out. The craziest items, the tastiest food and hands down the dopest spot in Hoboken. Perfect for that Saturday morning hangover cure or hump day lunch, they have it all. Nothing beats the ridge diablo add a hash brown hold the jalapeños and make it extra saucy  check it out ASAP...you won't be disappointed - @bobs_eats
2018-08-07,5,Fast service and great bagels! Love this place i always being my visitors here to try great New Jersey bagels. You should bring your friends here!
2018-07-26,5,This place really does have the best bagels in NJ! Had the Lox n Loaded bagel and was instantly addicted! Will definitely stop by again when I'm back in town! I'd come to NJ just for their bagels!
2018-07-17,5,O'Bagel?! OH YES!!The only place in Hoboken I'd get up at the crack of dawn to go to on a Saturday. Some of the freshest bagels I've ever had! Every order is made with love and their wonderful staff will only make your overall experience there that much better!
2018-07-17,5,Great food, great service & great location, what more can someone ask for? O'bagel takes breakfast & lunch on a bagel to another level. From classic breakfast sandwiches to the famous #JUMBOBAGEL (which I need to get asap!) to burritos. I have been here twice and have been impressed each and everytime. I am always a classic BEC Hashbrown or SEC Hashbrown type of girl but Obagel's options make me change up my style. Check out their instagram for more drooling food inspirations to make sure you get there ASAP  :)
2018-07-17,5,O'Bagel has some of the best bagels that you'll find in Hoboken, I get my breakfast from this place practically every weekend. Make sure you try their Sinatra or the Ridge Diablo when you visit.Great food and excellent customer service!
2018-07-16,5,The bagels are so good & so is the service. They have bagel sandwiches, one of which had bbq on it. I really liked their variety of cream cheeses and bagels. I got a cinnamon raisin bagel with honey walnut cream cheese. Delicious. I'd definitely love to come back.
2018-07-03,2,Bagels are generally good when they decide to get your order right. Usually the staff is busy preparing takeout orders and completely ignoring in store customers. How could a bagel with cream cheese take 15 minutes with no in store customers ahead of you?  That's literally impossible but it's what happens at O'Bagel.
2018-06-29,4,This is my favorite bagel! Delicious and very reasonable in prices. Will come back here again and highly recommend. Yum
2018-06-24,2,This place sucks. I waited 20 minutes for two god forsaken sandwiches and one of them was wrong. The other was cold. Wtf. At least they can rest easy knowing that every other bagel place in Hoboken also sucks.
2018-06-24,4,Been to O'Bagel before, but had a notably solid experience the other day. I came to the store after a grueling spin class only to find that the line was noticeably shorter than normal (I.e. not out the door). Maybe it was due to seasonality, maybe it was time of day, but either way, I was excited to get a bagel!The place is a small storefront with a visible kitchen and only a few tables, so expect to grab and go. They have a decent variety of bagel flavors, spreads, toppings and specialty sandwiches without overwhelming the customer. I went with the Lox and Loaded (no capers, no tomato) on whole wheat everything, and while they gave me regular everything instead, I wasn't going to complain; honest mistakes happen.The bagel itself is exactly what you want to taste when you think of a bagel: crispy and flavorful outside, soft and chewy inside. The scallion cream cheese wasn't overpowering or overly rich, and complimented the lox well. The lox itself was thick and not too salty, with crisp and fresh onion and cucumber to round things out.This is easily one of the best bagel places, if not the best, in Hoboken. Definitely worth a try.
2018-06-20,1,The sanitation practices here are unacceptable. Same person worked the cash register and made my bagel, wearing the same glove (just one, on one hand??) for both activities.
2018-06-14,5,There is no bagel place that compares to OBagel! I moved to San Diego two years ago and one of the things I miss most is a good bagel. Every time I visit the east coast I make sure to get a breakfast sandwich everyday. I highly recommend for everyone to go everyday. Forever. Please open out on the west coast!
2018-06-03,5,Easily the best bagels around. I am #blessed to live across the street from O'Bagel and get to go there all the time. They cook each sandwich to order and the bagels are made perfectly. I recommend everything from a regular bagel with butter to a sausage egg and cheese to this bagel sandwich they do with turkey, chipotle cream cheese, and cucumbers.It can get a little busy on weekend mornings, but the wait is worth it! My only (very small) critique is that I would love if they started making a cheese bagel.
2018-06-02,3,Best bagel shop in hoboken yet may want to try a place that can actually get a 2 bagel order correct also expensive.  Would give a 4 if they can get an order right
2018-05-15,5,O'Bagel is my favorite bagel spot in Hoboken. I've tried both the breakfast sandwiches and plain bagels and you cannot go wrong with either. I've seen a lot of reviews complaining about the wait. Sure, it can be annoying; but in the case of O'Bagel, the wait is long because they offer a good product, not because of poor organization.
2018-05-06,2,Disappointing.. Highly do not recommend ordering delivery, especially on the weekend. Expected delivery was 30-45mins and it took over 2.5 hours.
2018-04-29,2,Food is great no complaints ON that but the price is ASTRONOMICAL. I wanted a Becky sandwich but on toast instead a bagel.... seems like a downgrade so it should be less or the same price, no? I also wanted egg whites. Which I understand is an upcharge, cool no problem. But instead of 5.75 it was 10.00!!!! What?? No thanks. I went straight to Hoboken Bagels Down the Block and I got a sandwich that was identical and an iced coffee ALL for 6.50. Go there instead to save your soul and you wallet.
2018-04-15,2,I have been a resident of Hoboken for four years and frequent bagel shops on Sundays. O'Bagel is always the most crowded and they do have good bagels, but that's as far as it goes. Every time I have been there, they have either incorrectly given me something that I did not order or messed up my order completely. I have waited for over 25 minutes for an egg sandwich on a bagel, and it was still wrong (no salt, pepper, or ketchup). I have given this place numerous second chances but today was the last straw. My fiancé ordered an $11 bagel with lox. When we got home after our 10 minute walk home we saw that they gave her only ONE thin slice of lox. See picture. They kindly threw in ONE tomato slice and a few pieces of onion. In the past when they messed up the order or lost my ticket for my entire order, they would apologize and once gave a free crumb cake (old and tossed it). We called their number 5 times to let them know about the "lox" order and no pick up. If you want a bagel with cream cheese, you will enjoy it so long as they get your order right. As for anything else, visit one of the many other bagel shops in Hoboken.
2018-04-13,4,Let me start off on a positive note: the bagel sandwich combinations are delicious. I've tried many of them and my favorite is the Watchung warrior on an onion/egg bagel with a hash brown. The bagel selection is good too, but make sure you get there earlier on busy days as some bagels run out quickly. I haven't tried any of their cream cheeses yet so I can't really review the quality and taste of them. Now to why I didn't give five stars: as most people say, there is often a long line with long wait times. The workers do work pretty fast and efficiently so you aren't waiting TOO long. However, my main gripe is how often they forget to add the hash brown onto my sandwich. The past 4-5 times I've visited (I usually go once a week), they've forgotten to add the hash brown onto my sandwich when I clearly told the cashier to add a hash brown (for $1 extra on certain sandwiches). I've either had to watch them make my sandwich and remind them to add the hash brown on before they package my sandwich up, or I've had to open the sandwich up after I get it and ask them to add it in. Forgetting once or twice is fine, but consistently forgetting isn't right. The good thing is that they always apologize when I tell them and they've always added the hash brown afterwards. Overall, pretty efficient service for the amount of people that come here, and the bagel sandwiches always taste delicious. Just make sure that if you're paying for a hash brown to be added to your sandwich, check to see that it was added before you leave the place.
2018-03-31,4,BEST BAGEL SPOT IN HOBOKEN. Hands down. I've tried every bagel shop in the area and was consistently disappointed. I got sick at some places, had bad butter and bagels that were hard as a rock. I was losing hope on Hoboken bagels. Then, my roommates and I found O'Bagel...This is now our go to spot. From plain bagels, to breakfast sandwiches, everything is fresh and absolutely delicious. The interior is also very nice for a bagel shop! The only downside is the wait time. A huge line forms on the weekends and the inside gets very hot. However, I will say these bagels are absolutely worth it. Go enjoy!
2018-03-29,4,Bring on the deliciousness!!! I LOVE CARBS as their t-shirts proudly proclaim!You are in for a treat if you come here for your bagels and bagel sandwiches! Upon moving to the NJ/NYC area I spent weeks searching high and low at well knowns and dives to find the signature staple - a great place for bagels. Finally I made it to O'Bagel bringing my exhaustive search to a finale - and what a finale it is!Not only do they offer a wonderful selection of hand rolled fresh, doughy, flavor packed bagels, but they have a huge creative and delicious selection of breakfast and lunch sandwiches. I highly recommend the 'ridge diablo' fully loaded with hash browns (they put right on the sandwich!). This classic little aisle deli style cafe has high tables on the left and don't be surprised by the line that forms to the right - it's worth the wait - and they hustle! You can even observe them boiling bagels in the back and enjoy your bagel under an umbrella on the sidewalk terrace in the summer months. Oh, and this  facebook.com/Thrillist/v...A+++
2018-03-27,4,Incredible bagels and sandwiches! Came here on a Sunday morning and although there was a little bit of a line, at 10am it wasn't bad and it moved very quickly. After taking the order, I got my food within 5 minutes which was some impressive timing.I got the Diablo with the hash brown add on. The egg, bacon, hash brown and delightfully fresh made everything bagel made everything right with the world. The jalapenos were a nice touch too and I loved this spicy breakfast sammy.Being a lox fanatic, I splurged on their "Lox and Loaded" bagel too...at $11+, it's their most expensive sandwich, but they definitely do not skimp on the lox and it goes well with the cream cheese, capers; definitely delightful. I wouldn't be spending that kind of dough every day, but for a visit to NJ--it was delightful!
2018-03-25,4,Awesome bagels!!! My favorite is the Ridge Diablo, recommended with the hash brown. Weekends the line can be pretty long but it goes pretty quick.
2018-03-19,1,So disappointing. I checked out the menu online and walked across town from my apartment for the sandwich that looked amazing to find out that they were "changing the menu next week" and didn't have the ingredients. Against my better judgment I substituted and it was not good. And so skimpy on the ingredients they did have. The last time I was there I got home to find they screwed up my order but let it go. I'm done with this place. Overpriced, underwhelming and always a wait.
2018-03-18,5,Really great bagels and amazing sandwiches. Fantastic service too, the line is always insanely long, but moves super quick. My go to bagel spot. Try the Ridge Diablo.
2018-03-11,1,Got sick after eating here - both me and my friend. Also price is $20 for two bagel sandwiches. Pretty ridiculous for what you get.
2018-03-10,2,To Start: Amazing food, awesome marketing and great menu choices if you eat meat. CONS: On the custom sandwich side there were not a lot of vegetarian options. I would love to see some options without meat, but still have egg and cheese. Order- I ordered (2) sandwiches and paid extra for both to have a hashbrown. Both came out without the hashbrown. I tried calling back, nobody answered. I also tried writing a review on Grubhub as well as using the 'contact us' feature on O'Bagels website and heard nothing back. For spending $16 on two sandwiches I would have expected better customer service. I will return, however be very careful and check your sandwiches. They get so busy on Sundays that the quality slips.
2018-03-05,5,Extra points for having my favorite Whole Wheat everything bagel! And EXTRA extra points for their awesome shirts which said 'I heart carbs' on the back of them! Cute *tiny* bagel shop on Washington Street in Hoboken - we were walking around after staying with friends and this place was right on our meanderings!! As you walk past the blacked-out bagel spot, you're faintly hit with the delicious smell of bagels mixed with breakfast meats.  Once you open the door, it's a whole different ball game.  The smells waft over you as you're transported to a bagel oasis.  YUM.The place is TINY tiny, and you have to make your way towards the line in the back, swimming upstream against the line of patrons waiting towards the front for their orders.  The bagels are all displayed behind clear plexiglass, so you can see what they have/they're out of.  Not that it's an actual decision though, because when they have whole wheat everything, you order whole wheat everything...There were 4 of us, we all ordered different sandwiches and paid - they had tons of different breakfast specials advertised on menus and digital screens above the cashier.  The wait was probably about 10 minutes, which seemed like a long time - but the place was bumpin' and you could tell the staff was working really hard!  The bagels were fluffy and chewy - the perfect balance.  YUMMY.  The whole wheat everything was great, slight subtle sweet hint from the whole wheat, and salty/garlicky/deliciousness from the everything seeds.
2018-03-02,4,Being a New Yorker this place doesn't have the best bagels I've ever tasted (but prob the best in Hoboken), however it's always satisfying and has really interesting options.  These guys are creative and always trying to do something new (taco Fridays over the summer) and for that I give them credit!  It gets crowded on weekend days but the line moves relatively quickly and it's worth it.Only downside is every single time I've gone, they are out of cold brew...just make more plz.The staff is always energetic which is impressive considering they're working weekend morning shifts.  Keep it up!
2018-02-26,4,Only go to O'Bagel during the week since Saturday and Sunday there's a line out the door of yuppies. Its a little over priced but the food is great and tastey.  However there is a new chef I keep getting there that REFUSES to make  your bagel correctly or put egg on it. Egg is  almost paper thin.
2018-02-22,5,My boyfriend and I go here on weekends. Usually a little wait weekend mornings but line moves fast. Bagels are good and staff friendly. Highly recommend!
2018-02-04,4,They DO bagels... never expected bagels can be made like a big meal. The kitchen is right behind the counter. I ordered Lox n Loaded... oh man very fresh and filling. There's always a long line. Definitely go back.
2018-02-03,4,I've been here a few times and it's been good for every visit.  It meets all of my bagel shop standards: they don't screw up my order, there are usually salt bagels left by the time I arrive on a Saturday, and they remember the pepper and ketchup.  They also have a few different sandwich options you won't find anywhere else in Hoboken.
2018-02-02,5,Great food, great service, I will definitely return next time I'm in town!! I got the Stevens duck I believe and it was delicious, wonderful recommendation
2018-01-29,5,I have finally found a decent regular bagel place! Their Black Russian (aka Pumpernickel) and Cinnamon Raisin bagels are the best. I don't even like Cinnamon Raisin. The breakfast sandwiches are generally pretty good but can be hit or miss and kind of pricey at $8+. Their cream cheese is probably the weak link, but the bagels are that perfect texture - soft on the inside but almost crispy on the outside. A good bagel doesn't actually need to be toasted, and these are good bagels.I think the overall rating of this place is only 3.5 stars because of the service. I can't say I've had any of the service issues others have described. I generally go in the middle of the day on weekdays, though. Anyway, food is 5/5 stars as long as you stick to what they're good at, which is the bagels.
2018-01-23,4,Really great bagels! Never dry and they have lots of options!
2018-01-22,1,watched the guy with tattoos on both his forearms sweep through the entire store and then definitely did not wash his hands -  then he scratched his crotch as he approached me to take order - I placed the order anyway assuming he would put gloves on -  weirdly he only gloved his left hand, while his right hand ( the one that scratched his crotch) did most of the work putting my sandwich together. I didn't want to make a scene so I took it anyway, and tried to eat the part that didn't touch the crotch-hand. Sandwich/bagel was not good anyway. Won't be back.
2017-12-18,4,Great bagels. They are NY style, fresh and flavorful. Would revisit when in the area.
2017-12-17,3,I like the different combinations they have with the bagel sandwiches. I ordered the Sinatra which was sausage, egg, arugula, and Tuscan cream cheese. It was tasty and well cooked. They cut my bagel very poorly in half which made it difficult to eat. I also felt it was pricey for the size. In comparison to other jersey bagel spots, the bagels were smaller than usual.
2017-12-17,5,Wish I had discovered this place sooner in my five years of living in Hoboken. Eating the lox and loaded and it's divine. Bagel is delicious, ingredients fresh and generous helping of salmon. The service great too, I hope this place continues to thrive
2017-12-15,1,Bought a bagel from here and was charged $1.85 I have found Obagel only charges $1.00 a bagel is this some kind of scam ? The bagel was ok at best not worth double the price nearly ..... be aware of this scam
2017-11-23,3,3 Stars   Would be more if not for ignorant jerk at register arguing that bagels were not included in the takeout order of sandwiches in spite of receipt showing it. All but accused us of lying until other attendant held up a bag with bagels and our name on it.  No apology.   Must not know how to read or care. Should be removed to boil water.
2017-11-10,5,the BEST bacon egg n cheese in town! a little pricier than other places but totally worth it. A+
2017-11-06,4,My Hoboken friends tell me this is one of the better bagels you can get in the area. I thought it was pretty myself. A simple everything bagel with cream cheese gets the jobs done.  A bit steep at $2.50 but that's hip City pricing for you.The first time I went I apparently cut the entire as I just walked straight to register and ordered ahead of a guy looking at me funny.  I figured everyone was just waiting for their coffee and bagels. Nope. The line really was that long.My friend spent $17 on a breakfast sandwich, bagel with cream cheese, and 2 iced coffees. That seems crazy to me. In conclusion, stop by and grab a bagel unless you're in a hurry and it is a weekend morning.
2017-10-22,1,0 stars if possible!!!!! Made and order on line 2 hours  before closing. Got 2 calls bc they were out of everything I ordered. I understand it's the end of the day and that's fine. I changed my order which took 4 times fr the person I was talking with to understand and get correct. After an hour they then call me and say they can not process my order bc they are now closing.  Terrible communication and customer service. I will stick to my wonder bagel on central and Congress station on Palisades.
2017-10-20,5,Decided to try this place on my way to the train in the morning. My bagel with cream cheese was very good. Will definitely return and try an egg sandwich.
2017-10-07,4,Great little bagel shop to get your morning going. It's a busy joint in the morning and even though there's seating inside and outside - taking your order to go is the best option. It was crowded but I think that just helps sell the place even more. There's a TON of bagel and cream cheese options along with beverages (great cold brew coffee!)To be able to call a crowd for bagels in a very finicky bagel population (Hoboken and New Yorkers take their bagels VERY seriously) is a testament for how well the product is made. The bagel was doughy and freshly baked. They toasted it perfectly and added on a healthy smear of cream cheese. Overall - a good experience for a solid bagel and coffee to get your morning off on the right foot. Enjoy!!
2017-10-02,5,O'Bagel is a necessity. Sure, the weekends are packed, but when you get through the line it is totally worth it. Their signature combinations and fresh bagels are a gam changer and there is a reason as to why they are #1 in Hoboken. Run by a great family, Stephen and his sisters have been able to change the food scene in the 201 and I cannot wait to see what else they come up with!
2017-09-30,5,Usually long wait on Saturday mornings when I go- but worth the wait. Really good bagel and bagel sandwiches. I like to pick it up when I have friends over- always a crowd pleaser
2017-09-24,4,I have been going here for a year and I can say that they make the best bagels one can buy with money - 5/5 for food. The only problem (which for me became a deciding factor to go to other bagel shops most of the time) is lines and wait times - during weekends if you come after 7 or 8 am, you have to prepare to spend an hour in the line + for the food. This is very sad, especially since they don't take pre-orders so that you could just come to pick up your food.
2017-09-11,5,THE BEST BREAKFAST SANDWICHES IN HOBOKEN! They have such a creative and unique twist on the basic breakfast sandwich, they are all so good! I highly recommend the Ridge Diablo or Lox n Loaded! They're both one of my favorites besides getting a basic bagel and cream cheese! The line might be out the door,but the wait is not bad at all!
2017-09-11,3,Used to love O'Bagel but the last few times have been disappointing. A few weeks ago we ordered two bagel sandwiches and waited outside for almost 20 minutes to get our food only to find that all of the onions on the onion bagel were completely burnt. Last time I went on a Sunday morning, I ordered a bagel and cream cheese but their toaster wasn't working so they couldn't toast the bagel, so we opted to go elsewhere.
2017-09-10,4,I think that people that are complaining about the lack of seeds on a their bagels should come back at 7am. The bagels were hot, fresh outta the oven and had plenty of seeds (as evidenced by these pics). I had the Black Russian with cream cheese and bacon... delish! Hubs loved his jalapeño popper
2017-09-09,4,No issues I was there few weeks ago trying out their bagels. I pick an everything bagel with blueberry cream cheese The order was complete fast with lists of blueberry cream cheese! Super yum! Will be back again to try their sandwiches
2017-08-13,5,Ok so I've lived in Hoboken for three years and every single time I try to get a bagel at any bagel shop there will be a very long line. So I don't understand people complaining about long lines here on the weekend. So confused. Wha??? Yes the line gets long but 1. It's good and 2. It's a bagel shop located in a town where everyone tries to get bagels on the weekend!! The bagels are good. I like their lox n loaded. I think out of the dozens of times I have been here I've had a stale bagel ONCE and it was a Monday so I don't hold it against them. The service can be slow and yes they have messed up my order a couple of times, but 1 out of 10 ain't all that bad! Will definitely frequent them often and I'll go early BEFORE the line forms or when I have time to wait in said line.
2017-08-11,5,**was contacted and they said they were going to work on the below and that they were sorry to hear it so I consider that great**Had to lower the review by because I think they hired different people here and they were pretty rude to a customer when they pointed out that the TV screen description for the boken has prosciutto when they didnt add prosciutto onto their sandwich. The menu apparently says something different, but it should be consistent.  Needless to say, it was uncomfortable to see how rude they were to this customer when they were technically in the wrong.  There are still some friendly people who work here but it was definitely not good customer service today.
2017-08-11,2,The bagels are good but staff incompetent. I understand having to wait for an order to be grilled but 10 minutes for them to pull 2 dozen bagels is insane the register person could have done it quickly and had me on my way but instead i waited 5 minutes then I watched a girl struggle counting the bagels for another good 5 minutes. I thought they would figure out the work flow but still havent
2017-08-06,5,Just passing through Hoboken, I noticed this cool looking spot and decided to stop by. I really enjoyed the decor ambiance, and the nice vibe the store had going on. I ordered a breakfast sandwich and a coffee, the same thing that I order every day for heading to work at my local's bagel shop. I have to say that this bagel was for and away the best I've ever had. It was the perfect combination of chewy, soft, with a great crust.  The service and the coffee were solid also. For such a busy store, I was really impressed how the employees managed the customers. Overall, this is a must visit. And I will definitely be back next time I'm in town.
2017-08-06,5,Real bagels, good coffee, and awesome signature sandwiches. Place has a really cool vibe to it and the staff are super nice. Highly recommend
2017-08-06,5,Great bagels and great service! I've made the trip all the way from Queens just to get breakfast sandwiches from O'bagel. Every time I come I try something new and have not been disappointed yet. I highly recommend O'bagel.
2017-08-06,5,O'Bagel has become an institution in the hoboken community. It is one of the few places I know that does hand rolled bagels and you can really sense the difference. The menu has a lot of cool varities and I can't wait to try them all. All the workers are super helpful and the owner Steve has made me feel at home everytime. Keep up the good work O'Bagel!!!!
2017-07-30,4,Best bacon egg and cheese on a bagel in Hoboken.That being said it is expensive over 10 bucks for a breakfast sandwich and an iced coffee and the place can be packed and lines very long. I stay away from it on the weekends and treat myself every once and a while mid week to an outstanding breakfast sandwich.
2017-07-30,1,Sucks that I have to give this place 1 star because their bagels and pretty good, especially their sandwich selection. If I could give it 0 stars I would only because their service has to be one of the worst I have experienced. Three times now I have gone in on my walk to work to grab a dozen bagels, not sandwiches, just bag of bagels. I had to wait 30 minutes each time and had to ask a worker to get my bagels because I would be late to work. Owner needs to figure it out, hire someone else, your service is garbage. Also went in on a Friday morning at 730 am and someone ordered 10 bags of bagels. Only flavor left for customers was plain and egg. Be ready for orders so people aren't left with no selection. Too many other good bagel shops around and won't be going back.
2017-07-14,5,Best bagel this Florida girl ever had. Had a sesame seed bagel and was shocked to see seeds on the top and bottom. Never do you see that in Fla! Fresh and crispy with plain cream cheese. I am actually salivating. So I guess I will have to travel 2500 miles forGood pizza and bagels. I am spoiled now!
2017-07-13,5,There is a reason why this place is blowing up... awesome food and even better vibes, everyone is friendly, they're always adding awesome specialty items to the menu, and their cold brew coffee is a home run! Stop here if you haven't already, I got referred by a friend and they did not disappoint
2017-07-03,1,Ordered a simple egg and cheese on a bagel this morning. Maybe two other people waiting for orders. Somehow got egg and cheese with what looks like ketchup and mayo???? Obviously didn't notice until I got home and I wasn't marching back there for a $3 bagel. Disgusting and inedible.
2017-06-29,5,Pretty darn solid time ... these guys have a good spot and take good care across the board.
2017-06-28,5,If you like Bagels.. look no further.. best bagel and breakfast sandwiches in Hoboken. Variety of cream cheese are available.
2017-06-25,5,I don't usually leave reviews but this is by far the best bagel place I have had in Hoboken/Jersey City area. Taylor ham (pork roll) egg and cheese was spot on, with a very generous portion of Taylor ham!
2017-06-19,2,I've given this place three tries. If you're going in for something simple (i.e. bagel with butter) you'll probably be fine. Otherwise, steer clear. Bottom line is, the staff is incompetent. I know, I know, "it's a bagel shop," "they're just young," etc. etc. The cashier had to clarify my sandwich order six times. He seemed hungover. It was not a complicated sandwich. It was still made wrong. Another time, I was given two sandwiches with rotten avocado - not brown from oxidation - literally black mush. Stale rolls. Missing ingredients. There's just no use of common sense there. It baffles the mind that we can be so close to nyc, and have not one decent bagel shop. Sigh.
2017-06-14,4,Best bagel in the area. Always fresh when I get there. I love them!!!! Soft, full, and a crisp outside. REAL NJ BAGEL!
2017-06-08,3,Biggest fan of the ridge diablo. Sometimes I get a second one cuz it's that good, even if I am full. Some suggestions: they should offer fresh jalapeños and not just pickled. Tried the Sinatra and it was a let down. Didn't like how the sauce made the sandwich dry. I'll stick to the ridge diablo. Must try the Black Russian bagel.
2017-06-07,4,Great bagel however I'm giving this place 4 out of 5 stars because there was too much salt on the everything bagel than I would have liked. Couldn't taste any other topping than the salt which made it hard to finish my bagel. Other than that it was an overall great bagel place! Really good hazelnut coffee too!
2017-06-07,3,Their bagels alone aren't that great. There are definitely better quality bagels around. However, what they put on the bagels is delicious. Their lox is good quality, slightly more salty than I'm used to, but still enjoyable. The Taylor Ham, egg and cheese with a hash brown is the perfect remedy on a rough morning.
2017-06-03,5,I don't know what they put in their iced coffee but I swear it is the best I have ever had. I know thats strange for a bagel place but it really is just the greatest iced coffee ever! I found this place on yelp a year ago and have been back almost every Saturday/Sunday since. The breakfast sandwiches are really creative with so many options but they are also great at making a perfect plain bagel with cream cheese.
2017-05-28,5,Poppin' bagels! They hook it up! Love the options and customer service! Worth the trek over from downtown.
2017-05-14,4,The bagels here are amazing. Baked fresh and with a great selection. Off peak times, service is great and super friendly and very quick. During the morning rush, be prepared to wait a while. However, if you know what you want and order it on yelp via pickup, it'll save you a lot of time. The only thing I didn't necessarily like about the pickup process is that since the line is usually long at the register, and people are ordering left and right, it confused me for a bit on where/how I could ask for my pickup order when I actually got to the store. But once I got ahold of one of their staff by waving/asking for help things seemed to go quite smoothly.
2017-05-07,5,This place is the REAL DEAL! These are old school puffy ny bagels and spreads. The staff and atmosphere is really chill this is my spot when I'm coming through Hoboken.
2017-04-30,1,Not as good as Hoboken bagel. Their line moved slow, they are over priced. Walk 300 feet towards 7th street, you're better off
2017-04-24,2,I loved O'Bagel when it first opened but over the last few months the quality has gone down hill. Don't expect to order anything custom and have it come out like you wanted. I have gone  7 times now in the last 3 months and every time asked for the bacon well done and bagel toasted. Not once has the bagel been toasted or has the bacon even been close to being cooked, luke warm like the package just sat in the sun is a better description of the temperature of the bacon. I get it they are busy, but if i'm going to wait 15 min for my bacon, egg and cheese to cook; I would rather wait another 5 and actually have the bacon be cooked.
2017-04-22,4,Prices are high, service for grill items (i.e. Bacon egg and cheese) is slow, but they do have the best bagels I've had so far in Hoboken.
2017-04-22,3,The food is pretty solid, but at least half the time they make it wrong. When I'm not getting the ingredients I paid extra for (like a hash brown), it's hard to see why I would keep coming here over somewhere else. Go on a weekday when it's not that busy, otherwise don't bother.
2017-04-07,5,Best bagels and service around. Every time I'm back in town I make the pilgrimage. The quality and flavor is unrivaled. My go to is a Taylor ham, double egg, and cheese with SPK on an everything bagel. LOVE THIS PLACE!!!
2017-04-07,5,Best bagels ever! That is the reason why they got voted the best bagels in NJ, by nj.com This is a family ran business. Their hand rolled, new york style bagels are worth the carbs. I would highly recommend this place for the creation of their sandwiches. It's not a bagel unless it's an o'bagel!
2017-04-05,2,In short, it's overrated. It's very overpriced, even for Hoboken. A simple Taylor ham, egg and cheese on a bagel is about $7. 7! It's not great enough to warrant crazy prices. It also has a horrible layout since it used to be a bar. The bagels are pretty good so it gets very crowded on the weekend, but there's no room to wait for your food. There's basically one aisle where they expect people to stand in line to order, wait for their food, and sit to eat at bar stools. In my opinion, JP Bagels near the Path is just as good if not better, more reasonably priced in comparison, and a hell of a lot less pretentious.
2017-03-14,5,Fresh NY style bagels! Small space and seating is limited  but the bagels here are awesome. My usual is the whole wheat bagel with turkey bacon, egg, and the hash brown in the sandwich. They have a variety of bagels and love their own names on their bagel sandwiches. Will continue to visit and eat their delicious bagels!
2017-03-09,1,My review would be 0 * if it could! I placed an order and was charged for it almost 2 weeks in advance for a party I was having. I called the week of the party to confirm.. they read the order to me. The food was NEVER delivered! EVER! The phone lines were busy for about 4 hours.. when I finally got through to them, there was no apology of not delivering my order, when I questioned how the business could be run where you don't even have the decency to call me and let me know I wouldn't receive my food, I was told I was being insulting. To make matters worse, its 5 days later and I STILL haven't received my refund and I speak to someone daily!!!
2017-02-26,5,Honestly I'm shocked to see all these negative reviews, seems to me like someone has one slightly unpleasant time they come and make it look like the overall business is bad. This bagel shop is probably the best place I have been to, every time I walk in the employees are happy, friendly, and enthusiastic to work! I'm not going to lie the weekends do get busy but that doesn't stop the workers from busting those orders out in a timely manner AND with high quality ! The bagels are fresh, they listen and alter orders to your liking, and it's needless to say the food is DELICIOUS !!! Defiantly my favorite bagel store with out hesitation and I hope more people give it the reviews it deserves because it's amazing!!
2017-02-25,5,The staff is super friendly. I love the energy in here. They also have Gluten Free bread.  Can't go wrong here.  A tad expensive because Hot Bagel is 1/2 block down and they are 1/3 the price. I think O'bagel could put more meat on the sandwiches for the money.
2017-02-19,5,Just yes. Get after this place when your craving a good breakfast sandwich. Hit the spot on a Sunday morning. The line can be long but it's worth the wait
2017-02-05,3,Best bagel in Hoboken. Service is always super nice but so incredibly slow. Got 1 bagel with cream cheese this morning and after they forgot about it and I had to remind them, they gave me the wrong thing. Super frustrating.
2017-01-17,2,I used to go here, seeing as I live a few doors away it became pretty convenient when it opened last year.  Until it wasn't. $12 for a bagel and smoked salmon?  I understand Manhattan is within view, but you can't charge those prices with a Hoboken address, sorry. Such a perfectly done whole wheat bagel, unfortunately my sandwiches were wrong almost every single time I went. They also literally use ONE egg per sandwich, which is laughable. Option B is I walk a block the other way to Bagels on the Hudson.  But trust me you don't wanna do that either.  I basically stopped eating bagels at this point.  Thanx Hoboken.
2016-12-30,5,Best bagel in Hoboken. Service is always friendly (it's a tight amount of space, but it's a bagel shop so what would you expect). I get an everything w meat&cheese&hashbrown, so good. Highly recommend for bagel lovers, the short wait will be worth it!
2016-12-28,3,The bagels here are probably the best in Hoboken. However they get really busy at peak times on weekends which can cause some issues when ordering during those times. The ridge Diablo is a must.
2016-12-27,2,The bagels at this place and sandwiches are amazing that's where 2 stars come from. The staff is beyond incompetent and the owner shows no control over his employees. If he had control they would have a better run establishment. I had the pleasure of standing at the register for 10 minutes watching the employees goof around and chat while I wanted to place an order. And not surprising my order was WRONG AGAIN! This is expected from this place. They have quality but not in their people. I don't know why the owner can't get his staff together but after discussing with people in town the consensus is about the same. There are other places to go that get my order correct.
2016-12-14,4,Just like other reviews said, the bagel is decent but the service is so so. I ordered a lox n loaded on black Russian  bagel. It tastes very fresh and the bagel has a great chewing texture.
2016-12-09,4,Ordering on the phone is a little difficult , however the bagels and food are top notch, on Sunday's it's packed! So try to order your food quickly. I love their egg and cheese on a bagel, they cook it to perfection , great for when you have a mean hang over
2016-12-09,4,This place has the best coffee on Washington and the staff are just delight full. If your not sure what you want just ask them what they recommend they haven't failed me yet. My favorite employee is the one with the white hair and glasses (sorry im bad with names hahaha) I walk in and she already knows how I like my coffee. She also has a great and cheerful personality. I don't function right in the morning without my coffee so thank you O Bagel for helping me get through my day!
2016-11-26,3,First few times the everything bagels were great. I went out of my way from Nutley NJ to get them and there was zero seasoning on the everything bagel. Very disappointed.
2016-11-11,1,This is now my second order where they have messed it up. I ordered on Seamless and still managed to have the order incorrect.  First time they gave me tuna salad on a bagel when I asked for the salad and completely left out my bagel with cream cheese. Just now I placed an order and got a call saying they only had three kinds of bagels left..  when my order came the Snapple was warm, they put the dressing in my salad when I said on the side, and they forgot the ketchup packets I requested on the side. If you ever order, I suggest calling and have them say the order back to you.
2016-11-06,1,This place is awful. I tried calling 15 times to place an order for pickup. When I finally received my food there was a fingernail in my river walk sandwich. I highly advise against taking half your morning to eat fingernails. You're welcome
2016-11-06,4,I know this place just opened but they definitely have some kinks to work out and being new is no excuse. The layout for one is not good, causes a very large crowd to build up, no waiting area, no seating area. No flow to it at all. They used all of the space for the server area and none for patrons.  They did not have half the items on there menu and were sold out of most bagels.  How are you not prepared and sell out of bagels? Also, no display at all, hard to even find the menu.  I had the lox sandwich on a Black Russian bagel which I do have to say was actually very good.  If the quality of food was not good this place would be a 1 star.  IF they figure out the kinks if the next few months I will return, otherwise I don't see them lasting due to the poor layout. Time for an update - best bagel place in Hoboken. Freshest bagels. Can't comment on delivery.   Still very hectic layout and place gets packed with Stevens students but 100% worth the craziness as there are by any bagels that compare to this place.
2016-10-31,5,Staff was friendly and answered any questions we have. Bagels were huge and stuffed to the max and tasted great :)
2016-10-30,1,If they had an option for no stars I would choose this.  Made an order from the company and it took over 2 1/2 hours to get our food.  They lost a customer, don't care if the bagels a decent- this experience sucked and the kids that work there just don't care about their customers
2016-10-28,2,Meh. Decent bagels but nothing to write home about. Super expensive.  I was excited to see they had kombucha on tap, but I wasn't expecting it to be served over ice. Definitely don't feel like I got $4.75 worth of kombucha, considering most of the volume was ice. $10 total for a bacon egg & cheese, plus an iced (?!) kombucha. Plus a lengthy wait in a crowded space full of hipsters. When I did finally get my sandwich it was practically thrown at me. I won't be back unless other places are closed.
2016-10-27,1,Too busy, bagel is fluffy. The taste is not worth for long waiting. I would like to go hot bagel.
2016-10-23,5,Best bagels in the area, Definitely worth the wait! I got the chicken salad last time and thoroughly enjoyed it as well. My new go to spot
2016-10-16,2,40 minute wait for a subpar bacon egg and cheese with hash. Forgot the hash & theres probably about 10 everything's on the bagel. Huge disappointment. O'Bagel... more like no bagel
2016-10-07,4,Yum yum yum!!!! Boston never has any salt bagels so I grab as many as I can whenever I'm visiting my sister in law in Hoboken and Manhattan. Delicious and satisfying as always. My hubby had an egg & cheese on an onion bagel. It was really good. His coffee was caramel flavored. He didn't love it, hence the docked point. Otherwise this was an amazing little shop! Definitely recommend it.
2016-09-30,4,Excellent. Soft. Hand rolled bagels. I thought initially when I saw this place going up, "Does Hoboken really need another bagel place?" It turns out, this one is pretty good. They have some really interesting cream cheeses (the Tuscany is quite good) and some amazing sandwiches (Sweet Tooth has Almond butter, pomegranate jam on a French toast bagel). They have some really good coffee and Kombucha on tap. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is Service is not always the strongest. I arrived to an employee on his phone and they screwed up my order a bit. Not a deal breaker but this could easily be the best bagel joint in Hoboken if they just took a bit more care.
2016-09-28,4,Like many, I have to take 1 star away because of overall wait time this place can get EXTREMELY BUSY on the weekends. I have walked right past it due to lines being out the door. That being said, the bagels are so good that the line goes out the door! From the hot sandwiches, to the specialty cream cheese, to the fresh bagels coming out of the back on what seems like an every 10 minute rotation, this place is my absolute favorite bagel spot.
2016-09-27,1,It's unfortunate how terrible the customer service is here because the bagels are decent. Recently had a delivery order of a half dozen bagels that showed up completely wrong. When I called the restaurant, I could barely hear the person on the phone due to background noise, and they couldn't hear me either. This person didn't know what to do with my issue so they gave me to the manager.The manager reviewed my order and then told me that the reason I didn't get the bagel flavors I wanted was that they were out so they just subbed in other ones. And they did this without calling first. I told her that this is an unfortunate problem because now I have a bunch of bagels that won't be eaten, and family who don't have bagels they like to eat! And what did she say to that? Nothing. Silence.So let's recap here. I order a product from you. You're out of the product I want, so you give me something different without consulting me, just assuming I'll want that. And when I tell you that's not what I wanted, you don't offer any sort of consolation? That's not how you do business. They should have offered me the ability to change or cancel my order before they delivered it.Oh, and my other gripe about this place? They charge $3.75 for a TINY container of scallion cream cheese! Look at my picture - metro card for scale. It's the size of one of those little cups you're supposed to put ketchup in at a fast food place! This is barely enough cream cheese for 2 bagels!Thank god for Seamless, because when I called them, they got me a refund.
2016-09-27,4,Let's get something straight, when you are seeking reviews for a bagel shop, the only thing that really matters is the quality of the bagel, and rightfully so. That being said, I have been to 5 different bagel shops in the tiny square mile they call Hoboken, and O'Bagel definitely takes the cake! Most people do not call Hoboken their hometown, so the majority of us can and will say that their hometown bagel shop reigns supreme, and for some of you that may very well be O'bagel. I can honestly say that this place has some very quality bagels that will give your hometown bagel shop a run for its money...Minus one star for the long wait, as I have spent close to 45 minutes waiting for a bagel on a busy weekend morning. I suppose you are paying the price for quality, but at least there is room for improvement.
2016-09-12,1,Hoboken's"to-go breakfast sandwich" spots on Washington St are slim so we were really excited for these guys.  However, I've gone here about a dozen times & EVERY time, they've messed up my order.  On top of terrible service and Bagels that are hard as rocks! Even at lunch time when there's no one in there they manage to mess up an order.   Never going back
2016-09-07,4,i've grown up with O'Bagel bagels and was ecstatic when I heard they were opening in Hoboken. The bagels are consistently delicious - I would go as far as to say the best bagels I've ever had. They are large and always fresh, but it's important to note that with a large bagel, you're going to get more breadiness....that's kind of how it works. If you're not a fan of bready bagels, then you probably would prefer another place, honestly. If you like fresh bagels, a variety of options (from standard bagel with cream cheese to your choice of bagel sandwiches) then this is your spot.My reason for dropping down to 4 stars instead of 5 is unfortunately the service. When the owner is not there, it is slow and leaves a lot to be desired. Trust me, I don't mind the wait because of how much I love these bagels, but it's a little excessive. I waited 20 min, as the only person to have ordered, for 2 bagels with cream cheese. This isn't the norm - I've gone in and out in 5 min before, but I don't think it can be ignored. To end on a positive note, bagels = awesome, cold brew = to die for (and on tap...). You definitely will not be disappointed or hungry after eating an O'Bagel bagel.
2016-09-04,4,So I have always gone to hoboken bagel since that was my favorite spot but if I am in the mood for some bagels with options I come here, i must say the bagels (a bit on the bready side) is not as good as Hoboken Hot Bagels (more chewy) or JP bagels (more dense), but they do have a lot of options in making creating your own or trying their speciality sandwiches I would avoid the morning rush because the wait is quite long I go during off hours which is must easier, if you get a drink and a speciality bagel it should run you around $12 give or take and they do offer gluten free which is great. Oh they do offer kumbucha tea as one of their drinks which is hard to find in fast food joints.
2016-08-31,3,Gosh O'bagel, you leave a gal conflicted as to how to rate you. I am stuck between 3 and 4 stars, which is the inevitable flaw to yelp, the lack of the 0.5 option. I guess its good because it makes us decide. Though you provide me with a delicious Jersey bagel, your pricing, service, and store set up results in the loss of 2 stars. Taste: Let's start with the best part. Yes, they have the best bagel in town, in the state, and perhaps the universe. There I said it. I know its a bold statement, but its the perfect combination of crispy on the outside and soft but with some weight on the inside. Great variation of flavors of bagels, cream cheeses, and sandwich options, and fresh as can be. Service: Here is where life takes a nose dive for me. They are very slow, as in prepare to spend 30 mins there just to get a bagel. If you have no where else to be, then by all means, wait it out. They also have a rough time taking orders. A few times when I have been there I have had to repeat myself to the cashier, even when I am just ordering for one person. Want to order for a few people, I wish you luck. Then, there is the inevitable, "we forgot to give you something" in your order situation. Last time I was in there, I was one of 3 customers, I ordered a bagel and a coffee, and they forgot the coffee. There were 5 people working behind the counter. I am still scratching my head over that one. Several of the employees look like this is the last place they want to be, but some are very happy to give you that bagel. Wish they were all on the same page of happiness that I am in waiting for my bagel. Store set up: they really need to do something about traffic flow. Where you wait for your bagels to be done and the end of the line is all mashed together so no one knows whats going on. Its tough to see the menu and what kind of bagels they have until you are about on top of the register, so there is no prep time to make decisions. The coffee is hidden, so you have to know about it and know to order it before you get to the register. I understand that they have to work with the existing structure when they went in there, but I have to believe there is a better way. Oh, and if you want a larger take home side of cream cheese, yes they have that, way beyond the line, if its stocked. You really have to know its there to shop from there. Price: Bagel sandwich and a coffee will cost you almost $12. Yeah, I am not kidding. Its the priciest bagel place in town, even for city prices. So basically its a place to get great bagels, experience long waits in long lines, empty your pockets, and only for the regular if you want to be successful. I will still keep coming back, because, wow, those bagels are awesome.
2016-08-31,5,5 stars for this amazing establishment. Best bagels and sandwiches around. Their coffee is really good too. Staff is friendly, place is clean, and there is a good amount of outdoor seating. Highly recommend. They also just added gluten free options to their menu!!!
2016-08-23,4,It's a nice place to go if u want a bagel sandwich. I got the Stevens ducks bagel and really enjoyed it. I would go back there. It seems to get crowded quickly but the line moves pretty fast.
2016-08-21,5,This was the best breakfast bagel sandwich I have ever had, hands down. I got the whole wheat everything with egg and cheese and it was delicious! I was a bit skeptical Bc of some of the previous reviews but I have a feeling it was just newly opened business kinks they needed to sort through. Can't wait to try the lunch sandwiches! Highly recommend O'Bagel!
2016-08-19,2,I have attempted about 5 times to order "The French Canadian" bagel sandwich since the first time my friend got it and it was amazing. Every single time I've ordered it, I have never gotten the sandwich as it's described on the menu - French toast bagel, maple cream cheese, bacon. One time I didn't get the bacon, one time I didn't get the French toast bagel, one time I didn't get the maple cream cheese, and the last two times I got egg and regular cream cheese. Not even close. I should just stop trying! This place could be great but these employees REALLY need to work on their attention to detail or O'Bagel is going to lose those who would be loyal customers.
2016-08-18,2,Although their bagels and egg sandwiches taste good, I can not look over the fact of how skimpy and forgetful their staff is.  After ordering a $5 Bacon, Egg & Cheese ( salt, pepper, Ketchup) I got back to my desk and sure enough - no salt pepper ketchup.  Not the biggest deal in the world but for $5 I expected my sandwich to have more than what seemed to be a half of an egg on it.  I would like to say I would give this place another shot expect I have said this the last 2 times ordering from them.  It always seems to be something, forgetting sides during lunch orders, overcooking chicken cutlets etc. Aside from bagels, hoboken has much better options across the board.
2016-08-07,5,With all of the mixed reviews I came in on a Sunday morning around 10am not knowing what to expect. I saw a long line and the tables full, always a good sign for any restaurant! To my surprise the line was moving along very fast. I ordered the loaded lox on a black Russian bagel. I am not sure why people are complaining about the prices, seems to be in line with every other bagel and sandwich shop I have been to.I took by bagel and OJ a few blocks down to the waterfront, took a bite and  OMG was it good! I tried lox bagels all over NYC and NJ and this spot was the best I had. The salmon was fresh and bagel was fresh and soft. The staff was very friendly also, I asked the girl at the register what was in the "loaded lox" and she took the time to explain to me and showed me it on the menu LCD that they have up by the registers. This is definitely my new bagel spot. My only regret is not taking a picture of the bagel before eating it to post it here. But now I have an excuse to go back next Sunday :)
2016-08-06,1,Took over an hour and a half for delivery. When it finally came, my order was incomplete, and the bagel wasn't even fresh! Never again.
2016-07-29,2,Whatever you do, dont order the FRENCH CANADIAN. For some reason, they made it wrong 4 out of the 5 times my gfs ordered it. Its on your menu. Why is it so hard to make? Another thing, if you run out of lox spread at 930am....make some more.
2016-07-21,2,So after a night on the town, my GF and I wake up O'Hungover so we figured we would give O'Bagel a whirl. I ordered a sausage egg and cheese on a sesame bagel. The GF ordered some turkey healthy fitfam scooped bagel sandwich. Anyways after 30 minutes of standing in the blistering heat of this place other people started getting their orders to cure their hangovers as we stood unable to cure.  It took a few times to nudge them on the status of our order. I started overheating and the employees could most likely see my frustration in my eyes. After approx. 45 minutes they said they were just waiting on my sausage egg and cheese. It finally comes after I watched sportscenter two times through. Luckily my GF was able to calm my vulnerable soul on our 3 block walk back to my apartment.Upon entering the bag of food, my GF shrieked with anger as she yells that our order is not accurate and her healthy sandwich referred to above was not present, and that two sausage egg and cheeses were in the presence of our hungover bodies. We called and stated our issue and O'Bagel said they would make us what we were missing with a full refund.We trekked back through the heat of Hoboken to collect our now updated and hopefully accurate perishables to now cure our pain from Tally Ho the night prior. O'Bagel concocted our order and fully refunded the entirety of the order including the large cold brew ice coffee with a splash of 2% I guzzled down in the first 3 minutes as well as a Pinepple orange juice.Anywho, the bagel was OKAY. For the price of a sandwich you don't get as much bang for your buck at other Hoboken bagel places such as JP's Bagel which offers bagels that cure the hangover at hand as well as your next one in the future. Should be named NO'Bagel.
2016-07-20,4,Newly opened in Hoboken a few months ago. Stopped in before heading to beach on Sunday. Place was a madhouse, very busy and very warm. Bagel sandwich was served in a reasonable time period. Taylor ham egg cheese on whole wheat everything bagel. Loaded with Taylor ham, thinly sliced Boars Head. Really good sandwich, nicely constructed. I'll be back. Also they have cold brewed coffee on tap which was fantastic!
2016-07-17,2,Tried to get a bagel today from O'Bagel and was turned off for a few reasons:- I was the only person in line and none of the four people behind the counter offered to take my order or ask if I was ready to order (I stood there for about 5 minutes and walked out)- The menu is bizarre. I couldn't find a standard pork roll, egg & cheese bagel on a sign anywhere in the place, but Tuna & Sriracha, and other weird concoctions were readily available.- The bagels looked small, like Thomas's bagels sized small.- The radio in the place was as loud as a Saturday night at the Shannon. This leads me to believe "when the big boss is away, the immature staff will play (the music as loud as they can).While I love JP's and Bagels on the Hudson, I'd even recommend going to Hoboken Hot Bagels as it's pretty much on the same block as this place. Not gonna try and return.
2016-07-14,3,Bagels are decent. I tried the French Toast bagel with cream cheese...not bad but not great either. I got a cold brew as well, which was ok too. It was a bit pricey for me. $8+ for a bagel and drink is a bit above my pay grade.
2016-07-12,4,Yes the bagels are delicious!  As other reviewer's had stated; the employees are a bit sluggish. It probably doesn't help that it was stifling heat wise inside. I placed my order for an everything bagel with lox cream cheese spread and a marble rye bagel with butter to go.  The young order taker asked me if I wanted it with the scallions. The perplexed look on my face prompted her to ask one of her associates do we have lox Cream cheese spread?  Her coworker and I both assured her there was a huge bowl of lox cream cheese spread in the refrigerator case.   Perhaps management should educate the employees on the menu. There were 3 people ahead of me & I had my order in about 10 minutes.The lox cream cheese was very tasty, fresh & not salty.  The bagels have a perfect chewy texture. I would consider coming back should I have business in the area again. You locals have great food choices!
2016-06-30,4,A standard, nommy bagel spot. If you get there in the late morning they may be out of your favorite combination. Line moves quickly, and seating is mainly out front. Yum!
2016-06-29,1,$6 for 1/4 an egg in my ham (2 slices), egg and (1 slice of) cheese sandwich. Pathetic. Shame on you. Giving you 1 star is being kind.
2016-06-28,5,One of the best bagels I'vee ever had. If you're like me and enjoy an authentic jersey bagel, this is definitely the perfect spot! The bagels are always fresh, the service is excellent, and it's me & my friends favorite spot to grab a quick bite to eat. I'm not a morning person either, so O'bagel's bacon egg and cheese on an everything bagel definitely gets me out of bed early. 5 stars all around
2016-06-27,1,Overpriced trash that takes forever.  Whoever owns this place needs to make an unannounced visit and come check it out.  Literally the most piss poor operation in Hoboken at the moment.  Been here twice and it's been the same experience both times.  Reading other reviews it seems like that's just how it is here.  Staff is nice but completely incompetent.  Came here around 10 AM on a Monday Morning, already late for work, looking for a quick bite to eat.  There are 5 people behind the counter but it still took me literally 20 minutes to get a bacon egg and cheese and an iced coffee.  There wasn't a line or anything, but there were about 6-7 people all standing around waiting for their food while one of the staff is apparently on break eating his bagel in the cafe in front of everyone who is still waiting.  I get it dude, it's your break time, but maybe walk around the corner or eat in the back instead of chowing down in front of pissed off hungry customers.  Guy running the grill is taking his sweet ass time, totally clueless, asking his co workers which bagel was for who and what did they order over and over again as the tickets keep coming.  It took me 10 minutes to get an iced coffee...Management is totally clueless- manager is telling his guy to go refill the shelf with cokes at 10am on a Monday instead of help make bagels, fix the iced coffee machine, anything else to get rid of the line of people waiting for food.  Although might not have been the worst decision considering he already has 5 people working behind the counter and 3 of them are just standing around waiting to be told what to do.Might be worth it if the bagels were good, but they are pretty terrible.  Bagels are not chewy at all, overcooked, literally no taste...poorly cooked breakfast sandwich.  Remember we're in the bagel capital of the world...this shit wouldn't even be good in Alabama. Go literally anywhere else.  Here's a list- The place across from CVS/Starbucks is good (JP's Bagel Express?), Hoboken Hot Bagels on Washington between 6th-7th makes absolutely delicious bagels (but their breakfast sandwich isn't great).  Bagels on the Hudson is meh, but they are very quick and food is much better than here.Hey, this place looks nice though, and pretty good iced coffee even though it took 10 minutes to get it.This place is GARBAGE, not worth even half of the time it takes to eat here.  Also they don't have hot sauce (what the fuck???)
2016-06-27,5,Best new bagel spot in Hoboken! Love the staff, quick service on weekday afternoons and the egg sandwiches and "draft-style" iced coffee are to die for! I've been here three times in the past week. Can't get enough :)
2016-06-26,4,Bagels are good, sandwiches are awesome (bacon is real bacon, avocado fresh and mashed up) and coffee delicious.  Oh and they actually TOAST bagels unlike its competitor, ahem, Hoboken Hot Bagels, cough.  Indeed this place is a zoo if you go past 9AM on a weekend, so beware, but the line wouldn't be long if it sucked.  We simply avoid at peak times. No idea why there's so many bad reviews, but likely just loyalists to poorer bagel spots or those who came during very busy times.
2016-06-22,2,Gave this place a couple tries both during the busy weekend and during a weekday morning. Weekend Experience: I expected lines on the weekend (which were out the door) and to be a little slow in getting a bagel sandwich similar to the other Hoboken bagel shops. I got in an ordered within 10 minutes (not bad) but then it took another hour for my order to come out. I ordered 2 very simple bagel sandwiches and had the girl taking my order repeat it to me. When my order came out, I only got 1 sandwich even though I know I paid for 2. I questioned the owner/manager as to when the other sandwich was coming out and he told me his ticket for my order only said 1. Unfortunately they did not give me a receipt when I paid so I could not show him I ordered 2. The right thing to do in this situation would be to quickly make another sandwich and I'd be on my way. Instead, this owner/manager told me I'd have to go back to the register and order/pay for another sandwich, which would then put me in the back of the line of tickets that are backed up at the grill. He did offer to let me skip the line to order and pay. Instead I chose not to wait another hour and ate the cost of the other.Weekday Experience: Going in on a weekday morning, I expected to have a quick and pleasant experience. This was anything but. Of the 4 people in the place when I got there, I am pretty sure they did not get one order correct. My order, was a taylor ham and cheese on a scooped everything bagel and a veggie cream cheese on a scooped everything bagel. It took just over 24 minutes to get this order. When I got it, I was given a taylor ham, EGG, and cheese on an everything bagel and veggie cc on a WHEAT bagel. After explaining to the owner/manager what we ordered vs what we got, he was unapologetic and did not seem to understand why we did not want what he gave us, which was not what we ordered. Also, they do not have hot sauce, weird. Takeaways - you must pay before your order even reaches the person making it which slows down service when they are busy. The workers seem fit to handle ONLY one sandwich at a time which will not work in Hoboken. I'd love to understand why they can not seem to get an order correct. Maybe they should consider a new flow to the ordering process. They do not have hot sauce, only chipotle aioli. Owner/manager seems clueless on both customer service and how to run a quick breakfast shop.  It is almost like they give you what they feel like making and do not even read the tickets from their fancy POS system. 2 stars because once you get the bagels they are pretty good. Good place to go and get bagels by the dozen. Stay away from the breakfast sandwiches unless you want to spend your morning waiting and then getting the wrong meal. I wonder how many people are late to work because of the slow timing and because they already paid for their breakfast.
2016-06-19,2,I understand that Sunday morning is a busy time for a bagel place, and the bagels themselves are worth the wait/crowd and the employees were adequately friendly, which is the only reason this is getting more than one star. We got an entirely different order than for what we asked/paid. We ordered (we got):1 - Double egg, taylor ham, colby jack (american) on black russian bagel with hot sauce (no hot sauce), side hash brown2 - Egg, bacon, american cheese (colby jack) on onion (plain) bagel with ketchup, salt, pepper (no condiments), side hash brown (no hash brown)3 - Double egg (egg whites), bacon (no bacon), american cheese on whole wheat everything with ketchup, salt, pepper (no condiments)4 - 3 eggs (egg whites), bacon, colby jack (american) on whole wheat everything with hot sauce, pepper (no condiments)So, basically, if you're cool with an order of "Surprise me!" then it's all good. If you actually want what you're going to ask and pay for, then it's not all that good....
2016-06-15,2,Meh, really 1.5.The bagels themselves are very good, but don't waste your time waiting in line for a bagel sandwich. On a Saturday morning, the staff was overwhelmed and hastily put together the orders, which resulted in a few mistakes. There are obviously worse things than in life than a meh bagel sandwich, but in light of the stressful ordering situation, long wait, and a skimpy final product, I don't recommend.  JP's is much much better.Also  - no hot sauce here!!!! o'Bagel Hoboken ain't got no funk.
2016-06-09,5,Hoboken has a lot of options for bagels, and this is by far my favorite! I usually hit up bagels on the Hudson down the street, but last time I went they gave me a hard time about using a card for payment. So I decided to venture out and try this place. Love their menu and the bagels are dense and fresh. There is also space to sit inside and the workers all seemed like they were having a fun time. Also no credit card minimum!
2016-06-08,5,The location is perfect and the bagels are delicious. The egg bagels are divine. Seamless experience and great customer service. I will be back for more!
2016-06-05,2,Bagels are good but I'm feeling deceived. There are these video displays showing some of the bagel sandwiches. I saw the "Watchung Warrior" and it looked like this massive hearty sandwich with pastrami and eggs. I mean MASSIVE looking! When I got my sandwich, it was a complete joke. Considering this sandwich is just shy of $7, I'm feeling ripped off.
2016-06-02,1,This is my 3rd disappointing time here.  The staff is unbearably slow,  it has taken 20 plus minutes to get a sandwich each time I have been there. There has never been more than 2 people in line ahead of me. The first time the sandwich I got was very greasy.  The second time my order was made incorrectly, twice.  Today my sandwich was cold off the grill, and made incorrectly.  I ordered an egg and Avocado. There was hardly any Avocado on the sandwich  and the cook put bacon on it. I just have had enough, I got my money back and left never to return. As I was waiting to get my sandwich I noticed 2 of 4 orders before me go back to the cook for some sort of problem.  The bagels are good but the guy on the grill is going to sink your business.
2016-05-30,4,I was impressed by O'Bagel (not impressed by many bagel places in Hoboken). The THEC was very good. They use thick slices of taylor ham and layer it in with the egg and cheese. I'll definitely be going back to try one of their lunch sandwiches.
2016-05-28,3,Ok so their bagels are as good as any I've tried, with lots of options that set them apart from other locations in Hoboken.  That being said, the lines and wait time to get your order just don't seem necessary.  I mean it's a bagel!  It shouldn't take so long to get your food.    Just easier to walk to Hoboken Bagels down the block.
2016-05-21,1,20 minutes in line, then another 20 minutes just for a simple everything bagel with cream cheese. Then got told they ran out of everything after I waited for 20 minutes. When I finally did get the bagel, there was hardly any seasoning on it so calling it everything is pretty laughable.I get it's a Saturday and things are busy, but not worth the wait or the attitude from the employees. Walk half a block up Washington to Hoboken Hot Bagels for a much better experience.
2016-05-14,1,I'm sure the bagel will be just fine, as most bagels in the NY Metro area are...that is, if I ever get my order. My experience has me waiting 20+ minutes already for a simple bagel order (and it's not prime breakfast or lunch time). This is my first time trying O'Bagel, and, unfortunately, will be my last...as there are plenty of other options available in Hoboken that don't have you wasting so much time waiting.
2016-05-09,3,Good food good prices great bagels freshly made wonderful selection I dislike that no one picks up when I'm trying to call in and order and that they don't carry breads like their menu suggests the staff is nice
2016-05-06,1,I've been here at least 5 times and without fail they mess my order up. It's a new business in hoboken so I've been giving them the benefit of the doubt but if I'm going to spend 5$ on a breakfast sandwich then their needs to at least be an attempt to make it correctly. If I say no ketchup, that doesn't mean load it up. If I remind you no ketchup that doesn't mean you just swith out the top of the bagel, the sandwich is still going to taste like ketchup. Or maybe just take all of the bacon/sausage/taylor ham off, you've only done that twice. Make the bagel correctly, there are only what 10 bagel places within a square mile. Also the set-up is horrific. The cash register should be where you walk in, not in the far back of the store.
2016-05-03,4,Food is really good! They make good bacon and they get your order correct which is a big deal since so many other places do not. Downside is that the service is WAY too slow, need to have a better system. Wouldn't go here if you are in a rush.
2016-05-01,5,Love at first bite! Just what a bagel should be crispy on the outside & light but chewy on the inside.  It's great to see the product being made right there! I went basic, an "everything with veggie cream cheese" but next time I am going to try one of their special sandwiches. I will be back & often. Great job guys! Keep it up.
2016-04-30,3,Came early on a Saturday morning (around 9am) and there was already a line out the door.  It would have been nice if there were menus close by so I could check it out before ordering.  They seem to be better known for their types of sandwiches, and only had a few types of cream cheese.  I also would have liked to see whitefish (maybe I am missing something?). I also would have liked to see flat bagels (I mean I love carbs too as it says on their shirts but it would have been a nice offering).  The bagel size seems to be the same as any other place, and the everything bagel could have more seeds on it.  The bagel itself did taste good.  It was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  The veggie cream cheese should be called pepper because it contains red, green and yellow peppers.  No scallions in it, no radishes in it, no carrots.  It was a bit confusing on where to look to pick up my bagel once it was ready (cold bagel orders towards the front, hot and cooked towards the entrance/back).   I think I'd like one of their sandwiches better, they seem to be different and appetizing.
2016-04-30,1,Sorry guys, I originally gave you 4 stars, but you've now been open for a month and your line is still out the door in the morning. Adjusting to 1. You need to get your operations in order. The wait is ridiculous for a bacon, egg, and cheese. A shame since you have one of the best bagels in town.
2016-04-29,4,Amazing bagels- thank god they opened in hoboken!  I agree with others comments- it does get crazy busy on a weekend morning, as to be expected, but the line is out the door. I know they just opened but it would be great to have a line just for coffee and plain bagels- it takes a while to get to the front when people are ordering breakfast sandwiches.   Obsessed with the french toast bagel I'm sure it has a million calories but thats ok once in awhile lol!
2016-04-28,5,Great spot.   Some of the best bagels I've ever had and definitely the best in Hoboken.  Their whipped cream cheese is awesome and really compliments their bagels.  Sandwiches are always on-point, breakfast or lunch. Service is usually very fast and always friendly. Coffee selection is good.   Customer for life.
2016-04-25,5,I love this place but im posting more of a suggestion than a review because the bagels are fantastic and i think enough people have mentioned that already anyway.I  was born and raised and currently still live in NYC, AKA the bagel capitol of the world so i think anyone reading this can assume i know bagels.O bagels bakes the best iv ever eaten and im very happy to have found this place...unfortunately,  because of the outrageous rents now in both brooklyn and manhattan, bagels places are becoming rarer and rarer and the local bagel shop is almost extinct here in manhattan.Iv noticed online  that o bagels, before opening in hoboken had two other jersey locations and this new location in hoboken will be their third and if im not mistaken, their most urban and densely populated city and that is where my suggestion is based.It seems that their business plan and experience is based on the previous locations that i do not believe got even 25 percent the traffic the new hoboken location  generates and because of that, it seems tbey are currently ill equipped to handle the traffic.Since opening , the  first time we ate there, my girlfriend went to pick up our breakfast (she recently relocated to hoboken from here in nyc) and she waited on line for an hour!!!  A week later i went to get our breakfaat, this time much later hoping to avoid the long wait but to no avail, i too waited nearly  an hour for two bagels and coffee...the third weekend, despite o bagles being our first choice, we decided the hour wait just wasnt worth it and went to hoboken bagels instead.Heres my suggestion,  get a clue guys!!!you are no longer in the sticks of jersey,  you are in a major city with a very dense population and you need to both structure your customer flow and train your staff accordingly because no matter how good you think you are doing, you are losing a TON of business..the few times i decided to wait on line i literally watched half your potential customers walk away..What busy nyc bagel shops do is have two lines, the first line is simply to place your order, you then go on a second line and while you are waiting to pay, your food is getting prepared and it's ready when its your turn to pay...you will serve twice as many people this way and your customers will not waste half their morning trying to buy a bagel. ..this is my suggestion...also you need to have either more or faster employees preparing the bagels because i watched how long it took for a bagel and creemcheese to be ready after a customer paid and it was way way way too long...your employees need to move their buts a lot faster and act a little more energized and alive   because they all seemed like they were stoned....no matter how good your bagels are ( and they are fantastic) no bagel is worth wasting your entire weekend morning for....maybe your customers are willing to do this to try a new place but very quickly i grew tired of waiting and went elsewhere  and im certain many others will do the same..  Congrats on the new location and great work producing a great product that people seem to love, if you sort out your service problem you will have a home run! !!!
2016-04-22,3,I was very pleased to see O' Bagel open in Hoboken. I've enjoyed the bagels at the Sterling NJ location for a number of years. The bagels are fresh, crispy, and if you are lucky a little crunchy on the outside. Unfortunately the staff is slow, disengaged, and disorganized. As another yelper noted the ordering system also seems very inefficient. I witnessed people walking out when there weren't even many customers in the place. Take a look at the staff in Sterling NJ to see a well oiled machine and a happy one too! If the bagels weren't so darn good this place would get one star from me.
2016-04-11,4,It's about time a decent bagel shop opened in Hoboken. The bagels are more airy than a traditional NY-style bagel but the chewy crust more than makes up for it. Bonus star for a HOT bagel at 11am on a Monday. I only grabbed a bagel to go but some of the sandwiches looked pretty amazing (corned beef, egg and cheese with Russian, I'm talking about you!). They could tweak a few things-- an 'Order Here' sign hung from the ceiling,  a few outside tables and making sure to stuff napkins in the bag-- but this will be my new go-to spot when I'm craving a bagel.
2016-04-09,5,My boyfriend and I visit this location every weekend.  The line is usually out the door so we try to get there by 7a latest.  They have the best everything bagel I've ever tasted.  I always get a sausage, egg, and cheddar on an everything bagel.  It's too good to stray away and try new items on the menu. However, I want to note that this morning (4/9), the sausage in my order left a strange taste and it was also bony.  Did you change the brand of your sausage?
2016-04-09,4,I love there hashbrowns taylor ham and pepperjack cheese sandwiches on cheddar bagel or 6grain wheat bread- For $6.75. Not too bad. THE BAD- i can say they are pretty cheap with their cream cheeses. They put VERY little, i was only able to eat the side they put the cream cheese on.
2016-04-06,5,I had given up ordering breakfast in Hoboken after four years of less than mediocrity.  I had stopped eating bagels all together.  That was until O'Bagel Moved to Hoboken.  Finally - there is a good - no great - bagel place in Hoboken.  I feel like the wait was almost worth it.  They are simply the best bagels that I've ever had.  The spread is great too.  It's a very cool setup.  All of the other places look dingy compared to O'Bagel.  Oh and the coffee - it's fantastic.  You have to try the cold brews. The coffee at the other places is an afterthought. Not at O'Bagel.  You won't be making a separate trip to Starbucks like you have to do when you order from the others.  In fact, when you are cutting carbs for the summer and you can't order a bagel, you will stil go to O'Bagel for an egg white omelette and a cold brew.  At least, that's what I did.
2016-04-02,4,In my opinion, one of the best bagels in Hoboken, and most importantly a very good service, something really hard to find in Hoboken these days, especially at bagel places (aka Bagels on the Hudson). The only thing that avoided me to rate 5 stars was the "logistics" and the time I spent to had a bagel! Ok, it's good, but I'm sorry having to wait over an hour for a bagel is a little too much time to waste of my weekend mornings!
2016-04-01,2,Nice space inside, but the bagels are too bready and not chewy, like they were baked but not boiled like a bagel should be. Maybe it's better for a sandwich, but for breakfast it was really disappointing. We threw the remaining bagel out actually. Also, I like a lot of seeds and onion and salt on an everything bagel, these barely had anything on the outside.
2016-03-31,5,The staff is extremely friendly and super helpful. I ordered the Boken and it was banging!!!!Amazing!! Love this place and it was my 1st there, Will for sure be going back again.
2016-03-27,3,I'm kinda torn here between 3 and 4 stars. The good? Bagels are rolled by hand here, and you can watch the guy cutting the dough and rolling bagels by hand behind the counter. Bagels themselves have a nice crunch crust, with a soft chewy inside. Pretty tasty. The bad? The bagels have no stuff in them. Both the sesame and everything bagels barely had anything in them. The sesame could have passed for a plain. The other thing is serving of tuna on the bagel felt pretty stingy compared to other places in Hoboken. Place feels a bit pricy coming to $12 for a bagel with cream cheese, and another bagel with tuna. Will I come back? Yeah I'll give it another go, but I think I still prefer JP Bagels.
2016-03-25,1,Ok, I'm sorry but O'Bagel's bagels are terrible. I am speaking as a bagel purist. Bagels should not be toasted. Bagels should not be used for sandwiches. Bagel + cream cheese. That's it. And when I go to a bagel shop, I don't care how good their coffee is, if they offer seating, if they have other items on their menu, etc. I go to a bagel shop to get a bagel.Bagels should be a little dense and chewy. OBagel's bagels are too bready and don't even look like bagels! Also the first time I went to OBagel, they didn't let the bagels cool out of the oven so when they put the cream cheese on, it immediately got all gooey and nasty. No, no, no.I gave them another shot and this time, I wanted to do a side by side comparison of OBagel and Hoboken Hot Bagel. First, the bagel from Hoboken Hot Bagel actually looks like a bagel and feels like a bagel. Use your finger and push into the bagel to test the density -- the bagel from OBagel gives too easily.Texture, taste, mouthfeel: Hoboken Hot Bagel wins hands down. The OBagel bagel is bland, too soft/fluffy. Just because a bagel is freshly baked does not make it a good bagel. There is a *right* way to make a bagel and OBagel fails. I don't understand how they're getting all these 5 star reviews. Hoboken needs a serious lesson on what a good bagel is.
2016-03-24,5,Without contest the best bagel in Hoboken.  Nothing else even comes close.  Granted, I can totally understand why a lot of reviews say that the "flow" and the space creates issues with long lines and chaos.  (My first reaction when seeing this setup was "wow, this place must get cramped and crowded on weekends!).  However, I've only come on weekday afternoons where I get my bagel easily and painlessly so I cannot speak to those issues.  The bagels and spreads taste fabulous - would come back here without any hesitation.
2016-03-24,4,While I've only been once, and like to at least do 2 visits before reviewing, I thought I'd give them some love because it was pretty good!By far the best bagel option in Hoboken, Hoboken Hot bagels microwaves all their sandwiches and Bagels on the Hudson is pretty bad from taste to terrible service, I avoid it like the plague. So this is a really great addition to town.I ordered an egg and cheese on a whole grain everything bagel (I love they have whole grain everything bagels) and it was really good. A bagel sandwich isn't a culinary masterpiece but it was good and the bagel was chewy and delicious.  The wife got the same bagel with just cream cheese, which was equally as good.Yes they are new and need to work out some kinks, like ordering and how many registers. It is in a weird spot with no signage and the menu boards should probably explain what their sandwich creations actually contained, instead of sifting thru their paper menu.Overall, I wish them luck, I will definitely be back!
2016-03-13,3,Even though the bagel was alright, the staff is very unorganized there... I had to wait for more than 20 min to get my bagel sandwich prepared, even though it was only 3 people in front of me... somehow people after me were getting theirs first. One guy in front of me didn't get his sandwiches, cause they lost his ticket, so he just asked for a refund, cause he waited for a long time already... The layout is very unclear: a lot of people waiting upfront, which makes it very confusing when you enter the place. The menu is also not readable: you have to unfold the page to see all the items. Very unpleasant experience... Probably would give 2 stars, but since this place is new, I don't want to be too harsh on them. They definitely have to rethink their organization, cause if they handled 3 customers so long, how long will it take for 10 people... Seemed to be unfair for the guy on a grill, he was running like a chicken, and other guys just chitchatted by the register. Anyways I might try them one more time to see if they improved after their learning curve.
2016-03-12,5,Wow! You can't get any fresher bagels in Hoboken, as they are made completely on-site! I highly recommend O'Bagel, not just for breakfast but for anytime of the day. Great food and great service!
2016-03-08,5,Wow! Tremendous fresh bagels. My favorite in Hoboken. They have a lot of fun choices for cream cheese, can't wait to try them all. The staff is super friendly too. Glad they're here and hope they keep it up!
2016-03-07,5,As others mentioned, they need to improve the workflow, but hopefully that is a new-business kink that they will work out.  However, the bagels are wonderful and the homemade cream cheeses are great, especially the veggie cream cheese:  delicious smooth cream cheese with chunks of fresh vegetables.  We tried plain, egg, and cinnamon raisin bagels:  all were the best we've had in Hoboken.
2016-03-07,4,Let me start off by saying that if the bagels at this place weren't insanely good they'd get 1-2 stars. We had to try the new spot in town and they didn't disappoint (from a food perspective). The bagels are the best in town. The service/flow/amount of time it takes to get a bagel is insane though. Their food tickets were 30 minutes! I'll give them a pass since they're new but they need to find a way to make more than 3 breakfast sandwiches at a time.
2016-03-05,5,Best plain bagel in hoboken with a friendly staff! Small space with limited seating but that's not an issue for me. I got the plain bagel with plain cream cheese. The bagel had just enough dough and the right softness. I will definitely come back and try other stuff on their menu.
2016-03-05,5,Plain bagel was soft and light. Cream cheese was amazing. Easily the best bagel in Hoboken.
2016-03-04,5,Very friendly atmosphere, and the samples are awesome! Love the decor and the vibe inside the store! Will definitely come back!
