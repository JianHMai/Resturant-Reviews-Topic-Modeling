2021-11-15,4,I ordered Northern Soul's buttermilk chicken sandwich which cost $16 (via Seamless).Pros: Crispy. Tasty bun. Nicely portioned.Cons: Thicc chicken breast. To thicc. Can you be too thicc - yes. Should I stop saying thicc - also yes.Look it's very good. But the thickness of the breast put me off. I like a thinner crispier and yet juicy chicken breast that they have at other restaurants.The lettuce was just average iceberg. The tomato - Meh. The sauce tasted like 1000 Island vs a homemade sauce.Score: I give it a 8.1 out if 10. I would order it again and likely often if I lived by NoSo.
2021-11-10,5,I have been to NoSol before and loved the food and environment. I've always gone for casual meet-ups with friends and always had an incredible time. I decided to ask my bridal party to do a brunch together at NoSol for a way to all meet up and get to know each other. The staff went above and beyond to make sure we had an incredible time via their kindness and consideration. The food was delicious as always (and they had something for everyone), the drinks were memorable, and the atmosphere was inviting - which is exactly what we needed for everyone to get to know each other. NoSol has been my recommendation for friends and family as a great date spot,  brunch, casual bite and everything in between! There's no occasion where this spot isn't the perfect go-to!
2021-11-05,2,I ordered wings from them via Postmates. Instead, I get cauliflower bites. To crave & order an item, only for the wrong item to be delivered is one of the most frustrating things ever. Be better about ensuring you are cooking/packaging the right items to your customers.
2021-10-31,2,I came here with my boyfriend on Friday night and I just was truly disappointed. My boyfriend ordered the calamari and he said it was the saltiest and deep fried thing he's ever tried. Not only that, I tried ordering a beer and was told two times they were out of the things I tried ordering...like why put it on the menu then. The only good thing about my experience was the service given from the server. She was very sweet and tentative, and due to her I'll give this place two stars. Other than that, will not be back to northern soul
2021-10-23,2,I'm spite of the great menu and food. Don't come here in the weekend for dinner if you expect to have a conversation with anyone at your table. Eat outside or go elsewhere.Came here at 7pm on a Friday night for dinner with 10 people. The music was so loud that none of us could hear the person next to us. Asked a server if they could lower the music and we were told in a condescending manner " this is a sports bar, the music will be loud" and it seems they turned up the volume instead. There were large parties having dinner throughout the restaurant. This was mostly a restaurant at this time of day. Their website says it's a neighborhood joint with heathy comfort food and emphasizes food not sports. Nothing on the menu, webpage or in the space indicate it's a sports bar. It's a shame they've chosen this atmosphere. The food is great and offers a wide tasty variety they were a a great place.
2021-10-17,5,Brunched at Northern Soul yesterday for a surprise baby shower brunch, and had a great time. The brunch menu had so many options choose from. Usually I'm still hungry after having avocado toast, but Northern Soul's version came with eggs and a side (fries, breakfast potatoes, fruit or a salad) - and I was very happy with my choice! Looking at my friends plates, the Nutella French toast and bodega egg sandwich were also standouts.Our table was inside, but their patio area looked awesome. I plan to visit again for happy hour out there before it gets too cold!They can only split a group bill on 4 cards max. Not a big deal but worth noting if you're going with a large group!
2021-10-11,5,I've been at noso many times but this past Tuesday I went for Trivia and had the best time. I also tried the cauliflower bites because my server recommended them and OMG! I don't even like cauliflower and thought they were amazing. Cocktails are amazing too, best espresso martini in town.
2021-09-28,3,This place is loud fun and brings a pretty cool dive bar/ fancy restaurant mix. The service was pretty good for being a pretty busy night. My friends got the turkey burger and the salmon sandwich and loved it! However I got the vegetarian buttermilk chicken sandwich was absolutely disgusting, it was just mushy and the texture was horrible. Also I ordered the Mezcal Blackberry drink and it was horrible, my friends even tried to take a sip and we could not handle the horrible taste.I will come back though, I want to have hope in this restaurant that offers so many vegan and gluten-free options
2021-09-26,5,We hosted our daughters 2nd birthday here & it was perfect! The management and staff were so easy to work with leading up to, were flexible for us, and pulled everything off perfectly. The food was delicious & our family kept raving. The drinks were flowing too and everyone had a great time. Pricing was fair & we had an awesome time! Thanks Northern Soul!!
2021-08-22,5,Visited some friends in JC and they recommend we come here. Boy am I glad they did! I ordered the BLT and it seriously was the BEST BLT I ever had in my life!!!!! The bread was so crispy and the garlic aioli spread was out of this world! Ordered mimosas and they were made perfectly! Lots of vegan and gluten-free options which is a major plus and what make this place even better is that it's dog friendly. If you're in the area and look for yummy food and delicious drinks, definitely stop on in!!
2021-08-10,5,After an emergency room visit, decided to get some healthier fare for my son to consume. 5 minute drive from jersey city heights located on a quiet street with hardly any traffic. The front door is a heavy wooden door, something out of medieval times. Inside is more modern, complete with 2 booth areas for large parties, bar and a pool table. For Take out- head close to the kitchen area for assistance. The food itself was tasty. Salmon dinner comes with 2 sides. My son opted for the mashed potatoes which was creamy and not runny; and jasmine rice which was very yummy with flavor. The salmon was cooked very well with a tad crispiness to the outside. I got the crab sliders. My meal was a morsel appetizer. Very tasty but definitely not filling or a meal replacement. I would recommend this spot for young adults especially.
2021-08-06,5,The most magical amazing place on earth. I've struggled with finding restaurants that serve both vegan & nonvegan fare, and NoSo does just that (in the best way possible)!! The entire staff is so kind, friendly, and genuinely amicable; the food & drinks are perfect; and they host all sorts of fun events through the year. Perpetually thankful I found this place!
2021-07-26,5,Came here for brunch for a friends birthday and it was amazing! We sat in there "barrel" which is basically just a private room for about 10 people with couches and a huge table in the middle, felt very comfortable, like we were in someone's living room. The food itself was also amazing, they had so many vegan options, I decided to try a few. Tried the tofu mignon sandwich- texture was great, very crunchy. The seitan fried chicken sandwich it was a little too chewy for my taste but still pretty good, others liked it. Drinks were very creative and pretty strong, between the 8 of us, we tried almost each one.
2021-06-27,2,Have eaten at Northern Soul twice in the last 18 months, once inside and once out, and we will return but only if we can use our ears to hear our friends - likely outdoors. Food quality is really good; salmon, steak tenderloin, pizza all cooked well, full of flavor and prepared nicely. Menu includes many vegan options for those interested. We're not vegan and honestly can't pass judgement on the options. Draft beer selection is a little weak if you're looking for a dark beer and the cans and bottles don't really supplement that. Music; decent mix of 90s hip hop/rap. Volume is way too loud unless you're there to simply listen to music. Trying to converse with people sitting in the next chair was a challenge. We've seen hundreds of shows, between the four of us that ate together at Northern Soul yesterday, and all of us have ringing ears today. To create an atmosphere you need customers. If you play music so loudly it artificially destroys the atmosphere that's probably counter productive. Oh and it was still daylight outside, so not exactly a late night music scene. Northern Soul, that I believe the bar was named after given its motif and images of British musical artists influenced by the 60s musical movement, Is only represented by the motif and some musical choices. A lot of Northern England, where the northern soul movement started, likes its beer dark.Service was exceptional on both occasions; accommodating, helpful and considerate. Last night the waiter even petitioned to have the music lowered a little, successfully.  While the food is good the following incident summed it up: wife asked the manager if we could lower the volume and was told "it's a bar." It was a fairly empty bar/restaurant in the early evening. If the music is so loud glasses vibrate on tables perhaps it's a little too loud. If patrons have ringing ears the following day, perhaps the music is too loud. Still I'm sure the place was busy and a real music scene evolved. If it was just consistently busy and comparable with all other bars/restaurants in the area - what's the point of making it so loud?Shout to David, one of the loveliest and most genuine people in Hoboken. If you've not witnessed David go out of his way to help the elderly or offer to pickup groceries, he's worth your patronage alone. The obnoxious volume of music can help you determine if you stay for more than a drink.
2021-06-26,4,Great service.    Lovely people and patrons.   Also - if you are at disabled , wheelchair or knee scooter their women's washroom is great (the door is not super heavy so yeah).   I got dropped off in front and away I went to meet a super friendly staff)
2021-06-03,5,Northern Soul has become my go to spot in Hoboken.  Never disappoints.  Went last Friday for dinner and everything was delicious!  Their buffalo wings are one of my favorites!  But the best part was the gluten free ice cream sandwich. I had never eaten dessert there before and it was amazing.  Not to mention all the food came out super fast.  Cant wait to go back and try something else.
2021-05-22,4,Delicious food! I really appreciated the gluten free options. Be aware that pickup is very chaotic at least during COVID so in the future I'll probably only get delivery.
2021-05-20,3,Stopped in for a bite. Food good but beware of the "free" parking. We were there 2.5 hours got our parking pass validated and still had to pay to get out of the garage.  False advertising.
2021-04-27,5,Northern soul is whipping up an amazing brunch! The sweet chili wings were some of the crispiest ive had, the avocado toast was everything and the nutella strawberry french toast was so delicious. you can even brunch in their cute "soul shacks" , which are temp controlled greenhouses! Great service with a great menu, will definitely be back!
2021-04-26,4,This place has really great service and the food was not bad as welll. I got the eggplant parm sandwich and it was cooked well. The eggplant was a bit too mushy for my liking but the flavor was on point. Sweet and savory tomato sauce with and the fried breadcrumb batter was not too overpowering/thick
2021-04-13,2,Service was lackluster! We chose to sit inside since they had no availability outside due to spots being reserved. The staff practically forgot about us because they didn't come to our table after seating us for close to 30 minutes. It took a while for our food to come out too.As for the food, the vegan pizza could have been way better. The vegan cheese was sliding off the pizza and the pizza lacked flavor. The only good part of my meal were the jackfruit crab cake sliders (must try!).
2021-03-25,5,Loved this place! Went out with a group of friends without a reservation and they still seated us super quick. So glad this place had vegan options, I got the tofu mignon sandwich and it was BOMB! Great staff and service, were constantly checking up on us as we ordered drinks!
2021-03-25,5,We really love the soul shacks at Northern Soul.  Super toasty and private.  Also, there is a great waiter named Bichan (I hope I'm spelling that correctly) who has superior knowledge of the mag-lev train industry.
2021-03-19,2,Honestly, this used to be my go-to spot. Ever since Donald left, and the woman took over, it really has gone downhill. Message to the new gen manager- the customer is always right- don't fight and make excuses- apologize and be done with it. Really disappointed as what the popularity has done to NoSo
2021-03-19,3,Ordered delivery from northern soul last night. I ordered the NoSo Burger (added an extra patty and bacon with cheddar cheese) with house cut fries, Brussels sprouts, and scotch eggs. Love that they have their own brand stickers. Cute.When our food arrived, it was early and I thought that was great! However, everything was wet and soggy. Like it sat. For a while.   :(Anyway, the burger was AMAZING. We loved the flavor of the meat, the bacon and cheddar. Good amount of everything and great size! It was $16.95 cause of my additions of bacon and extra patty. It was worth it. The fries? No. If they were cooked as I requested then yes! They were soggy. We were able to put them in the broiler which helped but they aren't the same, you know? They were okay.The Brussels had good flavor and tasted fresh, but also very wet and soggy. Good portion for $6.95. I'd order them again AT the restaurant but not for delivery.The scotch eggs were my real disappointment. NEVER again. I ordered two eggs and it was $15. What arrived was one egg and it was small. Luckily I received a refund for my missing egg and disappointment lol. Thank you Grub Hub for helping. I would never order these again. WAY overpriced and unsatisfactory. Do not get!! You will be disappointed.So overall, we would go to the restaurant to order a double patty cheddar bacon NoSo burger with house cut fries hot and crispy! And Brussels sprouts hot and crispy. But no delivery and definitely no scotch eggs.    :)
2021-03-17,4,Planned a last minute brunch with some cousins and was pleasantly surprised when they had availability for a group of 8. We chose to sit outside in the "Soul Shacks". Note you do have to meet the $200 minimum of food/drink for the party size. We ordered the cauliflower bites, impossible burger slides and the poutine to share. The Buffalo cauliflower was great but the sliders really stole the show. Poutine fell a little flat. The bodega egg sandwich I got was delish (but the NYer inside me was screaming at paying $14 for a $5 sandwich). Good service, a decent beer selection and cocktails were really good - definitely worth a try if you haven't been here!
2021-03-16,5,I love this place!!! Amazing service, great vibe, and delicious drinks!! I haven't tried much of the food except the appetizers, but those were great!
2021-03-14,3,**DISCLAIMER: I never leave reviews unless I feel absolutely necessary**This experience began with several cups of water that tasted like they came straight out of a pool.  Luckily we were able to get bottled water, however, it came at a cost of ~$5.25 per bottle.  Despite complaining, our servers did not see fit to waive the charge on our bill.   Speaking of, we had three or four servers come to our table which felt nice at first but became confusing since we had no idea who was responsible for us.  This led to what inevitably would happen in us waiting a solid 30 minutes for our drinks to arrive, after reminding wait staff multiple times of our order.  During this time we watched several tables get their drinks.  I give credit to our waiter acknowledging the change over in staff that resulted in a missing ticket, but not trying to rectify the situation is enough for me to never go back there again.  I've lived in Hoboken for 6+ years and have never even heard of this place.  There are plenty of quality bars in Hoboken that serve great food so there's no reason I need to travel to the bowels of Hoboken to get an experience that tastes like pool water.The food was solid and the drinks were just ok.  Your best bet is to order draft beer, or just go anywhere else.
2021-03-14,3,This place gets a 3 simply because we really loved Waiter. Otherwise it is a total 2.75 based on the quality of the food but, say it with me folks, FOR SOME REASON YELP ELITE IS STILL NOT ALLOWED TO DOLE OUT HALF STARS. I mean it's just about time already! We made our reservation for one of the outdoor Soul Shacks, which are very cool and get extremely sanitized in between each party. We had to wait a few min for ours to be ready and sort of delighted over the fact that this place has been here since 2008 and is only a 5-7 min walk from our building, yet we've never tried it. I'm actually pretty upset with myself that we didn't get to it sooner, but then again this is all to say that the food wasn't that great. The flatbread is really what made us realize this was typical bar food but like, really. I was so excited to come for all the vegan options on the menu, and it's great that they're available; don't get me wrong -- it's just that everything is fried. That's like their solution for vegan food here - well it must taste good fried! That was OK for me yesterday because I was slightly nauseous and needed all of the fried things. I also did love the sweet potato fries.Waiter was fun and we had some good banter. For a place with interesting cocktails, you expect them to taste a bit better and I have to be honest mine kind of just sucked for an interesting take on a spicy margarita. (I would come back for the sweet potato fries and to chat with Waiter about his restaurant tee which is a play on the PornHub logo.
2021-03-10,1,We've been to Northern Soul before and had a good experience. The most recent trip wasn't good. We used Resy to join the waitlist and received a text that the estimated wait was only 15 minutes. While walking over I received a text that there was a hightop available if we were interested. I asked if they had hightop highchairs since we had a toddler with us. I was simply told "no sorry we dont". I checked in with the hostess Kelly and again said we had a toddler. She acknowledged us and we sat down to wait. 30 minutes later we still hadn't been seated and I asked her about it. She said we weren't on the list because they only had high tops. Even though she had walked by us several times, she never bothered to tell us that there weren't regular tables available.
2021-03-07,1,Tried to go here on a Friday late night with a reservation. Fully assumed it was a restaurant but was ID'd by a bouncer who was speaking so rudely as soon as I walked in. I had forgotten my ID which was fine but this guy was so rude about it. I was really there to get a bite to eat over getting a drink. This guy followed our party out of the restaurant and tried to instigate a physical fight with my guy friends, who did not reciprocate. He even grabbed me and shoved me. Not cool whatsoever.. I'll never support a restaurant or business who employ peope who physically assault women. Avoid at all costs.
2021-03-07,5,Boom! Great service and staff all around.. keep up the solid work fellas! You're in the business of service and performing at the top of your game.. other places in hoboken need to replicate, most of them suck!
2021-02-22,3,My girlfriends and I were excited to visit Northern Soul as we loved the idea of their heated Soul Shacks! I want to highlight the reservation process:I made the reservation on the Resy app for their Soul Shack in which on the weekends (since it's their busiest), you have to pay for a deposit. The deposit for 4 people was $100 which is applied to the bill. I had to change the date of the reservation because of snow so through the Resy app, I clicked "change reservation," switched the dates and was charged $100 again ($106.63 plus tax). I thought that was annoying especially since I already paid $106 for the first reservation. I think the Resy app should definitely update that. A couple days later I was refunded $106 from the first reservation. What I also noticed was that $100 was applied to the bill but what about the remaining $6.63? Is that just tax from the Resy app? If so, that is an inconvenience. An extra $6.63 going towards what?When arriving, I was able to find street parking and did not have to pay since it was Sunday. They do have a parking garage somewhere (I couldn't find it) where they validate the parking if you're visiting the restaurant. Hoboken parking is already hard to find so the fact that they have a parking lot with free validated parking is a plus! Myself as well as 4 other people were confused as we were looking for the front door. A guy next to us found a back door and came out to open the front door for us so here is a tip: The doors are the big wooden type doors in front of the Soul Shacks LOL! When we arrived, we were immediately seated in our Soul Shack. Now...these Soul Shacks are teeny tiny for a group of 4 people. I saw other shacks with 4 people in it that had way more space; around 8 seats in them. For 4 people, you cannot fit all your food on the table inside. The Soul Shack is good for a group of 2 or if you have 4 you just do drinks but food? You'll be holding things on your lap. I suggest requesting a bigger shack if they have them available. The shack was cute though, they had a heater where you can change the temperature and it's decorated with lights and greenery. It also has a door so you can close it or leave it open. Another reason why we were excited for this visit was because of their vegan options! For food, we started off with the Cauliflower Bites ($10) which were crispy and delicious. It was paired with a ranch type sauce that brought the bites THERE! For the main entree, I ordered the Vegan Crispy Buttermilk Chicken sandwich ($16) with french fries. I was sadly disappointed. I wish the fries were crispier as well as the sandwich. The sandwich was sorta bland and the "chicken" didn't taste like anything. I think if it was battered with some sort of sauce it would've been better. For dessert, we opted for the tres leches ($7). It was decent, I wish the cake had more of the milk that that the cake was surrounded with on the dish. It was a bit dry but not horrible. My sister enjoy the Spicy Santa cocktail ($13) as well as the jackfruit crab cake sliders ($12). She stated the sliders had too much old bay and mayo but she did enjoy the seafood-like flavor. My friends ordered the tofu power bowl which she subbed tofu for chicken ($14) and the nutella french toast ($12). Although the reservation and the food was disappointing, I may come back to sit inside as the inside looks cozy. Also, another thing I wanted to point out was you need to spend $100 as that was charged through the Resy app for the reservation. One of my friends barely spent $25 so I think to spend $100 was a bit too much pressure. Our total bill came out to $142.39 and we only had to pay $42.39 at the restaurant. 18% gratuity was added for $23.60 so keep that in mind as well. Shout out to our waiter Seamus; he was great!!
2021-02-22,4,5 stars for the Soul Shacks and 3 stars for the eats made for a solid 4 star experience.I've been to Northern Soul plenty of times over the years and it's always a reliable spot to grab a beer while listening to some great music. Sometimes (pre-covid) they even have live music which is always a treat. In Covid times they have adapted wonderfully by opening up Soul Shacks -- temperature controlled greenhouses that kept us warm and comfortable during a blustery winter day. Many restaurants offer outdoor heat lamps, igloos and the like, but the soul shacks are the best outdoor dining option that I've seen. I was nervous about being cold and the shacks were perfectly warm and cozy. They are also adorable -- see through greenhouses with lots of hanging greenery draped around the tops and sides. It was nice to look out at the other brunch goers and the streets of Hoboken. My friends and I agreed that this style of dining is something we'd love in the future, even in a world without Covid. Hopefully Northern Soul can keep it up and more restaurants can try this out as well.A few more logistics about the Shacks:-Some shacks fit up to 4 while others fit up to 6. It's $100 to reserve for 4 and $200 to reserve for 6, but this is applied to your food and drink. So it's a very easy spend to hit, especially for 4 and if people in your group are drinking-Brunch is served until 4 PM-You have an hour and a half in the shack-Reservations can only be made online via Resy -Definitely make a reservation in advance, as these seem to fill up fast-Service is great. Though we were outside our server didn't miss a beat and continuously checked in on us! Otherwise, the food was just okay. Nothing to write home about, but definitely got the job done. We shared an order of poutine that was pretty small and lackluster. I ordered a chicken caesar salad that didn't really feel restaurant quality -- the kale felt more like a bag of spinach, the chicken was a little rubbery and the croutons a bit stale. Either way, it was still tasty and the real highlight of the experience was the soul shack. For outdoor winter dining during Covid this is as good as it gets.
2021-02-22,3,I stopped by Northern Soul on a Sunday afternoon with some girlfriends for Brunch. We were sat inside of one of their shacks, that we reserved beforehand, and used a QR code for the menu. The staff were all wearing masks and our waiter was very chill from the start. I was slightly disappointed with the size of shack because I felt like it was more ideal for a party of 2. The table was slightly too small for four people to fit all of our food and drinks. There was a heater inside the shack, which kept our legs and feet super warm, so we tried to make the best of it!To start off my Brunch, I went with ordering the Spicy Santa cocktail (Jalapeño-infused Tequila, Fresh Lime Juice, Agave, Cranberry Juice) to pair with an order of Cauliflower Bites (Rice Flour Tempura Cauliflower w/ choice of sauce) coated with Sweet Chili Sauce. The Spicy Santa cocktail was delicious and the perfect combination between spicy, sour and sweet. You could taste the liquor, but it was not too strong. It definitely had heat to it, but it was very nice and not too spicy. I would highly recommend this drink! The Cauliflower Bites were also good and perfectly crispy. The sweet chili sauce was decent but was not as strong as I would have expected. The ranch that the appetizer comes with did enhance the dish, making it one of my favorite plates of the day.Although it's listed as a Starter, I ordered the Jackfruit Crab Cake Sliders (Jackfruit Patty, Old Bay Mayo, Pickled Red Onion, Microgreens) as my main meal with a side order of House Cut French Fries. The dish came with three sliders and was the perfect amount of food with the addition of the French fries. Overall, I enjoyed the sliders and found them to be flavorful. I have not eaten crab cakes in a while, but I could definitely taste a seafood-like flavor with the sliders. The patty looked great and the bread was nice & soft. I did think there was slightly too much Old Bay mayo, but they're definitely worth a try! The fries were also noticeably handmade, crispy and seasoned well.I was full after my meal, but decided to go for the Tres Leches. The plating was pretty and the flavor was decent, but it was a pretty standard Tres Leches. I would recommend trying another dessert option, but it wasn't bad!All in all, I would rate my experience at Northern Soul a 3.5. They do have a friendly staff, heated shacks, great drinks and a variety of vegetarian/vegan options. If you're looking for a solid place for Brunch, I would say it's worth giving a try!
2021-02-15,3,Let me start off by saying the food was amazing & the service was also amazing. 10/10 in those aspects.  HOWEVER - they do NOT do the "double sanitized with disinfectant and high intensity ultra violet light after every use, they are also vented to keep air circulating" with their Soul Shacks. I witnessed one booth NOT get disinfected at all between customers. Only the dishes were cleared. Then 3 more booths only get 1 round of "disinfecting" which is really just spraying down the table with cleaning spray (which is the same amount of cleaning bars did pre-covid). There is a heater inside - but I do not think this heater acts as "vented to keep air circulating". They would leave the doors open to the booths in between customers but that would only be for about 2-3 minutes. It looked like there was a window at the top of our soul shack but it was rubber banded shut & did not look like we could open it. I NEVER once saw their "MTA Ultraviolet fogger" used by anyone at any time.  This was the first restaurant we've been to in a year & we thought we were choosing a safe spot. I am not confident our booth was cleaned based on what they advertise on their site & not sure how many people had been in that booth throughout the day before we were there. We will likely get tested in a few days to be safe. Not sure when we will attempt to eat out again - but it will most likely be somewhere with tables out in the open & outside.  I get that things are busier over the holidays but you cannot skip steps in the cleaning process - especially if you clearly state it on your own website that you do these things. Perhaps they need more staff to keep up with the amount of cleaning that needs to be done or they overbooked their booths.
2021-02-11,5,My friends and I have been here twice over the winter to eat and drink in their heated greenhouses, which are nice and toasty even when the outside temperature is well below freezing. The cocktails are delicious, and there's something on the menu for everyone. There's one waiter names Seamus who's extremely kind and ended up bringing a round of complimentary shots out to our group at the end. Overall great outdoor dining experience, I'll definitely be going back soon!
2021-01-27,4,My friends and I decided to pay Northern Soul a visit to try out the soul shacks. Besides these being the perfect Instagram worthy moment, they offer a private little oasis in this Covid world. These little private dining pods take the stress away of indoor dining. They offer options for 2-4 people and also options for larger groups. Each soul shack is heated - and trust me it's comfortable in there, we went on a day where it was barely 25 degrees and were totally comfortable without our jackets on! The food was also great - I highly recommend the salmon BLT. There are plenty of vegan options too if that's your jam but also plenty of non vegan options so don't be deterred.  Another perk is that they validate parking for the lot next door. This is a major win in my book since parking in that area can be a nightmare. But heads up, the parking is only good for 3 hours! We were 12 minutes over the limit and ended up having to pay the garage fee!
2021-01-24,5,The soul shacks are awesome!  Fun way to eat out while being socially responsible.  Menu is super vegan and gluten friendly, and the fun twists on bar food items are tasty!  The crispy cauliflower with sweet chili sauce was the best!  Servers are attentive too, making sure to check up on us just often enough to make sure we had everything we need (because, you know, we are in these huts and can't flag them down) but not too often to be annoying.  Overall a great experience.
2021-01-17,5,I loved Northern Soul, the service, food and atmosphere were great here! I cannot wait to come back and try the rest of the menu, I thought everything was delicious!
2021-01-05,5,Amazing as ever, this bar has top-notch food, (as always), great seasonal cocktails, and has clearly been going the extra mile to keep folks safe. Their snacks are warm, super cozy, and feel like such an inventive and safe option in the cold months. My partner and I both work in food service as well, and it's not easy to convert everything like that, and keep up such good service with so many new restrictions and requirements, but they do it, and do it so well. Super grateful for northern soul.
2021-01-03,4,A group of girlfriends and I decided to try this spot out and I was looking forward to it. When I arrived I had to circle the area a bit and finally found a parking spot. The place was cute and they had indoor and outdoor seating. We sat outdoors and it was a closed in area with heaters and filters in each of them and it was a cool idea. Pedro was our waiter and he was good and had a good memory. I ordered the vegan Bodega sandwich which had Just eggs, beyond sausage and violife cheese on a roll and it was pretty good. The girls had different items all around and they liked their meals. For a drink I ordered the vodka tonic which the bartender messed up by putting in seltzer instead.  Pedro fixed it himself and it came out good. The bill was reasonable and gratuity was included of 20%. I definitely will be back to try more vegan option meals.
2020-12-27,5,The outdoor igloos are fantastic!!!  My husband and I had a very last minute opportunity to get out of the house without the baby but because we see our moms we haven't dined indoors.  They are very cozy and really kept in the heat despite it being 30 degrees.  The service was excellent and very attentive!  Loved that they could knock on the door and we could give the thumbs up if we were ok.  The espresso martini was the BEST!  There are so many vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options on the menu, I was shocked!  If you are dining out with a group of mixed dietary preferences, Northern Soul is a great option.  The wings were awesome and the filet sandwich is a must order!  When we do get out, Northern Soul will be the top choice.
2020-12-25,5,Booked a Soul Shack to celebrate my daughter's birthday and it was a perfect idea. Comfortably fit my family of 5...the heat was a plus. Our waiter was great...service was very attentive and the food was delicious. Lots of true gluten free options (hello French fries!!) and vegan alternatives. Buffalo cauliflower was nice...salads were fresh and made with quality ingredients. Will definitely return.
2020-12-24,4,Our heated enclosed igloo was just what we wanted during covid - outdoor dining with heat! We ordered around of Christmas drinks to start. I'm not a beet fan,but I ordered the beet salad with grilled chicken because I love baby arugula, spiced almonds (I think they were just lightly toasted, though), cashews, and goat cheese. The dressing was called orange honey and it was a truly delicious salad. The chicken was amazing, too. I would have preferred raw shaved beet instead of the roasted beets. The waiter was surprised by my little pile of uneaten beets, but the salad was a great choice despite the beets LOL?So check out their drink menu for some drinks with definitely cool names (like Shut Up Mariah Carey). I ordered the Christmas cookie. It was made with bourbon, hazelnut liquor, cinnamon, maple, and nutmeg. I found it a bit strong and would have preferred something sweeter and more cookie-ish. However, the Northern Soul was nice, cozy, warm, and delicious. A definite WIN.
2020-12-19,5,Such a cute outdoor set up and reasonable prices with great service!!! Came for my 22nd birthday and had a blast
2020-12-17,5,This bar and their staff go above and beyond for their patrons. I love coming here. They are extremely attentive and friendly, the food is amazing, and I always have a wonderful experience! I cannot recommend it enough! Plus side is it's great for vegans as well!
2020-12-15,3,Glad this place can continue operating during Covid, the buttermilk chicken sandwich was amazing. We booked one of the shacks and my only reason for 3 stars is that the service is horrible. We were so rushed even though we weren't pass our timelimit. In addition, because gratuity is added the servers don't put an effort. I am not sure if I would return, despite being in a pandemic that isn't an excuse not to do your job.
2020-12-12,2,Normally I love Northern Soul, but tonight the food was way below their standard quality. I ordered the Tofu Mignon Sandwich with the glazed carrots as a side. The carrots were not glazed and very depressing. The sandwich was drenched in oil to the point where every bite it dripped down my hand. The amount of transparent napkins left over after attempting to eat just a small portion was alarming.On better days, NoSo is a must try. However tonight it was not. The drinks are phenomenal, and the food is usually amazing. This one occasion was just disappointing.
2020-12-09,5,The outdoor seating was incredible. Little outdoor huts that can fit up to 3 people comfortably (or at least ours was big enough for 3 people). They're heated and you can close them, which was awesome I must say. Brunch everyday is also a plus! I ordered the steak and eggs and it did not disappoint. Had a gin and juice with my brunch and that was also delicious. Our server was also extremely nice and super accommodating. Highly recommend.
2020-12-08,5,Great food and good portions. I've ordered from here a few times and haven't been disappointed yet. Their hanger steak and fired chicken sandwich are amazing! Also, love their side options.
2020-11-30,5,I read a Yelp review prior to my visit here and it called Northern Soul a hidden gem... I can't put into words a better description. First - the COVID protocols are followed To the highest standard. Masks, QR code menus, social distancing, you name it. They even have "Soul Shacks" you can reserve to have a little greenhouse all to yourself. Second - back to the "Soul Shacks." We reserved one through Resy. You will be required to make a deposit with the reservation. It's then applied toward you bill. Each Shack has a minimum, but with a drink and dinner it's totally reasonable to meet. We got four comfortably in our greenhouse. Each house has its own heater for your comfort and the ability to open the windows if you're feeling too warm. I am always cold and I can promise you, it's very comfortable. Finally - the food. The menu has a solid variety. Anything from salmon to curry dishes to tacos. Both food and drinks are very reasonably priced. I started with the Blackberry Smash. I'm not kidding when I say this is my favorite drink in Hoboken. Fresh berries and mezcal... incredible. For dinner our table ordered the turkey burger, salmon BLT, salmon entree and fried chicken sandwich. We were pleased with everything we ordered. I personally, would have the turkey burger over and over again. We ended the night with espresso martinis, and my must have, a cup of tea. I can't end this review without highlighting the service. From the minute we arrived until our last drink, they really took care of us. I always love when the staff come with recommendation in hand and can basically anticipate our next move. Needless to say, we'll be back often.
2020-11-16,5,Came here for a birthday brunch with a reservation. The numerous vegan options really excited me! I shared the cauliflower Buffalo bites - which were surprisingly super crunchy and came with an amazing green sauce (no idea what it was made of). For my main entree, I ordered the vegan egg plate which came with just egg, beyond sausage, home fries, and toast. Flavors were amazing - simple but savory! The portion size was good- Filling enough that I didn't feel the need to order more food. Definitely can't wait to come back to try more vegan brunch options!
2020-11-13,1,If you're looking to book a reservation and wait 45 min to be sat to only be greeted by a passive aggressive and dissmisive host then this is the place for you. The outdoor "Soul Shack" is a cold small box with no music or service. Great potential just unfortunate they can't execute what they promise online.
2020-11-11,4,I like this place a lot... especially for vegan food. My boyfriend and I love to order the impossible burger and it comes with amazing potato-y French fries! Fries are seriously so good... I love when you can really taste the potato if you know what I mean. Any way, the impossible burger fulfills our burger cravings. Love it because I never feel grossly full after eating it.This time, I ordered the vegan buttermilk chicken. It was good and I enjoyed it. I wouldn't say that it tasted exactly like chicken... but it was still pretty delicious. I'd probably only order it if I was in the mood for a crispy chicken sandwich. Otherwise burger is definitely #1.We also loves the cauliflower bites with hot sauce! So good and the best way to eat cauliflower IMO. The only thing I would say is that the white sauce it comes with is kinda eh. But you don't need it anyway! Last but not least I LOVE veggies in general so we got a market plate: tomatoes, asparagus, mushrooms, kale. Overall a little disappointed... had a weird smokey flavor to them we didn't like. We actually ended up throwing them out. Will not be ordering again.The other thing is that this place is kind of expensive but the food quality is great. Each item is about $15-17.
2020-10-27,4,Getting to love this place more and more .. went back there for lunch today and the grilled salmon with glazed carrots was simply amazing .. bartender was different today and also very nice and helpful .. so far so good .. their froze is very good , I just feel that the machine is not cold enough and the drink melts to fast .. maybe needs to be on longer . But aside from that all is good , they also have cute little individual tables outside with little igloos ( looks like one ) so cute and is also heated and cozy .
2020-10-05,2,I wanted to like this place. As a vegetarian, the broad number of meatless dishes was appealing. Unfortunately, first weird point was that their menu on Grub Hub vs the online order menu on their site had different items. Ultimately, I got the tofu mignon. I've never had chimichuri and it was appealing.I did pick up, and live 10 minutes away. By the time I got home, everything was soggy. The sandwich was this little thing, maybe 5"x5"? It had fried tofu, fried onions, goat cheese, and some herbs. It was not a chimichuri by any definition. The sandwich was super dry, and the only flavor came from the goat cheese. It came with a side of fried that were soggy as well. The sandwich was not at all filling, specially for $14. The fries filled me up, and they were sub par as well. Not salted, not crispy... They tasted like frozen grocery store fries. If they were made on site, I'm honestly shocked.If you wanna try something different, go ahead I guess? Just don't have any expectations.
2020-09-27,5,This place was great. Came for the vegan options  and they did not disappoint. I've ordered twice here in a week since first trying.
2020-09-13,2,Got the vegan linguini bolognese and the vegan eggplant parm. Both lacked taste and were expensive. Not going back.
2020-09-09,5,I recently moved out of the area and really miss coming here! Laid-back, cool atmosphere, great drinks and fantastic menu- especially their vegan options!! Nice seating outdoors, good staff. Doesn't get mobbed like some downtown Hoboken restaurants, it's really nice and I'll be taking a trip back just to go here.Vegan Fried Chicken SandwichBuffalo CauliflowerAperol Spritz
2020-08-30,4,Menu: bring your carnivore and herbivore friends here! This restaurant was really nice they had many options for vegan and meat lovers alike. The impossible burger was cooked just right and the chili kale was delicious as a substitute. The buttermilk chicken sandwich was so juicy and crispy it made my mouth water.Seating: With Covid they have outdoor seating, it's a little tight but we made do. Drinks: The drinks were OK ...no real wow factor. I would come back to this restaurant. The staff was attentive and friendly.
2020-08-27,3,I recently went back to Northern Soul and had a mediocre experience.  While the food and drinks were enjoyable, I was extremely dissatisfied with their response to COVID-19 protocols.  We arrived and were offered a small, cramped table on their patio that was so close to the neighboring group, that the back of my chair was touching the back of one of theirs.  We moved our table further away, but the experience continued to make us uneasy.  We were handed laminated black menus that showed a plethora of fingerprints all over them.  Despite our concerns, we each ordered a Blackberry Mezcal Smash, one of our favorite cocktails around town.  We loved its balance of smoke and tart berries.  We also requested their 3 Taco Special and were asked if we wanted some hot sauce on the side.  We concurred and were given a communal bottle that was likely to have been touched by countless other diners.  Again, we tried to push our reservations aside and enjoy our dinner.  However, I found my chicken tacos dry and was disappointed to see my fish taco was fried, which had not been mentioned on the menu.  Overall, the entree was just mediocre.We have really enjoyed Northern Soul in the past, particularly for the drinks and pre-pandemic atmosphere, so we were extra disappointed by this recent visit.
2020-08-10,5,Im love with this place, Just amazing! Great variety on beers, drinks. But specially the staff attention was something I haven't seen in any other place. Hoping to be back in there soon. Enamorada de este lugar! Espectacular. Gran variedad de cervezas y tragos. Lo mejor de todo es la atención del personal, todos son increíblemente atentos y amables. Espero poder volver pronto.
2020-08-09,4,They have poutine! Honestly some of the best hand cut fries around. I've had their kale Caesar salad twice and the first time it was amazing, but the second time there were more than a few yellowed kale leaves and they forgot to include the lemon wedge. Both times they packed the grilled chicken separately, which is a much appreciated thoughtful way to pack food so the chicken stays warm, while the salad stays crisp.
2020-08-09,1,Wanted to give our local neighbor some business, especially during hard coronavirus times. First experience they were ABSOLUTELY BEYOND RUDE, not to mention my Caesar salad was mediocre at best- and it's really hard to mess up one of the most basic salads on the planet. We all have our days, so we regretfully decided to to give them another chance. This time they actually superseded our initial bad experience on every level. Kudos for setting the bar so low that the quality of both your service, attitude and food absolutely suck. We really wanted to love this place and made several efforts to give them the opportunity to redeem their shortcoming but unfortunately they continue lacking on several measures. For the record, our orders were all to-go, so I don't even want to imagine nor will I ever entertain the possible opportunity of what a sit out experience might entail. Prepare yourself for at least a 40 min wait for one order shrimp skewers because that's how long it took for the take-out. Forgot to mention when asked to check on the order status because it seemed excruciatingly long for again something fairly simple, we were asked to leave. Absurd.I hate to bash a business, honestly- but save yourself the effort and money because it's reallly not worth it.
2020-08-01,4,Outdoor seating during covid. Nice lil patio area. Went with my girlfriend and her roommate for dinner and drinks. Very solid beer and wine selection. They also have claws, high noons, and other mixed drinks. Also been here before for brunch too. Food is great anytime of day and service is good as well. They have vegan/veggie options if you don't like/can't eat typical bar fare. If you're looking for a place to hang out and enjoy a time with friends for a meal or drinks you're not gonna find a better spot in Hoboken.
2020-07-07,5,I always say Northern Soul is my favorite vegan restaurant in the area (even though they're not 100% vegan). I've never been there physically but I order delivery from them 2-3x times a month. Yes, my wallet is crying but this place is worth it. I will not eat sweet potato fries from anywhere else and their salads are great. I've tasted pretty much everything vegan off their menus (they are seasonal!) at this point. The new tofu sandwich is one of their best items. I would eat it every day if I could. Crispy, flavorful, decadent but not overly so. The new mango ceviche is also good (but nothing great in all fairness - I would've been happier to see them try to make a more classic ceviche with Heart of Palm and avocado or something). Their vegan meatloaf (winter menu item) is top tier. Please try the vegan fried chicken sandwich and thank me later. You won't even miss the meat. They do have more healthier options (especially if you want to order side dishes primarily) but I like to get my junk food cravings on because there aren't many restaurants in the area that have their offerings. Hungry Like The Wolf is also their outfit (vegan pizzeria!) and I fully recommend them but that's a separate review. I hope to come here one day so I can review the service, ambience, drinks, etc, but for now they're just how I splurge on takeout.
2020-07-06,5,Wow. My husband and I just got take out from here and we will think about those burgers for weeks to come. Excellent & fresh burgers with a side salad and fries. Can't wait to order from here again!
2020-05-23,5,The takeout options here are great, especially the combo with a protein and two sides - they have a lot of healthy choices. Like many of us, I feel like a beached whale in quarantine and this was a refreshing option for good food that I don't feel bad about eating afterwards. I had the breaded chicken and my husband had the salmon and we both thought it was delicious, we'll definitely be ordering from here more often!
2020-03-02,5,If you want to get your Vegan on this is the place to go. Everything from the food to the drinks and the ambiance is great. And if you are a new vegan and have a craving for some incredible pizza. Try Hungry Like a Wolf. Conveniently located in side Northern Soul. And they serve at the bar!!!  Check it out. You won't be disappointed.
2020-02-23,5,This spot is a hidden gem in Hoboken! It's removed from the crazy bar scene of Washington so I have never heard of this place before finding them on Instagram. They have wonderful vegan options and non vegan options as well. The vibe is super cool and the waiters/waitresses and very nice and accommodating. We had a party of 5 on a Saturday night and everyone enjoyed their meal. I highly recommend the buffalo cauliflower, it's not too thick of a coating and perfectly cooked. I can't wait to go back  and sit on the outside patio!They also validate parking at the parking lot next door.
2020-01-03,5,I am a regular with ordering seamless from Northern Soul. I love the spinach and salmon-- so delicious.While it is almost always on time, tonight just wasn't there night I guess. At the 25 minute late mark, I called the restaurant to see the status. They went above and beyond and reached the driver and refunded my order.  This was pure class on their part. They really didn't have to.  The order arrived 10 minute later and the driver was super polite about the inconvenience.
2019-11-22,5,I should have reviewed Northern Soul a long time ago.  Lately, we are eating dinner there once a week. Our son loves the kids menu and his fave is the gluten free pizza (go figure!). Yesterday, our waiter remembered our last order which felt very much like Cheers, where everybody knows your name. We love the salmon and the impossible burger and so much more.  I'm so lucky they are right across the street in Hoboken. Yay!
2019-11-17,5,This is my daughters' favorite place. The hanger steak always comes out perfectly and the sides are fan favorites, no matter which they order. And when my dad comes in town, this is his choice as well. Friendly "know-your-name" staff completes the experience as well. And let's not forget the s'mores dessert, which allows them all to cook their own desert (or eat the ingredients pre-cooked).
2019-11-14,5,Great place for food and drinks. Great selection of bioth vegan and regular food! You can indulge yourself in confort food but also stay on the healthier side if you wish to. Great selection of craft beers and if you go on Tuesday they have trivia night which is awesome! Also open mic on Wednesday!
2019-11-07,2,Northern Soul? More like lifeless hole.... been there twice once during the week other time Friday evening... both dead... tender is a bit shifty...I prefer to pay cash and leave it down but had to watch whether I was being overcharged... no big deal on $3 gansetts... just watch your stack and don't have a shot at the end... I thought it was complimentary and I was obviously about to leave but he was quick to charge me and skimmed the top of the stack...way to leave a sour taste with a customer...whatever, you live you learn.
2019-10-24,1,Charged for drinks I didn't order. I went to Northern Soul for some drinks and a little food. I was at the bar with my date. We were there for a few hours and over the course of the night the bartender would refill our drinks without us asking. Whenever one of us got up to use the restroom he would fill our drink without asking first. On a few occasions we mentioned that we didn't want another, but he refilled it anyway. When I went to pay I saw he charged me for every drink, even the ones I didn't order and explicitly said I didn't want. In fairness we did drink them, but was shocked to see a $100 bill. The bartender could tell we were on a date, and we think he used that in order to run up a tab, knowing we wouldn't say anything. The WORST part: at the end of the night we grabbed our jackets and stood up, and I asked my date if she wanted a tequila shot. She said not really and I agreed and we began to walk out. The bartender motioned to us to come over and poured us and himself a shot saying "Here take this." We all took the shot, and when I turned to walk away he said, "Wait there's a charge for those", and demanded I give him my credit card.Even though I live two blocks away, I'll never go back.
2019-09-02,4,So I've been here twice. The first time was very late at night and we had a very mediocre experience with food, the vibe, the service. Maybe late at night just isn't the time to go. The waitress was a little rude and the food was not good. Yesterday my fiancé and I tried to go to jersey social and found out it was closed so we wanted to go somewhere we can walk to. Northern soul came up even tho it's in Hoboken it was a 10 minute walk so we went. I almost didn't realize it was the same place we had been too until I stepped inside. The inside is a little dark but still cute. We chose to sit outside since it was a beautiful day. We had a late brunch and it was delicious. I got the avocado toast which hit the spot for me and my fiancé for the salmon blt which he really seemed to enjoy. I had the fruit side and the fruit was fresh and yummy. He had fried also yummy. The service was a little slow but I think there was only one waitress since it was kind of off hours and she was very pleasant. We ask got a carafe of the white sangria and asked if it was sweet. She said the bartender will make it as less sweet as possible which means he actually makes it on the spot which is awesome. She kept her promise and we enjoyed the sangria a lot. Definitely didn't think I'd come back but really enjoyed my time here yesterday so my opinion has changed :) also dogs are allowed outside and I love eating with neighboring canine companions
2019-08-30,4,This place only popped up on my radar 2 months ago, and I've already been there 4 times, so I'm gonna say... I dig it.I love that there is a variety of vegan options on the menu.  Everything I've eaten has been great, but I will say that the crispy tofu Bahn mi is hands down, my favorite! Drink specials are good and the place itself has a really chilled out vibe. I dig the pool table and dart board and I love the couch/ lounge area as well as the outdoor space. I heard they opened up a rooftop portion, but I haven't seen it yet. Can't wait to go back tho!!Disclaimer: I've only been there during the afternoon on all of my trips, so it was never packed and service was good, but I can only imagine it gets crazy packed at night. It's just a really cool vibe. I def recommend.
2019-08-21,5,I just recently hosted my boyfriend's 30 birthday party at Northern Soul and it was an amazing experience. The space worked out great for my guests, people were able to sit in the barrel room or at the high tops and everyone had enough space to move around. The service was also amazing! The food was great! Many of the guests from the party commented they enjoyed the food, especially the meatballs. Working with Donal and Marc to plan the party and figure out the drinks/food menu was a breeze! Before, during, and after the party started the staff was very helpful, I cannot express enough thanks for all their help and hard work that day! Thank you again to Donal, Marc and the Northern Soul staff who helped me throw the party without a hitch!
2019-08-14,5,Had a great experience hosting my daughter's first birthday in Northern Soul's "barrel room"! The space worked really well - adults could sit and eat, and there was room for my daughter to roam around and also open her presents. The staff was super helpful beforehand and great on the day itself. Food and drinks were delicious. Many people ended up trying some of their great vegan options - a win for us because it meant most people weren't eating milk and eggs, which my kid is allergic to :)
2019-08-09,5,Unbelievably tasty crispy tofu Bahn mi. Everything was fresh and delicious. Looking forward to trying other menu items
2019-07-29,4,Had lunch here on a Sunday. Really professional and friendly staff. Great atmosphere. Good drinks. The burger I had was underwhelming, especially for the $15 I paid for it; the bun was mediocre and it had one slice of tomato and one leaf of lettuce but the side of spinach I ordered was delicious. I'll come again, yet probably just get drinks and sides.
2019-07-27,5,A great bar with great food. I love this place because of their GF and Vegan options. I'm not a vegan or GF but I do try to eat as little meat and gluten as possible. This place makes me not even miss either one of those things. They have great appetizers to share and great entrees as well. Their cauliflower bites are my go to and the rice flour coating makes it so crispy and delicious. Their drink menu is great as well, I love ordering all of their different cocktails and trying the different flavors, they've never disappointed. Service is great as well, overall a great bar that I've been visiting often and plan to continue visiting.
2019-07-13,5,Northern Soul has great food for brunch and dinner PLUS it is kid and dog friendly (on the outside). The beer selection is also great. Definitely worth the visit (the parking is also free).
2019-07-06,4,Came here based on the Yelp recs, great choice! Just had brunch there this morning. There's a wide variety of regular, vegetarian, and vegan brunch options. I had the avocado toast with scrambled eggs and smashed potatoes. Delicious and a nice big piece of bread. I like my eggs dry and lightly browned, and they cooked them perfectly. My pals seemed to like their choices--my friend loved the sauce that comes with the egg in a hole. The smashed potatoes were reasonable, but could have used a little more seasoning and seemed a bit grainy. Still good, still full several hours later.Didn't try to booze but also have a nice range of boozy and booze-free cocktails. We had most of the place to ourselves, which surprised me! Good service. I'd come here again the next time I'm in town.
2019-05-01,5,Probably the most delicious delivery food I have ever had! i am gluten free and was searching for a place i could get takeout/delivery that had a variety of options for me other than a stupid salad. I found the food delicious, warm, and filling. It was exactly what i needed. I got the brussell sprouts, the GF chocolate chip cookie sandwich , sweet chilli wings, and GF turkey meatballs with melted mozzarella cheese. Holy Smokes! I ate it all! so freaking good! Will end up being my go to Delivery spot! Highly recommend!
2019-02-24,4,Delivery, so take it w a grain of salt.Loved that they have the impossible burger and very nice selection of greens to compliment. I like to eat lots of greens/veggies so always on the look out for satiating dishes w high protein and green veggie options. Loved that they have a decent selection of veg options, which is rare for hoboken. Give a try, you won't be disappointed.
2019-02-13,5,We had a great Valentine's dinner here. The food was delicious and our server Ashley was the best!
2019-02-12,5,Good beer selection, wholesome food options at fair prices and the friendliest bartenders in Hoboken.
2019-01-21,5,I love this place. It's a wonderful neighborhood bar and grill that offers clean eats with an amazing staff. It is one of my favorite places in town by far. They change up their menus according to the seasons as well as their specialty drink menu. If you're looking for a solid variety of food and drinks with a fun vibe and excellent service, check it out.
2019-01-18,3,Thank you very much for replying Marc, I appreciate the professionalism as a business owner. While I was extremely upset, my review tended to be out of the moment and stewed throughout the weekend. I'm not here to throw people under the bus as people have a living to make, and everyone has a bad day, which I've fallen victim to myself. I get bartenders have hectic shifts and can become overwhelmed, but I felt purposely ignored and caught attitude on a few occasions. I admit to being a bit harsh with my words, which I apologize for btw. Your professionalism goes a long way and I appreciate you reaching out, and without getting anyone in particular in trouble, I'd maybe urge them that their attitude also goes a long way. Other than that, you own a fine establishment.
2019-01-17,5,This place has it all. Great beer selection, yummy food, great vibe, nice staff. Its our to go spot whenever we want to hang out! We fell in love with Northern Soul on a sunday we were looking for a place to watch football and havent stopped going Ever since
2019-01-06,1,This place smelt as soon as I walked in.  The old Northern soul (being a Hoboken resident) was one of my fav spots! They always had/allowed dogs inside.  I bring my 6 pound SERVICE dog in and get attacked.  As soon as I walked in a waitress claimed her manager told her I had to leave, I explained my dog is a service dog and she walks away.  A few seconds later we sit down and the manager comes over and tells us we need to leave!  Does not bother to ask if my dog is a service dog. I explain and he has NO IDEA what I just explained and what a service dog is.  The uneducated asshole just gasp we have to leave bc he serves food.  I happily left (bc it smelt and other party I was wanted to go too) letting him know he was discriminating against people with disabilities. Just for those who aren't educated, when someone has a dog in a public setting such as a restaurant you are permitted by the ADA to ask two questions.  Do you have a disability, not what is ur disability,  and what service does your dog do for you. Neither of these questions were asked and I was refused service bc I have a disability. I will never step foot in this place again and I suggest you all do the same.I called and asked to speak to the owner and got a Guy named Mark claiming to be the owner.  He also claimed he has a service dog.  I asked what the two questions legally are allowed to be asked.  He did not know,  called me rude. I called him a piece of shit and uneducated bc now not only does he not know the law, but he mocked my disability by saying he has a disability himself. ( he clearly does not). When I called him a pos, he then went on to say clearly there is something wrong with me continuing to mock me for having a disability. It clearly states in the ADA law that a restaurant can't ask me to leave bc of my service dog. If Mark is not in fact the owner, and the owner would like to come forward and be a decent human being,  I suggest you do so. If Mark is the owner, this female with a disability is not weak and will not stand for your ignorance.Update: owner sent long email back but let's start with his judgmental statement to start about my disability he has NO idea about.         "My name is Marc and I'm the owner of Northern Soul. So I was hesitant to respond to your barrage of insults as its painfully clear what disability you suffer from," oh is it painfully clear?!  What is my disability Marc,  I'm painfully waiting to know what you know?!  To say this guy is discriminating is being polite.  He goes on and about how I was rude and he has dogs who help children.  Great, cool,  what does this have to do with me being refused service? He claims I was rude and that's why I was refused.  Ummm I was rude because I was told there's a kitchen, no dogs are allowed, period.  I had a friend with me who I asked after if I was out of line, she told me she thought I stayed calm for what was happening!  She would tell me if I over reacted!  So my disability is painfully clear?!  What is it Marc? Please educate me!  Still waiting on those two legally allowed questioned I should've been asked too.  I won't hold my breath. I went on to have an amazing brunch at Zach's where my dog sat on my lap at the bar, and everyone greeted us smiling. It was a lovely brunch as I always have everywhere, except Northern Soul where I was refused service, for my disability that apparently is painfully obvious.
2019-01-06,5,One of the best menus in Hoboken.   Have brought a lot of visitors here because of its many options, gluten free, vegan, and food that satisfies my extremely picky husband.  Everyone has been really happy with their choices, and def reasonably priced.
2018-12-30,4,This is a solid Irish Bar, with an exceptional Bloody Mary bit a bit average menu.  We're never dissatisfied with a meal but rarely blown away.  Best thing I've eaten here is their bacon apple grilled cheese.  Always a good pint of Guinness.I miss the old location with the loud music and dog friendly atmosphere. That said this will continue to be a staple in the rotation with the friendly staff and good local
2018-12-28,2,I want to like it here so much but I just can't. The people who work here are just not interested in being welcoming or efficient. The food here is really good, though. You'll have to wait about 30 minutes or so for it...even if it's completely empty in the restaurant...even if you're the only table and you ordered overnight oats and eggs... if the staff made any effort at all to be nice to the customers I would recommend eating here. Sadly, I would not recommend it unless you live very close, don't mind waiting and don't care about being treated like a patron. Sorry.Post response-Thank you so much for the response. No one ordered beer. We were the only people in the restaurant and only ordered food and it was still a ridiculous wait and very cold/poor service. Thank you again for the response.
2018-11-25,5,I discovered Northern Soul early this year and my husband and I were delighted with the atmosphere, the food (lots of gluten free and vegan choices) and the drinks (great margaritas). I noticed people having parties there and impulsively decided to throw my big 5-0 or as I called my big 0-5, a silly princess themed party, which happened last weekend. The party was FABULOUS!!! The staff was so great, nobody ever had an empty drink and the food was continually replenished. There are different rates for food and drink, you can pick your own hours for your event and they totally made me and friends/family feel special. I highly recommend Northern Soul, whether you want a meal, drinks or throw your own silly party for any occasion, this is the place to do it. Thank you Northern Soul, I love you!
2018-11-11,1,Took over 2 hours for deliver. Food was cold. Had to call multiple times. There are plenty of other options in hoboken that deliver on time
2018-10-13,5,I get uber eats from here all the time. Reasonable prices for Hoboken. I love their sandwiches. I always get one of the sautéed vegetables for the side (EVERY MEAL COMES WITH AN AMAZING CHOICE FROM A VARIETY OF FANTASTIC SIDES.) Any steamed vegetables aren't seasoned at all which is good for people on low sodium diets but I personally prefer their sautéed vegetables because they are FLAVOR BLASTIN' and perfectly cooked. I just think it's so hard to find healthy/relatively low calorie meals that are still really satisfying and a great dinner after a long day at work. Highly recommend this place to anyone who doesn't wanna be a fatty but still eat food that doesn't make them miserable.
2018-10-05,4,Solid 4 stars--maybe five soon, but I'll have to try it out again. Great vegetarian options with an Impossible burger on menu! The buffalo cauliflower was great--good kick of spice and crunch. The pieces we got were a bit big, but otherwise fine. They have a great beer list with rotating seasonal drafts. The staff was friendly and they have a pool table and TVs, which are all good for a relaxed night out. I hear they have live music, which will be the clincher for that five star!
2018-09-18,2,I ordered a burger for delivery from here multiple times and it was usually good, but recently my burgers have been very undercooked. The first time this happened I ordered my burger medium well and it came as medium raw at best, it was very pink on the inside. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and was willing to try them again, but the next time I ordered from them (this time well done, just in case it was undercooked again) it came very pink on the inside, even more than the first burger. As much as I liked their food in the past, selling undercooked burgers multiple times is unacceptable. I can't even imagine how a well done burger can come out as medium raw, it's as if they didn't even look at how I wanted my burger cooked. Unacceptable.
2018-09-13,5,I was in town for a meeting - in Hoboken for the night and was looking for a bar with great food and live music... and found it!   It was live mic night and the performers were crazy talented!  Ashley is an awesome server and recommended a delicious meal - francais Chicken with asparagus and tomatoes.  It was tasty and somewhat healthy... lots of good beer choices - and settled on a local dbl IPA. I met some good people and look forward to coming back!
2018-08-25,5,There's so much to say about NoSo, but I'll make it brief since I only have so many characters...The ambiance is an amazingly unique blend of eclectic tunes and modern art. The staff (especially Donal & Seamus) are so friendly and engaging - they can almost predict your perfect drink before you order it. The food is incredibly satisfying, whether it's a quick late night bite or an intimate Sunday brunch with the girls gossiping over the happenings of last week. 5/5 perfect star rating for the best spot in hobo. This town may be sinking, but NoSo is keeping the only idiosyncratic vibe left alive.
2018-08-09,5,After having a double cheese burger and impossible burger, had to come back and update my review.5 stars across the board, the double was cooked to a solid medium and super tasty.The impossible burger was delicious, my first time having it and was not disappointed.NoSo also delivers late which is clutch if your craving some healthy munchies.
2018-07-26,5,It's puppy friendly~~!!! Really loved/ enjoyed brunch at this cozy place. My friend and I who were walking our pups were just passing by and weren't sure if our pets would be allowed to sit for brunch in the patio. The waitress was very nice and cordial to our furry buddies. As we seated, she brought them bowls of fresh water!! I ordered a medium well burger and my friend got sunny side up eggs and ham with a side of mix fruits. Food was great but service was even better! I'd definitely recommend and will most definitely visit again soon!
2018-07-07,5,We had my daughters HS graduation party at Northern Soul. What a great restaurant! The service was fantastic. Diana accommodated all of our requests without hesitation. She worked hard to make us happy. Our server Rosa was wonderful too! We picked out several different platters of food and everything was delicious! The specialty cocktails and variety of beers were all so yummy. The space is very charming and comfortable. I highly recommend NoSo for a party, great food and drinks with a super friendly atmosphere!
2018-07-05,3,I really liked my sandwich, I would have eaten two if it were in front of me. I had the grilled apple with cheddar sandwich with a side of cauliflower. What brought down my rating was that I did not like the children's menu items. We ordered my 3yo toddler a grilled cheese as well as the pizza and it could have been way better. For whatever reason he was scraping off the cheese from the grilled cheese... Perhaps it was American cheese product and not real cheese :-) Maybe kids have a sixth sense of what's not real food these days... Later on he was so hungry he was picking off the bread from the cheese... But he did eat the slices of green apple that was on the side of the plate. As for the personal kids pizza, it tasted like freezer Pizza. They should upgrade the cheese on the kids grilled cheese to something an adult will eat and mimic what they probably would make for the adults flatbread appetizer for a child. If I wouldn't eat it, I wouldn't want to give it to my kids. Next time I think I will order the adult flatbread appetizer for my son. Please  up the ingredients on the kids menu.
2018-06-29,2,Terrible all around!  Food was okay... service was slow and they got our wrong on multiple fronts. Charged us for their mistakes. Just bad. Will not be back.
2018-06-20,2,I was a fan of the old Northern Soul and their open mic nights. Just learned they had reopened. Before I walked in I Really wanted to give them 5 Stars for open mic night. Walked in on a June, warm night. Unfortunately they were not running the air conditioning much and it was uncomfortably warm inside. Went to the bar but despite it not being busy the bar tender never came over and I could not get his attention. After a while spoke to a passing waitress who seated me near the music. She was very nice but as the lone waitress on duty seemed overwhelmed. Was only able to get a wine refill by flagging her down. She was very busy and didn't return on her own to see how I was doing. I though 'I could skip out and no one would notice until closing'. But I'm not that type of person. I ordered the Chicken Francais daily special. Can't recommend it. First off, inexplicably there was a bone fragment in the spinach which I bit down on. Ouch !The chicken was like eating a stick of butter. That was the only taste. Open mic was good !  Inside an 'old' barrel. Talent of varying levels but in hoboken there will always be amazing talent at an open mic. Management would benefit by providing more chairs  or something more in support of open mic nite I will come back periodically in the hopes the place and (different) food improves, because I want them to succeed.Addendum:After an hour or so the waitress did come back to check on me
2018-06-15,5,As one of the Hobokenites.  I love going out and finding new restaurants.  I decided to goto NoSo on Monday night and was blown away.  All the food there is affordable and delicious.  They have gotten my side orders wrong a couple of times and wasn't upset about it because the food is hands down amazing.  From the different array of food choices they have healthy alternatives.  I am a meat lover but absolutely adore the buffalo cauliflower.  If you want a great place to hand out, with good company and of course food.  Look no further then the Northern Soul.
2018-05-28,5,This place is my new fav spot in Hoboken! (And luckily right near my friend's apartment.) The inside is super artsy and cute with paintings for sale all around. They actually have branded women's, men's and baby's clothing for purchase as well! The bar is very large and they have some high top seating around that. They have a pool table and dart board. There's also a leather couch lounge section you can hang out in. The food was SO GOOD. I had Brussels sprouts which were yummy but very small portion and the butternut squash lentil salad with salmon. I highly recommend the salmon salad I tried, squash and salmon cooked perfectly Our bartender was very sweet but was inattentive at times which is understandable bc she was taking care of a larger rowdy group of guys at the other end of the bar. I want to go back and try more!
2018-05-10,5,Friendly staffs, good drinks, affordable place in the neighborhood.  Good to house large party with reasonable rate.  The owner provided us mutliple options to meet our requests for my son's upcoming birthday party.  I do wish that they could've offered truffle fries or tots.  I will take what they have though
2018-03-27,4,Place has a cool vibe and more importantly...they are furries friendly. A few of my friends came in character to pregame for Nyc Furry con and had ffun with the juke box. it wasn't easy drinking beer through my furry trunk though.
2018-03-07,5,My experience with northern soul is because of an event - my son's birthday. Donal and his team were on point with everything, and the service for drinks and food was excellent. Special mention about the food as we had a few vegetarians among us and everyone was really happy with the food ( buffalo cauliflower- here's looking at you kid). Overall it was nice to work with a venue that was laid-back but very professional with great attention to detail. I would highly recommend it to anyone in the Hoboken/weehawken/ West New York areas for their next big event.
2018-02-25,4,Update:  went back recently- bartenders still friendly and attentive. Menu has improved- got the salad with salmon and it was ready quickly and really delicious. It was lively enough to be fun but not so packed that it was obnoxious. Good crowd. I'm looking forward to going back again. Cool vibe and friendly servers/quick drinks. Unfortunately the menu needs work- both in variety and quality. Would try again perhaps but in no rush to do so.
2018-02-23,5,Perfect for brunch or after-work drinks. The staff is very friendly as well. Order the buffalo cauliflower, it's delicious!
2018-01-15,5,My husband and I moved to Hoboken 4 years ago, our first night out was at the original Northern Soul! We went to the new location last night. The people, atmosphere, food, did not disappoint. Great food options, great staff, all around good place.
2018-01-04,3,I really wanted to love this place. Staff was friendly, lighting was on the darker side, great music. We order the skirt steak sandwich with fries and the chicken cutlet sandwich with sweet potato fries. The chicken sandwiches advertised and either grilled chicken or chicken cutlet with roasted tomatoes and basil oil. I was given an over cooked cutlet between two pieces of tough bread with motz  cheese.  My side salad was tossed lightly with a delicious vinaigrette. My favorite part of the meal by far. My sweet potato fries were burnt and had no flavor. Unimpressed unfortunately. Great bar. Not great for food.
2017-11-29,4,Love NoSo! This is such a great chilled out place to hang out with your friend, date night or in a large group! We've done all of the above and had a GREAT time, every single time! 1) Celebrated my husband's 40th here with a large group of friende. Ask for Donal. He will make the whole thing seamless and everyone will have a good time! Get your own cake and they will help cut and distribute. We ordered off the menu and couldn't be happier. 2) Came here multiple times for brunch with husband, friends and infant twins and they have been SO accommodating  - with strollers, weird baby requests and everything in between! Honestly, we keep coming  back because they are so nice! 3) The food - staple... some dishes are better than the rest. My go to is the avocado toast and the grilled cheese (without bacon). The salmon avocado BLT is good too. Please add more vegetarian choices! :) 4) Parking is validated. Let's keep NoSo going! We need more spacious neighborhood bars like this!
2017-11-20,1,Update: I've been back three times since I wrote my first review and this place has lost a star each time. The service has gone down hill and the place has seating issues. It's become less of a nice place to eat (especially inside in winter) and more of a crusty bar.  North Soul's focus on healthy and sustainable food, makes it a "feel good, taste good" place to eat. The fig jam and apple grilled cheese sandwich on raisin bread was mind blowing! It's great that they have healthy sides like steamed broccoli and sautéed spinach to balance out more decadent meal choices. This restaurant is ahead of the curve in its offer of fresh vegetable-centric dishes, vegan, and gluten free options, in addition to classic meat and fish dishes like hamburgers, chicken, steak and salmon. I'm looking forward to going back for brunch and trying the gluten free waffle with another frosé cocktail. Everyone I ate with enjoyed their dinner and the service. Although off the beaten path, this is one of the better, more evolved restaurants in Hoboken.
2017-11-19,3,Oh how I miss my Northern Soul of old. Today we turned up for brunch to find at least 10 strollers parked outside. Parked.  Strollers. I loved Northern Soul for its adult atmosphere, even at midday on a Sunday. Pool Table (without kiddies running about). Good food.  Good booze. No kiddie menu. An adult bar. At night it's still good, but during the weekends during the day, you will think you are in Park Slope. Sigh.
2017-10-27,5,Really good vibes here. The staff is very helpful and friendly. There's live music, photo booths, pool tables, and MOST IMPORTANTLY reallllly gooood fooooddd. Must try: buffalo cauliflower and salmon BLT. Also delicious: wings and all the veggie sides. Overall the menu is veggie-centric, health conscious, and vegan friendly. And I mean all of those things in the best way possible: not bland, all delicious, very fresh.
2017-10-18,5,Love the atmosphere and most importantly the food! So many things to try and relatively healthy options like the buffalo cauliflower and salmon blt. Dessert options so good its hard to pick one. They offer free parking which is pretty awesome in Hoboken otherwise hard to find!
2017-09-27,5,We live across the street and love Northern Soul!! It was so sad when they closed the original location but now they are even closer. The bartenders and waitresses are so friendly. Don't miss out on some of their amazing dishes, my personal favorite is the buffalo cauliflower. Stop it and check it out!
2017-09-16,5,Just had my daughter's birthday party there for 15 people and they were super accommodating with everything from the menu, drinks to the seating arrangement.  We sat outside and they gave us our own little corner.  The food was great too!  They have validated parking which was perfect for family that didn't live in the area.  My guests loved the experience and we all agreed we'd be coming back.
2017-08-26,4,Validated parking for the win! Pretty much a hipper version of a sports bar with loads of TV's and gastro pub fare. I did have a mind blowing Gluten Free Vegan burger. The bartenders and locals are always friendly and offer suggestions of things to do and see in the area. The bathrooms are nice enough to be noted!
2017-08-21,4,The moment you walk in you get a vibe of an actual pub with a twist of fine dinning. I was never a guy for fine dinning there for I head straight for the bar area. The bartender was really nice and knew his drinks and I'm always up for a good time and good jokes, and the people the tend to visit that place seem to become costume with everybody since it's a very calm and outgoing type of setting. They have a pool table and darts, and if you need a private area to spend time with your friends or on a date, they also have a closed dinning area for those special nights. However they seem to be on and off about the food menu. The food is delicious but not consistent.
2017-08-13,5,Place has great food. The bartenders are always great, and the customer service is always top notch. The wings are phenomenal and have a fantastic BBQ sauce to go along with it. I've also got their skirt steak & salads and nothing has disappointed yet. They also deliver. I like that. All in all a more than quality place!
2017-07-25,4,The neighborhood needs this place. Very chill atmosphere, with a patio that allows dogs. I've only had snack foods like the fries here but definitely plan to come again. Staff is very nice and friendly.
2017-06-21,5,So I ordered from this lovely place off uber eats I purchased the Salmon with garlicky kale and citrus quinoa  and all I can say is WOW this was by far the best salmon I've had around town listen the whole dish was amazing and I guarantee if you like kale quinoa and salmon this is going to be your fav I'm in love the flavors are amazing the salmon has this thin layer of crisp with a juicy flavorful inside breath taking I can't even seriously !!!
2017-06-17,5,Held a surprise birthday party for my sister there one Saturday afternoon. From the beginning, the staff was very responsive to emails, friendly, and very accommodating of our group (30+, including children). The food was great, cocktails were amazing, and the beer was cold. The wait staff and bartenders went out of their way to make us feel at home. Easy to get to, parking garage (with 3 hours free!) right next door, and excellent space for a party. Modern, clean, bright, spacious. Very highly recommended for a private party, to watch a game, or just to hang out and have a good time and good food/drinks. Cheers to Marc, Donal, and the rest of the Northern Soul team!
2017-06-09,1,Don't believe everything you read..The place is super boring, dead vibe, the one pool table is hawked by a crowed of kids. No live musicSuper slow serviceVery limited menuWe couldn't finish our one drink fast enough. By the way. This 'amazing service' everyone talks about is non existent. We weren't many people sitting at the bar, and it took them a while to take our order. Once they did tho the drinks came out fast. In shot, super boring place, tiny menu (unless ur a vegan), no live music and slow service. Two thumbs down.
2017-05-24,5,I decided to have my 30th birthday at Northern Soul and could not say enough good things about it. The staff was AMAZING and our group had a great time. We had our party in the barrel room for no charge for the space and we were able to drop off decorations prior to the start time and the staff even helped set up. They had drink deals for us and a server that was incredibly attentive to our party. We also had food for the group that was super reasonable and delicious. Highly recommend as a party space or just a night out!
2017-05-21,5,Fun and familiar... The old place was dark, and unwelcoming, but this spot is totally different... Same amazing people, but better atmosphere! Food is tasty and affordable... I luv that I can go with my friends who have kids and it's no uncomfortable. All are welcomed.
2017-04-27,5,So I never write yelp reviews, but I was extremely pleasantly surprised when I came here for dinner and drinks with my girlfriend. The food was very good, server was super friendly, and the vibe was pretty laid back (granted we came on a Thursday so I can't speak on the weekends.) I will definitely be back again.
2017-04-12,5,LOVE the (new) Northern Soul reincarnate -- friendly staff, great beer, awesome food (kale Caesar was delish!) They have indoor/ outdoor seating, a pool table and lots of space to mix&mingle. They're also super kid friendly and my (picky) kids engulfed their dinners. So happy to have #noso back in the hood!!
2017-04-11,5,Northern Soul is like the 'Cheers' of Hoboken.  You will always bump into someone and have a great time.  I had my boyfriends surprise party here this past weekend and Northern Soul was very accommodating.  They made sure it was a birthday to remember.  They allowed us to rent out a cool room with couches and a TV and we had a great staff being very hospitable to my guests.  I recommend this place for any event or just to have a few drinks with friends.
2017-02-25,3,the food was really good, the service could have been better. my friends ordered from the kids menu and got the food, only to get a check to only indicate regular prices. when they asked the manager, he said "well you guys aren't kids." after some talk he let my friends pay the kids' menu price. all in all we have no complaints about the food, the service could have been friendlier is all.
2017-02-12,5,You should really stop reading this and head over to Northern Soul (1st & Harrison), NOW.  This is hands down one of the top restaurants/ bars in the area. Seriously...  Your missing out if you haven't tried them.  I've eaten here a few times now, each time I walk away impressed with the food, service, atmosphere, and the quality of people who operate Northern Soul.   The owners Mark and Donal have taken Northern Soul to another level that other establishments can only hope to attain.  FOODThis isn't your traditional bar food menu.  The head chef Sean has put together an impressive assortment of dishes that set this place apart from other restaurants in Hoboken. Your getting quality in everything you order. Brunch?? Yup they do it and do it really well.  I think a few of my friends say they found a new weekend spot. Lunch/ Dinner?  Yes please. The food is to die for.  I can't wait to try some of the other creations on their menu.  But let me see if I can give a little insight into what my friends and I have tried. * Burger - they've mastered the American classic. Their burger is almost Shake Shack-esk in likeness but honestly better.  Yup * Veggie Burger - fresh and full of flavor.  A vegetarian with my party said its one of the best veggie burgers she's had. * Corn Beef Hash Eggs Benedict - this creation is simply amazing.  It taste better then it sounds. Corn beef cakes act as pillows for the poached eggs that are covered in a buttery Hollander sauce.* Grilled Chicken Sandwich - an artisan approach that really makes this worthwhile. * Monte Cristo French Toast Sandwich - sweet and salty...  Kids will actually behave to get a taste of this. * Fries - hand cut, crunchy, not over salted.  Just what you expect when you place the order. * Vanilla Waffle - comes with a massive side of fresh fruit. The waffle is cooked perfectly, light and fluffy.* Bloody Mary - in our party all the old ladies that are impossible to impress were raving about the drink.   ATMOSPHERE * Clean - this is a place you can take your kids and not worry about needing a tetanus shot after.  There is no bar smell or musty odor.  The staff does a great job at keeping this place clean. * Seating - they have a booth area for families with kids, which makes life so much easier. They have traditional tables and seats but also have taller tables in the bar area.  What's really neat is the back room which has couches you can sit and eat if your trying to accommodate a larger group. * They do have TVs in the bar if you want to watch the game.  However the dinning area doesn't feel like a bar.  They've done a great job at creating separation with the bar and the dinning patrons. EVENT SPACE / PARTYS* These guys are incredible to work with; very accommodating for any type of party you're looking to put together. * We had a 1-year-old birthday there with 50+ guests and they made the planning and set up process so easy. * They handled the families and kids really well.  In fact they have a healthy kids menu, which makes moms lives a little easier.  * Moms with small kids, guess what... They even have a changer in the women's bathroom. * For the larger parties they're able to put together a menu of items you want served. * Open Bar - to make life easy we set up an open bar with bracelets. Worked out so well.   MUSIC * JAMES  CALLEO - you need to hire this guy for any event. * He did a 2+ hour acoustic set and wowed every single person. Worth every penny, in fact I paid more then he charged because I was so impressed.* He can play all types of music * We gave him 15 songs the night before and he had them down for the party the next day. * I think he walked away with 2 or 3 more gigs from other folks at the party. * facebook.com/jamescalleo...* youtube.com/watch?v=2MAv...
2016-12-31,4,Welcome back to the neighborhood Northern Soul! In its new location, they have adjusted to the area and venue that they moved into, which means they now have food, but will likely have to have less live music into the wee hours since it is located in a residential building. In fact, when I was there on a Friday night we were just listening to whatever music was pumping through the system, no classic live music. While they have a lot to still work on, I won't judge on that since they are still working on getting to 100% open (i.e. the jukebox isn't working yet since they are waiting for a part, the self-serve wine bar they advertised has yet to happen, and they are still feeling out the layout of the space). They are also still working on service, etc, it was a bit spotty , but all in due time. Lots of the originals are back so it is cool to see some friendly faces from the former location. They brought several things with them, including the pool table, which is a great use of that space. They also cut and pushed back the bar from the other place that was there before them, which was the smartest thing they could have done. They now have a Photo Booth which cost $3 for a strip photos, but I would recommend skipping it since the zoom is set so close to your face, that thats about all that fits in the frame. Havent tried the food, but the menu is set on classic bar food scaled up a tiny bit (i.e. kale salads and burgers) and is mid-range cost wise. Its semi-obvious that they took over what was a french restaurant (i.e. the chairs and bistro tables were from that place) and the layout is odd for what you think of when you think of what NoSo used to be set up like, but I look forward to see how else they will transform the place. Best of luck!
2016-12-23,5,The service and atmosphere are great. It has a pool table. bar..music and for those who love sports they have 3 screens. Chicken sandwich and burger both delish! The soul sauce is everything!
