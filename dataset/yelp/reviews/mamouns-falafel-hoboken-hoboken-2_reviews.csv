2021-10-25,5,Long overdue review!  I've had mamouns in the city years and years ago and the Hoboken location is awesome!  Consistently delicious.  A little pricey but not outrageous for hoboken.  Any of their plates will keep you full all day.  They must've updated their online order system (this is in response to the other review saying they don't know when their order is ready).  I placed an order online and I got a text when it was ready!
2021-09-28,4,I always forget to take pics since I'm always devouring it as soon as it gets here haha. You kind of have to because if you get a pita sandwich it is sadly falling apart & getting soggy/cold by the time it gets here! I had the "West 4th" sandwich yesterday (which has shawarma and hummus in it) and it was really disintegrating when it arrived--but still tasty! I also got the combo plate with falafel, babaganoush, & stuffed grape leaves over rice. I really liked all of those except for the rice (it was just ok, but there was a lot of it, I would rather have the 3 chosen items & not so much filler)! For a drink I had the mint lemonade which was pretty good. In the past from this location I've had the shawarma in a pita as well as the tamarind & mango drinks, which were really good! I've of course also made visits to the Mamouns in NYC (who hasn't, it's a staple)!
2021-09-23,5,Yesterday I had Lunch at the Mamoun's Falafel Hoboken Location. I had the falafel sandwich and their season fries and overall the food is really good.
2021-08-31,5,Food is fresh and delicious. People are kind and willing to help anytime. The place is clean. I like that they are using less plastic. Excellent service!
2021-08-23,5,Born in New York City, Mamoun's Falafel has blossomed into a chain restaurant bringing Middle Eastern cuisine to locations all over the East Coast. The menu here was simple and compact, and my pick was the falafel plate, which came with seven herbaceous falafel balls served over a simple salad of lettuce, tomatoes, onions, herbs, olives, pickled radishes, and black pepper. The plate came with a tahini sauce on the side, which acted as the perfect dressing for the salad and dip for the falafels. I also got a side of their tabbouleh, a chewy and nutty mixture of bulgur and parsley, and their thick, creamy hummus, which was perfect for dipping with the falafels and the thin, chewy pita bread that came on the side. One last item from here worth mentioning was Mamoun's hot sauce, which had a particularly peppery, spicy flavor that added quite a lot of heat to every bite!
2021-08-20,5,Ordered a shawarma sandwich, side of rice, side of falafel and a baklava. It was incredible and travels well.
2021-08-20,5,One of the best turkey kababs I've had in the US. Probably the closest one to the real deal. We ordered the Sullivan (chicken kabab & hummus) and mcdougal ( lamb & falafel). Yummmmm
2021-08-19,5,I'm a regular. Reliably delicious. Always tastes fresh. I usually get the classic falafel sandwich so it's a great veggie option. I've never had a problem with service. Desserts are amazing.
2021-08-14,3,Overhyped for a falafel place Price is good, but the quality of Falafel is mediocre - not sure what the hype is really about
2021-08-10,2,Nothing like the Mamoun's in the east village. Bland bland bland, ordered a shawarma and falafel sandwich and couldn't even eat the meat - it was dry and flavorless. I was so sad and disappointed. Toppings didn't taste like anything and by the time I bit into the sandwich everything was soggy. Not coming back.
2021-08-09,4,Food - GreatStaff - Not very attentiveI placed online order and went for pick up. They have a pick up place but they never keep the orders their - how would you know the food is ready if you cannot read the names on the bag. They prepared my order and kept it behind the Pick Up point even though  I was waiting for my order. After good 10 mins I again went to the staff to check on my food - it is then she gave me my food. They did not update the status for online order that the food was ready for pick up even though they mention that you can track the status using delivery.comI order Chicken and Falafel Sandwich - awesome. No complaints on the quantity or quality of food. The red sauce is HOTT..
2021-07-31,4,Nice dining place with simple interiors. Excellent food quality, and fast service. Deserts are ok.
2021-07-14,5,Love this place! Their sandwiches are delicious and filled perfectly. A little expensive for the quantity but the quality is great and taste is awesome!
2021-06-29,4,One of the best places in and around NJ/NY for falafel. They stand by their name and in my opinion falafel is their star dish along with Baba Ghanouj & Hummus.Wide variety of options and till date none of those disappointed us including their desserts. Shawarma is beautifully seasoned and cooked to perfection. I'm a great fan of their meat combo plates. Go there and you wouldn't be disappointed!!!
2021-06-28,5,A go to for a quick bite. I love the classic vegetarian pita with hummus and falafel. It is not quite a full meal, so I would recommend adding the fries which are delicious with the garlic dip.
2021-06-24,4,Took out food from Mamoun's for movie night in the park! Service was quick and the people were so nice! The Shawarma Plate was an awesome amount of food for the price! We also got stuffed Grape Leaves and Baba Ganoush with fresh pita bread! The perfect meal! Also, don't miss the baklava! The pieces are huge and so delicious! Next time I'll ask for extra sauce on the plate and go easy on adding the hot sauce, it's very spicy! Will definitely be going back!
2021-06-22,5,After my friend told me about Mamoun's - I've literally fallen in love. Everything is so flavorful, reasonably priced, and just makes your soul warm up! One of my favorites has been their hummus - I feel like I could eat it like for the rest of my life and never get tired of it! It's always an addition to my orderI'm not even a vegetarian but I LOVE their West Village Falafel Sandwich. Literally my go to every time (even though I keep telling myself I'm going to try other stuff on their amazing menu)Go check them out in any of their locations - your stomach will love you for it and I'm sure you're gonna fall in love
2021-06-08,1,The food was horrible and expensive and all the sandwich only had more  cheap lettuce than meat  three pieces of lamb and three pieces of chicken and the falafel was horrible black and was smelly and oily  on be
2021-06-07,5,Nice restaurant great location and good food .In fact I like them more than the one in New York on St. Mark's street
2021-05-16,5,An all-time. Hoboken favorite. Amazing set of sandwiches and the best is the falafel classic sandwich on the pita. Loved their Kanafeh.
2021-05-09,3,Ordered the West 4th sandwich. Tasted okay, but the bread was almost freezing cold and soggy at the bottom. Falafel was good.
2021-03-25,1,It feels like every-time i order from this place they screw up my  order. Explicitly ordered a side of pickles, sauce. All missing. Even the portions are diminishing. Be prepared to have bland sandwich when you order it on side
2021-03-17,5,Consistently delicious. A lunchtime stalwart. We've been going to the Hoboken spot for years now. Used to be on 5th Street, now is on 3rd. Nice menu, with wide ranging choices. Back then, great, friendly service. Just ordered online: easy to order, quick delivery, excellent food. One of the best falafel I have ever had. Top choice.
2021-02-27,5,Delicious every single time. I love the West 4th sandwich!!! If you like lamb, try the west 4th out. The falafel is very good as well. I'd skip on the chicken as it is not as flavorful.
2021-02-13,1,Ordered vegetarian falafel platter over rice and falafel sandwich in Feb '21. After 2 bites from the falafel platter FOUND A PIECE OF MEAT IN SUPPOSEDLY VEGETARIAN FALAFEL PLATTER and immediately stop eating all food since we have dietary restrictions. Waste of money and time driving from Jersey city.
2021-01-28,5,Awesome experience. Went for pick up, seemed safe / no concerns re: Covid.Food was prepared very quickly.Food was delicious, had the shawarma and McDouglas. The pita bread is fresh and soft, the lamb was seasoned to perfection and perfectly combined with the rest of the ingredients. I highly recommend
2021-01-26,5,I might order from here too often, honestly. It's consistently fantastic. Whenever we get delivery, it's very fast service and the food is always still hot. I usually get the shawarma wrap but have tried the platter before. The platter is more bang for your buck. My fianceÃÅ is Lebanese and falafel always makes him happy  One of my favorite restaurants for take-out in all of Hoboken.
2021-01-20,5,I am from Dubai so for me to give this place a 5 star is a big deal! As soon as we moved to Jersey City we had so many of our friends telling us to check this place out. I was also recommended by a random Uber driver so I had to check it out. Tip: we were having difficulty using a 3rd party service to order online so we directly called the Hoboken location and we were in their free delivery radius which was awesome! Recommend ordering the classic falafel and hummus sandwich and the west 4th! The hot sauce is real hot but so good. We ordered side of hummus which is what really reminded me of home :)
2021-01-11,3,Mamoun's for a long time was my comfort take out option. Worth the buck, filling sandwiches with decent vegetarian options. The falafels are flavorful, but not the best I had. My suggestion is do not try the baklava as they are often not fresh.
2021-01-11,1,On Jan 11 2020 my boyfriend and his friend went to get food at this location. My boyfriend wanted a cookie out of the case so he pointed at the cookie touching the glass case. The cashier (Anne) said "bruh stop touching the case that's the second time you touched it every time you touch I have to clean it" Now  after finishing the food he asked the cashier what was her issue and why was she so rude. To which she replied " you're a dumbass nigga" and "you're not even a customer because your friend paid for the food"I called this morning to speak with management in reference to this experience and got someone named Marie I explained to her the situation and her response was that she saw the video and that Ann didn't say ****er but instead nigga which made it not racist. In educating Marie defending her coworker in how inappropriate it was to call a black man a nigga or any derogatory name regardless if he touched the case or not was unacceptable.Ann's attitude was unwarranted and unprovoked and Marie's excuse for the behavior speaks to their management. After I educated Marie on her ignorance she got pissed off and said she wasn't going to be disrespected I replied "I wasn't disrespecting I was simply educating you on your ignorance" and her was response was "come in the store and check me"Now after she invited me to come in the store as a challenge she had Hoboken police contact my boyfriend and say that he is harassing them. Could you imagine in this day and time this is the behavior of staff in a franchised establishment. To not only insult a black man for touching a glass but to then call the police after you say to come in to the store. Sad say I'm not surprised
2020-12-28,5,Hands down the best falafel I've ever tasted! Coming from the west coast, I didn't know what I was in for in terms of the falafel game on the east coast. But I now that I know, I always compare every falafel I have to Mamouns. Taste and texture are perfect and the way it comes together in a wrap is absolutely delicious. They also have a great tasting dolmas and fries!
2020-12-27,2,I ordered a falafel sandwich, it came thin squished falafel & a whole lot of lettuce. The soup was good, but I remember when you got pita bread w/ the soup, not anymore. We also tried to order a bunch of sides like baba ghanoush & hummus, but they were not available. Overall we were disappointed, this has been our go to for years, but they have gotten stingy as their prices went up.
2020-12-11,4,Always an immensely incredible dining experience overall with Mamoun's. You cannot go wrong with any Mamoun's chain. No matter where you go. Their ingredients are freshly prepared and cooked. Plenty of lettuce, onions, tomatoes, tahini white sauce, and their dreaded super spicy red chilli sauce to go around. Falafels are super crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. Shwarma (lamb), beef, and chicken gyro or platter are excellent! Plenty of meat pieces and rice. Affordable prices and relatively decent portion sizes for the money. Parking-wise, you are in downtown Hoboken so the parking is a bit tough to find here and there. You may be lucky when the timing is just right when someone backs out of a parking space, and you grab it! Otherwise, street parking with meters. Nonetheless, overall, food and quality/taste are excellent!
2020-11-25,5,I love you. Swarms ends crispy. Rice seasoned perfectly. Mother of god, the garlic sauce. I order a 6 ounce cup so I can set aside two ounces that I put in a shot glass and take back.
2020-11-21,5,Went there again and wanted to add how amazing yhe cashier girls are! We all couldn't decide and they gave us so much advice, told us their favourites, waited patiently! Such sweethearts! And everything they recommended tasted amazing. Good food+ good service
2020-10-16,1,If you get your food delivered from them, it will arrive cold and missing an item 8 out of 10 times.  Good luck.
2020-09-25,5,That boy Mamoun still spittin out fire like it's 96' on w4th street.For real, just as good as the city. Hot sauce is potent. White sauce has that healthy tahini kick to keep the locals (you know) happy. Thing is you need 2 pockets to fill up, do the falafel and shawarma.Is it homos or hummus? Either way it's fire habibi
2020-09-24,5,I know you hated my last review. I falafel about it. But this one will be better, hummus believe me.While it doesn't rock my world and blow me away and keep me running across the river the way it did at one point, this is still some of the best Middle Eastern food you will ever eat in your life. It's amazing and heavenly and very very well made, and the prices are still incredible, the way they were a long long time ago.What to get: Pita combo with Falafel and ShawarmaWhy this Mamoun's: Best service and best food of any locationWhenever I'm down Jersey wayThere's only one thing I can sayTo my b*tch (named Karma),"Let's go get Shawarma",And we eat Mamoun's every day!I think the best thing about my moons (I mean Mamouns) is the combination of all the different stuff they put in your pitas. We're talking about some of the best toppings imaginable for beautiful fluffy open pita bread (the only kind worth stuffing with anything really), and this is the kind of food that really blows me away.Our leadership system is brokenAnd our deepest fears all are unspokenBut when it comes to foodIt would be f*cking rudeTo not come to Mamoun's of Hoboken!Then there's also the excellent selections of lemonade and other exotic drinks - the mint lemonade is second to none. I'm a massive fan and you probably will be too when you come here and try this.If the employees thought my mother was a cow (they may do by now), it'd be Ma-moos.My best experiences of Mamoun's of Hoboken are when I leave Buffalo shortly before midnight, and then still manage to miraculously make it to this location before they close, which is 5am on Fri and Sat. Not a lot of people can do that drive in that time (and without even getting a ticket on that route, yet). Especially in bad weather. If Bart Simpson and Eric Cartman were regulars here (Eric is a regular everywhere), they'd be Ma-toons.I actually managed to roll in here by about 4.47am before a 5am close, after a 5-hour-high-speed drive from Buffalo. Not only did they serve me, but gave me a bunch of free stuff. Customer service was absolutely exemplary. Quite the opposite of that waitress in Syracuse. Mamoun's has some of the best customer service anywhere. Lovely guys. It rocked my world because after all that time on the road, you don't want to get there and find it's closed 15 minutes early, like many places do or would.If they sold digital songs whereby the artist got almost no profit, they'd be Ma-itunes.Hummus World (Long Island) was the best until it closed down. Mamoun's is the best that is still alive, it's exemplary and incomparably delicious. I pita the fool that disagrees. Get the shawarma and falafel combo in a pita. It's just $6.50 and stuff it with *everything*. When I say everything, I mean pickles, hummus, crazy flavourful bits n pieces of spiced veggies, drizzled with tahini. It comes together into an absolute miracle.If all the guys in here had a crush on me (or my Mum), they'd be Ma-Swoons.They do have other stuff like Kofte and Chicken. But I'm never able to stray from the tried and trusted Shawarma + Falafel combo in a Pita. It's so good.If you saw Tom Green's fave bird here, they'd be Ma-Loon's. And that's not very fun. When you always expose your bum. Or rather your Mum. Or rather she exposes her own Bum. Maybe it's where I get it from.In any case, I like to put my bum on things. It's fun for everyone.As well as the ridiculously low price (NYC area and yet 6.50 for a stuffed pita full of heaven), there's the added bonus of their hours. 5am on Fri and Sat, and 1, 2 or 3 on other nights. So you can come for breakfast if you're insane and up early. The MacDougal Manhattan location is open til 5am every night!If they closed at 12pm instead of 5am, they'd be Ma-noon's.Mamoun's is my favourite pita kebab in all of NY-NJ, and possibly in the USA.And I can't take my mother anywhere. I've driven her to Jersey on at least 666 occasions, and every time, she exposes her bottom to the staff. Some of them think it's gross, some think it's funny, and that one creepy hairy guy in the back seems to actually enjoy it a little bit too much, if his burly grunts are anything to go by. I don't know why my "Ma moons" them but what I do know is, it's become so famous here in Ho-boken, that they have renamed the restaurant after these predictable moonings, accordingly.When I bring her here, Barbie swoonsImagining the desert, the golden dunesAnd always dresses like the world's finest poonsWhenever I bring Barbie to Mamoun's.
2020-09-04,4,A very amazing place for very fresh mediterranean food. There's lots of options for vegetarians here, and I think that's great! Mamoun's has quality food at a reasonable price. With falafel in the name of the restaurant, of course I got a side of falafel with my shawarma sandwich!My friends got the chicken and rice dish, while I got what I stated above. Overall, the dishes were very delightful and light! Though this is not a place where you'd be full, if you want a balanced and healthy meal, this is a great place to get one!
2020-08-31,5,Can't believe I haven't reviews Mamoun's! My boyfriend and I stop in here quite often. The shawarma is my favorite!! It's delicious juicy hot lamb meat. So good! We get a side of it a lot.The salads are delicious too. I don't prefer iceberg but the olives, feta, dressing, grape leaf, and pickled veggies are great. The fresh pita bread that's baked daily is good too.My boyfriend loves the bleeker sandwich. It has chicken kebab and felafel. Served in pita with lettuce, tomatoes and onion with some tahini sauce. He also loves their lentil soup. I think it's ok. I like mine better lol.I like the macdougal sandwich which has the shawarma and felafel with tomatoes, onion, lettuce, and tahini sauce. So yummy! It's also in a pita pocket.Love their pita chips! So bad but so good! The hot sauce they make is excellent. It's very spicy!The baba ganouj is delicious if you like eggplant.The side of chicken kebab is good too, though sometimes a little dry for me.All three desserts are good. They have baklava (of course), knafe (shredded fillo dough with pistachio layers and honey), and mabrumeh (fillo dough topped with mixed nuts and coconut) and honey.Definitely recommend Mamoun's!! Great service every time we have gone in. They're always consistent. And prices aren't bad at all. So worth it!
2020-07-22,1,This was the worst service I've ever received. Apparently they couldn't deliver to my building and "forgot" to let us know after having to call multiple times. Never go here the food isn't even worth it
2020-07-22,5,The schwarma plate is my go to. the portions look small but it's filling. I usually ask for the sauce on the side otherwise the rice is drenched in that white sauce. They have this crack hot sauce I absolutely cannot get enough of!!! Must try!!
2020-07-14,2,It had been a while since I had Mamoun's and I thought I would give it a shot once again. Phoned in advance, and I seemed to have gotten in the wrong line to pick up the order (though it was the only line). I paid for the food and then had to ask the cashier for my food which he seemed to not remember to give to me. I got the food, brought it home. The pita was dry and falling apart, the lamb was a bit crusty. It had to be doused in tahini sauce. It wasn't as bad as their late competitor Garlic & Tahini, but it was not good enough for a return visit anytime soon. Mediocre at best, and the staff seemed like they wanted to be elsewhere.
2020-07-14,5,My go-to whenever I'm craving cheap Middle Eastern food and in particular a spicy and juicy pita.  I consider Mamoun's a NYC staple. Love the eggplant pita and the mango and lemonade juices! I've ordered twice on Grubhub from their Hoboken location and enjoy going to their East Village location in person. Hope they are able to get thru the pandemic.
2020-07-11,4,Great for a quick bite. Highly recommend the bleaker and if you like hot sauce , the sauce is amazing. Recommended putting it on side because of the heat
2020-07-05,5,Came here for lunch one week day and it was delicious. Got the combo platter and it was so much food.
2020-06-29,1,Found two long hairs in our Bleeker Pita. The rice tasted like Big Red chewing gum. Pretty disgusting, wouldn't recommend.
2020-06-29,4,I love their falafel sandwich. It's a MUST try. I believe it costed about a little over 4 dollars a year ago but it seems like it's a little over 6 dollars now. Falafel is always very freshly fried and crispy and it goes amazing in the pita pocket with all of the veggies. I love that they put a good amount of tomato inside. Their hot sauce is addictive. I would be careful though because it can get too spicy if you put too much.
2020-06-07,4,Huge falafel lover. Stopped having Mamoun's awhile back and couldn't remember why. Decided to stop in and have the classic falafel. Overall, not bad but nothing special. The falafel balls were tasty but not a huge fan of the pita. Too thin and tasteless. I'd rather have the one from the halal carts to be honest. Just my opinion though.Added 1 extra star solely for service. The girl at the register was so friendly and really went above and beyond, chatting with every customer and cleaning the bathroom when she noticed it was dirty. Great worker. I'm also really grateful and happy that they're open during the pandemic. My stomach thanks you.
2020-05-28,5,Ordered the Sullivan for lunch today and it was delicious. The portion is very generous and they definitely don't skimp out on the meat/protein. The side of fries were also perfect. Definitely will come back here in the future!
2020-05-26,1,I am all for supporting local businesses during these difficult times but no more Mamoun's for me when they don't know how to treat customers after THEY mess up an order. I was given dry and cold food. Wrong salad. When I called them to let them know, they wanted me to drive all the way back to Hoboken from JC to return a sandwich and a salad after spending $45 with them, this btw was the manager on the phone. WOW! I will take the $15 loss but they will not be seeing my $$ again. It is unacceptable for businesses to have such an awful attitude. And I hope more people stand up to it.
2020-05-24,4,Ordered Mamoums Falafel for pick up, it was ready right away. We ordered a Classic falafel pita, the MacDougal pita, and a side of hummus. All the items were good and fairly priced which is what makes this place a goldmine in Hoboken. Having previously gone to the St. Marks location, the Hoboken restaurant is just as good. For the price you can't beat this place. I'd recommend Mamoun's Falafel for lunch. I ate mine in the park and didn't feel a mid-day slump afterwards (just bring extra napkins since it is a bit of a messy process) I can't wait to try more items from here.
2020-04-13,4,The Mamoun's in New Brunswick was basically a staple of my diet my senior year. I lived right next door and stopped in for a $4 falafel sandwich at least once a week (now they are a whopping $6). The Hoboken location is no different. Great food at insane prices. I went a bit crazy the other night for dinner and ordered a whole spread: dips, sandwiches, desserts...the works. Nothing disappointed. Here was the full order: small hummus and baba ganoush with extra pita, a falafel sandwich and a shawarma sandwich with extra tahini and mabrumeh and knafe for dessert. The dips were probably the best part of the meal. Their hummus is fantastic. It's creamy and flavorful and they put a small amount of oil and paprika. I wish I got a larger side. The baba ganoush was fantastic as well. It has that smokey flavor that not all eggplant dips have but I really like it. Each of the dips come with a large pita bread. The falafel sandwich was just as good as always. I love mine with a ton of tahini and they give you one side of it per sandwich so you should have plenty. My boyfriend got the shawarma sandwich and didn't really like it. He thought it was pretty dry and didn't have too much flavor.  Even though I eat meat, I've always been loyal to their falafel sandwich so I can't personally speak to the shawarma. Now onto dessert! the mabrumeh was amazing. The filling was so tasty (I think it's a combo of 3 nuts) and soft and I loved how sweet it was. The knafe was not as great. It wasn't very sweet and tasted a little grassy. If you are deciding on dessert - go for the mabrumeh, especially if you have a sweet tooth. We got this delivered and it showed up in maybe 20 minutes. All of that before tax, tip and delivery was just around $30, so this is definitely one of my favorite spots for really affordable, great food. I'll forever keep coming back for falafel sandwiches.
2020-03-22,5,Delicious falafel with a great sitting space! Almost as good as the Mcdouglas st store.
2020-03-13,3,3.5 stars. They seem to skimp on the protein for their platters, but the sandwiches are jam packed. The lamb shawarma pita sandwich almost had a little too much shawarma in it and not enough other ingredients (all I could taste is meat with every bite!), but I bet a lot of other people would enjoy that. I also tried the combo plate (falafel, hummus and baba ganouj), and I loved the flavors of the dips. The hummus is creamy with a strong tahini flavor while the baba ganouj is smooth and smoky. I opted to get both rice and salad in the platter ($1 extra), but I didn't think the $1 was necessary. The dish comes out with the same amount of food you'd normally get in the plate, but you pay $1 just to get half rice and half salad. To me that should be standard.
2020-03-04,2,I loved this place and ordered frequently after a long day of work. Have never been inside, but only gotten delivery via Seamless. It goes without say that the surprise object I found in my salad tonight is enough to keep me away from this place for good. Absolutely disgusting and in this day and age, health risks like these shouldn't be taken lightly and screened much better.
2020-02-22,3,Food was great as usual, but the meat portions in the combo was really disappointing. The combo with chicken kebab only had 5 small chunks of chicken and cost $6.00 to add.
2020-02-13,4,Mamouns is one of my favorite places in Hoboken. It never disappoints. They have some of the best falafel around. It's hot, crisp, and not greasy which is key. Their hummus is creamy and flavorful and is always a go to for me. I like to get the chicken combo plate with salad since you get to try a little bit of everything that way. I do think they could be a little more generous with the chicken but it's still an abundance of food. I will caution you to be careful of the hot sauce! A tiny drop goes a long way! Don't make a mistake and drown your food in it. If you don't believe me, give it a try for yourself
2020-02-03,1,Gave me wrong order then denied that they gave me the wrong order and they haven't responded to my other yelp message either. Horrible customer service I have ordered again but this timeI used uber eats. But the food wasPrepared by the restaurant maumounIn Hoboken . The order was 1/28/20207:27pm   Order number traditional falafel sandwichWith two unidentifiable soups thatfrom uber eats is 6ED3F order code..This is my second negative experience From your restaurant . The two lentilSoups were not identifiable as lentilSoups.       Mind you that I have had lentilSoup from your Hoboken restaurant On other occasions and it was fineAnd the way it should be. But theseTwo soups were as if some one tookOne lentil soup and diluted it intoTen soups, it was not eatable.I still have it in my refrigerator if youWould like to eat it or feed it to yourFamily. I complained the same nightTo uber eats and they basically saidThey were sorry about the bad experience but were unable to doAnything at this point when theyAnswer me back by someone namedMae" how is this restaurant going toMake things right when I use themFor business and half the order isGood and half is possibly a health deptIssue. With adulterated foods.Apologies from people and uber eatesJust doesn't cut it especially whenI am paying good money for uneatableFoods. Some one in this place is notHaving their eye on the ball.
2020-01-23,1,Thought this was going to be a good spot and meal but it took a turn for the worst. After eating my chicken plate, hummus, and mint lemonade I woke up in the middle of last night and had the worst case of food poisoning that has still lasted me to now. Please be clean and careful when you serve people, unfortunately I am too scarred to go back now....and hope others don't experience what I did.
2020-01-20,5,I used to always go to this place, in their West Village location... I must say the service and food in Hoboken are just as good... Thank you for coming over the Hudson and giving us a little piece of heaven.... Falafel's are amazing, and the chicken kebab was killer. Thanks also for the smile and nice service.
2020-01-12,4,I came here for a late night bite with my husband. I had no idea that Mamoun's was even in Hoboken. When I saw it, I knew he would want to go.I did not order anything, but he ordered the shawarma platter. I forgot to snap a picture, but it was delicious. It came with shawarma, one pita, rice, and veggies. Service was quicker than expected and prices were a bit steep
2020-01-01,1,What a piece of shit restaurant. Ordered 2 entrees and receive soggy pieces of chicken (barely 2oz) over a soggy salad. Paid $20 for that! Unreal. Avoid at all costs.
2019-12-06,2,Recently food hasn't been so good as it use to be!.I got chicken falafel bowl and it was really hard!! You couldn't even eat it after driving to get here it took us 25-30 mins
2019-12-05,4,Known for their falafel and now i know why.!! West village falafel sandwich sooo flavorful and lots of falafel and toppiNgs. Lemon soup kind of bland flavor but added spicy sauce at table and gave the kick i was lookIng for with pita chips topping. And service was so quick order ready while i was still paying. Which is ghos since it was lunch hour on a cold day in Hoboken
2019-12-02,5,We ordered from Mamoun's late at night after a long day and the food was delicious. We got the East Village and the MacDougall sandwiches and they hit the spot. The delivery and service was great. I recommend asking for the hot sauce if you like very very spicy food. ***Caution*** It's veryyy spicy. You have been warned.
2019-11-27,4,So good!!! So cheap, fresh, yummy, have I mentioned cheap?? I went twice on my 5 day visit to NYC, once for a falafel sandwich and once again for baba ganoush as a midday snack. Great both times. Only complaint is that the hot sauce isn't my favorite - tastes like a bunch of spices and not much else (not in a good way). Cannot go wrong with any of the menu options tho
2019-11-16,4,I've heard a lot about this place and being a fellow middle eastern who's had my fair share of falafel, I will say this falafel is very good! I loved how soft and fluffy the pita bread is as well. We got the lamb plate and it was good, nothing extraordinary.
2019-11-14,4,Very good middle eastern food chain! I enjoyed the falafel combo and the portion sizes are really big. Decent price for all the food you get.
2019-11-13,4,I am a huge advocate for Mamouns! I absolutely love their food. I have been going to the New Brunswick location for as long as I can remember. They opened this location a while back ago and I recently visited this place and was blown out of the water. This location is actually pretty big and service is great. The people working behind the register could be a little more suggestive and seem somewhat friendlier. The prices are the same as the other location and the food is fresh as well. The dining atmosphere seems pretty welcoming with clean tables and bright lights. The age group that comes this location can vary from teenagers, younger adults to families wanting to enjoy one of their falafel's. As I said for the last location which I will say again for this location if you are in the area grab yourself a falafel from Mamoun's!
2019-11-04,1,Use to delicious and worth your money now it's like $6 chicken over rice carts. The packaging is shitty. Food quantity is so less now for freaking $14. Use to be a regular customer. I would rather go to $6 carts than mamouns
2019-10-31,5,Mamoun's is the shizzz! If you're afraid to try it, don't be! Everything is so yummy, warm, and fresh. I always go for the chicken kebob plate with rice. The rice is crack! It is soooo good that I could eat it on its own. I love their hot sauce as well. It adds an amazing flavor level to the already aromatic food. The pickled vegetables a nice tang to each bite, along with the peppers. The mango juice is my go to drink because it doesn't taste watered down or nectar like. I've always tried the hummus and the falafel, neither of which I am a fan of in general. However, I have to say that Mamoun's hummus is smooth and creamy. The falafel has a nice bite to it and great flavor. The baklava is a perfect ending to a fulfilling meal- sweet, nutty, flakey and sticky! I love it! Portion sizes are big, so I end up having to eat half the next day. Prices are extremely fair and ever since they moved the restaurant, it has become more spacious and inviting. This is definitely a great place to try out for a late night craving.
2019-10-15,4,This place is a solid spot for fast food that has better quality than fast food. I usually get the lamb pita and it's really good! The drink options are pretty good too. I know others who have gotten the falafel and hummus and said it's good too. Make sure you get your sauces so it doesn't feel as dry
2019-10-10,4,I love Mamoun's! I have been going to the the one in NY on McDouggal for years. The one in Hoboken is great as well. However, I will give them 4 out of 5 stars because they never give enough napkins. I bought a shwarma, 2 falafel sandwiches and fries: I only received 3 napkins. (The food gets messy when you use the sauce!) Other than that, the food was great and I always intend on coming back....just wish they'd hand out more napkins!Also: you have to request tahini/white sauce for the falafel sandwich... they don't give it to you on the side without you asking..... the one in NY always gave some on the side.. but these are all little things... does not take away from how good the food tastes!
2019-09-28,4,Falafel and chicken shawarma from this place are amazing. Pita is so warm and fresh too and service is quick too.
2019-09-26,5,I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this place. Their food is beyond amazing. I'd recommended shawarma and the classic. They're definitely my go-to. Pair any of these with some mint lemonade and you'll have yourself the perfect feast. Always leave here satisfied, full and wanting more!
2019-09-21,1,Aside from much of the food being WAY - WAY too salty,  Mamoun's place really stinks to do business with. They could care less about their accuracy of their orders, timely delivery or the general satisfaction of their customers.   Today I had yet another horrible experience with placing my order, getting everything that I ordered and then the uncaring and frustrating interaction with a person who could not have cared less.I am done doing business with these guys. There are too many places who actually care about their customers to deal with folks like Mamoun's.
2019-09-18,4,Great fresh Mediterranean falafel spot! Open late in Hoboken for those hankering some great food late! We enjoy sharing the platters and I suggest trying the unsweetened Mamoun's iced tea with a splash of their mint lemonade. Trust me, you'll need it if you use any of the Mamoun's hot sauce. Shoutout to Vianna for saving us $3 by recommending a combo platter instead of the chicken kebob plate by adding extra sharma on the side. Yummmmm!
2019-09-06,5,Time: no wait time, order on the go, 5 min max.Quality: the quality of the food was definitely medium to high. Quantity: will definitely make you full. First date: definitely not, very casual not the type of place you want you date to experience for a first impression. Overall: good place to hang out with friends, and good place to order on the go. Special note: I would definitely try the shawarma and chicken kebabs.Would I recommend: yes
2019-09-05,5,Have visited several times in NY but never got a chance to try throne at Hoboken. Most people told me it's not as great as the one on Mcdougal, but it turned out great!Classic sandwich - the sandwich contains fresh greens, lovely crisp falafel, tomatoes and onions. This is a delight. No extra herbs. No extra veggies. It's classic hummus, pita and falafel. THIS IS A MUST TRY! (Be sure to eat this big sandwich real fast; it gets soggy pretty soon)West Side Sandwich - this one contains tons of peppers(not spicy but sour), tabouleh, greens, falafel, hummus and tahini. In short, it's a little bit of everything. I did not like the sour peppers with the pita bread and probably would give this a miss compared to the classic.P.S - for those who love spicy food, there is hot sauce available and it is pretty hot!
2019-09-04,5,My go to place for shawarma! I have been eating with this family run business since I was a little girl! You know your getting fresh, flavorful food in a clean environment! The hot sauce is nothing to play with...you've been warned! The tamarind juice and lemonade are always super refreshing.
2019-08-25,5,Mamoun's has become my new go-to for takeout. I've only ever ordered the chicken kabob plate with salad and rice and it has been consistently delicious. I love the garlic sauce. The only thing I will say is that the seasoning on the rice can be overpowering. Must get the baklava.
2019-08-24,3,This place used to be great. But now since its under new management, the meat is not halal. I have confirmed atleast 3 times on different days with the staff and the manager ( thatshow much I long for their chicken shwarma) But still their vegetarian platter is good. If you are the owner reading this, please make this place halal again.
2019-08-22,4,I was thrilled when Mamoun's Falafel opened in Hoboken, since it offered a leaner solution to late-night dining.  That comment should by no means overshadow the benefit of being able to enjoy authentic Middle Eastern food for a quick lunch or dinner as well.  After my first visit to this location, I started going on a regular basis.  The dining room is rather spacious with several tables and a lengthy counter with stools both available.  In addition, a few outdoor spots are offered in warmer months.In terms of my order, I tend to alternate between the Vegetarian Combo Plate and the Chicken Kebob Platter, depending on my mood or how many other meat meals I have eaten during the remainder of the week.  The combo plate includes a base of salad or rice (I get salad), which is topped with falafel, hummus, and baba ganouj, which is my favorite component.  There are a few pickles and olives thrown in as well, and a pita comes on the side.  There is not much texture to the dish, but that also allows you to walk away feeling less full.  The marinated Chicken Breast Platter includes chunks of poultry that have been removed from their grilling skewer and placed over salad with tahini sauce and pickled vegetables.  This hearty dish includes well-seasoned chicken and is more substantial than the vegetarian counterpart, but both are delicious.Again, Mamoun's is a great place for quick-serve dining that you can customize to your liking in terms of portion-size and healthiness.  They offer quality sustenance throughout the day and into the wee hours of the morning.
2019-08-21,4,This is our weeknight quick dinner spot.Pretty tasty falafel.The baklava is out of this world.Overall the food is tasty,nice seating area and good service.The prices are very reasonable.
2019-08-17,2,I really love their lentil soup and it's always good, but their hummus makes my stomach hurt.I guess it's the oil they put in it because I can eat hummus anywhere else and I'm fine.It's either not 100% olive/ tahini oil they're using or they may be using a large amount of oil in the recipe. I'm not sure...
2019-08-16,5,THIS PLACE HAS THE BEST FOOD!!! I love the falafel sandwich and the minty lemonade. The prices are great too! Everything I've had here is delicious. This is a great place to eat good food and hang out with friends.
2019-08-12,5,I've been a loyal customer of Mamoun's for over 20 years. Their West Village location is the original location and about 100 square feet inside. Basically, 5 people or so can stand at West Village location. Mamoun's was my spot back in the day after going to Limelight and Avalon. You can to this day rely on Mamoun's to always deliver consistency. Hoboken location is even better than West Village in my opinion. I love Hoboken location because it's spacious, cute decor and lively. Interior of this location has about 15 tables or so and about 10 bar seats which are pretty comfortable. Order the mango juice if you like mangoes and order the tamarind juice if you fancy tamarind! Mamoun's bakes their own pita chips in house. I always pick up a bag for $2 and snack on them the next day at work. A small hummus side runs about $3 and is the perfect compliment to those crunchy pita chips. I ordered the chicken kabob sandwich and devoured it. The pita bread at Mamoun's is the best. Thank you Mamoun's!
2019-08-08,1,Music is way too loud!!!!!!!!!!!!And when chairs and stools are moved around it's insanely loud. Put some rubber on the bottom of the dam chairs please. It's horrific to eat here!
2019-08-07,4,Always good. But. A stealth bag charge. 10 whole cents,I know, but I wasn't given the option of using my own bag..
2019-08-05,2,The staff is very nice. But the place is nothing like the original in the village. The worst lamb ever. Tasted like a steakum. Full of Grease.
2019-08-02,4,This is a great place for Falafel and Shawarma Sandwich (lamb). Delivery came quickly as well. I always wanted to try Shawarma meat since I saw in Avengers :) I now know what it is.  I also enjoyed Falafel. They are delicious. I will definitely order from here again.  Shawarma Sandwich was filled with a good amount of meat and vegetables in Pita bread. Falafel on the side was the perfect companion to the sandwich. The hot sauce was also nice. I recommend this place if you are looking for something different to try.
2019-07-25,5,For $6, the Falafel Pita/Sandwich is an amazing deal for a great meal in Hoboken anytime of the day. Finding something for that price here in Hoboken for dinner is almost impossible, and the fact that it's so good makes it all so much better. The sandwiches with meat are a little more than 6 but should definitely be worth the extra change. The food is great and the service is always lovely! I also really love baklava they have on display, they are really delicious.
2019-07-14,4,Great food. Pleasant service. Fresh, consistent, reasonably priced fare. Please Mamoun's management, invest in some adhesive felt strips to place under the feet of chairs. The screeching sound of heavy metal chair dragging across a stone floor is blood curdling. Such an easy fix.
2019-06-29,5,I can't get enough of Mamouns. It's quick, affordable and 100% tasty. Every time. I have begun to order the combo plate with chicken. Every bit of their food is delicious from their rice, to their pickled toppings, meats, baba ganoush....etc. Desserts? Yup delicious as well.If you haven't been here get here. You'll probably find me in here ! Once a week I go!
2019-06-29,5,The Hoboken location carries over the tradition from the West Village by serving damn-tasty falafels with machoistically hot sauce. You'll be hard-pressed to find a fresher falafel or spicier sauce this side of the Atlantic. Only thing this place needs is a fountain dispenser of milk to quell the peppers from the sauce. Instead get a side of that creamy hummus.
2019-06-28,1,When you order a plate to go, they force you to have the salad and meat on one plate. They are not willing to put in a separate container. Your whole meal is full with liquids. Don't get a take out, it will be cold and wet!
2019-06-20,2,I'm so disappointed in Mamoun's! I ordered a medium hummus and only when I got home did I notice they only gave me a small!!! I order the hummus pretty regularly as I really like it but this is terrible! Sorry but downgraded to two stars!
2019-06-17,5,We were on Holiday and visited this place 3-4 times. The food is delicious. The hummus and pita is amazing ( the best hummus I've tasted). The Bleeker sandwich and Sullivan sandwich were are favorites and the house fries. They also do some refreshing drinks, mango and a mint lemonade that we enjoyed. Don't miss the dessert, we tried all and could not decide which was the best. Definitely our stop when we visit next.
2019-06-16,5,I like these guys. Ordered classic falafel sandwich with fries and garlic sauce from seamless. Prices were very fair, order was delivered in less time than estimated, food was hot, fresh and somehow still crispy and not soggy! A 5-star experience and will reorder :)
2019-06-15,3,For the price (less than $9 for a falafel plate), this can't be beat. I got the falafel plate and it wasn't life-changing, but was very tasty and made me want to try more falafel / Mediterranean food in the future! The falafel was somewhat dry but still really flavorful, I liked the sauce that it came with. Salad was standard (iceberg lettuce, tomato) but tasted good with the sauce and pita bread. There's not much seating in the shop but you can go to the nearby Washington Square Park. There's an ATM next door, which is helpful bc Mamoun's is cash only.
2019-06-14,5,Great place for a quick bite! The food had lots of flavor and tasted fresh. I thought the service was really nice too. The baklava was delicious.
2019-06-12,5,Delicious, with good prices, and a good crowd. The wait wasn't too bad for such a crowded place at lunch and the employees were nice.I got the schwarma (and added the spicy sauce for some extra punch), mango drink, and ktaif and loved everything.
2019-06-07,5,It's soo good. Fast, delicious, authentic. Vegetarian's delight. Loved it and would recommend to anyone that like Mediterranean.
2019-06-04,4,I must say this establishment has always been a foundation growing up in the area. It was always somewhere where we wouldn't go out of our way to indulge in old country cuisine. However I must say that after the establishment was converted over to a franchise and taking into account the much larger restaurant and rising costs one could understand why certain aspects of the experience may have changed. With that being said the Gyro went from being 100% accurate rendition of a Gyro you would get off of the streets of Egypt to some version of chopped corned beef with spices similar to what could be almost authentic. I must say I just came here for dinner and I was substantially disappointed. The food is still good and the quality is great and to the average person they probably would not notice. I still intend on coming here however my idea of the best Shawarma sandwich on earth no longer resides with this establishment.Lastly there is a lack of communication between the cashier and the kitchen as I was very adamant that I could not have tomatoes in any of the sandwiches or onions and lo and behold when I got home all of the sandwiches had literally extra tomatoes and extra onions. As nominal as that may sound certain things like onions can destroy someone's meal if they are not accustomed to a specific ingredient such as onions and tomatoes. Really put a damper on our Mamoun's tradition of buying this on our holiday to remind us of the old country. In retrospect despite these changes that I perceive as being the worst I will still write the restaurant four out of five stars is the overall value of the speed of service and quality of food is still superb just as long as you're not comparing it so being 100% authenticI guess I can only reminisce about that perfect Shawarma sandwich i used to have back in the Day
2019-05-26,5,This is my go to place for lunch or dinner whenever I am on my own. Absolutely love the baba ganoush, classic falafel sandwich and the kunafa.Pros:-- Appropriate portions even if you are famished. You will be full for a long time-- Reasonable (I cannot imagine a satisfying $6 lunch anywhere else on Washington Street) -- Truly delicious pita bread- I have been to tonnes of Mediterranean Restaurants and also lived in those countries. I can say the pita here is actually nice.-- Friendly staff Cons: None
2019-05-18,1,Wow, this place has really gone DOWN hill after their renovation and new ownership. They don't have enough hot sauce bottles and when you ask for more, they refuse to give you one. The seating is TERRIBLE. When the traffic picks up, the place is a basically a fast food restaurant. They don't even have napkins out, you have to traverse through the everlasting line to the front counter and wait for the workers to notice you after you've called them about 15 times, only for them to rudely hand you 5 small napkins. Very disappointed.
2019-05-12,5,This is one of the best falafel and shawarma sandwiches I've had since I left Affrica, hands down.
2019-05-10,3,It was my first time coming to this restaurant and I was excited to order a vegeterian plate however, I did not realize how salty the food would be. The falafel and rice were delicious! But the hummus and sauce they add on top of the rice made it salty. I'm sure you can ask them to go easy on the sauce (which I'll do next time!) other than that I did enjoy the food.
2019-05-09,5,New location is always clean. My biggest complaint is that I'm having a hard time staying away from their food. Plus they're open late.
2019-05-06,4,I love Mediterranean food ... Really good food ! The bowl is filling and yummy. I ordered the plate - chicken kabab, and I got rice along with it with a side of hummus and falafel too (add-ons). They give a nice and soft pita bread along with it. The rice is flavored beautifully and goes well with the chicken kebab. Their service is super quick ! Falafels are amazing too From the chunks of chicken I found 2 of them undercooked (hence 4 star) I ordered the mango drink which was really refreshing and nice Also what I didn't like is the baklava. It's toooooo sweet and too much of cinnamon.Overall would rate this 4/5 because its value for money. The plate was good enough for two people. Will come back here for sure.
2019-05-03,5,I thought I liked falafel until I tried Mamoun's...now I am completely obsessed! I've been here several times for lunch since it is near my office and every time I am amazed at how incredible the falafel here is. It is my new go-to lunch spot (although you definitely should come hungry) It's usually crowded around lunch time, but the line moves quickly! Their menu has many options including vegetarian and non-vegetarian sandwiches and platters. I always get some kind of pita sandwich, which is packed full of delicious falafel, veggies, and hummus/sauces. Overall, perfect spot to grab lunch when you want something affordable, filling and delicious. Definitely worth the hype.
2019-05-01,5,quick fats service, nice employees & clean place. the chicken kabob plater is my go too. always full of flavor
2019-04-21,3,Ordered chicken kebab plate. Food came within 5 min. It was okay for the price, the chicken breast is very dry and overcooked.
2019-04-20,4,Great chicken kebab sandwiches. Well seasoned and a great portion size. Deducting a star because their pita bread NEVER holds up and the sandwich always falls apart. The hummus is really delicious.
2019-03-27,2,I don't know if management changed when the location changed, but the place is a far cry from what it used to be with the old team. While it previously had more of an Arabic menu with employees that have been there for years, the new place is much more akin to American fast food to the point I don't see it packed at any given time at night anymore.
2019-03-26,1,Service below any level...this place needs new employees and new management. Wow, can't deliver food. Don't get to this place ever never.Food is average and the type of very bad service occurs again and again. They don't really care.
2019-03-17,3,This is great value for money spot for Middle Eastern food in Hoboken. After they moved to the corner spot, their decor has gotten upscale and the food is still as good as it was before, coupled with a quick service. Pita sandwiches have plenty of meat and the bread is fresh; skip the hummus - it's middle of the road for me, instead go for the extra meat. Baklava is plenty sweet and should cure any sweet tooth cravings.
2019-03-04,3,This place was great when they started, great service,friendly staff, and great environment. But lately  their cooking quality starts to go down. Its my third visit in a row and they been reheat the chicken and it was dry.
2019-03-04,5,Amazing service and quick delivery! They make our lunch in office an great one every time!
2019-02-22,4,I love this location of Mamoun's. It doesn't get super crowded and the food is great.Super filling and fresh ingredients.The hummus is delicious.
2019-02-22,2,It's nice to have a location outside of the city, this is an offshoot of the original stores in Manhattan.They were surprised at my shwarma request - no veggies, no white sauce, but gave it to me. The quantity of lamb was not a lot compared to what they give in the city (much smaller size), and while the spices were about the right kind, the flavor was off and it wasn't the same in the city versions of the same. Price was perhaps a little cheaper according to the staffer, so I have to go back and see what pricing was in the city.The hummus was the same, as was the spicy red sauce, though, so if you use a lot of the latter, you might not notice.
2019-02-20,5,Excellent! So appreciative of the dining space as for a long time, there weren't enough seats to sit customers. Of course I go for the shawerma. Absolutely delicious,overstuffed with pickles (at my request). And the Baklava-delicious! Perfect balance of sweet and crunchy. Must try!
2019-02-17,5,I went to the original Mamoun's on macdougal for the first time in 2001. I went with my friend, his sister and his mom and then we saw Conan's late night show. It was a great night. When I started going to Hoboken, prior to living there, I was psyched to find out there was a Mamoun's. Falafel is a great choice for a quick lite eat, but if I'm going for a meal, I like getting a falafel, shawarma, and mango juice. They used to have spinach pies that were the bomb, but stopped making them If I'm a good boy, I'll treat myself to some baklava.
2019-02-17,5,Simply put the BEST Falafel in Hudson county! Their babaganoush is also amazing as well as the other menu items. This place is great and is a cant miss when in Hoboken everything is always fresh!!!!!
2019-02-13,4,Great to see Mamoun's Falafel from Macdougal Street in New York open up a location in Hoboken, New Jersey! Mamoun's Falafel is really best for their pita sandwiches. I would 100% recommend getting a pita sandwich if you go here. This is a great option for workday lunch (whether you are picking up food or eating in) or picking up dinner after work. Unfortunately, Mamoun's options outside of the pita sandwiches are a little more expensive than I would expect. I feel like Mamoun's would be more popular if they made their prices for menu items outside of pita sandwiches more reasonable. I hope they stick around in Hoboken! In New York, Mamoun's is known as a delicious, hole in the wall, late night, cheap food spot. Hoboken is really different from Macdougal Street in Manhattan, but I think they can adapt and thrive here. Better and cheaper lunch options would be great!
2019-02-12,4,It was Friday evening and my husband is fond of this place. He used to eat Lunch from here when he was working near by. We had our car parked a little far and walked to the restaurant. It was crowded and we stood in the line to order. We ordered one chicken kabab platter and one shawarma platter. They both came with pita bread. I asked if I can get a whole wheat pita bread, they told me that the only pita bread they is the grain one which is house baked.We also ordered one Mabrumeh from the desserts, it looked amazing so could not go without it. Our order was to-go and it wa sready in 5-10 mins.Chicken Kebab - 4/5It was delicious, came with 3 sides of your choice, pickled onions, salad and pita. I got 2 hummus and baba ganoush as my sides. It was perfect platter for me.Shawarma - 3/5It is lamb shawarma, came with rice or salad(extra $ for both), pickled onions, salad and pita. My husband liked it. It was flavor but we have better.Mabrumeh was delicios, it is a pastry dipped in honey and syrup with so many nuts on top.Service was quick and everyone in the staff was friendly.
2019-02-12,4,The falafel is very good tender flavorful fried to perfection and was piping hot. They must have a speedy system in place because it took all but three minutes for me to receive my order. These are the perfect hangover, post drinking, I'm dying of starvation snack and the price is right too.
2019-02-07,5,They were so kind and personable! We came here after a night out for a friend's birthday and they sang, even gave our friend a dessert! We love this place and would definitely come again.
2019-01-30,5,The best place in Hoboken to get middle eastern food! Great quality for a great price! Always fresh ingredients with tons of flavor. You can't go wrong with anything from the menu! The restaurant has a great ambiance. Great for a casual first date! It can get a little crowded at peak times but other than that it's a great place to sit, enjoy your meal, and get some work done.
2019-01-28,5,Consistently fresh and delicious. Mamoun's is perhaps the best place to eat in Hoboken. Yes, it's because Mamoun's is great. And yes, it's also because the options in Hoboken are depressing.The wraps are incredible. Get them for here. The Classic and Sullivan are my favorites!
2019-01-26,1,Argh - so disappointed.I ordered the falafel combo with hummus and baba ghanoush and salad. Terrible! The baba ghanoush tasted like a bitter version of the hummus. You can barely taste the eggplant, just a thick bitter hummus. The hummus was not good either. I was so hungry but I couldn't even bear to finish. The falafels were below average. Maybe I'm used to the delicious falafels at other places. These are just not good. For about $10 of a platter like this, I had higher expectations. This is way worse than $6 street food truck ones.
2019-01-24,5,Mamoun's is my favourite spot for falafel and hummus. The falafel is green inside which is so delicious. The spicy red sauce is epic if you like spicy sauce and the shawarma plate with rice is more than enough food. I go every couple of weeks with my kid cause I live 20 minutes away and they always do a great job, thanks team!
2019-01-20,1,Order delivery from mamours once every few weeks. Called tonight and an incredibly rude woman told me she won't deliver to our address anymore because we are 2.0 miles away. Unbelievably stupid and shortsighted.
2019-01-05,5,I've been to Mamoun's in New Brunswick before but this was a super sized location in Hoboken. Plenty of friendly staff onboard. Food comes out pretty quick and the place is super clean. I ordered the shawarma platter. I normally get the a sandwich with extra sauce and extra shawarma. Since I'm on Keto, I decided to stick to the platter. They give you a decent amount of food. I just wish I got more shawarma. I also had the mint Lemon-aide. It's one of my favorites here. For dessert they have trays of baklava staring you right in the face. Of course I cheated on my diet and tried some. It was all delicious. I recommend this place to everyone.

2018-12-30,5,Awesome place. Everything is great here. I have no complaints. The ultimate sign that a restaurant is good, is if there are people in it, and Mamouns is always jammin. (There are a lotta places in Hoboken that are dead inside, and they never last long). Mamouns is the king of fast-casual food in this town.Not to mention, the baklava is really fantastic. Whenever I come to Hoboken, even if I don't get an entree. I stop in for that baklava.Go easy on that hot sauce though, it'll "grab you by the booboo" to quote Cheech n Chong
2018-12-11,3,They have spoilt the taste. This wasn't the same when Mamoun's didnt go with such changes before. Taste was so authentic and their pita bread was delish. I am disappointed with their recent changes.
2018-11-25,4,Needed falafel and this place delivered! Price was nice too. I recommend the " Manhattan" pita falafel.
2018-11-18,5,Woah this place is yummy!Was craving a "light" lunch which meant bigger than a sandwich but smaller than a chipotle bowl so I came here. Ordered the Mcdougal Meat Sandwich that had the shawarma and falafel in a pita bread and the bag was delightful heavy. Everything in the sandwich tasted delicious together and hot dang (!!!) their hot sauce has a real kick to it. Seriously, it left me in tears so you've been warned. For the price, I got 2 meals out of it so I'm super sold on this place.
2018-11-14,5,I live in Hoboken and this place is always there for us! My friends and I love to stop in here after a night out (they're open later than most places) but the food is good at any time! Great hummus and pita. All their vegetarian options are really cheap, and while the price jumps for anything containing meat, it's still a good deal.I usually just get a shawarma or baba ganouj pita pocket, but my guy friends always get the plates because it's a nice large portion size. Whatever you get, I highly recommend!Beware of the hot sauce on the tables--it is so spicy so you don't want to use too much!
2018-11-05,4,My go to spot when I'm looking for something cheap, good, and filling. Their falafel platter will run you about $9 but comes with tons of food (perhaps maybe enough to share between two people so neither one of you ends up in a food-coma). I always ask for extra pickles, which they happily oblige to every time. Their mangolassi drink is really delicious and you can ask for a sample if you've never had. Becareful of their hot sauce, that you can ask for on the side, because it's quite spicy, and if you can't handle spice it's probably best that you stay away from the it.
2018-10-22,5,This place kept me sustained my entire pregnancy. Clean, fresh food, amazing flavors.
2018-10-09,5,This is hands down the go to spot.  I haven't visited a bad location yet.  This is great because, I always know what I'm going to get.  I like to order the veggie option from time to time.
2018-10-06,3,Found this place by searching halal food on Yelp, but unfortunately they're not carrying halal food. So, I took a veggie plate.
2018-09-23,5,Best falafal in NYC. Excellent fresh ingredients and vegetarian food. The fritters are very tasty and sauce is excellent.
2018-09-14,2,As others have said, big disappointment since the move. Prior, I could order everyday. Shwarma, falafel, hummus always great.Now, hummus is different, Shwarma is greasy or dry and just doesn't have the flavor and the falafel are nowhere near as good. That and what I believe are in house made pita are just not that good.I remember having falafel at the original location in NYC and felt like I had found what I would request as my last meal. Original Hoboken it was identical, now not so much. The original deserves it place in the "1000 things to see before your die" book, now not so much.Please go back to your roots
2018-09-09,4,Super busy place, loved the old location better, but still my favorite place. Cheap eats with high satisfaction. Tasty food with good vegetarian selection.Need to mention that old location had better food, better price, and better customer service and it was cute and cozy. New location is bigger, brighter, cleaner, longer line.....
2018-09-08,4,Great service, fresh ingredients and short lines. My only dissatisfaction was the dessert. It tasted a bit stale and overly sweet, but all in all pretty great customer service (especially considering the time) and very clean and especially good whole food.Would totally recommend for a late night meal.
2018-09-04,4,After working around the area for almost a year I finally come around to try this place out! I was advised by a coworker to try and get here before the lunch rush around 12pm, and I came about 11:30am, no line pretty empty.Very nice and clean dining area, bathrooms also very clean which in my opinion is a great thing since I believe they reflect how a restaurant operates in cleanliness.Ordered the bleeker sandwich that came on a pita bread, which was disappointing because it was the size of a medium hand and for the price I expected something bigger, but it was very delicious that I ordered a side of falafel which was delicious and well made.
2018-09-01,4,Honestly i really enjoyed their chicken kebab sandwich. The portion is pretty good for the price. The chicken has good flavor its moist has a grilled flavor to it and also a whole bunch of seasoning and they arent skimpy with it in the sandwich! I would definitely come back for it if you are looking for a quick bite for lunch!
2018-08-16,2,I can't believe I am writing this review. Before they moved from the old location they were 5 stars every day of the week. I went last night I ordered a chicken kabob salad plate and a large hummus. On the register was the most unenthusiastic sour faced person took my order and I proceeded to wait 15 minutes for my order being made. When I got home with my order I couldn't believe how much they have reduced the size of the the $8 "large" hummus and the container was old around half full. Totally unacceptable amount for that price and it used to be a lot larger. You do get 4 pita breads with it which is at least something. My chicken kabob salad, while generous with the chicken, was pretty much inedible and was as hard and as dry as eating golf balls. Even after a few beers feeling really hungry, my plate didn't satisfy my late night munchies. $20 wasted. I will go back one more time in the hope that this was a one off. This used to be one of my all time favorite spots in Hoboken but after last nights experience, I think I'd have gotten a lot tastier and cheaper meal from McDonalds across the street.
2018-08-15,4,Pretty decent for a franchise or rather a concept not original multilocation eatery..i was very pleasantly surprised at how clean and fast the service was...yet it still sad that ethnic eateries have to water themselves down  for for a certain group of people to make it palatible, ..it was good in the same way buying "authentic tacos" from group of a blonde surfers named Bret, Fiona, and their awesome business partner brad is. Its as ethic as chipotle or olive garden...Listen for late night run it's perfect down right delicious....it is clean and has that same McDonalds, Burger king interior feel which definitely makes the bret's and fiona's feel at home....they have all right foods at good prices, I admit if it had been earlier i would of found a more family owned joint, after all its jersey with the largest middle eastern population in the US so its an easy find....Overall I give the place 2 thumbs up, geest place, regardless of those other short comings,the food is good, the other issues are society problems not theirs. Expanding and wanting a more "diverse" crowd to feel welcomed required that Mcdonalds meets lebanon meets starbucks, meets chipotle as a neccesity.. I get it.... ..Ill definitely be back for my late nite falafel's
2018-08-05,3,Tried their shawarma (with falafel) and was surprised by the size! I have to admit that the flavor was lacking and not what I was expecting. I put some hot sauce after and it helped a little bit. I had to try the baklava which was also ok. Lastly, the service is fast and friendly. Give it a try and be your own judge. :)
2018-07-28,4,Great delivery food experience. Fresh, lamb was tasty and not fatty or dry. Pita was hot and really delicious. They paid attention to my special requests notes which was appreciated. Definitely would order here again.
2018-07-21,3,I ordered the lamb shawarma sandwich it was delicious BUT it contained more lettuce than lamb smh !!
2018-07-21,3,This place does not have halal food, it did in the past but not any more as people working there told us.  The vegetarian options are still good reason to visit the place.
2018-07-20,2,I have been coming here for a while but lately it's gone down hill fast and the prices have gone up considerably.As soon as you try to order the problems start, there were 8 people working/having a fine old time, however only one was taking orders, then once I had my order and sat someone asked me "if I found everything I was looking for today" FFS this is not Macy's made me laugh, the food is still good but the prices are not, I don't think it justifies itself price to quality and portion.
2018-07-20,5,Love their food and very well priced! I highly recommend any of their sandwiches and adding grape leaves! Yum!!
2018-07-09,4,This is the best grilled chicken in the area. Only Steinway is better. Not too much fuss, and good prices.
2018-07-08,5,Best place to go after a night hitting the bars in Hoboken. Great, courteous staff and the food hits the spot. Love the late hours, and the staff always ensures you're well taken care of, even if you're drunk lol.
2018-07-07,5,This place has been here for years. Well known for their fresh ingredients and falafel. Came here the other day for lunch and ordered the shawarma platter. Food came out rather quickly. The meat was well seasoned and the fresh vegetables were delicious. Plenty of food for what I paid. The hummus was delicious and I felt bad that I had so much food left over. This is a great dining spot if you love falafel. They have vegetarian options as well!
2018-07-04,1,This place used to be really good but since they moved to the new place they almost doubled the prices and everytime you have to wait at least 30 minutes to get your food. I have been here 3 times so far and definitely the not going back ever again. Last time it took us 1 hour to get our food.
2018-07-04,5,One of my go to spots when I lived in Hoboken. Very simple yet so good. Shawarma plate is the way to go. Hummus and babba ganoush are great additions as well. Also they are hands down the best late night food option in town. Hoping they open one in Morristown soon (Hint!).
2018-06-27,5,Restaurant was busy, as expected. For a popular place in this area on the weekend. You order at the counter, pay and they call your number when food is ready. For a busy place, we did not feel rushed by the cashier at all, and he answered all questions with a great attitude. I tried the chicken kabob plate with rice and salad. The chicken pieces were grilled perfectly, not too dry but not undercooked either. They also give you a good amount of pieces. The salad had olives, onions, tomatoes, etc. and they put a white sauce on the rice. The rice and white sauce were allright, not a taste you remember. But the  quality and taste of the chicken pieces along with the fresh salad was amazing! And the bread they give was the best - soft, hot fresh pita bread (not those packaged ones for sure). They have a hot red sauce which is veryyy veryyyy spicy (be careful) but if you like spicy you will want to add some of it.
2018-06-25,1,weekday lunch counter guy is a useless liar, delayed my order unnecessarily, omitted condiments even when reminded
2018-06-12,3,It seems that just about every time I visit my daughter in Hoboken we order delivery from Mamoun's. Our orders were always well prepared and delivered in a timely manner. The one time they goofed and forgot an item that we paid for, the delivery guy went back to the restaurant and in in short order there he was was at the door with the forgotten item -- even though it was now after midnight!Our typical order includes Falafel, Hummus, Baba Ganouj, Tabbouleh and Pita. All are prepared in the traditional manner. The flavors and textures are spot on. I'm particularly fond of their Harissa sauce. If you haven't tried it -- approach with caution because it is fiery hot! But once you know how much your palate can tolerate, if you like Harissa like I do, you'll be adding some to every bite. Now to be honest, I've had better Middle Eastern food elsewhere and I've even cooked better Middle Eastern food at home (even though all my ancestors are northern Europeans). But when I get into town after a long plane ride or drive, there's nothing better than to kick back and enjoy a couple of cold beers and have a tasty supper delivered to your door. I'll be back in Hoboken in a few months and I'm sure we'll order from Mamoun's again.
2018-06-02,4,Good food, but I remember the original Mamoun's from a million years ago when the prices were cheaper and food quality was better. Still, can't hate on this place. They got popular and to keep up with Hoboken prices, it's more expensive now. Still good food. Came around 8:10pm on a Friday (we came for iftar) and the line wasn't bad. But as soon as we were eating/leaving around 8:30-9pm it was PACKED. Like crazy crazy packed as if all of Hoboken decided to come here at the same time. It wasn't even one big group either, legit hoards of different groups of people were in line and waiting for food. Anyway, we've gotten just about everything on the menu at all of the Mamoun's (NYC, New Brunswick, Hoboken before it moved to this location) and everything is always good.
2018-05-31,4,Got lamb gyro sandwhich one of the best ive had you can really taste the lamby gamey taste of it and the pita bread is soo yummy. I also tried some of my friend's combo platter hummus and babaganouche the babaganouche was bomb. The dessert looked pretty good i got the one that's ciruclar and had nuts on top it was decent but ive had better personally wouldnt recomend that one but i would give the other ones a shot.
2018-05-26,5,The hummus is amazing! I tried the shawarma combo with chicken kebob and mint lemonade! The lemonade was refreshing! Loved it, Recommend it!
2018-05-09,1,This place is nothing like the original in Manhattan so be warned. I ordered the lamb schwarma  platter and the lamb did not taste grilled it tasted more like it was boiled or baked it was flavorless and colorless and was very light gray color. The chicken tasted grilled but was flavorless and had the consistency of cardboard. The pita which is the worst part is very bland and definitely taste like cardboard. The rice is flavorless.  I cannot recommend this place I cannot imagine myself wasting another dollar in this place.
2018-05-06,4,Love the baklava; might seem a bit expensive but totally worth it. The falafel sandwich and mixed shawarma are delicious as well (there were too many pickles in the falafel sandwich though :D)
2018-05-06,3,It's your real authentic halal food, very different tasting then the food carts. The seasoning are more rich and herbaceous. I was left a little hungry after ordering the chicken and rice platter. I ordered here in the past (before they moved) and the portions used to be bigger I thought. Regardless it's a great cultural spot with great food to match.
2018-05-03,3,Solid for late night (actually probably my only choice after 10:30 in weekdays) service is good.
2018-05-03,2,I ordered the falafel plate with salad and rice. The only good thing about the plate was the falafel itself and the pita that it came with. The sauce the salad had had no flavor and the rice has cinnamon on it. Needless to say, it wasn't very good at all. And kind of pricey. I would not have minded paying 10$ for a plate of food that is delicious. But that was far, far from being good.
2018-04-25,4,A good clean environment. More upscale for a felafel shop. I like the shawarma sandwich which is lamb. The hot sauce is very spicy so I would recommend using it sparingly. The lamb is tender and juicy, unlike most gyro places. This location in Hoboken is definitely cleaner than Manhattan locations.
2018-04-24,2,Other reviews must never had really good falafel and falafel sandwiches. The pita was sad. You might as well used a flour tortillas, it probably would of been better. The pita was chewy, thin, and weak. It couldn't hold what was in the sandwiches and just collapsed in one bite. There was so much juice in this thing! I had to use all the napkins. The falafel was a bit below adverage. There is a place down the street better. Now close this review and find another spot.
2018-04-20,5,Order shawarma platter with rice and a side of baba ganoush! Put them together and add hot sauce. You will thank me later.
2018-04-20,4,Good food. Cheap. Fast service. They have a sitting but I always do take-out. Can't go wrong with their food. One of my favorite places to take out. I have not tried their sweets yet. Looks good though.
2018-04-15,4,Delivery was quick but $3 delivery fee is a lot. The sandwich was a little soggy, maybe should use less sauce for delivery orders. Also wish they gave more than 1 pita for an order of hummus??
2018-04-08,1,it's not the location, it's the staff.  The service is all over the place and the food just doesn't taste the same anymore.  I used to come to Mamoun's every Wednesday religiously, I've now settled to coming to the original establishment on MacDougal.
2018-04-06,1,We are regulars at this location.  Usually, the service is amazing except for last night.  The manager was extremely rude.  Asked for the shawarma sandwich to be made with no tahini, so it would not get soggy.  She took the order, but when it was ready asked for extra tahini on the side.  The guy behind the counter said there was already tahini on the sandwich, which we specifically asked not to be.  The manager - who took the order - started arguing that we didn't ask for that.  She would also not give extra tahini.  This was a completely different experience that we had a few days prior when the male manager was there.  So nice and helpful, they even brought us our food and plenty of extra tahini with a smile!!!!  And, yes, the sandwiches were soggy by the time we got home...
2018-03-22,5,My go to in Hoboken. Always hits the spot! Never disappointed. The seasoned rice and mint lemonade are great add ons :)
2018-03-19,1,Moved to a new location so prices increased, pita became very modest (never good to save on clients), many mistakes with the order, attitude is -B and most important don't answer to the phone two days in a row. better you handle these issues quickly.
2018-03-05,2,I've experienced much better from this very same place. It's been one of my favorites but something was quite off with this order. I've been feeling sick since I had this food - not sure if I can eat rest of it. Bummer!
2018-03-04,4,I love their food. Only reason I took one star off is I ordered chicken kebab plate and there is little piece of plastic in the pickle. Not sure what it is but it would've be bad if I or my kid ate it. I took it out, other than that, Everything was so yummy
2018-02-28,2,This used to be my late night go to. Not sure what happened after they moved a couple of blocks to their new location? Soggy soggy soggy pita sandwiches. Couldn't even hold it in my hands as it just broke apart. Seems like a bunch of the owners family members are running the show now, and i have to find a new falafel spot. Too bad.
2018-02-26,4,Open late and reasonably priced menu. Incredible hot sauce they bottle and has a spice hotter than most. I've had good and ok experiences here, but never been disappointed.
2018-02-16,5,New spot is just as good as the old! Best place in town for falafel. Super delicious sandwiches as well. Friendly and fast service for high quality eats, highly recommend! Try the pita chips too,for only a dollar more they're well worth it!
2018-02-11,5,I would eat here everyday if I lived closer! Most falafels are dry in the city at random places, these are so moist fresh and flavorful! LOVEEEEEEEE IT!
2018-02-08,5,I love their falafel sandwich, have had it may be more than 100 times. It is still good, however, I feel its smaller now since they have moved to their new location and more pricey. I don't mind paying more price but at least don't make my sandwich smaller and please don't over fill it with lettuce. I have travelled numerous times to hoboken just to have falafel sandwich at this place and my heart breaks now to see my sandwich smaller and overfilled with lettuce. I always order falafel sandwich with baba ghanoush. I will keep visiting this place  since they are so much better than their competitors but would appreciate if they don't overfill my sandwich with lettuce and make it smaller than what it used to be.
2018-02-01,3,Best food, it's a great deal for vegetarians. Lot of options, mix and match everything. Every meal comes will good amount of vegetables. You can grab tasty falafel sandwich for less than 4$. Love this place, always clean moreover friendly staff.Remodeled and now it's really expensive $$$
2018-02-01,1,This place is absolutely terrible. Slow, rude staff that do not listen to your order.1st experience: ordered a chicken bowl over rice. Waited 20 minutes to find out they were OUT OF RICE and they offered me a salad. Listen, salad is a healthier choice but i was craving chicken over rice. They then told me it would be another 20 minutes for the rice. Asked for a refund and swore i would not come back. Seriously how can you run out of rice at a place that centers around rice dishes? 2nd experience: 6 months later i was again craving chicken over rice after a long workout. Ordered two bowls, one half salad and half rice for my GF. The other over rice. I was on the phone with my GF while ordering as my evidence. I was not paying attention to the receipt and once i got home, put on my eating pants to dive in, guess what. THEY PUT IT OVER A SALAD!!!!I called to complain because this was strike 2 out of 2. The manager i spoke with told me i ordered over salad. BS, but wasn't going to fight him over it since that was on the receipt.Avoid this place like the plague. Also, the shawarma sucks.
2018-01-29,4,Mamoun's are open until super late unlike their competitors which is great when drunk Ashleigh decides she wants falafel but the food is just as tasty sober.The hummus is delicious. I used to also really like their baba ghanoush but something must've changed because there's a burnt aftertaste now. I thought it could've been a bad batch but after it happened again a month later I've made the decision to opt out. The fries are also perfect. If you're feelin' wild I suggest dipping them in hummus. ;-) I still haven't had better grape leaves than what Mamoun's offers. You won't either.Their flagship in Manhattan is also great but I'm closer to Hoboken so I can only vouch for this location with absolute consistency. Still, I doubt you could go wrong regardless of location.
2018-01-28,5,We were on family visit to New York and we stopped by the Mamoun's Falafel and it was a perfect decision as the restaurant and service are perfect and delicious highly recommended for anyone planing a visit to New York
2018-01-25,5,This place is so good, whoever gives it bad ratings is clearly butthurt over something petty. The food is great quality and great taste so that justifies the prices. The prices are actually very low. Love this place !!
2018-01-23,5,I had to take a picture of what I ordered because it was amazing and I will be ordering it again. The hot sauce completely erupts flavor in your mouth. Just fantastic. I'll be back.
2018-01-23,5,Take Extreme Caution with a hot sauce. Regardless of how great you think your tolerance for hot dressings are, I would recommend you taste it first before generously soaking whatever it is you ordered in it. The Shwarma platter is the way to go. It comes with tasty shavings of seasoned meat, with rice, and a salad that includes pickles and olives all on one plate. Everything else comes secondary to this.They do offer sandwiches which is the meat stuffed in a half pita or platter, for all the protein options. Vegetarian options are available as well and Beyond Falafel and grape leaves, I'm not really sure what else there is.They also have a section of Middle Eastern desserts all of which are diabetes inducing soaked in honey almond and other pistachio related goodness.For drinks they have juices available with flavors such as mango and Tamarind, as well as ice tea options.
2018-01-20,1,Decided to try this place since they moved to a new location.  Definitely much cleaner than old digs, but food is bleh.  I probably should have thrown it out.Bread is out of a supermarket package.  Chicken and rice is greasy with no flavor.  Do not recommend.
2018-01-12,5,The hummus and falafel sandwich is delicious and not to mention super cheap! Also, their hot is to die for.
2018-01-12,2,Decent chicken kebabs. Be careful of the hot sauce. I basically ruined my meal because it was unbearably hot. I typically love spicy food but if you use this hot sauce, use VERY little.
2018-01-12,5,This place is great. Great taste. Great experience. Great value.Go there! and try the dessert if your diet permits.
2018-01-11,5,Better than the other Mamoun locations I've tried. I've tried the New Brunswick and New York locations, and this one was so much better than the other two! I love the hummus and olives!!! I had the vegetable falafel and I was contemplating ordering another one to take with me!
2018-01-04,1,Mamoun's - what happened? I have been a loyal Mamoun's patron for over 17 years - since the days of skipping high school classes to visit the one in Middletown, CT, which isn't even open anymore! From that one to New Haven to both NYC villages and Hoboken, I've always praised the quality and price of the menu. Recently, the Hoboken location moved from Washington/5th to Washington/3rd. I'm not sure what happened during this move, but the price went up and the quality plummeted. Tonight I ordered the Mamoun's Salad with a side of falafel and a side of the pickled veggies/olives. The price cost at least $5 more total than it usually would and the salad was half the size - I was upset to see that my now $8 salad was an appetizer rather than an entree. Additionally, the size of falafel, which per the menu should have been 4 pieces, only came with 3 -- again paying more and getting less. Although the falafel itself was tasty, the sad salad lacked. It came soggy and the olives/pickled vegetables tasted... off. What used to be my favorite part, the pickled turnips, were flappy and looked as though they were sitting around a bit too long. The olives tasted sour and spoiled. My heart breaks to write this as I've been eating Mamoun's for most my life. Are you ordering your product from a new source? Is this a franchise and they're not properly maintaining the quality? Please help me understand why this was such a terrible experience!
2017-12-29,5,This is the best Mediterranean food I have ever eaten. Although it is a little spicy but the taste is so good that spice feels good. Facility is very clean and service is awesome.
2017-12-27,3,This place was open on Christmas Eve! The only one on like the whole street :)Came here after getting locked out of my apt ^^ Got the Bleecker sandwich, which had kebab and falafel and tomatoes and onions and tasted great..buuut the problem was my stomach started hurting right after eating it :( I had a stomach issue last week so probably it happened just because my stomach is still sensitive, but still - was unfortunate I didn't get to finish. Apparently there's another Mamoun's in East Village that's good for after going out, too :)
2017-12-15,5,I've been going to Mamoun's for many years and absolutely love this place. I've had pretty much everything on the menu and it's all delicious. With that said, the Kafta Kebob platter with salad and rice is my go-to dish. Get some hot sauce on the side, pop open a bottle of Syrah, and you're golden! Enjoy!!!
2017-12-09,5,As soon as you walk into Mamoun's you feel like you're at home. The music along with the employees give the restaurant such a warm, familial vibe. If you live by Hoboken, you better come to Mamoun's for some of the most authentic Middle Eastern food I've ever had. Amazing shawarma, amazing falafel, amazing service, and amazing atmosphere.
2017-12-08,5,When I first walked into the restaurant I was overwhelmed by the warm environment. The aromas of the falafels struck my face like a strong left hook from Mike Tyson. The food was the bomb.com and the service was spot on. I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone in the Hoboken area, you won't be disappointed.
2017-12-07,3,Been a customer of mamouns for years and today was my first time in the new location. The inside is spectacular and the service was amazing. That being said, the sandwich I've been getting since I've been going tastes MUCH different in this new *hipper* location. I'm not sure if the old recipe got lost in the old location but I'm kindve upset about this! The new locations sandwich was wet as hell and I needed like 12 napkins for each bite. I looked like the fat kid in Matilda who was eating the chocolate cake at my desk at work during my lunch. I'm gunna keep coming here but please go back to how you used to prepare the sandwiches!
2017-12-01,1,Seamless quoted 55-65 minutes for delivery.  After waiting over 2 hours, I canceled the order.  Falafel is never worth 2 hours.
2017-11-28,5,Looks like they gave their interior a make cover to look more modern and fast casual. The food is still as good as the first time I ate it. They have the freshest shawarma (no grey meat here) and they give you a lot of it. Their falafel is amazing as well as their baba ghanouj! Yummmy!
2017-11-28,4,Great food for before an evening out or after a late night. The falafel is juicy with a good amount of veggies + sauce. BIG fan of chicken kabob sandwich...the chicken kabob is very flavorful with various spices. Try their tamarind drink, it's refreshing after a sandwich.
2017-11-22,5,Just checked out their new location, gorgeous inside and great service as usual. New menu options also, sandwich and plate combinations. I had the Manhattan sandwich. Probably the best tasting and most satisfying vegetarian meal I've ever had. I will be going more regularly!
2017-11-20,4,This is my goto late night meal. Their portions are quite large for the money and they are open super late. Occasionally they will forget bits of our orders or refuse to walk up to our apartment to deliver. Otherwise they are spot on. Tons of vegetarian options. I like all the pickled veggies that come with their platters. Just be aware that the hot sauce is seriously spicy.
2017-11-18,4,Very good! Shawarma pita with a side of falafel is my go to! Mint lemonade is fantastic as well. Hummus is fresh and flavorful. Hot sauce is super hot. Staff is not super friendly and it's a little unorganized which accounts for the 4 star rating. Aside from that, the menu is great and I always come back for a quick lunch when I'm in town!
2017-11-16,2,They barely give you any meat. Very underwhelming I do not recommend. Halal carts in NYC are 10x better
2017-11-10,2,Weird baba ganoush and not in a good way.  Have only ordered takeout and the falafel was burnt (tasted okay), the baba ganoush was weird, and the bread was just your generic store bought pita bread.  Everything went into the garbage after a few bites.   Doubtful if I would return.
2017-11-10,4,Mamoun's is an NYC institution (oldest falafel restaurant in the city, says the website), so I was ecstatic to finally try it, ironically enough, in Hoboken. We ordered through Grubhub and walked over to the restaurant. Our order had been prepared for picking up, but the guy working kindly offered to convert it to dining in. We sat outside and listened to the dulcet tones of the homeless man loudly conversing with himselfBeing a starved Mamoun's newbie, I settled on the meat plate for $12. You get to select your choice of meat and three veggie sides, along with either rice or salad, plus pitas. They should rename it the newbie combo, yeah right? Anyway, I picked out shawarma, fool mudammas (a fava bean salad), tabbouleh, baba ganouj, salad, and a whole wheat pita. Both my stomach and tastebuds were quite satisfied. The baba ganouj especially stood out, with a well-defined, smoky flavor.For sipping, I ordered the house spiced black iced tea (~$2). It's made with cardamom and was reviving after a long day. The mint lemonade also earned praise from my companions.This Mamoun's is actually moving two blocks south, still on Washington. It's also open past midnight every night of the week and later on weekends. Glad to have finally tried Mamoun's!
2017-11-07,5,This is basically simple Mediterranean food at a very reasonable price. My falafel sandwich was only $3.50 and you get plently for that price. Their falafel is green with great flavors It comes with tahini on the side too. If you try their hot sauce, use very little! Their service is good and food comes our quick. Always seems busy too. There is seating outside for nicer days.
2017-10-18,5,Best falafel I ever had and this place is listed in a book called 1000 places to visit before you die. Staff are cool. The place is clean. Their blackberry juice a BOMB.
2017-10-14,1,I didn't think it was possible for this place to get any worse, but somehow they have managed.  Now, in addition to poor quality food, they have added the feature of getting the order wrong more often than not.  I have given this place many chances, but now I am done.
2017-10-09,5,Nice spot. I really enjoyed the chicken kebab platter. The chicken was soft and juicy as it should be. The falafel balls are amazing as well. You could tell it's authentically made. Will be back to try more items on the menu.
2017-09-29,2,This place used to be great. Far cry from the city version. When it first open in Hoboken original crew was great. Service and quality has slipped as new staff brought in. I've eaten at both locations probably 40 times each. Writing this is painful.
2017-09-21,4,This was a five star place for me since I came to the area.  An exact replication at least in terms of the food of the flagship in NYC.  The hummus, baba, falafel, and proteins are always great. I recommend the shawarma far and away with the chicken a considerable second and the kafta is passable but usually a little tough. The best part is they're open well past the closing of bars on weekends. So you have a great ethnic option besides the Spa diner and meh pizza late night.I've docked it a star because they seem to have changed management. Everything seems a little more exact(in a streamlined corporate way) . Portions a bit smaller. Every employee I used to know and who knew me by name has vanished. Food is still very good... It just seems slightly off. Take that with a grain of salt because it's likely you won't have the intimate local connection to the place that I do.
2017-09-20,4,Get the shawarma, babaganoush, hummus, salad, and KNAFE. The girl at the counter told me chicken was her fave but I think the lamb choices are the way to go. The hairy little dessert knafe (kuh-naf-ee) was voted unanimously over their baklava.
2017-09-17,1,You just lost a customer with changing the places you deliver to. I don't understand how after 3 years delivering to Zephyr Loft by Observer, you choose not to continue. Oh well, there are other Lebanese, Mediterranean food to order. Your loss.
2017-09-15,4,We tried the falafel sandwich and the chicken kebab sandwich. The sandwiches were reasonably priced at $3.50 for the falafel and $6.50 for the chicken kebab, but note that the sandwiches are very small. The sandwiches came with lettuce, onions, tomatoes, tahini sauce in a pita pocket. Ask for the hot sauce to add a kick to your sandwich. Both the falafel and chicken kebab were tasty and had good flavor, but just wish there was more more meat/falafel in each sandwich. We will be back to try the plates. We were there on a week day night but there were still a decent amount of people eating in and lots of people waiting for take out. They have outdoor seating which makes a great option for a cheap, casual dinner in the summer.
2017-09-08,5,Fala-fill my belly with goodness! Well, I got the shawarma but that doesn't have as many good jokes.I went with the shawarma sandwich as opposed to the plate, mostly because the sandwich is $6.75 and the plate is $12. I'm not sure what's the on the plate but I couldn't justify the price.Shawarma comes with lettuce, onions, tomatoes, sauce and meat. I added feta because when life presents you with the option to add feta, you add feta. It was a super tasty and deceptively filling sandwich. Highly recommend.Ps, they no longer have spinach pie. Not that you care, but it's on the menu.Pps, I think it's open late night. If I lived in Hoboken and I was a somewhere between a few casual drinks and take my clothes and off and soil the carpets drunk, I would come in there and have them pop falafel balls into my mouth like I was a kid on the Bozo Show throwing balls into the bucket.
2017-09-07,5,their shawarma sandwich is amazing. that's the only thing I tried here. it was so good, I ordered another one lmao  also tried their specialty blackberry juice which was good too
2017-08-30,5,This is the best falafel place I have been too! Love their falafel and  babaganoush. You also must try the knafe and bacalava.. there are delicious. Don't forget to order a lemonade along with the food!
2017-08-20,5,I'm a regular and love every single item on your menu! My favorite is the platter with lamb, hummus, babaganoush with rice and pickles. This place is open late which is awesome because it's a healthier option when eating too late! Love this place!
2017-08-20,1,Saw rats and the workers didn't care to address the fact that I saw rats. I saw one rat. Then a second rat. Told the worker and the worker told me I was mistaken. Then I saw the two rats once again. I love the food but the fact they rats exist in their restaurant makes me think twice about eating there.
2017-08-19,2,well, been going to this place since it opened in Hoboken.  Went this evening.  wasn't very busy for 1130pm.  Food however wasn't that great and I have been here lots of times before.  Haven't been at this location in ~ 3yrs.  Firstly, the lady at the register didn't seem to happy to be working that evening...Reana?? I ordered the veggie combo - falafel, baba and hummus to go.  when I got home, which isn't to far from the restaurant, I didn't see/notice any baba and I believe there was a falafel inside. I was told in the past, "what do you expect for a $4.50 sandwich at 11pm.  The restaurant is catering to drinking/drunk crowd who doesn't care for the quality of the food.  They are just looking for any food to soak up the alcohol".  I certainly understand that statement now.  Falafel sandwiches are basic street food in the Middle East served to perfection any time of the day or nite.  I certainly miss that experience. I had broccoli in my falafel as a part of the sandwich, which I never had before in the 30+yrs eating these sandwiches and the overall sandwich was VERY basic.  The falafel sandwich I make at home with the salad was far superior.  Next time I get a late nite craving for a falafel sandwich, I will take the PATH to TAIM in the west village.  This Israeli place is always consisted...day or nite.
2017-08-17,5,Mamoun's never fails and their service is so good! Every time I come here it tastes the same if not better. I will recommend this place to everyone who enjoys a good bite.
2017-08-12,5,Nice small place very affordable very fast service good seating outside love this place specially try their desert it's only $2 they don't have anything for breakfast but rather than that they have good verity for lunch and dinner love it!!
2017-08-09,5,best shawarma and falafel! parking is the only issue but well worth the hassle!
2017-08-07,4,My parents and I LOVE this place! Every time they go to Hoboken they eat here, and every time I go they ask me to bring some back for them. The falafel balls are nice and crispy on the outside but as we're even more in love with their hot sauce. It's super tangy and strong so you only need a couple of drops but wouldn't eat our food with out it. Sometimes we get the baklava too which is also bomb
2017-08-02,5,The. Best. Hummus. Easily the greatest stop in Hoboken for fast and delicious food. The mango juice and falafel sandwiches make my heart sing. Baklava is mana from heaven. Late night on the town? Forget the greasy slice and head to 5th and Washington!
2017-07-26,4,When I need a quick meal, I go here for takeout or just eat at the restaurant. I've gotten delivery a few times before but the food isn't warm by the time it gets to you. For years, I only tried their classic FALAFEL sandwich, but last year I tried the LAMB SHWARMA and fell in love. It's a big spicy, but so filling and just so tasty. I also get a side of the GRAPE LEAVES and some BABA GANOUSH. The Hoboken location is a lot bigger than any of the locations in the city with ample seating. It's pretty crowded even late a night. Price is good. Taste is delicious. Definitely a fan.
2017-07-20,4,I have been here many times. Kebab, falalfal, baklava are great. They have enough seating compared to manhatten one. Serveice is quite good. Location is perfect in Hoboken.
2017-07-18,4,I like their falafel sandwich - it's decent enough to satisfy my craving and hunger. I think there are other places with falafel sandwiches that stand out way more in taste but for $3.50 this is a good deal! I haven't tried their other items. Overall, the inside of this restaurant is clean and looks nice.
2017-07-17,5,Visiting from out of town & I really wanted some Mediterranean food and this came up as a recommendation. This was within walking distance & I wasn't disappointed. I got the sharwarma plate with three sides, but I'd recommend getting it as a sandwich and asking for the sides to be put into individual containers if possible. I say this because by the time I walked back to my hotel my sides had mixed together & it was a bit messy. I didn't realize they weren't in separate containers. I only ate all of the falafels and not the tabbouleh or hummus because the portions are really generous. The blackberry juice was delicious!! I wish I would've ordered a larger size. Their spicy sauce is great and offered the kick that I like (don't be heavy handed with it!). Definitely give them a try!
2017-07-14,1,disappointed my visit today, got baklava to go , and it was below par, it tasted as if the oil was messed up the distinct smell ,as if the oil was reused.I had a messed up throat after that .Mamoun's has been go to place for falafelAnd baklava , i  wud occasionally drive to Hoboken to eat here , for now I will be staying away from there !!
2017-07-14,1,Can I give a zero star?? Disgusting baklava. We use to like Mamouns food but the quality haa gone down really bad. We picked up baklsva from this location, it smelled of old oil and was loaded with syrup. It irritated our throats real bad and caused major irritation. The oil used was old and totally disgustung taste. God knows what they use. No more Mamouns again. Please avoid for health reasons.
2017-07-09,5,Stopped in for lunch with kids. My 6 year old couldn't get enough of the chicken Kebob and the schawarma was to die for. Would be here all the time if I lived closer.
2017-07-09,4,Love their falafel sandwich, get it with tabouleh! I would say their meat kebabs are average but not bad. Get the tamarind juice, very delicious! Overall, reasonably priced and the perfect spot for late-night food.
2017-06-19,1,We went there yesterday afternoon. The cashier with glasses had a really unfriendly and cold attitude towards us.. we did not know what we did wrong?? She looked like she did not want to help us order food... The food in that place is very very salty too.... not a healthy option
2017-06-15,2,Don't bother placing an order online. They won't make it until you get there. Friendly girl at the counter, at least.
2017-06-10,5,I was so excited when I was moving back up to the NYC area to discover this Mamoun's in Hoboken! It's our go to spot for ordering take out and we always stock up on the hummus. The hot sauce is AMAZING, but watch out, it'll sneak up on you.
2017-06-04,5,I grew up eating Mamouns on MacDougle street, so I was very excited to see a second location open in Hoboken.  I think I've been to all of the falafel joints in Hoboken and Jersey City, and Mamouns has the tastiest and most moist falafel hands down. Prices are also better than the competition. The menu has meat kebob, sandwich, and platter options with a few different sides to chose from. And their hot sauce is the best.
2017-06-03,5,Hello... its a known fact that Mamoun's has the  absolute best falafels and Mediterranean style platters. Everything there is sooo good and fresh. The prices are great and the service is very quick. The place is open really late so whatever time the munchies invade you, a trip to Mamouns is always a smart option. Please try the mint lemonade, falafel in pita, lamb shawarma, veggie or meat platters and the pastries are also all delicious.
2017-06-01,5,Honestly, the hardest part about moving out of Hoboken was not being able to have my weekly mamouns. The falafel is actually perfect, and I only have ever done delivery so the fact it could withstand a decent car ride is impressive. It's an amazing hangover meal but still good at any hour of any day. If you live in Hoboken and don't eat mamouns you should reconsider your life approach because you're clearly doing it wrong
2017-05-28,3,Goto place during all nighters at NYU's library. They certainly don't serve the best falafel in town, but good enough for the price (which is on the cheaper side)
2017-05-26,3,I was excited to try this place due to all the great reviews. I wasn't blown away though. The service was quick despite the fact they were backed up. I got a meat plate with chicken for 15 dollars. No joke, only 4 cubes of chicken .. tons of rice and salad. I was disappointed at the amount of meat on my plate especially for the price. From the few pieces of chicken I tasted, I must say it's well seasoned and tender. Their mint lemonade was really good though.
2017-05-19,4,great value for a quick bite!quick and always consistent service.outdoor seating comes in handy too.
2017-05-18,5,I always wanted to try this and so finally I did!!! It was delish!!!! And the cashier and server was very nice to accomodate a new face and gave me time to answer a lot of questions about their food!
2017-05-17,3,Food is not as good as it used to be. Service at the counter is just nothing but some buff show off kinda guys. Ordered for pick up and arrived about 10 minutes just to have to wait another 15 mins for a chix plate and a sandwich. Just because hubby likes their hot sauce and their overly dry meat, otherwise I would def not be back.
2017-05-15,2,BEWARE:Mamoun's conducted a nearly fraudulent charge on my credit card. They snuck in a new delivery fee without telling me, then also put a tip on my card without my knowledge. I always tip the delivery person $3 to $5, so I'm surprised that they would stoop to such deceptive tactics to extract more money.Combine this with the food poisoning I've heard about recently, and it is not likely I will be handing these crooks money any longer. Food can be great at times (even though the portions are TINY), but it's not worth enabling these sorts of mistakes.
2017-05-12,4,This place just doesn't disappoint. The original location is in Manhattan. I had just a touch of doubt but I was proven completely wrong. Just as good as the one in the village. Delicious falafel and shawarma seasoned just right.  I was craving some middle eastern food and this place never fails to please. Keep up the great work.
2017-04-20,5,hot sauce i insanely HOT!!!  be warnedfood is awesome , service is good. definitely love this place
2017-04-17,5,Veggie wraps are $3.50, meat wraps are $6. The meat wraps are too small and not worth the buck, so just go for the veggie wraps. Make sure to ask for their hot sauce. Reasonably priced baklava.
2017-04-16,4,Had come here twice. Had falafel sandwich, mint lemonade and the veggie combo (baba ganoush, falafel, hummus with salad and pita bread).Reasonably priced and was tasty too.Would love to visit again.
2017-04-15,4,Good falafel store with a good amount of seating.Located in the middle of town on Washington St. It's a bit of a walk from Hoboken terminal, but it's well worth it.I've been here a few times for some falafel sandwiches. Pretty reasonably priced at $3.50. The falafel sandwiches here are a pretty good size. They're filled more with veggies than falafel, but the pita is packed.I've also tried the seasoned rice and the mint lemonade. Both go well with the falafel sandwich.The place is relatively clean and spacious. There is usually seating available, and if there isn't, there is enough turnover at this place, where in about 5 minutes a seat will open up, if you wait. Orders come out pretty quick, so takeout is a breeze. It gets pretty packed in here sometimes, but the line moves pretty quickly.
2017-04-14,3,One of the perfect places to eat for a college student like me. Late hours, not TOO expensive, good range of options and combinations. I really enjoy the food here, even if I know it doesn't taste authentic. It's perfect for someone whose taste buds are unfortunately being Americanized.I guess one of the main cons would be the portions. I have to order extra of whatever I'm getting because it never fills me up. i.e. Extra falafel on my veggie platter, because three little balls of falafel are not going to fill up a big girl like me.Their baklava is satisfactory. I would recommend it unless you know of a bakery that specializes in them.
2017-04-08,1,Awful.  Way overpriced for salty tasteless food.  The food has no flavor, the falafels are hard inside and the prices are three times higher than they should be. Skip it!
2017-03-29,4,The food is definitely one of the top Mediterranean in this area. The ambience needs improvement. I have gone here on a cold night and the heater does not work. This has happened multiple times. They need to be able to provide basic temperature control.
2017-03-28,5,Mammoun's is making falafel great again...Shawarma too! They also have the hot sauce from hell.
2017-03-27,3,The food is good here. I can not complain about anything I have eaten. However, whenever I walk into this place, the smell is overbearing and awful. I can't seem to get myself to eat there!
2017-03-22,1,I "used" to be a Mamouns fan and have been ordering once or twice almost every week. This past month something has 100% changed. Their quality of chicken is terrible and barely seasoned. Additionally they have become extremely cheap giving 2 pieces of pita on $45.00 order which includes a large order of hummus and 2 platters. Very disappointed this place is going down hill. Eventually the rest of Hoboken will catch on and go somewhere else. RIP Mamouns Hoboken you were good while it lasted.
2017-03-21,4,Love this place. Frat falafel and shawarma.Been eating in the downtown location since 93 and it's still the same good food.
2017-03-21,4,Probably one of the better shawarma places around. Nice staff, awesome hot sauce but parking is a bitch. Overall great place and tasty food. If you haven't tried and are in Hoboken, go there..especially after a fun night out.
2017-03-21,5,Waiting for 30 minutes for one falafel sandwich while they are just preparing deliveries. Horrible service. **************edited review********The manager contacted me and made sure that they will try to fix such issue. I really appreciate that feedback. Food is great there
2017-03-18,5,Love this place.  Came at 3am and they had a long line.  Food worth the wait.  Excellent falafel.  I also had the shawerma which was very tasty.  Hot sauce is fire so only use a little bit.   Cheap convenient and delicious.   Gotta try it if you r in the area.  They open real late so no reason not to try it.  Infamous food joint
2017-03-15,4,Mamoun's is the go to spot when I'm hungry and I don't know what to eat or it's late. You can never go wrong with the shawarma sandwich and a mango juice. Just make sure you get extra meat because all you're going to have left at the bottom of the sandwich is a salad. With that being said if you're a person who enjoys both a shawarma sandwich with a side salad it's basically the best of both worldsAlso one of the reasons I love coming here is the old school Arabic music they play.
2017-03-11,2,Not sure what happened to this place, but everything has gone downhill. I drove all the way from Belleville to get my fix and boy was it a disaster. I ordered the lamb shawarma and chicken kebob combo plate with rice and salad. I asked if the salad could be put on the side, because sometimes the lettuce gets soggy on the ride home. The cashier quickly shut me down and told me it couldn't be done. We get home and begin to eat and everything tasted like it was rewarmed from the night before. The chicken was dry as hell, the rice was mushy, the lamb was heavily salted, and the pickles had an odd taste. The only thing that saved the day was the mint lemonade. Gone are the days where you got a whole bag of pitas and a surplus of food. Not sure what is happening here but they need to fix their issues quickly. I may give them another try in a couple of months, but I am definitely going to search for alternatives.
2017-03-06,5,Good food for that price and place, Falafel is Okay but other stuff pretty delicious.Big portion if you order a plate.
2017-02-28,5,The lamb was perfect. Cash only though. I loved the smell the second i went inside. It smells like a true middle eastern restaurant.
2017-02-28,5,HOLY COW! This is the definition of fast casual eating. The place is immaculate, always clean, every time all the time! The food is cooked to order and is out faster than a fast food chain. Plus the hot sauce is to DIE for! The intensity is definitely there but it's accompanied by great flavor, it's not just spicy.
2017-02-26,4,Delicious food. My new go to in Hoboken, free delivery too! Kind of slow service but worth the wait. Only reason I'm taking away a star is how SALTY everything is, make sure to hydrate well before and after!
2017-02-23,3,Love the food here been a customer for a while. But today I ordered a falafel sandwhich with a chicken skewer and to my amazement the chicken look like they took 2 cubes of chicken and cut them in 3s . I was shocked that i had to say something i thought they had to be a mistake. I was like this is 5 bucks? The guy at the counter was like yes. I said this is impossible. It wasnt enuff for a 2 year old. The manager came over and told me that they had made a mistake preparing the chicken from the night before. They guy at the register was clearly a moron and didnt care to help cause it was clearly a mistake. They gave me a another order.
2017-02-22,5,Came to maamouns with my good friend Ramsey. I love maamouns but dont really enjoy the Hoboken crowd or lack of parking in the area. However my friend didn't seem open to eating anywhere else. Lucky for him we found parking right out front otherwise I would have left him there and went home. All jokes aside I love maamouns and visit frequently. The chicken kebob sandwhich is what I normally get and would recommend. If you have an appetite one sandwhich might not be enough so I suggest two or a platter. Another must have is the blackberry juice which I use to wash down my distaste for Hoboken when I go. The service is fast without having an impact on the quality and the workers are always quite pleasant. Seating can be tough during busy times but they have outdoor seating to accommodate. If you're in the mood for some good Arabic food and can endure the pretentious Hoboken atmosphere for a short while make your way to maamouns.
2017-02-16,5,I go to Mamoun's often for a cheap falafel sandwich. My most recent experience was ordering their delivery. The food came fresh and delicious, and the delivery was very quick. Overall a great experience every time and reasonably priced.
2017-02-14,1,The lamb patties are really dry and disgusting. My food was cold and the delivery took forever. Maybe this place is better in person...at least the food would be warm. I'm really disappointed that I waited well over 1.5 hours for something that didn't even taste good. The food was wrapped in foil, so I couldn't microwave it because the work cafeteria had already closed. Complete failure.
2017-02-12,5,Delicious, good quality, and fast delivery! I've ordered from Mamouns four times. The flavor and quality has been consistently great. Love their veggie options!
2017-02-09,5,Just received my delivery on time in this weather! I got lucky to be within the delivery zone, barely made it. The hummus...to die for!!! I almost ate the Tupperware, the blend between olive oil and just the right amount of paprika was amazing. We have the lamb shawarma and the chicken kebab sandwiches; right portions and superb flavor, specially the chicken! Baklava: super delicious! Thanks guys, highly recommended!!!
2017-02-08,2,Wasn't impressed. I am a big fan of Mediterranean food and really didn't like this place. One of my favorite sides is baba ghanouj (the eggplant dip) and it tasted as if it was mixed w mayonnaise which is completely how it shouldn't taste. The shawarma and tabouli were ok not the greatest. The falafels I didn't like.
2017-02-03,4,It's so good in here and cheap. I've had the falafel sandwich and the plate and I've also eaten the rice off of my friends plate it was ok. It's really flavorful the falafels. Depending on the time you go obviously it will be a lot more packed in the evenings to the point where you might not get a table. Oh and I've also had the knafe and the baklava hopefully I'm speeding it correctly and they were both good
2017-02-02,1,Wow! I've been living in Hoboken for 4+ years. I used to love mamouns but the last time I went was horrible. I walked in to order takeout and had two other friends with me. Everyone else got what they asked for in their order but unfortunately I did not get the baklava that I ordered and paid for. I only noticed when I got home and I didn't have the receipt because this place is usually reliable!!  I called to give feedback and the person on the phone said he saw his colleague add the item into my bag and that there was nothing he could do for me!!! He basically dismissed my claim (rudely!)I miss old management of this place! They also skimped on the pita bread they give you with platters. Ew.
2017-01-31,5,Always consistent and delicious! My favorites are the falafel and kafta kebob! Their mango juice is also delicious!
2017-01-24,5,My go to restaurant every time I miss home. It's still nothing compared to authentic middle eastern shawarma but it will do! Come here for a quick bite or just pick up falafel on the go. It's not oily which is a big plus!
2017-01-19,4,Food is absolutely delicious! Love it. Decent eat-in place. They are a very popular spot and tend to be consistently busy, but we have never had an issue finding a table. Friendly staff. Only downside, they don't deliver more than 2 miles into Jersey city.
2017-01-18,5,The best, most consistent delivery in Hoboken run by good guys who do their best to get everything right. How many chicken kebob platters have I had? Never enough. Get the rice and pickled veg and a side of falafel. Best deal in town.
2017-01-17,5,Food was great! And thanks for letting my friends and I play Dungeons and Dragons at the corner table!
2017-01-12,4,Got a basic falafel with hummus and a ginger ale. Wrapping was a little leaky but the food tasted great!
2017-01-09,4,My friends were super excited when this place opened up during our senior year of college. It's a small fast food type place, where they take your order, and you pick it up to go or eat in their small dining area. The menu is relatively small, and pretty cheap (prices have gone up a bit since they first opened), but of course you'd get a much better value elsewhere (Paterson). But they do have my favorite lamb shawarma sandwich, ever, along with some of the spiciest hot sauce that has decent flavor. Their falafel is pretty good, but overpriced. And their specialty drinks are also good. It's great that they're open til 2am or later, in case you want drunk food other than pizza.
2017-01-01,2,This screams yuppieEATS all the way. Unfortunately there is no form of authenticity in this place. To begin, the cooks are Asian and Hispanic, not middle eastern. The food was basic and nothing compared to other places. Prices are fair. Plenty of tables inside and outdoor seating. Ordered a meat plate, wasn't impressed. Didn't enjoy the rice, tasted old and microwaved and the Kafta kebob was a bit salty. Hummus was served in such a small container, barely enough for one person. Nice staff behind the counter, but I wouldn't come back again. * Ali baba is just up the block and much more authentic than here.... Really wished I had a better experience, prices are fair and picking up a sandwich every now and then wouldn't have been such a bad idea.
2017-01-01,5,This place is a a hidden gem. Their shawarma and falafel is so much better then the famous tasteless "food truck" falafel. Their meat is seasoned perfectly. I've eaten allot of shawarma all over the world and this one is one of the best so far. Do not hesitate and try it!
2016-12-28,4,Reliable for falafel - not quite the Fan of their lamb. For the price, cleanliness and quick service makes a great lunch spot!
2016-12-25,5,I love their food, specially because I'm a vegetarian. Everything is fresh and very tasty. They offer fast service and they are open until late. (Let's not forget their great prices) They have the best hot sauce. It makes me cry every time, it never fails!
2016-12-21,3,It is an okay place that is obviously overrated as it is located in a hippy area like Hoboken and is cheaper compared to other restuarants. I tried the lamb platter and the baklava pastry. The bread was so dry and hard that I had to tear it apart with both hands. Lamb meat was dry and rubbery and some of the veg sides had too much salt in it. The mint lemonade and the pastry were good. Left unsatisfied overall, not going back.
2016-12-19,5,Delicious falafel for sure!!! I wish mammouns was closer to me because I think I'd eat it once a week! Come open one in Bergen county!
2016-12-08,5,I love this place!  Its open late, serves great food with no frills.  The shish kebob plate and tebboulah are awesome!
2016-12-05,4,Great late night spot! Open until 5 am and has much cleaner food than anything else open Late at night. Delicious falafel and hummus.  Inexpensive and has vegetarian options. Can't wait to go back and try another dish.
2016-12-04,3,Food was pretty good, but a chicken combo platter for $12 with six pieces of chicken is a bit of a rip. Need to up their portions a little bit. Mango smoothie is rad.
2016-11-28,5,MAMOUN'S! Love this place, and the sister restaurant in New Brunswick.Food 5/5: Authentic, delicious, big portions...you can't go wrong ordering anything from the menu here.Service 4/5: I've never had an issue with my order, food comes out decently fast but during busy nights you can sometimes wait 40 minutes.Atmosphere 4/5: It's not a huge restaurant, so seating is limited and when you wait for food you sometimes have to wait outside.
2016-11-20,4,Highly recommend the falafel sandwiches! They are delicious, healthy, cheap, and filling! My only complaint that the lentil soup isn't great and the pita they served it with tasted store bought.
2016-11-15,4,Great place and it never fails to fill me up and leave with a smile on my face. Pretty good prices as well i usually get the shawarma sandwhich and falafels.
2016-10-29,4,I've never eaten in the restaurant but I order to go. The food is always good and is at a great price. I never have to wait long for the food and the staff is very nice.
2016-10-24,4,Mamouns is a New York City classic. Picture it- Greenwich Village, 1996Many hungry nights I'd find myself on MacDougal in the village super hungry and five dollars maybe to get something to eat. It was easier to find food for $5 in the 90's in NYC...but I didn't want Grays Papaya or pizza.And always open, always a line and always delicious. A falafel sandwich. Near perfect pita, mind blowing falafel- and the perfect balance of creamy tehina and crunchy salad.My experience in Hoboken wasn't much different. Though I had more than $5, and ordered food to go...everything was as you'd expect. Hot, flavorful and very much made with love and intention. I was a little disappointed in the baklava- but really that's not what I came for.The falafel was perfect, the shawarma was excellent and the salad and rice made the whole meal feel complete.As always, I'll be back to mamouns for a meal that doesn't disappoint.
2016-10-23,2,On Washington Street and all around there is no parking to be found any day and specially on week ends.  I ordered around 10 and reached there at 10.44 and being double parked first I had to wait in line to pay and then was told few minutes. While I was waiting for my order I decided to peak outside and I saw a cop standing behind my car. I had to run take a spin around a couple of blocks and again come and double park. This time I ran inside and my order bag was ready. I went home and noticed they forgot to give me extra Tahini sauce and hot sauce which I had requested while paying. The food was ok but not worth the wait and the risk of getting a ticket. You can better shawarma on the streets of NY. The whole idea of ordering 45 minutes early was to not having to wait.
2016-10-21,3,food was great for the price. I had the lamb kebab and it was very good. my friend had the lamb gyro wrap and he liked it very much.  the only problem was that they charged us for a full salad even though we ordered and got a small one and they didn't give a lot of white sauce. Venue could have been nicer
2016-10-18,5,I love to eat here when I am drunk, preparing to get drunk or nursing my body back to its elite shape after being drunk. Hoboken is a better place because of this offering.
2016-10-05,4,I mean... this IS the place you go  falafel, shwarma, kebabs, and the like! Falafel isn't really my cup of tea so I've gotten kebabs and shwarma here a few times. The prices are reasonable and they really fill up those pitas. My one gripe is that the last time I got olives in my pita, they had pits in them so I ended up biting into an olive pit - OUCH! I usually get delivery which is quick, but its friendly and cozy in the shop. Fine for a quick meal.
2016-09-29,5,Every once in a while I'll get a Mamoun's craving and after I finally get some, I end up craving it again and again for the weeks following. Seriously, it feels like I have to stay away for at least 2 months or else I'll be thinking about getting their shawarma at lease twice a week.So good! SO cheap! And the hot sauce!!!
2016-09-28,4,Everything on the menu is absolutely delicious. A little bit more pricey than i'd like but it's worth every penny. Perfect after a night out in Hoboken. Fast service too!
2016-09-25,3,Food is ok but portions are small for price. If the yardstick is the Halal Guys then they are about par on taste (ok but not great), but fall short on portions and price. For about what it costs to get a pita sandwich here you get a whole plate there.
2016-09-18,5,When it comes to Arabic style gyros and falafel sandwiches, Mamoun's is one of the best around.  I love the location, it's right in the heart of Hoboken.  You can take a nice walk afterwards down Washington St and enjoy Hoboken's amazing vibe.  I highly recommend Mamoun's if you're looking for some GOOD Middle Eastern (Arabian) fast food.  Two Thumbs Up, you guys rock!  Keep up the good work!
2016-09-17,5,I've never been a big falafel fan... UNTIL MAMOUN'S. Herby and light, Mamoun's makes some of the best falafel I've ever tasted. After a day of walking in the city and getting small bites to eat here and there, we came back to Hoboken where our car was parked and decided to get Mamoun's. We got one of their platters--meant for one person but we shared--with shwarma, baba ganoush, hummus, and falafel along with salad and a pita and then another side order of grape leaves.Both the shwarma and the falafel were perfect, they had great seasoning and came with a heaping pile of shwarma. If you like falafel and you're considering getting this option to sample the popular choices I'd suggest getting another side order of falafel if you like it. Ours only came with three, and I would have ordered a little more if I was hungrier. I've had better baba ganoush, but this was good enough. The hummus was incredibly creamy and so delicious! There's a paltry salad, but I really can't even complain since the rest of it was so good. The grape leaves were the cheapest I've seen them and a great little appetizer.
2016-09-13,4,Excellent and consistent Food. Falafel and babaganoush are delicious. Delivery is always on time and food is hot. It is our family's go to take out.
2016-09-12,3,Reliable option for late night eats.  This is probably the largest location around this area.  I believe there's another site down in Princeton, but haven't got the chance to check that out yet.Got the combo plate with extra portion of meat.  I know that they are priced pretty decent, but the meat portion was a bit on the skimpy side.  I went through both the chicken and lamb pretty quickly as the pieces were more or less bite sized.  Both chicken and lamb were also pretty salty as well.The veggie options were actually far more tasty and satisfying in comparison.  The hummus, baba ganoush, and tabbouleh were pretty good.  I may just get the veggie platter next time.
2016-09-10,3,So Mamoun's. After reading all the reviews I was so excited to give them a try. I'm a huge fan of turkish and overall middle-eastern cooking so I was kinda disappointed in this place. It looks like a cantine, for lack of a better word. Their hummus was good but lacked some acidity for balance in flavor. Their falafel was good but their lentil soup was also a little bland. Their tea was on point, however, so that was nice. Overall, I found this place a little underwhelming so I probably won't be going back.
2016-09-09,5,I have lived in Hoboken for 6 years and have heard great things about this place, just never made it in. Finally, I wanted something different and ordered delivery. WOW - now I know why this place gets the props it does. Fast service and the food was exceptional. I've spent much time in the Middle east and this place gets it right . I ordered the Lamb kabob and some hummus dish with chicken and a ton of sides. Hot, fresh and tasty
2016-09-03,5,Omg. Their hot sauce is pretty deadly, holy crap. Their bottle tip is cut out pretty big so I got few Tbsp on my plate and I thought I was gonna pass out.  My eyes watered, my nose ran, and my eye lids were sweating.  Not sure which sauce is hotter. Halal Guys in NYC or this one.  Either way, it will blow your brains out.  Good luck with that.I got the chicken kebob plate ($12) with both salad and rice (extra $1) and for my 1 side, I chose hummus. Good lord. Their huge chunks of chicken was MOIST!!! God!!! I'd give anything for moist chicken!!!! Their hummus was so smooth and flavors were well balanced.  The cold hummus against my warm pita, oh it was heaven. Their rice had awesome middle eastern seasoning. Packed with so much flavor, it was just amazing. And their mint lemonade ($1.85) wasn't too sweet, thank god!  I hate sweet drinks and this was very nice.  It did cost us $35 for two people getting plates, drinks, and 1 dessert so it's not cheap but it was well worth the satisfaction.  I'm so coming back!!!
2016-09-01,5,Hands down one of the best eateries in Hoboken. I am an Arab from Israel and this place has the best Falafel sandwiches around, next to Beyond Pita in Montclair NJ. I haven't had a bad experience here at Mamouns, the guys behind the counter are amazing and very helpful especially for people who don't understand middle eastern food. The sandwiches here are filling and not pricey at all. I also recommend getting a plate, they're cheap, filling and full of flavor! Place is always packed so if you're looking to sit you may not get a seat but its okay .. thats what makes this place so great .. take a walk and sit on someones stoop and enjoy the best food in Hoboken while people watching.
2016-08-30,4,The Hoboken location for Mamoun's is SO much nicer than its NYC counterpart near NYU.There is actual space to dine in, and takeout was super quick. I was in and out within 5 minutes, but I was there on a Tuesday around 11:45am to beat the lunch crowd.I got the chicken kebab sandwich and it was great! For $7 it's a pretty good deal - and felt like it was enough food. I didn't opt for the platter ($12) but I'll definitely try it next time. Solid, consistent lunch spots are hard to come by here in Hoboken, so I'm really hoping Mamoun's is one of them. Today was a quick lunch run, but the spinach pies and baklava looked so fresh and yummy. I can't wait to try some! TLDR; clean, affordable, quick lunch spot for Mediterranean sandwiches and platters. Highly recommended!
2016-08-25,3,Well the food was excellent, but lately it apparently has become normal to just deliver cold food and don't get your hopes up on the 3pieces of pita bread that are mentioned on the delivery page.. You'll just get one. After the 5th time now I'm pretty confident this seems to be the long term habit. It's a shame because until a couple of months ago the food was just impeccable, delivered hot and with the promised amount of bread. It's not like I couldn't live without the bread but usually the paying customer gets what you promise him. Conclusion: if you got the choice between a plate and a sandwich? Get the sandwich... You get what you expect and it is way cheaper. :) Though if you don't care and need some food for lunch the next day, the plate is a good option too because of its size.
2016-08-17,4,Great food, friendly workers! Food never disappoints, just a long wait because of its popularity!!
2016-08-14,4,I got the shawarma plate with both rice and salad, they know what they're doing!! The lamb is so tender yet juicy, rice is cooked and seasoned really well. I got the sauces on the side, but FOREWARNING their hot sauce is ear-numbing spicy. Also be prepared to wait a while, they're really popular, but it's SO worth it.
2016-08-14,5,Amazing food! Chicken is flavorful. Shawarma sandwich is amazing. Hummus is the best I've ever had. Creamy and delicious.
2016-08-09,4,Amazing food and great service. I recommend getting their meat platter. You get veggies and awesome meat options. Warm and friendly staff. Very efficient!
2016-08-07,1,Mamouns is like the girlfriend who keeps cheating on you. You stay with her but know you shouldn't. I'm willing to say that the food is delicious but the customer service is atrocious. Probably some of the worst I've ever experienced. Multiple times I've order online or by phone, paid instantaneously and then walked in like 15-20 minutes later to pick up. They only START making the order when you come in to claim. So what the hell is the damn point of letting people order this way and lying to customers by saying it'll be ready at a certain time or that it'll be started at that moment? At some point you get tired of the con. I know people who have waited more than hour for a delivery only a few blocks away. From now on I'll go out of my way to avoid this place. At some point it's time to break up.
2016-08-07,5,Great place affordable price. I always go there with my son and friends. They have fast and good service. Vest falafel ever
2016-08-04,2,Average food and not so fresh ingredients. There are better places in the area to get falafel. crisp in Newport mall is the best with fresh falafel and whole wheat pita bread.
2016-07-27,4,Stumbled upon this place to get out of the rain and ordered a falafel sandwich, one bite and I was taken back to my lean days living in the west village when you could buy a falafel for $1.50.  As it turns out, this is that same falafel from back on Macdougal street in the 80's.  Whether it's nostalgia or reality, this is the best falafel sandwich out, even if the price has more than tripled!
2016-07-26,4,Awesome falafel sandwiches and shwarma! Their hummus and tabbouleh salad is also fantastic - one of our go to for a quick and filling dinner.  Also love that they're open late so you can have your late night fix as well.  Never disappointed with the food, and always consistently delicious. I'd give them 5 stars if I could get delivery in under an hour.  Every time I've ordered, the wait has been at least 65 to 75 minutes, during both peak and off peak dining times.  I've noticed this is more of a Hoboken issue then a Mamoun's issue though...
2016-07-24,5,It was my first order for delivery and I ordred a shawarma sandwich also baba-ghanouj, it was amazing and the delivery was fast, thank you
2016-07-19,4,Always tasty and fresh. The only thing that annoys me is that whenever I place a pick up order, they only prepare it when I get there so it takes so long, especially during their busy dinner time.
2016-07-17,1,Great food, terrible service. Mo the cashier has no manners.
2016-07-15,5,Best hummus I have had outside of Greece. Order from here, you can't go wrong with anything.
2016-07-04,5,This is a go-to takeout option for my husband and I in Hoboken. We always order the Swarma and the Chicken Kebab (both plates and sandwiches). Considering we order from here a couple of times a month, the food has always been consistently good.We also tend to "customize" a lot (ex. no veggies, extra xx, etc.) and they ALWAYS get our substitutions right. I can't say that for many places in Hoboken (on a consistent basis, at least).
2016-06-26,4,There are not many falafel places around. But Mamoun's offers good falafels at very reasonable prices. My family loves to come to this place and it is open very late. However, I do find the food a little salty at times.
2016-06-26,4,Late night speedy delivery. The falafel is great and so are the kebobs. Beware of their hot sauce if you are not big on spicy foods.
2016-06-23,5,Some nights when I go out in Hoboken, I think my biggest motivation is knowing I can get amazing falafel at 2am.I've tried numerous things here including the falafel, hummus, baba ghanouj, grape leaves, baklava, and mint lemonade, and everything has been so so delicious. Everything about this place is great. Its clean, its open late, the servers are friendly and competent, and most of all, the food is AMAZING and CHEAP. what more could you ask for?
2016-06-11,5,First visit to Momoun's.. Amazing food, authentic and very affordable! The falafel is really good, though the iced tea could be a lot better. The outside seating adds the fifth star to the place.I am definitely visiting again.
2016-06-08,5,Loved this place! Perfect for a weekend afternoon lunch or late at night. My favorite dish by far is the hummus. The falafel and tabouli salad were also very good. It's in a great location; however, it can get a bit crowded so you may feel a little tight during your meal.
2016-06-02,4,Best cheap eat in the area.  I always get the falafel and mint lemonade.  Service is good and plenty of seating.
2016-05-29,3,Pita bread is dry, some chicken pieces were under cooked, my order was totally messed up. I had to re order. It's Good food for late night/after the club but not my go to for a family dinner
2016-05-29,4,This is definitely  the go to spot for falafel,Great flavor,reasonable  prices.The mango drink seemed watered down for a $2.00 cup.tehini is poured on the falafel even if you dont request it so my advice is tell them to put it on the side,I personally like Tizaki better but they don't offer that as of yet.Next time I will try the shaworma.But this is a great place to come eat in hoboken!
2016-05-26,4,My first meal back from having my tonsils removed, not regretting it either. I got the chicken sandwich, which was quite delicious but felt a little dry to me, but a dap of hummus cured it. The rice in my option has a lot going on, many different spices and flavors and I wasnt a huge fan of it. The hummus is delicious!! My favorite thing there honestly. I buy the bigger portion and take it home for later.
2016-05-26,4,I feel like this place is always raising their prices...Perfect spot to eat out late night, I believe they're open until 3am. I got the Chicken Kebab Plate served with Salad. The Mabrumeh dessert is beyond my favorite! Mango juice was refreshing. The Baba Ganouj wasn't up to my expectations, I've had it before and it just didn't taste as refreshing to me. Last night the chicken was very salty, but overall their stuff is pretty good.The workers all have cool personalities :)
2016-05-22,5,First time trying mamoun's and the Yelp reviews are very accurate.  I've been to flatbread grill and it has been good, but mamoun's seems more authentic.  I got the meat combo platter with chicken, hummus, falafel and salad and it is enough food for two meals! The prices are also really good.  When I went to pick up my order the restaurant was pretty busy and a lot of people were waiting for their to-go orders..Will definitely be a return customer.
2016-05-21,4,One of my favorite falafel places! The baklava is one of the best I have had and a huge fan of the sides of hummus and grape leaves. Oh and the mango juice is really good too! Great weeknight cheap date spot!
2016-05-17,5,Amazing food, really cheap. Falafel made me very happy and the hummus is decent too. Solid, though not amazing grape leaves. Cool specialty drinks. Overall a solid 4 with just the food, but the price ($3.50 falafel sandwich!omg!) and the outside seating make the 5th star.
2016-05-14,5,Always order delivery,they inform me always of the wait time 45mins.etc... It's consistent,abundant and flavorful...Good Job!!!
2016-05-13,4,I looooove their chicken sandwich!!!! Being an Indian, I enjoy my chicken spiced up and juicy and this place successfully satisfied that craving! The chicken was well roasted and loaded with spices. It was near perfect! My problem is their falafel platter. My husband ordered it and was served with horrible bread, so dry and inedible! Also, their rice is not flavorful but filed with garam masala, not a very healthy thing! But yes, that platter saved him because of the crispy falafel they serve. So we would never have the falafel platter but chicken!!!!!!! Ps. Hot sauce is hotter than halal guys! Believe me.
2016-05-13,5,I love this place. Their platters are so filling and delicious. Their lemonade is also very good. I never liked falafels until i came here so im sure anyone who may not like them i suggest try it out one more time here.
2016-05-11,5,Mamoun's has become a staple for us. My fianceÃÅ and I eat here at least one to two times a week. The food is super cheap and super delicious (my favorite combination). By FAR, the best falafel around. Everything here is really amazing. If you're looking for something to order, I always get the chicken combo platter with 2 sides of falafel and either babaganoush or hummas.
2016-05-10,5,Not a big fan of their mint lemonade, I feel like the mint isn't fresh which would make a huge difference. BUT.... their falafel is on point. Absolutely addicted, I crave it all the time. My friend from Cali came with me to Jersey and all she ate was falafel. Perhaps she would pick this over NJ/ NY pizza. They are a little stingy with their white sauce but by now they probably know me by my name ;)
2016-05-05,4,Food is great but the guys working in there act like douchebags sometimes. Need to learn to be more professional and courteous
2016-05-03,1,Worst customer service. My friend ordered a lamb sandwich, gets a chicken sandwich instead. When she can't eat chicken. Then we call them to tell them and they hang up on us. No apology nothing. When I asked if they could deliver a block away since they messed up the order the answer was NO. Seriously pathetic service. They also tell us to return the chicken sandwich, what audacity!!!!!
2016-04-25,3,The chicken Kebob sandwich is good. Add hummus for 50 cents more. Nothing out of the world, but decent.
2016-04-25,5,The pros outwit the cons which is the reason they get 5 stars. Their open really late and the food is amazing and definitely hits the spot. Workers are nice you occasionally get that one guy who seems to not care. I always get the veggie plate with baba ganoush, hummus, falafel, and rice. I'll sometimes get the kofta sandwich which is awesome. The lamb over rice is also really good and you can tell the meat is top quality, however I wish they wouldn't over cut it. Some yelpers complaining about the food being salty, I don't agree I believe that's all spices which you can see. Nevertheless you will be thirsty as a mofo after and into the next day. Speaking of thirsty I always get their blackberry Juice and it's always watery. One time the lady sitting in front of me returned her lemonade cause it tasted like water. Another time I saw a worker drinking from a cup and then pouring the remaining contents back into the juicer yuck. I recommend coming here at night sometime after 11 on a weekday when this place is empty, and when street parking is empty. And please for the love of god do not go to Carlos shitty bakery after eating, instead try the desserts the desserts they have here.
2016-04-21,1,I ordered this last week and nothing was made well. The falafel prob was the the "best" thing and that's not saying much.  Actually got sick after eating as well.  Bad experience... hopefully it was a one off.
2016-03-26,5,Good amazing.  Best falafel joint in town.  Great service, tasty food and amazing service.  Will come back for sure
2016-03-24,4,3 words: dee, lish, us.Yelp: why do I have to post a longer review than the above? What the hell does the number of letters I type have to do with the opinion I have? You asked for my opinion. I gave it to you.
2016-03-20,5,Great food. Love the falafels and the lemonade
2016-03-15,1,I got Food poisoning after eating here. Never again. So unfortunate bc I used to love this place.
2016-03-13,4,Mamoun's is a great delivery and late night option. I've been here multiple times and have never been disappointed. Food is always hot and fresh, and portions are generous considering the low price.
2016-03-12,5,what was it...maybe 4 am. jesus christ iv been up for a long time. running off 3 hours of sleep since thursday, i veered off 495 on my way back to the city to get the only thing that's open at this crazy hour...mamouns. well, fuck maybe diners are open in jersey, but the point being, for the hour, for the craving, when i say the name pop on google maps, it was an obvious beeline. and you know its late when there's parking right in front of the spot. nobodys there, goddamn, just me ordering chicken kebob, shwarma and falafel sandwiches. no regard to when im going to eat them all, just knowing that i want it all and i dont want to compromise. jump back in the car and fly back to into the city, flash forward not even 10 minutes later laying in bed making love to a sandwich. or was i standing up? i devoured the falafel and started on the chicken but tossed it all in the fridge. mamouns the next morning, which is when im writing this, absorbs last night's sin so effectively. they're practically hamburgers in terms of nutritional value, except i would argue they taste way better.i realize too this is like the 3rd mamouns iv reviewed on yelp, i guess you could say its my favorite place to eat period? is that crazy. no. i think that's totally justifiable. open around the clock, oddly wherever the fuck i am, and mouthwateringly delicious every single time.
2016-03-11,1,Used to love this place. But we have had too many service issues with them over the last several deliveries to be able to recommend them. In our most recent situation, it took them 90 min to deliver our order. Then we discover that they swapped what we ordered (whole wheat pita) for what they care to give (white pita). They were also chintzy on the side pita (also white), giving less than we've gotten in the past. What broke the camels back is that when we called to complain about the order not being what we asked for, they told us that they "always run out of whole wheat" at this hour and that's all there is to it. Seems to me if you always run out, you should plan to have more available so you can serve your customers what they actually ordered. The guy who answered the phone basically told us to piss off and hung up without an apology. Won't be giving them our business anymore.
2016-03-11,5,Good, cheap and fast. Open super late and delivery is quick. Love their babaganoush and hummus. I order from there often!
2016-03-10,2,The price is really good but the food is not that great. A little to greasy for my taste and not the greatest meat.
2016-03-08,5,Without a doubt one of the best places to eat in Hoboken. I come here a few times a week for chicken kabob or falafel and leave spending under 8 dollars. Everything on the menu is fantastic. I highly recommend a side of mango juice. The owner is an absolute stand up guy. Stopped by after a run one day and only had one credit card one me, and it was declined due to a fraud on the account. The owner gave me the sandwich anyway and told me to just pay him next time. Outstanding customer service.
2016-03-08,3,Mamoun's has always been a go to place for us after drinks and for a late night snack. Their falafel sandwiches are good and decently priced.
2016-03-06,5,Love the shwarma sandwich, pita and bakala pastries. There's a bunch of things of haven't tried but if there as good as those diffenitly cant wait for more.
2016-03-02,5,This place was so delicious. The service was a little slow, although the food was fresh hot and delicious so it is worth a little wait. It is a small, relaxed and casual restaurant. Great spot for a cheap, filling and delicious meal. I can't wait to go back! YUM!
2016-02-16,3,The price for the food here is perfect. It has a very college atmosphere, like most places in the area, and welcoming to everyone. As for the food, its just meh. I have had falafel in plenty of other restaurants and they do not make the cut. This place will temporarily cure you're craving for falafel, but I guarantee you won't be satisfied for long.
2016-02-13,4,We went here for dinner and had mixed meat (which interestingly enough comes with one meat choice!). Beside minor confusion during placing the order, the food was awesome. we really enjoyed the quality and taste of our food.
2016-02-13,1,Way too much salt!!!!!  I mean just way too much!!!! Why ruin yummy delicious food with that much of salt????Their Falafels are gluten free and they have many vegan option so we wanted to try pretty much everything on the menu and we ordered about $40 worth of food. Chicken, hummus, baba ganouj were inedible because they were all too salty!!!! Falafels and lamb were heavily salted as well but not to the point they were inedible...So sad because the Falafels were perfectly super moist inside and crispy outside but still too salty... After eating a few bites of their food, I left the place hungry but the saltiness disgusted my appetite for the entire day and I wanted to only eat my own food with no salt for the next few days...Would love to eat their Falafels again if they cut back on the salt...Please cut back on the salt! Please!
2016-02-11,5,This is probably one of my all time favorite spots to eat at. I will drive distances to get my damn falafel sandwich. This place is so great that my friend that lives four hours away is begging me to bring their food in bundles. Listen try this restaurant out whenever , whether it's 3am leaving tally ho's drunk or you have five dollars to your name this place will keep you satisfied( because the items are amazingly priced). The staff is always friendly so make sure to leave a tip. The place is sometimes messy but honestly the rushes they get are insane so I don't care about cleaning another person's mess sometimes. Oh and their hot sauce will have you tearing up a bit but craving for more. Five stars forever and ever , it's 1:35am and I'm two seconds away from driving there right now. ( oh another perk is that they are open till late!! )
2016-02-08,4,Very good food and the price is right. I am a huge fan of the grilled chicken sandwich with a side of Humus. Everything is very fresh and have never had a bad experience. A little slow when ordering take out/ delivery.
2016-02-06,4,Back to four stars (from five) for Mamoun's.  Still good, but with the price increases and some inconsistency in several recent purchases, I think four is the right number. The falafel pita at $3.50 is still quite a bargain in Hoboken.
2016-02-03,5,I love this place. It's straightforward. It's always good. The staff (while looking a little like male strippers which is all good) are efficient and pleasant and do their job really well. They speak fluent bro. I always order the grilled chicken sandwich and it's delicious. It's basically grilled grilled chicken and salad in a pita - so no guilt. I love spicy stuff like no one but their hot sauce is out of control spicy, so I mix it with their tahini and wow. Perfect! Their hummus, in all honesty could be updated a little along with their baba, but it's still solid. Old school good. Desserts are great as are their lemonades. Great casual place.
2016-02-03,5,I ordered take out with my dad since our mom's currently out of the country and we ran out of her food :P I've eaten here many times before and I loved the contrast of the intense, rich flavors in their shwarmas and falafels but also refreshing and tart crunch of their pickles. And better yet, the customer service is always on point, serving with a smile.My dad took one bite of the shwarma plate and fell in love with it. Once my mom comes home we're ordering this again.
2016-01-28,3,Solid joint. Like the schawrma and pickles on the side. Not mind blowing, but quite good
2016-01-24,1,Wtf?!?! When I called to inquire about whether they were Kosher I received an abrupt "No" and he hung up on me mid sentence. Was it something I said?!?!?!
2016-01-19,1,Food is usually good - offered delivery ... 90 minutes go by and call up to find out what's going on - excuse I get is there was traffic .... traffic in hoboken at 2 pm on a Tuesday ... such a joke and extremely laughableYou guys lost a loyal customer and im gonna have fun telling people this story ...
2016-01-06,5,This place is phenomenal - definitely one of the best late night and delivery spots in Hoboken. They're very efficient with the order system and getting the food out, and the prices are great for the amount of food you can get. This place is always bustling around dinner time and then again when the bar crowd starts to get peckish. Always seems to be plenty of seating though!I recommend any of the gyros with a side of the falafel for a solid meal that will soak up a good night out and send you to bed with a full stomach.
2015-12-29,5,Great late night food after a night at the bars. The falafel is crunchy and tasty. The shawarma is perfect! The prices are very reasonable! Great place!
2015-12-29,4,Nothing is better than a shawrma at 4am! But besides being some amazing drunk food everything here is fresh and delicious. The hummus is super good too.
2015-12-26,4,After a day of traveling for the holidays, I came back to Hoboken starving.  Luckily, Mamouns was opened and I could stuff my face with one of their plates.The menu is not extensive but what they have they do very well.  You have the option of sandwich or plate, the plate can be easily split between two people if you're looking to skip the pita bread.  I love their shawrma and chicken.  Additionally, honorable mentions are their desserts (literally every single dessert is worth a try, they're super flaky and just plain delicious) and also their juices (mint lemonade and tamarind).  Great quality and consistent food for a chain.  It gets packed in here as it's a great late night spot and also they deliver, which can sometimes take a while but well worth it.
2015-12-26,2,We went for shawarma the day after Xmas and both of us were pretty hungry. The meat in the pita was a chewy challenge instead of the expected succulent mouthful. At one point my companion thought he had bit down on a bone but it was a shred of ossified jerky.Having been a long time customer at Mamouns on MacDougal and St. Marks, this NJ experience was a surprise. Save your shekels and pass on Mamouns during a Holiday weekend.
2015-12-21,5,Where can I begin? First tried Mamouns in Greenwich Village Manhattan and loved it. But living in Jersey I didn't want to go that far, so I was thrilled to find out there's on in Hoboken! Still far but much better than going through the Lincoln. Their hummus is some of the best I e had- and I'm Arab so I've had pretty much them all. Their hot sauce is amazing (and super spicy). Their chicken is extremely good, and I'm a very picky chicken eater. Their falafel is also great- again some of the best I've had (my go to is in Paterson but I've had some in Egypt and also Gaza, Palestine). The prices are okay- little more than I'd like to spend for that food but not crazy by any means. Their tabuli is pretty good as well. And you'll have to try the Baba Ganush- amazing.Overall, this place is great. I just wish it had a bigger dinning room! But like most places in Hoboken, there's no room to expand. I'm not into beef or lamb but my family and friends say the lamb is to die for. Also, don't forget the mint lemonade! Absolutely perfect!Overall, go here! Whether you're new to Arab cuisine or an Arab looking for good, authentic grub it'll please your appetite
2015-12-21,4,my goto place in hoboken after all the fun
2015-12-18,4,I've been going to this place for quite some time and have yet to had a bad experience.The food is consistent, as the white sauce and hot sauce are always on point.Recs : Falafel Sandwich/Platter
2015-12-14,5,Had my first falafel here and have never turned back since. Fresh falafel and hummus for vegetarians (or carnivores who just want to try some!) and meat for those who can stomach it. I like how Mamoun's always gives you a balanced meal for those post-game nights: my wraps always have a good combination of meat/veggies in there.
2015-12-12,5,I could eat here every day and not get sick of it!  The sandwiches are so good (and cheap!), and their hot sauce is seriously addictive.  They raised their delivery minimum to $15 on GrubHub a few months ago, and I'm not even mad because now I get the shawarma plate with an extra side of rice and get 3 good meals out of it.  I would still recommend going there and getting takeout, every time I've done that my order was ready in under 5 minutes!
2015-12-11,2,Ok, where to begin?First off, ordered off lunch time, 1:01pm today, 12-11-2015I had to call delivery.com to know where my order was 38 minutes later. I was told there were issues getting out of Hoboken. Umm, I'm IN Hoboken. If that's the case, someone doesn't know how to drive.Secondly, the order was this: 1X   Spinach Pie $2.50   $2.50   1X   Mabrumeh $2.00   $2.00   1X   Shawarma $6.50   $6.50    -Add-Ons  --Pickled Turnips  --Olives  -Choice of Pita  --Whole Wheat Pita  Instructions: No onions or scallions/green onions: no sesame seedsand the tip was 15%. I'm not doing tips anymore especially as I don't know to whom they go.Came to about $14 Shwarma was ok; lamb a bit stringy but tasted good. Usually I don't mind a bit of tendon in my meats. Whole wheat pita? Umm, where was it? My shwarma didn't have it.Spinach Pie: Inedible and I tried. Burned, overcooked?, oily and unpleasant; smelled of onions. I'll post a picture. It hould never have gone out (of the kitchen); fact.Mabrumeh: The highlight of the meal and quite pretty, truth be told. Not enough to make up for the rest of the meal, but ok. Small amount of nut shell included, who knew?
2015-12-11,5,This is my second time to have Mamouns and it hasn't disappointed yet.  I had the combination sandwich with shawarma and falafel because I couldn't decide between the two.  It was excellent.  Next time I would order the falafel on the side because the shawarma overtook the falafel.  My husband ordered the shawarma platter and was very pleased.
2015-12-10,3,It's ok, but I'm not impressed.  Most food is greasy, not cheap, and not large portions.
