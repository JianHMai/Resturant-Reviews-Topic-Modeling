2021-10-29,5,Such a great experience every time we come here! Food is consistently good, staff is always very friendly and sweet! We haven't tried the whole menu yet, but we are seriously planning to haha. For now our top is Baklava and Cheesecake (both just out of these world), vegan gyro wrap, kofteh wrap , roller borek (so cheesy, you won't believe it's vegan)  and the rest I just can't wait to try! Thank you Happy Vegan for your service
2021-10-06,3,Love Turkish food and veggie cuisine so have been looking forward to trying this place for ages. A vegan friend even recommended it. Frequently eat at another veggie koftah chain so wanted to try how Happy Vegans does the dish. The staff was friendly and pleasant but struggled to answer the most basic questions about the food. We were also disappointed to find out they were out of many of the other dishes we wanted to try and frankly the place was a bit of the mess. Was told we should come back when the manager is back from vacation as things would be better then-- they'd have more menu items available. Apparently the day we stopped by was better than other days this week as they'd run out of even more options previously.  As for the koftah, it was tasty enough but not as good as others we'd tried. perhaps it would have been better with toppings in a wrap. The koftah itself had a pasty consistency and a mild spiciness. This dish could have been so much better if the presentation was improved. No herbs, no pickles etc. Other chains include these things and these extras are also pictured in many of Happy Vegans own reviews online.  Just a hunk of iceberg lettuce, pomegranate sauce and half a lemon. Is this how they're serving it now? Was this how it was already supposed to be served? They didn't even remove the barcode sticker from the lemon. Lots of potential here but for us, underwhelming.
2021-09-05,5,Woaaaaaaaa.  This place is absolutely incredible. Ever option is delicious. The vegan gyro is amazing, specifically the Tzatziki  sauce. But what really shines is their desserts. Had the cheesecake and the baklava so far and yea. Best baklava I've had in my life, let alone vegan baklava.
2021-08-29,4,I would say gyro wrap was the best, kofteh wrap was second best, and chickpea wrap was my least favorite. Food was tasty and filling, maybe a little dry and could use some extra sauce. The prices are really affordable and I hope they stay that way! Call to order your pickup order because the prices on GrubHub are inflated. We will be going again!
2021-08-09,5,I am so happy to have come across this wonderful restaurant! I tasted their Baklava and it was AMAZINGGGGG!!!! The best so far! I would highly recommend it to anyone with a sweet tooth( vegan or not!)Plus this place is just a walking distance from the pier!
2021-07-07,2,I've been for vegan for years, i really wanted to like this restaurant but my first experience was not good. I ordered tofu over rice, the rice was bland and tofu was overly salty. Also i expected maybe some veggies to be in the meal, but it was literally just rice and tofu, emphasizing the bland. It may have been enjoyable if it at least tasted good. I got roller borek as well, which was actually very good and I enjoyed it. My boyfriend got spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were flavorless, just spongy and greasy. The pasta was seasoned but neither of us liked the flavor of it. We ended up tossing our meals, thus making our trip here a waste of money. I mean i would like to try this place out again because it has so many raving reviews, but why waste my time when theres so many other vegan options on the Washington street strip?
2021-07-03,5,I got the Vegan Kofteh Large portion and it was delicious, healthy and filling. I could only eat half and was happy to have the other half as leftovers at home. This place is great value with great service. Will definitely come again.
2021-06-27,5,Delicious!  I was hesitant to come here, but everything we had was AMAZING!  We got the borek, kofte, and stuffed eggplant.  I LOVE the eggplant!  Would recommend.
2021-06-14,4,I love that Hoboken has another vegan option ! This place is clean and the staff is very friendly. They always give you thar small treat at the end which is so yum and it's nice of them.The only reason why I am not giving them a 5 starts is because this is the second time I've been there and still I feel like the food it's missing some flavor. Presentation is really good but it's very bland in my opinion ! Maybe the third will be my charm !!! :) Best of luck guys
2021-06-13,5,One of my favorite go tos in Hoboken! The Kafka is a must try, and i love to have it as a snack or appetizer. Every dish has that homemade comforting taste and is great price for all the food you get. The baklava is incredible as well. Don't let the vegan label scare you, you don't have to be vegan to eat here and appreciate all the good flavors!
2021-06-04,5,I work in the area and decided to stop by.  I had the stuffed eggplant with rice.  It was excellent. They just have a bar to sit at but they served me and it was nice. Friendly staff.
2021-06-03,5,AMAZING food! I crave it every single time I walk by - so fresh and light, guilt free. I've never had vegan food with so much flavor and spice. The kofteh lettuce wraps are my favorite and the baklava is a solid 11/10. The customer service is also incredible, always treated with so much kindness! Makes me want to support them that much more :) Wish I had a photo of the Baklava but I ate it too quickly
2021-05-16,5,MY NEW GO TO!I would definitely recommend this place to anybody great tasty vegan food  with affordable prices. The owners are also always kind and genuinely care about their customers!
2021-05-03,5,I rarely review restaurants and even rarer that a restaurant messes up my order and I STILL give it 5 stars, but this place is amazing.  We ordered almost everything on the menu, the owner basically threw in a few more things after there was an issue with our delivery (which he quickly corrected).  Everything was soooooo good.  The middle eastern wraps are delicious, and as a vegetarian I don't ever have the option of eating that kind of food.  The zucchini fritters are out of this world.  And the French fries are also really good (a fact I used to take for granted but since moving to Hoboken that has not been a given sadly).
2021-05-02,5,Wow wow. I had the vegan gyro and it was delicious. It was so flavorful. I didn't know what to expect from vegan Turkish food but this was very authentic. It tasted just like I would expect a gyro to taste and it was not bland at all. The two owners are delightfully friendly as well. When we left they offered me and my friend a free piece of baklava and we bonded over my elementary Turkish from when I lived in Istanbul. I was not that crazy about the vegan kofteh my friend got. I think it was supposed to mimic raw meat but it was a little mushy for me. The restaurant is on a really nice strip called Washington street in Hoboken. The restaurant has limited seating inside but there is seating outside. You have to order inside first and then they'll bring the food to your table. You can tell the owners are very passionate about vegan food. There were plenty of messages in the restaurant about the benefits of vegan food. They also offered us samples before we ordered, and asked us after if we enjoyed the meal. They seemed genuinely interested. I will definitely be back here. Thanks Nice Vegans!
2021-04-26,5,It's a small shop with an outdoor and indoor seating. It seems like a good lunch spot or if you want something on the go. We ordered their vegan gyro wrap that tasted good but we thought it was missing more of the #tzatziki sauce. We also got their #kofteh gyro that was so flavorful and it served cold and I thought I won't like it as it's cold but to my surprise it was very good. The #boÌˆrek tasted so good, the phyllo was super crispy and I could not tell the cheese inside was vegan. We got vegan hotdog that we thought was dry and the fries tasted perfect.For dessert we got their Oreo cheesecake which according to my husbands cousins who are vegan it was the best vegan cheesecake they have eaten. My favorite was the #baklava that melted in my mouth and it was the best baklava I have eaten in New Jersey. It was so fresh and the crisp and sugar level was just perfect. It was so good and my mouth is watered as I am talking about it.  I highly recommend trying this place especially for vegan food lovers. My personal rating (scale 1-5 with 5 being the best)Ambience: 3Taste: 5Service: 5Overall rating:4Cost: $$Check my IG handle for more reviews @vspiceroute
2021-03-21,5,Extremely delicious vegan food! I order from here at least once a week. My favorites are the Dr. Oz juice, crispy tofu salad, zucchini fritters, chickpea wrap, and the baklava. The food is so good even if you are not vegan you are guaranteed to enjoy it as it is so flavorful. The owner is very sweet, caring, and passionate about the business. I highly recommend!
2021-03-19,5,Happy Vegans lives up to its name as the place where I always feel happy whenever I visit. The food is flavorful and there are many options that you can't find anywhere else in Hoboken. The customer service is outstanding - the owner is always happy to offer free samples whenever I stop in. I also love to peek at the dessert box they keep on the counter for Turkish delights and other treats of the day. Even if you're not vegan, this place is place is worth checking out!
2021-02-19,1,Bull$hit restaurant ever I had. I ordered Koftey wrap and it was ducking cold so I called to confirmed and they said we keep it cold. There was nasty after taste and smelled like omit. Also ordered chocolate cheese cake but the quantity was very less compare to the price DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE
2021-02-10,5,Wonderful food and friendly staff! We enjoyed every dish we got, from the appetizer to the dessert. We even tried the fermented black carrot juice to be adventurous, it seems like it's a taste you have to get accustomed to but it was still fun to try! We definitely recommend this spot, even if you're not vegan!
2021-02-01,5,Hoboken got it right! I live in Brooklyn now but was raised in Union City and my family lives in Weehawken. Every time I visit my family I order from there. The past month I must have ordered at least 5 times. The vegan gyro is delicious. I've never tried kofte edits eating here and I fell in love. Pair that with a lentil soup and it's a full meal! A must try!
2021-01-27,5,they know how to make good kofteh I enjoy every bite every time! highly recommended! i will visit their place next week
2021-01-24,5,Must try the baklava! Also tried the kofte wrap, broccoli bites, roller borek, and stuffed eggplant. All were delicious. Super friendly owner, great service. Can't wait to go back and try more menu items :)
2021-01-06,4,I pass this place often when I go see a client of mine so decided to try it out finally. When I walked in I was greeted and asked the man a few questions about the menu. He was super nice and informative. I wanted one of the bowls but he said to get the kofta or gyro over rice (all vegan). I went with the gyro over rice and he told me it was made of seitan. He informed me they don't use soy and that was great. He also gave me kofta because he wanted me to try it. It took about 10 minutes to make and I paid with credit card. When I got home I dug in. When I opened the bag I seen he added fries to my meal which was cool. The rice was good with the white vegan sauce that was given. The gyro was ok tasting and the fries were good. The food was not bad so I will definitely be back to try other items.
2021-01-01,5,I had been praying for a Turkish place to open in Hoboken for a long time. I LOVE Happy Vegans!! I must admit, I was skeptical about a Turkish vegan spot but it's truly a gem. Every single thing I've had here has been fantastic: the broccoli bites, lentil soup, zucchini fritters, vegan kofteh (both in wrap form and without), chickpea wrap, coconut curry bowl. Not only is it healthy and delicious but it's also satisfying and filling.
2020-12-11,5,I went here today because I was craving something sweet and figured I would check out Happy Vegans since it's new and very close to my apartment. I enjoy trying vegan foods, but am rarely blown away. The people who work there are so sweet. I tried the baklava, Turkish delight, and this energy bite (tasted like apples, carrots and dates), and all of it was SO GOOD. The baklava was actually out of this world and so delicious. If the other things didn't fill me up, I would probably go get more. They also mentioned it was all homemade! Happy to have this place in town and excited to back and try other things!
2020-12-04,5,Great food with multiple options to choose. Quick delivery and kind service. It's great to have such a vegan option in Hoboken. Thanks Happy Vegans!!
2020-12-02,2,Instead of one big problem, it was not so good due to several small problems. Asked for coconut rice, received a yellow rice that tasted like it came from a box. The stuffed eggplant was tasteless and filled with undercooked bell peppers. The bun on the black bean burger was soggy. The fries were cold. All in all the quality just wasn't there. Might have been an off day. I'd love to try them again one though, just not any time soon.
2020-12-02,5,Wow. Finally a healthy alternative food options has opened in hoboken. Not a vegan but I love this place. I promised you will not be disappointed
2020-12-01,4,I'm going to give this place 4 stars because of the Owner and because it's vegan... and because for some, the fresh ingredients balances what might be bland to others. First, I'd never had Kofteh and a customer cheerfully helped me understand what this vegan version was. The owner overhearing us gave us a sample which we enjoyed. We ordered the broccoli soup, the kofteh wraps, and the zucchini fritters.  The wrap was simple and very fresh. The kofteh speaks for itself and isn't adorned by many accompaniments. I would like to see a version of this with pickles olives peppers and a sauce or so to liven up the flavor profiles.  The soup was unfortunately served lukewarm, and needed to be reheated. Once it came back... hot-ish... it seemed more like broccoli flavored oat milk.  It needed the salt and the hot pepper seasoning that the owner graciously provided. The zucchini fritters were deep fried and served over a guacamole like paste that was good at first. It was also served with seasoned fries. The dish was so attractive that walk-ins asked us about it. It didn't however seem to fit into the general scheme of the place but it was filling. The baklava was awesome!!!  It's very good here. If the owner wanted my advice, which they don't need, I'd suggest getting a little more organized, as they seemed somewhat overwhelmed with a few customers. Salt and pepper requests shouldn't require two trips, for both of our sakes.  Second, I think they need to reconsider their soups if they all taste that way. A cashew cream would have been preferred over oat milk and it needed more complexity.  Nonetheless, this place was appreciated and I will return.
2020-11-10,5,5/5 amazing experience today! Went for lunch- owner was a GEM, and this is one of my fave spots. Great fajitas, soups, and wraps. PLUS, there are a handful of wonderful dessert options!
2020-11-10,5,This is one of my new favorite fast take out place for healthy food in Hoboken. I was a little hesitant to try it since it seems unfamiliar. For people who are curious but confused, "kofte" means meatballs, and their kofte is basically a vegan meatball. I ordered one of the kofte bowls, which basically looks like a burrito bowl from Chipotle, except with healthier ingredients.
2020-10-21,5,I can't tell you how amazing the service was at this place. Awesome food, great customer service, and a clean environment. The food was fresh and everything I wanted. I was so hungry and this place did the job. I highly recommend!!!!
2020-10-21,5,So happy I stumbled across this place! I've never had kofteh and they were kind enough to let me sample a bite and it was delicious! I ordered a kofteh wrap and lentil soup and both were so tasty and filling. I saw him bring out other orders like the zucchini fritters that looked amazing as well so I can't wait to come back and try more things from the menu. The service is great here!
2020-10-18,5,Let me first start by saying I am not a Vegan ( I regret ), but I tried their Vegan falafel and it was shocked to why didn't I try this before . I love the Falafel and I felt great after finishing my Falafel and I shared a veggie burger . The owner was very nice and welcoming . I highly recommend their Baklava . I hope I can get on the Vegan path a 100% . We'll surely be back soon .
2020-10-13,5,Stumbled upon this establishment not too long ago - delicious cÌ§ig koÌˆfte, tastes like the real deal although it is vegan (!!) The owners were super hospitable to my friends and I they gave us these sweets that tasted incredible. The baklava and turkish delight are a MUST try. Would come back for the amazing service and delicious food!
2020-10-12,5,We tried Happy Vegans again today. The first time, about a couple weeks after they opened, we ordered a few spicy vegan kofteh wraps which were delicious, balanced in flavors, and huge. The salad within and flat bread on which they were served were so extremely fresh and delicious that we felt we must be in the Middle East where the freshness of ingredients, especially that of herbs, vegetables and bread, is prized. Today, the menu options appeared more numerous and the food was AMAZING. We ordered the Coconut vegetable curry on coconut rice, the grilled stuffed Eggplant atop bulgar turmeric rice, and two soups: lentil and broccoli. The portions were all very large and the complexity and deliciousness of the flavors and herbs simply blew me away. I felt I was back in Morocco eating the famously complex spices and flavors of the Moroccan palate. The food was so balanced in flavors, with so many vegetables and perfectly cooked items.  It even tasted buttery I presume from coconut oil and the like, but not greasy, and very fresh. It was one of the best meals I've had in Hoboken.Trust me, you won't miss the meat and dairy. The baklava is out of this world. I'm middle eastern born and it's one of the best I've ever had, including homemade, and it actually tastes buttery. Even my cousin, who is a chef, agrees and could not believe it is vegan. Hoboken's palate and culinary diversity is greatly enhanced by this wonderful vegan restaurant. I really hope this wonderful restaurant stays!I'm vegetarian but not vegan and my husband is neither. Trust me, even if you are not vegan, you will not miss the meat and dairy in this incredibly prepared, rich and flavorful food.  And, our meal was also gluten free. Thank you for your kindness, warm hospitality, and for making this most delicious and healthy vegan food.
2020-10-07,5,Ummm AMAZING. I've been to Istanbul four times and go figure, my favorite kofte place ends up being down the street from me in Hoboken! I've never liked vegan food, but the kofte wrap here is GOOOOOD. It's so good, I'd probably inhale it whole if not for the whole chewing thing :PIt's light yet satisfying. A good break from meat when you like meat, but don't feel like eating meat.Also, the baklava is vegan! What!!?! I've tasted the best baklava in Turkey, and I honestly can't  believe that the baklava here is vegan. Insane. 5/5 will return!!
2020-10-05,5,A new vegan business in the middle of Hoboken! Decided to stop by to support local business and I'm glad I did! Ordered their signature kofte wrap and baklava. WOW - their baklava is amazing - so crispy, perfectly sweetened. Wrap was very filling and flavorful - I definitely want to try their kofte by itself. Most of all, the service and hospitality. The owner? was behind the counter when I stopped to pick up my order. He offered me a piece of Turkish delight (on the house) since I mentioned I've never had one! So friendly and I can't wait to return to try their items as a vegan food enthusiast.
2020-09-29,5,We popped in and had the most unusual, delicious meal ever! The staff is also extraordinarily helpful, and the lentil soup (they gave samples!) was savory and surprising and amazing. We ordered Zuccini fritters (amazing and full of all sorts of veggies and spices), and I cannot remember the name of the specialty, but it too was so interesting and delicious. For dessert, Turkish delight in lemon and rose. Oh my God.  One thing, Happy  Vegans, it took us a few days to stop by because your outside menu on the blackboard looked like nothing special--and your food is TOTALLY SPECIAL AND DIFFERENT, so maybe you could indicate that somehow on the little blackboard?
2020-09-27,5,Nicest and kind people running the place, offered samples and super helpful! Their baklava is delicious and they were right- i did not want to share that with my husband lol. Ended up ordering 3 items to go and i will definitely be coming back to try other stuff.
2020-09-20,5,What a delicious spot for authentic vegan Turkish cuisine. The owner offered many different samples of all their dessert offerings along with tastes of their DELICIOUS kofteh. Never tried kofteh!? You HAVE to try it!
2020-09-17,5,I really love happy vegan. The business popped up right as I made a dietary switch and felt there were not enough vegan options with meals that actually look fulling. The gentleman that works in the space is such a delight and always kindly greeting me. The food literally taste great and for good prices. I've been obsessed with the lentil soup.
2020-09-15,5,Delicious! And fast delivery. So happy for a new vegan place in town. Falafel, kofteh, and hot dog were standouts.
2020-09-12,5,Randomly came to this place before going back to the hotel. I had the opportunity to meet the owner of the restaurant, Tahir. He is super passionate about his craft and so, so nice. I had the chance to try different food items including the zucchini fritters, fries, some kofte, baklava, and the mint lemonade. Everything was good, and the zucchini fritters are a must-have. Tip: Eat it fresh... don't wait. I'm not a vegan, but I could definitely eat this more often. Adding it to my list for my next visit to New Jersey!
2020-09-10,5,Stumbled upon this spot looking for a healthy lunch option in the area.  Bold to open in the middle of the pandemic so I wanted to try their food and support the small business. The Hoboken/Weehawken area is definitely lacking in good vegan/healthy food options.  The owner was very gracious and offered to answer questions and taste.  I tried their signature kofte and also had their falafel, hummus and zucchini soup.  Everything was delicious and if you eat there, served on unique flatware.  Their pistachio Turkish Delight and baklava were also tasty.  Highly recommend this spot for authentic food!
2020-09-08,5,Yum yum yum, so excited for this place to open. Love having vegan options in town. What is unique here is the Kofteh, I had never had before, they are offering samples and it was delicious. Not only delicious but healthy and calorie friendly if that is important to you. Also more common options with chickpeas, tofu and lentil plus delicious soups and deserts. Very nice team, wish them lots of luck in Hoboken.
2020-09-04,5,Amazing amazing amazing! Fantastic food and the sweetest employees. I never really leave reviews, positive or negative, but these guys are fantastic, so I had to support them. I'm so glad they've come to Hoboken. Vegan or not, everyone has GOT to try their baklava... it is worth its weight in GOLD!
2020-09-04,5,Great food and ambiance!  The kofteh wrap was larger than expected and flavorful. The prices are very reasonable as well!
2020-09-03,5,We just moved to Hoboken, and tried the baklava from this restaurant -- it's delicious! I grew up in a Greek family and this is the real deal; vegan or not, you'll love it. We'll be coming back for more and look forward to trying the cÌ§igÌ† koÌˆfte.
2020-09-02,5,I had the most delicious vegan food here, coconut curry with turmeric rice and stuffed eggplant with coconut rice. I can't wait to go back again! I also had a couple of the Greek pastries and they were out of this world. Can't say enough good things about this restaurant!
2020-08-31,5,Best place to eat vegan food in Hoboken. I loved the food as well as the staff members.
