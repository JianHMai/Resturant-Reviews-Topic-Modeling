2021-11-16,5,The drinks were good and the bartenders were nice and the music was good.The people were really nice in there too.Perfect place right near the path train .
2021-10-31,1,Terrible experience for Halloween. Texas Arizona participated in a "after pub crawl" Halloween party from 9pm-2am. Well we arrived at 9pm only to find out everyone was locked out for a penn state game and told we had to wait till 10:30 pm. We'll long story short everyone was locked out till midnight! As we entered, they actually had the nerve to tell us our tickets had expired and we needed to pay a $30 cover. Not to mention we were the first in line .. awful experience, terrible business practice and a clear scam.
2021-10-23,3,This bar can be fun for watching sports but they let it get to such a ridiculous capacity that you're constantly being bumped into or physically shoved into a corner. The bathrooms are absolutely disgusting. I've never been here on a weekend without walking into a half inch layer of urine in the bathrooms and they never clean them throughout the night.
2021-10-11,1,I always come to this place at night with my friends. On Saturday I bought 2 drinks which came out to about 32 dollars and gave a 20% tip like a normal person which was 6 dollars. The girl that closed out my account took out an extra 20 dollars just for herself. I will no longer be coming to this bar. This has never happened to me here. EVER! It made me so upset, I will never ever be coming back here and will make sure everyone I know doesn't either.
2021-09-25,3,A decent  bar overall. But I waited 10 minutes to get in and then later waited another 10 minutes to go to the bathroom. And I guess, after all that,  i feel like they could have, at least least stuck a command hook for my purse on the stall door for my purse.
2021-09-17,5,Came here on a random weekday for a bite and to hang out with a friend. It was a really chill place to go to. They weren't so busy since it was a week day. The bartender was also our waitress which was different. She was really sweet and immediately asked us what we'd like. She also suggested not getting the chicken quesadilla. I like that she was honest with us. I ordered the mozzarella sticks, because I'm a sucker for those, and the classic burger and fries. My friend got the BBQ wings. We only ordered sodas but I know it's a popular spot for drinks, specifically beer it seemed. My mozz sticks were so delicious and I like that they were chunky and the cheese actually stretched out. The burger had a bit of a weird aftertaste but it was cooked well. Fries were delicious. My friend enjoyed his BBQ wings a lot. He ate all of them. While it looked great I'm not a big fan of BBQ so I didn't try it. Prices were standard. The ambiance was chill throughout the night. They had a live DJ and music was livelier later in the night. Recommended place to just chill and have drinks/quick bite.
2021-09-07,1,If I could give 0 stars I would. My friend group and I went to Texas to celebrate LDW and ended up walking out because the female server with short hair and tattoos was too busy fraternizing with a table of all girls that she appeared to be friends with than to do her actual job. We were waiting for so long they sent other staff and a bouncer to try to find her. Safe to say we ended up leaving. The cherry on top though is that one of my friends went up to the main bar for service and the one tall skinny bartender had a piss poor attitude. If you're in the service industry have the decency to make it look like you're actually happy to be at work and fake a smile. My friend described her as cold and rude with 0 people skills. Very unprofessional behaviors exhibited by both employees.
2021-07-16,1,This is the worst service I have ever had and now I understand why the place has such a low rating. I should have paid attention to the ratings before even trying to come here because me and my party were treated so horrible it is actually the worst bar and restaurant that I have ever been in attendance to. If you're not paying attention to the rating and just listening to a couple locals please reconsider and never come here in your life. I would rather go anywhere in the world the Texas Arizona. I really wish Yelp allowed zero star ratings.
2021-07-04,3,This bar is alright. There was one or two bartenders running the place and customer service was terrible. The drinks were not the best.
2021-06-29,4,We came to Hoboken, New Jersey to visit Cake Boss Carlos Bakery. We were hungry and lots of places around were closed or out of business so we stopped in here to cool off and get a burger. The food was good. The server was real nice and the food was fast. We mainly wanted to cool off so it was a great place to hang out at for awhile.
2021-04-10,1,Brought a bride here while her fianceÃÅ was on his Bach. WORST MISTAKE EVER. Do not come here, I am not a Karen, this place MAKES YOU ONE & has 3 stars and lowering for a reason GO ANYWHERE ELSE IN HOBOKEN. John only person who deserves a job here, you were and angels unfortunately everyone else was THE WORST
2021-04-01,5,Love this place. Also Erica is the best waitress you have. We loved her and she made our night so fun!
2020-11-26,5,Stopped in pub-crawling from Hoboken to Edgewater.  Cool place.  Games on all around.  Outdoor seating where you can order at the bar through outside windows.  Really nice staff, full bar, good music.  Nice place.  I recommend!
2020-11-07,5,Had such a great time tonight here, Holly was our bartender and she was amazing! Highly recommend coming here for a good time and drinks!
2020-10-24,1,The bodyguard denied us to enter just because we don't have US citizen id!! We showed him our country id which shows our age and we are over 21 and he said where we are???  It is obviously racism! I said him that he was acting like racist but he refused and wanted us to leave. That was so ridiculous! The tourists are not allowed to enter bar? I have been living in this country for 3 years as a student and it was the first time that i have been experienced that kind of thing. That's not how business treat people!  We have waited 30 minutes at the door while it was freezing! Definitely so rude...
2020-09-27,1,I came here to watch the game on a Sunday afternoon.  I ordered a beer and I paid for it.  At the end of the game, a manager came up to me and told me I had to leave.  I asked why, as I wasn't actually doing anything wrong.  She told me it was because I only ordered one drink and I wasn't ordering drinks and food all day.  I pointed out to her other people in the bar weren't drinking either and her excuse was "well they've been drinking all day and you only had one and people are waiting and we have limited space."  I refused to leave because it was very clear I was not doing anything wrong.  They were not at full capacity because they were letting large groups in and I was a paying customer!  The manager then threatened security.  Yes you read that right.  She THREATENED SECURITY because I wasn't going to leave since I paid for a drink.  I talked to security and they agreed to let me stay through the end of the game, which is when I was planning on leaving anyway.I think they're making people leave when they're not constantly drinking because they just want COVID relief.  But there are other ways to do it.  Why don't they try offering a lot of specials or expanding outdoor seating, which would probably draw a lot of people in.If they want to have a minimum order amount that's completely understandable but they could put up a sign or tell people at the door or say something like "hey we do require one drink an hour rather than just watching the game.  Would you like another beer or an appetizer?" Telling someone they have to leave and threatening security is a huge leap and makes me never want to go back here.And if they're going to have a seating limit (which is also understandable given the capacity limit), there needs to be a specific time (ie 2 hours) which applies to everyone.  They should also tell people this at the front door.I won't be back.  What happened today makes me never want to give them my business again.EDIT:  I have spoken to other bar owners in the area who do not have the same rule of "order drinks constantly or we're getting security to escort you out."  I don't really know why they do this here.  They also yell at people to "sit down now" when they are standing at the bar just for a second and will yell at people and literally follow them until they find a place to sit (where are we, elementary school?!). The bouncers don't social distance when they do this.  The bar stools are not socially distanced either.  This made for a really unpleasant environment.  Football Sunday is supposed to be fun, but they made it so awful I couldn't even enjoy myself while I was there.  I'm going somewhere else next time where they treat their customers much better than this and where they don't kick people out when they order just one drink.  Unprofessional.
2020-09-20,5,We were greeted at the door, and seated within 30 minutes. Unfortunately you can't order a drink while you wait anymore and need to be seated at a table. We ordered our drinks and appetizers : Mac and cheese bites and nachos. There is no cocktail menu but you can make your drink how you want . They also had seltzer's. We ordered chicken quesadillas and they were really good. The waiters were attentive to our table.
2020-07-06,1,Hollie the blonde manager is the rudest person I've met  who refused to serve me even though I'm 26 with a legal ID! She said sorry I don't want to serve you, gave me look and told me I had to leave. That's not how you treat people never ever coming back I felt discriminated against I had to order for pickup just to eat as she seated someone who came after me down. Besides the food portions were small and it's overpriced $12 for 3 pieces of potato skins? Food isn't even good for it to be overpriced. Don't waste your time or money coming here any place is better than here in Hoboken.
2020-02-12,5,My husband and I were walking to the path when the sign outside caught our attention. The bartender during the happy hour shift was the most joyful and attentive bartender I've encountered in Hoboken! There happy hour specials are the best as Jameson is on the menu! Let's not forget the food as it is upscale bar food! We will definitely be back soon!!
2020-01-20,1,I've now committed to agreeing with my friends that we will no longer be coming back to this bar because of their bathroom situation. It may sound funny but I can assure you that any female who is reading this gets it. Not only will you wait on a line so long it's up to the top of the stairs where you are then forced to go next door to Dunkin' Donuts to BUY something in order to pee, but if you do have the patience to make it through the line, you're forced to use the most disgusting stalls I've ever seen. These photos sadly are "clean" from what I've experienced. I hope this establishment gives more of a consideration into redoing their bathrooms and having a staff member clean them during their busy hours.
2019-12-21,1,the male bartender with the weird haircut is extremely rude. I was over charged for 3 shots and I tried explaining that, for him to only throw the recite back at me and walk away. I wrote on the recite to take the extra $54 I was being charged as a tip, since he refused to hear me out. he proceeded to come over and push the recite down, cursing at me and to "just talk to him and not write a note on the recite." I told him I tried to but he blatantly ignored me. I put the recite down on the bar and was walking out and he CHASED ME DOWN to the front door about not leaving a tip.everything this bartender did was terrible from how he acts with customers to him chasing someone down about a tip. I truly feel sorry for the other bartenders.
2019-12-17,3,Texas Arizona is a fun bar.   Food is good, lots of TVs.  Can get crowded. Beers can be a little on the expensive side but sometimes there are specials
2019-12-10,1,Literally the worst bar in the world. They took my real ID and my friend's real ID and told us they were fake. We're 26 years old. They cracked my friend's ID in half while examining it. We actually had to call the cops and wait for them to show up just to get our IDs back because all the bouncers at this bar were so sure that our IDs were fake. Lol sorry Texas you wont ever get my business or any of my friends' business ever again. Your bouncers had one job to do and they couldn't even do that right, maybe if you used that little book you have in the back to refresh your memory on the difference between a real ID and a fake ID you'd be more successful.
2019-11-13,3,This is just another typical bar in Hoboken. Nothing crazy nothing fancy. I went here on Sunday for the football games and the appetizers. All the beverages are fairly priced for that area, which could get costly. The wait staff he's actually pretty friendly and very attentive. When things get busy and believe me on Sundays they get packed they are rushing and running around making sure the customers are happy and have what they want. When we first got there was one or a couple appetizers we ordered some fries and an order of nachos which took about 35 minutes to come out, which I wasn't too thrilled about. But let me tell you the fries and the nachos were probably the best apps I've heard in quite some time in that area. I don't know if it was in the seasoning or just how the food is made it was very flavorful and everything came together really well and nothing was overused to drown flavors. The only thing I disliked about this establishment was how over packed it gets. Once all the tables are full and the bar area is packed they still let people in so there's barely any room to move around let alone sit. I was there for a few hours and was standing most of the time at our table. The bathrooms can be a lot cleaner but that's understandable with a place like this gets the traffic they do.
2019-10-15,3,Came here to watch the Super Bowl and got the wings and calamari. The wings were okay and the calamari was better than decent. The bartenders could do a better job at being more attentive, but this place overall isn't bad. This place is always busy on a Thursday night or on weekend nights as well!
2019-09-29,5,One of the best bars in downtown Hoboken and just outside path Station so good place to enjoy happy hour and music is good too.
2019-09-29,4,Love this place for watching football. I'm a Steelers fan and heard this was a Steelers bar but there were plenty of other football fans there. It was loud but a lot of fun and great atmosphere for watching football. Didn't get to try any food but everything looked really good. Not to mention they had cheap beer deals as I had 3 yuenglings for under $10.
2019-09-08,3,Went here with some friends and had a good time. The DJ tried a bit too hard to mix his own music and it didn't sound that great. There was room to dance and it wasn't super packed.
2019-09-02,5,We stayed in New Jersey more than New York itself. Texas Arizona is right next to the station and is the perfect pregame for a long night in New York. The prices are reasonable and the staff is phenomenal. Anytime someone says they'll be in Hoboken, I def tell them they must stop at this bar.
2019-07-28,5,In the area apartment hunting and came across this spot - great food, drinks selections and service! They got it all! Got approved for the apt and so guess what??New regular alert Juliana and food runner (nice kid with hair bun) were a perfect duo! Thanks to them, I will be returningHeyyyy neighbor!!!
2019-07-20,5,Great local bar right near PATH. Had the pretzel app and it was INCREDIBLE. Came with three different dips and it was huge - so doughy and buttery. Definitely recommend!!
2019-06-30,1,Stopped by this place on our way out of NYC.  The menu looked promising.  We ordered an appetizer platter for 3 of us that was supose to include chicken fingers.  Needless to say there were no fingers on the plate.  We called it to the waitresses attention and she started to argue that they werent on the menuAfter showing them the menu it took 10min for someone from the kitchen to come out and tell is they were all out of any kind of chicken.  What were they hopimg we didnt notice?  If you run out of something doesnt the kitchen usually inform the wait staff.  We should have walked out when the cleanliness of the menus we were handed was questionable.
2019-06-10,4,Really glad we stopped in while we waited for our train. The bartender was super pretty and let me charge my dead phone. Pretty affordable for the location, $10 for a Long Island iced tea, $6 for a sprite and gin, $6 for a shot, and $12 for 12 breaded buffalo wings. The wings were really good too, perfectly cooked which almost never happens anywhere I go. Super juicy on the inside but cooked all the way. The only problem I had with the place was how disgusting the ladies room was. The stalls are super small, like can't turn around easily if the doors closed. Besides that the one toilet was missing a seat and the others door wouldn't lock and both were disgusting.
2019-06-04,5,Barmaid Gigi is pretty amazing. She is so friendly and loves her job. 5 stars for her smile.
2019-05-29,1,If I could give zero stars I would I'm disgusted with the coordination of this establishment I was there on the night of the 26th of May going onto the 27th. Quite unprofessional if I may say. Their was a bit of altercation on my visit due to a very disrespectful bartender which I'm not sure what his problem was to begin with, I'm sure he's not certified in TAP like many bartenders are including myself who can say is a bartender as well. Poor job at trying to de-escalate a situation and tapped my shoulder with security referred to me as a "pussy" then grabs the drink out of my brothers hand aggressively and throws it on the other side of the bar. Asked to speak to a manager who at first greeted us with no name might I add. Tells us he can't do anything about my money due to my comment on the check. Profusely tells us he will not reimburse us the money nor will he check the cameras i assume to protect the employee and not the customer as well, after a bit of back and forth he goes in and comes back out saying the funds spent on my card will be reimbursed and I'll see it in my account in 2 business days, which is pretty crazy that he refused to give me an itemized copy after making such a statement. 2 business days have passed and I have not received my funds back they are actually finalized no longer pending (meaning the manager on duty that night lied to me in my face), I'm not sure how the managers here are trained but very poorly. I work for major food groups based in New York and I know many of the ins and outs of hospitality and how things are handled. Side note i couldn't even find a health inspection note on the window they must be hiding it the place had residue all over the bar and people said in past reviews they have food poisoning wouldn't be surprised if their is rats and roaches. What i can say is that my many friends and colleagues that ask me to advise them a nice spot to attend , I will not refer this one. In the end I shook the so called managers hand out of respect and parted ways. I'm disgusted with my experience and will never be returning again. Won't be surprised if my review is taken down due to restaurants connections with yelp I've seen it done plenty of times from my experience in the industry I just had to express my horrible experience. Such a shame because I was inquiring with a young bartender from the other side of the bar about a job and she gave me the email Greg@texasarizona.com I was so excited about the place until this incident.
2019-05-04,1,This is the worst bar possible in Hoboken. Last night was my first night ever trying to go this bar. My cousin waited in line to get in when we joined her in line, the security guard let my two GIRL cousins & me in, but wouldn't let my boyfriend in. The excuse was that we cut the line well then why were we let in? We back outside to get him because we weren't gonna leave him alone. The security guard gave the same excuse and had no different reason when we said you let us in. This is gender discrimination. So three girls can "cut the line" but when a guy does it, he's wrong?
2019-05-02,1,The happy hour says 4-8pm but clearly the bartender Jordan was not made aware of it because I was charged regular price. When I asked about it, she said those drinks were not HH, but the sign on the street clearly states otherwise.
2019-04-07,4,This place has an extensive beer menu. When it's nice out they have the side of the restaurant open so you can enjoy the nice weather. It's nice to people watch as you enjoy a delicious brew. It's so close to the train station that it's a good spot to meet friends at. Would come here again .
2019-03-09,1,Security guard was cursing at me for no reason. This place is horrible the staff are extra rude for no reason at all. 0/10
2019-03-06,4,Came to Texas Arizona for the first time on Saturday, March 2, 2019 for Hoboken's Leprechon Bar Crawl and loved it! While I only drank one thing that day.... Sex on the Beach... It was one of the best ones I've ever had! I gave this bar four out of five stars because just like any bar in Hoboken, the women's bathroom sucked! There were like 2 stalls ONLY and it was disgusting to go into! Would love to come back during a time that it is not this busy and can sit at a table and watch sports!
2019-03-02,1,Watched the staff turn a blind eye to women being harassed on a Friday night. My friend and I saw two women get separated by groups of men, one of whom was putting his hands on them and making them uncomfortable. When my friend pointed this out to a bouncer, he looked over for a second but then just shrugged and walked away. Minutes later, a different bouncer kicked the women out - NOT the dudes. Basically just enabling predatory behavior and letting it happen to keep making money off douchebags. This place ought to be shut down.
2019-02-09,1,The bouncers do not care that racist people come into the bar while you stand on line and they talk shit to you saying go back to your country. In 9 days I'll be 33 born and raised here. My parents Been here since they were 18. In an Indian American. There is no need for stupid ass white assholes to say shit to me and my party of 30 people I bring to this establishment. One of the security guards here EVEN SAID TO MY FACE I didn't hear him say anything. If I wanted to stab anyone I need a knife or a pen which I have none of. But it's easy for them to say that. I've never been discriminated against ever before in my life. I come from an upper middle class family with a bomb ass job. This what this place has to offer. Racism. I've never been effected by this and I hope it never happens to anyone else ever again. This place is racist and so are the bouncers. There is no need for me as an American who works hard to feel this type of way. I will never forget this and I'll never forget the 2 bouncers who made me feel this way. My family and I will NEVER step foot in this establishment again. I have friends in law enforcement  and an uncle who's a diplomat. There is no need for this racist shit against people cuz your white and you think you have privilege and for those who support you. My sister dates a white dude and my uncles matter to a white woman. God bless their soul. They weren't raised with such dumb ass racism. I'll post this here on yelp, on Facebook, and on instagram. Texas Arizona you should know better and do better.
2019-02-09,1,I love the bartenders and servers from cadillac and texas Arizona but the management has to go. I do not know how they got their job but they were clearly lying about experience on their resumes. No hospitality skills at all, think they are initialed or something like they are better then. No dude you manage texas get over yourself. They have bad attitudes and when I went to say something to them about my good service one brushed me off like I was not there. I do not know where they found these clowns but they are 2 of the worst managers I have ever come in contact with. Plus i hear the gm talks to the staff horribly and degrading. Wonder why you cant keep staff or customers clearly management is incompatint.
2018-12-30,1,I used to love going here until my most recent experience and I will never go back. I was with a group of people ordering drinks and the waitress noticed we were all wasted and pocketed the cash that we left. Our bill was $352, we gave $325 in cash and put down my credit card for the rest of the bill - the next day I realized I was charged $252 overall. When I called the restaurant to explain what happened, management refused to look into the situation, telling me "too bad you signed the bill" and "the waiter said you left 96$." Morally, I cannot believe that a respected location can employ any personnel with the mindset of stealing from customers. Furthermore, managements inability to resolve my issue was even more concerning. My recommendation - check your CC statement after dining here.
2018-12-29,4,A very decent place in hoboken where you get awesome burgers and sliders. Good for small and large groups. Has a casual ambience and no nonsense attitude of the servers work well for me. Loved the location. Loved the food. Fries were average.
2018-12-08,1,Is it normal protocol for your staff to laugh, make fun of and snap chat or record guests while they have fun at the bar? Very uncomfortable.
2018-12-05,4,Good sports bar, a lot of TVs and a huge beer menu. Appetizers were really good and filling. You should go here for happy hour and a game for sure. Great atmosphere.
2018-10-19,4,Great Happy Hour with $3 domestic drafts and $4 imported drafts including a 16 oz plus ++ Sam's Oktoberfest (the best) Good DJ tunes, hot bartenders, good wings and super meaty Mac & Cheese. An OK Philly Cheese Steak with steak fries. Big place - bring your friends . Near the PATH.
2018-09-29,1,This is the worst service I have ever received . I waited an hour just for water . And then the manager just apologized for the wait . I have zero idea who is our server because she came to us once . My friend couldn't even get another drink because we had no one to come to us at all . I am a server and I would never treat anyone like this .
2018-09-28,1,The bouncers have no respect for the customers. My husband and I came to this place. We were in line. They let me in as I was inside the bar I look back I see that the bouncers were giving my husband a problem at the door. They stated that he was drunk when he wasn't. My husband was tired on a Friday night but he still wanted to go out with me and have a good time. He works long hours in the NYC financial district. We nicely told them that that was the case and they were rude, and insensitive. Seem like this place has opens doors for thugs and people that do not have a real life. I would not go back to a place that do not train their staff properly and employee people that have no respect for their customers.
2018-09-20,1,Pros: Cheap beer, decent service, lots of bros if thats your thingCons: Awful food. Like criminally awful. Their menu boasts, "the best burger in Hoboken" but it tasted like they didn't even salt the low-quality ground beef. It was like, really bad. Even with blue cheese on top. So disappointed. Waste of cheat day.
2018-09-15,1,Was having a very good day out and then asked for a water for a friend and this waitress said she "didn't have time to pour water". Very rude, considering it was a group of 20+ of us. We left.
2018-09-15,1,I don't even yelp but this is based off of the woman bartending on September 15, 2018. Awful woman who declined 25 people water after ordering hundreds of dollars of alcohol because she "didn't have time for it". She was extremely rude and ignoring our party the entire time. I don't think it's respectable to think because we are trying to stay hydrated while drinking that we wouldn't tip or take care of her. So unprofessional.
2018-08-30,1,I asked for a medium rare burger and they gave me a well done burger. If I was not working a 16 hour day, I would have told them to shove it. No one ever came back to ask how our food was, after they delivered it to our table. Horrible service and people who do not know how to cook.
2018-08-12,1,We decided to go to Texas on a quiet Sunday night at 8:30PM. The bartenders weren't very busy- they were socializing with their friends who decided to come to the bar, more than making drinks. After paying a hefty bill and a 20 percent tip with absolutely no complaints on our end! A certain bartender and her friends who were drinking at the bar, gave us attitude and were extremely loud and rude towards us. VERY unprofessional in every aspect of the situation. As we waked out quietly and very confused by the statements that were yelled out to us as we were leaving, we called and spoke to Anthony the manager about the nonsense that was said which was prompted by Samantha, their bartender. I'm hoping something is being done because this is very disheartening and will most likely cause us to never go back. Despite your line of work, be professional. No other business would put up with staff who act out like this. As a business owner myself, there are standards when dealing with staff and the expectations they withhold working under your name.
2018-07-26,4,This is a chill bar with a pretty big crowd. It's near the Path so it gets a lot of patrons. They have a typical drink menu, nothing too crazy. The staff is always friendly and attentive. And I like the charging station that's super convenient. I've been a few times but I never actually planned on going there. It was intended for a quick stop or meetup spot and we end up staying most of the time.
2018-06-16,3,This placed gets PACKED at night, but is a lot of fun. The DJ always drops the hottest beats.Never had their food. Only been here for drinks.If you're out in Hoboken partying, be sure to stop in Texas and check it out. I prefer this place over Cadillac.
2018-06-08,1,So this was my first time here and everything was perfect had some drinks at the bar and I was having a good time watching the game until this security guy came at us and told us in a very rude way that we had to get up of our bar tools and give them to him... why? "Because he can" that was his answer.. so I'm not coming back until this guy gets out of that place (big guy with glases)
2018-06-04,4,Located steps away from the Path, this is the perfect place to start a night out. Plenty of TVs and you can request what sporting event to watch. Staff is friendly and willing to help accommodate larger groups.
2018-05-05,1,Bartenders are nothing but sweet hearts male or female, they deserve the tips they are working for, the bouncers on the other hand have to get their stuff together, they kicked me out for no reason. I had one drink and they must have mistaken me for someone else, thinking i was someone else. They have to get their stuff together or not work at the establishment making childish errors over dumb stuff. There isn't enough organization and the head bouncer isn't intelligent enough to organize and correlate the situations that are handed to him.
2018-04-22,1,This place sucks the food sucks. There was no one to seat us, one waitress for the whole place, and the margaritas SUUUUUCK so freaking bad. And don't order the potatoes skins.
2018-04-08,3,I've frequented TA a few times in the last few years and it's a spot that doesn't let up on sports, cheap beer, and bar food that'll keep your tummy feeling nice. This place being right off the PATH train is fairly dangerous, but it does the job as your waiting for an Uber or your ride into Hoboken. Any who, our recent visit was for a few quick adult beverages before headed to a birthday party. The soon to be wife and myself were perched up by the bar because we didn't feel the need to do a table with only 30 minutes to spare. We were greeted with a vibrant staff of 2 at the bar. 1 was very kind and smiley, while the other looked like she just woke up from a wicked hangover. Moreover, she was hanging on her phone behind he bar for a weird amount of time. If I were the manager I'd move one of my waitresses behind the bar instead of this schlub. The drinks were fine. You can't screw up a ginger an coke and a draft beer. We'll be back for drinks and small appetizers, but there are better options of bars in the area.
2018-03-30,1,Standard bro-ey NJ bar but that's fine. Decent DJ doing the standard ADD switch the song every 60 seconds set. Management / security is the problem. Their method of kicking people out of the bar is undignified and humiliating. I saw the bouncers aggressively drag girls dangling from their wrists out of the bar while another security guard shining a flash light and strobing it on their faces. A friend of ours used a Juul in the bar, which is, admittedly, not permitted in most bars, but rather than a warning, friend was dragged out while a flashlight was shined in his face, like he was a criminal or something. Even if he were escorted out in a respectful manner, I wouldn't be writing this review, but instead they decide to have some sadistic, degrading, and ultimately pointless means of kicking people out. Meanwhile, they took his Juul and wouldn't give it back, which is private property. The classlessness of this place has made me glad to not ever give them another dollar again, as well as the group of friends with me. Fortunately, this bar is the definition of generic, so I can go to the other 6 bars within a 2 block radius and have pretty much an identical experience.Also, side note, there were napkins all over the floor. When I walked in I shook my head as it's a new and disturbing trend that douche bags throw bunches of napkins in the air when their favorite song comes on. To my dismay, I saw that it was none other than the bartenders themselves. This place will be a hard pass for me from now on.
2018-03-12,3,My place for an after work beer with an upbeat atmosphere across from the HOB PATH station.
2018-03-09,1,It should be illegal to have a beer list that you can't order from whenever the bar is operating. What's the point? Came here on a nice day, only place with outdoor seating since it wasn't officially nice weather time yet. Took a seat outside. Took forever to get service, when we did order our beers, the waitress couldn't find the stout my girlfriend wanted so she came back with every beer made by that beer company and asked to pick one.None of them were stouts.After that we got attention from a different waitress.And then no one for like a year.The check was $12.80, we left $13 on the table and walked out.1 out of 5, 2 out of 10, 3 out of 30.Same beers available/beers on menu ratio.
2018-02-23,3,Classic old bar, cool spot. Friendly staff, right across from the train station so super convenient.  The night I was their was a wed night & not crowded,  found 2 seats at the bar with no problem.  Loved that the whole front of the bar can open to the outside, and does have some outdoor seating too.  After a few drinks we order the hot pretzel... when it came out...OMG,  in it's own pizza box it was Huge and Delish...with 3 dips!  Will definitely get that again !
2018-01-24,5,Great food. Got wings and friend, Mac & cheese & a flatbread. Great food and great service. Vodka and pineapple never fails me too
2017-11-26,3,Great place to hang out after the game. Good drinks and no long waits. Never had any bar food but the hospitality is pretty good.
2017-11-21,3,Classic Hoboken Bar - fun, pricey and just good times with friends. Place is right across the street from the Hoboken Path station so it is super easy to stop in after work with friends. Ordered food from here the other day and it was surprisingly good? I ordered a pretzel and that came in a mini personal pizza size. Although it was a giant pizza it was not super dense and it was paired quite nicely with the cheese sauce, spicy mustard and the apple cinnamon butter dipping sides.Nachos - huge portions and it was actually pretty good! I would definitely order it again! The chili is quite delicious with the beans and chips and salsa combo, perfect to wash down with some beer or alcohol.Stop in whenever for a great time. Nothing special. Its a Hoboken bar.
2017-10-28,1,Service and food is okay. This review pertains to management. I went to Texas Arizona for a football game and stepped outside for 2 minutes to feed my parking meter. Upon my return I was told that I needed to make the line with everyone else that was trying to get into the bar. It would have been fine had it not been halloween night... the line was around the corner. I told the bouncer that I was re-entering and I still had a tab open at the bar to see if he would let in without waiting in line. He called the manager. The manager walked me in, escorted me to the bar and told me I had to close out and leave to make the line again. Mind you... My party was still sitting at the bar. My unfinished drink was still at the bar. It seems ridiculous to not allow re-entry. Especially when the customer had explained the situation.
2017-10-21,5,Even if you don't go for the food or drinks, go for the waitress Nicole. Not only is she attentive and quick, she is kind, smart, and beautiful. Get the Nacho Supreme.
2017-10-07,1,If I could give the service 0 stars I would. I had to ask for our dirty empty plates to be removed from the table, even though our server walked by at least three times, as well as ask for more drinks. Our waters sat empty from the beginning  of the experience, and every single staff member noticed them when walking by yet did nothing about it. It was as if our server was avoiding our table.... and every other staff member. No teamwork whatsoever. The beet salad- skip it. The beets are from a can!! The bartenders, although not serving us, were turned around on their phone the entire time as I noticed because I used to be a bartender. Just an awful experience all around. We will not return, and I was very excited about this place since we are new to Hoboken.
2017-09-16,1,Went to this bar to meet up with friends on a Saturday night.  I've been there multiple times and loved the place. Tonight I was denied entry because I was wearing a Jacob Eason UGA football jersey. The door man said no jerseys were allowed which is understandable. I took it off and had a white t shirt underneath and the female I was with told the door man she would put it in her purse.  He said he still couldn't let us in. I've never been denied to a a Hoboken bar let alone Tex az. Didn't argue with him just told him I'd never be back
2017-08-04,4,The place has a good ambience. Sweet dance music. Not EDM.  And the sandwiches are quite decent. If you want to catch a game of football, highly recommend this joint.
2017-07-15,5,This place is great. Its right near the water in Hoboken and in the liveliest area. Its the perfect place to eat or barhop. The waitress Nicole was super nice and personable. She helped us out with the menu and was super accommodating. She recommended the chicken bacon ranch flatbread and we loved it! I will definitely come back for her and the flatbread!
2017-07-15,3,The only reason I'm leaving a 3 star review is because the bar tender Heather, she works on weekends, is awesome. She was very attentive, made small talk with everyone at the bar, and was just sweet in general. Once her shift ended, Rasheed and another girl(Christine or Kristine) with bad eyebrows took over. They spent most of their time fraternizing with other associates and friends and It took me 30 minutes to order food at a bar full of 3 people including myself because the bar tenders were so caught up in gossip and their cellphones from the night before. Apparently there's a"Jeff" who runs the bar but clearly when he's not around the associates don't give the customer service that is needed.
2017-06-02,3,This sports bar/restaurant was conveniently located across the street from the Hoboken train station. The good - the Pretzel for Two was awesome, and huge! So fresh, and served in a pizza box with three dips - honey butter, cheese and mustard. The other big bonus was the extensive bottled beer list. I also had a Caesar salad and was pleasantly surprised to have the dressing on the side without asking. The salad had lots of Parmesan cheese which made me happy! The wings were also good. The burgers were not so great (one tasted like dishwater, according to my friend - he didn't eat more than a couple bites). The steak salad another friend had was just ok. Now the bad - OMG the service was terrible. After our food was ordered, I'm not sure if we saw our waitress again. At some point we just asked a waitress walking by for our bill. And it wasn't just the waitresses, I waited a long time at a not crowded bar for a beer prior to dinner. Even with the slow service, I would go back for that pretzel, and a beer!
2017-03-21,5,Big. Roomy. Good drink selection. Little dark but worth visiting. Only stayed for two hours or less but enjoyed the atmosphere and prices.
2017-03-03,3,I've been to Texas Arizona a handful of times barhopping around Hoboken. It's your typical college sports bar, with many 20 somethings, macro brews galore, and tons of TVs showing the games.It's right across the street from the train station, so a lot of people come here to start the night I guess. One side of the space has more tables, I guess for people who wanna eat. I'm usually on the bar side, which has a few tables, but is more of an open space where people can dance. Drink prices are average for Hoboken.I don't like that the bathrooms are down the stairs. The men's room was pretty gross and there were people doing drugs in there.
2017-02-28,3,Disappointing experience. For starters, security wouldn't let my husband in with his consular ID, even though is a government issued document. We were meeting friends here so we came back after going home to pick up his passport. We were there fairly early (around 8:30) on UFC night, so they gave us a great table close by the bar, the place was still empty. Ordered food and drinks. Mac and Cheese was amazing. Quesadilla was good. Sweet server brought us free green tea shots (tasted awesome, btw) Bar was super packed by then. Then the manager shows up and says "we have to go because our table is the middle of the way". We asked for the check and were waiting for the cards to be charged when he shows up to TAKE THE TABLE AWAY. Ridiculous!
2017-02-15,3,Train back to River Edge Saturday night was delayed and went in for a drink.  Lively spot, you absolutely positively do not belong in this place if you are over the age of 25.  Seriously, let the youngins do what they do.  $6 pinot grigio and I was not complaining.  Bartender ladies are super super pretty.  Perky.  I'm giving it 3 stars because the kid at the door did check my ID.
2017-02-11,1,Stopped there on way home from the city was starving, ordered food that was absolutely disgusting, would have sent it back but the bartender was consumed with talking to her waitress friend and her phone, I ate half and spent the next day sick with serious  stomach issues
2017-02-09,5,The secret to this place is to come late at night on a weekday and order some Exit 4 beer. It's my favorite beer and a strong one and they sell it cheap compared to some other places or beers. Avoid the crazy sports crowds and weekend nights and you'll love the place.
2017-02-05,5,Best place to hang out with friends! Samantha is the best and prettiest bartender! :)
2017-01-22,3,Server forgot to bring us menus, took forever to get our order placed. Appetizer sampler wasn't bad but it says it feeds 6 people, maybe 4. It was an average place so three stars is fair.
2017-01-21,5,Great sports bar!!! I absolutely love it. Great bar food and fun atmosphere. Definitely my go to sports bar.
2017-01-14,1,This is the type of bar you go to once and decide you'll never go back. Let me spare you the trouble and tell you to steer clear. Of all the bars I've been to in Hoboken, which has been most, this by far has the worst service. John Taffer would have been disgusted by how long it took to get served. I'll admit the bar was at capacity but never in my life has it taken so long to order a drink. The highly disrespectful blonde bartender at the side bar bounced back and forth, often to what seemed like different friend groups, dishing out friend drink prices. After about 20 minutes, I finally caught her eye and asked for 4 Bud Lights. She then proceeded to take orders and make drinks for two other people and when I asked if she could get my drinks when she had a chance, she screamed something that I couldn't hear and walked away. The bar back got involved and asked me if I had paid for drinks the drinks she was supposed to get me. Apparently since I had not, he told me to go to another bar. I bluntly told him that this was the worst service I've ever encountered and as I went to leave, he channeled  Michael Scott and did the whole "I'm not going to let you quit... You're fired!" Next thing I know, a bouncer is approaching me on my walk out and to give credit where it's due, the bouncer seemed to recognize how level-headed I was and when I briefly explained my encounter with the staff at the side bar and that I was walking out, he told me I didn't have anything to worry about, that he wasn't going to touch me, and in fact, I'm not even sure if he walked me to the door. Considering you're not going to go somewhere for the bouncers, this place could not be more of a waste of time. Go to any other bar, seriously.
2017-01-01,1,Horrible!!! Food-horrible, drinks-terrible, people-rude, i've been to this place before it was  horrific, decided to give a second chance due to the "good" reviews from other people and we left even more disappointed and will never go back, will not recommend this place to my worse enemy...
2017-01-01,1,Well..I will never ever enter this establishment again... after paying 20 bucks to get in along with 4 other friends.  We except for one went outside to leave.  Noticing one of our friends was still inside we wanted to re-enter and get him.  Now ..two  of us are white.. my friends GF is black latino and our missing friend is asian and his GF is afro-american.  Upon realizing he was missing the GF afro..asked the bouncer  (who happens to be white and fat) to go back in..he proceeded to use racial slurs against her. My friends GF..latino asked why he was being rude..and why we were kicked out.. he claimed falsely that he hit him...REALLY. REALLY..he weights a ton. And if she did hit him..I'm sure the cops would have arrested her.  After going back and forth the asian guy popped out and we left.  The professionalism is lacking..I also believe the booze is water down ..totally.. and way over priced.. ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!
2016-12-28,1,Update. Tried this place again. I had to wait 5 minutes to order a drink because that bartender was taking her time talking to her friend. I ordered a bourbon and coke, which must have blown her mind since I had to explain what it was. Weak pour in a small, old fashion glass and was charged $10. Was very close to not leaving a tip whatsoever. Left and am once again in the bar next door. This place gets trashier with every visit. No power tripping bouncer this time, so I guess that's an improvement...
2016-12-17,1,We were waiting in line for santacon until our friends were rudely "kicked out of line" by the bouncer. They went out of line to go to a nearby restroom and wanted to come back to secure their place in line. All of a sudden, the bouncer kicked them out of line and told them to walk away from the vicinity, without an explanation. My friends politely asked for the reason and got the answer "you're being retarded." The bouncer is a heavy set male with a beard. No one deserves to be called retarded and no one should be disrespected like that for no reason. We were being cooperative and had to inform the cops. Never coming here again
2016-12-02,4,First time here and the vibe was great! It was on a friday night for drinks with friends.It was PACKED bc their was a college game on.A lot of tables and TVs. Beer was $6 i believe which isnt too bad. Did t have any food but def wiuld give a try for a game if I was in the area.
2016-11-19,1,Absolutly terrible! Kicked off our table after spending 3+ hours ordering food and drinks the entire time. After losing our table, rudely moved from our spot by one of the staff members. After spending so much time and money at a place you would hope they would show you some respect but I guess not. Also, the queue for the women's restroom was awful!*our waitress when we had a table was amazing so props to her! Thanks Nikki!
2016-10-29,1,Bouncers and managers were completely biased, rude and unprofessional. After standing in line for over an hour, the bouncers let at least 20+ friends of their own cut the line and get into the bar free of charge. Once it was our turn to get into the bar, the bouncer & manager randomly started a charging cover. If you are going to start charging a cover, at least make it at standard time, not 9:21pm..The bar was pretty much empty and no fun. Not coming back here anytime soon. Worst bar in Hoboken.
2016-10-23,1,Let me start out by saying that I've been here for most of the Penn State games over the past few years, mainly because it's considered the "Penn State" bar in Hoboken. We called ahead this time only because I shattered my kneecap recently and we wanted to make sure that we had a table. I can't stand for a long time and this was my first outing without crutches. I should have used them based on what happened. Maybe they would have been more sympathetic. Then again, judging by the attitude of the staff, maybe not. Anyway, I knew we couldn't make reservations but they said that if we came between 6pm and 7pm (for an 8pm game), we should be able to get a table for the 6 of us. We arrived just after 6pm and it was not too busy. We waited at the host stand for close to 10 minutes and we never saw a hostess. There were a few tables empty, including a hightop 4-seat table. We finally asked a server if we could have a table. She looked around and pointed at the 4-seat table and we said that was fine. We asked if we could possibly move a 2-seat hightop table that was nearby and she said "Sure! I'll get someone to move it over." No waitress came over. After sitting at the 4-seat table for 20 minutes, we decided to at least move the chairs from that table over to ours. A waitress came over and reprimanded us for taking the seats. We said that another server told us that she would move the other table over but she never did. She rolled her eyes and was clearly upset about it. She asked who said that, we pointed to the other waitress, and she went over to ask her about it. After that, the waitress who reprimanded us said that we could not only not have the 2-top table. In addition, we now couldn't have the 4-top table either because another party needed it. She was not apologetic nor did she seem to care about making me get up (Keep in mind, I have a huge brace on my leg. No crutches today, but I'm clearly injured.) We were a little upset since they asked us to leave the table but didn't offer us another nor give us a timeframe of when we could get one. As I said, it wasn't even too busy yet. As we stood there deciding what to do, we heard the waitress call us names to some other servers. I saw her laughing with some staff over by the bar. A friend went over to talk to the hostess to tell her the situation and ask for another table as there were still a few free. In fact, there was a 6-seat hightop table that was empty directly behind the host stand. My friend asked if we could get a table, explaining that we'd been here for 30 minutes already, a person in our party has a broken leg, etc. At that time, the nasty waitress came over and told him to stop "harassing" the hostess. He wasn't harassing her. He just wanted something to be done so that we could sit. By this point, I wanted to leave but walking anywhere is really hard so my friend really wanted to make this work. She said, "Yes, it was a miscommunication but this isn't our problem." I really hope that she was just a waitress and not a manager. This was the time where we should have asked for a manager. Our bad. Then, my friend asked if maybe we could have the table directly behind her. To which she responded, "Absolutely not. That's the owner's table." Now, I understand if the owner wants their own table. They're entitled to that. They own the bar. However, based on the unpleasant experience that we had, the waitress with an attitude, the fact that we come here almost every Penn State game (with usually a larger group), and, most importantly, the fact that a person in the party needs a seat due to an injury, I would expect that had the owner been present, he would have given up the table. The waitress was not willing to talk to the owner or a manager. Now, I work in the industry. In fact, prior to my accident, I bartended just on the weekends at bar in Hoboken. I know that if the owner where I work heard this story, they not only would have given us the "owner's table", but we would have gotten an apology, probably a round of free drinks, and that server would be fired. I've never written a bad Yelp review before because, as I said, I work in the industry and I know how seriously they are taken if the owner reads them. Hopefully something will be done about this. Maybe I can attribute this to one bad waitress. However, if it's not addressed, not only did that one waitress not care about customers, I can assume that the people who run the establishment (owners, managers, etc.) don't care either. They'll be losing out on quite a few large parties for Penn State games. It's a shame because although the waitresses and bartenders aren't particularly friendly (Maybe they're just usually really busy when I go here so I've never used that against them), I like this place because of the ambiance on college football Saturdays. The friends who were with me have already vowed to not set foot in Texas Arizona again. I may not either. Terrible, humiliating experience.
2016-09-01,2,Decent place. Loud here. Bartender let me taste a couple beers. Half way thru the beer I settled on I realized there was dried food stuck to the inside of my glass. The bartender instantly got pissed at me for some reason. I heard a few F Bombs as she stormed off. Strange.
2016-08-06,5,First time here and it was a blast. A great place for happy hour or a night out. This spot is right off the Path train so no driving needed! The bartenders are on the money. ( if you don't know what "on the money" means don't go to Texas Arizona)
2016-08-03,1,I called in to speak to the manager about the incident that occurred last weekend and to be completely blunt, it didn't seem like anybody cared AT ALL about their unprofessional staff that work the door at their bar. The "manager" that I spoke to wasn't apologetic in any way about the incident that happened, didn't seem too concerned that his bouncers are causing such issues within his customers, and he basically blew my off by telling me he'd have to let his general manager know and have him call me back - NEVER CALLED. I will never go back to this bar again and I will make sure to let other people know how unprofessional their staff is as well as the miserable experience my boyfriend, friends and I had there on any social media outlet that is public I can.
2016-06-26,1,Worse experience on our 7 day New York vacation. We were approached by the rudest most unprofessional " manager" ever. Obviously they hire just about anyone off the street because he was far from professional! We will definitely not recommend this establishment to any of our friends.
2016-06-11,1,Came in, was told I could sit anywhere. Sat at a table for 15 minutes with no service. The place was relatively empty, more waiters than customers. Waiters just talking amongst themselves. Eventually I left.
2016-05-13,5,AWESOME BAR! This is my go to bar in Hoboken. Nice and friendly bar tenders and good looking one's as well. I love this place mostly because they got my favorite beer "Red Stripe" and good environment and good people.
2016-05-01,1,I visited once with my friend after work and our waitress was actually drunk. She made us feel so uncomfortable. She took our order of two drinks and then I was feeling cold and live near by so went to get coat for me and my friend. I returnedn & we were still waiting 15 minutes later and she walked by & said oh my god I completely forgot about your drinks. Eventually we got our drink & when we wanted to order another round we asked the security guard if he could get our waitress so we could order because we hadn't seen her in awhile. I'm patient but seriously, she was not doing a good job as a waitress. We also told the security guard that she was drunk & he didn't seem shocked. The second time I visited with my husband was on a quiet Sunday at 5.30pm. The place was not busy and again our waitress was terrible. She gave us attitude when we asked to order a drink. Then she couldn't remember our order, when we reminded her she then forgot that we ordered food. We had the 'spicy guacamole' and I would not recommend it. It didn't look or taste fresh and had no spice. The chips were stale. We ordered moscow mules - and they came in a small glass, no copper cups, and tasted watered down. When we were ready to go, we had to ask for the cheque three times. I think if this place was in any other location it would not do well! It's bad service & food would see it go out of business. There are way better bars to give your business to!
2016-04-13,4,Great time being their friendly environment great options of beer and overall good place to drink with friends.
2016-03-25,3,Went in for some drinks and wings. The margarita was good but I have tried better. The buffalo wings were delicious, maybe a little too dry. It came with carrots and celery, however I was very disappointed with how dehydrated the carrot was. I loved how it is so close to the Hoboken terminal, very convenient!
2016-03-23,1,This was the worst service that I have received in as long as I can remember. This is also the only yelp review I have ever written......I just felt the absolute need to voice this experience. I'm just writing it in hopes  that it may provide some insight and that the management will take it seriously and address the glaring problems with the service.I don't expect much when just going to the bar and ordering a bottle of cider and some shots for a friends birthday, just maybe a smile, or some sort of acknowledgement other than what all four of us deemed as an extremely sourpuss face and obvious distaste in serving anything at all.  To top it off the bartender too her long hair out of her ponytail while still standing in the service area only to walk over to stand right outside of it and whipped out a can of hairspray and proceeded to spray it all over her head and then throw her hair back up. Wow. I never leave less than a 20 to 25 percent tip anywhere I go, being in the service industry myself, I sympathize with servers and bartenders and consider that they may be having a bad day or there are a myriad of things that could not be their fault affecting service. This was just a blatant bad attitude and serious unprofessionalism, even in a laid back sports bar environment. Just unacceptable, will most likely never go back.
2016-03-20,2,Came here for lunch on a sunny Saturday before heading to the city.  Texas Arizona is a good option for days like these because they have outdoor seating right across the street from the Path.  When we arrived the inside was pretty empty and we asked to be seated outside to take advantage of the great weather.  Once seated our very friendly waitress quickly came by to take our drink orders and to inform us that there was a delay in the kitchen   I ordered the Chipotle Chicken Panini and my boyfriend had the Ring of Fire Burger.  We expected a delay in getting our food considering the delay, but not 45 minutes.  Waitress was extremely apologetic (I don't blame her, obviously not not her fault), but when the food did arrive 3/5 meals were barely warm, and one order was not completely correct.Overall; waitress was great, food was mediocre at best, nice outdoor seating, and close to the Path.  Wouldn't recommend Texas Arizona as my first choice for lunch, but a better option for drinks/bar food.
2016-02-29,5,Place is amazing. Filled with great people. And I would and am going to tell everyone hie much fun this place is.
2016-02-26,5,You have got to try the salmon club with the ale mac n cheese. These 2 items are to die for!!!!!
2016-02-24,1,The place was half empty.  Order a Guinness at the one bar in the back.  Bartender says you have to go to the other bar to order that.  How about a Light beer?  Same thing, go to other bar, this is the craft beer bar.   Ok, easier to walk across the street.  Bet the owner would be pissed if he knew the idle staff was talking patrons out of ordering alcohol.
2016-02-21,4,Texas is a great happy hour place!! Right across from the PATH/train station. Very convenient for people in New York, Hoboken and other parts of jersey! I have he everything there from beer to margaritas to mixed drinks and wine. They have two bars and both are stocked with great drinks and tenders!! I very rarely eat there but I have had a sampler (delicious mozzarella sticks) and buff chicken sliders which were great also!!
2016-02-06,3,Don't have a "no camo" dress code and have your bouncer at the door wear a camo hat with the bar's name on it. What kind of place in Texas or Arizona wouldn't let you wear a camo jacket? Really stupid rule.
2016-02-01,1,Biggest Scammers!!! Patrons beware!!!!! This establishment will OVERCHARGE your account and will make no effort to help. We visited on a saturday evening and my bill that was $68 was charged $100 and they failed to inform the customer that it is an authorization hold. I would think that would be something to be mentioned before hand, since I have never heard of any restaurant/bar doing that and it does not take much an effort to inform your patrons of this. On top of that they charged my boyfriend $194 for drinks that we did not order. Their excuse is that whoever ordered drinks and said to put it on his tab, that they did so. That makes no sense as it is his credit card and he should be the only one to say what is on his tab. And no one from our group put anything on his tab. When confronting the bartender (Anthony) and asking who of our group who were all present stated to put their drinks on my boyfriends tab, he refused to answer and proceeded to say the conversation was retarded. Thanks so much for all your help. As a business,  the managers and employees should reflect a certain image, and none did so. When trying to figure out a resolution, not a single person offered any help. SO, beware, especially of ANTHONY and all managers as they are con artists running this business!!
2016-01-30,2,If you like a bridge and tunnel, PATH riding aging coeds during the week and steelers fans on the weekend during foitball season this spot is for you.
2016-01-29,1,This place is the worst. The staff is rude and standoffish, and they think they can get away with treating their customers like shit because they're close to the path so they get a lot of business. I tried to go back and get my card which I had forgotten after taking my girlfriend here for her birthday and the staff told me I would have to come back in the morning. The manager was rude and drunk and wouldn't give me my card despite me pleading that I couldn't return in the morning because I work a 9-5 weekday job like most people. If you like being treated like crap while being charged exorbitantly for drinks, Texas Arizona is your bar. Just remember to bring a dildo for when they fuck you in this ass. Skip this place.
2016-01-26,5,Came here Tuesday night for a drink w the girls. Fun and very casual atmosphere. It's the kind of place you can roll in w sweatpants, grab a drink & some wings. Our waitress name was Sarah and she was great. She greeted us when we walked in, walked us to our table and checked in every 15 mins w us. She also made sure to share her favorite apps and drinks to Order. I hope she's working next time I come back, she really made the experience. I didn't eat.. So I can't comment on the food. But the pretzel appetizer looked really good!
2016-01-21,4,not a food review, just a bar reviewfun lively place, not AS young as most of Hoboken, you can be 26 here and you are old! In some of the bars. This is not a quite place to grab a drink, its a fun spot for a few friends, or out of towners.
2016-01-18,4,Location, location, location. This is pretty much the first bar in sight from the Hoboken PATH station. I've never eaten here (as far as I recall) but they have tons of TVs, draft options, and good looking bartenders.
2016-01-11,3,I've been here a few times as local resident. Football Sunday's. Random late Saturday night flight nights. Lots of tvs. Good for that.  Food is so-so but it's a bar so you should know what to expect. We came here on a Monday after work. If you down with some bar food and strong drinks (usually a plus) and want to watch the game, place is good.
2016-01-09,5,Awesome bar! We are visiting from San Diego! I really really hope that they give some good props or rewards for our bartender Melissa! She was very sweet! And very efficient! Super awesome and just showed us the best service in New Jersey! On top of her game all night!!!
2015-12-02,3,I come here every now and then after work and the service is mediocre at best. Tonight I stop in after a long hard day of work and I am not greeted by a single person. It seemed that the two women behind the bar were deliberately avoiding me! After about 20 minutes one of the bartenders whose name I learned was Juliana asks me if I'm okay, to which I respond I haven't had anyone help me yet. She immediately apologizes and buys me two drinks which I greatly appreciated. The other bartender (I think her name was Michelle) seemed only interested in entertaining her friend, roommate and their companions. Not once did she acknowledge me during the time I spent there. It seemed that she left Juliana to work the entire bar by herself. I also overheard her speaking poorly of some patrons who just left calling one of them "psycho."  If it wasn't for Juliana and her great customer service and great tasting margaritas I would have been totally dissatisfied and only rated one star. I suggest that you train your bartenders to be more attentive.
2015-11-20,1,I went to this bar with friends while participating in the Hoboken Halloween Bar Crawl this year as I see another poster did as well. We waited in line for about an hour, and by the time we got up to the front we were told we'd have to pay a $10 cover charge to get in. When we questioned as to why one of the bouncers (the other looked out of it) told us our bar crawl tickets and/or wristbands were not valid anymore. This was at around 10 PM, when on the bar crawl ticket it was stated that we should be let in for no charge until 2 AM. I had already paid close to $30 for a ticket that was supposed to waive me of cover charges at several Hoboken bars, so I was pissed. Several other bars that were included on the ticket also told us after 8 PM our tickets were not valid. I contacted the people at PubCrawls.com and was fed a bunch of excuses as to why my night was so terrible and unprofessional. If you were to read their Facebook page (I Love Pub Crawls) you can see that many other people had the same experience (including pub crawls in other cities). I would advise against purchasing a ticket through PubCrawls.com or SquadUp and just paying normal cover charges, you would actually save money. I will not be going back to Texas Arizona or any other of the bars included in this scam unless the get their act together.
2015-11-03,1,11/1/2015.  Daughter here from out west. We went to Texas Arizona "Frat Boy/Animal House " .  It was football Sunday . Dozens of  loud, boisterous, drunk young men in their 20s with a beer in hand watching the game(s) , We could not get any bartenders attention and the mostly young male patrons were "saving seats " for the friends.   I overheard one man on his cell saying "Hurry up and come on over , you can just order one draft beer ($6?) and sit for 6 hours watch both NFL games without buying anything else"  . We Immediately turned around,walked out and went to Hotel Victor Bar a few doors away.
2015-10-31,1,My boyfriend and I were participating in the 2015 Halloween bar crawl. We waited in line for an hour and a half under the impression that the bar was participating in said bar crawl until 2 am as advertised. We when got to the front of the line my friend, who had a bar crawl wrist band, got in without paying the cover. However after she entered at 12:30 we were informed we needed to pay 20 dollars per person to go inside. After questioning why the wristbands were no longer valid before 2 am, we were kicked out of line without any explanation. While waiting in line before getting the front, we asked another bouncer if the bands were still valid. He was visually intoxication and shrugged and walked away. This bar acted very unprofessional and I will not be returning.
2015-10-07,4,Depends on the night you go,  some nights the crowd is pretty d-baggy other times much better.   Food was good.  Great location near the Path train and when the weather is nice the doors are open.
2015-09-27,1,This place gave me food poisoning. It's cheap bar food, how could they mess it up?!  Actually, prices aren't cheap, but the quality certainly was. I'd give them no stars if I could. Beware! Also, for a sports bar, they try real hard to be jersey-trash clubby with their loud music and cheap decor. Pass on this place!
2015-09-24,4,Known Steelers bar located in Hoboken. Being a die hard Green Bay Packers fan, I'm obligated to root for my bf team when our teams aren't playing at the same time. This is a cool bar, not my first visit but my first review.From a fan perspective, my bf enjoyed the fact that they played Steelers music and actually had audio for the Steeler game. He didn't understand why they played other games at a Steelers bar but whatever. Ordered this $30 sampler which is worth it if you like all the different appetizers. The potato skins were extremely dry so it was like eating potato chips lol. Everything else was ok but probably won't get the sampler next time. Texas has tons of beer selections which keeps me going back. If you're a Steelers fan, definitely worth checking out.The only other negative which was new to me is they have an appetizer & drink minimum for the table. Each patron has to purchase at least 1 appetizer & 2 drinks. I've never been to a bar with a drink/food minimum. Overall, good experience but I enjoyed it more during football preseason. My bf loved it so much be a Steelers thing . I would visit again seriously and also a large hyped crowd hungry for football and extremely cool people, I had a blast all things considered. There is also various age groups which was also different.Go Pack Go but this is seriously a Pittsburgh Steelers bar 3 for service & experience.4 for atmosphere and good times
2015-09-21,3,Since this is located right across from the Hoboken's public transportation hub, there is always a crowd at Texas and a pretty fun one at that. Standard drinks, beers and grub for a decent price. There are plenty of TVs, which makes it a prime location for Sunday Funday action during  football season. Avoid it if you can't stand the Steelers or Penn State because fans/alumni gather here for the games. There are always decent specials so try it out for happy hour, football games, etc. At night on the weekends, the DJ is pretty good so don't be surprised if you see a few groups breaking out into dance. They waitstaff and bartenders are always pretty friendly and the bouncers take their jobs seriously so don't do anything stupid. I've never had a bad time here, but if your looking for something intimate or a little more refined I'd try something else.
2015-08-21,3,wayback machine mode: thousands of years before Sigourney Weaver, I ended the night of my 21st birthday here. seemed like a cool place and I made a few return trips, though since I lived further north in Hoboken this was usually the place to grab a drink either right before or after heading to/from the city.anywho - I ended a hiatus of many years recently when we took an NJTransit train to Hoboken from visiting friends in Ridgewood and were looking for dinner before hopping the PATH back to New York.fairly typical bar food menu trending towards spicier burgers/sandwiches. my buffalo chicken wrap was pretty good, though the fries oddly enough were a bit cooler than I expected (still not bad though). excellent beer list which I had forgotten about.waitress was friendly and the place was empty on a Sunday afternoon, so we got our food fast. prices are pretty typical for Hoboken bar food.
2015-08-12,3,OK, the reason I'm even writing this review was because of the negative experience I had there recently.  In the past, this was a good spot to get a good beer at a convenient location before catching a train to wherever.  The beer selection is above average  and the food is not bad.  But the service I had today was 1 star, at best.  First of all, the place has 2 bars and the one on the right is exclusively craft beer, so unless you're a craft beer snob that walks around with your nose held up high and refuse to drink a beer unless it was brewed in someone's bathtub, don't bother.  The d-bag working the bar is about as friendly as a biker on steroids.  Huge douche.  And by huge, I mean his personality was pretentious (totally unwarranted) and, well, he was fat.  Nonetheless, the service sucked.  He didn't even know what a Sam Adams was.  On what planet is Sam Adams not a beer?  Mars, perhaps.  So I migrated back to the normal side expecting the usual service.  Not today.  Just some blonde bimbo working on her tip with another group (take that however you'd like).  Anyway, it took about 10 minutes for another waitress to ask if I've been helped (she was cool but a 333 batting average is only good in baseball, if you get my drift).  Anyway, I'll be back the next time I miss my train, but I know who exactly to steer clear away from.
2015-07-23,5,Great beer spot right off the path train. Yeah I know it's jersey but what gives? Just shut up and have a good cold brew and enjoy the people gazing.
2015-06-17,3,Beginning of night: This bar is full of sloppy drunks and annoying d-bags. Get me out of here.Several Fireball shots later: LET'S DANCE, I LOVE THIS PLACE!But seriously, this bar can be fun. It does get crowded and at times, annoying. I will give them credit for a pretty damn good bottled craft beer selection behind the bar. Not exactly cheap - I paid 20 bucks for 2 bottles.
2015-05-26,1,My card was overcharged and after reading other reviews, this place has been doing it to people for years. I won't be coming back here.
2015-05-21,4,Stopped in for a burger. Got the Texas t&a burger. Cooked medium rare. I was very very happy. Can't go wrong with a fried egg and bacon on a cheese burger. Ever! I'll def come back for another. Friendly service as well. Except for the bouncer. Who took forever to read my id. Whatever. He must have been cranky.
2015-05-14,1,Horrible staff! never going there again...typical restaurant/bar, would prefer other places in the area over this.
2015-05-10,4,Great place for a Friday night! Wasn't crowded like the typical, small Hoboken bar. I felt like I was able to breathe and walk around, not feeling scrunched. The bartenders were super friendly, attentive and made drinks perfectly. The bar was right by the Hoboken train terminal and a parking lot was about a block away. The prices also weren't too bad. They also had outdoor seating. The only annoying thing was that the music was blasting, I wanted food but couldn't find a server to help me and the bathroom made me feel like I was trapped in a dirty dungeon.
2015-05-09,2,I came here last week to watch the Mayweather fight.  When I arrived, the line was out the door and down the street.  Mind you, it was FREEZING out.  At first, they were charging $15/person as a cover.  Fine, it's the big fight, I get it.  After 40 minutes in the cold, it was finally my turn to be let in.  $40 per person!  AW HELLZ NO!  [I threw a minor fit and my friend ended up paying for me but that's another story].At least the drinks were cheap once you made it through the door, but lets be real...still doesn't make the $40 cover feel any better.Texas Arizona is a standard, typical bar.  It's large, the bartenders are attentive, and the music (after the fight) was pretty decent.  I guess I'm still a little mad at how much they were charging.  I don't make enough money for this!
2015-05-03,1,I tried to eat here.i was sat outside and waited 35 minutes  no one came to greet us. I finally asked the secruity guy in the front where the waitress was. He found the hostess and she said the waittress was told we were there. The hostess didnt seem too concerned so we left, im not sure what happened as the restaurant was not too busy. Maybe it is better for just drinks.
2015-05-02,1,Spent the entire day there enjoying a few drinks... Was kicked for not paying a cover charge in the evening! Brilliant business plan. Kick out paying customers to collect a cover charge!
2015-04-28,3,I've gone here a ton of times at night or for day drinking and have had a great time. Well priced drinks (from Manhattan standards), young fun crowd and good music. However, I went for brunch recently and just thought the food was mehhh. They don't have a brunch menu, so you'll have to eat bar food on a hungover day at 12pm, but they do have a nice outside area to sit. One of those places that isn't a hidden gem since it is right off the Path, but you should try it for a night out.
2015-04-26,4,Very conveniently located near the path.Good service, tends to be busier during happy hrs and peak hours so service may tend to declineFood is typical bar/american food. Nothing bad but nothing specialWould recommend strictly for convenience
2015-04-25,3,Sticky floors, crowded, napkins all over the place, bar staff was fine and the drinks were pretty strong. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back, but if I were in the area, I might stop in for a drink.
2015-04-22,4,This is a bar to come with your buddies and watch sports, ton of TV'S, great Happy Hour and overall great food. We will be going back.
2015-03-26,5,I'm sure we all love our alma mater just as much as the next 20-something that still dreams about college life only to be rudely interrupted by our alarm clock reminding us that it's time to go to work.  Dating a Penn State alum, however, is like being in a cult by association.  So this past October when the Nittany Lions were playing in Ireland at the crack of dawn eastern time, we decided to hit up the only bar we could find that was open for the game at that hour.  Luckily, Texas Arizona is pretty sizable, which is good because we weren't the only people who had the idea.Texas is a great place to watch all kinds of sporting events with its strategically placed TVs all over the place.  The huge bars make it easy to get drinks quickly and return to your table which (at least at this time of day) was readily available for us.The breakfast/super early lunch we ordered during the game came out fast and hot and was delicious, and the drinks were reasonably priced and not watered down. If you're not from Hoboken, the PATH station right across the street makes Texas Arizona an easy spot to get to from anywhere in the area, including New York City.
2015-03-11,4,Great food and service!  I have gone to drink many times at Texas Arizona but never went to eat there - so I tried it.  The food was delicious!  We got the chopped salad, calamari, and mac & cheese - the mac & cheese was soooo good!  Our waitress was soo sweet!  I am allergic to quite a lot of fresh vegetables and looked at the menu and was unsure what fennel was - she immediately went to the kitchen to find out and googled me a picture - very nice!  I would definitely come back to Texas Arizona for another meal!
2015-01-25,1,Worst bar I've been to in Hoboken. Extremely rude bartender and bouncer. I've been here a few times because it's nearby, but I will never be spending my money here again. I definitely do not recommend. There are many bars in the area that are far better.
2015-01-09,3,Football watching bar. Young. Average food. Average service. My server was nice.
2015-01-06,5,Great place to watch sunday football near the train station. The prices are reasonable, and you never know when you'll bump into someone from your home town.
2014-12-30,2,This place had the best buffalo sliders. I went here recently expecting to enjoy a nice lunch but I was totally disappointed. They replaced the sliders with a buffalo chicken tender on a slider bun. It literally hung off the bun a inch on each side. Plus the guacamole was disgusting it had absolutely no taste to it. They serve it in a big clay bowl that would normally mean they made it fresh but it wasn't even edible. This spot has been downgraded to just drinks for me in the future. The staff was nice but that didn't help me forget how disappointing the food was.
2014-12-27,1,HOLY RUDE BARTENDER!  Absolutely ignored by the blonde bartender at the back bar this afternoon.  She didn't "help" me and my husband a good 10 min after we sat down...after she systematically finished her sandwich, greeted everyone else at the bar (who all had FULL glasses), and drank a full glass of water with a straw.  Lady, what did we do to you???  Oh yea, and the place was NOT full.  I will not be coming back here.
2014-11-24,1,Heads up -- Got a $50.00 charge on my card and I only purchased one drink. I called to bar to ask what the deal was. They said they charge all cards $50.00 at the bar on busy days to make sure there is enough money on it. They refund you the money later in the week. There is no sign and no one mentioned that to me. Would rather have paid cash if I knew than have to check my statement to make sure Texas Arizona refunds me money I didn't anticipate giving them for the week. Not cool
2014-11-11,3,Run of the mill bar/grill. Food was okay, drinks were decent and the staff was friendly. I loved the look of the place inside but it could be better. I'd go back.
2014-10-24,3,Texas Arizona is a bar right off the subway in NJ. It is a good size and the drinks  were not super expensive. Had plenty of TVs to watch a game. If you are looking for a place to grab a drink between trains go here. You can make it back down to your train in 3-5 minutes.
2014-10-14,3,I went here for drinks and food with a friend during happy hour on a Wednesday. The menu had some good variety - I went with the buffalo chicken sliders af the waitress' recommendation. Food was pretty good, simple bar food. The drink specials seemed to be what brought most poeple in though. However,  be warned that the back bar (while enticing with the array on craft beers beckoning from the glass door fridge) does NOT honor the happy hour specials and thr bartenders will not tell you that. I was warned by a fellow patron. But when we did grab drinks from the front bar, there were at least 6 different beers for $3 pints and I loved that they has Shiner Bock which I haven't seen elsewhere. My friend was even happier that they had cider on draft and on special for $4. I'd definitely comr back for happy hour drinks. And there's even a nice patio space to enjog drinks outside when the weather is nice.
2014-09-29,3,I only visit this place for their nachos which is amazing to say the least. They have recently increased price of all their food items given their prices were already on the higher end for the experience you get.
2014-09-27,2,This place is crowded even on slow nights and the music is good, but the bouncer and bartender were very rude to people in my group.Keep in mind this place isn't divey, but it's not classy either.  Upon entering, a male in my group was dressed really nicely, much more formally than anyone in the place, but had two buttons on his shirt unbuttoned and the bouncer gave him attitude about buttoning them up as two other girls in my group walked in with very lowcut shirts. What is your problem, dude? We go to the bar and ordered shots. We were in a really large group so while she was pouring the shots we were gathering everyone's money and counting it to pay her. I guess waiting two minutes was too long for here because she rudely yelled at the friend who was counting the money and pulled the shots off of the bar. The friend counting the money is a bartender and always tips well... so when she gave us back our tip money for the bartender and refused to tip her she must have felt really mistreated.I'd maybe stop in to try the food, but probably not.
2014-09-25,4,Recently moved to Hoboken from Pittsburgh, only to find out this is a steelers bar. Food was solid, drinks reasonable ESP if you can get a table on Sunday's, and the steelers are always on what more could you ask for?
2014-09-11,2,Crappiest bar in Hoboken. Food stinks, drinks suck and the bathroom is god awful. 2 stars because our waitress was a nice girl.
2014-08-24,2,came here on saturday afternoon.  Got a table outside with three friends, the waitress spilled my friends beer on table twice, yet she didnt comp the drink.  Bathrooms looked like it was 2 am not 5 pm in the afternoon.  grilled cheese was really good though--rest of their food is just ok.
2014-08-17,1,Dirty glasses!!!! And water down Guinness!!!! It's soooo clear!!!! WTF!!!! First and last time
2014-08-09,3,Not much to say about this bar. It's alright. The bar itself is really big, but it gets very crowded at night. There's no room to stand and it's very hard to make your way to the bar. They play pretty good music, a lot of EDM when I went (which I am into), but because of the huge crowd, there's no room to dance.Service wasn't that great either. The bartenders are so slow. It's ridiculous. The drinks were decently priced for the area though. Overall, ok bar to start the night at, but I definitely won't be coming back here again.
2014-08-04,3,Went to Texas Arizona for the first time last Saturday. I'd say it's a decent bar but  it was really overcrowded. Good place to start off the night and have some drinks just for the sake of being around lots of people. Other than that, you can't really have a full blown conversation with your friends here and you can't dance so you're sort of in the middle. I just had my drink and was waiting to go to the next bar/lounge we were planning on going to. As for the drink, my boyfriend ordered a Rum & Coke for me and a Brooklyn Summer Ale for him and it came out to 12 dollars.
2014-07-24,4,Never had a bad time here! Night life is always fun and upbeat. Close to the path & train station which is a plus for me since I don't live in Hoboken. Definitely going back!
2014-07-06,4,How is this the only bar in Hoboken that played the Lyoto Machida vs Chris Weidman fight? My friends and I had a nice server named Dina? Dana? We requested the prelims to be played and she made it happen. Food was satisfying, they had good beers, and overall I had a fantastic time.Minus 1 star only because one of the wing sauces were SO salty and spicy at the same time...that I started to sweat after eating one wing. It was like...what I imagined eating a salt lick.
2014-06-30,1,Saturday afternoon the place was very, very quiet. We wanted to sit outside at one of the seven (at least) empty tables and drink a few rounds as we waited for friends to come into town via the PATH. NO LUCK. Hostess said tables are only for diners. Dumb move when the place was empty. Went down the block to the Victor Hotel. One, who would want to eat there anyway. Two, use your head.
2014-05-11,3,Great location. Lots of TVs. Hot bartenders. Average drinks. Good music volume. Usually packed on the weekends but always enough room to move around due to its large, open floor plan. Decent place but very average.
2014-05-08,1,I've never had the need to review a spot... Ever... But this place was just awful!! I live nearby and always in the Hoboken bars, figured me and my friend should try a new spot and came inside this place. We walked into a typical slow Sunday: tables were empty and bar full. We waited about five minutes to get sat down as I noticed the host stand. (We didn't want to be rude and just sit down if they had a set up of how to sit customers). I saw a worker pass right by us, both bartenders looked at us but nothing was done. It got me annoyed because they clearly don't care for customers. Any other establishment will immediately call someone over to help us, but not them. My friend approached a worker in the back and he told us we can sit anywhere and that he'll give us menus. Already upset we had to go to someone for assistance I tried to let it go. The guy was really nice to us and even helped my friend decide on a beer to drink. We ordered the beer from him and he said he'll be back. A minute later we get the most rudest server I've ever had. She came to us not even presenting herself, not even at the table but to the side poking her head out from the wall next to us, as if she had better things to do, and said with a nasty attitude "ok you can't order from him, I'm the server, this is my section, if you want to order anything you have to let me know" then leaves .... I assume he was probably the bus boy and went to her to tell her we were ready to order as she must have been our server.We assumed he was our server cause he was the only one helping us! And then we get this nasty girl basically yelling at us cause we ordered beer from him and not her? Maybe if you noticed you got sat and cared for customers we could have ordered from you. We sat there for about another five minutes in pure disbelief of her attitude waiting for her. We ended up asking another server if she can get our server. She finally comes and we're asking her "where are our beers?" She said .. Again with a nasty attitude "I told you he is not the server, so you need to order from me. Are you ready to order?" How in the world does that make sense!?!? It got me so mad! You were clearly told we were ready to order from the bus boy, you yell at us for ordering from him, you disappear, and have to get your fellow co worker to get you. I understand your our server but how can we even order from you if your ignoring us. And if you were a good sever you could have asked the bus boy what we ordered from him or even actually came to our table to take our drink order instead of giving us attitude. At this point I was about to lose it. We ordered our beers and calamari from her and even as she's taking our order her tone of voice was just ill mannered. Everything seemed as if we were a bother we sat at her section on a Sunday night. Sorry sweetie you probably wanted to head out early after a shift but as a server you throw your attitude and feelings out the window when you are working with customers. I regretted ordering the food and beer cause at that point I was in so much anger and in shock at how she was treating us. I ordered the check as soon as she finished taking our order. Even dropping the check she did with such disgust. After we got our beer and food she disappeared again, I saw more of the other server than our own. Finally she came back just to pick up the check. First time I ever left a place without tipping. I would have said something to the manager but I figured a Yelp review would get his/her attention more. Thank you Employee 14 Gisela A. Sorry table 7 was such a bother to your Sunday night shift and making sure my friend and I never step foot in there again.
2014-05-08,2,This place is always crowded on the weekends. Bartenders are not very attentive and don't really seem to care. Had some apps after work which were OK. Overall 2 stars.
2014-05-03,4,decent salmon wrap. good selection of foods to choose from and quite a few healthy options. pretty good all around
2014-04-27,1,If you like pubic hair in your food, this is your kind of place. Take my advice and stay away. Sad part is the management could care less.
2014-04-26,1,I had my first date here with my bf a year ago. We thought we'd go back back for our anniversary. We came in at 1 pm on a Saturday to find the place deserted. After standing at the entrance for a good awkward five minutes a waitress came by and asked what we needed. I asked if we are waiting to be seated and she have us a nasty glare. And I asked if we should seat ourselves and she said yes. After waiting another five minutes at the table with no menus, a couple of macho guys came in and were greeted immediately and given menus. At this point it felt like we were in actually in Texas or Arizona. We got up and left this homophobic disgusting establishment. I'm sorry that our first date was wasted here because we'll never go back.
2014-04-13,1,Went here today for the first time in a while with friends who I hadn't seen in a long time, thinking we would have a nice experience, but it was far from that. Our waitress, Colleen, was extremely rude to us and we kept having to flag down the bus boys when we needed something. I've been here numerous times in the past and never had a problem. When we had first sat down  it took about 20 minutes before our waitress even came over to the table. When we placed our order, Colleen informed us that we would have to put down a credit card, which I have never heard of before, but I did so, even though we all intended on paying cash. When the long lunch came to an end, Colleen gave us the bill with no card, and we asked her where my credit card was? She told us you have to pay first and then you get it back. She gave us no explanation and was very rude about the situation and was unpleasant overall during the entire lunch. In my opinion when you go out to eat, it's not only about your meal and the quality of your food but it's the quality of the service as well.
2014-04-05,1,Service SUUUUUUUCKS. Unless you're drinking at the bar. Food is mediocre. Prices are ok but I guess that's huge if your a 20 something paying Hoboken rent and just scraping by. Walk a few blocks. Many better places
2014-03-21,4,I have always enjoyed this bar...BUT TONIGHT....I have smelled some of the worst farts of my life here tonight. For the past 30 mins, we keep getting hit with a wave of what I can only describe as fecal matter and garbage having a baby.  Terrible.
2014-02-09,4,Came here Saturday night and absolutely loved it!!The proximity to the PATH station meant that there was a reasonable crowd when we got there around 9.By the time we left,the place was packed to the brim.The atmosphere was lively and fun,the drinks were good and the food was great.Had the chicken wings which were decent and the southwestern spring rolls which were so damn good!!The grilled chicken fajita was just the right amount of spicy and was amazing with the guac and sour cream and cheese.Absolute yumminess on a plate!!My only complaint is that the table for two was way too small and it was kinda hard trying to cram our plates into the small area without any going over the edge.But still this is definitely my backup place in Hoboken anytime I want to have a good time.
2014-02-08,1,WOW. Sat at the bar. At 7pm Saturday night. Not busy. Bar Tenders (4 of them!) stood there staring vacantly into space. Did not acknowledge our presence whatsoever. We were invisible. Waited 6 minutes for ANYONE to snap out of their stupor and serve us. SADLY NOT. We left.
2014-01-14,5,Jumped on the PATH train from Manhattan to visit my cousin visiting from abroad with his friends from East Rutherford to have some drinks and watch some college football one Saturday afternoon.It was conveniently right there as soon as I exited the train station.Do I remember how the appetizers tasted? Nope!Do I remember how good the drinks were? Nope!Do I remember any part of any of the football games? Nope!Did Texas Arizona have great bar service that I thoroughly enjoyed? Absolutely!There is so much said in what I didn't say. I want to thank who's ever idea it was to go here! I will be back!...it was a beautiful occasion!
2014-01-05,3,This place is usually pretty good. Drinks are pretty much on par with everywhere else. The thing I like about Texas Arizona is the back bar.  They have a few "specialty" beers most bars don't usually carry, such as Dogfish Head.
2014-01-04,3,Good beer selection, but can get crowded. Especially on weekends. Reasonably priced for a Hoboken bar, $6 bucks for a beer. They haven't been accepting credit cards for a while so bring cash! Bartender, however, oh man was not great. I ordered a beer, saw her pour it and watched her play with her phone. I thought she was going to pour more beer into the glass but nope. 2 minutes after it was poured she gave it to me. Bad service. 3 stars because of that!
2013-12-02,3,I have mixed feelings about the good 'ol Texas Arizona... Location: Right next to the PATH/Hoboken terminal (AKA awesome & convenient)Prices: Not horrible. They usually have game day and happy hour drink specialsAtmosphere: Dark, sports bar, ample TV'sClientele: Sometimes I go here and it isn't too crowded, get good service, and have a great time. It is a good place to watch a game. I don't really like to go here on Friday/Saturday nights (don't judge me, I am old and married. Well, not that old)... it gets super crowded and douchey... being so close to the train station, tons of people from *lord knows where* NJ flock to this place.Food: For bar food, not bad at all. I enjoy the buffalo chicken wrap, and the mega huge awesome nachos the most. I love nachos, and these are on steroids. Will I be back? YesWill I like it? Maybe
2013-11-11,5,My favorite bar in hoboken. Bartenders/servers are friendly! Drinks are yummy and cheap. Music is always pretty good too! Millions of tvs ... The few times I've eaten here the food has been decent too - I usually get the tuna wrap.. I think it's tuna .. or is it salmon? It's good regardless !I always have a good time here!
2013-11-06,2,This place is too pretentious for its own good. The bartenders- or should I call them beertenders- showed a complete lack of interest for their guests while they texted on their phones every two minutes. They were courteous and polite, but clearly not engaged. I asked for a margarita on the rocks.. what I got was a very poorly poured and not at all shaken glass of crap. I thought- I must be a tequila snob and I don't like their well tequila. When I asked the bartender what it was she replied Jose Cuervo Gold. I believe that a place in Hobo would use JCG as their well, so I thought I'd try another with a different tequila. To no avail this one was also complete crap. You would think they would highlight a great tequila assortment as well, but you're looking at patron, patron, patron, and oh.. JCG. Just sayin' Texas Arizona.. if you want to be that Southwestern kind of place.. it would be best if you train your bartenders better and teach them how to make a margarita. Other places in Hoboken manage that just fine and they are not Southwestern at all.
2013-10-30,4,Can be very crowded and filled with Jersey shore-esque types.But, the food is only slightly overpriced, basically good bar food, and it is a great place to watch the game when you can see the TV !That is how seriously crowded it gets, during Giants games (well when the Giants were good anyway) the place would fill to capacity and still have a line outside!  They have a lot of TVs but if you get there late you might have a bad view or possibly they wont let you in at all!I like it for Sunday games but be sure to get there early (at least an hour before and that is if it is a 1 pm game).FYI conveniently close to the PATH (right across the street) but to drive there, parking is horrible!p.s. if you are really lazy, you can park across the street for $20 for a few hours!
2013-10-30,4,Alright, I'll admit, I'm not from the big city and this could be what all Hoboken/NYC bars are like at happy hour on a Friday but I loved this place and am really glad my friends brought me here.Place was packed on a beautiful Friday afternoon but our group of four was able to get a table.  The service was steady.  Given the crowd, I expected empty drinks to sit for a bit before their replacements arrived.  I had just driven 9 hours and nothing was going to get me upset at that point.Things I loved:- The DJ.  Great mix of recent top hits and some throw back.- The drink specials.  It seemed un-American to turn them down.I had a blast here and would definitely go back.
2013-10-02,4,Every time my friends and I are here, we have a great time. Food is good, it's your typical bar food. Service is good, also your typical bar service. It a sports bar! If you're expecting 5 star service, ummmm not gonna happen. But you will have a good time. The staff is friendly, busy, but friendly; they play good music, and they have a pretty good selection of beers. Have a good time and take a fireball or two!
2013-08-22,3,Sports focused beer bar just steps from the PATH. My friend and I started out our Sunday funday here for a little break from the city. They didn't have a drink menu which was disappointing, only one for beers. I was wearing a sling and some drunk guy immediately asked me how I broke my elbow.. Def a place with lots of dudes chatting up with the bartenders in short shorts.Reasonably priced, yummy Picklebacks. Not a bad bar, I'd check it out again if I was in the area.
2013-07-24,5,If you like good bar food, beer, mega hot bartenders and sports, this place is for you. It's always a friendly crowd, and if your in the area for lunch, I'd strongly recommend this place. For 7$, you get a meal a side and a drink.Tvs everywhere, and they are very accommodating if there's a game you want to watch. The service is pretty good and it's as close as you can get to the trains or bus.It's pretty funny some  guys are complaining about what the bartenders are wearing, it's a sports bar, the birdcage is a short trip across the river.There is also Wi-Fi
2013-06-30,1,Does this place like to overcharge credit cards? Happened to myself and three of my friends that came here last weekend. BRING CASH IF YOU WANT TO DRINK HERE.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I'm going to rewrite my review on account that I wrote it when I was clearly upset (see the true statement above). My friends and I have yet to be refunded by the management (and I'm rewriting this review 2 months after the fact).  I added a tip on what to do if you get overcharged by this bar below this review! IMPORTANT TIPS ARE LOCATED AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS REVIEW.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SETTING: This sports bar is large with many TVs so you can watch any games you'd like.  I enjoyed the outdoor seating! The surround sound system and music is appropriately loud at nights.  The restroom for men and women are located downstairs. DRAFT SELECTION: Decent - only come here for drinks during happy hour  ($3 domestic pints).  If you don't, you may as well hit up the other bars in Hoboken and get more "bang for your buck."  FOOD: I have only purchased appetizers from this bar and its nothing to brag about.  Just buy appetizers during happy hour. SERVICE: Besides the weekend my friends and I got overcharged by the bartender? Horrible like a D- borderline F letter grade.  This used to be the place I frequently stopped by before catching the light rail home.  So normally.... I encountered waitresses/bartenders who are always texting or talking to their coworkers in the corner.  And as a former waitress, I think this is work ethic is rude as hell.  I hope these girls are not offended when they get 10% tip or less for this poor attitude.  And If I had to address the clothes -- it is not as bad or good as stated in the reviews. IMPORTANT TIPS: (1) Like I said, only shoot for happy hour drinks and appetizers. (2) Bring cash; if you don't, NEVER leave without a receipt.  This is the kind of bar you should stop by for a single drink then moving on to other/better bars in Hoboken. WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET OVERCHARGED BY THIS BAR: Call the manager, provide them transaction number, CVV (3 last digits on your card), how much they overcharged you, when they overcharged you, and the name of your shady server.  If they take more than three weeks to provide you a refund go to your bank and dispute the charges. Even if its a 3 dollar overcharge, they're probably doing it to more than one person (and according to this TA's reviews, they are overcharging tons of people) -- it's adding up like crazy.  So much for honest and genuine service guys and gals!
2013-06-21,3,Great place off the path to grab a drink. Its a fun place for sunday funday. It's a typical hoboken bar. Food is average. It does get pretty packed sometimes. Good crowd!Stop here on your bar crawl in Hoboken!
2013-06-20,2,Location, location, location they say. This is perfectly situated right in front of the Path train to Manhattan, making it a great meet up spot for friends travelling in between New Jersey and NYC. The outdoor space is sunny and relaxing.  Food is well priced although a bit on the dull side. It's nothing particularly unique but it does its job to fill the tummy.The "mixed drinks" however are watery and there's no cocktail menu (its 2013, how do they not offer cocktail menus?) but the beer menu is much better and their wines surprisingly on the better end of the deal.I don't have a problem with the waitresses being sexy but PLEASE for the love of god, cover your ASS when you are working on a Saturday afternoon at 2pm. There's a difference between "Hooters charm" and a strip club. The vibe overall is very "Jersey Shore" in every sense of the word. Lots of muscles, hair gel, and Ed Hardy, lots of lip gloss, tattoos, and high heels, and very little of much else. As the night goes on, the more "Jersey" the place gets. Which will appeal to some, but not others.
2013-05-29,4,Pretty cool place.  I went here on a Sunday afternoon for a few drinks.  The bar tender was very nice, but it was also empty there at the time too.  They had a ton of beers there which is right up my ally.  Then I had the T&A platter.  Mozz sticks, chicken fingers, winds, onion rings, spring rolls, potatoe skins.  Pretty much an instant heart attack.  Afterwards I had a taco burger.  AWESOME!  The next time I am in the area, I will return and try another one of their burgers.  I don't remember how many different kinds they had but it was quite a few.
2013-04-01,3,It's a corner bar in Hoboken right across from the PATH.  That means awesome people watching.  $5 tap beer and typical bar food.  Music was a bit too clubby and loud for 6:30pm but the place was PACKED! I couldn't believe how crowded the place was that early in the night! Good place for 20-something young-ins looking to mix and mingle with other Hoboken types.
2013-03-26,3,Enemies of the Steelers, Be warned ! This is not the place for you during football season !The rest of the year its a pretty good place get a little crowded in there , and late on a Saturday night you get a lot of the typical "I spend half my life at the Gym and in the bathroom with hair condition Jersey guys"But good good , young crowd, (not as young as the clubs, more like young professional ) and overall a decent place to check out.Really great to go to after work , their wings are great and when its not super crowded its very chill and fun. Always have had really friendly servers and staff.Mikes bottom lineGo here with some friends after work , enjoy some wings and food , some discount beers (join their regulars/beer club thing  if your in the area) but get your ass out of here before it get too late on a Saturday before it gets too packed (unless that's your thing)
2013-02-15,4,Great spot in hoboken with huge selection of beer and good bar food. The bartenders are really nice and attentive.
2013-02-06,2,NJ bro-culture, ground zero.The presumed king of sports bars - featuring what's gotta be the largest concentration of dudes wearing jerseys in one place. The light beer is cheap, your server's hot and polite and there's live sports in pretty much any direction you turn. There's maybe a boozy fistfight outside to avoid and you'd be unfazed if a Nickleback song came on next. Still, it's not a sketchy business or anything and people are nice enough here.  It's just so thoroughly ordinary you can't help but be bored.
2013-02-05,4,I normally go here on my days off (mon/tues) for lunch... The food is always on point, and the bartenders are always very nice and out going. The prices are really reasonable considering its location, and the liquor AND beer selection is much more diverse that what you would expect.  Join the beer club, its free, but it will take you some time... The first person to complete it in the shortest amount of time was a woman...
2013-01-27,3,Younger crowd , good looking young professional females.
2013-01-22,3,So, let me get something straight. Texas Arizona is:- A Penn State / Steelers bar- Named after two Southwestern red states- In North Jersey's favorite small city- Just across the Hudson from ManhattanTalk about a true-blue All-American. And talk about a total disregard for geographic consistency.OK, so maybe the name doesn't really matter. Most know TA as literally the first bar in Hoboken if you're coming in from the city, thanks to its primo location a street-cross stumble from the PATH. Generally speaking, that's pretty much the most useful (and accurate) geographic takeaway here.Naturally, it's a wildly popular happy hour spot and Sunday Funday stand-by. TVs literally line the inside perimeter of the whole joint. In the summer, there is open window counter seating so you can order directly from the main bar while outside chillin' on the sidewalk patio. They have a fridge full of specialty beers on display in the back bar, but in all reality, this is a Bud Light bottles-for-my-bros type of place. The bartenders are typically attentive, not to mention, typically attractive. They even allowed me to charge my dying iPhone behind the bar on a very busy NFL Sunday. Hey, hospitality counts, even in sports bars!Although you shouldn't expect it, once games have ended, thus providing a little extra room to move, I've seen dance parties break out here later in the night. But that's also just Hoboken - a late-night dance party kind of town. With its generous square footage, desirable location, and full sports coverage, Texas Arizona is functional first, fun second.Except when we're talkin' about the the men's bathroom, because that's just neither functional or fun. The middle urinal is, without fail, a conversation piece every time I queue up to take a piss. Yes, Texas Arizona is one of those spots where the guys' bathroom has the longer line than the ladies'. Anyway, there are three of these wall-hanging toilets in a space where there should really only be two. Therefore, the middle urinal is almost always avoided, and if someone should take it, he shall be judged by the other bladder-tested bros waiting in line. Is this essential Texas Arizona knowledge or obvious dude protocol? You'd be surprised. Just don't be Middle Urinal Guy.
2013-01-14,3,Located right beside the Hoboken PATH station, this sports bar has great energy and serves a mean whiskey ginger.Good people watching on a game day and plenty of Jersey sports pride..as long as that's your thing.
2012-12-19,4,Texas may be my top 3 sports bars in Hoboken. Great place, great food, great staff and Im even willing to look past the fact it's a Steelers bar. I've never had a bad meal there. They crowds always a nice mix of casual sports fans or people looking to have a good night out. Always great drink & shot specials throughout the night and Im not a member of their beer club but seems to be a good deal. In general, it's a great place to go for any game or on a weekend night to party. The bartenders are mostly attractive women who aren't bitches so guy and girl patrons both win.
2012-12-11,4,I had a great time here to cap off a fun weekend, especially since Texas Arizona is a self-proclaimed 'Steelers bar', filled with a ton of black and gold fans who all witnessed a thrilling last second win against the the bitter rival Ravens. Plus, this place is huge with two large bars, a ton of tables and plenty of elbow room to spare. Add in great beer selections, decent drink prices and a ton of TVs on top of the lively, enthusiastic crowd and I couldn't help but have a really fun evening in northern Jersey.
2012-11-12,4,Been here on a couple of occasions, usually to enjoy a sporting event.  They have a shit ton of tv's so their isn't a bad seat in the place.  The menu is the standard bar fare.  Food is fine, not fantastic but much better then many of the other bars located up the block on Washington.  This place can get really crowded, especially if penn state or the steelers are playing, so show up a little early to ensure you have a seat.  Service is attentive and cheerful albeit a little stressed out.  Overall a decent, tv filled, wings and beer type of place.
2012-11-01,3,3$ beers on tap and watching the dolphins n Jets game woohoo!
2012-10-03,3,Went 9/30/12 before Jets embarrassment loss to the Niners.  This is a place trying to be a Coyote Ugly.  Food was good, not great but good.  We had an Egg White Omelet, Arizona Grilled Chicken Sandwich and the Salmon Salad.  The Salmon was over cooked.  Sat outside on a beautiful day.Now for the negative.  Hay Nicole G (our server), get out of the business.  It's called hospitality for a reason.  From the time we sat she was sullen and curt.  Acted as if she was doing us a favor.  But then when it was, hold on wait for it, that's right tip time out came the charm.  Save it.  I'm in the business and for whatever reason you are having a bad day leave it outside, oh, that's right we were outside.  My apologies.I would highly suggest requesting someone other than the less than hospitable Nicole G.
2012-09-25,1,Slowest service ever. The waitstaff brought out my sandwich but no one else's in my group so I didn't start eating, about 5 minutes later they returned to the table and took my sandwich away because it was ANOTHER customers order. I wouldn't suggest anyone go to this restaurant ever. I have a head cold so if it wasn't for me telling the server, who knows what could have happened.
2012-09-13,1,I have been to Texas Arizona on several other occasions. I have never had what could be considered a great time or a time that was made better by being at Texas Arizona.  That being said, we decided to hit up TA for this past Sunday's NFL season kickoff.HUGE MISTAKE.The waitress assigned to our table was unbelievably slow.  We shook that off, thinking it is the first Sunday of football season and they would hopefully figure out the ropes by week 2 or 3.  They might, but there is no way I am going to stick around to find out.When I go to a bar with 20+ televisions who boasts that they have the NFL package, I expect to be able to see every single game on the television. Not so at Texas Arizona.  When we were there, the Jets game was on. They had it on more than half the televisions.  While I understand the local game being heavily featured, there is no excuse for other games to not be available - not even on a little tv in the corner of the bar.  There were at least 4 games being played that weren't available at TA. I could have stayed home to watch the Jets game whereas I needed to be somewhere with the Sunday ticket for those not available.  When the Vikings game went into OT, even that did not persuade them to turn the Jets off one of the 10+ televisions they were on. I asked the bartender to switch and he directed me to a manager.  The manager simply walked away from me after I asked him to switch the game on. He did ultimately do it but no pleasantries or even a word of acknowledgement were uttered.Beyond all of that a waitress with a short brown bob knocked my phone off the table where it shattered into 3 pieces. She picked the phone up in pieces, put it on the table, muttered "Sorry" and walked away. Absolutely no disregard for the fact that she destroyed my property.  I attempted to tell a few coworkers what happened and was brushed off.So in short, go to Texas Arizona if you don't want to watch football and don't mind having a $300 phone destroyed.
2012-08-23,4,Really like this bar. What's not to like? TVs galore!! Fun, cool crowd. Good drinks. Good food. Everybody's happy! I was able to watch the Giants and (not vs.) Jets pre season games while watching the Yanks all within range of each other. Yeah!!! They even had the mets game on. *crickets* lol. It's a steelers bar, so if you're a fan you should check it out. However, for the sane people that are from NY and actually like NY teams ;) then once steelers aren't playing they cater to your needs and you aren't bombarded by "black and yellow, black and yellow"! =p
2012-07-29,5,I'm trying to remain unbiased in my review of this establishment but it's difficult; what with my wanting to bang all the bartenders. Except for that one thats a dude. Who's got quite a gig and probably banging all the female customers. Anyway. More than enough space to either sit at the bar or plant yourself at a table. Tap selection is great; with a few microbrews thrown into the mix for added effect. The food is actually quite good and doesn't necessarily seem like the standard lineup up frozen foods that they microwave down in whats referred to as a kitchen but generally regarded as whatever they call a room equipped with just a microwave. I shared guacamole and chips with a friend and we both made pleasant conversation about how we'd probably both bang the bartender (once again, not the dude, who was probably off banging one of the customers). I'm not much into the late night dance crowd but after awhile, if thats your thing, the place gets a little more crowded and has more than an ample enough supply of gyrating, and bangable, women.
2012-07-16,3,3.5 starsStopped in on a Sunday after grabbing a bite to eat elsewhere. I needed to kill some time before my flight. They have a huge selection of beer. It was a good spot to grab a drink and relax.
2012-06-15,3,This place is pretty mediocre. It's close to the PATH/train station/ferry so if that's important to you, it might be worth it to stop in. The food is decent as far as bar food goes -- and their giant appetizer platter is great for a large group. However, they are ALWAYS packed to the gills and the service is hit or miss. The most disappointing thing about this place is the bar-tending. Many of the bartenders serve watered down drinks which are surprisingly pricey for the area/atmosphere.
2012-06-01,3,Came here after a dead night near my alma mater, so we went UP - UP from New Brunswick to Hoboken (anything closer to Brooklyn would do [HOME]). It was A-OK, as my rating will dictate to you. The beers were cheap and the crowd was manageable, mainly because there were so few people there at like 2am. *Kudos to them for being open the night AFTER Memorial Day* There was one incident that rather disturbed me while there though, it's no fault of theirs really, but it just kind of made me believe their patronage can be somewhat strange. It went a little something like this: A girl walked in with a Marine's hat (It was Fleet Week) and judging by her getup, she was NOT a Marine. A crowd not too far from the entrance, initially congratulated her and even slapped high fives and offered her a drink. No more than 2 minutes later, the same group blacklisted her and yelled at her for disrespecting the armed forces and screamed, kicked and yelled at her to leave the premises. Next thing you know there is a scuffle inside, then shorty thereafter, outside and then a whole 'nother conflict began over something I hadn't the energy to inquire about. It just made the beauty of Memorial Day, with its gorgeous weather and the lovely feeling I had after a great cookout, weird for me *shrugs*. I'm sure that it's probably a great spot any other time of the year when it's lacking in awkward moments AND incredibly close to the PATH. All in All: they have a great alcohol selection and nice bartenders and I'm looking forward to enjoying this place, perhaps, on another night.
2012-05-28,4,Came here for my birthday with some buddies on Cinco de Mayo, and it was a good time. Convenient for everyone being right across from the PATH, good atmosphere and a fun clientele. The prices were only okay and apparently they charge a cover after a certain time, but I can get past that since it's a good place from what I remember after multiple tequila shots in less than two minutes. I'll definitely be back here for a happy hour or late night when friends are back in town.Sidenote: Come for the good times, stay for the staring at the waitresses
2012-05-20,1,Great craft beer selection, but like the Iron Monkey, boring crowd. Right off the PATH. Good meeting place to venture elsewhere if you want to cruise.
2012-04-11,5,Been cruising by here a lot lately.  I think its the Pabst Blue Ribbon, it calls to me at night.  Anyway never really came by much before because never felt the need to come in.  Aside from some bad table service at Sunday brunch that I am going to let go at this point because the next week we had great service from a waitress there that made up for it.  The main reason I am writing this review is to give a shout out to one of my fav bartenders now.  Mika is the best.  Doesn't pull that I am better than you attitude with the customers that you get at so many places in Hoboken.  That makes all the world of difference with me.  I hate ordering drinks and feel like the bartender is inconvenienced.  So if want a Hottie Down To Earth Bartender go see Mika she da bomb.  Also worth of note Christian I think his name is, is a good bartender as well always on top stuff.  The bouncers are pretty cool as well.  Not a bunch of meat looking to toss out anyone who looks at them wrong.
2012-04-06,4,There's a phrase in Latin, "res ipsa loquitor", which means "the thing speaks for itself".  Well, Texas Arizona is just a fun bar with fun people, decent food and an excellent beer selection.  They always show the big pay per view fights and sporting events, so it's a great place to go watch the games. Texas Arizona is just a good time.
2012-03-20,3,The bar overall was great. Good drinks, passable bar food, reasonable price with deals, and perfect amount of seating to TV ratio to watch almost any sporting event. My only gripe is the staff were young and hot, which is the problem. Not very friendly, obviously little customer service experience. When I asked for a "bar towel" to wipe down our dirty table after the last customers, the waitress looked at me like I was an alien. Instead of wiping down the visibly dirty table herself, she brought paper napkins and I cleaned my own table. I don't think I have ever seen that in a bar, customers cleaning... weird.
2012-03-20,3,YEEEEHAW! Great location for happy hour. The deals are perfect for my wallet and my liver. Since it is located right next to the Path the clientele is less college student and more working professional. Met several friends at this place for happy hour last week. Not terribly crowded and not too expensive. I had my share of drinks as did my girlfriend and the service was decent... not perfect. She was obviously busy though.FOR FOOD: I ordered the Texas Arizona burger, it was SUPER spicy/tasty and I THOROUGHLY enjoyed it but I paid for it the next day (If you know what I mean). She order the buffalo wrap and we both agreed it was above average on the heat... yet still tasty (best with ranch!). All in all a good time for some post work drinks but next time I will be very cautious on the food we order there... they must dislike colons there!
2012-03-19,3,In one night I went to two sports bars, here and 1 Republik.This place is definitely less douchey, and has way more space.You get to stare at the waiters wearing fitted tops enhancing their chest area with Texas Arizona written everywhere. Well, I won't be forgetting the name of this place.Of the two rooms one is more situated for eating with tall bar stools and the other side can be more dancing/standing around.This place is literally across from the train station, so it made it convenient at the end of night getting back to NYC, but with that being said it will be crawling with non-hobokenites.I ended up dancing with a very dirty smelly fat Irish man here. He enjoyed himself and my friends thought I was crazy. The bouncers definitely enjoyed the show, probably a little out of mockery and the other half just complete stupidity/hysterical.This place has potential, But i'm not sure it's the potential I want....
2012-03-11,3,We went on a Sunday night, and the place was pretty busy. Our sole purpose... Shiner Bock on TAP. If you're not a Texan, you wouldn't understand. The waitress told us they were out of Shiner, and we pouted a little bit but ordered food anyway. The burgers are pretty big and tasty, but the avocado on my boyfriend's burger looked a little too ripe. I would probably only return if there is Shiner!
2012-03-07,3,The beer list is very good, but the staff have absolutely zero clue when it comes to beer. This place is totally a generic Irish bar that decided to sell upscale beer. When I ordered a Trappist Rochefort 10 the bartender didn't even give me a glass. When I asked for a glass she gave me a pint glass! I realize old slobs like to gawk at bartenders in a push up bra, but if you're going to serve good beer at least make sure they are trained in the basics.
2012-02-06,3,Great place for an after work meet up with friends.  Food was good and the service was nice.  I misread the menu and ordered something with bacon.  When it arrived, I told the waitress I misread the menu.  She was very friendly and they made me a new burger - even though it was my mistake.Great laid-back atmosphere that's fun and lively.  Very close to the Hoboken train station.
2012-01-24,5,This place is really good for anything really.  After work drinks, quick dinner or beer, and going out on weekends.  They have a substantial list of great beer.  The food tastes great also.  On weekends it does get very busy earlier in the night, but they have enough people to accommodate.  It is clean and does not smell like stale beer.
2012-01-21,3,It's an OK Hoboken bar.... i especially like it because it's a minute from the PATH train so I can get back to the city quickly.   There's 2 bars on either side so if the bigger bar where you enter is too crowded, you can head over to the bar on the other side to get served.   Great selection of beers, but once "happy hour" ends the beers get a little too pricey.   Been here a few times on Fri nites which is always crowded  but very friendly bartenders, and sometimes they'll even throw you a free beer on the house too which you gotta love.
2012-01-09,2,This place sucks. First of all its a Steelers bar, thats reason enough. Second the service sucks.  Third the beers are expensive and drinks watered down.
2012-01-01,3,It's just a generic sports bar.  Nothing special, but the drink prices are reasonable and there is never a line because the place is huge.
2011-12-14,3,Texas Arizona is a bit of a hybrid bar. It's got elements of a number of Hoboken establishments, and does pretty much all of them decently, but in the end it averages out to a 3 star place.As a typical "bar", it does ok. There's actually two separate bars, so even though the place can get crowded in the evenings, it's not impossible to get served. Bonus points for having a pretty wide bottled beer selection at the right hand bar.***Edit*** I truly underappreciated their beer selection. Stopped by again this afternoon and their bottled beer selection is more appropriately described as  "huge"; didn't count how many they had in all, but there's easily over 100 different beers    As a food establishment, well it's more akin to Mikie's Squared than to Black Bear. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to have dinner here, but it's a good option if you'd rather not have a slice of pizza yet again.As a nightlife spot, the bar does feature music on weekend evenings, and while you'll occasionally have people dancing, it's not really a club or lounge scene. Still, it gets points for at least trying, and for not relying on a jukebox. Overall, it's hard to find many faults with the place. One of the best locations of a Hoboken bar (right across the street from the PATH station). A bunch of TVs so you can catch a sports game no matter where you're sitting.  Moderately priced beers and drinks. Texas Arizona is a pretty good spot for an after hour drink or two, and while it's far from being a favorite of mine in Hoboken, for most nights it'll do the trick
2011-11-16,4,Texas Arizona is the perfect spot to meet for a Happy hour drink when coming home from the city. Half off drinks at the main bar till 8pm! Decent bar food and a great selection of beer.  No frills and mostly filled with sports-loving guys; TV's in abundance for any Sunday Funday!
2011-09-06,3,This place is alright.  Large selection of bar fare, good for groups and close to the train stations.  Huge beer menu, though not very well organized.I would definitely meet up with a group of friends here but would not go out of my way to grab a bite to eat here.  I guess it is a good thing that is is next to the PATH and is on most people's way into or out of Hoboken.
2011-09-03,3,My buddies and I decided to hit this place up on one our our Sunday Drinking Days. We had never been here before, never heard of it, and figured that we could not lose. It was not an epic win, but it was not a loss either. Texas Arizona is a pretty cool place to go and get some drinks with some friends, but it was nothing bumping either.Texas Arizona is a cool place if you are out with a bunch of friends and looking for a bar to go to that has large variety of beer. With two bars in the joint, you can easily get a drink at either. The front bar can do beer and liquor but the beer selection is much larger if you order from the back bar. The bartender in the back is very knowledgeable and can recommend any of the beers based on your taste. The front bar also has a porting where you could sit outside at the bar, but the availability for that is limited.They serve some food also but not as much as they used to from what the bartender said. One of my buddies ordered an appetizer which he said was good, but I can not vouch for anything since I did not order any of it. I was too busy enjoying the variety of beer available.Overall I gave this place three stars because of their great beer selection and the helpful staff. Besides that, it did not have much else that you could do at the place besides watch TV. I would come here with friends again to drink and socialize, and possibly by myself if it gets real bumping on certain nights.
2011-04-29,3,I didn't eat here so this is simply a bar review. When it comes to a good bar to watch a game this is it. Bartenders were very friendly and drinks seemed to be standard price for the area. My beers were cold, and the only bad thing i had was the bathrooms could have used a little better cleaning, but far from horrible. If your looking for a good drink and a good TV this is a good choice.
2011-04-28,4,Hoboken's only Steelers bar.  Also good for watching any game, the bar is really big and the food aint bad either.  One of the better bar pies I've had.
2011-04-23,3,Was here last night, with co workers, and I had a great time here. The drinks were reasonably priced, the staff was friendly, and this place is large enough for a big crowd. The bathrooms are ok but very small but hey at least they have a bathroom lol. Very close to the PATH train station. Its literally across the street. So you can stumble from the bar and crawl onto the train. See very convenient :-). Good establishment. Will come back and try the food.
2011-04-16,4,Obviously awesome on Sundays for Steelers games (if you're a Steelers fan, that is). Threw my bf a birthday party here - Greg was incredibly helpful and accommodating (he made specific beer available for us, didn't mind us brining in balloons and a cake, etc). There was a miscommunication on the time that we arrived (it was a surprise party) and they ran out of the specific beer upstairs (and took a good 20 min. to bring up from the basement) but overall a great time.  Absolutely would go back and throw another party there.
2011-04-13,3,Went for lunch with boss and colleagues. Actually not bad. We were the first lunch customers, so that was a lil slow. It's nice to see video of the menu dishes on wide screen before ordering.Fajitas portions are enormous. Friendly staff.
2011-03-22,4,Mozzarella sticks are banging! and the drinks are fairly priced. Id come back. Convenient for a pre-city -party drink! right across from the PATH. Lots of TVs for game watching. Thumbs up.
2011-03-07,3,this I think is my fave bar in Hoboken.  A super chill place with food that is a lot better than typical bar fare.  I highly recommend the buffalo chicken salad.  Most places just take a house salad and slap some chicken on top.  This place actually has a recipe that when you eat it you actually think about how well it blends.Besides that we do have an issue....the plating.  Who the hell wants to eat a salad on a plate that reminds you of an olive serving dish?  You know...the ones that are like an inch wide and are a foot long.  I really thinking its the first time in my life I've eaten a salad on a rectangle.  Its all I could think about.  I had zero control over the tomatoes and the avocados.  They had a mind of their own and were running around trying to escape their play pen.When I go back I ask for a bowl.
2011-02-15,3,I have been here a few times and since it is literally right across the street from the PATH, the convenience alone is a huge plus. Nice size bar area with plenty of large TVs on different channels to watch as many sports games that happen to be available at the time. The recently renovated the bathrooms, Thank God, but the overall atmosphere is a positive. Never been overly crowded and the bartenders are very friendly and always around when a refill is required. Only negatives were the food and strength of drinks. The Nachos leave something to be desired but the prices are very reasonable.
2010-12-23,3,Great bar to sit down and watch a game while drinking a few beers and eating some bar grub, terrible bar to go "out" at.  During most games the place has a good amount of traffic, but not so much that you can't get a seat or see/hear the television.  During weekend nights...yeah...too close to the NJTR
2010-12-22,3,A good happy hour spot for those who are waiting to take a train in the city or even those who have come from the city. Decent priced drinks but bar food is standard. A few TV's showing local sports teams. Great people watching especially during the warmer weather months. The wait staff is a bit disorganized and spotty. Place is not known for it's food, more for it's prox to PATH and happy hour/late night weekend crowd.
2010-12-01,3,I've been a few times, almost always for Penn State games.  Standard sports bar with standard bar food, pitchers, and a standard beer selection (lites, Sam, Yuengling, some seasonal, maybe one interesting beer).  Close to the PATH.  Glad to see they recently renovated the bathrooms.
2010-07-06,4,Can't recall much about the night I went to Texas Arizona because I got pretty wasted and blacked out. This was one of the many places we went to in Hoboken. I gave it 4 stars because I got wasted thanks to this place. 4 stars well deserved I would say.
2010-07-05,1,this place is a mess, only thing that saves it ..its location......otherwise the food is freakin terrible...my buddy ordered quesadillas and they tasted and looked as if we made them ourselves after a night of heavy drinking.....the beers are warm, the bartenders are rude if they dont know you ........overall just a shitty experience.....if they fixed up the food and beer the place would be a gold mine
2010-07-03,1,Worst service ever!......a few of my  co workers and I went there on our lunch break  we got a table outside and placed our  orders right away. Our drinks took 15mins to come out and was watered down by the melted ice (this should've been our first clue to whats ahead) 30 mins later we still didnt have our appetizers or anything else and our waitress never even came back to let us know if anything was wrong!!! needless to say after waiting about an hour we left and never got an explanation or anything..........
2010-06-10,3,Looking for something quick to eat..decided to check this place out..I ordered the chicken caesar salad..YUMMM..seriouslyyy a caesar salad is sooo blahhh but something about this one...definitely had a kick to it..it was kinda spicy and they had walnuts in them..see picture that i posted...Ever since I had this caesar salad all I've been wanting to eat is caesar salads..had them at other places but nowhere good at this place...husband ordered a chicken sandwich with mozarella and roasted red bell peppers..that wasn't that bad either I ended up eating the other half..haha..buttt it could've used a little extra sauce to it..Service really SUCKED..not once did we get a refill, not once did we get asked if everything was okay...the server was out doing her own thing..who knows..whatever gave her a shitty tip..which she deserved..But props for my yummy caesar salad..never had a caesar salad like theirs before. Would never come back if I'm ever in jersey again.
2010-05-17,3,This is def a cool hang out bar.  Its a great place to watch games and chat with friends over beer.  So few places hoboken now have just a low key time.  Beer is always cool and cheap.  Food is OK at best.  Waitresses are always cute.  We had a great looking one last night named Britney.   If your in Hoboken and want a place to hang and chat this is the place.
2010-03-22,2,This bar is not bad, it just needs a new name. The vibe, food, drinks, and atmosphere had nothing to do with Texas or Arizona. They had Magic hat #9 and Yeungling, two breweries that do not distribute to either of the states. The decorations did not have a western feel, and the walls were made of brick which is hard to find out west. The menu did not have western style dishes. The bathrooms were in the basement.The lunch menu was basic, had very few options, but great prices. I got a turkey club sandwich that was very good and a perfect lunch portion.There are much better places to go to in the city, but this wasn't all that bad. Being from Arizona, I am just bitter about the poor name of this bar.
2010-02-28,1,Went here with some co-workers last week, and overall it wasn't bad.  Friday night, not too crowded. Service was ok, nothing too spectacular.  The food was decent.  It's close to the PATH train.  That's about it for good.  The bad follows.Thing worth noting: Make sure everything is on one tab.  when there's multiple, things go wrong.  One group closes their tab and pays to close that tab, the tab should be paid and closed out.  Here ... not so much.  They take the money, don't apply it to the tab that it's supposed to be applied to, stick the remaining people there with that tab of the group that left plus the first group's tab and play dumb as if they were never paid.  Effectively they got paid twice for one tab because someone in the group didn't want to deal with the arguing anymore.Had I not needed to deal with the events above, I would probably give this place a 3 or so.  And perhaps what occurred may be a one time, out of the blue incident.  I'll let you all be the judge of it.  With that said, this place gets the lone 1 star, and more likely than not, I won't be going back anytime soon.
2010-01-24,5,My favorite bar in Hoboken!Great vibe and atmosphere...great for a bite & drinks with a group of friends.  Good service, drinks are priced decently, and on nights where the DJ is there it gives it a little flavor.Awesome place to catch sports games too!
2009-12-22,2,I had a miller light during happy hour tonight. It was more soda and less beer.
2009-10-16,2,only thing good about this place is that is next to the path train i mean right across the street......the wings are good and plentyother than this place ..rocks
2009-09-21,3,I like the space- its pretty big, (bathrooms wreaked though) and cheap drinks. Decent. Food looked really good though I did not have anything. Tempting though, very tempting. I'm sure this place would be lots of fun during a football game. They have outside seating and seems like a fun place to come with a group of friends.
2009-08-24,2,Very close to the PATH, with usually open doors until 11p when they start to shoo people indoors to avoid being too noisy for the neighbors. You can sit there sipping a beer and looking out to see people coming up out from the PATH station, some disheveled, others like models, and a few just glad to come over and grab a beer with you. People smile when you hand them a cold beer after a long day of work and a hot PATH station ride.A bar with many TVs, and a seating area to the side for patrons who want to eat food.  Downstairs, the men's bathrooms are okay.. not great and not really that clean, but hey, it's a bar.Service was swift inside (most people were sitting outside when we arrived as a party of four), and we were promptly seated.Wings -- not great. Good amount of strong buffalo sauce to cover the dryness, and a healthy dose of bleu cheese after we asked for an extra side.Nachos -- very soggy underneath, use a fork. It was big, though, and nicely filled the plate. We ate probably 2/3 of it.Entrees....Three Sliced Steak Sandwiches... juicy  NY strip steak, caramelized onions, and sauteed peppers on a French baguette w/ cheddar cheese -- right off the menu. Onions and peppers were delicious. I will have to order triple of those the next time.  The cheese was just enough to accent. I would've liked some au jus to dip the bread in, though, it was a little hard. I think Nicole L was just hungry ;)One of us ordered a Grilled Chicken and Shrimp... tender grilled chicken and tequilla lime shrimp served with sauteed vegetables and Mexican rice pilaf... pretty tasteless, actually. Very healthy. Not very oily. The grilled chicken breast was beaten thin, was a bit dry, vegetables unsalted, and rice pilaf was long-grain rice with a few spices thrown on. Shrimp was good, though, apparently, she ate those all and took the rest home.Aside from that, atmosphere is very relaxed, and I only had one mosquito bite from sitting near an open door. No problems splitting the bill.This place is decent for beers, though. I popped in here for a tenant meeting once to grab a couple beers and talk with fellow tenants about the rent issues in Hoboken. It was quite a fun time, and they were good-natured about letting us use the entire side for discussions and more.
2009-08-24,3,Decent, but nothing special. Extremely convenient location to the PATH (can't get better than being right across the street from the entrance. Came here with a group of friends around 5 p.m. on a Sunday. The dining area inside was pretty empty, but most of the tables outside were filled. Table was very wobbly, but none of the tables surrounding ours was any better. The server was friendly and pretty efficient. Apps:Wings - not too bad, but a bit dry (overcooked) and I personally found the sauce to be a bit strong. Nachos - soggy, over-flowing given the small plate it comes out on. Everyone at the table had to cut portions out.Entrees:Three of us got the steak burger w/ roasted peppers on a french bread. I actually liked mine a lot, even though it came out well done and I asked for it at medium rare. There was SOOO much oil that the meat still tasted relatively juicy and flavorful. My dinner companions were not as thrilled w/ their sandwiches, so maybe I was just hungry. The Chicken and Shrimp entree came out looking pretty, but uninteresting. Our dinner companion was pretty happy with it, but it looked like a steamed chicken breast, some steamed shrimp and steamed veggies. The chicken breast didn't look like it had been grilled (not sure if it was suppose to be grilled, but they could have tried making it look interesting SOMEHOW). I didn't taste the dish myself, but I guess I wouldn't mind ordering it if I was on a strict health diet.The bathroom is downstairs. The stairs leading down are very narrow and the bathrooms themselves are not the cleanest. For the Ladies room, there are 2 stalls, one sink, and very little standing space in between. Door to the bathroom also needed a good cleaning.Relatively standard food, some pros and cons. Not rushing to go back to this place at all, but I may consider it as an option in the distant future.
2009-08-21,4,I used to LOVE this place! Loved the outdoor seating overlooking the Hudson. The food is great. The bar scene at night is OK. I am more a fan of eating here, rather than drinking here.
2009-03-16,3,If this bar is good for one thing, it's the people watching.  It's right across from the PATH, so you can look at all the people coming home from work.  Counter to that, you know they look at you and think, "What time did these freakin people get to the bar?  Don't they have anything better to do??"Drinks are cheap, bartenders are very personable, and there's lots of TVs tuned to whatever games are on.  Extra points for the satelite package(s) for out of market games.  When it's nice out and they open up the huge windows, the plasmas are mounted on swivels so they can be turned to the patio area, or you can sit on outdoor stools that turn the window into an extension of the bar.They serve decent bar, and although nothing ever really goes on here besides a typical happy hour crowd, if you come with some friends it's a good time any time.  My one big issue with Texas, which certainly transcends this bar, would be the suits and ties at the bar.  Listen guy, we all know you're really important and make upwards of $12/hour.  But you're also at the bar.  Loosen the tie, or better, yet, take it off!  Unless, of course, your wife tied it for you and you're afraid you won't be able to get it back on.  In that case, I get it.
2009-01-09,4,DISCLAIMER:  I have only ever been here for Steelers games, as this is the largest Steelers bar in the area.With that being said, it is a great place for displaced Pittsburghers like myself.  Beer is incredibily cheap (8 dollar pitchers, 11 dollar buckets) and they even have IC Light and Iron City!  It gets very, very crowded during the games, but that is to be expected.One time I had the Chicken Caesar salad prior to the game, it was pretty tasty.  Much better than the average pub grub that most places serve.  Very easy to get to from Manhattan as well.  About 15 minutes from the 33rd St PATH station if you hit the trains right.
2008-10-08,1,The beer is super cheap and I love the prime location (which deserves the one star) but the service is horrible. Our waitress threw our menus and walked away without any eye contact or introduction. Then, we had to wait 15 minutes for her to come back to get us some drinks. And the pizza we ordered came out after more than 30 minutes. It was not even crowded one bit!!!We tried to get our bill but she decided to be MIA so we left without even receiving our bill. The bartender didn't even care! Of course, we wanted to just leave without paying, but because we have morals unlike the waitress, we made an estimate and even gave her a tip, which she did not deserve.
2008-09-12,4,2$ Miller Lites.Sports bar.PATH commuters.Awesome nachos.Outside seating to watch the commuters come out of the PATH station.Everyone in Hoboken has had a beer here. So should you.
2008-07-18,3,I expected Texas Arizona to be much more crowded, even on a Tuesday night, due to its prime location as one of the closest bars to the PATH Station, the NJ Transit Station and the Ferry Port.  But it actually worked in our favor that the place was so quiet; had any more people been there, we might never have gotten our drinks or food.  The service was pretty slow, but the beers were cold and reasonably priced for a bar just this side of Manhattan.  There were two rooms, one a full on bar room, that had stools at the bar, high-tables in the middle of the room, and a few regular tables around the sides.  With the NBA Finals going on, the place drew a mix of sports fans and the after-work crowd.  The food that we ordered was decent...I especially liked the mini-burgers and the potato skins.  I hear this place is more lively on the weekends.  I'll probably skip Texas Arizona the next time I return to Hoboken, just because there are so many other fun bars in the area.
2008-03-03,3,Not a shabby place. I was here on a Monday night so it was a bit empty in the house. My group consisted of about 15 people.I was pretty hungry so I enjoyed and finished my meal. I ordered the grilled shrimp and chicken. I arrived late but the food was served promptly. The meal itself was okay but i was hungry so it probably tasted extra delicious.Waitstaff was fine. Being the biggest group in the house I guess they pretty much catered to whatever we wanted.  If I go back, it'll def be for a "bar" thing, not necessarily to have dinner.
2007-08-17,3,For that disgusting, oh my god where am I? What is that smell?  Oh I'm in jersey, move.I went here after pounding through 3 forties with my boys and was prepared to have fun no matter what.  The place is set up like most places, bar on the main floor with an elevated area straight ahead and extending to your left.  The crowd wasn't the most friendly, the girls weren't the best looking, and the music wasn't too great either.A live band is cool, but it has to be able to hold it's own weight, and this one did not do that.  The beers were extremely reasonable however as I paid $3 for miller lite bottles and proceeded to get so hammered I didn't care how awful the crowd and music was.  This place is not worth any trip from Manhattan and if you are traveling from Brooklyn as I did my poor friends this place can actually be deadly...(Upon my return trip to Brooklyn at 2am I passed out on the path, awoke in Pavonia at 4am and got home to Brooklyn at 6am, I have had international flights that were easier than this).My advice if you are anywhere other than New Jersey stay put.  If you have a death wish then head out here, pray that your good looks and $30 hair gel will be enough to land you a cheap jersey whore to stay with for the night...because after that path train leaves it's survival my friend and if you are stuck without a place to stay...you die.
2007-08-07,4,nice place the food is good. fun crowd lots of tv's
2007-07-09,4,Texas Arizona is located near the PATH and in the midst of all the other casual bar/pub places downtown.  I went there on a Tuesday or Wednesday night in June, and it was pretty dead.  The majority of the people there were either eating outside or crowding around the long, fully-stocked bar.  My friend and I wound up eating at a table inside, which was nice.  I was amazed by how upscale the menu offerings were.  I ordered a salad with grilled shrimp.  The shrimp were grilled perfectly.  I would definitely recommend this place for a casual night out with friends.
2007-02-14,3,Ok so this isn't the greatest bar/eatery in Hoboken, but it was fun from what I remembered.  I don't remember what I was drinking, but I do remember they had a live band which I thought was cool.  I believe that Fridays they have the live bands, I know they also serve food, but didn't try when I went.  Hey when you have tried everything else on Washington St., head over to Texas Arizona, its right near the Path Station so thats a plus.
2006-08-24,3,Hotties working the bar and waiting tables and mediocre food plus no buybacks equals 3 stars from me.  It is close to the PATH so it is very convenient.  Beyond that, nothing special.  Well, other than the view from the chairs overlooking the street on a sunny day.
2006-03-13,1,Had a bad experience here. Sorry to say but when I brought a friend over who wasn't preppy looking and wasn't "white" they treated us like dirt, this was the servers and even the barkeep. It's been 5 years and I don't think I'll be coming back to this place anytime soon.
2005-12-22,4,With fancy martinis including things like gummi bears and Godiva chocolate liquor, you can't help but be swooned by this place that proves to be a local hangout to all the Hoboken yuppies.  The music is loud, the drinks are fancy and they have fondue.  Need I say more?  Maybe so, but it's a enough for me to go there.
