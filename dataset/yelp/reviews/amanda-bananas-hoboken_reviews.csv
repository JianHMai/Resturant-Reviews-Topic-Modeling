2021-09-17,1,You only want to see and serve vaccinated people??? Seriously... Sorry... No way will I buy anything from you... Good luck with that...
2021-07-20,5,Love love love Amanda's bananas!  My summers wouldn't be complete without it! The ice cream consistency is perfection, even though it's 100% bananas. My favorite is the banana cream pie which comes with a generous amount of whipped cream, Nutella, and crushed graham crackers. Couldn't recommend this more (obviously must like bananas).
2021-06-24,4,I wanted to love this but I didn't. I don't feel it deserves less stars either because I found out I reallllly don't like banana based ice cream lol. I think it's a perfect option for non dairy ice cream just was NOT my fav. I made my own creation of #1 with Oreo crumbs, hot fudge, and walnuts. Loved that it included 3 toppings because charging extra. I thought maybe what I ordered would be a re creation of my fav chunky monkey from Ben and Jerry's but nope. Looked so yummy but I ended up just eating the topping off of it only. I was told there was another base of mango and pineapple too so maybe I'll give that a try or try a "banana shake" instead next time. Maybe that will mask the banana flavor a little better?!
2021-05-31,5,YUM! I had the fluffernutter and wow was it good! What a brilliant idea. Thanks guys!
2020-07-08,5,*Pre COVID Review* I visited Pier13 one afternoon and found the Amanda Bananas food truck. I was so excited to try something that was 100% dairy free, gluten free and vegan since dairy upsets my stomach. I was slightly afraid the consistency or taste would be off but I was proven wrong! I ended up trying the Banana Cream Pie ice cream. Omg, it was so delicious and the consistency was perfect. I loved the simple toppings and presentation. Roughly one scoop of icecream was $5. I would say this is fair for the product. Can't wait to try out all their other creations! I know their food truck is open for business at Pier13 in Hoboken. Be sure to check them out for a tasty treat!
2020-06-19,4,I love that this food truck is on the pier! My boyfriend and I ordered one each. I tried the mango pineapple and he ordered the banana cream pie. The mango pineapple is dairy free which I liked. It tasted good, you can really taste the mango! I didn't taste pineapple though. But I liked it.The banana cream pie has whipped cream, Nutella, banana ice cream, and crushed graham cracker topping. So delicious!! This one was our favorite of the two.It is a little expensive, $11.50 for the two. I'm happy they aren't cash only. Quick and friendly service!
2019-08-11,5,Wonderful! Had Rocky Road and it was soooo good.  The toppings were tasty and the banana custard was quite tasty. Simply good, simply wonderful.
2019-08-05,5,Had the banana dessert a couple of times at different food truck events in hudson county.Very tasty and they have a wide variety of toppings.Healthy too.. which makes for a guilt free indulgence.
2019-07-11,5,The Amanda Bananas truck stopped by my apartment building and WOW, it is good! Crazy to think that the 'ice cream' is 100% bananas... it's deliciously smooth, sweet, and even creamy! Their toppings are great, too. I got the Snickers (chocolate syrup, and caramel peanuts) and my boyfriend got the Banana Cream Pie (whipped cream and Nutella). Both were great! Can't wait to find this food truck again in the future to try some of the other combinations.
2019-06-17,1,Ive been a frequent customer at this establishment, never had a problem. But the recent disrespect that I've experienced from the hands of this middle-aged lady with a nasty attitude convinced me to no longer come to this location in the future
2019-06-06,5,Best in town ! Gotta love this place ! Steve and his staff go above and beyond. Not to mention the phenomenal product !
2018-07-30,5,Absolutely the most delicious non-dairy ice cream dessert I've ever had!  I had the banana snicker sundae and it tastes every bit as described by its name! It was smooth, creamy, and ! Oh and how can I forget... the owners are sweet as pie! #mynewcreamery #gobananas!
2018-07-22,5,Absolutely in love with Amanda Bananas. Don't think I can pass up getting some when at Pier13 ever again......Had a very hard time choosing, but ended up going with the fluff-a-nutter. SOOO good!!!!The actual banana base itself was so good that on a day i want to be healthier, I wouldn't mind more simple ingredients like chocolate chips and whipped cream. Gotta try it!
2018-06-27,5,This food truck is located at Pier 13 in Hoboken so you get a tasty treat with a view. It's simply just frozen banana with the toppings of your choice or you can go with one of their creations. I went with the Banana Cream Pie which is topped with graham cracker crust, Nutella and whip cream. Sooo good! I believe they are all $5.00.
2018-05-04,5,Amanda Bananas is healthy and delicious. I hired them to serve at a big corporate employee event at a healthcare company (where we are health conscious) and everyone loved it.
2017-08-15,4,This is a mainstay at the pier and is a crowd favorite.My wife loves this place and although i am not the biggest fan of bananas i love what they did with this.The flavor isnt too banana-ey and tastes like ice cream. The selection of toppings are great with so much to choose from.This place is a great place to visit if you want ice cream but dont want the calories associated with regular ice cream.
2017-08-04,4,It's a great concept and very unique as well! It does taste like a frozen banana; the treat has a nice smooth texture. They'll give you a sample if you wish to try it before purchasing.Very delicious alternative to ice cream and frozen yogurt. It's also dairy free. The only sugars present are the natural sugars if you get an original. I believe it's healthy minus the toppings. Depending on the toppings, it might not be as healthy but it's still a good and fun treat:) it does melt quickly if it's warm outside so indulge quickly! $4 for an original ($5 for one of the creations with toppings) which is a bit on the pricey side but you are getting a healthier treat. Enjoy your frozen banana treat on a nice warm day! And yes, they accept credit cards!
2017-06-21,5,Really delicious and healthy and cheap!! only 5 dollars with unlimited toppings. got mine with fresh mango and shredded coconut!! would totally get this again!
2016-10-16,5,If Amanda bananas had a storefront hear me, I promise I'd go every day. (Hint, hint)... The "ice cream" base is not ice cream in the least. It's made entirely from banana! No added ingredients, just banana!! From there you can add an assortment of toppings - from fresh fruit to peanut butter or whipped cream. For someone who used to eat ice cream every day, but stopped for health reasons, this is a dream come true!! It's creamy, refreshing and DELICIOUS !One complaint - they are only open certain days / times because this is a food truck. They close for the winter I believe, but are at pier 13 in hall summer and go to events all over NJ in the spring, summer and fall.
2016-09-15,5,I've been following Amanda Bananas on Twitter for a while now and on Labor Day, I decided to drive to Hoboken for some food trucks. I looked on the menu to see what they offered and soon as I seen Banana Cream Pie. Ooo yeaaa give that to meee!!!
2016-06-21,5,We had tasted Amanda Bananas at a food truck show, and as we were looking for a dessert alternative for gluten free guests at our wedding, we contracted with them.  Very professional in that process, and the dessert tent was a big big hit at our party!!!   It was a 90 degree day, and the line never slowed down...the toppings were a huge hit especially with our young guests, but I think the adults liked it just as much.  Deliciousness!!!
2016-06-15,5,Ordered the Peach Cobbler (used pineapple instead of peach)Great guilt free treat hit the spot
2016-05-25,4,Banana cream pie was delicious . Right on frank Sinatra drive, it was perfect  They have Nutella to top it all off , I see why this won an award.
2015-09-07,5,Amazing. I loved it, my husband loved it = we are sold. Def. would come back again for this. I am now inspired to learn how to make this because it was so tasty!!
2015-07-19,4,I've had this bookmarked for some time now, and I finally got to try it out. I'm all about bananas. I love them alone, in a banana split, as a milkshake, and for sure as a froyo/ice cream! So I had the chance to get to try it at JCEats (7/18), and I was satisfied! At first there was a weird after taste but it goes away after the third spoonful,lol. I had the classic with strawberries, Nutella, and cap'n crunch. It was only $5 which is not bad considering how expensive some froyo spots are. Definitely coming back to try other combos! AND THEY TAKE CREDIT/DEBIT CARDS! Yay!
2015-07-12,5,I crave Amanda's bananas!!! I live downtown in Hoboken, and make the walk almost every weekend to get Amanda's bananas. They are a guilt free treat that you can't beat!!
2015-07-10,4,The concept is weird: making something that resembles ice cream or frozen yogurt but made out of banana. Loved it though, not too sweet just a good combination. The wife and I got the smores one it was awesome. Definitely coming back here one day. Located in Pier 13 is very accessible and great place to be.
2015-01-25,5,I first heard about Amanda's Bananas from a coworker -- so when I saw the truck in my neighborhood, I KNEW I had to try it out! I was not disappointed. I have tried to make frozen banana desserts before, but the texture of the treat at Amanda's Bananas is incomparable. I still can't believe the only ingredient is bananas! I am looking forward to more trips here once the weather gets nice again.
2014-10-03,4,Delicious and ever so healthy (if you eat it plain and don't go crazy on the toppings, of course)! At home, I eat frozen over-ripe bananas all the time.  This is an even better treat. It's very filling because when you think about it, it's gotta be at least a couple or a few bananas mashed up to make a bowl full. I've gotten it plain, the s'mores toppings, and with nutella. All have been great!The service is a little slow, especially when there's a line.  I've wound up waiting 10 minutes before and there were no customers even in front of me. But, it was a nice day and worth the wait. I love this stuff, I wish it were available as an option at your frozen yogurt places! That would be perfect!
2014-08-12,4,mmmmmmm this place has a great concept. Unique and delicious. I got the banana cream pie and it was really good. I love the fact that i'm eating a dessert and its healthy. The fact that you can order it and sit at the pier and just enjoy the scenery. Its pure bliss. To me, I would get this very often for the pure fact that I love sweets and this would not kill me on the scale and it tastes like it would.The only downfall is that it is $5 for a small cup but it is worth it!I wanna try the almond joy next
2014-08-07,5,This is the only way to eat a banana! Sooooo yummy and guilt free. With all the different combinations of topping you can put on top it never gets old. I LOVE Amanda Bananas!
2014-08-07,5,Greatest!!!! So soooo yum and what a healthy treat for my 10 month old son too!!!! I am gluten and dairy free so this was super exciting :) I hope we see your truck again made my day and night as I dreamt about it lol.
2014-07-21,4,I really do enjoy Amanda Bananas and I LOVE that it serves as a healthy option on PIer 13.  The calorie count is stellar and it is quite refreshing.  I really like the consistency... and the price is good too!To be honest, the first 2 times I ate here, I ordered it plain.  And it tasted like cold, mashed up baby food bananas.  I was NOT a fan.  But then I tried my husband's delicious order involving Nutella and Coconut and it was absolutely delicious.  I finally realized, Plain is NOT the way to go here unless you love the raw banana flavor!  Even by adding something healthy like fresh mangos and coconut - the flavor profile and texture profile skyrockets and it tastes absolutely delicious.
2014-06-14,4,Bald One and I split a frozen banana treat at the Hamilton Park Festival in JC today. Too bad Baby D is only 3.5 months old, or we would have treated her to a taste as well. It looks like frozen yogurt but is 100% banana!  Healthy and delicious and so creamy you'd swear there's dairy in it. Because Bald One loves sweets, he chose graham cracker dust, Oreo bits, and Nutella as toppings. A bit sweet, but even I had to admit it was delicious.I'd give 5 stars if they had had fruit toppings available - like strawberries, blueberries, etc. for those of us who prefer tart over sweet. But it was a cold tasty treat and the size was perfect for sharing on a warm, sunny day in beautiful Downtown Jersey City!
2014-01-05,3,Excellent idea...poor execution. My frozen banana thingie tasted like they used bananas which were not fully ripened. I just didn't find it tasty.  Maybe I just had a bad experience. I think if they used super-ripe or even over-ripe bananas, this treat would taste amazing. Other than that, it looks very pretty and seems healthy.
2013-08-24,4,The amandabananas.com website provides all the essential info plus a phone number you can text to see where the truck is located. I received a confirmation back about 15 minutes after my inquiry text. The truck was located at pier 13. Ideal location. Lots of kids and adults alike lined up for a taste of healthy yumminess. I got mine with fresh strawberries, mango and chopped almonds. The cup was completely overfilled and spilled everywhere as I anxiously dipped my soon in it but I didn't care. It was much creamier than I had anticipated. The toppings complimented the base well, I indulged myself guilty free.
2013-08-11,5,Please come to San Francisco!  Amanda's brother is the owner and he was super nice and explained all the toppings and The process.....I ended up with lots of berries and almonds and really loved the frozen bananas that is like ice cream but it's all banana!It's super healthy but it doesn't seem like it!  How good is that???!!And btw, the truck is located on a pier that has a gorgeous view of NYC !
2013-07-14,4,The first time I tried this strange dessert I wasn't sold. The second time...I was.It's actually not strange at all. It's a banana. Which is why you need to dress it up a bit with some good sugary stuff. I recommend the Almond Joy topping! Ask for dark chocolate sauce.
2013-07-14,5,I don't even know if words can describe how good this stuff is.  fresh frozen banana treats!!!!!!   There's nothing better at beating the summer's heat than this stuff...topped with whatever your little heart desires.  The people that run this place is also super friendly.  Find them on Twitter and follow them.  They also go to a couple of the local farmer's market.
2013-06-24,5,My guilty pleasure minus the guilt -  I have at least one a day. My morning choice toppings are strawberries and granola but my favorite is a mixture of nutella, peanut butter and marshmallows. Tastes so good you'll never wanna go back to ice cream!
2013-06-18,5,Amanda Bananas is my go to place when I want something sweet (and thankfully it is healthy). There are so many topping options but my favorite is the Piña Colada. I'm so glad they are back at Pier 13 for the summer...I can't help but get one when I'm there.
2013-06-18,4,A Guilt-Free Frozen Treat? Yes Please!!The bananas are super fresh- you can watch them puree the frozen bananas right in front of you.  Can you choose from one of their pre-set combinations of toppings, or make your own.  Only thing that could make this slightly better- a toppings bar where you can add your own toppings.  Then again, perhaps for the sake of my waistline, it's better that they do it :)A nice summer addition to town for the summer!
