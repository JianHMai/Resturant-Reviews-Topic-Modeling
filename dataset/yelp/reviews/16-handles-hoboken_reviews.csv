2021-09-15,1,This location didn't have that many sorbet options. The floor in this place was absolutely gross. Whenever I take another step, my shoes will stick on the floor..the place in general was visually not very clean.
2021-08-15,5,Love this spot!! They have really great fro yo and smoothies and are right by the water with a great view of the skyline. The perfect treat!
2021-08-05,5,This is the best fro yo spot ever! I came during the day with my 3 friends and sat by the water to appreciate the NYC skyline. The  combination of the smoothie and view was so nice that I came back again at night to get more fro yo and sit outside. It's also clean and super COVID conscious. All the toppings were stocked too!
2021-08-05,5,Such a lovely spot! The store is super tidy and well kept, and the view overlooking NYC is gorgeous. All toppings & yogurt flavors were well-stocked when I visited, as was the excellent customer service. Will definitely visit again!
2021-06-19,5,Love this location!! The view is amazing and the store is kept up so nicely. All of the toppings and froyo areas are super clean. Couldn't have asked for a yummier time
2021-04-13,5,Best place to get dessert around the area. So many choices of yogurts and toppings. And the best part is you can take it out and enjoy the spectacular skyline of NYC. 10/10!
2020-10-14,3,I ordered through uber eats and it took over an hour to get here. Unsurprisingly, it was not as frozen as I would have liked.  The portion sizes were absolutely massive, as well as the toppings. I would go back in person, but not sure I would order again.
2020-09-19,1,Last Sunday was the worst frozen yogurt ever. They're supposed to do something to the machines called priming before the yogurt/ice cream liquid freezes. It puts air in it so that it's light and creamy. If it's not done, it comes out dark, icy and heavy weight wise. Plus it can make you SICK. Well all the flavors were this way. I didn't want to disappoint my 4 year old so we got it anyway. Such a small amount came out to over $9 bc it also weighed so much!  Sure enough, it gave him diarrhea.
2020-06-15,1,When 16 Handles first came to Hoboken, I was jazzed.  I went weekly, often more than once.   It's never been what you would call economical, but I always told myself it was an aid in portion control.  Over the years, I noticed the price going from not cheap to rather overpriced, but I still stopped in for the occasional indulgence.  However, after my most recent visit - I'm sworn off for good.  It was just after 9 pm so I called first to see if they were open, due to adjusted 'COVID' hours.  The man who answered the phone said they were officially closed but if we could get there in less than 10 minutes he would stay open, which was kind and it impressed me.  I live less than 2 blocks away so we ran out the door in the flash.  We arrived and half the machines / flavors were already off and half the toppings gone, but hey...beggars can't be choosers, right?  So we got a little something to satisfy the sweet tooth, but upon check out the register rang us up at nearly $20 for our 2 mediocre cups.  I asked him to double-check....that couldn't be right?  He said it was and was rather stone-faced / not very friendly.  We should have walked out but I felt a bit obligated since he had stayed open and frankly, I just wasn't processing the ripoff quickly enough.  Anyway, we paid and left and the regret follows me.  It was also quite melty, not even up to the usual par of tastiness.  Pics attached, you decide.
2019-08-30,4,Sure - why not Clean and have great options... exactly what youd expect from a 16 handles... Bonus the staff smiles!  haha unlike the few I have been to in NYC ;)
2019-07-12,2,Subpar all around. Poor topping selection (who doesn't have cookie dough?!?) and limited flavor selection (note to PB lovers there was NO peanut butter flavor.) The worst part, sadly, was the froyo itself. Such a bizarre consistency and texture. It was so watered down it came out looking like a frozen ice. Very disappointed compared to other 16 handle location experiences.
2019-07-10,2,Place used to be great but now would call it 7 handles as they are out of flavors all the time.  Nutrition signs are frequently out of order which makes it difficult to pick healthier options.. I'm not sure what happened since it opened a few years back but not worth the trip anymore.. Hopefully they read some of the recent reviews and so a major overhaul.
2019-07-05,2,Froyo tastes good, but the the hourly employees have no accountability. Dirty handles and topping bar. Kiwi all over the floor. I pointed out how I stepped in it and almost fell and they didn't even clean it. No sanitizer and napkins all out by the handle station. Out of what I would assume would be their most popular topping - cookie dough. Stock up on that, you know customers really like that topping. Didn't ask me if it was for here or to go and just stuck a spoon in my froyo and I had to ask to have it to-go afterwards. Just a dirty place all around.
2019-07-02,2,I have to echo what a lot of the other recent reviews have said: very dirty and it used to not be like this. The people that worked there didn't seem to care and when I went up to pay, one had her back to me talking to the other for awhile. And then said nothing to me. We were there for about 20 minutes and 4 people had to go up to the front to tell them how disgusting the bathroom was and they couldn't go in. Trash cans filled with trash. Won't be back unfortunately.
2019-06-28,1,If I could give this location zero stars I would. It's disgusting how run down and unkept this location is. My fianceÃÅ and I decided to pay a visit yesterday, after not going in three years. It is unbelievable how bad this location looks. The screens that show the flavors were cracked, had sticky notes, upside down, a printed label or blank screens. Some of the machines had frozen yogurt piling up on the metal bottom. The floors were cracked and sticky. The topping were all over the counter/floor and needed to be refilled. The place had a musty smell and was hot as well. Overall this place should be shut down with the conditions it's in. Such a shame how this place went down hell. Please don't bring your kids here. It's very unsanitary.
2019-06-28,1,This place went to complete shit. Seems to be under new management. Dirty, many handles out of order, counters and handles not cleaned for hours. Long lines and only one person working. If it looks that unsanitary from what I can see, I can't imagine what I can't see.
2019-06-14,2,I haven't been to this location in the longest time until the other day and it was a super let down! The condition of the store is falling apart!! First there were maybe 8 flavors because the rest were out of service or broken (screens cracked or displays upside down) plus they only had medium sized cups. I went to go change my son in the girls bathroom and it was SO foul and dirty as if it hadn't been cleaned. I'm not one to rant but I was really upset with how the place is maintained especially when this was my fav shop a few years back. The crew was sweet as always but unfortunately I don't have any desire to make it back anytime soon!
2019-05-18,1,About 3 months ago when it was ran by the owner this 16Handles was amazing ! Everything working, nice and clean, even had a convo with the owner really good experience, fast forward 3 months I just went in and there was 2 girls sitting down looking at their phones. A few of the machines where down, some of the toppings had to be restocked, everything is was messy. I'll try this place again in a few months hopefully they impro ...I ended going back today a month or so later to see if any improvements where made but unfortunately 3 machines where down and some of the other ones had no labels I asked if they knew which is which but the girl didn't know either we just ended up leaving this time and didn't purchase anything.
2019-05-17,3,This is a pretty cool dessert place - trendy and hip. There are a lot of flavors of frozen yogurt ranging from mango, to Nutella Hazelnut, cookies and cream, chocolate, strawberry&banana, mint chocolate chip and more. The choices of toppings are endless, to name a few: chocolate chips, kiwis, cherries, peanut butter cups, Oreos, hazelnut crisps, coconut, and plenty of more. Please note- the choices of toppings fully outweigh your selection of flavors of your base froyo. Overall I rate this place a 3.2 out of 5 stars. Why you may ask? Please see the facts of my visit below:1) The overall appearance of the area where you fill your base froyo looked dirty. There were leaking handles and cups everywhere.2) I originally chose to come here because my girlfriend wanted her froyo. I'm more of an ice cream kinda guy. The only reason why I agreed to go was because it was listed that they had ice cream in addition to frozen yogurt. When I asked the girl who worked there where I could get ice cream, she told me it wasn't available that they only had froyo. I had to ask more than once to get a clear and concise answer about the ice cream. Maybe 16 Handles should have an online notification when their ice cream machines are down, because this will really make or break some decisions to even visit this establishment. 3) Lastly, the guy at front had a bad attitude. He actually came to the other girl working in the back and told her to go up front because "he heard people talking shit." Maybe next time he should think to take her to the back to communicate something like that to her. The professionalism and customer service was just not there tonight. Overall, I was satisfied with the selection of options however the service tonight was not up to par.
2019-04-24,2,Froyo is fine but the hours online do not match the store. If it says online that they are open until 10pm there should not be a big "Closed" sign at 9pm.
2019-03-10,1,What happened to this place? I came in tonight and a few flavors were completely out of service. I tried one of the few working flavors and it just poured out like soup. The place was also a mess. The floor was dirty. There was drippy ice cream everywhere. Please, please hire friendly professional staff and clean up before the weather starts to get nice again!
2019-01-03,4,Brought the family here on last rainy Friday afternoon. The froyo was great! Everyone was happy with what they got. I loved the many options for vegan, fat free, etc. Many topping options too. We told the young, probably teenage girl that all the signs for the toppings were all in the wrong places, and she didn't care nor fix them. There was a walnut topping I wanted but it was coated with something sticky, I wanted to know why it was called but she was literally zero help. I asked her what syrup was in the bottle next to the register, because it was the only one without a label and she didn't know. Pretty annoying since the signs to the tops were all off too. We paid, sat and ate our froyo. They have a great view of the Hudson River and NY skyline, so this is a great spot for all seasons! I highly recommend the coconut flavor!! Another customer came in, got their goodies and had to literally yell hello because that same employee was in the back. Their froyo is great and hopefully next time the service is a little better.
2019-01-01,5,This is not only the best place for a treat but also has the most magnificent views of Manhattan from its windows. And now they are open year round too!
2018-10-08,2,This place is going downhill fast. It used to be my go-to, I'd go once-twice a week, but the past few weeks I don't know what is going on. About a month ago I noticed it stunk of sour milk and I told them about it and they said they knew about it, I think it was due to some leak. Fast forward a month later and it still stinks like that. This past weekend I went in and the place look like it had been ransacked by a kid's birthday party. Leftover cups of yogurt melting where the new cups were, tons of trash on the floor, a spill of yogurt and toppings all over the place dripping from the counter down to the floor, no hot fudge, half the amount of toppings available, frozen toppings that you couldn't even bite into. At one point my feet were sticking to the floor because it was so dirty and I told the girl behind the counter (who looked like she was so stressed she was about to walk out) how sticky it was and she said she knew but it was just her and one other girl in the back there. I actually went home and stuck my shoes in the sink to clean them. I don't know how many people you need to run a yogurt shop on a nice weekend day but clearly these 2 needed help because the place was a mess. Starting to wonder how clean and fresh everything is there and may stop going.
2018-09-26,1,I wouldn't recommend this place for several reasons. My partner and I wanted to stop by after our yoga class so he stepped in to inquire abut the time they closed since the hours were not posted. He walked in and 3 employees were there and no one knew what time they closed. This should have been the first sign something was off. We decided to give it a try after our class and I asked them what smoothies they have since they advertise smoothies on their glass. The employee looked confused and started looking around the counter for the menu? She didn't find it and I eventually saw a small piece of paper by the register with a blurry picture of the smoothies. I ordered one and then another customer just walks in front of me and places his frozen yogurt on the counter. The employee proceeds to check him and 2 other people out without acknowledging my order. Two other employees walk back in from taking the garbage and she asks them to make the smoothie I ordered...to which they replied "I don't think we have that one". I decided to just cancel my order and get frozen yogurt instead, which was overpriced and subpar. DONT go here. Horrible customer service, no one seems to know what they are doing, and too overpriced.
2018-08-27,2,It makes me sad to write this review, but after my experience last night I had to say something. My husband and I go to this location every week, usually on Sunday evenings. It's a little on the expensive side, but it was our weekly treat and enjoyed seeing the new flavors and topics. The store was clean and the workers were nice.I'm not sure if there is a new owner or management, but this location has severely gone downhill this summer. The machines are always broken and leaking all over the place, and there are rarely new flavors. The previously nice toppings like fruit have been replaced with cheaper items, such as stale cereal. The worst though is that the place is understaffed and a disaster. Last night when we were in the trash can in the back was missing, so customers just put their half-full, half-melting cups on the back table. No one seemed to be making an effort to clean it up. There were toppings all over the counter and on the floor. There were only two workers even though Sundays are one of their busiest time, and both seemed like they would rather be tortured for the rest of eternity than work there for another minute. I'm truly sad that this place has gone downhill so badly, and we will get our Sunday evening treats elsewhere from now on.
2018-08-02,1,This is a frozen yogurt place why are they listed as gelato?!?  Gelato is not the same thing as frozen yogurt.   I went to this location looking for gelato because Yelp has them listed as such and what I found is what you find at every mediocre frozen yogurt place. A place where you put tons of toppings in order to stomach the frozen yogurt.Yelp should do better is describing places.
2018-07-22,3,I love the product but not the price. It's really incredibly expensive for a takeaway treat. I feel ripped off by the price, and am always shocked that my little cup ends up costing $9-10 (and I skip the toppings). Afterwards, I think what that amount would buy at the grocery store for a comparable product. I only go now if they have a special offer for app users.
2018-07-12,5,Delicious! The graham cracker flavor is my favorite :) lots of fun toppings. Recommend grabbing a cup and sitting by the water to enjoy the stunning city view!
2018-06-29,2,Where to begin?  Basically they are doing well because they have zero competition!  Aside from the ice cream truck near pier 13, there is no one to compete with.  This having been said, the yogurt and toppings are good, but the place could be cleaned up a bit.  The owner is making money and doesn't care that we are staring at filthy fingerprints on the protective glass over the toppings.  No one is cleaning up the tables and I saw half started containers sitting right under the yogurt spigot. I could do a better job managing this place in my sleep.
2018-06-19,4,Basic outpost of a chain here. Friendly staff and a space kept really nice and clean. Not much to say if you've been to any other location.
2018-06-04,3,My wife likes this place more than I do. The ice cream is soft serve and it all tastes the same to me. This place has about 402685 toppings to choose from so I alwayd find myself overdoing it. The topping choices are amazing and I guess the ice cream is a great vehicle to hold it but the ice cream alone is not special. The experience is always pleasant. They weight your order and that is how you pay. It is a cool concept just not for everyone. If you are an ice cream enthusiast i wouldnt recommend but if you are a topping fan this is your place.
2018-05-24,1,I was excited to try this place but will not be back due to rude employee.  I opened the door  at 11:45am and before I even stepped foot inside the employee said "We are not open Ma'am!!"  In a very rude tone.  I totally understand telling a customer you are not open but why be rude about it?  How would I know you weren't open if the door was open?  Not a huge deal but definitely left a bad taste in my mouth and I will not be returning.   The employee was female, probably around twenty with dark straight hair pulled back in a pony and maybe glasses.
2018-05-11,3,I am a frequent 16 handles customer at this location. I am VERY disappointed to hear that the Hoboken location is no longer carrying mochi. I will now think twice about where to get FroYo in Hoboken.
2018-04-23,1,If I could leave zero stars I could. I've been here twice before and had a normal experience. This last time I came i at 7PM, half the flavors were missing, a ton of the topping were missing and mislabeled and exchanged with other shitty ones. All of the flavors were hand written on little pieces of paper. (Super unprofesisonal). Not to mention the prices literally DOUBLED. For two little cups it was 19 dollars!!!! What the heck?? Apparently they're under new management. Must be some mediocre management. So sad. This was only froyo place around here. Even Williamsburg 16 handles in Brooklyn is cheaper. This is New Jersey, relax, don't jack up the prices. So disappointed. Never coming back here.
2018-04-17,5,16 Handles is a great place to go for a sweet, refreshing treat! It's so nice I Sadie and there is an amazing view of nyc. I love that is self-serve and you can as many flavors as you want and in any quantity. The flavors are changed often, so I can always expect something new and unique! I like a lot of the fruit flavors and the Nutella flavor.  Toppings are always fresh and delicious- my personal favorite are the strawberry poppers!!16 Handles gets five stars any day of the week!!!
2018-02-09,5,Who doesn't love froyo? This place has the best yogurt selections & the best toppings. Sad it closes in the winter, but gives you something to look forward to when it opens!
2017-09-13,4,My favorite fro-yo place. I usually end up spending more than I should here but I can't help it, their toppings always look so good
2017-08-22,5,Yum yum yum!! Love it but prefer to go when there are no kids (sorry parents). It gets a little hectic with the kiddies who run amuck. When it's quiet I enjoy the experience. Plenty of toppings and flavors but they do run out and forget to mark the machines as 'out'. Highly recommend! Clean, fun, and delicious!
2017-08-20,5,I am not a big fan of ice cream in general!! But this place is amazing.. can't say no to their ice cream..
2017-08-15,5,Such an amazing froyo place. It is right across from the water so you can sit outside. They also have great flavors and amazing toppings!
2017-06-08,2,I've ordered delivery from 16 Handles 3x. The first time was fine; delivery took a little longer than anticipated but not bad. The second and third times were terrible. I ordered mint with fudge and cookie dough pieces. I received a call both times stating that they didn't have mint-fine, switch the flavor. The first time, I received my order none of the toppings were included. I called 16 Handles and was told they'd send someone back out. I called back 20 minutes later and was told they would call Grubhub to see if the delivery guy would come back. He never showed up & I never received a call. I only found out they weren't doing anything when I received and email from Grubhub stating that the price of my toppings was refunded. The next time, the same scenario occurred, but the driver decided to complain about the distance & state that he would not be coming back. I tried to call 16 Handles, but apparently they closed early and never picked up. Needless to say, they've lost customers. I don't know who is running this place, but the service is legitimately terrible.
2016-09-26,5,Amongst other frozen yogurt places I have been to, this one currently ranks best amongst them all. The flavors here are unique and quite delectable. I got the cinnamon rice pudding, vanilla bean, and peanut butter perfection, all outstanding choices.
2016-09-12,2,As a resident to the area for 6 years, I always bring friends and family by your location for a treat.   Last night wasn't any different, my boyfriend and I checked on your website to ensure that we could take a walk and come by for yogurt.As we got to your store at 10:07pm your cashier said "we are closed, but if you are quick I can take you." We agreed and walked in, as I begin serving myself my yogurt, literally cup in hand, handle down; your in store manager starts screaming "store is closed, cashiers shut,!" as other customers had walked in behind us and starts turning all the machines off, including the one I was currently using/serving myself.  My boyfriend, me, and possibly 5 other, strangers/customers whom I do not know, were perplexed. We all said to each other and at her  stores hours are until 10:30pm.  She self identified as the manger and stated, we are closing early because "I feel l like it."   We were immediately escorted out of your store by this  "manger" with very little to none in customer service skills.  I stood outside verify on your websties the store hours and  again very perplexed about what had transpired. I cannot believe I was just treated this way, the machine was turned off on me as I am physically pouring yogurt and a manger who says, "because I feel like it."  Last night you would have had at least 7-8 additional customers between  10:05pm and 10:30pm. The managers behavior is foul and it is unfortunate  but going forward I can take my business where I will be treated respectfully.
2016-09-11,1,No words can be used to describe the lack of respect and poor customer service. 10 people walked into the store, grabbed cups and had begun to use the machines when the manager proceed to shut them off and tell us they were closed. The sign on the door said open until 10:30pm and it was 10:07. Whoever hired that woman should seriously re evaluate her employment. I have never seen such an abomination before. Should be ashamed.
2016-09-11,1,Horrible customer service. Website says they close at 10:30pm. 10 people walk in at 10:10pm and the manager kicked everyone out even as customers were about to use machine. Unbelievable to think that a business would be so rude to kick customers out of the store for no reason other than the manager felt like closing early.
2016-08-02,4,Same as every other 16 handle franchise. Good location, fresh ingredients, and space for seating. Hope they would get rid of the tasting option, it is just tacky and gives it a dirty feeling.
2016-07-14,4,Visited for the first time yesterday, definitely not the last. Had the "European" flavor which was a plain sour frozen yogurt, kind of what I'm used to from other froyo establishments. I liked it a lot. There was a great selection of toppings including plenty of fruit and I was more or less able to control my portion size. I have to say I am not a fan of self-service froyo but this place was nice, clean and pleasant. They even have black and white cookies on the toppings bar. I'm looking forward to trying more flavors.
2016-06-08,5,We always hit up this froyo joint on hot sunny days. Located at a perfect spot by the waterfront - nothing beats snacking on froyo while enjoying the NY skyline. Typically we go with the vanilla yogurt flavor topped with lots of yummy fruit - all them berries , blackberries, blueberries and raspberries.This last time I grabbed the cookies and cream flavor and was very pleased. My wife was initially bummed that it wasn't vanilla but after a bite she came around fast! It's about $7 per cup. A little on the expensive side but it is quality.
2016-05-14,4,Really good frozen yogurt! I love that it is self serve so you can select multiple favors and toppings. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because many flavor were out when we were there so the selection was limited.
2016-04-04,5,16 Handles is always my go-to when I'm looking for a sweet treat. The yogurt flavor options are endless and there are always new options to choose from each time you walk in the door. There is so much variety in the topping options as well - healthy or not so healthy, they have it all. Highly recommend on a hot summer day or a chilly winter day - any day of the week, month, or year basically.
2015-12-12,2,I've been to this location many times and ordered in for delivery twice. Each time I went in was great with the exception of their rewards card - which they were always out of. Both times I've ordered in I've received the wrong order. If you have your heart set on something and plan on having it delivered, prepare to be disappointed. Not doing this again.
2015-12-07,3,I heard this place is a chain, but I needed a quick fro-yo fix, so I stopped by one in Hoboken. The selection wasn't bad, however I wish there was more options for fruit toppings - I only saw a few that looked fresh. The location is close to the water, but you can't get to it by car due to the current construction. It's a good standard fro-yo spot if you need something quick! Price is decent too - I think the most I ever pay is about $5 a small cup.
2015-10-25,5,Small cups are available so you can taste test before committing. And, nutritional info is posted along with allergens. I highly recommend the salted caramel....yum!
2015-08-27,5,Best FroYo in Hoboken! All the flavors are delicious and I love that they put the allergy info on ALL products, toppings as well! Only place I'll bring visitors! Love love love! Wish it was closer than 11th st!
2015-08-17,4,Love that they allow samples. The flavors tend to be hit or miss -- some are delicious, some are a little fake-tasting, some are cloyingly sweet...This is where being able to sample gets to be extremely helpful! Great selection of toppings.The last time I was there, at least 3 machines were out of service (I want to say 4?). That was a buzzkill. Maybe it was just because we stopped by on a busy Saturday. No worries, we each got something to satisfy our sweet tooth while relaxing along the water.One word of warning: We've only been here in the evening...and there are usually kids running around (I don't blame them for being so excited!). Try to time it so that you can get in, get yours, and get out before they take over. If not, it's a small shop -- easy enough to give them a minute or two at the machines before you help yourself.
2015-07-19,5,Very happy with this 16 handles. The staff is always helpful and the store is clean. Great flavors to choose from and plenty of seating spots. Not to mention that you can eat your fro yo on the benches across the street while gazing at the Manhattan skyline. Bonus!
2015-06-18,4,So good. Gets slammed, especially on nice nights, but nothing outrageous. Super nice to be able to go sit by the water!
2015-05-06,3,Pros: - Lots of yuppie eye candy hang out around here- If you're a dog owner/lover, lots of folks with adorable puppies/dogs hang out around here- Tons of topping options  Cons: - Bland flavors. Case in point: the plain / tart yogurt, the "base" flavor and ingredient of any frozen yogurt, is barely tart and tastes like frozen sugar water (so, you'll have to drown your froyo in around a pound of toppings to add flavor to it)- If you're a cat person, lots of folks with adorable puppies/dogs hang out around here Recommendation: decent/average froyo; unless you need a froyo fix stat, head farther south into Hoboken to Red Mango
2015-05-03,4,Great place to stop by on a hot day. 16 varieties of self service soft serve sold by weight with plenty of toppings and extras!Particularly liked the pistachio and salted caramel. Not bad value, but not cheap either - worth it with the sun shining!Would definitely come back to try some of the other flavours.
2015-04-11,5,Awesome frozen yogurt.  And ridiculously good flavours and mixes of flavours.  Made better at this location by really friendly staff (who kindly look the other way if you get a bit heavy-handed when sampling flavours!!).  Typically plenty of space to sit other than a warm Saturday mid-afternoon.  Cool layout, great rewards program, nice seating, perfect location on the water.  And like really cheap for such good froyo!
2015-03-27,5,This 16 Handles location is the cleanest, most well stocked I've seen by a long shot.  I've been to plenty of the busy, rowdy, dirty locations in NYC to know that we have a great one here in Hoboken.  Not only are the patrons always very courteous, so are the employees.  I'm a huge fan.  Just wish they didn't close for the winter season because I want my froyo year round!!
2015-03-15,5,YUM! YUMMMMM!16 flavors of which I loved at least 5. Where frozen yogurt & I are concerned that is a record!  Wonderful assortment of toppings too.Typically self serve frozen yogurt places have 1, maybe 2 flavors that I like.  Most of the time there is 1 that I like, if I'm lucky.   The most amazing thing about 16 Handles frozen yogurt is how authentic the flavors taste.  You can REALLY taste the actual flavor in the yogurt, not just a hint of it.   The most difficult part about this place was deciding between:  Cookies & Cream (tasted like oreos), Sweet Cream (tasted like freshly whipped sweet cream), Tahitian Vanilla Bean (with lots of real vanilla bean!) and Cinnamon Bun (tasted like an actual Cinnabon cinnamon bun).  I 'settled' on a mixture of Cinnamon Bun and Tahitian Vanilla bean, then added graham cracker crumbs, toasted almonds and freshly whipped cream.  It was delicious, creamy, thick and tasted exactly like I wanted it to taste.
2015-01-22,5,The location and the froyo is best here. View the NY City skyline on a hot Summer night eating froyo with all toppings fruit, crunchy and sweet. There's no parking here, but you can park for a minute and leave someone in the car while you pick up the treats. That's my only problem with this location - no place to park, legally and easily, nearby. The flavors are great and the topping interesting and fresh. Neat and clean, this place is my favorite!
2015-01-07,5,I love this place and their yogurt!!! So many flavors with delicious toppings. My go to frozen yogurt place :))) much better than any other yogurt place I have ever went to.
2014-11-22,4,Best froyo in town.  The convenience is great to.  We would love to go to the ones in Manhattan and were upset when we moved to Hoboken but then we found out that there was one right around the corner
2014-10-07,5,Best froyo! Large assortment of flavours and topping! All the froyo flavours are amazing but I'm a chocote junkie so I usually stick with that.For the toppings they have these cool shiny metallic chocolate rocks and, and sweet/sour gummy bears, and this thick chocolate Nutella crunch stuff. Those are the three toppings I usually get from the many they offer. Aside from the actual froyo the location of 16Handles is AMAZING and BEAUTIFUL. It is located just infront of the water front and has a breath taking view. I never eat in the actual froyo shop because there are benches and little tables across the street.
2014-09-29,3,Every now and then we stop over for a little dessert or a snack and always leave satisfied.Decor: It is a frozen yogurt shop, plain and simple. There is plenty of room to move around but seating is at a premium (but benches that overlook the river are just out the door!) It's very clean and very well lit and inviting.Bathroom: I don't believe they have one for customer use.Staff: The teenage staff is friendly and nice. They keep the place nice and clean and quickly ring up customers at the register (which allows you to consume your delicious concoction even more rapidly upon completing its build).Food/Drink: They have... you guessed it... 16 different flavors across a whole range of different tastes. Usually, I go with some kind of berry something and it is always great. The assortment of toppings is wonderful! I dare you to find something you don't like!Value: It's by weight, so keep that in mind. But your dollars will get you a very hearty bowl full of fro-yo here.It's a good place that always keeps us coming back, albeit sporadically.
2014-09-03,5,I am a froyo fanatic...this place is the best! The frozen yogurt is very fresh and tasty compared to other froyo places I've been too. The toppings are on par. And it is a great location!
2014-08-19,5,Interesting layout and great location. It's a paradise for little kids and their moms. I tried raspberry, coconut and chocolate flavors, and add some crisp balls with chocolate cream (sorry I don't know its name) for decoration. I had my ice cream and sat on a bench next to Hudson River and enjoyed great view of Manhattan, and that's an experience second to none!:-) btw thanks to stuff girl for giving me guidance!
2014-08-03,3,I like Downtown Yogurt in JC better. The yogurt itself was watery and melted very quickly (duh). The toppings are pretty much the same as all of your standard frozen yogurt self-serve spots. One detailed observation I made was that the almond topping is in chunks, and not shaved slices, which obviously adds to the weight. I get that this is how these places make money, but its just sad when the customers notice it. The good:Unlimited tiny little white cups for you to try all the flavors.Paper divider to put in your cup (smart idea).Girls at the counter were super nice though!
2014-07-20,5,There is barely any advertisement for this froyo hot spot because they simply don't need one. You can sample as many as you like and the flavors are beyond delish. My favs were pistachio, coconut custard and birthday cake. Good luck on parking but the view totally makes up for it.
2013-11-19,5,This place is amazing! So many awesome flavors! And their toppings are even better! Now that I live down the block, I'll be here all the time
2013-09-22,4,Love this place with a lot of choices of froyo and toppings. Service could be improved. The casher accidentally dropped the spoon on the floor but he didn't notice it. I had to ask for another one.
2013-09-05,5,GAAH I WANT TO LIVE HEREI came on opening day when they had the free yogurt (which was altered to a $5 maximum XD) and I just fell in love with this place. I'm so happy that I live close to this place, but I just wish they had smaller cupsbecause I do take advantage of the self-serve aspect of frozen yogurt bars. ERMAHGERD COME HERE OR GO TOHELL FOR YOUR SINS
2013-08-28,5,I am going to gain so much weight if I keep on coming here, Lol! But the flavors are so delicious and fresh tasting. And there's a great assortment for all palettes.
2013-08-23,4,Really good selection of interesting flavors.  They let you try samples, which means you can narrow in on the flavor that truly interests you.  I don't often eat frozen yogurt; this place may induce me to doing it more often.  Good work.  What next for 16 Handles? A calorie free version that tastes equally as good?  That'd be nice.
2013-08-17,5,They have some pretty unique flavors. Lots of toppings to choose from, too. I like this froyo spot more than most!
2013-08-06,5,This is definitely the best frozen yogurt I've ever had.When I first discovered "froyo" I didn't jump on the bandwagon and fall in love with it instantly. Hoboken being a froyo fest, it's been hard to dodge the 4 years I've lived here. However, I was definitely intrigued by 16 Handles decor and location and that alone had me excited to go and try it out.I will again say that this was definitely the best frozen yogurt I've ever had. They have 16 flavors and I tried 3- Cinnamon Bun, Graham Cracker, and Vanilla (they have more elaborate names for these flavors but they're escaping my mind right now) and they were all delicious! Not overly tart, not overly creamy, but they were on point. They even smelled good!I think their toppings bar blows away any competition as well. The cheesecake bites tasted like actual cheesecake. They had a large assortment of fruits and chocolate candies, and a whole lot of sauces to accompany. I got marshmallow and it was heavenly.If you live in Hoboken, you have to come try it out. Between the taste and the view, it's great for a mini treat!
2013-07-12,5,The new gold standard in self-serve froyo! This place beats anyone else in town. Here's why:=16(!) flavors of frozen yogurt, varying from light & healthy to indulgent (but even indulgent froyo isn't really that bad compared to the alternatives)=GOOD froyo and creative flavors. On one visit I made a "S'Mores in a Bowl" by combining Toasted Marshmallow, Chocolate and Graham Cracker (yes, really) froyo and it was AWESOME=Readily available sample cups right by the machines=Nice, clean space with good views and a decent amount of seating inside=Best assortment of toppings that I've seen. I can't even begin to list them all, so I won't. But yeah, there are a ton.=A loyalty program (unfortunately it means carrying around yet another plastic card though...boo) that will reward you for your froyo purchases, with more froyo!I am thankful that this is uptown and I am downtown or I might blow up like a hot air balloon just from devouring mass quantities of delicious frozen treats here.
2013-07-07,4,I was happily surprised when I stepped into this froyo shop in Maxwell Place. Definitely the best layout of a 16 Handles I've ever seen! It has a nice, easy flow from the stations to the toppings to the register. The seating area is kinda closed off from the main area -- definitely interesting, and almost futuristic!On a Friday night, the employees were friendly, welcoming, and still smiling. The froyo is excellent, as we've all come to expect from 16 Handles. The toppings are fresh & well-kept. And it's just a short walk to the water, where you can sit & enjoy your customized dessert with a gorgeous view of NYC. Perfect!
2013-07-02,4,I'm not usually a fan of froyo but I'm def a fan of this place. I currently live in a house full of my sorority sisters and they're all in love with it. I finally got tired of listening to them go on and on about this place so I finally went to try it out. And am I glad I did. I LOVE this place! The ambiance is bright and summery, there's seating area, and you're right by the pier. All the froyo flavors are amazing. And the toppings even better. My personal fave is the Strawberry flavor; it's just so damn refreshing.Another perk of this place is that they have loyalty cards and once you reach a certain amount of points it gets discounted from what you pay. Also simply by registering the loyalty card online, you get a ton of points.
2013-05-29,3,I will continue to go because its pretty much the only spot in uptown Hoboken. But with a market so saturated, you have to be on point. It pains me to say-The yo. It was not fro. Despite the rainbow of delicious sounding flavors, the two I sampled came out drippy and definitely not quite solid. Within seconds my creation was a yogurty, toppingy soup in a cup and that is not cool. Literally. The toppings are high quality and the area is very neat and clean. But the yogurt itself was unsatisfactory.
2013-05-28,5,Great self-serve yogurt place that labels their ingredients for allegen-sensitive visitors.  The flavors change periodically and every kind I've had has been great.  The price isn't too bad either, considering self-serve can sometimes be overpriced.  Well done!
2013-05-14,4,This is the 32453745th frozen yogurt place in Hoboken. But it will likely do very well being one of the only ones uptown and in Maxwell place with enough strollers packing the place to keep them in business for years to come.I don't know what else can be said about a frozen yogurt joint. They have a great selection of flavors, every one I tried were fantastic (the salted caramel was pretty epic). They had three flavors that just were begging to be put together, toasted marshmallow, chocolate and graham cracker...yeah that's right I made a froyo s'more....awesome.The selection of toppings is pretty great, no different really than love and yogurt downtown.I don't give 5 stars because of the layout it's in this half circle and it is a free-for-all with no rhyme or reason to it, Ii think the curve throws everyone off. And of course the fact that most people are oblivious to those around them everyone just stands in awkward spots looking at the selections. It was kind of a P.I.T.A. to get samples or get the flavor you like. People, you don't need to stand in front of 5 flavors to sample one, get your sample and get out of the way!
2013-05-10,4,Fro yo meets uptown! So glad to have a place with a ton of variety and flavors uptown. The set up of the place can be very cramped when crowded - but nevertheless I'm certainly glad to have it open finally!
2013-05-04,4,I love the graham cracker frozen yogurt! I also really enjoyed the cheesecake, toasted marshmallow, & salted caramel. As for the toppings my two favorites were the hazelnut crunch and the strawberry bubbles. Both were things I have never tried before and absolutely delicious .I definitely see myself walking down here a few times a month at least. I can't wait to try the other flavors!
2013-04-21,5,Was waiting for one to open in Hoboken.  Finally made the trek uptown today to try it and was not disappointed.  They have amazing flavors and love that you can try them all before deciding.  Best frozen yogurt in Hoboken.
2013-04-08,5,Customer service was outstanding,,,I was treated extremely well. Personnel that stood out for me was an employee by the name of Christina..she was professional, pleasant, and made my experience enjoyable and a pleasant one. I also was impressed by the service of an employee name Billy... recommend this place to anyone who loves yogurt...it is delicious and if you go ask for Christina or Billy....they will make you feel at home...5 stars for yogurt and personnel!!
2013-04-08,5,This is what I love about capitalism and free trade, especially in industries with low barriers to entry.  Competiion is encouraged and new entrants will undoubtedly have to offer superior products.  So the frozen yogurt craze has been going on for quite sometime.  Side note, it's called frozen yogurt, not froyo or some other lame expression.  Don't even get me started on people calling vegetables "veggies".  Anyway, with a bunch of these places popping up in Hoboken, it's been fun, but I was kinda waiting for a place that really did it right.  Enter 16 handles.  It's in a great location, really cool, inviting decor, and is very clean.  The different flavors are really good, and it's nice that they let you sample them.  The topping selection is just incredible.  All kinds of fun candies, cakes, cookies, fruits, nuts, etc.  So here is my secret.  I put a layer of cookie dough and rainbow cookies and all kinds of fun stuff in the middle, put more yogurt on top of it, and then finish it off with some fruit on top.  That way, a young lady just coming from a workout sees me, and thinks, oh look at that healthy chap, I suppose I shall start a chat with him...I think the price is pretty good too, but don't hold me to that, my concoctions usually ring in at well over a pound...It's just a happy place, with tons of stoked lil kids and eager puppies waiting outside..oh, and they have dog treats for you to to give to your dog..so thoughtful..It's also right by the water, so it's just a great location.
2013-04-03,5,Hands down the best frozen yogurt in Hoboken - and the area at large! Endless toppings bar and always 16 flavors, including a non dairy sorbet. Don't go anywhere else for frozen yogurt!
2013-04-02,5,The Salted Caramel flavor is AMAZING!  I wish they had some smaller cup options to help me with portion control, but then again I guess that is how they make their money.I wish they were downtown. So delish!
2013-04-01,4,Finally frozen yogurt uptown!! This was very exciting for me. They had my favorites, mango and red velvet and are in an ideal location for summer, right along the Hudson with amazing views and a park across the street to relax and enjoy my froyo. Great customer service and very nice modern bright place. My only let down, no popping bobas! I am obsessed with these balls and can't have my froyo without them! So I hope this place gets them soon so I don't have to walk 10 blocks for them.
2013-03-22,5,We couldn't be more excited about the Hoboken location finally being open! Just got back from some delicious (all working machines!) The people working in the store are so sweet and helpful we adored this one girl who helped us taste test a ton of flavors! She made it really hard for us to make a decision, because everything was beyond delicious! Each flavor is better than the next. The location is incredible and the topping selections are endless.  Love the decor so fun and bright! This place is going to make a killing, probably the best thing to happen to Hoboken in a while!
2013-03-20,5,This place is going to be dangerous for me, because it is right by my apartment.  It just opened a couple of weeks ago and they are doing everything right.  When you walk in, you are blasted with bright colors.  There is a small play room to the side for small children, along with a fairly spaciuos area that I would call a "lounge" area which has all kinds of colorful and funky-shaped couches, along with brightly-colored neon lights that make you feel like you are in some kind of dream world.The staff has obviously been trained very well, and they are very helpful and friendly.  There was someone standing in the back near all the yogurt dispensers asking people if they wanted any free samples.  I sampled 3 flavors--birthday cake, graham cracker, and peanut butter, and ended up buying a little bit of birthday cake and a little bit of graham cracker.  And there are plenty of other flavors I will be trying in the near future.The yogurt was delicious, and they had all kinds of inventive toppings to choose from, including fruity pebbles, nutella crunch, crushed whoppers, and pretty much anything you can think of, along with all kinds of syrups including marshmallow, caramel, peanut butter and many others.  My cup was maybe about 2/3 of the way full, and it cost about $3.70, which I felt was very reasonable.  And you can't beat the location.  Right on the waterfront with a great view, this place is going to be a goldmine in the warm weather, considering all the people that hang out near the Maxwell Place pier.  We ate our yogurt in what I would call the "lounge" area, and looked out at the Hudson River.  The comfortable, colorful furniture along with the upbeat music really almost makes you feel like you're in a lounge, but you're not, you're in a yogurt shop! If Willy Wonka opened a yogurt shop, it would look like this.  Truly "as good as it gets" when it comes to a frozen yogurt experience.
