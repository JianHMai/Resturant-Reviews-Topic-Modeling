2021-10-29,5,The Hive has great coffee and food served in a clean bright space with lots of seating and children's play room.
2021-10-23,5,Tasty and BOLD signature coffee drinks. Cute and creative to say the least. This cafeÃÅ has some hustle and bustle and if you give them a try you will see why. Light hearted and bright-eyed staff is great at introducing new-clients/customers to the deliciousness they call pastries and food.
2021-10-06,5,More than a coffee shop.... It is the Cheers of coffee shops... where everyone (wants to) know your name.   I never fail to leave smiling :)
2021-09-19,5,love this place! has a welcoming atmosphere and great selections- highly recommend the cereal milk latte :) I'm not a parent but i babysit and i also love that it is a great place to go and bring the little ones- that's definitely rare to find in a city but so important! Thank you The Hive!
2021-07-08,5,Amazing drinks and treats! The staff is so friendly and welcoming. The owners have done a great job at reaching out to the community. The space is beautiful and the play space in the back is a lot of fun! Best new business in Hoboken!
2021-05-26,5,The Hive is such a treat! Incredible atmosphere, coffee, & staff.
2021-05-25,5,What a treat to start my day! Walked in with no clue what to order. Nathan helped me pick a cereal milk latte, we had a laugh, and sang along to Stevie Nicks. I love it here. Nathan, you're an angel and my latte is delicious.
2021-05-14,4,This place was delightful - I went to try their cereal milk matcha latte as I've heard amazing things about it. It was very good! The place was adorable and the owners were sweet as could be. Very helpful in helping me navigate what to order as a new customer and were extremely friendly. Next time I will try some coffee and sweets.
2021-03-24,5,Wow. I just happened to visit this amazing coffee bar. I had by far the best latte. The place is so clean. Super friendly staff
2021-03-09,5,This is our favorite neighborhood coffee shop! The owners and staff are so so nice and we come in with our dog and they are so sweet to her. Not to mention the coffee is incredible! Ashley is the best barista around! Thank you guys!
2021-01-26,5,The sweet owners of the Hive are committed to making every customer feel special and welcomed. This shop is such a great addition to Hoboken! Coffee options are amazing, and I will definitely miss the Winter spiced cold brew in the warmer months! The hot chocolate bombs look incredible but are in such high demand so definitely keep an eye on their instagram for a heads-up on the next drop. If you go in the morning, they have typical breakfast pastries like scones and croissants (delicious almond croissant!). If you go in the afternoon, you must get a confetti cookie! The whole aesthetic is amazing and beautiful. I don't have kids, but I know that young families must love having a safe and sanitized place for kids to play--especially after months in lock down.
2021-01-25,5,Such a great spot!! The ambiance is on point, the owner is so nice, and everything taste amazing!!
2021-01-24,4,This coffee shop has that clean/modern/hipster feel to it that is the craze these days. Coffee is about marketing and branding and this place does a good job of that. The line out the door helps too! The coffee/tea are definitely good here. The matcha latte is well crafted and proportioned right.  It is overpriced but by now that is expected for places like this. I tried all the baked goods and they were hit and miss. The flattened almond croissant was decent but didn't taste fresh. The cheddar scallian scone was a hockey puck. The energy bites were great and I would stick to those if you come. They have a baby play room in the back which is unique and fun. It seems like they are also dog friendly since I saw a dog in there. The aestethics here are top notch and I like the passion they have for the business.  It was really clean which is always a plus. Definitely check it out.
2021-01-14,5,There are a lot of cute coffee shops in the area and I'm happy to report The Hive is up there with the best of them. The space is airy and very Insta-friendly, with a great curation of locally-made gifts/products to peruse while you wait for your (delicious) drink. I don't have a kid, but do love and appreciate that there's a play area while parents take a breather for their caffeine fix. Such a great concept for this area!What really separates The Hive, though, is their customer service. The barista/owner is very friendly and personable... and on the times we've taken our pup, they have a treat ready for her without fail which is super thoughtful. Thoughtful is a great description of The Hive - from the concept to the service, they are thoughtful of your experience in their shop. For instance, on my last visit there was a child who was having fun (but loud!) in the playroom - the staff at The Hive did not embarrass the parent/child and force them to curb their enjoyment. But mindful of other customers' experience in the shop, they offered free cookies to enjoy with our drinks. Thoughtful, right?Long story short - I love this shop and will definitely be back soon and often.
2021-01-13,5,As an avid coffee lover in Hoboken, I easily found The Hive within a few weeks of opening. The owners did such an amazing job creating a warm coffee shop for customers in the area that includes a play pen for little kids!Their specialty coffees are very good and their bakery food is out of this world!!I have to say my favorite part about it is the owners and workers. Their staff/owner is so nice and courteous. She also has provided some amazing recommendations I would highly recommend checking this place out if you haven't.
2021-01-06,4,Before I start my review, let me just say that I am not a mom, I live super close to this place, and I greatly miss Truglio's - the business here before The Hive. With all of that being said, I came to The Hive with a fairly open mind.... and I'm currently very torn on how I feel about this place. First off, I've tried the drip coffee as well as the matcha latte and both were very good - Like better than average good. The drip coffee is about $2.50 and the regular matcha latte is around $5 and then more expensive if you want a non-dairy milk. I ordered a larger matcha latte yesterday with oat milk and the total price came out to be $6.66. Not a very friendly number.... and perhaps a sign? *shrug* haha I'm just kidding!! But still ...that's kind of weird. Anyway, there is a lot of space inside for strollers and they have a play area for kids. There are a few shelves and a table filled with products - I remember seeing some candles, eco-crayons, play doh, etc. They also have a few tables and chairs outside to sit, but little to no seating inside. (This could be a COVID thing) All in all, this is a place targeted to moms and families. I can see moms coming here to spend the afternoon or grabbing a quick coffee and snack. Overall, to me, this place is probably a once in awhile quick coffee run.
2020-12-15,5,Cute spot! The interior is really pleasing and modern, nice spacious space even has a play area for the little ones, much bigger than it looks from the outside. I had an americano and a cheddar choice scone and omg I cannot stop thinking about the next time I'm going to eat that scone it was nicely baked, so very flavorful, and delicious! Americano was great as well. The woman who helped me was very nice and informative when asked about the peppermint matcha (the next drink I'm going to try!)
2020-12-10,5,I love The Hive and can not shut up about it. Very cool scene. Every thing I've tried until now has been wonderful. Bonus that their service is so outstanding, they are so fast and welcoming. Overall, would definitely come back.
2020-12-05,5,Love this friendly neighborhood gem that recently opened in Hoboken. The coffee is top quality (most important thing, of course), the menu is unique and robust, the shop items are cute and actually interesting, and the staff is incredibly friendly! I'm not the type to usually go out of my way to review (although I certainly rely on them), but this place deserves it. Highly recommend.
2020-12-04,5,I absolutely love this coffee shop. I've tried the Pumpkin Latte with Oat Milk, as well as the Vanilla Matcha Latte with Oat Milk and both were so so good. They're cookies are delicious, and their employees are super nice. I wish I knew the women's name who made my coffee today but she was an absolute doll.
2020-11-25,5,Such a cute coffee shop with the most friendly staff. My new go to. Love the kids play area, nice decor, reasonable prices, great coffee. What a great addition to Hoboken.
2020-11-19,5,Ordered a mocha and chocolate croissant from here. Both were fantastic! I could tell the quality of coffee in the mocha was good. So happy this is only a block away!
2020-11-18,5,So clean, beautiful, and friendly inside! The food is wonderful, drinks are great, and they have the cutest gifts and atmosphere. Really gorgeous to sit inside and just look around. I love a clean business and this place is truly spotless!
2020-11-18,5,This place is amazing! The owner is super nice and the space is super kid friendly. It's clean and has an actual play space for preschoolers! Will definitely visit frequently!
2020-11-12,5,Stunning coffee shop. Most importantly, the coffee is delicious. Iced oat milk latte was fantastic!
2020-11-11,5,A much needed new concept, The Hive!  A place where lifelong friendships can forge.  Parents can relax and bond with one another over a  hot beverage ( or cold) while  the little ones play.   Plus the menu has an amazing range from nostalgic to trendy.  Definitely worth checking out.
2020-11-08,5,This place is everything!!! We are so excited to welcome this wonderful little coffee and bespoke retail gem to the neighborhood.The owners are two wonderful mothers, and the space is just gorgeous inside and out! They have a nice coffee/tea list (long enough with enough choices but not so many to make your head spin), they have wonderful pastries and my husband and I cannot WAIT for the fresh cinnamon rolls!!!!!!Oh, and did I mention the super cute curated retail section of natural products for mom and Bebe, and the play room in the back?  Sure a lot of moms, parents, and all of the neighbors alike will be happy to have this friendly neighborhood coffee shop uptown.  They officially open tomorrow (11/9) at 7am and we're doing a soft opening this weekend for friends and family (that's what the pictures are from)! Please support them!
