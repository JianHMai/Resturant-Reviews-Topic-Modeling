2021-03-28,1,Awful disgusting place. Staff is horrible and bouncers are creeps. They touch harass women. Have their mask below their mouths and noses. One of them insulted my friend and threatened to kick us out if we don't speak to them properly. If I could give them a 0 stars I would
2021-03-20,4,Very fun atmosphere! I highly recommend this place if you're young and want as close to a bar scene as possible given these times. Great place to go for birthdays! Drinks are strong, food is okay. Stick to their fried food, or eat before. Do not get the avocado toast.
2021-02-20,1,The bouncers are the biggest hot heads on earth. I wanted to buy a round for me and my friends. The girl refused. He wanted me to charge it on the current open tab and want me to figure it out at the end. I told her that didn't work for me; I said never mind she got a bouncer and they asked me to leave. The girl was lazy and didn't want to open 2 tabs and it cost the bar 300$. I can't wait to have a talk with Al Silverman on Monday morning.
2021-01-20,4,This place is so fun to watch football games at. It does get packed and rowdy on Sundays. It's usually a younger crowd.They play loud music during the commercial breaks of football games. They have a lot of drink specials. Food is typical bar food.
2021-01-16,2,This is a fun-ish bar however they only put certain people near the DJ booth/in the front of the restaurant. If you're not "fun" enough they'll put you near the bathroom. Lol. Food is bad too. Ps waiter spilled on my and didn't say a word.
2020-12-16,5,Seriously the best service and food we've gotten in a while. Nicole was an absolute pleasure and a bright spot in a COVID era. Anyone looking for a great drink and fabulous service should consider this  spot. (This is unpaid review and was purely submitted as a result of awesome service.)
2020-11-22,1,Good food, but disgusting wild atmosphere. I don't mean about it being fun because I'm about that life & have always loved Wicked Wolf for that, but when it gets to the point like it was tonight that girls are literally flashing their bare naked boobs and twerking on stage, you question what type of place are you in. Absolutely atrocious.
2020-11-06,5,Wicked Wolf was basically my go to this entire past summer since no one could go anywhere and indoor dining was not open. The outdoor seating was great, and they had plenty of it, even on weekends. That's really surprising for Hoboken. I ate (and drank) my way down the menu, and there's nothing that was terrible. My personal favorites were the BBQ Chicken flatbread, the blackened chicken wrap and the buffalo wings. I really enjoyed the buffalo wings because they're tiny, and not covered in breading, so you feel sort of healthy while having it. I also enjoyed their drinks, albeit not that strong. Prices were extremely reasonable, and the staff/service were great! See you next summer Wicked Wolf!
2020-10-18,3,Not great food but good location and right near a great view. Solid drink deals and overall well-priced. Waiter was great.
2020-09-25,4,Came here on a Saturday night. They have indoor seating at limited capacity and some outdoor seating as well. Bars tend to be hotspots so we decided to sit outside. Staff was accommodating and took care of our wild 7 person table. Drinks we're pretty good and the food was good for bar food. Drinks will definitely rack up the bull but the food was decently priced. The buffalo chicken wrap was delicious and came with a side of fries. Their beer battered mozzarella stick were amazing, but was too full to finish them. Glad this place was able to stick it out through the Covid shit down.
2020-09-12,1,The bouncer was awful to all my friends and harassed us and received complaints from their own staff. He was rude and mad and made it an awful time for no apparent reason. Do not visit if ricky is working.
2020-09-12,4,The menu is pretty diverse for bar food. The burgers are impeccable and pretty large in size. The scene is nice but the music is extremely loud inside. It was so loud I would have had to text my friends to communicate with them but the outdoor seating was nicer in my opinion. The view of the city did not pair well with the constant boom of traffic and idiots revving their vehicles as they drive past. Overall quite a nice place to dine if you're looking for delicious burgers and some music. I hope you come hungry because the food takes a while to get to your table, but the moment it gets there be prepared to devour.
2020-09-12,4,Nice place Burgers was good, waiter was great, outside sitting with view was great.Only one thing was upsetting when I showed them Yelp10% discount when youre check in, they said its not good. What? Why? Why you putting then?Usually if Yelp giving me discounts it goes to a waiter. But not this time. Still left tip but not as big as usual.
2020-09-07,1,Not so great! Our parking meter only allowed 2 hours max and that should be plenty of time for a meal and walk around the waterfront. It took over 2 hrs just to get our food so had to move the car to another spot just so we can eat which took about another 30 min. COVID or not, 2 hour wait just for burgers is ridiculous and they weren't even very good. They also messed up the sides we ordered.  Never going back!
2020-09-05,1,The food was good so was the beer but when it came to paying, we spilt the bill on two cards. One of our cards was a prepaid $50 gift card. The waitstaff swiped $8 extra on that and then came and told us that "maybe the card didn't have a $50 limit" so we ended up paying 40 on that and the rest on my card and we tipped them on top of everything. You should not be fleecing your customers like that. Terrible behavior. Will not be returning to this restaurant nor will I be recommending it to anyone
2020-08-16,4,For an appetizer the rock shrimp was very good and for an entree the Fish tacos were pretty tasty, just wish they came with a side! Also the watermelon sangria was tasty!
2020-07-25,2,Honestly, I had amazing service at this place and my waiter was amazing (a Hispanic male, I didn't get his name sadly) BUT he was amazing and gave amazing service. I'm giving this place 2 stars because of him and the food was great, don't get me wrong. But one person in my party, lost her phone and knew she dropped it in the bathroom, since her location was on. We asked the man in the front (not our server), if we could check the bathroom because a phone is an expense that would be terrible if we lost and the first time he claimed he checked and said it wasn't there, but he obviously didn't. Our other set of friends went in and went to check AND it was there... I am very disappointed with that service and the fact that we were about to leave without her phone when it was in plain sight in the bathroom. Very disappointed.....
2020-02-28,1,If I could give ZERO stars I would.. your security staff is DISGUSTING! They were recording my drunk friend and LAUGHING. That is NOT OK & you should re-evaluate your horrible, trashy & disgusting security staff. Yes she was drunk but is it right to RECORD her without her consent? NOPE. Security are supposed to make people feel SAFE. Your security FAILED.
2020-02-15,1,I did not enjoy my experience at all. I ordered French toast and the bread was not done. Then I was over charged. Didn't see the manager at all despite the fact that we were in a group the waitress was not attentive at all. I will never go there again nor tell anybody to go there. So thank you for the horrible experience.
2020-02-12,3,College Frat House.  Great music on Sundays though!   If you're just going to watch a game, don't go here.  If you're looking to party and make believe you're watching a game, go here.  Food is good!  Had a wrap with fries (fries were out of control great).  anyway, if your crowd is a good party (and a younger party) head here.  I'm getting too old for these places!  Take an uber!  Besides the "take a shot" mentality every 1-2 hours, parking isnt the greatest--welcome to Hoboken!
2019-03-17,1,Came here on a Saturday night for St. Patricks Day and boy was it a terrible experience. We walked in at 11:30pm and the place was completely trashed with tables scattered, half-filled drinks on tables along with napkins all over the floor. Trashy people along with the trashy place as well. The crazy part was, my mixed drink was $15!! Word to the owner, if you're going to charge Manhattan prices then you better have Manhattan bar standards. Don't waste your time here, there are so many better bars around the corner.
2019-03-17,1,15 dollar drinks are served here!!! This place poorly ran, definitely reflection of management. Drinks are observably overpriced. Most of patrons the night I went were 18 years olds using fake IDs. I hate to say this but I found the place to be a bit scummy. Place was also very dirty. Lot of trash and food on the floor. The tables where very dirty. No one was cleaning them. The bouncer was spending his time flirty with underage drunk girls. Don't recommend coming here. The only thing going for it is it's view and closeness to the train station.
2019-02-14,1,Stopped by this past Thursday to enjoy some wings and have a beer. Fairly empty considering it was Valentines Day, but the service was lacking even still. We were done with our first round and had just ordered a second when I saw a rat run right under our table. After going up our waitress and the bartender they reassured me they weren't worried at all by it and that it was in fact a pet they kept around. That's a first... Needless to say, I won't be heading back down to Wicked Wolf. I know these things can happen when running a restaurant, but acting so blatantly worry free your customer just saw a rat run across your floor has me worried about what might actually worry the staff at this restaurant. What they've seen is probably much worse! They still graced us with our bill and we promptly took our leave.
2019-02-11,1,Ordered harvest pear salad through seamless and it was so dry. No dressing was put in even though balsamic vinegar was supposed to be part of this salad. Very disappointed.
2019-01-21,2,Mean bouncer who was okay with us freezing outside in -10 degrees. We waited outside for an hour to get in and eventually left because there was no chance of getting in. Free tequila shots while waiting in line would've been nice. Idk, will probably go back anyway.
2018-12-28,5,This place is incredible. Not only does this spot double as a chic brunch/dinner spot. (I recommend the sangria) but also a fun night out with friends. The service is impeccable, the staff is so nice, professional and friendly. (ESPECIALLY HOLLY)!! Also might I add this is one of the cleanest restaurants in Hoboken. I've been living here for a year and can't believe I just found out about this place!! Hidden gem.
2018-12-19,1,I'm not sure if they just gave up on sending hot food or if the delivery sucks. The first time I had them the food was good but a little cold. The second time the food was completely cold after being delivered 40 mins after the already 80 min time it initially said. The last time the food was very cold and presentation looked as if they gave me someone else's leftovers. I'm over them.
2018-11-06,3,Plain & Simple, this is a local Hoboken college bar. Order Bar food only and set low expectations if you are making this a dinner destination. I like to Stick to beer, sports and a good happy hour. The place gets loud but on the weekdays it is quieter. It is a great spot for groups and I never had a bad time here. About all Wicked wants to be and aims to please is the local bar scene.
2018-10-24,3,This place is defiantly fancy. This restaurant has nice big bar with nice seating arrangement for drink and dinner. Ambience is good.My friend suggested this place for drinks since it's Hoboken decided to try. We were greeted with smile and upon asking got nice booth. The place was not crowded around 7:30pm so no need to be worried about getting a table, place is huge.We ordered couple of drinks and something to much on.Beers, mojito, sangria and some other things. I did not like mojito but watermelon sangria was defiantly  worth every sip! Food we ordered fish and chips, the fish was tasty but under seasoned.. I had to put salt on top of it.The french fries which came along with it was yum! I loved it.Spinach and artichoke dip was ok, it was not the way I expected. I could barely taste artichoke so it's not for me. It was tasty but missing artichoke was low for me.Over all food I will rate 3.5/4Ambience: 4/5Service 3.5/5After an hour or so we were handed the bill and we were just getting started. Apparently the server's shift was about to get over so she wanted us to pay for the food, which was low scorer for me. She gave good service but it's irritating when you see eyes pointing at you to pay the bill before the food is finished. We paid but that still nag me somehow.
2018-10-22,1,I've been here probably half a dozen times and only once had a not-terrible experience. I kept going back because it's very convenient but increasingly realized it's a waste.At first it was just because of weak drinks and generally bad service. The one time I had a solid experience was because there were almost no other patrons and I was ordering wine--impossible to make weak--and the bartender was nice.Repeatedly weak drinks are enough to prompt walking down the street to one of the many other bars. But rudeness is another matter. That's what prompted a review making their bad behavior public. Normally I wouldn't bother.Wicked wolf, I'm going to spare you the embarrassment of making the full story public. But don't literally turn the lights off without warning on people paying good money. You could have some common courtesy. I've lived here many years and only once experienced such rudeness and that was at a hot spot in manhattan. There are too many other spots to grab a drink--not worth it.
2018-09-23,1,They stink, wicked wolf? Wicked kitten!  Food gave me diarrhea for 3 months.  Don't get the liquor there it's not real.  They stink.  Bad.  Real bad.
2018-08-23,4,Popped in for drink before dinner.  Good energy,friendly staff, outdoor seating ...  and it was happy hour pricing!We were seated quickly & had tasty drinks in hand in no time.Didn't order any grub due to having dinner elsewhere, I'll have to return & enjoy some grub & then update this review.
2018-08-19,4,Went because we had a gift certificate.  Place has lots of t.v.s ..great for games. I had fish and chips that were EXCELLENT with some of the best fries in town. Great beer selection and friendly knowledgable waitress. Would definitely return.
2018-08-11,1,If i could rate as a ZERO, i would. The bar tenders messed  up drinks all night long. Along with later in the night after I wanted to pay, they informed me that one of rhem gave my debit card to a complete stranger....absolutely garbage never would I recommend this place.
2018-08-05,5,5 Star customer service! Hugh the manager is a stand up accommodating guy! He was so sweet and willing to help us with an issue we had.
2018-08-01,4,The ribs and drinks are awesome. Service wasn't that friendly but maybe the server was having an off day. I'll b back!
2018-07-31,2,slow service, food is just okay and they added 20% gratuity to our bill for a table of 3 during happy hour as well-suspect it was so we wouldnt give our slow waitress a crappy tip. To top it off I ended up with food poisoning the morning after I ate here. My friends who ate here were fine but this was the last thing I ate before I landed in the hospital. Won't be returning
2018-07-27,3,The food is alright, general pub food. What was not alright was our bill. Not only was there a service fee, there was also a 20% gratuity added, and we were a table of three. It's possible it's because we were there during happy hour and they're worried about people not tipping? It was absolutely ridiculous. They also charged us $6 for liquor that we did not order. A friend was paying, so they didn't fight the bill, if it was me, the server wp uld have had some explaining to do.
2018-07-23,5,THE VIEW.  Came here after getting my hair cut a few blocks away by a salon that my friend works at and decided to grab a quick drink before heading home.  The bar itself is pretty nice and a great seasonal beer list, but that view!  Will definitely be back for that NYC skyline view!
2018-07-10,1,WICKEDLY TERRIBLE SERVICE. Cliff's notes: A 20% gratuity is automatically added if the bill is $50 or more, so providing excellent service seems to be of no concern. This fact is not clearly communicated on there signage/menu.The long story: I went for a bite with 3 other adults and a child around 3:30/4 on a weekday, so it wasn't too crowded. First thing I noticed was the irony that there was a sign on the door saying that shirts and shoes had to be worn in order to be served and no bad attitudes were permitted, yet each staff person we came across seemed more miserable than the last. We were seated fairly quickly and when we said we needed a minute to order, our server went missing in action for what felt like a lifetime. Maybe it was because we were so hungry, but the food was not as delicious as it sounded like it would be from reading the menu. We needed ketchup to eat burgers and fries and had to ask 3 people and wait close to 15 minutes to get a tiny container that wasn't enough for one person - let alone the group - and by then the food was no longer hot. We got the bill when the server just dropped it and walked on by without acknowledging us or asking if we needed anything else. And mind you, we are a nice group of folks who - even though we were thoroughly disappointed by the service - did not act like it. We continued to be respectful and friendly. We opened the bill and noticed there was a 20% gratuity added automatically. The menu said that would be added to parties of 6 or more, so when we inquired, we were told that a 20% gratuity is also automatically added when the bill is $50 or more. We had never heard of such a policy. For a bar/restaurant where it's so easy to rack up a $50 bill? That's when we realized that if this is their policy, no wonder the servers don't care-they're getting a healthy tip no matter what. I plan to speak to a manager (who wasn't available when we were on our way out and the staff person we were speaking with (not rudely) wasn't interested in helping us talk to him). What a disappointment. I wouldn't go back there if the food was amazing - or free.
2018-07-07,1,Food was good but our server alone ruined our lunch. She was very unattentive and sat us at dirty table. Not to mention, 20% was automatically added to our check considering we were a party of two. Definitely not going back.
2018-07-05,2,Service was really bad. This is a place to only go get a drink, not to sit down and have a meal. Food was also cold when it came out to the table.
2018-06-28,3,Today I went to have lunch at this place with my family, party of 9, before I get to the bad I do want to commend Angie who beyond all this crap, did deliver excellent service.. To start, a blonde waitress who we asked where we could sit said "idk I'm leaving" we tried putting tables together since we're a big party and another brunette waitress came at us shaking her head saying no no you can't do that (mind you we were not in the way of anything) we were finally seated. It wasn't packed yet it took a while to get our food, while eating it started pouring rain, we asked the bouncer if we could take our food inside he responded by saying "no", when we rebutted with it's raining he said "I don't care, I don't know what to tell you", I was shocked to hear this as I am a paying customer. The rain got harder so We ran inside food in hand, this bouncer proceeded to insult the men in our group. We brought this to the managers attention and he compensated us for the inconvenience, but the the beginning experience ultimately ruined the rest of our time there.
2018-06-28,3,So this restaurant is good food wise and it's nice inside and out but the security guard that was outside was super rude since we got there. He asked for id's with an attitude for no reason. We sat outside to enjoy our food in the hot weather when out of nowhere it started to rain and our food was getting soaked, so we asked him if we can take our food inside to finish eating and he said no, so we asked what do we do then since our food is getting soaked he said he didn't care but that we couldn't go in. We went inside anyway because were paying for food and we're going to eat it. But long story short he was super rude from the start for no reason and it just made the experience suck, Long story short the restaurant was nice and food was good but we didn't get to enjoy our experience because of him.
2018-06-25,3,Stopped by this place overlooking the pier. The food is pretty good, not the best, but pretty good. We had the nachos which really filled us up but they were kind of dry. I had the southern chicken and broccoli which was pretty good but to be honest it was really oily. My friend got the Spicy penne a la vodka which was not spicy at all. It was actually really good! Both the pastas came with bread. The portions are big so you do get your money's worth.
2018-05-25,5,Outstanding location on Sinatra Drive overlooking Manhattan. Great for people watching!  They have the best happy hour in Hoboken. Great appetizers, beer and wine specials. It gets crowded but service is very good. Waiters work as a team and all try to help each other providing a great customer experience. I heard their ribs are excellent. We will try them next time.
2018-05-24,1,It's def traditional. If you live in the 1950s south. We walked in and waited waited and got looks and finally sat down to some nasty food. Don't bother to go in unless you want bad service and bad food.
2018-05-23,1,Food is good but the service is terrible. Ordered for delivery Wednesday night may 23rd at 725pm. We were told it would be delivered at 8:15 and hen received an email changing that to between 8:25-8:35. Understandable at things happen-certainly not deplorable. But THEN Upon calling at 8:45 to check to see when it was sent out and if it was being delivered soon, the female employee who answered the phone to check on the order was unbelievably rude and refused to provide us with information. She said she has no idea and not her problem. So if you want food delivered in any reasonable time frame  and any sort of friendly staff or assistance when you would like to check on the status of your order this is not the place. I have NEVER left a negative review but this place and this employee were so horrible that I am making it a mission to let everyone in Hoboken know not to ever order from here ever again. Customer service is everything and wicked wolf tavern should let their staff know that.
2018-03-26,2,Over rated - Food fair at best - Under cooked , sandwich's under par, to load up a plate with fries doesn't hide the fact that the sandwiches were lousy. Drinks were just ok. Wont be back - can do much better in Hoboken for good food and drinks.
2018-03-07,4,Went to this place on Valentine's Day this year to enjoy some good brunch overlooking the New York City skyline with a friend. We ordered a plate fully loaded Nachos and a plate of Red Pepper Hummus and Pita. For drinks we ordered two portions of Watermelon Sangria. The quantity of both Nachos and Hummus plate was pretty good. The Nachos tastes good at the start but tend to dry out if kept for long. Red pepper hummus was amazing. Watermelon Sangria's were absolutely refreshing and perfect for a day time outing. The service was very prompt and the staff was extremely friendly. Would definitely recommend this place.
2018-02-27,2,Came here with a group of 12 since our office is next door. Our food took a long time to arrive (despite being wraps, salads, etc). I would say 5/12 got incorrect orders and 2/12 had hair in their food. The food overall was subpar even for generic pub food. When we tried to express our frustrations to the waiter he half listened and then walked away mid-sentence.The manager was apologetic and took some stuff off the bill which was appreciated. I wouldn't come back for food, but seemed like a good spot for a drink, a sports game (lots of tvs) and the water view.
2018-02-21,1,DO NOT COME HERE if you plan on having drinks. Beer maybe but not mixed drinks. I came here with a girl, and we collectively had 6 drinks (3 each) and the bill came out to $100. That is equivalent to $16.50 a drink. Not worth it when there are so many other spots in Hoboken that serve the exact same drinks for less.
2018-01-13,5,I guess doing #2 has a new meaning for Jairo. You know what you were doing, don't play the victim.
2018-01-12,1,Bouncer in the bathroom kicks the stall doors in. I was in the middle off doing my business..he grabbed me and dragged me out. Worst experience of my life, never coming back
2018-01-09,2,On November 19th my friend lost her wallet at Wicked Wolf. We didn't notice till about 11:30pm and we were already home. We called later that evening/ early morning at around 2am (when the bar was closed) and there was no sign of it. The very next day, we made another trip out to Wicked Wolf to check to see if we could find it in the bar and there was no sign of it. We continuously called in the beginning of December, mid December and at the end of December and there was no sign of the wallet. On January 8th she received a Facebook message from the bar saying they found her wallet (of course without cash). We were incredibly annoyed by the situation because 1) we were told the bar had been checked and the wallet wasn't there multiple times (our guess is someone put it in a back office or something) 2) for whatever reason staff clearly overlooked the wallet 3) when we spoke to the manager he was very nonchalant and dismissive when we explained to him we've been calling for over a month and staff told us the wallet wasn't there. Obviously, things like this happen in the bar scene but please put forth alittle more effort when someone calls saying they lost an important item, instead of reaching out to them months later saying the item is found.
2018-01-05,3,I did not like this place. It is expensive , which is fine. Whats not fine is the staff. Some are really rude and the others who are not so rude are not friendly. This is my personal opinion. I wont go there again.
2018-01-01,4,Spent New Years Eve at the Wolf. They threw a great party, staff was super friendly. The buffet was great, fresh salad And standard Italian fare.I've been here before for Happy Hour and enjoyed the vibe, New years didn't disappoint!
2017-12-29,5,Fantastic service, great atmosphere, perfect view of New York skyline from table, lots of tvs for game watching, lots of options on menu, and most importantly food was delicious!  Great value for the $ - reasonably priced as well!
2017-12-19,5,I come In for happy hour while my husband finishes up at the office. Haven't had a bad experience service wise. I've tried a few of their happy hour apps so far the buffalo bites are my fave. We came by when the weather was warmer with my dog and they accommodated us on the outside patio. Our server even brought my dog some water. I haven't tried any of the main food item but my husband didn't like the enchiladas he tried last time. It does get busy after work . We came on a Thursday around 7/8 and it was packed, we had a party of 8 and the hostess still accommodated us. The waitress was attentive and was nice enough to split checks.
2017-11-29,2,Everything was amazing here, EXCEPT our bartender Tatiana. We came on Wednesday night around 8:30-9pm, she was snobby and rude. The atmosphere was amazing ! Trivia night with Beaver as the host was fun for a group of people but it all crumbled after the horrible service we received and attitude we got. Might be skeptical about coming back.
2017-11-17,1,So, wicked wolf texts me for a "birthday package" invite your friends for a good deal. I got there a little later than my friends and there was a long line that wasn't moving. The bouncer told me if there are 20 people under your name that checked in we will let you in, I only had 15. Thank me for your business and my happy birthday, wicked wolf. You guys are honestly the worst never giving you my business again.
2017-11-16,1,Great spot to have a drink right by the water... but they don't fill the drink all the way to the top... Server Ashley R. was HORRIBLE !!!!! Did not check back or care at all.
2017-10-31,3,Good place, decent crow, could go there to watch a football game with friends.But both the times I went, the beer wasn't cold and I find it a bit pricey as well. Best part is its proximity to PATH station. Overall a decent place to chill with friends.
2017-10-31,4,Only rating on the Halloween night that I went to last weekend.  Crowd was fun ... both for the football crowd and the masquerade contest part of the evening.  We got nachos, wings, spinach artichoke dip, chicken fingers, maybe a few other things and it was good bar food.  Our waiter was great, very attentive to our large party in a large crowded bar.  Drinks were also good.  I don't go out in Hoboken that often anymore but thought Wicked Wolf is a great place to catch a game and a meal.
2017-10-26,2,Only came here for a couple hours for a work happy hour which for a couple hours wasn't a bad selection of items. But this place doesn't really have a wow-factor. Good for a couple beers after work and basic bar food. It's a great view of the NY skyline and Empire State from this place though!
2017-10-25,5,Came here for the famous Football Sunday and it didn't disappoint! For a day that had a Jets-Pats game I expected it to be crazy but they manage the crowd really well. We got there around 11:30 and there was only a small line (they only open at 11). $10 at the door and they give you a ticket you can trade in for a shirt, a hat, or a shot. So in the end at least you're getting something with the cover! Beer towers and drink deals were good, and for a crowded place the servers were very quick, attentive, and friendly! Obviously they are pros at this by now. I've also come weekend nights here and I do enjoy it especially since it's one of the only places that have good drink/beer specials even on the weekends. The DJ is usually playing a great mix of music for everyone to enjoy and dance to!
2017-10-21,5,Server Michelle has great butt. Also great service and a wicked personality. Get the spinach dip.
2017-10-19,2,Ugh, I liked the place until I realized my friends and I ended up double tipping the bartender. It was my first time there, so I didn't know how much drinks cost on average here. I didn't realize until I saw the itemized receipt long after we left that she added gratuity ($13) and my friend still gave extra $20 cash. If she let us know gratuity was included then I wouldn't be ranting about this. Just not a fan of grimy servers/bartenders, especially when I am part of this industry. Lesson learned: always check the bill (something I never really needed to do).
2017-10-08,1,Stood on line for over an hour. Decided as soon as we were up to go in that they were going to charge a cover. We watched 50+ people leave. So embarrassing. Will NEVER return. Security was too busy flirting with the underage girls.
2017-10-06,4,Great spot to catch a game or two.  The staff is friendly.  I wish they had more specials.
2017-10-04,1,Ordered a Guinness tower.It appeared to be diluted with one gallon of water. Ordered a few burgers and panini. They were good.American nachos had hardly one packet of small Doritos. The basket was 2/3rd empty. Overall 1 star. Would never return !!
2017-10-03,1,I came here for glass of wine and l wish we were never here ! My 14 months old boy is just walking , one of their waitress(?with dark pony tail) warn me with a very loud voice and she said they're runing around and he shouldn't be around  which is weird! I'd speak to manager and told him l don't like her voice and he told me the place aint a babygym or something ! So , when l go to a bar day time l know it's bot a babygym and you have to be more friendly to your customers! Never go there again !
2017-09-16,3,Came here on a late night. Got the wings & beer during their happy hour time. Wings were solid & got a tower of beer. If you want a quick happy Hour spot to get liquor & food then go here. It is right by the water so if you sit outside you have a nice view
2017-09-10,3,This place is huge!  That's not surprising considering it's proximity to the PATH station.Came here for drinks before heading back to NYC.  We had good service, but I agree that the drinks are a bit overpriced.There are a TON of TVs, so this is probably a great place to watch whatever sports you're into.The crowd skews pretty young.  The vibe reminded me of frat bars across the country, which isn't a sin; just know what you're in for.
2017-08-19,4,Good food. Good beer deals. Either $4 or $5 usual drafts (corona, modelo, etc). We took advantage of the bucket (includes 5 beers) and killed 2. Service was good, waitress was nice and attentive. Right on the water, so you're getting views. Had the sliders and fries was satisfied, friend had a wrap and she was too. Would return.
2017-08-06,1,I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE! I will never recommend this bar to anyone. I used to have a good time here but this Saturday, while celebrating my brother's birthday, we were treated HORRIBLY. The service was awful with bartenders that were clearly not well trained and not experienced with how to efficiently serve a busy bar. It took FOREVER for the women in the party to get drinks, from the female bartender. My sister had her tab open and when she went to close it at bar closing she had a ridiculous tab with drinks that she did not order. The bartender claimed that people in our group put them on her tab. Even if that was the case, WHICH IT WAS NOT because these were our closest friends, some of the drinks NO ONE ON OUR SIDE OF THE BAR ordered. I don't drink and was 100% sober, therefore I am CERTAIN that no one anywhere in our vicinity ordered some of the drinks that wound up on my sister's tab. My sister, who was drinking but by no means drunk, attempted to talk to the bartender and then the manager with no resolve. To make matters worse, when our friend tried to help my sister, calling the bartender "ma'am" and trying to calm the situation, the bartenders became extremely aggressive and confrontational subsequently, kicking him out. To further add insult to injury, the bartender told my sister she should "keep better company". We have a diverse group of wonderful friends. We were spending a large amount of money and  not causing any trouble at all yet my poor sister and our friends were treated with no respect or courtesy at all. This was not the way my brother wanted to end his birthday nor the way my sister wanted to end her night. Wicked Wolf essentially tried to con my sister out of money and even if this was other random patrons putting drinks on her tab the staff should have been more knowledgeable of how to rectify this situation. Terrible establishment.
2017-07-31,4,Best happy hour specials!! Beer, wine, and well drinks are 3 bucks each and they have an awesome food menu with 5 dollar appetizers.  My favorite is the fried pickles (ahh-so yummy!)  but you can also get wings, pretzel sticks, chips and dip, mozzarella sticks, etc.  What's even better is that it's located on the water, so if it's nice out you can enjoy a (slightly) more relaxing side of Hoboken.  I've only had a few of the wraps from the regular menu (my favorite is the Popeye), which are also super affordable and delicious.  Definitely one of our go-to's in Hoboken!
2017-07-20,1,Terrible experience. They cannot pour a drink that costs $32. Pours drink and ends up table and floor causing a small puddle. Being seated was instant. Getting a server.... Good luck. You better have your walking shoes because your going to have to find them. And when they finally arrive you better have your order because those menus are gonna get snatched as if they were the only ones in the restaurant. Completely clueless server. Asked for a manager..... He was the one that poured the drink!! M. Night Shyamalan Plot Twist ending.
2017-07-07,1,I went here last weekend with a few friends when the bill came we broke up the check I was only suppose to pay $25 mean while the other picked up the rest of the check. Well I look at my bank account this morning I was charged for $170 ! I contact my friend who picked up his half he was charged 145 as well ?! I signed for $25 now how is that possible ?! It was dead as well so a mistake like that is pretty impossible to make. The service is a JOKE ! I had called to speak to a manager at 11:30 they had me on hold for 20 mins, I hung up and called back I was told the managers were all busy. As a manager with a issue like this wouldn't you take 5 mins to deal with a situation like this? I was told they would call me back at 3 we'll I decided to call back at 4 since I didn't hear anything the manager took my info and told me they would call me back finally the issue was fixed supposedly the server messed up I think they need new staff or better training.
2017-06-11,3,Pros: Outdoor seating with a beautiful viewMusic isn't too loud if you are outsideDecent priced food Good drink choices Located across the street from the waterfront Big TV inside to watch sports onCons: Slow serviceExpensive drinks Loud music when seated inside More of a club/dance feel than a restaurant Food is not great. - I had the herb crusted salmon. It came out too hot to eat. Not very flavorful. The rice was horrible. My experience: Arrived at 5:30pm on Sunday, didn't have to be seated outside. It took about 10 mins before I was asked if I wanted anything to drink. I had to request a water along with my drink. The table next to me was seated after me and their order was taken before mine. The waitress walked past me to go to their table. It wasn't like their table was conveniently located before mine. Lucky for them I wasn't in a hurry. Outside was actually really nice. Other than the service sucking, it is exactly what I was looking for.
2017-06-10,1,Last time I was here I spent over $300. I won an "open bar" and when I called to confirm the guy who picked up was "weeding out cheap people" after i told him I had invited 25 people. He didnt care. Treated with disrespect and dismissed. No need to spend time at an establishment that doesnt appreciate its paying customers.
2017-06-01,5,Was there tonight for the NBA finals....I knew going in this was the premiere place in Hoboken to watch a game...Thats why my friends and I decided to meet there....But the place is much more than that....We decided to order some food while we were watching the game...WOW!! The wings were the best I've ever had...The sliders were tremendous!!! Will be back soon and often....Great job!!!!!
2017-05-29,1,2 stars for the food - it's not good, but the service is horrible.  Don't bother with this place.  It's just another sports bar, just lesser quality than most.
2017-05-24,1,Don't go to trivia night. Manager says you can use trivia winnings towards bill and then changes his mind. Go to Marty O'Briens instead ;)
2017-05-14,4,One of the better bars in Hoboken. Bartenders are friendly, there are unlimited TVs, and sometimes they have fun games going on. It's also right by the waterfront with a great view of the NYC skyline. I tried the red sangria and it was suuuuuper delicious. Prolly one of the best sangrias I've ever had. Didn't get to try the food because we ate before hand. We missed happy hour by like 3 minutes. Happy Hour goes from 4PM-7PM on Friday with $5 apps & $3 wine, well drinks, and draft beer. Can't beat it. They also have trivia on Wednesday's and other specials going on every day of the week including $.50c wings, brunch, and other stuff depending on what day. Your best bet is to check their website. If I lived in Hoboken I would be here all of the time! Cheers!
2017-05-08,4,We came on a Sunday afternoon, and it didn't feel like it! Great Dj! Decent drink prices!
2017-04-28,4,Fun trivia night on Wednesday nights and a good bar vibe.  It can be a little hard to understand the DJ from the bar, though, so if you're serious about trivia I definitely recommend getting there a little early to claim a table up closer.  Unfortunately I haven't yet had the chance to sample the food but my friend tried one of their burgers and didn't speak to me for the next 10 minutes while he dove into it, so I'm assuming that's a pretty good thing!
2017-04-24,5,Love Wicked Wolf for big games, when there's alot of energy. Also a great spot to sit on the water for a good meal - delicious wings! If you're not feeling social, the delivery is super fast and tasty.
2017-04-13,1,Went to Wicked wolf for my friend who graduated from her masters degree at Columbia, the food and drinks were great! We were having a great time. However, towards the end of the night we went to the bathroom together and as weWe're leaving the bathroom we were accused of doing cocaine in the bathroom, the bouncers immediately told us we had to leave and asked us why we went into the same stall. ( hello girls go in the same stall all the time ) I just feel so disrespected. I actually liked coming here and now I just feel so disrespected after being accused of doing a drug that I have never touched. On the way out the bouncer even made some remark about the way I was sniffling. I am just appalled and taken back by the way I was treated.  Never retuning to this bar. The food and drinks were okayy but the way I was treated was appalling.
2017-04-11,1,1. Food was good 2. Service was horrible....waiter forgot to take our orders. 3. We had to ask 3x for utensils. 4. Forgot my friends order to go. 5. Had to wait another 15mins for the check. I would not return.....despite the great view.
2017-04-01,1,I came here with my girlfriend who had the weekend promotion for discount drinks. I ordered 4 beers and 3 mixed drinks which should hav3 been 32 bucks and not 37 dollars. This is obscured and a stupid deal if that's the case. I came for the promotion, not the full price
2017-03-29,1,I have no words to explain how bad this place is. 3 of us went in the evening at 7 to just catch up over a couple of drinks. They had a quiz contest going on... they were shouting in the microphone and all anyone could hear was their stupid quiz. We felt like we were back in some classroom! No conversations possible. We left after a drink, never going back here
2017-03-11,1,Absolute white trash quality service. When I asked to close my tab, the gentleman who said he would take care of it, spent the next half hour serving other customers. When I grabbed another bartender to close my tab, the original bartender had the audacity to cop an attitude to me for asking another bartender to close my tab.Do not give your money to this place. Loud drunk white girl anthems are on repeat here and th bartenders are just as miserable as you will be if you come here.
2017-02-25,5,So I'm really surprised with the reviews here. I'm giving 5 stars for service and food. I had the onion soup - big and delicious, the fried pickles - love it and the veggie burger with avocado and sweet potato French fries. Wow! Tasty!
2017-02-05,1,Literally got kicked out for not leaving a big enough tip... sorry didn't realize 15% for a different bartender was not  enough... thanks for the extortion... keep bartending and I'll keep doing something with my life
2016-12-14,1,I downloaded the Yelp app just to write this review. Beware, do not use the coat check at the Wicked Wolf. You will have things stolen as did happen to me. Not only did someone take my gloves, likely an employee, when I called to voice my concerns to the manager, I was told it was my fault and had probably fumbled around and dropped them out of both of my pockets. I was not even drinking. It's just unfortunate as I wouldn't have paid for a coat check had I known my gloves would be stolen. So please be aware and do not lose any of your items to this coat check.
2016-11-20,1,Says on yelp closes at 2 a.m. We where there this evening getting kicked out at 930 pm. After our waitress just asked us for a another round and we didn't even drink our beers. The bouncers where walking around and telling fellow customers we have to leave! Starting putting up the chairs in the surrounding tables.Not sure how the waitress didn't know what time they closed when she asked us for a bother round, or to even be told before we ordered. Never ever have I been kicked out of a bar like this before with a full beer, not to mention there was 4 minutes in the ranger game left! I never heard of a sports bar in Hoboken closing at this time! Won't be going back that's for sure!
2016-11-20,2,Been here a few times since I moved to Hoboken. Never a place that I'd overly loved or disliked but I've always had a pretty good time here. Today though was just strange. No issues with the service as our server was very nice and attentive. What was super strange was when I was there watching the Ranger game (and SNF was also on with fans of their respective teams in attendance, and for a bar that's supposed to close at 2am on Sunday), decides at 9:30 PM that hey everyone needs to go, is just strange. Most of us had just been poured fresh drinks. I've never been kicked out of a bar/restaurant like that. The whole thing was just weird and unprofessional all around.  Would love an explanation for that.  To add context, there was about two minutes left in a tied Ranger game and an entire half of SNF to go.
2016-11-19,1,This place had terrible service. The manager was very rude and unprofessional, we kindly asked to put a game on the tv that was closest to the table that we were sitting at and he began to swear and curse about how much more important the college football game was over the real madrid soccer final. The manager really killed the atmosphere and the service was bad. Ihad a terrible experience. I do not plan ok coming back again and i do not recommend it to anybody else.
2016-11-13,1,#Wolfknows of and Continues to Retain and Support Abusive Bartender/Server Jesse CTeaser: A consolation burger that found itself @the bottom of a toilet, Jesse, an angry bartender who mercilessly degrades a woman, mocking+reducing her to tears & Hugh, a sweet well-meaning manager who regularly attends customer service workshops. The meat is 3 ¶'s downNov 9, 2016 @6:40PM, walked into Wicked Wolf Hoboken on a quiet night for a much needed pre-gym hot meal. Left an hour later scarred by intolerance, humiliation, degradation+dehumanization @hands o/Jesse C, @wwolfhoboken bartender/serverFairly slow night, post election, Jesse, bartender/server, saw me, didn't want to serve me. Only reluctantly came over when, after waiting, I waved hello to catch his attention. Even smiled & said hi. Wouldn't even serve me water, @first I thought he forgot. It became painfully clear when I ordered my food (turkey burger+side salad) that this was more7:15 Beginning to wonder where my food was? Bill, yes. Jesse sure dropped that off fast. Food, not so much. "Excuse me" as Jesse walked by, scowling. ~10 min earlier a bag was@/end o/bar. Couldn't be mine? I was staying. Even explained upon arrival I needed to leave in a half hour &if that would work. I clarified "It is for here, right?" So it began:"That's not what u said." "Excuse me?" "U said it was 2go." "I'm sorry, I'm certain I didn't say that." "Yes U did!" @this point, Jesse was getting aggressive &I nervous+scared. "To be fair, I didn't specify if it was here or 2go, but also, you never asked, it's not a big deal." "No, that's not what you said." Stunned. Frozen. He spoke to me like I was less than human, not worthy o/his time, time I tip for, or food, food I pay for. "There's a bag that's been @the end o/the bar for a while, is that it?" He then dumped the contents onto a plate &put it in front o/me. Was shocked. "Excuse me, but you're being very mean to me. Is there something I did to upset you?" "You ordered it to go!" Jesse barked. I said, "Listen, I'm a paying customer that wants to have dinner, I'm already running late&my food is cold."  ::sneer:: I swear to God almighty, he sneered&looked@me like he wanted to HIT me. The look of HATE is a haunting one. Reply: IT'S WARM!  I touched it, it was clearly congealed, "Come on, it's cold." He put his hand over my food and growled: IT'S WARM. ::sneer::  "What do u want me to do about it?" The attitude was unbelievable.  "I mean... It's cold, how long will it take to prepare a fresh one?"  He didn't answer the question. This person was so angry and hateful; it took a lot of courage to say something, because he has undoubtedly done this before. "I'm really sorry, I'm having a very hard time understanding why ur being so mean to me. Ur being very hurtful, I don't understand."  "YOU walked in with a problem," Jesse barked, hateful, aggressive, "I knew there was something wrong with YOU as soon as I saw YOU. And I never usually tell customers that. And the way YOU called me over." Illustrated by a boorish animal-like gestureStunned, frozen, & explaining myself as if Jesse were behaving rationally."I just waved (even smiled) to get your attn. I was waiting a while. I'm so sorry if it came across as rude" Absurd, I apologized? He refused to look @me. Argued/insulted/put me down. The Wicked Wolf employee who plate dumped. Even if ordered 2go, this employee had ZERO interest in serving me. Prior to the replacement arriving asked "Can I please (yes I said please) keep it 2eat salad, I'm so hungry." Shoves it back. Jesse then appeared to complain to someone. I still don't know what he did to my foodFinally had the strength to say "U don't need to be so mean to me. I don't understand where this is coming from." He looked @me w/rage+malice & COMMANDED me, a paying customer, "EAT YOUR FOOD BEFORE IT GETS COLD!" Why not just throw it on the floor&tell me 2eat it like a dog? As if I too were raised by wolves? Except, not the cool kind o/wolf that howls @the moon @all the right times, this was rabies bitten rabid walking dead zombie wolf. Could barley chew. Looked @hostess podium, hoping to catch someone's eye for help. I was all alone. Jesse then dropped another bill in front of meHugh, Jesse's Mgr. Sweet, tall, quite lovely, apologized for his employee "This meal is on me." "Wow, in that case, this is the worst date I've ever had." A $13 bgr was of 0 consolation. Sobbed the moment he came over, & he sent me out that way. My trainer consoled me, lost his business that night because o/Jesse. Mgmt has proven difficult to reach. Rec'd inconsistent replies to multiple inquiries by Will (assist. mgr whose name was incorrectly given when called to verify Jesse's name) +staff. Appears neglect was what it took for Mgmt to take this seriously. Until such time this matter is resolved, it appears WW Mgmt is in active supportive of hateful, disparaging, humiliating and degrading treatment of their customers, as those enacted by Jesse C
2016-07-15,1,Average at best. One star assuming the food doesn't end up making me sick. Flavorless French fries & onion rings soaked in grease. Should have gone to the food truck across the street.
2016-07-14,5,Great spot in Hoboken with delicious food! It is located right on the water which makes it a perfect spot for a nice summer day! Also, Most of the time they have really good specials too! FAVORITE ITEMS:Southwest Steak SandwichSteak tipsSalmon saladCalifornia chicken sandwich WingsIt is also the best bar in Hoboken for football Sunday's!!!
2016-07-09,1,The food and wait staff was awesome. This review is simply to highlight that the management was not customer friendly. There was miscommunication with the amount our brunch should be. We believed it was 35 for drinks and food. We ended up getting a bill for our food afterwards. Confused, we asked for an explanation. Unfortunately, the manager came in hot ready to battle and didn't take a moment to just discuss the situation. At the end of the day, it was just handled badly and shockingly strange. The price of the food was not the problem. Just can't believe we paid $35 for orange juice and champagne ( you know, that amazing kind that gives you a headache ;) )
2016-07-09,1,Sooooo shady. The brunch special was not communicated over the phone and in person. My group was told we were having unlimited drinks and an entree for a set amount of $35 per person. This is common as a brunch special so we thought everything was good. When we arrived, we were again told that we can have one entree of the menu and drinks. At the end, they brought us a separate bill for the food and told us the food wasn't included. When we brought it up, the woman who spoke to us over the phone gave us so much attitude and blamed us "not understanding." When we asked to speak to the manager, he also was extremely rude and told us that he didn't care "what Manhattan did" and that we drank a lot, even though we spoke to him courteously. Then he took the drinks that we still had on the table and already had paid for. He then proceeded to yell at us as we left. Manager has no class and no management skills. This place is totally unprofessional and we could have gone to various other places that aren't shady. Place was empty anyway, you'd think they would try to work toward keeping customers. Never again. This place will probably be out of business soon anyway.
2016-07-02,1,Beware of the drink specials! I went with some friends for 4th of July weekend and we ordered two drinks off their list of four advertised as $5 and they ended up charging us $20 for each for a "smoke show". The waitress didn't warn us about it despite us mentioning being excited about the special. When we approached the manager about it he was no help citing the size of the drink as a reason for us to realize it would a different price despite nothing being on the menu. DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU WANT A WAITSTAFF THAT CARES ABOUT YOUR DINING EXPERIENCE! I will not be coming backEdit: upon reviewing our checks we realized the drinks were in fact $25 dollars each. To repeat my point, the waitstaff does not care about you
2016-06-25,3,THIS PLACE IS VERY LOUD! It's a good place to grab drinks and watch a sweet game or match on their many TVs. Not really my scene, but we watched an awesome UFC female fight! Crazy stuff.
2016-06-21,3,Sports bar, rough crowd.  Wanted to get some food and watch the NBA playoffs. managed to get in before 11 and they let us order food quick.  I got the Frickles ( fried pickles) Loved them and the  Russian sandwich and sweet potato fries.  which were was surprisingly really really good.   I did not like the crowd, it was a bit rough and tumble on a thirsty thursday night, the bathroom was kinda gross because of the volume.  Also, the doorman tried to card me when I walked in.....well , I know my companions were in their late 20's so I get that, but not me, I just had to tell the guy ,'are you f'ing serious yo'  and he said 'man just go ahead'      I've got a half grey hair goatee   get outta here with that show me your ID nonsense
2016-06-12,2,I went to the Wicked Wolf with a friend for brunch and was not impressed. I ordered the watermelon sangria and expected it to be a red sangria (since watermelon is red) but it came with white wine. On top of that it was watery and didn't actually include watermelon pieces. Instead there were tiny pieces of pears and apples. My friend's wild berry sangria was okay. She ordered the breakfast wrap and while it was filling the sausage tasted odd. It was nothing you can't make at home. My Benedict burger was really good expect that the waitress brought me the wrong food. She brought out a regular egg's Benedict instead of the burger. So while my best friend was eating I was just sipping my watery sangria and picking at her tater tots. In total our meal came out to $40 and we didn't feel that it was worth it. The music was really loud which made it difficult to have a conversation. I know that at night it turns into a sports bar out at 1 in the afternoon there is no need to have music so loud that my I had to keep repeating what I was saying.
2016-05-25,2,Don't get the wild berry sangria, it's watered down and not good also. Also my girlfriend had the harvest salad and it tasted very grainy and the peaches don't taste fresh. They also barely give any chicken with it. I had the fish tacos which were mediocre at best. Find a better spot
2016-05-19,2,$5 appetizers during happy hour is great, but the service here is so terrible that I'd rather go to a different place all together.
2016-04-29,5,What a experience I had in wicked wolf last week! The bartender Celeste was extremely tentative poured a captivating Moscow mule made sure I left boozed but she also made sure I had ride . Had to tell her know it was my 1st Rodeo and they had bitters!
2016-04-20,3,If you're looking for frat boys, co-eds, and mozzy sticks, this is the place to be.
2016-03-12,1,Couldn't even get into the bar. The staff will not let you in if you are wearing Tims. You can wear fitteds, Converse, t-shirts, and other boots, but not Timberlands. Tried with two bouncers, and they wouldn't budge. Lame. Had to go across the street to another restaurant to get a drink. I wish I could rate this place zero stars but it won't let me.
2016-03-05,5,It's been a few weeks since all of us were at Wicked Wolf....  We went a few Sunday's ago for the Giants vs Jets game. The place was filled with energy and awesome sports fans.  We had amazing service and a delicious lunch.  The vibe of the game was like being at the Stadium and the DJ, would play incredible music on the commercial breaks. I want to thank Joe and Will for treating our group so well !   Was there today for the Leprechaun celebration. Great time, great party. Awesome music and vibe. Joe the GM TOOK great care if my friends and I.  We waited in line only for a few minutes !We will be back ASAP. To try BRUNCH !!
2016-02-29,4,This place seems like a busy Joey bro bar with shots on shots and bad haircuts. Luckily I went on a slow night and had some beers and food at the bar. Decent beer selection on tap. Bar menu was solid. If I lived in the city and did this city bar life stuff I would come here after work to throw a few back
2016-02-28,5,A Hoboken tradition! I have been to the wolf for all sorts of occasions. Alumni events, work post turkey bowl fun, and just plain football Sunday's. They staff always does a great job of handling the crowd and their wings are just delicious!! The line can get long on Sunday's, but it always seems to go quick. Definitely a place to stop if your in town!!
2016-02-26,4,Wednesday 9pm trivia nights here, with amazing prizes, are best with a few beer towers (around $16 each). Lots of seating but floors and tables can get a bit sticky later on, especially on Friday/Saturday nights when the whole place opens up with dancing and great music. By the waterfront!!!
2016-02-20,1,The people who work here only work here because they weren't able to do anything else with their lives. And because of that they are bitter assholes. Avoid this place at all costs
2016-02-11,1,This place stinks. The food was terrible. The chicken fingers were dry as a bone and had about a two inch layer of breading. The buffalo wings were dry and the sauce tasted bottled. The ribs had way too much sauce, were parboiled and had an aftertaste that would remind you of Bologna. The only good thing was the fish and chips and the service. I would equate the food to bad houlihans type food and again I apologize to houlihans. With all of the great food in Hoboken I don't know why anyone would eat in this place.
2016-02-06,5,Great lunch spot! We came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon, and it was totally dead- which was very nice :) I have heard this place can get a little crazy, as any sports bar/tavern can, and I appreciated the more laid-back, quiet atmosphere around noon on a weekend. The food was great- I sampled the wings and the steak sandwich, and had a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette, all of which I really enjoyed. I would definitely come back for more!
2016-02-05,2,Great location but the place is dirty.  The service was slow but the bartenders were friendly.  I won't be back again.
2016-01-24,1,Came here for Broncos Patriots game. Obnoxiously loud volume, couldn't even talk to the people at my table. Then the DJ blasted terrible EDM that no one likes during commercial breaks. Cool bro
2016-01-18,2,I went here this past Friday because they texted me and told me I won a contest. They said that I get to drink for free from 9pm-11pm and my friends get $4 mixed drinks and $2 domestic beers. So, I decided I'd start my birthday off here. I had asked if we could move the times to be 10pm-12am but they said no. So I told them that we would be there at 10pm. When we got there, there was a line and they wouldn't let us go in even though they'd lured us there with drink specials. They didn't let anyone in (despite a number of people leaving) until 10:50. This meant that by the time we even got to the bar, the special happy hour they promised would no longer apply. I texted the girl who told me I won this "prize" and she told me that they encourage people to get there by 9pm or earlier. Funny, no one encouraged me to do anything but come and spend money. This place seems to do well, I don't understand why they need to lie to people to get them to come in. I will most likely never go here again after being lied to like that.
2016-01-17,2,Drinks weren't balanced. Its like a sports bar when the name implies it's more divey. Meh. Not my type of place. Not intimate at all.
2016-01-15,1,One star for the fabulous bathroom attendant (Felicia) and convenient location. Aside from that the bartenders are truly inconsiderate and rude. There is nothing wrong with wanting respect from people who order from you but when you receive that and you continue to be rude it's completely uncalled for. On top of that there Friday DJ "Richie Rocks" continues to be stuck in the jersey shore MTV circa 2009. No one wants to listen to your poor attempts at trying to become a successful DJ, I too can sound an alarm and throw in some off beat loud sounds and call myself a DJ. On a scale of 1-10 a 0 for the bartenders, a 8 for location, a 2 for drinks, a 1 for the DJ, a 10 for the bathroom attendants and a 1 for desire to ever come back to this sad excuse of a competitive Hoboken bar.
2016-01-07,4,As a non-Hoboken resident, I can understand the temptation to stick to Washington St. with respect to bars since there are many more options there than on Sinatra Drive. As for sports bars, I usually find myself at Black Bear or 1 Republik, but the view at Wicked Wolf is worth a visit, especially if you're already down by the waterfront. I can't speak for the food, but I've always gotten decent service here and there are plenty of TVs to watch sports. If you're going for the night life, the music is usually pretty good and the place packs up.
2015-12-24,1,We usually go for lunch.  Today there was a team that the bar hired to install audio. One of the tech played a bad joke by blasting air horn from the speakers.  It was extremely loud and this person did this twice just to annoy customers there.  When we protested,  no one from the bar came forward to stop the silly joke or apologize to the customers.  It doesn't seem this place is well managed
2015-12-22,1,After paying a 10 dollar cover charge, I was thrown out after about 20 minutes. I was not told why I was being kicked out. I supposed it could have been because I was dozing off--because this POS establishment was empty and absolutely boring. Saturday night, and there was no one in there! Never going back here again. Still have bruises on my arms from how roughly the bounders handled me. I am disgusted with how I was treated. This place needs to get their shit together.
2015-12-08,3,Average in every sense of the word. Average people. Check. Average food. Check. Average service. Check. Average bar. Check. Average with a Capital A.
2015-12-08,4,Over the years I have heard quite a few good things about this place and it was a pleasure to finally have a chance to stop in with a friend and a few other Yelpers after an event!Overall, a pretty solid place.They are located right near the water and outside the establishment, is a pretty kick a** view of NYC. Absolutely stunning. Since it was a Monday night, the place did not have too many people inside, however, being the "old lady" I am, I really didn't mind that at all.The inside is pretty big. It had quite a few large flat screen TVs throughout the entire place. Pretty convenient, especially when watching a football game. Has quite a few seats at the bar, tables and even booths.I thought the five booths along the right hand side of the bar were pretty darn cool because each booth has its own personal mini TV. Bathrooms were nice and clean. In the bathroom they had a few posters on the wall with detailed descriptions on their happy hour and bar specials they have going on all week. Always good information to know! They even have a place in the back where a few people can charge their phones.The bartender serving us was very sweet and attentive (wish I got her name).The bar itself has a decent craft beer selection. Beer on tap was nice and cold and they also had a menu for food.My friend and I decided to split the turkey avocado wrap. Overall, it was pretty fresh (especially the avocado) and satisfying. The portion was pretty big, I was pretty full just from eating half of it. It also came with a bunch of crunchy skinny fries as well. I would definitely be happy go back again in the future!OH! And don't forget to "check in" when you get there! When you do, you are able to get 15% off for your food bill!
2015-11-20,1,$900 dollar bar tap for 5 people ... Check.Terrible service ..... Check. Server charged green tea shots as full Jameson shots....check.Skip this place.
2015-10-28,1,I must say service here sucks!!! We used to come here often as we work nearby. After work, me and some of my co-workers used to come here for couple of drinks. Had the worst experience ever. We ordered one round of drinks and some food and the server got us the order. However, after the first round was over,we waited for around 20-25 minutes but our server( a guy with a beard..be aware of him ) never returned. I called their phone number from the bar itself and asked the receiver to send our server to the table(it was a week-day and they were not busy at-all). A lady came to take our order after my phone call and she didn't even bother to apologize for the delay (no sign of our original server). After the second round of drinks were served by the lady, our original server showed up with a poker face and gave us some lame excuse. We were still okay but this was repeated again. Our server didn't show up again and we were forced to order our drinks to some other server.It was one really bad guy ( the guy with a beard ) that ruined my experience. I think I should think twice before coming to this place again if they decide to retain these kind of people. To my surprise, the other servers didn't try to make up for our server which I feel is pretty unprofessional and really unfortunate for us as customers as well.
2015-10-20,1,Went for football on Sunday with a bunch of friends. You have to wait in a line at 10:30 to get in--ok fine. Then the breakfast isn't even that good, but a decent Bloody Mary. ...the huge problem with this blast is the blaring am I mean blaring music at 11AM till 1PM games start--we tolerate that. But, the music during commercials and even volume of the Jets game too loud. Maybe I'm a bit older then the Millenials there. But, others seemed annoyed too, including the waitresses. Be nice to actually have a few drinks and a conversation---too friggin loud here and too many other good sports bars in Hoboken. Never again at the Wolf.
2015-10-15,2,Let me preface the meh review but stating that I love me some sports bars and dive bars. Wicked Wolf is really large. Great place to bring a huge group of people without feeling like you've taken over the entire place. Awful place to have a conversation. The ambiance is plan old sports-bar. Tons of 20-something year old guys in backwards hats chugging beers and scanning the room. The servers were all girls in tank tops. Im sure this place will get extremely busy during peak times - if you love that kind of show, this may be your place.Between the noise of frat-boys (or still-stuck-in-frat-boy-land, rather) and the roar of the games all over the tv screens (it was Sat - college football) - I couldnt hear my friend shouting from directly across our table. We got one of those large beer things and I got wine. My wine was fine but the guys said the Coors Light dispenser tasted weird. Either watered down or plasticy... Normally these guys dont complain much, so I'm sure something wasnt right there.We ordered some food - our waitress was kind enough to keep our tab separate (we went to someone's birthday and it was like.. 20 people). We got a few kinds of sandwiches, fried pickles, and chicken tenders. The fried pickles were... mediocre? The dipping sauce seemed thin and from a bottle, and the coating didnt really hold tight to the pickle. the guys didnt say anything about their sandwiches or offer a bite... when i asked how it was, I got a shrug and "well, I was hungry." I did steal a few fries and they were bland, cold, and just all around unimpressive. my girl friend and I split the chicken fingers after thinking of each getting our own order. Im glad we split - those things were rubbery inside and rock hard outside. The batter for the chicken was so crunchy (not in a good way) that if you have a loose tooth, you'd have a gone-tooth after eating those things. The oil it was fried in tasted... old. a bit of a plastic taste maybe? Again - we were all starving so we ate, but I was seriously disappointed that this was the place the birthday person selected.Probably a fine place for people who are hard of hearing and need loud volume on their game that just want to catch a game and have a pint, but I definitely wouldnt put this on my short list of go-to places.
2015-10-04,1,We emailed them asking if they were going to open early for the jets game and they told us they were going to open at 830. We got there at 830 and the manager told us the employees weren't going to get there until 9. Why would you tell people that they were going to open early if you don't even tell your employees to get there until later. We ended up leaving at 920 because they wouldn't let us in. Terrible service never going back there again.
2015-10-03,1,This place would have earned a decent rating from me if it wasn't for our treatment by the staff at closing time. I don't think I've ever been treated so poorly at any food or drink establishment in my life. At 1:51 the patrons were told the bar is closing in 4 minutes. At 1:55 we were all unceremoniously shoved out the door, with many patrons still trying to figure out how to get home. A girl in our group asked politely "doesn't your website say you close at 3?" and indeed Google, yelp, and other online sources say this. The door bouncer rudely replied that "we're open until closing time." Another member of the group was struggling to quickly finish his drink and told the bouncer who was literally kicking us off our table to give us a few seconds just to finish the last third of the drink. Bouncer replied that Yeah he sees that and doesn't care because he wants to go home. I'm sorry buddy, but this is your job. Don't bounce at a bar if you care so much about your beauty rest. I'm sure the nurse at the hospital is more stressed bout her job than you are, and the cashier at McDonald's hates his job more than you hate yours, but these employees don't childishly take it out on their customers. At every other bar anyone one of us has been to, we have been given ample warning, usually about half an hour, between last call and closing time. I figure this is just common courtesy to give people a chance to sort out their rides, say goodbye to friends, etc. Not so here. And it's not even as though the place was so crowded or full of obnoxious people that they really needed to kick us out so rudely. There were less than 20 of us there total. The worst part, however, was being physically pushed out the door as if we were belligerents. Last night the weather consisted of windy, sub-50 degree freezing rain. One girl, not in our group, petite / a little over 5 feet tall, and very underdressed for the weather, was trying to figure out her transportation in the entrance vestibule. She was physically pushed out the door and unto the rain, phone still in hand. As we wait outside for our ride, we looked in through the windows like orphans on Christmas to see the bartenders casually counting the night's money at a table. Why they couldn't just let us wait ten minutes for our rides by the entrance while they did this is beyond me. I understand that this establishment looks like a decent place to spend some time right by the water. I doubt Wicked Wolf will ever really run out of customers looking for a nice drink or dinner, so maybe they just don't care if they alienate some customers. However, this place simply does not deserve your business. There is no excuse for treating customers in the manner that all of us were treated last night. None of us will be going back.
2015-09-10,3,Nice place to hang out and drinks, this place is also good for groups. I've been here couple of times, not bad at all. My concerned here is the mens bathroom, very dirty.
2015-09-03,2,I wouldn't recommend, as the service we were shown was poor. I went for some drinks with friends one night. On this night all the keg lines were down (not the server's fault, but a bummer nonetheless). So, we ordered a certain type of bucket of beer instead. We didn't receive the type of beer we ordered. We were going to exchange, but our server was nowhere to be found. Who lets a cold beers go to waste? Anyway, once we wanted our bill, it took forever... our server was nowhere to found again.Saying that, the prices are good and it has a decent atmosphere.
2015-08-29,5,Loved it... Good price for beer..service was fast... Bartender was great.. Definitely recommend it... Originally from Miami.
2015-08-27,1,I would give them no stars if possible. I have been a waitress, and I completely understand being busy during a rush hour and such, but the waitress, and even the hostesses here were beyond rude. no need to be when she gave the table 2 feet away from me 10x better service than what she gave my table, which wasn't a party larger than 4.  will never return. This is was one of the worst dinning experiences I have ever had, and I hope no one attending this establishment goes through horrid experience I had the misfortune of going through.
2015-08-22,4,What wasn't okay was the policy that if you sit outside you must purchase food.Normally, I would have left. But my husband and I wanted a brew with a view (of the Hudson). I was mildly hungry, so we went with the flow and was not disappointed and the service was friendly. We ordered the Blue Moon Tower (quite a deal!) and if we lived here, would be back. Also ordered two apps with Sarah as our server. But I didn't forget about that disclaimer on buying food. That won't fly with me again. The place was not even packed!
2015-08-22,1,The food is gross and the cleanliness is worse; when my friend picked up the drink menu, a roach emerged from underneath. Nasty. Never again.
2015-08-21,3,Good food and good drinks! However they, for some odd reason, felt it appropriate on a Friday after work to host a live radio show in the bar. It was very confusing. At first, music was playing as it should in every other bar. But then, there were voices - loud voices coming through the speakers. At first I thought I thought they ran out of skips on Pandora and so were forced to listen to the commercials. Suddenly, I looked to my left and saw a dj table with a display for "Q 104.3"! What the fuck!! The bar had literally invited a radio show to host live from the bar - and when I saw live I mean all of the music plus all of the talking!! It was ridiculous, especially for a Friday evening! All we want to do is listen  to music and drink; not listen to some annoying guy talk while waiting for music comes back on. That's why Jesus invented the iPod and that's why I won't be returning to this establishment if I see another live radio show.
2015-08-15,2,Such a great bar and such a great shame that the bar staff take absolute no notice of their customers...instead, upon giving a menu to you they don't consider that you actually might want to order food or when your drink has run out fail to think you might actually want another one...some very basic bar staff training needed here.
2015-08-14,1,I absolutely hate being the person to give a place a negative review. But, I've given this place a few chances, and I'm not sure I've gotten my food in less than an hour a single time. The one time, it took an hour and a half, and our waitress refilled our drinks once during the hour and a half. The food is very average and not nearly worth all that. Hoboken has much better to offer, and you shouldn't waste your time here.
2015-08-09,2,Only reason this place got two stars is because the bartender's awesome. Other than that, the floors are as sticky as a movie theater and the tiles on the floors are missing. A bar in Hoboken that charges higher prices than most should be more up to scale with their layout.
2015-08-04,4,Awesome drink specials, great staff and a wonderful outdoor patio. The mixed drinks are well made and not watered down, which was surprising for the price. The food was pretty good, it's standard bar food so there isn't too much to say. Overall This is a great place to grab a cheap drink or two and enjoy a nice day with a great view. I will definitely be back!
2015-08-01,3,Food is bland and basic. Small selection of craft beers. Prices are reasonable for Hoboken.
2015-07-28,4,Pretty good bar food, cheap beer, decent service and lots of TV's.  Not fine dining by any means, but a great spot to hang out with a few friends and then hang out by the hudson river afterwards.  Good luck finding parking around here....
2015-07-25,4,I went to Wicked Wolf for a friends birthday last night. She got a deal where for $25 we got a 3 hour open bar for well drinks, beer, and wine. If you go out in Hoboken at all you know that is a pretty awesome deal. The venue did get crowed but not unmanageably uncrowded. Overall I had a good time at wicked wolf.
2015-07-22,3,The location is amazing! Right next to the Hudson looking at the beauty that is Manhattan! The best time to visit this establishment is in the summer when the majority of the university students are away for the summer. The Happy hour during the week is a good deal but Slider night in Tuesday is the best! The food quality is average but the drink specials are on point. $3 wine... Yes please! The night I went was also paint night which was distracting and really took away from my ability to enjoy the evening.
2015-07-19,1,Did not like it at all. Overpriced food and waiter was slow. Then the bill came for 5 people and they had already put a 20% service charge which is BS. Probably thought this black family would not give a good tip. Definitely not worth a 20% !!!"Wicked" Wolf in sheep clothing. Will never eat there again and will not recommend anyone waste money at this place.
2015-07-01,3,Came here on a Sunday afternoon with a few friends to get out of the city. This place is right next to the Hudson so you get an amazing outside view of the city.  We initially sat outside but since it started raining we quickly went in. The food here was standard bar food, but what really amazed us were the beer towers (very well priced). We had two beer towers, a couple of cocktails and some food. It wasn't crazy packed on a Sunday afternoon which was nice, ordering staff were very friendly (with us at least) so its a nice place to check out. Lots of TVs here (sports bar, duh) so definitely a good place to be for any sporting event. Not a NJ native, but cool place to come.
2015-06-14,1,The most horrible waitress ever. I have never posted a bad review on any site before but I just had lunch at this restaurant today and the server was absolutely horrible. Long wait time, didn't check on us once both to refresh our drinks or check on if our food was okay. I ordered a second peach mango sangria and it never arrived yet we were charged for it on the bill. The check took 15 minutes to arrive after we asked for it. Last and worst thing was once the bill was corrected and the extra drink was taken off the bill, she gave us the wrong change by short changing us $20. Will never return!
2015-06-08,3,With an amazing location like this on the water and close to the Path, I am surprised they haven't done more but maybe they can get away with mediocre food and service and still pay that high rent and make money.  Menu is straight up bar food and nothing special. Bland sandwiches, extra greasy appetizers, limited beer on draft, can't think of anything unique. So many better places in Hoboken and on the waterfront even.Happy hour spot only IMO, and only if the tables outside are open. Good people watching. Parking is awful of course but it is Hoboken. The lot on 2nd and Hudson is your best bet
2015-06-06,1,If you are looking for hair in your food and bitches waiting on you, then Wicked Wolf is the place for you. We meandared our way down the Hudson looking at a few restaurants and settled on Bitchy Wolf based upon their wide array of brunch items. initial service was good until we asked for silverware and the waitress was pissy about the request and then slammed the silverware down. After 4 bites into my meal i found a long black hair engrained into the meal, a clear sign the hair had been cooked into the food...they were kind enough to make us a new one but did not comp anything on the check, not even a single item!! place is good for a drink maybe, but stay away from food and the brunch staff, whoooffff
2015-05-25,1,Worst service ever! Had to leave our table and go to the bar to get a drink because our server never returned. When she passed by I told her hey, by the way, you never returned so my boyfriend had to go to the bar to get a drink! She replied "okay," and went outside to another table. Then after the horrible service that we complained about, they did nothing. They even denied our use of two buy one get one drink coupons because it is only one per visit. This will be our last visit.  Now that I have calmed down.... It was one bad ( really bad brunette short haired server) that ruined my experience. The food was excellent and the other servers tried to make up for the slacker. Let's hope she isn't in med school.
2015-05-24,1,An absolutely horrible experience at an absolutely horrible establishment.  Getting in the door on Saturday night wasn't the issue as there was no one in line, but once my friends and I got inside we could see why no one was coming in.  The setup is awful with high tables running along the backside of the bar.  It makes it impossible to move around comfortably and blocks off access to the bar.  Once we finally got to the bar the service was awful.  It took several minutes before our group of 6 was even acknowledged.  The servers behind the bar were unattractive and rude, the exact opposite of what you would expect.  The mixed drinks were tiny in size yet ridiculously expensive.  We knew one round was all we were going to stay for here as there are many other more promising bars in the immediate area.  Prior to leaving I was improperly confronted in the bathroom by 2 employees.  I don't think they were bouncers based strictly off the size of the employee named Walter.  He is a tall African American individual, very thin and frail.  To my amazement, myself and my friend who I came to the bar with but didn't know was also in the bathroom were accused of using illicit drugs while in there.  This is mind boggling- I'm a fitness freak and my buddy is a military veteran.  Our responses went unheard by the irrational employees.  I later come to find out that for quite a while Wicked Wolf has had problems with people using drugs in their establishment and on their premises.  Some locals know Wicked Wolf as being synonymous with "that drug bar."   The end result is myself and my friend were wrongly targeted by Walter (a staff member) for something we did not do.  Still contemplating any legal resources we may have but for now we will never go back here again!
2015-05-20,5,I don't know why other users rate this bar so badly, but I've celebrated my birthday last week over there and we've had some really good time. The beer was cheap, the food was decent for a bar, the music played well and crowds were really young and fun. Will come back again soon.
2015-05-14,3,I've been here twice for brunch and a handful of times at night on a Saturday.  The brunch food itself was pretty good.  I really liked the OmLight and home fries as well as the Wicked quesadilla and sweet potato fries I got the time before.  I would not recommend getting that Manmosa they have on the menu...it tastes like watered down OJ and Blue Moon mixed together...it's weird.  I wouldn't recommend bringing kids here b/c the the DJ they have, while entertaining can be crude.  It's extremely loud inside with the music so don't really expect to have conversation unless you sit outside. Great views but location is somewhat out of the way if you're looking to move around.  Crowd tends to be better earlier on Saturday nights as opposed to later where it becomes meh.  I would give it a try at least once or twice.
2015-05-12,3,Go too late and it will be a dive bar, but if you go early enough the crowd is better and it will be a whole lot of fun for a girls night out.
2015-05-07,3,Came here once on a date who lived in Bayonne, since it was the closest to the both of us, we ended up going here after a walk on the pier. It wasn't very crowded, and there was a very sporty vibe, since all the televisions had a game on. Their specials were wings that night, so we ordered them. Wings were dry, you could almost choke on it, and loaded with sauce to balance out the dryness which they obviously knew the meat was. Drinks were good, but they really need to prepare their food better.
2015-05-04,3,this is your 'UNTZ UNTZ UNTZ' Crowd. Not the best food and they aren't true to their menu, they may have what your meal is supposed to be on the menu - what you get is  different.  The bartenders are nice, and the waitresses and staff are very helpful, only if they knew what food they were serving.  Great place to have a group of friends or perhaps to watch a game - but it gets really loud and obnoxious..
2015-04-24,4,Great location, looks right onto the Hudson with a great view of the city. Great sports bar. Gets packed but not TOO packed, which makes it fun. It's pricey, but so is all of Hoboken. Food was good bar food, nothing to brag about. Service was good, but our waitress was definitely over worked, we could barely catch her because she was running around so much. Just felt bad for her.
2015-04-20,4,I love going to Wicked Wolf for the cocktails, very affordable price, tasty and big! The appetizers are also very good. On a sunny day, they have a terrace where you could admire the skyline!! Service is efficient.
2015-03-24,3,I'm actually pretty surprised at some of the reviews. Overall, I find the place to be a 3, but it has some 4-worthy qualities as well. I guess it depends on what you're looking for in your experience. What I like most about Wicked Wolf are the following 3 things: location, trivia, and specials. Wicked Wolf has a beautiful sky-line view, so if the weather is nice you can sit outside or go across the street to take a leisurely walk by the water. They have trivia on Wednesday nights, where you can purchase beer towers and other specials. I'm not sure if this is every week, but this past Sunday they had free Bingo, and who doesn't love 1. Bingo and 2. Free prizes? If you're coming for the food, it's average. I haven't been here for a full-blown meal, but I've tried several of their wraps (Blackened chicken this past Sunday), and they're pretty decent. Nothing out of the ordinary, but yummy. The fries are thin, similar to fast food-style fries. Night time at Wicked Wolf is typical for the bar scene in Hoboken. It does get crowded, as most places do in that area. You can win open bar specials for you and your friends for a future night out by filling out a form when you're there.
2015-03-21,3,I only ate here for lunch, but it was OK.  The food was standard bar type food.  I got the chicken wrap and French fries.  Nothing amazing, but not bad.  The view of the river is very nice.
2015-03-15,4,Fun atmosphere, good music, lots of tvs, great and plentful staff, a place to be on a Saturday night if you're on Sinatra Drive in Hoboken.
2015-03-08,2,Now, this review with a grain of salt, we arrived around 9 p.m. after St. Patty's Day. The bar was somewhat full and the music started off really good.The bartenders are quick and efficient. They ran out of all kinds of gin, except for house (yuck). Bombay? Beefeater? nope. nope. nope.The night is dark and full of terrors, and so is the bathroom (well it wasn't dark in there, but it was full of terrors).So mind you, the entire bar is full of half blackouts and full blackouts. This guy (who looked to be about 19) takes a spill and spends a solid 10 seconds on his back on the floor. So what would be the responsible move here? Obviously bar keep do a shot of Jameson with said green wearing goblin. So I think this practice led tothe entire place being shut down around 12:30 a.m. when a huge brawl broke out. I don't really know how it started, but I think it started with a girl taking a huge spill on the dance floor yadda yadda yadda, lights on everybody has to go home.
2015-02-12,4,Great bar food! Was a fun relaxed atmosphere and we loved everything we ordered. The nachos were one of the best we've had out. Great portion and with drinks alongside it was perfect night out. Great portions! Delicious!
2015-01-26,5,We love the Wicked Wolf. It's right by the water in Hoboken, so when you need a little air, you have a beautiful view. $12 for 2 glasses of Guinness? That's just madness! In the best way possible! The appetizers were excellent and if you Check In on YELP you get 15% off food!
2015-01-19,1,Would not recommend. Bartenders and the new management have very bad attitudes. I was very displeased with the service after waiting nearly 25 minutes for a drink. The service was exceptionally slow after my group purchased an open bar bracelet, and the bartender took recipients drink orders who were paying cash instead.
2015-01-18,3,Great food, reasonably priced for Hoboken. Service is usually slow. The staff is really nice but allow at least an hour for any meal there, it's not going to be quick. Sunday bunch is good, but the music is way too loud, it's like being in a club. In the summer they have outdoor seating, great view of the city. Overall fun place, decent food.
2015-01-17,1,I'm not one to wait in lines but I was going with some people to a birthday celebration at Wicked Wolf Tavern on a Saturday night and there was a line to get in. Some people cut my group as the line went around a corner and then we were in view of the bouncer, so one of my friends said," Hey, you guys cut us."  So then a woman from the cutting group pulled my friends hair, I believe in an attempt to silence/threaten/jostle her. Then the guys in the groups started like, boxing my group out, so I got defensive and said to them like, What makes you like this? You can't just wait in a line? And what kind of garbage person pulls another person's hair? And then the bouncer let them in and looked at me and was like, "If you start stuff in there we're going to have to ask you all to leave." Like, what? My friends and I were going to get on with our lives as soon as we were sheltered from the below freezing weather. But that bouncer had one job and he let a bunch of aggressive dickheads in before us.
2015-01-06,5,Great views on the Hudson. They also have very friendly bartenders.  I recommend Saturday afternoons for a cold Blue moon.
2015-01-04,2,Not horrible, but it's okay. I personally wouldn't go back. It's a loud, tight bar. The music is good, if only there was enough space to dance. It was also pretty dead considering I went on a Saturday night. I haven't tried the food yet, but probably will go back to try it. The drinks are nothing special. They have some specials like the beer tower. The outdoor view is great due to its location on Sinatra Dr. It is fairly close to the path station as well. That's about it with the good stuff.
2014-12-26,4,Friend and I went here on a Friday night for some dinner and drinks as opposed to a big night out. It was both of our first time there and we were happy to find it lively but comfortably spacious upon arrival (8p). We got a chicken sandwich and a burger and each of us was very happy with our sandwiches as well as the fries and the fried pickles we ordered. They were big too - we both took half home with us. Beer selection was decent and my friend enjoyed the cider they had on draft. Overall a really good experience.
2014-12-23,4,I have been to the bar several times..The times that i have been there my bartenders name was Ron tall bald headed well fit guy..He was really nice..Didn't realize that the menu had a drink that he made call the Ron Ron Juice. the drink was amazing.i give him 3 thumbs up..awesome guy.. hope to see him again when i go..
2014-12-01,4,This is one of those bars in Hoboken that you tend to overlook since its away from the hustle and bustle of Washington St.However,the fact that it is right at the edge of the river with an amazing view makes up for that. Its outdoor seating is perfect for summer evenings. Inspite of its seemingly low profile,this place gets plenty busy as the night goes on,especially on weekends.The first time we stopped by,we seated ourselves and waited around for someone to come to us but after about 15 mins of being ignored,we quietly got up and left.Since that incident seemed a one-off because they were extraordinarily busy,we decided to give it another try and this time around,we mere thankfully much better served.The drinks were well made and the food,though not overly impressive,was good enough.We got the salmon sliders ,the chipotle chicken sandwich and a side of coleslaw.The sliders were tasty though a bit dry.the sandwich was pretty good and the coleslaw was decent(loved the quaint earthenware serving dish it came in)We will be coming back to try its happy hour deals and Tuesday night karaoke.
2014-11-25,2,The Karaoke system makes everyone sound like Carrie Underwood... Its great. My favorite waitress from staten island is the best! How she puts up with the sunday funday crew is beyond me. The one negative is the guidos found out about it and now its basically Djais off season on Sundays. Tattoos, fitteds and Menthol cigs every sunday during football season from 10am-10pm. RIP #Wolfsundays
2014-11-19,3,Went to Wicked Wolf in a Tuesday night for Karaoke. The song list is rediculously long and has almost any song you can think of thats popular. Right on Frank Sinatra Drive so a beautiful view of the NYC skyline. Recommended for an easy cool night out with friends.
2014-11-14,5,So my sister came here about a month ago and put my name in for a chance to win a free happy hour and I won! They let me choose the date of when I wanted to come in so I was here this past Saturday and it was awesome!! I won drinking for free from 9-11 (they give you six free drink tickets and a mug!) and my friends got like $4 drinks as well so it was perfect. It was packed but a fun crowd.. The bartenders and staff were great and we all had a good time here for sure!
2014-11-07,4,Good atmosphere on a Friday night! Lots of people hanging out and drinking. Good music, and of course good food! I had the grilled veggie wrap with sweet potato fries and it was good, as well as presentation. I would suggest coming here for lunch as well.
2014-11-06,3,Sports bar. Plenty of TVs. Food is good. Prices are fair. There are plenty of daily deals. Nothing spectacular other than your average sports bar. Plenty of space, but pretty standard sports bar.
2014-11-01,3,Not a bad bar but it's really loud. We had the blackened chicken wrap and a steak sandwich. The chicken wrap was good but I would say "pass" on the steak sandwich. The servers were nice, and our food came out pretty quickly. The key to this place though is to just stick to traditional bar food.
2014-10-23,5,If you're trying to party for Football Sundays in New Jersey, this is the premier place! Tons of TVs but more of a party scene than a bunch of guys watching football. The DJ is always pretty good and the place is jumping. I've never been to this place any other time. If you plan on going make sure you get there by 11:30 or you'll wait in a long, seemingly never-ending line.
2014-10-12,2,The food here was decent, just regular bar/pub food. I was surprised that the restaurant did not have anything but whole milk to serve with coffee, and the waitress was very rude when I asked. The food was a good price, but with mediocre food and an unfriendly wait staff, I'd say it's better to head to a different bar during the day. However, when I've walked by the restaurant around night time it looks like it gets pretty popping, but haven't been inside in a nightlife setting yet.
2014-10-03,2,Cheap drinks, that's the only thing they place has going for it. I only come here when one of my friends wins the happy hour deal. They get to drink for free and all of their friends get discounted rates on drinks: $4 mixed beverage and $3 draft beers. Pretty good deal and definitely enticing because everywhere around it is so expensive. Otherwise, I would never step foot in this bar. It's not my crowd.
2014-10-02,3,Not bad, not great.  I have been here on several Wednesday nights for trivia and they also have a buy one get one free burger special on Wednesdays.  They have $15 beer towers with Blue Moon or Coors Light (usually).  Cool place, great location and view. The food is decent bar food. Nothing to complain about but it isn't anything to brag about either. Wednesdays are fun, Wicked Wolf runs trivia well. Always has some good quality prizes from iPads to concert or sports tickets.  They do raffles, give away beer towers...it's a fun time. Weekend nights can be fun too, more of the dance/DJ/music night scene. Not my favorite bar to go to on a Friday/Saturday night unless I get picked for a free Happy Hour.  You put your name on a card and a week or a two later you randomly get selected for a free happy hour from 9pm-11pm and your friends get half off. Definitely worth it, that's always a good time!
2014-09-26,3,Been here twice for the happy hr 9-11 on FridaysFirst time, huge line and crazy busy because of a hockey game. My pineapple vodka  was strong, which was great, but we ended up moving out because we were a little scared of the fans lol.Second time, my girls and I wanted to stick to a booth, the hostess(? lady by the door) was really sweet, and the bartenders (blonde girl, brunette girl, super tall guy and a white guy) were fairly prompt with service despite the huge crowd at the bar, but 2 things:The bar area is so crowded! Trying to get drinks then edge out through the high tables was a challenge. And, we ordered the same two-three drinks for the five of us, with dramatically varying results. Literally my friend and I both got whiskey cokes at the same time for another friend and one was mostly Coke, the other mostly whiskey. We mixed the two to get a normal drink.Prompt service, clean bathroom, fairly professional/not-idiotically-drunk-frat crowd, but very, very busy on game days. Not sure I'd want to socialize. The bouncer near the end of the night was cordial.Excellent location (facing the water!), block away from the Path, fairly close to a few other bars.
2014-09-17,2,The food was okay, but our waitress was not. I give everyone the benefit of the doubt and I take everything into consideration because I can imagine she had a long day. However she was so disconnected and barely looked at us our entire stay that I just did not feel welcomed. It's nothing amazing, there are better bars in Hoboken honestly.
2014-09-13,2,Walked in and walked out. The place looked nice and lively but the hostess was incredibly rude. Put a sour taste in my mouth. It's a shame that I didn't give it a chance but if I don't feel welcomed in a place it's not worth my time
2014-09-10,3,It's not a place that I love to be. It's a sports bar. Since I'm European I'm not into American sports that much. The bartenders look too Hot, and they talk to much to their customers, it's very hard to get their attentions. Some of them act like Karen Smith. Too Hot, Too Silly!
2014-08-29,2,Do you want to be surrounded by 20 something woo girls. Cha-ching!! you've found the place. Throw in some american eagle walking billboards into the mix. These people will be hoping to rub privates on the dance floor tonight.
2014-08-28,4,Was here on Wednesday for a drink, but ended up getting some nachos and the $15 beer tower (equivalent of 4 glasses and a half). I love the outdoor seating with the view of NYC skyline - looks amazing especially after sunset. Service was quick and the staff were very attentive.I don't mind coming back ... looks like a fun spot to watch a game.
2014-08-21,4,The summer is winding down and visions of football Sundays are dancing in my head. What does that mean? Time to stand in line at wicked wolf!Gotta admit, my first go round here was pretty shocking. If I were a real house wife of New Jersey wannabe, I would totally bust out the extensions (because I'd be too fancy to call it a weave), don my teensiest jersey, tightest booty shorts, and sky high heels, and head to wicked to seductively slurp a pink drink through a straw without smudging my lip gloss, patiently waiting for the commercials on game day so I could get my jersey turnpike on with the bevy of fake baked muscle bound men who frequent the joint, pounding shots and banging on tables to the beat.Alas, I'm just a normal girl. But I can't wait to put on my high tops of the week, get there early for some pregame grubbing, and avidly watch the games amidst the absurd mish mosh of sports bar meets night club on a Sunday fun day. Are you ready for some football?!?!?!
2014-08-18,4,I enjoy this place a lot for football games. I cannot wait for football season so my friends and I can frequent this bar. The food is good, beer prices are not high and the bartenders are quick! I would recommend this place to anyone. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is the crowd! It's so packed with bros.
2014-08-10,2,So the Wicked Wolf....where do i begin. I went a couple times-both with colleagues just sticking to drinks and appetizers. The drinks are drinks (wine and beer-nothing special)-they're good. The nachos are great too. So are the fried pickles. The Sangria I got on my third visit was not on par. It tasted watered down and cheap for $8. My fourth time I went, I had won a happy hour contest for my friends and me on a Friday night. I had a terrible time getting there by train, so I arrived with about an hour left of the special. I get there and the bouncer is trying to get my boyfriend and I to wait outside (after I told him I'm a contest winner) but eventually told us to wait for the hostess at the front. We waited about 5 minutes for the hostess to get back. She put armbands on everybody to enjoy the special without any question of whether these people are actually friends of the winners. The place was packed and literally everybody had an arm band on. I got my drinks free, but still, didn't feel like I had really "won" anything. The outside patio wasn't open even though it was a pretty night...I mean i know it's a Friday night, but I couldn't even converse with my friends because of the noise and no service outside. So will I be back? Probably so since I work in the same building as Wicked Wolf, but I will know to just hit up happy hour after work for some cheap beer/wine and apps. Not a place to go for a good cocktail, but perhaps I am just a snob because i work for a restaurant that does hand crafted cocktails with fresh fruit, etc. Decent atmosphere, but needs to be re-marketed for the Friday/Saturday night party crew. Is it a city bar atmosphere? Is it a place to watch the big game? I still don't know.
2014-08-02,4,Great location, with a picture perfect view upon exiting.Gets crazy at night...
2014-07-20,3,Food was run of the mill for the bar scene however nachos left much to be desired. A friend talked our group into visiting after some hype she seen on a tv show (?)about this place. Eh..... It was ok but wouldn't run back too quick.
2014-07-19,4,Went last night -- place is PACKED, barely any room to move. The bartenders were all amazing at handling the crowd (well except one blonde -- obviously not having a great night), and the drinks were cheap and strong; only $4 for a rum on the rocks and $3 for rum & coke. My kind of prices. The music started out awesome -- had a nice lil mix of Top 40, old school R&B, and 80's/90's (my fave), but unfortunately it turned into all Hip-Hop by the time I got to the dance floor. Sad. I still danced my ass off; barely any room to do so, since the dance floor is packed just like the rest of the place, but what do you expect on a Friday night.This seems like a pretty solid place to come and meet people. (Though I did try to talk to this one girl on the dance floor and she was a pretentious twat and thought I was hitting on her. Newsflash: I'm gay. Don't flatter yourself.)
2014-07-17,1,Where do I begin? Lets just say, the only two things that were good about this place were the beautiful night sky above the outdoor seating/patio  and the 15% off Yelp Check-in coupon which, by the way, should have been a 'comp' for all that my friend and I had to tolerate while visiting this establishment.It was Friday, July 4th (a Friday night) around 9pm. You would assume that proper consideration would have been  made with regards to staffing since it was a) a weekend night b) a holiday c) a waterfront restaurant d) clear skies (no rain) for outdoor seating. We arrived and were directed to sit BY THE BOUNCER. No hostess in sight. We sat for a good 10-15 minutes before receiving menus during which time a female server came by to ask about drinks (odd way of saying 'welcome to the hippest bar in town') and we had no drink menu to pick from; since we were famished we just ordered chips and dip with the drinks to get us by. We started to browse the menu and, at this point, I remembered my Yelp check-in and discovered a 15% coupon- funny thing is? When you open the coupon a countdown begins, allotting you 3 hours to use the coupon. Because of this nifty gadget, I was able to track that it took 18.5 minutes to get our drinks. They brought them one at a time (part of 2) which in my opinion is rude but okay, to each his/er own philosophy. The appetizer arrived way before the drinks and we had nothing to chase down with, no water, no napkins to wipe nacho cheese off chins, hands, etc. AND the dips were totally covered in a heat film (you know the sight- when you can see that its been sitting under a burner for hellish eternity). And- for 8 bucks?- not worth a dime. Cheese cold, guacamole not fresh (from the bag), and salsa (well you cant mess up something out of jar now can you). The entire time of our ordering and asking for water and for napkins, etc we got the strangest attitude from the server- like she was 'in the weed's and we were bothering her. I was so ticked off after a while that I went inside to find the hostess and ask to cancel our food order (ive never done that!). After saying half of my 'I want to leave' speech, the girl looks up and, lo and behold, our server is standing behind the hostess desk! Taking a moment's pity on her I told her, 'listen ive worked in hospitality too and I know the speed of the kitchen and the understaffed situation (if that was the case) is NOT your fault, however, I don't want to even eat what I ordered anymore...my friend and I are upset....i took her out for a nice birthday meal and...plain and simple...its not good." She said she'd bring over the check and I walked back to the table. 5-10 MINUTES LATER!!!!!....she comes back WITH OUR FOOD IN HAND. (Seriously?!) No manager, no apology, no discount, no 'recovery' tactic as they say in the hospitality world, puts the food down in front of us and says, ' I know you said you wanted to cancel your order but its ready so can you just like eat it?" Why I agreed to eat it I'm not sure, maybe because I was embarrassed at this point. We bitterly eat some of the cold, overcooked, not tasty meal (I'm actually cringing as I write this from the memory) and no one comes over to check on us, refill our drinks, apologize, ask how it tastes, etc. (did the manager call out, too?) AND, in the end, we end up paying full price except for the 15% coupon!!! Like, seriously? I'm mind-boggled. To top it off, a busboy walked around all the night and just stared in our direction, visibly noticing our empty/dirty plates, and doing nothing about it. Another server inched behind my chair to pass and open the patio gate to let himself out to hang out with bouncer (why couldn't he use the front door?) and LEFT THE GATE open RIGHT NEXT TO MY CHAIR. Hello? The bouncer was also allowing people to smoke right behind our table near the front door. He then proceeded to do nothing about the following either: when a few of the smokers (guys who were clearly under the influence and possible underage) started whistling at us and saying 'come back to my crib for an after party' and I yelled back 'seriously???  seriously?? Fuck off' what's a bouncer for anyway. LOVELY dinner outing, let me tell you. Really, Top notch. Never coming here again.
2014-07-16,3,Wicked Wolf is a step up from your standard sports bar - aka it is nice place. The bar is located along the water with outdoor seating, TVs, and a big sports ticker (says it is from Wolf of Wall Street). I've been there 2x now for group events and it seems to be a popular place for that. The food is pretty standard, but good. The buffalo bites and pretzel sticks are worth ordering again.
2014-07-10,5,Visited Hoboken for the first time and came across Wicked Wolf and noticed the happy hour when walking by, which is awesome by the way!...sitting outside on the patio people watching and the view of the city is so nice. the buffalo bites are delicious and so is the chicken quesadilla. screens all over the bar to watch any sports game. I'm glad we got to visit this place while in Jersey. great deals on drinks at happy hour and great food. Truly a great tavern!
2014-07-09,1,"A picture is worth a thousand words"Unfortunately for one young and ignorant bartender, one word was enough.  During an outing in Hoboken on Saturday night, I decided to introduce my friend to the Wicked Wolf Tavern on Sinatra Drive. The location is perfectly situated and its beautiful scenic makes great for a day out. But, beware of what lurks behind the bars. As we sat at the bar and order our drinks, a pleasant conversation about the World Cup sparked between my party and the bartender.  I was soon distracted by the customer at the end of the bar who was attempting to get the attention of another bar tender (Caroline), whom was too busy on her cell phone. I felt that it was my responsibility to redirect the bartender we were speaking with to acknowledge the customer at the end. It was distressing to see what potential challenges I would need to deal with if I remained there.  As my party and I continued celebrating our day out and snapping pictures.  Caroline the (Bartender) walked behind our group and took a glance at our picture, as she walked away assuming no one heard her she negatively commented on the picture. I was appalled at what Caroline had said but most important I was disappointed that Wicked Wolf tavern would allow such ignorance to work at its establishment.  I immediately finished my drink and left the location.  This was my second and last time attending this place. Aside from the View that Sinatra drive offers, this place is no gem. They offer no happy hour on a Saturday, poor service, and if you go during the week you may not find sitting, or space and will most like have to wait for a table. If you are looking for a GREAT TIME with people who are not obnoxious I recommend you try Texas Arizona on River Street instead. The bartenders at Texas Arizona are much more respectful and reliant and quick to provide friendly service.
2014-06-30,4,Nice bar in hoboken right by the river/park. couple blocks from train stationhappy hour is nice with $5 all app and $3-4 drinkstoo bad it ends around 7drinks are strong and worth the moneyfood is on point
2014-06-26,4,Food - Tried the bbq wings and its extremely delicious. Happy hours chargesnat 5$. Ambience - Really nice seating outside during summer. A good sports bar to enjoy a game.Service - Extremely nice folks. Were more than happy to change orders.Cost - ~14$ per head for two drinks and appetizers
2014-06-26,3,It's a nice place. Food is pretty good but they're a little cheap with the liquor. I ordered something the waitress recommended and it came out in like a tiny cup and it was $12. I literally took like a shot but paid for a full drink. The waitress only came by like once, she was an older woman with semi curly hair, I don't even know her name. Not my absolute favorite place but a good place if you want to come with your mom or something to Hoboken. Not too much of a "young crowd" it's more 35+
2014-06-25,4,Went here for the first time on Memorial Day. The waiter was awesome, great customer service.  Menu did not have a lot of options though :/ . I ordered the Salmon BLT, it was delicious. Never though Salmon and bacon would be so great together.
2014-06-11,4,Went during a lull hour for drinks and a late lunch. We were going to sit inside at first and the bartender told us we could sit anywhere, but when we went to sit, a very frazzled busboy/ host told us the table was reserved for a later time. Not a serious problem,  but 1.) Lack of communication and 2.) Being frazzled at service downtime is not a good look for prime hours. I would not come back then. We opted to just sit outside instead. The drinks were average priced around $7, and the selection wasn't amazing. My burger was amazing though, among the best I've had in Hoboken.  It was a large portion,  and I had to finish it even though I was stuffed.  The server was also very kind and attentive. I was impressed with the quality of service.  Overall great experience and I would come back!
2013-12-06,3,I go here mostly for lunch or after work drinks, so I can't really comment on what sounds like frat boy insanity on football Sunday. That being said, this place has a crapload of televisions setup, so I would imagine you can see just about every game if you're willing to turn your head.For what I do have experience with here, the food is pretty decent for lunch and they have a good selection of beers. The prices aren't dirt cheap but they're still probably 40% less than what you'll pay across the river. $6 beer. $10 sandwich. You can definitely find cheaper in Hoboken, but you're paying a bit extra here for the waterfront location, televisions and sports ticker, and moderately more sanitary conditions. Service is nice but somewhat slow even when they're not packed.
2013-11-20,3,Went here for Halloween with coworkers and had a blast! Danielle gave us drink specials because we were a pretty big group. It was $5 Drafts and $5 Well drinks which our group really liked. I'm not really sure what kind of crowd they have on regular nights because it seems like it's sport bars by day but then club at night? I don't know. The DJ was great. He played a multitude of songs that had everyone jamming all night. It was good time...but I don't know if that 's because my coworkers are so much fun and it was Halloween or if it's because the Wicked Wolf is a good place to party. I MAY try it out again on a non-holiday night..but it's not on my top 10 places to party in hoboken.
2013-11-17,1,I should have known better. It wasn't my idea to come here.First major criticism: I have never in my life heard of a sports bar charging a cover to watch a sports event on TV. This has to be the most asinine thing I've ever experienced. Do we get a T-shirt? Do we get anything? Oh, no, you just get to come in and watch said sports event. Oh, excellent, okay. Food is typical bar fare, the kind good enough to coat the stomach for a long night of drinking and fumbling attempts at picking up women. There were a lot of those. I wouldn't expect much in the area of food, but it will probably be enough to keep you happy. Our group - the ones that were hungry- ordered nachos, wings, and fried pickles. All looked good. Nachos a little bland.The crowd was an immediate flashback to college, but, by all appearances, these patrons are far too old to still be doing this. The group of dancing drunk girls was entertaining, while the bros who scoffed as our waitress when they were asked to move their coats so they we might reserve a table were a preview of what was to come. It's the kind of atmosphere where the bro-tension is palpable, where you feel like if you say excuse me or reserve a table where bros have congregated, someone may try to fight you. Rudeness and classlessness are a prerequisite and come with the cover charge. We actually witnessed a guy and a woman attempt to befriend us so that they could hustle our food from us. The guy just reached across the table and helped himself to the bountiful plate of wings. At the end of the time there, without even really engaging with these people, Drunk Blonde Waif Girl actually stuck her skinny, gross finger into some wing sauce and went to town on it, licking the sauce of her finger and double dipping into a perfect stranger's leftover food scraps.If you are going here with a certain level of enthusiasm for a sports event that you want to see and you have the time, the money, and the space to enjoy yourself, politely and semi-responsibly, while you watch, the place could really be great, even epic, but maybe just not between the hours of 9 and midnight on a Saturday night where the vibe just totally changes into something on the level of a crowded frat party, plus the bartenders, minus the roofies, and including the multitude of poor decisions by women wearing too much makeup and dudes with popped collars.
2013-10-24,4,Awesome nachos and quesadillas! Our server Ashley was great given we had a really big group! Great music and fun atmosphere on a Thursday.
2013-09-22,1,Waited for an hour in line to get in for the Giants game. Was told by the door guy that he would let us in for $40 each, there was no cover so why would we pay $40???...
2013-09-04,3,Great for football. Typical jocky large bar atmosphere. Plenty of TVs.
2013-09-03,3,Visited Wicked Wolf on Sunday evening and grabbed a spot outside. Unfortunately, our table was not level -- I was expecting our beers to slide off the table. Thankfully, another table opened up by the time our food arrived. Our beers were reasonably priced. We shared the veggie burger ($9) with swiss cheese (+$1), and sauteed onions (+$1). Pretty good veggie burger. Okay fries, not too salty. It took a while for the food to come out, and everything was barely warm. Service was friendly and cheerful. Enjoyed the relaxing, casual vibe in the outdoor seating area. The interior has a classic sports bar feel and will probably turn into bro central on most evenings. Short walk from the Hoboken PATH station. On a nice day, it's not a bad walk from Jersey City. I wouldn't mind going back, but other than being by the water, this place is not all that memorable.
2013-08-31,3,Stopped by for a few drinks. Great atmosphere. Very energetic. Excellent number of TVs to see all the games. Bartender was high energy and in top of things. Average tap And beer selection which earned it 3 vs 4 stars. The food coming out of the kitchen looked good. Definitely recommend this place.
2013-08-30,2,Very hit or miss - great spot to watch games, but expect a long wait on football Sundays. Plenty of TVs, the giant sports ticker is a nice addition, and the booths along the windows on 1st St. each have a personal TV. Food is hit or miss, but mostly miss, and the service was absolutely terrible on my most recent visit. Come for the games, but be prepared for the lines and crowds, as well as below average food and service.
2013-08-12,2,I wanted to give 2.5 stars. It was ok. Great location. Helpful staff. Food was mediocre. Probably a great happy or late night scene. Do go try it for yourself!
2013-07-31,2,Beware of using the Amazon Local / Living Social Deals here!  Buy $20 get $40 food and drinkYou can't use them if anything on the your receipt is not full price.  A few of my friends went to dinner and ordered a mix of food and $3 beers (discounted beers), all on the same bill, and were told that our $40 of food didn't qualify for the deal because there were discounted beers on the same receipt.  The deal clearly says "excludes discounted drinks", NOT "cannot be used on food when discounted drinks are on the same bill".  The manager was rude and clearly didn't care about his customers.  We told him we wouldn't come back ever, and the reply was "well that's your decision".  I would not advise anyone to go back to this place, customer service is horrible, food is okay, and clearly they are mis-advertising use of their promotions.
2013-07-24,2,I had a burger, onion rings, and two Stone IPA's. My girlfriend had a burger, onion rings, and two Miller Lites. I had a Groupon worth $40 and somehow we still ended up paying another $20+ dollars (before tip). Beer was good, the onion rings were tasty and the burgers were adequate. The service started out terrible and got worst as the night (and volume of the bar/restaurant) progressed.
2013-07-14,2,Food was great... Went here with a Groupon voucher. However, the service was HORRENDOUS. The food runners would just throw your food on the table rudely. Our waitress was a space cadet. My meal was screwed up twice. Our bill... Well, we were charged for another table's drinks. The bill got fixed, then she used my card to pay another table's bill. Everything was fixed in the end... I didn't bother to speak with a manager. There was just a lot of unnecessary trouble to have a nice meal.
2013-07-10,3,I guess this is a good sports bar.  Its not the best, but certainly not the worst.  The food was just OK, most of it tasted like it was frozen previously.  Lots of TVs to choose from.  The waitress service was slow and the bar service was pretty good.  I guess I would come back, but it would not be my first choice.
2013-07-10,2,I would say 2.5 stars but not really enough to round up. It's a typical by the PATH bar that caters to that crowd. It has nice views of the city from outside. The food is meh at best. I've never gotten anything particularly good, everything is pretty underwhelming and in desperate need of some seasoning. The wings were probably the only decent thing I've had here. This last time we went we got the chips and dips and the chips were so stale we had to send them back, which I hate doing but they were hard as rocks.The happy hour is actually pretty solid, usually $3 drafts and well drink specials I can't remember because I can't get past $3 Guinness's. I really only come here because they are constantly on groupon and I'm a sucker for a deal, and it's next to my wife's work so we pop in for a drink. The outside seating is a plus.Other than that the place is fairly standard Hoboken water front bar. douchey crowd, actually saw a fist pumping circle one night...yeah that shit really happens. Just really not my scene in the evening hours, and if you like that sorta thing you'd be all over it. I guess I'm getting older and I like to drink and hold conversation at the same time. I would say come here for Happy Hour and leave shortly thereafter. The service is fair sometimes bad sometimes great.
2013-07-01,5,this is one of my favorite bars since going to hoboken. i dunno why but its a cool place to hang out. its by the water which i love and a good space to dance.
2013-06-06,2,I am in Hoboken for a few meetings this week so we went here as it's part of the building that my office is in.First, this is just your typical pub fair. Nothing special at all. I got the black and blue salad and asked for my steak to be cooked medium rare. I got it and it was well done. Gross. The rest of the salad was meh.I did get hte sweet potato fries as a side, they were ok, but nothing special.I will say they have a great Happy Hour - $3 for draft and wine (maybe other things too). SO bottom like, I would drink here again, but not eat here again.
2013-05-24,4,From the perspective of a new mom, the staff at WW has been very accommodating to my friends and I during the mid-week lunch hour. Opening doors, providing a table with lots of stroller space - all goes a long way!  The food is average/good, but I really come here b/c they never make me feel like an inconvenience.
2013-04-22,3,$5 Bloody Marys (Maries?) and how delicious they are!  The space is airy and bright with huge windowed walls.  Lots of TVs.  Food was  nothing to write home about, but still fine.  Three stars because it's great for a Bloody Mary Sunday brunch or to watch day games.  Gets crowded, but that's not necessarily a bad thing if you're out to socialize!
2013-04-17,4,Came here with a deal i bought on amazon local($20 for $40 worth of food and drinks). Place gets really packed. This is a good place to watch games and eat and drink. Ordered the wings which were amazing and a california chicken sandwich which was also really good. The best part is that they make shandy's which is my favorite drink and they make it good and our waiter was very nice and attentive. Will definitely be going back to watch a yankee game and enjoy good food and drinks.  My only problem is that it does get crazy packed and tables and menus were very sticky
2013-03-09,2,In a word: LOUD(!!!). This is downtown Hoboken defined: expensive, trendy, packed shoulder to shoulder, and extremely loud.  To the point where you can't carry on a conversation or get a decent hint to your wingman. Creepy drunk guys grind against obliterated drunk girls and the average decibel level has to be pushing 120. Those looking for that kind of scene will probably have a blast here.  The rest, steer cleae and discover the heart of Hoboken
2013-03-06,2,Regarding the food at this place, I've now eaten here several times during happy hours and have yet to order something that I've actually enjoyed. Everything there is sub-par standard bar food so hopefully if you're eating there you're enough drinks that you won't mind the lack of flavor.As far as a bar, this place definitely fills up with its fair share of douchebags on a Friday/Saturday nights but its great for happy hours.
2013-03-06,2,Went to the Wicked Wolf on February 17. This was the 2nd time that I ate at the WIcked Wolf.   I was disappointed this time around with the size of the portions.  I ordered the waffles with strawberries and blueberries and was extremely disappointed.  The 1 waffle came out and it looked like it was a side order.  The waiter actually came over and asked me if that was going to be enough and if I wanted another waffle.  I asked him if it would be free, but he said I would have to order more waffles.  The menu says "waffles," and that is not true.  It is very misleading and I was very disappointed with my dining experience yesterday. I am not sure if I will make it back for a 3rd time.  I would suggest that the menu be changed so Wolf patrons get what they order off the menu.  I contacted management and their only response was is that they are currently working on the brunch menu.  They should hopefully work on putting on the menu what you actually get when you order.  Doubt I will go back.
2013-02-24,2,Other than the beautiful city view, this bar isn't anything to rave about. The food is mediocre & it's a toss up whether you'll receive a friendly server or not. If you're looking for a decent place to watch a game, the drink specials aren't bad but, if you want great food, this isn't the place.
2013-02-19,2,the food here is just okay - i'd have a hard time recommending anything off the menu and i've been here a few times. the hot wing sauce is average at best, the wings aren't crispy yet they're fried... the grilled chicken has no flavor. the bread on any burger or sandwich always seems stale. this place is only good if you're looking for a beer and maybe to watch a game. excellent location on the water though.
2013-02-15,4,Great spot for sporting events, plenty of tv's and the food is good.
2013-02-11,1,Just went here for lunch with a work group. We were a large group, but the place was empty so we got seated right away. I initially thought this was a plus. I've never been to WW before, so I ordered a burger - something nobody could mess up, right? It costs extra for chili and cheese (a dollar each) and two dollars to substitute sweet potato fries for normal french fries. Granted, there were 12 of us, but the food came out very slowly, in drips and drabs, a few plates at a time, instead of all at once. That can be kind of shitty, as you're getting hungrier watching others eat. And come on, there was no one else there. How hard is it to make twelve meals, in a restaurant obviously designed to accommodate almost 10X that number of people? Sure, there was only one waitress on staff at the time, but come on. There was us and one other group of people. I found out why the place was empty when I got my burger. I asked for medium rare, and it was medium well, with barely a bit of pink in the center. The chili was flavorless and boring. The cheese was nice and gooey and the bun was good, but it didn't make up for how bland the whole thing was. The fries were also dry, and there were very, very few of them, especially given the fact that they cost $2 extra. I spent $13+tip all together for a dull, unsatisfying meal. I've had much better meals at half the cost at my company cafeteria. Between the bad service and the bland, forgettable food, I won't be back. There are dozens of places in the 07030 that are much better. Don't waste your time, Hobokenites.
2013-01-26,2,I had moderately high hopes when I found out that a Wicked Wolf opened in Hoboken a couple of years back. After all, I had many good times at the New Haven Wicked Wolf during my time up there - nothing too fancy, but good music, good dancing, and cheap drinks.I've really tried to find the upside in the Hoboken WW, but try as I might, it's just not very fun. I've gone on different days, at different times, and the result is always the same - a half packed bar (+1 star for not being overcrowded), with maybe 5 people dancing (and all 5 of them came as a group).  That's it. The rest are just standing around watching the tv screens, or just sitting. Music is actually decent, but the type of crowd that it attracts isn't very fun...just your stereotypical Hoboken crowd (the icing was the last time I went, one bro bumped into another bro and got into a fight. When the bouncer asked him to stop, the bro tried to fight the bouncer. lol).With so many bars packed into such a small town (and with tons of other options even on Sinatra Drive), this one is a definite miss. Sorry WW, it's just not working out...but we'll always have New Haven
2013-01-25,3,Nice sports bar, they have some cool specials on week nights. They do karaoki, and trivia. It is a favorite for local college students. Normal prices are a little expensive but it has a nice upbeat atmosphere.
2012-12-29,1,Came here around 9:30 on saturday nighy before ufc fights started. It was a good time come; we got a table and ordered food before it got crazy packed. We ordered drinks, food and a beer tower. Our super sweet waitress left around 10:30 and told us we would have to order drinks at the bar after, which was fine.This is when the night went bad! This place is packed and we stood in line behind some rather drunk girls being served shot upon shot, even though they were falling all over the place. When we finally got the bartenders attention we ordered another bud light tower. He simply shakes his head no and turns away to help other people...ummmm what does that mean? No beer towers? No bud light? Seriously just tell us so we can order something else!! Jared was the bartender, we had to ask the girls at coat check. Hes horrible and ill never be back here because of him. A lot of other packed places in hoboken to go that dont have rude bartenders.
2012-12-21,2,Really just didn't vibe with me. The food was really subpar (my salmon sandwihch was served both soggy and cold) and the beer selection failed to impress me. The TV's were certainly fantastic and the restaurant overlooked NY skylight, which also would have been prettier if it weren't rainy and miserable on the night I went to Wicked Wolf.Overall, I think this is one of those reviews written on a bad visit, but hey, if you're around the area, feel free to check this place out, just keep in mind there are probably better bars out there.
2012-12-19,2,Wicked is a fun place to Sunday Funday or happy hour. Sundays are absolutely incredible during football season. In between plays and games the DJ is always killing it keeping the crowd going. You feel like you're out on a Saturday night not binge drinking midday Sunday. Staffs always nice. Its a big space with a lot of windows so you don't feel like you're trapped in a dingy bar. My only complaint would be the food. Its sub par at best. Definitely a place Id go to for drinks and fun but not to enjoy a meal.
2012-12-19,3,Summary:  A typical nice hoboken bar. Good beer, Ok food,  Gets really crowded on weekends, but great weekday bar and fun trivia nights.I wanted to give it 3.5 star from a mixed experience.  Overall most weekdays 4 stars. On weekends 3I have been here numerous times over the past year on weekdays and weekends and its really two separate worlds. During the week its a fantastic bar.The service is good , its not too crowded always a place to sit down. The booth TVs are great for mid week college football games and bowl games around this time of year as well. The food comes out quick you can always get a drink , over all a great experience. I have especially enjoyed grabbing some friends for trivia nights there to have fun get some free swag and enjoy the drink and tower special they have constantly changing through the night.  My only complaint there would be the rampant cheating with people on their smart phones in corners getting near perfect scores and winning trivia. If your in the middle of the bar its pretty obvious , but i see people sitting in the booths and the guy in the corner on their team trying to be all discrete about typing away on his smart phone for Wikipedia answers.  Wish they would crack down on that harder.Weekends are another thing especially Sundays.  The earliest  football games arent so bad when they start , get in early grab a seat and enjoy the games. But as the day goes on it gets really packed to the point you can barely see around or hear.Saturdays nights are like this too packed in shoulder to shoulder with a line outside , they area you can dance is get so crowded you can barely move around. There is  a  line out the door and forget about getting a drink , unless your the stereotypical jersey Guido waving a 50 at the bar tended and constantly hollaring at them or a girl with their top popping out be prepared to sit there with cash in hand waiting to get a drink for 15 min or longer.  My advice start going for your next drink when your about 50% through the one in hand lol.
2012-12-06,4,I like this place!! Good for a chill Place. Only one bad part is its beyond crowded. I turned around to see if my girls were behind me and i found out that a VERY TALL white man was trying to dance with me shaking his butt in my face. NOT COOL when im only 5'1 lol. Nice and DarkGreat MusicGood DrinksOh and there is usually a line outside to get in at least there's no Entrance fee.
2012-11-23,2,I like the location of the Wicked Wolf Tavern, and I like the food, but it is SO loud in there at times, that I cannot stand to be there very long.  Turn down the volume on the TVs, and the music, and it would be a much more pleasurable experience!
2012-11-16,3,Average food, decent prices. Good for special events -- like a football game -- but I would avoid this place on weekend nights. (WAY WAY WAY too crowded)
2012-11-15,4,I was here for a Halloween event. Staff were awesome and all dressed up. Great crowd and plenty of space inside. Good drinks. Typical bar food. I had a great time.  I would definitely come back if I were in Hoboken.
2012-11-07,2,Do NOT come here on Sundays!  I attempted to go here a few weeks ago for football and when I arrived there was a line and against my best judgment, I got in line and decided to wait it out for a little bit.  While I was on line I had to endure a pack of douche bag guido wannabe guys in front of me talking about how drunk they got the night before and how they were at some club with hot bitches...for some reason, I decided to keep standing on line and enduring this meathead blather.  THEN a pack of hoochied out girls with makeup caked on and trashy club attire cut me in line and joined the douche bags, and then it was another round of recanting how drunk they got the night before, were puking, etc. - which was believeable considering how tore up they looked.  I then looked behind me and there was a line of 30 or so people, many of them looking just like the annoying group in front of me, so needless to say, it was time for me to get the hell out of there, I mean I was traumatized enough!Yes, there are a lot of TVs and yes it is a good size BUT with the line, the kind of people and the loud house music pumping out of that place, I would not recommend it for seriously watching a game.  I never actually made it in so maybe I'd give it a try on another night, but probably not :)Famous last words: as a bouncer at another Hoboken bar said, "I wouldn't wish anyone to have to go to Wicked Wolf."  LMAO
2012-10-23,4,This has become a favorite to stop in for a drink after work. They have a lot of TVs (even ones in the booths away from the main bar area) which makes it a great place to watch the game. They also have great happy hour deals during the week.
2012-10-18,3,I went here several times when it first opened, mostly for girls' nights out/dancing, but had not been in a while until last night.My friend got a group happy hour deal, so it was $3 for various house drink options from 7-9PM.  Trivia started at 9.I had some of a friend's sweet potato fries (very good), the buffalo chicken salad (grilled chicken, which was a plus, though pretty thick pieces and not well done, as I had ordered), and the brownie sundae (supposed to be shared, which I did, but I could've eaten the whole thing).  The salad was tasty and a good size, though I had asked for dressing on the side and the greens had some sort of oil on them.  The sundae was awesome.  The brownie was hot and fresh and just the right texture.  I was pleasantly surprised at that one, since it was a post-four-drinks spontaneous type of order.All in all, the place is very sports bar-ish and doesn't have much of a vibe or ambiance besides that, really, so not the kind of place I'd normally go to.  However, the food is pretty good, so if you are planning to go there for a game or to have a few drinks, you don't have to be afraid of getting crappy bar food.*Note that if you do go for a happy hour deal, it would be good to either bring cash or stay til the end, as they only let us open one tab.  Though they told us we could divide the bill onto different cards at the end, I had to leave before the others in my group to catch a train, and I ended up PayPalling my friend so that she could contribute my share.
2012-08-26,4,I came into this place after a music festival across the street in the park and I was very impressed. The food was very tasty, and the service was even better. I gave it 5 stars because of the views, service, and food. My ONE complaint about this place, is that when it is time to convert the restaurant into a lounge/dancefloor, the bouncers come to your table and pound on it telling you to get up. That was my only turnoff, but other than that, I will definitely be back again.
2012-08-23,4,Good sports bar - with private mini tvs at your booth (you fancy, huh)! Larger tvs surround the bar, drink specials, affordable fun beer towers and good wings! That's pretty much your party pack for the games! When Texas A. is too crowded head over here, you won't be disappointed.
2012-08-19,3,I would actually give this place two . five stars. When I finally got my food after a 40 min wait, it was lukewarm at best. I ordered the pork sliders and though not hot, they were good and had a sweet sauce. The cole slaw was good and it came with onion rings.  I was a bit PO'd by the time my food arrived, think they lost my order as the people at the next table who ordered 15 min after me, were served and almost done with their meal by the time my arrived. No apology from the server, she tried to lie to me but I called her on it...it true "me" fashion. So I guess over-all you can't beat the location and the food is good. Although I arrived at 2:30 and was only offered the brunch menu and other diners were given a different one...guess it doesn't pay to be on your own, must have man in order to obtain good service....back to my traveling chip on the shoulder issue.
2012-08-16,2,I am a firm believer in second chances to food and in this case, I have.  My friend and I came here for dinner twice and both times, *thumbs down.*  Both food and service can be improved tremendously.  With this said, this is more of a sports bar - you come in for drinks and tolerate the bar food b/c let's be honest, you have the munchies when you're drunk.  Even as a sports bar, there are much better sports bars especially in Hoboken.  This place doesn't live up to the Hoboken standard.
2012-08-13,4,So I have always come here on weekends for a few brewskis but never tried the food. Okay, first off - this bar is an awesome spot on the weekend. Sometimes they have live bands, other times they have bumpin DJs, but it is always a good time & gets pretty packed. There's always dancing, as well as, tables to rest your dancin' shoes (: They show UFC fights so if you're a fan this is a good place to watch and drink -- but you won't be able to hear the commentary. Huge TV screens tho!Now the food... amazing! I had the Salmon Sliders - unbelievable. I've never had them before and they were really tasty and the salmon wasn't too dry or wild. My friend had the Buffalo Bites - really good & come as cute little cubes which were great for sharing. OH and did I mention the appetizers are 1/2 off during happy hour? Done deal. Definitely will come back for food, not just the booze.PS. They have outdoor seating and you have an incredible view of Midtown. Fantastic location.
2012-07-31,2,Went there on a Sunday late noon for a drink and some finger food.Con:ordered 12 piece wings, overcooked or precooked before and refriedtold the waitress Abby and she said" i don't cook the wings". Wings tasted like beef jerky, no more texture to the meat, no juice left.have to look for the waitress like looking for my kidsPro:good atmosphere inside and out, the food dropped it down to 2 starConclusion: How can you screw wings up?
2012-07-17,3,The Wicked Wolf is a solid bar in Hoboken.  Right out on the water, this is a nice little spot to come with friends for a bite to eat and a drink.  Later at night they move the tables and this place gets packed.  Kinda a standard "jersey" bar but still pretty good and you can't beat the location.  I give it an A-OK and if anything, it's worth it for a slow night / weekend to try out.
2012-07-14,4,I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this tavern. Since the description is a sports bar, I expected mediocre bar food and being shoved around by drunk Yankee fans. On the contrary, my pear salad was amazing, bathrooms were really clean, and I didn't get shoved by anyone! My only complaint is that our utensils came 10 mins after the food arrived.
2012-07-09,4,Wicked Wolf is a nice sports bar off the Hoboken waterfront. As I understand it, this is where folks from other parts of New Jersey come when they go out on the town in HoBo. Sure enough, visual confirmation was available on the big UFC fight night this past Saturday. Definitely a lot of Jersey types crowding this bar after the fight as the meatmarket butchers quickly turned their attention away from Silva-Sonnen to various young ladies who for some reason enjoy a sardine-can dance floor.The place itself is well managed. We had a very friendly and attentive waiter (short-cropped beard guy--flag him if you see him). My steak salad was OK--the beef was good, the salad rather dry. They do have Dogfish 60 minute and Victory Golden Monkey bottles, and I definitely took advantage of the $2 Sam Summers. They evn have smore toasting kits for $10, a great conversation piece.Good place to watch a game or compete with a circle of dudes in hitting on a female target. Not a good place for dates (unless in daytime), d/l nights, etc.
2012-06-05,4,Great sports bar.  Good live music bar.  Tons of huge TVs, great for watching games.  They'll usually change the channel to a specific game if you request.  The beer towers are a good deal for groups (or even 2 people, if it's that kind of a day).  It has decent bar food.  Good wings and other dishes for snacking during games.  The bartenders are pretty friendly.  They're generous with the pours, and I've been pleasantly surprised by the bar tab on a few occasions.  A good variety of beers on tap, and the specials aren't bad during the week.I've seen a few cover bands play here on Friday nights (especially Tramps Like Us...), and it's always great.  The bar is set up perfectly for bands to play and the sound is really good.  You can pretty much hear the band playing anywhere in the bar.I've even ordered take out wings for the Super Bowl 2 years in a row.  The wings are good, and you can a whole lot for the money.  They messed up my order the last time, but the hostess was really nice about it and I left not being angry (no more than my "normal" angry).All in all, it's a great bar.  And great views of the city.
2012-05-11,4,They have great happy hour specials and deals everynight.  For example, Wednesday is trivia and BOGO burgers night (and the burgers are better than most bar/pub burgers I've had).  And they have a great selection of draft beers.  It's a big, clean, space that is right on the water and it attracts a good crowd most nights.  All in all it's a solid bar/pub for sports, a weeknight dinner, or happy hour.
2012-05-01,2,Sports bar + fist pumping = Wicked Wolf.  It's definitely one of the happening places to be for Sunday football, especially for singles, but you really have to be into that kind of scene.  They have a good beer selection and good beer specials.  The food, in case you're interested, is greasy and heavy.  I'm not gonna lie, it can be a lot of fun if you get past the cheesiness, but there is only so much of it I can take.
2012-04-25,2,I'll give this place a two just because our server was nice.  I went in for lunch and ordered the pretzel sticks and a black and blue salad, medium rare.  The pretzel sticks didn't come out with the mustard, just a horrible cheese dip.  When I got my salad, I looked at the steak a bit warily.  It didn't look the right color (and I worked in a steakhouse all throughout college).  The center wasn't pink, but it didn't look like it was because it was over cooked.  I tasted a piece and almost gagged.  The person I was with tasted it too and spit it out.  The meat was bad--a weird grey color.  I sent it back and just got a plain salad.  The cook told her to tell us that I just didn't like the seasoning.  No.  That wasn't it.  I love a well cooked, seasoned steak.  I do not like to eat rotten meat.  I will never go back.  I should have gotten the wings apparently.
2012-04-07,3,Its all about the blackened chicken wrap with sweet potato fries. Done and done people. Have it once and one night you will wake up dreaming about it. It will happen. I highly recommend this place when Drop Dead Sexy performs there. I will say you can get better happy hour deals but that wrap makes this place. The fried pickles are pretty good and the buffalo bites are interesting. I havent tried the rest of the menu bc i just can't get over that wrap.
2012-04-05,3,ehhh...this place gets worse and worse each time....but one thing that will never change is great drinks and wings....And if you happen to see the bald black bartender, ask him for ron-ron juice.... it was an amazing drink - he won't tell you what is in it ... but it def. got to me.
2012-04-04,2,The table was filthy when we got seated, and we had to ask for it to be cleaned. Our waitress was not very nice and did not do a good job at all. She acted like we were bothering her by being there, and was one of those waitresses that didn't write down the order, and got a couple things wrong as a result. The burger I had was very good and cooked perfectly, and the prices were good, but I wouldn't return based on the service.
2012-03-27,3,When we were in Hoboken we eneded up on a pub crawl for breast cancer with some people that we met there. It an annual pubcrawl that they do every year, well we ended off the night here at wicked wolf. It was rammed packed and everyone was wickedly drunk lol. me nabbed a spot at the bar and snack on possibly the best wings ive ever had (and im a huge wing lover) and to boost the wings were only 50 cents each!!! i died and went to heaven i ate soooo many. But outside of that the service was meh and the rest of the food didnt look that amazing on the tables. it felt like i was back at my highschool pub, everyone knew everyone (except me) but we made the best of the time there and had a drunken ol time lol
2012-03-23,3,After four visits, it is time to share.  I wrestled with a 2 or 3 star review and decided on 3 because of location.  If this were anywhere else but sitting directly on the Hudson with the NYC skyline as a setting, 2 stars would have been the vote.  Except for the hot pretzels, which are amazing but overpriced, the food is at best mediocre.  Portions are adequate but no real wows on this menu.  Service rarely rises to mediocre with staff that knows neither the menu or the draft beer list without stepping away to check.  Food and beverage wait times are far too long without a crowd, I can only imagine when this place is busy.  Would i ever wait on line to enter? NO - there are too many places in Hoboken that serve better food and drink.  Given all this, I still enjoy myself each and every time because the setting and the crowd create an ambiance of enjoyment.  In short, go here expecting nothing exceptional but ready to have a good time.
2012-03-19,3,Great big somewhat spicy original style wings, decently string mixed drinks, great for watching a game but def (in my opinion) needs to work on its transition to more of a driving/dancing bar at night. It's not a fun place to be, vibe is awkward and music is not great and the crowd is a weird mix at night. But during the day for lunch or games it's great. Brunch menu is kinda limited.
2012-03-09,3,Their music selections were not befitting for my tastes at all - very sporadic and the speakers were in and out causing brief breaks of pure silence.  Okay to forgive if it happens once, but it happened multiple times in the hour that we were there.  Definitely a major mood-kill when the music stops and everyone stands around quite awkwardly waiting for the music to come back on.I think WW would be great on game day because they have a plethora of screens to watch the games, but I really would not recommend it as a late-night-out option.  Also, bartenders were really wishy-washy and not attentive.  There was a female bartender we kept trying to get the attention of (she had on the most adorable green skirt) and we wanted to know where she got it.  Multiple attempts to grab her attention were ignored and then we finally stepped in front of her to ask her the question (really shouldn't be that hard to ask a d*mn question).
2012-03-06,4,I really enjoy going here, it's great for game waching or just grabbing a drink. However, the past few times I've gone during the day (let's say 2ish on a Saturday/Sunday) they only have had their "brunch" menu available, which is just too limited.  I sat at the bar and my friend and I wanted to order nachos but it wasn't on the menu.  The bartender had even said how everyone hates that it's the only menu they have available during that time, so he let us and another group order off of the regular menu. I guess if it's not a Football Sunday Funday their normal menu is not applicable. Overall, I really do love the food and atmosphere here!
2012-03-05,5,Great Atmosphere. Sunday Bartender Mike was great. Beer towers and flat screens everywhere. Awesome time. Had the salmon sliders and hot wings. Both incredible.
2012-03-03,4,I really enjoy Wicked Wolf.  It has a great atmosphere and is a great place to watch any game.  They have $3 Happy Hour during the week until 7PM.  They have plenty of bar food options (wings, sliders, nachos, etc) and I've always had a good experience.  The staff is friendly and its always a good crowd.
2012-02-28,3,Was here yesterday...The place is a cool lil spot...Great for mid-day lunches....Cool for groups/ Outdoor seating in warmer weather.On the menu:The coconut shrimp was pretty good...The margarita was okay...I'll try some wings next time...I wish it was a different decor inside, so I can really feel like I'm in a sports bar...The glass windows makes it feel diner-like and the ceiling is hideous.......This place has so much potential if some renovation takes place.Overall, a cool lil spot, but just ordinary.....
2012-02-03,3,Eh, oh, bada bing bada boom.  Jersey Shore, eat your friggin heart out.  Why go all the way there when you can get that here, at the Wicked Wolf Tavern!!!  I love this place.  Solid 100% rowdy but classy Jersey crowd, to the core.  Didn't see any meat or juice heads, but I went there in winter, so maybe that'll change when the weather gets warm.This place boast a tremendous micro brew selection.  TVs galore, so never miss a sports match.  Good looking crowd too, especially the scantily clad bartendresses.  Bada bing bada boom, I love this place.  Do it!
2012-01-03,4,...was here every other day during Fall 2011........since then it has been my favorite bar in Hoboken!......their wings and beer towers keeps me going be when im with friends or even a few times when i was alone.......love the place, music, game nights,service....Cheers Wicked!
2011-12-31,4,I only went here because I had a half off livingsocial coupon, but was really impressed in the quality of food, and the the great sports watching environment.  I'm definetely making this my place to watch the game in the future with a livingsocial or not.  Oh, I don't know about the nightlife and all, strictly talking about sports watching
2011-12-28,4,I've been to Wicked Wolf about 4 or 5 times now, and enjoyed myself each time.  The place is loaded with flat screen tv's so a variety of sporting events.  Da Wolf offers a bunch of specials and deals.  The guys went recently for trivia night and had a great time.  The trivia guy was a cool dude and made the event very entertaining.  During trivia they spin a wheel for drink specials for each round.  The food there is pretty good too.  Chicken fingers, bangin'!  Yeah I eat the fingers like a little kid, but so what?  People rave about the wings there, mild is good with a nice kick to them.  Wicked Wolf overall is a great sports bar.  And what is sports bar without hot waitresses wearing itty bitty football jerseys...yeah they got them too!  Good food, good drinks, a lot of tv's, cool location down on the water, hot waitresses (excluding the mild-aged wierdo who gave us shitty service), a clear cut place to recommend to others.
2011-12-27,2,Although the beer is reasonably priced, Wicked Wolf is always very crowded and does not keep an accurate online schedule of what their activites might be that night. My friends and I went on a Wednesday, being told they were doing trivia. When I got there, I asked what the activity was and they said karaoke. A friend looked up online and it said bar bingo... It ended up being karaoke for a competition they had been running for a few weeks and we had to leave before karaoke for anyone else actually started. Additionally, wings were ordered and when I took a bite out of one, it looked like little hairs were all attached to the wing. This is when my friend informed me that these were feathers and the wings were probably not de-feathered properly. Normally the apps are okay, but this really turned me off and I didn't have another.I would only go to Wicked Wolf to drink, and be sure you bring a coat in the winter because you might have to wait on a looooong line.
2011-12-21,1,Most times I've been here I've had a decent time, but was treated very rudely by the manager during the trivia night a few months ago.  We won a tower of beer as a prize, ordered it from the waiter, and were billed for it on our tab.  Apparently the brand of beer we had ordered was not included in the free prize options,  but that was never mentioned to us.   When we tried to explain the situation to the manager, he was extremely rude.  The correct response would have been to not make us pay for it that time, while explaining which brands were included for the future.  Instead the manager chose to argue with us about it, and only after a ton of back and forth did he finally fix our tab. . He also pointed at us and made some snide comments to the bartender as we walked out.  We used to go there every week but haven't been back since.  Have never been treated so disrespectfully by a manager.
2011-12-02,5,So this bar has turned themselves around over the past year or so.  Been coming here on Sundays for Football.  Having a blast and service is great.  Have to thank Brit and Carol Ann.  They do a great trivia night on Wed and I keep seeing a painting and drinking class which I've been meaning to check out.  Great view over looking the city skyline.
2011-11-12,5,awesome food,drinks,service and great location! i'm a repeat customer
2011-11-11,1,I came here because I had a groupon or living social deal for  2 burgers and 2 brews.  I ordered my burger medium rare and my girlfriend got hers medium.  Well, when we finally got our food 30 minutes later, hers was well done and mine was beyond well done.  The onion rings were super greasy and unappetizing.  I would never eat here again.  This place is good for drinks and that's it.
2011-10-25,4,Great, clean sports bar with a killer view. WW is right on Sinatra Dr so the only thing between u and the Hudson River is the road and riverwalk. There is outdoor seating so this would be an amazing to-go spot to watch any game during the warmer months.  Last week the place was jam PACKED for the Giants game...but hey, it's Big Blue :) Last night I was there for MNF and there was a decent young professional crowd, but it wasn't crazy.  They have a great selection of the standard tap beers but also some interesting seasonal brews (raspberry wheat, pumpkin ale and apricot wheat).  Monday is 50-cent wing night so we loaded up for the guys. Favors are the usual mild/med/hot buffalo, BBQ and teriyaki...sorry, no waiver-required atomic levels.  The wings were actually some of the better ones I've had in town.  Usually a Black Bear wing patron, but these wings were larger, crispier and had better overall flavor.  My new usual :)
2011-10-10,3,Nice new location just opened up this year. Very clean. They have a ton of TVs, but be warned they get extremely packed on game days!!!!!! They always have specials on drinks and on food.
2011-10-02,3,Saturday Night you can expect:A long line out frontAn extremely sticky floorLines for men's and women's bathroomsLot's of Whitney HoustonSurprisingly attentive and accommodating bartendersDecidedly Jersey crowd. Not my ideal Saturday Night (a sports bar turned into a club) but I somehow had a really good time.  Been there twice and had positive experience both times.
2011-09-29,4,Great place to watch sports, food is pretty decent, just get rid of the guidos and we're at 5 stars in my book.
2011-09-21,5,After the management change at Wicked Wolf, the entire picture has changed. Service is great.  We had a great time at our latest drinks evening. Specially Chris and Alyssa have been wonderful.Also, the prices are really good and its at the best location. Don't have to think anymore - any time we want to for drinks - WW is the place!!
2011-09-13,2,i have been to Wicked Wolf several times for all types of occasions. Birthdays, football Sunday's and happy hour. The food is decent and they offer good drink specials. They have over 25 tv's so its also a great place to watch sports. However the BIG problem with this location (hence the 2 stars) is the people who work here. I have never experience such terrible customer service then here. The bar is always understaffed so the wait for a drink is ridiculous. This wouldn't be such an issue if they were so rude. The hostess, bouncer, and management were just as rude. They were not accommodating and basically had a "if you don't like it, go elsewhere" attitude. While out for an birthday party on a Saturday night, 3 separate employees bumped into me while i was standing by the bar and spilled my drink. Not even an apology. I understand it is a bar and it does get crowded but this was completely unnecessary.Its a shame that this place has such terrible service as it is in a great location and could have the potential to stand out in Hoboken. As of right now there are other great sports bars in Hoboken so I wont waste my time here anymore.
2011-09-11,2,Yup!  As I expected, Wicked Wolf still kinda sucks...I was tasked with suggesting a bar in Hoboken where we could take an older out-of-town'er, eat, and watch football.  I came up with a few but they opted for the WW, likely because it was down on the waterfront.  I won't capture all of the boring details here but there's a few things that makes this place still lame:  - Our waitress was clearly in trouble as the manager/hostess kept coming over to ask if she'd been by- It became relatively clear why our waitress was in trouble once she started serving us- Our tower of beer came with scalding hot glasses and the cup of ice I asked for try to rectify that situation (since the waitstaff didn't want to) came out after the beer was all gone- They are out of everything...If you're a sports bar, people will be drinking beer.  Update your darn draft list.  And another suggestion...don't have mushroom swiss burgers on the menu if you don't have any mushrooms- The volume (of either a game or music) in this place requires conversation to be screamedBottom line? Sports bars are a dime a dozen in Hoboken.  Go elsewhere.
2011-09-07,4,After coming back to this bar time and time again I had to bump up my review.  I've eaten here a few times and the food is always good.  You won't find anything extravagant but who needs to, you're at a bar!A new thing Wicked Wolf is doing is giving away $2 Happy Hour events.  These are AWESOME.  Just beware that "$2 domestics" actually mean $2 cheap domestics.  I hate when bars do that.You normally won't pay a cover but if a band is playing you will.  Don't worry, the bands typically are worth the price of admission.
2011-08-31,4,You can't beat the Happy Hour here. I don't care who you are or what you want... $3 for all drafts, house wines, and well drinks M-F, 4-7pm. It works and it's gonna keep working. Other than Happy Hour, it can get a little too Jersey up in here... fist pumping at it's finest, to say the least. However, it's clean, it's a good value, and the staff are, for the most part, friendly and good at their jobs. Ooooh, and one of the bar tenders definitely has a heavy pour on those well drinks...
2011-08-07,3,The Quasar has no sense of direction and an awful sense of timing despite the fact that he has a GPS and wears a semi-fancy watch with a face that you could probably read from the moon. One fateful evening we decided to meet up for dinner like normal folks do. Foolish, I know. Not knowing that the crepe spot on Sinatra Drive had closed, I told him to meet me there at 7pm. Almost 60 minutes pass by as I languish in the heat, watching parking spaces disappear, young urban professionals bike and jog by in the hopes of staving off Father Time and feel my blood pressure rise as I knew the night would start out this way. Eventually, he calls to say that he doesn't know where I am, but the GPS led him somewhere and he's already parked. Genius, I say, you're far. Perplexed, he gets back into his car before I finish talking and somehow he finds his way to me... about twenty minutes later. I was ready to go home five minutes ago. Patience is a virtue, Michelle, patience is a virtue. Disappointed in the closing of our intended location, we walk down the street and find ourselves at the Wicked Wolf.The hostess was extremely perky (no, I didn't see her nipples) and sprite. Lucky for us, the place wasn't too packed. The TVs were only showing two things: a hockey game and some sort of congressional hearing, I kid you not! We chose to sit at a booth showing the hockey game. God bless those people that got stuck at a table showing the hearing. Anyway, the menu is standard American fare. I wasn't expecting to be wowed. I knew walking in here the kind of food that I was going to be getting. It's 2011, who goes out to eat and doesn't check the menu of the restaurant before they get there? We ordered nachos, a burger (custom made) and a cheesesteak wrap. If memory serves me, we destroyed the nachos. He killed his burger and I put a light dent in my wrap. Everything was completely enjoyable, nothing to complain about, nothing to write home about either. I think I like saying Wicked Wolf the best. It makes me feel gnarly.
2011-08-02,4,We didn't have anything to eat but the cocktail seemed to contain a bit more alcohol than ones served at most places.  Wait - now come to think of it, we DID eat.  He had a panini with Portabella mushroom, spinach, goat cheese.  I had a salad with slices of steak.  They were very good.  Steak came out as I asked for.  They serve beer in a blender-like 'tower' (like mini keg) with a smaller tube which contains full of ice cubes in the middle of it so your beer won't become warm or watery.  Some people must have seen it before but we had never seen it.  They were celebrating "Christmas in July" with full Christmas decoration and wait staff was also dressed like Santa Claus.  Situated by the Hudson River, right in between two pier-parks in Hoboken, overlooking lower Manhattan.  Service was nice and very friendly.
2011-07-31,4,The food is decent. Good atmosphere. Good selection of beers which changes seasonally. Good, friendly service. Seems like a good place to just chill out and watch the game. During the week from time to time they have trivia night and karaoke which is always fun. This is certainly one of my go-to places in Hoboken.
2011-07-28,4,A definite surprise.  I came here just for a drink and ended up with a pitcher of sangria and dinner.  It could have been because of the gorgeous night and outdoor seating but either way the paninis were yummy and the appetizers were delicious.I will definitely come back again.
2011-07-26,2,Every time I walk by, this place is PACKED, and I was dying to go in. So I finally made it over to the bar on a Saturday night....and was disappointed. The DJ was pretty awful. If you venture over here, make sure to bring a group of friends.I somehow ended up getting free Jager bombs from one of the bartenders, so make sure you girls find him!!
2011-07-21,5,I really liked this place. We sat at the bar and had a few drinks and apps. The bartender was super friendly and attentive. The drinks were delicious and came in nice big glasses. It was my fiance and my first time coming here (because we live further uptown) but we will definitely go back.
2011-07-13,2,I came here with a friend on a beautiful Saturday afternoon in search of an outdoor venue to indulge in one of our favorite sunny weather pasttimes: day drinking.Situated close to the Hudson not too far from the PATH and Pier A, Wicked Wolf seemed like the perfect venue. One of my coworkers comes here quite frequently and often sees the Manzo boys (for you Real Housewives fans, apparently Thursday is your target night).However, we were quickly disappointed. For one, when we walked in, there was no one at the hostess stand. We took this as an invitation for self-seating, but were quickly corrected by a waitress. As she glanced over to see the hostess texting in a nearby booth, she agreed to clean a table and seat us. Good start (minus one).We got a table outside (plus one...we're even). However, we proceeded to sit. Then we sat a little longer. Then after several minutes, Mr. Dearth of Personality came to wait on us...let's just say it might have been one of the more painful social interactions I've had with a human (minus like 25 on the score card).To summarize in brief here, the service is atrocious. Our beers were cold, but took forever to come. The food, in their defense, was slightly better than we were expected given the odds, but this did little to remedy the fact the enjoyment factor had plummeted thanks to the poor service...The quest to find the venue for Operation Day Drinking in Hoboken forges on...
2011-07-12,4,I like this bar because it's nice to sit on the patio and look out to the water. Great for people watching and close to a other bars. The sangria is good and only $15 for a pitcher during happy hour. My boyfriend and I both had paninis that were delicious. The sesame vinaigrette dressing was great on my side salad. The only thing that sucked was the waiter. It wasn't particularly busy, but everything took forever. And he yelled at a lady sitting a table over. But hopefully he's the only bad seed and the other servers are more attentive. I'm definitely planning to go back and try the wings. They smelled amazing!
2011-06-24,2,Went there during happy hour for the $3 well and $3 draft drinks. The beer and drinks are great.The appetizers we ordered were great (Nachos and Hummus). I'd rate the food, but the waiter never asked for our food order, even though we told him earlier we'd be ordering food AND served us appetizers. This is just as well, as the place became *LOUD* and waaaay overcrowded. I know a bar isn't going to be quiet, but I shouldn't have to shout to someone next to me like I'm at a rock concert to talk to them. I also know bar's get crowded, but when *everyone* who walks past is bumping into you, that's too crowded for my tastes.Based on this service, I'd suggest going there for the drinks specials and not much else.Pros: Happy Hour drink specialsCons: *LOUD*             Overcrowded             Waiter never asked for food order
2011-06-18,3,I think everyone has already said it ....Good place to hang with friends for some drinks. The food is okay - average - nothing too crazy - typical bar food. The staff was amazing! Attentive and Friendly!
2011-06-15,1,Earlier in the day, a fellow food lover and I were talking about many restaurants with waterfront locations have jacked up prices with poor quality food. Low and behold, we found ourselves at Wicked Wolf Tavern confirming what we already knew... this kind of place sucks!After waiting 25 minutes for my food I received a cold ass burger with some cold ass french fries... and when I sent it back I was served the EXACT SAME FRIES, now 2x as crispy....no good people. I understand food costs but jesus... can you just give a brother some new fries?!?!?!
2011-06-15,3,Went to the Wicked Wolf for Sunday brunch. I liked the place. It was a beautiful day so it was great to eat and drink by the waterfront. The Yankees game was on and  I love that there were plenty of tv's so no one could miss out on what was going on no matter where you were seated at the table. Food was pretty good, although it's hard to mess up scrambled eggs. But the prices were great and we were really enjoying ourselves with our $10 pitchers of mimosas and bloody marys.... until they sat two tables next to us with screaming children. I know the ill-behaved children are not the establishment's fault but seriously kids do not belong in a sports BAR which is what I assumed the Wicked Wolf Tavern was. Two of them were literally running around and I saw them pick up plates off an unseated table and lick them!! I'm sure it's a touchy subject in Hoboken with all the young families that live here and that Wicked Wolf can not afford to turn away their business but when the kids start to affect other patrons' experiences (i.e. contaminating unused flatware) a manager needs to step in... Will try again but will prob sit at the bar which is hopefully a kid-free zone.
2011-06-09,3,Another Hoboken bar and grill with an identity crisis. Wicked Wolf, are you a sports bar? Are you a dance club? Are a place where those have had a bit too much on a Saturday night sway awkwardly while trying to contain all the alcohol within them? I honestly do not know.If you're going to go here, arrive during the early end of the happy hour. Grab a table with friends, order the cheap appetizers, the $3 drafts, and have a grand old time. Once the music starts to come on, things get weird and the DJ switches songs without any seeming rhyme (GET IT?!) or reason. I just don't think Wicked Wolf has found its place yet. Wicked, I hardly knew ye.
2011-06-05,3,There's nothing really wrong with Wicked Wolf, but I think you can do better in Hoboken. It's still fairly new, so it's still pretty clean, and the happy hour specials are pretty great.The draft beer selection is pretty standard, but not nearly as extensive as the selection at 1 Republik.The food is decent, but you can definitely get much better bar food at Black Bear.Overall, definitely not a bad place to grab a drink, but if you're looking to hang out for a while somewhere in Hoboken, there are two better options just a few blocks away.
2011-05-28,3,This place is actually a sports bar. Lots of tvs, lots of beer and lots of noise. Today was a soccer game so the noise levels at Wicked Wolf were unbearable. I did like my turkey burger. And their buffalo wings were awesome.  And the service was great. I wanted to order a cocktail and they didn't have much of a drink menu besides beer and frozen drinks. So I just ordered something simple like vodka pineapple.Its a great place to hang with friends and watch a good game but wouldn't recommend for a special night out with a date.
2011-05-20,1,I tried to buy a $100 gift certificate for this place to give to a friend who lives in Hoboken.  Unfortunately, this bar is run by idiots and despite having several phone calls with various staff and managers, and despite me faxing over all my personal information (driver's license, credit card number, photocopies) they were unable to actually create and send me a gift certificate.  But at least they called me to tell me that....wait, or not.  So I spend two weeks waiting for the stupid thing to arrive in the mail only to find out that these morons never bothered to do it.  Thanks but I'll give my business to someone else now.
2011-05-15,1,I've visited several times and despite the beautiful view of the city, this place isn't inspired enough to provide an eating or drinking experience that befits the setting.1. Mediocre food 2. Unreliable service, once fast but abrasive; another time completely ignored (during a happy hour); another time the server was very friendly.3. Weird floor plan and lighting; something is just off about the mood of this place. It strives for pub-cozy but delivers generic. Of the three reasons listed above it's mostly the unreliable service that keeps me from returning. I can get pub food anytime from anywhere. I don't need to risk being ignored or rushed to score a burger or wrap.
2011-05-03,3,On another quest for food with my boo, I chose Wicked Wolf after a serious debate on what we were eating, hah. So we took a lovely stroll over (the walk along the water is always nice), and upon approaching the place, I noticed A LOT of noise, and soon realized Tuesday's are Karaoke Nights! I'm not much of a fan, but we went inside anyway.We were seated away from the singing, but we were put in an extremely dim-lit area by the bar, and it was hard to read our menus. When my eyes finally adjusted, I decided on the Southwestern Burger for my entrée, and my boyfriend and I split their original nachos.The nachos were OK- it was difficult to get the topping on the chips and I felt like I was making a mess of myself as we worked through the plate. It was also obvious they microwave the cheese on because the chips were glued to the sides of the plate with burnt cheese crisps (as an avid home nacho and cheese obsessor, I can spot the signs), so that kinds messed up the texture of the chips. I really liked the chili on top though, and the jalapeños too.The burger was good, but there was A LOT of BBQ sauce all over it, and again I felt a bit messy, but it was still yummy so I won't be a hater. The fries were a little cold too, but it's whatevs, it's just a filler side anyway.For Hoboken, the prices are great for the food, but I think the next time I come here I'll come for the Happy Hour drink specials.
2011-05-02,5,Probably my favorite Hoboken bar to relax at with some friends on a weeknight.  Scratch that, it's definitely my favorite bar for a weeknight drink.The bartenders are awesome.  They're always friendly, and they know how to make a solid Ketel One and soda.  They'll even get up and sing with you on karaoke night if you ask nicely!  The happy hour specials are a great deal, and they've always got something going on (wings on Mondays, karaoke on Tuesdays, trivia on Wednesdays... you get the idea).  While the food isn't anything to brag about, it's not terrible either.  The buffalo bites are great, and I have yet to be let down by the burgers.As others have noted, the view of NYC is amazing.  The entire wall facing the Hudson is floor to ceiling windows.  There are plenty of TVs around, so it's a great place to catch a game.  On top of that, the bar is fairly large, and there's a lot of open space, so it can hold quite a few people before it starts getting crowded.All-in-all I think Wicked Wolf is a great mix of everything you want in a bar: the bartenders are the best, there are always a lot of people there (but it's not too crazy during the week), and the prices are very reasonable.
2011-04-30,3,pros-great location and view on the Hoboken waterfront-good drink specials ($10 unlimited bloody mary's and mimosas during brunch? I'm in)cons-they don't seem like they're trying very hard with the food, definitely blah even for bar food-maybe because it's new, the place has a generic feel to it- kind of like drinking at a Target or something
2011-04-29,2,Well I'm not from the area but have been in quite a few of the restaurants and bars around, and i know this place is one of the best for watching a sporting event. When it comes to food though this is one of the worst. Great Bar, fantastic patio with a great view of the water and city from across the bay. The rating is only a 2 because the food is that bad. So get a drink here before or after you go to dinner somewhere else. Oh and the music or tv sound is always way too loud!!! So dont try to  have a conversation here.
2011-04-26,4,Having been here a few times, I can say that the food is basic but tasty.  Our servers have all been friendly and very helpful. The fourth star was earned by the great prices and convenient downtown waterfront location. The fifth star was lost because it gets so loud (not due to the sports-bar nature of this venue, but more to the poor acoustics).  I would definitely recommend this spot only during off-peak hours if you want to hear what others are saying, but would recommend it any time to watch a game or have a few drinks and a tasty snack.
2011-04-21,4,Good bar to grab a drink with a couple friends.  Hit or miss on weekends with a very typical jersey shore crowd at nights.  Food is very good though and bartenders are friendly.
2011-04-17,4,Great bar and great business ethics.  Lots of buybacks and friendly staff.  One thing bad is one of the door guys, the tall spanish looking guy with short hair.  He is a jerk and has been fired from many other bars in town for being a jerk.  Other than him the place is a great place for food and drink.  Really good trivia nights and a good place for a party.
2011-04-16,3,came here on a friday and cover band drop dead sexy was performing, and while they may not be drop dead sexy, but they were dropping some pretty good covers! with songs from blondie, bon jovi, proclaimers (500 miles), cheaptrick, the obligatory "sweet caroline", and and even some hip hop, this band knows how to gauge crowd interest & please! it seemed like every cover was a hit, and they managed to make each song their own. i was definitely sold on wicked wolf through them! and funny thing is, we found out the lead singer, Paul, went to college with one of our friends like 6 yrs ago! so random!as for the rest of the bar, there's lots of room, the one entire wall is floor to ceiling windows facing the river so you get a sense of even more openness. there is plenty of space to dance (they played some pretty good hip hip/top40 after the cover band left) and they don't kick you out at 145a....lights didn't come one until 215-230a! all in all i had a great time here. if i lived closer (ues here =/ ) i wouldn't mind coming back!
2011-04-15,4,friendly service, although they didnt accept the yelp check in discount when i checked in. a little dissappointed at that. otherwise great ambience.
2011-04-05,3,This place is very big and spacious.  However, it just means you can pack more people inside.  I met up with a friend on a Saturday night and this place was PACKED!  Could barely move from the entrance to the other side of the bar.  Luckily there was no cover, and this place has a beautiful view of the NYC skyline, especially at night.LOUD LOUD music - I only stayed there for an hour, and by the time I left, my ears were ringing.Cranberry vodka drink tasted mostly like vodka and syrup.  Not impressed!Also was not impressed by the types of people that were here... I'm sure you've heard of the out-of-towners that flood Hoboken bars.  Yep, this one is no exception.I'll come back more often and refine this review more.  Until then, I'm kind of neutral on this place.
2011-04-02,4,Usually good happy hour specials, good for watching games and decent  cowrd food is decent as well however it is usually very crowded
2011-03-28,4,A great place to watch a game.While the food has been far from consistent, it is a good space with decent bartenders and lots of specials.  Tons of TVs.Give it a try next time you're looking for a sports bar.
2011-03-12,3,It's aiming to be a sports bar and for that it largely succeeds. Although to be honest, I try to go only when there isn't a big sporting event going on because it does get pretty loud and crowded and 9 times out of 10, I'm not interested in what's being shown. On the flip side, the booths have their own television on the wall so you can watch whatever you want, of course as long as you score a booth.Happy hour is quite reasonable, particularly that ALL drafts are $3 until 8p. The Mac & Cheese bites are a good app, however they are quite small so your five bites for five dollars is of average value at best.I've tried a few of the wraps and all are of good quality. You have your pick of a typical American menu so not a lot of risks and surprises. Overall you can count on the predictability of Wicked Wolf with little chance that your expectations will not be met.
2011-02-24,3,Good atmosphere and a good place to watch a game.  The food was typical bar food, nothing to write home about, but it can hold its own.  The bartender was great and was able to find me a logo'd glass to add to my collection.  I'll swing by again.
2011-02-21,4,sunday brunch: an extensive menu (everything was extremely delicious, especially the pancakes!!!) with the option of $10 all you can drink mimosas & bloody marys until 4PM (what?!?!?!?!). this was my first time eating here so brunch was my go-to and i will absolutely be a returning customer for that- shout out to greg who was our stellar waiter! i'll be back to update my review on their happy hour menu (M-F 4-7P, $5 for various fried foods) as well as a possible night on the hoboken town. but for now, my review stands as pure excellence. plus, there's something to be said about an establishment that gives you options (chips, pita, toasted breads, etc) for your spinach dip... a-maaaaa-zingggggg! sidenote: the best place to watch a game, for you can't turn your head without seeing at least two large HDTVs in your eyesight.
2011-02-10,2,Great view of city on the water. good for outdoor seating. Lots of TVs and great for watching sports and drinking beer. The food was not good at all! Service was okay. Would only go back to watch sports and drinks beers.
2011-02-10,3,It's a local Hoboken bar - it's not bad - nice looking inside - food was only ok.  Not my usual crowd but i was meeting some friends there.The TVs were on - loud and almost couldn't hear myself think.  We were on a Wednesday which is Trivia night.  3 rounds of 3 questions, that they announce - and they give out raffles as well...WOOT i won the Mark Sanchez Jersey!! Fun night - but mostly b/c of my friends - as for the food - meh...it was ok...as for drinks - prices were pretty good.  Ambiance was a bar - 'nuff saidTL;DR: "A Bar...'Nuff Said", It was fun b/c of the people I was with.
2011-02-09,4,i've been here twice, not a complaint to report from either visit. most recently i went on a monday night and it was 2 for 1 drafts, as well as 2 for 1 apps. we didnt get any apps, but 2 blue moons for $5 is pretty amazing. i did order my burger medium and it came out well done, but that doesnt necessarily bother me. also, i like the sweet potato fries as an option, not sure how i feel about having to pay $1.50 extra for them, though. i'll go back.
2011-02-06,3,great aesthetics and atmosphere. lots of TVs for sports fans. good beer selection - Sam Adams cherry wheat, Leinenkugel, Magic Hat, and so on on tap. really spacious, bright, and clean.there seems to be an odd disconnect between the atmosphere here and the clientele. it's much like Black Bear, where it's really a sports bar/grill, but then you get the crowd of people that's too lazy to try to get into a club, but decked out too nicely to be in a sports bar.fairly packed on a Friday, but not to the point that you couldn't move, and we actually scored a table too.fuck it, I'd return.
2011-02-05,4,After reading the reviews I was excited to try this place but still a little skeptical. Glad I went! This place was a good find for my husband & I. They have a variety of Sandwiches/Burgers/Wraps and some good salads. He had a Chicken Club Sandwich and I had a Blackened Chicken Wrap, both with substituted Sweet Potato fries. Both were really good, and the fries were prefect. The waiter was helpful and even after slightly messing up my order he fixed it immediately and made sure I was happy.   We will be going here again for a good easy meal!
2011-02-03,1,extremely poor management.  tried to get table during football game, was told i would be called back and wasnt.  after several attempts to reach someone and check in on the status i decidedd to give my money to pourhouse instead.  much better choice.  this place was fun when it first opened and is slowly going down hill.  unattentive staff and less then good food.
