2021-09-29,5,Finally! A decently priced, great tasting coffee  Their small iced coffee is quite big (16oz) and is only $2.50 (+ $0.25 for non dairy milk). Did I mention it tastes great too? Not as strong as Starbucks and there is no acidic taste. Highly recommend.
2021-09-17,5,Im an avid coffee shop explorer- this one is my favorite. I moved out of hoboken and sometimes i make the drive up here just to come. The Massala chai is amazing, by far my favorite (ask for that kind specifically.) the pastries and cakes are delicious, and i love the atmosphere in the back with nice windows and seating, as well as a backyard. Would recommend!
2021-07-07,5,I do love Jefferson's Americano! This is the best Americano I have ever tasted! And so many thanks to my friend Jade who fetched it through Fetchstr app and earned $8. This amazing app allows me to easily drink my favorite coffee. apps.apple.com/us/app/fe...
2021-06-12,4,We ordered a coffee, London Fog, and two matcha lattes, and they were good. The staff were friendly, and the drinks were made quickly; although the case we had to pay extra for sweetener, which was a bit annoying since none of the drinks had sweetener; which is a bit odd for a matcha latte and London fog. Although the case, it was still good, giving it four stars.
2021-04-25,5,Best dirty turmeric latte in town! I suggest it with the oat milk. Super friendly and they make their drinks with love
2021-04-22,5,One of my favorite coffee shops in the neighborhood! They have the most friendly baristas! They also give discounts for students! House made cold brew is my favorite!
2021-04-22,2,Large mocha latte skim milk. I don't usually order mochas but this drink didn't really taste like anything. The mocha flavor was super faint. The espresso flavor was faint and bitter. Pistachio cookie was really strong flavor. It was soft. But I wouldn't recommend it and I wouldn't reorder. Last time, I got a latte and I was unimpressed by the bitter taste. I also got a slice of almond pound cake and it was crumbly and hard and stale. The only good thing about this place rn is the indoor seating. The first rule is don't order any bakery items. Period. The second rule is don't order a drink here unless you have to.
2021-04-03,4,Great spot for coffee and pastries. I've been to this place a few times. The Turkish pistachio cookie is so good, highly recommend getting ordering that with your coffee.
2021-03-12,5,Tried their oat milk latte and omg, the coffee was so good. It's been awhile since I drank coffee from a shop, and I can honestly say, that I missed really good coffee.
2021-02-28,3,Jefferson's is great for coffee and their small pastries they serve. I've never had an issue with tasty coffee and always end up with the Nitro or Cold Brew. The small pound cakes and scones that they sell in their case are always fresh. There is ample seating inside and tables are spread out, but my girlfriend and I had an issue when a woman did not heed the six feet rule right. We were sitting in the back of the shop and all tables were taken. The long table behind me was being used by a man, but he was at the end of the table. A woman comes into the back, takes a chair that wasn't being used, and places it on the side of the long table and sits a almost on top of me. I thought we had to socially distant? My girlfriend and I felt uncomfortable and left. Wish this place would do a better job policing the customers.
2021-02-13,5,This is one of the best coffee shops in Hoboken. Me and my friend visited and we fell in love with this place right away. The staff is super super nice and professional. The space is clean and spacious. And... please try almond croissant. This is the best almond corissant ever in my whole life!
2021-01-12,4,Cute coffee shop in one of my favorite cities. I ordered the specialty Turkish coffee (karffe?) and wasn't impressed. That's my own personal preference that I can not hold against Jefferson's. The reason I give it a 4 is because we also ordered a mocha latte which was just ehhh. They used syrup mocha powder which I am not a fan of.
2021-01-09,2,Came here for a mocha latte, the coffee itself wasn't bad but I didn't get a very noticeable mocha flavor. From what I could tell the shop uses a pre purchased syrup, not a house made mix.
2020-09-21,5,Excellent coffee, excellent staff, great prices. Will be back for sure. They have a nice menu of very diverse coffee and hot chocolate drinks, as well as freshly baked treats. Also, there's a rewards system when you pay by credit card!
2020-07-19,4,Cute cafe and excellent coffee! Clean/socially distant compliant operations. I found customer service delightful - I was contemplating getting iced coffee or cold brew and asked about a few of the options on the board. She was informative and generous enough to let me try the Kyoto Cold Brew! I ultimately ended up with my classic choice of a hot cappuccino but that well made! I'm definitely looking forward to stopping by here again and trying more items off their menu!
2020-02-25,5,Since I spend a lot of time in Hoboken, I've been making it my business to try all the local coffee spots. Well once I tried Jefferson's coffee I stopped my search LOL very cute and very delicious. Staff is always extremely friendly. This is the perfect place for a pick me up or to even sit and study, read, etc. The cappuccinos are killer!
2020-02-23,5,Great prices, local, great little vegan or gluten free options. I also think they make wonderful lattes!
2020-02-09,5,My go-to coffee place in the area. I'll stop in to fill up my tumbler before heading out for the day or even stop in to grab a coffee while waiting for my bagel order across the street. They are usually very fast inside, especially if you're just ordering a regular coffee. Plus they have a bunch of non-dairy milk options and gluten free and vegan baked goods.
2019-12-30,5,Given that Hoboken has a ton of coffee options, I have to say Jefferson is one of the best.  Their coffee is decently priced and is always great.  I haven't had their pastries yet but they look delicious. Their staff is always friendly and helpful.  In terms of ambience, Jefferson's has a cute little back section with a few tables and free wifi.  It is the perfect place to study, work, or catch up with a friend.
2019-10-21,4,Excellent coffee. Friendly service. Good location on Washington Street. There are several good coffee shops in Hoboken, but you won't go wrong at Jefferson's.
2019-09-08,5,Great coffee, quick service and everyone behind the counter is always so kind. There are a few small tables inside to sit at and the vibe is calm and relaxing. I will definitely be back.
2019-09-02,4,Excellent coffee, good espresso, friendly staff, cute decor. I wish I could give 5 stars but the mug I had my coffee in had a ring at the bottom. It was not just a stain I could see it dissolving into my coffee. I tipped well I don't understand why they couldn't have scrubbed it off before pouring my coffee or just grabbed another cup instead. I might go back for a take away but they really should clean their cups better.
2019-08-24,5,What a great little place. The coffees are simply delicious! The perfect amount of sweetness, the beautifully crafted latte's and espresso. Definitely a place I would re-visit.
2019-08-21,5,Great place, the staff is always friendly and helpful. Coffee is very good! I like their choice of vegan/gf treats!
2019-07-09,5,Love this place! Huge and interesting drinks selection. The strawberry rhubarb tea was great. Lots of room and outlets in the back for getting work done. Great service too!
2019-05-11,5,Cute coffee shop on Wash! They have your standard coffee menu along with some pastries and snacks, including just 1-2 prepackaged gluten free options. There is a seating area with tables in the back- good for getting some work done! The baristas are very friendly. Love thei cappuccino with oat milk.
2019-02-23,4,Really great little coffee shop! Moving from Seattle a few months ago and spending years as a barista myself I've been struggling to find a good shop and was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled across Jefferson's. Barista was kind and knowledgeable and the wide variety of alternative milks and GF/Vegan food options was great! The shots were a bit burnt but the rest of our order was delicious.
2019-02-22,5,Great coffee every time we come in! I love the dairy free options! They have macadamia nut milk. It's my favorite. The coffee itself is great! I would say this place is second to choc o pain's latte. I come here pretty often now. The maple flavor latte is incredible. Love everything I've tried here! Coffee itself is roasty and delicious. Foam is good too! Price is comparable to Starbucks for specialty drinks. They have a small and a large cup. Love the designs on the lattes too. Staff is always friendly. Overall great atmosphere. Artsy back window are. The snacks offered are unique which I like. Definitely recommend this coffee shop!
2019-02-21,5,My cute little go-to coffee shop in Hoboken! Love their coffee and breads - they have it all from vegan to gluten-free breads!I love their hot chocolate and freshly brewed coffees!
2019-02-12,4,I live for a good coffee shop. This one is small but I enjoy the decor. I like that they have a good $2 cup of coffee as well as pricier lattes giving the customer a range. The staff was friendly and the almond milk cappuccino was tasty! The coffee shop can get crowded since it's on Washington. My only gripe is where you order the coffee is a little disorganized. The order area is on the side vs the front which causes a traffic jam and crowds the tables on the side. Otherwise decent coffee shop
