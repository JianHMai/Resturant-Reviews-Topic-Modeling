2021-10-03,5,Best burger in town, hands down! They also have a great brunch that is low key the spot! As the bar & outside aren't usually overcrowded & never play obnoxious music.
2021-09-09,3,No crowd at all for a Saturday afternoon brunch. Available seating outside under umbrellas, as well as a spacious interior - was able to snag a table for three as soon as we arrived.To start off, ordered the Spinach and Artichoke Dip ($13) to share. A large offering of thick artichoke/cheese dip served with hearty tortilla chips. Cheese on top is greasy, yet the artichoke underneath is very good. For my entrée, ordered the Limerick Fish & chips ($17) - two large cuts of fried cod served alongside french fries, ketchup, and tartar sauce. Fish is a bit of a miss, the inside is quite soggy as the fish itself wasn't properly drained (possible still frozen when cooked). However, the battering itself is seasoned well. Best of the bunch were the fries, cooked well and just the right amount of salt. Local beers ran around $6-7, which was also a plus.Service is quick as they took our orders/got food out fast. Can be up or down depending on what you order.
2021-08-27,4,My guest and I had a cheeseburger and a cheesesteak. Both were amazing. I had a local IPA and it was perfect. The other beer we ordered did not taste good at all. It was flat and appeared watered down. We had it replaced and the other drink wasn't much better. Overall the food was outstanding. I'd go again.
2021-08-09,5,They pour a good pint of Guinness and had a great $10 special going on when I was there for a pint and shot of whiskey. The gluten free options are better than most if not all of restaurants around this area. It is pub grub but that doesn't stop them from making great meals. Would highly recommend this irish pub, especially to anybody with a gluten allergy.
2021-08-08,3,TLDR: Good outdoor seating, not a great burger. Service: not great I came on a Saturday afternoon and sat outside for a burger (there was a private party inside) but otherwise not very busy. I ordered a BYO burger, LTO + Moran's Sauce and sweet potatoes fries. The waitress took my order and then went to a table of four and spent a while talking to them and taking to their order. So later on, I wasn't surprised when someone brought me a Moran's Burger and she had to come back and ask me what I actually ordered. Food: Presentation 8/10; Taste 5/10. My burger didn't have any flavor. I got it medium -- usually I go medium rare for a burger -- but the color was still great for medium here and it didn't ~look~ very dry. But it didn't have any flavor so I guess they just don't season the meat with anything. Bland and disappointing!! I also felt like they were chincey in the lettuce and onion. The worst part was the bun-- it was almost stale tasting because, again, there was no good bun flavor!! It just wasn't fresh and tasty experience-- I really expected better. :/ What SAVED this meal was the giant sweet potatoes wedges on the side. They were perfectly good! Their ketchup was disgusting (seriously, I really don't know how you mess up ketchup, who is making decisions back there??) so I used the Moran's sauce as dip instead. The sauce was better but nothing amazing. If I had to go back, I would try the Moran's Burger that comes with Irish Bacon and blue cheese I think -- so I would expect that to hopefully be tasty!
2021-08-04,1,We came for the burger because of the rave reviews. We left hungry would never return. Burger, steak sandwich and short rib POOtine were all absolute misses. Nothing went together, nothing was proper or had any love at all. My beer was warm, my requested whiskey that is listed on the menu, took ten minutes to locate and the lime in my partners margarita was brown. Not the edges but the entirety of it. This was three weeks ago in a Friday. If you you're in absolute need of a burger in this town, I'd recommend O'Nieals or Black Bear.
2021-07-09,3,3.5 starsMoran's is a traditional, authentic Irish pub that just started serving food in the last two years or so.  The menu was full of Celtic classics, like Irish Curry Chicken, and more contemporary dishes like Ginger Sesame Tofu, essentially offering something for everyone.  All of the food pictures and meals I had seen when walking by had looked terrific, so I was really eager to give it a shot.We were able to secure a table outside and sat to review for the beverage menu.  I decided on the Zonin Prosecco Brut, only to learn that it was sold out.  I then asked for the River Horse seasonal beer, which was similarly sold out.  And, next, the Brooklyn Brewery seasonal, also sold out.  I finally winded up with a Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA.  Needless to say, ordering a beverage at a bar should never be that difficult. When it came to the food, we started by sharing a giant soft Pretzel, which was served with both a cheese sauce and a maple mustard.  The doughy knot was warm and fluffy, but had a bit too much salt.  For my entree, I went with the Hummus Wrap with Shrimp, which was as basic as it sounded.  A whole wheat tortilla had been looped around a scoop of hummus, grilled shrimp, spinach, tomato, and tahini dressing.  I swapped the fries for a side salad, which included mixed greens, shredded carrots, grape tomatoes, and slices of red onion.  Overall the dish was fine, but probably not the most creative item I could have ordered; I guess that is what I get for trying to go with a healthier option!  My boyfriend, on the other hand, opted for the Shepherd's Pie, which included an impressive custom blend of ground beef from Pat La Frieda; tossed with peas, carrots, and mushrooms; and then covered with mashed potatoes.  He said it was very enjoyable.I am sure I will go back to Moran's, but will plan to try a heartier dish and will hope to have an easier time obtaining my beverage!
2021-06-03,5,I can see the appeal and the reason why lots of love Moran's. The pricing is reasonable. Irish Poutine is one of their very best menu items, I love it, and I think you really should try it as well. The staff was extremely helpful and service is terrific. Moran's... Go there, if you can.
2021-05-16,5,I've been a relatively frequent customer at Moran's for the past 3 years because I absolutely love it. The staff is very friendly, the meals are delicious, and the drinks are always flowing. My go-to brunch is the homestyle sausage n' biscuit with a mimosa; a pretty low price for a very nice size portion! It's become my friend group's favorite little joint especially because of the nice and open outdoor dining area. Gotta try it out for yourself!
2021-05-05,4,Have been meaning to try for the longest time and I was not disappointed. The BEST Byo burger in Hoboken hands down. Very laid back atmosphere. Bloody Mary's were decent. But the burgers have so many toppings and sauce options. Cooked to perfection!!! Only complaint was the waiter was not very friendly, besides that, great experience can not wait to return.
2021-04-29,3,Sat outside on a busy day. Nachos were great. They brought me the wrong burger first but quickly replaced it. Burger was fine, but the fries....! All over yelp, i saw pictures of handcuf strak fries. The fries we got were NOT that and were crusty and bad. Sad about that.
2021-03-25,5,Great service, drinks, and food. Nice atmosphere, too.
2021-03-20,5,Wow!! Ordered through their website for pick up since they were booked with reservations all night.We ordered the chicken fingers, morans burger with fries, and bacon Brussels sprouts. Our order was ready in 30min. Smooth pick up. Everything hot.The chicken fingers come with fries. I didn't know that. The chicken fingers were juicy! Cooked perfect. Crunchy breading and excellent flavor and size. Good quality and great portion for $10!! Soo worth it!! We will get them again. 10/10The bacon Brussels sprouts were great too. Cooked perfect, decent amount of bacon, and nice portion for $8. They are bit size which I liked. We wish they had just a little more flavor. My boyfriend likes larger sized Brussels. I actually enjoyed the bite size ones. 8/10The morans burger we ordered medium well and the fries to be extra crispy and burnt. WOW!!! Amazing!!! Top notch burger!! Great size burger, thick juicy patty, crunchy onions perfect touch, fresh lettuce, cheesy goodness!! Bun was fresh too. So so so good!!! And fries cooked PERFECT. Such a big deal guys!!! Excellent chef. Love that they pay attention to details. 10/10!!! Best burger in Hoboken in my opinion! :) And for $14, excellent price point.Definitely getting it again!!! We are SO happy with our order from Morans!!!
2020-12-05,1,Absolute amateur move to accept online orders through TouchBistro when you're not even open. What a joke.
2020-11-07,5,Not even a question, this is the best burger in Hoboken and maybe the best I've ever had. Wings also amazing. Steak sandwich is amazing. Boardwalk fries also amazing. Can't go wrong here.
2020-11-02,4,Wish they were open more but when they are the food is great and beer menu adequate. Outdoor seating with lots of social distance and helpful, attentive waitstaff, coupled with good food make it a great weekend lunch spot. Wife had a burger and for no other reason than I hadn't had a quiche in a while, I had the latter. Both were excellent, tasty and well prepared. The french fries were outstanding.
2020-09-11,5,Love this place! Awesome food and really good customer service. We had to wait like 10 minutes before getting an outside table- totally worth it!! I got the lamb lollipops and we shared the spinach dip. Definitely worth checking out. Enjoy!!
2020-08-24,4,I popped over to Moran's on a Sunday for a meal after day-drinking downtown.  Moran's has a lot of outdoor seating now.  Service was good.  They don't have a ton of beers on draft right now but they have a good amount of can & bottle options.  We shared the spinach & artichoke dip to start - chips aren't homemade but the dip was very good - a lot of spinach in it.  For my entree, I had the fish & chips; it came with 2 big pieces of fish. Very tasty & their fries are really good.  My friend got the Moran's burger which was huge and also came with fries.  Quality meal & service.
2020-08-09,5,Very tasty! Morans has quickly become one of my favorite breakfast spots in Hoboken. I've had the biscuits and gravy, quiche, Iris breakfast, and breakfast burrito. They were all good, and the service is great.The salad that comes with the breakfast quiche is especially good- not sure what is in the dressing, but it's fantastic. Tables are socially distanced, and every table has a bottle of hand sanitizer, which is a nice touch. Morans is also nestled in more of a quiet street, very residential, without as many people coming and going like on Washington. I'd highly recommend!
2020-08-03,3,I want to like this place. I really do. It has all the makings for a great place, and I'm open to changing my mind. But we've been twice. The first time was really great--we came right after we moved to Hoboken. But we went a second time and it was beyond terrible. We ordered these famous wings I keep hearing about, and when they came out the centers were frozen. Rock solid raw chicken with a crispy exterior. I told the waitress and she took them back to make them a second time. That would have been fine--accidents happen, though raw chicken is a pretty bad mistake. The second time they came out they were even worse. Cold all around. She took it off the bill, which is why this isn't a 1 star review. The service was receptive to the problem, but still--raw chicken served twice is pretty bad.Some of the things we've had here are really delicious. But it's hard to trust whether my food is going to be cooked after that. This was several months ago, so maybe things are better now, but I don't know if we will return.
2020-07-10,5,One thing that makes a local bar great is the staff & atmosphere. Morans has one of the friendliest bar tenders I've ever met, the food is incredible too. You can't go wrong choosing this place!
2020-05-27,4,Cobb salad- bangingWings-banging (1x they weren't DONT DO IT AGAIN)Burger- best in town possiblyService- needs workIt's like a higher class pub for older millennials
2020-04-04,5,Best burger in Hoboken.My introduction to Moran's, dating back to September 2018, was the famous Moran's Burger with sweet potato wedges. I'll admit that it was a little much for me. Really good burger no doubt but between the irish bacon, truffle butter, and crispy onions, it was a bit of sensory overload. Didn't love the wedges, but gave em a shot because I typically love sweet potato fries.I've been back 3 times since I think, and I've elected for the BYO Burger. It's the best burger I've had in Hoboken and maybe ever. Bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, sometimes avocado, medium or medium rare depending on the day. It's a BIG burger with a generous portion of outstanding fries.If I had one complaint about the burger it would be that the bun is sometimes a little bready. But that's a nitpick.Moran's is a MUST TRY if you want a burger in Hoboken. They have a sign outside that says Best Burger in Hoboken, and I'm here to say it's a bonafide fact.
2020-03-09,4,This is a wonderful Hoboken gem. Went in on a rainy day and had a great time. Service could be quicker and better but the food was great. We had Fish and Chips and a regular cheeseburger. The fries were the right kind of crispy and fish was fresh. Good drinks menu too!!
2020-03-07,3,My wife and I came for brunch. I ordered the Irish Breakfast and my wife ordered the French toast. The french toast was delicious, but the Irish Breakfast was nothing special. Some of the other food I saw come out looked really good, so I think I'd come back to try something else. The staff was nice and service was quick. I also liked the atmosphere.
2020-03-01,4,Cute little spot for great tavern-esque meals with a twist. It is a bit of a tight squeeze inside.I had the Maple Chicken Bacon sandwich- it was so savory. One of the best meals I've had in a long time.
2020-02-08,5,First time at Morann''s and it wont be my last. GreAt food. Great Music. Great Service. Must try the Moran Pub Burger and Wings. Great selection of beers wines and whiskeys. Next time www LL try the fish and chips +  Shepherd's Pie
2020-01-23,5,I consider myself an Irish Pub savant. That being said - Moran's ranks amongst the best. Why you ask? Is it the perfect Guinness pour? Sure that helps. Is it the quality pub food, talking wings, burgers, nachos etc? Yeh, that helps too... But everyone knows what turns an OK Irish Pub experience from a good to great experience is quality bar banter. Lenny, the owner of Moran's has his PhD. in bar banter. Whether it's talking shop, golf, or current world events Lenny can cut it with the best of them! Prime time real estate in this pub is a bar stool in Lenny's pour station. Bonus points for having TouchTunes - no better feeling than dropping a 20 spot and taking the entire bar on a musical voyage!
2020-01-19,5,LOVE this pub!  My friends and I go here decently often, especially for their Moran's burger which is honestly one of my top favorite burgers I've ever had.  Their appetizer buffalo wings and spinach artichoke dip are also amazing.Recently came here for brunch for the first time, tons of options that are delicious and different from their typical dinner menu.
2019-12-27,5,Moran's has the best burger in Hoboken and I come here often to eat it. We also get the grilled jerk wings almost every time we come. Nice to have a non-fried wing option... This has become my favorite pub in town over the past year - never disappoints. Good for Sunday football as well. The owner, Len, is also the man.
2019-12-08,3,Although our meals were pretty good, we had terrible service at this place. Would rate higher but when we went on a Friday night the service was terribly slow. We were never asked if we wanted our drinks refilled, and it took close to 30 minutes just to ask for a check. I would love to give this place a second try because we have heard such good things but am a little apprehensive.
2019-11-09,4,Brunch on a Saturday. The burger, holy $#it it's everything. Four stars bc we also ordered the Normandy Benny, it's was fine. Not amazing. Fortunately the burger blew my mind enough I wanted my friend's meal instead of my own. Bloody Mary's were ordered in addition to the Nancy Lopez.
2019-10-25,4,I love the Irish culture. Maybe I was Irish in another life or something but I feel right at home when I go to an Irish Pub. Moran's is such a great little neighborhood business in the Hoboken area and the owner is so sweet and accommodating. Although the kitchen closed two minutes before arriving there, he still guaranteed I would be able to order food. I came here specifically for the lamb lollipops and although they come with frites, I also ordered Irish poutine which has a delicious Irish curry that is homemade. Not to mention the chunks of meat spread throughout the dish. It was a great combination with my whiskey and club. Can't wait to St. Paddy's to have their corned beef!
2019-10-13,4,Okay, so the only reason I won't give 5 stars is because they "gave" us extra fries (that we didn't order) and when we told the guy we didn't order it he said "it's okay" and then when the bill came.... They charged us for the extra fries? Lol.. what? I mean they refunded it after I got up and complained about it, but still... Lol?Anyway, the place is a pub so expect loudness and drunks. HOWEVER, THE FOOD IS BANGIN. The burger is absolutely delicious and I don't know what their secret sauce is (def not ketchup and mayo) but it's awesome. I was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was. And I got a sweet potato (which I thought would be fries but it was baked) and it was perfect! They put a little bit of cinnamon on it which totally topped it off. Overall, happy with the food... Not so happy with the staff.
2019-09-19,4,This place is a cute hole in the wall for food. You wouldn't expect good food in this pub when you walk in, but it's delicious. I got the spinach eggs Florentine and it was so good. This place is very worth your money and inexpensive!
2019-09-19,3,I give this place is solid 3.5 stars. The overall place is really nice. People are very friendly. The music that is playing fits perfectly with the environment. The only negative which wasn't bad at all but still ate the burger which was it was on the dry side. I did ask for it to be medium cooked so it would have they juice flavor to it but I had to add bbq sauce to give it a bit more of a kick. Overall the place is amazing. P.S. the wings are  my friend got them, they smack
2019-09-17,4,Very happy with this choice for brunch! It helped that it was a gorgeous day (two weeks ago) and we sat outside. We ordered the Norwegian Benedict, the burger and the Cornflake French Toast. Our server was great and always came around with a smile. 10/10 would recommend - want to come back to try out drinks next!
2019-09-15,4,Had their steak & eggs, and yes I'm a fan.Thought about the Irish breakfast but I'm glad I got what I did.NY strip steak cooked medium combined great with the scrambled eggs and fries.My gf got a nice iced coffee with her eggs benedict + a side of avocado.Great place to stop by on an afternoon in Hoboken, and they have TV's  playing football.
2019-09-08,1,Just getting back after having dinner there.Food was okay but service is nonchalant, like they don't care.Our server( a lady) , never smiled, never asked us how out food was and every time our eyes met, she looked away to avoid being called or asked.I managed to grab her attention once and say like 'Hey' , but she chose to ignore me and dashed past.No one asked for a water refill and as soon as our food was done, she slammed the check( we didn't ask for it, and neither was the restaurant crowded). Even when we were leaving, my husband and I tried to smile as she was right in front of us, and she just ignored and walked away.I've not had such a bad service experience in a very very long time and I'm surprised how this place has good reviews.Maybe it's the patrons.But I would never go back to be treated like that no matter how good the food.i felt like I was in a McDonald's or even worse since in McDonalds  I can go get my own water if it's over.
2019-08-31,5,Don't doubt this place. The Brunch is absolutely AMAZING! The steak and eggs is worth your money! The eggs are fluffy, the steak is super tender and was cooked PERFECTLY! Great seasoning, and the fries are delicious! The right amount of salty and savory. The breakfast burrito is also amazing. The perfect size, and you can add jalapeños for free and avocado for $2. Totally recommend this place for Brunch on the weekend. Our waitress was Paula and she was very nice and caring. The service was pretty quick. We put in our order and got our food within 20 minutes.
2019-08-18,5,Visited Moran's today with two friends. I had the mixed grill , the others Shepards pie and chicken curry. Absolutely fantastic .Our server was a beautiful looking lady named Rachel.Top marks
2019-06-23,5,Had dinner here on a Sunday night.  The inside was a little warm, but I was able to get a seat outside and the inside didn't feel unbearably hot.  I was greeted by a host and waited on right away.  Servers were very friendly and my food came quickly.  They were also attentive.  People of different ages were here including older adults, families with kids, and younger adults.  A 20% gratuity was not added to my bill.Would definitely be back.
2019-06-12,5,This is a great neighborhood pub. Away from the crazy of some of the Washington St bars. Lots of regulars. Kevin is one of the best bartenders I have ever met. Always friendly and personable, attentive but not intrusive, remembers just how you like your food. Brunch is a real treat. Get a bloody mary (Kevin's special brew) and heuvos rancheros, you won't be disappointed. Also a fan of the pretzel and the jerk wings.
2019-06-09,4,Great outdoor seating.  Inside looked cool too- like a chill pub.  Staff was friendly enough. Nothing over the top or super welcoming.  I got the Irish curry chicken. It was decent. I really liked the addition of the banana to go with the curry chicken.  I thought the fries and rice combo was a bit much.  So I skipped the rice and ate the fries of course.  They great to be honest.  Everything was good enough that I'll come back for sure.
2019-06-09,4,We went to Moran's on a Saturday night. I'd read it has some of the better pub food in Hoboken. It's located on the Northwest side of Church Square park: actually very pretty. Inside it's a cozy, small Irish pub with wood tables. We ordered the following:- Pretzel: Amazing with cheese and mustard sauces. Super filling but if you like pretzels it's awesome- The Irish Chicken Curry: flavorful with fries and rice. Would be great if it could be made super spicy. The banana garnish was interesting and better than I thought- Summer Pasta: Delicious and even good with a side of steakThe beer on tap was just ok. The service was friendly. It got a little loud but cranky nothing compared to the hot mess you might get on Washington and near the Path - so some welcome calmish environs if that's what you are looking for.
2019-05-11,1,I am literally sitting here waiting to get taken care of. Waiters are absolutely rude when I asked who was my server since I have not been waited on and the girl legit gives me an attitude pretty much saying it's my fault that I didn't order quickly. They don't check on tables after they receive food, ask if you need refills on drinks, or give you napkins. Absolutely insane. Will never come here again.
2019-04-04,4,Wow! One of be better burgers I've ever had in my life. It was so flavorful and delicious and the truffle really made it. It's a must try if your in the area. I would also highly suggest the buffalo wings! They had the perfect amount of sauce and the perfect amount of breading. Just a cool low key spot if you wanna grab dinner with a date or friend. I wish there was more than one server.
2019-03-31,1,WARNING! If you are tourist or even if you dress like tourist, they will push you to pay 20% gratuity!We've been there multiple times for brunch and the food was great. However, when my husband and I brought our parents from China (we are group of 4) there last the week, the waiter automatically charged us 20% gratuity because they thought we wouldn't pay the tip. This was total ridiculous! Definitely won't be back again!
2019-03-30,3,Stopped by for a small bite and a drink. Their menu is pretty standard Irish pub fare. A lot of people around us were eating burgers and they looked very good.We ordered sliders to share. They were good. Not great, but not bad either. I'd return for a normal burger. My biggest issue here was the service. It was very slow - we were sitting for 10 minutes before anyone even brought us a menu. Seemed like there was some confusion in the food running, too. Several times servers brought food to tables that didn't order what was being brought. This happened to us and to most of the tables around us.I'd maybe return if in the area and give it another shot. Maybe they were just having an off day!
2019-03-03,5,Great place! We were seated immediately and the staff was attentive. It's a small place that seems like a neighborhood spot as there were a lot of locals. I had the salmon and it was one of the best I've had! The portions are very fair and won't leave you hungry. I will say that some of the other customers can get rowdy if you go later at night (we went around 5:45pm).Can't wait to go again! Parking is a nightmare but the food is worth it.
2019-02-17,5,OMG! What a nice gem of a find! The atmosphere is what you expect of a Irish pub feel, but the food was above expectations.  We ordered to split for 2 the Irish breakfast and cereal covered French toast. I especially love the texture of the French toast with the Kellogg flakes as a crispy contrast to the soft French toast. Hands down the best brunch we had in a while. Come check this place out, you wont be disappointed!
2019-02-09,5,Came here on a Saturday night and made a reservation for 6 (probably not necessary for smaller parties). Overall, a fantastic experience. The jerk wings were perfectly seasoned and cooked. For dinner I had the Moran's burger which was so juicy and flavorful. Make sure you get the sweet potato wedges for $1 more! Highly recommend the Moscow mule as well!Will definitely be back.
2019-02-02,4,Food and drink rated 5 stars. The burgers were one of the best I've had. The Guinness was poured perfectly.  The service brought it down to 4 stars.
2019-01-12,5,Great Irish Pub in Hoboken! Quaint bar with cozy, dark interiors. Good selection of beers. All the food we've tried at Morans has been great. I suggest the jerk wings and burger. You will not be disappointed.
2019-01-05,3,First, great food. We got the pretzel, wings, Moran burger, steak sandwich and steak. All were well prepared and delicious. Second, service was atrocious. Therefore, three stars!
2019-01-03,5,Amazing brunch and fantastic burgers. Moran's never lets met down, you always know it's going to be a good meal. A good Irish pub if you just want to grab a drink and don't want any food, as well. Also love that they have outdoor seating when it's warm.
2018-12-24,5,Christmas Eve dinner at Moran's. Delicious food. Great service. Great for kids. First time there.
2018-12-09,4,I decided to come here because I'm gluten free and saw that they have GF bread on their menu; it's difficult to find a restaurant in Hoboken that offers gf bread! I ordered the maple bacon chicken sandwich and it was delicious! We also ordered dessert and shots to celebrate a promotion at work.  The staff was very attentive and friendly. I came a second time for brunch with a friend and the food was just as delicious but the staff wasn't as attentive. This is a great spot for brunch, dinner and drinks with friends or for a date. Heads-up that they're closed on Mondays!
2018-12-06,5,Just an overall quality Irish pub with a cozy local vibe. My absolute go-to for a burger. The Moran's burger is out of this world delicious. Quality Pat Lefreda's beef, Irish bacon, and a nice hint of truffle (not too overpowering). Paired with a glass (or 3) of Guinness and your soul will be satisfied.Disclaimer: I have come here at least twice a month for the last year of living in Hoboken. The first time I came I got a burger upon referral, and literally have not even thought of getting anything else. I bet the Shepard's pie and other menu items are just delightful!.. although I will stick to my Moran's burger and Guinness.
2018-11-20,5,Great burger great burger great burger. I don't order burgers often so when I do they better be perfect. And i always order a burger here. With a side salad to reduce sin
2018-11-03,5,Let's talk about the cheese, the pretzel appetizer and especially the cheese. The food was so good overall but as the waiter removed our cheese thinking we were done there was a loud cry from half the table "noooooooooo" and a request for a cheese dip refill! Pretty happy with my burger and have had great meals here in the past as well, but I had to drop by and say cheese :DI have also come here for brunch with friends and it makes a nice spot for a double date too! It is a nice and laid back atmosphere and just across from a local Hoboken park to take a walk after the meal. They can also accommodate a reasonable sized group for a birthday party event that I went to which is good to know as it is hard to find space for events and bday hosting meals for a large group in town.
2018-09-22,4,The food was excellent, loved the hollandaise sauce. However on the Irish breakfast the black pudding had an over powering clove taste. The service was also slow, we gave in our credit cards and it took 5-10 minutes to get the check back. The outdoor space was nice
2018-09-03,5,You know those restaurants that you live so close to, but you always forget to try out? Yes, this is one of those places, but I'm so glad I was able to try it out finally because it was DELICIOUS.We came for brunch on Sunday afternoon and saw so many things on the menu that sounded delicious, but ultimately decided on coffee, cornflake crusted French toast, the croque-Moran's, and homestyle biscuits and sausage. The coffee is from Empire, which made us so incredibly happy because we love their coffee and usually make that part of our Sunday morning routine anyway. Service was prompt and friendly from the moment we walked in to taking our last sip of coffee.Let me start by saying the French toast is a MUST TRY! The beard is soaked in their egg mixture and so soft, but pairs so beautifully with the cornflake crust which gives French toast that classic crunch. Pairing it with strawberries, blueberries, and fried bananas just gives it the final touch that pushes it above and beyond. The croque-Moran's is inspired by a croque-madam, but instead has smoked gouda, spinach and artichoke dip, bacon rashers, and an egg on top accompanied by fries. It sounds like such an odd combination, but it was so delicious. The biscuit in my dish was beautifully toasted and buttery with the most generous serving of fluffy scrambled eggs on top, finished with gravy. It also came with two slices of chicken rosemary apple sausage and roasted potatoes, which were delicious.We can't wait to come back to try out their other menu items!
2018-08-02,5,Unexpectedly delicious brunch!! The wait staff is the perfect amount of attentive. Outdoor seating near Church Square Park is major key. Perfect place to spend a few hours of your Sunday!
2018-07-17,5,One of the better bars in Hoboken. It's a very low key place but it's great to go to if you're looking to have a couple drinks with friends or watch a game without a huge crowd. This is an Irish themed bar so Guinness is a go to drink here! The bar itself is rather big with plenty of barstools. There is also a decent amount of tables inside (both near the bar & in a more closed off section of the bar) if you're looking to get some food & they also have outdoor seating for the spring/summer season. Behind the bar are three tv's which always have some sort of sports game on them. They also have a touchscreen jukebox which you can also requests songs using an app on your phone. What makes this bar so great is the owner/staff. I've gotten to know the owner, Lenny quite well & he is very friendly & has plenty of stories which he enjoys sharing. My brother & I always make sure to talk to Lenny whenever we go in & he's there. The staff is also very friendly & they also enjoy talking to the customers as well. Even though I've never had food here but from what I heard, the wings & burgers are delicious. I've been here on a Thursday/Friday/Saturday to either hangout or watch a game & I've always enjoyed it. Definitely a great spot to go to!
2018-07-15,5,Delicious food and tea! We had to wait a bit due to coming during a World Cup game, but the food was great, especially the classic eggs Benedict!
2018-07-08,5,Moran's has great food and a wonderful atmosphere. Have come for brunch and for food/drinks on a Saturday night. Their lamb lollipops are amazing and the croque madam brunch sandwich was phenomenal. It has a more relaxed Saturday night vibe, which is great if you're looking to get away from the loudness of Washington Street.
2018-06-21,4,Came by here for a Saturday brunch. Cozy pub atmosphere, and service was attentive. The eggs, gravy, and potatoes were good, but the sausage patties were very very dry and not great--I ended up using the ketchup to finish the sausages. Besides that, decent brunch food in the Hoboken area.
2018-06-20,5,My family and I took my husband to Morans for Father's Day. I was looking for a nice brunch in a casual setting.  I decided on Morans based on reviews, the menu and the cost. We were more than pleased. The service was excellent; the hostess and our waiter were very accomodating and attentive. The food exceeded our expections. We expected average fare for a pub but we were very surprised. We ordered the classic eggs benedict,steak and eggs,corn flake crusted french toast and crogue and everydish was delicious. I must note the steak was cooked preferctly and very tender. The $30 pitcher of mimosas was a bargain too. It was enough for 4 people to have 2 glases with some to spare. If you are looking for a low key, affordable brunch then check out Moran's. I doubt you will be disappointed.
2018-04-28,4,Moran's is a fun place to come to for Brunch. I've been here several times and have always enjoyed it. The servers here are very nice and will take care of you.My favorite is the wakey wakey eggs and bakey. The flavors are always on point and it's a good amount of food for the price.It's a no frills, chill spot to grab brunch with your friends. I highly recommend Moran's.
2018-03-19,4,Came here for St. Pat's. It's literally a corner bar and we had a good time. The wings and lamb lollypops were both very good. Since it was St. Paddy's, we had the corned beef plate, which was good, although we did have to wait a bit, so I can't speak to the regular menu beyond the aforementioned appetizers. I do want to come back and try the rest. The service was good and friendly and I liked the crowd. I'll be back for sure.
2018-03-17,5,We were there for brunch and Loved the place. Very nice service. Good people and good food. It was fun and tasty
2018-02-26,5,A must try for anyone in the area. Probably the best Guinness pour around and (fortunately/unfortunately depending on the day) can't miss 10$ whiskey shot and Guinness combo. The food is top notch with some cool choices. The bartenders and owner could not be nicer and more welcoming.
2018-02-25,5,This is my favorite restaurant in hoboken. I never expected the food to be so great, but every time I go I love it. The burger is wonderful (get it with smoked Gouda). Seriously the most unpretentious, reliably tasty American food in hoboken.
2018-01-20,4,Good food and terrific vibe.  Place was full on Sunday late morning with a mix of families and Sunday Funday pre-gamers.  Solid burger.  My son's cornflake crusted French toast was the coup-de-tat.  Solidly in the brunch rotation.
2018-01-20,5,Awesome.  My new go to place.  The food is amazing.Croque and french toast during brunch is great. Burgers are awesome.Nachos amazing.Outdoor seating and dog friendly in the summer.  Great service and prices.Two items that could be improved:1) beer taps are little warm and flat - which is super surprising.2) townies sit at the end of the bar, and make regular trips right outside the door to smoke. Recommend they smoke away from the building as to not let it blow back in.
2018-01-16,4,It would be hard to find a better combination of reasonably priced and delicious when it comes to brunch options in Hoboken.Everything was great. Outdoor seating is perfect for the summer and the indoors is cozy in the winter.The food can take a little while to get to the table, but I keep coming back so that should tell you all you need to know.
2018-01-14,4,A solid brunch spot this morning.  We have been going to Moran's since it started to serve food. Usually we try to sit outside but since it is bitter cold we were forced inside. Today was a first. They do not have any vegan options and few vegetarian options. They have started a kids menu now which I think is new. We got the moms omelette, French toast and a burger. Every thing was a good portion and well done. The staff is helpful and friendly for a restaurant/bar Moran's is a good spot.
2018-01-14,3,I really wanted to like this place... we walked in and it took a while for our server to come over. We understood because it was pretty busy, but she was really nice once she came over. We ordered our food right away and then waited... 35 minutes later we still didn't have our food and our waitress hasn't walked by in a while. A table that came after us, got their food... about 10 minutes later, another table (that just walked in) gets food that looks just like our order. They accepted the food and didn't say that it wasn't theirs. So I asked the food runner what happened to our order because those people next to us just walked in. And server grabbed the plates back, walked over to the kitchen and brought back the same exact plates to us... no one apologized or anything... just pretended like it didn't happen. The server didn't even acknowledge that the food took so long. Since we saw that the people didn't even touch the food, we still ate it. I really wanted to like this place because the food was actually really good. But unfortunately, I can't say the same about the service...
2017-12-31,4,Came here for brunch on a Saturday afternoon with a group of 4. We all loved it! This place is a cozy little pub with great atmosphere. The food was delicious. I had a Florentine Benedict and was blown away. Excellent Hollandaise sauce and perfectly poached eggs! Also really affordable prices ($5 mimosas yay). Our only tiny complaint was that the service was slow at times but overall still highly recommend!
2017-12-28,4,My favorite part of Moran's is the cozy environment! It makes the meal so much more enjoyable.I came here a couple times with my SO and his father.  We always get the nachos because they are absolutely amazing.  You get more toppings than chips! What a dream! As far as entrees go, I have personally had the lobster mac and cheese (which I am not sure is still served, or it could be a seasonal thing) and the poutine (which I am OBSESSED with).  Other meals that I have tasted are the fish and chips, and the burgers.  I have nothing negative to say about any of them. This place is worth a try.
2017-12-05,5,We came to Moran's for brunch and it was fantastic! The service was on point and our water glasses were constantly refilled. Now onto the food - which was so delicious! I had the quiche and tell - what a cute name. They actually put puff pastry below and above the eggs - so it's basically sandwiched in puff pastry. My friend highly recommends the Moran Burger - with bacon, cheddar and truffle mayo you can't go wrong! They even serve tea in pot with a hat on it - so very cute! Moran's is a solid choice for brunch if you're in Hoboken!
2017-11-07,4,Moran's has a decent selection of beers and food that is better than your average Hoboken 'pub grub', it's also not as expensive to eat here as it can be in other Hoboken bars. It's nicely situated on the side of Church Square Park so it's very pleasant to sit on the terrace here in warmer weather (it can get a little loud inside if it's busy). Service is friendly although food service can be a little slow at brunch if it's busy. There's always a good mix of people in here, from old timers to young families and it feels much more like a neighborhood spot than bars on Washington St.  All in all, pretty good, and one of the best bars to visit if you want to eat as well as drink in Hoboken
2017-11-02,2,Food was pretty good. However, the main issue I found was that it took 1 hour and 10 mins for my group of six to receive our orders during brunch.
2017-10-23,4,It was time for the next burger, and Moran's looked promising. We came on a Sunday evening, and ended up sitting outside because it was so loud inside, so keep that in mind if you're coming with a large group. They currently have the Sam Adams seasonal Oktoberfest which is robust in flavor. It took a while for the food to come, so I was definitely glad to have something to sip on. I went for the burger with no bacon (because I rarely find that bacon adds anything to a burger), and ordered it medium. It definitely came out well done, but wasn't dry. They have a great combo of burger toppings, including arugula, which made the flavors appealing. So appealing that I ate the entire giant burger...Their other sandwiches looked great too, and would definitely leave you with second helpings. I would say skip the bacon on the burger unless you always love that, because I heard it was a little soggy (I'm a fan of crispier bacon).
2017-10-01,4,Cool neighborhood place. Havent tried the food yet but I hear it is very good.This has a cool outside seating area and is more of a locals spot if you like that.  Perfect for day drinking in a chill envirnoment. Beer is always cold and the service is always on point. What more can you ask for!
2017-09-15,5,This place is a real Irish pub. Really chill, relaxed vibe with Irish traditional music playing. The staff is very attentive and the food is delicious. There is always a good crowd of people even on weeknights, which is always a good sign. The Portobello Blue veggie burger is amazing, as is the Irish poutine. We had family visiting from Ireland for two weeks and frequented this place a lot since it was right around the corner from their Air BnB. Will definitely be adding Moran's to the list of favorite spots from now on.
2017-08-30,5,Amazing food, amazing service, authentic pub atmosphere. Favorite spot in the neighborhood!
2017-08-26,5,Reasonable selection of drinks and food, pretty much what you'd expect from an average restaurant/bar. But since they gave me a free beer due to the kitchen being held up without me having to ask, and the fact that the food is pretty good and the beer good as well, 5/5.
2017-08-10,5,My favorite dive bar in hoboken all of the staff is super friendly always remember your name  drinks are good prices and just gives you the feel that your in Ireland
2017-07-29,5,We tried Moran's for the first time after reading good reviews. We were not disappointed. The food a great and service is great We had the nachos with chicken as an appetizer. It was delicious with guacamole, jalapeño peppers, olives, tomatoes and a good amount of cheese. I had the Potebello Blue sandwich with a salad and my husband has the maple bacon chicken sandwich with fries. Both were delicious and cooked well. Beer and wine choices along with great service was a pleasure. We will be back for sure.
2017-07-21,3,My husband and I went there for brunch, the foot of the menu is very Limited, and the drinks are not so common so their breakfast options are for people of particular taste. I don't want to give it a bad review just because I don't like drinks with a niece and British style breakfast.
2017-07-19,1,Another great spot in Hoboken.. but the air conditioning is horrible in the summer time. It's like a sauna and you can't enjoy a drink without wiping the sweat off your forehead. It's like a locker room!Fix the air already!
2017-07-18,3,More like 3.5***. Would come here for drinks for sure. It's a cute little neighborhood bar with friendly staff. Close to the dog run so you can stop by for a drink after park with your dog. Great prices for drinks. We also came back for brunch. The food was ok, just standard pub food. Check it out if you're in he neighborhood.
2017-06-09,5,Very good food,+(best fries I've had in a long time) friendly service, good choice of tap beers.
2017-05-26,5,I can't believe it's taken me two years to eat here! I read such great reviews and finally got a chance to have their brunch! SO MUCH YUM! I had a Jon Daly to drink (which is like a spiked Arnold palmer, but with homemade lemonade, with Bourbon) it was super refreshing sipping on a Sunday afternoon! I ordered their smoked salmon eggs benedict - I thought this was so unique because instead of using bread, they used fried potato cakes! (holy amazing flavor!) it comes with a side of fruit, so this was a low-carb friendly meal! I'd love to try their other meals...I'd like to also mention that their staff is incredible - even when they're busy they accommodate to your needs and always making sure you're GOOD. Can't wait to come back!!
2017-05-19,1,I'd love to say something about the food but the service was so bad we walked out without even seeing our dinner. After ordering and waiting 45 minutes AND never seeing the waitress even to refresh our drinks, my friends and I left.
2017-03-29,3,Saturday 3/25/2017  4.30pmAlmost walked out even before ordering a beer - as we were walking up to the bar, noticed a gentleman taking out the garbage and crushed glass.Surprisingly, he followed us in and got back behind the bar and was just about to ask us what we would like to drink when I asked my GF out loud, "do you think this guy is going to wash his hands after taking care of the garbage?"  Good thing I did.  He heard me and did the right thing.  We were going to eat dinner there, but that turned us off.Warm tap beer, ice cold bottled beer, and a decent $10 for pint of Guinness and shot of Jamison.  Has the feel of the local  taverns you don't see anymore.
2017-03-26,5,Came here on a Saturday afternoon and was pleased we got sat right away for a party of three. The place is unpretentious and serves a delicious brunch! I got the quiche, my son the pasta wit cheese sauce which he devoured, and my husband the eggs and bacon dish. The staff was welcoming and attentive. We left very satisfied.
2017-03-19,5,The burgers!!! They serve Pat La Freida meat- the Moran's Burger is to die for. Their new special ($10 for a burger and beer) is an excellent value. Actually turned me on to ordering burgers from Pat La Freida - but when you're in the area let the guys at Moran do the cooking for you. Cozy neighborhood bar ambiance with friendly staff.
2017-03-17,5,i love all the food at Moran's so when i had to start planning my company's monthly team lunch (coincidentally scheduled on st patricks day) I reached out to them on a whim. i thought it was a long shot since we're located in dumbo of all places and as far as I was aware moran's doesn't advertise catering, but they got back to me quickly, and they were so friendly and willing to work with me to structure a menu for the (often very picky!) office.the food was delivered on time and there was sooooo much of it. so we got: bangers and mash, corned beef and cabbage, baked salmon w lemon dill, mac and guinness cheddar cheese, shepherds pie empanadas (lmao these were so unexpected and delightful! a frontrunner for most popular), vegetable pot pie (my personal fave of the day), roasted carrots, roasted potatoes, soda bread, and salad. The portions were beyond generous -- we had people taking home tupperware by the pound. honestly super thrilled with this whole experience. I get anxious when ordering food for a large group of people with like unbelievably particular dietary preferences and needs, but Moran's took all the stress out of the prep and then delivered a perfect meal. My coworkers were saying things like we should order from here for every team lunch which if you know these people you know is high praise. Thanks so much to Vin, Lisa, Sharon, Maura, Lenny, and everyone else who helped put this together. can't wait to work with you all again :) :) :) :)
2017-03-13,5,This a great Irish pub with good cocktails, pub food and service. A very cozy atmosphere - you can sit in the back room or right by the bar. There is always a pretty packed house so you might have to wait 20 minutes for a table. The servers are very friendly and attentive. Cocktail menu has some good choices and of course a decent amount of beers. The food is top notch. I go for the Morans burger. It's salty and juicy and fatty - exactly what you want in a burger. You can go with a side salad if you want to stay sort of healthy or just go for the fries. The appetizers and entrees are also great.
2017-03-12,5,I really like it here! Moran's is a warm place. Great food and great drinks! Brunch here is so very satisfying. I always get the Irish Breakfast! Love the blood sausage!You gotta go and have a perfect Irish coffee!
2017-03-04,5,If you're looking for a great, classic, Irish pub, this is the place to go. My boyfriend and I stopped by here for brunch last weekend when we were exploring Hoboken for the day. We both have traveled in Ireland and when we saw the promise of an Irish breakfast, we jumped on the chance. First off, the staff here were super friendly and made you feel relaxed and welcome -the bartender even greeted us with a joke. My boyfriend got the classic Irish breakfast and a Guinness and was happy to find it was just as delicious as in Ireland. I had the croque-Moran and a coffee with Bailey's. It was a perfect, warm, creamy dish on a cold morning (great pairing with the coffee)! Over a cozy and friendly place - if I lived in Hoboken I could see myself being a regular here!
2017-02-15,5,Good food, great atmosphere - can do dinner or just grab a drink.
2017-01-14,5,Excellent Food. Relaxed and cozy atmosphere.  Friendly service.  A true public house in town
2017-01-02,5,My server was extremely attentive, the atmosphere was cozy and casual, and the food was really, really good. If I lived in Hoboken, I'd be a regular!
2016-11-06,5,For me this place is associated with some magic haha, but that's only cause of my personal experiences with it. Twice that I've been there I was on some sort of adventure. But just cause of those memories it deserves a good review from me... I had to spend four hours there when I was locked out of my house... on Halloween nightFood wise: only had ahi tacos, they were bomb. Drink wise, good cocktails, something ginger was prettyyyyy goood... it looks like a family bar, it's cozy inside. Oh, and also, shout out to Australian bartender, Henry I believe his name was, is a nice guy :)
2016-11-03,5,Always pleased! Always amazed at how much variety they have on their menu and how everything I have ever tried is superb! And not to forget the consistently amazing service! Michael is our favorite!
2016-10-30,5,Kitchen just opened up here 6 months ago and the food here is amazing!  Best sweet potato fries ever.  Lobster Mac & Cheese is the bomb, incredible nachos.  Server Dan was excellent.  Coming back here!  Just uncovered a little gem of a pub.
2016-09-25,4,Loved the patio, it was nice and quiet being off the Main Street. Just did drinks here, but the service was good! They did have waitstaff for the patio, so we didn't have to keep running in and out. They do close the patio around 11 or so, but the inside bar/restaurant stays open. It definitely gets louder around 11:30, but the mood seemed very friendly and relaxed. Sports on the tv and a good number of tables for being such a small place.
2016-09-23,5,The Moran's burger is by far the best burger in Hoboken. The Irish bacon makes this burger amazing. The burger itself is well seasoned and blends well with the rest of the toppings on the burger. My favorite item is the truffle mayo. Make sure you get extra for the burger and to dip the fries in! You won't regret it!
2016-09-18,5,As a man who hasn't eaten at home in three years , I've had a lot of fries. I've eaten a lot of great food. So trust me when I tell you that you've never had fries like these and you haven't eaten food this fresh at very many places. I literally said "Wow" twice - on my first two bites. The Full Irish breakfast and the Irish Whiskey, complete with the friendly Irish service, totally made my morning. It's a delight in every bite. It's everything every brunch should ever be. Next time I'm in New Jersey or New York, this place can count on seeing me. Seriously, what do the chefs here put in this food?
2016-09-16,5,They got food recently and I went there for brunch.  It was awesome.  It is a true Irish breakfast.  They literally have a full Irish breakfast on the menu.  My friend ordered it and she was Irish and she was quite pleased.  I got the Croque-Moran's.  It was very tasty.  The brunch food was great all around.  They had a great Bloody Mary.  I do not like the Bloody Maura (with Irish Moonshine), but my friends liked it.  Definitely, try this place for brunch.I have also gone there late night.  It is a simple bar with music and a good place to chill.  If you want to go out with some friends and hang out, you can go there.  It is not very exciting on its own, but a fun place for your friends to have some room and party.
2016-08-16,5,Food is so delicious, and the bartenders are lovely, lovely, lovely. Try the beet salad.
2016-08-14,5,We've always loved Moran's as a great place for a drink, but who would have thought their newly added food menu would be so good? Everything we had - the sliders, lobster roll, tuna tacos, and the amazing Irish poutin - was incredibly tasty and fresh. The bartender told us the chef is a French Culinary Institute grad. He learned his craft well. A really great place just got even better!
2016-06-24,4,Moran's really upped their game! Order the Moran's burger, you won't be disappointed.
2016-06-15,5,Always enjoyed the atmosphere at the bar. Friendly bartenders and always some good conversation. When the kitchen opened I thought some of the atmosphere might be lost and why do we need another  burger bar? So wrong. The food is fantastic! I've had the pork chop twice now. They have some great appetizers and the service is terrific. Eating outside in a nice quiet neighborhood away from the Washington Street crowd is a huge plus.Drinks are still top notch and now there's food to match.
2016-05-25,5,I've been going to Moran's for the better part of two decades, but was a little wary when It was announced that they would be adding food. Man, I was wrong. My family and I went over for a nice outdoor dinner tonight and it was fantastic. We started with the turkey potstickers (maybe my favorite thing) and rolled through the Irish poutine, fish and chips and a few sliders for the kid. Everything was great, while I'll miss the straight up bar I've loved for years, I'm looking forward to many more good times there in this great new incarnation.
2016-04-25,4,Nice little irish pub, with a sweet cozy interior, and a tasty, yet bizarre menu that is part irish, part british, part mexican and part bro. Wish they had more Irish and European beers on tap, but they have Guiness, so that's the important one.
2016-04-21,5,My bf's favorite after hour bar. Morans is definitely our go-to spot whether we're there to watch a game or have conversation and drinks. I love that the music isn't obnoxiously loud. You can actually have a decent conversation without yelling over the music, unlike other bars in the area. More then likely, you'll find our favorite bartender Kevin behind the bar, always warm and always welcoming. We were fans of this place before but now they have food AND an outdoor eating area! If dinner and a view of the park hasn't sold you yet, the sweet potato wedges will. Thick cut, sweet potato wedges baked and dusted with brown sugar and cinnamon. Regardless of what you order, a side of these wedges are a must. All in all, one of the classier bars in Hoboken and definitely a staple bar for the summer with the outdoor patio addition.
2016-04-15,5,I love Morans. Have been coming here forever. Always happy to see Lenny behind the bar! But since i have moved uptown, I have not ventured back much, but upon hearing they now have food I tried it. I have to say the menu is fabulous. We only got a couple of light items, but they were all good. They have gluten free options for several of my friends (not me- Lol). We had the pizza, shared a salad and got the sweet potato fries. Service and crowd are great. Its very low key, so you can actually have a conversation. We were there early so we watched Jeopardy which was fun, but I have also been there on later nights and the music and vibe are always good.
2016-04-09,5,Easily the best new kitchen in Hoboken, IMO... The food is a notch above the vast majority of "pub food" in Hoboken. I'd put the menu right up there with the better restaurants in town this is NOT everyday pub grub. Delicious.
2016-03-20,5,We've been to Moran's twice since the kitchen opened--brunch and dinner. Food is terrific, a definite cut above typical pub fare. Great atmosphere too and you can still talk to your dinner companions. And no wait for a table; place is busy but no overrun. Staff is attentive and friendly. We'll definitely be back.
2016-03-06,4,Nice bar, went for a Sunday brunch and the place was buzzing! Was unable to partake in drinks due to a crushing hangover but they looked to have a great selection. The Irish Breakfast was top notch. Will definitely be back again.
2016-02-26,4,We've been going to Moran's for over 15 years and we were very excited to hear that they were opening a kitchen. The food was definitely a step above the average pub grub that you get here in town. We started with the Jerk Wings which had fairly authentic jerk flavor but perhaps needed a bit more crisping. Lenny's Classic Shepard's Pie was a very good rendition of standard pub fare and hit the spot on a cold evening. The Cod Almighty fish sandwich was excellent with extremely fresh fish and nice flavors. I'm looking forward to trying more of the menu.
2016-02-19,5,Moran's burger is basically heaven on earth.. soo delicious and that irish bacon situation is beyond amazing..chef vinicio is the shit and lenny is sooo great. I can't wait to basically try everything on the menu (not at once).. i recommend this place to everyone not only is the food delicious but the staff is so nice
2016-02-18,5,Now they have food! Grabbed some drinks with friends. Had the Irish curry mussels...some wings, spinach dip. All really good pub fare for a place that really just opened a kitchen. Coming back for a burger!
2016-02-17,4,surprisingly the Moran's Burger could be the best burger in town. Very surprised to see the great other stuff on the menu. and fun bartenders and crowd as well.
2016-02-14,4,It was so bitterly cold today that we wanted to stay close to home to have some brunch. I remembered hearing that Moran's recently added a kitchen, so we headed there. What a pleasant surprise. Terrific breakfast of perfectly cooked eggs, bacon, potatoes, fruit and multi-grain bread with a nice presentation. My Bloody Mary had good zing. Super-friendly wait staff. We can't wait to try it for dinner.
2016-02-05,5,I've been waiting for the kitchen to open for a long time. I'm not disappointed. Pat la Freda burger is delicious. Big meaty fresh wings as a starter were perfect. amazing atmosphere and great service. You won't go wrong
2016-01-31,5,Staff is so friendly and kind. Great, strong, tasty cocktails. Food is delicious, especially the sweet potato wedges and Irish "poutine"! V. good jukebox too, I love Moran's v much (:
2015-10-20,5,Great local bar nestled away from the fratty bars on Washington St. Staff is great - Kevin takes good care of everyone. The place gets packed on St Patty's day! Morans is the first bar I've ever patronized in Hoboken and it will forever hold a special place in my heart.
2015-04-22,5,Local dive bar. Really small space but really great atmosphere. The bartenders are all really nice and the drinks are good!
2014-02-16,4,Great dive & towny bar for Hoboken - juke box, darts, secluded from the douchery of the rest of the city.  Bartenders are friendly, funny, gracious with buy backs & pours when you are friendly and generous w/ tips.  Wish we knew about earlier!
2013-05-07,3,I really like the inside of the bar, but there are some serious flaws as well. Pros:Darts and other bar gamesLayout and ambiance (very neighborhood feel)Cheap drinksFriendly bartendersGreat place to relax for a couple drinksCons:No foodPoor beer selectionIf you are going to be a drinks-only type of bar, step up your game and get some good taps.
2013-04-10,5,"Great bartenders, great drinks, atmosphere - darts, amazing juke box and buy backs!"What is there not to like about Moran's? It's one of the last true Irish bars in Hoboken. I originally came here to meet one of my buddies who was living in Hoboken and going to Seton Hall Law School what seems like 5 years ago. Since then, I've moved all over Hoboken from Uptown to Downtown and then to Mid-town and consider this bar one of the best and the neighborhood bar to friends, family and all who visit. No matter whom I or friends bring here, they always leave with a smile on their face, staying longer than intended and  one or two many drinks in them and a new bar they love. The best part is, it's as some say, off the beaten path, (aka off Washington Street and not downtown) so it's typically locals during the week and pretty easy to get a seat, yet packed on weekends...When my father or friends come down, I often suggest grabbing a beer or few before going to get something to eat. On one occasion, Kevin had pizzas ordered and my father and I just grabbed a slice or two and watched the 1 and 4 O'clock games. While they weren't previously opened on Sundays they started this past season. As I mentioned above, they don't have food but you may order and have it delivered. It's the Hoboken Cheers. You can be comfortable alone and able to hang out waiting for friends to arrive or just chill with one or two and able to have seats and be able to talk without a thousand people pushing you to get a drink or spot at the bar.
2013-03-14,5,I am not into the bar scene. It's loud, crowded and just downright pathetic. Morans however has changed my view. The Juke Box (worlds most amazing Juke Box actually) is set at such a perfect volume, you can actually TALK to the people at your table instead of screaming at them all night. The layout of the place is perfect, even with the billiards table there are plenty of seats and stools available for a pretty busy night. The scene, the scene is cool. Very mixed crowd, no "tools and douches" (that I saw) and I happened to even see the mayor (think of her what you will) hanging out here. Trust me, this place is great.OH!! I almost forgot... THEY HAVE CLEAN TAPS!! DELICIOUS AND AFFORDABLE BEER!!!
2013-02-19,3,CalmPub withBuck hunterAnd darts. TVsAnd the usual suspects are on tap.
2013-01-12,3,Place has a nice atmosphere got some dart and its away from the usual crowd as far as I know
2013-01-04,5,Morans is the best. Kevin is the man.. Visit Moran's, you won't be dissapointed..
2012-08-27,5,Darts!  Do it!  Laid back neighborhood bar...two dartboards, friendly bartenders, several TVs.  Clean, updated, juke box, great place for relaxing with some friends and a few beers.  Love Morans.
2012-08-23,5,*Sigh* what is there not to like about Morans?  Want a Guinness or shot of Jameson?  No problem!Want a friendly bartender?  All of the guys are great, but Kevin is the best.Want to hear some specific tunes to get your night going?  Dollar Juke Box anyone? Want a very specific type of food?  You can order in from anywhere and eat at Morans.With probable some of the friendliest bartenders in the world and buy-backs at the bar, it is hard not to like Morans.  No outdoor seating, but they have a little room at the back which you can reserve, or, well, just drink and play darts in.  It is definitely a gem off the beaten typical frat and ho-bro bar scene in Hoboken.Go, and ask for Kevin.  They won't disappoint.
2012-07-31,3,I have recently discovered this little place. One of my friends moved just down the street and it is her "neighborhood" bar. Upon entering, there might be a slight musty smell, but don't worry, after a couple of drinks that smell will completely disappear! The drinks are decent, and priced in the same range with those in the area. If you are with a few pretty girls, they might be a little cheaper than average! :PThe bathrooms are pretty clean, and have two stalls (thank you). There are two sets of dart boards that provide lots of entertainment and friend making opportunities. One is in the main bar area and the other is located in a back bar room. They even have a jukebox! The steps leading in and out of this place are a little funky, so be careful! My first time here I went outside to look for my friend who had had a few too many and was drunk dialing a boy toy. I was looking for her and not at the steps and fell and broke my shoe and twisted my ankle! Not cool! Watch your step!
2012-03-14,4,LEPRECON 2012We had a house party! (no violations.) We drank (inside our house!) and we PEED! (in a bathroom). AKA we didn't break the rules.So we left around 5 to hit up a bar, after several rounds of pong, corn hole, flip cup and who knows what else. I chose to drink vodka and SF monster, since I'm off carbohydrates until Ultra. Welp, I was thoroughly IN THE BAG by the time we left. So we somehow ended up in line here...and paid $20 each to enter. St Pat's in the HOB sucks in that regard...E V E R Y bar charges some silly cover. There were lots of legit Irish guys in here. One tried to buy me a shot of Jameson (no, thanks.) and one tried to understand why I was dressed all crazy (I was a rave guido Leprechaun, duh!).We had a blast, and I left my green rhinestone Snooki shades behind as payment. (I actually lost them, but I didn't buy any of my drinks, so we'll call it even.)
2011-04-20,4,A great bar off the beaten path.  This palce never gets really crowded and it has darts and a pool table.  The bartenders are very nice and generous with the drinks.
2010-01-10,2,Pros:- Friendly bartenders (with heavy hands)- Backroom can be reserved for birthdays and such- Powerful beveragesCons:- Off the beaten path- Cramped and easily filled to capacity- Difficult to get served at bar when crowded- Weird old man locals at one end of barVerdict:I don't know too much about the Hoboken bar scene, but this bar seems to be an okay spot. The bartenders were super friendly and very generous with their mixed drinks (we took advantage of a $30 AYCD deal). If anything, it's a good place for groups.
2009-09-26,5,Great place...good crowd and good service.  This place is fantastic, everyone there is just looking to have a good time and chill.  The bartenders will also buy you back...one will buy back w/whatever you are drinking and the other will give you a shot...
2007-02-28,5,Moran's rules.  Kevin is the best bartender in Hoboken.  Go there and you wont be sorry.  Just watch out for Tom the Lawyer.
