2021-10-24,5,Love this place! I went to brunch today and ran a later late for the reservation but the staff was super accomodating and friendly.  The food was delicious, I had the oeufs benedict a la russe and the pastilla au lait which were really good. We all cleaned our plates! LOL The rocking moroccan drink was also a hit.  Overall, the ambiance, the staff, the food were all outstanding. Definitely will go again and recommend.
2021-10-22,5,Walking in on a Friday night was such a beautiful mix of lively chatter and amazing live music. Seating was painless and quick and out waitress Karina was simply amazing. Attentive, funny, and offering recommendations that I personally ended up with loving each and every one. The appetizers were simply superb, and the main course was amazing, and Dessert was truly and authentically French with an American twist. Without getting into specifics, the ambiance, food, and staff were nothing short of amazing. I will absolutely be returning
2021-10-22,5,Had such a great experience at Barbès. I look forward to coming back with friends and family. I made reservations for 7:30 PM to celebrate my friend starting a business. The staff kept me company while I waited, gave excellent recommendations, and now this place has become a favorite for me. I highly recommend this place, go alone, go with friends, go with family...
2021-09-22,5,Came here on a Tuesday night with a party of 3 at 7:30- we made a reservation and sat outside.Nice aesthetic outdoors and relaxed vibe.For drinks we tried; The Rock'n Moroccan which resembles a Mojito but with vodka. It was okay, if you are in the mood for a Mojito then this would be a good choice. Lady Lupo, which was good but very sweet. Montmarte which was my favorite and then Casablanca which was also very good but dangerous ;) For appetizers we got escargot, salade trio, and the grilled calamari. They all were incredible. The calamari was grilled which allowed you to actually enjoy the taste. The escargot was not as earthy tasting as some places which I think was due to the garlic butter white wine sauce. The hummus in the trio was some of the best I've ever had. For entrees we got the rack of lamb with vegetables and potatoes, the bronzini and salmon. The lamb was cook well. The bronzini wasn't as charred as it can be elsewhere, which I enjoyed. The salmon was my favorite. The mustard sauce on top of it is to die for.Overall great experience. The prices are reasonable and the service was great from the hostess to the servers and other staff.
2021-09-17,5,Wow .. I don't even know where to start . I passed by this place and decided to look into it so I could take my boyfriend for his birthday once he likes French food . I also did an Yelp research and found some reviews not so good , but I decided to give it a try and take my own conclusions and here's how it went ....I made a reservation on Resy and made notes that it was a special occasion and it needed to be a great experience. About two weeks later I called to confirm the reservation and the gentleman who answered the phone ( Francisco) was very attentive to my notes , he also answered all my questions and said he would actually love our table to one near the live music once was a special occasion ...So the day comes and we go in..the host was extremely friendly and once I told him it was a special occasion he made it a point of making us feel that way for sure , we had many servers and all Of them where just so efficient and helpful , they knew the dishes very well and suggested many great things . I loved the fact that they have an open kitchen .We had the couscous with chicken , lamb shank with prunes and they were Moroccan dishes and we had garlic shrimp with pesto couscous and that was a French dish , roasted potatoes in the side . Everything was really good but the lamb shank was hands down the best dish I've had in a while , it was so tender it was falling off the bone . For appetizers my boyfriend had his favorite escargot and he said the sauce was really great . We also had grilled calamari and shrimp in garlic sauce . We tried a bottle of Grenache Rose wine ( very good ) For dessert we had baklava and they even brought out a sparkly candle and sang happy birthday to him . Can't thank the hosts and the servers enough . Can't wait to go back and try some different dishes !!!
2021-09-07,2,Sorry to the staff at Barbes about this brutally honest review...you guys are very nice people but the food left a lot to be desired.  Hummus was reasonably ok...kale salad really sucked!  The kale was like garnish from a salad bar---you know, like the inedible lettuce around the edge.  The mussels were ok, the escargot was pretty lousy for a French restaurant.  My daughter thought her branzino was pretty mediocre, my wife thought her halibut tasted like chicken (never a good sign) and my son thought his shrimp were "the worst he's ever had".  Now my vegetable stew was tasty and my S-I-L enjoyed his meal, too.  At the end, when I asked for some sort of discount for the mediocre meals, the waiter kind of laughed and proceeded to bring out a REALLY EXPENSIVE bill for, in general, pretty shitty food.  I STRONGLY suggest eating elsewhere in Hoboken!  I wish I was writing a better review, especially for what I had to fork over!
2021-08-26,1,This is the second time I dine here and I got back to give the place a second chance to surprise me!Tuesday night, 7:30pm, me and my girl friend go there for dinner.We order one appetizer (delicious) and two entrees. I asked if the spicy sauce can be on the side or completely removed, if not I'd order something else. The waiter noted that down and said "absolutely no problem".At 8:45 the waiter comes out saying that there is a delay in the kitchen and our meal would be out soon - no big deal we were having a good time.At 9:20 the entrees got out brought by someone that was not the waiter, her is perfect and very good. Mine is floating in harissa sauce. At that point I ate most of the couscous that wasn't soaked (and that was good) but couldn't have the whole meal because of the spiciness. The waiter then came and asked how everything was and I said that probably something went wrong in the kitchen and that his note got lost, we went back in to check and few minutes after came out apologizing of the mistake.No big deal again we were having a good time. Just before leaving (10:30pm) he came out once more asking (and here I am quoting) "do you have a dessert for your netflix show tonight? or can i pack some baklawa for you?"I thought that was very nice so we said yes! the doggy bag came out and few minutes after the check....They charged us for the whole meal (which is fine even if they made a mistake on my order) AND for the baklawa to go!!! I let the reader draw conclusions but I'm sure I won't give the place a third chance.
2021-08-22,5,Thanks to Resy, we had an outdoor reservation here on Saturday night for a party of 4. They originally sat us in front of the restaurant, but happily moved us to the covered parklet given it was about to rain. It ended up pouring, but thankfully the parklet kept us completely dry. The service was excellent, especially since they were running back and forth in the rain to wait on us.I recommend starting with the Salade Méditerranéenne, a trio of dips with a generous portion of pita; the eggplant zealous dip was the best! Our favorite entrees were the chicken Shawarma and Kefta Tagine lamb meatballs. The Couscous Royale and Couscous Traditionnel were not as flavorful. Portion sizes were just right, and the wine and cocktail lists were on point!
2021-08-21,5,Can't say enough of good things. Very welcoming service with waiters willing to give you in detail recommendations . Leeches martini were so good. Every appetizer was fresh and nice - got a trio combo and burrata. Highlight of experience- pastilla-unique combination of flavors I haven't tasted before
2021-08-19,4,Great spot for a date! Amazing place with cute lights and outdoor seating, live music, and the perfect vibe for a night out. The food is great, and staff are so friendly and perfectly attentive. We had the hummus, briouats, and kefta tagine. Would definitely go again!
2021-08-16,5,My new favorite spot! The ambiance, food, and warm staff make this a 5-star experience. A night out here feels like you're on vacation. Excited to try the sister restaurant when it opens up!
2021-08-10,5,The food at the restaurant is amazing!!!  The hummus was delicious along with the calamari appetizer. The cocktails were delicious and smooth. My lamb meatball was perfect and I also got some spicy sauce to add to the dish. The atmosphere was chill. I met the owner and he was super friendly! This is a great restaurant to experience. I will return soon!
2021-07-31,5,I really love everything about this restaurant - the beautiful and tasteful decor of the outdoor dining space (I have not dined inside yet), great staff, and live music AND amazing food! I was so happy and emotional when I realized this was the same restaurant that was on East 36th Street in Manhattan where I used to live around the corner from, many years ago, which I had dined at once and always remembered that the food was very, very good. I used to pass by it all the time and was sad to see that it had closed before I could try it a second time. But we were destined to meet again in Hoboken!!! It almost brought me to tears. Anyways I will be back. Love this neighborhood gem!!! I recommend the grilled calamari (appetizer), Tangine Lamb, Tangine Chicken, and the Shrimp ("Crevettes au Pistou"), and Pastilla au Lait (dessert).
2021-07-31,1,Really bad brunch experience. Service was disorganized, staff interrupted our conversation and one of our glasses was filthy.My wife ordered lamb medium-well, it came out rare so we sent it back and when it came out again it was still rare. As it was the end of our meal and we asked them to take it off our bill but they refused even though my wife couldn't eat it.We told them we live right round the corner and it  totally baffles me why they would lose a customer who lives so close over $16.
2021-07-26,5,What a wonderful experience we had last week! Everything at this restaurant is great! Everyone is so happy here; I've hadn't seen employees more pleasant! The food is just delicious!!!!! Best Tagine ever!!   And the dessert was simply amazing.  I can't wait to go back!
2021-07-04,2,Vegetarians - don't come here!Vegetarian entrees are limited to a vegetable cous cous and a stew. I got the cous cous and it was super dry and bland in spite of using all of the provided sauce / soup.Burrata salad was tasty.Service is good and enthusiastic, but they never refilled our water.
2021-07-03,5,Great food, awesome ambience. Barbes is our go-to restaurant in Hoboken. Everyone is super friendly and the vibe is always fun, especially when the band is playing.
2021-07-03,5,Thank you, and mercí. What a comfortable cool atmosphere. A real gem of Hoboken. Don't tell anyone.
2021-06-25,1,I hate to be writing this review because it is a beautiful restaurant but the experience was poor. Everyone was definitely friendly and the food was good. But the service was terrible. We got seated at 9:10 for an 8:30 reservation. We didn't mind because it's a Friday night and that can happen. But then it took over an hour for the main course to come out. The water was never refilled during the entire duration of the meal even when asked. We tried to be patient because it was crowded so didn't express any annoyance. Then we waited another 40 minutes for the check but unfortunately no one was coming to our table so I had to go to the front to pay. I wanted to have dessert but no one was attending to us and we didn't want to get caught there for another large chunk of time. After that, we asked for 2 takeout boxes for the table because we didn't want to have to wait too long for our leftovers to be boxed in the kitchen. However, after waiting 10 minutes those didn't arrive. So we once again had to go to the front to request them. For the prices and a check so high, I'm really disappointed. But everyone was really friendly and the atmosphere was pleasant so that was nice to appreciate.
2021-06-20,5,This restaurant was fantastic!After my date and I were running late to another place, he booked us a reservation here and it was the best decision of the night. The servers were super friendly and the food was delicious. We both had Shawarma on a bed of greens, and I included it with a side of french fries. During our stay, the entire place was having a huge party. I don't know if this is a regular occurrence, but when we went there was another table celebrating a birthday and the restaurant had them doing conga lines around the room and they also had a guy on a saxophone interacting with the customers. The music was very loud that you can barely hear anybody, so that might be a flaw for some people and if you really can't stand loud noise or parties then I suggest to avoid this place. However, I'm saying as someone who normally does not get into big events that this was a fun experience. You really get into the spirit of the place and I would love to go again. My only complaint is that they missed a little spot of food on our table when we were seated (it looked liked spinach). That could land them in a heat of trouble with somebody who could file a complaint, but I decided to let it pass. Overall, wonderful location and fun environment. I don't think one leftover piece of spinach is enough to change 5 stars into a 4, but just pay close attention to the details next time!
2021-06-13,5,This place is incredible. The live music and good vibes are infectious. The drinks are great and food is even better. Everything is so authentic and yummy, and there's no bad dish on the menu. A great, neighborhood spot to bring friends and family for good food and a good time.
2021-05-25,5,Love this place! Food was excellent (best hummus I've ever had). The staff was super accommodating and friendly. And we really enjoyed the live music!
2021-05-25,5,This place was so good and fun. I have never had French Moroccan style food in my life but I am so happy this is in Hoboken and I was able to go. The menu is incredible and extensive. We went for dinner and sat outside. There was soft music playing and it was a gorgeous night. Can't wait to go back to order some of the other amazing things on the menu. Try the mint tea as an after dinner refreshment.
2021-05-14,3,Food and the list of wines has been getting better over the years, but it still has difficulty with prompt service and charging the wrong items or extra charging. The attention from every individual who works there is excellent. Music is the same every Thursday. Making a rotation of musicians per week would be more inviting. Great to stop by for a drink, quick meal or dinner. Enjoyable atmosphere. Good spot in Hoboken.
2021-05-13,3,While the service here was great, the food was "meh". I was surprised because I felt like it would be super flavorful - however - it was pretty opposite. My keftes were kind of dry and lacking flavor. A bit of a disappointment because this place is so cute.
2021-05-11,5,Their food is delicious.  There is a small bar and a nice dining room atmosphere with wonderful service every time we have been here.  Recently we were with friends who ordered the lentil salad and raved about it,  I tend to always have the fish that is usually Branzino.  And it is always delicious.  The broccoli rabe is wonderful and their wine prices are very reasonable.  My only complaint is sometimes this restaurant can get to noisy for my tastes.  But I tend to like quieter restaurants.  We were there recently and the staff is incredible but we could not even hear the friends we were dining with do to the band playing. The band was great but not the noise level.   Always wonderful to be off Washington street also for dinner.
2021-05-09,1,It was a very disappointing experience. It was excellent before. Not sure we will try out again. We had ordered 4 dishes. The food given to us was cold. We asked for freshly squeezed orange juice. We were given Tropicana instead. Also a beer was served which was warm not chilled. Overall a bad experience for a Sunday brunch.
2021-04-24,4,2nd time here and the food is yummy. Lots of vibe!  We sat outside.  Friendly and attentive staff.Snails- wow!!  These will win you over to snails! Eggplant - sooo good Grilled calamari -  give me seconds!Lamb tangine - this is okSteak- delicious!Mussels- I'm not a mussels fan but everyone raves about them including my mom who ordered some to go!!
2021-04-23,5,I had my birthday here with my parents and husband, and loved the French cuisine. Our waiter was very courteous and seemed dedicated to ensuring that any request or question we had about the menu was answered. My husband is French and also found the food to be delicious. This place really stands out in the Hoboken restaurant scene.
2021-04-14,2,We made a reservation for Tuesday at 6:00 PM. We were sat outside - the place is really nice and their outdoor set up is great. We ordered a bottle of wine, an appetizer and our dinner entrees shortly after being seated. We did receive our bottle of wine about 30 minutes later. But about an hour and 15 minutes in we started wondering where our appetizer (just hummus lol) was. We were told that our order was just never put in at that time. At about 7:30 we received our hummus but there was no pita bread ready so we patiently waited and at about 8:00 we finally had our full appetizer. Our entrees arrived at about 8:45, we both got the Shawarma. I wish I could say at that point the food was great - the chicken was over cooked and dry. The meal and two bottles of wine came out to be $170. In my opinion the cost was not worth the service we received. Although our server was very kind, there was little apology. The tables surrounding us had all left before us and were served properly. This was a strange experience to say the least and I'm not sure why it happened. I never expected to leave my 6:00 PM dinner reservation at 10:00 PM.... on a Tuesday.
2021-04-08,3,More spice which is not first two words expect to say at a place with Moroccan in cuisine type.  For French food okay though salted and peppered my seasonal vegs and used broth from tagine.   Chicken in tagine was flavorless.  Lamb was good.  Couscous could have used twice as much broth.  Cocktail was good and red wine list extensive by glass and bottle.  White wine had only few options.  Could use a California chard or at minimum  a Poilly Fuise and some other good white full bodied blend plus some better choices by bottle.Service was okay any plenty of outside seating.
2021-04-04,2,We called ahead to understand the difference between "outdoor" and "terrace" reservations and were told that outdoor reservations were in the heated parklet. When we showed up with a reservation for outdoor we were sat at a table with a broken heater. I asked our waiter to please get a heater or move us to a table with a working heater....after about 10 minutes they brought one over.Our waiter tried to rush our ordering before the heater was brought over and explained that they were very busy that night...not a great vibe after already being mislead with seating options. We ordered the French onion soup, salmon and burger. The soup was inedible and the broth tasted like water...my husbands was slightly better and at least had an essence of onion flavor. I only ate a few bites of the soup and when the waiter came back to take our plates there was no ask if everything was ok. My salmon lacked flavor and the "seasonal" vegetables served with it tastes like a microwaved frozen vegetable medley. I should have known seeing as every picture of the dish includes the same "seasonal" vegetables of broccoli, carrots and green beans. The burger was the most edible item we received. While we were waiting for our check the manager or owner was checking on other tables and we overheard him joking about how customers should "BYOP" or bring their own propane...I think this restaurant should rather not falsely advertise heated outdoor seating if they are unable to provide it. All of the positive reviews appear to be posted by paid or gifted Hoboken/JC food bloggers. Don't believe the hype and go somewhere better.
2021-04-01,5,We loved every single bite and sip of what we had at Barbes! This was my first time trying this spot but it will not be my last. Excellent service, delicious and fresh food, and some really awesome and reasonably priced (for the area) cocktails on the menu.
2021-03-07,5,Grear food, great service, great atmosphere, geat place to get engaged!! And I said, 'Yes!'.
2021-03-01,5,The absolute best in Hoboken. Omar and Lisa are lovely and they make this place feel like you are in Paris. The staff is attentive and kind and they only care about you having the best dining experience. I love it here, and go out of my way to bring friends from Manhattan here to show them how wonderful Hoboken can be. This is my favorite restaurant and I'm so glad they are in Hoboken!
2021-02-21,5,Where do I even start? This place was amazing all around. The food was carefully and deliciously prepared. Our appetizers (escargots, and shrimp in garlic sauce) were exquisite. My sirloin steak was simply perfectly cooked medium well. Our chocolate mousse was one of the best I've had. But enough about our tasty meals, as that was not the most impressive thing about this restaurant. It's exemplary customer service. From the reception to the moment we stepped out of the restaurant, everyone's politely, attention to details, willingness to go above and beyond is something to experience for yourself. To top it all off, the live music the perfect touch to an already excellent atmosphere. These 5 stars are well earned. We will certainly revisit this restaurant.
2021-02-12,3,Located in Hoboken, Barbes is a French/Moroccan restaurant. Overall food was good. But I think it's more towards Moroccan. Also they had a live jazz band for the dinner event, which was entertaining.
2021-01-27,5,We had dinner here last Sunday night after an impromptu visit to the Hoboken Historical Museum.  It was so nice to dine inside - the space is beautiful, the food is delicious and everyone working there was so nice and attentive.  Highly recommend!
2021-01-24,5,My friends and I came here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. There was surprisingly no wait but we also came at almost 2pm. The beverages, food, and desserts were all exceptional. The service was great as well. Overall a really cute, affordable French Moroccan restaurant in Hoboken and I will definitely be back again!
2021-01-23,4,I loved the atmosphere and food here! They even had live music during the holidays which was so festive. My only gripes are that they (1) barely put any alcohol in the cocktails and (2) some of the staff had their masks down not covering their noses. That did make me uncomfortable and I am not sure how soon I will go back for that reason. The tables were also closer together than I'd like but the mask thing was more concerning to me. But the food is incredible. Maybe takeout instead next time?
2021-01-23,5,I have never had a bad meal here and the service is always excellent. The owners run a fantastic place with quality meals, great prices and a cool atmosphere no matter what season. Very excited to eat at their new spot when it is opened.
2021-01-23,4,This place is outstanding. Food was delicious and service impeccable. Went for dinner a few weeks back and brunch last weekend. Got the meatballs which I highly recommend. My bf got the lamb brochettes which were delicious but the portion was a little small. Go for the quinoa as the side.
2021-01-20,2,I'm confused by the positive reviews for this restaurant. Our meal was unfortunately absolutely terrible. We had the salmon and the steak. It's an open kitchen so we watched our food be cooked in MICROWAVES. The service was great though, very attentive and the ambience was cute. But goodness gracious the food was awful LOL. Stop using microwaves!!
2021-01-16,5,This is some of the best food I've ever had in Hoboken! The staff is so helpful and nice! The owner even came over to explain our dishes. I got the shawarma over greens (suggested by our waiter) and it was FANTASTIC! Such a huge portion size and so so tasty. My friend got the *chicken in bread* dish (butchering that name) and another got the meatballs with couscous. All three were absolutely delicious. 10/10!!!!!! Will be back!
2021-01-15,5,Had dinner there last night for the first time with friends, and we had such a great experience overall. The friendliness of the staff, the delicious diverse food, and the live music and aesthetic of the restaurant...overall 5 out of 5 experience! Would def go back!
2021-01-06,5,Great spot with indoor and outdoor dining. My favorite part had to be the mac & cheese so so good I would definitely come back for this dish again.
2021-01-05,5,So my hubs and I have been to Barbès twice now. Once for dinner and once for brunch. Both times the experience has been INCREDIBLE. 5stars for the food, 5stars for the service, 5stars for the ambiance. There is something so special about this place. Did i say 5stars for the service? Think i meant 7. Its like you feel at home. Everything we tried on the menu is delicious. Steak & eggs, the tagine, the fromage omlette, and a bunch of dinner items when we were there. Canmt wait to go back and try more stuff. Also they had a hot cider wine thing (muddy wine i think it was called). So so delicious. Just perfect for these cold days. A true neighborhood gem. Cannot recommend it enough.
2021-01-05,4,I haven't dined at Barbes since it first opened, so I decided to give it another shot for brunch.  My friend and I were able to make a last minute same day reservation to eat outside.  The table we were sitting at didn't have a heater since they were out of kerosene, so the owner setup a mini space heater by our table.  It was very sweet and accommodating of her.  We also got samples of mulled wine when we arrived.  We shared a bottle of Pinot Noir with our meal.  I tried the Croque Madame sandwich which was very tasty and had plenty of meat in it.  My friend had the chicken Shawarma which you can have served over either pita or quinoa.  She enjoyed her dish but if she were ever to have it again, she'd ask for no onions since there were a lot in it.  Both dishes came with fries which were good.  When the bill came, the wine was more expensive than what was listed on the menu, but our server made the adjustment without issue.  I was very pleased with the service the entire time and it was a nice, leisurely meal.  I would definitely try out dinner here again.
2021-01-01,4,Came to Barbes for my boyfriend's birthday and had an amazing experience! The food was delicious! We started with some yummy warm Harira soup and then had the branzino and traditional couscous. The chocolate mousse fulfilled our dessert cravings! One serving is great for two people. Victor was serving our table and he was very friendly and catered to our needs. The ambiance is great but the live music was a little too loud. Overall, we had a great experience and would definitely  come here again! Highly recommend this spot to people who want to try authentic Moroccan food -- we left Barbes satiated!
2020-12-19,5,I have been to Barbès twice in two weeks now, and I can't wait to go back. I have been looking for a good Moroccan restaurant in New Jersey for years now, and I am very glad that I've finally found one.Everything about this restaurant is perfect, from the atmosphere, to the food, to the service. I have eaten only outside, but even on a 30 degree night, I felt warm with their heat lamps and mulled wine. Eating here feels like you have been transported to another time period. The mulled wine is made outside in front of all of the diners. The decor is classy and not overwhelming. The waiters, manager, hostess and everyone else are so nice and accommodating. On both visits, I had hummus for an appetizer. Their hummus is the best hummus I have had in the United States and on par with hummus you can find at restaurants in the Middle East. The pita bread they serve is fresh, and they quickly replenish it. On my first visit, I had the couscous with chicken as my main course. The couscous is served in a beautiful covered dish, with the broth on the side, with a ladle to add as much broth as you want. The chicken was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. On my second visit, I had the couscous with lamb, and it was just as wonderful, and the lamb fell right off the bone.I only went for dessert on my second visit, but it made me wish I had opted for it the prior visit also. The pastilla was amazing and left me wanting more. I would recommend this restaurant and it's wonderful staff to anyone. It is a treasure and I could not be happier that I found it.
2020-12-19,5,I love this place. Super friendly staff. Great vibe. Had the Steak Au Poivre and the Pastilla. Delicious. The drinks were great too. The Montmarte and the Marie-Antoinette drinks were the best. The Pastillas Au Lait desser was great too. Only downside was that they only gave me 1 basket of pita bread but I could've eaten 12.
2020-12-04,5,Wonderful ambience, courteous staff. Loved the food and experience of french moroccan dining. Will come again :)
2020-11-21,5,This place is awesome. The food was delicious I actually felt like I was in Paris (after a few mimosas of course). Brunch was outstanding. Service was great and they had no problem substituting for a vegetarian diet-- something that's hard to find! I can't wait to come back and try more on the menu. Really such a gem in Hoboken
2020-11-07,1,If you're looking for halal food then you're looking at the wrong place. Its advertised as being Moroccan food but its more of a french restaurant. If you're looking for halal food and you're Muslim, its best to find another place to go. I was very disappointed being misled by the "Moroccan food" advertising.
2020-11-03,4,The service is absolutely phenomenal, the environment is amazing! I am one star short because I didn't enjoy the food as much as I would've liked. It was very pungent. I ordered the meat balls and I tasted the lemon chicken and the mixed couscous. Extremely pungent for me and my family but it might be of someone else's taste if they like very pungent food. They deserve the 4 stars because of the service. Waiter was amazing and so was the owner
2020-10-15,5,Amazing spot. I can't wait to come back. We came here for a girls night on Thursday for cocktails and dinner. The food is 5 stars along with the ambience and the staff. They play jazz during the evenings which makes you feel like you're in Paris. The lamb meatballs are to die for. Can't wait to return
2020-10-14,4,We had such a great anniversary dinner at this special spot in Hoboken. We sat outside on a chilly night, but the heat lamps gave off more than enough warmth. We started with a bottle of Syrah and the cheese board, which was extremely generous with portions. Would've loved some more unique picks, but it was delicious nonetheless. For mains, we enjoyed the Poulet Provencal/half roast chicken and the peppercorn steak. Both were cooked to perfection, but wish my food was a bit hotter! Overall, a great experience. Will be back!
2020-10-10,5,From the food to the service to wine. Excellent, excellent excellent. We had the hummus and tanging for the Morrocan flair and the steak for my 4 year old. Dessert was excellent followed by the best mint tea.
2020-09-25,5,AMAZING restaurant - service FOOD! and outdoor seating... so pretty!I had never been to a restaurant of this kinda and they were so great at teling me what things were and recommending things I ended up LOVING!!!GREAT Date spot!Oh! and there was a live jazz duo there when I had dinner - amazing!
2020-09-15,5,Best dinner in Hoboken in years. Food was a 10/10, drinks were a 10/10, service was an 11/10. The owner, Omar, wants to sit and talk over everything with you in the best way possible.It takes a lot for me to actually write a Yelp review. This was so good, I had no choice.
2020-09-12,3,Hit or miss again. The food can be great sometimes, and awful other times. Check out the pictures from food ordered on 9/12/20. I wonder if they have two different cooks. Something is off in their kitchen.
2020-09-11,3,I have heard amazing things about Barbès and was very excited to try it out. Although the staff was so nice and friendly, and they have a great outdoor dining section with music, it wasn't what I thought it would be. I thought the cocktails could be better, as well as our entrees. We also found that the meals and drinks were super slow to come out and took away from the overall experience. I really hope to come back and give this restaurant a better review because I think it may have been a one off experience.
2020-09-01,5,Amazing experience at this little bistro. Live music and wonderful food - together with great service. We have tried to support local restaurants through these challenging times - and what we found here was a place that was uplifting and just plain fun. Cannot thank the management and staff enough for keeping it together and offering a great experience across the board. Just wonderful!!
2020-08-30,2,Very slow service, couldn't flag a waiter for 20 mins to get water, appetizers came after the entrees (which took 50 mins to get). The hache salad was missing half of the main ingredients, the fattoush poulet was cafeteria quality, actually below cafeteria quality, and the Mediterranean shrimp was average. The pastilla and mojito was good.
2020-08-30,5,The food went apeshit and the drag show was truly the seretoin boost I needed. The drink menu was also very very good and had a wide range of things
2020-08-30,5,I would definitely say this is one of the best resturants in Hoboken. I've been here a couple times, once for dinner and once for brunch. Whether it's brunch or dinner, I highly recommend ordering the lamb tagine. It's one of their signature dishes and hands down one of the best lamb meatballs I've ever had. The ambiance of this place is really nice and the staff is very accomodating. Highly recommend this spot
2020-08-30,5,We passed by randomly one night and I exclaimed out loud, "Is this Barbes?" The owner heard me and was so friendly by encouraging us to come back to dine. We were even given a menu. About a month later, we made reservations here with another couple for dinner. The outdoor dining was on point! We felt like we were transported in Paris. There was even live music which added to the ambience. I adored the little blue chairs. As for the food, the Branzino was sooo good. It was smoky and had flavor unlike at other restaurants where I've had it. My boyfriend got the Rack of Lamb (can't go wrong- so much flavor) and our friends got the special for the night: Scallops with cauliflower with the Kefta Tagine. The drinks were just ok. We waited a long time for dessert which was pastillas au lait so by the time it hit our table, it was no longer crispy. Be forewarned, service is a bit slow but we think it's because they're understaffed and it's also European style where you're supposed to take your time and enjoy your food. I will definitely be back. Oh and the waiter was super friendly. We just felt the warmth from this place!
2020-08-23,5,Yes! What a great spot- although I wasn't impressed with the main entree the appetizers were delicious! Making a Resy prior was super easy- highly recommend!! We tried 2 fun cocktails Montmarte (SO good) and The Rock'N Moroccan. To start we tried Salade Mediterraneen -trio appetizer of dips (hummus was delicious) and the Moules Mariniere Appetizer-  white wine mussels (amazing!) We really loved both dishes though next time I'll likely pass on the trio of dips and go for the garlic shrimp! Entree was just ok we tried the Couscous Royale, the sausage was very spicy and chicken was dry but lamb was really delicious. I'm not a couscous lover so it just wasn't that great to me but I'm not used to Moroccan food. For dessert we had chocolate mousse - perfect ending! We will def be back to try something new- so fun! The staff was kind and attentive - live music and ambience was 10/10!!
2020-08-23,5,This place is a hidden gem in hoboken. The food and service was amazing. They also had live entertainment. Will be back.
2020-08-06,3,Outdoor dining feels very European with the plants and lighting, loved the ambiance. I'm only giving 3 stars Bc of the service Bc the food was good. This place is verrrryyyyyy sloooowwwww. If you have little patience it's not the spot for you. It took 30 minutes from when we sat down to get drinks. Apps took forever entrees took forever. We were there 3 hours. Not Bc we were having some big party but Bc that's how long everything took to get. Normally dinner is what, 1.5-2hrs? And then I had to get up and find the waiter inside to ask for our check, and even then it took another ten min.
2020-08-03,5,Always a pleasure to be greeted by Omar.  They have done a really nice job with that tables outside.   Super glad they are back.  Some new items on the menu for summer.  They need some wine specials during the week!
2020-08-01,5,I went to this place on a Friday night and booked a reservation through Resy for 7pm. They had live music that was a perfect touch to start the weekend. We got there and was treated by a very attentive staff. That includes the owner who is always engaging customers and making everyone feel at home. He went over to our table to introduce himself and brought us extra pita bread for the hummus. Let me tell you that this fresh out of the oven pita bread, coupled with hummus was everything our table needed to start the meal. Highly recommend! We ordered the lamb meatballs, branzino, and shrimp pesto dish. By far one of the most intriguing flavors that you can experience in Hoboken. I personally had the shrimp and was blown away. My girlfriend had the meatballs and was raving all night!To end it we ordered the chocolate mousse and it was great with some espresso. The staff was very professional and kept the place extremely clean
2020-07-30,5,Finally made it to Barbes. The most amazing atmosphere, best in Hoboken by far with the live music. Food and drinks were on point and portions were very good for the price. The experience couldn't have been better and the owners are very friendly. True passion of their business, will certainly be back very soon.  One of my new favorite spots!
2020-07-23,5,I went to Barbes for Sunday brunch and it was so lovely! The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive. All of them taking covid precautions very seriously...felt very safe, socially distanced and beautiful parklet with some shade. The food was incredible! My friends and I split a crepe and then did shawarma salad, a hamburger and lamb meatballs with egg. All of it was so good but the crepe really stands out...I'm not normally a sweet person but this was extra special. I can't wait to go back and try dinner! Highly recommend and At points felt like I was in a lovely little cafe in Europe.
2020-07-22,5,Would give this place 6 stars if I could!Came with a party of 6 to celebrate that we were approved to outdoor dine. We ordered appetizers to share (burrata and salade mediterraneenee), both delicious! For dinner, we each ordered different things (Salmon, Mussels, Grilled Pesto Shrimp, Steak) - no complaints on food here. Everything was very tasty and cooked with flavor! I personally had the mussels and they were so tasty.What stood out here was the staff. Victor, our waiter was such a sport and did a fantastic job. Our glasses were never empty! Had a great attitude and was truly hustling to make sure his tables were being served. He even took the time to explain the concept behind French/Moroccan cuisine!We also had the pleasure of meeting and chatting with Lisa & Omar (Owners). THEY WERE FANTASTIC! They took the time to chat with us and we cannot wait to return. We live downtown and will certainly make the walk uptown to return for some more of Barbés!!
2020-07-09,5,I've lived in Hoboken now for 3 years and haven't been here yet. I had a group of friends, one wedding and two birthdays to celebrate, who I wanted to treat to a night on the town outdoor dining style. It was raining most of the day so I made a call to see if we'd stay dry. A nice gentleman who I later learned was named Victor assured me we'd be okay. Upon arrival, we were treated to a beautiful table underneath tree cover with ample seating and distance from others. All servers wore masks and gloves and even provided sanitizer. Victor was our server, and the owner Omar came to greet and thank us. Service was great, appetizers were amazing, and entrees were incredible (bronzini is a big recommendation). They even gave us a nice celebration at the end for the birthdays. Can't recommend enough.
2020-07-01,4,I went to Barbès for outdoor dining. The atmosphere was perfect for a date night. The staff was very courteous & provided great recommendations on drinks & food. The owner came and spoke with us about Barbès & ensured we were enjoying everything. For appetizers, we got the Salad Mediterranean, which was a trio of eggplant, hummus, and chakchouka dips served with grilled pita - highly recommend! We then split the crevettes au pistou and the brochette de poulet between two people. The crevettes au pistou was incredible - the coriander harissa sauce provided heat, but wasn't overly spicy. I will definitely be ordering this again. The brochette de poulet was okay, but I will be trying something else next time. For cocktails, we ordered the rock'n morroccan, which was very fresh, and the casablanca- both drinks were delicious. We will be returning for dinner and for Sunday drag brunch soon!
2020-03-23,5,LOVE this place - the staff is super friendly, and it's adorably decorated inside. The menu is different without being weird - a nice break when you want something other than Italian! The food is delicious and authentic - definitely try a chicken brochette or kefta tagine. (I've been to Morocco and these dishes truly bring me back there!) They also have outdoor seating, a great place even for just a glass of rose and hummus in the summer!
2020-03-09,2,Terrible experience and the food was very bland. Only two start for nice decor and the Tati Martini. My wife handed a coat to the waitress who said it's so fluffy and preceded to rub her face on it. The coat is white, what if some of her makeup rubbed of on it?Appetizer was Briouats which were finished with powdered sugar. I ordered it to see if the flavors play well together, but boy was I wrong. Couscous Royal was a let down with very band flavors and just came with a broth which was no help. My wife dis not even eat a tenth of the dish.Crevettes Au Pistou was not any better, I was hungry so I ate only she shrimp. Unfortunately, bad experience all around. I won't be returning.
2020-02-20,5,Going to keep this one so short and sweet, JUST GO TO THIS PLACE. Located in Hoboken, you already know the parking situation HOWEVER, there is a parking lot across the street (Trader Joes lot) and it isn't overly expensive. ** DRAG BRUNCH 2ND SUNDAY OF EVERY MONTH**Drag Brunch was so much fun! It is nice to this place and they do a fab job of planning, making sure everyone has a spectacular time. 2/2 FoodThe food here is actually phenomenal! I've been here on a few occasions for dinner and Drag Brunch (2nd Sunday of every month) and everything is perfect! If you are intrigued by Moroccan and French food all in one, this is the place to go. Lamb meatballs? BOMB. Hummus? BOMB. BRANZINI? BOMB. You name it, and it's 100% bomb.com. 2/2 PriceFor the authenticity and quality of food and service for Hoboken, you cannot go wrong nor complain. 1/1 Service Service is 100% the reason I keep returning. On my first visit, we met Brian, our front staff host, and he was amazing. Literally, he spent time to get to know us and made us feel so welcomed. Fast forward to a month later, I came back for Drag Brunch and he still remember my boyfriend and I and greeted us with such warm, open arms. So while the food is great, atmosphere is dope, the people are the best.
2020-02-15,5,I've read that Barbes was a hidden gem in Hoboken but they definitely exceeded expectation. Did Barbes for brunch and had the lamb meatballs. Amazing. Feel like they have an incredible attention to detail from the toasting of the free bread to the ambiance of restaurant. Definitely want to come back for dinner.
2020-02-09,4,Heard about this place from coworker & was intrigued hearing it was a French Moroccan restaurant. And wow. Walking in was like entering in a speakeasy in the city. Lovely lamps hanging from the ceiling mixed matched with disco balls for a flare, the bar is lit up and the ambience was classy loungey. There was a crowd already, half filled & appeared that reservations are necessary.Parking can be a strain! But after your time here, it's worth the stress. A must s/o to our graceful host Brian & our attentive waiter Lucas! It was restaurant week & it got very hectic for the kitchen & staff. Despite having to wait so long for our apps which were forgotten & had skipped to our entrees, we got comped an extra hummus by the thoughtful owner Omar and got the attention to prioritize our meals. Hummus had texture but I like the creamier ones... it came with freshly toasted pita.The escargot is phenomenal! They were herbed & when you taste them, it's as if they melted in your mouth. We even loved the left over herbs with our fries.The lamb tangine was actually portioned well & amazing.. it's like a stew with carrots & figs, the lamb was tender & soft. It came with a side of couscous.Our dessert blew us away pastilla au lait! Layers of crispy crisps like corn flakes, drizzled with a rosewater syrup & sprinkled with nuts :O Big fan of this place! And they also begun a drag brunch show once a month! Merci Merci Merci!
2020-01-25,4,A really nice date night... the interior is really beautiful, and it's a great place to try something new. The food is delicious, but I'd only go if you like Moroccan food or are in the mood for Moroccan food. (Obviously).  Overall I enjoyed my time there, but I probably wouldn't go back anytime soon. I was vegan when I went, so I can only talk to the vegan food they have here. Maybe if I start eating meat again, I'll come back to try a different dish!
2020-01-20,3,The place was full and it seemed like the waiters couldn't maintain it, it took about 15 min for us to get two glasses of wine, staff was friendly and apologized for the delay. The appetizers we're mediocre at best, the hummus seemed like it was cooked way ahead of time and was refrigerated, hummus is supposed to be kept in a pot and served warm. The roasted eggplant was very cold, again seemed like it was pre cooked way ahead of time. The shrimp in garlic was ok, kind of lacked in flavor and shrimps themselves were relatively small. The lamb tajin was good, it had a nice sauce and we enjoyed it.Overall I think it did not justify the price for me.
2020-01-19,5,Absolutely delicious, great vibe and super friendly staff. We are at the bar just before the dinner crowd came in. Very personable bartender and even got to jive with the owner. If you have any appreciation for Moroccan cuisine with the added no ya of well crafted cocktails then definitely check this place out. Briouats: that awesome combination of crispy crust with homey yummy filling..typical savory and slightly sweet combo chicken stuffing.  Kefta tagine: meatballs were tender and flavorful. Accompanying tomato base just as well balanced. Side of couscous just the right amount of carb to go with it   Dessert: blanking on the name but has "pastilla " in menu. Love anything with rose water and again, great balance of crispy, creamy, floral and toasted carb.  Special shoutout to bartender Victor..excellent cocktails along with conversation!
2020-01-11,5,Amazing food. Absolutely delicious . I loved the decor and vibe.Staff & service very friendly and welcoming.Will definitely go back.
2020-01-06,4,Such a cute, romantic little restaurant hidden on 13th Street. With so many Italian restaurants in Hoboken, Barbes is quite the needed unique spot in the neighborhood. The food is yummy as are the drinks. The prices are pretty average, not overly expensive, but still a nice place with a nice dining experience. I've now had the chicken tagine twice, the salade mediterraneen, and montrachet (which was very different!) The menu is vast and there's numerous items that I would still like to try. Bottles of wine are pretty reasonable, under $40. Service is good, attentive, and not rushed. I'd recommend making a reservation, which you can do on Resy (plenty of availability for the most part!) It's a nice change of pace for Hoboken, I think that's the best part of Barbes! Definitely will keep coming back.
2020-01-04,5,No place like it in Hoboken :) love the atmosphere and wine list in particular. Barbes you were desperately needed in this town!
2019-12-21,5,Honestly. This should be a supper club. The staff is amazing, the service is top notch, the food is A grade. Must visit.
2019-12-21,5,This place is truly a destination to be had in Hoboken. I can't even put into words how phenomenal every visit here has been. It takes a lot for me to leave a review or truly be excited about a place, yet here I am. Cocktails, food, atmosphere, perfection. COME HERE. Trust me....Plus Omar... the best of the best.
2019-12-21,5,Unbelievable. Best service, best food, best drinks ever. Hidden gem! Freshest food, unique spices to delight the pallet ! City vibes in a warm, family-oriented atmosphere. The owner is the nicest human you'll ever meet. Can't wait to come back soon!
2019-12-16,1,what started as a lovely dinner, cozy vibes and great cocktails, turned into highway robbery. Cocktails were on par, then we began to order the waiter suggested changes to our order, of course suggesting the most expensive things on the menu, but because I'm a decent person I took it as suggestions which I personally don't mind. They know the menu better after all. Got our food, I guess decent but drastically under seasoned. So if you are looking for Hoboken's most bland entrees, this is the spot for you. Now, I don't even write reviews, like ever. But I kept finding myself telling people this story about this place even a week later and everyone suggested writing a review. So here I am, letting everyone know to empty their wallets for a night of unwanted banter and unflavored food. The host repeatedly came to our table to check on us, sat down with us, asked about us, which honestly was really nice until I realized he was just working us. At the end of our meal and sitting at our table he asked if we wanted a shot with him, now I really would never casually have a tequila shot after my dinner but hey why not. He came back with the shots (for myself, my friend and himself) we did a cheers, a hug, and got the check. That's when he charged us for the shots, like really dude? $14 dollars each. It's not about the money, it's not about the blend AF food, it's about feeling like someone is sitting at the table with you enjoying your company to feeling like you just got robbed. Oh, and $7 for a club soda, A PLAIN NON ALCOHOLIC CLUB SODA.
2019-12-07,5,Brian !!! Thank you for an amazing Saturday night dining experience you made our evening truly special... Now onto the meal itself succulent, great portions I had the Lamb meatballs and let me tell you .. melted in my mouth umm, umm, umm delish and the couscous was perfectly made the best accompaniment. I will be visiting just for dessert over and over again the best baklava ever...Thank you Barbès the most friendly and attentive staff love you guys
2019-12-01,5,This is one of our favorite restaurants in Hoboken. The food is delicious, it has great ambience, and the service is amazing. They are also incredibly kid and baby friendly and kind in general. We always get a warm greeting and really feel at home there. I cant recommend this place enough. We will be going there for many years to come!
2019-11-24,3,Are you a tiny person with small hands or a child with a passion for exotic Moroccan food? Then this is your paradise. Never have I experienced such good food on such a tiny little table. It was a party of two and we sat at a  clipboard (let's not use the word table) which allowed for  a fun game of food Tetris once it arrived. Another great game to play when at a nice restaurant is "Whose my waiter?! Team effort waiting service always makes it fun to just grab someone you think works there and ask for stuff. Is it the owner? Maybe. Is it a bus boy that doesn't know what is on the menu? Absolutely. So much fun.All of that being said, the food is great. Authentic flavors and quality Moroccan dishes (yes I've been to Morocco). I might go back, but not when it's busy so I can pick my table and get a proper waiter.
2019-11-11,5,Hubby and I tried this spot for a date night last Saturday.  What a find! We will definitely be back.  From the moment we entered the service was welcoming and on point.  We shared a mussels appetizer, enjoyed a beautiful bottle of red wine (too many wine lists at some places around here are terrible), and two main dishes.  I had the lamb sausage and hubby tried the Branzino filet.  The food was truly delicious and the ambiance perfect as well.  We chatted with the staff about our visit(s) to Morocco - and it's clear they are passionate and really love what they've brought to Hoboken.  Go and enjoy! No photos this time because we were so happy and present in the moment.
2019-11-10,5,Barbes is that local restaurant you will be back at over and over again. The waitstaff will know your name, favorite dish and drink. The owner or manager will see you and come over for a quick chat. I can't believe this was my first time at this restaurant after living in the area for so long. But it definitely won't be my last time. The food is amazing! Reminded me of my too long ago trip to Paris, eating at a Moroccan restaurant exactly like this one! And the flavors at Barbes don't disappoint!! Delicious branzino, shrimp in garlic sauce app, lamb meatballs in a tasty tomato based sauce. One tip - this is definitely a date or couples spot. Small tables and cozy. So I would not recommend bringing kids, unless you go for an early dinner. By 7:30/8, this place is packed. And I can see why!
2019-09-28,5,I'm not a fan of Eggplant but we got one app for the table with eggplant and it came in tangy sauce which was savoury and delicious. Main course was good too and they have amazing collection of French wines
2019-09-19,5,I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SPOT!!! Probably one of my favorite spots in Hoboken. The service is really nice, and the entrees never fail to disappoint. I took my parents here and they loved it too. The decor and ambiance in the restaurant are great too. The kefta tagine and the zaalouk are so good. The branzini fish is really good too.
2019-08-15,5,I've been to Barbès several times, and I always walk out feeling great and lucky to have such a great and unique restaurant in the neighborhood. The food is amazing - the moules marinieres and pastilles for dessert as some of my favorites, but I've had a few other appetizers and entrees on the menu as well and everything is very good - the atmosphere is great, and the service is friendly and on point. Will definitely keep coming back!
2019-07-28,1,We just ordered off of seamless. The tagine was watery and tasteless. This is by far the worst meal I've had in a very long time. Everything on the menu is over priced for the quality and portion size.
2019-07-20,4,French Moroccan food and ambiance, with a little Manhattan attitude to keep you on your toes. TLDR: Cocktails better than the food but worth a visit during restaurant week, and not a bad place for a date. Omar, the owner (?), is an amiable, fun character. If you have a problem, the AC unit dripped on us once, and he moved us to another table promptly, and apologized. The ambiance is laid-back, and service is similar without being too slow. Food was a little overcooked, but flavorful, and definitely worth trying a couple of times to find a dish you really enjoy. That's a bit of a cope out on my part, as I mistakenly ordered something relatively simple because I wanted to see if I could replicate it at home, and it was entirely different from what I imagined, and quite dry. Wife loved whatever it was she had, and I'm embarrassed to say I wasn't taking proper notice to the name, but it contained chicken, couscous and came with a side soup/sauce. Possibly the Couscous Marocain Traditionnel?The highlight are the cocktails. Monmarte is a watermelon and cucumber tonic that delivers a good kick.  Overall we'll visit again, probably try different dishes and a few more of the cocktails.
2019-07-13,5,NY was my destination tonight...expecting a nice dinner.. then black out July 13 2019.  we went right to new jersey...  now where to eat ?   We found BARBES right outside of the Lincoln tunnel. What a gem of a place... the food, the service, the decor... love that place...
2019-07-06,1,I waited a while to post this because what happened still makes me feel very uncomfortable.We went to Barbes for dinner a few weeks ago, I had a reservation.  We saw one open table available outside, so I asked if we could sit there but the manager (I believe his name is Amir) said someone took it.  I was surprised because I didn't see anyone in front of us take the table, but apparently someone did.  We had a nice dinner, and at the end my friend asked the same guy if they could accommodate a party size for 15 for her birthday and he said yes.  She also asked if it would be an issue that we have 2 people that like to be particular with the menu.  He said, "oh they must be Jewish" and I looked at him and said, "I'm Jewish" and my friend said, " So am I" and he said "Well that explains why you were upset that you didn't get a table outside."  I said, "No, I just genuinely didn't see people ahead of us."  We got the check and as we were leaving he offered us dessert on the house but we said no and we walked out.It's 2019 and I can't believe these comments were made in a diverse community of Hoboken.  I advise anyone who reads this to think twice about who and what you support.  I will never go back and am telling all of my friends about that night.
2019-07-06,5,Excellent restaurant based on food and service. Hoboken needed something different besides a bar food atmosphere and this is it. Decor is beautiful and food is delicious with very special dishes. Thank you for coming to Hoboken Uptown Omar!!
2019-06-21,1,While the food and service was great the (presumable) manager of the restaurant made a comment that offended my party. The fact that any comment was made about any culture was offensive to me, especially as I was a paying customer. I love the food and the atmosphere at this restaurant however I will never again attend
2019-06-18,3,I was so excited to see this restaurant open up but left twice disappointed. The service here is very very very slow, on all levels. They have live belly dancing on Saturday at least when I was there. It's insanely loud while the dancing is going on for about 10 minutes? Maybe 15? But the dancer is interactive and does a good job.The food is good, not anything fantastic but solid. I've tried the chicken kabobs, the mussels in red sauce, and the steak au Poivre. My chicken and steak were both over cooked, but flavorful.The highlight here are the cocktails, they have amazing cocktails. It's just really hard to get a server over to bring you one! Once you do order... it's about a7-10 minute wait for it to come. I think a second bartender would help alleviate this issue, and more wait staff or better training.
2019-06-17,4,So - let's start with the good.Nice intimate setting. Good vibe.Ordered appetizers : mussels in garlic sauce. Pretty good. But it's the best Morocco food on this side of the river. If the place were in ny, it would have to up its game as the bar is pretty high.Now let's talk about the best. The hospitality- warm , quick , attentive -  just perfect.It is a good date night spot. If you are a foodie, please walk in with tempered expectations.
2019-06-16,3,Very loud place, had a hard time hearing tablemates. We visited on a June evening and it was very hot inside, despite ceiling fans and the front door open. Loud music and a belly dancer up next. Yikes. Trying. Too. Hard.Food was ok, one guest really enjoyed their couscous royale. Others were disappointed. Decor was cute.
2019-05-26,5,Love the atmosphere! Both indoor and outdoor seating , Delicious food ! The perfect hidden  date night spot !
2019-05-16,5,Hoboken needed this restaurant. New Jersey needed this restaurant. I love Italian food but like yo can we get some variety? So thank you guys. You do that and do it really well. The staff is stellar! Super friendly and attentive. Warm decor, great location. Explorative wine selection. Tried my first Moroccan wine here. My go to is the Mediterranean salad. I can't wait to continue coming back to explore the entire menu. Exciting and completely welcomed addition to the city.
2019-04-05,5,A Moroccan restaurant that is at par with any in NYC. The ambiance is trendy but laid back. The servers are friendly and prompt. Excellent food over multiple visits!
2019-03-24,5,All I can say is THANK YOU! In a little city full of pubs with 742992 TV screens, Barbès can be your saving grace. My husband and I went last night - food, ambiance, wine were all top notch. On our table for the night: bottle of Brunello, hummus, Moroccan pastry (YUM!), Kefta Tagine, Couscous Royale, and the traditional Moroccan dessert that was on the house. If you crave restaurant experiences that transport you into a cultural experience outside of the US, this is your spot. We will be back.
2019-03-16,4,Very creative and interesting addition to the Hoboken restaurant scene.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  Nice cocktail list, looking forward to trying more of them.  Some nice food options for our 8yo, but still felt like a nice dinner out.
2019-03-13,5,I've left a review before but it's worth leaving another from a different perspective. If you're a restaurant owner​ (or thinking about becoming one), visit this place, with a pen & paper and take notes. The service is that good. The front of house is run the way every restaurant should be and that only works if the back of house is run well too. Pay attention to the details, the way the staff does. Try to replicate it in your own restaurant. It won't be easy but it will be worth it. The food is great, which certainly helps, the decor is really nice and it's very clean and orderly but the service is what brings it all together and elevates this place to another level. They set a standard here that should be the norm but almost never is. I hear people say that it's a bit pricey. I would agree and disagree. It's well worth it and I don't mind for that reason. This is what it costs to operate on this level. Others are simply cutting corners which leads to their decline. Barbes is a welcome addition to a largely lackluster Hoboken dining community. Thanks for doing it right.
2019-03-05,5,Service was fantastic. Staff is very attentive. Food was delicious. To top it off the belly dancer was so much fun! Can't wait to go back!
2019-03-02,5,Like a trip to Morocco! The lamb and fish tagine were great, as were the mussels. Love the music and the celebratory vibe. Staff is friendly and helpful. Great service.
2019-03-01,5,I have had dinner many times at Barbes and it has always been wonderful.  Last night I hosted a birthday dinner there for my friend and the food, the attentiveness, the little touches, but mostly the professional, genuine and FUN staff made the night incredible!  Omar and his team went out of their way to make it a night none of us will ever forget.  It truly was a celebration with family!  I can't wait to have dinner there again and host my next party.  Truly spectacular!
2019-02-24,4,Wonderful food, even better staff/service.We went on a Tuesday night (accidentally) for a birthday celebration and were pleasantly delighted to see live music (Tom Golden). We sat down and minutes later, the host (Roger) came to shake our hands and introduce himself to us. We had a wonderful meal (Harira, Mediterranean Salad, two kinds of tagines (lamb and veg) and a side of broccoli rabe) and and even better time listening to fantastic serenades both by Tom and other guest singers. I've had much better Moroccan food in past, truth be told, but Barbes' hospitality was by far the warmest and most entertaining, which puts it way up top. Give 'em a try, you won't be disappointed.
2019-02-21,5,Probably the best service in Hoboken.  Great ambience and the food is incredible.  Our regular favorites are any of the tagine dishes, the pastilla and cannot get enough of the briouats!!  And possibly the best cocktails in town.
2019-02-20,5,Great food, drinks & atmosphere! Went for dinner on a Friday night with some friends, it was packed--be sure to make a reservation. A belly dancer performed for a little while, guests joined in, it was fun! One of my new favorite spots in Hoboken.
2019-02-17,3,I was a little surprised that the bartender at this French Moroccan restaurant didn't know what a Mauresque was. The Kefta meatballs came with their tomato sauce but without anything else. A tad disappointing. The Couscous royal was good, they had real harissa upon request. The merguez were definitely on the bland side and should have been spicier. The chocolate mousse while having a nice firm texture tasted more like Hershey chocolate than anything else. Based on what we had I'd say that this restaurant is more a mid tier French bistro rather than a Moroccan restaurant.
2019-02-11,2,I was surprised by my experience here after reading so many great reviews. While the atmosphere is beautiful and the staff is very nice, I just didn't enjoy the food. The best thing was the fresh pita. That was delicious. But I won't be returning unfortunately. Maybe just not my cup of tea.
2019-01-28,5,I was fortunate last evening to have dinner with my spouse and another couple at this establishment. What a delightful spot with food prepared with Moroccan spices. We had the hummus, mussels in garlic and garlic shrimp for appetizers. The warm pita served to us was perfect for dipping. The entrees were all delicious. It was my husband's birthday and they brought out their signature dessert with a candle. I would definitely come back and hope this review encourages people to try it. Lastly, the staff was professional and completes my 5 star review.
2019-01-26,5,This place was a great new addition to Hoboken. Different from the typical American posh place. The food is flavorful and the service was great.
2019-01-25,5,A phenomenal dining experience. Every staff member at Barbes was extremely friendly, attentive and accommodating. We had the Mediterranean salad appetizer, the Bronzino, and both types of muscles, all of which were extremely high quality and well flavored. To drink I had an amazing spicy vodka cocktail! While we were there a couple got engaged and the restaurant celebrated with music and sparklers! We can here unexpectedly and now I cannot wait to return and share this restaurant with friends. Although there are many great Hoboken dining establishment, this out stand out as one of the best!
2019-01-21,5,Top notch! Quality food, great attention to detail, fantastic service and a nice vibe. Definitely a great dining experience in Uptown Hoboken
2019-01-20,5,Been there twice, each time exceptional food and service. The dessert stands out- fluffy dough with a whipped cream. Highly recommend.
2019-01-18,2,They get 2 stars for ambience and service. But the food was absolutely without flavor. The hummus was pretty tasteless and for a mediterranean restaurant, that is your first impression, nail down the hummus. The tagine lacked salt. All in all, a very average spot. I was hoping to really like this spot, but it was not to be.
2019-01-16,5,Wonderful restaurant with a cozy atmosphere and a great singer by the name of Tom Golden. Very relaxing music. Just a great experience!
2019-01-13,4,I loved Barbes!Having said that, let's get the bad stuff out of the way that's keeping me from giving a 5 star rating: my boyfriend made a reservation for 8:30 but we came early anticipating there may be room at the bar to grab a drink and socialize. The place was PACKED with upwardly mobile Hoboken residents, the typical uptown crowd. When we went to the host, he told us we weren't on the list despite showing him confirmation emails from Yelp. This happened with another couple as well. He approached the confirmation email with a little attitude, and I didn't really appreciate that. Once I brought that to attention, we were seated fairly quickly. We were given another waiter, and in turn the service was MUCH better and friendlier. Now let's get to the food. Barbes is French-Moroccan, so you can get an amalgam of different dishes, from tajine to steak au poivre. If you're not the most adventurous eater, this place may not be for you. My boyfriend and I ordered the zaalouk (a chilled roasted eggplant spread with tomato, garlic, arugula, and balsamic vinaigrette), which we both LOVED. The acidity of the vegetables blended together well and was perfect with the soft pita bread. For the entrees, my boyfriend ordered the lamb couscous, while I ordered the kefta tajine. His portion was large and filled with veggies (not a bad thing) and came with a side of what I thought was a consommé, while mine came with a side of couscous. My boyfriend liked his couscous--especially the lamb, which was tender and succulent--but also thought that it would be amazing if it incorporated more juices from the meat. I loved my meatballs, which had the right blend of savory, spice, and sweetness and it paired well with the cinnamon undertones of the couscous.Overall, a wonderful meal despite a rocky start, and a perfect date night.
2019-01-12,3,Either we tried the wrong food or the food was actually not upto our taste. We made reservations ages ago, but we were shown to our couple table which took a lot of squeezing into. After we sat, another couple sat on the table beside us and that pretty much locked me and the person, sitting on the couch from the other table, in. Like we couldn't move until we finish our meals and adjust the tables again. Service was also terrible. Our waiter took forever to bring the menu, take orders and bring food and wine. Meanwhile I heard two waitresses talking badly about our waiter loudly. And a third one came in and agreed with them.For the price paid, the not-so-tasty food, and bad service, it was not a pleasant experience overall and I will not return.
2019-01-04,2,First of all, I think all restaurants deserve at least a couple of opportunities.I have only been there once and the experience was horrible, sadly. The place was almost empty and we just ordered something from the brunch menu. The food arrived 20 minutes later and was very bad. You could say they did not put a lot of effort into the cooking, which it's concerning taking into account that there were only two tables.Overall, very bad experience.
2019-01-03,4,Great place for a date night or dinner with friends. The staff is super friendly, they treat you like family. Food and drink are both great and priced perfectly.It's a wonderful addition to Uptown Hoboken!  PS- Get the chicken pastilla.
2019-01-03,5,I ate here a few months ago with some friends and was given such great attention. Everyone treated us like we were very important guests which is a nice contrast from what you usually expect from restaurants around here. This place has an artsy, retro interior and is named after a neighborhood in Paris. I wasn't that familiar with the menu items, so one of the owners even helped me pick out a dish. If that wasn't enough, the food and drinks were off the chain. We had tons of cous-cous, tagine, and some mojitos. The food presentation was also super nice; they bring everything out in authentic, cone-shaped ceramic pots. We will definitely be back.
2018-12-24,5,I recently moved to the area and decided to give Barbès a try on a Friday night. We arrived around 8pm and decided to sit at the bar. The restaurant itself had a great crowd! Most tables and bar seats were full - always a food sign! The restaurant had great energy. It was both romantic and lively.I stuck with seltzer but my fiancé had an old fashion and a glass of wine. The old fashion was, according to him, really good. They had a nice variety of price points for wine as well. For food we had a shrimp appetizer and the mussels. Both were excellent. The shrimp were prepared very simply - garlic, olive oil, crushed red pepper- but so delicious. The mussels had great flavor as well. We opted for the ones with Moroccan spices. So delicious. The best part of each dish was dipping the bread in the remaining sauce/broth...so so good.Aside from the food, one of the best parts of Barbès was the service. The bartender was super attentive from the moment we sat down. He was friendly, offered suggestions, and made sure we wanted for nothing without being over bearing. Our glasses were never full and he even made sure we always had bread (to do the aforementioned dipping!) Everyone else who we interacted with was equally lovely. Overall, one of the better service experiences that I've had in a while!I'll definitely be returning to Barbès soon!
2018-12-14,5,Good food, great ambiance. I had the lamb meatballs, great taste. The waiters were very attentive, everyone was polite they made you feel that you were in a cozy place.
2018-12-14,5,My friend Sindy and I decided to try this place after hearing so many wonderful things. The outside facade was very festive and inside, you are transported into a cozy French Mediterranean oasis. It's perfect for girls night out (which we did), romantic date spot and also family friendly dining (very important for Hoboken and as a mom of a toddler, I lliked the ambience of the Barbes). We had the Kale Salad, Mussels, Fish Tangine, Lamb Tangine & Profiteroles. Everything was delicious, such authentic clean flavors and very fresh. We highly enjoyed our dinner and the owner Omar personally asked how our meal went, and was just so personable! I give it five stars and can't wait to go back again with my husband & family! So impressed
2018-12-08,5,I finally got around to checking out this restaurant on 14th and Park and boy am I glad I did. Based on the reviews and menu alone, I was excited for my experience--but no amount of wonderful reviews could do this place justice.Starting the second you step into Barbès, the staff treats you like you're part of their giant family. My boyfriend and I arrived at around 6pm on a Saturday night, and we were seated immediately at a lovely table by the kitchen. Our server was kind enough to take our coats, and immediately we were given menus and water.Seeing as I've looked at this restaurant's menu at least a dozen times, I already knew what I wanted before I even sat down, but I took a menu anyway just to confirm my decision. In the end, I went with the tagine du poisson (the fish tagine), and my boyfriend and I split the zaalouk appetizer.We only had to wait a few minutes for our appetizer to come out, and it was incredible. The zaalouk is a roasted eggplant spread of sorts with olives, tomato, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar and it's the perfect portion for a light appetizer. The eggplant is seasoned well, quite unlike any other eggplant dish I've ever had.As for my tagine, I only have incredible things to say. The fish was flaky and cooked perfectly, and the tomato broth/sauce it was in was full of flavor thanks to the plethora of spices and vegetables. The side of couscous nicely soaked up the saucy broth--and though I was unable to finish the large portion, I desperately wanted to eat every last bite.Though the food at Barbès is incredible, what makes the experience truly one-of-a-kind is the service. All of the servers and employees are friendly and truly care about your experience, and they won't hesitate to check up on you and make sure that you're enjoying your experience. At the end of the meal, we were even pleasantly surprised by our server when he brought over a complimentary pot of classic Moroccan tea.I can't recommend Barbès enough. It's warm, it's welcoming, and best of all, the food is mouthwatering good.
2018-12-06,3,Good briouts, nice wine list, and very good lamb and fish. Veggies accompanying the lamb and fish were passable and uninspiring. Mussels tasted weird.  The traditional Moroccan dessert, much like baklava was OK, not outstanding. I would go with profiteroles the next time. Seating was not very comfortable, as the space is small, many tables are crammed together and the noise level is like being in the subway. Service was friendly and fairly attentive.
2018-11-08,4,Nice chill spot, vibe and food is on point. Will be back soon.
2018-11-07,5,Barbes is an incredible addition to town. I went out to eat here a few days before vacationing in Morocco (Marrakesh and Essaouira) and after becoming completely enamoured by and more knowledgeable about delicious Moroccan food and spices, I returned here after our Morocco trip for a family birthday dinner party. It was wonderful.  All the entrees (I think by now I've tried most of them) are incredible. All the tagines (esp the lamb and prune and fish tagine) are wonderful and definitely get the couscous royale. The grilled bread and olive oil are exquisite. The bread was pita and different from the ones we ate in Morocco (where breads are a staple and delicious) but was equally exquisite. The ambiance is lovely. The service is incredibly hospitable. It is very family friendly. I look forward to many more meals here!! Thank you!!
2018-10-26,2,The place is mediocre at best. Ordered lamb tangine and veggie tangine from Moroccan specialties. Both were adequate but bland. Expected much more for the money.
2018-10-18,4,Went for DinnerFood - 5/5. Pita bread was warm with good grill marks on them. Mussels were delicious and clean with a rich, aromatic sauce. Kefta tagine was very tender and the tomato sauce had a great balance between savory and tart.Service - 4/5. Food came out and plates were cleared in a timely fashion which helped a lot since the table have limited space.Value - 2/5. The portions are on the smaller side and the fact that the entree comes with no sides feels like a deliberate upselling technique. The kefta sits at $24 yet the only accompaniments you get with your meatballs are a sprinkle of green peas. The fact that I have to dish out another $6+ for a side with entrees in the mid 20s price range is ridiculous especially when some entrees do come with sides such as couscous.Parking - Street (Free)
2018-10-12,2,The food was fine here but the overall experience was terrible. They say us an hour after our reservation and when we kept checking in they just gave us attitude. What would I wait an hour at a restaurant when I could have been home? Never eating here again. The food could have made up for it but it was just fine.
2018-10-10,3,Was quite disappointed by my meal at Barbès. I was excited that they had harira - a favorite Moroccan soup - on the menu, but found it to be more of a lentil soup substituting chickpeas- neither puréed nor spiced. The chicken tagine was also a letdown- almost a brown gravy with and not enough broth and under seasoned. And there was an extra charge for couscous - something I've never experienced before. My fellow diner's lamb meatballs were better - almost tasted like merguez -  but not pleasing to the eye as five or six meatballs alone on a plate. On a positive note, all of the servers and staff were lovely and very accommodating. Too bad the food wasn't worth coming back for...
2018-09-29,4,Friendly host and very good service. The mussels that we ordered were simply amazing. I wanted to try Tagine for a long time, so we ordered the fish Tagine. Not sure how an authentic Tagine tastes, but this was a little on the tangy-sweet taste. I found it alright. Overall, it was a good experience.
2018-09-22,5,Authentic food but too much selling. We had a party of 8 and the waitress kept on asking. I did like the Moroccan style food!
2018-09-19,5,Delicious and authentic food presented in a fun and serene locale, with attentive service.  Hoboken, please check this place out.  We need restaurants like this to thrive.  I went with a group of 6 for my wife's birthday.  We had several appetizers to start, all different and full of flavor.  I had the seafood tagine for an entree which couldn't have been better.  Ditch your old Hoboken haunts (or mix it up a little) and have a visit.
2018-09-13,5,Delicious mussels and cocktails. Also fun fact, if you go on your birthday, they also do a fun celebration thing
2018-09-13,4,Finally checked out this wonderful French-Moroccan restaurant. Right off the bat, I must say that Barbes has some of the most friendly staff (and owner) I've met and experienced at a restaurant. The ambiance was not quite what I expected: I guess I expected it to be a bit more upscale (based on the menu prices) and less noisy-but it was still nice, comfortable, and the décor is beautiful (that ceiling though!!!). The vibe was pretty standard for what I'm used to in Jersey City-foodie yuppies who just want some good food and good cocktails. The cocktails were delicious. The Marie-Antoinette is a perfect balance of fruity and herby with a tiny hint of the alcohol flavor. Their signature martini was a little strong on the alcohol for my liking, but to be expected from a martini. We started with the Montrachet (tomato and goat cheese) and the Zaalouk (eggplant). Both were plated beautifully and showcased all of the flavors on the plate. I could eat both of these appetizers any day of the week. We shared the vegetable tagine and couscous (extra $$ add-on), which was honestly the only reason I knocked my review down from 5 to 4 stars. It was a pretty skimpy, not substantial portion of vegetables in the tagine for $19. I've actually never seen a restaurant serve a vegetarian tagine, let alone a tagine at all without the couscous included. That part felt a little clippy. Since that portion wasn't filling for two, we ordered the sides of asparagus and the quinoa tabbouleh. The asparagus was cooked perfectly-not too soft, not too hard-and had JUST the right amount of garlic. The quinoa tabbouleh was also wonderfully seasoned and had the perfect amount of citrus to salt. Overall, I did really love the food, the experience, and the service-the owner was incredibly accommodating, patient, and friendly-however I won't be ordering the vegetable tagine again. Next time, the couscous au legumes!
2018-09-11,5,I may have left Hoboken before this place opened, but I made sure to come back to give it a try!We went on a very hot day, so I was lucky to get a seat outside. The place isn't BYOB, which is a rarity for Hoboken, but they made up for it with wonderful happy hour specials on Moroccan rose that we proceeded to drink for the rest of dinner (helped along by a dinner bell they kept ringing to let us know that happy hour was about to end). The restaurant inside is gorgeous, feeling like it was transported from Fez by way of Paris, with pictures of the Barbes neighborhood in Paris for good measure. The bar area was a nice place to hang out while I was waiting for the other people in our party. Anyway, on to the food. It was all amazing:- Briouats: Moroccan pastry filled with a chicken and almond mixture. Moroccans love cinnamon, sugar, etc on their meat more than most, but this was perfectly cooked and well-balanced. A great start to the meal!- Tagine d'Agneau: Gorgeous, perfectly-cooked lamb tagine with sesame seeds and prunes. Another great and perfectly Moroccan mixture.- Couscous Royale: Couscous with lamb, chicken, and merguez (Moroccan lamb sausage). It was great food, and incredibly filling - I only ate about half my couscous because I was just too stuffed.I'd go back here anytime. What a great place.
2018-09-07,5,Second time around. This time for dinner. So happy to have Barbes join Hoboken. What an amazing experience... the cuisine is just top notch and the people are incredible. The dessert - a Moroccan specialty tasted like Cinnamon Toast Crunch's milk. Our host Brian made such an impression. Skip over the usuals and head over to Barbes. You won't be disappointed.
2018-09-07,3,This place is hit or miss, I think it depends on the time and maybe who is in the kitchen.Our first encounter was a Thursday night, and the food was great!  Unfortunately our daughter was having a meltdown so we had to ask our food to be packed to go like a family of bandits...anyways, we got home and unpacked the food and everything was delicious!  Confit de Canard-Great, tender and flavorful.Tomate Montrachet-Unique!  Tomato and Goat Cheese goes surprisingly well together!  The tomato was nicely roasted so that the flavor was intensified but the texture was not too cooked.Hummus-Really good, good flavoring and great creamy texture.Since our first time was so good, and because we didn't get to sit down and enjoy the beautiful space, we decided to have my sister's birthday dinner here.  The birthday dinner was for a Sunday PM, and the food was bland and not so fresh tasting.  The service was amazing, but unfortunately the food was not...Moules Mariniere-half the mussels had no meat!Lamb Skewers-Good, but small portions for the price.Tagine De Poulet-BlahTagine De Poisson-Not fresh fish...it tasted on its way to being bad.Couscous Royale-Bland and no flavoring, despite the sauce on the side!Tagine D'Agneau-Good, but nothing great.
2018-09-06,5,Amazing food and great service. So happy this place opened in the neighbor. We got the hummus as an appetizer - it was amazing very smooth texture. Then for dinner I had the chicken tagine and a side of couscous it was unbelievable, my boyfriend kept trying to dip in to my dish and I wasn't having it.
2018-08-31,3,My first visit was a 4.  They lost our reservation but we ended up sitting at the bar and had a great night.  Bartender service awesome.  Within the first month of opening.  Would have been a 5 otherwise.Next 2 visits went down.  Both times I got the same French waiter with too many opinions which he should keep to himself.  Second time with a group of 5 girls.  We ordered our appetizers and he then told us instead what we "should" order.  I politely told him we were sticking with our order.  He had a few more comments but I was able to politely shoot him down.  The third time came with my husband and another couple.  He belittled my husband for ordering a diet coke and was trying to push a rose wine on him knowing he said he was not drinking alcohol.  He claimed only a little alcohol.  Completely inappropriate.  This time he didn't even let us order appetizers but instead when I said we were ordering appetizers he told us what we need to get.  I tried to humor him and took some of his advice and then altered our order.  I ordered a rose and asked for a cup of ice.  After 20 minutes and no ice, I asked for the cup of ice.  He told me if putting in my wine he was not delivering.  I told him straight up for my wine and had to go to bartender to get.No interest in coming back for a while.  Food is good but very pricey.  And having service that makes you uncomfortable is no good.
2018-08-19,4,Food was very good. Mussels were my favorite.  Only downfall was the temperature in this restaurant. Way too warm for a hot summer day-crank the AC !
2018-08-18,5,Great food, great drinks and great service. Such a good addition to Hoboken. While there are a ton of restaurants within the square mile, Hoboken lacks restaurants with quality food AND atmosphere - you usually have to choose one or the other. Barbès was a fun dining experience and the restaurant has a lot of good energy.
2018-08-14,5,Stumbled upon this gem of a restaurant. A little on the pricier side but the food and staff make it well worth the price. The staff are so attentive and friendly, one of the best services in Hoboken!Food is such a good fusion of French and Moroccan that the menu was hard to choose from. The brick stuffed with chicken was phenomenal. If you have a sweet tooth, this entree is the way to go.
2018-08-13,2,Very expensive for what you get here. The only positive thing - nice ambience, good crowd, I would just stop in for drinks and some appetizers. Entrees are way overpriced and just not tasty. Very plain couscous. Starting to think the 5 star ratings are rigged
2018-08-12,2,Came here for dinner with friends after wanting to come for quite some time. I should have taken the blank stares I received at the hostess stand when I walked in as a sign. I checked in for my reservation, got a drink while waiting for friends at the bar which seemed to be complete chaos. One bartender on a busy Saturday night. When we were ready to sit, I returned to the hostess stand and was met with more blank stares about my party/reservation until the manager came over and pointed us to our table.The four of us were seated at a pretty small round table. While looking over the menu, we placed a drink order only to have someone else come by to take drink orders two minutes later. We told them we had ordered from someone else so they went to check on them only to then have them served by someone completely different. We then ordered a bottle of wine, had it presented to us only for the server to realize there were no wine glasses on the table. Rather than get the glasses herself, the sever asked several people to get get the glasses while she stood there awkwardly with the bottle of wineOur three appetizers - hummus, shrimp and mussels - arrived however there was BARELY any room for the plates on the table and nothing was being cleared. I started using a nearby table as a place to put things that should have been taken away. The shrimp was over cooked and chewy and the hummus was served without pita or bread or anything. I had to ask three times for a side of pita or bread or something to be brought over. And in the end, the hummus had no taste.Our meals came - two of us ordered two different kind of tagines and the sever had no idea what was in each tagine so I was served the wrong one and we had to do a quick plate switch.Another member of our party was drinking Chardonnay ordered a second glass once our meals were served. When she received it, she asked the server if she was sure it was chardonnay because it tasted different. One of our 8 different servers proceeded to go get the bottle of wine and show it to her to prove it was chardonnay, which was so rude and unprofessional.Our meals were fine, the lamb tangine had next-to-no-taste. My fish tagine was good until I had an onion from the mixture with one of the foulest tastes and smells ever. Sort of tasted like it had marinated in soda and was fizzy.Overall, the vibe of this restaurant felt very chaotic - lots of people moving around but not doing anything. I sincerely still have no idea who our server was. I don't know that I'll be back.
2018-08-10,2,I wanted to love this place but it was not good at all. The service was lovely but the duck was very over cooked and the seafood special we got lacked flavor in a major way. I'm not sure I'd give it another shot since it was so pricey but it is a lovely atmosphere.
2018-08-09,2,Surprised how many five star reviews this place has.  The only standout thing about our Barbes experience were the drinks.  Not cheap but worth the $10-12 each.  My husband and I came in for dinner around 7:30; place was busy but not full.  The lack of any noise dampening surfaces was grating, every sound is amplified by the industrial interior.   Then around 8:30 the the super loud fast-paced music was added to the already loud ambiance -- presumably to discourage slow eaters/conversationalists.  Not fun.On to the food.  Considering it's a Moroccon restaurant serving what are normally spicy dishes, our food was extremely bland.  Chicken tagine was almost tasteless, chicken brochette had some spices on it, but was overcooked and unappetizing.  The only tasty thing was the accompanying french fries.  Couscous, which our waitress practically forced us to order as a side, was also tasteless.  Very disappointing experience overall.  Also not cheap.
2018-08-08,5,Great experience at Barbes! The service was very attentive, they were super friendly. The appetizers and drinks unique and yummy! As far as drinks you can get an amazing cocktail here (ie: martini) and I haven't found that at many places in Hoboken. Dinner-delish. My friend and I were both pleased with our entrees. I had the shrimp dish which was flavorful.
2018-08-08,5,I stopped by with my husband and a friend and we had such an amazing experience. From the impeccable service to the delicious food, everything was wonderful. We ordered the chicken brochette, kefta tagine And chicken tagine. We all thought the kefta tagine was the best but everything tasted great. For dessert we ordered this puff pastry with cream and the chocolate mousse. And we washed it all down with the mint tea (must have!) We had a wonderful time. Our food arrived in a timely manner, glasses of water were always full, and the ambience was great for a relaxed dinner. I highly recommend this place. I will be back for sure.
2018-08-05,5,I hate it. It's that good. The kind of good where you just don't want it to become popular, because you won't want to be blocked from a table. The service is just as good as the food. I took two out-of-state friends. We were joyfully greated and escorted to our seats. My friends assumed I  knew the owners,, no not at all, I explained, they are just that nice to everyone.  I'm not kwledgeable to speak to the authenticity of French Moroccan food, all I can say is that I've tasted several dishes from hummus to pastilla and loved every bite.
2018-08-03,3,The food here is aggressively mediocre. I have come twice and the same issues persist each occasion: the vegetables are flaccid, overcooked, and oily, and the main courses are not cooked properly and somehow flavorless despite there being like 10 ingredients in everything. The hummus has the consistency of Cool Whip. The bread is completely unremarkable. I am genuinely curious: why is the flatbread so unpleasantly chewy? The drinks are fine. The service is polite and attentive. The space looks pretty cool but the structure is such that it gets incredibly loud. It is absurdly overpriced. I was very excited for this place to open, as Hoboken really needs more culinary diversity and high quality restaurants, but Barbes is underwhelming.
2018-08-02,5,We had such an amazing time at Barbès for restaurant week and to celebrate our friends engagement. We actually live above the restaurant but we're always skeptical given reviews we have seen on yelp but The staff and the food exceeded our expectations!!! Brittani and Amin were so welcoming and always checked in to make sure we were doing well and that our food was okay. In addition to this the food was amazing!! All four of us got the mussels, salmon, and chocolate mousse and there were all to die for. I would definitely recommend checking out Barbès if you haven't already, it a great and welcoming environment with amazing food and drinks.
2018-08-01,5,What can I say that finally something outside the tried and tested in Hoboken. Barbès is fantastic new Moroccan and French restaurant that served up some amazing cocktails, delicious appetizers, generous entrees, and inventive deserts. But more than anything the service by the staff total class and friendly and gave the most wonderful suggestions for wine and food. The owner was excellent also as he told us the story behind the restaurant.  Bravo and good luck to Barbès.
2018-07-31,4,A welcome addition to Uptown, and Hoboken in general. Delicious food, first and foremost. I think they are still working out the kinks service wise, and yes, it's expensive. But I'd much rather pay for tasty food here at Barbes then eat mediocre offerings at other cheaper/average spots that dot Hoboken everywhere else. I think they'll find their service footing eventually.
2018-07-29,1,I live in key west...southernmost point of the states. Its laid back, chill and we except everyone...our slogan "one human family". Why not...its just easier that way. I come to the well renounced city of Hoboken to visit a friend. We make dinner ..call...at 5 pm for 730. When we call...the employee asks...do you want outside seating? Sure its summer in Hoboken and I'm from key west Yes!We arrive at 728 pm...we are told ...as we watch someone take the only 2 seats on patio...that they dont take reservations for outside . We explain that we made reservations and they offered outside. We werent aware they had outside..... We are told...well sorry we dont. After 5 minutes of arguing...I figure..mmmmwhats the point, I'm from key west. We would have simply accomadated people and made sure they had dinnerIf you have a problem with 2 guys visiting your restaraunt for dinner after we make reservations and then are appalled because 2 men want dinner...well.....good. I expected more of Hoboken and it's not the cities fault but maybe the residents should take a good look at this place and ask....why do we have something like that in our "town"To the restaraunt.....good luck. You're service is laughable ....is that how we want people to be treated?
2018-07-29,3,Decent food but highly disorganized management.  Twice I called, made reservations over the phone and twice I showed up and they messed up on the reservations.  Once they just lost them completely and other time they gave my table to a couple in front of us without reservations and then we were told we like have to wait - with no tables even close to turning.To the owners/ management- get on opentable and hire new management.
2018-07-27,5,This place is awesome! We celebrated my partner's birthday here and I have to say it was hands down the best restaurant birthday experience I've ever witnessed. The food is amazing, and he had the best time. Highly recommend!!!
2018-07-27,2,The food was good the staff were amazing.  However, I can't believe I was charged for refills on an unsweetened ice tea.   It cost me almost $15 for 4 ice teas.  The waitress never mentioned I would be charged for refills.  This is Hoboken not some high end  SOHO place.  I will not be coming back because of this.   I hate it when places rip you off for basically flavored water
2018-07-25,5,Barbes is my favorite. There's nothing like it in Hoboken. The vibe is city-esque; cute, fun, pretty and great food. The mussels and mezze were delish. The kale salad with dates is amazing. The drinks are the BEST! Their music is fab. It's fun, authentic French Moroccan and super cool. They give you an authentic Fez hat to put on and that just adds to the fun! Bobby is cutest.
2018-07-25,5,What a new and pleasant surprise in the neighborhood. The staff was lovely- very attentive and friendly. I got the chicken skewers with couscous. It was very good. Smaller portion but satisfying. My friends got the lamb skewers and lamb sausage. I tried both and enjoyed them but the lamb sausage was very spicy, so beware. I am excited to try more on the menu.
2018-07-25,1,Went here for restaurant week.   I ordered the muscles and lamb tangine and my wife ordered the kale salad and got the chicken skewers with french fries.    Before I go into that the place was extremely hot like 78 Degrees according to the thermostat we had to ask to turn it on in the middle of July.     They don't put any ice in the warm water they serve we had to ask for ice 3 or 4 times.    The restaurant was extremely noisy and crowded.     Now the food!  The mussels where completely lacking any sort of flavor or taste, the "sauce" was on the bottom and there barely any of it.   The Lamb was actually good, but the dish just had lamb, nothing else.   No rice, cous cous, or veggies, just 4 small pieces of lamb.   My wife's chicken looked like a meal a toddler would order, 5 or so really really tiny pieces of chicken that were undercooked, and the french fries where the frozen variety akin to McDonalds.     I can't say any good things about this place or give it anymore than 1 store.    I don't expect them to stay in business long.
2018-07-19,4,Came here for my birthday last night with a couple girlfriends and the owner and waitstaff made it a point to make sure I was having a good time...great ambience, food and service.  Has a very west village vibe.  Definitely much needed place in Hoboken.  Can't wait to come back!
2018-07-19,5,Please do not listen to the negative reviews! 5 of us went last night to celebrate my friends birthday and the staff could not be more attentive or kind. At some point in the night everyone on staff stopped by to make sure we were okay, both waitresses, the bartender and the owner. The food and drinks were amazing as well. For Apps we ordered the kale date salad, mussels with garlic and shrimp with garlic, all which were absolutely delish. We all ordered a different tangine dish to share, and everything was incredibly tasty. Thank goodness they opened this place up so I can stop having to go to Jersey City for something besides pizza and sushi!
2018-07-04,5,I love this restaurant! Hoboken has a lot of amazing food, and Barbès brings a new type of cuisine to the area. The ambience is super cool and the food is amazing. I particularly like their appetizer options and definitely suggest starting off with some mussels. Have already been here twice and it's slowly becoming me and my boyfriend's go-to spot.
2018-07-01,3,5 stars for the service.  The Cuban/PR waitress (can't remember her name)  was amazing.  She was awesome and kind and friendly and always asked if all is good.  Very professional and efficient.  5 /5 for decor and ambience. The music was very loud though and having a conversation was difficult.  I am very disappointed in the food.  The price is really high for such small portions.   $24 for a lamb Tagine and there is no complimentary or accompanied bowl of couscous. The lamb tagine was a very tiny amount and I had expected a lamb shanks as opposed to three cubes of lamb meat.  Most places usually have lamb shanks.  The gravy was so little that I ordered a bowl of couscous and I could have only eaten less than half of it.  The stew ran out lol.  The tagine is stew sorta so one cannot eat it all by itself. One must get couscous with it.  For $24, giving a small bowl of couscous won't kill ya.  One shouldn't have to buy a bowl of couscous to eat the tagine.  It should be an entire meal.  Do the right thing!! Give a free bowl of couscous.  I left unfulfilled and still hungry.
2018-07-01,5,Staff and Cuisine were great. Flavorful food and knowledgeable servers paired for a great evening. Will definitely be back!
2018-07-01,5,What a great addition to the neighborhood and the Hoboken restaurant scene. Nice atmosphere, exceptionally friendly owner and staff, food was great! We especially liked the Kefta Tagine, Zaalouk, and Briouats. All around a great experience that made for a lovely summer evening.
2018-06-30,4,Great addition to Hoboken.  Great atmosphere, welcoming, attentive and fun staff.  Kale salad w grilled shrimp is a favorite.  Outdoor seating a plus.
2018-06-30,5,Very good food and excellent service! We only ate the vegetarian options...which was plenty and enjoyed everything. Good drinks also.
2018-06-27,2,Not sure how this place has a 4.5 rating. It has got to be the honeymoon phase because my experience was not a 4.5 star experience. We sat outside and started with wine.  It took a while for the wine to come out but I will let them slide on that.  We ordered appetizers and entrees... however our entrees came out before our appetizers did. Not sure if the waitress forgot to put them in but not a great start. As for the entrees... the couscous royale had overcooked meat, no flavor on anything and not a pleasant dish. I was hoping the veggies would be better but they were way overcooked. The kefta tagine was pretty good but it was the only thing that was ok out of the whole meal. When we eventually got the appetizers they were underwhelming. The briouats were one of the most interesting things I have eaten (not in a good way). It was a chicken pastry with powdered sugar on it. Wild stuff. Not good. The lentil salad with avocado was a simple dish that was not bad. Overall, I would not come back here... not sure how this has a high rating.
2018-06-25,5,Amazing new addition to our hoboken neighborhood!!! Friendly and attentive staff, excellent wine and the food, oh the food... such a unique take on French/ Moroccan that will l leave your taste buds craving more! Will definitely be back!!
2018-06-24,4,Barbes is a fantastic addition to the dining scene and a rare find from all the pizza, pasta and sushi joints in the town.  When I first heard that a French-Moroccan restaurant opening, I thought...yaaas! My search for steak frites has come to an end!  So that's when I decided to come here to try it out.We came here for dinner with reservations and found the restaurant packed from table to bar on a weekend.  The atmosphere was fun, lively and the decor does make you feel like you've been transported to the town of Barbes.I ordered the steak au poivre (obvvy) and we also tried the chicken tagine (tagine de poulet).  The steak au poivre came with veggies and fries; the steak was flavorful and cooked to my liking...I really enjoyed the dish.  The chicken tagine was tasty, though I would say the portion sizes of the dish are small and it doesn't come with any rice or sides, so that's something to keep in mind. Service was warm and friendly but there were definitely aspects that could be improved.  They were understaffed and pretty busy that day so we waited awhile for our food and then waited some more just for the check.  With the restaurant having only been in operation for a few months, I believe this is something they will work out over time.Overall, a great place to hang out for drinks or grab French-Moroccan food!
2018-06-24,4,Wait staff is excellent and they're very personable here (that makes a big difference when you have a 16-month old). The food was very good, albeit a bit pricey, but the flavors burst with each bite. Also in a nice quiet area of town and close to where we live.
2018-06-24,5,this was our 2nd trip to Barbes and it exceeded our expectations based on the terrific first time!  Our reservation was for 8:30, we arrived early at 8:16 and were seated immediately, this was wonderful start.  The waitress was lovely, and it is nice to have the owner check on us throughout the evening.  MUST HAVES...the lentil salad and garlic shrimp as an appetizers and the Branzini for an entree.  We also had the lamb w prunes...equally amazing.  we had the special dessert which was delicious but I can't remember what it was called but it was layers of crunchy phyllo with a creme and orange water filling with fresh strawberries...light but full of flavor.  excellent meal and reasonably priced.
2018-06-20,5,So amazing! The service and food and outdoor ambience. We loved the flavors and spices we grew up with. It is neighborhood places like this that make you love where you live. I can't wait to hang out there more.
2018-06-17,5,Just had a Father's day brunch at this place. Had some savory/sweet Moroccan pastry with almond and chicken that was awesome. The pastry was flaky and cooked very well so this was crunchy. Also had a great chocolate mousse, just the right consistency and chocolate intensity and a Moroccan dessert as well. Regular coffee was  also great: not burnt and not watery. Overall a very good experience. Staff was very nice and attentive. Family friendly. I highly recommend!
2018-06-15,5,My boyfriend and I just got back from having a late dinner here and we are obsessed! Our waitress and the rest of the staff were so nice and welcoming. We ordered the tomate montrachet appetizer and it was delicious. As for our entrees we got the salmon and steak and they were both tasty. Even the fries were great! Definitely recommend checking this spot out, you won't be disappointed! Glad we found a new go-to spot that's different from all the restaurants in Hoboken.
2018-06-15,5,Great family or date night spot for the uptown crowd! Very friendly staff! We had our 10 month old daughter with us and they were very accommodating. The food was delicious! Loved the garlic shrimp appetizer for both presentation and taste. My steak was cooked perfectly and the portion was a decent size. We had chocolate mousse for dessert and it was large enough to share. Definitely somewhere I would bring family when visiting. We will definitely be back!
2018-06-12,4,Fun ambiance with a lot of young good looking people and friendly bartenders. They're only open for a few months so they have a bit of service related kinks to work out. That being said, the energy is sill worth it. Fun music and hustling staff that wants to please. Interesting menu, wouldn't say Michelin star quality but good food to pick at while drinking and dining with friends or on a date.
2018-05-30,4,The latest addition to Hoboken's dining scene boasts of French-Moroccan cuisine - a rarity to our palette this side of the Hudson and definitely a welcome addition to the ever expanding list of restaurants in this town. We stopped by for dinner a few weeks ago with a group of friends:Montrachet: a truly unusual dish, layers of tomato, goat cheese and pesto bursting with flavors, unlike everything else we tried which was more subtle compared to this one app. Moules Marocaine: You regular mussels really. Couldn't detect a Moroccan flavor and was expecting the broth to stand out in terms of flavor, but had the same garlicky taste we are used to in most restaurants and pubs in Hoboken. Bronzini Grillé: My favorite from everything I sampled... a generous portion of fresh fish with smokey charred flavors infused with lemon. The grilled vegetables were okay and the dish could do with a better and more innovative accompaniment.  Tagine De Poulet: Chicken tagine...so flavorless and on the drier side. A disappointment. Steak Au Poivre; I didn't try it, but my friend was happy with her dish, though she missed a side of carbs to go with it! To round it all of, we had the Moroccan pasty and the Chocolate mousse. Both excellent, but favored the pastry a tad more; steeped in rose water and pistachios. Expect to pay $200 per couple with drinks... Manhattan prices really and Manhattan portion sizes. Looking for a pleasant evening and something different in Hoboken? Barbes offers both. Wish the tables were not so closely set though. Takes away from the over all experience.
2018-05-27,5,We were very excited to see a Moroccan restaurant opening near us. The food was amazing, highly recommend the tagine options on the menu!  The staff was also very friendly and happy to answer any questions we had. The food is definitely worth the price; we can't wait to go back.
2018-05-26,5,Ate there last night for first time, nice space, staff incredibly friendly and attentive and the food was delicious. Five stars and will definitely be back.
2018-05-23,5,Exactly what Hoboken needsgreat food, friendly staff, kid friendly and run by people that understand that a restaurant should have a buzz, and ambiance, and not be a sports bar. This truly is what is needed in Hoboken, and very glad to have eaten here a few times already
2018-05-22,5,Everything was amazing. Cocktails were awesome, mussels were the best I've had, chicken and almond stuffed phyllo was incredible, opera music played when they unveiled my Couscous Royale, and the bathroom deadbolts have "vacant" indicators - a nice touch.
2018-05-18,1,The WORST service in Hoboken! Waitress came by twice the entire time and one of them she just spilt wine on our table. Food was decent at best. Definitely not worth a second visit.
2018-05-18,5,Amazing dinner consisting of a lamb dish, scallop special, shrimp and couscous, and mussels. Every dish was delish with lots of flavors, but nothing over powering or salty. Staff was friendly. Ambiance is attractive and hip. We are planning another dinner here again, soon.
2018-05-16,5,I used to go to Barbes in Manhattan when they were located on Madison Avenue. I was very happy to find them in Hoboken. Dinner on May 12 was fantastic. Kale salad with walnuts and dates and the entree Crevettez Pitou - shrimp over a savory couscous-was delicious. Followed by chocolate mousse for dessert.  My daughter had the brioats-chicken filled pastry for appetizers which she loved. And her gf ordered the Tomato Montrachet -also a winner. We all thoroughly enjoyed the meal and found the staff to be warm and welcoming. Definitely going back with more friends!
2018-05-14,5,Wow! What a great dining experience. We were looking for something different and Barbes hit it right on target. From the moment we walked in, we knew it was going to be a great night. Food = outstanding, Service=outstanding. Do yourself a favor and make a reservation. You won't be disappointed. We're looking forward to our next visit to Hoboken so we can dine here again.
2018-05-12,3,Food was pretty decent. The Lam sausage was great. Nice atmosphere and good drinks. Chicken was good but a bit dry. Good portion size but a bit pricey. Good drinks. Overall pretty good but might be hard for them to compete with other restaurants in the area. I think the taste of the food can be improved.
2018-05-11,1,A lot of buzz and nothing to show for it. Our reservation was overlooked, so not only did we have to wait an hour, but service at the table we eventually secured was iffy at best. Food was terrible - piles of unseasoned couscous with soggy veggies. I ordered dessert as a last gasp but it was cold puff pastry that they'd sliced a strawberry over. What a disappointment.
2018-05-11,5,I absolutely loved Barbes !! Such an amazing and unique addition to Hoboken. The service could not have been more attentive, and the owner Omar epitomizes one who truly loves what they do, and cares about every detail. The appetizers were perfect, shrimp in garlic sauce, hummus and eggplant were all exceptional. The lamb kefte (meatballs) were better than in Paris, and the mergez sausage was the best I've ever had. I can't wait to go back !! Thank You, Okie.
2018-05-10,5,Much needed addition to uptown Hoboken.  NYC quality aesthetic and quality of food.  The one thing I would like to see improvement on is their service.  We were seated outside and they definitely forgot about us for a while.  I think that they need to allocate a server to the outside only during the busy spring/summer season and this place will do just fine.  Great experience.
2018-05-09,4,This place is still finding its feet, but I recommend.  Broad based menu of straight French and Moroccan choices.  Flavors across board are very good and tasty.Some dishes are great and fulfilling.  Others are misses.We had the mussels with white wine, the lamb tangine, and the branzino.  We also had a glass of dessert wine and a glass of Bordeaux.The mussels, while flavorful, were a joke in size. Literally, the size of each mussel was a fingernail or even smaller. A waste of money and effort.The lamb was phenomenal. The best of the dishes we had. Flavors awesome and perfectly tender meat.  Wow, wow.  Portion huge, almost all meat.The branzino was a big portion and cooked perfectly. Could have had more flavor to it, and the vegetables on the side were very undercooked.On wines, both pours were teeny, even allowing for dessert wine being small pour to begin with. The Bordeaux was 12 dollars and was about half the voumme of other places.  As a wine, was basic table quality.Service was great and timely without being too in your face.   I recommend, and believe it will improve with time.
2018-05-08,5,Fantastic, flavorful, and filling Moroccan/French dishes with a good cocktail list and great staff made for a great meal at Barbès. Appetizers were all very tasty and the couscous royal was delicious. Look forward to coming back soon!
2018-05-03,5,Had a great meal here last night with my wife.  Happy to see something other than pizza and bars in Hoboken.  The portions were surprisingly generous.  We started with the Mediterranean Salad and then shared the duck and Pastilla entrees.  You HAVE to try the Pastilla.  I was happy that nothing was overly salted as well, as is too often the case.  Will be back for sure.
2018-05-02,5,I don't usually leave reviews, but was compelled after my delicious meal. Wonderful new addition to the neighborhood! The food was exquisite, the flavors were vibrant, friendly staff, and beautiful decor. My boyfriend who has been to Morocco, and is generally a tough critic, said it tastes like the real thing. Definitely check this place out.
2018-04-30,5,Finally, Hoboken has a delicious new restaurant uptown that ISN'T ITALIAN! Barbes is absolutely wonderful. The service is top notch. The food comes out quickly. And the dishes are all fresh, flavorful and authentic. The lamb meatballs are out of this world. The couscous royale is wonderful - lamb so tender you don't even need a knife. The chicken tagine is spectacular. AND GET THE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE FOR DESSERT! It's really all excellent.
2018-04-29,5,If I could give 6 stars, I would! We walked into the beautiful navy space and were greeted warmly by the staff who seated us immediately. We ordered the kale salad with dates, the humus, zaalouk (eggplant) and chackchouk (devine pepper tomato mash) and a Montrachet (giant tomato with fresh herb & goat cheese) for the table. They came with fresh pita and bread for dipping. For mains, we all split the tangine de poulet (chicken with lemon & olives), left (lamb meatballs in a deliciously spicy tomato-based sauce) and the couscous royale. The spices, flavor and plating exceeded our expectations. The food was fresh and prepared impeccably. We left nothing uneaten! For dessert, we had the velvety chocolate mousse and the house special of thin layers of  sweet filo-like crisps gently covered with a lightly sweetened honey cream. Kudos to Omar and the staff. We will DEFINITELY be back soon. It's about time a gem like this found its home in Hoboken. #fullbar #makereservations
2018-04-29,1,So disappointed. We had a reservation last night and were really looking forward to it- we are new parents and don't get to go out much so this was a big night for us.  We agreed weeks ago that next time we had the grandparents in town to babysit we would be trying Barbes.While walking to restaurant we realized we were running 5-10 mins late for our reservation, so we called to let them know and ask if that would be an issue.  The person who answered was so rude. He said "if you're late we will probably give away your table." It was pouring rain so my husband reiterated the question and said we were down the street and would definitely be there in 5-10 minutes was there any way to let us know if we would have a table? The guy responded with a very condescending  "we'll see," and hung up. We cancelled online.  If the restaurant decides to take the somewhat inhospitable position not to hold a table for someone who calls and says they are running 5-10 minutes late, that is their right as a business.   However, we were so taken aback by the rude and dismissive attitude that we cancelled and decided to write this review.There are so many great restaurants in Hoboken and JC who appreciate their customers - so we won't be trying this one.
2018-04-26,5,Loved!! Great food and service and went the extra mile to make my friend's birthday dinner fabulous! Highly recommend!
2018-04-26,3,It was just ok. Decor and ambiance was nice. Food was kinda bland, presentation was average and for the money that was disappointing. Restaurant was full of smells from the kitchen so they need to improve ventilation. People were super friendly and helpful. There's just not a compelling reason to return.
2018-04-23,5,The shuttered restaurant at the corner of 13th Street and Park Avenue had been left vacant for years, despite its seeming like such a quaint and ideal location.  But finally, someone made a move and opened Barbès, bringing a new, and more importantly, an unique restaurant to the northern section of Hoboken.  While the town has an overwhelming number of Italian, Asian, and American eateries, French-Moroccan cuisine was a brave new frontier for local diners.  I was excited to explore this journey from day 1 and hearing a positive review from one of my friends made it that much more timely.  I suggested the destination to friends for a ladies' night dinner, and they eagerly jumped at the chance to try something new, even though they had not heard of the opening previously.  We were thankful that we had a secured an 8:30 pm reservation, because there was a line out the door when we arrived.  In fact, they even had our table vacant and ready for us, while the remainder of the space was completely full, an accommodation that rarely happens in Manhattan.  The three of us each ordered a glass of wine, and it was the 2014 Heredad Ugarte Rioja Crianza from Spain for me.  For an affordable $12, I found the wine very complex, with ripe tannins and layers of smoke and pine.  Our drinks were paired with a basket of crusty slices of bread that I somehow managed to avoid, despite how tempting they appeared.  In fact, it would have gone splendidly with our Salade Méditerranéen, a spread trio of Hummus, Zaalouk, and Chackchouka. I had never heard of those final two dips, but was told that they were actually similar to a babaganoush and a muhammara - so marinated eggplant and red pepper spreads.  The purees were so flavorful and ripe that they appeared freshly made only moments before.  They were served over large, thick tomato slices and Kalamata olives.  In addition to this platter, we shared the Kale Date Salad, which was topped with shaved parmesan and a light lemon vinaigrette.  The nuts and dried fruit added character, and the portion was extremely generous.   Since I had had a large lunch that day, and because we had ordered appetizers, I thought it would be best to go for a smaller portioned main course.  The Chicken Breast Brochette included de-skewered chunks of tender chicken breast, which had been marinated in paprika and cumin.  There was a side of refreshing garlic yogurt sauce that managed to both balance and enhance the aromatic flavors of the marinade.  The poultry was served with my choice of quinoa tabouleh or french fries, for which I selected the Tabouleh.  The quinoa had been tossed with parsley, tomatoes, mint, and onion, all of which were extremely fresh.  From the friendly and customer-focused owner, Omar, to the diligent wait-staff and festive lengths they go to for birthday patrons (envision hats, sparklers, and music), the service at Barbès was top-notch.  Pairing that  dedication with the zesty food and sultry atmosphere, they possessed a clear recipe for success.  I welcome Barbès to the area with open arms!
2018-04-22,5,FINALLY! Hoboken gets a real restaurant with delicious, interesting food and a savvy staff, and a real bar. Finally Hoboken gets a stylish establishment that is not a pizza joint! Finally Hoboken gets a dining option that is not covered in televisions! We had the fish tagine, and a salmon skewer, and a chicken skewer; with wine and cocktail.  The staff were courteous and lovely and the food was outstanding! The only pity is that I didn't get to try MORE! I will be back asap. Bravo Barbes!Also worth noting, the skewer dishes are EXCELLENT options for my children, whom do not eat frozen chicken nuggets and butter pasta! Finally excellent, flavorful menu options for kids to enjoy. Best spot in town!
2018-04-22,3,Pretty good but pretty pricey.  The bread they gave us to start was a bit stale....we later got hot fresh bread which was much better.  My friends and I started with two hummus appetizers and the tomato one with the goat cheese.  They were good.... solid good. Then I got the grilled shrimp with the couscous as an entree and it was pretty good but nothing out of this world. Shrimp was nice and fresh. It was a busy Saturday night and the service was clearly slow/not really on their game. We probably could of left and they wouldn't of noticed lol. Nice decor and a fun night out but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.
2018-04-21,5,So excited to find a Mediterranean spot in jersey so don't need to trek to the city to indulge. The food was delish! Had their tomato salad which was delish and the chicken lemon tagine. I have been thinking about it all week!  We sat at the bar as the place was full but didn't feel like we missed out on anything. The bartenders were super attentive and nice. Definitely the top of my list.
2018-04-21,5,My wife and I walked past this place a few weeks ago and had to try it. Had a great date night here! The drinks were good but the food was incredible. We both had the couscous and it was amazing: flavorful, meat was tender and juicy, and very well-prepared.Still working out some kinks (which is completely expected from a new restaurant), but wouldn't hesitate to come back and bring guests.
2018-04-16,2,I was patiently waiting for this restaurant to get a yelp account so I could review (only to realize it's still not listed on the yelp ap?!...that's an eye roll for yelp)My friends and I had the weirdest experience at this restaurant on its 3rd night in town. We were excited to try out the place and were delighted when we arrived and there was an open table. We started reading the menu and were enticed by the cocktail menu only to be told that the bar "wasn't fully stocked yet" and they couldn't make some of the cocktails, like their play on the french 75 (what's that 3 ingredients). HMMM strange but OK they just opened.... so we ordered some appetizers and patiently waited... and waited... and waited... our appetizers came out before our cocktails and before any Moroccan bread. We were never asked what we wanted to order for our entrees so we decided to get our check after we finished our cocktails, which finally came out after we were basically finishing our appetizers. I am assuming the tall man is the owner seemed to brush off our inquiry about our cocktails as if we were rude for waiting at least 15-20 minutes for them (we did start timing). He also asked if he could rush anything else when we asked for the check, which was a bit pompous if you ask me. The food was good but the overall experience was frustrating and rather rude. Not sure if we will give this place a second chance. Kudus to the bus boy who did a great job refreshing our water glasses as we waited for our cocktails and food. Proceed with caution...maybe forgo the cocktails and go straight to the wine
2018-04-14,5,What a fantastic new addition to Hoboken!  Let's start with the food... we had hummus, tomato with goat cheese, lentil salad as appetizers... followed by chicken tangine, lamb tangine, Kefta and fish... rounded tha off with the chocolate mouse and traditional dessert.  All 6 of us agreed that the food was excellent... right amount of spices and uniquely flavorful. We all left there stuffed!!!!The staff was friendly, attentive and FUN!  Brian the host greeted us with a huge smile, Omar the owner stopped by multiple times to check on us, the server (unfortunately cannot remember her name) knew when to come by and when to just let us relax and enjoy our dinner. The wait staff was quick with water, pita, clean up, etc. all were very well organized and trained to provide an enjoyable experience.
2018-04-13,5,The first restaurant with a cool Manhattan sensibility to hit Hoboken. Very good food made with finesse. Started off with the hummus. They add acid with a balsamic drizzle which is interesting and unexpected. Then we had the chicken brochette and the lamb tagine. Both excellent -- the lamb especially. Very subtle, beautifully seasoned. The chicken was served with excellent tabbouleh and we also ordered a side of couscous which was very nice. The service was friendly, relaxed and professional. We sat next to the kitchen and got a peek inside. I saw only one grill cook and a sous chef but, even with a packed restaurant, they were totally in control with a spotless kitchen. Very impressive. Be aware: the portions are moderate (quality over quantity is a nice change in Hoboken) and the flavors are restrained and subtle.Excellent addition to Hoboken.
2018-04-10,5,I came here for dinner on a Saturday night for an impromptu dinner date- we were able to be seated at the bar as we didn't have a reservation. Everything we ordered was delicious! We split the following- Kale Date Salad, Moules Marinière, Brochette De Merquez, and the Pastilla. This is a much different cuisine than the neighborhood previously offered and is a very welcome addition. Looking forward to going back!
2018-04-09,5,My husband and I have been to Barbes twice in the 3 weeks that it has been open.  It is that awesome!!  We went in on a whim a couple weeks back and they were booked, so we took a seat at the bar.  I quickly found out that the best seat in the house is at the beautiful bar with Amin, their warm and hilarious bartender.  We started off with cocktails.   They were creative and fun.  We then ordered from Amin's suggestions and it was all amazing.  We really liked the Pastilla.  Wow.   We talked to other people at the bar, laughed with Amin.  We ended up having such a fun night, just on a whim!  We really need more places like this in Hoboken.  Food that is exciting and made with care.  Smaller, more intimate places that make a night out feel special.  We do not need more sports bars and TVs in our restaurants.   We need places that make our community interesting and vibrant and Barbes ticks all those boxes.  Keep it up guys!  We hope to become your "regulars".
2018-04-08,4,My husband and I dined at Barbes last night and the food was excellent!  We had the eggplant salad and lentil salad as apps and Branzini and Crevettes Pistou for our entrees.   Omar the owner was very attentive to us and made sure we enjoyed our experience and the host was quite charming!  We are looking forward to our next dinner at Barbes.
2018-04-08,5,I had my first meal at this vibrant new restaurant last night. It's nice to have a new cuisine in town - French Moroccan. I love my Italian, Indian, Thai, Japanese etc - but to have a new choice is awesome.  Barbes has an interesting menu with plenty of choices. We started out with some appetizers including an eggplant-hummus dish- I think it was called the Mediterranean Salad, and also mussels and this layered tomato thing. For main courses we had some different couscous dishes with chicken and lamb and the Targine fish.  All were excellent. I have to comment on the atmosphere : the place was quite packed and lively, with high ceilings, and let's just say a smokey quality to the air - smelled quite good, but it was actually so smoky that the fire alarm went off half way through our meal.  I turned to find our waitress but instead found Hoboken firemen coming through to get to the kitchen to get the fire alarm turned off.   When all was taken care of the management did come around and apologized.  Anyway - besides this odd interruption - I still give Barbes 5 stars, highly recommend it, and I will be back. (Maybe I'll bring my own fire extinguisher next time :) ).
2018-04-05,5,Great new restaurant in uptown Hoboken. Food was great. Need a couple more gin/whiskey cocktails, but otherwise good drink menu. Looking forward to a weekday happy hour here!
2018-04-03,5,My wife and I live nearby and have been anticipating what this space would be as we saw it being renovated.  We were hoping for a restaurant and were thrilled to hear that it was.  We ate here recently for the first time and all of our anticipation was met with an incredibly delicious meal and very warm service from the whole staff.  It is a best case scenario for what moved into the once-empty space.  We will be back many times!
2018-03-28,5,My friend and I just had a wonderful dinner ! Food is delicious and Omar and Amine and their team are adorable. I would definitely go back to this place!
2018-03-26,5,Great New Place and a pleasant change to the same old.. same old in Hoboken. Food, Drinks and service all first class. Been here twice already and will make this a regular.
2018-03-25,5,Great new place and a nice addition to Hoboken. The service is fantastic along with the specialty cocktails, which won't disappoint. In addition, I recommend trying the Briouats or Mussels as an appetizer.
2018-03-24,5,Amazing place and a much needed addition to the taverns and pizzas restaurant scene of Hoboken. Everything about the night was great!  They welcomed kids at 6:30 seating. My kids are bit older and well behaved but still nice they welcome family. The wine was delicious, a Moroccan one outside of Casablanca, a well-balanced and easy to drink cab blend. We had the steak, the duck and lamb tagine, all were delicious, generous portions, cooked exact to our order and flavorful. The lamb tagine with dates and onions were delish. Duck had a perfectly crisped skin but with Moroccan spices. Event the green beans that accompanied the main dish was great, according to my husband and he's not a fan of veggies. Dessert traditional Moroccan style was a light pastry with rose water. Light and good. A great addition to Hoboken. Will be back soon for sure!
2018-03-22,5,Authentic Moroccan food. Wonderfully friendly neighborhood vibe. Staff is so welcoming and accommodating. Fresh Mediterranean food-tagine, couscous, salads, lamb and fish are consistently delicious.
2018-03-22,5,Wonderful new addition to hoboken. Great drinks, amazing food and such warm hospitality! We were lucky enough to get a table before the wait started. Super fun night
2018-03-18,2,I wanted to really like this place but it was a disappointment.  The decor was unfinished and dark.  The food was just ok, nothing impressive or authentic. Drinks were good along with friendly and quick service.  Hopefully, they step up their game in the kitchen and hire a professional designer.
2018-03-16,5,Went to Barbès in its first week or two of being open in Hoboken and was very impressed all around. The food was delicious and authentic, the drinks were great, the service was friendly and quick. There isn't really any other place serving similar cuisine in Hoboken, so hopefully they have found a niche and will stick around. Will definitely be going back!
