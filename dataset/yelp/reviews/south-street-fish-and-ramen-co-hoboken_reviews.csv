2021-11-06,5,First time trying ramen def not let down. Would def order from here again good flavor and happy I truer something new
2021-10-05,1,Fish is not fresh at all.  I can't believe the owner/manager still put those already colored raw fish out front to make the Poké bowl.  I immediately returned my poké bowl to them after one bite.  I told them better to put those fish away otherwise customers will get sick.  I'm not even asking my money back just remind them not to use obviously un-fresh ingredients.  They didn't do anything to the fish behind the counter except thanking me for informing them without asking refund.  I already feel uncomfortable of my stomach when I walking out of their shop.
2021-09-04,1,I ordered from this place twice! First time they delivered to the wrong address and second time they cancelled the order after 1 hour and 30 mins without informing me about it. Very very unprofessional and disrespectful of their customers !!
2021-09-01,5,South Street has really good poke and ramen!! They also have pretty big portions which is nice :)
2021-08-26,1,Whoever works on Thursday nights at 8 and answered the phone is a deferent from your restaurant. I asked what time yoi close (on Yelp it says 9:30) - she responds with 8:50. Wtf. Remove her. Completely turned off. Never want to try or go.
2021-08-26,5,Love the poke bowls here! It is always really fresh and the portions are giant! I would ask for sauce on the side because sometimes its a little overwhelming.
2021-07-24,5,Super fresh fish! We ordered a Poke Bowl with Ahi Tuna and Spicy Tuna. The whole bowl was really good.
2021-07-11,4,We ordered the fire chili miso ton men. Ramen was average/mediocre by NYC standards. A NYC 3/5 but perhaps a Hoboken 4. Portions were generous. Broth was lacking depth of flavor. The texture of the soft boiled egg was good, but it was too salty and lacked flavor. Noodles were average texture, not very chewy. The toppings were generous but nothing special. The pulled pork had a good charred flavor but was a bit stringy (wasn't very juicy/fatty). We were craving ramen/soup/noodles that day, so this still hit the spot. Also, this is a fast casual place so they may be catering to the masses (and not ramen enthusiasts).
2021-06-24,3,This is a decent ramen spot. I have eaten both their Champion King Men and Fire Chili Miso Ton Men. The Champion ramen was a great pick. It was rich with seafood and the broth was flavorful. The only downfall was that the egg was served cold while the rest of the dish was hot. As for the Fire Chili ramen it was...okay. I quite frankly did not fancy it.The environment is quite chill though and the staff was friendly.
2021-05-29,3,We could have properly assessed the food if the restaurant chose a better leakproof container for the broth/ soup for the ramens. We got our order by grub hub and the poor driver cannot even properly deliver our food intact because the restaurant used a paper bag and the leaking broth caused a big hole in the bag. We were pretty much forced to eat our ramens dry. The good thing is when I called the restaurant about the problem, they readily offered to fix their mistake without a fuss.
2021-05-26,5,I got the Tokyo soy ramen and I enjoyed every bite. Very flavorful and well priced. The delivery was also lightening fast.
2021-04-30,5,This place was AMAZING. We are not from the area and happened to walk by this place not knowing what to expect. We ordered Ramen (I'm sorry, I forget which one) and built our own poke bowl. DELICIOUS!!!! The ramen was the best I've ever had, the pork in it was amazing, the whole thing was flavorful and great. For how good the ramen was, the poke bowl was even better! Everything about the poke bowl was amazing. We weren't totally sure which things to add into the bowl but everything went together perfectly and we especially loved the seaweed salad. The tuna and salmon were fresh and the sauces were so tasty. I seriously doubt I will ever eat a poke bowl as good as this one again.The portions were HUGE (especially for the price!). We left extremely full and extremely happy. We can't wait to come back to NYC and make a stop in Hoboken so we can relive this experience.Also - the staff were very kind and friendly, and helpful with the questions I had.
2021-03-01,2,Anyone who knows good ramen would not be pleased here. Plus service was weird. I asked fir hot tea and the cashier looked at me like a deer in headlights and literally said, " ummm I don't think we have that stuff here".
2021-02-16,1,I  have been ordering from South Street quite often for years now because the poke bowls are good. However out of the past 5 or so orders at least 4 of them had something wrong with them. We've liked supporting a local restaurant and so we continued to order with them regardless of these issues. However, tonight one of the items I ordered had several things wrong with it (missing items, additional items that were not specified) that made the dish inedible. When I called South Street to request having the correct dish delivered to me so that my boyfriend and I could both eat dinner, the team there was incredibly unhelpful. They have their own delivery drivers but refused to send one to my address with the correct dish to correct the mistakes that were made by them. The employee there said it "would cost too much" to do so - meanwhile I live less than 10 minutes from their restaurant and have spent hundreds of dollars with them. They were unable to provide any type of discount off a future order or anything either. We would have continued to spend our money there as a means of supporting a local restaurant but I cannot support a restaurant such as south street with such terrible customer service and who do NOTHING to correct a problem that they caused and make things right with their loyal customers.
2021-01-21,5,We order from South Street almost once a week these days because the food is so delicious! We love the poke!
2020-12-01,4,A bit salty. Chief is hispanic so not authentic Japanese Ramen. However very generous toppings with seafood and vegetable(i ordered southstreet chilled ramen). It is a decent choice for a quick meal when hungry.
2020-11-23,5,Best poke bowl I've had. Fresh food from the fish gods straight to your belly. I don't know how this place isn't packed everyday. It's so good my foodie kid loves it too. Thank you!
2020-11-19,4,This ramen is the best!  Though I have to say that the service here had been been declining over the past year or so. Shouting/screaming when they answer the phone, eating during dinner break right behind the counter not helping me (fine for me to wait but felt unprofessional for a staff member to be sitting there on their phone), not sealing containers so my ramen broth leaks and bag breaks...  I am very loyal and will continue to get my ramen here. But with other ramen places opening up, management should really improve the service and organization behind the counter. Otherwise I think people will go elsewhere.
2020-10-22,1,The one star is because the poke was not horrible. But the service here was the worst service I have received in years!! The person taking my order was plain rude and would not even answer the one small question I had while ordering. The person making my poke was just as rude and got my order wrong even though I ordered in person.
2020-09-20,2,I was craving for a sushi burrito. Decided to go with build my own option- 2 proteins. I can let it slide when the cashier lady was less than enthusiastic when I was asking questions about the menu. But when they made my order with me standing there watching I was very disappointed. The amount of protein they put in there was so little. I ordered tuna and shrimp tempura. They put what was equivalent to maybe a table spoon of tuna, then they put one fresh shrimp tempura and two tiny broken pieces of shrimp tempura. Looked more like crumbly left overs, in front of me she just simple put it on my burrito. But when it came to the other ingredients she slapped it on generously, I don't really need a seaweed burrito with tiny helpings of protein.  Proportions quite off. 13 dollars I think a burger would've been better.
2020-08-02,4,Poke ingredients are aways fresh and sauces are tasty and light. We usually do spicy veg ramen which comes with green noodles, egg, cherry  tomatoes, etc. - really good but a bit different from an 'authentic' version.Delivery from grubhub is always timely and doesnt take too long even though we live in JC.
2020-07-26,4,What a pleasant surprise! My husband and I don't ever eat any Asian food in Hoboken because well....it's not in Hoboken's wheelhouse. But, since Covid has kept us home, we decided to check out SS because we missed ramen. We chose to try SS because of yelp reviews and primarily the photos of the ramen looked promising. They delivered very quickly within 20 min and the prices are quite cheap compared to what we are used to paying in NYC. I had the Original Ton Men which was very tasty and not too salty. There was a huge, long piece of char siu which was tender and delicious. The bamboo shoots were plentiful but probably from a can and the kikurage was delicious and plentiful too. Overall the dish was quite large-I actually saved some for tomorrow! The ramen noodles taste fresh-we wonder if they are Sun noodles? My egg was overcooked so there is room for improvement there. My husband had the Tokyo Soy Ramen which he said was delicious. Overall, we are pleasantly surprised about SS and will definitely go back. We replayed our ramen after it was delivered. See photos below. Thank you!
2020-07-16,2,Love the pokè bowls but their delivery is horrible.  Currently waiting 2 hours for ONE bowl and they keep telling me any minute. Won't order delivery again, will only do pick up if I'm downtown.
2020-07-05,5,I've been meaning to write a review for their poke for a long time. Don't let the name fool you. They have ramen (and it's quite good and honestly this may be an unpopular opinion but I'm not much of a ramen girl). Their poke tho!!! Literally the best in the area. They are randomly closed at times and I honestly get sad. I stumbled upon their poke during a quick lunch date between clients. The portion is so big I ended up having the left overs for dinner and I was not upset about. This is the type of poke that never gets old. The flavors are mouth watering. The fish is fresh. Literally nothing to complain about. Before quarantine their seating was plentiful but quiet enough that you can collect your thoughts or have a private conversation. I always get the south street special. Highly recommended!!
2020-06-27,3,I did take out for poke and ramen. To be honest, hot and spicy ramen was the most disappointing. There wasn't enough broth to cover all the noodles in the bowl. Broth didn't have enough umami and tonkotsu flavor and there wasn't enough veggie toppings for ramen. Noodles were neither chewy or fresh. Poke was the reason I gave three stars. Tuna and mango were fresh and the poke sauce was refreshing and tangy. Rice was a little stale but overall acceptable.
2020-05-30,1,I will start off by saying, I used to get this nearly everyday before COVID19 hit because I work nearby. It was my go to for poke. However, after a friend went here from my recommendation and had an awful experience, I will never go back. The staff completely disrespected this young woman because she had a food allergy. Not only did they still put the allergen in her ramen, but they hung up on her when she called politely looking for a solution. This is an allergy my friend has had all her life, so she understands well mistakes happen and I have always known her to be a respectful person with these things. When she went back they were yelling at her. Suggesting her allergen tasted good, how could she not eat it? On top of that these employees said they had no manager or supervisor, the owner is and he doesnt come around. Appalling!
2020-05-29,1,I ordered take out from here and the staff are extremely rude and incentive. One lady questioned my order of "no pork" in one of the ramen bowls and made a comment of "you don't like pork, why not?" in a very rude and condescending tone. When I received my food for both items I ordered, they were entirely wrong. To top it off...PORK was in the ramen bowl when I specifically asked for no pork because of my allergy. When I called back to complain, the staff were again rude and did not apologize or try to resolve the issue. I ended up going back to try to speak with a manager but all I got was "the manager never comes around, we can't do anything for you." No sorry, no resolution at all. Extremely disappointed with what looked like a great place.
2020-05-23,5,This place is a good spot to try some good and cheap Ramen! We got the Miso Ramen Bowl and the Original Ton Men Ramen Bowl. Both were absolutely delicious! The broth was very soothing and it was such a hearty meal. Would definitely go back to try the rest. The price is cheap also for a bowl of Ramen. Usually if you go to a Ramen spot you would spend about 40 bucks for two. The only difference is the noodles are the plain ramen noodles not the thick noodles. But overall if your looking for a bowl of Ramen where you can get the bang for the bucks....This is the place to go.
2020-04-21,5,Being in the "new normal" in Hoboken has it's bright side: amazing food never too far away. It was really gloomy out and I was craving ramen. I decided I'd finally try South Street and am so happy I did! Again, this is covid-19 times but I opted for pick up instead of delivery. Ordered right through their Yelp and paid that way too and they made pick up as seamless as possible. All behind the counter were wearing gloves and masks and my order was waiting for me on the table. On to the food! I ordered the Tokyo Soy Ramen. Ramen is not really the perfect take out dish but I do appreciate that this place (like most spots) seperate the broth and the rest of the goods to prevent anything from getting soggy or just messed up.  Everything was hot when I opened it up at home and all I had to do was pour the broth in. Loved it. All of the ingredients worked so well together. The egg was perfectly softboiled, there were plenty of bamboo, the braised pork was soft and had so much flavor, and the kale was something I don't think I've had in ramen before but really loved. And obviously it was packed with noodles. Such a great dinner. It iis raining as I write this review and I am tempted to order another bowl. I definitely recommend if you are looking for a quarantine treat and especially after we are back to normal. Excited to one day hopefully eat in.
2020-03-13,5,I had the ramen here but it wasn't that good.. I think  I probably came on a bad day. Everything else is so good! I always come back for their poke bowl. It's so good I could have two bowls in one sitting. They have so many choices and I love their forbidden rice--tastes like sushi rice but healthier and adds more color to your bowl. The shrimp tempura bun is also amazing. Your taste buds will love you, it's one of the best bao I've had.
2020-03-13,4,I typically wouldn't expect much from a restaurant that serves both poke AND ramen, but I tried their spicy tuna poke bowl and was pleasantly surprised.The bowl is a generous serving size and is filled to the brim with ingredients. I thought the fish quality itself was decent - not the absolute best but it was fine for a poke bowl. What I liked was the different textures and flavors in the rest of the dish. With the spicy tuna bowl, you get a nice bit of spicy from the tuna, sweet from the mango, tang from the seaweed salad, a bit of crunch from the wonton chips, some softness from the guac and rice...it's a little bit of everything in a bite! And all the flavors work well together with their spicy mayo sauce.You can also build your own bowl or burrito here. I took a bite of my boyfriend's sushi burrito and while it was tasty, I thought the poke bowl was more worth it for the size and variety.I'd come back to try their other poke bowls.
2020-02-27,4,This is my go-to delivery meal. I love this ramen! I cant believe ramen this good is available for delivery. I probably order it every other week. The hot and spicy ramen is delicious and comes with a fair amount of meat and noodles. I usually order extra broth just because it's so delicious. My wife is a big fan of the poke bowls, but I cannot speak for them. I think it's just a tad expensive for a bowl of ramen, with my order usually coming out around $20 for delivery. For that I would give 4 stars. Definitely worth checking out!
2020-02-25,5,I can't get enough of this place. Its an order and sit establishment and they bring order to your table.You ever wonder how they make each specific item for a ramen bowl. Like how did they decided to pair these items together well the Hot and Spicy Ramen there's no instructions needed. The bowl and all it's elements make a harmonious dish. The bamboo adds a beautiful crunch, the kale provides a bitter to refresh your pallet. The spicy chicken broth is liquid gold, it's so good. You keep going back for more. It's the perfect amount of heat. Can't forget about the luscious fatty egg. Lastly this can not go unnoticed - the spicy pulled pork! I love braised pork in Ramen but it's not always practical in Ramen bowl, you take a bite and put it back in bowl whereas the pulled pork could be mixed into every single bite. You won't have braised pork again after you try this.
2020-02-23,5,Wow this is the best poke I've ever had!!!Get the sushi burrito and add sweet potato tempura. That crispy crunch is soooo good. Add furikake to they put a very tasty oneExcited to try their other things
2020-02-01,5,I love sushiritto and their sushiritto is amazing (and the only one nearby. There was one in NYC but it closed down.) Haven't tried their ramen but I don't plan to, I just want sushiritto since I love it so much. Also because of the ramen I had in Japan, it ruined my perspective of ramen in America.
2020-01-20,2,Ordered the  Ton Men Original Ramen and Pork Bao.  The ramen stock was bland and did not have  the distinct ramen taste I expected and I had to add soy sauce and some spice powder which I usually don't do. We were told there was no bean sprout as our order was brought to us, and not while we placed the order. The pork topping was a little thick. It would have been betteR if they  used a tender slightly thinner charred pork belly. Please bear in mind  that a successful ramen is dependent on the broth and tasty topping.The pork Bao was equally disappointing. The filling was a thick slab  of pork with not  even a hint  of hoisin or sauce expected from a bao. Not even a piece of  cilantro.  Pork belly would have been a better cut for the bao.For the price charged ($13 for the ramen and $4.50 for a  bao), the food should have been a little more authentic. We should have walked  over to ViVi a few steps away or went to Miso Ramen in Grove Street.
2020-01-02,5,The BEST poke bowls around. The ingredients are so fresh and delicious. Food is always ready on time. Really reasonable prices too!
2019-12-27,5,This was my first time ordering a poke bowl and I had gotten a recommendation from a friend to try this spot out. I was surprised at how large the interior was; from the outside it seems like a small place but once you're inside you see how far in the seating and kitchen are. I went with the South Street Special because I didn't trust myself to create a bowl on my own. It seemed a tad pricey but once I saw how much food I got for $17, I didn't regret it. I chose the forbidden rice for my base and it was so good. Overall, the food was delicious but my appetite just doesn't call for a lot of raw fish which is what this dish has. My favorite parts of the bowl were the forbidden rice, sauce and crab salad. I wasn't a fan of the seaweed salad or masago (but that's just because of my taste preference). The ramen looked good too! I would recommend this place to anyone who likes poke and/or ramen. You can sit inside, order takeout or delivery.
2019-12-27,5,The veggie bowl was superb.  A decent light meal for 2.  Extremely delicious and nutritious, every ingredient top-notch, including the special rice.  A unique culinary experience. Thanks!
2019-12-26,5,Amazing that we have a great ramen place in Hoboken! The spicy veggie ramen competes with Ramen Ya in the city. Just don't get the pesto or tomato in it and ask for corn!! Also they make the best veggie wrap with purple rice and so much good stuff inside. Take the atmosphere with a grain of salt, it's very simple. Very good and fresh food!
2019-12-25,2,My fiancé and I came in with my parents for a late-ish lunch at around 2 pm on a Sunday. There was one other couple dining there and no one ordering takeout. Already not a good sign. We had noticed that this place was always empty, so we never gave it a chance until this day. They serve ramen and poke bowls (odd, I know), you order at the counter, and they bring it to you. My parents had the Original Ton Men (braised pork, egg, onion, bean sprouts, nori, seaweed, kikurage, bamboo, roasted onion flakes). I had the Fire Chili Miso Ton Men (Fired pulled pork, egg, onion, bean sprout, nori seaweed, kikurage, bamboo, roasted onion flakes.) It was basically just a slightly spicy version of the original ton men but with pulled pork instead. I feel like most of the ingredients didn't really go together. It was more like 'whatever they could find that is Asian and seems like it could go into a bowl of ramen' ramen. It didn't taste bad, but it was just odd. I did appreciate that they didn't overcook the noodles though. My fiancé created his own poke bowl. The color of his spicy tuna was a fiery hot orange, like a flaming hot Cheeto. Looked pretty questionable, but it didn't taste off. It just tasted like they added a lot of stuff to it to hide any fishiness. I probably wouldn't risk ordering anything raw from here again, especially not with so many other poke places popping up in Hoboken now. In fact, I probably wouldn't visit again. I'd probably prefer the dried ramen noodles. I too can haphazardly throw random ingredients into a bowl.
2019-12-11,2,Ordered a Ramen with extra broth and noodles. Broth was leaking and ruined everything else.  But even what was originally Ramen with pork was not even close to what you can expect from a decent Korean place.
2019-12-05,5,I'm fighting off a cold so I was on a quest through Hoboken for really great soup. This did not disappoint. I ordered the Hot & Spicy ramen which is made with pulled pork, egg, sesame seeds, onion, bean sprouts, nori seaweed, bambo, kale, chilli oil, and roasted onion flakes. The spice level was perfect, not overpowering. The broth is very flavorful. The best parts are the genourous strips of pulled pork, the kale which absorbs all of the flavor really well, and the egg which adds amazing flavor. I ordered take out and I love how the broth was packaged separately. There is something so oddly satisfying about pouring the broth over your ramen fillings and watching it all come together. The portion was large and very filling so well worth the $14.95. I will definitely come back. It was that good.
2019-11-28,2,Service needs improvement. We arrived the place at 8:55pm (while it says closing at 9.30pm). It looks like the staff has wrapped up everything, and ready to leave. We were planning to grab something quick. But even before we could make our order, we were told that we could only order ramen, and only take-out, as they do not take dine-in any more. Will leave two stars for service (or lack of) until we are not implicitly told to leave next time...
2019-11-27,5,The hot and spicy ramen is so good! I ordered it with extra braised pork belly--sooo flavorful. Also I love that they give both halfs of the ramen egg and not just one! The broth was the perfect amount of spicy and it wasn't oily or heavy at all. I will definitely be back!
2019-11-24,4,Had this delivered on a cold and rainy day, just what we wanted!The hot & spicy was good, but could have been spicier! The pork was in big pieces but tender and shredded quite nicely. The kale was a nice touch as well, but for delivery, not too bad!
2019-11-22,4,First time we ate here tonight. Service was quick. We had to get our own water though. I paid and tipped and feel as though you don't need to tip. They only brought us the food we paid for.We ordered the shrimp bao bun and crab bao bun. We also ordered the South Street Ramen. Both bao buns were excellent! The shrimp was the best, we highly recommend it! The bun was warm, soft, and fresh. They smell good too lol. The shrimp and the crab were cooked perfect and were crunchy. The cucumber was fresh.The south street ramen was large. The broth was delicious. We got it without pork (I don't eat it). Everything was cooked perfect. Our only complaint is that it's $17 which is overpriced for the tiny little clams and tiny calamari and little pieces of fish you get. The seaweed was good.We will be back and we will get another shrimp bao bun and try another menu item. I like that you can make your own too. Great options!
2019-11-13,1,Steer clear - I ordered from seamless at 7pm and when I called TWO hours later they insisted it was on its way still... I waited for another 15 minutes and called again - they still insisted it was on its way rather than check with the driver. Finally I called again asking them to please check with the driver who they then finally called to say it was left with the doorman due to me not answering my door or calls. I had zero missed calls and had heard no knocks which makes me believe he was lying. In any case, I called back since my food arrived freezing cold and over TWO HOURS late and they would not even issue a refund or partial credit OR A SIMPLY APOLOGY. Some customer service? And to top it off the long waited ramen SUCKED. Truly the place is all around boot leg no flavor aside from the heavy salt.
2019-10-29,4,I ordered through Grubhub. I am a huge fan of Ramen & Poke bowls so I thought this would be the best of both worlds. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. The portions were big. Built own Poke Bowl:1.) Base - White Rice 2.) Ahi Tune & Salmon3.) Edamame , Seaweed Salad, Pickled Red Cucumber, and Scallions4.) Original Poke Sauce & Spicy Mayo5.) Fried ShallotsIf I had to rate my poke bowl I would give it a 4/5. I wouldn't rate it a perfect 5 because the fish did not taste fresh. Hot & Spicy Ramen - The soup was tasty and the broth was seasoned well. I would definitely recommend this soupOverall I would recommend this place for the ramen! I will order again in the near future to try other ramens!
2019-10-20,5,Really good poke bowls with huge portions. I created my own bowl and everything was very fresh and tasty. I haven't tried the ramen yet but would definitely recommend the poke bowls.
2019-10-16,5,I will never eat lunch anywhere else in Hoboken! The Poke bowl was SO GOOD. I went with Ahi Tuna and Spicy Tuna with guacamole, edamame, mango, and pickled red cucumber topped with tempura flakes, peanut sauce, and sesame sauce. I highly recommend doing the same!The tuna is so fresh and all the flavors are absolutely delicious.
2019-10-12,3,We went in for lunch and it was eerie how dim it was, but we ordered our ramen at the back of the restaurant and found seats. My boyfriend got the Tokyo ramen and I got champion king ramen. I found the broth to be too creamy and not much pork flavor. There were A LOT of toppings (none of which were very good) including an array of seafood and sour bamboo shoots. My boyfriend's ramen was bland and the pork was dry. I'm pretty surprised this place is rated so high. It was overpriced for low quality food.
2019-10-09,2,I'll start by saying the food here is really great and we order here frequently (Every week or every other week).  However delivery has become ridiculous lately arriving within 30 min later than estimated.  Today it finally just never came.  We called after it was 45 min late to be told by the restaurant (rather flippantly) that the driver had it and was on his way.  Then 30 min later once it didn't arrive we called the restaurant again to find out they were closed and not answering calls (even though our food still had not arrived).  Then was able to get a hold of seamless who called the driver who told us that it would arrive in 5 min at 10:10 (2 hours later than estimate).  Then an hour later called it quits as it never came.  If you enjoy actually eating the food you order then you may want to skip this restaurant.  Ridiculous.
2019-10-04,5,Nice menu variety, tast fresh, o ly complaint was bamboo shoots were a little hard on one of the three we ordered.  Will def try again
2019-09-28,5,Best Ramen I have ever had. Braised pork was cooked well and chicken broth was really good. Have been going there just for their Ramen once or twice a month!
2019-09-17,4,Tried this place for first time over the weekend.We ordered delivery through uber eats.We ordered two build your own bowls.The options for protein,toppings and mix ins are plenty.I liked their original poke sauce.The food was very tasty and fresh.Will try to visit this place in person next time.I wish they have zucchini noodles for salad option.
2019-09-13,4,Not bad had the south street ramen which was pretty good but not the best. It seemed like a lot but the kale was an interesting addition. The pork in  it didn't really taste like anything. The poke was really good. I would probably do the poke than the ramen.
2019-09-05,4,Never tried it before so I ordered a bowl of ramen. It was a pork ramen bowl and it had a bunch of other ingredients in it. You have to be more on the adventurous side if you want to enjoy this type of cuisine. It is delicious don't get me wrong but sometimes you aren't sure what you are eating. They have quick delivery as well and it comes hot.  For any adventurous eaters out there give this place a shot.  They have brought a unique concept to life in Hoboken! Love it.
2019-08-27,3,Have ordered for pick up, waited almost 30 min today for my pick up as large parties of peopleCame in, ordered, got their food and left, wholeTime I had been just sitting there and no one called my name. I know it's busy but communication is key, otherwise would have given 5 stars
2019-08-21,5,God level. The only way to describe this place. We Ordered  through Uber eats and unfortunately Ive held every Ramen place to this one and I've been disappointed. It's like eating at the best place first and trying to find someone that's better. It doesn't get any better than this.
2019-08-16,4,2nd time here.  First time, I don't think I ordered the right stuff.  2nd time, much better or at least I know what's a better mix for "make your own poke" bowl.  The half/half forbidden rice and romaine is pretty good. I recommend doing the half/half base, and then putting the extra toppings as needed.
2019-08-13,3,Honestly I get annoyed with this place, you never know what kind of service you're going to get; some days the services here is pretty good and then other days, they don't make my order. Some days the food here can actually really good and I enjoy it, then other times the food is cold. You have to choose the right day to eat here.
2019-07-25,5,The poke from here is AMAZING. My first visit I was glad to see all the options they had for the bowls, some of the poke I've had from other places didn't have as many options and it was fun to try new toppings! I got a bowl with two proteins, the salmon and shrimp tempura (I can't stress enough how delicious it was). Above everything, I actually shared my bowl and I was completely full with only half, so the portion sizes are more than enough for one. We paid roughly $14 after tax for it all, which isn't too bad considering I got two proteins rather than one. I can't wait to go back and try some other stuff off the menu!
2019-07-21,4,A really good first ramen place to have in Hoboken. The broth is flavorful and still light. Spicy pulled pork and the loin are exceptional. Tender and moist. Noodles are a little stiff still. Then again, I'm ordering take out and not eating in
2019-07-10,4,Probably the best poke I had in the area, would have totally deserved 5 stars on its own merit, just that they also sell Ramen that is just OK...Seriously can't go wrong with the South Street Special Poke, I do however def recommend to get the half/half with forbidden rice and romaine, as a full serving of the rice is IMHO too much of a good thing.As for the Ramen, nothing wrong, yet nothing to write home about
2019-06-18,4,Delicious, delicious. My boyfriend and I were craving ramen on a cold day and this place did the thing. Tasty, we both got the hot and spicy ramen. Not too spicy, and filled with flavor. We also got a side of some bao buns and they were good as well. Definitely have to go back because I heard the poke is delicious!
2019-06-04,2,Full disclosure: I want to give this place a good review for its food, but it's management and customer service was horrific. I came here today (4 Jun 2019) around 11:20 with my wife and ordered a few minutes after reviewing the menu. I DO NOT eat red meat for health reasons so I opted for a chicken broth ramen. My wife and I both ordered the South Street Ramen which is a medley of shellfish. At the time of ordering, I told guy who took my order "Please remove the pork." I paid ~$36 for it and it was enormous amount of food. After eating about 3/4 of everything, my wife said she tasted pork. I told her I doubt it and we continued. I dig deeper into the bowl and pulled out an entire strip of pork meat. I went over to the guy who took my order and told him. He walked by my table, took a look, and dismissed our claim and said that what we found was really just seafood but he was unsure. I told him to go check with the person who put it together. He returned and told us that he was wrong and that strip of pork that we had found was indeed pork. He then said his manager will not refund us and will be willing to give us 10% or 20% off our next order. He also said that his manager said that they will not replace our order.This in itself, was very unappealing. They have no policy to correct the order. Also, the fact that they were saying 10 or 20% was weird because it was as if they were uncertain. Due to them not replacing or refunding my meal, I will not return. I did not accept their offer for a discounted meal. Also, for what was in the bowl, it was greatly overpriced.
2019-05-15,5,Nice decor and great ramen. There is plenty room to sit inside and I have got delivery a few times and it has always come on time and hot!
2019-05-03,5,This is my go to poke bowl place! First you get to pick your base which usually I get half a bowl of kale and the other half I get forbidden rice. If you haven't had their forbidden rice yet make sure to try it as this is delicious. Then you can add either 1 or 2 toppings of protein, spicy tuna or ahi tuna are my go to proteins here. After this you can add your veggie/other toppings and sauce. They have a decent amount of seating here but I usually do take out so haven't really sat down to eat. No alcohol is served inside but I believe you can just bring your own. I haven't tried any of the other menu options yet as the poke bowl with the forbidden rice is so good it's hard to pick something different but will get an updated review if I do.
2019-04-27,3,Noodles could've been much better. Broth was tasty. Dish made worth it by the ample portion of spicy pork. Average at best.
2019-04-17,5,The poke has always been fresh and very yummy! Also the portion sizes for the price are very generous especially compared with other poke spots in the area. I've tried different places but always end up coming back here. 5 stars!
2019-03-31,5,This place has really great Ramen and sushi burritos. One of our favorite takeouts in Hoboken. You can add extra broth and extra noodles perfect portion for kids that like plain soup.
2019-03-31,3,Good food, fast service, however no waiters/waitresses asking if anything else is needed. Very simple place.
2019-03-30,2,Prob the worst sushi wrap i have ever had.. seaweed wrap felt like a rubbish stretchy paper where it was impossible to eat as a burrito and when i digged out just the inside with fork it wasn't as fresh & flavorful as i expected.. the specialty poke wrap was so not worth the $17..
2019-03-30,5,We got the poké and ramen here. The food were pretty good. It's spacious so it's good for larger groups and with kids. Will definitely come back again.
2019-03-26,3,This was ok. I love trying new ramen spots and this wasn't one of the best. The place was empty and the table definitely needed some cleaning. It is an order and seat yourself vibe. I order the spicy vegetarian ramen and steamed buns (crab and shrimp). It was not spicy at all, but the flavor ok. The steamed buns were HUGE but were also just ok flavor wise. Also it is right next to bar so you here the music through the walls. Wasn't terrible but could definitely use some work, definitely not worth traveling there just order!
2019-03-24,3,Place was decent. I'm curious if they are better in person. We got delivery and the noodles were not the best. Enjoyed the flavor though the broth didn't stand out which is important when I am judging ramen. Tried a spicy one and had decent heat.
2019-03-19,5,This place is amazing. Their menu has great variety, everything is so fresh and portioned just right. Staff is friendly and place is always clean. I don't eat soup so I can't comment on that, but this place is a must! I also eat here about twice a week.
2019-03-18,4,I would technically give this place 4 stars for the poke bowls but the give it 3 stars for their ramen. I went with the south street special poke bowl. Go hard or go home ! Fully loaded with spicy tuna, ahi tuna & crab with seaweed salad (delicious) which I got over rice and kale. I thought the mixtures of teriyaki and spicy mayo was a nice touch. The bowl was more than I'd like to spend, $18, but it was super filling !! My friend got the miso ramen which I didn't find too flavorful and the veggies were a little undercook. I also tried their shrimp tempura buns which I wasn't crazy about. I wouldn't come back for ramen but definitely for their poke bowls. Super fresh!! Service is friendly and there's plenty of street parking.
2019-03-07,3,I love ramen and this place was just okay. The broth had good flavor and the pork was nicely cooked, but the toppings were lacking. I had four pieces of Kale and maybe 6 bamboo shoots. I was shocked, I removed the mushrooms and the sprouts, but expected there to be more. There was one long piece of pork belly that was delicious but small. The food was good but the portion size of toppings was disappointed.
2019-02-27,5,Exceptional surprise. On time delivery, food was hot and fresh. Presentation is fabulous. You get what you pay for
2019-02-24,5,The ramen was really good, it was spicy but not too crazy. I liked that it was pulled pork and not big pieces of pork. We were only one eating in the restaurant but there was foot traffic there. You have to order at the counter so it is good for a quick dinner place.
2019-02-24,5,One of the better poke places I've been to. The food tastes fresh and they give a good quantity of food into each order  .Definitely recommend the poke bowl which comes with either one or two protein, one or two bases (white rice, forbidden rice, kale or romaine lettuce), 4 sides, 1 topping and 1 sauce.Can't wait to try their ramen !
2019-02-18,4,This has turned out to be my go to restaurant for Ramen.I usually order pickup or delivery and food is always tasty and prepared quickly. The spicy sesame vegetarian ramen bowl is simply yummy!! Wishing they had more veg options though..
2019-02-10,5,You know that a place has good food when you find yourself craving it all the time. South street has the best poke around...I literally cannot get enough of it! You have do a single protein bowl for $11 or double protein bowl for $13... I usually do the double and it's enough for 2 meals! So tasteful and delicious...so glad this place opened
2019-01-27,5,I've only ordered delivery but I've seen the food being plated very nicely if you decide to eat in. This spot has a lot of good options and the portions are pretty good. I usually order the half kale and half rice with a protein. One reason I like this place is that they offer chicken katsu, which is basically chicken cutlet but I like it in my bowl or burrito if I choose something besides the typical tuna or salmon. To me the bowl is best bang for your buck, the burrito was amazing but the size of it is smaller compared to what you get with a bowl. Ive also had the spicy ramen here delivered and it was great. I prob should and will get that in person cause I prefer it super hot. But overall this place never fails me whenever I'm craving something good and healthier/light.  They have free delivery also from 2:30-530 on grubhub!
2019-01-13,5,The ramen was so good my girlfriend and I forgot to take a picture. She ordered a chicken miso ramen with braised pork and she loved it, this is amazing because she don't normally eat pork. I ordered a original ton men ramen and I honestly did not expect this quality from a take out place. I love the setup of this place, it looks like a restaurant but since you order at the counter, it doubles as a quick and fast take out place. Great ramen, very delicious, we would come back.
2019-01-07,5,I went there in December 2018. I had the reel your own(half rice and salad bowl) which included salad, kale, guacamole, shrimp tempura, ginger, wonton and plantain chips on a bed of forbidden rice. The best bowl I've ever had. Hoboken is about 30 minutes from me otherwise I'd have one of those bowls several times a week. Delicious
2019-01-05,3,I was on my way back to Philly from New York and decided to stop into this place. Walking in, it doesn't really feel like a Ramen place. Nobody to greet you and self seating. You order at the register and sit down for them to bring the food to you. I had the traditional Ramen and it was good, but not anything over the top.  My friend had the miso based Ramen and said that hers was very good, but she has never had Ramen before, so I take that with a grain of salt lol. We also had the pork bun and thought it was good. I thought the prices were a little high, but maybe I'm just spoiled by the Philly Ramen scene. The food came out in a timely manner and the people working there were friendly. Parking isn't too difficult and the area is clean and felt safe.  Over all I would say this is a good place to have Ramen.
2018-12-30,2,We went there to try the ramen. We ordered one ordinary pork chachu ramen and a seafood champion king ramen. For the original Ton men (pork ramen) it was ok. As for my $17 Champion seafood ramen, it was a disappointment. Broth was ok - a bit like watery pasta white sauce taste - to me I can live with it. The part that really make me mark down their ramen are as follows: 1. SLIMY PORK PIECES. I got the idea of using cornstarch to soften the meat, but if you don't wash it out, it will make your pork slimy and discussing especially fatty piece of pork. I don't think mixing pork in is a good idea. It confused me as a seafood ramen.2. THE LOW GRADE INGREDIENTS (small size) Even though trying to make up with quantity, it was a bad impression judging from the size of shrimp, calamari ring/squid and the fishcake.3. INGREDIENT PREPARATION. No one cut the egg like that (horizontally) nor the fish cake. Also, it is a self serving restaurant (FYI). I hope the restaurant try to improve these points. For me I prefer quality over quantity, under reasonable pricing.
2018-12-01,5,I was extremely satisfied with my meal here! The place is relaxing with great food. I had a poke bowl and a pork bun. Both were really fantastic and reasonably priced. The food came out quickly and the staff was attentive. I highly recommend coming here for a quick bite or to sit and hangout with friends.
2018-11-23,2,I mean, it's ok. I got the spicy ramen and it was spicy, but nothing extraordinary. I thought the pulled pork didn't mix well with the rest of the ingredients. Also, really big chunks of onion throughout the soup. The price was also too much for average ramen. I mean, I get it's Hoboken, but quality should also be top notch. The bao was also not good at all. I ordered the shrimp and it could have been executed so much better. Overall, I wouldn't revisit this place. I'm sure there are better ramen places around.
2018-11-19,5,South street ramen is definitely the best poke bowl in town! They have a huge variety of mix-in options and sauces. The portions are generous for both the burrito and the bowl. Everything is always served fresh and their customer service is excellent!
2018-11-09,1,Not good- miso ramen in jersey city is so much better. My boyfriend and I didn't even finish our food it was so nasty.
2018-10-26,4,The first time I went here, I had the miso ramen and I was a bit let down - it was fine, but nothing special. Having said that, I've come here a couple times since and tried two different ramen types (Tokyo Soy and Hot and Spicy) that I thoroughly enjoyed, so maybe my first visit was just a fluke. I was also happy to see that they handle ramen takeout the "right" way, which is to separate the broth and the ingredients in separate containers so the noodles don't get soggy before you get home. Definitely worth visiting if you have the urge for ramen in Hoboken.
2018-10-23,4,Really solid place to pick up a poke bowl in Hoboken.  I recommend the two-protein poke bowl which is good value.  I haven't had their ramen but often see others eating it and it looks decent.
2018-10-20,1,This is by far the worst ramen I have ever tasted. It was tasteless, the broth was bland, full of onions, noodles were just tasteless... EVERYTHING WAS TASTELESS. What a waste of money. It's so bad that I'm writing here at the spot. Even instant noodles are better than this. I'm not sure how this place gets 4 stars. The worst food I've experienced ever. It was a waste of our $30.
2018-10-08,5,Best poke bowl I've ever had! I had the south street bowl and added edamame in there and the burrito pictured is the same as my bowl but with shrimp tempura, and forbidden rice. I loved the forbidden rice and the size of this bowl was crazy! I've tried a poke bowl place on Staten Island and it was 1 scoop of fish and the rest was mostly rice. This bowl on the other hand was perfectly proportioned and had soooo much fish in it! I took what I didn't finish home and my mom and dad both ate it that's how big it was! This is a must try place, skip the sushi rolls and get a poke bowl instead!
2018-10-02,5,Today was my first time ordering from this place, it's right across the street from my office. I am so impressed by how my protein bowl came out, delicious. Their kimchi is actually spicy, and their fish is super fresh. There's so many options for your bowl, and their forbidden rice is amazing. Super fast service, and extremely kind employees.
2018-10-01,5,There are two startup Poke restaurants and no Ramen places near home, so I was delighted to find this eatery while on a business trip to NJ. The place is clean and modern, and though small, seems to have plenty of seating during a busy lunch hour.  I was tempted by the Poke, but decided on the Fire Chili Ton Mien, because anything with "fire chili" in the name has to be good, right?  It was!One of my companions had Poke, and he enjoyed it, too.  The servings are a good size, and if I have the opportunity to visit Hoboken again, I will definitely make a point to stop here again.
2018-09-11,5,Impressive. I was skeptical at first but after trying the poke bowl and the ramen I can say its really good. The ramen is flavorful yet simple, I really want to try all the different variations to see what's the best. The poke is fresh and just wow. For the money you cannot go wrong with this new place. I pray they stick around because this will be my go to for poke and ramen. My only ask is that they have side portions of fish in whatever sauce or topping you want for a nominal price. Such as spicy salmon with crispy shallots for $6.  Would be a great option.
2018-09-09,5,Their special is the best poke bowl we ever had. Absolutely delicious! And their new pork buns are great too.
2018-09-07,1,The spicy vegetarian ramen is not spicy at all, with its creamy broth and tastes more like made from not veggie stuff. The noodles are greenish, the whole taste of it is not so nice, the ambience itself is fine, but don't expect anything great looking
2018-09-07,5,Easily one of the best (and prettiest!) poke bowls I've ever had. Super fresh and really tasty!
2018-08-31,3,Love this place for a good poke bowl! The fish is fresh and the portions are hefty. I only wish they offered cauliflower rice as an option but hopefully that will come along as the trend picks up!
2018-08-23,5,This is bybfar the best poke place in Hoboken.  Quality, quantity, flavor, it is way better than the other 4 placrs I tries in town.  Their poke burrito is awesome!  Definitely try it out!
2018-08-09,2,Don't buy the fake photos on the yelp. The seafood ramen is totally over-charged. The seafood is not fresh nor good quality . The egg is the worst. Don't waste your money here.
2018-08-01,2,Maybe a 2 star rating is a little harsh but there was nothing special about this place as the reviews I think overshoot it. I entered to a "chipotle-styled" ramen place where everything is customizable. Some people see this as a good thing but I personally don't. The ramen was average. Not bad, not phenomenal. But the main reason I am giving 2 stars is because I've eaten at much more authentic ramen places where the menus aren't even English and the soups are out of this world and I've paid $9 versus the $14 or $15 I spent here. I guess it caters more to its Hoboken audience.
2018-07-09,5,Lots of fresh options to customize a poke bowl and very generous on portions. Can't wait to return for a sushi burrito. Great for a quick, casual lunch/dinner.
2018-07-09,5,I eat here strictly for the poke bowl. so many options to choose from, and most of all, at a FAIR price. all of Hudson area needs to take note because I cannot find a decent poke place that is tasty, good portioned, and worth it. usually poke bowl will rob me of 16-20$ worth of mediocre poke bowls. but this place really satisfies my poke cravings. I get the 2 protein bowl with forbidden rice, gaucomole, spicy tuna, and salmon with other toppings and it is divine. I usually eat here at least twice a week. I haven't tried the ramen but when I pass by it, it looks tasty and reasonably priced compared to other high price ramen bowls. and ramen should not exceed 10-12 dollars for a decent meal.the place is spacious and has comfortable seats. and the service is fine, nice looking people that just do their job which is all I need. I'm excited to see that there are appetizers, finally, of pork buns and soft shell crab. and will have to give them a try on the bear future.
2018-07-08,3,Got the miso ramen and husband got original ton men. It honestly wasn't that great and the server even forgot which ramen was what. We had to figure it out ourselves. Let me start with the good about miso ramen - noodles were cooked well, onions were a nice contrast to the creamy broth, chashu was cooked and seasoned well, and cant bo wrong with bamboo shoots.  Now the downside, I expected a miso broth to be thin but it wasn't. More of a creamy texture. Not really  into that, but if you are, all yours. Also it was kind of sweet, not a good sweet but sickening sweet. And then the egg, oh my God. You bite that and it's cold as fuck. Egg yolk wasn't runny because it was congealed from being fridged too long. Lastly, kale. Kale doesn't make sense to me. It's like they put little thought to it and said hey let's jump on the health wagon and put kale. Spinach would've been better.
2018-06-21,3,Came by here for a quick dinner. Seating and restaurant ambiance is nice for a casual date, but the food is mediocre at best. I got a personalized poke bowl. The fish and proteins were fresh, but I found the overall bowl not very satisfying. The peanut sauce was the redeeming savior to my eating experience.My boyfriend got the spicy ramen and it was a disappointment. The ramen noodles were either less than a dollar ramen packets you buy at the grocery store, or noodles that had very similar consistency and texture as the cheap ramen noodles. The broth was not rich (felt like it was sitting in a pot for too long of a time) and the price tag did not make it worth the value. Would recommend saving your ramen budget for a decent ramen place like ippudo or tonchin in the city.I most likely will not return here to eat sitdown, but may order delivery for the poke bowl.
2018-06-20,5,The short: amazing customizable poke bowls that are officially in my lunch rotation. The longer: This spot is unassuming. It's on Washington near a bunch of other popular lunch spots. They have ramen, burritos & bowls-- and my favorite is their poke bowl. You can choose a base (rice or salad or both), proteins, additional toppings and crunchy options. The salmon is always super fresh, and the portions are HUGE for like $11-14 dollars. Overall, great lunch spot that I'm so happy to know about in Hoboken!
2018-06-12,4,I was visiting my best friend and she brought me here because she knows my love for Poke. This place has a pretty cool ambiance and friendly enough people. You order at the register and they bring the food to you (you don't see them make it). Like most Poke places I go to, I create my own. I started with a white rice and 2 proteins of Ahi Tuna then picked Tamago, Masago, Seaweed Salad and Scallion as my Toppings. For my sauce, I did Spicy Mayo (which was pretty spicy) then lastly topped it with some Wonton Chips and Fried Shallots.They give you a lot of rice and a good amount of fish / toppings for the price. I've never seen Tamago in a Poke Bowl so that was a pleasant surprise. They provide water, if you want, but also have drinks for purchase as well. I definitely know if this place was near me - I would eat here often.
2018-06-10,4,Ordered the Tokyo Soy Ramen. Ramen was pretty good in my opinion though I think the heat was not turned high enough. I probably would go again and try out a different ramen!
2018-06-10,5,Just a quick update. On a recent visit, we found out that its BYOB friendly. There's a liquor store conveniently on the same block.
2018-06-09,5,THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD! I'm always skeptical when I see a new ramen place open (I lived in Japan for a while so it's difficult for American places to live up to the comparison) and I'm happy to say that I was super pleasantly surprised at how good South Street is. If you're in Hoboken and like ramen or poke I highly recommend trying it. I've tried both and was blown away both times. Really awesome food.
2018-05-30,5,Best Ramen spot in Hoboken, hands down.  Hot n' Spicy ramen is where it's at.  Impressed!
2018-05-30,4,Great ramen and poke spot in Hoboken! My boyfriend had his first sushi burrito here and loved it. Ingredients were fresh and tasty. I got the original ton men ramen which was a little bland but still good nonetheless. Will probably opt for the spicy one next time.Restaurant is self serve, so you order at the front and then seat yourself. Staff was nice.
2018-05-28,5,I can't remember exactly what I ate but I believe the it was a special ramen that had basil noodles - so delicious. It was actually the best ramen I ever had and will definitely be back !  Very quick service at lunch.
2018-05-27,3,Stopped in here after seeing a comedy show at the Hoboken Library.It was obvious that they wanted to close and weren't thrilled that we had come in, even though they had another half hour to go.I ordered a Poke Bowl. Rather expensive for what it was, with very little tuna. My husband had ramen and wasn't overly satisfied. He found it weak compared to the many  places he frequents in Englewood. Definitely not a must-visit spot in Hoboken.
2018-05-25,2,First rime we had really good ramen but tonite the noodles smelled and tasted rotten...they said its the normal smell but I didn't notice it the first time around. Disappointed with my order.
2018-05-24,5,this place is amazing! a very rich option when it comes to eating something fast and healthy! 100% recommended I love it!
2018-05-16,5,I tried their Ahi tuna poke bowl yesterday and I thought it was great! I ate the whole thing and the forbidden rice was really nice. I shall be back for everything on the menu.
2018-05-14,5,Can only speak for the poke bowl which was so tasty and fresh. The forbidden rice has great flavor and the ahi tuna is delicious ! A bit pricier as makai poke offers unlimited toppings while this place has you pick 4. Will definately be trying differenr poke combinations!
2018-05-12,1,For $14 per ramen, I expected Ippudo quality. What I got was a flavorless broth, cheap noodles and tough pork. The supermarket ramen in the styrofoam container tastes better. Clearly anyone who has reviewed this place previously has never had Ramen.
2018-05-12,3,It's a weird kind of ramen. Not like Chinese nor like Japanese one. It's below my expectations and below average. And it cost me $13. It tasted so plain and felt like just a noodle soup with soy source. Maybe it's a good alternative choice in Hoboken but this restaurant definitely won't survive if they were in Chinatown. How strange that restaurant will survive in Hoboken.
2018-05-06,5,Good ramen, great service, recommend! Were passing by on Cinco de Mayo, while everywhere it was crowded, it was pleasant to find nice and calm place to have hot soup. We tried only ramen cnnot tell anything about other food.
2018-04-30,2,We decided to try this spot because we were craving hot ramen and it is close to the office.  Normally, we take a ride over to Kitakata Ramen Ban Nai in Jersey City but that adds time to the trip.Unfortunately, the ramen at South Street doesn't make stand up to Kitakata.  The broth was luke warm and the noodles were a little tough. The egg was perfectly cooked.I don't have ramen often so I'll likely give South Street another try but if the experience is the same, investing a little more time will be worth it for a drive over to Jersey City.
2018-04-19,5,Love love the champon ramen! This is my new favorite ramen spot and so close by. If however you are looking for a bit more traditional ramen broth, I recommend the fire chili one.
2018-04-19,4,I can only speak about the ramen at this place as I don't like poke or raw fish.That being said, I give this place 4-stars for the ramen.I ordered the Fire Chili Miso Ton Men ramen and my husband ordered the South Street ramen.I am pretty picky about miso ramen (it's my favorite, and we actively search out ramen places around the area), and this one is near the top of the list!The fire pulled pork was a pleasant surprise and addition to the dish!  I had actually asked that they replaced the pulled pork with the braised pork, and they accidentally gave me both.  In comparison, I'm glad they left the fire pulled pork on there as it was delicious and much more tasty than the braised pork.  The fire pulled pork is not too spicy (I can't go much past "medium" level intensity) with a nice flavor.My husband also preferred my ramen to his seafood ramen.  He commented that the seafood was nice, but the flavor wasn't as nice as mine.  Also, with the milder chicken broth, he commented it didn't taste much like "ramen" typically but was a nice seafood soup.  Pretty solid place.. you do have to order at the bar, so seating is first-come basis.
2018-04-17,3,We ordered here dinner via Uber eats and it was okay. I ordered the original ton ken ramen and it was ok.  I've had my share of good ramen and this was just ok. Nothing to rave about. The noodles were a little bit to thin and the broth was little bit too salty (for me at least). We also ordered poke bowl and created our own Reel with spicy tuna as protein.  It wasn't your typical poke, where you have nice bite size chunks of fish. This spicy tuna was literally a scoop and the tuna you would expect inside a spicy tuna roll. I wouldn't order from here again.
2018-04-17,5,I had the champion king ramen and I'm so happy with it. They didn't slump on any seafood or noodles it was really good. Yes, not authentic ramen, nevertheless it was delicious and worth every penny.I picked up my order during lunch and many people were there which was a good sign. My order was ready in a good amount of time and I didn't have to wait around.Will come here more often :)
2018-04-14,5,Amazing place! Ramen and south special poke! Yummy Nice quiet place and very friendly people working here.
2018-04-13,3,Look of place screams New England as expect lobster rolls and clam chowder.  Instead get poke and ramen.Now that there are so many poke places have to really differentiate self.  I liked the forbidden rice but overall found it kind of bland even with pouring plenty of sauce.    They did have Mexican coke which is a plus.    Service was a bit slow as really only one that ordered.  Hate to see how long during busy time.
2018-04-13,3,UPDATE: I ordered again, in person, and they still managed to mess up my order! They need to train their employees to provide to customers what they order! I called and explained that this is my second time ordering and the second time they messed up my order. They were very nice and refunded the cost of my meal. I will try them again because the food is very tasty, but will be watching them like a hawk to make sure they get things right.
2018-04-12,5,This is place is perfect lunch spot! The food taste so fresh and it was really enjoyable. The staff was very polite and made me super welcomed in their establishment. Also, the establishment decor creates a positive relaxing feel where you truly enjoy your order. If you in the area around lunch time I definitely recommend coming here. Plus it's Ramen Noodles! Who doesn't love Ramen Noddles!
2018-04-10,4,I found their ramen to be one of the best ramen places in the area. It definitely satisfied my craving for ramen. I ordered the ramen with all the sea creatures (I can't remember the name but I believe it was their top tier ramen). The broth was white like milk... which I honestly never had before but it was tasty and rich. There was an abundance of meat, noodles, and veggies. The price was high. For two ppl I spent around $50 on two orders of ramen to two drinks. I would honestly come back though. They have other options than ramen, the service was great, and the food was good.
2018-04-05,4,Yummy! I got a takeout order of the Create-your-own Poké bowl and it was ahhhmazing. There's a huge range of toppings and you get to pick from, for mine I got:* Base - Half Kale/Half Forbidden Rice (i'd recommend this if you don't want to be too full)* Proteins - Spicy Tuna and Salmon * Sides - you get 4 - I got guacamole (sounds weird but it was delicious!), kimchi, purple cabbage and edamame *Crunchies - you get 2- I got sesame seeds and furikake, don't think they actually sprinkled any on though..* Sauces - spicy mayo and original poke sauce - both delicious ! didn't end up using the spicy mayo since I got spicy tunaAny additional things cost $0.50 eachThe whole meal was super satisfying and definitely worth the price (total was about $14 after tax) - it's a HUGE portion especially when you compare it to NYC where you'll get half the amount of food and pay probably close to $20.Will definitely come back again!
2018-03-30,5,THE BEST poke bowl I've ever had. Don't listen to the reviews saying it's pricey. I've easily gotten poke bowls for more than $15 for half the size and toppings. You get double the  portion for the same price as those bougie poke places in the city. Always fresh and tasty. An amazing addition to Hoboken!
2018-03-29,2,I had high hopes for this place.  I've walked past it a few times around lunchtime and today I figured would be a good time to order since it's rainy out.The pork has a nice char on it but doesn't taste like it was marinated at all.  It is a much bigger piece of pork than is normally given in a ramen though so that was good.The egg arrived over-cooked and un-marinated (the over-cooked part I'll let slide because it was delivered to my office). The noodles were a little too al dente and were so stuck together that I couldn't use chopsticks to coax them apart. That being said, they were tasty noodles although not the type of noodle I'm used to eating with ramen.Since when does a ramen NOT come with fish cake? I like fish cake so it was missed. They also managed to forget the nori :( The broth was just ok which is sad because it's arguably what makes the dish.I expected a HECK of a lot more from a $20 bowl of ramen.
2018-03-28,5,Awesome food, drinks, and service. Large portions for a good price. Very chill. They don't rush you out or stress you with constant visitation. Service is "just right".
2018-03-26,2,The ramen was average tasting. The soup and the toppings werelukewarm and bland. If I had to describe it further, I'd say it's like going over to your friend's house for a okay home cooked meal. But since this is a restaurant, I expected so much more flavor. The quantity of the meal was very good though. I wasn't able to finish the entire bowl of ramen. Last, the prices were on the pricey side. All in all, I've experienced better.
2018-03-25,5,Absolutely amazing ramen and poké. The price is high but you certainly get what you pay for. IMHO they have the best ramen and poké in all of Hoboken. Their serving size is probably the greatest of all Hoboken restaurants as well. Ramen-wise, this is the best ramen I've had in my life. Granted, I haven't eaten much ramen before this, and every time I've had it before I've not really enjoyed it. Suddenly I come to South Street and I absolutely cant stop until I'm at the bottom of the massive bowl. Their selection is large enough to come here every day for a week and still not have tried all the ramens.As far as their poké: fantastic. Immensely generous in their serving size and ingredient selection (just handing out avocado as if it were an inexpensive ingredient), the flavor and quality are top notch. Their suggested combinations are fantastic but you can also make a custom bowl or sushi-burrito if you want. As far as I know they're the only place in Hoboken serving proper high quality ramen. Their poké price is similar to its competitors but they give you roughly twice as much food. Can't be beat! Only one comment: if you order ramen from them you'll only get about 2/3 the food you do when dining in, I assume due to difficulty finding disposable containers big enough to fit all the food.
2018-03-25,3,4.0 Stars for Poke Bowl2.5 Stars for RamenPoke Bowl: for the base, they offer "forbidden rice" which is very similar to the Korean mix grain rice and I absolutely love it. They have variety of unique toppings and they give generous portions of toppings. We tried "spicy tuna" bowl twice. In my opinion, it has an "Americanized" twist as the avocado is guacamole (huh?) but it works!  I do recommend their poke bowls and I have yet to try their sushi-rrito. Ramen: My friends did not recommend their ramen but we decided to give it a try anyways. We ordered Tokyo Soy Ramen and Original Ton Tan Ramen. Boy... the noodle and broth taste like packaged ramen that you would find in the refrigerated section of Asian grocery. The onion topping is RAW - not parcook, plain raw! The egg is very good but it was cold, not even lukewarm. The pork was the only thing good about it but at $13-14, each bowl came with one piece of pork. Overall, this place is slightly pricey for what they offer. I do recommend their poke bowls but I recommend to steer clear of their ramen.
2018-03-25,4,Delish pho. Got the hot and spicy Ramon. Although the price point is a little high, should be around 10 or 11 instead of 14-17. For 15 bucks, many other options around Hbkn for a more hearty lunch.
2018-03-25,4,Colorful healthy mix of fresh deliciousness! Half/half bowl with kale and forbidden rice bad  Great taste and good price. Cute, clean interior and good customer service.
2018-03-23,4,I would give it 3.5* if I could. I tried the Tuna and Salmon looking for a change from Sashimi. Its fine.  I would have liked more flavor in the other ingredients to become a regular. The interiors are fine. Casual sit-down place. Like most others at Hoboken.
2018-03-18,5,From Bergenfield to Hoboken --- def worth the travel! We had the Tokyo Soy Ramen and a customized Poke Bowl and boy, it was one of the finest Ramen I've tried this year! The place is good for kids, group and family. It's also clean. It is a bit pricey but worth it!
2018-03-18,5,I walked by this place a few weeks ago and was excited to see this new addition to Hoboken. Ramen and poke are my two favorite foods! So yesterday I decided to try their poke bowl. I ordered make your own poke bowl with fresh Salmon, spicy tuna, guacamole, red cabbage, kale and edamame topped with poke sauce. The portion was huge and was nicely placed in a to go container. I was able to carry it on with me on my long flight to Vancouver. It was fresh and delicious! Absolutely loved! I can't wait to try their ramen!
2018-03-17,3,Mediocre fish quality and was not cheap. Ramen was also not very rich flavor. Not sure how it gets such high ratings but Hoboken has lots of other better placed
2018-03-14,5,Wow first time I had a sushi burrito !!!amazing!!place is friendly cool and clean . Great service .
2018-03-13,5,My husband picked me up a poke bowl from here for dinner. He made his own with spicy salmon and ahi tuna. It was very generous portions. I could not finish it in one sitting. Definitely get your moneys worth. Such an interesting concept to put a poke with ramen. Definitely want to check out how their ramen is.
2018-03-12,4,This is a very good spot for ramen, the food is delicious and I like the laidback atmosphere. I would say my only real critique would be the noodles, just tasted different than some other ramens but I'm not sure if it was because it was the vegetarian option. Still good though! The make your own sushi burrito was baller and I HIGHLY suggest the crab salad option! Overall awesome experience! Can't wait to go back!
2018-03-11,5,Best ramen in Hoboken. What I like the best is the soup is not too salty or oily like lots other ramen places. But a bit pricey for weekday lunch....
2018-03-11,1,1st & last time here! If u do not eat swine DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE! I specifically said NO PORK! After waiting 15-20 mins for my food to go n having 2 different ppl come up to me with the wrong order I was annoyed to then get home to finally eat & I get urine smelling ramen bowl I'm disgusted and beyond pist!
2018-03-09,5,Best ramen place in Hoboken. I ordered South Street Ramen and it tasted so delicious! They gave a pretty good amount of seafood. Cheese powder melted in the soup....Yummy!
2018-03-05,4,*a bit on the pricey side*Build your own poke bowl for $11 (1 protein for $11; 2 proteins for $13, 4 toppings, 2 dressings, 2 crunchy toppings)Good hearty portionsSeat yourself sit down fast food spotComplimentary cucumber water and lime waterThe staff here clears your table after you get up to leave
2018-03-05,5,Wow, definitely recommend this place to anyone that's a fan of sushi and ramen. The place and atmosphere is very clean, trendy, and chill. I ordered fire chili miso ton men, on a heat scale it's 5 out of 10, if you like spicy food. Also got the south street special sushi burrito and it was delicious. This place is super filling and the price is reasonable. Note: Not related to the restaurant. All ramen to me has that wet dog smell, if you have the same weird sense of smell, then ask to not include bamboo in your .
2018-03-04,4,This could be one of the best Ramen house in Hoboken. The chicken stock soup is delicious.
2018-02-27,5,I've eaten here twice now-- The first time, I got the build-your-own-bowl, and I was amazed at how many options there were. The second time, I got the miso ramen, and that was great, too. Definitely one of my new favorite places in Hoboken.
2018-02-27,5,Cosy spot for a nice meal in Hoboken not far from the path on 2nd and Washington. The poké special and the ramen bowls were both delicious and the portions were large. We tried the strawberry and mango aloe milk drinks that went great with the entrees too! Will definitely be back for more!
2018-02-25,5,Ordered  the hot spicy ramen to go and it is just as amazing as it looks! Both my friend and i loved the flavor. The pulled pork was a great touch.
2018-02-22,5,I recommend the South Street Special, i did half kale & half forbidden rice as the base. Loved it. Best Poke I've had in a while.   My boyfriend had the same thing and loved it too.  Neither of us could finish the large portions and we were happy to enjoy the leftovers for lunch the next day.  We'll be back.  Minor 2-cent suggestion for manager is maybe make the outdoor seating nicer ? 1 table and it was rocking back and forth and unstable.
2018-02-22,4,Tried here when I got too lazy to walk up the street to another poke place and the wife wanted to try the ramen anyway. Wife absolutely loved her ramen and will be making this a regular place for her.Poke was very good as well, although I asked for tuna and got spicy tuna, just learned to be more clear on ordering. Otherwise very delicious and fresh. Staff was also very friendly and service was very quick.
2018-02-22,5,Wow! I had the South Street Special poke bowl and it was amazing! I've actually had it twice now. It is a combo of all the delicious fish, which was super fresh and firm. It's a huge portion, probably 2 meals, but I suffered and ate it all at once. Very nice service and fun environment!
2018-02-21,5,Just discovered this and the ramen here is good, it feels more authentic than vivi cafe but a couple dollars more expensive. It's a much nicer sit down restaurant than vivi cafe and they don't skimp in the noodles. I had the original but substituted chicken for the braised pork and boyfriend had vegetable miso, which was also quite tasty, will come again and order delivery!
2018-02-19,5,Best ramen and poke bowls in Hoboken. A little on the pricey side but delicious and very friendly staff.
2018-02-18,5,Hoboken finally has a reliable ramen shop! Went for the first time today and got the delicious miso ramen. Braised pork was tender and flavorful. Broth was rich. Noodles were fresh and filling. My wife had a salmon poke bowl - also very good. Thrilled to have this place nearby.
2018-02-17,5,Came in here with my boyfriend on Valentines day and it already seemed to have a healthy lunch crowd going.  We got the miso ramen, hot and spicy ramen, and extra noodles.  I customized my miso ramen and replaced the pork with chicken (originally I asked for an extra egg to replace it and the guy at the counter politely asked if I'd want chicken which I didn't realize was an option).  Both ramen bowls came in maybe 6-10 mins and they were so tasty.  The chicken in mine was definitely more of a grilled chicken kind of texture (no grill marks) and was plain but perfect for the soup.  The broth made kale actually taste good and the broth comes with a whole boiled egg (mine was more medium boiled than soft but that's fine!)My boyfriend isn't a ramen eater normally and got dragged along for this excursion. He liked the hot and spicy which is definitely hot and spicy for my tastes.  It was good though in that you still get flavor and not deathly heat which burns your tastebuds off. He likes spicy broth just not the greens and seaweed and the mix ins except for the egg and meat... so he thought he needed extra noodles. He didn't- but we did have bubble tea beforehand which was probably the real mistake.  Needless to say- you should be easily able to get filled up by a ramen bowl here without add-ons if you're averagely hungry. I got 2/3 of the way through mine and we guess that he finished his bowl and like 1/3 or 1/4 of the noodles before he tapped out and while I am small he is more than twice my size (sorry but that's the honest truth).
2018-02-16,5,The Champion Ramen Bowl is legit! Rich flavorful pork broth teeming with many assorted delicious sea delicacies (octopus, fish cake, seaweed, beef!) and of course great ramen. Yum!
2018-02-15,3,Decent ramen. Can't speak for their poke. Proportions are skewed in the ramen. I would like a little more broth and less noodle. Loses points for proportions and most importantly price. $13-$17 for a bowl of ramen is outrageous even in Hoboken. I've had much better ramen in the area and in NYC for less. Ramen and poke craze is over...time to get to the prices that others are charging.
2018-02-13,5,Came in for lunch with a small group.  Finally a real ramen place in Hoboken.  We all ordered the ramen rather than poke.  I had the traditional pork ramen with extra noodles and extra pork because I was starving.  I like to rate ramen based on noodles, broth, and quality of pork.  Broth: delicious and savory, appropriately heavy and thick.  Pork bone based.  A little too oily but the flavour was great.Noodles: definitely more aldente.  Kind of hard but soften upon serving.  I think this is preferable to mushy noodles but does mean that if you order extra you gotta add those noodles quick before the broth coolsPork: amazing.  Super tender and they are quite generous with it.All in all this place was awesome and my wallet will definitely hate me for how often I want to return
2018-02-12,5,Ramen was fantastic! Broth was amazing. I will be returning. Looking forward to their "fancy sign",  but I'll take the simple sign for now and their killer ramen.
2018-02-02,5,Very good ramen, friendly staff..a welcome addition to Hoboken. A bit expensive for the area, but the portions are big
2018-01-31,4,IMPORTANT: They give you a WHOLE EGG in your ramen. So many ramen place give half an egg and I was pleasantly surprised to receive a full one with my soup. Their pork ramen is delicious. Their pork broth has a very tasty flavor. The staff are polite and helpful and looking for criticism, so if you don't like something feel free to tell them and help them improve their business. Prices are more or less what you'd expect for ramen in the greater nyc area. I'll be going back to try their seafood.
2018-01-29,4,Brand new and a great Ramen spot in Hoboken, the staff was very friendly on their opening day, they take cash/credit and my favorite has to be the champon king men bowl which has this amazing pork stock and contains braised pork, fish cake , calamari, shrimp, baby scallops, kikurage (a japanese mushroom aka the wood ear  , great anti-flammatory effect and alleviate cold symptoms), bamboo, onion, cabbage & bean sprouts which costs $17 and you can also add extra items, I always add the marinated egg and spicy pulled pork which is to die for, would definitely go back and plenty of space for groups or kid, enjoy!
2018-01-28,5,This place just opened and I wanted to try their ramen, I'm glad I did! Finally a good ramen place in Hoboken, no more having to travel back to the city
