2021-10-23,4,Not as tight as I thought it would be. There is seating for the most part inside and out. The workers are super pleasant and the coffee ? TASTY AF
2021-10-16,5,Always great roasts. Always consistent flavors. Always kind staff.  What more could you want?
2021-09-23,1,Will is a deuce bag. Calls me out randomly Today (9/23/21) in front of everyoneWill: you can't sit here and not buy anything.Me: I did, I bought a large chai latte earlier. Will: no you didn't I've been here all day. Me: Here take my card and check the transactions in your system.Will: I am not gonna run your card. Anyways... attaching my receipt of purchase from earlier today, for your reference -- Will, deucebag.PS: I liked this chain and the owner Tats is good people. I've given them a LOT of business since over 4 years.
2021-09-02,5,Excellent espresso based drinks. Cool atmosphere. Local art on the wall for sale is strangely expensive. Who is going to pay $1000 for a 14x11 painting in a coffee shop? Anyway, great place.
2021-08-21,5,I had a wonderful experience with my partner. Place is really nicely decorated and a great stop on that hot dayWe got the lavender lemonade and chai latte.I've tried a lot of floral based drinks (rose/lavender etc.) where the flower tasted way too strong, but their lemonade was really good and well balanced. Would definitely suggest, the lavender gave it a nice colour and bitterness to balance it out.Chai latte was really good, not as iconic as their lemonade but it really good. If you want a small kick without coffee I'd definitely recommend it.
2021-08-09,5,Got the lavender lemonade on a very hot day and it turned out to be exactly what i needed. so refreshing and delicious! My friend got the iced chai latte (not pictured) and it had the perfect amount of spices! drinks are just as nice as the interior haha the place looked very clean and they had some really cute merch you could purchase as well! We ended up sitting outside on the little bench right by the door and it was really relaxing. would definitely come back for more drinks and da vibes
2021-07-19,5,Solely a space for coffee and pastries, they also have cool oatmeal and hold locally sourced ice cream from another vendor. They have a lot of cool merchandise. Also partnered with other vendors in the jersey, New York area. One I really like is the bees knees honey. The bwe tote bags and stickers are absolutely adorable too. They even carry solid soap and mist sprays!
2021-07-17,4,This is a GREAT spot if you're looking to hunker down and get some work done while sipping on great coffee. This is also a great spot if you are looking to grab and go with a matcha latte, cold brew or a different specialty coffee drink. Anddddd, with all of the additional outdoor seating they have, it's pretty perfect for sitting and hanging out for a bit. They always had a few tables but set up a parklet with a few more seats this past year. I usually get their matcha lattes with added vanilla because they make them super well and there is never any matcha powder clumps. On my last visit, I asked for a recommendation from the barista and ordered the lavender cold brew latte. Delicious! And refreshing and the perfect caffeinated treat. It was sweet and so tasty and I hope they still have it the next time I drop by. The shop is super cute and has plenty of seating. I stopped by on a Tuesday afternoon and it was filled with people on laptops studying and working. They have shelves and shelves of goods, candles, coffee makers and all things for a trendy home. I did think about getting a fun and wonky looking candle but it was a little outside of my price range. Still, I'll be back for coffees and teas every once and awhile!
2021-07-13,5,While we were visiting Hoboken we were recommended to check out this little coffee shop. I am so glad we decided to give it a try. The staff is super friendly and have amazing personalities. They actually were very helpful by giving us some direction on how to cross over to the city. The coffee was delicious. You have to give the chai coffee a try. I loved how cozy and cute the coffee shop was. I wish I had more time in Hoboken so I can give everything on their menu a try LOL. I love how they offered Oat milk as an option. Delicious coffee in my personal coffee loving opinion.
2021-06-26,3,A cozy cafe on Washington St. right in front of Elysian Cafe.Small but heavy traffic .... people in & out ordering coffee.The 3 of us had cortado ... @3.25 ... quite good [But, I definitely prefer the cortado from Frisson @ Hell's Kitchen in the city].Cortado of bwe was of small portion.Not at all enough for me.I was still craving more.
2021-04-12,5,Top three reasons why you should make Bwe your staple coffee shop3. Efficient and friendly service plus nice outdoor dining area with really short waiting time for tables 2. I thought their lattes were rich and yummy and then I tried their Genmaicha tea with oat milk - heaven! 1. Prime dog-petting area with a lot of neighborhood puppers on stroll
2021-01-14,5,their caramel syrup is so good, my coffee-hating boyfriend like their latte bc the syrup was so good!
2021-01-01,4,Cute little coffee shop in Hoboken with delicious seasonal varieties. We tried the spicy mocha and black sesame latte today and both were SO good, I'm still thinking about them 5 hours later.  They also have an order ahead option, where you can just walk up and pick up your order behind a sliding window.
2020-12-10,5,I had their almond milk latte and was very pleased. Great flavor, very smooth, and the energy boost was impressive. The gluten free options are a plus. Very pleasant and friendly staff. Option to order ahead online and pick-up.
2020-11-25,5,After visiting the Adam's St. location we heard from some regulars that we had to check out their cafe on Washington as well and it was well worth the short drive.  Definitely add it to your cafe tour of Hoboken/Jersey City. This location has different vibes, but also really great hospitality/coffee. The socially-distanced line stretched out of the cafe, but the baristas kept everything running smooth as silk, and you could tell everyone was excited to grab a fresh cup to start their Saturday.Tough to decide which Bwe location is my favorite. Their team is doing a great job.
2020-11-21,2,Only a place that charges 4.50 for a coffee could employ people that wear hammer and sickle and Bernie sanders paraphernalia. I don't know why the Venn diagram of coffee servers and misguided virtue signaling are a perfect circle but this place is a parody of itself. Great coffee beans and nice owners but beyond woke.
2020-10-25,2,Don't come here if you're in a hurry. Or if you want coffee. We waited over 30 minutes and gave them our order twice. They gave us coffee then yelled at us that it was not ours so we asked for our money back and got shorted. Another lady who came up had ordered online 20 mins ago, got an alert that it was ready, and nothing was there. Shit show
2020-09-25,4,total fan - great coffee - quaint little spot with now outdoor seating and they have GLUTEN FREE stuff!
2020-08-29,5,Very good coffee. Got a latte from here though- didn't sleep for two days. Their coffee kept me up and energized lol.
2020-03-07,5,I have been coming to bwé for over a year now and I love it! I have tried a handful of this drinks and it's top notch. Love the space as well, great ambiance. By far my favorite coffee shop in Hoboken! Smooth great tasting espresso and fresh baked goods that all are great tasting!
2020-03-05,5,This is my favorite coffee shop in Hoboken. Service is fast and friendly. There are a lot of study tables, and the decor is hip and cozy. It has a Brooklyn vibe and there are a lot of young people who work from here on the weekends.
2020-02-26,5,Oh bwe - how do I love thee, let me count the ways! This is my favorite coffee shop on the east coast, if not ever! Actually yes, favorite coffee shop ever!! I used to stop in all the time when I lived in Hoboken and have even spent some time doing work at the communal table on the weekends. Aside from the delicious drinks and treats and the EXCELLENT service, the vibe here is just so relaxing, cozy and lovable - it feels like a community. I love all the different events they offer as well! I never made it when I lived nearby but part of me wants to venture back across the Hudson to check some of them out and revisit this little piece of heaven.This past weekend, I had the opportunity to check out the uptown location on Adams (I don't see a yelp page for that one yet, so I will review it here). Amazing! My friend and I met for a coffee and quick breakfast before going to climb nearby. The spot is just as charming as Washington Street and I was happy to see it equally buzzing with folks catching up or getting some work done. I decided to try one of the vegan lattes and went with the turmeric option - heaven in a mug for sure! I cannot wait to go back for another one! My friend got the avocado toast which came with a small salad - it looked delicious! The bread here is so yummy. Despite it being packed, we didn't want too long to grab 2 spots at the high bar by the window. Truly the perfect spot to catch up with friends or do some work. I could not love this place more and am convincing my friends we should venture to Hoboken twice a month to hang here... while also begging the folks at bwe to open a spot in the city!
2020-02-01,5,All the employees are so nice and friendly! Love the vegan bakery items. The PB&J bar is delicious.
2020-01-23,5,Love this place so much. It kind of feels like a Williamsburg, BK coffee shop because of the decor and vibe. There really isn't another coffee shop quite like bwe in Hoboken. The prices are unbeatable and the coffee is really good. I've never been disappointed with my coffee or experience here. Also a great place to sit with your laptop and do work but since it's always busy, it's quite hard to get a table.
2019-12-08,5,By far the coolest, most cheerful coffee cafe in town. The service is fast and friendly. Coffee is excellent. And the homemade sandwhiches (avocado!) are the best ever.
2019-11-30,4,Great little neighborhood hang. Coffee is pretty good and they make a good Cortado. By the way, that's how I measure your coffeeness. a) Is it on the menu?  b) Is it made well?So, yes to both of those. Then I look around the room and see if the folks in the room are cooler than me - check.Bonus points if there is anyone in the room talking to themselves - BONUS!
2019-11-14,5,I didn't have the coffee but the mango juice recommended by the barista. It was amazing! It seriously tasted like they just squeezed the juice of of the mango into the cup. I'm going back to get there coffee!!
2019-11-12,4,We stopped in bwé October 11 to try their coffee. I love that they have gluten free and vegan options for snacks. The coffee menu is easy to read. They have dairy alternatives, which I love! We ordered our usual, latte with almond milk. The two gentlemen working were knowledgeable and helpful. Great service! Fast and friendly. The lattes were on our top of tier two. So it was good, but we've had better. It's not bad though! Prices are average for Hoboken.
2019-11-08,4,Such a cute little coffee shop. This place was highly recommended by a friend so I had to try it out. It was packed at 6pm on a weekday. Seems like an awesome place to study or chat with friends. It's not loud or distracting to others studying. I was greeted right away when I walked in. Loved the milk alternatives soy/almond/oat (just wish places stop charging so much or charging at all for alternatives). I tried the almond milk vanilla latte and it was perfectly made. Didn't need to add sugar. Loved every sip and I had chocolate chip cookie as well. The cookie was yummy, not fantastic (meaning for me it wasnt a melt in your mouth cookie), but yummy.
2019-10-26,5,Hey hey hey, your favorite reviewer is back-All what was left was a Half eaten carrot cake and a mug from cutest bakery in Hoboken. Pour over coffee made me feel exclusive AF, they don't serve this beyond the wall so +.5 for that. Also, chai latte served in an elusive white cup. Music selection had me feeling all the vibes. Definitely recommend this place. PS. If you take a piece of the mural (tape) major SHAME!
2019-09-30,5,Best coffee shop in Hoboken! Great staff, delicious coffee. Always a line because it's the best
2019-08-24,5,A great place to grab a cup of coffee or a snack in the morning. There are plenty of places to sit and take advantage of their free wifi or you can just grab your coffee and go.
2019-08-01,5,I couldn't decided between chicory cold brew & ice tea.  Ended up getting an iced green tea that was so pure & refreshing! My friend got an oat milk caramel latte and it was the best latte I've ever tasted. In addition the vibe was so calm.  Especially impressed by the wide selection of children's books. Family friendly.
2019-07-24,5,This cafe is great for studying/getting work done. Good quality drinks and the staff is friendly. There's a decent amount of seating, too: you can sit at tables, at the window, or in comfy mini easy chairs by the front. They also have a good amount of outlets to plug in laptops/phone chargers. Not too pricey and very cute inside!
2019-07-15,5,BWE OG. Hoboken is a better place thanks​ to Bwe. Best coffee, community, ​and experience​ from Boken to BKLYN. If you are on here reading reviews you are wasting valuable Bwe time.
2019-07-04,5,Cute cafe with a cool ambience also their chai latte and ice matcha latte is really good. Highly recommend
2019-06-26,5,Everyone's really nice here, and the prices are really really amazing! They have oat milk, which I love, and their coffee is wonderful, not that weird sour stuff that nice coffee places sometimes have. Bring your own cup and they'll give you a 10 cent discount!
2019-06-24,5,Nice customer service, good coffee.  Also a really great place to work.  A pleasant environment which also plays good music.
2019-06-20,5,Stunning blend of drip coffee with just the right coffee aroma. Amazing loose leaf tea - I can mix two types of teas because they make tea bags on the spot. Most importantly, this place is always buzzing with a lively and positive vibe! I can chill here with a book. I can chit chat with friends here. I can work here. TWO bathrooms, both kept very clean, which I really appreciate after seeing too many gross bathrooms in Manhattan's coffee shops.
2019-06-06,5,Grabbed a coffee here before walking to the River.  Friendly, diverse crowd and good atmosphere. Coffee was great.
2019-05-11,5,Very nice Cafe! It was nice n quiet. What I was expecting. Had my favorite draft latte!
2019-05-04,5,My favorite coffee joint in Hoboken . Lots of caffeine ( and tea) choices with just the right amount of food choices. Friendly , casual service and plenty of seating to work or relax including outdoor benches. The sound level is low too , which is great to work from ( other than the occasional dumbass on their phone ) Get the avocado sandwich !
2019-04-12,5,Awesome place to grab a cup of coffee, or a cup of their cold brew to cool off on a warm day
2019-03-26,5,I've been to bwe many times because their lattes are delightful and they always have multiple dairy free alternatives which is always a win in my book. Today, I got a pb&j bar and it was so gooey and delicious! I read a review that there was not enough jelly, but I'm a peanut butter gal and the ratio was perfect for my liking. The Cafe is quaint, always buzzing with friends catching up and friendly staff serving you with a smile. If all of that isn't enough to love this place, read their mission and all the wonderful things their owner Maryanne is doing and your heart will be stolen!
2019-03-06,5,Really fantastic place! Anything less than 5 stars is downright picky and unnecessary. Best coffee spot in hoboken by a long shot
2019-02-24,4,Fantastic cappuccinos and corados, and warm staff. I fell in love w/ Bwe the first time I went there the month it opened. Now, I'm back in Hoboken after all these years and find that it is one of Hoboken's fav spot for coffee.. unsurprisingly. Bwe serves high quality caps and cortados, and has a decent pastry spread. On warm days, it is nice to sit outside and people watch, but it is often too crowded. Oh, clean bathrooms as well.
2019-01-02,4,Decided to check out bwe based on all the reviews here on Yelp. It's a lovely coffee shop in the heart of Hoboken. I enjoyed my almond cappuccino very much. The place was packed though and there was only outside seating available (in 40 degree December weather!) We didn't mind sitting outside to get some fresh air and enjoy a few rays of sunshine. Will probably be back here again soon.
2018-12-30,4,It has fun environment, good to get a coffee and sit down with a friend or two. However it doesn't have too many spots to sit for a bigger group. Coffee is ok, however their cappuccino is much better then drip coffee compear with other coffee shops around.
2018-12-01,5,Definitely my favorite café in Hoboken, the atmosphere is so cute and quaint. I have only ever gotten the mocha latte, but I have never been disappointed. Though it gets pretty busy during the morning commute, they're very quick with their service and always serve you with a smile.
2018-11-04,4,So cozy place to go for a coffee in Hoboken. It's a place where u can hangout with friends and u can study while shipping a coffee. The best thing is they have such a cozy beautiful place. I love their coffee and everyone else love too
2018-11-03,5,bwè is the absolute go to coffee shop in all of Hoboken. The taste and quality of the coffee is always dynamite and always consistent. A true neighborhood spot with great ambiance and space - for meeting up with friends, or just to sit down on your laptop and get work done. The staff is always super friendly and provides phenomenal service. For a small town with tons of coffee shops bwè kafe is the best of the best and local favorite for sure.
2018-10-22,5,I stayed a week with my son in Union City. We walked down to bwè kafe everyday. Their cold brew was amazing. My son enjoyed their Flat White. It was the same every time. The pastries were also yummy. Service with a smile and sitting at the bar facing the street was always a treat. I love visiting Hoboken!
2018-10-19,5,Evan and Dale, the owners of BWE are incredibly friendly and generous. They recently donated coffee and pastries for a party that I hosted to raise funds for a local non-profit that sends at-risk youth to college, called "New City Kids." All of the guests loved the refreshments and plan to frequent BWE Kafe. Thank you, Evan and Dale!
2018-10-08,5,I first encountered this place several years ago via a Yelp search when I realized it was created to support Haitin causes and mentioned it to my then Haitian coworker. Since I then lived on the other side of town, it wasn't until I moved nearby that I started frequenting it.The cafe has a pretty industrial design but small touches of art and a book shelf manage to make it feel welcoming and cozy. The have several wooden tables, often occupied by patrons on their laptops and some more seating that faces the street. The cafe is much less gloomy than other "high end" coffee places as it's usually pretty sun drenched due to the glass windows leading into it. It also has a small outdoor seating area which they use in the warmer months.I've been here when the line is quite long and yet it went by pretty quickly.  The baristas manage to be friendly while still preparing your drink of choice in a timely manner. In the rare times I had to wait for some time, I didn't mind it because this place has relaxing qualities to it.As for the drinks themselves, while I am not a coffee person I am a big hot chocolate one. I limit my hot chocolate consumption as I try to stay healthy so whenever I do indulge myself, I make sure it's done with a high quality product. Bwe Kafe has some of the best hot chocolate I've had, you can simply tell that it was made with high quality ingredients (and also with some love). I have tried some ice coffee drinks here as well and they are also consistently good. They do have the punch card which is a great idea, even if I too often forget to bring it in.This is undoubtedly one of Hoboken's gems, may it have a very long life.
2018-10-06,5,Glat white is really good, best in the city so far. I think it the only place in town which has good coffee some quick bites and plenty of space to work or study. Love their interior as well
2018-10-04,5,Great coffee! The first time I went there I was a little confused on the coffee types and how to order but the staff was extremely friendly and helpful! They don't have decaf iced coffee but they do have decaf espresso they can make an iced americano if you dont drink caffeine!
2018-08-18,5,Best iced coffee and great friendly staff!  High quality coffee used. laColombe. Nice environment will be back again
2018-08-10,5,Grab one of their punch cards to collect stamps for a free drink! This is my favorite coffee shop in the area. My favorite part is that they have coffee that is strong enough for my taste. It's local and a lot of people drop by for quality, staple coffee that's cheaper than Starbucks. This place is always pretty crowded though so it's a little hard to hang out here. Definitely drop by here if you're interested in a good, classic coffee.
2018-07-29,5,Fantastic coffee, cozy atmosphere and some GF treats. Try to snag a table outside if you can!
2018-07-15,5,Great place. Wish they had oat milk but overall the coffee is strong and the service is good.
2018-06-29,4,Great cold brew.  First 3' 24hr Japanese cold drip glass tower I've seen in Hoboken (see pic).  Didn't try pastries, not big selection but probably most would find something they like. Place was crowded, but still comfortable with plenty of seats and plugs for all those hard at work on electronic devices.  Friendly baristas
2018-06-28,5,My favorite cappuccino in town:)  lovely little coffee shop. Great music. Great place to meet friends for coffee!!
2018-05-24,1,Ok tea, but worst coffee shop staff I have ever experienced.   Tons of other coffee shops in Hoboken now, I'd rather go to those.
2018-04-26,5,I love it here.  The baristas are always very friendly and the cappocinnos are devine. There's a smell of freshly ground coffee that's so beautiful, I often sit here for hours doing work.  Usually it's pretty crowded but in a quiet and calming way.  There's plants and interesting decor covering the place; it's an oasis. Aside from the coffee being amazing (everything from their iced coffee to their cortados) the place is perfect to get work done and relax. My favorite coffee place in Hoboken!
2018-04-03,4,Truly delicious chai lattes and a comfy place to hang out for a bit.  It's not super quiet but the drinks are worth it.  Definitely worth stopping in for your morning brew or a quality pick me up on the weekend.  Not sure what bwè means or even how to pronounce it but trust me; go with it and you won't be disappointed.
2018-03-01,5,I would say it's the first choice coffee shop in Hoboken for a lot hobokener. They don't have their own coffee beans. They used La Columbe coffee roaster from Philadelphia for the choice of coffee beans which is one of my favorite coffee roasters. This place is pretty laid back and always crowded. Even when they're so busy, they never lose patience to the customers. It's a perfect coffee shop for the small town.
2018-02-28,5,Got a chai latte with oat milk. So delicious! Also got the PBJ bar and that was really good too. Customer service is outstanding def recommend this place for a coffee stop. I've been here plenty of times and their coffee is really good. There's always people reading/doing work on the computer here. They have WiFi
2018-02-10,5,Love this place! Coffee & PBJ bar = the best. Great place to get work done too! Amazing atmosphere with cool happy people :)
2018-01-14,1,I was so excited to try this place for the first time but they are Lucky that I'm giving this place 1 star, and that's only because it's cute inside. When I went to order the girl at the counter asked us twice what we wanted and then while she was getting the orders asked us again what we wanted. Like hello, pen and paper. I asked for banana bread, girl gave me the wrong bread then switched it to a small burnt end piece (that tasted stale too). Also ordered a chocolate croissant there was one little piece of chocolate at the end of the croissant the rest was plain. Your paying for small and unappetizing pastries.
2017-12-12,5,I had been to the bwè kafe many times, thrilled that they were serving bold coffee courtesy of La Colombe Torrefaction.  However, my most recent trip stood out enough to write a review, because I decided to sample a new beverage - their Chai Tea Latte.  I asked if it was made from a sugary mix or a teabag, to which I was told that it was actually an organic mix that was sweetened by molasses.  I was also given the option to add as much of the concentrate as I wanted.  Well, they got the balance between the mix and my requested almond milk just perfect on the first attempt.  The creamy beverage was kissed with a light sweetness, but also possessed a variety of spices, such as ginger and clove.  I had found my new go-to seasonal, hot beverage! I also need to add a quick note about how cozy this café, or rather "kafe", really is.  It offered several types of tables, including a counter at each side, and a quiet, relaxing atmosphere.  Bwè was such a successful gem that they opened a second location in Jersey City.  This was truly a great spot for doing work or enjoying quality time over a steaming mug.
2017-12-01,4,Convenient local coffee shop with an excellent Washington steet location in Hoboken. Small and cozy seating indoors. Nice place to sit with friends for a coffee meet up.
2017-11-05,2,I was excited when BWE first opened, Hoboken had a cool coffee shop at last. Fast forward to today and although the decor is lovely, they have Fair Trade coffee that tastes good, and the staff are pretty quick and efficient I never go there. The place is taken over by people who buy one coffee and sit for hours taking up a whole table with laptops and notebooks. I refuse to buy coffee somewhere if I can't stay to sit and enjoy it which has happened more than once. Very often the trash cans and surrounding area are overflowing and dirty, and more than once there's been a vase of dead flowers complete with stagnant water on the counter - little things like this make me wonder about the overall cleanliness of a place...
2017-11-01,5,My almond milk latte was perfect the place is so cozy I felt like I could nap there if I didn't drink a caffeinated drink....the baristas are kind and personable this will definitely be a favorite spot from now on. It didn't hurt that her latte art skills were on point:)
2017-10-20,5,My latte was excellent. I usually OD on sugar but I didn't need any. Staff was friendly, great atmosphere.
2017-09-11,4,I like the coffee and service a lot. The no wifi on the weekends is a bit of a bummer and the parking can be challenging since you have to feed a meter and it maxes out at 1-hour. But I still really like it here and I go and use my hotspot when I'm in the neighborhood.
2017-08-06,3,Delicious coffee but not a lot of pastry/breakfast items to choose from. Bought a muffin which wasn't that great. Cute decor and friendly staff. Would go back but it's nothing special.
2017-07-29,5,Bwè has the nicest, coolest staff. They use La Colombe coffee; best mocha in Hoboken. Gluten-free PB&J bars are quite tasty, too!
2017-07-26,5,I stopped in here because yelp reviewers said they had gluten free friendly pastries and snacks. Which was true! I tried both their donuts and the pumpkin muffin. They were tasty, I'm not sure about the chocolate donut it wasn't my favorite but the pumpkin donut was nice, wondering if they change up their flavors. Their berry ice tea was refreshing and the prices were comparable with other cafe spots in the area. I'll be back to try some more of their GF treats if they have any other varieties!
2017-07-23,5,My personal favorite cafe in Hoboken. Coffee quality is outstanding, line moves quickly, trendy vibe both inside and outside the cafe, and the staff is just great.Free wifi and a great place to bring some work and sip on a latte. They have a couple locations now but this was the original spot. Saturday mornings are a bit hectic (as are most cafes) but again line moves pretty quickly and it's an overall pleasant experience.
2017-07-22,4,Lots of seating, parking up front, and not one but two bathrooms? This place was a nice quiet  place to study, with free wifi. I ordered an almond milk latte (my standard) and a Fage greek yogurt, total came up to be around $7 which is pretty normal. Service was prompt and friendly and the place was kept pretty clean. They have a bunch of baked good options but I came later in the afternoon so they seemed to be out of half of their items. So no croissant for me. Espresso in my latte was pretty strong, but seemed to give me a bit of a stomachache, which hasn't happened to me before, hence the one star off.
2017-06-09,5,Such an incredible kafe- everything here is delicious and the atmosphere is so cozy and inviting. I love that they are socially conscious here and do so much to give to the global community. Major plus that they have a variety of baked goods including vegan and gluten free. Love the owners so much!
2017-05-15,5,With Fair trade coffee, gluten free / vegan pastries, and a friendly staff, this is the best coffee shop in Hoboken. I also love all the art work which is from the villages in Haiti they support.
2017-04-22,5,How have I not written a yelp review for the place that helps me function everyday at work? Without my cup of caffeine, I would probably be incredibly unproductive at work! The Americano with soy is so smooth strong and amazing! Lately, I've been having the croissants too,because hey when you're pregnant, you just need a buttery rich treat at 8 am. Sad to say, I never really hung out at the coffee shop since I'm always running late but it's cute cozy and very inviting!
2017-04-01,5,Love it here! The staff is really personable and make a killer cup of coffee. It's super cozy to do some work or catch up with an old friend! If it weren't for my dogs, I'd probably enjoy my coffee at the cafe instead of on the run!
2017-03-08,5,Great Coffee!  Love the atmosphere.  Wish they had more food.  Usually when I go in the afternoons, the fresh sandwiches and snacks are pretty picked over.
2017-02-26,4,Let me preface this view by pointing out that I am NOT a coffee drinker.We sat outside (they can fit about 10 chairs) and I enjoyed the warm weather with a redeye coffee and a cheese biscuit. The caffeine was very, very, welcome. While I rarely drink coffee, I thought that this particular brew was pretty good, and everyone I know that frequents this cafe loves the coffee as well.Oh the biscuit was good too. Go for it!
2017-02-23,5,Great ambiance and lovely staff! The long line can be a turn off at times (when the dog is waiting outside) but they do their best to keep it moving. The music they play could be straight from my personal playlists - needless to say, I'm a fan!
2017-01-29,5,I have recently began spending more and more time in Hoboken and would always hear talk of bwé. I was so curious as to what this place was and went to it shortly after. The place is an instagrammer's dream. From white walls to artsy drinks to modern artwork, bwé is the place to be. Their hot chocolate is to die for and their coffee is often raved about. They have a large crowd who spend their time studying or working there. It is not noisy and the staff is just wonderful! They always greet you with a smile and a hello and are very thankful for your business. For the holiday season, they have put up wreathes which are for sale, as well as their artwork. I would recommend bwé kafe to anyone.
2017-01-27,5,I am in love with Bwe.  It helps that it's the closest coffee shop from my place (excluding starbucks), but I think I would still have a soft spot for it even if it were further (case in point, I've been several times to their JC location as well).  I don't know what it is about Bwe that I love so much - first it's the first cold brew I ever tried; it's also the first Japanese drip I tried.  I love the feel of this place - I love there are tables and chairs and you can hang.  I love the random music selections the staff plays.  I love the aspect of community they try to grow with the different events they put on as well as the physical bulletin board that anyone has access to post.  I love how they have showcased other products from other small business to sell in their store.  Bwe is doing so many things right!
2017-01-12,5,I had an oolong tea and red jacket juice. The service is really friendly and the cafe is too cute. Will be back to sit and stay for a while but overall friendly feel. Also love that they offer French classes :)
2016-12-29,5,This coffee shop is pretty much the epitome of the "cute coffee shop" image. It's very cozy, the décor is adorable, and it has a brightness that is just simply uplifting - likely associated with the white brick walls, cups, etc. I went with a couple friends, and while it was a tad cramped as it was peak lunchtime, we were still able to find a little corner of the café to talk. The place seems to always be filled with college students on their laptops - after all, it is right by the Stevens Institute - so if you're a really big group, don't expect to be able to fit everyone at one table/area. Other than that, the employees were super nice and the girl who rung me up was very sweet as well. As far as food, I only ordered the chai tea latté, so I can't say much on behalf of their bakery items - they did have a little glass case full of them - but the latté was good. Nothing fancy or outrageously delicious, but definitely good, and piping hot, if I might add. Was a good thing considering how cold it was when we went.Anyway, I definitely encourage you to give this place a try. I had an enjoyable albeit very brief experience, and I'm sure you will, too!
2016-12-03,1,Wish I can give them no star.Ok. They are open at 8am. I got there 7:56amThey gave me really bad attitude. I mean.. if I got there super early, I get it but it was 4mins earlier?! Don't understand how the cafe is not ready yet at 7:56 if they are open at 8.They seems no problem to make themself espresso drinks, make jokes but not ready to make a cup for the customer. Poor customer service. Never going back or recommad to anyone. Beside their coffee is not worth of waiting anyway.
2016-12-02,5,Awesome, trendy little spot in uptown Hoboken. I got a dirty chai with almond milk and it might be the best one I've ever had. Going back tomorrow to grab their matcha latte. Will update then!
2016-11-26,5,Coffee is great. Atmosphere is nice. Nice place to come down and chill. Can become a bit crowded - but def one of the best coffee spots in Hoboken
2016-11-03,4,I came here with my mom over the weekend during one of our morning strolls down Washington Street. I have to say the place inside is quite spacious for a cafe. They had lots of places to sit, and it seems like it's a great place to study (although I do find that the place gets seriously crowded with people on their laptops sometime after lunch).The coffee here is pretty good and the pastries they have on the side were definitely very tempting. So I expect that I will come back to this place to get more of both during a less hectic morning/afternoon.
2016-10-22,4,This place has great coffee in a cool relaxed setting. They certain know their stuff with coffee and the baristas are always very friendly. Only complaint is that they can run out of popular items (e.g. cold brew on a summer day) fairly early in the afternoon.
2016-10-06,5,A great local hoboken coffee shop. Whether I am stopping by for a cold brew, a hot coffee, breakfast , snacks/drinks for the kids, the atmosphere & service are always on point.  Also, Bwé is a great place to do work or have a meeting.
2016-09-09,1,Not a good neighbor. You need to monitor the space outside your door. There is only about three feet of passage and individuals are tying dogs and baby carriages blocking the way of passage. The fact that you have no fence around your outdoor area also creates a situation where the sidewalk space is further invaded and food is in open access to passers-by.
2016-08-17,5,Came here once on an awkward date that didn't work out like two years ago.  Long story short, this place was definitely the most memorable part- so when I was in Hoboken today I had to stop in and try it again.  Their iced americano was just as good as the hot one I got previously.  It was actually perfect. Good vibes too- they had some great music going. Definitely making Bwe Kafe a routine whenever I'm in Hoboken!
2016-08-09,4,it feels great when you walk into a coffee shop and, after taking the time to browse thru the beans, you engage in a great conversation with the barista about their beans and equip :^)bwe offers some of The Cheapest Goods with More-Than-Decent Quality i have seen around ever (not as cheap as fahrenheit up in toronto but really really close). i was so stunned i just stood there for a bit before asking for a cup of their kyoto iced coffeemadchill environment with plenty of small seating around, and two bathrooms! w h a t !! definitely a great spot within the heart of hoboken, receiving the heavy foot traffic that it deservekyoto iced coffee was maddecent. bold and strong, a great late-afternoon kick, using their la colombe coffee for water blend. i appreciate the decor of the place too--you can spot trinkets and statues of animals and hand-made cards from tokyo that really make this place comfy cozy. i wish i lived in the area to appreciate it more. keep it up bwe!
2016-07-20,4,I would be happier taping 5 stars, I love go to Bwè kafe to study, usually I stay there for more than 5 hours, good vibes, delicious coffee, nice people. But everything cannot be perfect! My 4 stars are because they don't have enough food (sandwich, salads...), and they do not allow you to bring food from other places around there.
2016-07-17,1,A waitress removed my laptop charger by herself without telling anything to anyone (in fact when I was watching her). I had a hard time to understand what she wanted to do and how difficult it was to ask for a permission to move stuff of other people, or at least an acknowledgement.
2016-07-05,5,I adore this coffee shop! They pull a perfect shot of expresso, the music is on point, and all the baristas are nice to shoot the bull with.9.9/10
2016-06-16,5,Bwe is, hands down, the best cafe in Hoboken. The staff is friendly, the drinks are great, and if you get here early enough you have to try a sticky bun!I also appreciate the great music they play!
2016-06-12,4,Had an iced latte and an iced oolong tea here. The iced latte had strong espresso taste, which I liked. Can't say  its espresso-milk balance was perfect, but it was ok. Might come back if I can't find any other coffee shop in Hoboken area with better taste and quality.
2016-06-11,1,I found this place to be very pleasant when it opened, however now I refuse to go here as its been taken over by the lap top twats, who sit using a whole table each and refuse to move there crap. I will be taking my business somewhere without wifi !
2016-05-22,5,I absolutely love coming here to work! Although the place is small I love that they have a variety of places to sit. There is a long table in the back that you can share with other, inside idea tables that seat two people, a counter where you can stand and work, and outdoor seating.The coffee here tastes excellent and probably the best in Hoboken. They also have a large variety of loose leaf tea. Snacks including fresh fruit, grain salads, and gluten free/vegan pastries. If you need me, I'll be at Bwe
2016-05-18,5,Bwe is the place where I wrote nearly all my Master's thesis. They have the best coffee and drinks in town and the staff is always very nice and friendly. The atmosphere invites you to stay as long as you want, even if your drink is over. The free WiFi helps, too.
2016-05-17,5,I've been meaning to try this place! I'm glad I finally did! I was working all day down in Hoboken so once I was done I stopped in to refuel. It's so cute! The seating is comfortable. They have window bar seats which I love in coffee places to people watch. The barista was so nice! The bathrooms are so clean! The latte was great! I'll definitely return! :)
2016-05-01,5,Very friendly, fun staff. They always look happy and greet their customers with a smile. They also do foam art!  Long line but moves quickly. Good coffee!
2016-04-20,5,very very good cappuccino, it was creamy and tasty, perfect balance between milk and coffee, I also had a little chocolate cake to go with it and it was super good
2016-04-17,2,Tried Americano and latte this morning, they were just okay. Also, I asked for latte with almond milk and no syrup.. But I got different than I ordered.
2016-04-05,3,GOOD COFFEE Popular People+ People = LoudnessDef recommendable.Def going back but not a fan
2016-03-23,4,Read lots of reviews naming it as the best coffee shop in Hoboken. I really like the cute and relaxing atmosphere. We both get single origin pour over, Haiti and Papanuguini. Coffees are both great. A lot of people do their own work here, making it more of a individual productive working place.Don't see a large varieties of pastries here though.
2016-03-14,5,Decaf iced americano + gluten free vegan chocolate chip cookie = 5 stars! The iced americano was very flavorful and smooth without being bitter or sour.  They carry Silk almond milk - it isn't the best tasting almond milk and I actually dislike the texture and taste of it but it's an option for those who don't mind the brand. I've certainly had better gluten free vegan chocolate chip cookies but the one at Bwe actually tasted pretty clean and not so unhealthy - not too sweet or fattening.  It was also thin and flat which tricked me to think I was eating a huge cookie but I'm sure it's equivalent to a regular sized cookie.  They have two cases of pastries next to each other.  I thought only one case contained gluten free vegan pastries but according to some reviews here, other pastries such as sticky buns and blueberry danishes in the other case are also gluten free and vegan...? That seems too good to be true...I will confirm that next time I stop by...
2016-02-20,5,Best coffee shop in town. Not only do they have amazing coffee but the atmosphere is priceless. This reminds me of the many coffee shops in Brooklyn, so quaint and relaxing. Whenever I have a lot of work to get done and I need a place to be productive I go right to Bwe. Also, the servers are amazing. Julia and Eden are my favorite and they get my coffee right EVERYTIME. I also am very happy that they have expanded to Jersey City. I have yet to visit that new location but I plan to be there a lot in the near future. The price of the coffee is typical but is great quality. Plus you can be there for hours and they aren't kicking you out.Keep up being awesome, I love stopping by :)
2016-02-03,4,Didn't know that trendy Brooklyn vibes could be found on this side of the Hudson river. Coffee was good, vibes were even better, with lovely music playing and a steady trickle of patrons contrasting the freelancers/students/work-from-homers quietly working away.
2016-02-02,5,Truly the best tasting coffee in Hoboken which is why I try to get a cup before heading into the city for work. Nothing else can really compare to the quality you'll find at bwe. Pricing is comparable to other coffee shops so don't be surprised paying $4 for a vanilla latte. You definitely get your money's worth. The pastries and sandwiches are also delicious. The employees are all very sweet. The only downside (which really happens everywhere) is that there is a bit of a line from 8am to 9am so prepare to wait a few extra minutes and brave the double stroller stay at home moms who lack spatial awareness.
2016-02-01,4,It was by chance that I ended up at this teeny tiny coffee shop, but im glad i finally did. For some months now ive seen reviews and they were all positive, but im not that much of a coffee fiend to treck out to Hoboken just for a cup o joe. However, I am glad i did.I was just in NOLA and cups of cafe au lait are everywhere, and to my surprise Bwe has them! I snagged a cup and i didnt even need sugar! It was delicious and blew NOLAs cafe out of the coffee cup for sure! My man who is a big hater of many things, loved his coffee too. he went with a large plain ole cup of coffee, but slurped it right now.The sweets are vegan and gluten free. The peanut butter and jelly bar needs more jelly and the banana muffin was good. Nothing to rave about, but good. Place is really small and very packed, grab a coffee and keep it moving outside--you will not be let down!
2016-01-21,5,I live 2 blocks away and come here for my caramel latte fix. It's definitely a small coffee shop with a lot of personality. Sometimes in the morning on my way to work, I'll grab a bottle of freshly squeezed juice or a pastry and it's always been pretty good. Some days when working from home, I settle into their big center table with my laptop and get comfortable with a cup of fresh coffee. Also, the people working here are super nice!
2016-01-20,4,Absolutely my favorite coffee place in Hoboken.  Although a bit pricier than some of the other options, bwè cafe makes a fantastic latte.  Despite the small space, it has decent seating.
2016-01-20,4,I loved the vibe of this place. Very homey, and the girl taking my order was extremely accommodating and answering all of my annoying questions about sugar content between the soy an almond milk! Everyone was extremely friendly, and the coffee was delicious! I understand specialty milk is more expensive, but an extra .75 was a little painful. I would definitely return thou!
2016-01-03,5,Great coffee shop with gluten free treats. It's a nice place to sit and write.
2016-01-02,5,Absolutely love this place! I am a big fan of their gluten free PB&J bar. I also enjoyed very much their pumpkin spice latte, too bad they only serve this on holidays.
2016-01-02,4,I'm updating my review because I've been getting my weekend coffee from here for some time now and have to say that it is the best coffee in town. I also like their tea selection.  The blood orange tea is quite good. I've never tried any of the baked goods, but my husband has a sticky bun once and seemed to like it even though it was gluten free. That's a tall order. I still think their cardboard coffee sleeves are inferior and don't work all that well, but you can't win them all.
2015-12-21,4,Pretty good coffee. Really enjoy the atmosphere and employees- all very helpful and patient.I ordered a cappuccino- simple. It came out quick and tastes great (one of the best I've had). Friend order something somewhat complicated- cappuccino, less milk, some sort of flavoring, cooler temperature?It was spot on. And quick.The inside is beautiful, a lofty vibe with brick walls and antique-looking bench tables. Prices aren't too bad either.I only wish there was more seating. The few times I've been here there were no seats and it was freezing outSide (there's two tables out there) so I left.They have a decent sized menu- nothing overwhelming. Also some snacks in a cooler and house made treats.Bottom line: I'll be back!
2015-12-20,4,A nice cafe here in Hoboken that has got me thinking, damn, Hoboken, you got some trendy places similar to Oakland and San Francisco! With its gluten free/vegan pastries and fair trade coffee, bwe kafe has definitely caters to a hip crowd. bwe kafe specializes in the beans from Haiti and contributes to fair trade and sustainable food. I got a cafe au lait (dark roast) with a blueberry danish (yes, vegan and gluten free). Somehow, being in this establishment makes me feel responsible as I am doing something good for the world. There is free wi-fi here and seating areas, so I utilized this cafe to get some writing done with moderate noise and great music playing. What a great find!
2015-12-09,4,I walked into this café knowing I would already love it. We claimed our seats in the front to "dog watch", yes I love dogs, especially doddles. I wanted a pastry of some sort and  when I got there on a Saturday mid day they didn't have much (image with review). I was sudden that nothing to my liking was there, therefore I stuck with a "drip" coffee, which was delicious. My friend ordered some tea which was also to his liking. We sat down and just watched at the Saturday interactions happened, which was peaceful. The music selection was ideal and gave me that welcoming feel. I loved the exposed white colored brick wall, it added to the Kafe. They have seating outside, but it was a little chilly to sit outside, but a few people still did all bundled up in their scarfs and coats, it was kind of perfect if you just wanted to enjoy the fresh air and drink your coffee. We thought this place would even be perfect for blogging, escaping the office, have an interview, or even a date. I hope you take a few minutes to stop by as we did before out Washington street shopping began. To make this adventure even more complete I meet Rosie the doodle, she was sooo adorbs sitting outside on one of the benches, very friendly. This Kafe is very dog friendly (no they can't go in for sanitary reasons).Happy Holidays.
2015-12-05,5,Great coffee, great atmosphere, true coffee bar experience. This is a perfect coffee shop to set up shop and work on projects, have meetings, or catch up with friends.
2015-12-04,4,Really cute coffee shop. love how they designed the place. feels very LES. Filled with people working, having a coffee date, on their laptops, or just reading. Very cozy atmosphere, but always packed. I've been here twice and never could I find a seat. Very friendly staff, great lattes, never tried their cold brew but heard it was awesome. They have a small selection of food, all healthy stuff. Definitely will be back.
2015-12-02,2,The atmosphere is lovely, but the coffee is awful.  If you're after getting some work done or socializing, you'll love it.  But we heard that the coffee was great, which is why my husband and I stopped in.  We were both disappointed.  I had an espresso which was stale tasting.  My husband had a latte - weak and watery.  I read somewhere they're coffee connoisseurs.  That can't be right, I get better from the machine at work.
2015-11-29,4,I was looking for a place to chill to get some work done. I decided to try Bwe Kafe after reading a couple of reviews on Yelp. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by an employee who was friendly, cheerful and patient as I was taking my order (It was my first time there and I didn't know what I wanted). It was a bit crowded so I sat outside which was fine by me since it was warm out. The cafe is cute and posh. I ordered an iced drink (Forgot the name) and a sandwich which I think is overpriced given the size but tasty nonetheless. Just be careful, you might end up spending more time than you intended here. It makes for a really nice hangout spot. I also like the fact that they're partnered with some NGO's in Haiti so a purchase helps a business over there. Pretty cool.
2015-11-29,5,Hands down my favorite cafe in Hoboken!  I am an avid coffee drinker - dear lord, my friends even bought me an expresso machine even though I have a verismo at home and keurig at work. I will admit that I may have a slight problem considering that I still frequent bwè kafe.  The staff changes from time to time but I love the staff - they are always super awesome!  They do their best when it gets super busy and the lines are line.  Their coffees and lattes are very good!  During the fall season, they have fall spice latte which is similar to pumpkin spice latte - highly recommended!  The venue is very cute and nicely decorated.  Great spot to hang out when you want to get away from the apartment.
2015-11-21,5,I love this place. They brew LaColombe coffee, great food, super friendly - I recommend the coconut muffin. There are also always vegan and gluten free pastries. They also have free wifi inside.
2015-11-16,5,I have a consistently great experience here! The people are as fantastic as their service and coffee.
2015-11-09,5,Was so paranoid that I was here too long taking up space as I needed a place to meet people for business for a few hours. 4 iced coffees later in bouncing off the walls in love with the place and noticed EVERYONE has been here just as long as me! Thank You!!!!
2015-11-05,5,always best coffee in Hoboken and very cool baristas:)
2015-10-28,5,LOVE this place. Had it 2x in my one night stay in Hoboken. Intimate shop with good coffee. Their "fall spice" latte puts Starbucks to SHAME. Loved that it was within walking distance of where I was staying. People were friendly. Coffee was reasonable!
2015-10-27,3,Cute cafe, feels posh. I got the special - a pumpkin spice latte and have to say that I didn't like it. The ingredients sounded fresh, but they weren't. It was too sweet for my taste buds. If you get it and don't like things to be too sweet, let them know. The space is very welcoming. It was buzzing with people chatting, reading studying and catching up with friends. They had a few baked good options on the menu that were gluten free but for the price they looked tiny and not so appetizing. I didn't try.There was also an overpriced shop area in the back. I usually like that stuff but it is situated too close to where people were drinking coffee. As I was browsing the items I felt like I was getting too close to coffee sippers around me. I might as well have sat on top of their tables. My first impression was a miss... But the place was full so they must be doing something right. I will try a regular latte next time.
2015-10-27,5,I'm not a coffee drinker, but I love the general vibe and organic berry iced tea here. The staff is always personable, friendly, and efficient. The gluten-free/vegan sweets are delicious, too! Especially the PB&J bar and the pumpkin crumble muffin. I wish Hoboken had more cafés like bwé, but I'm very thankful that I live a mere two blocks away.
2015-10-16,5,Great coffee and great service!  The space is also perfect to escape to when you have work to do.
2015-10-14,3,A cute spot in Hoboken (since there aren't many), but the coffee was so so. The place is warm and welcoming, swarmed with laptops (even cats!), and is a good spot to relax in the neighborhood. Almost feels like a piece of Brooklyn in the heart of Hoboken - go figure.However, they don't serve any 8oz drinks - which basically translates into very milk lattes and cappuccinos. I would be back for the space, but not for the coffee in particular.
2015-10-02,5,Love the interior of the place. It is very relaxing, with a peaceful atmosphere and a calm, chill vibe. They have great drink options too! My boyfriend got the Chocolate Frappe and it tasted good. It wasn't overly sweet like those syrups with a ridiculous amount of high fructose corn syrup...which is absolutely a good thing. I got a Dirty Chai with almond milk and I can say, it was one of the best true-to-taste Chai lattes I have ever had. No need for any sweetener, it tasted great the way it was.
2015-09-21,5,Best coffee in town by far with a really friendly staff. Love this place!
2015-09-13,5,Hands down the best coffee in Hoboken (NYC area for that matter). Their lattes are all well down and they have a good seasonal mix too. Try the fall latte, it's better than pumpkin spice from Starbucks. On top of the coffee itself, great vibe in the store and friendly staff!
2015-09-05,5,Love this place! Cozy uptown coffee and tea shop that always hits the spot. The green tea is dynamite!
2015-08-31,5,Best selection of tea ! extremely comfortable.. People flock to ñew York in search for cozy, and quaint cafes,but I'm glad bwe kafe is right here in Hoboken! I can spend the entire day here. Great staff, great drinks!
2015-08-08,5,First time at bwe and it was all around great! The staff was super friendly and helpful in recommending the must haves.
2015-08-04,5,I looooooove this place! I live 45 minutes away but it's worth the trip. Honestly the best atmosphere and coffee
2015-08-02,5,Exactly what Hoboken needs: delicious quality coffee with a comfortable coffee house space.The iced coffee drinks have been my go to all summer and it's even a cool place to chill and work.It looks like they are having some more snack options available too- organic ice cream sandwiches, pastries, giant muffins, and even some sandwiches.Service is fast and friendly.
2015-08-01,5,Literally the best coffee I've ever had. If you go at prime time, the place is always packed. But it is well worth it.
2015-07-30,5,Best brew I've found in Hoboken! So fortunate to have this place conveniently located in my neighborhood and a stone's throw away from the 11th Ave bus stop. The staff is super friendly, the interior is cute, and the iced coffee is delicious. I've only stopped in on my way to the bus stop, but seems like a cool place to sit down and relax. The coffee is not the cheapest, but well worth the buzz and yummy, buttery taste!
2015-07-15,5,I don't often give 5 stars, so when I do you know it's fantastic and well earned. Bwe has everything you can want in it!  Great coffee, great atmosphere , great snacks, great and friendly service and, a great charity (see them about how they help out Haitians). They are opening a second location in jersey city by the water (Newport pavonia I think). Score! Not much else to say except check it out if you haven't already - still reading?  Go already!
2015-07-12,5,Four berry mixed juice was definitely something you would like to try out, if you are a big fan of fruit or sour stuff. It was not too sweet on the other hand. Heard that the freshly brewed coffee was also good, will try next time. Liked the inside decor a lot.
2015-06-16,4,It's really good coffee, much darker and fuller that most you'll find. And the interior has a rustic cabin feel to it and there's usually a seat to sit and read or do work, including some outside. My only gripe is that it can be pricey for everything but the coffee. Then again, boutique coffee shops don't really come cheap.
2015-06-14,5,Been coming here from the beginning and they just get better everytime. Great service and very friendly staff. I love the hot chocolate and soups they serve. I also like that they do the open mic and allow local arists to show their work. This is a grateful place to come study, read or meet a friend and the WiFi is great.
2015-06-12,4,Good ice coffee, free wifi is great, staff is friendly. Good amount of seating and relaxed atmosphere :) They even have some artisan gifts to buy towards the back.
2015-06-08,5,This place is awesome. Serves delicious intelligentsia coffee, they have a Japanese slow drip system which is awesome. Most importantly though it's a great place to hang out. Awesome seating including one large communal table, good music, nice crowd and very airy environment. All the baristas are extremely nice which also helps.
2015-06-05,2,I can't really win with this place. I want to love it- adorable space, great outdoor seating, nice place to grab a coffee with a friend (if you can find a seat!). The slow drip iced coffee tastes great but is so strong that I'm shaking after half a cup (no thanks) and the regular iced coffee tastes like water (also no thanks).
2015-05-27,5,Wonderful coffee for an awesome cause. All about Haiti coffee beans and 'coffee for water.' The roasts are delicious. Cute little place with great decor. They have open mic nights.
2015-05-25,5,First off I will have to say that the owner & staff are so helpful & friendly. Wonderful. The coffee is very good. I had a iced latte & I think it's the best I have had. Coffee is Smith with good flavor. My wife had an iced tea and loved it.
2015-05-19,5,My favorite remote work spot in Hoboken. Great Fair Trade, sustainable coffee, with the friendliest staff in town. Great atmosphere to get things accomplished as mostly everyone in a seat is productively jamming away at a paper, proposal or resume. Getting a seat can sometimes be a challenge, but it's worth the wait. My only complaint, if I have one, is that the music is too loud. I like that they have tunes playing, but I don't think they need to be so loud that I can't drown them out at a respectable volume with my earbuds.  Their open mic nights are fun and different for Hoboken, and give a true city vibe/feel to the town.
2015-05-13,4,Surprisingly really good atmosphere and coffee. It will always be packed because it is a nice place where you can actually hang out to read, study or plainly people watch. Great coffee and pastries!
2015-04-29,5,I love this place.  The people who work are here SO friendly and helpful, literally every single time I go there and I've been here often.  I spent a few Saturdays doing some work at one of the tables here and the ambiance was absolutely perfect.  Whenever I travel or I'm not in Hoboken, I'm always looking for a place like BWE and nothing ever compares!
2015-04-26,5,Bwè kafe translates to "drink coffee" in Creole.  Some other feel-good hippie facts: this establishment contributes to "love for Haiti" and "coffee for water" charities--each supporting schools and hospitals in the aforementioned country. I took a sip of a mildly under-sweetened latte here, and I must say that I was both impressed and reminded of my hatred of lattes. Bwè boasts the most comfortable seating area of any coffee shop in 'boken, at least in my humble opinion.  The window area was an absolutely delightful fortress of the complete lack of solitude in a busy coffee shop, as I was attempting to get some writing done. The dark roast was not overly burnt, as is annoyingly fashionable by any respectable Java dispenser in an upscale setting. Every blend contains Haitian beans, claimed the exceedingly pleasant and damned good-looking barriatocrats doling out caffeinated beverages to the public. I think I can confidently conclude that this is the best coffee shop in the 'boken tundra, or at least the next best thing to a book store or a library. It feels odd to make the latter comparison, but if loitering is the chief purpose of such places, one could do a lot worse.  Oh, and last but not least, the Maya Angelou quote written on the chalk board and the Beatles providing the background music are all greatly appreciated, Bwè staff. Well done.
2015-04-24,5,Only came here once.. ordered a Mocha..  the two staffs were friendly and helpful.. the latte tasted great... the latte art is a plus!  Definitely coming back when I am in the area.
2015-04-19,2,Coffee is good, not great.  The lattes are normal, and nothing to write home about (or on Yelp!).The place, however, is a veritable co working space.  Super annoying, not because people are working there, but because they sit there ALL DAY LONG.  Seriously, never try to go in for a casual chat and a coffee, because you're not going to find a seat.  Hippies, work at home or find a real co working space!!  Last time I came in, a third of you all had even BROUGHT YOUR OWN FOOD.  Seriously, grow up and move out of mom's basement already.So no, I don't appreciate much about this place.  Add the staff lack of humour and it's kind of not a place to go back to.  Hope you have a better experience!
2015-04-18,5,My favorite cafe as an uptown Hoboken resident. The staff is always kind and its a very bright atmosphere. Good music and a relaxing atmosphere to spend time in.  They make my favorite sandwich, the avocado, tomato, chickpea sandwich on multigrain bread.  The lentil soup is good too and both are vegan.  I enjoy the dark roast.
2015-04-17,5,Great newer coffee place uptown in hoboken! The service is fast and lots ofPlaces to relax, read and study. My friends and I always come here to write papers during end of term! Such great gluten free treats- highly recommended
2015-04-13,5,It's really easy for a coffee shop to lose sight of the experience avid caffeine-addicted customers, like myself, are looking for but bwe nails it on the head. Fair trade coffee supporting important philanthropic causes and other Hoboken businesses - can't really go wrong here. Get there early on a nice day and be sure to grab a seat outside foir some prime people watching.
2015-04-10,5,Coffee is my morning, afternoon and evening go to drink for the long hours I work. Well, today I had coffee here after sitting on the subway this week and reading Yelp  reviews. I have to say every review is on target. the coffee is by far one of the best cups I've had. Last time I had a cup this good, I was in Jamaica. Yup, this is that good. I also had a croissant and was able to sit down and do some work as well. All you Hoboken locals need to come out and frequent your local Stores to keep them alive! I will be here again and again oh yeah and again!
2015-04-04,5,I love Bwe! The coffee is totally awesome, and the staff are really pleasant. I also appreciate the way they are working on creating community, with Open Mic, and Tranquility Zone. Whenever I'm in Hoboken I'll drop by, without exception.
2015-04-02,5,I really like this place! I go out of my way to try to make it in there. The dirty chai is good as well as just a regular coffee. The cafe itself is so cute and very inviting with great service
2015-04-01,4,Im going to be totally transparent here, im a full blown coffee addict. I mean, im in deep.  I've tried every coffee shop in town, and this place has the strongest coffee around and the beans stand on their own merit - which is what you need if you drink your coffee black.  Im glad they don't serve a bunch of calorific Foo Foo drinks with whip cream and sprinkles ( btw.. if you're an adult, enough with triple foamy, double chocolate mochaccino. You're holding everyone up and you don't need the 6000 calories. Knock it off ).I go out of my way to get my fix at Bwe, if you're a serious coffee drinker, I suggest you check them out and support the small businesses in Hoboken, as they're quickly disappearing.
2015-04-01,4,Love this coffee shop. I live down the street and study here all the time. The only problem is it gets very crowded, but if you can get a seat, you are good to go for the rest of the day!
2015-03-28,5,Fantastically trendy. A nice intersection of Texas meets industrial meets cosy. Coffee is authentic- Haiti bean. Great taste without being offensively strong. Very chill but not great for dates- a little too busy. Excellent to catch up with friends, clear your mind, and enjoy good espresso. Also, surprisingly affordable
2015-03-27,4,Bwe Kafe gives Hoboken a local indie coffee shop, so call it hipster or yuppie or whatever other phrase du jour suits you. I recently saw an article calling Hoboken "the top hipster city", which means either the real estate offices are doing a great job or the LAMEstream media is laughably incompetent. perhaps a bit of columns A and B at once...but let's get down to the brassiest of tacks - they brew damn fine coffee!it's a little costly, but not outrageous, and you are getting good coffee versus mud soup.I can tolerate Dunkin and find Starbucks utterly undrinkable, so it's good to have a place to get reliably excellent coffee when visiting friends or conducting business in Hoboken. plenty of seating but lots of wifi hogs, so you might have to take your coffee to go.definitely worth checking out if you appreciate coffee.
2015-03-26,5,Consistently the best latte in Hoboken.  I love their extensive drink menu and how they prepare the drinks with care and flare.  The beans here are absolutely delicious and the best way to start the day.  Since I am now pregnant, I have had to limit my caffeine intake and sometimes get the Hot Chocolate instead.  LOVE the hot chocolate as it is not too sweet, not too rich and satisfies my cocoa cravings on the spot.  Only drawback is, I've been here a few dozen times and never, ever have been able to find an empty seat indoors. Granted I usually come on the weekends when it is immensely busy... but still.  Shows a bit how busy it is at Bwe!
2015-03-16,5,I absolutely love this place! I wish there was seating! It's packed on the weekends :((. Delish coffee! I go here everyday in the AM on the way to work.. great start to the morning!
2015-03-11,5,The best latte in town and such friendly owners and staff. Love to hang out with their free wifi while enjoying hand made beverages and excellent coffee.
2015-03-05,5,Great coffee, a nice tea selection, and the people who work here are always super friendly and accommodating. Love it!
2015-02-24,5,One of the better coffee/tea places in Hoboken. Delicious and they really give good service. Recommended.
2015-02-21,5,Awesome, caring staff, delicious espresso, cozy ambiance, AND coffee for a cause. Love bwe!
2015-02-18,5,Just a perfect cafe!! Warm and friendly service, perfect smooth and strong lattes and coffee! Gets pretty packed in the summer for good reason. Great music and lounge chairs...love the decor!  Would be there often if it were a little closer... Free wifi
2015-02-16,5,Food is unique and great.  Staff is warm and efficient.  Coffee is delicious.  The inside is inviting with a solid work ethic feel inside, while simultaneously bumping good music.  I've quickly become a regular.
2015-02-08,5,I am obsessed with everything Bwe from their gluten free desserts to their organic teas; I can't get enough of this place. It's a great place to visit with friends or to study and catch up on work. The atmosphere is always very calm and welcoming. If you haven't been to check this place out you have to immediately!
2015-02-07,5,Really great place. Excellent coffee, friendly staff, and a big communal table with people on their MacBook Airs. A rare example of a place with a New York feel in Hoboken.
2015-02-01,4,Perfect organic vibe, very nice baristas, nice non intrusive music to listen to while reading and having a hot drink on a cold day.
2015-01-31,5,Polite people are working there. Nice atmosphere and good coffee  if the place was bigger it would be much better, also finding a parking lot is not easy.
2015-01-27,5,New to the area and found an awesome place to have coffee, snacks and do some work. Nice and quiet environment. Tough to find parking but that seems to be in issue in all of Hoboken. Definitely recommend this place to anyone who just needs a comfortable and cool spot to get away and get some work done. Very friendly staff!
2015-01-23,4,Great coffee, great staff, great atmosphere. My only complaint is not being able to get a good seat when I WFM. Survival of the fittest around these parts.
2015-01-05,5,Like most people, I only awaken after the first sip of coffee.  With a cup from bwe in the morning, I'm perky even though I'm away from home.  They are brewing deep rich Haitian coffee beans.  I sometimes get one of their loose leaf teas (mid-day, of course) which is always fragrant.  The scones are great but sell out quickly.  Recently, I sheepishly ordered a "soy chai latte with a shot of espresso." To my chagrin, the barista said "so a dirty soy chai latte".  They're in the know; I will never underestimate bwe again!
2014-12-17,5,Great coffee, tea and pastries.  Friendly service and relaxing vibe sitting inside or out at this independently owned cafe. From the sourcing of their coffee to the proceeds helping Haitian youth and communities this cafe is more than just a great coffee shop.
2014-12-11,4,Friendly staff, great tasting coffee and tea, slightly overpriced pastries, warm atmosphere. I like my buy 10 get 1 free stamp card-- I usually go for a sinful mocha latte!I like their selection of handmade gifts and small decorative items from around the world.My only complaint is that the music (speakers by the back table) can be distractingly loud if you're trying to work, and when I've requested they lower it, another employee usually raises the volume within a few minutes. WIsh they'd consider playing it a little quieter!
2014-12-07,5,This cafe is 2 doors down from where my brother lives. What lucky bastard that he can go in his pajamas and slippers to this amazing coffeehouse. I asked him to get me a holiday drink. He got me a skim pumpkin spice coffee. I love all things pumpkin but realized that I don't like drinking pumpkin flavored things (a la Starbucks' PSL). This beverage has made me change my mind. The right, subtle blend of familiar spices mixed with the aroma made this a perfect cup of coffee.I enjoyed this drink so much that, for an afternoon pick-me-up, I got a soy dirty chai and my brother got a red eye. Again, another home run. I look forward to this morning's coffee run. I can't wait to try something new.My brother got me a pain au chocolat to go with my pumpkin spice coffee. Light and flaky with high quality chocolate. In the afternoon, I got a vanilla coconut vegan cookie. It was the 1st vegan cookie I had ever tried. It was really good. I liked it.Bwe kafe makes me so jealous of my brother. Light years better than Starbucks. I will frequent this cafe as many times as I can, while visiting my brother. I love supporting local business.
2014-12-05,5,Preface:  I am not a hipster.  I don't like coffee.  I think coffee is overpriced.  If it's morning and I walk by this place I always go inside and always get a Latte.  I can't tell you why, other then they are simply delicious.  I feel like they might slip something extra in them that keeps me coming back for more because I don't drink coffee or caffeine for that matter pretty much ever.  Is the coffee expensive?  Yes.  Is it worth it? God yes.    The environment is really relaxed and eclectic from the really laid back staff, to the different clientele.  I got a cookie once for a friend who said I should never buy them again because they will make her fat because she inhaled the thing.  They are constantly hosting open mic nights and other type of coffee shop events one can only see these days on re-runs of Friends.  Simply, really really awesome.
2014-12-01,4,bwe kafe has become my go-to coffee spot in Hoboken! They have a great selection of coffee, espresso, and tea drinks, as well as yummy pastry options. The staff has been friendly every time I've been there and it's a great atmosphere to get a little work done or just sit and chat with a friend. Music is great as well.It's sometimes too crowded in the small space, so it's a disappointment to walk 20 minutes there only to find that there's nowhere to sit. The pastries are also rather expensive, but as the occasional treat, I don't mind too much!
2014-11-21,4,I really love this place and only wish it were closer to me. Great staff, great assortment of gluten-free goodies. Get a donut or the pb&j bars! A beacon of light in a town otherwise devoid of unique coffee shops.
2014-11-01,5,Best cappuccino I've ever had in my whole life! And the berry scones are pretty amazing too!
2014-10-12,4,Quaint cafe with wifi. Coffee was good. Suitable place to get some work or studying done
2014-10-12,5,Very cosy place, perfect for a Sunday afternoon coffee time. Staff is very nice and they have a large choice of coffees and teas
2014-09-19,5,You have to live it to believe it!!!!! Best place to chill out and study o yeaaah. You can stay here all day long. All you need is coffee
2014-09-18,5,Love bwè kafe! If I was living in this neighborhood I'd be here all the time. Staff are super friendly and the cappuccino I got was really good.  Cute decor and a very cozy atmosphere. I really enjoy the type of music being played here. It is a laptop friendly establishment with wifi ... I can see myself sitting here the entire day getting work done.
2014-09-14,5,Great little shop on corner of 10th/Washington.Nice atmosphere.
2014-09-12,5,I can spend all day here. Workers are always happy to say welcome :)) and Bwe's latte is number one in Hoboken.
2014-09-01,5,bwé is my go to café in Hoboken. The coffee is very good and at a very reasonable price. What I like even more is the atmosphere there. Excellent spot to study, get some nice relaxation, or even go on a date. The cherry on top is that it's founded from an excellent humanitarian cause. Hipsters rejoice!
2014-08-12,5,Iced drip coffee has just the amount of caffeine I need! (Read: A LOT). And if you're looking for a treat the gfree pumpkin donut!
2014-08-12,5,Only place to get coffee in Hoboken. Best staff, coffee and space. Excellent Cortados and yummy pour overs. The vibe is for real and we are lucky to have Bwe in our neighborhood.
2014-08-10,4,Bwè kafe will wink at you from across the street, especially if you find yourself in need of caffeine. It has a very charming exterior with two or three tables to sip your beverage if the weather avails. Once you enter, you are met with a gorgeous espresso machine, gleaming proudly as light pours in through the large windows. The walls showcase resplendent local art along simple white brick. There are selves that have a variety of trinkets and merchandise to buy, all of which work as accent pieces to the decor. Along the right wall are several boards with information about the café's cause (the purification of water in Haiti), the café's schedule at large, and the menu. The menus are explicit and the selection is replete with tea and coffee to suit a spectrum of tastes.The interior is equally as simple and charming. Seating was no issue on a Saturday evening, although I'd imagine Fridays are a bit different. You will find the odd hipster with glassy eyes on his computer, poised to type, while sipping his artful latte. Might I add, the latte art is top tier. I was poured a stunning rosetta.I sat on a stool facing the window for a street view. My mom ordered a tea that was a gorgeous deep, rhubarb color. I think it was an herbal, berry tea. The ice was crushed and the tea was delightfully potent. I bore the kind of potency that pinches your cheeks and plays on your taste buds.  I first ordered a café au lait and wasn't satisfied with the taste. I returned to the counter and ordered a latte, met with the same pleasant disposition from the first order. The latte was creamy and full-bodied, the espresso had a nutty quality that was scrumptious. I can't imagine how satisfying it'd be on a cool fall evening.The place itself is a bit hushed but one could definitely make friends with the staff and foster a casual comraderie, I'm sure. The playlist was among the best I've heard at a café. Good experience, lovely design, great latte.
2014-08-05,4,bwè is a very A typical hipster coffee shop, but that should not take away from the fact that the customer service and quality coffee and food is still awesome!I walked in and was greeted by Passion Pit playing over high decibel speakers while people casually typed away on their MacBooks. The girls at the counter were extremely nice and seemed to be very knowledgeable of the menu. I only ordered a small light roast coffee but it was worth the money because I was craving something better than my usual Folgers.
2014-07-26,4,Great environment nice staff amazing coffee I just wish there was more variety with their eating selection ie muffin Danish etc.
2014-07-08,4,Great ice coffee. Could have taken a tad more ice, but it was really hot that day. Trip in was overdue, and I was not let down in the taste department. Husband had Mint ice cream sandwich and he loved it. Plus they are open super early which is helpful if your out and about first thing.
2014-06-29,4,Great cappuccino's. friendly staff and the decor pretty cool. Way better than Starbucks
2014-06-10,4,Love Bwè! Their coffee is quite tasty and it's a very chill vibe. Seats fill up quickly but it is so refreshing to have a local coffee place located uptown! I always go for an iced latte of some sort..make sure to grab a frequent card to get a free drink!
2014-05-30,5,BWE! Where to begin.... absolute favorite place to get coffee in all of Hoboken. I stop in nearly every day of the week for my large iced mocha, sometimes even twice in a day. Amazing coffee, great pastries, wonderful staff, awesome atmosphere. And loveeee the monthly open mic event! Best cafe around!
2014-05-28,5,Went in on a Saturday, the place was pretty packed. Cute decor, friendly service and great iced almond milk latte! Not too sweet, not too bitter, just the way I like it! I will be back :-)
2014-05-23,5,I really like this place. The counter guys/gals are great, the coffee is great tasting and I love the gluten free peanut bars/brownies. I always taken my items to go but it looks like a great spot to hang around and relax with a great cup of coffee.
2014-05-06,5,Just like everyone recommended. I love coming hear for their coffee and teas, and what I love is their mission. It is great that their stuff is cheaper than Starbucks and you are given to a place in town. Also, the decor is the best and cozy and provides a tru coffee shop feel.
2014-05-02,4,Found this fab little kafe on Yelp and then heard great reviews about it from friends. Background: I was looking for a quiet cafe in the area where I could study for my law school exams and I was pleased!Experience: The music is nice and relaxing. The cafe is generally quiet. There are people here doing work, homework, or just chatting it up with a friend. I sat here for about six hours (actually I'm still here writing the review) and the owners have let me be. Not once did I feel rushed to leave. I will definitely be coming up. Also, they have a sick playlist. Food/Beverages: They have a few baked goods, small salads and subs already prepared. I had a berry ice tea which was good and refreshing. Recommendation: Have more food! Paninis, Soups, Sandwiches, etc. This place is so good that there's rarely any seating so you don't want to lose your spot to go eat somewhere else. But overall, I had a great time and hope to be back soon.
2014-04-28,4,Wow, I can't believe there are so many snarky remarks on here. I don't know what these people are expecting from a coffee shop. If you really have such a phobia of catching the hipster bug, go somewhere else. If you want to chat with friends or get some work done, this place is awesome. I gave Bwe a 4 because it can be difficult to find seating at times.
2014-04-24,2,Cashier seemed absent minded on the day that I went. I had to repeat most of my orders a few times for her to catch up. When she returned my credit card, instead of give it to me, she just casually put it on a wet spot with coffee spill. Didn't seem like a nice welcoming coffee shop
2014-04-07,5,Love this place, good coffee, gluten free treats and a comfy but tastefully decorated interior :)
2014-04-05,5,I love bwe!  I'm so glad I live right around the corner. I get the chai tea latte almost every time and it's so yummy!
2014-04-01,5,Friendly service, wifi, convivial atmosphere and excellent coffee! Worth a visit.
2014-03-23,3,It's a cute spot. run of the mill coffee house but it served it's purpose. I had a latte with caramel which was decent.
2014-03-15,5,A cozy little coffee shop, very friendly staff and delicious coffee! A lot better than going to Starbucks when your uptown!! They also have event nights like: Game nights and open mic..
2014-02-27,5,Great coffee, great staff, and great music. Can't ask for a better coffee shop than Bwe
2014-02-22,5,I love this place!  A much needed addition to uptown Hoboken!  Ask about their donations to Haiti!  DO NOT MISS THE OPEN MIC NIGHT "Hoboken Spoken"!!!  I live across the street and come here often!  Highly recommended!  And oh yeah, let's not forget the awesome coffee!!!
2014-02-08,1,One star for lousy costumer service.I went there this morning with my 5 years old girl to pick up a coffee for my husband. When I took the cup of coffee from the counter, a smart customer who was not paying attention to the people around because she was still sleeping probably, hit my arm and the hot coffee spilled on my iphone and my daughter's forehead. The guys on the other side of the counter? No reaction. I had to ask for napkins, to finally get a few. Did they offer to get me another cup of coffee? Of course not. The girl who was there mumbled something about how could the coffee spill with the top on it. And the guy was just standing there and staring at us.The customer who started all this said sorry, but did not try to help in any way. What's wrong with you people?
2014-02-08,4,Ladies and Gents, it's your stereotypical coffee house full of hipsters and people "working on their novels" over the free Wi-Fi, HOWEVER...This place is a gem, they have really good coffee; I'm sure you can get the double mocha, latte with a shot of whatever the hell with soy blah.... BUT it's clear they care most about serving their signature light and dark roast blends and both are fantastic.  Ambiance is chill, and the staff is nice.  It's not quite the anti-Starbucks, but I prefer the scene here than the uptown Starbucks.  I have never gone beyond the coffee, however their muffins, donuts,  banana bread and such looks delicious - maybe next time.One odd thing, they are seemingly anti-take out.  Meaning, no stoppers to put on the top of the lid so you don't spill half on the street or the multi-cup holder thingy.  WHY?
2014-01-27,4,I wish I had known about bwe kafe sooner -- I had started to think that NYC was the only place I could go for a half decent latte!  Imagine my surprise when I found out that this coffee shop is located only a few blocks from my apartment building.   After checking out the reviews, I decided to give it a shot...and I'm thrilled that I did.  My latte lacked the bitter taste I've come to expect from Starbucks, and was instead deliciously rich and creamy.  I didn't try any of their gluten-free desserts this time around, but will probably give in next time!  I'll definitely return, and often.
2014-01-25,4,Finally, a real coffee shop in Hoboken! Great selection of quality coffee and a real coffee shop vibe.
2014-01-24,3,Packed late on a Sunday morning.Better than the chain places for sure.  On par with the other local shops in Hoboken, but with one huge plus... Space.  I'll definitely stop in for a coffee when I'm uptown.
2014-01-14,5,The only place for a real cup of coffee in Hoboken. Has yet to let me down once.
2014-01-02,5,Just an update to re-validate the 5-star rating. Love this place and it's my regular since I moved uptown (sorry, Empire, still love you). Gluten-free doughnuts keep the gf happy and I can't tell they're even missing the gluten.The latte tournament was fun. Tip for the the one you want to drink and get on the menu. Hope they roll those out a couple times per year. Vote Gingerbread! Four more months, four more months!
2013-12-14,4,Very nice and relaxing. This is what Hoboken was missing. It had a lot of open seats as well as free WiFi hooray.  I wish they have a bigger selection of desserts.
2013-12-09,5,Absolutely yummy cafe latte!!!! So worth it! Kept us awake all day :))). My husband who normally doesn't drink coffee or tea and even he loved it.  Good job guys!
2013-11-26,5,Best coffee Hoboken, no contest. Definitely try the slow drip iced coffee, it's magical.
2013-11-24,4,Very cute atmosphere, reminds me of a place you'd find in my family's hometown of Portland, OR.Great selection of teas and pretty friendly staff.
2013-11-21,4,I popped in here when I arrived early for a yoga class around the corner. The vanilla chai tea latte is oooohh so good. The staff is super friendly too - the guy behind the counter (sorry I didn't get your name!) helped me decide between a regular chai and a chai latte. They take credit cards too, and there is no minimum - SUPER plus! And wi-fi... sweet, sweet free wi-fi. Will definitely be back.
2013-11-12,4,Friendly, upbeat, quaint, nice little artsy space. I was pleasantly surprised to see they offered some vegan donuts but, unfortunately, they weren't very good :( I mean, don't get me wrong,  I'd get it again but it was more like moist cake than a donut. Especially considering how donuts are a "thing" now, they should work on that.Regardless, lovely artwork throughout, everyone is super nice and the coffee was superb. They made me a cafe au lait with almond milk (also have soy). I'll definitely come back to do some schoolwork here and enjoy a quiet afternoon.
2013-10-30,5,Come here for hot coffee or tea. Friendly, clean and just a great place to get some work done outside the office.
2013-10-20,4,I really like this place; it's a cool coffee place to hang out (and the coffee is actually tasty).  Specialty drinks/teas are a bit expensive but a regular coffee is reasonable and tastes good.   One thing that would add half or a whole star for me would be if there were better options to go a long with the coffee ...the gluten free brownie that I had with my coffee was just okay and very over-priced...still a good place to go have a good cup of coffee and get some work done or read a book.
2013-10-17,5,Thank you for finally bringing another cute sit down coffee shop to Hoboken that is closer to uptown where are the families are.  I absolutely love their Spice Latte it is one of a kind! AMAZING you must try- beats out the Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte 1000 times over.
2013-10-14,5,My new favorite spot in Hoboken! I stopped by for a vanilla latte to go and it was absolutely delicious. I walked in and noticed how bright it was. There were plenty of people on their laptops so it is a nice place to get work done. The staff was friendly and made sure I got a punch card to go. She let me know that they've been open for about 5 months now and they are doing great. I'm happy for them. I definitely will be back to explore more of their drink menu but this time with my laptop!
2013-10-13,5,Absolutely adore this place. Hoboken has started to expand beyond the sports bar arena and this is a wonderful addition to an increasingly diverse and interesting town. Shabby chic decor, mismatched trinkets, art and design books carefully placed atop shelves. Large windows to fill the place with natural, bright light. A display case of gluten free doughnuts, scones, and muffins to accompany your drink was very tempting. The thing I actually appreciate the most about this coffee shop is its unpretentious drink menu. House, pour over, espresso, Americano, all common and recognizable drinks but of the very best quality. You feel like a coffee connoisseur without amassing the snobbery or vast coffee knowledge.Great drinks, friendly and attentive staff, mellow music, make this spot great for those working from home days or when you want to spend an afternoon absorbed in a book. Will definitely be back for more weekend morning pick me ups.
2013-09-27,5,Love love love love.  It's places like this that make me wish I lived in Hoboken.  I had just a simple whole-milk latte here, and not only was the barista sweet, it was one of the best plain lattes I have ever had.  I felt as if I was drinking velvet.  The espresso was a lovely roast-- not burnt tasting or acidic or anything.  Oddly, though coffee tends to hype people up, sipping this mellowed me out.The inside was gorgeous-- and I understood the appeal of Jersey.  Every person had his or her own table (cool rustic looking log tables) and no one was cramped, crammed in, or fussing with the wireless signal that had more traffic than the turnpike.  There were even a few tables to spare!  Also, you know how on TV, New York coffee houses are always portrayed as hip, artsy, and laid-back, with a folk singer and people just hanging out?  Yeah, that's what this felt like.  There were signs for an open mic night, and I pictured it like that fictional New York coffee house in the evening.  Wish I lived in Hoboken.
2013-09-05,3,Finally made it here during Labor day. Place was quite crowded and no seats available even at 1030am on a holiday. Anyways, wanted the Japanese Brew Coffee - they didn't have it. So he suggested another cold brew iced coffee - which also was not available, so I just asked for whatever iced coffee they had. It was decent, nothing to rave about. I was however, very impressed by the Blueberry danish pastry which was delicious and not overly sweet at all. They accept credit cards which is a big Plus !!!
2013-08-26,4,They've done a really nice job with this place, and it's good to see a hip coffee option uptown other than Starbucks.  I really like the whitewashed walls, it gives it a light airy feeling that helps you clear your head and start your morning right.  Everyone in there is happy and you are always greeted with a smile.The coffee is usually "very good" but sometimes it is just "good".  The iced coffee tastes good but gets a bit watery because they use tiny ice cubes which melt quickly, so it is really cold at first and then starts to get watered down.  So drink up!Their muffins and scones are very good, though small.  There are a few tables outside which is nice.All in all, it's definitely one of the best coffee shops in uptown Hoboken and I hope they stick around.
2013-08-11,4,Was meandering all over Hoboken and stopped in here by chance and really liked the Japanese cold drip iced coffee
2013-08-11,4,Good products, nice staff, cool breezy white look and feel to the place.  Relaxing for an extended stay or a quick swig.  I had a Fizzy Lizzy, ICE COLD, I mean COLD, despite being in a semi-open display and my wife had a hot chocolate.  Milk and Ghirardelli syrup shouldn't taste that good.  Not overly sweet, and quality all the way.  A little farther from the main area of the Washington "strip" but a few blocks from the water and boardwalk.  Great for refreshments, a snack and a leisurely time.
2013-08-08,4,Decent coffee, free WiFi, good atmosphere, and the young ladies who run the cafe during the day are very friendly. Only drawback is that the food options are expensive. Perfect place in Hoboken to enjoy a coffee and catch up on some reading and e-mails.
2013-08-04,5,Awesome coffee spot and place to get work done in Uptown Hoboken. This place has: great coffee (and iced drinks), good music, friendly staff (it's a family run business), and provides a perfect spot to get some work done with free (and fast) wifi. A portion of the proceeds from coffee here goes to building clean water filters in Haiti. Take a look at some of the crafts in the back. These also support poor, rural communities around the world. Without a doubt, a highlight of Hoboken, for sure.
2013-08-02,4,What a superb new addition to Washington Street.   This place has it all:  ambiance, a good product and excellent service.The space is very well laid out and welcoming.  It's what a coffee shop should be.  It makes you want to spend time there, whether it be at one of the tables inside or outside on a nice day.   Their espresso roast is excellent and their regular coffee is also very good.  I do enjoy their cold drip iced coffee, with a the slight exception of the tiny, tiny ice cubes that they used (they melt very fast).    The staff couldn't be nicer, either.  I'm really tired of small coffee shops with baristas and counter people who have attitude (I can name about 10 of them in NYC).  This place is far from that as it can be...such a welcoming crew that works here.
2013-08-02,4,$3 for large iced coffee with La Colombe beans. Decent prices, very nice staff and plenty of room to sit.
2013-07-27,5,The five star reviews aren't lying. Terrific coffee, great service and owners who are serious about their social commitments.
2013-07-24,1,Yeah, NO....First off, the wait..the wait...the wait. I went on mid morning and there might have been 3-4 other guests and the staff looked baffled, slow, and very much not on the ball. I heard a ton of hype about this place, and like most things it seriously failed to live up hype. I ordered a latte and iced coffee, the iced coffee was seriously blah, and they put this strange ice in it that just melted one block after taking it out of the store. The latte was just pathetic, and with zero micro foam care and skill. The had about a 5-6 wifi hogs taking most of the seating (these people most account for some of the positive reviews). So basically, they butcher the worst selection of la colombe coffee, but they do sell trinkets and small artwork...so i guess thats a plus?? Look elsewhere for great coffee, look here for style over substance.
2013-07-24,5,I keep meaning to get back here, but it's a bit out of the way for me. Bwe is a nice, well lit, and spacious coffee house. Plenty of seating with a large table in the back. The coffee is of high quality. The service is excellent and the baristas are friendly and unpretentious (unlike some of Bwe's competitors). I highly recommend this coffee shop. I just moved to New Jersey from Michigan, and this is the type of coffee shop that I've been missing. An excellent place to get some work done, or to just stop in and relax.
2013-07-15,5,Great place. My husband and I look forward to coming each weekend. I think the staff is so friendly and helpful that it really helps the vibe. They have a great coffee selection and it's just what that area needed.
2013-07-14,5,Thank God for this place.  Great coffee, friendly staff, awesome vibe.  Fantastic addition to the 'hood.  Love you guys.  Keep up the great work.
2013-07-14,5,Great tasting coffee and super friendly staff! I'm lucky to live 2 buildings away from this welcome addition to uptown Hoboken coffee shops! :)
2013-07-12,5,I am such a cafe feign. I seriously can't get enough of them.And I must say: bravo Hoboken! Despite the usual Hobo stroller moms, this cafe pretty much embodies everything I want in a cafe: * great lighting and relaxing ambiance* conveniently located near my lover's place* great cause and background story (work in Haiti)* an interesting name* good espresso (La Colombe!)* & ALMOND MILK. (enough said.) Because we're both coffee feigns and the name "Bwe kafe" means "drink coffee" in Haitian Creole- we were instantly enticed. I mean there's nothing else really Haitian about this place being it's in Hoboken I don't think they want to shock their typical clientele but it's a great place nonetheless! Perfect spot to spend the afternoon with my love sipping an iced almond milk latte, giggling (yes, men giggle) at the stroller moms and the frazzled look on their faces.I'm hooked & I will totally return.
2013-07-09,2,Can't really judge the coffee quality - Only had Iced Coffee once. It was not great but it's such a small sample size.Got my order to go but the short experience was pretty rude: Did not get greeted, did not get smiled at.
2013-07-07,2,They don't know how to dial in their grinder. The baristas have relatively little technique in preparing espresso. I wish it was better. I have yet to find good espresso in Hoboken.
2013-07-07,3,Bweh.At least that's what I'd say based on the iced coffee, which is what I've been drinking during the ridiculous, "Al Gore was right about global warming" heat wave we've been having.  I was excited to see coffee shops like Red Lion and Bwe open, because Hoboken really needs places like these.  Red Lion was first out of the gate and quickly won my loyalty, to the point that I felt like I was almost cheating on them coming here.  But the reviews for Bwe were so good, I had to try it.  I started by sampling the cold-brewed iced coffee, thinking that would be my best chance for a flavorful brew, but I was wrong.  It was surprisingly mild and uninteresting, and their standard, less-expensive iced coffee actually packs more flavor.  Neither one can stand up to the delicious cold-brewed iced coffee at Red Lion, though, and if pressed, I might even say I prefer Starbucks' iced to Bwe's.  The value equation also favors these other places:  a Red Lion 16 oz. cold-brewed iced is $4 and worth every penny, a Starbucks grande is less than $3 and a fair deal, but here the cold-brewed iced only comes in one size, small, for $3.75.  Now, despite the heat, I have also sampled the espresso-based drinks, and I can say those are quite good:  rich, flavorful espresso with thick, creamy milk foam, even a little bit of art on the top.  Haven't tried the regular coffee yet, but will update once I get the chance.  Food options run more to healthy lunch items (sandwiches, greek yogurt) than pastries.The space inside is clean, light and airy, with ample seating and free wifi, if you're into that.  I'm actually not, since places that offer it tend to fill up with people camping out for hours on end, nursing their $3 purchase into virtual squatters' rights.  But hey, that's just me - your mileage may vary.
2013-07-05,5,small, cute, friendly, great coffee and tea.  this is what you want in a neighborhood coffee place.
2013-07-05,5,I came here often when they first opened.  Love the vibe as the employees are very friendly. I also came here often with little girl who I work with, one-on-one. I love that they have - wide variety of flavorful teas (initially unsweetened) since the girl has a special diet, and it gives her a chance to taste their teas! Without restrictions! Anyway, on to the coffee - 'spensive, but strong. I love their Japanese cold press - delish. Also, they source their pastries from local vendors! They sell gluten free (and some dairy free) items from Laura Lagano Nutrition, a local nutritionist/dietician, whose goodies are healthy AND delicious! The brownies are heaven!
2013-07-01,5,Nice & Clean!~ Satisfied with the Wifi speed!Now they put flowers on each table. So beautiful! Me & my friends love this place so much!
2013-06-26,5,This place. Yeahhh. What a great addition to Hoboken. Bright, airy and quite large this place is Yelp New Jersey's newest Hoboken office. The coffee is expensive and small but it packs a punch. It's not your run of the mill diner coffee. This is the Japanese cold pressed, I''m sure organic (but really have no clue), coffee connoisseurs dream, I'll be up for days type coffee. The music is perfect back ground music and the space itself is quite conducive to creativity and a pleasant experience. There's even outdoor space right on Washington Street to enjoy this beautiful weather. Life is good.Also, gotta give it up for these newer businesses implementing new technology like square with the receipt being emailed to me and making all transactions quick and easy. I'm into it.
2013-06-14,4,Spent a good 5 hours at this place with a few of my fellow Yelpers this week and had a very pleasant experience! The baristas were friendly and welcoming, and the atmosphere was relaxed.I really enjoyed my large iced coffee ($3). Their large size is what I would typically call a small though, and they serve the coffee with tiny ice cubes that melt really quickly. I practically chugged my coffee because I didn't want it to get watered down. There is also a big tea selection and they offer a variety of baked goods (muffins, scones, cookies, etc.) and some items are gluten free. I ate a cinnamon walnut scone that was nothing special, but tasted good.The spaciousness of bwè allows for plenty of tables/chairs inside, plus there is outdoor seating in the front. It's an excellent place for studying or working. The music they played was fun -- maybe a bit too fun because I kept wanting to get up and dance. I will definitely be back here soon.
2013-06-10,4,The coffee is delicious (la colombe. As someone from Philly, I was really excited to see this).  The muffins are yummy. I love the cozy atmosphere in the front of the shop.  The back of the shop would be great for getting some work done but it tends to get a little loud a difficult to concentrate.  The staff is super friendly. The only negative is that the large iced coffee is significantly smaller than other Hoboken coffee shops. It's actually looks smaller than the smalls at other shops. The food options are made out of house and are limited.
2013-06-06,5,So today I was scoping out an unofficial Yelp hangout in Hoboken and was told to check this place out annnnnd I love it!! Even before walking in it's lovely; right out front there's a cute little outdoor seating area. Then when you walk in the atmosphere itself is very welcoming. The decor is very homey looking and inviting. It's also bigger than it looks like from the outside. And the service is great, as soon as we walked in the baristas warmly greeted us and took our order. I was torn between what to order so the barista suggested an Iced Mocha because it has some type of special chocolate so I went with that. And it was delicious!This is probably going to be my new coffee/work hang-out. They've managed to win me over in just one visit.
2013-05-31,5,I just love this place!It's just the type of lounge-y coffee shop that Hoboken needed. It has a great energy and could honestly spend hours here talking to the owners and other people from around town. What a great local spot!Now, about the goods: They're wonderful! The coffee has a smoothness to it that you can't get anywhere else in the 'boken, their smoothies are amazing, cookies and other foods are as fresh as can be!I also feel great coming here knowing that some of the money goes back to helping build Haiti after their horrendous earth quake a couple of years ago. They are committed to their philanthropic routes and never knew that buying a cup of coffee could make me feel so good inside!A+ for this hang out!
2013-05-30,4,A great, uptown coffee shop.  The coffee is La Colombe, which is a solid, consistent brand.  Food options are limited to a few sandwiches, salads and pastries, but they're fresh and flavorful.  Wifi is free and fast enough to be productive.  The space is large enough to seat roughly 40 people, which is a good thing because it's a hot spot for day-time remote workers.  Glad they're in town!
2013-05-29,5,A big welcome to the excellent  Bwè Cafe - a welcome new addition to Hoboken's North Reaches. Gluten-free fans, yes, they have tasty gf snacks. And excellent coffee/espresso. Sandwiches,yogurt, oatmeal. Very nice woody earthy ambience and friendly proprietors.
2013-05-20,5,Delicious coffee. They have some adventurous roasts here. My cafe au lait was spot-on. Friendly staff, definitely Brooklynesque. WiFi squatters are already in place, so you may have to get it to go. The only oddity were the empty picture frames in the loo. Intentional? I'm so not with it.
2013-05-19,5,I can't even begin to explain how welcome this place is in Uptown Hoboken. There is a complete dearth of interesting, trendy places in this entire city. There are so few cool. local spots around here, especially in the way of coffee shops. Bwe is probably a 4 in terms of general atmosphere and such (you'll find cooler in Manhattan and Brooklyn, of course), but my goodness this staff is friendly and the coffee is delicious. 5 stars it is. Welcome to the neighborhood.
2013-05-12,5,Very welcome addition to the neighborhood. Modern, airy space - with outdoor seating as well - comfortable, relaxing, beach bungalow feel. Excellent coffee and lovely service.
2013-05-12,5,When I was looking into moving to uptown Hoboken, I was a bit concerned that all the good coffee shops were downtown. It sounds like Red Lion is good but doesn't have indoor seating. I was glad to find out that bwe kafe was opening just after I moved in. I got a Haitain pour-over which was delicious. Also had a very good danish.The inside space is really nice -- there are some small 2-person tables in the front area and a large 6-8 person table in the back. Free wi-fi for people who want to study or do work. Looking forward to coming here often!
2013-05-08,5,Yes, there is a place or two to snag a coffee in this neck of the woods, but having a super cute trendy welcoming coffee shop in our midst was something we were lacking before. You can guess how excited this coffee lover was to know a new shop was opening up along my route to work. Score!! I was able to stop in this morning for the first time. The establishment still has it's "We just opened!" energy and glow. Outside their front door their grand opening step&repeat sits welcoming new customers to take a photo - even the staff offered to take me back outside to have my photo taken. Super cute! This morning I went with their house blend and a lovely blueberry muffin. Much needed morning deliciousness for sure. Welcome to the 'hood, Bwe! I can't wait to stop in on a weekend with a good book and enjoy the atmosphere a little while longer.
2013-05-07,3,Oh Bwè you had me at the use of crushed ice. Your Japanese cold brew is a delight but I wish you served it in a larger size. I get why you don't, but still. So many choices when it came to baked goods it was really hard to decide on the coconut muffin that was crumbly and wonderful. Your space, so light, bright, and airy, was cozy as can be. I fell in love with your front counter height window table near the coffee jazz up station.  I will be posting up here laptop crusader status for sure. The lady and gent working was ever so lovely. Tho on other visits the niceness in service has gone down. Bonus points for music taste, Birdy?! hello!!
2013-05-07,5,Hands down: The. Best. Coffee. In. Hoboken. Likely some of the best in the region. There's no doubt...while I usually prefer to go into the city for outstanding food/drink, this coffee is totally worth staying in Hoboken for (or traveling here to get some!) I am so excited that Hoboken is getting awesome new businesses that are unique, independent and ridiculously awesome - this is a perfect example. And not only is it totally and unequivocally delicious - proceeds are going to a great cause, a socially-minded enterprise - a portion goes directly to Haitian children, for drinking water/education. Now this is something that I can toast my beans to!Things that I am impressed by on my first visit:- Awesome airy space...perfect for studying, coffee-dating, a relaxing and beautiful atmosphere- Ridiculously friendly folks - from the person making my coffee (Evan) to the person who rang me up (Destiny) and even the customers I met - this is a place to go to be happy. - Fabulous single origin coffee, great scones/baked goods (delivered daily from Amy's Bread)  and I can't wait to try the flowering tea buds!I am sure I will be back tomorrow!
