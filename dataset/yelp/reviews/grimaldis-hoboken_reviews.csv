2021-11-01,4,This was probably the best gluten-free pizza I've ever had! Their ricotta cheese is yummy, and the calzone was decent. Lacked a little bit of flavor tho
2021-10-27,2,Fake. Go to 1 front street for real thang. Could've been better if truth was followed.
2021-08-08,4,my group was looking for somewhere to eat and ended up stopping by grimaldi's. it was early in the day so it was empty, and we were seated at a booth for four. the service was quick and excellent, our seat allowed us to catch them actually making our pizza as well. the food was great and the personal pies are honestly more than enough for one person. everything was very clean; my only gripe is that our waiter did not wear a mask while serving us. most of the staff was maskless aside from the man who seated us.
2021-07-06,4,We enjoy eating out. We recently went to this fine place which we didn't know before. We spent a lovely time there with delicious dishes and a well-trained team and an impressive cook. They have a great selection of pizza and I had a slice of Margherita and pepperoni pizza. They have a good quality of ingredients, taste really good and fresh. We added this venue to our list and we will no doubt visit again soon. We warmly recommend it.
2021-07-06,4,We came a few days ago on a Friday evening and loved the pizza. We got the margherita and white, both in personal sizes. They were delicious! It was extremely rainy that day, so I'm not sure if that's why we didn't have to wait to be seated, or if there usually is no crowd. The service was quick and mostly fine, but we were thrown away and a bit annoyed when, with our mouths full and a slice of pizza still left on the table, the server asked us if we were still working on the pizza or whether we wanted to take the rest to go. It felt rude and like we were being rushed out. She also handed us the check simultaneously asking if we wanted dessert. Despite this, we really enjoyed the pizza and definitely would come back for it.
2021-07-03,4,I ordered the Calzone here . It's filled with cheese and ham. It comes with a tomato dip and the combination of the two is amazing. It is a calzone for one but it's probably it's a bit too much for one person to finishing
2021-06-27,4,Love Grimaldi's. I wouldn't change a thing about the food here. The only thing I'd say to add a tiny bit of salt to the calzone. Other than that perfect pizza
2021-06-10,3,Pizza is very average! They look nicer than how they taste! But good service and good ambiance
2021-05-27,5,Grimaldi's is truly quite exceptional. The atmosphere is really fun and the staff is excellent. I will highly recommend Calzone, I had their Calzone and it was outstanding. Everybody was so friendly. Grimaldi's - We will be back!
2021-05-22,5,Taste better than it looks. I can't understand why it looks like that but I hesitated too when it got to the table. I asked for well done wings and well done they were. But the pizza... I didn't ask for it to be well done. We ordered pepperoni, meatballs, sausage, and half jalapeños for me. Other than the presentation I'm happy with the service. Really nice day today too so we sat outside. My server name is Bruno and he's been working the sidewalk all evening. He's the only server! Very pleasant and attentive.
2021-05-18,5,The best fancy pizza in Hoboken. You can always get a table and they have a full bar. We get the meatballs to start and then get a half marg half "Grimaldi's favorite."  Kills it every time. Trust me on this one.
2021-04-24,4,While enjoying this beautiful Saturday afternoon in Hoboken NJ,  my partner and I found this gem by happenstance and were very glad we did. When we arrived, there were patrons enjoying their meal inside. We were greeted by the owner Berna and informed her that we wanted to be in the sunlight with the cool breeze and people watching while eating al fresco as a table was waiting for us. Our waiter was Julio and we ordered a large margarita pizza. The pizza was made in their  hot coal oven which was absolutely delicious with genuine fresh mozzarella (not the shredded stuff in the supermarkets). The  basil was just right not overwhelming with the right amount of delicious sauce.  Kudos to chef Roberto! If you are in this area, we highly recommend this place.
2021-04-24,5,Grimaldi's White Pie is my favorite Pizza of all time. No Ricotta which is how its supposed to me made, lots of fresh Garlic. Best part is that it re-heats amazingly
2021-02-11,5,Best pizza in Hoboken. I shared the large margherita - delicious. Caesar salad also tasty.
2021-02-07,4,Great spot in Hoboken for some quality pizza.The crisp was great. The sauce was nice and tangy and the cheese was great. The pie was a bit on the doughy side for me.
2021-01-21,5,I knew a Piatelli that used to work here. Made a mean Philly-style Sangria. His mini-me version also worked here.
2021-01-06,4,I love pizza but I do not pretend to be an expert. I never understood the fuss about New York pizza. Now I get it. I had The Don. I've never had a meaty pizza that did not taste greasy and heavy. They somehow found a way to make it feel light and fresh. I'm looking forward to trying their other options. I do not understand why the other Grimaldi locations got 3 and 3.5 stars. If you're a New York pizza expert please educate me on where to find the best NY pizza.
2020-11-21,4,First of all let me just say besides brunch I LOVE LOVE PIZZA! If I was forced on an island and had only 3 choices of what I could eat forever pizza would be one. Get it !? So yeah, I love Grimaldi's in Brooklyn so I figured it would be a good place to go for dinner in Hoboken with my niece who hasn't had it before.Great choice! The service was good and they have heated outdoor seating. They are CoVid friendly as well. We were super hungry. My niece had the mozzarella cake as an appetizer. It must've been amazing because she took back to the hotel what she didn't finished and ate it the next morning and didn't share with me. The nerve , lol. I had a Caesar salad and the wings. Now the wings !!! So good. For our pizza we each had our own margarita special. Good as expected. If you like pizza and American fare food, this spot is for you !
2020-11-17,5,I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet. I order from here about once a week/once every two weeks-ish and I always get "The Don" pizza. The fried mozzarella cakes and caprese salad are also delicious. I've tried other pizza restaurants in Hoboken to try and switch things up or try something different, and each time I regretted it. Stick with what you know is good- Grimaldi's is it.
2020-11-08,5,Really great Margherita pizza and sauce! Great placed for a quick and casual meal. Offering indoor and outdoor seating with heats lamps.
2020-09-29,5,Excellent margherita pizza and good service if you're in Hoboken and are looking for a good pizza there's no need to look any further. The crust is phenomenal and not too thin that it's weighed down. Light and filling pizza that is delicious  You can have half a pie without feeling bloated.
2020-09-16,5,Good pizza and pasta.  Just like the Brooklyn place.  Great service. Nice crust.  Great tartufo dessert!
2020-08-21,3,The service was disappointing which made the meal and overall experience underwhelming. On our search through Hoboken to find a pizza spot, my sister and I stopped at Grimaldi's. Based off of the reviews and pictures, everything looked good. We ordered the buffalo wings and a Cesar salad for apps and a medium margherita pizza. Initially when we arrived there was no one outside to seat us so we went inside to make sure that it was okay to seat ourselves anywhere. When we were given the okay, our waitress grew visibly annoyed, went back inside, and put the menu away. Someone else ended up coming out and giving us the menus instead. My sister wanted garlic knots but they didn't serve any, which was surprising to me. She also wanted to order wings but was disappointed when she realized they only served buffalo wings. She still ordered and asked for ranch dressing in place of the blue cheese and they didn't have that either. Overall, the food was well prepared and satisfying but, again, the service was a thumbs down.
2020-08-02,1,Couple of employees who works inside of restaurant did not wear the mask properly like putting on his neck. They are handling the food.. so they need to wear the mask properly!!
2020-07-20,5,A true classic! Loved the delicate flavors and the freshness of the ingredients. Would love to try a lot more of their menu soon!
2020-06-29,4,They are doing outdoor sitting during the pandemic. I just love their plain pie so much. I usually order one large pie and share it with my husband. Sauce and cheese are great. In case you're curious, they are not byob.
2020-05-10,4,Been to Grimaldi's a few times and have always left satisfied. It's one of the better options for pizza in Hoboken. And with regard specifically to sit down pizza spots, Grimaldi's is one of the best.
2020-03-30,5,Seriously great pizza !! New York style, prices can be high for pizza here but well worth it
2020-03-15,5,Our party of 5 had a fabulous night. We were greeted and seated promptly.  Our drinks from the bar were delicious. I ordered the Massive Margarita and the rest of the table ordered Old Fashions. We got the Meatball appetizer and I highly recommend it. Absolutely delicious! We shared a large The Don pizza and still had two pieces left over! The chocolate Mousse dessert capped the night off for us. The service was great, the food was fabulous, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming. All in all a must visit if you're in the area.
2020-03-01,4,A quaint pizza shop with delicious pies!   An extensive bar, of course!  The employees are very friendly and attentive but not overbearing.   I would definitely come back again!  There are lots of other items on the menu too.  I would like to try some of the other dishes too!
2020-02-24,2,Hurts to give two stars, because everything we ordered tasted SO good. Unfortunately the major downfall was the prices and portion size.The chicken parm was absolutely delicious, but for $17 it was such a meager portion size. I've ordered chicken parm from pretty much every and anywhere in JC, Hoboken and beyond. This dish was about half the size of what I've received anywhere else for the same price. The pizza was also soo tasty, but $19 for a personal sized pie is just so high. That should be the price of a regular pie... We ordered the Grimaldi's Favorite which was topped with eggplant, ricotta and pepperoni. There were only a few tiny pepperoni cups on the entire pizza which was a bummer. Luckily wine and beer are cheap, but it's not enough to bring me back to Grimaldis. Given the high prices and small portions I do not see a reason to return.
2020-02-16,1,the food sucked. Everything was drowned in marinara sauce. Everything was plain and they tried to compensate for it with the sauce.
2020-02-02,5,Great place with old world feel.  Ordered basic pepperoni and cheese pizza for lunch.  Really nice pie cooked hot and fast in their coal burning oven.  Super delicious mozzarella, pepperoni and sauce.  Taken together with the awesome crust, they they make for just a super pizza.  Really enjoyed the food, old world, family feel of the place. Highly recommended--You'll be hard pressed to find a better pizza.
2020-01-30,4,Great Pizza, loved the crust and ingredients, except pepperoni which didn't seem fresh. Their eggplant parmigiana was good could be better by preparing it fresh with some more cheese. Great customer service
2020-01-01,4,Good classic Italian food. I would go back and recommend. Prices are reasonable and nice atmosphere.
2019-12-31,2,Food was really tasty and rich yet right after eating it, my boyfriend and I got really awful food poisoning. The meatballs tasted really funky but we thought that was just what it tasted like. Server never asked us how our food was, he was pretty much non-existent after we ordered our food even though there weren't many parties in the restaurant. We still have food poisoning which really sucks because we've been throwing up the food all night/day. We sat right next to the chef who kept sniffing and coughing while making the pizza but I don't think that was what caused the food poisoning.
2019-12-27,5,Best quality and tasting pizza in Hoboken and beyond. Nothing fancy just great fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection.
2019-12-20,4,I have found memories of eating here many many moons ago during my Jersey days. Now that we no longer live in the area, it's good to go back for a taste of a familiar memory. Grimaldi's is a pretty simple spot with simple dishes. I enjoy simplicity, and that includes in the form of a fresh margherita pizza. I swear they put something in the dough as there's always a three-slice consumption minimum every time we go there.
2019-12-06,2,A year later and pizza has gone downhill.  Sauce now flavorless water, crust all air bubbles instead of ingredients.  See pics.  For prices, this is now a flavorless mess.  Much better offerings in area.
2019-11-30,2,The pizza is fresh, however not a place for a family with infant. The host first said my stroller was no issue then stated it's a hazard to the place, while other couples had their strollers. The reason why we stayed regardless of the host, another sever was nice and attentive and settled us at a convenient area. Where my stroller wouldn't be a "hazard". Enjoy.
2019-11-23,5,Never fails at being the best pizza in Hoboken! Service could be better, but it isn't gonna stop me from eating there.
2019-11-08,5,This is my hands-down favorite pizza place. I've even hosted large groups here in their back room. Everyone leaves full of tasty pizza and very happy thanks to the beer list and reasonable prices. It's also nice to go to a place where you ask them to fire more pies and not wait for ages before going in for round 2 or 3... or 4. Seriously, my crew was hungry and very impressed by the pizza.
2019-10-18,3,It's the okay place. We had a signature pizza called a slice of Heaven. It was a thin crust pizza. But I don't think it was worth $26 (medium). I did not find their pizza to be that much better than other places in Hoboken. They had decent cannolis. The service was average. They only give us one napkin each until we asked for more. They should know eating pizza can be quiet messy, so they should provide more napkins. We were the only customer there on Friday lunchtime, which was strange. I probably would not go back.
2019-10-17,5,Amazing! The wait can be a little while but def worth it! One of my favorite pizza places in the City.
2019-10-17,5,Visiting from out of town and wanted some good pizza. We really enjoyed our dinner at this establishment. Service was great!!!!!
2019-09-08,2,The meatballs were ehhh. The green salad was okay. The pizza was slightly over cooked with a burnt crust. Overall, the menu is small with limited options. I was also looking for other kids of pasta, but they only had spaghetti.
2019-08-24,1,Don't get the pasta!! We got a meatball pasta and it was absolutely terrible. The meat tasted wrong. I will never come back.
2019-08-23,1,Love their pizza but one star for them due to customer service. We were delivered an incorrect pizza 8/23. We ordered a white pizza and received one with toppings and sauce. We live in jersey city so not a crazy commute but in Friday traffic it's not ideal to go to Hoboken. We call and tell them what had happened and the girl on the phone first didn't believe us, then wanted us to commute back over there for a new pizza in 30-40 minutes. In addition to that, she also asked that we save the pizza so that they can pick it up. At this point my fiancé, already ate a slice because he was hungry and didn't want to wait 40 minutes. She said they can't "just be giving away free pizza and that they were going to try to reuse it" LOL. When my fiancé said that he had taken a slice the girl on the phone said they still need to pick it up to "give it to homeless people". We were not looking for "free pizza" but our order was incorrect by your mistake and now we need to wait another hour. Here is your photo of your incorrect pizza. Your customer service sucks.
2019-08-17,3,Good food but little bit pricey. Manager and staff are good. Good and fast service. Upon our request they set up everything outside despite it was very busy day for them.
2019-08-15,4,It is a cool place for pizza and chicken wings. The meat balls was really good and is a must to try. As for the pizza, I feel that the choice was quite limited. So we went with the meaty one and it was good. This is the first time in 3 months I last have pizza.
2019-08-07,4,What a fabulous place! Affordable and delicious! A great place for New York style pizza! One pizza is enough to share between two and same with the salad! Highly recommend!
2019-08-03,2,We always enjoy co.ing here but tonight's experience was awful. We decided to sit at the bar. Food was excellent,  service not so much. This guy was distracted. Had to ask for EVERYTHING, including silverware. Seems too interested in having the bar ready to close his shift than the customers. Awful service!!
2019-07-28,1,bad service, grumpy staff... horrible atmosphere.I kept telling the waiter that the Coke was flat, and he fought me back about it. They barely took care us and the place was empty.  I don't recommend this restaurant here in Hoboken. You Can find better service and much better pizza in this area.
2019-07-22,2,Waitress and owner not too nice. Food was served cold, had to have them reheat it only to be served semi-warm. After living in the area all my life decided to  try them out on my 51st birthday  for the first time. Will never go back, what a shame this situation could not have been handled in a professional manner.
2019-06-23,5,Wow!! how have I not rated Grimaldis in Hoboken?! They are the best!!! And, boy, I feel spoiled and blessed that I can eat this incredible pizza almost any time.  I have shared it with many guests visiting from out of town and out of the country to share what I consider some on the best local 'NYC' style pizza there is!! And they've all agreed!!  I love that the pizza is so balanced with a perfect crust, sauce and cheese and toppings that are all so fresh, homemade and superb. They never disappoint. I also love that their pizza crust and toppings never feel greasy and are so satisfying and flavorful at the same time. Years later, whenever I bite into their pizza, I always say to myself halfway through 'Man, that's GOOD!!' For a while, I ordered either the margarita or a pizza with roasted red peppers and Italian sausage and I loved both!! Tonight I ordered the pepperoni with extra garlic (based on a fellow yelper's recommendation ) and it is absolutely divine!! Their dough is slightly charred on the outside and a touch chewy and delicious. Their cheese is homemade mutz and the sauce is perfect!! Their Cesar salad is so tasty too and I don't even like salad; and I definitely don't like an overly dressed salad but this is just perfect. Their service is always kind and warm. Thank you Grimaldis for making greatness daily and feeding your community such delicious and high quality food!! So grateful for you!!
2019-06-10,4,Nice place to eat. It was very quiet , 2pm. This was my 1st time in . Pizza was good... Honestly it needed for spices / flavor to me but I guess that's why they give us garlic, oregano , salt and pepper....  not NEARLY enough cheese and I asked the server if I needed to order extra cheese!
2019-05-10,4,Very good pizza and great eggplant parm. Crust is charred while the floured crust is Amercan as opposed to Naples. Really good and big pies for the dough.  Hah. New place, had fun, and ate good pizzzzzzza. Ahhhh.
2019-04-29,5,Best pizza in Hoboken and possibly the world. I could eat this pizza every day for the rest of my life and I would be seriously content. The mozzarella is fresh and generously topped on brick oven crust. I order the regular pizza with garlic. Good quality ingredients keep me coming back (frankly cause I'm addicted) The wings are also really freaking good. the sauce is tangy and unique but still hits all the essential buffalo sauce flavors. They also manage to stay crisp even upon, delivery which is impressive. One tip, The garlic bread is not garlic bread, it's a naked pizza with butter and garlic. It's not terrible but it's not garlic bread per say, and I wouldn't order it again- but it really doesn't matter to me their pizza is everything. The Salads are yummy too, I like the mixed greens with pears.
2019-04-25,5,I love Italian food, and I certainly love a good pizza! I mean, who doesn't?Pizza is life! & Grimaldi's has the best bricked oven pizza in town. I've tried many, and they don't compare. Good date night spot! Food is good, drinks are good, ambiance is good.I recommend you try the buffalo pizza. If not, you can never go wrong with a pepperoni or plain cheese (extra cheese please!)
2019-04-07,1,I love the pizza, let me start there. But this location has given me some issues. They love to burn the pizza. I think it's there thing. A month ago I ordered a pie and they gave it that black top bottom that I believe nobody likes... except the guy who's doing this. I'm not into carcinogens. But who knows, maybe I'll acquire a liking if I keep ordering here. Last weekend I returned for more figuring they couldn't do worse... wrong! This time the burn the bottom and top. I called them to complain and they said they would refund me or I can bring pizza back and get a new one. That's fair, but I live outside of Hoboken and they should be offering to do one of several things: 1- bring me the damn pie to my place, 2- provide some sort of compensation for having to return to the scene of the crime twice. They offered neither but did apologize (glad they had this in them). Let's say I'm going to take my business elsewhere. This formula of pizza can be had in edgewater. Or I'll just eat at Zero Otto nearby. Unless I'm in a mood to eat charcoal and return back several times.
2019-03-28,5,They have the best brick oven pizza ever. I've been a regular here and they deliver consistent quality. I think they remodeled their menus awhile ago and price has gone up a lot though. But I still love their pizza. Their dough is chewy, they put a lot of toppings and their ingredients are so fresh. Salads and appetizers are all great as well. I've been to a lot of brick ovens and this truly is one of the best. I just wish they hadn't raised the price so much. It's a pretty low key restaurant but it's not boyb. They are supposed to be trained by Grimaldi's and it's definitely better than the one in dumbo!
2019-03-25,5,LOVE Grimaldi's! Their pizza is great! We have been here a few times. It's great every time we come. Service is pretty good. Most recently we had the breakfast pizza with eggs, cheese, and bacon. SO good! Cooked perfectly. Crust had a good crunch. The pizza was not soggy. Only thing I would have changed it just more bacon! And I wish the breakfast pizza came in a larger size besides personal. We will return to try more menu items. Love all their pizzas though! Brick oven is fantastic.
2019-03-20,4,Great fresh pizza!  Been to other location and this one is cute and small. The meatballs we're delish as well.
2019-03-14,5,Best pizza in Hoboken.  This is the first place I take everyone from out of town to.  Run by the same management as the original location in Dumbo.  The pizza is just as good, and best of all - no wait!  Quick service.  Great atmosphere.
2019-03-08,1,Horrible business practice! We order various pizzas from them every Friday for the office. They sent 2 of the wrong pizzas and offered to send over the toppings. Who on earth would add cooked toppings to a pizza?! That's not how you eat pizza. They refused to let us start to eat the wrong pizzas since it would take a while to get us the correct ones and we were going into a meeting. Telling me I wanted "free" pizza, when all I wanted was what we ordered and paid for. This sucks because I always loved Grimaldi's however, they have left a bad taste in our mouth. What happened with "the customer is always right"?! The guy from Grimaldi's was yelling at me on the phone. Just crazy that they treat customers like this! UPDATE: we got the 2 new pizzas and the other 2 were taken away. The 2 new ones weren't cooked through, soggy and wet, we had to toss them!
2019-01-27,1,Worst service EVER!! Couldn't give a zero or I would have!! Took two hours to get my cold pizza!! They called me 3 times because they couldn't figure how to get to my address!!! I'm 2.6 miles away!!And all that for my $32.00 pizza!! What a joke this place is!! Never ordering from them again!
2019-01-26,5,Pizza was actually pretty good. Get the white pie!!! I enjoyed going there to eat as well as takeout
2019-01-15,5,I'm very picky when it comes to Italian food, but this place nails it.  I had the cheese ravioli which was delicious and so is the bread and the service is great.  Not to mention the killer playlist too.  Good place to stop for a pizza or pasta dish.Yum!
2019-01-02,5,The best pizza we've had in a long time. Service was so friendly and welcoming and recommended a tasty Grimaldi's IPA! Highly recommend!
2019-01-01,4,Great Izzy and salad was fresh. Friendly and prompt service. Would come back as well as recvommend
2018-12-27,5,I am super super picky when it comes to pizza. I usually don't like to go for pizza because odds are I won't be impressed (unless I've had a few drinks and in that case all pizza impressed me) but the plain pizza and the meatball pizza at Grimaldi's was SO delicious. First of all, it came out so fast. It was thin crust but NOT burnt, which is my most important pizza cardinal rule. Usually you have to pick either unmelted cheese or burnt pizza but this cheese was perfectly melted without burnt crust. Also, the ratio of sauce to cheese was perfect and the sauce was just the right amount of sweet. Would definitely go to again if I'm in the area.
2018-12-14,1,I came in with my husband and 4yr old daughter at 4pm on a Friday. There were only two other tables in the restaurant so it was pretty empty. It took an hour for us to get our pizza. I would understand if the place was busy but it was empty and you could see that they were busy with some catering order. After waiting about a half hour (the other tables had left already so we literally were the only ones in the restaurant) our waiter said sorry for the delay and that they were backed up. Backed up? The place was empty but ok... So while waiting, 2 more tables came in. At the 1 hour mark I was angry and asked where our pizza was and the waiter apologized and said another 2 minutes. Was he serious? Then one of the tables that had come in after us, got their pizza. Umm what? Btw all we ordered was a plain medium pie. Finally...we get our pizza and the 2nd table that had come in after us got their pizza within minutes after we received ours. When the pizza finally came, it wasn't well done like we had asked. No real apology or anything. Needless to say I won't be back. Horrible service. Disappointing because it was my belated Birthday dinner with my daughter and husband. I usually love Grimaldi's and was really looking forward to it but unfortunately I won't ever be back.
2018-12-11,5,It was my husband's treat and he suggested this pizza place. I have been to this are before but never tried this pizza. It was on monday night, it was almost empty when arrived but got almost filled when we were leaving. We ordered one medium sausage and pepperoni pizza. It dint take too long to arrive and also we were sitting next next to the brick oven so waiting was worth of it. The pizza itself was great, tasted delicious. I am definitely coming here again.
2018-12-10,4,Came here with our son after a Saint Peter's Basketball game.  What was so ironic is I picked this randomly based on reviews (of course), however once we arrived my son mentions (later) that someone on the coaching staff at SPU suggested this place as well.   Why favorite son did not mentioned this when we were looking for a place to eat I'll never know.   Gessh...kids.    Anyway, the guys order "The Don" Pizza - if you're a meat lover then this is the pie for you.  I ordered a personal pan white pizza with garlic.  I asked if they could add spinach which they did.  I also order a "hot toddy" which wasn't bad on this cold wintery day.  As always in the city, parking is difficult - we just happen to luck out that day.  The place is located in Hoboken on their main street which has cute little shops.    Overall the food was good and would come again.
2018-12-01,5,Relaxed cozy and delicious pizza. My wife and I enjoyed a "slice of heaven quote Pizza and it was very good... Fresh mozzarella and one of the few pies that I've had recently that manage to put a lot of vegetables on the pie without making it wet and soggy. Mamosa wasn't too sweet. Get his breath was served properly with a perfect head. Also this pizzeria is on I'm very "touristy" Street but Doesn't feel touristy it'll definitely coming back
2018-11-27,4,We order from Grimaldi's every time we visit family in Hoboken. Their brick oven pizza is fantastic. We usually get a cheese pie, a veggie, and a pepperoni.  They've all been fantastic.
2018-11-17,2,Below average pizza.  Limited menu. Service is mediocre.Blah blah blah need enough characters to count as a review
2018-11-11,4,Delicious pizza! It is pricey for a pie but the crust is the perfect thinness and so flavorful with the coal brick oven. Gotta agree the slice of heaven really is worthy of the name. Definitely check out this location which isn't as crazy as the original. A nice quaint setting and you can watch the pies being made.
2018-11-08,2,I'm surprised this place is reviewed so highly. I had a medium pizza with sliced tomatoes. It was quite soggy & needed more cheese. My pizza looked nothing like the other reviews I'm seeing on here.
2018-09-26,5,Never got to try Grimaldi's in Brooklyn due to the constant long lines. So when we saw that this location had plenty of seating on a Saturday night, had to jump at the opportunity.Got a table for two outside and was soon greeted by our server to take our orders. To start off, had the Meatballs in marinara sauce ($7.50) - three large semi-spicy meatballs drowning in a thick red sauce. Dish is simple and satisfied my meat craving before heading to the main course. Between two people: ordered a bottle of Chilean red ($22), as well as a Medium Pizza with eggplant/jalapenos on one side and spinach/banana peppers on the other ($25ish). When the food came out, the waitress had gotten us a large instead of a medium pie (which they fixed at the medium pie price, nice!). Peppers balanced out the sweetness in the sauce and veggies. Just the right amount of cheese on top, and no burnt crust to deal with. Wine went well with everything, though it was a lower ABV than we were expecting for a red (12%)Waitress did a solid job despite the mixup that worked in our favor. Was glad I was able to try the pizza here; maybe can visit one of the New York locations.
2018-09-15,4,Always a great experience.  Very nice bar, good food and good drinks.  Their sausage pizza has nice clumps of sausage and overall the pizza is very tasty.  Would prefer thinner crust but still very good.
2018-09-09,5,Came here with a group of 4 the large buffalo chicken and large garlic bread was enough for the group.Both the pizza and garlic bread are excellent fluffy and delicious. Now I don't usually like marinara sauce that much but the marinara sauce we had that accompanied this was amazing, it had a spicy kick and just tasted great.Very reasonably priced and excellent food, recommend coming here anytime, really great pizza!
2018-09-09,5,Let me start off by saying I am a ranch with pizza person, and when ranch isn't available I feel sad and immediately disappointed in my pizza experience. This was my initial feeling at Grimaldi's. However when the garlic bread (which is a pizza with garlic deliciousness on it) and the bacon buffalo chicken pizza were served ranch was the last thing in my mind. It was better than delicious and the thought if ranch disapated as I stuffed my face with the delightful garlic bread and pizza. I would go back weekly if I lived closer and try their entire menu. Go, you won't be sorry.
2018-09-06,3,Overrated pizza joint. The food is mediocre and lacks creativity. It struggles to be authentic and traditional, and is far from modern. However, their to-go Tiramisu cup is a bright spot on the menu. The decor retains the old school feel of Italian restaurants.  A plus point is that it has a bar and saves the hassle of a BYOB.
2018-08-28,4,Pizza was good, very good! But nothing like the dumbo location. For Hoboken pizza, it was amazing! The ingredients were fresh, sauce was okay. Overall delicious,but if you've been to Grimaldi's in dumbo you know it's not the same :(
2018-08-27,5,This is our go to pizza place that we take all of our out of town guests.  Whether we are entertaining vegetarians, gluten free or meat eating carb lovers, this place is able to satisfy.  The service is friendly and the pizza is really good.  After pizza, we walk along the river to show our guests the magnificent skyline.
2018-08-24,2,What happened??  I haven't been here in 3 or 4 years. Quality of the pizza has DEFINITELY deteriorated. The crust was super dry. And actually had a slight "wet sponge" smell/ taste. The cheese buffalo mozzarella on the margarita pizza was rubbery - not as soft and creamy as it used to be. And the sauce...bitter...and barely any on their. Great service but..What a shame.
2018-08-20,5,Ordered a margherita pizza, and I have to admit it's one of best that I ever had. The mutz is fresh and plenty. The sauce is not too sweet.
2018-08-19,4,Have been here a few times now. They definitely live up to their reputation of being one of the better pizza places in the NY/NJ area. We have tried the garlic bread which is very crunchy. You can get a make your own pizza of your desirable size (S/M/L) and any number of toppings. The quantity of cheese and crust size is appropriate which makes it really good. The ambience is really good too. There are also a lot of glutten free options.
2018-08-10,4,I loved their Margherita pie. I also ordered a Mudslide drink, but it was more of a Chocolate Martini. My friend got the Chocolate Mousse. It's nice inside, if you come on a Friday night there might be a little wait.
2018-08-05,3,Decent (albeit pricey) pizza, mediocre service.We arrived for an early dinner on a Sunday evening, and we were seated in the back due to most of the front seating being filled. Perhaps due to that, we were infrequently attended to--the food came out fairly quickly, but the general service and flagging down of someone for the check were a bit lacking. As for the food, the meatballs were decent and the garlic bread humongous (although I wish it was a bit more garlicky/flavorful). The pizzas (the Don and a custom made one) were not bad, the dough a bit too chewy but overall reasonably tasting, but noting particularly special and kind of pricey.
2018-07-28,1,Worse Grimaldis I have been to. The waiter sat me in the back and then left me there, never came back to take my order. I had to call someone 15 mins later
2018-07-25,4,Food was absolutely amazing but the past few times I've been here the staff wasn't very sociable/friendly and they  didn't give us silverware to eat with our food. Other than that, this is a great place for a lunch break or a nice dinner with friends!
2018-07-22,5,This is my absolute favorite pizza place. We're not from Hoboken but we have friends that do and we look forward to getting Grimaldi's pizza when we come to visit! Last weekend we came in split a large The Don pizza which is topped with Italian sausage, meatball and pepperoni and it was amazing! The food is great every time we come here.
2018-07-22,4,Stopped in for a snack and wine. The eggplant parm app was very good but a touch too salty.
2018-07-17,5,On Sunday, I ate at Grimaldis with my wife. The restaurant has an undeniable cute, hometown-ish vibe. We're from Weehawken, and come to Hoboken often for dinner, but have yet to check out this place. We were definitely not disappointed! We ordered The Don and meatballs and both were delicious, and came out very quickly on the busy night. Our server -- Sophia was extremely friendly and polite, and helped us with both questions regarding the menu. We will definitely be back.
2018-07-08,1,Medium Don - $25Medium White - $16.25Medium Half Don, Half White - $27.25This is how Grimaldi prices!
2018-06-16,4,LOTS OF YUMS! Walking down Washington Avenue, there are a ton of options, but nothing compares to pizza when it comes to sharing food! We ordered a margherita pie and the eggplant parm. I don't usually seek out Italian food when eating out, but this was a wonderful experience! The food came out really fast, and the portion was large. The pizza was so so good, one of the best margherita pizzas in recent memory, and the eggplant parm is also cooked with lots of flavors in the sauce and cheeeeeeese. And it only came out to $12.50 after tax and tips per person. Totally would recommend for your next adventure in Hoboken! Also they have $10 off any bottle of wine if that's what you are into
2018-06-13,5,Honestly, wow. This was so good and at such a reasonable price as well! The pizza was so amazingly fresh, and the mozzarella! ah! We got the meatballs based on previous reviews as well and they were AMAZING! Plus they are right down the street from Carlo's Bakery if you want to stop in and get a cannoli on the way home! (which is what I did if you couldn't tell). HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Love it!
2018-06-04,5,This is the place for great Brick oven pizza, cozy place nice bar good atmosphere.
2018-06-02,4,It's the real deal.  Excellent pizza, meatballs, marinara.  Quality ingredients.  Good service.  Nice location--better than NYC as in more calm, less parking & traffic issues.  Tables were clean but sticky (effects of excessive chlorine use perhaps).  Needs new furniture. Definitely coming back.  Thank you.
2018-05-23,4,Oven fresh 2 large pizzas. 5/5 on no oozing oil! Could use a little more flavor in their basic pizza. Pizza was also burnt on the backside. Not fond of tasting that. Maybe clean out the ash in their oven? Overall, it was good pizza.
2018-05-22,5,Best pizza in hoboken hands down. We go here often and never have any complaints. We also had an welcome family dinner event upstairs before our wedding day. All the out of towners said the pizza was the best they ever had. The staff were great and very attentive to all of our guests. I called ahead and placed the order of everything we wanted to serve. Once we all arrived, the staff brought out all of our food timely.  This made everything so easy and we got to spend time mingling with everyone.
2018-05-16,4,This place never disappoints. Great wood oven pizza. The only downside is the veggie pie gets very watery in the middle. So by default, we go with plain cheese. Mozzarella sticks were also good.
2018-05-02,4,More of a 'fancy' pizza and not just your plain pie.  However it was probably one of the better pie I've had.
2018-04-27,4,A great place to bring family and friends, they were originally on 2nd & Clinton and as demand increased they relocated to 4th & Washington St I would recommend the Italian sausage and pepperoni  on a large pie $16.99 +$7.00 (2 toppings), they also offer gluten free. I would also recommend their buffalo wings ($10), they accept cash or credit and they do not sell slices only pies. They are family and kid friendly and they have a coal oven which makes the pizza delicious. They also have a back room in the back if you plan on holding a party. When it's warm they offer outdoor seating as well. Enjoy!
2018-04-23,5,What a great little spot. Grimaldi's is a Hoboken staple. We tend to do date night here because it's cozy, authentic, and delicious. Meatballs are a must have. They have the best sauce - the fennel makes it so great and flavorful. We always sit at the bar and love the service of the bartenders. They're always so nice and helpful. Two suggestions: if you get the meatballs as a pizza, save the sauce from the meatballs to dip your pizza in. Their pizza sauce isn't very flavorful but the meatball sauce is VERY delicious. Also, the white pie has chopped onions on top of the pie - not cooked into the pizza. It's crunchy snd not my style. Make sure you tell them not to put the onions on top if you're like me snd can't really eat raw onions like that.
2018-04-14,1,This evening we had guests from Italy in town and thought it would be great to bring them here, we had reservations for a party of 6. We checked in on time, no problem. They then sat us upstairs at a table that was for 4 people, for which we had to cram in, not to mention also it was in a main thoroughfare walkway so our guests kept getting bumped into. After we placed our orders and our drinks had arrive, a woman came over and told us to move tables.  We politely said we'd rather not move (to an even smaller table in which the woman said she'd put a chair on the end) to the other table and stay there.  The woman very rudely insisted we must move and that there was a larger table ($$$) she needed to make room for. Honestly I find that to be in poor taste in the sense that, we made reservations a week in advance and you should have planned better to accommodate this party.  Not only that, but not one person apologized for the inconvenience it caused and in fact sadly begged us to move. After we did end up moving, the poor server was overwhelmed because it was in his section and gave us zero attention after. Needless to say we probably will not be patronizing this location anymore and it is clear that money is more important than customer service here
2018-04-11,5,Great place.  Small but good food and very enjoyable.  Full bar but mix drinks is not their forte.  I would recommend as a great place for the fire cooked pizza.
2018-03-14,3,On a windy snowy northeaster evening, my wife and decided to have an Italian pizza in the neighborhood. Never been before at Grimaldi's, the place was full of the usual Hoboken crowd and we got a table next to the kitchen in the back. The dining room seemed warm and cozy feel, ambiance is nice. We both ordered each our own pizza, my wife liked hers, I was not so crazy about mine. It was kind of  doughy and soft, and stingy with the extra, altogether not closed to some of the best pizzas I ate in NYC, like at Patsy's in East Harlem, or Keste, John's of Bleeker st.   in the village. So it was ok, nothing extraordinary and  maybe this side of the Hudson for the locals who stay here and don't travel Grimaldi is their best choice on that side.By the way it looked like all the working staff in kitchen,  bartender, waiters came from south LA. So much for an Italian flavor.
2018-03-13,2,I am an admitted pizza snob born and raised in Brooklyn (yes we make the best pizza in the world - get over it). I had a personal pie with anchovies. The sauce wasn't bad - tasted like real Italian tomatoes - but the praise ends there.  The cheese was minimal and burnt, which I can forgive; the crust however was pretty bad. It was gooey chewy and had no crisp, at all. I don't know if it is the dough formulation and/or the yeast they use - but seriously the pie crust was terrible. It made what looked like a really good pizza a really bad pizza. I think the only reason the place does so well is because it does a great job of creating the appearance of a real Brooklyn pizza place, they have no competition, and the locals don't know any better. Seriously, the pizza is not good.
2018-02-11,2,One word: Overrated. I really wasn't a fan of their sauce. I expected much better. Try not tp go on peak hours as there can be long waiting times.
2018-02-03,1,Beware their menu card mentions that gratuity is charged for people 6 and above but they charged us 20% gratuity for a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 small kids).On being pointed out they calmly apologized that their menu cards had not been updated as yet.Felt Ripped!!We ordered their garden pizza only to realize too late that the pizza had no pizza sauce n just veggies!Not going again!!
2018-01-26,4,Grimaldi's is a cute Italian place in Hoboken a little far from the waterfront and the bars. It has street parking in the area and is a 15 minute walk from the train station/path. The service was good and our waiter was very helpful. I didn't think it was anything super special. The pizza was good and the fried mozzarella was too. Overall, I would say that it's a good Italian place if everything else is crowded and options are limited. There are definitely better Italian places in Hoboken.
2018-01-19,5,Grimaldi's in Hoboken is the real deal. Friendly, family oriented staff. Incredible food... pizza and wings are off the charts. Love this spot and will keep coming back!
2018-01-15,5,This is my favorite eat-in pizza joint. Hot and bubbly, fresh from the oven... you just can't beat it. I find that Grimaldi's pizza doesn't heat up that well the next day though, so you may as well just eat it all while you're there. House salad is also really good, and their chicken wings are my favorite in town. Order 'em 'well done'!
2018-01-13,4,Had a take out order. Food took longer than expected and waited a little when arrived but pizza was great quality pizza !! My bf and I really enjoyed it. Deducted a star because they need to update the prices on their website.
2018-01-02,5,I believe I have been to every Grimaldi's (and associated offshoot) locations in the north east.Hoboken is my favorite, by a wide margin.The food is the standard Grimaldi's menu, and lives up to the reputation. The space i wonderful. The bar is spacious, the beer list is fantastic, and the service is top notch.
2017-12-06,4,Pizza was very good.  Ordered "The Dom" it had pepperoni, sausage, and fresh mozzarella.  It was a nice slice of pizza follwed by a nice sip of a cold beer,.
2017-11-29,5,One of my favorite brick oven pizzas in Hoboken! So many options and toppings, and the large pizzas are huge. The pizzas at Grimaldi's have always been perfectly cooked, Caesar salads are also very tasty.
2017-11-27,5,Love this place! As a New York native I have had grimaldis pizza before. Usuallly getting grimaldis includes an unreasonable wait time for delicious food. The Hoboken location offers that same deliciousness without that pesky wait. Came here on a Sunday night around 6pm and was seated immediately. I had a pretty big brunch so I wasn't too hungry. My friend and I ordered a personal size of the grimaldis favorite pizza (I apologize I don't remember if that's the actual name of the pizza) it came with pepperoni, eggplant, ricotta cheese and fresh mozzarella. The pizza came with 4, perfectly sized slices. The eggplant was perfectly breaded and crispy, when added along with the other toppings created a combination of my 2 favorite foods- pizza and eggplant parm. It was such a delicious pizza I wish I could eat it all the time. My experience here was fantastic! Our waitress was super friendly and nice, there was no wait time (a big plus in my book) and our food came out super quickly. I will definitely be back!
2017-11-27,3,Didn't really enjoy the pizza that much. The sauce was very watery and mild and the toppings were mediocre tasting. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing! Down to try it again but probably the New York location. The crust and cheese were really good but again the sauce was not flavorful enough. Service was great
2017-11-21,4,Great NY style . Def a go to pizza spot in Hoboken. They have two locations. Both are good.
2017-11-19,4,Moved To Hoboken a few years ago and hadn't tried Grimaldi's until yesterday. Dude.. I've been missing out!! Do it
2017-11-13,3,When you walk into Grimaldi's you will get the feeling its a cute little romantic place at least at night for dinner.  All the reviews and the area local hailed Grimaldi's as one of the best pizza in hoboken.  Although I will say it's pretty good I don't know if it's in the best category yet.  When we got in we were escorted to the upstairs private room which has an even nicer feel to it for a date night.  We were promptly seated and the waiters were available right away. We decided to go with some wine to start of the night.   Now we get to the food we decided to try the garlic bread with Grimaldi sauce and the caesar salad for starters with Italian dressing.  The garlic bread was pretty good and so was the salad I did enjoy both.   The garlic bread with Grimaldi sauce as a dip was what made it without the sauce I don't know how much I would have liked it other wise.  One thing that didn't disappoint was the portion size the garlic bread was pretty big and filling.  Once we got done with the apps we decided to order a personal pie with jalapenos, onions, olives, and green peppers.  Now the pizzas hype wasn't all there but I still enjoyed the pie.  For dessert we went with the Tartufo but this one missed the mark a little bit.  Although it wasn't the greatest experience (maybe I was influenced by the hype) the food was good and the ambience was nice.  Still made for a cute date night!  I would say if you're in the area who knows maybe this style of pizza might be your thing.   But be warey don't make the mistake of expecting too much and give it an honest try and see for yourself.
2017-11-13,3,3 stars is about right. The sauce is pretty bland and did not taste like much of anything. The pizza isnt bad but not sure it is 4 star.  The crust is chewy and has a good texture.Not my top choice in hoboken but extra bonus points for the upstairs private room. In hoboken there are not many places with a private room so definitely a bonus.
2017-11-08,3,This place does have good food but I must say it's somewhat overpriced.    Ordered a large calzone and 2 toppings.   $30, really.  Too many other option in Hoboken too pay that much.  Sorry, good but too pricey.
2017-11-07,5,This place is the ultimate coal oven thin slice pizza restaurant.  We got the sausage, meatball and pepperoni large, and it was perfection.  Love that the sausage is the crumbled kind - not chunks and the pepperoni is legit slices.  The only downside is that this pizza doesn't do well as take out/leftovers because it's so thing.  Best to be eaten immediately at the restaurant.
2017-10-21,2,Not sure what I was expecting when I came here, but then again, I came here on a Sunday during Memorial Weekend. It was very busy. My boyfriend and I came here because I wanted to go to sit-in pizza restaurant. We saw this place on Yelp and decided to try it. When we came, there was a family of 6 before us who seemed to have been waiting for a while. It took about 10 minutes for us to get seated. The manager/owner asked where we would like to sit, but we didn't mind since I felt bad that it was busy. She brought us upstairs and boy, was that a mistake. The upstairs is mostly for bigger amounts of guests while the middle seating had tables for 2-4 people. It was extremely loud. This wasn't even the bad part though.It took about 30 minutes just for someone to get our order. I am not even exaggerating. There seemed to be only one waiter for all the tables and she was having a hard time. I felt extremely bad for the waitress, but she seemed to not know how to manage her time or organize herself. What made the experience worse though was that the table to our left came 10-15 minutes after us and got their order even before us. They also got their food before us and the family of 6 who were in line before my boyfriend and I. The family before us complained to the owner who apologized, yet said that they were short staff. From what I've learned, the owner should never make an excuse, especially saying their short staffed.Finally after an hour of being there, we got our food. We ordered a pizza with one half with bacon and the other with mushroom. We ordered a large with the two separate toppings that came out to $28. It's moderately priced, but a little more expensive than the usual. The pizza was not too bad. I was satisfied with it. The cheese they use is amazing. The cheese has such great flavor. The sauce, however, was not to our liking. It was opposite of the cheese where it didn't have enough flavor for me. Other than that, the pizza was good. Yet, even with a good pizza, the service did not hold up. It was probably just a bad day for them.
2017-10-08,4,We went here for lunch and sat outside. The pizza was delicious. We had the pizza with pepperoni and extra cheese. And it was fantastic. Service was super quick. They also had drink specials that day. Mismosas and beers were discounted.
2017-10-07,3,We ordered a white pizza and unfortunately it lacked in flavor and hardly had any ricotta cheese. Pizza is good but I think there are other better options in Hoboken like Napoli's and Johnny.
2017-09-25,5,So my husband and I did a maternity shoot in Jersey City on a hot day yesterday & we were starving right after. My pizza lovin friend recommended oven brick pizza at Grimaldis and of course who could say no to pizza?? We fell in love with the place!!!As soon as we walked in, we were seated by the AC. The waitress took our drink orders and was very attentive!!! We ended up ordering a large pie with extra fresh mozzarella, chicken, & pepperoni and let me tell you OMG! DELICIOUS! Its not better than the Pizza in Italy but it was close enough!
2017-09-22,5,Delicious!! Their pizza is amazing! Went for dinner and ordered a bottle of chianti, antipasto to start and a medium pizza. Highly recommend.
2017-09-21,4,I have been coming here for years. They have good pizzas with thin and tasty crust. The mozzarella is awesome and delicious. We got a medium pizza with sausage and mushroom. Tl;Dr Awesome pizza joint. We will probably come here more often now since razza is now constantly busy from their recent NYT praise.
2017-09-21,4,Has been one of the best pizza places in Hoboken for quite a while.  When the old location closed I was skeptical.  But the Washington st location has continued to step up their game.  Grimaldi's pizza is a staple in our house for Friday movie night.
2017-09-19,5,Very good pizza! We ordered "The Don!" and enjoyed it. On tap, a local Oktoberfest Bier. For dessert, SPUMONI (yum)!  We will definitely visit again.
2017-09-11,3,I'd like to believe I'm a pizza connoisseur (don't fight me on this one!) so obviously when in Hoboks, one must try Grimaldi's. All the hype plus fab reviews on Yelp... very little room for disappointment, right?! Let's start with the essential. When you come to Grimaldi's, you come for 'za. There's three sizes: personal, medium, and large. There's a wide selection of toppings to choose from, but prices could easily add up. We did a personal with 4 veggies, which was $8 for toppings and the pizza itself was $9.75. The jalapeños are a new addition (not found on the menu). They were a bit too vinegary for my liking (but I usually love that vinegary taste?!). Overall, the pizza was good, but nothing I'd rave about. We also had the Caesar salad and garlic bread, which were mediocre. We tried their famous Grimaldi sauce with the garlic bread. I don't know about you, but sauce always sets the precedent of whether or not I'm going to like a place. The sauce here were a bit short of extraordinary though. The interior was simple and cute, similar to a typical restaurant in Italy. The service was amazing. Kudos to the thoughtful busboy with a keen eye for detail for noticing our table was slightly wobbling and decided to fix it immediately. I honestly didn't even notice it until he came over, and I was very impressed at how observant and proactive he was!
2017-09-10,2,I wasn't impressed by this Italian style pizza. It was very sloppy and dough felt like rubber. Sorry only 2 stars.
2017-08-29,5,Love Grimaldi's! Their ingredients are fresh, the pizza crust is perfectly cooked, and the service is always fast! I've been here a few times and the food/service has been consistently great. Can't wait to go back!
2017-08-21,5,After my last review I avoided Grimaldis for a while.  However, I decided to give them another shot and have been very impressed.I particularly love their crust which is flavorful with a nice chew.  I also appreciate that their sauce is not overly sweet.  I would recommend eating in or picking up to get the pizza nice and fresh.
2017-08-20,5,My friend and I shared a personal pizza which was more than enough for two people to share or one person if you want leftovers. The crust was perfectly crispy and the cheese was melty. Service was great - no wait, seated quickly and promptly seen to! I'll definitely be coming back!
2017-08-16,5,Great food! I went there last night and was seated right away. We got "The Don" pizza, which was AMAZING. Service was great wand had indoor/ outdoor seating. Highly recommend this place.
2017-07-30,4,I'm a big fan of Grimaldis pizza. In TX and other southern locations!the menu is consistent. The Hoboken location still offers great pizza but they also offer pasta dishes and a breakfast pizza. The only thing I didn't feel great about was the house salad. It was a let down to say the least, compared to the pizzeria franchise back home. Instead of coming in a big "small bowl" enough for two or take home, the salad for came on a plate enough for one. I only had the "huh" moment because I'm used to the other setups. Otherwise the salad was fine as is...I guess. However it felt good to get some Grimaldis pizza as close as I could get to Brooklyn (it was too crowded in NY for me).
2017-07-26,5,Whenever I'm looking for quality brick oven pizza, this is where I go. The dough is amazing and the quality of ingredients used is evident. I ordered buffalo wings and a Cesar salad to start. Both here great. The wings were cooked well and were crispy. Just how I like them. While the Cesar salad was a nice cool treat after the hot wings. The salad was fresh and I couldn't stop going in for more. As my entree, lol. I ordered a medium pepperoni pizza. The pizza was made fresh to order and was prepared quickly. The pizza didn't stand a chance against me.
2017-07-09,3,Pizza was good but I was expecting it to be better.  I envisioned this as "among the best", but it just didn't have me feeling like I gotta have this again.The sauce was a bit rustic for my preference but other people might really like this.Also, price-wise, I think the plain pie is probably the best deal because they kinda skimp on the toppings.  I got garlic as a topping and I definitely think $2 is too much considering a whole bulb is about 0.18 cents.  ($2-3 is a bit high anyway considering how little you get).The location and atmosphere is very nice though.  It's right in the heart of Hoboken where it's really beautiful.
2017-07-02,4,Great place for pizza. I always get the wings and pizza accompanied with a beer. It's a sit down pizza place with a bar. It is a little pricey but it's a little formal
2017-07-02,4,The pizza was good. Close to some of the other Grimaldi's locations we've been to in the past. Service was good up until it was time to get the check.......then we had to wait for the waiter to reappear even though they weren't busy at the time. We'll try again the next time we are in the area.
2017-07-02,5,Might be the best pizza I've ever had.  I used to frequent the one in Clifton, and loved it.  Somehow, this one was even better. Everything I ordered was amazing.  Actually ordered another pizza to go for the next day. It was that good.
2017-06-23,4,Their pizza is awesome!! Also have ordered the calzone, really good too! All of the salads were delicious. Delivery is pretty fast and all of the staff is really nice. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they're a little pricey, in my opinion. They charged an extra $2.00 for sauce with the calzone. Any place I've ever been to it comes with it? Also prices online aren't updated. My total should have been about $38 and I was charged $55. Not cool. But the great food definitely saves them.
2017-06-23,5,GrimaldisWent here for a second time and the experience was good but the pizza could have been good. It was one of the healthier pizzas out there but the taste was a bit off.  I remember going to the Brooklyn location and liking it a lot but I think that was also a different time in my life when I would like that kind of pizza. The cheese and sauce were perfect but I can't point out what was missing out.  The Coco Tartufo here is amazing.  The best one I have had in a long time.  The service was really good and the food came out fast, which was essential after a long day of fasting.  Location is apt right on Washington street and they also have outdor seating.  There are many places in Hoboken that are strictly Italian that have better tasting pizza than this place.
2017-06-15,4,Ordered the Don and grimaldis favorite. I added garlic to both and man was that worth it. Really one of the best pizza places in NYC, it's better than some of the more famous places around here.
2017-06-15,5,Love it! I've had so much good pizza and Grimaldi's is right at the top with the best! I got the regular personal pizza which was more than enough for a meal and left overs for later. The sauce and cheese were fantastic and I love the way they season it. Next stop is the Brooklyn one!
2017-06-06,5,Best pizza place in Hoboken! I always take my out-of-town friends. Their classic pizza tastes amazing. You'd expect it to be pricier but its just the right price. Go with friends but make sure you're not sharing just one pizza. You'll want the whole pie to yourself.
2017-05-30,3,Good food. Bad service. We had a particular bad experience so I'm not sure it speaks to everyone's experience and the staff was also a server short that day. We made a reservation by phone in the morning and arrived 15 minutes ahead of time. When we arrived, no one was there to greet us. We waited 10 minutes before someone came to the front to ask us if we made a reservation. Then they told us we never made a reservation. We even showed them the phone record. So I guess by accident, no one ever documented the reservation. The manager kindly stepped in and seated us by 7 (the time of our reservation). We ordered our food, just one Signature pizza for 6 of us and some garlic bread. We waited 45 minutes after we ordered for just a single pizza. We noticed that while we were waiting, other tables who were seated after us, had all their food and multiple pizzas served. We were getting extremely hungry and impatient. We pointed out to the waitress and she brought the manager who apologized and said the tickets probably got switched out of order so the others tables three pizzas came before ours. She offered to give the garlic bread on the house which was again very kind. While the food was great, we were just a little disappointed with our luck regarding the service. It was also very cold in the upstairs seating area so bring a jacket. One thing, I wish they served bread and oil on the house in general so we're not starving.
2017-05-29,2,I was looking forward to eating at Grimaldi's, the best known pizzeria in Hoboken. However my experience did not reach expectations. First the service was slow, unknowledgable of the menu, and slow. But that's not the reason I went there. I went for the pizza.If you are an Italian and looking for a good pizza place in Hoboken, do NOT go to Grimaldi's. If you are an American and want Italian style pizza then be my guest. I ordered a pizza with ricotta cheese and eggplant and the pizza did not contain any flavor. The ricotta was sparse and the eggplant wasn't fresh. The crust wasn't soft like a nice Neapolitan pizza. I've lived in North Jersey all my life and have spent months living in Italy and I was very disappointed in the quality of pizza I had at Grimaldi's despite its exceptional reputation. The menu is completely overpriced, asking for $3 for each additional topping on top of the $18 large plain pie. Anthony's coal fired pizza is better than this pizza, and that's saying a lot.
2017-05-15,3,the pizza was  very good as usual. However, the 11 dollar salad that I ordered was disgusting. unacceptable to serve something like that.
2017-05-08,5,Highly recommend this place for a non-greasy, simple and delicious pizza! Also the medium size pizza is pretty big!
2017-05-06,4,We started off with a house salad and green salad. The vegetables were all very fresh and the dressing with just right.Now on to the pizza... we got The Don as well as a white pizza with mushrooms and broccoli. I've been to the Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, and there are many similarities. The cheesy consistency of the fresh mozzarella, heartiness of the tomato sauce, fragrance and resilience of the dough are common to both places. However, they do have distinct characteristics. For example, the pizza is a bit drier at the Hoboken location, which makes it easier to pick up (the Brooklyn Grimaldi's center was a little bit soggy), but this means the crust is not quite as tasty (but still more edible than most places due to the high quality of the dough).
2017-05-01,4,This review is for the bar at Grimaldi's. We were waiting for our table at Charrito's Hoboken while we decide to grab beer at the bar. The bartender was friendly. I had one of beer at tap allagash white which i had it before and i love this  Belgian-style wheat beer. They had one of local NJ summer ale on tap as well and the bartender was nice enough to pour in some for me to taste. overall a nice bar experience
2017-04-29,5,I always want good pizza, but I wanted to find a legit place while I'm visiting and went by the yelp reviews while I was in Hoboken to visit the Cake Boss bakery.Grimaldi's did not disappoint!  The personal pizza size was more than enough for me...I could only eat 3/4th of it.  They had a good beer selection as well and I appreciated that they had Brooklyn lager.If you're looking for pizza, and you want good pizza, go here!
2017-04-14,5,Top notch customer service. We've been ciming here for years. Best management I have encountered in a very long time. We came in on a Friday night with the kids. The place was packed and there was a wait for our pzza. The manager came over and offered us a round of drinks on the house. Later when our pizza came out our waitress informed us that the manager comped our pizza too for the long wait. We were seriously impressed. It made our night! Everything was delicious as usual.
2017-04-08,3,The pizza is good but nothing worth the hype and honestly I've had way better pizza elsewhere. We ordered a large pie with chicken, olives and broccoli and they could really have done something with the toppings before they threw them on the pizza all bland.The decor is sooooo dated - maybe intentionally so but didn't float my boat.I guess the price isn't obscene and if I had to judge it from a value for money paid aspect, I'd go slightly higher than 3.
2017-04-02,5,The eggplant and garlic pizza is amazing!! Love this place and highly recommend! The eggplant is super crispy yet fresh - you have to try it as a pizza topping!
2017-03-28,5,First, let me straighten out some confusion - the Grimaldi's in Hoboken isn't the same as the four Grimaldi's in New York, and it has nothing to do with the chain located throughout various pizza-bereft states. The Hoboken Grimaldi's was started by a former business partner of the original Patsy Grimaldi of Brooklyn. The other Grimaldi's is just a mediocre chain glomming onto a famous (but non-copyrighted) name.The tenuous relationship between the New York and Hoboken Grimaldi's pretty much sums up what you should expect from this place. First of all, the pizza is fantastic. It's a perfect iteration of a classic New York pie, a style that's becoming harder to find on this side of the river. I'd hazard that it's just as good as the original location; after all, the owner had first-hand experience of real Patsy magic. The space, however, feels nothing like the well-worn York locations. The puffy booths and puffy menus and intentionally outdated pale wood paneling feel almost as cold as a freshly-built Olive Garden. That obviously has a lot to do with this being a new location. I guess it's up to clientele like us to breathe some life into this place; it should by all rights be as lively as the New York Grimaldi's.
2017-03-25,5,Love this place. Hands down the best pizza I've ever had! Everything from the bread to the sauce, to the cheese, and the meats are well seasoned and complement one another. Worth every penny.
2017-03-19,1,Absolutely worst dinner of my life. The food was okay but the cleanliness of this restaurant was out of control. I ordered a martini and as I drank it lipstick was all over the rim- they had not cleaned it. The waitress did the best as she could to help the situation but I received a new one without an I'm sorry from management. I will never go back and my friends will not either
2017-02-28,1,My delivery pizza has a completely black bottom and when I called they offered either discount on next order or for me to return the not touched pizza and get a new one. This was after my delivery took 2 hours when hey said 45 min. Last time I order from them. I miss the 2nd street location they were so much better.
2017-02-26,3,Tried this place last week when I was in Jersey City. We tried the vegetable topping make your own. We were playing at the Game Cafe and did a take out. It was Ok.
2017-02-23,5,"I can't believe you're at Grimaldi's and trying to order Hawaiian." -WifeIn my defense I ordered half pepperoni/sausage half Margherita instead and enjoyed every bit of it. We just don't get this style of pizza in California.Yada yada dough yada yada New York water...Five Stars.
2017-02-20,2,I rate this place a 2.5. Decided to try this place based on the reviews and knowing that this is a popular place. Upon arriving we were waiting in line for which there was no hostess. The hostess came to sit the people in front of us but never came back. After waiting 10-15 min and not knowing how long the wait was, we asked the lady whom was taking to go orders. She was not helpful and told us we had to wait for a hostess. As we were waiting people came and left because there was no hostess. Also the people behind us tried to cut in front of us and grab a table. After waiting longer we had ask a lady if she was the hostess and she said no she was the manager.Manager: I'm the manager can i help you. Me: yes, we have been waiting for a really long time and the hostess hasn't showed up. Manager: i know but there is no where to seat youMe: okay but someone should have greeted us by now so people can decide if they want to wait or not. How is someone suppose to know how long the wait is? So how long is the wait? (As there was a free table available) Manager: please wait 10 more mins......I am not an expert on managing restaurants but it seems like they should have a hostess that stands in the front especially since this is located on a main st in hoboken. As a manager knowing that your guest are waiting you think you would let them know sorry for the wait but we hope to seat you in a little bit or something. The pizza is okay. I found it a little bland and the garlic bread did not come with marinara sauce. I had to remind the waiter that we had order drinks and never received them. Our table was not fully setup yet i chose to ignore that. There is metered street parking (have to pay up until 9pm, Sunday's might free but i would suggest double checking) but it can be hard to find a spot esp on the weekend or after work hours.
2017-02-19,5,Relaxed ambience, good service n delicious pizza, not to forget dessert. Great for kids. Huge thumbs up!
2017-02-18,5,Not my first time at Grimaldis. I've been to the one in Brooklyn many times years back when I lived there. Hoboken I been to twice. It was a Saturday so parking was rough and the streets were busy. I made my way in and sat down immediately. It's a small spot but luckily wasn't too packed. I just got a regular cheese and it was delicious as always. That sauce is just unbearable and the crust was perfect. It's nicer then your average pizzeria for sure and the staff was on it. Always a treat to hit grimaldis especially when you're living outside the tri state for years and have to eat pizza that doesn't even resemble pizza one bit lol
2017-02-18,2,This is the second time I've been here. I had hopes that due to having selected a gluten free pizza the first time I was disappointed with the taste due to that fact. Nope! We had a pizza (not gluten free) and some wings. The pizza was blah. Sauce nothing special. Crust, fine but again not any better than we do any home. The wings were a fail. Chicken tasted gross. I only ate one and didn't dare eat anymore than that. To add insult to injury, someone that worked in the joint was wearing tons of Drakkar Noir or some other equally repulsive and cheap fragrance. Why??!!! So nauseating. Never going back.
2017-02-16,5,I've been to Grimaldi's several times since I moved to Hoboken over a year ago; personally, I think this is the best pizza place in town. Hoboken certainly has more than enough pizzarias, and many of them are fantastic, but only one can be the best!Specifically, the crust on their pizza was not overcooked, the pie wasn't too greasy, and the cheese wasn't overwhelming to the point that it wasn't a challenge to pick up the slice.The atmosphere here is a little more upscale than your average pizzaria. I was there one time on a Saturday night with live music (solo guitar playing John Mayer covers). Definitely the type of place people enjoy going to with friends, family, or both.
2017-02-11,5,Go here for a nice simple date night! They use fresh ingredients and even the Parmesan cheese shaker is fresh grated cheese!
2017-02-04,1,I'm here eating with my family and grand daughter and as soon as we walked in the hostess girl was rude. No hello no how can I help you no welcome at all. Been here alot and never seen her. She told us we couldn't have a high chair but.. our nice waitress asked if we wanted one. We said yes!  She ran to our waitress and told her something! She Is is walking around with this awful miserable look on her face like she hates her job. Even the lady manager is rude comes to our table and not ask how our meal was but ask if she can take the high chair! They really need to train the hostess to welcome..smile at the customers and not look so damn miserable.
2017-01-30,5,One of my favorite pizza spots in Hoboken! I usually just get take out, it's my go to place when people are visiting from out of town!
2017-01-15,4,Pro- Great pizza, it's as simple as that.Con- Skip the olives, they use those horrible canned black olives like you'd get from Domino's.
2017-01-06,3,UPDATE: I am knocking down a few stars here because I had a really unfortunate experience with Grimaldi's recently. I ordered a gluten-free pizza for take out with eggplant on it, as their menu specified that it was a topping option. I did not expect to be BREADED! Seriously, if I order a gluten free pizza with eggplant, you probably should have told me when I ordered that the eggplant was breaded, and offered other vegetables that were grilled. Ridiculous! I'm not sure if I'll be back again. I like the pizza, but I've recently discovered better places in town. ---I've tried a couple of places in town that offer gluten-free pizza, and (so far) it doesn't get better than Grimaldis. Gluten-free goers get the opportunity to get a personal-size pizza, with their choice of toppings. Ordering gluten free pizza has always been a challenge for me, so it was great to order without any restrictions.I got my pizza with mushrooms, and not only was it delicious, it was the perfect portion. I also got a sangria, which was fantastic! I will be back for more, and will be bringing my gluten-free friends and family.
2016-12-15,5,Legit pizza, cant beat this.  Always fresh and delicious. I would recommend marghaita or a pepperoni pizza. Service is great as well, and i love to sit at the bar. We tried this location at palazzo in vegas, but the taste is not the same as nyc
2016-12-13,4,Recently ventured into their Washington St location, I've only been to their other one before.  The service was fantastic, we were seated right away. Staff was very nice and helpful. We ended up splitting a bottle of wine and a plain pizza. The food was good, my only complaint was that the pizza wasn't very warm when we got it. It seemed a little weird as we were sitting next to the oven in the back of the restaurant. Other than the temperature of the pizza everything else was good, they let my friend and I sit and catch up with out pushing us to get out quickly.
2016-12-10,5,My wife and I have date nights at Grimaldi's on Washington in Hoboken and have been for a couple of years now. We have had different servers and bartenders serve us at our bar seats, and recently Peter Spano has been the bartender we have gotten to know the last couple of weeks. This guy Peter is a class act, attentive and helpful and continues to help make us want to come back. The food is another gift altogether. The chicken wings are an understated winner and both gluten free and normal pizza rock. Thank you Grimaldi's for the parties and the dinners and hopefully our tradition will continue on for a long time!
2016-12-04,1,I sat at the bar to find a screaming 12 month year old baby was sitting at the bar while it's Mother was drinking wine. I pointed out to the bartender it seemed inappropriate (because it is) and he snapped at me and called me rude... who snaps at someone while working in the hospitality industry. Dear bartender, find a new profession.
2016-11-29,5,Had a delicious pizza and refreshing cold beer served by Peter, a very nice bartender!
2016-11-09,5,So we just had a 2nd event catered by Grimaldi's today. It was a bit impromptu as our original catering vendor had to cancel last minute. Thankfully Grimaldi's was able to accommodate us last minute. Not only did they take care of our order last minute, they also opened their kitchen early to satisfy our time requirements. My dept. likes to eat on time. Ever had a room full of hangry colleagues? I have and I pray that you never do.Cristina (manager) was very professional when taking our order. Most importantly she did not miss a detail. We ordered 13 pies of various delicious varieties and a couple trays of Caesar salad. The pies included: Ricotta & Ham, Meatball, Sausage & Mushroom, Broccoli & Chicken, and Sweet Red Peppers & Spinach. All were very good but my favorite was the Sausage & Mushroom and salad.Full marks for great food and great service. They saved my behind on this event. Grimaldi's, thank you!
2016-10-19,5,I have always been a Clinton street girl when it comes to Grimaldi's... however with the recent closure I ventured to the heart of town for some amazing pizza. In the last I've always done the plain or buffalo chicken; which I love. My most recent trip I tried the pepperoni. IT WAS AMAZING. I love the fresh, small, thick slices and that's how they did it! I also enjoyed the atmosphere sitting outside on a Monday night and enjoying the streets with dinner!
2016-10-12,5,I'm in my 50's. I've had pizza, "pie" from many places. this place ruined me. I can't eat a pizza anyplace else now! it's a work of Art! the crust with all the bubbles, the red sauce is perfect. I watched the way they build it. they put the sauce on last. I think that's why the crust is so perfect. no soggy pizza. when it came to our table it was right out of the oven. still steaming! just beautiful. my absolute favorite!  if you have one that compares to this please let me know.
2016-10-10,2,Okay maybe this is a harsh rating cause I am an admitted pizza snob but then again, totally standing by it. Pizza is ok at best, as the sauce is totally flavorless, which blows my mind with how Grimaldis has made a name for itself. Worse yet, it was $25 for the pie. I get you got a name and such but that's highway robbery and laughable with the other options in town. Maybe there's a reason the second location closed aside from the obvious. Product is lacking. Sauce sauce sauce. No flavor, no tang, no savor, absolutely flavorless. But hey, pizza looks good. $25 can get you so much more in this town.
2016-10-08,3,I've always been a fan of their pizza. Their food never disappoints. Fresh mozzarella, robust flavors, and crispy crusted pizzas are why I've come here for years. Over the last few months, I've experienced terrible service particularly by a woman named Christina.  A couple weeks ago, we came by and she was very rude. Slamming plates, pulling our tablecloth while our hands still on the table almost spilling our drinks, and lots of staring. We thought maybe she had a long day, and ignored it. We came back today (for my son's birthday lunch) and was in shock with how much attitude we received from her. She acted as if we were inconveniencing her. She told us we couldn't be seated until our entire party was present and walked away. I took a seat near the bar, and when my son came in, he sat next to me, so she told him to get up since children aren't allowed at the bar. No worries. Her attitude and demeanor were all downhill from there. I wasn't sure if she was shouting at me, but she made it pretty clear that she wanted all of us to sit outside  to the point where I actually had to stop her and ask her what was going on, and if there was a problem. Once we sat outside, I was relieved to find out someone else was waiting on us. Again this time, the glaring at our table, and when I paid the check she returned the book with the change to the other side of the table. Not sure if it's just mere coincidence she's having long days whenever we're there, but maybe she's a little tired. Hoping for a little more polite service when we return, but I might just opt for takeout the next few times instead.
2016-09-25,3,If you are looking for Great Pizza with excellent, sauce, crust, and cheese, this is the place.  Buyer beware, last night we decided to try some of their other menu items since the pizza was great I presumed the other menu items would be better than you local corner pizza joint, but that was a mistake.Cesar Salad, nothing special. Cut up Romaine over tossed with Cesar dressing that tasted no different than what i can purchase from the grocery store and pre-packed generic croutons all for the price of $8.00.  I am sure this place must have some left over garlic bread that they could have used to make their own croutons and if you are going to use average dressing, than serve it on the side. Eggplant Parm, nothing special.  What was good was the sauce and cheese. The eggplant looks just like the pre-breaded eggplant i purchase from Trader Joes (which I love). However, I had higher expectations and expected higher quality like freshly prepared eggplant. My mistake. Calzone: we ordered ours with Meatballs and all i can say is, "Where's the Meat?"  If you looked hard enough you could see what looks like a one meatball chopped up into little bits.  And the nerve to have charged $2.00 per topping for a personal Calzone.  FYI if you are ordering a calzone, keep it traditional so you can limit your disappointment.   I am not through with Grimaldi's but I will give the Clinton street location a try just to see how they compare. My advice to this restaurant, if you are not going to make everything as great as your pizza than don't even bother putting it on the menu. Thanks, VAUnion City, NJ
2016-09-22,5,Wow !!!! What can I say.   The best real authentic Italian pizzeria in the USA.   give it a try.  Well worth the trip !!!!!!
2016-09-11,4,Great pepperoni pizza!! We ordered a medium pepperoni pizza for the two of us. A pizza, and a soda for about $20ish, that's great for lunch. They have brunch drinks ($4/mimosa and beer) too. We went to the original location in Brooklyn a few years ago and this place is just as good.
2016-09-10,1,One star for the pizza, but other than that, an AWFUL experience. First, we were seated upstairs and the service was HORRIBLE. We waited 10 minutes after being seated to ASK for some drinks. Other than forgetting somethings we asked for, fast forward to the bill.  My sister ordered a "Shirley Temple" (which is just sprite, grenadine, and cherries, not an alcoholic drink). So after sitting there for 5 minutes with no drink in front (not even water, bc nobody came to ask) my sister asked for a refill. So the bill comes, they charge for 2 Shirley temples ($6 total), not crazy expensive, but we were not told by our waitress that a sprite and grenadine refill would be charged for a whole other drink.  So after waiting another 10 minutes to question the extra charge, a female manager (or owner) came around, so we got her attention. After explaining, she copped an attitude and said : "well with the ingredients we use, we don't do free refills, like we do with our soft drinks.... but I'll find out". (Im Sorry is sprite no longer a soft drink). The. We said: "um it's sprite and cherry flavored syrup". After she came back, with even more of an attitude, she said "we took one off, but she DID give you extra cherries" (big freaking deal).  So after we thanked her for taking one off, and after giving her part cash and part card. (After the one drink was taken off, the total was $60.35), instead of a total of $63.35 before the drink was taken off.This is were it gets EVEN WORSE. After adding up our split transactions, the total came to $65.35!!!!!) When it should have been $60.35. AND they didn't give us our original receipt back to obviously try to be slick and over charge us.Grimaldis you should be ASHAMED of whoever that lady was, manager or owner. Will NEVER come back, and will tell everyone I know not to go either.
2016-08-28,4,Their Mariana sauce is phenomenal! Pizza was excellent. Reason for 4 stars was service was very sub par
2016-08-11,5,We ordered pizza and garlic bread.  The food was delicious.  Hot and fresh.  True NY style pizza. You could tell the ingredients were very fresh. The pizza had plenty of cheese and sauce yet it wasn't too much.  Garlic bread came out looking like a small pizza served with a bowl of marinara and we asked for parmesan cheese.  Wait staff was very friendly and efficient. Would definitely recommend this as a go to restaurant.
2016-08-10,3,My wife wanted us to try this place and we went for dinner during the week. We were sat outside and we tried one of the pizzas with white sauce and pepperoni and mushroom. Pizza was ok and service was decent but we had better pizzas so I rate this place as OK.
2016-08-08,4,Definitely overpriced (~$18 bucks for a personal calzone with 3 toppings) but it's also definitely delicious. Their marinara/tomato sauce is the best I've ever had and their calzones are ridiculously good (so much ricotta!).I'll most likely be back every once in a blue moon so my bank statements don't make me cry.
2016-08-08,4,Yum! My boyfriend and I came for lunch, and sat outside. They have a nice overhang so you can enjoy the shade on a hot day. They do need to invest in tablecloth clips- it was windy and it was a bit annoying holding down the tablecloth since it kept blowing up onto our pizza. Anyway, we ordered the personal pizza (4 slices) with pepperoni and black olives. It was delicious! The personal pizza was perfect for the two of us for lunch. The medium would have been too much. Fresh ingredients, and great service.
2016-07-23,5,Love this place.  Best pizza in Hoboken.  A couple beers.  Perfect.  Try the white pizza.
2016-07-02,5,The pizza was fantastic and very scrumptious I'm from Chicago and I'm used to deep dish pizza and I have to say their coal burning pizza was as good as it gets
2016-06-26,5,In a town full of different pizzerias, Grimaldi's stands out as one the best, if not the best. It has a pleasant location and restaurant vibe. There is live music and the pizza is incredible. They use the right amount of sauce and the dough and crust is good.
2016-06-21,3,This place is pretty good. I've only eaten in the restaurant and it's your typical pizza joint with a bar, some tables around, and a line of booths. The service can be spotty here at times. Either the waitstaff is confused, or their just trying to shuffle the customers in and out. While the pizza here is pretty good, the last couple times I've had it, its been soggy at the bottom. These are typical NY slices too, so that can really mess the whole thing up. Overall the pizza is pretty good, maybe a tiny bit overpriced. One of the main reasons for the 3-stars is they used to have an appetizer called mozzarella puffs (or pillows or something) and it was fried mozzarella that was made with fresh, light, airy mozzarella that just melted in your mouth. Came back recently and ordered the fried mozzarella thinking they just changed the name, and what came out was a typical probably once-frozen fried mozzarella block. Very disappointing.Overall good for a quick pizza and wine in a booth sorta meal, but not my first choice in Hoboken.
2016-06-17,5,Food is five stars. Pizza is fantastic, always great. Only qualm and reason for three stars is in hopes that they rectify their Sunday night service. Hours online and on Yelp say they're open until 11. If someone calls at 9:50 to place an order for pickup there shouldn't be an issue. Grimaldi's shouldn't answer the phone, ask what you want, let you explain your order, then tell the customer the place is closed an hour and ten minutes before they're supposed to. Their explanation is that it's a Sunday. Unsatisfactory answer I'm afraid. Don't pick up the phone if you're not open. I'm sure the owners are still paying you to work until 11, I'd bet they'd want to make money from 10-11 when the worker says it's "closed".Thanks for clarifying Sean. Classic miscommunication. We'll remember Sunday hours from now on.
2016-05-23,3,Came here to try their Gluten Free pizza. The hubby and I were able to walk in on a Friday night after work and after a quick wait at the bar, we were seated at a table.  The place was full on a Friday, but people were coming in and out so the wait was not too long.  Patrons included young couples, and families with little kids. We ordered two gluten free anchoby pizzas and waters. To start with the food, the pizza was actually pretty good.  It didn't seem like the dough was made in house as it was unwrapped from a package before toppings were added. With that said, I liked it.  The pizzas were big enough that we couldn't finish them individually and took some home for the next day. My main issue with the place was the service.  When we were seated by the bar, the bartender sprinkled me and the girl sitting next to me with beer and apologized by saying she does that all the time. (ha?). When we were seated at the table, the table was never cleared nor set up for us.  I asked our server to bring a setting with napkins, knife and forks but she didn't seem to understand me (odd considering other people had a set up...).  It wasn't till our food came and the manager jumped in that I finally got a fork. yay! We had to remind staff a few times that I ordered water.  For some reason, it took a while to get it. Overall, the place is nice and food was decent. Service may have been a fluke from the night we visited but was so ridiculous that I just had to laugh.
2016-05-15,4,This is very good pizza, and the bar is great. My wife and I came in one weekday evening, so hungry and the food hit the spot.  The bartender was great, very attentive and quick with his service.  The whole staff was friendly.  We will come back again.
2016-05-01,5,While visiting Hoboken I knew I had to make a stop at the famous Grimaldi's. From the moment I walked in to the moment I walked out I was delighted by the amazing customer service. I was seated very quickly and immediately had my drink order taken. All the waiters had smiles and seemed very attentive to their tables, especially my waiter, I think his name was Brian. Our order came out timely and the food was impeccable. The pizza was perfectly crisp just as I expected from coal brick-oven pizza. I was asked multiple times if I needed anything and if my food was okay, as I said before GREAT customer service. I will definitely be back for more of my new favorite pizza.
2016-04-25,1,I used to live in Hoboken and Jersey City 15 years ago and really appreciated the pizza and thought I'd have a great dining experience at Grimalid's as I live in Texas and they have locations there which have been wonderful. I must say the Grimaldi's in Hoboken was the WORST pizza I've ever had.  Had dinner there around 6:15pm on Thurs 4-21-2016 and there were more wait staff than customers and it took forever for our drinks ( A beer and mixed drink)  to come out as the wait staff preferred to joke among themselves rather than pay attention to the customer and the bartender really had a since of 'arrogance' when making sure the drinks we made - The beer served was 'warm and skunky' and no apologies from the waiter as he didn't care - The pizza was HORRIBLE and extremely 'soggy' but no one asked how our meal was.  We had two slices off a large pizza and when asked if we wanted to take the rest 'to go' we said no thank you and they did not ask why .The antipasto salad took forever to come out and was really not good - So sorry to have eaten there as our expectations were high being this was one of the 'original' Grimaldi's in New York/New Jersey but I will thank the ones in Texas as they are for more superior than what was served in Hoboken - Also be careful as the place is small and tight and can become a 'romper  room' with all the little kids with parents that come in. Kids don't know 'bad pizza' but this paying Adult knows. If you have a great experience; then you are lucky - Terrible - Terrible - Terrible - I'll never go back and really prefer Bertucci's for a 'real brick oven pizza' that is not soggy  - One thing I k now about Jersey - You don't asked to have it 're made' as you don't know what you will get so that is why we left our leftovers  - Didn't want to leave tip but felt 'semi obligated' as I don't stiff people but if the overall service was better; the tip would have been too - Based on my  experience with Grimaldi's - Go to any other but the one in Hoboken.
2016-04-25,5,My wife and I have lived in Hoboken 24 years, so we've been to a lot of pizza places. I'd have to say this is among the very best, if not the best, period. Keep in mind, the bar for pizza is pretty high in Hoboken, but Grimaldi's is that good. It can get crowded, but the service is very fast, so once you're seated, you won't wait long at all. beer and wine menu is great. It can get a bit noisy, but name a pizza restaurant in a town with this many families that isn't. Staff is incredibly friendly. Over all, It's a great choice.
2016-04-10,5,Always a treat to visit my favorite pizza place in Hoboken. Was able to make a reservation a day in advance for 15 people, no questions asked! We are all big fans of Grimaldi's having spent many a happy hour or late night at the bar. Thank you for yet another wonderful night enjoying the company of many friends and delicious pizza!
2016-04-08,5,Very good pizza. This is deff a classy place not the late night drunk pizza. We ordered the medium pie to go with onions and mushrooms and it came out to $21. Recommend this place it's yummy.
2016-04-07,4,I recently hosted a team event here. They have a party/event room upstairs. We had about 45 people in our group; it was a bit crowded. The staff was quite friendly. The manager who helped me finalize the menu on phone was helpful, though she didn't give me any discount even for such a large group.The quality of food is very good.I don't have any basis to compare this location to the other Grimaldi's, though.
2016-03-28,3,3.5/5 for me hereI popped in here as a party of 2 around 4pm or so on a Saturday and found a couple of tables outside taken and a handful inside.  It is nice that some restaurants stay open during the odd-hour to allow for random food cravings around that time to hit and be satisfied.  Overall, it is nice that the restaurant also has outdoor seating, especially during the spring/fall months.For food, we tried the personal calzone (simple with ricotta and mozzarella well done) with a side of sauce and the personal margherita (simple and flavorful with fresh basil), which was perfect for 2 people to split and be comfortable with.  Everything tasted fresh and I would recommend either for anyone looking for something on the 'personal' side.Overall, the atmosphere was casual and inviting.  We did request to sit at the booth with the fairly empty restaurant and were denied since we were only 2 people (only for 3 or more).  After a couple of minutes, we did see several parties after us get accommodated with the same request which I found strange...  The service was friendly otherwise and food was good overall with fair prices.Buon appetito.
2016-03-11,3,I've heard so much hype about grimaldi's, and unfortunately my experience ordering delivery was sub-par. My pizza was extremely soggy and wet and fell apart when I picked it up, and frankly, overpriced. Delivery took over an hour when I live just a few blocks away. Maybe this was just a bad experience and a busy Friday night. I'll definitely try again, but I would just suggest to order your pie "well done" if ordering delivery.
2016-02-29,4,On what felt like the fist day of spring '16 I went to this restaurant with some friends we were seated immediately and tried their drinks the man-mosa is a mix of oj, blue moon, vodka and champagne but to be honest it tasted like a watered down orange flavored beer. I'll stick to just regular oj and champagne. The pizzas are made to order pick your pie size and the toppings range from 1 to 4 dollars. The salad was good but nothing special. The restaurant had a lot of traffic but not a long wait I definitely feel that their specialty is the pizza and they do it very well but don't expect much more than that.
2016-02-28,2,This was my first time here.  I guess its a good spot if you have nothing else to do.  We ordered a large pie with 2 different sides one red one white.  The red side had meatball and spinach.  Nothing was really special about it meatball tasted like  it was out of a freezer. The white side had chicken it was so dry and im surebit was picked off a rotisserie from shoprite.  On top of all that iy was so over priced.  Siy at the bar hve a beer!
2016-02-16,5,Mark, one of the bartenders made one of the best drinks, old fashions, that I have ever had.Pizza was awesome, but the lady in front did not smile at all when we walked in. That was just rude service, but Mark made up for it.
2016-02-10,5,Pizza is excellent--husband and I agreed, best in Hoboken and we've lived here awhile. Nice atmosphere too. So far have been able to snag a table with minimum wait even on busy Friday night.Upgrading to a five after our visit last night. Were seated right away on a busy Saturday night. There were four of us--we devoured two medium pies. Hands down, best brick oven pizza in Hoboken.
2016-02-09,2,Mediocre pizza. The place a block towards the water(behind the Walgreens) has a better, to be honest.
2016-02-05,4,So I hear the pizza here is good. We came here on a weekend for dinner. There was no wait time, so it was pretty easy to make the decision to eat here. Our waiter was friendly and informative. He told us about how Grimaldi's makes pizza, how fresh their ingredients are, and how they only sell whole pies, not slices.We ordered a small, which was much larger than I expected. I could barely fit the entire pizza into the frame when I took a picture. Here, I didn't want to conspicuously stand up to take a picture of food. The price isn't bad, but once you add toppings, the cost adds up quickly. We added spinach, pepperoni, and ricotta.I can see why people like these pizzas so much. It had a thin crust with a nice char on the bottom. It was heavy on the sauce and cheese. The sauce was sweet and thick and the mozzarella was so gooey. There was so much mozzarella I really didn't need the ricotta. Since the crust is thin and the sauce is heavy, it makes for a pretty floppy pizza.As per the waiter's recommendation, we also ordered the fried mozzarella cakes. They were covered in a sweet tomato sauce, but still had a slight crunch. The mozzarella inside was hot, gooey, and oozed out when I bit into it.It's a nice pizza place. The restaurant is a little on the small side and the bathroom is located downstairs. Overall, I enjoyed the food though I wouldn't want to wait in line for these pizzas at the other busier locations.
2016-01-28,5,Best pizza place in Hoboken - delicious pizza, very friendly staff and great ambience.
2016-01-23,4,Yes, I'm still "a fan".  However, that said, I normally find Grimaldi's to be 5-star worthy.  I've been to 2 Grimaldi's in AZ and also to the other one in Hoboken.  Yet, somehow, this one on Washington Street just is not up to par.  Even worse---I can't quite put my finger on why that is---that being part of the reason I waited so long to do the review.  I was hoping to figure out just what was missing.We were here on a weekend day between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m.  The place wasn't very busy at the time.  They were easily able to accommodate our party of seven and we were given seats right up against the kitchen.  Thus, we were able to watch them make the pizzas.This Grimaldi's has a very different vibe from the one on Clinton Street.  The Clinton Street location says to me "neighborhood pizza joint" while Washington Street one has a bar which says to me "bar first, pizza place second".  As for the pizza here---all the elements seemed to be in place.  The crust was thin with the char that comes with a coal-fired oven baked pizza.  The sauce seemed to be the same (although a bit too much was put on it).  The cheese portion was similar to other Grimaldi's.  Yet, it just didn't taste the same.  Something was lacking---I wish I knew what it was.  Interestingly enough, everybody else seemed to like it and thought it was fine.  Maybe I'm the outlier here.Still service was good.  Our server was prompt, friendly and efficient.  The place was clean.  One thing to note---the bathroom is in the basement.  That, too, was clean.Next time we're in Hoboken and our daughter and son-in-law want pizza, I'm going to tell them that I much prefer the Clinton Street location.
2016-01-21,5,Come here all the time. My boyfriend lives across the street. We feel at home here. Love the food and service. Best place in Hoboken. Marc, the bartender, makes us feel welcome every time. He makes a great Basil Tom Collins.
2016-01-15,3,Came mid-week to a fairly empty restaurant. Was seated quickly by a very attentive server. We had a bottle wine that we nursed over the next hour while we waited for our friend to arrive.During this time we ordered the mozzarella cakes. The cakes themselves were quite good, lightly crunchy on the outside and cheesy on the inside. The best bit was the sauce on the cakes. The tomato sauce was amazing and full of delicious flavor!We had a small pizza with peppers, sausage, onions, and garlic. The pizza was very tasty, the crust was nice wood charred flavor on in. Note that a small pizza is perfect for 2-3 people. I wouldn't say anything was super outstanding which is why I've given 3 stars. But I thoroughly enjoyed the pizza and the service.
2016-01-06,4,I've both eaten at the restaurant (outside, of course!) and ordered from there. Pizza is amazing and fresh and the service was great. They sometimes have live music but nothing crazy. Will continue to go there and order take out.
2016-01-04,4,Love it here, great pizza and house salads. Staff is friendly. Great place grab something to eat and relax.
2016-01-03,4,This place was super cute both on the outside and on the inside! I came on a mission to compare it to Lombardi's which I had the previous night. Grimaldi's was super delicious. The crust was a little thicker than I expected but that was not a bad thing at all. The mozarella cheese was so fresh and the sauce was well balanced! I ordered the small cheese pizza and ate half of the pie... after a long day of walking this was just what I needed! I believe it was about $20 for a small pizza but this was enough for 2 people to split and hey for $10 each that is definitely a deal for a sit down restaurant that was lowkey and an escape from the crowds.  Would go again in a heartbeat.
2016-01-02,4,Awesome place to get brick oven pizza. We like to sit at the bar, order plain pie, and a bottle of wine for a nice low key dinner date.
2015-12-16,5,A fancier pizza place in Hoboken. We were able to get some wine and hang out while we fill up on pizza before we headed out to the bars. We chose this pizza place because it offers gluten free pizza. Tastes just as great as the regular pizza!  Lots of variety and the kitchen is open so you can see your pizza being made, which is cool!I'll be back to Grimaldi's next time i'm in hoboken!
2015-12-13,2,This pizza is expensive and not that good.  The service was also not great. We ordered a large pizza with a lot of toppings but it wasn't anything special. We got a large pizza with sausage, pepperoni, broccoli and mushrooms. The toppings are charged separately which can add up. We came before the rush but watched all the tables before us get served before our pizza finally came out. Our server was unapologetic and I really don't have many good things to say about this place.
2015-12-12,3,Legendary old school pizza and perfect place for a date or relaxing evening.  They have a few tvs and a bar.  Setup is nicer then a typical pizzeria.  Great place that specializes in really one thing "pizza".  Not an Italian restaurant menu but they do have really good spaghetti & meatballs.
2015-12-07,5,Was visiting family in New Jersey over the Thanksgiving long weekend, and was lucky enough to have a meal at Grimaldi's.  The atmosphere was excellent, and the staff were superb.  The staff were quick to seat us, and even went as far as to notice that our group had two infants.  They immediately moved us a little further from the front door as it was a cold night.  We ordered a pizza and a bunch of appetizers.  The Apps were good, but the pizza was just excellent.  I'm usually not a fan of thin crust pizza, but it was so damn good!  They even had gluten free options for one of the people in our group with allergies.  The cost was very reasonable, and I would definitely suggest people check it out.The only problem, is that now I cannot stand the pizza I get back in Toronto...
2015-12-03,5,I love brick oven pizza!  Patsy Grimaldi is probably synonymous with brick oven pizza, in my book.  I have been to the first Hoboken location (133 Clinton St, Hoboken, NJ 07030), and loved it.  So when I heard there was a new one in Hoboken, I had to check it out.  Went today for lunch.  My co-worker almost killed a large pie, it was so good!  See you all soon...
2015-11-05,5,Best pizza in Hoboken - truly authentic brick oven with coal pizza.  Bartender - Mark - was great.  Definitely a regular place from now on
2015-10-27,2,Shame to the Grimaldi name solely because  we had no idea who our waiter was  because we got 4 different waiters the entire time. We sat aimlessly for 30 minutes as we tried to wave down a waiter. I asked for water ( which was the 90 minutes I was here once) and never got a refill.The only reason I gave this place a two star was because the food was decent. Having one waiter for an entire floor may NOT be the best idea buddy.
2015-10-24,1,Was very disappointed with the bar service, felt the liquor was watered down. $138.00 later with one pizza n the rest a couple of drinks n espresso's n not even a taste of alcohol in any of our drinks.. Big time ripoffs n pizza was not that memorable.. Just plain disappointed.
2015-10-23,3,Had their Margherita pie and it was just okay. Nothing about it was too amazing or popped out of the ordinary. Just simple decent pizza- nice atmosphere though
2015-10-16,5,Amazing pizza!!! The margherita pie is perfect. My friend and I ate an entire large pie. It has a thin crust and perfect amount of cheese/sauce. I will be back!
2015-09-29,4,I am a big fan of Grimaldi's. I've only been here once with a few friends but it was by far one of the best pizza places I had ever been to. My 3 friends and I shared a large pie of cheese pizza before a night out in Hoboken,.We had about 2 slices each, but they were so warm, filling and VERY delicious. Definitely a go-to pizzeria if you're craving pizza in Hoboken!!
2015-09-20,4,Great place to go for dinner. Speedy service, the stuff are very friendly. The pizza was fantastic! Haven't been to their Brooklyn location but, the Manhattan location wasn't the best we went. The only problem with the Hoboken store, is that it's in Hoboken! Forget about taking your car unless your up for a heft parking fee or a fairly long walk to get there!
2015-09-18,5,The food is amazing!! I was looking for a nice Sunday lunch spot and I found it. They had drink specials. $4 sangria, $4 mimosa, $3 corona. Highly recommend the sangria. Everything was just delicious. Will be coming back very soon.
2015-08-31,4,Woah. This is my kind of pizza!I have always meant to try Grimaldi's and happened to pass by the Hoboken location while hungrily searching for a dinner spot. I am so glad that we popped in to try it! I'll admit I was lured in by the sangria special...though knowing that this was some pretty famous pizza didn't hurt!The pizza really speaks for itself. The crust is just perfect; not too thick and not too thin. The sauce is incredibly zesty and barely needed any further seasoning. Went with sausage for a topping and it was really fantastic. Patsy's doesn't hold a candle to Grimaldi's!!
2015-08-27,4,I think the pizza is fantastic. I'm not concerned with comparing it to others, or whether it's exactly the same as what I had in Italy. All that I know is that it's delicious, simple, and the slight char from the oven makes it perfect. I'll definitely be back!
2015-08-04,4,Shared a large pizza with sausage and mushrooms - classic thin crust pizza with that charred wood-burning oven flavor, light on the sauce.  I was impressed with the quality of the sausage they used.  At first we weren't sure if we could finish the large and did in fact end up taking two slices home...with a green salad to start and a glass of red wine it was the perfect dinner for a hot summer evening.The ambiance is family-style with a little bit of romance thrown in with white tablecloths and candle light.  Most of the guests there were couples enjoying a casual night out.  I would say a good spot in Hoboken for that.
2015-08-01,1,I was quite excited to try this place since I heard it was so good. It wasn't. The pizza tasted... Wierd. It is difficult to describe but the cheese was unlike anything that I have ever tasted. And not in a good way. And there was a grand total of three mushrooms on the pizza. It was just... Not good. And the garlic bread is not garlic bread. It is a pizza crust with no sauce, no cheese and some garlic. Not bad. But not garlic bread. Service was fine. But I will not go back
2015-07-26,5,I've visited a few of the Grimaldi's in the area and even though I live in Brooklyn (a short walk from the original location), this Grimaldi's is my far and away favorite!  I've been there for both lunch and dinner and found both to be positive experiences.  It's a large restaurant with multiple floors/rooms and outdoor sidewalk seating in the warmer months.  Never had to wait for lunch and occasionally have a short wait for dinner, but nothing major.  The staff is professional, courteous, and prompt.  I always order the classic margarita and a salad  (because if it's not broken, don't fix it!) and the pizza is consistently well done each and every time.  The crust is the highlight and what makes it so unique, although the cheese and seasonings aren't far behind.  For an epic Hoboken touristy day (my favorite!), pick up a sweet treat to go at Carlos Bakery (of TLC's Cake Boss) as you exit the train, walk the three blocks to Grimaldi's and enjoy your delicious pizza, and then walk over to the Hoboken waterfront/piers to enjoy your sweet treat on a bench with amazing skyline views of the city before heading back to Manhattan on the train!
2015-07-17,4,Had the large with anchovies, pepperoni and green peppers. This place is brick oven so the pizza had a smokiness to it. Really good crust. Would try again.
2015-07-17,4,Very nice place for lunch, you can eat inside or outside.  Pizza was delicious and you can put any topping you want on it. Service was good and the Pizza from order to plate was approximately 15 min. It is a doable lunch for 1 hr.I will definitely return!!
2015-07-10,3,Went here for the first time with my wife after lusting after this for a few weeks. We came in with really high expectations, we came out of there disappointed.Don't get me wrong, the pizza is good, but not outstanding. The sauce is a bit too watery and cheese is lacking and so are the toppings. Size is decent. We are amateur cooks and have made pizza, even our amateur pizzas are better than this.Besides the pizza, service was good, the servers are not in your face like others.Come on Grimaldi's, do better!
2015-07-10,4,Didn't realize the menu was going to be filled with basically pizza and only a limited other options (a few salads and maybe two pasta options), but it didn't really matter -- it was great! We started with personal garlic bread. Enough for two. It was basic a garlic pizza, delicious! And then the pepperoni pizza was fantastic. A large pizza was a bit too much for two people, we had a couple slices left over. I'd definitely go back!
2015-07-01,5,There I was walking around Hoboken looking for a bit to eat when I see Grimaldi's. I've heard of their legacy (and their feud), but never had tried the pizza, so I figured I'd stop in and grab a pie.Wow. Definitely the best "classic style" (what others might call "NYC style", even though it's better on both sides of Manhattan) pizza in Hoboken, perhaps even all of NJ - the jury is still out on that one. The crust was slightly smoky and crunchy, but chewy in the middle. The cheese was perfect, and the sauce was great too. Had meatballs and crushed garlic thrown on, it really melded well with the fresh basil they put on the pie. Bonus: They had $4 sangrias at the bar! I had a sip and instantly knew something was up, it tasted a whole lot more complex than your average sangria - the bartender said they put blackberry brandy & gin in the red sangria. I had a sip of the white (which I'm normally not a fan of), and it was just as good.All in all, Grimaldi's is definitely worth going out of your way for - top notch pizza in a cozy spot, with outdoor seating, too.
2015-06-29,4,To compare Grimaldi's to other pizza places is just not applicable. The fired pizza is always amazing and of s different breed of flavor than a steel stove pizza.  The quality of their ingredients is of an artisan style place and Grimaldi's takes their pizza serious.  Make sure save some room for dessert, the Spumoni truffle is amazing!
2015-06-28,3,We had the fried mozzarella cake and a medium pizza. The mozzarella cake was absolutely delicious, and also very filling. The medium pizza was just about okay. One thing to note is that the sizes here are huge. We were told that the medium will serve 2, but we could barely eat a slice each. I think the medium is more than what 2 people can manage. The pizza (with toppings) also came out to be very expensive.Average per person - $25
2015-06-27,5,Near perfect pizza pie is attained with their fresh basil, salty/chewy delicious mozzarella, and impeccable sauce. I have yet to come across a better option in all of New Jersey. Service can be hit or miss, but that's not why you go..
2015-06-26,2,Very expensive for a pizzeria! Now I see that many of their other reviews say the same about it being overpriced.  The pizza was good, but certainly not "out of this world" kind of pizza. My husband and I walk by Grimaldi's often so decided to give it a try. My family owns a chain of pizzerias/italian restaurants. Grimaldi's charged us close to $25.00 for a MEDIUM sized pie, which is only 6 slices, half peppers and onions, half eggplant. We charge our customers $18.25 for a pie of 8 slices with the same toppings on it. It was a little ridiculous. Definitely won't be back and will stick to my family or my other favorite Hoboken pizza spots that charge much less for a special pie.
2015-06-25,5,Loved Grimaldi's! The pizza was good and the appetizers were delicious! Sat outside, nice atmosphere. The waitress could have been a little better however the manager was awesome and very friendly. Recommend Grimaldi's!
2015-06-09,4,Grimaldi's is always good and Hoboken has the best staff. Very pleasant people who went out of there way to help my daughter and I. If you never had Grims pizza then try it!
2015-06-07,4,Pizza is amazing plain and simple , meatballs some of the better I've had in Hoboken , antipasto salad is on the money , Wine list needs work.
2015-05-30,4,Only complaint here is that it's a little pricey for what it is. However the ingredients are fresh and tasty. We ordered a mushroom pizza and mozzarella and tomato salad. The salad was also tasty and the cheese was delicious but definitely overpriced.Good overall experience and a must if visiting the city.
2015-05-27,2,They hook you by promo shield at the entrance of sangria for 5$ and beer for 4$ only. When we booked a table and ordered food with sangaria, they billed us 7$ for sangria. That was the lunch time 2 pm, we ordered the food and drinks. Your cafe was emtpy, but the shield attracted. The waiter told us that we should have ordered only drinks and sit at the bar in order to get the promotions, that is lol, because we couldnt then order the food, but we sat 50 inches from the bar.
2015-05-14,4,Grimaldi's welcomed us with the taste of great East Coast pizza when we moved to Hoboken 6 years ago! What else can you say about a place that has really good pizza flavors all around. The fact that you can choose your own ingredients and leave it up to the pizza maker to make it mouthwatering and tasty!!! It was always fun to go there when the weather is warm and they have the outdoor seating set up. We used to take our dog to sit and hangout there, have pizza and house wine during the weekend. Great and friendly service!
2015-05-11,2,Food is great however I certainly was not happy with the service. While my guest and I were eating not even finished yet the busboy runs up to the table interrupts us to ask if we were done which clearly we weren't we only got our food about 10 minutes prior. Then immediately when we are done they run up to say "Did you ask for the check?" Clearly we didn't. I didn't appreciate being rushed and monitored like we weren't paying customers.
2015-05-07,4,This could easily be 5 stars but I've only gone here once. Got a white pizza with sausage on it and it came out amazing. Price is a bit high but you get what you pay for. If you're particular about pizza this is def a good choice for quality.
2015-05-06,2,Sean and Bernadette,Thanks for your message.  Here's the Wikipedia link to what a Caprese Salad is: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ca..."A Caprese salad is a simple Italian salad, made of sliced fresh mozzarella, tomatoes and basil, seasoned with salt, and olive oil."On your menu, you call it "Mozzarella & Tomato Salad served w/ side of toast" - in Italian, that's a Caprese Salad (one of the most typical and basic and popular appetizers in Italy).  I definitely ordered from Grimaldi's in Hoboken at 411 Washington Street for lunch, and it wasn't busy.  I don't remember who helped us, and yes we brought it up.  They offered to put the pizza back in the oven, but we had already waited a while and were hungry, AND the bottom was already severely burned/black, so we ate a slice and took the rest home.  Nothing was offered for the "Mozzarella and Tomato Salad served w/ side of toast."  Regardless, the mutz and tomato, even if it wasn't meant to be a Caprese salad, was sub-par in all the ways I described it in my original review. Thanks,KyleIn response to:"Kyle,We are sorry to hear this but are a little confused as we don't serve a caprese salad with basil or crustinis. If it weren't for the references to other Hoboken restaurants we would think this review was intended for a different restaurant entirely.We would appreciate if you could provide us more information so we can get to the root of the problem: what day were you there? For lunch or dinner? Did you bring it to the attention of the staff? Who was your server?All the best,Sean and Bernadette, Owners"
2015-04-30,5,Best White Pizza with Garlic I have ever had.Dont add any toppings as such. Pizza and the Mozzarella cheese was fantastic.-Would love to come again!
2015-04-28,4,Food great. Service is great, but it's an Italian restaurant.... Great Margherita pizza ...it's my fave!.......What's up with the country music. During the day?
2015-04-13,5,I was looking for a brick oven pizza place & I walks past this place. I saw people eating outside enjoying their pizzas. I went inside & was seated right away. The service was great & the food was even better. I had the buffalo chicken pie & garlic bread  definitely recommend this place.
2015-04-08,4,Good for your pizza fix without going into Manhattan, but it tastes better in NYC. Ambience: Better than the other Grimaldi's on Clinton Street. You can actually hear yourself think here. I enjoy the open kitchen. Food: I come here to get my pizza fix without crossing bridge and tunnels and waiting an hour in line. While the crust was thin and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, there was a bit missing from my Marguerite pizza. I felt like it needed some meat on it because it lacked flavor. It wasn't that pure taste of heaven that I remembered from previous Marguerite experiences. Bathrooms: clean, no complaints here
2015-04-07,5,This pizza is absolute perfection! We always order take out there and have not found a pizza in Hoboken to top this one! It is always so fresh, hot, and delicious. The people there are friendly and it is great that you can watch them cook your pizza. We always take our friends and family to this place and their prices are reasonable.
2015-04-05,1,Worst service, dumb server, flat soda 2 times and uncooked toppings with a watery soggy pizza destroyed my image of this Brooklyn offshoot forever. Always go to main branch never satellite sites!
2015-03-27,5,The Mrs. and I had a truly delightful experience over at Grimaldis last night!  All the ingredients were super fresh and the service was brisk.  Will most assuredly be returning soon!
2015-03-26,4,Great service, our waiter was heelarious.  Warm ambiance, good times. Appetizers:Antipasto - salami, fresh mozz, home-roasted red peppers, toasted bread, pretty good. Fried mozz - thick slabs of mozz breaded with Guinness. Whaaaat?? Yummy. The pomodoro sauce on top was SO good. Wish it was on the side tho so the mozz stays crispy. Entree:Large regular with sausage and mushroom - yum, crust was SO good.  Wine:House chianti - pretty good, only $18 a bottle, $15 at the barDessert:Amaretto ice cream - yum. Cannoli - one of the better tasting cannoli creams we've had with a super crispy crust. YUM. Will def be back. :)
2015-03-18,2,Let me just start by saying, I am a pizza addict. From all the hype I heard from other people about this place, I have to say, I was not impressed. It doesn't taste like your classic NY/NJ pizza to me. Granted, it's pizza and it wasn't badly cooked or anything, it's just not that good to me. And for this location, I went in the afternoon on a weekday when there was hardly anyone else in the restaurant and we were there for HOURS because of how slow our waiter was. He took forever to ask for our orders, even bring us the salad, and then waiting to take our card at the end took so long because he was busy hanging out with the other workers in the back to notice us. Horrible service.
2015-03-12,4,We went wth group of friends and were promptly seated. I had the Margherita pizza which was tasty and liked the doughy crust. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food as well. The staff was attentive, would def come back!
2015-03-12,5,Grimaldis was my first authentic NYC style pizza. Coming from Michigan and being familiar with Chicago style and the rivalry, I was thoroughly impressed by the pie here.Grimaldis ingredients are brought in everyday. The dough is made every morning. Now, I believe that a crust makes or breaks a pizza. The stone oven makes the crust chewy but crispy. I couldn't believe how great it was.I get the vibe that the margherita is the go to style, and after trying it, I would definitely recommend it. If I'm ever in Hoboken again, I'll be sure to stop by again.
2015-02-15,5,I loved this place (Washington St location).  My friend and I went last Thursday night, both for the first time.  We arrived on the earlier side and the place was empty but by the time we left every table was full (always a good sign).Our waiter was attentive and helpful.We both ordered a personal pizza/wine.  I got the regular pizza + green peppers.  It was soooo tasty and fresh.  I had a slice leftover for lunch the next day too!  Two words: jealous co-workers.The only con here is you can't go "topping-wild" if you're on a budget as they charge you something like $2-4 for each one (sad face).  Despite this, I can't wait to go back.
2015-01-19,3,I'm not sure if I'm missing something with all the great reviews. I live in Hoboken and summer nights I like to go there and enjoy their outdoor dining. I really like the "oven-baked" concept but as far as oven baked pizza goes it's not the best (note: all pizza is oven baked). I find the pizza very difficult to hold in a messy/floppy way. I do think it's fresh but just not particularly flavorful pizza. If you are a fan of margerita type pies with a lot of sauce with a few interspersed pieces of mozzarella, you might be a fan. I really like the pizza at the hoboken hot house, which is similar price point but tastes better
2015-01-18,4,Great pizza, decent service. Best pizza in Hoboken at either location. Ambiance is better at this location than Clinton but is usually more crowded.
2015-01-14,4,Funny how a couple friends and I, visiting Hoboken, happened upon Grimaldi's while we were scoping out our dining choices.Me: I want pizza.Friend 1: I want wine.Friend 2: I want to dine in.Look up and we were staring at what looked like a good bet.  The interior was nicer than I expected for dinner--casual but had ambiance, date-worthy, even.  The layout is a little awkward walking in, but that is minor.We ordered a medium white pizza with broccoli, tomato, and ricotta.  First thing that unanimously came to mind when we bit into our slices was "fresh".The pizza was great, and we devoured it as elegantly as we could.  The slices were a little "floppy" and hard to hold, but no one was complaining.  It tasted amazing.Hop on Yelp to find that we happened upon one of the best pizza places in the city.  How awesome is that?
2015-01-12,4,I love this place. Solid choice. Been there a few times and always good experience. But staff can be overwhelmed at times with customers. Don't expect too much attention. Pizza is always very tasty and probably one of the best in the city (NJ included).
2015-01-05,5,I finally took my sister and her boyfriend here when they visited. This wasn't my first time eating Grimaldi's but I think in the past, I was letting my uptown bias affect my perception of Grimaldis. I didn't want to believe that Grimaldi's was better than my usual uptown pizza place (Napoli's). But after getting a margherita pizza here this last time, I had to finally admit to myself that Grimaldi's has an edge on Napoli's.
2015-01-03,5,*medium pizza with olives and mushrooms (loved the crust!!!!!!! Chewy and crispy and not too thin nor thick; held up well with the sauce and toppings)*calzone with sausage (omg, amazing!! The creaminess of the ricotta and then chewiness of mozzarella cheese with the dough of the calzone and meat inside ... winning combination! and the SAUCE that comes with this is sooooooooooooooooooo money!!! I can drink that sauce and was close to drinking it straight out of that bowl. I don't know what magic they put into it, but all I know is that I will be thinking about it)Grimaldi's is a great Hoboken establishment. Among all the bars and cheap eats around, this place is a reminder that Hoboken still has good food. Service is great. Food is great. I will definitely be back!
2014-12-13,3,Pizza is decent. Pass on the mozzarella cakes though, they are soggy and gross. Chicken wings weren't bad.
2014-11-25,5,Good bartender, quick service.   A bit pricey but still hits the spot.  Better than most nj nyc pizza.
2014-11-11,5,Amazing Pizza!!!! This is the only place to get pizza in Hoboken! Beautiful location, the staff is hysterical, and it's really not too expensive. This place makes me happy to live in Hoboken.
2014-11-09,4,Medium pizza -mushrooms, ham and sliced tomatoes- 4 starsHouse salad: 4stars. It was simple, I liked the flavor but it was pretty standard, nothing special.Total: $32.90
2014-11-03,5,Grimaldi's pizza really did live up to my expectations.  Crispy crust with just the right amount of cheese and sauce.  One of the better pizzas that I have ever had....no joke.  Comfortable atmosphere with no pretentions and I would not hesitate to return.
2014-10-19,5,Delicious fresh made pizzas!!. Love the garlic bread and the pizza's. The ambience is perfect for a cozy weekend dinner. Yummm is the word !
2014-10-16,4,Good pizza and Calzone.  Price was good and very well located in the center of Hoboken.
2014-10-13,5,Best pizza in Hoboken, along with being a nice restaurant you can't go wrong with Grimaldi's for a nice sit down meal or takeout/delivery.Did I say how awesome the pizza is? It is excellent, quality fresh made pizza!
2014-09-01,5,Excellent cheese garlic bread as an appetizer. Good service. Food came out pretty fast. Margherita pizza was awesome. Do yourself a favor in Hoboken and swing by Grimaldi's. It's better than the one in Manhattan.
2014-08-31,5,Really tasty pizza, just add sliced tomato on it and thank me later.
2014-08-22,5,This place is very friendly and surprisingly very big (there's an upstairs) I'm really glad I saw the reviews on this place b/c the other places were kind of disappointing to look at the reviews.. Other Italian restaurants close by had reviews like "I found a fly on my spaghetti" or "I found a hair". So yep. This place seems pretty clean. They sell PIZZA, SPAGHETTI, and WINGS. So, it's really good for family.
2014-08-08,1,Price - Almost $35 for 2 person sharing one pizza (that too w/o any meat)... Obscenely pricy Food - Very ok. The pizza becomes soggy by the time you are on 2nd slice. Moreover, hardly any option Ambience - Below average for the price they chargeService - Average. Summary - Will never go again.. sorry
2014-08-07,1,We waited hours for someone to take our order,  hours to be served, hours for for the check and hours for someone to bring back our credit card! It was crazy,  especially since the restaurant was half empty! I can barely imagine how it can be during week-ends!
2014-08-05,5,Best. Pizza. Ever. Grimaldi's has essentially ruined pizza for me because I am only satisfied with pizza from Grimaldi's. Whenever I am forced to have pizza somewhere else, I take a bite and I throw it against the window because it does not even come close to comparing. I now consider myself a pizza snob and I visit this pizzeria at least two times a month. I would visit once a week if I did not live 30 minutes away. If you have not yet had the pizza here, you haven't had pizza.
2014-07-30,3,Date night and pizza night in one? YES. We chose to sit outside, so I'm unsure what the space is like in there. The outdoor seating was lovely so the boyfriend and I got to watch all the babies and puppies go by. The waitress, perhaps on her first day?, didn't bring us menus or silverware and had to be reminded (twice) about them.The pizza was decidedly meh. While plentiful, the sauce lacked flavor and despite paying $4 for roasted peppers to be added, they were few and far between and also rather bland. I also grew up in the midwest, so I am used to a lot more cheese than what came out. However, that's just how New York pizza works, so no points deducted there. The crust was lovely, but that's pretty much about it.Honestly, I feel like I'm being too generous giving it three stars instead of two, but because the other pizza places in Hoboken aren't much better, this is still the best you can get while in town.
2014-07-27,5,What should I say? Grimaldi's is legendary in the city, and I am gold there is a branch in Hoboken so that I don;t need to line up for the pizza.Pepperoni, mushrooms, spinach and olives for topping is my secret combination. I think its classic and tasty. And the pizza is always as excellent as I expect. I have nothing to say. If you are a tourist, you should come. If you need nearby, you definitely have been to here. If you just pass by and want to find a good place to eat, Grimaldi's is always a safe play!
2014-07-25,4,Visiting from the Southeast, I'm always excited to get some of the best pizza ever. Nothing like it down south. A friend local to Hoboken recommended it to us, and we've learned to listen to the locals. We ordered a basic pizza with sausage and mushrooms. The sauce was excellent and toppings were fresh. A particularly delicious combination. I discovered Grimaldi has an IPA and decided to give it a try. Very smooth with a good overall hoppy taste. Not too bitter as some tend to be. Overall, a great lunch experience. Will definitely visit again next time we're in town.
2014-06-21,4,Excellent pizza cooked to perfection. Very fresh ingredients. Grimaldi's sauce is delicious. My husband and I also shared the eggplant parmesan which was surprisingly very good. Luckily we arrived about 5pm and were seated immediately but shortly thereafter the restaurant filled up and there was a long wait. Not sure if it is the same on weekdays or because we were there on a Saturday. Honestly though the food was so good worth the wait.
2014-06-03,5,I live within a few feet of this place so needless to say, I'm there often. The Mozz cakes and eggplant parm are my absolute favorites! I'll get the pizza when it comes with the bottle of wine deal because that special is just too hard to pass up, but I'm really just so addicted to the mozz & eggplant! The atmosphere is cozy. The owner is a sweetheart and the whole staff in general is so friendly (especially my faves Mark, Seth & Fin!) If you're looking for a family-orientated place that makes you feel like you're at home, this is it!
2014-05-17,4,Despite NOT being a fan of pizzas i LOVED their pizza! Crunchy thin flavorful base... I am clawing back on the fifth star only because they were not flexible with the toppings... We wanted something heat in our toppings and they wouldn't even do jalapenos :(Also, the red sangria is the BESTTTT I've EVER had.... Really nothing to complain about!
2014-05-13,5,This place is a lot fancier than I expected. Actually kind of perfect for a casual date. I mean it's got table cloths and silverware and everything. We got there at 6:30pm on a Friday night and found the place pretty empty. As a result we got pretty quick, friendly and straight forward service. We placed our order and within seconds I was watching the guy behind the glass making our pizza. We got a medium half mushroom and half meatball. I have to say that this pizza lived up to all the hype and great reviews. It was baked perfect and had just the right balance of crust, sauce, and cheese. Can't wait to go back and have it again!
2014-05-12,2,I typically like a think crust/brick oven style pizza, but found this version to be completely lacking in any flavor whatsoever (I believe the sauce is to blame for this). The crust wasn't even particularly thin, so it was extra chewy (in a bad way) and only served to emphasize the lack of flavor. The meatballs and spaghetti was OK (the meat had good flavor to make up for the same no-flavor sauce). I got a mixed salad that was totally wilted and sorta gross. The ceasar looked better.
2014-05-11,4,Can you say FRESH? This place is classy when it comes to pizza made the traditional Italian way-not NYC STYLE, so let's get that out of the way. Again this is not   the typical New York style pizza you get that from all the other conveyor belt chains and typical oven (brick style) pizza.This is coal or wood fired pizza that uses a thin dough pizza, fresh mozzarella balls-not the stuff NYC is made of (shredded mozzarella), and fresh veggies galore. The pizza oven burns around 700-900 degrees and cooks most pizzas in 10 minutes or less. The coal is loaded from the bottom and rises on one side of the oven that measures 4x6 or 5x8 feet easily accommodates several pizzas at a time. The smoke and singed pizza bottom gives the pizza a nice taste. The dough balls weigh around 8-10 ounces and are slammed against a marble slab to develop the gluten & elasticity this produces a nice thin crust which most folks love.Our pizza tasted great and the mozzarella was chewy & plentiful. My only issue was the spinach which when raw produces to much moisture and this leads to a wet pizza-yuck. So don't get spinach on these pizzas and most other dry ingredients should do well.So, why not 5 stars? The service was not attentive and they ran out of Coca Cola syrup. Note: I am a well balanced in my approach to food that entails me being a professional cook with many years experience in many types of cuisines from Latin America, Greek, Italian, and many more. I take food as the ultimate pleasure in life along with many other things. I give my reviews based on my experiences eating out at least 2 times a day and 5-6 days a week. I rarely give 1 stars and most restaurants get an average rating 3 stars, with some very good restaurants or places receiving 4 stars, and those that stand out receive 5 stars.
2014-04-28,3,Went there last night to pick-up a small calzone and a house salad. My order was $33 dollars for these two items alone, which I  found to be extremely overpriced. Before leaving I asked if they included sauce on the side for my calzone. The woman who rung me up told me no and then proceeded to charge me an extra $2 for a small side of sauce. Like many of the other reviews on here, I feel like an item such as sauce should be included especially with the calzones. With that said the food was delicious, but maybe they should consider including items such as sauce if they are going to charge such a high price to begin with.
2014-03-30,3,Good pizza, but a severe lack of variety. All things considered though, I'd go again.
2014-03-30,4,Came here because we heard the Gluten Free pizza was good.We weren't disappointed. The GF pie comes  as a personal size at 10'We ordered 1 each and an antipasto. Antipasto and both pies were very good and very filling. We could have easily ordered only 1 pie and the antipasto.Only 4 stars because the waiter was a little slow with refills and I don't recall him asking if we needed anything else after we ordered. Nothing against him as he was still nice!
2014-03-19,5,Great pizza! I love new haven pizza and this place is the best brick oven pizza I've had in the nj/ny area. It's fresh and delicious! It's a clean place (you can even see them making the pizza), reasonable prices and not small portions (like razza - another brick over place in jersey city, which I think is totally overrated). I cannot wait to eat at this place again!
2014-03-19,4,If you've ever had pizza in Hoboken, jam a pencil in my ear and stab your brain in the hopes of forgetting about that pizza then head to Grimaldi's after your hospital trip. So far, this is the best pizza I've had in Hoboken.  The menu is really limited which is fine by me, do the pizza and do it right.  The pizza crust had that thin crust crunch and was chewy afterwards.  They aren't stingy with the toppings either (Even though they charge an arm and a leg for each topping you get.)  Try not to add too many toppings, not just for the fact that you'll go broke but they weigh down the pizza and will make it hard to eat.  Also, they add plenty of sauce and cheese.Looking at the restaurant from the outside, it seems like they have limited seating.  However, Grimaldi's has a whole back room too so you won't have to wait.  The service is pretty standard; nothing to complain about but, nothing to rave about.Since you're gonna pay an arm and a leg to get pizza anywhere in Hoboken, you may as well spend the cash and do it right!
2014-03-03,1,AWFUL experience here! From the service, to the food and the atmosphere (mainly music). First of all, they were blaring punk rock from the early 2000s, don't get me wrong, I was all about Blink 182 and the The Used in middle school, but I don't want to hear them while I'm trying to have a nice dinner with friends. The waitress spilled an entire beer all over our table and one of my friends. They didn't offer us a new table and barely helped clean it up so we just sat with a puddle under our table. Our food was brought out sporadically, not all together, which was annoying since we had a party of 6 and obviously all wanted to eat together. When the waitress brought my ravioli out to me she again spilled some sauce on my lap. The food itself was TERRIBLE! The calzones were burned on the bottom (black) and the pasta was over-cooked and soggy. We ended up just eating the food because we were on a time frame and didn't want to have to wait for more food. The waitress was apologetic. Everything was overpriced for the quality and amount of food that we got. Our checks and billing got all mixed up and the waitress couldn't seem to figure things out. We asked to speak to the manager just to bring things to her attention. She was extremely rude. We weren't expecting any favors or free handouts, just a simple "sorry." She had the nerve to argue with us and say that the food was just "crisp" because they bake it in a coal oven...no lady, it was BURNED. She also said that she's never received any complaints before, which I fine extremely hard to believe. She continued to defend everything, never fully apologizing or offering us anything. I'm not one to complain much about food or dining experiences. Having worked in the restaurant industry for years, I know it's hectic at times. But I also know that customers should be treated with respect and courtesy. After the experience that we had, I'd never recommend this place to anyone.
2014-03-02,3,Pretty good pizza here though unfortunately for them I have New York taste buds and we tend to be very peculiar about our pizza...We ordered a large pizza with Italian sausage and mushrooms, Caesar salad and wine. The house wines are very good strong but not too sweet. The Caesar salad was simply romaine lettuce chopped up with croutons and Caesar dressing nothing really fantastic. The pizza was as I mentioned above, pretty good. Very fresh ingredients with strips of basil running through real melted mozzarella blobs. The sauce was crushed tomatoes with a little added sugar and that is the reason for three stars.The sauce completely lacks flavor, and to me this is an essential part to the pizza. It should compliment the toppings not make me wonder why it is even there in the first place. Anyway the dough is excellently made and everything is perfectly baked when it comes to your table.Service is very good, expect everyone working there to greet you.
2014-02-19,5,It's been a year since I have been here so sorry for the late review. Pizza was excellent... Reason I am adding this review is because I will be back with the family this weekend for lunch and I am hoping it lives up to the hype I have been throwing around to the family! See you soon and will give an updated review.
2014-02-05,2,has gone downhill, riding on the coat tails of it's past glory.Ingredients have diminshed in quality, and the kitchen is filthy.
2014-01-30,4,These people make one delicious pie.  I've had take out in the past and just thought this place was decent, but I just learned that I was missing out due to my lazy nonsense. Three of us shared the large pie with mushrooms.  1-2 toppings is sufficient because beyond that, it starts getting insanely expensive, as I accidentally found out last time. The pizza came out hot with bubbling mozzarella and all from the oven. My favorite thing about pizza is the long cheese bridge that gets created as you pull the slice away, and this pie did it! The tomato sauce is clearly made in house and the mushrooms were fresh (none of that soggy canned nonsense).  The crust is salted well and has that nice browned flour flavor.  Topped with garlic powder and red pepper flakes, pizza heaven was created. We left really full and still had one slice left.  I think I'll continue to visit their shop rather than getting it to go.  Those minutes in the box really take away from the awesomeness that is Grimaldi's.
2014-01-26,2,we just ordered a large mushroom and sausage pizza, a take out. it was ready earlier than expected already somewhat cold, crust burned, and rest - watery, the dough was SOAKED. Couldn't eat by hand as we usually do, wouldn't hold. This place is charging 23+tax and getting worse. every time i give it another try because of close proximity to my home, hoping it will be better, hope... not worth it.
2014-01-21,4,I'm definitely a big fan of Grimaldi's.  They use high quality ingredients, and the pizza's are always delicious.  I think my only issue is that if you try to get takeaway, or delivery, the pizza will most likely be fairly cold by the time you eat it.  It's a thin crust pizza, so it's expected and I know it's not their fault.... it's just natural that if you have a thinner pizza it's going to cool faster.  But that's the biggest reason I don't eat their pizza more often.  I just save my Grimaldi's for when I can eat in the restaurant and get it right out of the oven.
2014-01-08,5,My first taste of Gramaldi's was in DUMBO at a point of near starvation (perhaps a bit of an exaggeration) after having waited the typical 2+ hours for a table at the highly sought after joint. Need not fret artisnal pizza lovers, Gramaldi's Hoboken offers the same great taste, without the long wait or obscenely cramped layout. Not particularly trendy, simple / traditionally classy and just plain good. Can't go wrong when choosing a pie at Grimaldi's, just do your party a favor and order a round of fried motz to start, manja!
2014-01-08,5,Threw a birthday party for my boyfriend for 25 people here. They were sooo accommodating and nice! The manager and staff were helpful, sweet and did not seem annoyed by us at all (we were getting pretty rowdy).And of course, the food was amazing as always! Eggplant pizza and buffalo chicken pizza were everybody's faves. Also, it turned out to be only like $30 per person including drinks, appetizers, pizzas and dessert.LOVE grimaldi's!
2013-12-30,5,I'm definitely not or have ever been a pizza lover, but this place has stolen my heart. My favorite appetizer was the mozzarella cake (the cheese is amazingly fresh). The pizza is yum. The dough is perfect- just thick enough to be of some substance without carb overload. Our waiter was so friendly and chatty but not annoying. The Pinot I downed was also pretty decent, and I can pretty confidently say that it didn't come from a ten dollar bottle. I want to bring everyone here!
2013-12-18,4,Love this place! I live in the Southern U.S so I try to come by when I'm in Jersey. It never disappoints. Great food and great service!
2013-11-29,5,Grimaldi's vs Lombardi's? You win, Grimaldi's!Grimaldi's pizza is the best I have ever had in my life. I had a chance to try both Lombardi's and Grimaldi's while I was in New York and for me, Grimaldi's pizza was much much better.Our waiter had the cutest smile and the service was exceptional, not what I have expected at a pizza parlor. The problem now is I am back in Cali and I am already craving their pizza. Well, back to Papa johns.  :( My three year old and I will miss your pizza very much!
2013-11-10,1,Ok so I don't often write reviews but I just finished our first grimaldi's pizza and all I can say is disappointed. We moved to Hoboken a couple of months ago and decided it was time to try some pizza, reviews seemed great... But this was overpriced and nothing spectacular. Yes the crust was thin the way we like it but $27 for a sausage peppers and onions lg pizza is ridiculous. I mean for that price I should be wowed and there definitely should be more than three small pieces of sausage per slice...anyway like I said just plain disappointed, will continue the search for our go to pizza joint :(
2013-11-07,3,Ehh this place is OK. Ive.had.better pizza. I think its pricey for pizza too - which id be okay with if it was outstanding but id say it's just acceptable.
2013-10-15,3,Went at around 2 and got a personal pizza. It was good but not exceptional. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back.
2013-09-08,4,Very nice place. Had their cheese pizza, very tasty! Brick oven goodness with a nice quality sauce and cheese...fresh basel gave it a nice fresh kick!Clean, good service.  We sat at the bar, so very quick! Washington Street in Hoboken...what more do you want!
2013-09-06,4,Amazing pizza.  Music selection seems off though, which can kind of ruin the whole experience.  This location is bigger/nicer than the old one on Clinton and 2nd, but there was something charming about the old place.
2013-09-01,5,Fantastic. The pizza was fantastic. The waitress was nice and very helpful. The personal pizza was very filling. Topped it off with a little bottle of Prosecco. The live performer was good also. I had an amazing time and would go again.
2013-08-30,5,Best pizza anywhere. Perfect thin crust.  Real cheese. Suggest sausage roasted red peppers and onions. Eating in can be chaotic - typical Hoboken loud crowd. We call and in less than 15 minutes we pickup our pie and walk 1 block home.
2013-08-21,3,I had Grimaldi's in NYC years ago and loved it, so I was pretty excited about checking out the Hoboken Grimaldi's this time around. Overall, the pizza was solid, but some of the apps and desserts just weren't that good. The tiramisu didn't taste that authentic and the tomatoes in the mozzarella tomato salad were lacking any kind of flavor. Ok for pizza, but next time I think I'll pass on everything else.
2013-08-15,2,For me, this pizza was ok. I've had better at Mozza in LA, Paulie G's in Brooklyn and Porta in Asbury, NJ.The dough was ok, the chew was ok, everything was just ok. I guess I expected better.
2013-08-11,4,Took a trip over to the big apple not too long ago and had to spend some time in Hoboken before going through the tunnel because there was SO much traffic. My friend and I got pretty hungry and Yelped some places in the area, this one came up with pretty good reviews so we gave it a try. It was pretty darn good. The place felt very Italian and authentic and the prices were great.We ordered a small pepperoni and split it between the two of us and still left with leftovers for later, spending much less than we would have spent other places getting our own dinners.The pepperoni was great, not too greasy; the cheese was authentic fresh mozzarella; overall it was great!Don't get me wrong, I loved pizza in NY too but for more authentic Italian pizza, this was great!
2013-08-04,4,Pizza is made fresh from scratch. It's definitely the show stopper, light and crunchy crust, not too heavy. A 12 inch pizza serves 3 hungry people. Reasonably priced. Would certainly go back again.
2013-08-04,4,Three of us had an eggplant, sausage, and ricotta pizza. Overall, it's a good pizza, but I wouldn't say it's best I've ever tried. It was a little on the soggy side, but that may just be the toppings we chose.
2013-07-28,4,Yum!! Love this great Brooklyn style pizza place. A must  pick up for any Friday night. Ask for the pizza well done and you wont be sorry. Thin crispy crust ,fresh sauce , and killer mozz. The best margherita pizza in Hoboken. Solid pizza joint.
2013-07-28,5,Ate at the bar with a friend. Staff are awesome, and the margherita pizza was delicious. Restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating. Solid place for a Saturday night dinner!
2013-07-15,3,Came here for lunch on Sunday with Alessia A, wasn't packed but everyone was inside since it was a scorcher that day.We split a half mushroom / half pepperoni pizza and washed it down with prosecco. We're classy broads, I know. I personally thought the pizza was decent, solid brick oven pizza. Not the most exciting flavor options. If you're going to keep it simple, make it amazing. The pizza was a little bland for liking and a bit dough-ey, but it was by no means bad pizza. I just wasn't floored.Also, the service was so-so. Three different waiters asked us the same question one after another, like coordinate or something. A bit disorganized but still courteous and helpful, overtly actually.
2013-07-13,4,Damn good pizza so good we wanted another pie. Next time I go back im taking a pretty lady  :)
2013-07-09,4,Best pizza I've had in jersey. Also , sauce on the spaghetti and meatballs was excellent. Very attentive staff.
2013-07-08,4,Came here for lunch and i'm glad I did. We shared a large pie - half plain, half white and it was great. They used fresh mozz. The service was quick and friendly. They have outdoor seating. Still think Johnny's is better. But this place is also pretty great!
2013-06-27,3,This place has a lot of hype but I'm not buying into it. I came here with a group of friends and we sat upstairs. Our server was horrible. The prices aren't great and I didn't think the pizza was either. One was pretty badly burnt on the bottom. It was okay, but I dont get why everyone raves about this place so much?
2013-05-24,4,I'm from Chicago so I think I know a thing about pizza.  This is some good pizza!!!!   We started with the fried mozzarella and this is not to be missed!  You get a plate of fresh mozzarella in a yummy batter with the freshest marinara sauce smothering the pucks of melted goodness.  They nailed it!  I'm not talking about your average mozzarella stick here.  No matter what you get , you have to get the fried mozzarella!!!  The pizza is really good too.  Its more like brick oven pizza and they use very fresh ingredients and the pizza is very flavorful.  Next time Im in NJ, I will be back!
2013-04-02,3,3.5 - very good, though probably a little overrated.  Got pepperoni, plain, meatball and sausage.
2013-03-28,2,Maybe the chef had a bad night...but the pizza was bland and undercooked....soft dough, pools of juice from the tomatos and hard crunchy pieces of garlic.  Just wasn't worth the $50 for 2 pizzas. Very disappointing considering the reputation.
2013-03-24,3,We came here for lunch, a total of 3 of us.  We ordered a small pizza with sausage.  It was thin crust so we managed to finish it with no problem.  I thought the large was going to be too big but I guess we could've ordered it.
2013-02-07,3,I really love the pizza here -- it is the best I've had in Hoboken. But the service is really horrible! The waitress took ages before she checked in on us to take our order then it took ages for us to get our pizza. I was getting extremely hangry. Don't go here if you're starved because they won't feed you quickly, that's for sure!
2013-01-18,5,hands down best pizza in hoboken. its not too thick, not too oily, and the toppings are always fresh and delicious. any time anyone wants pizza, i suggest grimaldis. even the plain cheese pizza is amazing.
2013-01-05,4,On New Year's Eve my boyfriend and I came here for dinner on a whim. Inside it wasn't busy at all and the muted lighting was inviting and made the seating area look cozy. When we walked in we were greeted by the hostess and given a table right next to the pizza preparing table and fire brick oven. What a dangerous place to put tubs of fresh mozzarella pieces because I could have tried reaching up to grab a piece (and I wanted to but I have great self control). I also saw close by a tub of the most amazing pepperoni. I had a feeling the pizza was going to blow my mouth's mind.Looking at the menu we both wished there were more options for small appetizers but then again it was probably a good thing because we tend to over do it. We wanted to start off with some drinks and ordered two Bloody Mary's. Our waitress must have misheard because she only brought me one. We were too lazy to do anything about it so we didn't say anything. I had also witnessed the bartender putting the V8 away and would have felt weird making him take everything out again. The Bloody Mary wasn't the best I've ever had but it was enjoyable. It could have used more pepper and spice. It was also a bit too watery for my taste. I like my Bloody Mary's to be slightly thick.We ended up ordering a small spinach and pepperoni pizza. The wait time was maybe 20-30 minutes even though the actual cooking time for our pizza wasn't that long--I saw it being prepared and put into the oven. When the waitress brought our pie over it looked amazing and fresh.The amount of cheese was just right and the pepperoni was so good it almost tasted like hot dogs. Usually I'm underwhelmed by crust and once the cheese and toppings part is gone I leave the rest. But the dough was light and delicious by itself. I ate everything up.One thing that annoyed me service wise was a gentleman who kept arriving at our table assuming I was done eating and almost retrieving the rest of the pizza while I tried to say I wasn't finished with food in my mouth. He did this twice as though the place was busy as a beehive but it never was while we were there. I don't think they were closing any time soon because a party of people were dining on the upper floor.Another thing that got on my nerves was hearing that AWFUL Sister Hazel song while there but that's beside the point. I had never heard of Grimaldi's before but apparently they're well known for having great pizza. Well it's true! The next time I'm in Hoboken and craving pizza this will be the first place I think of hitting up.
2013-01-04,4,Ate: Medium mushroom and pepperoni pizzaDrank: WaterLiked: Short wait, fast pizza, cheap dinner, yummy!Disliked: N/AChicken: On a pizza?  nah.Would mom like it?: Mom actually likes pizza but will promise you that she doesn't.Would I go back: Yep!  I liked the Clinton St one more, but this is just as good.Recommend: Be wary, toppings are expensive...
2012-12-16,4,The better of the two Hoboken locations.  In our dozen or so visits, we haven't tried anything other than the antipasto and pizza with meatballs because they are spectacular.  Pairs perfectly with their hoppy house beer.
2012-11-30,4,Deliciouspizzabeeryum.definitely the place to go and relax, eat pizza, have a good time, and drink.ill be going again.
2012-11-09,4,I had the famed Grimaldis at the Brooklyn Bridge once before and I was not a fan at all. This Hoboken location impressed me and Grimaldis redemption was had. You really can't go wrong with coal oven pizza. There is just really something special about it. I suggest creating your own pie but their price per topping is outrageous.  $2 for chopped garlic. Really?! Though our spinach, garlic, ricotta creation was dear god heavenly. My buddy let me snag a slice of his sausage and peppers and I swooned. The only downside, service sucked. Our waiter dude really had zero personality and he seemed to be annoyed that we needed extra time when ordering. Pizza's good so I'll just grab it to-go next time.
2012-11-08,2,Service. We walked in around 8pm on a thursday. Place was mostly empty and we waited at the please wait here to be seated sign for a few minutes not knowing if anyone even knew we were there.... Waitress was friendly, but did not know what a scotch "neat" meant.We sat there for about 5 minutes before anyone even offered us a menu.Drinks. Glenlivet neat took over 5 minutes to get to us with nobody in the restaurant. Bar was full tho. Took 1 sip and my gf noticed pieces of old lemon pulp and other stuff floating around in my glass. Nasty.My girlfriend ordered a white Russian which took a long amount of time to get to us as well. Drink came without ice and at room temp. I Have never had a white Russian not chilled or served over ice before, but ok. Never the less.nasty. Waitress was accommodating when we asked for new drinks. Pizza : flavor was a bit bland, and pizza was soggy. I think I would have liked it if it was crispy. Theory, pizza came out super fast, 5 minutes after ordering. Usually a large pie made fresh takes at least 10-15 minutes. Maybe it wasn't fresh ?We do not plan returning.
2012-10-18,4,Amazing Garlic Bread that is basically made out of the same pizza crust...the fried/baked mozz dish was also tasty...the regular pizza was just average...nothing to rave about...
2012-10-17,3,Grimaldi's is a good place to go if you wanna split a pie with friends or family in a fancier setting. I came here with my parents for a plain pie and the mozzarella and tomato appetizer. I could do without the appetizer, it wasn't as fresh as I'd hoped, but the pizza was good. It sort of reminds me of a Goodfella's pie, but there is something distinct about Grimaldi's sauce that sets it apart-- I think it carries a more tart bite than most pizzas I've eaten.I was kinda disappointed when I found out they really don't have anything I like to enjoy with pizza, like garlic knots, zeppoles, orange soda... c'mon now! My boyfriend has been wanting to try it out so I'll go back to appease him.
2012-10-15,4,This is other Grimaldis in Hoboken. It's a solid pizza stop.It's similar to the Clinton St one in pizza quality - so what you're getting there, you're getting here. If you've never been to the Clinton Grimaldis, that means you're getting a delicious pie of pizza. I actually think I like the decor inside here a little bit better. I always stick with a pepperoni pie and I love to eat it here. This is a very comfortable location to sit at and enjoy your pizza inside. They also have seating outside if that's your thing.You won't have issues finding seating here. It's a pretty roomy location. You'll have heard horror stories of the waits that entail the Brooklyn Grimaldis, but be rest assured, none of that is happening here. If you're in the mood to try a new pizza place in Hoboken, I would recommend this one.
2012-09-27,4,The standard pizza was EXCELLENT!!  Hot, fresh mozzarella and basilica on a thin crust, just a pleasure!  Now, the fresh Mozzarella on tomato w a lettuce crisp underneath....I was not happy. No seasoning on top, just a slab on slab. Now that is not Italia!  It was fresh and maybe for the casual diner, thats all they want. I would suggest that there be the option of a fresh olive oil, balsamic vinegar and crushed garlic with basilica be added for those of us that enjoy this tasty treat at home, dressed.  Just a suggestion. It's an amazing delight with those additions or even one of them! All in all, I was pleased to be able to park in front, clean eatery and bathrooms downstairs were clean as well. Nice decor and casual. I would definitely go back for the pizza!
2012-09-18,4,When we lived in Brooklyn, and happened to be driving home from somewhere, Grimaldi's under the bridge was our go to pizza place for a quick pie. The location was ideal coming back from Manhattan or wherever else. Now that we live in dirty Jerz, the Grimaldi's in Hoboken (not 1 but 2) satisfy the pizza urges nicely. Nice chewy crust, nice toppings, nice sauce, nice cheeze, nice employees. Nice locations. At this point you can't really split hairs if you live in the suburbs, like oh crap this crust isn't like Co. or there isn't something kitschy on top of this slice like Motorino or Keste.  After living in suburb nirvana and food hell, sitting at Grimaldi's  with the wifey, we can be at peace, lost in the zen of a solid slice of pizza, content with just alternating between staring at our pizzas before us and the smiles on our faces while chewing.  In case you get confused right behind Washington St. around 2nd street there is a giant muni parking, so don't get frustrated that you can't find a spot on the street.
2012-09-12,4,Excellent pizza, and unlike its Brooklyn counterpart, you won't be waiting forever to get in!
2012-07-30,3,Wasn't the best pizza I had... had a large party about 20, ordered 6 pies which happened to be way too much for us...the white pizza with garlic was ok, i was hoping for it to be better...the pepporoni was so good though, i am not a fan of pepporoni but their's was awesome...the soda was flat we can't bringing it back...ended up with the lemonade and water instead...the plain pizza was ok - too saucy though...
2012-07-24,4,Classic NY pie institution. I've been wanting to try Grimaldi's for years, but I couldn't be bothered to wait for hours in line at their original location in Brooklyn. Lucky me, this place is just blocks away from my current summer abode. Plenty of space, never a wait (maybe for a few minutes during peak weekend dinner hours), and the same great Grimaldi's pizza waiting for you here. We always get a large sausage pizza because we like taking leftovers home. Tasty thin crust, delicious savory sausage crumbles (I hate sausage slices), a coating of sauce, and enough mozzarella to make it cheesy, but not overwhelm everything else, and last but not least, fresh basil to add a little green and lightness.
2012-07-06,4,The pizza is SOLID. I knew it was going to be good, but I was suprised at HOW GOOD IT IS!!  i'm a minimalist when it comes to pizza, so I got plain and I just loved the ratio of sauce to cheese, not to mention the delicious fresh basil leaves!!Service leaves a lot to be desired at this particular location, and it could have been cleaner.  There were napkins and crumbs and other grossness around our table.
2012-07-02,3,It's pretty good pizza. They use fresh mozzarella and pack your pizza to go in a paper sleeve - like the old days, I suppose. In my opinion it is not amazing.
2012-06-27,1,Ok, lets start off by saying the pizza was great. Tasted amazing!But, what really got to me was the service. I came there around 5PM and wanted a pie and a cold beer.  We got seated in the back; and in the front is "3$ coors lite" ads. I simply asked for the special, and the waiter said I could not get that special where I was sitting. I was with my friend who was visiting from another country (and does not drink) and we wanted to sit away from everyone so we could catch up (not as the bar); however I wanted the special.The manager there (white hair, older man) was very rude; and when I went to the bar to ask the bartender about other drink specials he very loudly in front of me said "DO NOT LET HIM TAKE ANY DRINKS TO THE BACK" . Excuse me? Is that really worth the trouble of 2 dollars? We would have ordered more food and I personally would have ordered a few more rounds if it wasn't for this.Quite frankly, I will not recommend this place to anyone now because of this. The staff are all also young kids who do not seem to be professional or know how to run a place of business.
2012-06-26,5,I love Grimaldi's pizza.  The pizza tastes great, and I'd like to think it's not that unhealthy.
2012-05-24,5,I'm slightly ashamed to admit it, but with the right toppings, I think I could eat a whole pizza myself here.It's thin crust, but not crispy like some places, instead it's chewy. (Which is how I love my pizza).My two friends and I split a large pie with garlic, roasted red peppers, and meatballs... it sounds kind of odd, but it was delicious! We also split a caesar salad... and it was really good, not like some places where they coat it in dressing... I had been to the one on Clinton Street before, and I was pleased to see that it was just as great! One note-- I am a cheese fanatic, so, next time remind me that I want extra cheese!
2012-05-24,4,Great pizza! The crust is thin but not too thin, and they use fresh mozzarella and basil...yum! You have to try the mozzarella cakes. They will make you want to forget every fried cheese stick you've ever had.  They slice fresh mozzarella cheese, fry them, then top it off with the perfect marinara sauce. Go there now.
2012-05-22,2,Just because this place has a unique way of displaying their pizza (on an elevated tray) does not mean it is a unique or even special place to eat. On the contrary, I found their pizza to be extremely bland. The sauce pretty much tasteless (ketchup is more exciting) and the staff, keeping with Washington street tradition, appears over worked, apathetic and miserable. WAY over priced and boring. I have to admit, seeing their elevated trays and nice LOOKING pizza from the street lured me in but I will never return because Dominos pizza puts their taste to shame. Don't believe the hype; this place blows.
2012-04-30,4,Oh my dear Grimaldi,I walked by you yesterday and was reminded of your deliciousness!  Your crisp and perfectly thin crust, fresh mozzarella cheese and authentic pizza sauce that had me stuffing my belly until I couldn't eat anymore.I miss you and will be back soon. xoxo HP
2012-04-08,2,My first time at Grimaldi's... because I never wanted to subject myself to wait 3 hours under a bridge, in Brooklyn.It was way below my expectations because I thought if people (or tourists) were willing to wait outside for this pizza it must be amazing.  What false logic that was.  The location in Hoboken is very nice, right on Washington Street, ample street parking on a Saturday... but the pizza was just OK.  I think I am a fan of pizza with flavorful sauce and at Grimaldis it seems like they just use plain fresh tomato sauce.  I'm glad I got to try this without the lines and wait...  On to the next!
2012-03-15,4,Yummy pizza that is actually non-greasy! The best I've ever had. Took the  light rail with friends... Hope to come back the next time I'm on the east coast.
2012-03-11,4,We are from Texas so we used yelp reviews to find this restaurant. We were very impressed. Great pizza. Good service. My 2 boys liked it as well.
2012-03-07,5,My favorite pizza place in Hoboken, and one of my favorites anywhere.  I say "my favorite" instead of "the best" because pizza is a very personal thing.  Some people like thin crust, some people like thick crust, some people like a lot of cheese, some people like a little cheese, etc.  Grimaldi's has their own unique style.  Their pizza is on the thin side but not too thin.  They use chunks of mozzerella (instead of the usual layer of shredded mozzerella you see elsewhere), which gives the pizza its signature red and white blotches that resemble a work of art.  They don't load on the toppings like some other places do, rather they add just enough to enhance the overall flavor of the pizza.  And they cook their pizza to the perfect level of doneness.  When all these factors come together, they make a really incredible pie.  As an added bonus, they even have their own IPA, which is delicious and I order it every time.  Grimaldi's is great for an inexpensive yet delicious meal.  The atmosphere is always warm, cozy, and comforting.  And so is the food.
2012-03-04,5,Grimaldis is excellent not only because it is great tasting pizza, but it is different. Their margarita pie is as authentic Italian as pizza gets here...blobs of fresh mozzarella fresh sauce and fresh basil on thin, crispy crist. I definitely recommend getting pizza from Grimaldis. And as a tip...delivery is good, but eating there is best
2012-02-29,4,My husband and I moved out of Hoboken for a reason, but sometimes a person has to be there at dinnertime and requires some food for her pie hole. As we passed Grimaldi's we noticed a sign outside advertising a small pie plus a bottle of house wine for $25. My pie hole needed filling, so we headed inside straightaway. The deal is only for sitting at the bar and only on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Luckily for us, the place was pretty dead on a Tuesday evening at 8pm, which is surprising since the restaurant is fairly small and I have waited outside the Brooklyn location for an hour before being seated. There was only one other person at the bar and he seemed to be a regular and was definitely older than we are. I gotta say, I liked the vibe a lot: relaxed and not Hobokeny at all. Hey, that's a plus in my book! We chose the Cabernet Sauvignon. It was not a bad bottle of wine at all. In fact, I'm pretty sure I drank most of it and happily. To start off, we decided to split a salad. The one called "Salad" is rather tasty. It has a light Italian vinaigrette and shredded cabbage on top. We got sausage on our pizza (toppings are extra when you get the deal). There was some fresh basil on top and just the right amount of sausage. The so-called "small" pie is 16 inches, which is 6 big slices. Mind you, this is a very thin crust, so if you are hungry, you'll eat this pie right up, but if you are dainty (like I strive to be), 2 slices is plenty and you'll have leftovers. Pop that sucker in the toaster oven the next morning and you've got a killer breakfast. Oh god, I just said "killer." See?? This is what happens when a person spends any time at all in Hoboken.
2012-02-26,5,Everyone knows how much I absolutely love Grimaldi's, so I wanted to show some love for the Washington Street location as well. And this one is closer to my apartment...score!It does lose a little of the super casual vibe from the Clinton Street location, but they did a great job with this space. It's a little more upscale, with a nice big bar and two dining areas. It's also a little easier for big groups to be seated here. I've been to the Clinton Street location with big groups, and while I was never uncomfortable, this is just another option for people to enjoy this amazing pizza.The pizza and service are just as wonderful as they are at Clinton Street. No matter which location you go to, you're in for a treat!
2012-02-20,4,A completely different from the Brooklyn location. This place is only a couple years old now and has a really great semi-casual, warm, and romantic atmosphere inside. Lots of dark wood and a classic thick wooden bar. The servers are always friendly and fun. This is a nice place to grab a beer in Hoboken and avoid the mish mash if you aren't in the mood. The pizza is thin and has a little more refined quality than Benny Tudino's up the street.
2012-01-21,3,Pizza was very good but the service was mediocre.  Our waiter did a fine job, but the hostess was a bit rude and, despite there being at least a dozen open tables on the second floor of the restaurant, made us wait 20 minutes for a table.  If the pizza wasn't as good as it was, I would have given this place one star based on the less-than-cordial hostess.Go to the original location on Clinton Street.  Host and Hostess are really pleasant and make you feel welcome.
2012-01-12,4,Very good pizza. Too expensive and not completely meeting all the hype.
2012-01-09,5,We wanted a dressier atmosphere than the original location on Clinton st. This location is much nicer, and perfect for a simple dinner date. It can be overwhelming if you have trouble deciding on your pizza toppings like I do - but the key is to keep it simple. The pizza will be delicious thanks to the crust and delicious cheese they start with - just pick one or two toppings to put it over the top. Definitely awesome; Can't wait to go back!
2011-12-31,5,This was the fifth pizzeria of the day.  I thought that it's high rating might have been due to the excellent atmosphere when I walked in.  It's the nicest spot on the street, not like luxury but they spent money making it.  Even the bathroom was cased in travertine.  So naturally I thought that it may have been popular for this reason.  I'm from LA and atmosphere with service is what we do out there.  Pizza, however, is not!  By far the best pizza I've ever had and I walked in stuffed.  Oh and if you like hoppy IPAs the restaurant's brew is commendable as well.
2011-12-26,5,Great pizza, friendly service (but short handed) and good prices.  What else can you ask for.  We had Lombardi's 3 days ago, and we all agreed that Grimaldi's was better.
2011-12-26,5,Hands down the best pizza in Hoboken.  The original location on 2nd St. is just as good.  Thin crust made nice and crispy from the high temperature of the oven.  Nice tangy sauce.  Fresh mozzarella.  Sprinkle of fresh basil.  A splash of olive oil.  For toppings, I like spinach and sausage.  Great pizza...This location has a bar with a larger beer selection then the location on 2nd St.Wish they sold pizza by the slice.
2011-12-09,3,standard brick over fare. WARNING: watch your credit card.  I went there a year ago and my credit card disappeared. didn't notice until all kinds of charges started pooping up.  went there on 12/8 and my card didn't come back with my receipt to sign.
2011-12-07,4,Grimaldis is your basic, no nonsense NY area pizzeria.  The place looked small, but my daughter and I entered around Noon on a Sunday and there were plenty available tables.We got a small (6 slices) half pepperoni and half cheese pie.  It was GREAT!  The crust was just the right balance of doughy & crusty, the mozzarella was awesome and I LOVED the thick pepperoni that curls up around the edges.  My least favorite part of the pizza was the tomato sauce.  I normally get extra tomato sauce, but with this being my first time here, I decided not to - and Im glad I didnt.  The sauce was more on the sweet side and Id prefer if it were more on the savory side, but overall I liked the pizza and will definitely eat here again when were in the area!
2011-12-03,5,Best place to get pizza in this area.  Even when you take left overs home and warm it up the next day, it's STILL the best pizza out there.  Although the place is a little cramped, and sometimes there's a bit of a wait, it's just so worth it if you have a craving for a great brick oven pizza!
2011-11-25,4,Best pizza in Hoboken! Crispy thin brick oven pizza...can't beat it!
2011-11-08,5,One of my favorite Pizzeria to hit up!  I usually go to the one off Clinton St, but I tried this one off Washington Street.  Pretty much the same thing, except its more updated with the decor.  My girl and I ordered our usual.  I got my small pizza with fresh garlic and pepperoni and extra tomato sauce.  My girl got her personal pizza with fresh garlic and extra tomato sauce.  Raspberry Iced tea Snapple. and a glass of red wine.Once again, PERFECTION! I cant wait to go here again! and again, and again......
2011-10-25,5,After walking up and down this Hoboken strip surveying restaurants with ALL types of cuisines my cousin and I decided on Grimaldi's. Actually, I did...my cousin wasn't really "feeling pizza" that particularly COLD night but after some brief convincing, the idea of Italian didn't feel so bad. We waited FOREVER for a table. Okay, not forever...but it was a good 35 minutes. Fortunately for us we were cozy, seated inside at the bar being amused by the very friendly Irish bartender. "You sure you don't want a drink?" He was too cute. Old, but cute. Our hearts were set on not eating at the bar (which was an option) so we instead laughed at the bartender's nonsense, studied the menu and we were seated at a table in what eventually felt like no time! Immediately after being seated, we knew EXACTLY what we wanted. We played pretend for a little bit (for the waitresses sake) but then we ordered. Antipasto! Eggplant parmesano! Cheese brick oven pizza! GO GO GO! A girl's gotta eat! We were famished. The waitress did seem a little thrown off by how much food we were ordering but really? What? People in Jersey don't eat? ha. Antipasto was good. You know the deal- salami, cheese, roasted red pepper. Eggplant parmesano was delicious! Crispy, pan-fried (I think) to perfection, non-greasy, cheesy, saucy. You really can't go wrong. This was perhaps one of the best eggplant parmesano's I've had. Pizza- oh man, oh man. Grimaldi's brick ovens do wonders back there. In fact, you can see them in the back. Pizza was JUST right... cheesy, fresh, hot, a bit of a "brick-oven" taste on the crust. Oh, boy it was good. All of this food was so affordable upon seeing the check I immediately thought "Yeh, I'm not in Manhattan anymore." Food definitely tasted more expensive which is a GREAT thing. Located not too far from the PATH train (which I of course hopped on after dinner to get my butt back to NYC where I belong) it's a super convenient location for any folks arriving from NYC. I know there are some locations in NYC but blah! Give the Hoboken a try... you won't regret it! :)
2011-10-19,5,Excellent pizza.  I'm so glad we tried it.  We ordered a pizza medium pizza for 2 of us and added toppings to it.  The eggplant was breaded and was delicious as well as the garlic and mushrooms.  This is more of a thin crust/pan pizza than a deep dish.  The crust was crunchy and the toppings were hot.  It was perfect.  Definitely will be coming back as this is our go-to pizza place in hoboken.  I think we saw some ppl drinking sangria outside so they might serve this as well.
2011-10-08,5,This is pizza.Grimaldi's was teasing me during the hurricane. I wanted Grimaldi's so bad, but they were closed. This locations servers up nearly the same pizza as the Brooklyn location, but in a newer and less crowded space. The service could be slightly more attentive. We were looking for a server a bit longer than necessary.The bread or crust of the pizza has so much flavor, the toppings just make it better. The ingredients are top notch.When I picture of pizza, my mouth waters and I think of Grimaldi's.
2011-09-26,3,I'm a Grimaldi's fan, however, this location seems to make a thicker crust pizza which doesn't taste like the standard Grimaldi's.  The best Grimaldi's pizza I ever had was in Brooklyn, followed by the other Hoboken location.  That being said, this location's pizza is good, it's just not what you might be expecting when you think Grimaldi's.
2011-09-14,2,OK, let's be honest. The pizza is ok, not great. The sauce is very tasteless.  Next, it's a little pricey, considering you need toppings to add to get taste and the toppings cost $2.50-3 each, no reduction if for half pizza. Finally, this is the new hangout for moms and kids. They order a pizza, sit there for hours and talk. So if you want to have a pizza dinner for $40, and listen to Yuppie conversations and screaming children, this is the place for you. Best thing is this place has a bar, and I highly recommend having your pizza and beer there.
2011-09-08,4,3.5 Stars When we were planning our trip to NYC for the day. I said "hey, why don't we try Grimaldi's since they are so close to the city." So began the anticipation of a pie that I have heard so much about via the Food Network and other yelpers. We were pretty hungry by the time we arrived and were ready to feast. The hostess graciously seated us outside on what turned out to be a very nice night to eat outdoors. Our server, with her accent, was also friendly and promptly brought us our drinks and took our order. We figured we'd keep it standard so we ordered a regular pizza, no toppings. It was brought out piping hot. There's no doubt in my mind that all of the ingredients were fresh. The sauce was very good, not too sweet, just right. The cheese was also good, not too much, just the right amount. The crust, probably my favorite part, was thin, crunchy, yet chewy as well. Overall, the pie was very good. However, a little pricey for just a simple pizza (almost $15, without toppings). Service also started to dwindle as our meal came to an end. Our waitress, who kept passing by, was difficult to flag down for the check. We didn't mind too much since it was such a nice night. I must say, Grimaldi's was good, yet I was not blown away like how I thought I should be. Maybe, I need to try the Brooklyn location...
2011-09-06,5,We had a party of 11 and stopped in for pizza.  We made a great decision.  We ended up eating 5 pies.  Both the sausage and pepperoni were worth the trip.  The beer was nice and cold.
2011-08-30,5,Our office is right next door and every time we walk into work, the smell of wonderful oven baked pizza is absolutely mezmerizing. We order a big sicilian pie and the slices are plenty and the taste is delicious! It's also a great restaurant not just a pizza place so try everything else on the menu which is just as great.
2011-08-25,4,The outdoor seating makes this place. Of course, the pizza is delicious and the $3 beer specials make me very happy, but enjoying my slice al fresco on a perfect summer night took the cake.
2011-08-22,4,Excellent pizza by the pie, great bartender and $3 Yeunglings to wash it down.  Happy to have the second location on Washington.Toppings are expensive, but I look at going to Grimaldi's as going for a decent meal rather than just going out for pizza, so there's definitely a value if you consider it a treat.
2011-08-13,4,The pizza is very good and the crust is very well made.  We ordered a large pizza with sausage and spinach.  If you don't want any topping, the basic pizza is the margherita pizza (fresh mozzarella, tomato sauce, and basil), which looks pretty good. The only downside is the price... for a large pie with 2 toppings, it costs $25.  For what it is, I will definitely be coming back.
2011-07-11,4,The pizza here was really good, if you like thin crust pizza.  My friend and I (2 guys) got a small with sausage and black olives and it was more than enough.  There wasn't too much sauce so it didn't become soggy and it came out so hot that we initially used forks and knives to eat the pizza.  But really the best part of the place was the bartender named Emmett (sp?).  We sat at the bar and ate.  Emmett was such a nice guy, friendly, personable, and attentive.  All in all the staff there was all very friendly.  I would definitely go back again.
2011-07-01,4,Really tasty pizza!!! I will definitely be back. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price. One salad, moderate-to-well portioned, and personal (4 slice brick oven pizza) with two toppings, and one gingerale came out to 30 bucks with 15% tip.Luckily, we managed to be full, and it had to do with high fiber toppings like broccoli and spinach.But, the pizza is veryyyyyy delicious and I plan on being back and ordering a large pie, which may end up being around the same price as a personal with two toppings (don't ask).But, Grimaldi's is well-known, and well-deserved of that title for pizza.
