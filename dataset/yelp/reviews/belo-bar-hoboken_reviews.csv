2021-11-01,2,I previously came here a while ago and had drinks outside. I had a great time - this most recent time not so much.My boyfriend and I went last night for a late Halloween dinner. We were seated and greeted quickly. After reviewing the menu we placed our drink order. I ordered the special pumpkin cocktail and he had the abacado or avacadont After a little time our waiter told us the kitchen was closing soon and asked if we wanted to order food. I ordered the farfalle smoked salmon dish and my boyfriend had the chicken Milanese. We still didn't have our drinks yet25 minutes pass and we finally get our drinks and then a minute later our food comes. Not sure if they forgot about our drinks or if service was really that slow but it wasn't that busy. Drinks were good and strong. Both of our dishes were ok but nothing special. I'm bummed about our visit since last time we were here we had great service. With so many restaurant/bar options in Hobo I'd try another place before coming back here.
2021-10-02,4,Stopped here for a happy hour drink before dinner elsewhere; it was Friday night and they extended the happy hour pricing until 7pm (not sure if that's every Friday or if we just lucked out). For happy hour, they offer a few cocktails for $10 (the Moscow mule was great) and all drafts beers were $5. The bartender also made a delicious spicy watermelon mocktail for one of my friends, and she said it was the best mocktail she'd ever had!Drinks and vibe were good, but giving it 4 stars because the space by the bar is a little narrow making it difficult to stand without always being in the way of people trying to get to the back of the bar.
2021-09-05,1,Drinks were ok, watermelon salad was ok, fries were delicious, but when I got a few bites into the burger (which I ordered cooked medium), I realized I was eating raw ground beef.  See photo.
2021-08-04,5,Stumbled upon this adorable, intimate cocktail bar this past week and I'm so glad I did! By far, one of the best happy hours around. The drink selections are of high quality and the food is excellent! Far reached my expectations. Hidden little gem!!!
2021-08-02,5,Recently visited on a Saturday night. The bartender (Jessica) was both quick and very friendly suggesting specific cocktails which we both thoroughly enjoyed. I ordered the salmon farfalle pasta but with shrimp instead of salmon. It was delicious! I finished the entire dish and made my way over to my boyfriend "belo burger". I don't usually have high hopes for burgers at bars but this one was fantastic as well. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food considering it's a cocktail bar. Looking forward to visiting again soon.
2021-07-29,2,Well well ..so I read the reviews for this place and honestly some are scary , however I always like to take my own conclusions once I know it's hard to please everyone so I decided to give it a chance today ... and here's how it went smh !!!Let me star by saying the service in this place is by far the WORSE I ever had .. The bartender is more concentrated in chatting with this one guy than he is on actually serving drinks and talking to the other people at the bar . I originally had a reservation for 6:30 however I changed it online and decided to call in just to make sure everything was good and the girl who answered the phone around 1:30 pm was in a rush to get me off the phone ..( NOT SO PLEASANT ) Than we go in and ask for beer and it took at least 15-20 minutes to serve us a beer , NO the place was NOT that busy . Honestly every time we ordered something it took forever to be served and when I told the waiter he actually gave me an attitude saying there were other people to be served .. SERIOUSLY..there were 10 people in total in that place and that is counting the waiter and the bartender .. and I guarantee you not everyone ordered a drink at the same time . Sooo yeah THEIR SERVICE SUCKS!!!! The food .. the food we ordered was actually good even tho there was absolutely NO PRESENTATION.  We  had the Farfalle Salmon and the Atlantic Salmon .It isn't a very big place but it's kind of cozy if only the service was better . They also had live entertainment.. and someone playing piano , HOWEVER what piano player on earth doesn't know a Billy Joel or Elton John song ? Well this one didn't . Let me just leave this right here . The bathroom wasn't very appealing either .. not really very clean and for a place that wasn't that crowded , it should have been .If they could work on their CUSTOMER SERVICE .. it would be a decent place to go. But their workers need to loose the attitude and actually wake up because they are way to slow and unpleasant .
2021-07-18,2,I really loved the ambiance. Life music was nice. This is why I give those 2 starts.But everything else is below average. Service took forever. Portions were so small, I was surprised. Food tasted okay, not bad but not special.I had two different cocktails and they were sooo watery, not tasty and not what you expect from the description and pictures you see on yelp. The worst cocktails I've ever had in Hoboken!  I didn't even taste alcohol in them, just water with a light note of fruit and bunch of ice. So disappointed, waste of many & time.
2021-07-15,3,Nice atmosphere. Tried the Burrata and peach salad .. now mind you it's peach season and they chose to use canned peaches.. wtf ?! This is just plain lazy .. I feel like grilling the peaches would have been better. The dressing was minimal lack flavor! However I tried a friend purée black beans and just loved that !!! Hence three instead of two stars
2021-07-11,5,Belo is one of the best bars for a casual drink or a great cocktail in Hoboken. If you need a reprieve from the Irish pub scene this should be one of your first stops for sure. Snacks are good - drinks are better and service has been aces at all times. Unsure if they're still doing it but Wine Wednesdays is also a great night to get friends out for cheap.
2021-06-22,3,I cannot comment on the drinks because we came here only to eat, but overall, food was average. The trio tartare was kind of plain and without much flavor, the salad was good and pasta had nothing spectacular about it. Not sure if we will be back. The service was good, however, the music was extremely loud.
2021-06-05,1,Waited for more than 45 minutes to get the order and by then the customers who came after us got the order first and for our order we had to go to bat and get it ourselves
2021-06-05,1,Had the worst experience with the server. I ordered gin and tonic and he got me vodka tonic. I told him its not gin. He tasted from my drink and said it is gin p pop and kind of asked me to try from same glass. Then when one of other servers told him its not gin and he changed the order. Not only this whatever we ordered on the table was pretty average but one drink was really bad and I asked him if we can do something about it. He was like I'll charge you if I change something. I would never recommend to go to place with such service.
2021-06-02,5,Stopped by Belo to grab a few drinks, which were all spot on. Phenomenal cocktails and fairly good beer selection for a higher-end type bar. Ordered the Farfale smoked salmon pasta, which was one if the tastier dishes I've ever ordered in a while. Staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and happy to engage in conversation. A gem for a bit of a more mature Hoboken scene.
2021-05-28,5,Best bar ever ! After being racial profiles by mad butter we decided to come to Belo bar and Sarah the bartender treated us like family forever redeem our experience out here so grateful for her and the drinks were so good and the bar closed so late and let's us Dane and listen to the music we like everything was days and easy do grateful to here as restaurant owners we definitely approve
2021-05-16,3,Loved the cantaloupe infused Penelope bourbon - a must try! Blood on the leaves was little diluted but tasted alright.3 star rating because of the artichoke Kale dip. The Kale tasted very raw and the cheese garnish was disoriented from the entire dish. I still love this place because of the cheese balls & their ambiance. They had live music and proper social distancing in such a small place.
2021-05-14,3,Music was way too loud, crowd was way too rowdy (for a date night, maybe good for college kids), food was pretty mediocre.
2021-05-11,1,Service was awful, we had a reservation but end up waiting 63 minutes to get sited. The food was normal, nothing that I would say wow, drinks were average. I won't recommend this bar.
2021-05-06,5,This place is cute and the service is top notch Service provided by Grant and company and I will definitely return ! Grant hooked me up with a nice Gold RushLook how cute their presentation was! Love the vibes
2021-05-05,5,If you're looking for a quaint, unique bar with excellent food & drinks in Hoboken, this is your spot! The atmosphere is perfect for a date night or drinks with coworkers. They offer indoor as well as outdoor seating. They offer a really great list of unique cocktails, my favorite was definitely the hibiscus Margarita! If you're looking for some good appetizers, the burratosa was super fresh & plated to perfection. If you happen to catch the happy hour specials, the Mac and cheese balls were also great! In terms of entrees, the steak & frites was super tender and cooked perfectly. I also recommend the Cacio e Pepe. The spaghetti was cooked just right and the consistency of the dish was excellent (Some places it tends to be dry), this was definitely not! Be sure to save some room for dessert, they offer seasonal/daily flavors of gelato & sorbet along with some amazing tiramisu and chocolate lava cake. Definitely a spot I look forward to going back to!
2021-05-01,3,Burger was good, fries stellar, even with delivery, which is a feat. The Italian food was mediocre.
2021-04-24,4,I ordered the chicken & portobello and burrata with prosciutto via DoorDash. The description said it came with baked potato but when I got it it was actually a side of home fries/roasted potatoes so I was a bit disappointed. The chicken itself was tasty, didn't notice the truffle oil but the mushrooms were good & the sauce pretty delish. Burrata was standard, can't really mess that up, but the next day I made avocado toast & topped it with a bit of the burrata & prosciutto and that tasted great lol.
2021-04-22,4,Awesome service and such a cozy place to have a quiet dinner. Giving it a 4 cause the food was a tad bit salty and the gin drink wasn't the tastiest cocktail I've had. But I'll go there again to give them another try!
2021-04-18,5,Everything about this place is 5 stars! The hospitality, the service, the food! Malik was the best server!! He was so personable, funny, and made great recommendations. Can't wait to go back.
2021-04-15,5,Such a cute cute place! There's also a great outdoor space. We were seated right away on Sunday afternoon. We ate outside with our puppy and the waiter was so nice and brought out water for him. The hibiscus margarita was so good- highly recommend it! We split the burger and some fries. Everything was so perfect! Will def be back to try more food and drinks!!
2021-04-11,3,I had to pick a spot last minute for one of my girlfriends and I to get dinner. I called in and they were able to book me for a 7:30pm reservation. When we arrived I found parking nearby on the street. The place is small but they were able to keep it socially distant with indoor and outdoor seating. We were greeted by Z and he was doing the hosting and waiter. He was really nice but he wasn't very present. For drinks I ordered a glass of wine and my friend ordered a strawberry martini. The drinks took a long time before we got them. It was now time to order our entrées and I ordered the linguini and meatballs and my friend ordered a shrimp salad and shrimp pasta. I tasted the shrimp salad and it was delicious. My entrée was just ok tasting and so was my friend's. It could of been seasoned a little more. We wanted to order more drinks and I had to search for Z several times. Another server Ray came over and saved the day. We ordered more drinks and of course it still took forever but Ray was on it. We asked for the bill and it came to a little over $100. All in all we had just an ok experience.
2021-04-07,5,Came here on a first date, the pressure was on me i was nervous af lol but when I say our entire experience was excellent. I mainly choose the restaurant because it has rave reviews about the drinks and they did not disappoint, I'm a big fan of unique menus with items with original names. The drink menu was just that all different and interesting names that not only made u want to read what was in the the drink but makes u want to try it! My personal favorite was the "where's amine" (I think that was it". Amine was the name of the manager there and he helped a lot, I don't think he knew when i was there but I had called a few weeks prior to make the reservation and his confidence that Belo bar was a great place for a first date was everything!! The staff was very attentive to all our needs and answered all our questions super enthusiastically! I'm not a writer clearly but the last thing I say is the FOOD WAS INCREDIBLE both of us had pasta. She had one with salmon which was delicious and I had the one with meat sauce and the were delicious!!Experience 10/10 would go back and recommend
2021-04-06,4,Made a reservation for drinks with some friends. Surprisingly, for a weeknight, the place was completely booked up! The decor and music were on point, and the cocktails were so unique. Taking one star off because the waiter forgot to place our drink order in initially so we waited an extra 20 minutes, but all of the drinks we tried were fantastic - you can't go wrong!
2021-04-04,5,This is long overdue but this little place is a fantastic date spot. I went there on Valentine's Day and the prefixed menu was well planned and the food was great. The signature cocktails they have there aren't anything too special but they taste good. The ambiance really highlights an intimate setting and it's ideal for 2-4 people (not big enough for more). Nice subtle lighting but not too dark so that basics don't have to use flash when taking pictures of their food. All in all I'll consider coming back for a small dinner for 2 especially if it's date night.
2021-03-27,4,Love the ambience. One of the best happy hours in Hoboken! Great drinks and appetizers.
2021-03-22,5,This place has become my go to!!! I've been here a few times now and it has never disappointed me. Both dinner & brunch food has been great, and the drinks have been so good too! 10/10 recommend.
2021-03-18,4,I'm so happy I found this place during COVID-19 they play some great music. (Kudos to whoever made that playlist) The vibe inside is great and the service is very attentive and upbeat. To top it all off the cacio e Pepe pasta with shrimp was delicious and cooked very well. They didn't overdo it on the cheese and the portions were really good! Definitely would recommend this place and I am planning to continue coming here! :)
2021-03-15,3,Drinks were good but not particularly strong. The Gintrification was very tasty and sweet. Service was pretty slow. We ordered 3 appetizers to split 1) Oysters- good, pretty large oysters.2) Burrata and Prosciutto- good size, tasty burrata and good proscuitto. 3) Tuna/Salmon Tartare- this was bad. The fish did not taste fresh and was fishy. Avocado was good but fish ruined the dish. Buggest takeaway was to come for drinks but not food.
2021-03-10,3,The Nunya Business cocktail I had was incredibly one note - very sour and not much else. It had a lavender foam which was cool, but the drink itself was really odd tasting and I didn't get any hibiscus at all - it was really just lemon juice, some gin, and the ghost of lavender's past. My dinner partner got the Social Dilemma and said it was fine, nothing special or noteworthy about it.The Trio Tartare (salmon, tuna, guacamole) appetizer was good, though! Credit where credit is due. Well flavored, though I don't know if I'd necessarily count guacamole as a tartare (lol)...my recommendation would be bump up the price 2-4 dollars, add an actual 3rd tartare and serve the guacamole on the side as a surprise "for any extra bread/chips you may have!!!" kind of thing. That way you're filling the 'trio tartare' title, and people are getting a bit of what they perceive as 'extra' (the guacamole), which will make them super happy.Will come back here a next time to give it another try (maybe it was an off night!) and if the food and drinks necessitate it, I will update my review!
2021-03-09,5,Amazing decor with a very elegant but quaint feeling.  This is the perfect place to bring a date or just go for a quiet and nice evening with a close friend.  There are a ton of great food options but the Cacio e pepe was amazing and it was my first time having this type of dish so I'm excited to try it at more places too!
2021-03-08,2,Cocktails are very mediocre, especially for the price. Overall, I felt the vibe here was very strange. They were playing a very sexually charged, unedited Akon song pretty loudly at around 6:30 PM when those around us were having dinner. The music paired with the clubby bar lighting made me feel more like I was at Madd Hatter than at a place that refers to themselves as a restaurant, and the best kept secret in Hoboken. My advice: Play more appropriate music early in the evening and remove the tacky, multi-colored strip lighting from the bar so patrons will feel that this is actually an upscale restaurant and cocktail bar like it appears to be online.
2021-03-01,5,What a hidden gem! Came in for happy hour (it's everyday!) and had some great wine and tasty starters that go until 7pm! If you are a fan of cocktails, this is your spot. Greatly curated cocktails with a bunch of cool combinations! Very good entrees as well - I had the branzino with walnut and balsamic glaze that although a surprising combo, it really was nice! Give this spot a visit for a refreshing cocktail and great vibes!
2021-02-27,5,Delicious drinks, and the food was great too. I would definitely love to come back and try some more menu items
2021-02-27,5,Found Belo Bar on Yelp, and so impressed by the service and food. By far the best cocktails in Hoboken, and the service was exceptional. If you're an espresso martini fan look not further even though they're not on the menu you can still order one. I'll definitely be back soon!
2021-02-24,5,So far I've been here twice and the cocktails never disappoint. The service is also great. The bartenders really take their time making each drink to perfection. The music is also good which is a plus. I'll definitely be back.
2021-02-18,5,I rarely use YELP, however, I needed to leave a review for this place. Absolutely amazing service. Each and every employee greeted you with a smile and made you feel like you were a priority. So well mannered, very professional. I had an amazing experience on Valentine's Day, which tends to be a busy time for restaurants. They still exceeded my expectations on the busiest day of the year. Food was amazing, place was very clean. Environment was relaxing. I would highly recommend it. It is right off the path in Hoboken.
2021-02-16,5,One of my favorite spots in Hoboken! The staff is really friendly and everything is nicely spaced apart. Everything on the menu is very yummy!  Some unique drinks and food is fantastic. Great spot for brunch
2021-02-15,5,Great place for cocktails! We also had the Burrata and Prosciutto appetizer. Cool ambiance. My friends and I had a good experience.
2021-02-06,5,Went to Belo Bar for the first time for a girls night, and we all loved it! The cocktails were amazing, food was very good, staff was friendly and attentive. Great vibe, good music - perfect date night spot or casual dinner/drinks with friends. They also followed covid protocol very well - tables were spaced out, plexi glass around each table, hand sanitizers, QR code menus. Will definitely be back!!
2021-01-24,2,Yikes. I do truly feel bad rating this hole in the wall bar turned "restaurant" so low, and that's because of the service. It's actually quite good. Waiters wore their masks and the bartender gave us free shots and made us great drinks. This place IS actually good for its cocktails. Bartender also delighted with Future Husband over sports items and I smiled and nodded along as if I knew what they were talking about. But the food? Yikes. I really do wish my fellow Yelpers would step up and be honest here. This is not quality food. It is food trying to front as quality food. In what world did I think Branzino covered with caramelized onions, spinach, walnuts, and a balsamic glaze, would be decent from a hole in the wall bar? I couldn't eat the fish.Also who serves branzino skin side up when the skin isn't even crispy? Seriously inedible. At least the avocado on the fish tartare plate was green. It was also in a pretty shape! So one star for that. The salmon tartare didn't taste as fresh and flavorful as the tuna tartare but honestly both weren't GREAT. At least try to redeem yourself by bringing bread and butter out to the tables? Idk man. Also the hand sanitizer dispenser at the front door is broken, and that's the most important one.
2021-01-03,4,Was exited to visit Belo Bar this past New Year's eve since they're menu looks delish and I liked the look and vibe. When we arrived (of course with a reservation) we were surprised with a prix fixe menu. $55 for an appetizer, entree, dessert and glass of champagne. It was very limited and slightly disappointing. *No where on their website, or when we made the reservation did it mention anything about a different menu.* There wasn't even steak on the menu! The food ended up being great anyway and I really loved the interior of the spot. Also, looking around you could hear others saying they didn't know about the prix fixe - so sounds like we weren't the only ones that were surprised.
2021-01-02,5,Cozy and delicious spot tucked in almost didn't see it! Great and creative craft cocktail collection, decor with great character and the service is helpful and caring. I got a nunya business and a tiramisu.
2020-11-16,4,I recently returned to Belo Bar, now that they had become more established and had a passionate following, in order to reassess my earlier review from when they had first opened.  We grabbed a table outside next to a heat lamp and ordered some drinks.  While the cocktails sounded very interesting, I boringly wound up sticking with my usual Aperol Spritz, of which they made a well-blended one.  When we moved onto our second round of beverages, we decided that it would be best to also order a light amount of food to balance the alcohol and hold us over until dinner.  We were impressed with their expanded menu, but wound up just trying the Roasted Potatoes side dish.  The skin-on potato chunks had been lightly dusted with salt and mild seasoning for just the right hint of flavor.  They had also been ideally cooked, with a crispy exterior and soft interior.  In fact, the potatoes were so tasty that we ordered a second plate of them!Belo Bar offered a congenial atmosphere, great service, and delicious food.
2020-11-10,4,Chill bar with tasty drinks, nice ambiance and friendly staff. One less star because the food was a little ehhh, bland- but definitely go for the drinks, they are really good!
2020-11-03,5,I had a chill date here on Halloween because they had a well priced 3 course special. 1000% worth the money and the experience. The staff was very nice and accommodating. Just wish they had more specialty cocktails made with whiskey/bourbon. The atmosphere seemed like a place where lots of old friends got together. Would DEFINITELY return!
2020-11-03,5,Belo Bar is my favorite bar in Hoboken. HANDS DOWN.The owners are super welcoming, attentive, and connect with all of their customers.  The service is wonderful, and the bartenders are absolute ROCKSTARS! The craft cocktail menu is super diverse, with drinks to please everyone.  A couple of my favorite cocktails on the current menu are the "How Dare You" and the "Is Amine Here".  I also ALWAYS order whiskey sours here as well, because they are the best I have ever had.  The presentation and taste of the cocktails are always on point.I'm working my way through the menu, but some of my favorite items are the Belo Burger, the shrimp and chicken salad, the Burrata, and the mushroom soup.  Food comes out fast, hot, and everything I've had so far is delish!!!
2020-11-03,5,I'm so happy I've come to know the Belo owners & their staff! The environment is great especially when you're trying to avoid to "BroBoken" spots. The Cocktails are unique & delicious (all made with fresh ingredients). Highly recommend for a 1st or 100th date night spot!
2020-11-02,1,Some of the worst COVID practice I've seen in Hoboken. One waiter wearing a useless shield instead of a mask, another came outside holding our drinks with her mask under her chin. We asked for the check once we saw something floating in my girlfriend's wine and then noticed smear marks (lipstick maybe?) on the rim of the wine glass. Not to mention there were WAY too many people inside, no chance it was 25% of capacity.
2020-10-22,4,food was good, had the salmon. was sad it didnt really come with anything. got the burrata app and spinach artichoke dip, tasty! a lot of the specialty beers were out but their menu did not reflect that. every time we asked for one, the waitress would come back with bad news. for four people with four entrees and two apps it was around $160 total. we also had at least 7 or 8 drinks too. not bad. probably wouldnt go back unless it was happy hour
2020-10-18,5,Great spot to grab some beers and catch the game. Brunch and dinner menu is great to pick off. Friendly atmosphere and amazing staff! Will be back for sure.
2020-09-18,5,The food here was outstanding and so were the cocktails. I had this insane cocktail made with mezcal and carrot juice .. we tried about 4 others, too. We ordered the artichoke dip, burrata and proscuitto & cacio e Pepe. I was so so pleasantly surprised. The interior is really cute, they had live music.. definitely will be a good fall hangout. The owner was so kind as well.
2020-08-29,3,Lucky to find a restaurant with available outdoor seating in Hoboken on a Saturday night.  The food was decent.  Service was friendly and prompt but masks were either missing or below the waiters' necks.  It appears that the owner or manager was smoking and talking to patrons in front of the restaurant. This is outdoor seating, you can smell smoke while eating. Wish restaurants would take Covid-19 seriously.
2020-08-18,5,I love this spot! Some of the best cocktails in Hoboken. Great vibes and music and the owners/staff are wonderful. One of the few bars in Hoboken that serve quality cocktails.
2020-08-05,5,It was an amazing night with my kids, enjoyed being out and the service was great! I'll definitely be back, loved the shrimp!
2020-07-26,5,Great neighborhood restaurant / bar.Friendly easy going staff.Menu is wonderful and food is equally wonderful.Will be back many more times.
2020-07-26,5,Stumbled in here today (July 25) with my daughter. They had outdoor seating (perfect for covid), nice shade, and a good breeze. It wasn't super crowded, which was nice considering we're social distancing. Ended up sitting there and eating and chatting with my 8 year old for two hours. It was chill. The service was great. Our server, Z was awesome (and handsome). I had sliders and nachos/mango salsa and they were great! Definitely recommend. Went on a Sunday evening around 5pm if that matters.
2020-07-25,1,I was wondering where should I start for bar hopping but after entering Belo Bar I ended up getting drunk. During happy hour over the weekend I had one of their cocktail name "manhattan" andit was perfect. The service is super fast and vibes are pretty happening. A must try bar especially for one who are looking for happy hours during the weekend Happy Drinking!! Update:The "manhattan" drink wasn't same and service was pretty lame. Literally taking order and getting drink took 30 minutes. So I went inside to pay the check as I needed to get out of that place ASAP. He started winning that why are you here go back to table. Who talks like that?
2020-07-05,5,This used to be a dive Irish bar- just realized it's a new spot.  Dig the cocktails and wine selection, so far so good.  I only just found this place during covid but I haven't tried the food yet. Nice staff and good prices and very hospitable.
2020-07-03,5,Came here for the first time last night with 3 friends and loved it!The food was delicious - I'm a huge fan of small plates and everything was really shareable. Highly recommend the mango salsa. The Sahara cocktail is also excellent - very refreshing. The staff, though, is really what took this place to the next level. Everyone was so kind and accommodating. Our table was around the corner, out of view of the main entrance, but we never felt forgotten about. We had a puppy with us and the staff was very friendly, bringing him water and making sure he was comfortable. You can tell that there is a sense of community and caring at this restaurant.Will absolutely be back for more!
2020-07-03,5,A group of 4 of us tried this place last night knowing they were new to the area. Can't say enough how great it was! Menu was the perfect amount of choices, and we loved everything we got, we ordered most of the small plates and loved the dips, salsa and the slides and tacos. Drinks were fantastic, I loved the Fridas Brow because mezcal is a fav of mine.Service is what knocked it out of the park, we brought our dog and they were so great constantly getting him water, and stopping by to see if we needed anything, and the place was packed! Highly recommend giving it a try, we hope to be regulars here!
2020-07-02,5,Great atmosphere, great people, great time. If you're in Hoboken- it's a must to come by for after dinner drinks or to start the night off to a great time!
2020-06-28,3,The drinks were $12,$14 each. There are many places to drink in Hoboken but I wasn't particularly impressed by the drinks. They tasted a little weak compared to normal margarita that I have had. Maybe it's a little different during the pandemic.
2020-06-21,5,Love this place!  Drinks are so good and the staff is so friendly they make you feel right at home.  You got to have the fish tacos and the burrata salad.  This is the place Hoboken has been missing
2020-05-05,5,It was the first nice day of the season and I decided to go for a run. On my run I passed Belo Bar who was selling wine and my 5 mile run quickly turned into a 1 mile run. They had a nice variety of wine and IPAs. The owner was super nice and helped me pick out which bottles to buy. Since we are in the middle of a pandemic I need to point out how CLEAN they were. She even wiped down my bottles before giving me them. Now, today is cinco de mayo. No one loves a good taco and beer more than ya girl. I decided to go with belo bar as they were doing a special for tacos and beer. My roommate and I ordered the mango shrimp and spicy chicken tacos....wow! Full of flavor and good stuff. Will definitely be back here.
2020-05-01,2,Wanted so bad to like it. The steak panini was steak ums with marinara sauce and American cheese. It's supposed to be roasted red peppers and provolone. We didn't order it this way and it was disgusting. The chicken in the spicy chicken tacos was very overcooked and the meatballs are basically in ketchup.  The food was delivered upside down Don't think we will be ordering again.
2020-04-26,5,Ordered takeout from here mid quarantine and the staff is fantastic, food was great and price was reasonable. We had the tuna heart of palm cakes which I loved and so did my boyfriend who usually hates that type of thing. The tuna salad and quesadilla were also amazing. Looking forward to coming here in person once they are allowed to open back up!
2020-04-25,5,One of my new favorite places in Hoboken. The bronzino was well seasoned and I loved the large portion of sautéed spinach. Can't wait to try more from the menu.
2020-03-23,5,great drinks and vibe. They just added a whole new speciality drink menu last week as well. must try!
2020-03-08,5,Every other spot that I've been to, you order a whiskey sour, you get a side of immediate heart burn. The fact that this spot puts egg whites in their sours is amazing. They explain the perfection behind the beauty of these awesome cocktails and the bartender explained the history of why sours should incorporate egg whites into them.This place had such a great vibe, and was an awesome experience overall. HIGHLY recommend
2020-03-04,4,Great vibe, great food, and great cocktails. The host for the restaurant part was our waiter too so when it got busy he couldn't come around as much but otherwise great service. Would reccomend the mac n cheese, though the tacos were great too
2020-02-29,5,The bar downtown Hoboken has been missing out on has finally come to life! Absolutely love coming here. From the minute I walk in it feels like home. The owners and staff are warm and welcoming, drinks are on point (love those jalapeño ones), great vibe and all around awesome place. Love the dim lighting, live music nights, and it also doesn't suck they offer HH every day. Great addition to the area and one I'll keep coming back to!
2020-02-28,1,I think this bar is helpful for the college bar feel in downtown Hoboken. However,  they try to get away with a lot - it's amateur. You can't take yourselves seriously when all you've done is slap some new paint on the wall and call it a cocktail bar..it's gross trickery to have people think that. Don't lie to people when your staff and owner are clearly not speakeasy oriented and your staff can't make cocktails. Happy hour is cool, aside from that they're crooks.
2020-02-28,5,Much needed vibe in HNKN!!! Great live music and craft cocktails (try Peep Show).will be back!!!
2020-02-28,3,Took 20 minutes to get a drink, 5 more minutes to close out my tab. Food came relatively quickly but the Mac and cheese was bland and the shrimp tacos were so-so. Guacamole serving was a bit small as well. The sliders were good. Nice atmosphere and live music but probably wouldn't come back unless someone else planned something here.
2020-02-26,5,Belo Bar is the kind of spot where you can stop in for a cocktail, bring friends for a night out, first date or date night with your significant other. Nice mixed crowd of young and older (not too old) The owners are friendly and welcoming. The staff is attentive and make a good cocktail. The layout is chill, dim, and laidback with a touch of class. There seems to be musical entertainment each night otherwise music is always going. A bonus if you're a musician or singer there is an open mic night and if you are an artist they've displayed art done by the locals. Check this place out!
2020-02-22,3,Came here on a Thursday and it was moderately empty. There was live music but it was just too loud for the size of the crowd at that time. My friend and I got a table placed underneath a speaker and I at one point asked if we could do something about it because it was just too loud. Between not being able to hear my friend across the small table, my head was throbbing. Although the music and singer was absolutely lovely...note to self, it wasn't quite the right setting for two friends to catch up if they can't hear each other. Happy hour drink deals are great, service is great...unfortunately the food is not that great.
2020-02-22,2,The food here could use some rethinking. The pasta was bland and tasteless. The sliders were mediocre. In a town where the food selection and quality is stepping up (finally!), this place could put more effort into its menu.
2020-02-15,5,Nice, inviting and warm environment & eloquently rustic. Big welcome as soon as we walked in the door. Happy Hour is EVERYDAY including weekends! Can't beat that. Cute string lights, open mic on Mondays I believe. Food was plated well and thoughtfully served. Drinks always stayed full. Will definitely be coming back!
2020-02-13,5,Live music, good cocktails. If this is something you enjoy then vote with your wallet.
2020-02-09,5,A refreshing change from the ubiquitous, bro-laden sports bars that Hoboken is brimming with. The new owners are friendly and care about their business and guests. I wish them the best of luck and will be coming back to try more of their (very fairly priced) cocktails.
2020-02-03,2,Extremely disappointed. The food sucks, and is way overpriced for what they have to offer.
2020-01-24,5,Very cool spot with great drinks and solid food for a condensed menu. Definitely a fun and welcome addition to the Hoboken area. They had live music on Friday night; the band was was entertaining and played a good variety of songs but was mostly classic rock/oldies which seemed appropriate for the atmosphere. May be different music genre on other nightsOverall a very pleasant experience and look forward to coming back
2020-01-24,5,This place is so amazing. Low key , incredible live music, cocktails, and service. Food was great too . They are expanding the menu.  5/5!
2020-01-22,5,This place is really nice, great atmosphere, very good food!!!Definitely I'll be back with my friends
2020-01-09,5,Belo Bar is the spot Hoboken has been desperately in need of. It's dim lighting, creative cocktail menu and delicious food options (all reasonably priced) make it the perfect date night spot, casual spot, night cap or pit stop on a walk home from work.We've been here a couple times since it's opened and have tried almost all the food menu items... all of which have been cooked and seasoned to perfection. If you're in search of a hearty meal, you can't go wrong with the steak panini and Mac&cheese small plate. For lighter options, the tuna or shrimp tacos are both out of this world to be quite frank.On to the cocktails, my personal favorite is the Sax & Violin (mezcal, pineapple juice, lime & agave) or the Old Gold (bourbon, bitters & brown sugar), but you're can't go wrong with either. They're NYC quality, but better, and reasonably priced. Aside from the perfected menu, the owner, Amin, is passionate and personable... along with the rest of his staff. From the first day he walked in, he was eager to learn our names and more about us. After only a couple visits, we feel as if we've been friends for months.Personally, between the vibe, the cocktails, the food, the knowledgeable staff, and the talented entertainment, it will be hard to step back into other places after discovering this gem.I was hesitant to write this review because I selfishly want this place to stay under the radar, but it more than deserves the acknowledgment... they have perfected everything to a T.Thank you, Amin & Staff for opening up the bar Hoboken was missing and desperately needed!
2020-01-06,5,By far my favorite bar in Hoboken. It's spacious yet cozy. The owners and staff are amazing, attentive and so welcoming. The drinks are delicious and made with love. Haven't tried the food yet but can't wait to go back to do so.
2020-01-06,5,I have lived in Hoboken for 5 years and Belo Bar is what has been missing from downtown Hoboken. The crowd is lively and the atmosphere is very inviting. I had the best old fashioned I have ever had here! There was a DJ when I was there playing great music but there is also a piano for live music. It was such a fun night! I can't wait to go back and try the food. Highly recommended.
2020-01-04,5,I've lived in Hoboken for many years and never found any bar I enjoyed until I came to Belo Bar. It is one of a kind here in Hoboken. All the bars in Hoboken are sports bar and so when belo bar opened it was actually a different bar with great people, live music, and just fun. It's even great just to chill at. I so highly recommend it.
2020-01-02,5,I love this place so much!!! Great people, wonderful food and amazing bartenders. I went there so many times always great and friendly service. If you like a wine that's definitely place for you. They have a million of them. Huge recommendations!!!!
2020-01-02,5,What an excellent spot to welcome to downtown Hoboken. The vibe inside is super inviting and aesthetically pleasing. It's set up to be a great date spot, casual drinks with friends spot, or even a bit of a tie-one-on type of spot. (They even FINALLY fixed the bathroom upstairs that used to give everybody real nightmares)The staff was comfortable and made everybody there feel like friends, even if they were strangers when they walked in. We had a great time with everybody. The new owners are super nice but also very professional, which looks like they're there for all the right reasons. Food and drinks both were awesome, creative and classic. Looks like it's shaping up to be a well needed change of pace to the usual insanity of those downtown/path bars where somehow beer spills on your shoes before you even walk in. Can't wait to support this place as best we can!
2019-12-31,5,hidden gem. wow.delectable drinks.alluring atmosphere.vivacious vibe.eclectic eats.
2019-12-21,5,This place is great. It's a really classy joint that makes you feel like a regular in Hoboken. It has a nice long bar with excellent tunes. You're gunna enjoy if.
2019-12-19,5,Great new bar and tapas place. Menu isn't extensive but food is amazing. Cocktails are great and beer selection is fine; they even have Prosecco on tap! Owners are super friendly and chill. Very casual and cozy with great music. Highly recommended!
2019-12-17,5,Soooo happy this opened!!! Best spot in Hoboken- cute and cozy. Drinks are really good and we had apps and they were delicious too! Definitely coming back here. New gem in Hoboken!
2019-12-14,5,What a great bar. From the atmosphere to the small plates couldn't have had a better night out. Met the owners super cool down to earth people. Would definitely recommend to all.
2019-12-13,5,Best new bar in Hoboken! Great food and even better service. Also a really nice wine selection.
2019-12-13,5,Hoboken's new hot spot! Family owned gem near the path. Great food and service. Excited for what's to come!
2019-12-13,5,Wow!  Talk about a total transformation.  This place is incredible - staff is so friendly and it makes you feel at home.  They brought in a chef who knows what he is doing, the menu is great!  This place is perfect for a date night, as well as a night out with your group of friends!  5 stars to Hoboken's newest & classiest establishment!
