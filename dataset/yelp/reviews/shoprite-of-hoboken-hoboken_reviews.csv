2021-05-01,3,Okay. Have good prices and wide selection, but the staff and managers become very obnoxious and unprofessional close to closing time, like they will turn to stone if everyone isn't out by 10 sharp (the hours on yelp and google are WRONG). It's off putting. During the day it can be crowded and they never don't have large crates and things blocking the aisles. Haven't had big problems with customer service.
2021-02-06,1,I've shopped here for a decade and it has gone down hill slowly over the past year to finally hit rock bottom and I will NEVER go back. They have probably half of the employees in there that they had years ago, the store is a WRECK. The people ahead of me in SELF check out had water all over the belt and used their own paper towels to clean it. Like, what the heck is this? They had one woman manning the fifteen self check outs (YEAH RIGHT) I left my reusable bags in the car (ok my fault) and bought four paper bags. The paper bags were literally see though and wouldn't hold more than a couple items before ripping. WHY BOTHER selling a prodding that is useless? The old brown bags were fine, but again, cutting costs so corporate can make more money, screw the customer. My shopping cart wheels locked in the parking lot and there was literally NO ONE working outside to help me. I left my full cart by the entrance while walking to the car end of the lot to get my car and hope nobody took my bags. It's embarrassing that we are taken for jerks. Like you just throw the food on the floor and laugh as we scramble to pick up the garbage you're offering us. I am never going back to this store. Never ever again.
2021-01-29,5,Hoboken Shop Rite is excellent supermarket shopping.    It's consistently well stocked, even popular on-sale items.   The staff is efficient and helpful--from the top to the bottom.  I had a difficult time setting up an on-line shopping & delivery account recently (the corporate website is not particularly user-friendly,)  but the Hoboken staff patiently helped me in the middle of a very busy day.  The store is clean, well lit and easy to navigate.   The produce, meat, and dairy department products are generally fresh & bountiful, and the organic & specialty selections are expanding all the time. I do regret the reduction of cashiers and the expansion of self check out, and hope that doesn't continueAnd last but the least,  the prices and sales are great.    Thanks.  Sheilah Scully
2020-12-19,4,This Shoprite is pretty good, VERY busy on Sunday! I ordered a birthday cake and it was excellent. They usually don't run out of stock if they can help it. They have self check out which is good for most. I walk here from JC heights so, its exercise for me also.
2020-07-06,1,Hoboken Shop Rite is doing its part in helping spread the virus. While other grocers are enforcing mask rules and distancing (Trader Joes) Shop Rite lets employees flout the rules.  I've seen employees, especially stocking clerks, with masks around their neck and brushing within a foot of shoppers - not caring at all.  Shameful!
2020-05-17,1,Nothing like using a pandemic to A) have ur employees treat customers like sh*tB) price gougeC) waste people's time with their garbage online delivery lie, sorry i mean service D) offer cheaper products at the same price as the previous higher quality products E) bring back plastic bags and kill nature
2020-05-11,3,I used to frequent this location more often when my hubs lived in the heights, but haven't been back in years.The ShopRite in JC can get super overcrowded, and the Acme can be really understocked. I needed to do a really big food shop, and figured it was worth a shot to stop in. They have a very large parking lot which is always a plus. The market isn't too crowded to begin with, so there wasn't much of a need to worry about crowd control. It is far less crowded than the ShopRite in JC.Unfortunately parking and less crowds are just about the only redeeming qualities. The main two reasons for my shop were to pick up meat and produce. Both of these departments were incredibly understocked and lackluster. The produce department was so picked over with barely any selection. And a lot of produce that looked okay in the packaging is now rotted two days later including strawberries, cucumbers and pineapple.Meat wasn't as picked over, but the selection just isn't the same as the ShopRite in JC. There is also a two product minimum on chicken (totally understandable) but no sign up near the chicken. I wish that there was a sign, and if I had known before check-out I would have course corrected and picked up other items in place.Because of the plastic bag ban, bags are an extra ten cents. Also totally understandable, and this is the case at every other supermarket in Hoboken and JC. However, at all other supermarkets you are given a thick and sturdy reusable plastic bag. They gave us teeny tiny paper bags that were barely able to hold any groceries, and most ripped on the car ride home.Unfortunately I won't be returning to this location again.
2020-04-25,5,I just want to say THANK YOU to the incredible, kind caring and hard working employees at ShopRite. Kevin the Assistant Grocery Manager goes above and beyond for his customers making us aware of product availabilty. I know it is a very challenging time, especially for the employees and the countless times a customer asks while looking at the empty shelves if they have any stock of whatever item we are in search of... Kevin went above and beyond checking stock in the back as a truck was coming in to see if the cleaning item I was looking for was avaialble.  I appreciated the positive energy. Kevin is an excellent example of what customer service and kindness really are, especially in such difficult and stressful times. Be safe everyone
2020-03-30,1,CORONAVIRUS BAKERY ALERT  I was at the bakery department today during Senior Hour. The workers were wrapping all the fresh bakery items. They had gloves on but no masks. They work talking and laughing over the food. Rubbing their eyes and touching their faces. HORRIFYINGLY DANGEROUSNESS!
2020-02-11,1,I come into this shoprite often, as I work in the area.  They have a variety of organic products which I like since I'm trying to eat healthier. One of those products being an organic milk that is bottled in glass containers. I love this milk as its all natural and even though the bottles are hard to carry around, it is a great product.  The milk goes by the name of Oberweis.  When You purchase this milk since  It's bottled in a glass container, You get a $2 deposit when you bring back the empty bottle to the store. I have spoken with the  general manager for shoprite and the owner of the mill company just to make sure that yes you can bring back the empty glass bottles and get $2 off your next bottle that you buy. It's like a deposit that you have on the milk which is great because the milk normally goes about 699 per half a gallon of milk. Every time I bring the milk to the cashiers at night, there is a problem. The cashiers are not informed that there  Is a code  that they need to use For this brand of milk to get the two dollar deposit when you return the empty containers. The cashiers are not informed and I had a heavy set young girl with blond hair that works the night shift literally walk away from the register when I told her that I had spoken to the manager and that there is a two dollar return for returning the empty bottles of milk. She told me she has been working there for years and I'm not going to take this from a customer and she walked away from the register. This is so unprofessional and  disorderly of this shoprite. I asked the general manager to please inform all of your cashiers that there is a return deposit of $2 for this brand of milk. I am sick and tired of going in all the time and having to explain this to the cashiers while they look at me like if I'm crazy and that last cashier that just walked away from me and left me at the register by myself. This is so unprofessional and I have never seen anything like this in a supermarket .  I am hoping the manager sees my posts and something is done about the situation with this freakin organic milk.
2020-02-02,2,Long time customer ... finally giving up.... the delivery option. They systematically arrive Hours late, all frozen items unfrozen, and when you call should be patient very patient, when they answer and when they do not simply hang up on you several times... i was never reimbursed or got items replaced ... Usually they are very nice and love the choice there but the Sunday night is the worst and overall just loosing money ....
2020-01-05,2,Im only giving the benefit of 2 stars because of the convenience or delivery, but when you keep having to call the store because the orders are CONSISTENTLY missing items or delivery is up to 2 hours late, is that really convenient? Not at all. They used to be pretty good but the last 6 months or so have been really shitty. And I always ordered their store brand water but their new private brand, Bowl and Basket, is awful. Tonight, missing potatoes and rather than send someone with them, they pushed for me to accept a refund. I'm over it. Switching to Metro Park and if they can't get it together, I'm switching companies altogether.
2019-12-14,2,Let me say I have been going to this ShopRite since opening and it has been a decent place to get food.  However today experience was awful.  I went at 1:30 pm, walked to deli grabbed my number.  There were like 5 people in front of me waiting.  3 more people then grabbed numbers.   They had 2 people working behind counter.  Myself and 2 other customers we chatting about how they have gone thru 2 numbered customers in 20 min.  I walk over to customer service and tell the 2 ladies that deli needs help because they are so backed up.  She says ok and does nothing/no call to help.   Deli is backed up 7-9 customers, I am starring at customer service and she is giggling watching people wait.   Needless to say I put back minimal groceries I had and left.   Today's experience was piss poor management!!!
2019-12-01,2,The delivery option is super convenient since I don't have a car but they're not reliable at all.  Their 2 hour time frame basically means nothing. Currently still waiting for my order an hour after the window.Update to this: order finally came 2 hours after my window and they forgot more than half the items
2019-10-19,5,This review will be rather short since I only stopped by for a quick pick-up following a mobile order. Can I just say, this supermarket is the best thing since the Invention of supermarkets? From the moment I walked in, the ambiance was inviting, warm, the music, while in the 80s mold, happy, and everything in its place and at the ready for shoppers like me to enjoy an experience? I almost felt bad I only had to do a quick pick up and was unaware of where to go, but In a way I felt, who cares? Let me walk through for a bit. Feel the place out. See what it has. Boy, is it stacked to the gills with items of all shapes and sizes, especially for someone like me who prefers organic and healthy. I must add, a plant store, items for the Halloween season, a deli, and a wine/liquor place. Many thanks to Dakwon and his lovely female colleague who helped me finalize my order and were super friendly. I will be definitely coming back. Absolutely.
2019-10-16,5,Let me start by saying I love this shoprite. However, I ordered I order a cake with very simple but specific design for my nephews birthday and it was made completely off from what we asked. This was a very special birthday surprise because someone with us is going through stage 4 metastatic cancer and they were so excited to see his reaction to the perfect Harry Potter cake. The cake itself was delicious. Again this is solely based on the lack of the design. It is such a simple design and specific. They took a photo of the design we wanted. It should have said Happee Birthdae with bright pink icing and dark green writing. If they didn't feel spelling it the way we wanted could be done, they should have told us. This is the cake design we got, compared to the cake they were shown and said they could do.Again, the cake was delicious but it was not the special cake we asked for with the simple design and specific design.Update: upper management had the cake remade. It was again delicious and this time correctly designed perfectly! The family it was for was so excited! Amazing district manager!!!!
2019-10-14,4,The deli is delicious...not perfect but not bad at all...however...the bakery is heavenly....thank you sweet baby Jesus for their cheese Danish. Its the best l ever had in my life and as a fat(ish) middle aged man you know I've had lots of danishes! All the other baked goods are great too.
2019-09-11,5,I'm a refugee from the Weehawken ACME that's closing. Now that I started going to this ShopRite I have no idea why I shopped at that dump for so long.The meat here is actually fresh and not 1 day away from expiration, the deli looks appetizing, there's a good variety of staples, fun new niche products to try, and club sized packs of products making a trip to Walmart unnecessary. Not to mention the prices are way better than ACME! As well, the people who work here don't look like they're in constant misery. What a change!
2019-08-14,2,They really want the customer to use self check out, so they have 30 people on line for 3 cashier registers and 10 empty self check out registers.Because it is easier to lay off people and replace them with machines.
2019-05-06,5,This is a nice shop rite. Grocery stores in the city always look a mess after the pm rush or weekend rush but they do a really good job
2019-03-11,5,This shop rite is pretty great. Always well stocked, it's big, easy to find items, has a good selection of fresh produce and meat. You can find LaFrieda meat here too! Parking lot is pretty big, but can be chaotic. There's also a shop rite liquor attached to it, which makes it a nice one stop shop!
2019-03-04,4,Incredible selection of products. I once asked for a particular dairy free product and they asked me for the code. 2 weeks later I had it at the store. Great prices and awesome selection of different types of check out services so they are very fast. It is important to check the expiration dates on some of the articles just in case. Definitely my favourite grocery store in Hoboken.
2018-11-30,4,This is usually my go-to grocery store. It's neat, organized, well stocked, and the staff are moderately helpful. The very large parking lot is great and the new self check out lanes are a life saver. With a liquor section attached and hours as late as 12am Monday-Friday, you can't go wrong.
2018-10-21,3,Are you oblivous? Inconsiderate? Do you enjoy blocking aisles with an excessively large stroller while you tell your "friends" about your baby's gluten free diet? If so, you will LOVE this ShopRite!Other than being full of the people that are ruining Hoboken with their insatiable demand for Acai bowls and living in generic "Luxury" buildings, this place is ok. Definitely weak in the produce department, but it's not impossible to get your weekly shopping done. Prices seem higher than other ShopRites but way better than ACME or Kings. For specialty items, you may find yourself traveling to a larger supermarket outside of Hoboken.
2018-08-12,1,This is a poorly runned store they dont have enough of employees to keep the shelves stacked. Managers scream at workers no wonder why they dont have enough employees working there im surprised Ms.insarrea doesn't take a foot step inside to see how this place is being runned by people not knowing what there doing.   Sorry if i spelled your name wrong.  But someone needs to take control
2018-08-04,2,Good selection of items. Always not enough cashiers. 12 lines with one cashier open so be prepared to be standing in the line with 10-12 other trolleys ahead of you.
2018-07-28,5,Still love to shop at this Shoprite when I am leaving work...It has a parking lot now also have express registers and the employees are always able to help just about every single time...
2018-07-14,5,Thais is a wonderful supermarket. Although sometimes it may get busy and crowded, their hardworking employees are always extremely friendly and helpful. The store is always clean and I end up always getting exactly what I came for because they are fully stocked.
2018-06-23,1,Grocery Delivery is terrible don't waste your time !!! I waited 6 months from last time I tried buying grocery's online and having same terrible experience. They brought me wrong products, forget to delivery all frozen foods ordered. Website products don't match what delivered. products smashed I live a mile away. Fresh Direct works out to be the same after you equate there $21.00 delivery fee.  Just terrible I hope someone from HQ see this as its a terrible situation as I don't go to the store as it takes minimum 1 hour to check out and delivery is terrible.So frustrating
2018-06-21,1,I never thought I could feel such hate for a supermarket but this place brings it out of me. It is the worst shopping experience imaginable. Most of the staff is obnoxious. I can't see how they could be employed anywhere. Go to Trader Joe's. Put this place out of business. I just went there and for the millionth time the price was wrong. I didn't even bother arguing with them again. Life's too short. I wish this place would burn to the ground.
2018-05-21,5,Bakery review! We loved the strawberry shortcake this weekend- it was fresh and delicious! Highly recommend!!! I also love the fresh croissants and the black and white cookies. The prices are great and the quality is exceptional.
2018-04-29,3,The good? This place is massive and they have everything. Tons of produce, tons of cuts of meat, and tons of random stuff. Chances are you can and will find whatever you are looking for. The bad? They probably have 30 cash registers. On the busiest of days, there's probably 8 registers open. It's not uncommon on a weekend for a line to be 8 people deep, so if you are going on a weekend, be prepared for a delay to check out. Bonus feature: the liquor store. They have an excellent selection of beer, wine, and liquor. Prices are generally ok, but I do find some bourbons to be 20% more than they should be. Either way, once again, they have what you want in a pinch.
2018-04-05,4,Writing a review to give shouts out to the deli counter workers and the great experience I have every time I go to it. Matter of fact, it might be the highlight of my week because if theres anything I love more than beautifully sliced cold cuts, its a friendly person. Not once have I gone there and have been treated rudely or NOT presented with a smile and above and beyond customer service. These people genuinely like being Hobokens go to meat suppliers, and I wish I liked anything as much as they like dishin' out dem meats. Boars Head, Thumann's, Glen Rock, Imported, Domestic, you name it babe. Even the ShopRite brand impresses the biggest Cold Cut ConnoisseurTM. Definitely try the store roasted roast beef. You can find this sexy seasoned chuck right in the window for $9.99/lb. Sits front and center, all moist and sexy waiting to be sliced, bagged and thrown between two slices of WB. Another well deserved shouts is the Sushi Bar. This is a hidden gem not too many people realize. Kings Supermarket tote themselves as "premium" or "high quality", but all they do is slap a bigger price tag on their products and only appeal to upper middle class suburban folks who wear Canada Goose Down Jackets and have $5,000 strollers for their child. Comparing Sushi, for example, between SR and Kings is Apples to Oranges. First off, the variety and choices you get at ShopRite is much more extensive (literally a full menu) than Kings. And quality is second to none, meaning its the best. I'll see myself out, all this sandwich talk has me itchin for a salami fixin.
2018-04-02,5,I enjoy this shoprite. Never have to wait too long to check out. I wait longer at the deli counter than I do to check out
2018-03-24,3,Overall this is an excellent ShopRite..... My issue is with the damn deli.  It's clean, the meats are always fresh, they have an excellent selection of prepared cold salads/entrees and plenty of cold cut brands to choose from.  The problem lies with the slicing of the meat or cheese.  How hard is it to get stuff sliced right?  A request for "paper thin" means "paper thin" and not a 1/4 inch thick slice!!!  I'm slightly over exaggerating but you get my point.  Meat, machine set at thin settling and then slice the damn thing. Please...
2018-03-08,1,If I could give this place a negative star I would!! I have had so many issues here from the staff, to managers, to delivery (I have ordered 3 times and every time they mess up!!)to them ALWAYS running out of stuff and NEVER restocking, it's crazy!!I have always loved shoprite it's my "go to" supermarket until I moved to Hoboken and started shopping here, I have just had the worst experiences!! Most other shoprite are great I have no idea what went wrong here, it's really sad. If you have the option to go somewhere else I highly suggest it!!
2018-02-23,5,The. BEST in Hoboken hands down, vast selection of everything Meat,Fish,veg ..... lots of organic products too, it can get a bit crazy at the weekends but well worth going to, deliver can be a bit spotty so maybe use an UBER if you don't have a car. I have been going here for over 10 years and have never seen anything nasty.
2018-02-16,5,Love this ShopRite. The employees are so helpful. They have given me the attention needed. Thankful to have them as a staple in our community.
2017-11-02,2,Always went there because it was close by. But I picked up some ground beef a few days ago and it's all discolored with black juices coming out of it. Wouldn't recommend going here if you want fresh food.
2017-10-28,5,Clean, well organized, and the prices are fantastic! They have a good range of products across the board. the fruit and veg section is well stocked and fresh and they offer a range of local produce. Good selection of organic items in all departments. They always have a lot of their special offer items in stock as well so they don't run out. I avoid shopping at weekends as it gets ridiculously busy but that's about my only complaint. All in all an excellent supermarket.
2017-07-27,4,Despite some of the negative reviews I've read about this ShopRite, I think it's very organized and has everything you'll need. I wrote a review for the Jersey City ShopRite which is horrendous and hectic. Compared to that location, the Hoboken store is heavenly. I used to go grocery shopping on the weekends, but it gets so packed, I've started going during the week when I can. There's still only a few lanes open, but I don't have to wait too long. I buy everything from chicken to meat, produce, and frozen foods. I've never had a problem and will be coming here for my main grocery needs!
2017-07-05,3,Update:OK like today I bought guacamole and today is Oct 20th by the way, and the guacamole was 19 days expired and brown, but I wouldn't have noticed the way it's packaged and I'm not someone that religiously checks best by dates.  I would've let it go if it was like Oct 15th or something, but it literally said best by Oct 1st... --Half friendly people, half not.  It's also crowded from 3-7pm any day of the week and on weekends.  If you go after 10pm they're usually restocking, which blocks off a lot of the aisles for you but it is the best time to go since the checkout lines aren't crowded.The sushi is surprisingly decent along with the gyozas.  The fish counter is pretty helpful too and friendly.  I also enjoy the cheese section when you first walk in, which has more cheese selection than a Shoprite I used to frequent in South Jersey which is like three times the size.There will be no bananas come Saturday or Sunday it seems like.  Mostly, Sunday night shows no bananas left.  They can vary from being overripe to underripe which is odd.  Never a good spread of ripeness.  A review on the people? As usual, Hobokenites are crazy and decide that they can go through the 10 or so items line with like 30 items then chat the cashier's ear off.  Also, they're aggressive with their carts.  Come on, you're not getting anywhere any faster and no one is going to steal your soy milk.
2017-07-04,1,I live literally across from this ShopRite and it's so nasty. I once was buying lettuce and saw the fish guy with his hand down the back of his pants (he didn't realize I was standing there obviously). Seriously? I never bought fish there again obviously. The store is generally dirty. When you walk in by the deli counter is smells so foul. The kids working the checkout lines aren't even trained to say hello, have a good day or honestly anything to you. Once one of them sliced his finger on a cardboard swiffer box and it was bleeding everywhere and then without washing his hands rang my groceries through. Thanks, but no thanks. So happy for Trader Joe's!!!!
2017-06-17,3,Their online shop at home service is one of the oldest, but now not so great anymore. Every time I place an order, I get a phone call that they are sold out of at least one of the items I order. Every. Time. For the last four years. Now with the newer online services in the market, it's dated, old in their ways. And some of the delivery guys are rude at the door. It no longer can justify the $20 delivery fee. I have been having better luck with the newer services.
2017-05-25,1,This store is the most unfriendly store as well as not helpful.  No one says hello.   How are you today.  Asks if you found everything you need.  This store needs a lot of help from corporate if this is not the business model.
2017-03-21,4,Large, well stocked grocery store with super - helpful staff, but word from the wise - SAVE YOURSELF DO NOT GO ON A SUNDAY!
2017-02-27,4,Clean, deli counter is open fairly late, wish there was more variety in the organic food section and more multicultural food items. But the main reason I wanted to post was because I just tried this store's rotisserie chicken and it is by far the BEST rotisserie chicken I have ever had - juicy and well seasoned! Try it! A great option for dinner when you're short on time! Wish they had some hot sides to buy as well but regardless, this chicken is damn good!
2017-01-29,2,This review is about the bakery (although just want to make a quick comment that the bananas are never of normal ripeness - either bright green or black).I ordered a cake 24 hours in advance. The girl on the phone seemed annoyed with my order (it was really simple and for a 1/8 sheet cake, nothing crazy at all) and acted really unprofessional, but still took the order and assured me it would be ready the next day.The next day, I went to pick it up 2 hours after the time I asked for it to be ready and was told the slip was in the wrong place and it hadn't been made yet. They said it would be ready in 20 minutes, however like most people ordering a cake I had a party to attend at a specific time. The bakery women were nice, but not overly apologetic. I just picked out an already made cake and rushed out of the store (which wasn't easy to do on a Sunday afternoon). After leaving, I called the store manager to let him know what happened and he offered me a full refund for the cake and was extremely apologetic for my experience. So, overall:Pros: cakes/cookies are really good especially given the price. Store manager takes accountability for the store/issues that may arise.Cons: the people working here may act unprofessional and rude.Tip: If you need an order for an important event, definitely call morning of to make sure they are indeed working on it for you!
2017-01-03,5,The short version: This is a great supermarket and we are lucky to have it here in Hoboken.The longer version: I find a lot of the critical reviews of this ShopRite to be pretty unfair. We live in a crowded urban environment, people. Shopping anywhere in this town isn't going to feel like a Wegman's in a spread out suburb. Many people seem to be complaining about shopping here on a weekend. Are there any pleasant weekend grocery shopping experiences in densely populated areas? Of course the store and the parking lot are going to be crowded, and it's not surprising that some items may run out during prime shopping times. I'll still take it over any of the nearby alternatives.I grew up going to bigger supermarkets (including ShopRites) in the suburbs and then spent many years dealing with the absurdity of trying to go grocery shopping in NYC -- including the Union Square Trader Joe's where sometimes you'll see a bouncer doing crowd control because the line to pay starts at the entrance to the store, and any number of Gristede's locations with overpriced, expired food. So from my perspective, the Hoboken SR has managed to cram in an impressive variety of food into a relatively small footprint while keeping the aisles navigable. In addition to what you typically find in a standard supermarket, the offerings range from a small but decent organic selection and growing "natural" and gluten-free sections, to meats from wild boar to ground lamb to pigs' feet, and various items catering to a Latino crowd (yuca, plaintains, Cuban bread, violet baby perfume, saint candles, vitamin supplements I thought you could only get in West New York and Union City). The store gets lots of foot traffic, which means lots of turnover and thus fresh food.ShopRite's prices are very fair, unlike King's (to be expected) or even Acme. I live closer to Acme but hate going because the produce and meat almost always look questionable and everything not on sale is way more expensive than at ShopRite. And the sales at SR are especially great -- the other day I picked up 28 oz. cans of plum tomatoes for $0.69 each. tl;dr -- This store is great and I'm grateful for it.
2016-11-10,2,Dirty store, ALWAYS out of many items, lousy attitudes from the check-out people.  Produce is not always fresh and in constant disarray.  One butcher (thick accent) asked me out on a date after I asked a question about meat.  Forget trying to buy their roasted chickens as they are in the oven or they have shut off the ovens.  Seafood department never has anyone working and the deli department tells you rudely that it is not their department so either wait for someone or forget it and buy what is already packaged.  I guess it is back to Acme again even though the prices are a little higher they always have a clean store and very friendly staff.
2016-11-02,2,A very bad Shop Rite. I'm surprised the corporate folks don't do more to protect their brand. This store is very dirty, usually uncomfortably warm and poorly ventilated, and just emits a bad vibe. Long register lines ALWAYS, miserable cashiers, dirty shopping carts and parking lot, terrible produce, and they are frequently out of things.The employees here seem to have an angry indifference to customer service and appear annoyed and unhappy. My experience has been that this type of attitude trickles down from the top management. The senior people here must not be very nice.The good news: A Trader Joe's is opening within walking distance of this Shop Rite in early 2017, so my trips to this store will be significantly reduced. I look forward to going here much less and as soon as another major chain opens anywhere near here, this store will become a memory.
2016-10-30,1,This store is horrible never have ANYTHING IN STOCK! How does a store not have for example green peppers, potatoes, mushrooms and the list goes on and on! Amazes me when your in the store at the busiest times they are stocking????? with big carts, boxes blocking the aisles and the employees do not even move out of the way! Plus if you ever use their delivery service its even WORSE! never on time, again out of everything and they must purposely be picking bad produce as I have had things so rotten they stunk and create moisture in the bottom of the bag. I also have received rotten smelly meat as well as defrosted frozen items. The employees are a bunch of idiots that are more interested in playing around with each other than actually doing their job or helping anyone. I would suggest if you have similar grips to call corporate and report the mismanagement of this store. Perhaps than we can get a management team that can step it up and at least make it a half way decent experience.
2016-10-04,3,Where do I start. This is a really tough place to do your food shopping. Sometimes I even drive a half a hour out of the way to another town just to have a quality shopping experience because I know I won't get that here. As much as I love me some parking lot action in Hoboken, its not always guaranteed you can even get a spot in the lot without having to stalk people around the lot for 10-15 mins, especially on the weekend, and randomly on week nights. Once you manage to park, the rest of your adventure begins. Yes, the difficulty in parking is a real indication about how the rest of your experience will go. Your next hurdle is getting a shopping cart. Sometimes during the week this will be an easy task, but on the weekends, if there is one in the lot, take it. Especially if it works. Once you roll into the store, you will find yourself in the produce aisle. Well, that is if you can navigate the large displays they have blocking that area first. The quality in that area leaves a lot to be desired with constant rotten produce riddled amongst the displays. Also, there is no guarantee they will have what you are looking for as they are often out of random things. The store is also oddly organized. If you want things like hummus or prepared chicken or fresh pasta, thats all in that front part of the store, together. Yeah I dont get it either. Dont try to find the gluten free stuff without help, you'll be there for days looking. The back of the store is better organized but by that time, you've spent all of your energy navigating the first half of your trip. I will say that the staff who work there are always helpful and are willing to take you right to where you need to find something. They are my saving grace when I am there and earn themselves a star all on their own. The other star, it has a liquor store! Major score there. I've actually called the corporate office and tweeted at them telling them to send more help to that store because the employees try the best they can, I really believe that. Bring your patience and a flexible list that you can take things off of when you cant get it or find it. I bid you good luck should you take the challenge to shop here, especially if you choose to do so on a Sunday.
2016-09-23,5,very happy with this shop rite i was looking for the two pounds of already pop popcorn so i called the store and the deli dept personnel when and checked for me. is so nice when a employee take that extra step to help a customer.
2016-09-04,5,cant  say enough  good things about  this store. Staff is  hard working, courteous and will go out of their way to accommodate   your  needs. on line  shopping  is teriffc  ;  last minute changes to orders  are a breeze  with the help of  their friendly and courteous  personnel.  great  to shop  in store  as  well.   wide  variety of  choices  in fruits,  veggies, all  products.    Deli department  is  great;  always  fresh  meats and salads.  on line delivery is  prompt and  delivery  men and women are  friendly  and  efficient.
2016-08-30,5,Love it! I travel quite a bit for my job to different states and cities, honestly, I have yet to find another super market (not even other shoprites) to compare to this one! I feel lucky I live a few blocks from it. Great fresh products, incredible prices (thank you wakefern!), and their manager specials are just too good to miss. What I love about it most is variety; I can buy groceries to make dinner that costs $2 per meal (basic salad, ground beef, rice, veggies /beans) or one that costs $20 per meal (gourmet appetizers, fresh same day flown in seafood from Alaska), and anything in between! Thank you shoprite Hoboken!
2016-08-27,1,Well organized and has a lot of stuff. Also it's very convenient and close to me. But the last 3 times I went there I've come home with my groceries only to find that something is open or ripped! The first time it was a can of oatmeal where the seal was broken and the oatmeal exposed. You had to take off the top before you could see it. The second time it was a bag of chips that was ripped on the side. The third time I twisted open a carton of soy milk once I got home and the metal seal was already punctured! This has never happened to me at any grocery store in my life, let alone 3 times at the same one...
2016-05-29,2,I gave Shoprite 3 stars before, because the butcher shop, and the people who work in the butcher shop are fantastic. There is a bigger selection of  organic and free range meat, it is clean, well stocked and they are always willing to help.I only wish the rest of the store was that way. The fact that Shoprite has done absolutely nothing to address the environmental questions about plastic bags, really bothers me. Once they gave you a discount if you brought your own bags. Acme, Trader Joe's and Whole Foods still do this. In New York, there will be a surcharge starting next year on anyone who asks for a plastic bag. It's about time we got the same law in NJ. The people who shop at this store have no respect for seemingly anything. The outside, where you get your cart, is always filled with newspapers, plastic bags, garbage, carts with stuff in them, people loitering, It's awful. People slam their carts into the bushes, drop their garbage on the grass - all in all a bunch of slobs shopping there. Then comes the service. I went to customer service and asked if they'd be carrying a certain item again. The woman called the manager and he just said, "no." At Acme, Whole Foods and Trader Joe's, you can put in a request for them to reorder something. I've found the service to be less than helpful and, except for organic meat, we are taking our business elsewhere - especially to stores that actually exist in the 21st century and are part of the solution and not the problem.
2016-04-14,4,ShopRite is my go to local supermarket. It seems like they are open all the time and are well stocked. It is quite large, so there is very good selection. They have fresh produce, a flower section, a meats and fish counter for you carnivores. In addition, they also have a bakery for your pastry/cake needs. But most fabulous of all is their beer/spirits section in the back which also is well stocked. Get a ShopRite members card and get some nice discounts. The staff are also very helpful because my wife forgot to take home a bag of groceries once. So she went back the next day and just presented her receipt and got all her goodies no questions asked.
2016-04-04,4,The Hoboken ShopRite Bakery did a fantastic job on a cupcake pull-apart cake that I ordered. I put in an order online about a week before I needed the cake. It was about a dollar per cupcake, and I asked for 30 cupcakes with a Spiderman theme. I provided a link to a picture that I hoped they would base it off of, but it turns out they didn't receive the link? Or didn't have internet access there? They gave me a call after the order went in and confirmed with me the details that I provided. Instead of basing it off the picture, she said she had her son's figurine that she would do her best to base it off of. So I left it in her hands and she did great! You can see the attached picture. Not what I had originally pictured, but still very good. I asked for her to set aside a certain number of cupcakes to put "H-B-D" and then my boyfriend's name on it (yes the Spiderman cake was for my boyfriend) so she could put 1 letter on each cupcake and I could line them up above and below the Spiderman cake, but she ended up making a separate small pull apart cake with that on it instead. I guess there was a miscommunication there - it was kind of hard to explain over the phone. But everything still looked great - everyone was really impressed and LOVED the cake. Got lots of comments about how great the cake was (chocolate cake with vanilla icing). We had a few leftover that we brought home that ended up getting tossed over in the box and looked a mess, but they were still eaten :)Another thing to note - if you intend on having someone else pick up your cake, make sure that you call them in advance and give the person who's picking up the receipt (sent through email confirmation after your online order)!
2016-02-02,1,The delivery service from Shoprite Hoboken is extremely careless and terrible. Two weeks in a row items were missing from my order and they still have not arrived. Customer service has not reached out to me to apologize or credit me for the 50.00 in items missing from my order. Extremely unhappy and will never order delivery of groceries from there again
2016-01-12,4,Good selection and price in the Hoboken area, sometimes it's crowded and they run low on items or the produce section gets messy, but typically it's a good experience
2015-11-04,1,The rest of the store is acceptable.  The one issue I have, (knocking my rating down 4 stars), is the deli counter.  Let me tell you, I know my way around a deli counter.  These workers take so long it doesn't matter if there are two people or two hundred people.  They are constantly moving slowly, talking to each other about topics that should be mentioned around food.  I ordered corned beef, they took out the pastrami, I said, "no, that is pastrami."  He turned to his co-worker and asked which one was corned beef.  She responded, "the one that looks like a shaved cat."  Riddle me this, is that something you want a customer who wants to purchase that cold cut to hear? I didn't want to hear it.  The analogy may have held weight, but not something to discuss in front of customers.  ShopRite deli counter: get better.
2015-11-04,4,Shop Rite is your best bet in Hoboken, if you are looking for a balance of good prices, selection, and quality. This Shop Rite has ample parking and a clean, organized store with a very good selection at a fair price. The deli is almost always crowded and sometimes the deli service is poor, but other than that, I usually find what I'm looking for here. I came in one day to find a particular type of bean, thinking it would be in the Goya section. When I asked for help, the employee couldn't find what I was looking for either, but promptly stated that she would talk to her manager about ordering the product. I very much appreciated that gesture and I have found the staff to be pretty attentive overall. Don't forget to redeem your free turkey one you get 400/400 points.
2015-09-24,3,Just an update: I've found that for a shop rite, the seafood selection is awesome, and the manager of that section is really great at his job. Further, attached to the seafood counter is a sushi counter. The sushi chefs are also great. They will make anything fresh for you right on the spot. I've tried a few fresh rolls and a few rolls from the case and none of them disappointed. Unfortunately, the rest of the store still leaves some things to be desired. For instance, the pharmacy closes at 2pm on Sunday. Also, the liquor store employees are very rude, and the hours posted on the door aren't always kept -- they tend to close early randomly and it always seems to coincide with a time that I would actually need to buy liquor (like football Sunday, Friday night, etc.)
2015-09-01,5,I do my weekly grocery shopping here and I am never let down. Their produce is always fresh and cheap, their meats are fresh and nicely packaged, their fish is always fresh and never smells. The store has great sales, online coupons, gets busy on Sundays but thats expected. Overall, great grocery store and cheapest prices in the area.
2015-08-26,4,Way better than A&P in Hoboken, or Kings, but that's not exactly saying too much. But it has parking and it is clean, so kudos.Pros:Huge parking lotDecent selectionCoupon crazies welcomeClean overallCons:Bakery is awful, don't go there by any meansGluten free or low carb or any other dietary restrictions...sorryCrowded at the deli, always...a 15 minute wait to get cheese is awful (not because they don't have enough workers but because the workers are all so slow, chatty, and forgetful)Delivery or online never leads to good produce or anything fresh (Fresh Direct has them beat) so just go inNo discounts for BYOB (when will NJ learn that plastic bags are not our friends)
2015-07-30,4,I love this shop rite, much better than the big one in North Bergen. This one is super clean and has a better look and feel. Great selection of deli and salads, cheese, bakery and storemade dips and sauces. Good meat selection- they even have lamb, which is a huge plus.
2015-07-13,4,This ShopRite is alright in my book. It's big and always has reasonable prices. Use your ShopRite card and get hooked up with all the sales. I second the post below mine, dont come on Sundays. On Sundays there is no food, at all. Only tons and tons of people. It's also very hectic during the week around 6PM when everyone is out of work. I know its tough not to come at this time but if you can avoid it, do so. The parking lot is massive but always packed. Better off just parking in the back and walking rather than wasting your time or possibly getting into an accident (theres always so much going on), you really need to be 100000000000% paying attention.My only complaint is the deli is always jammed packed. I've gone at 9AM on a Saturday and still waited, such a bummer. I guess there's no getting around it. I usually take my ticket and shop for my produce while I'm waiting to be called.ShopRite is definitely the best super market in Hoboken but if you only need a thing or two, go to A&P, it will probably be a quicker trip.
2015-06-09,4,One of the only "normal size" grocery stores in Hoboken and generally it's pretty alright -- decent prices, good selection. It does get out of control busy in the evenings/weekends (ex. not a cart nor basket in sight at 630 on a Monday night) but lines are tolerable for the most part, though maybe I'm just jaded to appreciate anything that's not lined out the door a la TJ's Union Square. The deli, however, is always seemingly overstaffed and yet moves at a snail's pace.
2015-04-21,5,Shout out to Mike for the delicious Dora & Diego cake! My only regret is ordering a full sheet cake because I find myself waking in the middle of the night eating it!
2015-04-01,1,This store has items consistently more expensive then other shop rites They are also clueless about keeping express lanes open from 4/5 pm to 8pm. You would figure they know the young urban population that makes up much of Hoboken is going to shop at that time. I've waited 10 minutes or more on line only to have one of their little girl employees stroll along and finally open the register she's supposed to be on. Tonight they had 1 express lane open at 730 pm. Worst of all those express are open during the day.also their liquor cant compare to buy right liquors across the street of home depot in JC. 5 minute car ride from there.  paid $9  more for a case a beer here
2015-03-03,4,Not great for everything but has several great well priced items:1. Free range antibiotic free chicken and meats....much better prices and selection than anywhere else in Hoboken2. Excellent seafood counter3. Talenti gelato that is well priced4. Good produce section5. Parking These five things alone bring us here....
2015-03-02,4,This is my go to grocery in Hoboken. They offer a great selection and good quality produce. This location also has a liquor store #multitasking, the staff is very friendly in every department. I only took away one star because of the deli department. It doesn't matter if it's empty or crowded with four employees behind the counter...they are SLOW! I have anxiety about getting my biweekly deli meat supply but for the quality and price I wouldn't go anywhere else!
2015-02-26,5,Best supermarket in Hoboken (is it the only one in Hoboken).  Plenty of stock, and an attached wine and liquor store make this location very convenient.Don't try to get in there on a Sunday night or Monday night unless you want to fight crowds, though.
2015-02-11,4,It's always baffling to see how the quality in a franchise can change from one store to the next. Unlike the ShopRite in Jersey City, Hoboken's outpost is easily one of the best chain supermarkets I've been to.The aisles are clean, the shelves well-stocked and uncluttered, and the prices were great.It's a vast improvement over ShopRite of Metro Plaza (odd, seeing as how they're run by the same co-op), even if it is a schelp to get to. There is a parking lot on site but even at 10am on a Wednesday morning, it was a good 3/4 full.
2015-01-27,4,Food. Don't come on Sunday. No food on Sunday, just lots of people looking for food / people waiting to check out that already took the food that you wanted. Parking. Though the lot parking my be littered with grocery carts and people waiting for close spaces. If you are a resident your best bet is parallel parking in each side. Some food is on sale. Other food is definitely not on sale. Liquor store. No easy way to get in, but cheap six packs are a'plenty. Come for the food (not Sunday), stay for the deals (and drinks), and don't try and take a cart past the property line. It'll lock up, you will run into it (and look funny / be in pain).
2015-01-25,5,I come to Shoprite for my weekly grocery shopping. Wide selection of products. The whole store has been newly renovated, a lot cleaner than the one in Jersey City. There is a liquor store attached next to Dairy at the end of the store. All the produce is always so fresh. Great sales every week!! I'm a big fan of their can can sales. I usually stock up on non-perishables during those sales. Avoid going on weekends is possible. They also double coupons under a dollar, unless specified on the coupon. They also offer online ordering with home delivery through their website.
2015-01-01,3,I generally don't write yelp reviews of grocery stores but feel compelled to today. Shoprite is my go-to store for weekly groceries or whenever I need to make a quick trip for milk or eggs. The food selection is decent and the attached liquor store is great. My one and only gripe is some (not all) of the check out clerks provide astoundingly bad customer service. Don't get me wrong, some of the clerks are wonderful. And I understand it's a job typically for high school students and the pay isn't high and I'm sure they deal with their fair share of annoying customers and everyone has bad days...but come on! For instance, today in the middle of my transaction the check out girl stops and then this conversation happened between her and another clerk or manager:Girl: manny I can't do this anymoreManny: can't do what?Girl: this. *motions around herself* can I go home early?My boyfriend and I were so shocked we didn't even know what to do- we just looked at each other. Looking back now I can't help but laugh at how ridiculous that whole interaction was. Luckily for me (I guess), she finished ringing me up. She didn't even look at me once or say one word to me. Outside of this situation, I often have to listen to check out clerks having private conversations with other clerks while I'm being rung up. Now I know this is quite a long review for something that isn't a huge deal. But it really feels like I'm in a comedy sketch or am being punk'd when trying to buy groceries. Shoprite, dear shoprite, please provide better training to your staff. Thanks in advance.
2014-12-27,4,I come to this store whenever I feel lazy and don't feel like driving, this store is only a short 5 minute walk from my house.  They do have a huge parking lot which is very rare in Hoboken, but it takes my just as long if not longer to drive here and back then to walk.  They have a liquor store inside to make this a one stop shopping experience.The food here is fresh and selection is good.  I especially like that they carry D'Artagnan products, you can find them in the meat section.  The seafood here is also fresh.Store itself is kept very clean.  I would like to see more organic products here though, but for what I shop here for it will make due.They also offer delivery and if you use the store card you can save a lot of money on their specials that change weekly.
2014-12-07,1,Terrible customer service combined with unethical business practices.First experience with their shop from home service turned out to be a nightmare.apparantly,they charge more rates in final bill as against the rates published online and also cheat in the bill with weight and calculations.When called, the customer service tries to avoid the questions and each one of them try to escape by putting the phone on hold.It's a rip off and people should be made aware not to shop online with them.
2014-09-29,2,Possibly the most poorly managed deli of any store I have ever visited.   Grab a number and be ready to stand around while employees seemingly do everything imaginable except help you get your order.
2014-09-25,3,This supermarket is expensive miy, has raised prices motablemente, a bag of cheese buying cursta to $ 9.99 now $ 16.00, the same with the meat and other products, is very expensive, my friends and I are looking for other places to buy
2014-08-27,4,Your average, run of the mill Shoprite but this place gets extra points for the parking lot, Myra at the deli counter, and the liquor store being connected to the actual grocery portion.  Prices are significantly cheaper then any of the other "grocery" stores in the area.  The parking lot is very large and I have never had an issue finding a spot.  It shares the space with CKO so you might see some attractive albeit very sweaty eye candy as you walk by.  This location does not have the automated deli machine.  The thing where you can input your order in the front of the store, do your shopping, and then return to the deli counter and pick up your items.  Here you pick and number and wait.  I normally avoid this type of interaction at all costs as those who work at the deli tend to be really grouchy and downright nasty.  In steps Myra.  Myra is simply wonderful.  She'll talk to you if that's your thing, give you recomendations and samples if that's your thing, or simply let you play with your phone while she slices your meats and cheeses to your liking.  She's also hilarious.  Go see her. The liquor store has an entrance that is connected to the actual grocery store and you can make a purchase and still shop, just make sure the receipt is showing as you walk out.  They have a wide selection of wine, beer, and booze however make sure you stand behind the duct tape on the floor otherwise the surly little man behind the counter will tell you you're in the wrong spot.  I shit you not.  Always an experience, never a dull moment, and produce.  Whats not to love.
2014-08-22,3,I could not give less than three stars because the shelves are stocked with real food (as opposed to Kings), the butchers are very good and there is ample parking. However, the state of the adjacent park which Sr supposedly maintains is over flowing with garbage and the graffiti I had reported some time ago was never cleaned up. I go here if I can get to the store in the morning. Otherwise it is over crowded and at times  the aisles are being used as a playground including ball bouncing and razors.
2014-08-12,5,AMAZING PRICES - great sales and great service.  My favorite grocery store.
2014-07-07,2,I know there are other very nice shoprites in south jersey but most of the time this store is unacceptable.  They always restock at peak times creating an unnecessary amount of traffic for food that isn't there, produce is terrible and I've waited 20 minutes in line before to checkout. Definitely need to rethink some basics. Only saving grace is the liquor store.
2014-06-22,5,Best supermarket in Hoboken. Great sales prices. Friendly staff.Clean.Items are fresh. Decent health food section that I love. Cheap self serve frozen yogurt and snack bar in store. Sushi bar is available and cheap, but low quality.
2014-05-30,2,The store is generally great except for the produce department. I have brought home spoiled, moldy fruit too many times. Today I must have looked through 8 or 9 containers of strawberries and they all had mold on them.  The worst was that I stopped 2 men that worked in that department and told them and their answer was will get to it later.  They lost my business.
2014-05-12,5,A couple is now running the sushi department at Shoprite, Hoboken.  Fantastic.  Cheaper and better than any other Sushi place in Hoboken. No one even comes close.  The women  and man, married couple, are very friendly and super helpful.  Be sure you say hello when buying or looking, they prepared some special things for me that I they and I thought I would like. Doug
2014-03-08,3,I actually highly prefer ShopRite over A&P. They have a larger selection of everything and they actually have some organic and gluten free items. Good job ShopRite. Now if only you guys had organic apple juice but then again, I don't want to ask for too much.
2014-03-03,1,ShopRite Home Delivery - horrible! I have been using this service for nearly four years and I am done with them. I have been screwed over so many times, and management never cared when I would call. This past order was the final straw for my fiance and I. Seeing as we rely on public transportation, we use home delivery for the convenience but it is always a headache. I placed my order to arrive in the morning time slot. A little after 11 the delivery driver dropped off the groceries. While putting away over $300 worth of items, I noticed that some key items were missing from my order and the bag of bagels had a huge hole in it. We called right away and the response was not very convincing. They said they would bring the missing items right out.To make a very long story short, we called all afternoon, and every time we called they said "the driver will be right there." So when did he show up? At 9:30 at night!!! And guess what? They were the WRONG items. We waited ten hours for the wrong items. We called ShopRite back and the girl working was defensive and implied that we were at fault for them not being able to read the computerized order correctly. My fiance spoke to a manager who was very apologetic, named Bill. He is the first and only manager who has ever taken the sh*t-show that is home delivery seriously and told us that he would send someone back out with the correct items.He also told us we would be refunded for the missing items and for the delivery charge. This was last week and we still have not been refunded. Oh, and when the delivery man showed up around 10:00 p.m. with the correct items? Yeah, they still were not what we ordered. So from now on we will use Fresh Direct. They are more expensive and don't carry all of the items we need, but they care about their customers, and the accuracy of the orders and deliveries. It's a shame, but the Hoboken ShopRite staff does not take care in their work or their customers.
2014-02-21,1,Ordered from the online service and i've now sat around 2 nights in a row waiting for a delivery that still hasn't shown up. My order was originally supposed to be delivered last night between 8-10. At 9:59 i get a call that the truck was stuck in the snow (even though it hasnt snowed in days!) and he couldnt get to my apt until midnight! Since i had a very early meeting the next morning, i could not stay up. So, in order to 'reschedule' i had to call another number, sit on hold for 40 minutes, to finally reschedule for tonight. AGAIN, they were supposed to be here between 8-10. It's 11pm and still nothing. One of the worst services i've ever used.
2014-02-19,2,First time to shop online with them. I ordered two pounds of duck confit for $9 and when delivered, they gave me 4 of the 5oz packs for $32. ( note I chose no substitute allowed at the checkout online ). In total, I ordered 178 dollars of grocery and the final order came in at $220! Quite a couple items are substituted with other brands that cost twice as much. It maybe true that they are delivering food with better quality than I ordered so it costs more, but I don't want to be forced to pay for the stuff that I didn't want, especially when I tell them no substitute! ( even if you allow it, I won't consider the $32 vs $9 should be sub-ing each other. In general I have a pretty good time going to the physical store but I have to say I am very very disappointed at the online shopping / delivery service. ( have to say delivery person is nice and punctual, that deserves my two stars.
2014-01-05,3,This store is large and usually well stocked. The cashiers are typically kind and nice to speak to. My biggest complaint is that the produce section always leaves a lot to be desired. It also smells horribly like mold and dirt. This also seems to be the only part of the store not well stocked especially with fresh products. Every time I go to the lemon section, I find mushy lemons and typically a handful with white mold. I am not sure how the produce section falls so short especially when this location is always busy. I try to go to other stores for produce when I can.
2013-11-11,4,I'm a fan of this ShopRite because my gym is conveniently located on top of it. I have no excuses to say I don't have healthy  food at home because right after my kick boxing class, I can pick up all the stuff I need. My mom also prefers to shop in this location rather than the one in Jersey City which is closer to us. She loves how everything is organized, clean, but most importantly fresh.
2013-11-03,4,Though we have never gone into the store or checked in :) I thought I would review this place.My wife orders our groceries from them online every week.  They are always pretty helpful when calling for items that are unavailable or a different size.  The delivery people are always friendly and bring the groceries into the kitchen for us to unpack instead of just dropping them off at the door for us to lug.You do pay a little extra for the service, $12.95 for ordering online and $6.95 for the delivery but according to my wife that is nothing compared to the cost of the time to shop, the gas and of course impulse buying while perusing the aisles.We usually order a day ahead and are able to pick a 2 hour window in which they will deliver.  What would you rather do, spend 3 hours on a weekend food shopping, or, and extra $20 for the luxury of having it all delivered to your door?
2013-09-13,5,CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN! Cashiers etc GREAT AND FRIENDLY! ( customer service not so much) PRODUCTS FRESH, good sales, and the bathrooms are clean with soap, and they offer cart wipes!!
2013-09-10,3,First the market is great after hurricane sandy. Second everything you want is there and is easy to find unlike other places. Although there are things to like the prices can be slightly higher than other supermarkets are in the area (A&P, Pathmark) but it is a convenient for the residents in that area but somewhat hard to get to since its located toward that far end of Hoboken.
2013-09-05,4,Not much to add than to mention this Shoprite is far better than the one in Jersey City, which is a madhouse.
2013-08-23,4,Pretty solid here.  Good prices, and pretty fresh produce and seafood.  Hoboken is a ripoff in general, so it's nice to see realistic prices for a change.  The store is pretty large for the area and you can pretty much find whatever you are looking for.I recently was in a situation where I could not make it to the store so I had them deliver my groceries.  It's a pretty cool experience.  They brought everything right into my living room.  The were at the later end of the "window", but the order was accurate.  Fresh Direct is probably comparable.  Shoprite charges around $20 to deliver, but with lower prices than Fresh Direct.  I would say that they are about equal in terms of service and quality.
2013-07-07,5,It makes me so sad to see that picture from Sandy! The good thing is that they're back and batter than ever. I used to go to A&P, but after coming to ShopRite after it reopened, that's the only place I get my groceries from. The selection of things is so huge it's even hard to find things sometimes. I love that the produce section is HUGE and they even have a selection of organic and farmer produce. The staff is very nice too and it was a pleasure to see them excited and smiling after the store reopened. Another thing that shows how great ShopRite is: during the renovation after sandy no one lost their job. How cool is that?
2013-05-26,5,This ShopRite is amazing. Okay so I have pretty low standards. I just moved from Astoria and had to deal with small, dirty, crappy NYC groceries for the past 5 years. What a difference this ShopRite is. Basically, this ShopRite is the same size as the typical grocery stores you'd find in the suburbs. Also, prices are anywhere between 10-40% lower than your typical NYC grocery store. It's super-clean and offers a great selection of products.I still drive up to Trader Joe's in Edgewater once a month for cheaper organic products but ShopRite is my day to day grocery store since I live just a few blocks away. The selection at the liquor store is also pretty amazing and prices are pretty good too. I really can't say anything bad about this ShopRite.
2013-03-25,1,And you have to go through the main entrance to get to the liquor store? No direct entry for it? That's an extra four blocks...up, to the booze, back, and back down the street. Good selection of single bottles/cans of craft beers.
2013-02-25,2,Glad to finally have this location open again post-Sandy. However, the Deli area is still AWFUL.  Yesterday I put in an automatic order for 1 lb of Roast Beef as soon as I entered the store.I shopped the store for 40 minutes, and STILL had to wait another 25 minutes after I finished shopping for my deli order.  That is ridiculous- over an hour for 1 order?!I like the new cases and expanded Gluten Free and organic areas, but the deli still needs a lot of work.  The people working the counter were moving at snail speed!
2013-02-16,1,DO NOT ORDER DELIVERYI've been waiting for hours, and when I called to inquire, I was put on hold and transferred for 25 minutes before learning my order STILL hasn't left the store. Just blew my afternoon.
2013-02-15,5,They are book with a much better appearance since the hurricane!I have to review their tiramisu!! I try this everywhere, this is my favorite desert and am often dissappointed. Shoprite in Hoboken is the one place that makes it perfectly to my liking and is NOT overpriced! So happy I can get it here and it is always delicious and cheap. YUM YUM YUM
2013-02-12,5,New and improved post Sandy! They gutted, rearranged, and adapted it for the evolving population of Hoboken. The organic natural foods are more prominent and integrated into the store. Expanded gluten free selections. And you can still get your Goya and religious candles too!Makes you wonder about the stores that didn't do the same...
2013-02-10,1,THIS REVIEW IS FOR SHOP RITE'S HOME DELIVERY IN HOBOKENI used ShopRite's home delivery for the first time today. I ordered online and then was expecting delivery today between 12-2 pm.  By 2:15, no delivery and no phone calls alerting me that they would be late. I called them 3 times... spent time on hold and found out they had my order out, but forgot bags, so didn't actually deliver it to me until 3 pm.  Then I realized that they were missing items they charged me for... and also didn't include (or charge) me for items I ordered.  I approved "substitutions" and my receipt said they were out of the wheat bread and 1% milk I ordered but they didn't substitute.  Really??? No other wheat bread or 1% milk in all of ShopRite??  And the items they charged me for and didn't bring... I called and they were supposed to bring over at 8 pm.  It's 9:30 pm.  No delivery.DO NOT USE SHOPRITE HOME DELIVERY... Use PeaPod... or anything, anything but ShopRite. NOTE: I know they just re-opended yesterday, but this experience was ridiculous!
2013-02-09,5,I was happy to see them open after their closure post - Sandy.  They have this whole organic section in the front now when you enter the store (as opposed to the back corner) and their muffins are so dangerous.  Their chocolate chip, piscachio, and chocolate chocolate chip are normally excellent.  :P
2013-02-09,5,It's back and better than ever! After total decimation by Sandy, ShopRite re-opened on the morning after a blizzard--irony or coincidence?A big comparison shopper, I'm a fan of ShopRite as its prices regularly beat Pathmark and A&P as well as Target (which always beats Bed & Bath/Harmon).The actual shelves themselves are different than they used to be with brown (wood) tops.  A lot of the areas which had open refrigeration cases have been replaced with doors; the deli area and dairy cases specifically.I was blown away (I couldn't stop saying, "WOW!") by the increase of items which could be found at competitors in the area specifically:-Socks, underwear, slippers: Target-Snow removal, car related items: Target, Home Depot, Pep Boys-Baking utensils: Target, Bed & Bath-Bedding  & home storage: Target, Bed & Bath-Higher end hair products: Ricky's, Harmon (Bed & Bath)It seems as if they've taken the opportunity to rework the layout and add a few sections.  A few examples:-What sat at the ends of some aisles now sit at the beginning of the aisles: organic produce and baby toiletries are just 2 examples. -Added refrigerated sections for gluten free, natural and organic.-Cookies were on one aisle; candy on another.  Now they're on the same aisle (which feels smaller than all the rest) and is one of the last in the store--they're making you go through the whole store to get your sugar fix!-International foods in the frozen section have been consolidated as the shelf items. Mexican and Asian foods were on an aisle in the middle in the store; Botanica, British and Jewish items were on one of the last aisles in the store. -Soda was on one aisle toward the back of the store; water was one of the last.  They've now been consolidated.As in the past, there's a huge (by Hoboken standards) parking lot.  They now have a ton of brand new shopping carts and have added areas to consolidate them in the parking lot.Happy Shopping!
2012-12-23,5,I deeply miss shop rite, I'm glad their opening soon, getting tired of shopping at a&p aspen marketplace, and kings....
2012-10-21,3,Ok so here's a more detailed update.  Produce here is pretty bad.  There is very little selection and a lot of has been out too long.  Trying to find an onion I would actually eat was a chore, and the flies didn't help.  Things like string beans are hard to pick out too.That being said, all of the other items for sale are top notch and priced very well.  Having a liquor store inside helps too.
2012-09-22,5,All time fav! They have EVERYTHING u could possibly want. And an amazing liquor selection. This place is ginormous!! And very clean :)
2012-09-10,1,This review is specifically for the online department of this location. If anyone is thinking of placing an online order, think otherwise. Even starving might turn out to be a better option compared to the online ordering experience.I had ordered some detergent, vegetables, reduced fat milk and low fat yogurt. Detergent came ok. Vegetables were missing entirely. Milk delivered was fat free and the yogurt delivered was whole fat. Called up, complained and was told all drivers had left for the day. Got nothing till the next day afternoon. Veggies came in but still no replacement milk and yogurt. Called again and again all drivers had disappeared. Am still waiting for the milk and yogurt.If the sun rises on the right side tomorrow, I will receive the right type of milk and yogurt but this has been a harrowing experience already. Undoubtedly the last time I've placed an online order with Shoprite Hoboken
2012-07-03,5,Very clean and organized.  The employees are very kind and helpful.  The store is very well stocked.  The nice big parking lot is a plus!!!
2012-06-24,2,Pro's - lots of parking, cleaner than the JC shoprite, sale items, liquor sectionCons - rude, lazy staff at register, organic produce doesn't last long (not sure about others), not all items have price labeled in the section, wait time, most cashiers have a zillion tattoos (the rule should be it needs to be covered while at work!) and it grosses me out.
2012-06-05,4,what a relief in comparison with the shop rites in bayonne, jersey city, and stirling, new jersey. this store is clean. most of its patrons look well-dressed and cultured, as opposed to sullen and slovenly, which is a big plus. the cashiers are very friendly. the produce is better than surrounding shop rites, but you're still better off going to some korean vegetable store. old-time hoboken uncle guido types bring back memories of the city before the 70's. this store is a real gem!
2012-05-23,4,This one beats the pants off of Marin Blvd. They have a good organic food section. I think they are lacking in the arabic food, heavier on british and spanish ethnic options. Produce section totally blows but I am coming to accept that from grocery stores in general. They could at least spray down the greens once in awhile...Otherwise, it's clean, convenient, good parking lot, lots of carts available, helpful employees. I am a regular and plan to stay!
2012-05-22,4,CLEAN AND ORGANIZEDOverall, its a nice weekly experience.  The cashiers are competent, and the deli does a satisfactory job.   Their best aspect is the customer service. Running into a few issues over the year, they are always willing to help.  That goes a long way in my book.
2012-05-09,3,Meh. It's convenient, and they have most things you're looking for, but their organic section is weak and their produce never stays fresh very long. Get a self check-out here and I'll be happy as a clam at high tide.
2012-04-06,3,Really good supermarket. They really do have everything you need. Plus, there's shop rite liquors right in the same building. Doesn't get any better. Well, they could have more sale items. Maybe if there were some more competition, they would be forced to have more sales.
2012-03-28,4,If you live in Hoboken / Jersey City, then this is the only real supermarket. Food prices are not jacked like you see everywhere else - ie, A&P, Kings, or any of the smaller markets. Also, their liquor store has a very good beer selection and sometimes you can get better deals than Sparrows.
2012-03-26,3,I have to say Shop Rite is somewhat dirty, the cashiers can be rude and make me do half their job for them, and there are trashy aspects to it such as the ability to purchase many electronics items. But they have great sales and their every day prices really aren't bad. And it is huge. I do feel lucky to have it in my neighborhood!
2012-03-25,4,I haven't been here in...I want to say five years...but returned this Saturday. it's right by where some of my friends live, and I decided it was necessary to buy MORE beer for our impending 12-hour movie marathon (with custom drinking rules).the aisles are clean and well-organized.the liquor store is good here. fantastic selection and they even had a tasting of wines from Portugal this Saturday with some food!oh, yeah - they have Innis & Gunn rum cask beer in large bottles. you're welcome.
2012-02-13,2,Overpriced (since its in hoboken) and smaller. I confused this address for the one of marin av in downtown JC (which has a BJ's right next to it). It's not as big as the other shoprites but they have what you'll need but you'll need but you'll be paying more for location.
2011-07-20,1,Shoprite in Hoboken is one of the worst businesses that I've ever met.  I have been using online shopping and going in the store for the last 4 years and most of the time, I tend to let it go.  I make enough money to lose $10..20 here and there with missing groceries over the years.. Today, I had it.  They skimp me out of a whole bag of produce (worth $25).  Five hours later, I am still missing all that grocery.   So, I suggest you try NOT TO use shoprite if you can help it.  The store manager did not even want to apologize for his employees and hung up on me when I asked him what sort of operation he was running.  Sensitive much, dude?  Perhaps, he was out sick the day when they taught him the first rule of business: CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT! or the second rule of business: WHEN YOU TAKE SOMEONE'S MONEY, YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO GIVE 'EM THE GOODS.They are never getting my business again, that's for sure.
2011-07-06,3,Four blocks from my apartment, and they carry everything. I used to split my purchases between Wegman's and ShopRite when I lived in Monmouth county, so I'm very familiar with this ShopRites as a whole.The only thing I DESPISE is the (usually) rude cashiers and stupid wait times to check out. *WHY* don't they have a self check out yet?!However, some of the clientele are less than friendly as well, so I guess I can understand.You can also order online for home delivery, but the delivery charge is outrageous.
2011-03-06,4,This was a block away from my girl's apartment when she went to college here in Hoboken.  This Shoprite is huge.  This has to be a heaven sent place for shoppers.  So convenient, large parking lot, friendly staff, and my favorite of all, super clean.I am definitely a fan, especially since I can pick up liquor in their alcohol department.  This made me a favorite visitor in my girl's 4 room apartment.  Whenever they would have a party, I would just drop by this Shoprite and buy what I need. Never had to worry about anything.
2010-11-14,5,When I moved to Hoboken, I thought that there would be no giant supermarkets in this little city... I was totally wrong!  There is this awesome entity called ShopRite that is right off the 9th Street Light Rail station!  After a few weeks of shopping at the tiny bodegas on Washington Street (and the overpriced Garden of Eden), I was literally astounded by how much room is in this ShopRite.  Once you go ShopRite, you can never go back...The prices are pretty decent, way cheaper than a lot of the grocery items at CVS and Garden of Eden, where I Was doing most of my shopping before I discovered ShopRite... they even have a section for supplies like tape measure and sewing needles, and clothes hangers, which is great because I had no idea where else to get these kinds of things besides Target (or overpriced CVS).  I really enjoy walking up the "Seasonal" aisle with all this random stuff that you think should not be in a supermarket, but in fact, is.Fruit seems pretty fresh.  I've been satisfied with the apples that I get from there, along with some of the other vegetables that my friends and I use for cooking.Other perks: Vast dairy selection, the liquor room looks pretty big...What else is there to say about this cool super market?  If you have a car, there is a huge parking lot, and if you don't, there's always the light rail. Don't forget your ShopRite card because that's where you get a lot of the savings.
2010-09-26,3,I do most of my grocery shopping here.  The prices are excellent, and they double all coupons under $1.00.  The people who work here are way better than the employees at the A&P in town. My only quip is that I wish Hoboken had a World Class Shoprite, like the ones in Central Jersey! Also, they tend to run out of things on Sundays, when the sales for the week start.
2010-07-24,4,Shop Rite is like a little taste of suburban heaven without actually having to live in the suburbs. I am a 5-minute walk from A&P and gladly make the 15-minute trek to Shop Rite. Their produce section is large and the food fresh. Overall, their prices and selection are far better than the aforementioned A&P. My only complaint is that Shop Rite often requires you to buy multiples of items in order to get a deal. This is not conducive to apartment living, especially for a single person.
2010-06-07,4,A&P bows down to Shop Rite. They have a giant parking lot where you can always find a spot. Great prices, huge selection, and the bakery section is pretty legit.Don't forget to bring your bonus card for the extra savings yuppies!
2009-12-06,4,Large selection, good service .. my go to place for groceries. 1. They have a parking lot 2. They deliver 3. They have a liquor department (decent selection)4. The Goya section is pretty big -  This is where I discovered the Sweetened Condensed Milk in a tube .. YES IT IS AMAZING!!5. They also carry Flank Steak .. why this is so hard to find near Hoboken I have no idea.
2009-02-27,5,Why would anyone review a supermarket?  Because this is a story that must be told!  The people need to know!I've been a loyal customer to SR my entire life and have been going to this location for 2 years.  When my roommate, Dan "D-Boy" R. (yelp.com/user_details?us...), would come home and tell me about the deals and sales at A&P, I began to question my own allegiance.Then, I get a call at work.  It's a computer.  A Shop Rite computer.  Apparently I bought some Lean Cuisines (I know I know.  Pretty freakin lame) that had glass in the food and were being recalled.  They called me because my trusty Price Plus card tipped them off that I had bought these items and I shouldnt eat them and could return them (with or without receipt) for cash.I'm sorry I almost left you Shop Rite.  We were meant for eachother, and deep down, I knew it all along.
2007-12-13,4,The only full-size supermarket in Hoboken. When I first moved here the only markets were a pint-sized A&P on 7th St. and an over-priced King's by the Shipyard. Clean inside, good parking, nice produce section (not Whole Foods but good), a bakery and a connected full on liquor store. There's a pharmacy and a bank (Northfork I think) inside as well.Wheelchair Access: Good parking, wide aisles, ramp to liquor store.
2007-10-22,4,I love this Shoprite.  It is literally the largest supermarket I have ever been to .  Sure it takes a while to shop around, but the selection is incredible.  The prices are very reasonable, and they have a large private parking lot.  There is also an affordable liquor store attached that offers a wide selection of alcohol.  However, I did go there this past weekend and slipped in a large, unmarked puddle of water, bruising my whole right side.  The manager was nice and took my information, apologizing profusely, but I am still bitter about it.  Having to spend the rest of my shopping trip with wet pants is not something I would wish on anyone...
2007-07-31,4,Why do they call it Shoprite if you can't even Shop right? Just kidding- this one is usually well stocked and not as crazy packed with people as the one in North Bergen. A HUGE plus in Hoboken is the big parking lot, halleluja!
2007-04-13,3,I never thought I'd be reviewing a Supermarket. Having lived in Manhattan for almost 20 years I'd forgotten what it's like to have a 'real' Supermarket nearby. I still do most of shopping at local specialty shops here and in NYC but there's something to be said for a well stocked Supermarket. There's a pretty good Produce section though the Organic area is a little mangy. I've never used the Deli area because there's always a ridiculous wait. The Meat department is OK and I'll buy if I can't get to my butcher in the city. My favorite thing here is the selection of D'Artagnan products; Duck Breast (smoked or fresh), Foie Gras, Demi Glaces, and an array of Sausages (my favorite Chorizo).The liquor store is surprisingly good with some knowledgeable and helpful staff to boot. They also offer online shopping and delivery which I've not tried.
