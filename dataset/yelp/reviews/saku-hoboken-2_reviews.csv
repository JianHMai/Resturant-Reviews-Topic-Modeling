2021-10-31,5,Saku has become a second home. It's right across the street but I'd walk from anywhere to have dinner here. Hands down best sushi in Hoboken and best service of any restaurant or bar in Hoboken. Karina and Jlo are the best! And make us feel like family whenever we visit. Between the lychee martinis, fresh fish and being surrounded by the best people - this is my favorite restaurant in Hoboken
2021-10-29,5,I just want to say, Karina, the host saved the night!  She was the only reason I ate dinner last night!  The food was amazing the staff was very attentive. I will 100% be going back and I hope to see Karina every time!
2021-10-22,5,Wonderful atmosphere. Perfect for a date night. Service is excellent and the food is amazing. Fresh seafood and ingredients.Special shout-out to our server Karina for her wonderful service!
2021-10-20,5,We absolutely love saku! We always have an amazing meal, the atmosphere is perfect and the cocktails are great! It's honestly the best sushi in town, along with having the great atmosphere and cocktails which you never find at a regular sushi place ... We love that the speciality rolls sometimes change as well because it makes us try new ones. But the crispy rice & gyoza are always our favorite apps! Always love recommending saku!
2021-10-15,4,Good sushi and good drinks! The Japanese roulette roll was a lot of fun to try, as 2 of the 8 rolls have a hot pepper in them. 4/5 stars as we tried the tuna appetizer and tasted like canned tuna. Otherwise a good experience!
2021-10-14,5,Amazing! Food was great and ambiance was awesome. Andre was a fabulous waiter - very friendly and attentive!! We will be back!!!
2021-10-12,3,The sushi here is alittle gimmicky. Caters to the younger vibe. Restaurant itself is beautifully decorated and cute place for a date. However this place is more flavor on flavor on flavor, which Is a bit much for me.We started with the garlic edamame. Good heat but the edamame was over cooked, not to my liking.Then we shared three rolls:Drop it like it's hot: my favorite. Spicy tuna and salmon with fresh jalapeño. Drunk crunch roll: also good, lots of fish in itSaku: had sweet mango drizzle which I was not a fan.They gave so little wasabi and ginger. Like the tiniest amount so you have to ask for extra.Overall, fine. Would like to explore further elsewhere before coming back. Cute restaurant though
2021-10-10,1,Came with extremely high hopes given the positive feedback but was sorely disappointed!To start off the experience my husband and I walked in early on a Friday evening a little before 5:00 pm, hopeful this would be our go-to sushi spot given our proximity to this place. We requested an outdoor seat. There was only one other party just seated at the otherwise entirely empty outdoor area. When checking in with the hostess, she asked if we had a reservation with a doubtful undertone of sounding as if she could not seat us without one. Upon informing her we did not, she and the other hostess peeked outside at the empty tables staring back at them, whispered to each other, and offered to seat us with a warning that we would be under a time limit given later reservations. Her message was understandable but her tone was undeniably unwelcoming. We acquiesced and were seated swiftly.Our waiter was a little stuffy and continued the theme of being not-too-welcoming, yet was attentive enough. We ordered the highly-raved shrimp gyoza, pan fried, and several rolls of sushi.When the gyoza came out it looked delicious until we took a bite: RAW shrimp. The dumpling skin was hot and practically burnt on the bottom but the inside was totally cold. The shrimp filling was clearly still translucent and grey, not a cooked-orange - chopped raw shrimp mixed with green onion. We promptly sent it back.They apologized and sent us another plate, this time the insides were *just* cooked through - could have preferred another minute - and the bottoms now quite burnt. This indicates whoever is cooking in the back did not steam the gyoza long enough while turning down the heat so as to allow the bottoms to not overcook. But they tried. And at least it was edible.The sushi that followed was beautifully presented with flowers, but had a fishy taste. We could not finish our order, especially after the raw gyoza experience and feeling concerned about the food safety of the kitchen (and how our night was going to go -- luckily, we ended up being ok).For the raw incident, high price, and stuffiness of service, we are left with no reason to return unfortunately even though this is practically downstairs for us. The only positives here are a) the lovely presentation and aesthetics - pretty arrangements and plateware with fresh flowers; and b) a creative menu - not authentic but more fusion and smartly caters to the Hoboken demographic.It is clear that the menu concepts and visual presentation are thoughtfully curated. Tragically however, the execution and quality are lacking -- and that is especially unforgiving when we're talking about sushi.
2021-10-02,5,Always make a reservation! The wait is long if you do walk in. There is a great selection of hot/cold apps. Would highly recommend the yellowtail jalapeño cold app and shishito peppers hot app.  They are very gluten free friendly and can modify most menu items - they also have gluten free soy sauce.
2021-10-01,3,I was craving the best sushi in Hoboken and Yelp led me to this place. I ordered take-out and thought the menu looked great. We ordered two rolls and chicken fried rice for a whopping $45. I expected the rolls to be great and they were very average for that price and lacked taste. The fried rice was ok but for $15 dollars I expected more. Sticking to Domodomo for my sushi from now on.
2021-09-30,2,Food was way overpriced and not the best sushi. I was also brought a drink $18 more expensive than the one I ordered after they told me the one i ordered was out and they charged me for it.
2021-09-21,3,Its ok at best: we have had it a couple of times. Wish it was better tbh. Food is never really that tasty and the hot food is just ok. Overall experience us just ok i would say.
2021-09-14,5,The best service ever .... The staff is always very attentive...... best lobster egg-rolls in Hoboken...
2021-09-01,4,Quality sushi and good drinks. This is a great date night spot and sushi is always fresh and interesting! Atmosphere is super cute and service is great!
2021-08-26,1,No on answered phone when we called earlier.  Place is highly recommended but they keep empty tables for an hour under "reservations only" guise. How can you make a reservation when they don't answer phone and they admit to internet problem?Hate to miss food that sounds so good but they don't seem to want more business
2021-08-23,5,My boyfriend and I had been to Saku during its opening week (two or so years ago), and had a flawed ordeal.  They have since more than gotten their act together and offer one of the best dining experiences in Hoboken.Our recent visit had us seated in the gorgeous main dining with paintings of cherry blossoms adorning its white walls.  Our server, Karina, was a gem!  The poor woman was handling the full room on her own, but she never lost her smile and pleasant demeanor.  Her recommendations were also terrific.Saku offered an extensive beverage list, including sakes, whiskies, and much more, but their custom cocktails were the main appeal.  I followed Karina's advice and went with the Jalapeño Business, a curious blend of tequila, blueberry mint syrup, ginger syrup, lime, jalapeño, and ginger bitters.  As she mentioned, I really did not taste an overwhelming amount of any of these flavors; they all just meshed well together into a drink that was a little smokey, a little sweet, a little spicy, and a lot refreshing.  My boyfriend's Saku Old Fashioned was an elevated version of the original, utilizing Four Roses Bourbon, St. Germain Elderflower liqueur, Angostura and orange bitters, all garnished with an orange peel and a sprig of thyme.  It was not overly sweet, but carried hints of citrus and flowers.  We were starving at the time, so we decided to start off with some appetizers.  The Garlic Edamame was as unique as it sounded with the soybean pods being sautéed in a chili garlic sauce.  They were messy, spicy, and packed a substantial kick.  In fact, you could think of them as a healthy alternative to chicken wings.  The Steak Tataki appetizer was another winner.  The 8 pieces of sliced, seared steak were marinated in a white truffle oil and a Wasabi dressing.  The meat was garnished with cucumber, scallions, and mounds of tobiko (salmon roe).  The steak was lean and tender, and the sauce was delicious.  From there, I decided to opt for 2 sushi rolls for my main course.  The traditional Eel and Avocado Roll had the perfect amount of sweet sauce.  The specialty Saku Roll had been shaped into teardrops and plated to look like halves of a heart.  Pink soy paper encased sushi rice, which had been stuffed with salmon, seaweed salad, kani/crabstick, cucumber, avocado, mango, and crunch morsels.  It was topped with a bright red, sweet chili sauce.  Both rolls were extremely fresh and possessed the ideal textures.  My boyfriend's Drunken Noodles was definitely more Japanese-styled than the traditional Thai version.  It included udon noodles, sliced chicken, crushed chili pepper, various vegetables, and Thai Basil all sautéed in a spicy sauce.  The dish could not have been any better, and the substitution of the udon noodles for the standard rice noodles actually worked well.Despite our initial problematic voyage to Saku years ago, we were glad we gave it another shot and are now huge fans!
2021-08-20,5,Best sushi I've had in Hoboken, Everything tasted so fresh. Service was great and very fast. Perfect place to go on a date or out with friends! Can't wait to go back!
2021-08-18,5,This place is just SO good, inventive, creative and packed full of flavor!! Not your typical sushi place and I mean that in the BEST way! Oh and on top of amazing food - their cocktails are on point!!
2021-07-29,5,Cocktails are the best in Hoboken. Sushi and sashimi are just out of this world . The specials are amazing. Everything is crafted with love.
2021-07-18,5,So yummy! Sat outside, we were completely covered when it rained. Service was excellent no complaints
2021-07-15,5,Food is spectacular and a fun twist on sushi/ asian cuisine. Though the food is so good, sometimes I go just because I crave the atmosphere. Super cute and always very lively.
2021-07-07,4,About half full on a Tuesday evening, a really cute sushi restaurant. Lovely interior decorations, not too dimly lit. Moderately priced as well. Ordered a spicy shrimp tempura for myself and a shrimp tempura for my sister and pretty sure neither was spicy but I didn't correct them. Food was delicious definitely. People were dressed in a range, some dressed up for a nice night some in very casual clothes so do whatever you want!! I would definitely go back
2021-07-03,2,The service was terrible yall.MOODA real cute place. There's fake flowers hanging from the ceiling and nice warm lighting inside. Big date vibes. Too bad the service didn't match :/FOODFood was decent! I'd give 4/5 if it weren't for the service. We only got rolls, which tended to be on the smaller side. One of us got the beet roll and it was kinda like a Vietnamese spring roll minus any meat. We also got the Shishito bombs to start and it came in a huge portion tbh. The three of us couldn't even finish it hahaha. They were 3/5. It was the spicy mayo that made it.'TUDEAll right... Food took 5EVER to come. We got our appetizers pretty late and the sushi took a looooong time... so I asked "Where's our sushi?" and the waitress said "Oh we were waiting for you guys to finish the appetizer." Huuuuhhh?? Sis it was huge. And I'd expect them to ask us whether we wanted to eat everything separately. Whatever. So there were a few times after where we really had to WAVE DOWN someone to help us. They also have an extra credit card charge 2.99%. If you pay cash or debit it's waived though. But we paid debit and they didn't waive it... and yardi know it took ages to have them come correct it. Oh and at the end, some workers were lounging in the exit and hella blocking the way out. They just looked at me when I asked to get through. Bro what...
2021-06-30,2,Definitely picture friendly. Instagram worthy definitely but the food was mediocre. I've had better sushi in other places.
2021-06-27,1,The service and the interior decor was positive. Food is subpar - probably one of the worst sushi rolls and dishes we had in years. I don't know how this place has 3+ star rating which misled us to come here for a weekend dinner. Are people just drinking a lot of cocktail before dinner and are numb to heightened appetite?!  ordered the following: * shrimp fried rice (needs to be seasoned better; very bland)* chicken drunken noodle (very soy-saucy and not much depth to the flavors. It's...not drunk noodle by any authentic means), * shishito peppers (mix of unevenly charred and uncooked peppers, and brown sugars sprinkled about in disarray manner. Just because you add purple flower to every dish to make it visually appealing doesn't make it delicious) * shrimp tempura: one bite and it was very evident the shrimp tempura had been frozen, thawed, and not throughly cooked. It was also rancid and old-- they were very polite in taking it back and not charging us for this * blue crab with beef roll: it was edible but smells musty...rolled the dice if we'd get sick or not later that day * eel avocado: ratio of rice to ingredient is about 1:1.  Really underwhelming flavors. Also--Don't expect the rice roll to be cooked as it should. Rice is hard and sometimes crunchy. Such a shame for a decent looking establishment to be serving dishes that are not a proud representation of Japanese cuisine. It was also way overpriced for their lack of quality of ingredients compared to other establishments in Jersey City (i.e, Domo Domo) We walked out of Saku vowing to never come back.
2021-06-24,5,Went there on a random day. The appetizers were amazing. The bang bang shrimp - fire! The drunken noodle didn't get me drunk but they were very solid! The rolls were nice. The shrimp tempura special roll was the star. Cocktails were on point and Diet Coke was as well!I was pleasantly surprised!
2021-06-13,1,Have been a few times, each with the same experience as the last. Slow, inattentive service, and overpriced food/ drinks. $25 for a large sake (approx 8 shots per carafe), a shrimp tempura roll for $13 came as a singular shrimp tempura wrapped in rice with seaweed cut into six small pieces (no eel sauce, avocado, cucumber, tobiko). Our Surf and Turf roll came almost 40 minutes after ordering, and my spicy blue crab roll came as a plain Kani roll, we ordered two carafes of Sake, the first arriving 20 minutes after ordering and the second 30. The restaurant itself is beautiful which is a shame. Sushi Lounge is a much better option, comparably.
2021-06-12,5,I walk by all the time but finally had an opportunity to go for dinner. Started with cocktails - Momos & Cream is so delicious....I'm sure full of calories and fat but so worth it!! Food was delicious and service very fast (without feeling rushed) and friendly. Can't wait to go back again soon!
2021-06-08,4,Delicious food and appetizers. Amazing cocktails and great service. The sushi was just ok so I wouldn't recommend sushi here. Highly recommend the lobster egg roll- super delicious! Wish we ordered two of them! For main course, I would highly recommend the Kobe Bryan burger. Their cocktails were AMAZING! I loved the herbs and roses cocktail. It's not too sweet and very refreshing. Good for summer!!
2021-06-06,1,The drink got super diluted and it tasted like flavored water. Won't order alcohol here again .
2021-05-29,2,Came here for the gluten free options and it was just ok. We got the surf and turf, drop it like it's hot, and sweet potato rolls. All lacked any depth of flavor. The surf and turf steak was barely seared and tasted old. The drop it like it's hot lacked spice and was generally tasteless. The sweet potato roll , just tasted like a plain smushy sweet potato. Not sure if this is how it always is or if flavors are omitted due to gluten free. Overall not impressed.
2021-05-23,5,The ambiance and drinks are fantastic! We tried a good variety- herbs & roses was a little too tart but rose colored glasses was amazing!! It was perfect light, airy, and refreshing! That's my jam was also delicious!! We also go the edamame and an avocado cucumber roll.  Definitely want to try the drunk noodles and the cauliflower next time!
2021-05-21,5,Best best best in Hoboken for sushi!Best service, quality, and overall experience was amazing. High recommend this place!
2021-05-20,5,Beautiful setting, great food (there are great vegetarian options!), and such a fun friendly staff. My go to reccomendation in Hoboken
2021-05-11,5,PROS:-Really great decor and vibes, such a cute and intimate date spot-Outdoor seating available-Wide selection of specialty cocktails and beautiful plating-Group of 6 seated quickly and easily on a busy night. They squeezed us in right before a dinner rush. Great service.CONS:-Pricey, even for basic rolls-Credit card processing fee for 2.99% and 20% gratuity on tables over 5 peopleI didn't order a lot for fear of spending too much. I really enjoyed the little bit that we got though, but I probably shouldn't eat in Hoboken on a budget!
2021-05-11,1,I thought I was going to like this place because of all the good reviews. The location is beautiful but the food was atrocious. We ordered the lobster egg roll and surf and turf sushi..  I asked the waitress if there was any short of Mayo sauce or cream cheese in any of these things and she said no. I told her please make sure because we do not like either of these things. She brought us both dishes and there was mayo in both of them. The lobster egg roll had Mayo inside and drizzled on top, and the surf and turf had Mayo mixed into the crab meat. We where so grossed out as we DO NOT LIKE MAYO.  They should have options without Mayo.   We then ordered shrimp  gyoza and chicken fried rice. Both of these things were disgusting and tasted like they came out of a frozen bag.  The rice was soggy and it was not fried you can tell it was frozen. I forgot to mention we also ordered the shrimp tempura roll and it was literally only one piece of shrimp tempura inside and nothing else. This was the worst sushi I've had EVER. My boyfriend never complains about food but he was so grossed out by this place. Seriously disappointed. We left there and had to go eat somewhere else as we where still hungry. And the bill was expensive for such low grade food.
2021-05-10,4,A little expensive compared to other local sushi spots but the cocktails and creative menu make it worth it! Not to mention the place is adorable inside! I usually order off the special menu because they come up with some great seasonal items. The Bees Knees cocktail with Corgi Earl Grey Gin is not to be missed! The I Like Big Butter and I Cannot Lie roll and Drop it Like it's Hot rolls are my favorites on the regular menu.
2021-05-08,5,Not only one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken but truly the beat sushi I've ever had. Drinks are incredible - make sure to get the already made sake bombs, you won't regret it. Lobster egg roll is incredible as an app. The specialty rolls are out of this world - my favorites are the surf and turf, drop it like it's hot and dude where's my roll. Can not recommend the surf and turf more though! Even the regular rolls are absolutely incredible. I've had the same server both times I've been here and she is amazing. Seriously can't recommend this place more!!
2021-05-07,5,This was super cute and fun spot! I came here last Friday with my girlfriends and we loved it! We got a variety of the specialty rolls and cocktails. My favorite was the Crunch Drunk Love. The Bang Bang shrimp was also really yummy! There were so many options for drinks and sake. I ended up going with the Champagne Problems but my friends Herbs N Roses was honestly the best. We also decided to do sake bombs which were super fun despite me forgetting how to chug a drink  Another fun item on their menu was the Japanese Jeopardy 2.0. There are 2 pieces that have Carolina reaper hot sauce so whomever ends up with it, has to take the sake shots that came with the dish. We left the restaurant pretty lit after that. I definitely recommend this place for a fun date night! I will certainly be back. The aesthetic and decor is also great for pictures!
2021-05-05,5,Had such a lovely experience here. During the week, was busy for dinner rush. The drinks are INCREDIBLE and the food is also amazing. Large portions, good service. My only complaint is that it is a bit pricey, but as to be expected for the quality of the food. Can't wait to return!
2021-04-25,4,Going to saku is a culinary experience! The restaurant is so beautiful. The ceiling is covered in cherry blossoms and the walls are elegantly painted.  The food presentation was well done. My husband is not a fan of cauliflower but he was a fan of the crispy cauliflower that I had ordered. The sushi was absolutely delicious. The restaurant had many choices of cocktails and were a great complement to the sushi. The restaurant was a bit pricy but I think it's completely worth the visual & culinary experience for a special occasion.
2021-04-24,4,Sushi is great but very pricey. Not sure it's worth the premium for me.  They do have a nice set up and some interesting items on the menu.
2021-04-21,5,I came here awhile back when it was still chilly out and the only thing to keep us warm dining outside was lots of saki.I had dinner here with a friend I hadn't seen in a longgggg time and this was the perfect spot to order a ton of food and catch up. We ordered *inhales* Spicy Tuna Gyoza, Drunken Noodles, Shrimp Shumai, Spicy Tuna and Eel Avocado Rolls *exhales.Everything was so wonderful. The drunken noodles were by far my favorite and oh my gosh the portion was gigantic. The sushi was also spectacular and very fresh with a great fish/rice ratio. It was A LOT of food and we couldn't finish it all but they were able to box up the leftovers no problem. Our waiter was really kind and service was super quick. We sat out in their heated parklet, which was at times not very heated, but did the trick and had a great dinner! We also got two bottles (but not bottles? It came in a carafe of some kind. It was warm and delicious and I never get saki but it was just what we needed.I can't wait to come back and see the inside. This is a perfect spot for a special date night or just a nice dinner out in Hoboken.
2021-03-28,5,One of the best bougie restaurants I've ever been to granted that I haven't been to many. I went with my friends and we had an amazing experience. They check your temperature when you come in and the seating was a breeze. We never waited a noticeably long time for any services. Waiters constantly come up to your table to fill your water glasses if they see they're running low. Every waiter was enthusiastic and in a good mood, especially one that liked to joke around. Short story: I asked a waiter where the bathroom was and he told me an extensive list of instructions that visibly confused me and then he laughed and said he was joking before telling me it was actually just around the corner. Although I wish there were more vegan options, the Just Beet It Roll almost makes the lack of vegan items passable. It was DELICIOUS and this is coming from someone who's been to Beyond Sushi in NYC. The sushi I had there pales in comparison to the roll I ordered. Definitely worth the $13. We ordered plan edamame to eat while the food got there and it was scrumptious. My friends loved their food as well and they got the shrimp tempura roll and gyoza. The decor is phenomenal and the vibes are just right. The service is unmatched and I was surprised at how coordinated the staff were. One of the waiters dropped a plate by accident and before my table could process what happened, about four other waiters came out of nowhere and got to cleaning up the pieces with a broom and scooper. Please visit Saku if you ever get the chance. I hope I get to go back soon regardless of the ~40 min drive from where I live!
2021-03-27,5,This cocktail and sushi spot is exactly what Hoboken needed!!  I am so obsessed with the vibes In that place.  The drinks were top of the line as were the beautiful sushi rolls.  A little pricey, but with this you get what you pay for.  You're going to want to get your phones ready because the presentation was top tier as well.  I will 100000% be coming back and recommending it to everyone who asks about places to stop at in Hoboken.  Phenomenal!!
2021-03-25,4,Nice decor, especially on the right side of the restaurant, very extensive drink menu (if you are New Jersian, you'd know how rare this is), service was great and food quality was pretty good as well.  The only complaint is the noise level but I know there is not much that restaurant can do about it.  I'm sure this wouldn't have been the case if we had showed up during weeknight We'd come back - definitely this would make a nice neighborhood date spot.
2021-03-15,2,It seems like they were understaffed last night. It took a while for our server to see us. It was my aunts birthday, so the bad service was a bit of a damper for the rest of dinner. Totally get it, though. The cauliflower was nothing to write home about, but the lobster egg roll was very good. The salmon sushi bowl was ok too. Nothing special. Tasted like a slightly above average poke bowl.
2021-03-08,3,Rice was slightly under-cooked.Do not have many hot food options.
2021-03-02,5,Perfect date night spot in hoboken! Amazing food and drinks. Highly recommend the margs and the special sushi rolls. The jeopardy roll was fun to get with a group! Great ambiance and great food for a fair price
2021-02-22,5,Let me start by saying I am not a fan of Asian food but after coming to this restaurant it truly gave me another perspective on Asian cuisine. The food here was so flavorful and delicious. Also the staff were all very nice and attentive and the decoration and atmosphere was a great touch to our experience eating there.
2021-02-21,5,So delish! Saku has the perfect menu/ambience for date night, girls night, friends gathering - you name it! Service was fabulous and our waters were constantly being refilled. It seriously didn't go unnoticed and the food was delicious! We made a YELP resi at 5:30pm since that was the only time we could get it but we were able to eat inside/safely in our own little section near the sushi bar. We ordered avocado Kani salad, bang bang shrimp gyoza, shrimp fried rice, crunch drunk love and the suku roll. Sushi was fresh and delicious and we really loved the gyoza. The rice was good but it was more like a hibachi style so I likely wouldn't order again but huge portions so perfect to share!!! I'll definitely be back, seriously loved the whole experience!!!
2021-02-20,5,Unlike other Sushi restaurants Ayame is very accommodating to its customers a big plus. It's Udom Noodle seafood dish is second to none especially on cold February nights. Along with its sushi dishes this is an satisfying way to full up your senses.
2021-02-18,5,Shishito Bombs are a must have and the drunken noodles were deff a fun try. Service was great but the ambiance was just beautiful. Deff a must try if you're in the area or not in the area, I drove from an hour away just to try this place and would deff do it again.
2021-01-30,3,Came after my best friend raved about this spot. My pre bday dinner and I was not too happy. We got placed on the black side on a high top by a door that was used to serve outdoor diners. Yesterday felt like -5 I was frozen while sitting there and not to mention the amount of ppl in that area during this time eeeeek!!!! Food was mediocre ( maybe an off night?) , service was prompt and very good, drinks need some work very blah ( coming from a former bartender) . I most likely won't be returning although decor is spot on.
2021-01-22,5,Their food and service is amazing! We went there for an early dinner. We dined inside. It was great.
2021-01-19,3,Had an interesting experience at Saku in Hoboken on a recent sunday evening...let me start by saying the food is FANTASTIC...the service, not so much. I made a reservation and we were sat in the light room when we arrived. I loved the decor and the environment right from the start and there were barricades to make you feel comfortable during COVID. The service started off great but then spiraled downward. We got some appetizers and then ordered 2 rolls at 7:45pm. When it was 8:30pm and our food didn't arrive and our drinks dry, we called down our waitress, who was confused that we didn't have our food and then disappeared once again. At 9pm we called down a different server (must have been a manger) that was appalled and delivered our rolls and another round of drinks and water. They took off 2 rounds of drinks (over $50) which was nice but for the upscale feel and pricey food, I expected better service...but as I said the food was AMAZING. Maybe next time i'll try takeout.
2021-01-18,5,I had an interesting experience here on Saturday night with a friend who is going through a stressful time. The staff bent over backwards, jumped through hoops, and did somersaults in midair to make this woman happy - I can honestly say I've never seen such amazing customer service. Plus the food was delicious - we had kung pao chicken gyoza, garlic edamame, omakase appetizer, seaweed salad, and a few rolls. The fish was fresh, and there was a perfect amount of rice/fish ratio on all the sushi. They also have a heated outdoor dining area for COVID times so you can feel safe and still get a night out. 5 stars for this new place, I hope it becomes a permanent fixture in Hoboken!
2021-01-09,5,Saku never disappoints. It's definitely our favorite sit down sushi restaurant in Hoboken. Drinks are delicious and sushi is well made and tasty. So many speciality rolls to choose from. Cant go wrong with appetizers either (lobster seaweed salad and tuna tartare were so good!). I don't remember the names of the specific rolls because we got a bunch and shared. I like all of them honestly but I'm a sushi lover. One of my friends is a little pickier with sushi and she was very happy also. My first time here was their opening Yelp event and I was so impressed with the decor but I thought they had done it just for the event. No they always have these adorable florals hanging from the ceiling on one side and the other side is darker and more intimate seeming (we've always been seated on the brighter side for some reason but I'm not complaining). It's hard to explain just go! Service was pretty good as well. Literally my only little complaint is that they added a credit card processing charge without telling us about it. That's pretty lame. I mean on a few hundred dollar bill 3% I think it was kinda adds up. For an upscale restaurant like this this just seems petty. It's not deterring me but it does make me question management and leave a little disappointed after a great experience otherwise.
2021-01-05,5,This was my first time in and I have to say I was blown away by the decor and the service was even better! My favorite dish was the lobster salad as it comes with almost an entire lobster on top of the kani! Great date spot or a place for some drinks with friends before hitting the town! Would recommend to anyone in Hoboken looking for the best sushi in town!
2020-12-21,5,Saku is one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken. To start, I love the pretty pink decor and trendy ambiance! However, the menu is really what steals the show. Their sushi is so good, but they also have plenty of other unique dishes if you aren't a sushi fan. My favorite thing on their menu is probably the He's Her Lobster roll (not just because of the Friends reference). For me, lobster sushi rolls can be hit or miss, but Saku's is always fresh! I haven't dined in since the start of COVID, but have gotten takeout and delivery a few times. As always, the food quality is never compromised.
2020-12-11,1,Made reservations 2 weeks in advance, drove over an hour, had to pay for parking and take an Uber, made it on time and was told there was only outdoor seating available in freezing December weather on my birthday. the woman told us you have to specify you want to sit inside. it's DECEMBER.. in New Jersey. Why would anyone making a reservation want to sit outside? That should be the special request. The staff was rude after we asked to be sat inside, the waiter didn't bring out the rolls we ordered and the sushi we did receive was mediocre at best. I've had better sushi for half the price.  needless to say I will never be back.  avoid this place at all costs.
2020-12-10,5,So tasty and beautiful decorations! A bit more expensive than otber sushi places in Hoboken but very much worth it!! I'd say eating there is better value for the price cause the ambiance is just gorgeous! Both the apps and the sushi were equally delicious!!
2020-11-23,3,I finally tried Saku this past Saturday night.  There was a little mix-up regarding my reservation - I made it on Yelp and requested outdoor seating in the notes.  An hour or so before our reservation, I got a call from the hostess confirming my reservation for indoors.  I explained we'd only dine if it was outdoors - my friends are not open to going inside - She made it seem like I messed up the reservation.  She also then explained how there would be no heating. Apparently the restaurant got in trouble recently for the outdoor tent they setup since it obstructed the sidewalk.  The town made them take it down.  It was very chilly and not ideal so I understand why she was trying to push us inside.  They are going to need to work out a new solution fast for their outdoor dining and invest in new space heaters and create a top to their streetery if they want to continue to have outdoor dining throughout the winter.  Our server was very friendly and did a great job answering our questions so it was everyone's first time there.  Two of us tried the fall sangria which was very good.  To start, we shared the bang bang shrimp gyoza and the cauliflower.  The cauliflower was really good and a big portion; the gyoza was good - the spice really comes from the sauce  and is most of its flavor.  I used the sauce on the cauliflower too.  Unfortunately my one friend has an avocado allergy so she was very limited on what she could eat off the specialty rolls menu since most contain avocado.  We decided to share for the table the Salmon Poke roll (no avocado) - pretty good and I am not a salmon lover.  Then my friend and I shared the Bacon Scallop special roll - I liked this one a lot, lots of bacon.  I had the Drop it Like it's Hot roll for myself-  it had little flavor and no heat.  My friend tried the Saku roll - I sampled a piece and it was okay.  We left very full.  I would say the sushi was average/good - but nothing blew my socks off.  It wouldn't be my go-to place for sushi take-out, but a good option for a date.  The inside is decorated very nicely, so I'd like to dine inside the next time if possible.  Out of 3 restaurants in Hoboken created by this owner, I'd rank this one last; Grand vin and touch the heart have better food.
2020-11-21,2,Had been there a few times pre-Covid, and was never super pleased. The sushi is passable (can get equal quality elsewhere), and some of there "fusion" dishes were acceptable (Drunken Noodles). We went if others had a res and invited us, but wouldn't choose it. Of note, cocktails were good, but not special enough for the price point. Post-Covid, it seems like they got a new chef. Hear me out: They literally have this generic chopped veggie mixture (peppers, onions) and syrupy soy glaze that they toss on their 'fried rice', 'drunken noodles', even as a topping for their 'Guac is Extra' roll. Like... I'm all for efficient mise en place, but at least try to differentiate your dishes? Legitimately, they recycle EVERYTHING in their kitchen (and it didn't used to be this way). Sushi is still decent, rolls are fresh and somewhat creative, but just look for a well-rated sushi restaurant in any town and you'll get the same. Also, we dined outside during one of the first sub-40 degree nights, which contributed to the direness of our latest visit. Note that we had a reservation, and were pretty much laughed at when we inquired about dining inside (sorry? Maybe mark inside/outside on your reservation system?) However, it wasn't my res, so might have made a mistake when reserving. But, when you have people dining in your frigid, non-heated setup (weird pushed air situation doesn't count), maybe prioritize their food in the kitchen and don't leave your guests out there for 2 hours. It took 55 min post-appetizers to get entrees (3 sushi rolls, drunken noodles, fried rice) and they literally forgot an entree (fried rice). Don't worry, they made sure to include the forgotten entree on our bill! In conclusion, 2 stars is generous. Servers were very friendly and helpful, issue seems to be front of house and other management. I know there are a lot of great reviews, but we've tried this place so many times in person (pre- and post- pandemic and via takeout) and it's always a major fail. Just go to Okinawa for fresh sushi and makeyour own noodle/rice dishes.
2020-11-19,5,I have gone to Saku a few times pre-covid and can't wait to go back with their outdoor and socially distanced set up. The menu is phenomenal and the service has always been superior, so I can't wait to experience this restaurant again!
2020-11-18,3,Food was decent but price was too expensive. It wasn't super authentic but it wasn't bad. If the price was 30% cheaper I would recommend it but at this price point I would not come here.
2020-11-12,5,Loved it! We dined inside and felt very safe, tables are set for proper social distancing, the staff were very friendly and the food is delicious.
2020-11-03,5,The best sushi in Hoboken and amazing cocktails to match! Worth the money and the aesthetics inside are beautiful! The menu has plenty of options; I've tried almost every item on the menu at this point and have yet to be disappointed. One of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken.
2020-10-25,5,This place is now the only place I'll be ordering sushi from in Hoboken. Absolutely amazing with great drinks as well. For specifics on my meal:Rolls were high quality and not too overly priced. For the speciality roll (drop it like it's hot) $15 gives you a total of 8 nicely sized rolls. Spicy tuna roll was also delicious. - Drunken noodles were good, but the serving is very large so plan to split it with someone. - You cannot go wrong with the bang bang shrimp dumplings. So full of flavor, a perfect supplement to a sushi app or vice versa. - Drinks were also fantastic. Saki is a little pricey but I had a cosmo which was perfectly crafted - not too sweet and a nicely sized glass.
2020-10-22,4,Came in for a reservation of 6 people - had to wait 45 minutes for a table - they said because we didn't specifically reserve outdoor seating. However, the description on the reservation said it was specifically outdoor seating only. The drinks are amazing (psl martini , sage drink & mr brightcide) , the rolls are good - the nigiri is incredibly overpriced. We mentioned earlier we still wanted to order more food and then they never told us the kitchen closed. Anyway, overall it was fine but the service probably could've been a bit better. Wouldnt bank on this place as the "main" dinner spot rather than a light bite and drinks
2020-10-20,5,Ooooo this place is great , during these times they have outdoor seating which is actually a cute setup , staff is okay food is really good. Don't sleep on this place !
2020-10-16,1,The drinks were great but the food was HORRENDOUS.  The gyoza was indelible as they had more salt than the sea and the tuna tartare tasted like nothing.
2020-10-15,5,Best quality sushi restaurant in Hoboken that also offers unconventional maki combos and kitchen-cooked  dishes. And their cocktails and sake offerings are pretty good, too! Love this spot.
2020-10-01,5,OMG! The sushi at Saku is amazing. Tonight I had the crunch drunk love roll and the dude where's my roll roll. They were both amazing. The sashimi was also amazingly fresh. They had Toro, and fatty yellow tail! There cuts have been impossible to find. So the food was amazing. The drinks were even better. We had Yum Yum sake booms and the WAP and as told by ginger cocktails they were all amazing. The staff was friendly especially the manager Jeff and the server Amanda, and shout out to the bartender Emily!!! Thank you so much for being there for us sushi lovers during these trying times. You made the experience safe and enjoyable.
2020-09-19,5,I love the place! The staff! OMG the best ever.   The food is amazing, the ambience is a vibe...overall a good time! Thanks y'all!
2020-09-13,2,I am very sad for writing a bad review during these difficult times, but the service at Saku tonight was unacceptable. My friend and I got there as scheduled at 7 pm and placed our order immediately: 1 bottle of wine, 1 appetizer each, and 1 special roll each. Easy peasy. The appetizer came after a normal waiting time, but then we waited exactly 1h and 30 minutes to get the rest of the dinner!!!! Basically 2 rolls!!! Whereas  people who arrived after us where happily enjoying their meals. I asked the staff for some explanation while waiting, and with a real arrogant tone I was told: "it will come, you have to be patient, maybe you order something hard to make"....euh...no! it was some salmon roll with poke salmon on the top, I prepare this at my house in 10 minutes max....but the worst had yet to come. Someone came apologizing for the inconvenience  and proposed us to make it up for the long waiting time by offering us a glass of wine. I believed this was very nice of them and almost forgot the accident. But what she did was beyond belief: instead of giving us a glass of wine, she just topped off quickly our existing, and pretty full, glasses. basically she offered us a sip of wine, literally.....This means taking customer for idiots. Unacceptable. As for the food. The Tuna tartare was good. The rolls.....meh....any other restaurant in Hoboken I tried does much better. Of course I will never stop by again and will not recommend this place to a friend .
2020-09-11,5,Just went to Saku for a first time visit! Food was great and service was better!! Jeff was our server and was fantastic would go back just for Jeff!
2020-09-09,5,Excellent sushi and ambiance! Really interesting rolls and drinks as well. It's also on a quieter street so it has a different feel than the restaurants on Washington, at least during COVID when we are all outside. Great spot and we'll be back!
2020-09-08,5,the rolls are delicious!!!! but before than that cosmo should been tried! thank you so much for the amazing service. Highly recommended!
2020-09-08,4,I was really excited to come here and stopped by a Sunday at 5pm (the earliest time for dinner) and was surprised to see within the next half hour majority of the outdoor seating was taken. We were seated right away and the servers were all super attentive and kind as they noticed me and my boyfriend were struggling with a wobbly table and came right over to fix it. food came out relatively fast! a lot of items we were hoping to try weren't on the menu as we found out they change out their menu frequently with different options, so still lots to choose from, just not many of the ones that we were excited to try. we ordered a few rolls and they all tasted fresh. they also have a nice selection of drinks available as well!i am a fan, and will be looking forward to coming back and trying out more options in the future :)
2020-09-06,5,Saku was more than accommodating to my party - allowed us to both change our reservation times and bring a dog! Beautiful outdoor setup, didn't feel worried about crowding at allWe were a group of 4, ordered drinks and two omakase dinners. The miso soups came in adorable bowls! The drinks were stellar & unique (I had shandy cheeks! My friends had bobalicious, cool for the summer, all great choices.One at our table had the roulette (?) forgot exactly the name, but one piece is randomly extremely spicy and you get a shot to cool it down. Great, fun night! Definitely coming back
2020-08-23,5,This review is for dining outside during COVID. I love Saku and have always enjoyed the food. But I was even more impressed when we made a reservation recently for prime dinner time. Knowing it's tough for a lot of restaurants during this time and definitely not easy for waiters to be in masks when it's 80-90 degrees outside, but they nailed it. They all worked as a team - even if it wasn't our specific waiter if we were close to finishing a drink we'd be approached for another. When plates where empty they were promptly cleared. Great experience and amazing food!
2020-08-23,5,I have been to Saku a couple times but this is my first review . Firstly, the service is among the best in Hoboken: attentive , genuine and speedy . The menu has a multitude of Sushi options as well as a robust drink menu with Sake on draft . The food is excellent as every roll or sashimi is tasty and fresh . Throw in the nice outdoor dining platform and it is the best venue in Town for sushi - handsdown
2020-08-15,4,I went here fir my birthday back in March before COVID took over and it was a blast. I was having a terrible birthday but the event coordinator made sure it was the best night of my life. They gave me and my table shots on the house and me a little extra. The aesthetic is adorable and the music is fun. The sushi was good, not amazing. Great customer experience I cant wait to go back.
2020-08-09,4,Update: Came back here for a second time. This was during the COVID pandemic so there was only outdoor seating available. The staff took the necessary precautions and tables were spread out. We ordered the sake bomb to start, which was good. For apps, the shrimp shumai was so good (can get it fried or pan seared). The fried ones have a little more crunch to it. For entrees, we ordered The Drop it like it's hot and spicy salmon rolls. Both were spot on, can't go wrong with either one. For dessert, we ordered the Mochi plate. All three mochis were good but there was a lot of whipped cream on the plate. Wasn't a big fan of the dessert.
2020-07-27,4,Saku is doing wonderfully in light of COVID. All the tables are safely spaced out and all the staff wear masks and gloves. The Kani salad appetizer was delicious! I had the Butter Like It's Hot roll and an Alaska roll. Both were pretty good for Hoboken. The restaurant is perfect for a date or special night out atmosphere. A bit on the pricey side but it reflects the service and setting. I would recommend this place for a nice night out or a first date kind of place
2020-07-26,4,I ordered 2 basic rolls and 2 signature rolls. Drop it like it's hot has a good combination with a nice heat. I like the beef slice in the Surf and turf as it's cooked nicely (not overcooked). However, I felt that the crab portion is slightly slimy? Not sure if that's the right way to describe it. The two basic rolls are as expected as it's similar to what I can get from other restaurant. Price is more on the pricey side.
2020-07-14,5,Sushi is always fresh and ALWAYS consistent. That's the reason I'm writing this review. To let the people know that when you come here you'll get a fantastic meal. I was also blown away by the outdoor dining experience they provided during COVID. Very attentive staff too, which is great. See ya soon!
2020-07-14,5,I'm so glad Saku is still able to operate during this time! My roommate and I love getting take out from Saku and sitting on our porch. Plus, they also have amazing to-go drinks. Highly recommend if you need a good sushi fix! You can't go wrong with ordering any of their speciality rolls.
2020-07-11,5,Excellent! Manager is super nice and accommodating during the covid restrictions and inclement weather. The sushi was awesome. The Philly roll was my favorite.
2020-06-26,3,I'm shocked to see the good reviews on here for this place. We didn't have as great of an experience as the rest of you. I thought it was overpriced, wasn't that tasty, and the sassy male waiter was a jerk. I'd love to give it a second try though!
2020-06-26,5,Saku has the freshest fish and rivals some of the best sushi restaurants in NYC. You will be blown away! Every dish and cocktail is meticulously hand crafted. There are both traditional and more modern menu items to choose from-definitely something for everyone. The staff is incredibly professional and friendly. Saku has done a fine job of providing delivery and outside dining options during times of social distancing.
2020-06-21,4,Came here last night for some sushi recommended to me and it was delicious! Omakase appetizer was my favorite since sashimi is my favorite. Really fresh and high quality! Their rolls are great as well. Would highly recommend the crunch drunk love roll. As good and refreshing it was to take a bite of the yellowtail with avocado it blended perfectly with the spicy mayo topped with tobiko. I was impressed with the service, our waitress Emily was very attentive and I appreciated that a lot. This place I highly recommend and I'll definitely be back.
2020-06-17,5,All I can say is that Saku nailed it when it comes to the relaunch and social distancing dining. I was a little nervous about going back out to eat but for the first time in three months Saku made me feel like life was normal again. As always their food was excellent. Thank you Jeff and Melanie for your great service and attention to detail.
2020-06-02,4,Lovely atmosphere and one of the best sushi  restaurant in the area. Their appetiser are so delicious! The back seating area is cosy, but it was a little too dark for my liking. Next time I go there I will aim to be seated in the front room which is bright with a very beautiful Japanese themed design. I haven't tried their brunch yet, but the menu for that sounds excellent! Can't wait to go back! It gets busy on weekend so it's best to book in advance.
2020-05-23,5,Saku is spectacular. Not just the amazing food or beautiful decor and atmosphere. The service is impeccable.  The people who work there are wonderful. Once they opened after the shut down Saku started to serve takeout and pick up.  We ordered through GrubHub. We had a problem with GrubHub. We ordered the day before and then it was canceled by GrubHub for the next day.  We were crushed. We called to find out why. A tech glitch. After sincerely apologizing the restaurant immediately filled our order. They were so wonderful. The food was AMAZING. We will continue going Saku. My wife adores Saku as do I and I'm sure you will too.
2020-05-14,1,Food is good here but service is not. I've never had excellent service in the restaurant dining in so I decided to give them a try through Seamless. I understand it's quarantine so restaurants get busy but I placed my order between 4:50pm-5:00pm. I never called because I assumed they were busy and they'd get to me. Around 7:15pm I got a notification they had cancelled my order because they are too busy. Couldn't they have cancelled my order long before making me wait two and a half hours to realize I'm no longer having dinner tonight? Absolutely ridiculous and unprofessional. Food is good but not that good. I'd rather go to Monroe's where at least I can get reliable tasty sushi.
2020-04-22,5,Amazing food, wonderful atmosphere, personal and excellent service...Sami always Delivers on the night out and dining experience you're looking for!
2020-03-28,5,I was talking to someone on the dating app and we met HERE. So I had to write a review either way. Great experience! It was a little tough to find at first because on the outside it really blends in well with the rest of the buildings, but it's near the corner so not too hard to find. First thing I noticed was the interior decor. Awesome. It's Modern Asian style, very quaint but modern and feels upscale although the prices were reasonable. The sushi was very good, fresh and tasty. Try anything on the menu and you won't be disappointed. Don't care about your wallet for a night? You can do that--order up! Just a few starters and thats your meal? Go for it, nice combo rolls. Overall very nice place, clean and delicious. Thanks again!
2020-03-06,4,I've been to Saku once for date night & we had a great time. We got the crispy cauliflower (so lightly fried!), duck tacos (very good), and some sushi. I tried the specialty vegan avocado roll, which was very good, and my boyfriend loved their spicy tuna & salmon poke rolls! He mentioned that while the specialty roll was significantly more money, it did seem like there was more preparation and care put into that roll. The cocktails were also very good. We'd return.
2020-02-29,5,Some of the best Sushi and Asian Fusion food you can get in Hoboken.  Their cocktails are also amazing.  The design of the restaurant inside is unique and it just has very good vibes.  Must try if you're in the area!
2020-02-29,5,Saku 100% lives up to the hype. Food was incredible and the service was awesome. We all got different rolls because we wanted to try each other's and they were all amazing. It was definitely the best sushi I ever had. Our waiter, the bartenders, and the managers were all so cool and friendly as well!The place itself also has an awesome vibe to it and they play good music too. I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves sushi or even if you don't they have great other food options as well. 10/10 going back.
2020-02-28,5,A really nice change from dark restaurants. It's so bright, light and airy inside. They're flowers everywhere lighting the mood. Definitely come back!
2020-02-27,4,I live around the corner and remember the old Turtle Club. When it became a Japanese restaurant it just did not job with my memories of the Turtle Club. Well I am right here so I finally tried Saku, sitting at the bar up front. Will behind the bar was my server. Everything was great, if expensive. I tried an unusual sake that was was described as 'hints of walnut' and, in fact, had hints of walnut. I had the daily special appetizer 'Baby Eggplant' and "sushi" 'Surf and Turf' which was crab with a bit of steak in avocado. Incredible great taste !!!I will definitely go back. For the readers' information I hold back on giving 5 stars until I go to a place that just blows me away. So 4 stars is my best rating short of dining in Heaven
2020-02-25,5,Great vibe, creative menu, awesome food, top-notch service.  I highly recommend!
2020-02-22,5,Loved- salmon poke roll, would get againLiked- crunchy yellowtail roll with salmon on top, don't mind g getting again but would try something elseDisliked- miso soup- mackerel nigiri
2020-02-21,5,First time trying out this place and won't be my last one. Really nice interior. Definitely date night place .
2020-02-21,5,Saku is such a great place for brunch for its combo of delicious sushi entrees and mimosas. I ordered the sushi pizza which is just so pretty on the plate. It is essentially sushi toppings on tortillas! So delicious, but don't be fooled by the word "pizza". I also ordered a spicy tuna roll and that was fresh and delicious as well. Their other options sound fun and I definitely want to go back for the Hobo roll - scrambled eggs and home fries? yes. When it's nice they have indoor and outdoor seating.
2020-02-19,5,Made a reservation for Valentine's and it's a great date night spot! Everything that was ordered was delicious. I reccomend the garlic edamame appetizer, the miso soup (best I've ever had), bang bang shrimp gyoza, chicken teriyaki bowl, and dude, where's my roll. This place is a fun environment with delicious food. Both the dark and the pink room had a nice ambiance. I cant wait to return to Saku Hoboken. Only thing I would recommend to Saku Hoboken is a better ventilation system. There is an odor of the food that you notice when you walk in and that lingers on your clothes when you walk out.
2020-02-16,5,Great Sushi! Staff is friendly and sushi is the best in Hoboken. Restaurant is really cool inside as well.
2020-02-10,5,This past Saturday I had the best experience imaginable at Saku for a private party in the dark room from 9-12 to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. Melanie, Saku's event coordinator made the entire process a breeze. From coordinating what menu items I would like to be served, to how I would like the room decorated, to creating a specialty cocktail for the party and special menus to be placed around the bar and buffet, setting up group photos, serving cake and singing happy birthday, assuring me anyone with food restrictions would be accommodated to the best of the restaurants ability (both vegan and gluten free guests in our group had no trouble finding things to eat!), anything you can think of - Melanie spared no expense in making it all happen! We had an open bar package that guests were able to order cocktails as they requested, we had 2 sushi platters (4 specialty rolls and 4 regular roles each -- I suggest the cheeseburger with fries specialty roll it's amazing), philly cheese steak gyoza, avocado kani salad, chicken fried rice (best I've ever had in my life), fish tacos, salmon teriyaki, sushi and sashimi the food options were endless and the staff was so accommodating to our requests. Also to note- we had around 20-25 guests and ended up taking home loads of leftovers, which included two full trays of sushi, cake, an entire boxes of chicken fried rice, salmon, and the avocado kani salad. You do not need to be worried about portion size with this place! They've got you covered and Melanie was so kind as to package everything up and have ready for us when we left.Everyone at the party said how much they enjoyed their time, how delicious the food was, how great the dark rooms atmosphere was, how amazing the bartenders were at creating the requested cocktails, and now how they all want to celebrate their birthday at saku. LOLI cannot say enough about what a wonderful experience I had. I would never go anywhere else for a private party. Melanie truly was phenomenal and you can tell how much she loves what she does by the work she put into making this party everything it was. I cannot say thank you enough to her and the rest of the staff for making it the best night imaginable. Truly topped every possible expectation. Highly, highly recommend!!
2020-02-06,5,I have tried out Saku twice so far and both experiences have been great! The first time we dined in and the second time I got food delivered.While vegetarian options are limited, they have a great options. Their garlic edamame is amazing and a must try! I also tried out their veggie roll called "drop the beet & roll" and it is one of the better tasting veggie rolls I've had.My husband also tried out the burger but was not too impressed by it. However, the fries that came on the side were delicious :)Delivery wise, the food came in a timely manner and was packaged well and contained all the correct items.All in all, this place is a great local option!
2020-02-06,5,2 words; Duck Tacos. They were glorious. Very modern and elegant look in decor; the 2 sides of the restaurant represent almost a ying yang aesthetic that is well done and not contrived. Definitely worth it if you're in the neighborhood.
2020-02-03,5,Went on a date with my wife. Nice lounge vibe. A little loud for casual convo. Food was excellent. Next day we even ordered takeout from there. If in the area again I would repeat.
2020-01-27,5,Just moved into the neighborhood and my boyfriend and I have been trying new spots in the area for dinner... the food did NOT disappoint. We live on the same block and we were pleasantly surprised at the quality of our dinner. It was delicious. The portions were generously served.Our waiter was great, he poured widow tears into my drink. "Samurai's Widow" was refreshing and I loved the presentation. Can't wait to come back and explore more of the menu. Don't be fooled by the exterior. Love the modern day Asian layout inside has to offer. Totally Recommend for a dinner date!
2020-01-16,4,This was almost 5 stars and might be after next meal.  Only thing wish was better and more draft beers as 2 of their 6 taps were wine and 2 others were gone so only had asahi.  Not sure what is in 6th tap.  Sushi  is not cheap as costs per piece is 4 dollars though during happy hour goes down to 2.5.  Beer only reduced to 7 from 8.   Sushi was very good and decent size.  Almost wish got two thinner cuts of fish on two pieces of rice instead of one bigger piece.  Shrimp udon was sort of Thai Japanese fusion thing and included a few big shrimps.My cocktail was okay though I am not fan of Yuzu or sake which many of the options included. Service was good as the manager was working the bar.Place is nice looking especially the light room.  On Thursdays have live music in there though can hear in other room.
2020-01-15,5,Easily the best sushi restaurant in Hoboken.  It's got an imaginative menu that incorporates old favorites with new ingredients to make it new again.  The split light and dark rooms are also an interesting twist.
2020-01-09,5,So my second time here with my girlfriend and they didn't dissapoint. We sat at the bar (i recommend only because the two times i was there the dining room was packed and it seems to feel a bit tight when it is) being at the bar for me was a better experience. Our bartender was Melanie i believe was her name and her service among everyone else was perfect. They serve their cocktails with the freshest ingredients but the food. After the bang shrimp we got the surf and turf and the yellowtail sushi. We had fun because the yellowtail sushi has a Russian roulette thing where one of the rolls has a ghost pepper sauce. Cool that down with a free saki shot and thats a fun night. We even tried their ramen rib bowl where they bring out a shank of rib HUGE!  The pace of their service was at a good pace and i praise the chef on some amazing dishes with lots of mixed cultural backgrounds and presentations. I recommend this place if ur a fan of sushi
2020-01-06,4,Beautiful decorations! Their cherry blossoms and ornaments were so cute and it made the restaurant perfect for a date night! Upon arrival we noticed it was busy but the hostess was available to seat my boyfriend and I to our table within fifteen minutes! While waiting I ordered us a cocktail and stout beer. Both very good! One of the workers there even complimented me which was super sweet! :) When it came to our servers, they were attentive, and very nice. My only complaint is the amount of time it took for our food to come out. At least fifty minutes to an hour of waiting and we were hungry. I wasn't sure why but luckily my boyfriend and I had great date. We ordered the sushi for two (priced at $63) which came with miso soup, but they let us have their garlic edamame instead, sashimi, sushi, a specialty roll, and a basic roll. Enough to fill us both up. The garlic edamame had absolutely no flavor at all. Did not taste any garlic and had to ask for salt to add some flavor to it. The sushi rice was a little off, but the fish itself was absolutely delicious. Their salmon was my favorite! For their specialty roll we had the surf n turf roll and it was really good but huge. If you're looking for a cute date night or a night out with friends I would recommend this spot! I saw they had brunch specials too so hopefully I will be back for that!
2020-01-05,4,Really interesting and creative sushi and cocktails in a fun atmosphere. While they have the basics, many of the roll options are a step up from what you'd find at a standard Hoboken sushi spot and I really appreciate this creativity. Atmosphere is fun as well and definitely perfect for a girls night out or date night. I went with a friend and we shared the garlic edamame (yum!) and three rolls which was the perfect amount for us. Everything was tasty, including the Tokyo rose cocktail! It feels a bit pricier than other spots in town due to the fact it's not byob, but it's worth it for a nicer night out when you want to feel a little trendier! I'll definitely back again!
2020-01-04,3,New-age sushi spot. Three positives about the place: ambiance, lighting, and service. However, the food was subpar. We ordered four appetizers and two sushi rolls. Appetizers were garlic edamame, tuna tartare, duck taco, and philly cheese steak gyoza. Edamame was too spicy and we sent it back. They served regular edamame instead but it lacked salt. Tuna tartare was okay, but also needed salt and some zest. Duck taco was pretty good. Philly cheese steak gyoza was not warm enough, which we also sent back. Instead of serving us new gyozas, they heated what we sent back on the grill and served us the same food. When it comes to sushi, we ordered Japanese jeopardy, which was subpar and was falling apart. Death by Hamachi roll was better. Lastly, positively, cocktails were better than anticipated and the Nutella dessert saved the day.
2019-12-29,5,Melanie is our favorite bartender in town. The Sushi is just a plus. Their non-sushi menu is great too. Low key... check out the burger, one of the best in town. I also love the teriyaki bowl. Sushi for 2 is great for date night. If you've never had unfiltered Saki, try the "crazy milk" it's really good. Reservations can be hard to get so plan ahead.
2019-12-29,3,Beautifully decorated restaurant! I love the cherry blossom and other ornaments hanging from the ceiling. Immersive ambiance!  Our waitress was very attentive and I think she was also the bartender since this is a quiet weekend in Hoboken. The drinks were on point - crafty and delicious. The food review is based on brunch selection. The food came out after ~40 mins after ordering. Considering there was only one other table there, I don't know what caused the backlog. Needless to say we were famished. We ordered spicy scallop roll, stuffed French toast, and wagyu burger. - Spicy scallop roll was on point and it tasted very fresh. - Stuffed French toast was far below expectations - think semi toasted thick multigrain bread with fluffy strawberry cream cheese spread on. This is most certainly not "stuffed" French toast. - Wagyu burger was average at best. We ordered it as medium and got well done burger. I don't foresee this being my go to brunch spot. I see potential for sushi and drink spot (their cocktails do kickass!).
2019-12-27,5,Favorite sushi spot in Hoboken. Very cool, unique drinks and sushi rolls
2019-12-23,5,Came with a friend on a Thursday night and we loved our dinner! We got to choose the light or dark room. The light room is more dinner vibes and the dark room is for happy hour/drinks. Surf & turf roll is a MUST! The salmon poke roll was delish. We got a roll off the specials list too. Can't wait to come back. Would highly recommend for a date/girls night!
2019-12-14,3,A fascinating meal. Japanese food meets millennial brunch culture. While I felt the ambience to be a bit bizarre, I did enjoy the food. Steak and egg fried rice, solid sushi rolls, and fun Japanese-fusion takes on typical brunch cocktails made for a nice experience. Service was slow, but that's the only major black mark. Interested in trying again for dinner to see how different it is from the brunch rollout.
2019-12-13,5,Absolutely love this place! The sushi is some of the freshest I've ever had, the cocktails are delicious and the service is impeccable. They also have fun theme nights that aren't exactly the same as everywhere else in Hoboken like Rewined Wednesday where along with discounts on certain wines you can fill out requests for the DJ to play your favorite jams from back in the day. Marie, one of the managers there is amazing! We attended a wines by Grey event recently (which was fabulous) and when I let her know about an issue I had purchasing one of my tickets, she went above and beyond to not only make sure it was rectified but sent me an incentive to entice me to come back--all hospitality managers should be taking a page out of her playbook, as she single-handedly solidified us as repeat customers (We've already been back twice :))
2019-11-26,5,By far the best sushi in Hoboken. No questions asked. Always pushing the limits of sushi and way above the standard for alcohol.
2019-11-13,5,Love this place in the old turtle club. Tuesday is flight night, it's 15 dollars per flight. They are generous pours. The 30/40/50 sake was delicious as was the red wine flight. The jeopardy roll is insane!!carolina Reefer pepper, never had anything spicier in my life. The sashimi and sushi are super fresh and great quality. The bartender Melanie, is amazing!! Super friendly, knowledgeable and funny. Definitely check it out!
2019-11-11,4,Chicken buffalo Gyoza appetizer tastes amazing! The rest of the food we ordered was okay (chicken teriyaki, ribs with ramen noodles and avocado rolls). The serve was fast and friendly. Good atmosphere overall.
2019-11-09,5,Excellent cocktails. The sushi is so unique, so much variety between raw and even cooked. My husband and I tried the  philly steak dumplings which were amazing! The sushi you can't choose wrong. We have tried even the hamburger sushi - this comes up cooked hamburger meat and French fries, who knew this could be on sushi?! The ambiance is good, quiet street in Hoboken and the restaurant itself is decorated well.
2019-11-06,5,I honestly wish I could give them a better review. We went for my birthday sinnerThe food and atmosphere here is unbelievable. We got the Philly cheesesteak gyoza, Japanese Jeopardy, surf and turf roll and the salmon poke roll. All of them I could talk on and on about for days, it was THAT good. The service here however is absolutely bizarre though... our appetizer took an entire hour to come out. Our reservation was at 7:30 and we didn't leave until 10 PM. It was extremely odd lol when we paid they took a whole 30 minutes to bring our check back and even stopped by our table and completely forgot they had taken our card - it was busy but not packed to the point it would warrant this kind of time. They did take our appetizer off the bill and gave us some free shots of sake to make up for it which was definitely appreciated but I really just don't understand what was happening here, it was truly one of the strangest dining experiences of my life.Update: I always can appreciate when an owner or manager takes the time out of their day to respond to reviews on here. I believe this shows true customer service. I've changed my review to 5 stars for this reason.
2019-11-05,4,Finally got to Saku despite living a block away. I had heard mixed things going in, but my expectations were slightly and pleasantly exceeded.We had to wait a while for a table but were able to sit at the bar faster instead and order there. We had drinks at the bar, both of which were fine but nothing memorable: the Samarai's Widow (the better of the 2) and the Tokyo Rose.First course was a Toro Tataki special in some kind of truffle sauce; loved this. Any time I can get toro I take advantage. And with truffles? No brainer. Would order again.We got 3 rolls: I forget the name (it was on the Specials menu) but it had soft shell crab in it, similar to a spider roll. It was the weakest of the 3, but by default. The Japanese Jeopardy Roll was a no brainer to order based on recommendation. It's actually a very good roll, with the added bonus (?) of one VERY spicy piece. The best roll BY FAR was the Crunch Drunk Love. Our bartender Wil explained that it was a special for a while and was promoted to the everyday menu. I can see why. MUST HAVE in my opinion.Service was very good albeit a little slow. Busy Friday night though so it was understandable. Wil behind the bar was awesome and helped with my whiskey selection.The most appropriate rating probably lies somewhere between 3-4 stars.
2019-11-04,5,It was our 2nd time here at Saku, and it did not disappoint.  The restaurant has two sides... a darker one on the left and a brighter one (where we were seated) on the right.  Both are decorated beautifully and feature some really nice murals. The menu has a great list of drinks, including some amazing cocktails and mocktails, and a large selection of Sake, and a lot of fun food to eat.We ordered the omasake sushi app, the yellowtail jalapeño app and the Kobe sliders, which came with 3 different sauces on the side.  But our favorite is their gyoza.  The Philly cheesesteak comes with a green sauce, and the buffalo chicken comes with a ranch sauce.  They have 5 pieces in an order and both have great flavor and they leave you craving for more.We also had a couple of drinks... but I can't recall their names.Outside of the great food and drinks, where Saku really shined was their service.  All of the staff we interacted with were really friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be there.  Wish this place was closer, so we could make it a regular... we will definitely be back again.
2019-11-03,5,Great food with even better service.   The chief was super interested in our opinion and experience.  Definitely will go back soon.
2019-11-03,5,This place is amazing. The staff and sushi chefs are overwhelmingly kind and attentive. This was our second time there and we can't wait to go back. The crispy cauliflower is a sneaky gem !!!
2019-10-30,5,Great food and awesome cocktails! Happy this came to town as we didn't have any sushi/Asian fusion restaurants that felt fancy to dine with friends or for a night out.
2019-10-28,4,Loved it! Their deep fried buffalo chicken gyoza is truly one of the best things I've ever eaten. The drinks are great and super creative but a little on the smaller side for the price.
2019-10-25,2,This doesn't feel like a sushi place at all. We were really in the mood for good sushi. Their signature roll selection is limited and half of them have very non-traditional, Americanized ingredients (i.e., surf and turf roll, I like big butter and I cannot lie roll). The names of the rolls made me cringe (basic bitch roll/ dude where's my roll). The whole experience just felt off and the prices didn't reflect the quality of food or service we received. While the salmon poke roll wasn't bad, the surf and turf roll was inedible (only one was eaten from the plate. You would think the server might notice this and ask if everything was okay, but we weren't asked once). We also tried the  beef sliders and the Philly cheesesteak gyoza, both were bland, lacking in any flavor other than unseasoned beef.  Additionally, the service was poor. We asked the server a few questions, of which, he did not know the answer to. He offered to find out, and never came back to us with a response. I do not see myself going back. There's plenty of other places in the area for quality sushi.
2019-10-25,4,I've been a couple of times and have truly enjoyed every dining experience. The food is great, many options (also have seasonal options). They have daily specials, and that's not only for food - live music, wine wednesdays, etc. Has a wonderful aesthetic, however, it can get SO loud - wasn't even a weekend evening either of the few times I've gone, too. The acoustics in there dramatically amplify conversations ontop of descently loud music (probably because everybody and noises are so loud), so when it's packed in the dining portion and you're not fully emersed in your date or friends or whomever, other conversations and music can be a little distracting. Other than the noisiness, the waiters are super nice, knowledgable and attentative, and I pretty much love everything about dining there!
2019-10-21,5,Some of the most inventive dishes and best sushi I've had in a long time. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and professional. Love this new spot !
2019-10-08,5,Where do I even begin? As a Celiac, it's tough for me to find sushi that accommodates to my dietary restriction. Saku hits it right on the head by notating which rolls I can eat and which I should steer clear from. This is VERY refreshing coming from a sushi restaurant where I'm often hesitating on what rolls I can eat vs. not. Sushi here is very fresh and thoughtfully prepared. I love the roulette sushi with a shot in the center - so creative and definitely something the whole table can join in on. My friend and I decided to come for dinner one night - great food, amazing drinks - the bird glasses are incredibly cute! Bartender is knowledgable and offered recommendations as well. I will be returning for a date night with my husband very soon!
2019-10-04,4,Update: came here again today and got the crunchy love roll, garlic edamame, guac is extra and scallops roll. We also got the chocolate gyoza and it was really good! All the food was very tasty tonight and was definitely impressed again. Had to take a star off because the service was very slow tonight
2019-09-30,5,Love this place! Little pricey but it's a great addition to Hoboken and somewhere nice to go rather than a bar or grill. The menu is varied and there's something for everyone, the food is great and setting is very cool too. Must try the cauliflower - so good! The service was a little slow for us but it wouldn't put us off, we really enjoyed it and will be coming back soon!
2019-09-28,4,Not a sushi fan but loved sushi here. Went to Saku for brunch with my roommates and we had great time with good sushi and brunch cocktails are amazing. Not to forget the prettiest decor I have seen!
2019-09-26,5,This has quickly become one of my favorite sushi spots since I've eaten here. The decor is just beautiful from the outside in.The staff was friendly and accommodating throughout the entire experience. The drinks were all meticulously made and all had signature flavors. I enjoyed the saki served to me chilled through a tap they have setup behind the bar and also really enjoyed their signature Samurai Widow drink. They are all must tries. The food overall was fresh and delicious. I am picky when It comes to sushi but this restaurant truly delivered on quality and presentation. The size of the rolls and the pieces were perfect, and the freshness of the fish was on point. Amazing guacamole with tasty crackers were served along with a delicious sashimi styled dip. I also tasted delicious charred shishito peppers and amazing philly cheesesteak styled Gyoza. All very unique and delicious.I will definitely be coming back to this place!!
2019-09-21,5,Never had a bad meal here. From table service to sitting at the sushi bar, the staff has also always been incredibly friendly and helpful. Try the crunch crunch munch much and big butter role. Unique and delicious!
2019-09-14,5,Really enjoyed my dinner here tonight! I had the Japanese Jeopardy roll and it was really delicious. One randomly placed piece of the roll had a Carolina Reaper Pepper inside which added an extra fun thrill to dinner. I will say it was really spicy but the sake that comes with the roll is a nice touch to cool your mouth down. Also, tried some of the spicy shrimp tempura roll and spicy tuna roll and they were both great as well. Honestly some of the most delicious and freshest sushi I have had in Hoboken so far. Make sure to ask for the extended "basic bitch menu" if you are interested in some classic rolls at cheaper prices than the specialities. It's slightly annoying that you have to specifically ask for this menu but really not a big deal overall when you consider the quality of sushi from this place. I hope to see their sushi menu expanded in the future. Would be nice to have some more speciality roll options added. I will definitely be returning.
2019-09-14,3,#Saku has two sides when you walk in. One that is sleek, dark, and has the sushi bar.  We chose to sit in the area that is bright and has the floral decor. I was impressed with the setup. We had great service throughout our Wednesday dinner. There were drink specials but when it came down to how much wine you actually got, it was below modest. We tried out a few things on their menu and I was disappointed with the sushi and the portion sizes. Many of the sushi places I've visited have the speciality rolls really stand out from regular sushi rolls. This was not the case at Saku. We had the Dude Where's My Roll?" and "Guac is extra roll". Both were mediocre. We had the simple sushi pieces: salmon and yellowtail and those were my favorite of the night. Overall 3.5 rating for the great services, ambiance, but they fell short on the sushi for me.
2019-09-13,5,Went with my friend for a girls dinner and had a great time. The rolls that were on the specials menu  were delicious as were the other rolls we ordered. Tuna tartare appetizer and dessert didn't disappoint. The food was fresh and the service was attentive. We shared a bottle of wine and prices were fair with good portions! Will definitely be back!
2019-09-09,4,I'm going with 3.5-4 stars for my first impression of Saku.  I wasn't one to frequent the Turtle Club, but I do remember the way it looked inside and I have to credit Saku with completing a tasteful renovation to create a comfortable and attractive restaurant space, equally distributed between a dining room, a bar, and the sushi bar room with high-top tables. Saku has a fun and creative sushi menu. Look for some interesting starters, such as the delicious Buffalo chicken gyoza. We also ordered simple sushi pieces of salmon and yellow tail, and they were fresh and delicious. Next were two specialty rolls: "Dude Where's My Roll?" and "Guac is extra roll". Both were tasty versions of shrimp tempura and spicy tuna rolls, but the portions were on the modest size, as were the pours of beer and wine.  We had a friendly server that had a very good knowledge of the menu, so nice job there. All in all, this is an enjoyable, trendy, and needed addition to the midtown Hoboken area that I would revisit and further explore the menu.
2019-09-08,5,Excellent food, service, and ambiance! Highly recommend for a date night or girls night out. I went there this past Friday and we had a mini bachelorette party for a girlfriend. They were very accommodating and chose the perfect place for us in the restaurant. We were able to hang a few decorations up and the staff was very helpful! I will definitely be back!!
2019-09-04,5,Easily my favorite sushi spot in Hoboken. The menu is super unique and constantly changing- I've never ordered something that I haven't loved! The sushi is always fresh and delicious and the cocktails are great also. The restaurant itself is beautiful as well and always has great music!
2019-08-31,4,Favorite sushi place in Hoboken! Great atmosphere-- feels like you are in Manhattan and not Hoboken. The sushi is good quality and the rolls are creative! Definitely a great date spot or place to go out with friends.
2019-08-28,5,Amazing food and service! Came here for the first time tonight, and wished I had come sooner! The decor is to die for, you'd forget it was last turtle club. The sushi is changed seasonly which is good to know that everything is fresh and complimented the season. Will definitely be back soon!
2019-08-23,1,Went to this place for a friday night date. Were seated and placed our order right away. We were sitting outside and other 5 tables filled in within next 20 minutes and started getting drinks and appetizers. We didn't get anything. Then everyone esle got soups (that we also ordered) we got nothing. At this point it's been an hour since we placed an order. We asked server how long it will take to get our order. They promised to bring us soups right away. After another 10 minutes they brought soup that suposed to be miso soup. I think since they rushed in out they forgot to add miso paste? It didn't have any taste at all. After another 10 minutes and after all other tables were finishing eating their main courses we got an order. Only it was not what we ordered. We ordered sushi for 2 which comes with 2 rolls and both rolls were completele wrong. They took it back. We thought they brought wrong plate out but they said they are redoing it. At this point,  1:30 after we got there, we left.
2019-08-18,5,Awesome sushi in Hoboken. It is extremely fresh and a fun atmosphere. Would highly recommend.
2019-08-17,5,Very good interior design was my first impression. When the meals came, I was surprised by the perfect combination of western and eastern styles! The only thing so so is the coffee... Unless you are the person for only authentic coffee... LOL, otherwise you have to try this place!
2019-08-17,5,Been 2x now and very happy both times. I love the white room by far. The dishes/app are quite sweet so be careful! Bit of a turn off for me Persia lily but they are tasty if that's okay with you. Had the drop the beet roll. Tasty as well!! The rice could be just fluffy and more sticky! I hope it was just a fluke of my past 2times. I still feel this deserves a 5  review for the area!
2019-08-12,5,This place is fantastic. I actually called my dad the other day to tell him that not only is it my favorite sushi restaurant, but it's my favorite restaurant overall! From the moment you walk in, you can tell it's going to be great. The decor inside is absolutely beautiful, and they also have a nice patio. Service is on point. Cocktails very refreshing and well done. Everything was super fresh and of the highest quality. For apps I would recommend the garlic edamamae and the yellowtail jalepeno. All of the rolls are great especially the poke salmon. But the death by hamachi is THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You need to get it!!!!!!
2019-08-09,4,Not the right place if you are looking for authentic high quality sushi. But fun setting, great ambiance, and well priced. Drinks are also awesome
2019-08-09,3,I am really only writing this review because hopefully it will help the owners/management fine-tune some things because it would be great for them to do well. I came here when it first opened, and it had some kinks to work out.  Our appetizer never came, our sushi rolls were all on different plates and we'd have to eat over each other to eat the rolls.  But we understood that it was a new restaurant, and they were still working on things/communication.  The owner was there that night and he totally helped make it okay and we gave our feedback because we want them to make it work.  Fast forward 7 months, and I feel things are still out of whack.  We came for happy hour, which is from 5-7pm, only offering one variety of white, red, and sake for $7 a glass, no food included in any happy hour offerings. They were out of the one white wine that was normally offered, but never thought to replace it with a different one.  I am kind of surprised by that, since there is a $8 dollar glass listed on the menu, which could be sold for the dollar less for 2 hours when your shipment of the normal wine hasn't come in. Especially when the bottle is probably $7 itself retail price.  When you are being told no, you can only get the red or sake, or you can pay up for another white wine, that is just stupid.  For a $1 a glass, you could make it look a bit better that you are accommodating happy hour and you are willing to give a different wine for the same price. Our appetizer didn't come out first again this time, and it was evident by the food runner that it was definitely not put in with our order.  I get it, things happen/mistakes are made, but what bothered me more was the excuse for it.  Instead of saying, "i am so sorry i forgot to put that app in for you, they are making it right away", we were told that the sushi was made first so he thought we wanted it out first before the appetizer.  It made the guy who was bringing the dishes to us look stupid, when it was clearly the waitress' fault. I mean i think most people realize you want an appetizer first, before your meal...since that is what an appetizer is.  And if there is any confusion, they should ask if you want it all together or apps first.  But regardless, I rather someone own up to it than say it is someone else's issue.  I was also told that the tuna tartare that i ordered would be a $1 more because of where the tuna came from.  I found that a bit weird, since it isn't on the menu as M/P as others are.  It is a fixed price. Yet now they are adding another dollar on top of it?  I don't really get that.  If you are going to do that, you should change the price next to it to M/P, otherwise, it's a fixed price.  Don't make the customer pay another $1 because you happened to get your tuna from Boston that day. All that being said, the food was pretty good. I can only speak for some apps (tuna tartare and cauliflower), and some rolls (non-basic b*tch ones), but it was pretty good.  I feel it is a bit pricey though.  It has a city pricing mentality, but it lacks the city quality.  They do not offer brown rice, and i know there are places like Nobu that do not as well, but this is far from Nobu quality.  Just offer brown rice, it is nice to have the option! There are other places in hoboken that do sushi rolls, appetizers, and drinks for happy hour which are really good and make it worth while. Hopefully they will add more to their happy hour menu, and work out their issues soon. Until then, I will go to other sushi places in Hoboken.
2019-08-05,4,Located in the quieter section of hoboken this place has a very pretty Japanese cherry blossom inspired ambience.We went here on a Sunday morning for brunch.The Menu was japanese inspired along with regular brunch favorites.We had the goat cheese and blueberry spiced empanadas which were tasty.This was the first time i had something like this and pleasantly surprises.We also had the five spice french toast and the tuna melt sandwich which were good.
2019-08-02,5,Delicious sushi and great cocktails. The Saku roll is the signature roll and is big enough to split in addition to ordering a couple other rolls/pieces of sushi. Lively crowd and good music contributes to the great atmosphere
2019-07-31,5,My husband and I went to a sushi making class which was perfectly priced. We were told we were going to make 3 rolls, tuna, salmon avocado and California roll. We cut our own cucumbers and avocados after watching two sushi chefs, Bridget and Eddie, do it as well. Then to our surprise they let us make one on our own which was so much fun! I would definitely recommend this as a date night if you love sushi! The drinks were also delicious. Bridget and Eddie were so attentive and helped when it looked like anyone needed it.
2019-07-24,2,I want to love Saku because Hoboken needs more places  like this but I just couldn't. It's the food. It's just not very good. And the layout is awkward.
2019-07-24,5,Love the Fresh take & gorgeous presentation of food. The setting is lovely too! It's like eating, drinking & sitting in the hippest, delicious Gallery
2019-07-11,5,Wonderful restaurant in the home of ye olde Turtle Club! Went here a couple Saturdays ago. Gf and I got two rolls, beers and saku bombs, miso soup, and the buffalo chicken gyoza which were absolutely bonkers. Marie is a lovely and talented GM. Decor was cool and fit for Instagram. Will definitely return. Au revoir for now
2019-07-06,5,Great spot! This is a newer place in town and it is a good addition. I have been in hoboken for a while and I feel like the sushi options in town have gotten a little stale. Saku is a great option to have and delivers with both the food and the ambiance.When you walk in they have two side. There is a dining area with a bar and a smaller sushi bar area with some tables. Both are fun. It also is a good place if you are coming with a group. Make sure you make a reservation because it gets busy but they do a good job of accomodating groups. The food here puts a unique spin on all the normal sushi items. They have different specialty rolls that have a fun twist on basic sushi. I have tried a bunch of different rolls and loved them. They also have an extensive sashimi selection. It is hard to find good sashimi because it is a simple dish that needs high quality ingredients. Saku hits the spot here. The fish is fresh and you can taste it.  They also do brunch here and we liked it. I came with my family and the pictures I attached are from there. Overall, this is a 5 star place because it checks off all the boxes that are important to me. Come check it out you won't be disappointed.
2019-07-04,5,This is definitely one of the best restaurants in town. I've visited this restaurant 3 times and on all occasions we have received amazing service and delicious food. We have sampled most of their appetizers, and I would recommend garlic edamame and the kurikake fries, but all of their appetizers are delicious. We had sushi as our entrees, and they were all amazing.
2019-07-03,5,I was very hyped to be going here with my girlfriend after reading all the reviews and man this place did not disappoint. The Gyoza was banging I highly recommend it. The highlight of the night was the Surf and Turf sushi roll, the combination of crab with the smokiness of the steak was utter perfection. The people providing service were at our table every couple of minutes making sure we were okay and had everything we needed. Saku was the complete package and if you like Asian Fusion food this place is a must.
2019-07-03,1,If you're a real sushi fan and have a lot of good sushi places under your belt this place does not hold up. The fish is dry, it's not garnished, the presentation is a blend of tough fish and unfortunately everything, including the drinks, are overpriced. Travel into the city and try Sugar Fish if you want a great entry level Omakase. Step it up a little at Sushi by Bou. Once you do that you'll find the rest of the good spots easily.
2019-07-01,5,About a month ago had an amazing time at Saku, Melanie helped me plan a birthday brunch for my best friend and she was nothing but amazing. Everything met my expectations! Food was great, drinks were on point. Would definitely go back and recommend. Thanks again Melanie for the perfect brunch
2019-07-01,4,This place is pretty solid and made a great use out of the space that was once the Turtle Club.Great environment/ambiance-it's got two "ends" or rooms-one dark one light (kind of like yin and yang). I always like staying on the light side.There are bars that you can eat a full meal at in both rooms, and when you're lucky enough to be here on a night when there's live music, they're always stationed in the light room.The menu is good-they offer traditional sushi rolls if you ask but their focus is specialty rolls and specialty dishes.  The guac is extra roll is my fave.  I also literally like all of the apps and small plates-you can't go wrong.  They always have rotating specials (usually 3-4), and that'll be attached to the front of the menu (if it wasn't, just ask).Very interesting cocktails-they have great bartenders/mixologist if you decide to go off menu though.  They have sake on draft/tap and a selection of beer and wine as well.So I would give this place a 5 (and honestly wish they had half stars because it's a solid 4.5), but... it's a bit pricey.  For 2 people, you could easily order a few small plates/apps, split a main or get a specialty roll or two, have a drink each and you're already well over $100. Another thing is it's really tough to get a table on the weekend evenings-definitely make a reservation on yelp, because it's not a huge place and it gets busy (eat at the bar if you can grab a set-both those areas are first come first served so if you have. Small party and no reservation-that's your best bet).  Last thing is the food can really take a bit long, so settle in a bit, order a drink, and don't go ravenous especially on a busy night.   Again, all little things, but just things to note before you go, and you absolutely should-we've probably been there at least 10 times now, and keep coming back (and not just because we live close by, but that helps)!  It's a great addition to the uptown food scene.
2019-06-28,5,Highly recommend this new sushi restaurant. Wonderful ambiance and friendly staff. They have different and unique rolls. We ordered japan suko, I think it was called, and it's basically a Russian roulette game of who is going to end up with the hidden ghost pepper roll. The shot in the middle is for the person who gets it so it eases the spice.
2019-06-23,5,Very good spot! Fresh sushi, omakase was NOT what i was expecting but still very cool trendy place with good sushi.
2019-06-18,5,Went to Saku for the second time about a week or so ago.We ordered the tuna tar tar which was probably the best I've had in Hoboken. I also ordered the surf and turf roll again since I'm a creature of habit lol. One roll is definitely enough. Actually all 3 of us ordered the surf and turf and none of finished them! Super delicious and filling so we definitely did not leave still hungry.All and all still a good experience :) will definitely branch out and order something new next time
2019-06-15,5,Love saku! Great addition to the neighborhood. Love their take on the garlic edamame and all drinks are A+. Lots of switching it up by season. The Russian Roulette role is amazing and it's always funny seeing who gets the spicy one.
2019-06-10,5,Yesterday evening I had a phenomenal experience at Saku's private sushi making class, where they also offered a special beer/wine/whiskey/etc. flight menu to us during the class! Overall the event was absolutely outstanding and to say the very least, it was all thanks to Melanie who had outdone herself with organizing it. I'm already thinking about the next time I can go back!It all started when we walked into the dark room which was beautifully set up, with a sushi making table set in the middle of the room as well as a separate dining table set off to the side to eat at after the class was over.  Once we all finally arrived at the restaurant the Sous Chef, Bridget, introduced herself and was our sushi chef for the event. She was very friendly and willing to help anyone who needed a little bit of extra help with the sushi rolling. Bridget showed us how to make 3 rolls, the first was a tuna roll with the seaweed on the outside, then a California roll with the seaweed on the inside followed by a salmon hand roll which personally was my favorite.  Before we even got started Melanie made sure we were all comfortable and even brought us each a saki bomb (which to be honest was the best saki bomb I've ever had...ever). What a great way to start the class!The sushi making part of the class took a little over an hour, and once we were done we all sat and ate for ~30 minutes following. The rolls turned out to be delicious, and getting to sit down after class to enjoy the meal with your friends was a special touch. At that time we all ordered drinks and flights to pair with the sushi! The event was such a hit and my friends were so thankful for Melanie who made this all come to life for us.I can't wait to return to Saku and would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves sushi!
2019-06-08,5,my boyfriend and I came here for dinner last night. We ordered the yellowtail jalapeño roll and the japanese jeopardy which was very funny to watch my boyfriend try and eat some of the surprise spicy pieces. the food was decent but i have to say our server Emily was excellent. she made our experience so wonderful, she was attentive and very personable. she made our night, she's probably the reason why we would return. she made great recommendation and reminded us what actual wait service should be. thank you emily for a wonderful evening out - we will be back and will be sure to request her.
2019-06-08,5,Every time I come here, I always have a fantastic experience. From creative and delicious sushi creations to unique cocktails, this place is just a delight. Their brunch is also highly underrated (the sushi pizza is so freaking good!!! Trust me) and it's become the place that I always bring people new to Hoboken.The servers are fantastic and the right level of attentive.From a beautiful interior to beautiful and tasty food, you can't go wrong with this place.
2019-05-26,4,Very fresh, nicely cut and presented sashimi. Miso soup was a delight..
2019-05-26,5,Hidden sushi gem! My husband and I went twice in one week because we enjoyed the food and pricing.  Both times we ordered the sushi for 2 and felt it was enough food and a great value for the price.  The interior is so cute that we took some family from out of town on our second visit.  The interior is an instant wow with its Japanese Cherry blossom decor.  It was pretty easy to get a reservation both times. The service was average but we will be back again soon!
2019-05-25,5,Went again tonight and had another great experience, this time in the darker room with someone who hadn't been before. We got the gyoza and Saku roll that I had tried last time (consistently great) and tried the Japanese Jeopardy (so fun and according to my date, so hot..) and the Surf N Turf. 10/10! Expensive but a great date night, and we really love sushi. Can't get rolls like these anywhere else!
2019-05-25,5,I had the pleasure of having my birthday surprise brunch at Saku Hoboken last Saturday , May 18th ! A few of my friends planned a brunch coordinated by Melanie whom works there and they informed me that she made everything a smooth and amazing transition! When I arrived for my surprise party I was greeted and complimented by Melanie and she was beyond amazing the entire evening! From helping set up decor , to the wonderful ambiance and food presentations .. not to mention compliments to the chef because the food was amazing !! It has been quite some time since I have experienced such high quality customer service ! Melanie embodies legendary hospitality / customer Service . She was both pleasant and knowledgeable and ensured that everyone during the event was having a great time and enjoying themselves ! I didn't plan on doing much for my birthday this year and she definitely made it one to remember ! Will definitely be returning and recommending all my family and friends to patronize Saku Hoboken especially to experience Melanie and her flawless , top quality services ! See you in June !
2019-05-17,5,My boyfriend and I come here often. Best sushi in hoboken! The owner's sake knowledge is also very impressive.
2019-05-09,5,BEST SUSHI SPOT IN HOBOKEN. By far. I've been a handful of times and haven't had the chance to write a review. Admittedly my boyfriend and I only sit at the bar - but why would I want to sit anywhere else when Matt and Alyssa are so amazing? Best bartenders. It does get busy in there, and even though they're slaving away making complex cocktails for the whole restaurant, they still manage to check-in with the bar and make sure everyone is set with every step of the meal. I genuinely look forward to our date nights at Saku. I've had every roll and you can't go wrong - but the best is by far the surf and turf. Unique, complex and delish.Saku is the best addition to uptown Hoboken to come along in a while.
2019-05-02,5,I'll start off by saying that I love the decor and vibe at Saku Hoboken.  The philly cheese steak gyoza was absolutely incredible! This place has a great staff and awesome food. Melanie is seriously the best ever. Make sure you sit in her section. We are obsessed with her!!! Also, the food is super fresh. Hard to find fresh sushi in this area - you can't beat it though! Love the playlist too. Really cool place. Coming back a thousand times over!!
2019-05-02,5,I've been here twice now. Both times having an excellent experience. The food is so yummy! The decor ON BOTH SIDES, while very different vibes, are awesome. One is fun, bright, floral, and chic. The other is darker, more sleek, and straightforward. The service is always really good too. Music and atmosphere are the best! I also love the plating and presentation of drinks and food here. Great spot! Highly recommend.The Gyoza variations are insane. Also, the sushi is ALL good. But get the dessert because  amazinggggg. I also recommend the avocado Kani salad and Shishito bombs.
2019-04-26,5,Came here for the first time on a Sunday for their cocktail tasting event and some sushi. It was fantastic. The food is delicious, I had the death by hamachi and my boyfriend had the wagyu burger, both were amazing. Personally, need to go back for that burger. I also love the decor/vibes, I could easily see myself hanging out on a Friday night or going back for another Sunday brunch. Highly recommend. I wish I could go more often but living in LIC, two rivers is a tough...
2019-04-26,4,Wonderful ambience and service! Ordered the Drop the beet and roll which was the only Vegetarian option on the menu and it was delicious. Highly recommend the garlic edamame and the Shishito pepper appetizers. They had live music in the restaurant side which added to the cool vibe.
2019-04-22,4,Updated review: After a disappointing first experience, I came back to give Saku a second chance, and was glad I did. We started with the fried cauliflower and garlic edamame, both of which were excellent and I would highly recommend. We then split the jeopardy roll and the fire roll, which was a special that night. They were both good and fresh, although the fire roll was very spicy, to the point where it kind of overpowered the jeopardy roll. The service was very good, from our server to the managers. Overall, I would definitely come back to Saku again.
2019-04-22,5,Hands down the best sushi in Hoboken. Not only are the rolls creative and delicious, but they are always FRESH! Amazing wine list and drinks and the atmosphere is so fun. Definitely would recommend - you won't want to get sushi from anywhere else.
2019-04-14,3,Fresh fish but the rice was just a big nooo. The flavor and texture was so wrong for sushi. This proves that Hoboken cannot have good sushi. Stick to the tartare that was good and the food was decent but stay away from the sushi.
2019-04-13,5,I would definitely recommend this place it's amazing and out beautiful bartender Melania took great care of us makes amazing cocktail.. definitely coming back
2019-04-11,5,I cant say enough amazing things about this place! I have been living in Hoboken for almost 4 years now and have never found a sushi place that I truly loved. I tend to be a bit of a sushi snob and was sooo excited when i heard about this spot. Not only is the restaurant absolutely beautiful, but the sushi is the best in Hoboken! Everything is very fresh and super unique. The menu items are all really different and sooo good. I've been several times since they opened a few months ago and have had a great experience every time from the service to the food. Don't skip out on the guac is extra roll and their new brunch menu!
2019-04-07,2,Pros:-Really cool decor with a "good vs evil" type of theme. One half of the restaurant is painted white with cherry blossoms hanging from the ceiling, and the other half is painted black with paintings of samurais.-The music, although a bit loud, was a great selection of 90s throwback hip hop.Cons:-The service was seriously subpar, especially when considering the price point of the venue. Our waiter, Matthew, was unpleasant and even outright rude at times. He also wasn't attentive, as we had to flag him down to order food and remind him about drink orders we had already put in. -The specialty rolls were good, but tasting the Uni and Toro sushi made me skeptical of the overall freshness and quality of the fish (and the $17/roll price point!). Overall, subpar experience that wasn't worth the money.
2019-04-07,4,Had a very enjoyable dinner here. It's a trendy spot that Hoboken needed. The furikake fries and shishito bombs were both delicious. I liked all three sushi rolls that we ordered as well. It is a little pricey but I did t think it was outrageous. Overall I think it's a great addition to Hoboken.
2019-04-04,4,This is a great quick fix for asian fusion when you're craving it. Things to get: duck tacos, furikake fries, and pick your favorite sushi roll. Don't look for authenticity, but for flavor here. The duck was super tender and the fries tastes crispy on the outside and the inside was like a warm hug in your mouth. Sushi? Nothing to write home about but if you're craving some, it'll definitely satisfy your tastebuds.
2019-04-03,3,Very good sushi with NYC prices. Pros:Melanie was our bartender. She was very professional, personable and helpful! She is great at her job. She made the night. My friend and I went on a Tuesday which is "flight night".  A taste of 3 wines for 15 dollars. We started with the Garlic edamame which is sweet and spicy, which I strongly suggest. Then we ordered 2 specialty rolls - Salmon Poke - pretty good and the One and Only Roll (DELISH!) and we shared a fried rice. Melanie told us there is duck in the rice, just in case we do not eat poultry (I am a pescatarian, so that was great of her to say)  so I went for the vegetarian option. That fried rice was OFF THE HOOK! Kind of obsessed.Cons:The wait:There was a sushi class - so it took almost an hour for us to get our meal.  Melanie was just as surprised at our wait. So I would strongly suggest the staff and the patrons are forewarned that if there is a class, you will wait a painful amount of time for 2 sushi rolls and a bowl rice.It was good food, but not an hour wait, good. The price:Edamame2 specialty rollsOne fried rice2 flights2 glasses of wine124 dollarsCome on, now.
2019-04-02,5,My girlfriend brought me here for my birthday and we had a blast! Great cocktails and fried rice was amazing. They had live music which was a great touch. Definitely going back next week
2019-03-31,5,Had such a fun time here for girls night , one of the best burgers I've ever had in my life , amazing creative apps and cocktails, Salmon avocado roll was great . Good vibesss
2019-03-31,1,Don't even bother stopping by. We called in advance for a reservation for brunch. They said to come over, no need for a reservation.When we arrived shortly after, they said there were two private events going on and that they couldn't seat us.  Service is as important as food quality.
2019-03-23,5,Excellent restaurant.  Some of the best sushi in Hoboken.  Highly recommend the surf and turf and the guac rolls.
2019-03-20,5,Finally a trendy sushi spot in Hoboken! The rolls are expensive, but they are filling and the quality of the fish is amazing. The menu is fun and creative and the atmosphere is the best in Hoboken. Definitely my new go to spot! I've been here 3 times now and am looking forward to going back .. favorite menu items so far: Jeopardy roll, surf and turf roll, weekly stir fried rice specials
2019-03-12,3,Lovely atmosphere, great cocktails, friendly & good service. But all that goes by the wayside when the food isn't great. If they did a menu revamp to include more sushi options, I might give it another go, but there are many better sushi options in town.
2019-03-11,5,Great tasting, fresh fish and creative menu options all around from appetizers to rolls to drinks. Plus great service and a modern, cool atmosphere
2019-03-10,5,Amazing ambiance, food and service!!! So happy this place opened in Hoboken. Has NYC vibes because it's so stunning and nice. Been here twice so far and will definitely be coming back. Best sushi in hobo!
2019-03-08,5,Best atmosphere in Hoboken. Yellow tail jalapeño appetizer is perfect. You would be ill advised to Not stop here and try it out. A perfect 10
2019-03-07,5,The atmosphere is better than any in the Hudson County area. Getting a lesson from Dan (one of the owners) about his sake selection is just the cherry on top. The sushi is fresh and melts right in your mouth. The cocktails are delicious. And to close off the trifecta- the price is more then fair. So good I went back the following night and sat at the bar! Note: Reservation is a must!
2019-03-01,5,Vibin atmosphere, amazing fresh quality sushi  Apps we picked weren't good, should have gotten the duck tacos or fried rice  looked good. The Japanese roulette rolls were so fun! Very impressed my G
2019-03-01,5,Definitely one of the best restaurants in town! Great vibes, creative and well executed food, and awesome cocktails. Perfect spot to bring your friends from the city.
2019-03-01,5,Saku blew me out of the water! Easily one of the best restaurants in Hoboken. The food, atmosphere, and are incredible. The vibe is fun with great music. I loved the shishito peppers. The menu and decor are so creative and well thought out. Highly recommend!
2019-02-25,4,Sat at the bar for dinner this weekend and had a great experience.  The bartender Matthew was really friendly and knowledgeable --we tried a few  cocktails and sake and ordered some rolls, including the Japanese Jeopardy. At 9pm they have live music which is always a plus!
2019-02-24,5,Thoroughly enjoyed my first sushi experience at Saku. Food was so delicious (I'm still thinking about their "drop the beet and roll"). The ambience and staff were great. I will definitely be heading back there ASAP.
2019-02-24,5,This place is a great addition to Hoboken. Atmosphere is great. Cool, trendy vibe. Live music was a very nice touch on a Saturday night. Menu was big with a lot to choose from. Cocktails and appetizers were delicious. Sushi was fresh. Staff pleasant. Absolutely worth giving it a try!
2019-02-22,5,My favorite spot in town for sushi.  Food is delicious, great selection of Japanese whiskey and the ambiance is on point.  Would definitely recommend.
2019-02-21,5,Came here for dinner on a Wednesday night, which was a themed 90's night. Upon being seated our waiter gave us cards to place 90's music requests in the restaurant. We started with the tuna tartare and homemade gyoza (and the happy hour wine of course). Both were delicious, and would definitely get the tuna tartare again, but next time I would skip the gyoza to try something else. For dinner we got the lox and loaded roll and the Japanese jeopardy roll. I would probably skip on the lox and loaded next time, however the Japanese jeopardy was fun to eat because one of the rolls (unknown to the consumer) is super spicy and the roll comes with a sweet, unfiltered sake shot to dull the spice in your mouth. We were sharing the rolls so it was fun waiting to see who was going to get the spicy piece. The service overall was great, from our waiter to the runners and bussers. The owner, Danny, was there and he was super nice and personable - checking on us and seeing if we got the spicy piece yet. I noticed he was going to different tables and making sure everyone was enjoying their meal. The only down side is that I wish they had a little bit more on the menu in terms of basic rolls to add to your meal.
2019-02-20,4,Came here on a Sunday nght to have dinner with a friend. Immediately seated and offered water by our waiter.Drinks were strong and innovative. "Memoirs of a Geisha" was a good drink for those who like whiskey. "Tokyo Rose" was refreshing and accompanied the meal well.Ordered the Garlic Edamame as an appetizer. Simple but addictive. The "Guac is extra" and "Salmon Poke" was unique and tasted fresh!Can't wait to return to try their other drinks and rolls! The place is definitely cramped between tables but it's definitely a romantic spot to bring someone
2019-02-20,5,Went here this weekend and loved it. The garlic edamame was the best! We went on Friday and there was a live singer. Very trendy and upbeat atmosphere this is what Hoboken has been needing. Can't wait to go back
2019-02-17,5,I'm disappointed in most Hoboken restaurants but this was a pleasant surprise. I don't even eat Japanese food but my husband wanted sushi so I said let's try it. Burger was incredible. Give it a shot if you haven't already!
2019-02-15,5,Hoboken has been in need of a good sushi restaurant and Saku has filled that void. The place is perfect for a date or night out with girlfriends. A+ cocktails and sushi rolls (my fav. is the Guac is extra roll). Added bonus because they have addicting appetizers (get the edamame!) and other items on the menu if you aren't in the mood for just sushi. Service was super friendly & quick. And I've ordered delivery from them a few times and it's been just as good as in the restaurant.
2019-02-14,5,Went for an early V-day dinner. Place was fairly busy yet service still came at an appropriate time even offering an apology. Japanese style decor with some modern metropolitan vibes. Music was set low enough to have a conversation but loud enough to hear.  Server offered us song reservation cards. It was 90s throwback night. Our songs came on within 2-3 songs of requesting which was nice. Cocktails range from standard names to even some with a little humor in them if you can find it. Well mixed, arrived fast so there was little wait unlike some uptown areas. Menu is minimal outside of standard choices but vast enough to try something different. Good if you're indecisive or get overwhelmed easy with a large menu. I had the raidens revenge cocktail, tequila drink with some spice in the aftertaste. Alcohol was still visible but hardly overpowering. My partner had red wine which was offered on their wine Wednesday menu. Just jumped straight to the sushi for two, which our serve explained its pretty much whatever the chef decides. Again easy for some who get overwhelmed or indecisive, but we were asked if we had preferences of what we did or did not want. Ours had a California roll, which generally I do not like, but the crab was far from overpowering and actually had a good flavor to it. What stood out was the poke roll. I forget exactly what was in it, but it was topped with salmon poke as you can imagine. That roll alone is worth me returning. Sushi for two was roughly 30 some odd pieces total plus miso soup to start. More than enough to satiate my hunger. Sushi wasn't ice cold like some places and very tender without any question to its freshness. Certainly a great spot uptown. Perfect for a date or evening meal with modern vibes. Will be sure to return.
2019-02-08,2,Waiting time is about an hour to sit. Or choose to sit at the bar for one hour real waiting time for a sushi roll. I am not exaggerating. Cocktail drinks are good. Ok atmosphere. Nicely decorated. Live music Fridays. Make sure you call for reservations for dinner, or wait an hour, or sit at the bar.
2019-02-07,5,Saku is the only higher quality sushi place in Hoboken. It's my go-to for delivery because prices are similar to other (lower quality) spots and it's very fresh. Death by Hamachi roll and tuna tartar app are bomb. Sushi takeout does not disappoint - quality was there and delivery timely. Hoboken needed a place like this.
2019-01-29,2,I ordered takeout from Saku and scheduled a time for pickup. When I arrived, with an Uber waiting outside, 10 mins past the time the food was promised, it still wasn't ready. They told me it would be ready in a few minutes but it was pretty obvious they were scrambling to make the food. I had to release my Uber and then spend more $$$ for another one because I didn't receive my food until ~27 mins past the scheduled time--on an order that cost about $50 for one person. Normally I'd forgive a newer place for this, but to be candid the sushi is really nothing impressive. I had the Spicy Tuna which was neither spicy or tasty and the Surf and Turf roll which was marginally better but nothing impressive considering it's price. The best things I had were the simple sushi pieces I ordered--can't say anything bad about those. The space is beautiful--I'll give them that, but I was hoping for a new place to order from that *isn't* Robongi. Unfortunately it doesn't look like I've found it yet...
2019-01-27,5,Great vibes, amazing cocktails, great service and better food! The decor is amazing! My friend and I ordered the Sushi for Two (chef's choice) and included a variety and a good bunch of sushi and sashimi. I recommend the Japanese Jeopardy for the brave souls (extra spicy piece). Will definitely be visiting again soon. Ideal for a date night or dinner with friends.
2019-01-27,4,Good ambience, music, service and drinks. Sushi is on the basic roll side. Gyoza appetizer lacked flavor and rolls had too much rice. Spicy hamachi roll and the speciality roll with cream cheese was good. A good change of pace from all the Italian restaurants in Hoboken but Sushi rolls are basic and commercial
2019-01-27,5,My boyfriend and I went to Saku last night for a Friday night date night. We started with the garlic edamame and Gyoza. Both appetizers were delightful! For the main course we had the guac is extra role and one and only role. Some of the freshest sushi I have ever had. If you like cocktails you must try the revenge drink- so amazing!  The wait staff was knowledgeable and very friendly! This is an incredible place for modern, trendy, fresh asian fashion fun. 5 stars!!
2019-01-26,5,Came to Saku for a family dinner with extended family so we were a large party.  We sat in the 'white' room which was perfect for us.  (Looking forward to sitting in the dark room when I come back with my girlfriends next week). Naturally we decided to dine family style and order some of everything to share.  Starting with the garlic edamame, yellowtail jalapeño, and tuna tartare, everything was delicious and fresh.  After ordering  platters with a variety of rolls for the table, duck tacos, gyoza and fries, we had to try one order of the wagyu burger.  So so good!  Loved all the creative choices on the menu. All so yummy! And last but not least, the sake was delicious!
2019-01-26,3,My lady friend and I were able to get a reservation at 7:00pm on Friday. We were seated very quickly with no wait in the back room. The ambience was very nice and the restaurant had a nice vibe that made you feel like you were in a new trendy place, which is what I prefer.It did take a while for the waitress to come over initially to take our drink order. Once she came over, she took our drink order and we ordered the yellowtail jalapeno as an appetizer along with a few a la carte sashimi (salmon, fluke, tuna). Once again, the food took a while to come out, but when it did it was very fresh and tasty. Drinks were also good, but a lot of ice, almost made you feel like you were not getting any alcohol, which I wanted after a long work week.After the waitress came back, we ordered two specialty rolls. Again, they took forever to come out. For us it was fine, because I was celebrating with my lady friend and was in no rush and wanted to spend quality time with her. With that said, the rolls were very good and fresh. It should also be mentioned that our waitress was very nice and informative, and kept telling us she would check on the status of our meal. She even let us sample the sake!!!! Overall, it is a nice place with good food. My issue was that it is overpriced without a doubt and the wait times for drinks and food are very long. May or may not be back, to be determined.Thanks,
2019-01-25,5,Saku is exactly what Hoboken needed! My friend and I went for dinner on a Thursday night and we were extremely pleased with the food, the service, and the atmosphere! It is a really cool and fun spot, feels very trendy and something we didn't have in any sushi places in Hoboken. We also went when there was live music which was a nice touch. We had reservations and were seated immediately. We ordered drinks and then got the duck tacos, the fries, and the garlic edamame as appetizers - all were fantastic! Then for our entree we shared the surf and turf specialty roll and our regular salmon avocado rolls. The surf and turf roll was OUTSTANDING! We liked it so much we had to order another one! The regular salmon avocado roll was great too. At the end of the meal, the owner came out and greeted us and even brought us a free dessert (which was awesome too!). We had such a great experience here and will absolutely be back! Thanks for a great night Saku!
2019-01-24,5,Best Sushi I've had in a long time!! Great atmosphere...service was fabulous!! It's a gem.  Went with a party of 15.  Highly recommend Saku!
2019-01-24,3,The Signature Rolls were hearty and very fresh! Basic B**** Rolls were reasonably priced and well prepared! Very neat feel indoors. Waitress took our $14+ drinks away from the table before we were finished...not good...only negative about our experience!
2019-01-21,3,I wanted to love Saku, but was disappointed by the food. We were given the choice to dine in the more well light, formal dining room or the trendier, darker light high-table sushi bar area. We opted to sit in the dark trendy room and were so excited for our Japanese meal to compliment the vibe. We ordered the lobster seaweed salad, garlic edamame and sushi for two that came miso soup. The salad was a glorified seaweed salad... I was expecting something unique and did not even notice any lobster... just a few strands of kani mixed in. The garlic edamame was tossed in a sweet and sour sauce and was also very underwhelming. Next came the sushi and all the fish tasted off. Fish portions were generous, but I would rather have better quality for smaller quantity of fish. The rice was sort of hard, not well flavored and cold. Great sushi starts with great rice. Service was the only redeemable factor. They continuously checked in on us and refilled our water at a minimum of 10 times during our meal. Overall, the restaurant image does not fit with the food that is being served here and its a shame! Prices are also excessive... $3 for bagged green tea! Each piece of sushi / sashimi was $4 a la carte, which is kind of pricey for the area and moreover the subpar quality. Don't think I will be back.
2019-01-18,5,Awesome food, delicious drinks! Received a very informative sake tasting also. Will definitely be back soon!
2019-01-18,4,Surprisingly enough, Hoboken had mediocre sushi spots up until Saku opened. It's definitely my top favorite in town -although pricier than your usual. Great vibe..perfect for date night or a social night out with your girls. My girlfriends and I sat at the bar. We ordered drinks and rolls. Since I'm allergic to shellfish I was very limited but I had my usual "basic b!tch rolls" lol The food was tasty and fresh! Our waitress was new and a little nervous but she was very sweet so we didn't mind! Staff was friendly as well. Only downside is food took over an hour and we each received our food 5 minutes apart. They are still new so definitely something to work on. Other than that, I'll definitely be stopping by again!
2019-01-17,5,Came here two weeks ago with some girlfriends and had such a great time. Perfect lighting where it's not bright but not too dark, the menus and chopsticks etc. were super cute so it looks like the restaurant is really thought out with the little details. The server was friendly and I really enjoyed their one cocktail I had (I don't remember the name, but I had a few!). I highly recommend the edamame - they include siracha on it, and the rolls were delicious. Also, there are vegan options on the menu, and the day we went they had a vegan item as one of the specials as well, so that is a definite plus. Finally, they had live music as well -  a guitar player, which was great. I will definitely come back.
2019-01-14,5,Was able to sneak in at 6:30pm on a Friday....  very cool vibe that makes you feel you're in an authentic space but w/ a trendy vibe.Service was prompt at the table and properly attentive even w/ a crowded load of customers.Had tuna tartar for appetizer and it did not disappoint.  For entree had the surf and turf and i think Boku roll (coconut shrimp-esque)....  both were delicious!Was also given an education on sake which I think they will be turning into a sake tasting/education event!!Overall loved this place and fills a Hoboken void for great asian cuisine!
2019-01-13,1,If I could give this restaurant a zero, I would! this was the worst establishment under all the criteria of: ambiance, environment, service and quality of food. We had an 8:15 reservation. Our waitress greeted us shortly after we sat and took our drink order, which was what we thought would be the beginning of a good experience. Albeit the crowd, the drinks took an unusually long time to arrive- I would say 15-20 minutes. When our waitress brought them, rather than taking our order, she walked away and we had to wave her over to let her know we were ready to order. We ordered the yellow jalapeño - yellowtail wrapped around cucumber, tuna tartare, two sushi rolls, cooked fish dish with request of a side of bok choy and lobster seaweed salad. When I say we waited until 9:45 to receive our food- all cold fish not requiring cooking... I kid you not! Our waitress avoided our table like the plague- we made blatant eye contact with her, she continued to come no where near our table. She did finally come over and said it should be out soon, and we put in our dessert order for dessert sushi at that time being that it was taking 1.5 hours to receive raw fish. The food FINALLY arrived and wow- what the actual F?!!!! Yellowtail jalapeño could have been more than 1 oz of fish, the sushi roll was abysmal. $15 for a roll that looks less than the quality of supermarket sushi. Not to mention- when there was 3 pieces of sushi left the manager came out to tell me they had forgotten avocado in the roll and asked if I wanted a side??? What???? Also, during the entire 1.5 it took them to prepare raw fish, they failed to inform us the bok choy was no longer that night until we reminded them we needed it. Because it took a year and a half to make raw fish, they brought out complimentary shots of god knows what and the dessert sushi. We didn't touch the shots and the dessert sushi was a JOkE no wonder they told us it would come out immediately- it was still frozen and disgusting.  Frozen date wrapped with chocolate and coconut, insanely small portion, disgusting for $10.Frustrated and hangry after dinner, we asked to speak to the manager merely to express our thoughts on the experience. We asked four different employees to speak to the manager and she actually did come over without ever telling us she was the manager- but rather to pour us water and she was actually the one who told me they forgot the avocado in the roll and asked if I wanted a side when it was almost completely eaten.Unreal!!! We finally went to the front and got her to come over and spoke our minds about this pitiful experience- where she continued to laugh at us. I demanded and refused to pay for any of our drinks instead of giving us the shitty shots and pay for our dessert. We left zero tip for our mia waitress and I truly cannot see this establishment lasting especially in a busy city. The staff really, really have a lot to learn. And yes, I have worked in the restaurant business as a server for many years prior- so it's glaringly obvious where the faults are.Two more things- after we complained we learned the two nearby tables to us had just complained as well. And the environment was painfully loud- you cannot have a conversation in there whatsoever.I will not even wish this place luck. Do yourself a favor and don't waste a single penny here or 1.5 hours waiting for shit food.
2019-01-13,3,The atmosphere is really cool and modern with a NYC feel in Hoboken. The food is decent...we weren't blown away. My biggest issue is the ridiculous wait they tell you when you walk in to make it appear there is much more demand than they really have. They told us an hour and a half and sat us in 15 minutes. There were five or six empty/unused tables around us during our entire meal. I watched as dozens of people left because they thought there was no way they would get a table. Very irritating.
2019-01-12,1,Had a reservation at 8:15, didn't get served our food until 9:45. The most frustrating part was the lack of communication from the waitress. Instead of telling us the status of our food, she was basically hiding. Not to mention when the food did come out, we find out that the kitchen ran out of Bok Choy and avocado for the one sushi roll that we ordered. Sad to say, not a good experience.
2019-01-12,5,Mr Dan Gray once again hits the nail directly on the head.   The mixture of trend and Japanese tradition makes this place a win from every angle.
2019-01-12,4,My husband, soon-to-be 3yr old, and I dined in their walk-in space. Our highlights included the chef's omakase selections, Japanese beer choices, market fried rice (devoured by my little), and duck tacos. We appreciated Dan's personable nature and could tell he upholds high expectations for his team. Looking forward to our next visit. Go now!
2019-01-11,5,Exactly the type of sushi spot Hoboken needed uptown. The place has a great decor and ambiance. To the left is a dark room with the bar, sushi bar and bar tables..to the right is a bright well lit dining room.There were four of us so that allowed us to try a lot of things on the menu to taste. Appetizers: Garlic edamame (delicious!) I could've ate it all by myself. We also ordered shishito peppers which came with a spicy mayo for dipping - also good. Duck tacos - this was my favorite app, 2 tacos so fairly small portion but very delicious.  Pork belly also good, for the bacon lovers. And lastly we got the lamb gyoza which was a special they night. Nothing disappointed here.Rolls: "Gauc is extra" Roll - spicy tuna/guacamole/puck de Gallo??? Who woulda thought of combining these items? But it worked out great (that was my second favorite roll).Surf & Turf - self explanatory and also tasty. Boku Roll - shrimp tempura and avocado - very good. Now here is where this place really won me over...MAKE YOUR OWN ROLL. Why don't more sushi places do this??? Obviously this was my favorite roll since I made it...Spicy tuna/avocado inside. Topped with yellowtail/crabmeat & crunch. Add siracha and spicy mayo and Boom! Best roll you'll ever had.Overall this restaurant was a great experience from the ambiance to the food and the service. We will definitely come back.
2019-01-10,5,This place is amazing! the food was amazing, everything tasted amazing.  they have a cocktail list with lots of unique drinks.  our server was friendly and gave us some of his favorites /recommendations. will be back again
2019-01-09,5,My first visit to Saku was about a week ago and i've been twice since! It's a new restaurant, only about a month old and it seems like they're already doing amazing! They're well put together and have a great menu for such a young restaurant. Their service was very attentive and were able to give us suggestions based on what we said we liked- something I test often. We ordered a basic roll (which they said they can make anything requested) and the Big Daddy and Surf n' Turf roll. The Big Daddy was delicious with eel, but the Surf n' Turf was DELICIOUS. I'm a small person and usually can't eat that much but I was ready to order more when we were done. As for the atmosphere- I always look for restaurants that offer the FEEL as well as the food. They're clever with the concept of Yin and Yang (a dark and a light room) and they play music and offer decor to match the overall feeling of each. Very cute and very homey. Overall I would definitely recommend giving Saku a visit! They're not your basic sushi restaurant and they offer creative and artistic sushi as well as your basics, and for the non-sushi fans they offer a handful of delicious dishes like wagyu burgers or chicken and waffles, or even your basic surf and turf. Give Eddie and Bridget behind the sushi bar a shout out they were great! Super funny.
2019-01-08,5,Stopped by here for a belated birthday dinner for my girlfriend and let me tell you the experience was incredible!  The sushi was DELICIOUS we did the sushi for 2 omakase and every piece of sushi was tender and melt in your mouth and the rice was cooked perfectly.  Also the surf and turf roll was one of the best/ most creative pieces of sushi I've ever had.The drinks were equally amazing I had the master splinter and house of the rising sun and my girlfriend Samurais widow and the kraken and both sets of drinks were AMAZING! The flavors in each cocktail complimented each other beautifully and everything tasted sublime.  Last but not least the service was unbelievable! I don't know what other people here are talking about our waitress Tessa was funny, interactive and very attentive as were the managers and staff.  Everything came out quickly and when we inquired about the sake they sent someone out to explain the difference between all of them and really give us a lesson in sake 101.  I will DEFINITELY be back and next time with friends and a group! Highly recommend!
2019-01-08,4,Saku Hoboken is a great addition to the Hoboken dining & bar scene.  It's a nice replacement to the formerly beloved Turtle Club and brings a new energy and much needed sush (and finally something other than Italian) to uptown Hoboken.  Came on a Saturday night without reservations at around 8:45 for a 4 top.  We were told it would be about an hour wait, but that wasn't a problem - luckily there were a couple seats at the sushi bar where our foursome wanted to get some appetizers and grab a drink.  So it seems the right/ white room has reservation seating while the left/dark room is first come first served. We just received our drinks and ordered the appetizer at 9:00 and yay a table was available for us.  Potential hour wait was reduced to only 15 minutes. Have to say the drinks are actually really quality and the names of the drinks are kitschy, just how I like it.  I ordered the kracken drink ( I forget the actual name), but it had squid ink in it: it was perfect but I was surprised that is wasn't really black, just kind of had a gray tinge. For the 4 of us, we ordered the sushi for 2 and a few rolls.  I thought the quality of the first was fairly good, but I actually prefer the fish to be a little firmer than it was served.  My favorite bite of the items we ordered is the Poke roll - there was so much flavor packed in there - totally tasted like a poke bowl.  Downer is the sushi for two (8 sushi pieces, 4 kinds of sashimi, California roll & a special roll) definitely wouldn't be enough food if that's all my husband and I ordered (we are perpetually hungry) - other sushi spots definitely serve more in the "for two" dishes... and at $60+, it's also a bit on the pricier side.   The special roll they provided as part of the sushi for two was their coconut shrimp roll - which was basically shrimp tempura with some coconut flakes - I wasn't impressed with this roll, the tempura wasn't as crunchy as I wanted and, while I'm not a coconut fan, I couldn't really taste any coconut in this roll - if there's coconut, shouldn't it taste like coconut?Overall I had a nice time at Saku.  It was a fun night out and I definitely enjoyed the live music.  I wonder what the vibe is like there late night because at the time we were leaving (almost 11pm) there were a few people at the bar in the white room, but it didn't seem like any more people were filtering in for drinks.
2019-01-04,5,First, let me start off with the fact that I don't agree with some of the reviews. I've gone on a few occasions (date night and girls night) and I LOVED saku! The decor and vibe is definitely on point! Everyone is always extremely friendly and the sushi was by far the best in hoboken!  Some of the reviews say it tastes like "shop rite sushi" but I've never found that to be the case. My absolute favorites are the death by hamachi, surf n turf, colorful roll, and the gauc is extra.If you aren't a huge sushi fan, try some of the non-sushi options like the lamb, burger or steak!  My husband had the burger and said it was the best burger he ever had. The cocktails are very unique. I recommend the Bobba Fett, Samurai's Window or Master Splinter. We've always found our waiter/waitress to be ver knowledgeable and efficient. All in all, after a few dinners there, I highly recommend  saku as its a great place for a date night or a girls night out!
2019-01-02,2,Saku is beautifully decorated (read: Instagram/blogger friendly) and I love the idea of the yin/yang decor. I went with two friends for a girls night for dinner before the holidays and the overall experience was just okay. The atmosphere was very lively (read: loud) and is great for grabbing some drinks, although the drinks were very strange. I got the "Walking through the tea garden" drink which I expected to be a lighter whiskey drink with floral and citrus notes. It was served in a black glass and was blood red - interesting but I still enjoyed the taste. The drink my friend got was so strong she had to send it back.Our server was extremely quiet (could not hear or understand him in the loud atmosphere) and clearly didn't have the menu memorized as he had to get back to us with basic questions like "how many gyoza come in an order?" That said, the gyoza was quite small but very tasty. As for the sushi, it was definitely sub par for the price. They don't have basic rolls on the menu which is really strange for a sushi restaurant. I typically like to order a basic and a specialty roll but our server didn't seem knowledgeable enough to let us know that was an option. For a new place, they should be more forthcoming with what they can make.Overall, it was an okay place to grab drinks, but I would not come here for the sushi again.
2018-12-31,2,Saku is a trendy sushi joint that recently opened in Hoboken.  As a sushi enthusiast, I was excited to give this place a try.  PROS:  - Service was friendly and attentive- The trendy atmosphere is great for grabbing some drinks with friends in either of the two seating areas (darker lounge/bar area and the brighter dining room with the cherry blossom art)CONS:  - FOOD.  I had mixed feelings about our meal -- It seemed like some of dishes we ordered were either delicious (Tuna Tartare, Salmon Poke Roll) or inedible (Basic B-tch Rolls / most of the sushi).They don't disclose what basic rolls they have on their menu, but they assure you they can make most of them.  For a sushi restaurant, I was surprised to find out that they don't even serve shrimp tempura.  Instead, they have coconut shrimp rolls.  We gave it a try and it tasted like what you'd end up finding in the frozen food aisle...I would probably skip the sushi here (especially the basic rolls) as you are basically paying Morimoto prices, but getting the grocery store sushi taste.Overall, it seems like an okay place to grab drinks, but I would not come here for the sushi again.
2018-12-30,5,We decided to give Saku a try on a Saturday night. We made a reservation.  When we arrived we were sat in the dark room with great atmosphere and music. The waiter was attentive and informative. When the food started to come out, each dish was excellent in taste and presentation.   We tried all the specialty rolls and the majority of the appetizers. Everything was very good.The specialty cocktails are great. The Boba drink was very tasty and the boba bubbles were a pleasant surprise. I would suggest anybody to this restaurant. There really is something for everyone.
2018-12-29,1,Really wanted to like this place since we were sad to see Turtle Club go from this location.  The food was terribly over-Americanized and the sushi was not good.  There are many sushi Japanese & Sushi spots in Hoboken with way better quality for half of the cost.  For drinks, they have specialty cocktails, where are all $14.  They were very much watered down and finally served almost 15 minutes after ordering them.  The wait service was mediocre at best.  Overall, this has to be one of the most disappointing experiences in a long time in Hoboken and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  Hopefully management will quickly realize that they need a change (and a fast one).
2018-12-26,5,I was very excited to try Saku after following their grand opening on Instagram - however, I was hesitant to try it after reading the dozens of mixed reviews on Yelp.My fiancé is a picky eater so I was pleasantly surprised with the menu. We order a Japanese beer, the Samuri's Widow (alcoholic fruit punch), garlic edamame, pork belly, Colorful roll, Surf n Turf roll, and Salmon Poke roll. The garlic edamame tasted more like honey chili glazed. They gave us a generous helping we couldn't stop eating. The pork belly was good, crispy, but not memorable compared to the sushi. The rolls were fresh from the fish to the rice. They were perfectly formed and delightfully paired. I would not listen to the other reviews here. If you are looking for a fun, new Asian restaurant to try for a date night or dinner with the girls I definitely recommend.
2018-12-21,3,Walking into the restaurant was the most exciting part of the night, vibe was exactly what we were looking for. We sat at the bar waiting for our table, and the expectedly pricey drinks were well made. When our table was ready and we sat down to eat, that's when things took a turn. The sushi was sub par and did not meet my expectations. Rice was sticky and the fish was chewy. The rolls we ordered all sounded great, but the finished product did not deliver. I've lived in Hoboken for four years and have had better fish at most other places. That said, the overall look and feel of the restaurant was spot on and I'd give it another try for the other food, but won't have the sushi again anytime soon.
2018-12-21,3,Let me start out by saying I REALLY wanted to like this place. Hoboken needed a trendy sushi spot offering great drinks/good atmosphere. Unfortunately, the experience did not meet our expectations. While we waited, we ordered a drink at the bar, felt like we were at a trendy NYC restaurant. The drinks were really good ($14), the bartender was attentive. Once we sat down, we ordered some sushi and special rolls, and when it arrived I was SO disappointed. This place has so much potential to be amazing, but the sushi tasted like grocery store sushi- where the rice is hard, chewy, and the fish didn't taste fresh. I've heard their non-sushi menu is good, but I would never order their sushi again. Overall, they need to invest in a better food vendor, or switch to Asian fusion all together - and asap or they are going to lose credibility.
2018-12-17,5,The food was great. The quality of the fish was spot on. I had Eddy make a baked scallop California roll and it was pure FIRE. And Dave behind the bar was a great guy. Can make some amazing drinks and had good conversation. Be sure to check it out.
2018-12-17,5,Awesome place. The decor is so beautiful. Very nice ambiance!! The service was great! The waiters and waitresses checked in on us periodically to make sure everything came out on time and we enjoyed everything.I really like the tuna tartar, the edamame was very good and we had 6 or 7 rolls between 4 people and they were all delicious. This will be our new sushi date night spot. Also great with kids. We brought our 5 month old baby with us. There was room for the stroller and the benches were nice and comfortable to sit with the baby.
2018-12-17,5,Finally an upscale sushi spot in Hoboken that delivers both quality food and ambiance in a bro-free environment!!  The cocktail menu is elaborate.  The service was excellent.  Looking forward to my next dinner at Saku.
2018-12-16,1,My wife and I were so excited about this new restaurant (even invited out-of-town friends). In a market oversaturated with Italian restaurants having a new sushi restaurant uptown was very exciting. The place has nice decor and is hip compared to other Hoboken digs. They put a lot into the decor and that is the only thing I will give them (albeit the original turtle club tiles are a bit of a mismatch). The food on the other hand was TERRIBLE. We got served bland, bland, with a side of bland. I could go into the individual dishes but it's not even worth it. We also ordered two dishes that they had run out of and the kitchen decided they would just substitute them without asking us.  Think red snapper for salmon and coconut shrimp for tempura shrimp.I honestly would prefer no ambiance and great food, they took the opposite stance. They should visit Orale uptown to see how a restaurant can deliver on both promises. Like the other real reviews, don't pay for overpriced below average sushi here. I hope they can turn it around but it truly has porter collins written all over it.
2018-12-15,1,Won't be trying this place after I looked at the menu - 'bitch rolls'?? Really?  I'm a local who eats out 2-3 times per week and can find at least one sushi place here that doesn't feel the need to risk offensive language.  Unfortunate that it looks super cute inside and out.
2018-12-15,5,Hoboken needed this! Finally a great sushi place with nice ambience, perfect for nights out. We went last night and had an awesome experience. The signature rolls are very different than the usual suspects and so are the drinks! I highly recommend the garlic edamame (as others have) as well as the lobster seaweed salad as starters. As for the rolls, all were delicious so it's hard to pick a favorite. We will definitely be back!
2018-12-09,5,Loved this restaurant! Decorated beautifully! The food was delicious! I will definitely be adding this to my go to list!
2018-12-09,5,Awesome sushi and great atmosphere! Owners are super friendly. Love the drink menu as well! Also I was weirded out by the name of the avocado cheesecake but it was amazing! Definitely would recommend
2018-12-08,3,I'm giving this place three stars because the service was great, if this were only based on food I would have given it less. I was hoping that it would be my new go-to sushi spot, but it really wasn't anything special. There were only about five special rolls options, and then some sashimi choices as well. I got the Big Daddy roll (lobster tempura with eel on the outside) and the lobster was so overcooked and chewy I could only eat two pieces of my roll. My bf ordered salmon sashimi which he liked (at $4 a piece), and also the yellowtail special roll. The yellowtail was OK but you can get much fresher fish at a cheaper rate somewhere else in town. I might be back to try the entrée dishes and grab some drinks, but definitely never coming back here for sushi.
2018-12-08,2,Overpriced and underwhelming. Drinks were great but the rice on the sushi wasn't even cooked properly. It was very sticky and the food didn't have much flavor. Staff was attentive but overall not the best experience for what was paid.
2018-12-07,5,This is the sushi spot Hoboken has been asking for. And it's the sexy spot uptown Hoboken has been asking for. As a self-proclaimed sushi snob, I can honestly say that the quality of fish is insane (and by leaps and bounds the best I've had in Hobo) and you can even bring your non-sushi eating friends here for some seriously delicious bites. I ate the burger before I could take a picture, but all I can say is wow! Overall the vibe is sexy and fun. Our servers have been so pleasant and the music always is always on point. You can tell the attention to detail --from the crystal soy sauce containers to the presentation on each plate. Though this place is new, I've already been twice and each time it gets better. Really excited to have this spot in the neighborhood. It's a welcome addition and have a feeling it's here to stay. Already planning my future date nights and girls nights.
2018-12-07,5,Ever since a vacation involving the best sushi ever, I have been looking for a local place that matches those flavors. I've tried every restaurant with a similar cuisine in Hoboken and a lot in the city, and was thrilled when Saku opened nearby! We went in on the second night after the grand opening and walked into the busy crowd we were expecting on a Friday night. The staff quickly took our name and, as hungry as we were, I was instantly distracted by the beautiful decor (the murals are incredible and every detail from the tiling to the greenery in the bathrooms really makes you feel like you are somewhere exotic) and the cocktail menu. The flavors in the Boba Fett drink were amazing- try it! I was most impressed with how the staff seemed like they had been working at Saku for years. Most restaurants take months to find a rhythm, but the Saku team already worked flawlessly together and clearly knew the menu inside and out. The garlic edamame was worth the cost (for anyone thinking it's high for edamame) and we got our money's worth because we were dipping everything in the sauce for the entire meal. We also had two of the rolls (spicy tuna and the Big Daddy) and the lobster seaweed salad. All were very good and fresh! I highly recommend. Side note- for anyone who loves "insta-worthy" food, drink and decor, this is definitely the place for that! Even the fruit, flowers and garnishes for the drinks (we sat at the bar) were beautiful.
2018-12-04,1,My pictures look a lot better than it tastes. First we had the edamame and duck tacos, the duck was gamey but barely made an appearance in the tortilla which confused me and the edamame was $9 which is criminal, I was expecting some great mystical appetizer for this price but no standard edamame you can get at the food store. We ordered each 2 rolls each. Our meal was $93 for everything - we had no drinks, and we left hungry. Don't waste your time, order Asia Sushi at home or go to Illusion.
2018-12-02,3,Ok, where to start. I'd like to take you through my entire experience from beginning to end. I too went on the 2nd official opening night. Entrance- I was meeting my friend and thought she beat me there. As soon as I walked in, 3 people were at the host desk and said hi in unison which was a little overwhelming. The host area is super dark so it was hard to see. I asked if my friend was there and they took me to the pink room and just stopped. My friend wasn't there. The host/hostesses are not the best listeners. I asked for a table for 2 but was told it would be a 5-10 minute wait so we went to the bar. They also didn't seem too pleased or eager to seat us. The host/hostess never asked our names btw. We tried the dark room but the bar area was a bit awkward and more of a sushi bar lounge area so we went to the other bar area. Once we walked in we noticed that there were plenty of 2-tops available and nothing looked reserved. But my friend and I just patiently waited at the bar and ordered a drink. We waited a few and were never approached by the host/hostess to be seated and those tables went unoccupied for the majority of our stay... that was a little weird too... we looked around and it was apparent that we were the only minorities there which for me made me a bit uncomfortable. But judging on the welcome brigade when you walk in... if I wasn't starving and eager to give this place a chance I would have certainly left based on the expected wait/no follow up. Anywho.... we sat at the bar in the back/pink room. The bartender was very kind but you can tell very busy. Other staff would interrupt him in the middle of him speaking to us which I thought was a bit rude. But he would quickly apologize and continue speaking with us. Ok... the meal.... we order the Garlic Edamame, the octopus carpaccio as a start. When that came out the presentation was pretty. The edamame was a little undercooked for my liking but the flavors were great. The Octopus Carpaccio was a little gummy but it was pretty good until I found a plastic tab in my meal. That was a bummer. I immediately stopped eating it and told the bartender. He told the manager and everyone was very very very apologetic. A little overkill but it seemed like they really cared. I debated putting this in my review but because it happened and it was part of the experience I decided to keep it honest. They explained it was the first week and are still working out some kinks... which plastic container tabs would be a terrible error to continue happening.  Anywho.. they apologized and made sure to take items off the bill. Still, I stayed and gave them the benefit of the doubt. We order 3 sushi rolls. The Big Daddy Roll, the Spicy Tuna, and a Dragon Roll that was off-menu. Let me start with saying that these rolls were all excellent. The tuna roll had guacamole and pico de Gallo which added a twist of heat and flavor. The other two specialty rolls were very well made and tasted yummy. Throughout the course of the meal the owner kept stopping by to make sure we were ok as did the bartender. It was nice and I understand why they did it but we were fine.  The manager did stick around for a bit and we chatted him up about his vision for this place, expectations and growth of the menu. He was very forward in telling us what he was envisioning and what his expectations were. It was nice. He was very nice and attentive. After our meal was done and our drinks were drank... we headed out. Not until later in the night did I remember that I forgot my bag there. I went back in and asks the host/hostess and they don't really listen and tell me to look at where I was sitting. Another server saw me looking asked me questions and sent me back to the host. I explained that I explained this to the host table and they told me to look for myself. So it was a bit frustrating. Also, in going back, the familiar and nice faces were no longer familiar or nice. I felt like an annoyance going back and people were just trying to get ride of me. I went back to the host stand... and my bag was there the whole time. Long story not so short... I'm willing to go back and give it a try and hopefully update my review. I hope to see a more diverse clientele next time I go as well. I say if you like supporting neighborhood eateries and miss the turtle club, give it a try. The prices are slighted NYC prices.... at least the cocktails are but maybe in time they will adjust for the location... who knows. I will say, the pink room is beautiful and bright and if you remember the Turtle Club at all... it was very dark... it is a nice change for the location. And the glassware/tabletop ware is gorgeous. I will certainly give this place a second chance as I hope it succeeds. I would just say to the owner, make sure your hostess/host are making everyone feel welcomed.
2018-12-01,5,My heart was broken when Las Olas closed last year but this place has more than filled the void. First of all, the cocktails are amazing and unique - highly recommend the Kraken (And I'm not usually a cocktail drinker). Next, I literally want to bathe in whatever the magic sauce is they use on their edamame (a must order). The fries, sushi, shishito peppers, EVERYTHING was delicious. The space is beautiful and the owner is a gem - he went above and beyond to ensure a fantastic experience. This place just opened (a whopping 3 days ago) so they are still working out minor kinks getting the food out but definitely worth the wait and so happy to have them in the neighborhood!
2018-12-01,5,Super cute restaurant decor and sexy vibes! Perfect for a date night or dinner with the girls. Highly recommended!
2018-11-30,5,HANDS DOWN best sushi spot in Hoboken! From service to sake and everything in between, these guys have it down to a science. Hospitality is always number one in my book and the staff is beyond accommodating in every way, even offering items from their amazing omasake bar menu to our table just to make our bellies extra happy. Try the fresh scallops and yellowtail jalapeño to start, finish with the waygu burger. Will be back ASAP!!
2018-11-30,5,Saku is breath taking! The place is absolutely gorgeous, staff is super friendly and caring! Drinks are delicious and very interesting, my favorite was "boba fett". The food is tasty, creative and non expensive- tuna tartar ir to die for.
2018-11-30,5,Obsessed with the surf and turf roll as well as the pork belly. Absolutely delicious. Their cocktails are so unique. I suggest the "Tokyo Rose" cocktail, my favorite by all means. The staff is so wonderful, engaging and very knowledgeable. The aesthetic is beautiful and so intimate, date night ready for sure. Already booked my next reservation!
2018-11-30,5,Saku provides hoboken a new restaurant with higher end Japanese food. There is a little of everything on the menu for both food and drinks. The sake menu had a great variety of quality sakes. The sushi and kitchen menu had a good selection of Japanese cuisines. Also the set up was very intimate.
2018-11-29,3,If you're looking for a new sushi restaurant and you truly and honestly enjoy fish sushi - this place is not for you. They have a few special sushi rolls and a list of nigiri/sashimi options, but ultimately I wouldn't call this a sushi restaurant. We came on official opening night around 5:30pm. The hosts (2 female and 1 male) were incredibly judgemental as we entered the restaurant as we we're given blank stares like we were in the wrong place. They didn't welcome us to the restaurant until we asked for a table for two (keep in mind that it was incredibly awkward when we did). And you know the vibe that people give you when they think you don't belong? Yeah, the hosts gave us that vibe. But we did enjoy our server and water server!! They were great and kind I will say that their white fish ceviche and their unfilitered sake isn't bad, but I think that's at most what we enjoyed. We ordered two scallop sushi and two uni sushi, one Big Daddy Roll, one Colorful roll, and one surf and turf roll and found them mostly mediocre. We also ordered their dessert roll since that seemed to be popular, but it was honestly ehh. It definitely tasted like it was frozen overnight and the green tea version was not that great. I will say that their uni tasted fresh and that's a pretty big accomplishment! One of my biggest pet peeves is not having my water cup refilled consistently, but they always filled my water cup - love that! I did think it was pretty cool that the owner was serving a few select customers, but other than that - we most likely won't come back because we love sushi and we think we can find a better option elsewhere. We also just never had such a bad experience with hosts before, so that kind of bummed us out.
2018-11-29,5,Want to thank DG and the rest of the Saku family for inviting me to their newest restaurant last night!  The presentation is a delight to ones eyes and the sushi was so fresh! I highly recommend the tuna tartar!! Kudos to the design team...all around perfection. Anthony Carrino @lightpinklace The art work, done by @christianmasot is unbelievable! His attention to detail can be seen throughout the paintings! Really nice work!!  @ Hoboken, New Jersey
