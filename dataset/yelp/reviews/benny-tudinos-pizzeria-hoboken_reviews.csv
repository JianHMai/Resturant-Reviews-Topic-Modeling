2021-11-08,2,I'm gonna give you my opinion right off the bat and tell you that it's so-so. After many years of seeing and hearing about this place, I finally decided to give it a try. I stopped in on a busy Friday night and ordered a quick couple slices to-go, and a few minute wait and being handed a box of what was supposed to be 3 (huge) slices later, I was on my way. Unfortunately, I made a mistake not checking that box before I left as I was only given two of the three slices I had ordered and paid for but by that point I had already made the hike back to my friend's place and wasn't going back out . Mishap aside, the pizza, as I prefaced before, was so-so. Not the worst, but for sure was a bit undercooked with a lot of flop, the sauce was just ok, and the cheese was standard. The slices are huge which is a fun gimmick, but overall not much to say beyond that. Would I eat again? Sure, but would I go out of my way? Probably not.
2021-10-23,4,A slice of pizza is definitely big, ordered two slices. Boy was I full.  I just wished the pizza was a little hotter for it seemed to be just warm.
2021-10-05,5,Best slice in Hoboken and surrounding areas. It has been a favorite of mine since they opened many year's ago. And it hasn't changed a bit. A must every time I am near 7th/8th ave & Washington street.
2021-09-27,1,Would give zero stars if I could. Ordered a personal pie, penne with vodka sauce, lobster ravioli, and 2 sodas. Food was delivered there was only one soda and there was no penne with vodka. I called back to ask nicely if they had forgotten the other parts of order because I would've gone back to get it and the guy on the phone would just scream  "I gave it to the delivery guy"  over and over and that I need to take it up with them. Funny thing was the delivery guy was standing right next to me and I was looking into his delivery box there was nothing. And to top it all off when I decided to eat the lobster ravioli...it WASNT even lobster ravioli it was just normal cheese ravioli. Never again.
2021-08-23,1,Horrible. The pizza was nasty. The sauce has no taste and was super soggy. My pizza tasted like bread and tomato. That's not what pissed me off the most, the fact that the waitress was talking over my food with no mask on!!!! Are we not in the middle of a damn pandemic?!? Why is she speaking over my food and having spit droplets land all over this sh$t you call pizza?!? They need to be shut down. Praying I didn't catch Covid while trying to enjoy bread with sauce.
2021-08-19,1,Been a faithful customer for 20 years.  Finally fed up with the terrible attitude that I receive on the phone when I place orders.  Today was the final straw.  Kid was literally yelling at me because he didn't like that I asked if they were still delivering food.  In what world does a paying customer have to accept that from a restaurant that they wish to order food from.  Peace out.  Calling Giovannis, always nice to customers there!
2021-08-02,1,Non existent customer service, rude, terrible attitude, opportunistic, and the pizza is whatever. If I wanted so-so pizza I would at least hope that it wasn't served with a side of nasty attitude. They don't wear masks/ gloves to serve the pizza. They are cash only. Same person that handles all the cash is touching all the pizza. Eat here at your own risk. I will be taking my business literally anywhere else on my next trip to Hoboken.
2021-08-01,4,Pizza was very large and was 4.50 It tasted very good but I wish they had more sauce on it.
2021-07-30,1,Terrible pizza, horrible costumer service. Stole our money. I don't care they can keep it but just getting the word out there
2021-07-27,5,So I love this place it's no secret. The reason is the perfectly cooked and seasoned pizza. Huge slices at a great price. The rest of the food is also as amazing and the service well it's the service it's Jersey expect a little Jersey spice of attitude. The place is busy do everyone a favor review their menu online and don't waste time ordering and you'll get along fine. You have to try this pizza it's a class unto itself. Most important it's consistently good.
2021-07-27,5,Love a must see when you are in Hoboken!! Each slice amounts to 2 and 1/2 of the normal sized!
2021-07-17,5,We had the best lunch here today! 8 in our party. Pizza to die for and the best Greek salad. Tammy was our server & she was fantastic and treated us like we were in her home.
2021-07-10,4,I thought the pizza was delicious. It was not as big as I expected or as it's promoted. It was like just any other slice of pizza you can find anywhere else. I'm not sure if they became smaller because of the whole Covid thing but I was kind of expecting more in terms of size. The flavor was excellent though
2021-06-17,3,First time back in a while and some things have changed. Pizza has barely any cheese on, and since the slice is too big, most of the slice is crust and little to no cheese. I would give a try once again to see how it goes.
2021-06-02,5,Best slice in Hoboken IMHO . Cash only but when its pizza its a way of life. Monster slices, great topping portions. Great chicken parm sandwich.  Rolling rock on hand and clutch service.
2021-05-19,3,Very annoying that this joint is CASH ONLY. To have a decent meal here costs at least $60+. Who the hell carries cash these days anymore?!?!  Even street vendors take cc man. If you wanna keep cheating on your taxes, by all means. I sat outside and ordered $14 crispy calamari. It was good but definitely not worth $14 bucks Jfc. Also got a personal pie for $10 because I wanted a fresh pie all to myself and didn't wanna buy the $18 large pie. Then It would be carb overload. I didn't workout that day just to backtrack 4 days.  All their entrees are ridiculously expensive. For that much, I'd rather go to a nice sit down italian place, not a dingy pizza parlor. Service was excellent though and we left her a more than 20% tip because she deserves it.  That is if the establishment isn't taking 80% of it. Hmph.
2021-05-05,3,The big slices are just a gimmick, there are other pizza places close by that do the same thing. Meatballs are terrible. I mean, I have lived here my whole life so maybe I am just used to Benny's pizza. It's good if your hungry and get a beer to go with it.
2021-03-29,3,I am very disappointed in them. I've been getting pizza and wings here for the past year but normally order out. Saturday, my family and I decided to eat our slices there and when we first arrived, everyone had their masks on and there was next to no one there. Next thing you know, the place was packed with customers - no distancing between anyone and the staff stopped wearing their masks or they worn on their chins and under their nose. I realize it can get hot in there but now is not the time to let up on safety. The food is always delicious and I will continue to do take out but I won't be dining in there again.
2021-03-27,2,I'm going to be very blunt. Ordered for the second time from them, and the inconsistency is insane. Sandwich was good just like the first time, mozz sticks were cold, and the pizza was stale. The pizza def sat around for hours before they got our order and decided to throw it in the oven snd send it to us. I can't tell you how dissatisfied and disappointed I am with this spot. They did so well the first time we ordered from them, but honestly there was no argument with what we just ate as to how long that pizza sat around for before coming to us. Unfortunately this will be the last time we order from them, and I'll go back to the old school spots in north Bergen before I think about some crap pizza from Hoboken.
2021-02-15,1,Barstool didn't rave about this place so I wasn't expecting much.  It is a complete pass and here's why.  The pizza is forgettable and for 1 slice and a canned soda it will cost you $5.50.  I don't care if it is the biggest slice in NJ, it tasted like Sbarros. I don't want mall pizza. I didn't even finish my slice or my soda. BTW cash only and their ATM is broken.As I was eating my slice I noticed the owner was openly fighting with the uber eats driver, then he started complaining loudly about something else, it was non-stop.   This was very uncomfortable to be around and was another reason for me to quickly finish up and leave.  The final straw, the staff was NOT wearing masks.
2021-02-13,5,Came all the way from Boston to try this "Famous pizza" and all I can say is I was NOT disappointed!!! Amazingly delicious  not to mention that as an Albanian, I'm that much more proud of them and their amazing pizza!!!!
2021-02-06,5,What a good pizzeria.When you hear about it, at first do you think that it's going to be kind of gimmicky on account of the famous large slices.But don't let that throw you off, the slices are big but they are perfect.It is cash only, so take that into account beforehand.The neighborhood is beautiful so go ahead and get yourself a slice, dig into it, and then stroll around.
2021-02-04,2,Mediocre is the norm at this Hoboken classic . Dry , cold , poorly made calzones and pizza . I would question their cleanliness and Covid mitigation efforts and will leave it at that
2021-01-23,1,The absolute worst pizza I have ever had in my entire life . I would compare it to a piece of cardboard.
2021-01-11,5,Best pizza in new jersey hands down. It has a decent amount of seating. I rather get a slice without toppings because the pizza is just too good without it. These slices are huge but its not the size that makes it good. Everything from the dough, sauce and cheese tastes amazing. My first observations when walking into the restaurant was that we would have to eat outside in the cold but us as a group of 10 we all seated indoors which was absolutely perfect. The service was amazing, and the waitress was very patient which i appreciated a lot. I highly recommend this pizzeria for everyone from a family to even a big friend group outing. Although they only take cash, this business is worth the inconvenience!!
2020-12-31,1,Ironically I gave Benny's a two star review years back when I was a student at Stevens. I haven't visited Benny's in a few years because of my horrible experiences with their front guys. After giving them another shot I realized that they are even worse than two stars. I don't want to go into a restaurant and not feel welcome. Will be transferring all business to giovannis. I'm a local (live 1 block away)
2020-12-24,1,They have gone so far downhill so I do t order as much from them as I used to. Then today I decide to get a pizza. I order the pizza with sausage and pepperoni, and to only use half the amount of cheese they normally use because I have problems processing it. The pie comes and it is normal (heavy) cheese, soggy to the point of being undercooked, almost no sauce, and half of the pie is plain, the other half had sausage and pepperoni. So I can't eat it because to take off the cheese would remove whatever little sauce is left. I then call them to tell them they screwed up the order and after four attempts to explain what is a simple order, I'm told they're busy and he doesn't understand. So I wasted $30 on the pizza, because they added a $6 charge for "special instructions". I used to love this place. They are not even close to what they used to be / pizza is soggy and they can't take an order.
2020-10-26,2,While enjoying the Washington Street experience with a good friend, we stopped in to get a couple of slices of what my friend assured me was great pizza! Perhaps it is great pizza, but when you're served two undercooked and cold slices thrown in a box by someone who clearly doesn't care about the customer, it doesn't make for an enjoyable first experience! I'll give them one more try, because I think if the pizza is served hot and fully cooked, it's probably decent, if not actually good!
2020-10-18,4,My family had roots in Hoboken from back in the day, so my father and I frequently visited Washington in Hoboken during my younger years.  No trip was ever complete without a visit to Benny's. The slices were, and continue to be, massive. One Benny's slice is comparable in size to two slices anywhere else. Good mix of cheese and sauce, nice crispy crust. If you get your slice with toppings, they load it up and it is certainly massive. After becoming an adult, I always stopped for a quick slice when I was working in the area. It's a great spot for grab and go. Is it my favorite pizza? No. That would be Natoli's in Secaucus. Is it a good pizza joint that is convenient and satisfies? Absolutely. Check it out!
2020-10-11,1,So sad.....never got the experience to eat. Hours do NOT match the posted times. We arrived an hour before "closing" and were turned down.
2020-10-11,3,Ordered a couple times, first order was pretty good.  Second order was subpar.  The calzone was not made properly and came cold, not even wrapped in foil.  Barely any ricotta and some of the dough was undercooked.
2020-10-02,5,Incredible experience /Old school pizza parlor Mussels marinara a must along with jersey's biggest slice , White Sangria  a real summer thirst quencher Fried Calamari not too shabby either Well worth the ride in from the nether regions of Jersey City
2020-09-25,1,None of the workers or servers wear a mask, it's been like this since Covid started. NJ and Hoboken should shut this place down.
2020-09-14,3,We came here for only one thing -- their large pizza slice!Currently they offer outdoor dining. We came during a busy time, but luckily scored a table immediately. We were told to be seated by a kind waitress without further instructions.My boyfriend walked inside to place an order without considering what other COVID-19 protocols they had in place (that's on us, and we apologized). Upon entering the establishment to place an order, a kind cashier told him she should've waited to have his order taken -- but nonetheless, she took his order understanding that he hadn't been properly informed. A second waitress (different from our first encounter) rudely exclaimed that she "had told him to wait for his order to be taken just moments before." She hadn't.The pizza didn't come out extremely hot, but it still tasted great! Unfortunately I'm giving this place only 3 stars because customer service is so important to me. That rude and mistaken worker's remark left a bitter aftertaste.There's metered parking around the area, but I opted out to park in a garage approx. 8 minutes away ($20 for the day).Hope we don't encounter that rude worker next time we're back here!
2020-08-28,5,One slice at Benny Tudino's is the size of two regular slices at any other pizza shop. I am SO here for it.Quantity doesn't always mean better quality, but in this case it does. A plain cheese slice was super crispy and delicious with perfect sauce and cheese ratios. It was hard to finish one slice without toppings, so any with toppings would be a huge meal. My friends tried mushroom and onion and pepperoni and bacon and they both really enjoyed. They are cash only, so make sure to plan ahead. There is plenty of outdoor seating, and they also have a liquor license which I was surprised to see. You can order beer, wine, sangria, etc. Something else important to note - they are only offering sit-down service. I thought we'd be able to quickly order slices to go at a counter, but you'll actually need to sit on the patio and order with a server. Just worth noting if you are short on time! I can definitely see myself returning for a slice, hopefully sooner rather than later!
2020-08-23,1,I've been a customer for a while now, and I tend to always order my dinner from here. Tonight was no different, I ordered my usual for pick up on UberEats. I was stuck at work, so my cousin who usually picks it up for me, went again tonight to pick it up. Disappointed to say that they were super RUDE and yelling at my cousin. Who clearly said he was picking up for me over three times, with a picture of the order that I sent him. They were constantly yelling that there was no order and he can't pick it up for over 5 mins. I called and told them that yes it was for me, and I ordered on Ubereats. Even through the phone, they were being obnoxious and loud. I work in customer service too and understand how entitled customers can be and how annoying it is to work late. HOWEVER, this was not acceptable. Said from a person, who deal with Hoboken customers and drivers on a daily. SMH! never going here again. I heard the service was terrible and all! but everytime I went, I had the benefit of doubt until today. Food is not worth it for me to deal with nasty ass people.
2020-08-19,4,I always make a point of stopping here for a slice when I'm in town. It's been several years since the owner passed away and fortunately the quality has not slipped at all. It's still the best slice in the world - perfectly flavored, perfect crust, fresh, and huge. I was here for lunch during the pandemic and ate outside. The server was wearing a mask even outside.
2020-08-17,5,YUM. Places like Benny Tudino's are the reason I become such a big NJ pizza snob whenever I leave the state, (trying to work on it)!!! But how can I not when their slices are twice the size of my head and just really damn good?Stopped by for the first time the other day for a quick lunch and got a slice of onion and mushroom. I was a little nervous when I first saw it because the onions didn't look cooked enough but I was proved wrong immediately after my first bite. Perfectly crispy thin crust, delicious cheese, sauce packed with flavor and toppings definitely cooked just right. When I say the slice was big, I am not joking. I had a lot of trouble just finishing one but couldn't stop eating because it was so good. We sat outside because it was a beautiful day and in the shade, not too hot and got a table right away. Our waitress was super friendly and made some good suggestions for toppings. Little tip! They are cash only but right across the street from an ATM so no big stress. There are a ton of great pizza spots in Hoboken but I just found another favorite.
2020-08-14,4,The is a nice pizza joint. There is metered street parking that may be challenging to find a spot. During this COVID time, they are offering carry out and patio dining on the sidewalk out front.  I knew what I wanted before I even got there.  Two of the largest slices of pizza that I have ever had.  And yes, the slices were huge.  I could barley eat one of them. So, they packed up the other slice for me and I had it for lunch the next day.You can order your slice fresh. I got one with sausage and pepperoni and the other with meatballs and sweet peppers. They lived up to the hype.  They were tasty, flavorful, fresh, filling, huge, and delicious. They also have a kids menu and serve subs and  Italian entries, amount many other items. The restaurant patio stays full during peak hours and they have a steady flow of customers in and out.  Please be aware that this place is CASH only and does not take credit/debit cards. This place was very laid back and I throughly enjoyed my pizza.
2020-08-13,1,I am absolutely APPALLED by what I just experienced here. My friend and I walked in wearing masks, to see 5 of their employees with no masks or gloves on. When we ordered two pizza slices to go, one of the employees moved the pizza with his bare fingers (after touching dollar bills right in front of us) into a box, and then grabbed two paper plates with his bare hands and threw them on top of the slices. We kindly told him we didn't feel comfortable taking the slices after what we witnessed, since we are in the middle of a global pandemic, and we requested two different slices. He immediately responded by raising his voice and refusing to accommodate. He started yelling "We don't believe in COVID here! We always touch the dough, and everything, with our fingers! Why are you freaking out? You are the only customer we have who gets upset! No one else believes in COVID here." We finally got our money back and will NEVER return to such an disgusting place again.
2020-08-09,3,Two things I heard about Benny Tudino's Pizzeria:1. Joe Biden had a slice here.2. If all you're looking for is a good slice of plain pizza, look no further.After a long day, with no one wanting to cook, we all decided to order some pizza and call it a day.  Knowing item #2 (listed above) we placed an order of a plain pizza pie, garlic chicken wings, and an Italian salad.We ordered during quarantine, so I can't speak to the ambiance or the service at Benny Tudino's Pizzeria, but I can speak to the accuracy, and my interaction with the staff while placing my order.  We called ahead so that by the time we arrived the order would be ready.  Plain pizza pie was fine, but could have been gooey-er with melting hot cheese and bubbling sauce if you know what I mean.  The Italian salad was fine, thought it was going to be more of a chopped salad, not slices of deli mozzarella and slices of tomato laying on top, but it was ok. There was however some confusion with the wings.  When we placed the order, the staff member on the other end asked if we wanted the sauce on the side - huh?  We were ordering garlic wings so we just assumed the sauce would be ordering sauced up garlic wings.  At the staff members recommendation we got the sauce on the side.  When we opened up our order we saw plain wings, with red sauce and blue cheese on the side.  We didn't realize that the garlic sauce was going to be hot sauce with garlic... not a garlic sauce.  It tasted fine, it was just not what we thought it was going to be.
2020-08-07,1,Very rude service, half way into your slice they are serving you the next one they rush you to get out and it's only cash
2020-07-23,1,My fiends had me meet them here for a slice. Knowing about the rudeness, filth and rubbery slices of this establishment I decided to skip the pizza. So I just sat with them. Reason for THIS review is our server. NO MASK. Not even hanging off of her chin or ear. Just nothing. The other server was also seating in the customer serving area on the phone maskless. When asked about the issue she simply said "oh dont worry about me". This place needs a surprise heath/covid inspection STAT.
2020-07-06,5,I love this pizzeria! One of the best in Hoboken. The customer service here is wonderful. We tried the buffalo chicken pizza as well as the plain, and they never fail to make us happy. The place is usually packed , but they keep it clean all the time. I recommend!
2020-07-05,1,This used to be my favorite thin crust pizza in town. It is now a thick doughy tasteless mess. Wanted to save other locals from my mistake!
2020-06-29,1,Garbage.absolute dump.go here only if you prefer quantity or quality.cheap ingredients that taste like shit.they are so stupid to only accept cash.on top of that they have a stupid little atm machine so people end up paying atm charge.never eat here.
2020-06-21,1,Brought my family here and everyone said it tastes so bad. The pizza was soo undercooked and doughy and gross.. my dad keeps telling me it's the worst pizza he's ever had lol
2020-05-28,1,This is absolutely disgusting. I placed an order for pickup after a super long day at work to get in my car and realize that they handed me my food in a bloody bag. This is beyond unhygienic especially in a world full of covid. I didn't even bother to go back inside and complain because everyone inside was just rude and annoyed that they had to be there, but quite frankly as someone who has to deal with the general public as a healthcare worker, no matter the circumstances you show up and give your all. Looks like I'll be ordering from other places from now on since my business is not needed and clearly there are other more hygienic places to eat from.
2020-05-03,5,When I'm up in Hoboken late night with my friends and family this is surely the spot we come to grub. The food is amazing especially their large slice of pizza! The service is excellent as well, never once have I had any issues with the food or servers. Even when you have to wait to be seated it's never more than an hour. I always travel over an hour just for the greatest pizza in jersey! Thank you for always having the greatest food!
2020-04-24,2,2 stars because I love their pizza and I've never had an issue with sit down service.That being said - their delivery service is appalling. They said it would take ~40 min and it ended up taking an hour and a half. Understand they get busy, but my real issue is the way the dealt with it.I called at an hour in to see where it was and they said it was on the way. Well an hour and a half rolls around and the pizza still isn't here. I called them, they rudely told me it was delivered, said thanks, and tried to hang up. I told them no one called or rung up my apartment.I understand not wanting to walk up in the building during the outbreak - but you can't drop off food and not tell anyone or even buzz the apartment...  They said they called me and told me they were dropping it off. I told them they never called and never spoke with them. They continued to try and make me believe they called... it was a little bizzare. I went downstairs and they had delivered it - but it was freezing. I called them back and told them, expecting them to apologize. They continued to double down and say they were busy and it's not their fault. I tried to asked for a refund and they hung up on me.If you want good pizza, eat at their location. I will never be ordering delivery from here again... maybe not even going to their storefront.
2020-04-10,4,I went back to Benny's as it may have been just been bad timing. The people were friendly, the pizza was good, the beer was cold, and the pricing was great. The pizza isn't my style as it doughier, but I know many people who rather that style. The sizing with the quality is impressive. Late night slices especially, this should be on your radar. I have updated my rating.
2020-03-08,1,Vile people making pizza. Scratching his beard and touching slices. Threw mine in the garbage.
2020-03-07,2,Huge slice of pizza but Quality over quantity when it comes to pizza for me!! Big slice, thinly crusted, low quality sauce and cheese and carelessly scattered toppings on a slice. Meh, I tried it. No garlic knots available and I probably wouldn't come back again. Pizza is one of my favorites and this was a bit too subpar for my taste.
2020-03-02,5,oh boy did I need a nap after this slice. $4 and you get a slice bigger than your hands (see pic for reference). Great fast service, delicious food and a taste you can't beat. If you're in the Hoboken area & looking for lunch stop by. It is cash only so make sure you hit the atm before stopping in. Also can get busy on weekend afternoons, maybe look into calling ahead if you're getting to go. Overall, full, satisfied and planning on coming back to try the baked ziti next!
2020-02-28,5,Best pizza in Hoboken hands down.  I've been coming here with my family for years.  The pizza is huge!!
2020-02-19,3,Visited this Italian place located on Washington Street. The place offers the largest slice of pizza. We went there at about 4 in the evening and it was almost packed. Benny's famous pie (10 inches):This pizza comes with 6 slices. I felt the gravy was slightly less. We ordered Onions and green peppers as toppings. Due to less gravy, the pizza felt dryPesto pasta:Ordered a penne with pesto sauce. The sauce was a mix of pesto and Alfredo. Extremely creamy and cheesy. Benny's famous pie:We ordered a traditional pizza. Would expect some garlic or basil on it but that was missing. It was a plain cheese pizza with less gravy and an average crust
2020-02-15,5,If you're looking for a slice of pizza the size of your torso then you've come to the right place. Benny's is a staple in Hoboken, and if you're from the area, then you must have dined here at least once... or 100 times. This is my absolute favorite pizza spot and it always hits the spot. The staff feels like family and it's always good to see a familiar face. Definitely recommend!
2020-02-12,5,Best pizza ever! I go here at least once or twice a month. The employees are so friendly and love to joke around w me and my guest. I definitely recommend this place every chance I get! Keep up the good work guy!!!
2020-02-04,1,I wish I could write zero stars who ever says this pizza is good you clearly never had pizza in your life it's extremely greasy very plain taste the only thing about it it's huge and half way through it you just wanna throw it out complete waste of a pizza Spot in Hoboken DONT GO HERE on reviews HORRIBLE they should at least feed the homeless people outside there store
2020-01-23,5,Awesome. I had never seen bigger slices in my life. Now I even the whole pie which is 4 or 5 feet. It's not measured in inches anymore but in feet.And it tastes great.
2020-01-18,2,Used to be my favorite pizza place in hoboken, but every time I order delivery the pizza comes ice cold. The delivery guys don't use insulated bags to keep the pizza in and items are often missing. Really unfortunate I will have to find a new pizza spot to order from.
2019-12-29,4,Biggest slice of pizza I've ever had!  This spot came highly recommended by friends who live in the area. I really enjoyed the toasted salad. It was simple and fresh. No complaints here. I would definitely recommend this spot to friends.
2019-12-28,4,I came here with my brother who was all about this spot. It was a good place with delicious pizza. Their speciality is the giant slice which is  a first time must. After I ate it, I felt the food coma coming. No regrets.
2019-12-17,5,nice place in hoboken with what appears to be the largest pizza pies in new jersey....friendly staff hot pizza
2019-12-07,4,We had an amazing time. The pizza was huge! But let's not forget it was super delicious!! Large 18" Slices. Soft thin crust , cheesy and crispy all at the same time. The only downfall was that it was CASH ONLY. But other than that it's a must do! You'll thank me later.  #greatservice #perfectpizza #worththetravel
2019-12-03,2,Benny's has quietly become a ubiquitous part of my life. Want a quick bite? Want an affordably large meal? Want a snack conveniently located on a walk home? That's Benny's and how it's presence grew on me. This ubiquity meant that I never questioned. Only when I described Benny's to out of towners, did I take the time to actually judge it's pizza. Benny's pizza is just not that good. Sometimes the dough isn't cooked enough and other times it's overly crisp. The slices are never cut evenly, and the taste is just missing. I always find myself piling on garlic powder, oregano, and red chili flakes. As an aside, the restaurant is extremely smoky because of poor ventilation. Benny's is very accessible; it's right on Washington and the slices are quick, large, and affordable, but you don't have to settle for only convenience like I did.
2019-11-24,1,The 10 minutes I spent here was the most unappetizing experience I've ever had. Pizza is huge and is not bad but in terms of hygiene, I definitely will not step foot back here again. The guy who handled the pizza, touched the money and the counter, then scratched his nose and touched his colleague's hairy neck. I don't need extra ingredients in my pizza. No thanks!
2019-11-21,5,This pizza is amazing.  I love trying and eating this after a good night out.  I do have to say my review might be a little unbias because i was a little drunk when I had it. Comparing it to NYC pizza.. I don't think it compares, but for a NJ pizza it is pretty amazing.  Who can also hate the sizeeee??!!
2019-11-16,5,I absolutely loved the food! The first time I went there I had Chicken Parmesan and it was fantastic.We were told by a college student locally here that we have to try the pizza and it was amazing. The people that work there were very nice! Thank you,Mike Hartman
2019-10-27,1,Horrible place dirty one service suck the dude took my order had atitude. Never took are order ingame are pizza someone esle willnevercome here ever again
2019-10-26,4,I ordered the pasta carbonara I've had better but this was pretty good it was too bad
2019-10-24,4,Good pizza place for a huge slice! Perfect for something to eat after some drinks especially. I usually ask for my pizza well done because I like the crust to be crispy. The shop is also family friendly so feel free to bring the kids and grab a table. Beer and wine is also available for purchase which is cool. They are cash only so please keep that in mind. They do have an ATM if you're okay with the extra fees.
2019-10-14,4,I've known companies where the motto likely to be put out is, "We work hard, but we play hard." Which usually means that they occasionally get together after work for a desultory game of softball. Where I work in Hoboken, the motto is, "We work hard, and we eat hard." In our case, we really mean it. Our office is informally known as "the Lunchbox Mafia," ("Lunch Menu Mafia" to some), and my senior co-worker, recently dubbed "the Godfather of Lunch," tells each new employee (the joke goes that on being hired they're given an introductory manual, I.D., and 5 menus), "You will gain weight working in Hoboken." (Due to my Irish-German ethnicity, I guess I'm the de facto Tom Hagen of the group.)  I have history in Hoboken going back to before my birth...my genetic grandmother grew up here, my birth mother spent her formative years here, my adoptive grandmother was born here and later moved to NYC...but I've never quite gotten the city's appeal, outside of easy access to Manhattan. It may cost a fortune to live here, but to my mind, it's still the same grubby waterfront city it always was, gentrification or no gentrification. What it does undeniably have, however, is a plethora of restaurants. If the NYC of Dutch Schultz and Lucky Luciano had speakeasies and opium dens, the Hoboken of the "Lunchbox Mafia" has restaurants. Lots of restaurants. Some good, some not so good.  Not that I've sat down to eat in any of them. With us, it's always about ordering take-out for delivery. When we want Italian, there are plenty of Italian restaurants in the area. The quality and the pricing varies. The truth is, though, that Benny Tudino's is the one I prefer ordering from. Their main claim to fame, it seems, is the immense portions, and the portions are immense. But I like the food. Is it as good as I used to get at some of the legendary eateries on Mulberry Street way back when? No. Is it the best Italian restaurant I've ever eaten at in NJ? No. But it's very good Italian food, and plenty of it for reasonable prices.  My half Albanian co-worker (who maybe could pass for a young Al Pacino...or perhaps John Cazale...or, if he keeps eating like he does, maybe one day will be able to pass as Richard Castellano) snidely and sniggeringly informed me one day that the owners of Benny's were Albanian, as if that would deter me, for some reason. I informed this young upstart that the best lasagna I ever ate was made by my late WASP mother. The best Italian I ate on the West Coast was made by Mexicans in Tijuana. A bigot I'm not. Especially when it comes to food.  The chicken parmigiana sandwich I had once was less than stellar, but the grilled chicken sandwich with fresh mozzarella and roasted peppers is delicious. I'm also a fan of the eggs and sausage sandwich (although I can't eat it too often, or I'll be the one looking like Richard Castellano). The sandwiches are reasonably priced but the price of the lasagna with sausage seemed excessive to me. Despite this, I couldn't resist trying it. I still think the price is high, but it's a lot of really good food with 3 or 4 substantial sausages packed in there, along with the cheese, sauce and noodles. You won't walk away from the table hungry. Is it as good as that made by my late mother? No. But I will be ordering it again. Soon.  I ordered a pizza slice once, and it was as large as a manhole cover. Ridiculously large. I recklessly wolfed it down, momentarily imagining I was 17 again. Unfortunately, my digestive system all too soon rebelled against my haste and lack of common sense (I ate the slice with half a Benny's sandwich; I guess my eyes were bigger than my stomach), but it was a delight while I was in the process of consuming it, if not afterward.  Delivery is always quick, the food is good, and if you're still hungry when finished, you need to consult a doctor. Truth is, Benny's can only be an occasional indulgence for me. I'm a middle aged adult; the 17-year old with the flat stomach is long gone. But is he? Occasionally, he pops up out of the recesses of my psyche, hissing in my ear, "Salad and peach slices again? Are you nuts, old man? Birds and deer eat that crap, not people!" I fatalistically relent and indulge the 17-year old, feasting on the comfort food of my youth. Benny Tudino's is great comfort food.  To quote the inimitable Godfather of Lunch, "You will gain weight working in Hoboken." Count on it.Mangia!
2019-10-06,5,My friends and I decided to visit Hoboken to eat at this fine pizzeria. As Food Insider says it "The Home of The Biggest Slice". It's always a pleasure visiting Benny Tudino's. Even more, the pizza is amazing! Tonight we ordered one large plain pie. The sauce is seasoned perfectly and the cheese blend is fantastic. Each slice makes you crave more and more. Definitely a place to visit.
2019-10-05,3,Benny Tudino's is not a place I would specifically go out of my to for pizza, but if I'm in the neighborhood and I want a big slice, Benny's is the place.  It's known for its large slices and it's a pretty good value.  However, when the slice is too big it's not able to be cooked as evenly and well through out.  That being said, the pizza itself tastes fine.  It's average run of the mill NJ pizza, which is better than pizza probably in most parts of the country.I will say, their buffalo chicken pizza is very good and one of the few places around that has buffalo chicken pizza.  The breaded chicken makes it good.All in all, it's fine pizza if you're out drinking or you want to feed a lot of people.  But if you're craving actual great pizza, try Grimaldi's on Clinton Street.
2019-09-28,3,Biggest pizza slice I have ever had and totally worth the hype. Cheese slice was quite tasty and not too much garlic.
2019-09-21,5,My family visited Stevens Institute and we were told about Benny's at the presentation.  Let me just say that it did not disappoint. The slices are as enormous as pictured.  We live in Westchester County and we will return with the entire family. I'm looking forward to sitting in the restaurant and trying several of their options. Stay tuned
2019-08-26,1,I really don't get it.... This pizza sucks. Sure, are the slices huge? Yes, but they damn well better be at $4 each for a plain slice.Seems like people get distracted by the over sized slices and in turn sacrifice the fact that this pizza isn't good. I was really disappointed and have zero interested in this place or it's crappy pizza ever again.
2019-08-24,5,By far my favorite pizza place!  Slices are huge.  Pizza is not well done...just how I like it. Although living in Bergen County now I still drive to Hoboken to get me my Benny Tudino fix!
2019-08-10,5,I was in the area for a golf tournament so there was no way I wasn't going to Benny's ,even if I had to drive through a hole like Jersey City to get there. I'm a man who wears an X-large shirt and likes real pizza. No girly man thin crust, no third world toppings wanted   There's a place in Hoboken that sell's an $80 taco pizza. What moronic, social media addicted, millennial is paying $80 for a pizza? I'll tell you.  He needs a narcissistic picture in his profile, wears a small- medium shirt, can't grow a full beard ,thinks there's status in over paying and doesn't take left-overs home. . Benny's is simply the best pizza in NJ. I had it cold for breakfast the next day, like real men do.
2019-08-10,4,This is nice pizzeria in hobokon. I have been here now 5-6 time.  we like the pizzas also we order beer jugs . the place is  super crowded over the weekends and slow with delivery but overall nice place to hang out with friends.
2019-07-29,1,Ordered $60 worth of food for dinner for me and my sister the other night.  $18 for a pizza pie that arrived cold.  Literally couldn't eat it.  Called them immediately.  Manager tells me that it's Uber Eats fault.  But, Uber delivered on-time.  Uber won't refund the $18 because they say it's the restaurant's fault, and the restaurant won't refund the $18 because they say it's Uber's fault.  Somehow, me, the customer, ends up out of $18 because I couldn't eat what was delivered and nobody at Benny Tudino's cares.  The customer is stuck in the middle between two poorly run operations.  I wouldn't eat in at this restaurant now, or order again, due to lack of concern for their customer.  I work hard for my money, how about you?
2019-07-25,5,Cash only! There is ATM inside but it cost 5dollars for fees.but pizza is really huge just 5 dollars and delicious. bathroom is tiny
2019-07-20,5,Quite simply the best slice of cheese pizza on the planet.  Period.  I travel all over the world for business and seek out pizza whenever I can.  Every time I come back to Benny's,  like this last time,  I re-confirm their pizza excellence.  The restaurant is nothing fancy,  but if you like pizza,  don't even think about it another second - go.  Fold that slice in half and enjoy a true delicacy!
2019-07-08,1,Big slice but the service is really bad. I had a bad service experience here years ago and haven't been back until recently. I'm shocked that the service is similarly poor this many years later. Rude and no attention paid.
2019-07-07,3,Three stars for the nostalgia, otherwise 2 Stars.  We had plain and mushroom pizza as well as eggplant parmigiana.  The pizza was good but nothing worth going out of your way for.  Nothing special.  It's just a place to have the experience of a big slice.  Not close to being on a list of taste defying pizza. Eggplant Parmigiana was lacking flavor.  Sauce felt like it was out of a can.  Don't even order to be honest.Bathroom was absolutely deplorable.  Toilet wasn't cleaned in weeks.  Overflowing garbage.  No paper towels.  No soap.  Where do the employees wash their hands?  Think about that.Not going back.
2019-06-28,5,Stopped in. Waited a few minutes for a table but oh, it was worth it!  Best marinara ever! 1st time in Hoboken, NJ and these guys score. Had pasta and pizza at our table. Nom nom
2019-06-09,3,Big slices of pretty good pizza. I got a slice w red sauce and mushrooms. We also got spicy parmesan wings. Service was friendly but slow.  Prices were favorable. Nice wine.
2019-06-04,5,So, as a kid, remember the good ole' days when you ventured into your local pizzeria and said, "I'll take two slices and a coke...."  You'd devour those slices like you're going to the chair..  Well, if you're a kid in the town of Hoboken and utter those words, well..  You may not make it thru one slice - As the slices are as big as your head..  They don't boast, "The Biggest Pizza Slice" for nothing!  They are so big that one plate isn't enough to hold a slice..   One of the best slices I've had in a long time and living where I do, I have a pretty good selection of pizza choices.   Pizza is crispy, piping hot and priced perfect for what you get.  Menu is full of Italian goodies also priced right.  You will not break the bank having a meal here.  Quick, courteous service awaits you here.  Highly Recommended!!!
2019-05-21,5,Very good pizza best I've had and very friendly and welcoming. Will be a regular customer for sure.
2019-05-19,1,Second time visiting, and the first was also nothing to write home about.  This time, the messy slice was handed to me, and the crust was not cooked all the way.  Nothing else to report, and I won't be back.
2019-05-15,4,Good pizza, enjoyable crust. Thought it was a good balance between crispy and chewy.Thank you
2019-04-23,5,The lobster ravioli with shrimp on top with seafood Alfredo sauce is the best I ever had. Pizza was delicious too.
2019-04-12,4,Came here and ordered one plain slice and it definitely is a large one! It's definitely worth the $4, you get what you pay the extra buck or two for a bigger slice. Part of me wishes it was Instagram worthy huge, but It was still a solid tasting slice, not too greasy and the crust was soft with a nice charcoal to it. This place is a staple for a while and I can see why. I'd definitely come back again! Oh and it was cash only!
2019-03-29,5,I love Benny's! I love the size of their slices of pizza! Great flavor too. Service is okay. Today we ordered the meatballs and a calzone with pepperoni and mushrooms. The meatballs came out warm, not hot. The marinara is delicious. The crust on the calzone is incredible! The cheeses and pepperoni and mushrooms are great quality and yummy! We've ordered this before. It's consistently delicious! As is their pizza slices. Cost is reasonable too. Only downfall is they're cash only. I would say this is number two to Tony boloneys pizza. Love them both!
2019-03-23,5,BEST ON EAST COAST! Can't beat price point. $3-4 per humongous slice. Make sure to try eggplant on top!!! Seriously worth it. I always go in and make special Vegan order and they always allow me to. Awesome place!
2019-03-20,3,6 years later... pizzas are still huge and the place is broadly exactly the same. I still like the novelty of it.Having a more "refined" palette now, Benny Tudino's is still good for a cheap eat to soak up a night out, however much better options exist for a good, tasty pizza slice - Eg Tony Baloney's, Razza in Jersey City etc.
2019-03-19,4,Hands down the biggest freaking slice of pizza I've ever eaten. We stumbled across the Benny Tudino's  and was pleasantly surprised.  Tasty and very filling. $4.00 a slice. My only knock is that it's cash only
2019-03-06,5,Best place ever $10 big slice big pizza deal... never seen in tristate area. Beer was poured in 1.2l glass... awesomeness!!!!! Three option to select peroni( italian beer italian place...perfect) coors light and bluemoon. Salute
2019-02-17,5,Amazing pizza for such a good buck. Wonderful experience every time I come in. Thank you for giving a legendary good quality Jersey  pizza.
2019-02-15,5,First of all they serve wine and beer so how could they fail. It's on the quiet side of Hoboken so even on the late night you don't get the crazy drunk crowd. Pizza was fresh and staff was friendly.
2019-02-15,3,Came here for a quick slice for two, when they were ready I gave them my card but only to find out it's CASH ONLY. Upside: they have an ATM, but I wasn't going to pay a fee to take out cash for only two slices so luckily I had enough cash for one slice and we split it. The slices are HUGE so if the $4 price point shocks you just look at the size of slice you get!They really should have several signs in and outside the restaurant that says CASH ONLY PLEASE so people are aware. I usually don't carry cash with me so if I didn't have cash, I would've just left, disappointed. In this day and age, every business should accept card payments even if they want to put a $5-10 purchase limit, I bet a lot of customers would be happier if they did have a card payment option.
2019-02-10,1,Unm we drove so far for this pizza and its not what we expected the service was terrible like beyond terrible the pizza was cold and he dough was raw like seriously the restaurant have a lot of nice stories and pictures and we likryhe old school looking but the pizza is nothing special cial just the size
2019-01-25,4,LOVE this place! The pizza is huge and fun but the wings are the best part.  Large potions.  Good service.
2019-01-12,5,Omg! I love a lot of from Benny's dishes, especially since I'm addicted to Italian food and I normally order the ravioli Parmesan which is my favorite! The salads are really good the eggplant Parmesan is delicious, the garlic bread with cheese is so good. Today I decided to get the spinach lasagna just to try something different and omg! It was amazing! I savored each bite, definitely getting that again! So I definitely recommend, especially if you are staying in with a bottle of wine or sparkling wine is perfect! Oh! Yeah their thin crust pizza is super yummy as well if you want to order a pie
2019-01-01,4,My friend was surprised I have never been here. So we ventured off and came here after a good night of drinking. Oh my goodness, how have I never been here?! Pizzas are as big as babies and they're nice and hot and perfect. A drunk girl's dream.
2018-12-15,5,Very good pizza, one of best in Hoboken. Great service, our meat pizza had way too much meat to compare to other places. Good prices!!!! Definitely will be back
2018-12-13,5,Today, I ordered lunch for six people in our office from Benny Tudino's in Hoboken, NJ.The food was absolutely incredible. It was delicious, and the portion sizes were generous and filling. I got the Chicken Murphy. It was served hot, somewhat spicy, with rich sauce, and a side of tasty bread. I would definitely recommend the Chicken Murphy, and the other people got chicken dishes, lasagna, a BLT, and a Greek salad, and everyone was satisfied and said their food was good. If you need to do a work lunch in Hoboken, or any meal really, you should definitely try Benny Tudino's for high quality food delivered in a reasonable amount of time for a fair price. Thanks!
2018-12-12,5,Benny's pizza has the largest slices in Hoboken.  Their pizza is thin crust and has delicious sauce.  They can add any toppings for you and you can taste the freshness with every bite.
2018-12-10,5,Loved this pizza while on vacation. Huge slices and tasty especially with the slabs of sausage they put on. Love the Jersey vibe and old decor in this place. Grimaldi's was my go-to pizza spot when visiting NY/New Jersey area but this place I prefer over it now.
2018-12-08,3,I have heard of this pizza shop with humongous slices as big as a person's face so decided to check it out. Yes, it's good for pictures and fun to see such big slices but the taste, was just very normal.. it was just typical take out pizza taste..
2018-12-06,1,honestly, this pizza absolutely sucks. giant slices, but most pizzas that follow that gimmick aren't good. this one is no different.
2018-12-05,5,"The Biggest Pizza in New Jersey". "The Best Pizza in New Jersey".  Outrageous 32" pizza! The food is spectacular. It is an old Hoboken standard that has been run for years by the Tudino family. The interior looks like it was remodeled in 1970, like an old pizzaria should. Service is spot on, most times by family as well. I always get the pizza by itself, or just a slice with some other item on their menu (calzone, etc.) The slice is enough for one person by itself. Living 1000 miles away, I will still make a point of eating there every time I'm in town.
2018-11-20,4,I underappreciated Benny's on my last revew. Yes they put on the toppings after the pizza comes out of the oven but I rarely get toppings on pizza anymore. I stick with the traditional plain and that slice is delicious at Benny's. The slices are big but they are also tasty.  The sauce is tangy and the dough has the right amount of chew. The crust snaps perfectly and is cooked just to my liking.I like it here. Eating more than 1 slice on a sitting is tough but if you have an appetite go for it. I disagree with El prez's review on barstooll. He underrated this pizza. It is 4 stars all the way.
2018-11-18,5,I've been coming here for years upon years. The pizza is always amazing. I love the huge slices plain, or with sausage, or with eggplant, or with meatball. Incredible.
2018-11-04,5,This is my favorite pizzeria in town! The slices were huge and delicious. The sauce, cheese and dough were of top notch quality and cooked to perfection. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We had a table of 7 people and sat in the back at the round table. Great place for great food, great conversations and great service. Family friendly. I highly recommend Benny Tudino's Pizzeria!
2018-10-30,4,Went for DinnerFood - 4/5. The pizza itself is pretty average. You'll find it tastes similar to most pizzerias but the size is what makes it stand out. The pizza holds itself pretty well for having such gigantic proportions which makes for easy chomping.Service - 4/5. They're quick, blunt and throw jokes as you would expect from a pizzeria.Value - 4/5. A slice here will cost $3.50 which is about a dollar more than average. I haven't done the math to see if the 40% increase in price results in 40% more pizza but the large slices here sure make you feel you are getting your money's worth! Great value but not full marks due to the average flavor.Parking - Street (Metered)
2018-10-21,3,I've been having Benny's pizza for a large chunk of my life and most of the time they've been great, but unfortunately even after all the years they've been in business, they crumble under pressure and can't get a pizza to you in a decent amount of time. They also don't do much to make it up to you as a long standing customer. Overall, pizza quality is okay (not bad).
2018-10-19,5,The manager at Benny's is very generous and supportive of community organizations. He recently donated a tray of wings and a tray of pasta for a party that I hosted to raise funds for a local non-profit that sends at-risk youth to college, called "New City Kids." All of the guests loved the food and plan to order from Benny's in the future! Thank you!
2018-10-14,1,1st time here and will 100% be my last. Here's why. 1) I stood at the counter for a to go order for 5 minutes while 3 guys behind the counter goof off and ignore me. Until I sighed REALLY loud. Great start.2) Cash only, they only tell you this at the end of the transaction. Guy behind the counter saw me holding my debit card the whole time. Real crappything to do. I'm not mad that it's cash only, just be courteous and inform the customer. 3) and when they informed me it was cash only he proceeded to take my order from the counter and place it away from me as if I wasn't going to pay. He assumed I couldn't pay for it and practically put it back. Oh and the pizza is mediocre. So all in all terrible service + pizza you can get literally anywhere else = not worth it.
2018-10-13,5,Great and ridiculously huge slice of pizza. My daughter has always finished her slices in the past. This one she tapped out. This is how the experience went. I walk in and realize the line is weird. Me: excuse meOther customer: lines ova heya, pal.Me: Thanks, budOther guy: don't mention it.Customer a: Ey oh, grab me a can!Customer b: which one yo?Customer a: a can, from the thing. You know a can...ah pepsi, whateva, the can from ova there..Customer b: what? *Guys move along line*Me: He said a can of PepsiCustomer b: Thanks, buddyCustomer a: eh, you-no. A can of Coke! Whatsa-matta wit ju!Customer b: *laughs and looks at me and whispers as he passes* he wanted a Pepsi and forgot, grouchy fuck.Me:*I smile*Dude taking orders: eh oh, whatcha want?Me: eh, two slices.Dude taking orders: any drinks wit dat, pal?My daughter: these *bringing bottles from fridge*Me: and theseDude taking orders: two slices and two drinks, dats 10.50, buddy. Me: *gives card*Dude taking order: no cards, Pal. Only cash. Go to da thing. The thing with the cash.Me: the thing?Dude: yeah, the thing, over there. The thing with the cash.Other employee behind the counter: yeah the thing, then pay the guy.  Customer b: yeah there, the thingMe: I got it. The thing, of course the thing. *Goes to the ATM In the pizza place*Dude: There you go.Me:*brings back cash* Hey buddy, here's the cash from the thing. For the slices and the drinks. Dude: Oh! Here's your change. Enjoy. Me: badabing! Badaboom!I somehow morphed into some latent Jersey Italian and channeled some of my wife's Italian. This is simply a great townie pizza spot. Good food, inexpensive, and great personalities.
2018-10-13,2,So unprofessional!They only take cash and they let you know when it is payment time! I had to go out in the night and look for an ATM and because I did not have an account to the bank nearby I paid 5.5 dollars fee for a 20 dollar bill! Furthermore, we asked for the receipt and they gave us the handwritten order from the waitress!The pizza is ok but they overcharge for the toppings. Not going there again
2018-10-04,4,This is the biggest slice I have ever seen in my life! If you normally have 2-3 slices, one slice will fill you up, guaranteed. Tastes pretty good too!
2018-09-26,4,We were in the area Sunday and dropped in again for the best slice in New Jersey.While the meat toppings are limited, the pizza is simply delicious.  I don't know if it was the Snapple, the cheese or carbs, but boy was I sleepy later.  I should take a nap on a heavenly slice.
2018-09-11,1,People behind the counter are some of the grimiest rude people you'll encounter in the restaurant industry.
2018-08-25,5,Almost 30 years since I had my first slice here and it is still fantastic! $3.50 for a slice bigger than your head is a deal.
2018-08-18,1,Love the pizza. Hate the service. No customer service whatsoever. I ordered an hour ago only 4 slices. I called and they don't answer. So done with these people.
2018-07-26,5,Simply the best! Went there as a kid when the doors first open back in 68', I think.
2018-07-24,1,PLZ READ And READ OTHER COMMENTS !!! Spent the day in Staten Island and found this pizzeria in Jersey. The pictures make you want it but don't be fooled and waist your  time. We walk into the restaurant wasn't greeted but whatever. As we're reading to see what we want the guys seemed irritated that we're ordering. I'm fine with that too but their attitude was soooo nasty almost as nasty as their Black mold infested bathroom. I wish I didn't give them a dime because they take your money with the same hands they touch your food . God for bid i asked if the spinach was fresh. He looked at me as if I said "Fuck your mother". As we sit to eat our slice; the pizza was kinda dry so my friend went back to the counter to ask for some marinara sauce. They had an attitude all and all we could have went any where else in had better food and service.
2018-07-16,4,I been coming here for over 20 years , the pizza is always delicious and HUGE . I've tried other things but nothing beats the pizza and wings . Not a lot seating but would recommend more for weeknight dinners  . Although this place is always busy.  The only downside is this restaurant only takes cash . If you're like me I never have cash  . Also gave it 4 stars because the rest rooms are disgusting.
2018-07-08,4,I came out to jersey, to meet up with friemds and go out for my birthday, the brought me here. I am used to eatting NY pizza new park pizza,  but this pizza is so delicious and my chicken  parmesan was outstanding. Customer service was also good. I plan on returning.
2018-07-02,3,I have been coming here since i was 5. 30 years now. I must say I am not too proud of what this once great pizzeria has become. The slices are now almost 4 dollars and today I bought a slice that was too thin, very dry, and minimal sauce. Very upset. I always had nothing but great things to say. Not today. I hope they make changes. Thank you. In a side note, they still have the best wings in town.
2018-06-30,5,No need to order two slices anymore to feel full! You can get an extremely large slice here and it's quality too! Very fast service and great atmosphere! I asked them to cut our slices into two pieces because it was that huge. If you like to eat your pizza folded then you don't need to do that. I don't eat my pizza folded so I was happy they sliced it for me :)
2018-06-21,4,I ordered an entire pie again. But this time, I had three other people with me and we dined in. I had a much better experience this time around, probably because we ate the pizza as soon as it came out. That being said, it seems that the trick is to bring your friends and dine in, if you want to order the pie. If you do takeout, the pie gets soggy and doesn't taste good the next day.
2018-06-19,4,Amazing italian feel. VERY friendly staff. Food VERY much bang for your buck!! Most definitely returning. Wish they had more drink selection.
2018-06-09,1,Service was disrespectful. Pizza was cold. Crust was barely cooked. Guy told us to move while we were eating outside. DO NOT RECOMMEND
2018-06-08,2,Great portion.  1 slice requires two plates.  However the pizza quality isn't consistent. First time I've came here I had a great thin crusty slice.  The second and third time the pizza crust is too doughy and undercooked.  Its like they took it out of the oven early because they're trying to turn out many pizzas at the expense of their quality.  Any pizza place that's willing to serve that white doughy slice isn't getting my business.
2018-06-06,3,Yep the Pizza is sure large.  That's 90% of the appeal of this institution.  All prebaked enormous pizzas are cheese pizzas until you order toppings,  then they throw the toppings on your slice and put it back in the oven.  I suppose it's efficient if not gourmet.  For Hoboken, the Pizza is above average.  Cash only!  Sometimes they "forget" to give you your change.  The cooks and waitstaff are so beyond rude it's morphs into part of the charm of this place - much like the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld.  They are constantly exasperated at everyone who dares to come patronize their business. The nerve! But there is usually a line, so *shrug* must be doing something right.
2018-06-03,3,Small family style pizzeria. The pizza was very good; but there are a few things you should know... 1. They take cash only, which we didn't know until afterwards. They do have an atm, but it was broken so we had to go across the street. 2. We ordered the House pizza (which is huge), but we were not told it would take over an hour to prepare. There were only a few customers there that had already been served, so we started to notice the wait after several groups after us were served before us. 3. Each topping is $6 on top of the pizza price of $28.4. We asked for white sauce on half of the pizza, and after waiting an hour, the waitress came over to tell us the cheese counts as a topping and would be $6 extra than what we were quoted, what she didn't let us know was that it was not a white sauce put in the crust before the toppings, but it was rigatoni cheese plopped on as a topping, so no sauce on that half. It would've tasted better with a white sauce.  But it's important to note that the red sauce was really, really good and the crust had a great flavor too. That half of the pizza was 5 stars!I dropped 2 stars because of #1-#4 mentioned above.
2018-06-03,1,Pizza was huge yea, but they lose the flavor and actual pizza feel smh there was virtually no sauce. It was burnt, some prefer it, I don't want my pizza burnt, I want it toasted. 2 different things. We're sat down, and there's weird, old pictures of ppl I'm guessing the owners and family staring at you while you eat... Awkward... Our server offers us our drinks and they're super small little Arizona drinks! Ok what?! She offered water but she said "bottle or tap?"... Uh, I think I rather have bottle. Just for today, I rarely do this... WHAT!? Of course it's more convenient since it's money! And less water too! Wait why would they even offer their guests tap!? She never offered drinks again, so I was choking on cheese no lie, both me and my friend, I was reduced to eating ice for the remainder of my dinner. Once we get to the counter to pay, it's cash only! There's no sign that says cash only! I repeat: THERES no "CASH ONLY" SIGN! And when we were told, the guy was super rude while notifying us! Definitely not a good experience! We had to start pulling bills and lose change out of our pockets! As we were doing that, the guy scoffs and walks away, as if he's got better stuff to do than to apologize to his guests and take care of them, make sure they have a pleasant experience! Out of our check, our change was a quarter. He flicks the quarter on the counter and barks "your change!" Uh, hello? Check yourself before you wreck yourself! Yeah, won't be coming back. This place is totally overrated, the service is as if they don't care how they treat every single customer, like if they have so many ppl coming for years talking so good about Benny Tudino's and that they're a prosperous business that they don't need to make your time there pleasant. Everyone basically comes for the pizza and it's not that great. Spend your money elsewhere, and way less of it. Why do I have spend $30-$36 for a pizza? Our chairs were nicely decorated with crumbs, the place just looks and feels dusty. Bathroom door lock wasn't working. How many people didn't knock!! I had to hold the door w my foot while relieving myself! Yeah, not sure maybe next time I'll try Mexican.
2018-05-31,5,Good pizza! The slices are really huge. My coworkers and I went here for lunch and wow- it was pretty packed and they were putting out slices super fast. The place is cash only- so please be aware of that. Luckily my coworker had cash for me. I ate the slice pretty fast since I can eat super fast and I really did enjoy it. The cheese was good and the bread was nice. One thing I don't like in the smell of yeast in my pizza (which many have and people who don't eat speciality pizzas refuel won't really notice). We are going back today for lunch. I also read that we "as a team" go here every other Thursday. I brought my cash today! I will add a new picture of my food today to this review. One more thing- I don't know if you can get anything besides cheese slices there- I have only gotten cheese! Try them out if you are in the Hoboken area!
2018-05-27,2,The pizza was unexpectedly really large, but that is all that was notable about it. I had a simple plain slice, fried chicken wings and sat in a booth inside. The pizza: dough was slightly undercooked and it was very oily from cheese. The interior was small, and seats were tight. The wings were better than pizza: fried well and hot. Although, the service was good, the staff was quite kind.
2018-05-17,5,Incredibly fast service, nice staff too. The pizza lived up to what I'd heard. I've been twice now. Everyone should eat hear at least once.
2018-05-16,5,The best pizza you'll find in Jersey...  Not always crazy about the staff in there as i feel you have to grab their attention just to put your order in and i don't like that they try to pressure you into being served by a waitress (this isn't the type of place that requires table service and tipping).    Having said that- i love the pizza, i only need a slice to feel completely satisfied.  I recommend a slice with eggplant on it !!!!!     Haven't ever tried their other food because the pizza is so good - but if you want a giant slice- this is the place to go !
2018-05-06,4,Stopped in for a slice while strolling through Hoboken. What a bargain! $3.50 for a huge delicious slice and $1.50 for a soda. Now come on $5.00 total for a quick and tasty lunch, that's a steal! Definitely stop by if your in the neighborhood...
2018-04-20,4,Been wanting pizza (but not the domino's type or papa johns - nothing wrong with them just wanted to try something else) so i decided to drag my husband with me  4/13/18 to be here. The place itself gave a homey vibe when we came in. Lots of pictures on the walls and a few locals saying their HI's and Hello's to friends they met there. The place was full, but not packed, when we went that there were no more vacant tables all the way in the back. So we sat by the entrance and close to where the magic happens so it was no big deal.I already knew what i wanted, just plain cheese pizza with no crazy add-ons coz i thought i wanted to try this pizza without toppings masking the "base taste". I'm glad that's what i ordered. To me, i really enjoyed the amount of sauce, cheese and last but not the least the dough! It was like eating freshly made bread (which it was i guess in a way lol). Between bites i'd sometimes add a few oregano and some chili pepper and man was it good! Just writing this review made me miss it already.The size of the pizza slice was large but i think it was actually enough for me. Would really love to come here again and next time I'll bring the fam!
2018-04-18,5,Hands down the best pizza in Jersey. If anyone tells you otherwise, they're lying or never had their regular slice before... and this is coming from a die hard New Yorker.
2018-04-15,5,Hands down the best pizza in NJ. Easily comparable to NYC's top pizza establishments. The owner is extremely attentive which rubs off their staff members. From the food to their service, it  was all on point. If you think differently.... you don't know shit about Pizza
2018-04-14,5,i've gone to Benny's on multiple occasions, and the pizza is just huge  , and i love it!
2018-04-09,4,If you want a yummy slice of pizza and you're in Hoboken... Benny's is the spot. I love the mega slices from their 32" house pie.  I usually go with my family and we get the house pie. The price is super reasonable... $28 for the house pie. The location is a no frills spot and I always enjoy it. Service is quick and friendly.
2018-04-09,5,Been going here for years; just brought my boyfriend here all the way from California and he just LOVED it. Highly-recommended to our-of-towers and locals alike. Awesome food, outstanding staff and an amazing experience!
2018-04-08,5,Ordered personal pizza and wings and sub sandwich delivery to the projects the food was awesome,  I mean grreaatt!!!!  Would order again and again their food is always  fresh,and most of all delicious.  The original owner had passed away but he would be proud to know that the tradition still lives on. There is nothing like a Benny Tudino's  Pizza.  Please never leave Hoboken!!!
2018-03-29,5,I loved the super large pizza slices. One pie fed as us all, that is 4 adults and 3 kids and we took 2 extra slices home. Beer pitchers only $8. The server was great too and was very accommodating and really great at taking care of us. I wish I had remembered her name but forgot. We were there night of 03/28/18. Thanks!
2018-03-25,3,Been coming here for 20 years, the pizza is delicious sometimes they serve it cold or burnt because they reheat the slices but when you get that perfect slice it's amazing I would give this place 5 Stars if they hired a courteous staff, it's a bunch of Albanians with the worst attitude! They don't greet you to say hi the rush you to order they are rude not sanitary and very pushy, they also talk loudly amongst themselves all the time the waitress if you sit down are also very dry and pushy they need to send the staff to a training camp for customer service but pizza is so good I deal with it..
2018-03-24,4,For $3.50 a slice (a HUGE slice) it's definitely worth it. The sauce is tangy like I like it and the cheese.... Gooey cheese. Cheap and delicious! Workers are a little impersonal but it is a pizza spot so I don't really expect much. Would definitely come again for the big slice!
2018-03-14,5,This review is for delivery only- I have never had an issue with time- the food is usually within the expected time window 40-60min) and the food always arrives hot! We usually order a Large cheese pizza (sometimes we had 1/2 mushroom and onion), wings (so freakin good- we were seriously impressed!!) and a garden salad! (So I don't feel as guilty) Everything was fresh and delicious, I love to support local family owned restaurants and will continue to order from here again!
2018-03-07,5,Best plain pizza in Hoboken! Great flavor and you get a big slice for your money. One plain slice was bigger than my face!!!I would definitely go back! Drink options aren't just soda and juice.... there's beer too! Thought that was different compared to my local pizza places. Tasty pizza and beer along the side, sounds like nothing but a good time.
2018-03-04,4,Good pizza.. good to reheat in oven later too! But they need better garlic powder also service was bad- but expected that after all the reviews.
2018-02-27,4,Probably one of the largest slice I've seen so far. A must try if you're in the area.  Get there early bc it does get busy later during the day
2018-02-26,4,This is the best pizza place ever. I love it!! This place is always crowded especially on weekends but the food is very delicious. I'm on a diet I go there for 1 or 2 slices and I end up buying 3 or 4 slices.
2018-02-25,2,I am really surprised by all the 5 stars.  I should have tried a couple of slices before buying an entire pie. It was very cheesy - I'ii give you that - but there was NO FLAVOR because of the scant amount of sauce and spices/herbs. There was hardly ANY red sauce on the pie, and the rim was like under baked white bread and a far cry from "crusty". Honestly, my pie looked nothing like the ones posted on here which look appetizing. Did I get a substitute (teacher) baker that day?!? So disappointed.
2018-02-23,3,Like everyone mentions here, service kinda really sucks.Pizza is good, I guess maybe if I lived here rather than in the city maybe I'd appreciate it more.
2018-02-15,3,Great plain slice - terrible, unfriendly, impersonal and unsanitary service. I always walk by and frequently pick up a plain slice for 3$ (or 3,50$, depending on the day and who I hand my money to). The flavor, consistency and portion size are great. You're lucky if somebody looks at you tho, nobody says Hi and then once you've ordered, suddenly 2 other guys ask you "Yeah!?!" impatiently, although u had just ordered. Slice is usually thrown in the oven with the same bare hands that just handled my cash. When I ask "to go" you won't be given a box for a single or two slices... you have to insisit. I'm a foreigner and walking into this Albanian pizza restaurant, I always feel very foreign and out of place... probably because I don't speak Albanian.
2018-02-11,2,Great pizza! TERRIBLE service. We were greeted by a waitress with no smile and bad attitude who didn't seem happy we were there. No hellos, no how are you, nothing. She didn't want to take our orders if we were doing separate checks so we were forced to do one big check. At the end, we were told she only accepted CASH. Well it would've been nice to know before we sat down. Not once did she ask us what we needed. Don't know her name because she never introduced herself. Good pizza.... but if you want good service, go to Grimaldi's down the street.
2018-02-11,5,So pizza was good.....sausage grinder was on point!  Best sandwich in the area.  Even better biancamano's in my option.  Both are crazy good.Pizza slices are legitimately HUGE and staff extremely nice and friendly.  Good beer choices and great hours for late night runs.Customers seems to love it and like to welcome you with jokes about Greeks and Italians!
2018-02-09,3,Huge slices, definitely a bargain, and the pizza is good - nothing phenomenal, just good pizza. I don't think Hoboken has amazing pizza, and maybe it's because I compare it to NYC, but if you're looking for a solid slice you will enjoy...come here. I think it's better than pizza republic, Giovanni's and marios. Those other places aren't bad by any means, I just think this is a little better. 3 stars isn't a bad review, and I would come back. To me, though, 5 star pizza is Joe's, bleeker street, and John's - all those west village gems.
2018-02-04,4,Rated only on the plain cheese pizza slice for $3.50.When I am in Hoboken, I have to stop here for my fix of pizza. Their regular pie is 32 inches wide. When you go up to the counter to order your slice, this is what you'll get.The slice is large.The slice is thin crusted.The slice has a good balance of cheese & tomato sauce.The slice is better when you add Oregano flakes to it. The slice is then flavorful & tasty.The slice is hot if you get one that just came out of the oven.The slice is priced a bit high.Btw, I always have to get a second slice regardless if I am still a bit hungry or full just because, its that good. Btw it's BYOB.
2018-02-02,4,Really big slice of pizza. Taste really good. Nice, clean spot. Lots of seating inside. Staff is not so friendly. But the place is nice. Everyone loves there big slices. It's huge!
2018-01-16,4,Nothing.  I mean nothing will ever beat going to Benny's and enjoying a piece of pizza bigger than face.  And to top it off it's actually GREAT tasting. However it doesn't deliver well.  I don't get it. BUT there's ways around it.  Get the house pie which is basically the same as the shop and is delivered in 2 boxes.  You'll have pizza left over for days but sometimes you gotta suck it up When you don't feel like leaving. The house.
2018-01-14,5,This pizza to me is the best pizza I have ever tasted and I AM FROM NYC where joes pizza exists okay. I don't know what it is, the ridiculously huge pizza or the fact that the cheese/sauce ratio is perfect. One slice could fill me up and takes about two plates! The prices are cheap I think it's $4.50 a slice but in Nyc you would get a half of that for $3.00+ so I'll take it. I travel specifically to Hoboken to get pizza from here and in the summer I'll get it to go and lay down on the grass near the water. It's perfect. This pizza is seriously amazing. I wish we had this in nyc I would be here all the time! Don't let the other reviews sway you from trying this place out.
2018-01-11,4,They clearly have the biggest slice in NJ .The pizza atleasr fits 2 plates and is hard to finish in one sitting . The place is clean and the servers are attentive. Pizza is a bit greasy , but  I would put this joint on the last of a top 5 list of best pizzas in the state ( not the number one that is advertise ) .
2018-01-06,4,The best pizza deal in Hoboken! The size of the slice is the most fun part of the experience, but the flavor and taste of the pizza certainly doesn't hurt it! It is among my favorite pizza places in the NYC area, and #2 in all of Hoboken.
2018-01-05,5,My favorite pizza spot.  Everytime I come back to Jersey this is the first place my friends and me go to!  Pizza slices are bigger than your head haha
2017-12-28,2,So let me be fair, I know this place is known for its pizza but one night I was in the mood for a chicken parm dinner. I ordered a dinner from here with pasta and I wasn't too happy tbh, the chicken was so chewy, almost like it was not even cooked, i couldn't even finish it. I will order from here again, give it another try and I'll get some pizza also! I'm sure I'll change my review!
2017-12-20,5,best pizza I have ever had, the crust is to die for.I came here and expected a normal slice but what i had was life changing . my taste buds were maginifies and the mixture of slice and cheese was incredible. I was very impressed and would come again.
2017-12-16,1,Hello, all! This is the epitome of an establishment that is not prepared for an urban setting, regardless how long it has "been here." Because we sat for longer than 30 minutes, I was asked if I am ok. I was then asked if I am "special needs." I refused to offer her any more opportunity to belittle me, a customer. If I were you, I would NOT give this "establishment" your reference.
2017-12-10,5,Brought my husband for his first time. He loved it! We went simple with one plain and one pepperoni slice. Both delicious! Definitely a must-have if you're in the area.
2017-12-09,5,This pizza was so good and also ginormous which made it even better. Small joint with tons of love inside. We were visiting from AZ and it was so good. Employees were very friendly and have been telling everyone w we talk to about it.
2017-12-02,4,Seriously the biggest pizza I have ever had! We decided to try something fun & new and we weren't disappointed! The pizza was seriously huge and it was good! The service was fast too! The pizza started at $28 and each topping was $6, we got 2 toppings so $40. It was definitely worth it! The pizza came in 8 huge slices so plenty to eat too. I was full from one slice!
2017-11-01,2,The slices are huge but the flavor could be better! i expected more from this restaurant
2017-10-20,5,This was the BEST pizza I've ever had in my life!!!!!! The staff was super friendly too!! I can't wait to go back and have it again!!! The sauce they use is to die for!!!
2017-10-18,3,Indoor and ourdoor seating when the weather is nice. Giant food portions including the largest slice in NJ, always fun to try. Extensive menu in addition to the pizza.
2017-10-17,4,I haven't dined at the restaurant but did order take-out one night. I was fairly surprised by the amount of food they gave and the quality of the shrimp in my SHRIMP SCAMPI. I usually never order pasta for delivery because it's usually gross by the time it gets to me, but my food was fine and still hot when I started eating. The shrimps were very plump and well-marinaded. They didn't skimp out either -- I think I counted 7-8 shrimps. My boyfriend ordered a CALZONE that was freaking humongous. It was a bit too burnt on one side, but it was pretty tasty. I don't really like calzones much, but my boyfriend seemed to enjoy it. I forget what else he ordered but we were both very satisfied with our order. I see that everyone really likes their pizza, so I'll have to stop in next time and pick up a slice...or pie!
2017-10-13,1,Easily the worst single slice of pizza I've had after living in NJ for the past 5 years! The staff was too busy with their own conversation and didnt even bother to heat up my slice so I ended up with a cold, chewy, overall really bad slice of overpriced pizza (although it was big). Terrible service. Terrible pizza. Will never, ever step foot in here again
2017-10-04,4,A lot of this place does come from the novelty of claiming the biggest slice. Overhyped it may be, but it never failed the bar of a NY-style slice, let alone one that spans two plates. I've had only one other slice that big, and for $3.50 I got what I expected.It's pretty much what I expected. With the giant pizza comes the stereotypical attitude - plenty of stares and you're never quite sure if they're getting your order or the one for the guy next to you. But you'll get every bit of gooey, cheesy, greasy bite of pizza that you'll want. That being said, it wasn't perfect - I was so confused by two bites of pure bitter that I realized half my crust was charred to black.I'll chalk it up to a one-time occurrence but that sucked to bring home.Well the pizza's large enough to kill you with a Philly taco from Midtown, that's for sure. BT's met the bar I was expecting.
2017-09-12,3,Honestly, my boyfriend and I came just because we saw that this place had the "biggest slice of pizza". Jersey is known for its pizza places though, so we wanted to see what this was like. Benny Tudino's is located in busy Hoboken - so of course parking will be somewhat difficult. The parking is metered street parking where you'll pay at a kiosk. Interestingly enough, I wouldn't have expected this to be a pizza place based on the front of the business. It looks very nice outside with outdoor seating and flowers. But then again, there's huge writing that says "Home of the Largest Slice". The interior also doesn't look like a pizza place. When you walk in, it sort of does look like a pizza place, but the back is a different story. It's very nice in the back of the restaurant.As for the food, I'll just keep it short. We looked at the menu which had a lot of items. I didn't really know what to choose from. However, this place is known for the largest pizza slice, so there wasn't really a difficult decision. The price is pretty good for $3.50. The slice is definitely big. I was happy with the quantity. Quality-wise, the pizza is somewhat average, but the cheese does taste good. Will I come back here though? Not sure. Maybe if I'm craving a slice.
2017-09-12,4,I'm going to keep this short: $3 for a huge slice... pretty worth it in my opinionTastes like regular pizza, just bigger. The size is what they promote. But remember, size doesn't equal quality. I just go here if I'm in the area, fairly broke, and very hungry. Overall, a pretty good experience and average tasting pizza.
2017-08-24,5,We came after Stevens institute Move in day. Really close by, nice place very cute. We had the pizza of course and some wings.  It was really good. We will be regulars here every time we come see our son in Hoboken.
2017-08-21,5,Some of the best New York style pizza I had a very long time ,, The pizza just reminds me of old school Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies lol,huge slices fresh piping hot pizza, I will be visiting again soon
2017-08-16,1,I first ate at Benny Tudino's in the early 1990's. Benny's pizza was good back then, and the pizza remained good until about 2011. Well Benny's is now much worse than it was in 2011. You are better off buying supermarket frozen pizza than going to Benny Tudino's today. The place is practically empty whenever I walk by these days, and there's a good reason -- the pizza is awful !
2017-08-13,1,The pizza was fine when I tried my brothers slice. However , I noticed as he was serving it that he was not wearing gloves and collecting money THEN touching the pizza. We kindly ask if he can possibly put gloves on since he just touched our money and did not want him touching our slices. Instead he said wait , we waited 5 minutes while he was standing there DOING NOTHING! Once again kindly asked what are we waiting for. He said he doesn't know. So obviously he was trying to do that to inconvenience us because of his unsanitary actions!!! Very disappointed in the customer service and NEVER again will I return!!!!!!!
2017-08-12,4,As close as you can get to a NY slice.  The one pizza in Hoboken that is worth the wait.  Keep it simple, cheese or pepperoni is the go to at this place.  The wings are intriguing as they aren't sauced but fried and crispy with sauce on the slide. I kinda like it, its unusual but it works.
2017-08-11,3,Pizza is decent, service can be slow if they are very busy. Pizza not always hot. Kicked out of outdoor area as they don't allow dogs to sit inside the open gated area.
2017-08-10,3,Great place for a big slice of pizza, or some yummy pasta.
2017-08-10,5,Have tried many different pizza place in town and without a doubt, Benny's has the biggest and tastiest slices....cant miss or be disappointed
2017-08-08,5,Delicious! Very quaint Italian spot with a huuuuuge menu, prices are pretty decent too. The waitress was personal and attentive. My 2 friends and I each got a super slice which was great but we're crazy and decided to order 20 wings amongst us as well. Wings were cooked to perfection, non of that undercooked goo you find in other places so you can eat it clean off the bone. We got the spicy garlic flavor cooked into it (you can choose it on the side as well) but I think next time I'll get it on the side. The sauce was super authentic, you could tell it was house made with the fresh garlic pieces in it. I'll be back!
2017-08-06,2,Pizza is alright. I will admit that it is a bargain to pay only $3 for the huge slice that you get, but honestly, it tastes like average pizza. I wouldn't go here again. Now, if I was a tourist I would definitely rate this place higher but I'm not. As a NJ resident, I know what good pizza tastes like and it's definitely not this place.
2017-07-28,5,Benny Tudino's is definitely a Hoboken staple! Everyone is always really nice and there's so much history in that pizzeria. When you want great pizza that's quick and filling, it's definitely my go to. The pasta dishes are always great and the chicken wings are yummy. Just a heads up if you go, bring cash.. they don't take credit cards!
2017-07-14,5,Such a fun place, small but very family oriented, pizza was amazing but the wings were the bomb, OMG, delicious!!
2017-07-05,5,Greate pizzaThey accept only cash but for a place that serves great food and until 1 am i will happily recommend them
2017-06-26,1,Only good thing about this place is the delivery was quick. Staff was rude. Delivery didn't even deliver full order. Pizza was soggy and disgusting. Will never go back. Mario's pizza is 100 times better. Don't waste your time or money. This was not worth the money.
2017-06-24,5,A pizzeria with grandiose sized pizza slices & with a cute ambience, what more can I ask for! To be honest, I wasn't expecting much, I had one pepperoni slice & the vodka linguini pasta. The pasta seemed fairly simple, nothing special nor bad. However, what really struck me was the size of the pepperoni slice! Each bite I took from the pizza was filled with so much flavor, very minimal amount of oil. The balanced ratio between the cheese & sauce satisfied my taste bud. Overall one of the best pepperoni slices I've tasted & extended beyond expectations. Really recommend this place for chill dates.
2017-06-23,4,I am really tempted to give Benny T's 5 stars but it is regular pizza, but pizza done right. I have to give that 5th star for someone like Bleeker Steet. They do it right all day , everyday. This is the pizza I grew up with creamy pizza cheese with that pizza parlor flavor. nice amount of oil, and a good stand up crust. Why go to a chain when you can go to a real pizzeria and its not expensive for a medium pie. I don't even tangle with the large slices, its just a novelty. The fact is they have good pizza with good ingredients and a old style pizza oven. BTW they only accept cold cash.
2017-06-22,4,Wow they actually have this in jersey! Big giant sized slices. I was in the area and wanted to get a regular slice and found this place. This place was actually good compared to a different store in nyc. Try it out feels like 3 slice in one.
2017-06-11,4,I was expecting a crispy and ginormous piece of pizza that I could taste the sauce and look forward to the next bite, and that's exactly what I got. Food Flavor - Unfortunately for me, I must've come at the tail end of the Italian sausage expiration (or it was sitting in a warm but not hot holding area for way too long) because mine tasted like it was on its way out. Despite that, sausage had good seasoning and there was plenty of cheese and sauce on the pizza, without being too saucy. I recommend getting a full pie so you'll get the benefits of the ingredients being fully cooked into the pizza. Ambiance - Though I sat outside next to the flowers and a sidewalk full of tourist, I still felt I got a bit of privacy. Overall recommendation is a 4 due to the sausage. Service - nothing offensive. Standard service.
2017-05-25,1,I've only eaten here once, but sub par at best maybe 2/5, but what gives them a 1/5 is there customer service/work personal. One of their delivery men nearly hit my dog and I while we were clearly in the crosswalk. After confronting the driver, he was non apologetic. But even worse was the manager in side who completely brushed it aside. They're dickholes
2017-05-22,1,Pale CrustUber Thick CheeseBland PepperoniI  can't even recall the sauce Largest Slice in the State?Quantity over Quality
2017-05-21,1,Went in with my friend to grab a slice of pizza. My friend sat on a table that was done, and basically leaving.  An extremely rude waitress tells him if he wants to sit to wait until she cleans it. I told her we were actually leaving, and the guy on the table told him to sit cause he was leaving, so there's no need for the nasty attitude. She felt really stupid. I could of sworn she said "Shut up" under her breath. I heard her and confronted her and she claimed she said "Drop it" All the employees were apologizing on her behalf. So we sat outside, and I was complaining to my friend, 2 other tables chimed in (5 other ppl) and told us she was also very rude. The pizza was delicious, but this was a terrible experience. I don't care how good your food is, if your staff is rude and unprofessional.
2017-05-10,1,Myyyy god!!!!!!!!! What a poor poor costumer service !!  My friends has a hearing problem can hear very little I'm next to her she orders 2 slices i guess they guy miss understand and ask her if it was 2 or 3 she didn't understand BECUASE SHE HAS A HEARING PROBLEM!!!!!!!!!!!! So she says sorry can you repeat what you said. The guy very rudely says what are you deaf at this point it takes everything in me not to punch this guy. I cut in and say sir she actually does have a hearing problem after i say that the guy wants to say sorry and give us the food free which we didnt take we paid for it was really good and big i wish i would have learn the guys name he had green eyes look middle eastern if the owner reads this place make sure your staff is not that rude and to have more patiences with clients or not to work at all.!!
2017-05-08,4,I have been here a handful of times over the last few years. They are well known for the huge slices, I think the pizza is quite yummy. The slice I had on Saturday was not overly greasy, and the crust was crunchy, which is my favorite! I tried their chicken Parmesan sandwich sometime ago with my boyfriend, it was a big portion, even for the 2 of us! It wasn't memorable to be honest. I love that Benny's is old school, but it definitely needs a THOROUGH cleaning and slight update. I like the old school look, however it needs to be CLEANED. The walls are dusty and there are some tools that definitely need to be replaced. I think they should keep the old school look but some cleaning and updates are needed.
2017-05-03,5,All time favorite place. Pizza is amazing the service is fast even when they're super busy. Only issue is I can never finish my food because everything taste so great and portion sizes are huge. So glad we live close to Hoboken to enjoy this great place!
2017-05-01,1,So, they advertise for having the larges slice in Hoboken.  That's good and all but the whole bottom of my slice was burnt.  Inedible burnt.  The customer service was terrible.  All in all not a good place to go.  There are too many choices in the area.
2017-04-25,5,Loved this place! Went there with my boyfriend for the first time and we each got one slice and it was delicious! I got sausage on my slice he got mushrooms everything was so fresh and delicious. These slices are also HUGE I heard they had the biggest slice around and that was no lie! Will be back again very soon!
2017-04-18,1,Went to Benny.Tudino's very disappointed the front counter service extremly rude. Pizza was cold. Will never return waste of money. Don't believe the hype.
2017-04-05,5,It's hard to please me in regards to pizza-- I have yet to find the "perfect slice" in the Hoboken-Jersey City area. I like Benny's though! Big and cheesy slices, with great consistency in terms of dough-i-ness and crispness. Yum! The staff is extremely friendly and never grumpy; always warm and welcoming. I only wish they'd extend their delivery line into Jersey City, or at least right past the border (where my new apartment is, hehe).  I love Benny's and am semi-heart broken that I can't receive delivery now that I've moved, but that doesn't overshadow the merits of their delicious pizza.
2017-03-28,3,This place is cash only and yes, the slices are huge! I love stopping here after a night of drinking. The wait can be out the door, but they move pretty quickly. Not the best pizza in the world but for a slice that size for cheap, it's definitely worth stopping in.
2017-03-27,5,Hooooooly shit!!!! A friend of ours told us to come here and damn! Those slices hahah the waitress told us to just try one slice before ordering two. I was like what? Yeah right because I eat a lot but damn after that once slice I felt like I had enough. We went on a Sunday afternoon before our flight back to Miami and it wasn't packed at all. Definitely wanna come back here again.
2017-03-09,1,As someone who has spent decades living in Hoboken, I just have one remotely positive thing to say about this place, they're consistent. The pizza is consistently big, under cooked, and tasteless.The service is consistently awful, and at times aggressive; The people behind the counter and the waiter/waitresses are consistently rude, uncaring, and seem to forget they are the face of a business. The people here (who seem to be more or less the same crew since i was a child) have somehow fooled the population of Hoboken into supporting their business. It seems people have forgotten how much they jacked up their prices in the time span Hurricane Sandy tore Hoboken up. Disgusting business practice. In Hoboken, a place with passable to incredible pizza on every corner, I would suggest spending your money elsewhere.
2017-03-08,5,Best pizza in Hoboken and so worth your money!  Their dough is phenomenal!
2017-03-07,1,I love coming here at any season of the year. However, I am now put to debate whether I'd enjoy coming back or not. My server was very impatient when I told them we needed a moment to look over the menu. Did not check if we were ready until 12 minutes later. Also, got really mad that instead of ordering a pie, we ordered individual slices! She even ended up getting 3 orders wrong, even though she wrote them down. Before our slices were done, she came out with our drinks (2 liter coke) and threw the straws at the table. Furthermore, once the pizzas were ready instead of having the decency of giving out the pizza's who they corresponded to, she said "no, I'm going to leave them right here and you can pass it over." I hate using yelp to post a bad experience, but this was definitely something I couldn't leave unpublished. Whether I'll be coming back or not, I still haven't decided.
2017-03-06,3,Benny Tudino's you get the job done, but people- like me-  from New York know you are not home of the largest slice. 2FT slice at Pizza Barn in Yonkers will call you out. But, besides that, this place is not all that bad. The slice is actually bigger than the regular ones and they are pretty good. Two things that are extremely disappointing:1. They don't accept credit/debit. Like, seriously? 2. Workers can be rude and give some attitude. I know they deal with drunk people most of the time and are fed up, but damn don't give me attitude. These guys seem to always have a bad day and while that's exceptional, don't take it out on the customers.
2017-03-01,2,Stopped by Sunday afternoon for an early dinner. It was a cold day so the outside seating wasn't an option. The front of the restaurant has 4 booths & the back is a small area w/ several tables We waited around 25min for a table. I ordered a slice of mushroom pizza & mussels for an appetizer. We also ordered the eggplant parm with pasta. They claim to be 'the home of the largest slice' - even though it's larger than an average slice of pizza, it is microscopic compared to the 2ft slice at the Pizza Barn in Yonkers. My pizza was surprisingly disappointing. The slice was heated up & raw mushrooms were thrown on top. Not sure why they didn't put the mushrooms on BEFORE they heated it? The eggplant was "average" & the mussels were ok. I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, considering there are probably 10 other pizzerias on Washington StTotal bill was $35 - CASH ONLY
2017-02-19,5,Went here with friends after seeing it on Facebook, apparently everyone else saw it on there too because it was pretty busy for a Sunday night. Pizza was great and well worth what I paid plus our server was awesome!
2017-02-19,3,Went there today for the first time ... the size of the slice was huge. As far as the taste it was ok mediocre at best. The sauce was a little sweet for my taste and the crust was too doughy. The price was very reasonable 2 giant slices were $3.50 each .,I would go back there just to show off the slices to my  sons and the   staff was very nice
2017-02-19,4,I came here after seeing the INSIDER video that featured this pizzeria. The boyfriend loves pizza and so do I. We decided to come here to try their large cheese slice. We ordered 4 of their large slices because why not?! It was delicious because it was a lot of goodness for only 3.50. We were stuck in traffic for 30 minutes before we got to eat it so by the time we got home it was cold but it was still good. The pizza was ready after I ordered, but the down side is that its a cash only place. I would be coming back if I am in the area for this delicious goodness!
2017-02-18,3,Definitely a novelty pizza place. Wouldn't say it's the best slice I ever tasted but the biggest slice I ever had. Notice that the sauce was a bit sweeter and the Pizza slice was good but very doughy. I'm more of a thin crust kind of guy.. But that's just me right? Lol if your there  in the weekend you will have no place to sit so be prepared to eat outside holding that massive thing haha.
2017-02-18,4,Tastiest pizza in Hoboken! Huuuuge slices live up to the hype. Great staff, too. Only comment is that the pizza sort of loses its pop with delivery, gets cold really fast. Recommend eating in.
2017-02-09,1,I heard the food was really good but was seriously surprised on how terrible the service was. Called to place an order for pick up in the middle of this blizzard and the guy that picked up the phone told me he didn't have time to answer my question because he was too busy and told me that if I had questions about the menu to come in instead. Even though he was that rude I still proceeded to walk to the establishment thinking it would be better since that's what he suggested I would do. Unfortunately, the guy was still rude and was cursing when talking about other customers. I'm a very patient person but I really couldn't believe how rude this guy was.
2017-02-08,3,Its safe to say that they have one of the biggest pizza slices u will ever see, however as far as the actual taste goes im not really a big fan. Its not bad by any means but its nothing special other than a really big slice.
2017-02-05,4,This is my favorite non charcoal fire baked pizza slice in town (that's a whole other ball game). The slices are literally so big it needs two paper plates to carry and I have no complaints about that! The sauce is sweet and the crust super fresh. I like to stop by here after a long days work (or happy hour) to grab a quick slice to go. VP Biden stopped here when he was in Hoboken too, which is pretty freaking awesome and validation in itself. To be honest, a few years ago I got a bad vibe from male staff (felt kinda dodgy and flirty in a bad way), but more recently I've gone back and it's been fine. I'm so happy to be back!
2017-01-24,1,Me and my wife order a large pizza half chicken bbq and half veggies with no broccoli , order took over 40 minutes to be ready! And surprises are as following.1- waiter cutting slices and serving us "which is nice of her" but the problem she was using her hands to put it in the plates :/.2- we asked for half veggies with no broccoli, but it came with broccoli all over and the waiter was like oh im sorry its not my fault i told them. We said fine no problem.3- After few bites we found that the pizza has pepperoni on it too and we don't eat pork! So we called the waiter and we said we don't want the pizza and we're leaving she said the owner is going to make her pay for it and they wont understand that they made a mistake. Finally she came back after like 10 minutes more saying owner said fine but we can't take the pizza with us LOL. We don't want the pizza.We walked out and all the pizza makers were looking at us as if its out mistake. NEVER AGAIN.
2017-01-20,5,Best pizza in Hoboken and you seriously can't beat the price. My go to is the pepperoni and hot cherry tomatoes. The beer selection is on point and by that I mean that they have Yuengling on tap which is the absolute best way to drink it. It's an experience going there-really old school Hoboken. I've taken lots of people there and they are never disappointed! Full disclaimer-I have never gotten anything but pizza there.
2017-01-19,3,Reading the reviews you might think the pizza gods had descended on Washington Blvd in Hoboken and took up residence at Benny Tudolo's. In reality, the pizza is just OK. Yes the slices are huge and a great value however if taste is important, then it is at best average. Perhaps ordering a custom pizza might be better. On the positive side the slices are really big (served across 2 paper plates) and are custom in a sense. They take a slice that has just cheese on it and they add whatever toppings you want. But that's where the value goes out the window since it's $1.00 for each extra item. We had a slice with some toppings and it was average.....not bad but no where near great. The Italian salad we had was probably the best item. The Veal Parmigiana alone (no pasta) was $15.00 and huge. However not that tender. The veal was tough but the plate looked great, loaded with cheese and sauce. I think this place might also be better for take out. They have some tables in the back but cleanliness doesn't seem to be high on the list of priorities. The bathroom is disgusting but if you're out with friends and feeling the munchies after drinking, a slice from Benny's will do the trick. I wouldn't recommend this place if you plan on going out for a nice sit down dinner.
2017-01-15,4,Great meatballs and the tortilini with garlic and olive oil were killer. And yes the pizza is really good and the slices are really BIG!  The chianti ain't bad too!
2017-01-14,5,This is the standard that all pies are measured by.  This place hasn't changed in the 40 years I've been coming here. Always consistently delicious.
2017-01-10,3,I stopped in on a heavy snow day because it was recommended by a colleague.Food: I ordered a large pepperoni pizza for take-out. I thought the pizza was good and tasted good even after it was reheated the following day. The pizza sauce in particular had a sweet hint to it that made it more memorable. I am not sure if they put some sugar in their pizza sauce but it was good. Can't say it is the best pizza, but was certainly enjoyable. I still give the title for the best pizza I've ever had to Star Tavern. Service: It was a busy day for delivery so the service was slow. I understood the circumstance so it didn't bother me.Con/Tip: At this point, I assume most places take credit cards, especially when they take it online. I learned that they take it on delivery.com but not in the restaurant. They defer you to the ATM machine that charges you an additional $2.50, which goes to the restaurant. That effectively increased the cost of my pizza. Normally, I walk to my bank's ATM but with the snow I decided to eat the cost. In a progressively cashless society, I find this to be outdated and inconvenient. Overall, the pizza was good but it wasn't enough to go out of my way to get their pizza. I'll likely stick to Hot House Pizza because it is closer and they take credit both online and in the restaurant. If you're close by and have cash, it isn't a bad option.
2017-01-01,5,Best single slice pizza!!! I never leave NYC from any other place but the Lincoln Tunnel so we can stop here on the way back to Philadelphia. The slice is huge. Never soggy. Right amount of cheese to sauce ratio. Friends veg us to bring slices home.
2016-12-31,3,Decided on Benny Tudino's out of all of the restaurants on the street. It was really busy for a weeknight dinner. There were a total of five of us and they gave us a booth with an extra chair as there were maybe a total of ten tables in the restaurant and they were all full of diners.FOOD:- BAKED ZITI ($8): Very large portion for $8 which is a very good price and I had a ton for leftovers the next day. The dish was okay. I wouldn't say it's the best ziti I've had. - 10 BUFFALO WINGS ($10): I was surprised by how good these were. We all couldn't stop eating them. It was probably the most memorable part of our meal. We asked for sauce on the side. The sauce is so, so good and addicting. - CHEESE PIZZA (price by slices): really huge, huge slices the size of your face! Definitely worth the price. Super cheap for such a large slice. My friends enjoyed their pizzas. I didn't get to try it so I don't really have an opinion on it.Service was good. Our server did check up on us a few times. Overall, love the chicken wings and would most likely order a ton the next time I dine here.
2016-12-30,5,They claim to have the largest slices. Largest in town, but I've seen larger. Regardless, its great pizza and a nice local/casual pizzeria dining atmosphere.
2016-12-13,5,This is hands down the best floppy slice in Hoboken. I have had many early mornings, lunches and dinners with Benny. To give you an idea of how big the slices are.. they are bigger than your typical newborn.The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because Benny's delivered is usually a little soggy. We end up putting each slice on the cast iron for a couple minutes to help give the crust a little structure. Benny's at the restaurant itself is the best. Actually nevermind, I really love Benny's - 5 stars it is!
2016-12-10,5,First time having the house pie. Split it with 6 other people; by far the best pizza I have had. Come here often but never get pizza but was in town and said what the heck lets grab pizza. Absolutely worth the $$$ but of course I didn't get through my slice. Packed my food today go. 2 out of 7 actually ate their entire slice. I'm pretty impressed bc their slices are massive! I'll be back for sure when I come back to Hoboken again!
2016-12-08,5,Great staff, good pizza, and the portions are huge!  Great place to get a slice of hoboken!
2016-11-21,1,My friend ordered from here without telling me. She knows I'm not a fan. She ordered and paid for a mushroom pizza and a diet Coke. We got a plain and regular Coke. She knew better than to even bother calling them because they have the worst attitude in there. If I saw the owners on the sidewalk on fire and I was rushing to take a piss I wouldn't spill a drop on them. The pizza isn't even good. It's on par with Dominos and those national disgraces. !@#$ this overrated place. No wonder they welcomed Biden. Same level of intelligence. If this place burns to the ground, we'd be better off.
2016-11-05,3,I was very disappointed the last time I went to Benny's. The pizza didn't taste as great as I remembered. I have to admit, the slices are very big and of course they are filling as well. On the other hand, they taste like any ordinary pizza, but just bigger. I went there a couple years back and the slices tasted so much better. I wasn't satisfied when I last went since they tasted like any other pizza. The last time I went my pizza was even pretty cool after they put it in the oven. I didn't even want to complain since I know they were really busy. If you're really hungry and don't mind paying for generic pizza then this is the place to go. I wouldn't really recommend this spot to anyone for pizza. The restaurant is always very messy, but I guess that's pretty understandable since I know they're very busy. Even though they are busy it's unacceptable for a restaurant to be dirty.
2016-11-01,2,While Benny's has finally moved into the 21st century on Delivery.com and taking credit cards, it seems they did that because their business has slipped a bit. Yes, they still have giant slices that you can put next to your newborn, but the quality seems to have slipped quite a bit of late.We've ordered delivery a couple times and the regular pie just hasn't been that good. I'd say it's average at best, burnt cheese (what little there is), bland sauce and kinda weird crust. We got the special with a calzone and it was just a clump of cheese on top of dough, it wasn't folded close or anything it was just a hot mess. No one would look at that thing and say "yeah we should definitely send this to a customer", but Benny's did. We were hungry so we just went with it. When you call they are still pretty rude. I think I may be done with the biggest slice in Hoboken and stick with places that are the most edible slices in Hoboken. One last thing, and this is no BS, the last 3 times I've gone to the actual restaurant Benny has asked me if I am Armenian or Russian and it's creepy. FYI Benny, I'm Italian and Irish.
2016-10-31,5,Biggest slice of pizza I've ever seen and usually that means it won't taste but that's not the case here. Best pizza I've had in a while
2016-10-21,5,I love Benny's. It's my go-to place for a quick slice of pizza. $3.50 for a huge slice of pizza (basically two normal slices) is a deal. I'll admit it's not the best pizza I've ever had but I've never been disappointed!
2016-10-16,5,Love these huge thin slices! Cheese melts in your mouth and looks like ninja turtle pizza! Excellent service! Fast and friendly!
2016-10-15,3,The service is fast but the pizza tastes very generic.  I wouldn't visit again!  It's the type of place you go once to say you've been there.  There is garlic powder, salt and parm on every table because they know it's mediocre pizza.
2016-10-12,3,As we all know the pizza is great, but the silverware was filthy...luckily, they had plastic ware.
2016-09-17,4,Benny Tudino's is a Hoboken icon. They have the best pizza, and the largest slice. They have great food, good prices, friendly staff. A must visit when you are in Hoboken.
2016-09-15,4,Nice atmosphere, huge slices had as advertised and there are more seats in the back. The waitresses helped in letting us know where to go and what to do!
2016-09-13,4,I came by to show some family members how large pizza orders can get. The shock value was worth it! I've been coming BT's since college and I'm always surprised about the ginormous slices and pies. We ordered 1/2 mushroom and 1/2 pepperoni of their largest pie. We ate 3 slices and took home the rest. The avocado salad was pretty good (huge portion of it too!). They packaged up the leftovers pretty well by taking each slice and plating them before putting them into the box so they won't stick together. Our server was sweet as pie and she was patient with us as we mulled over the menu. We sat outside so we love the fact they had covered outdoor seating for the nice day that we had. I would come back for sure!
2016-09-07,5,Great Pizza! One of the best. Great service! Need I say more? Small restroom.... So hopefully not claustrophobic, but a classic setting. Friend and I challenged each other to finish a 32" and the wait staff was cheering us on. Our waitress came and plated each piece for us. A must try for all pizza lovers.
2016-09-05,2,Ordered delivery, they forgot something in our order. Took 40 minutes for it to be delivered again which is ridiculous. We should all be able to eat as a family and not in shifts. Disappointed and will not order again.
2016-09-03,1,Did not receive any service so we left. Waitress passes us 3X to and 3X back from the NEXT table. Never acknowledged us. Another group of people arrived 10 minutes after us. They were given place settings, silverware and waitress proceeded to take their orders. I went inside to ask why we were being ignored and the "manager'' yelled at the waitress. She came outside to apologize and say she did not see us. Really? There are only 5 tables outside. 2 were empty. I'm 6'3" - 250 lbs. I'm hard to miss. Lied to my face.Manager or owner need to take lessons in running a pizzeria. Will NEVER go back. Bunch of clowns!
2016-09-01,3,This place isn't worth the hype. Food is like every other pizzaria in NJ. Service here is horrible especially the guys at the counter. The pizza sauce is personally too sweet and always undercooked. Chicken parm is okay but how does one mess up a chicken parm .. its pretty straight forward. If you want good pizza, I would hit up Johnny Pepperoni's uptown, worth every cent and the grandma slice is so good.
2016-08-28,1,I was so excited to go to Benny Tudino's since we moved to Hoboken 2 years ago. Not only was the slice horrible, the people who served it to us were even worse. So rude! Sorry that we inconvenienced you by coming in and then by (gasp) asking for a bag for our giant slice. I don't usually write reviews but when someone is THAT rude to me I can't let it go.
2016-08-20,2,Sad to say that Bennys is no longer what it use to be. We often use to make the trip from wherever to have Bennys at any hour. First thought they have HUGE slices at a decent price, why not! The slices have always been well worth it. However it seems in time Bennys has taken a dive in quality. I feared swinging by after checking out recent reviews on the decline of this pizzeria, but decided it's always been a favorite and maybe the reviewers caught the place on a bad day. Nope, they were totally right! For Bennys legacy I hope they find a way to get back to the basics for all loyal customers and more importantly jersey!
2016-08-20,4,Beginning my hunt for the best pizza in the area. This was good legit pizza. Nothing spectacular about the cheese, sauce or crust but a solid choice.
2016-08-13,2,I'm not one to trash a small business, especially a pizza place . Rest in Peace Benny, this place is no longer the same . The guys there always had arrogance all over them, But on a recent visit to Benny's it was the last straw for me . Slices were white on the bottom ( practically raw). I kindly asked the pizza guy for another slice and he snaps back saying nothing wrong with my slice. Fine, I ask if he can cook the bottom a bit more . Five minutes later my slice comes out and worse then it was before . I took another bite and off to the trash it goes . It's sad to see the quality of a once fine place deteriorate.
2016-08-11,4,I love this spot. The pizza is amazing!!!! The huge giant size pie is delicious and their sauce is great. I think sauce / gravy has a lot to do with great tasting pizza. I love the little outside patio and on a nice night love going and sitting outside. Their other dished though are just as good including their manicotti , and etc. Def , go there when you want a slice of pizza or a more traditional menu , they def won't disappoint you .... : )
2016-08-07,2,When you make pizza this large, you sacrifice quality and taste. Not something I would ever go for sober. Also, my boyfriend and I suspiciously both became very sick the following morning after eating slices from here the night before. Side note - if you're not going to modernize your business and accept credit or debit cards, you should probably at least have a working ATM on the premises.
2016-07-15,4,Every time I come to Hoboken I stop by this place even after having dinner with my friends somewhere else, I get a slice to go for lunch next day. The taste is consistent and there crust is so soft, it basically melts in your mouth. Ahhh I love this place. The workers are super friendly and always hook me up with the "largest" slice. And yes like EVERYONE SAID before my review their slice is huge!!!
2016-07-12,5,Probably some of the best pizza in NJ and definitely worth a trip to get one of the big slices.  Ask for some fresh garlic and it's even better.  Adding sausage to their slices is also a worthwhile addition.
2016-07-11,5,This pizza is definitely the best in Hoboken. The pizza's amazing and the beers are cheap, need I say more?
2016-07-06,5,Benny's is one of the only places I'd grab pizza from in Hoboken. I love their giant slices. Reminds me of the shore. Everything is perfect. And they serve beers too!
2016-07-05,3,Great pizza, terrible service. Sat at table and ordered sodas which arrived immediately. 10 to 15 minutes later still waiting for waitress to take our order. Finally order a pie with buffalo wings and french fries. Pie arrives about 10 minutes later hot and delicious, but the Buffalo wings are not placed on the table until after the pie was finished. The wings did not come with any type of buffalo sauce it just seemed to come with regular Tabasco sauce . French fries never arrived and we felt very rushed. I've eaten here before so I'll chalk this up to it being a very busy Fourth of July.
2016-06-26,4,This is not a gourmet pizza slice or anything of that sort. When you think of a classic cheese slice, Benny Tudino's is the place to come. The slice is, as many have heard, massive. But it is also made well. It is a classic pizza slice. The place is also open to 1 AM.
2016-06-24,5,Best place to grab a slice after or before going bar hopping. Make sure you have cash, if not they have an ATM. Staff is very friendly and fast.
2016-06-23,5,I really like this place. I brought my boyfriend here one night and he is absolutely in love as well. Pizza is always fresh and consistent in taste. Cool atmosphere. Awesome midnight snack.
2016-06-23,1,i placed an order for delivery online and about 10 min later my credit card was charged but when my food didnt show up over an hour later, i called.  they claimed they never received my order and they needed another 30 min.  when i said i wanted a refund they told me they couldn't refund me and i would have to call "the website".  then i was told the manager would be in tomorrow and to try calling then... i wouldn't suggest ordering delivery from here
2016-06-21,2,Came here and got watery lasagna that was undoubtedly warmed in a microwave minutes before it was served. They had cheap pitchers of beer though, so that was cool.
2016-06-19,4,I'd give this 5 stars but who runs out of calzones on a Saturday night??  Pizza is thin and delicious. Can't go wrong.
2016-06-10,1,that was the worst pizza of my life.im sick to my stomach, I vow to never ever eat here again.
2016-05-30,2,I had been coming here for years and in fact was the best pizza and biggest of all NJ but it seems to have changed owners and it doesnt taste the same service is bad and getting worst .. Was italian now seems to be arabs .. They messed up the dough .. Will never go back sorry
2016-05-27,3,After having a few beers.  This is the place to be!  Good ol fashioned HUGE slice of pizza.  Go for it! They also have beer.  Beer and huge slice of pizza? Can't go wrong.  Crust is doughy
2016-05-27,4,This a very unique hidden gem in the heart of Hoboken, NJ. This was recently rated the number one pizza joint in the state of New Jersey and I can see why! The restaurant has a very "home-like" feeling and is very warm and welcoming. The pizza slice I received was huge! When I folded it in half, it was crisp. The crust has a slight crunch while still really soft on the inside. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The bathroom was clean but, it is extremely tiny! I will be returning to this establishment in the future.
2016-05-24,4,Best pizza slice in Hoboken! Above all the rest. I pass by other pizzerias and ask myself, "Why?" If you ever go to Hoboken for pizza go to Benny's. Hey, even if you go out for a bar crawl, get some pizza afterwards. The place is definitely worth it. I suggest you get two plain slices because that is all you need. It does get packed and busy so be prepared.
2016-05-21,5,I'm speechless....I spent years making pizza, and this was def. The only place I have ever visited that I didn't negatively criticize the pizza lol. Worth going back again, the slices were enormous...that word does not even do it justice...literally enormous.
2016-05-15,5,As I was promised, they do have huge pizza slices.  I also had a really good chicken parm here.  Came with a friend who insisted I try it; good stuff and a very chill & casual atmosphere with later hours on a Friday night.  They were even nice enough to take credit card b/c we'd ordered a lot even though they usually are cash only.  I'd come back.
2016-05-13,5,Awesome pizza and the slices were huge. The pizza was so big they use two plates just support it. The staff is very nice and respectful.
2016-05-08,1,This experience ruined my pre Mother's Day hangout with my mom and my sis. First we walk in and place an order for 6 X-large slices. 3 of them with different toppings and the guy who took the order, looked annoyed bc he either didn't know how to spell spinach or was too lazy to make it. Right before we sit down, he's already trying to get us to pay and we didn't even get the drinks yet. Keep in mind, he looked aggravated that we were going to dine in. I was instantly aggravated. I mean wtf did he think, we were gonna eat 6 huge slices and run for the door?? To be honest, even if that was the case, it wasn't happening bc the entrance and the counter are literally on top of each other and the size of the space is an ant hole. So either way, one of the staff members would certainly catch up to you. My sis said brush it off. So I tried and we finally get the order. Ughhh!!!!! Back to feeling intense aggravation. The presentation looked & was disgusting. We got 3 slices with cheese, 2 slices with spinach and one with onions and he literally opened the spinach can and dumped it on the pizza. The onions were warm bc thank baby J the pizza was a little warmer. Seriously Dik?? Cold pizza?? $35 down the drain. I hate you!!!! I could have brought raw onions from home and saved the additional cost on the topping. I couldn't wait to fly out of there. Luckily, we ate with our eyes bc it looked better than it tasted, so we decided to take the other 3 remaining slices home. Us and our bright ideas. The minute I asked for a paper bag that lazy azz gave me the look of death bc he had to literally turn around and grab the bag, then hand it to me. And brace yourself bc it doesn't end there. My sister asked for a paper bag too and the look he gave her, was twice as vicious. My mom asked us to get her a bag and both my sister and I said NO at the same time. Eff that. At this point, I was willing to throw that greasy, tasteless, slice out anyway. I didn't know if I wanted to kick myself for ever suggesting this place or kick him just to blow off steam. Although my mom had a great night overall, I couldn't shake off this experience. I was so uncomfortable and another customer told me she ate outside just to avoid him bc he was just as rude to her. The guy seemed like he was either a racist douche bag or going through a divorce. Either way, I have lived in hobo all my life & The food in this city can be amazing. Don't believe the hype. Benny's used to be the spot back in the day but now they are just unpleasant in taste, quality, and clearly service. I wouldn't go back if the pizza was free. For a HOT slice with amazing toppings, taste, and friendly faces, you're better off going to Grimaldi's, Tony Baloney's, or Napoli's. Damn me!!! Why didn't I think of going there. Fakkkk!!!!
2016-05-05,3,I LOVE their pizza but to be honest, delivery SUCKS. When ordering over the phone the guy was so rude although we order from them all the time. Over the phone customer service makes me want to reconsider ordering food from her. If you want my business, don't be rude over the phone
2016-05-03,5,glorious pizza! these slices are bigger than my forearm and amazingly delicious! definitely the go to pizza spot in Hoboken, especially cause the slices are so big and inexpensive. talk about the best bang for your buck. Benny tudinos pizza = life!
2016-05-02,2,Great food , but worse service !! Never coming back here again. And make sure u don't get the waitress MELINDA !!!!! She was so disrespectful.
2016-05-01,5,By far, the tavern of cheese and crust hosts a masterpiece pizza to be proud of. Every single bite, you taste the next level of this enjoyable dish. Each individual slice being the size of my head, I fill my belly up with the late night snack of the glorious pizza gods themselves. I myself will always be a customer there and I'm happy of that.
2016-04-26,3,slices bigger than your head, however pizza isn't the BEST! The greek salad & sangria are also awesome.
2016-04-03,5,Great pizza place with super nice staff. There's some seating in the front as well in the back but it's a sit-down seating in the back. The pizza is like $3.50 but the pizza is massive. If you're starving you might be able to finish it but if anything share with someone!
2016-03-29,5,Why would anyone pay $3 for a tiny slice anywhere in Hoboken when for $.50 more you can get a huge slice from Benny Tudino's?!  I've been coming to Benny's since I was a kid and this was my lunch of choice when in high school.  The best way to judge pizza is by the slice and if you're looking for a good slice of pizza then take the walk on Washington to Benny's.  You won't have to sit around waiting as they are always on their A game for getting slices in and out quickly.  They have a back area for those who wish to dine in on other food items.  Front tables are usually reserved for those coming in for a slice.  Very important to note also this is a CASH only place.  So make sure you hit up the ATM before coming here.
2016-03-24,5,Love this place! Huge slices of pizza for $4.50 (: AND they're open late/stocked with beer.
2016-03-20,5,Food was delicious.  The price was impossibly low!   Service was fast.  Has the small pizza joint feel we were looking for.  I would come here again.
2016-03-19,1,Gross. All the workers stand outside smoking. I've eaten in the restaurant before, and witnessed a lady change her baby right there in the middle of the restaurant and then hand the diaper to the waitress who took it in the back. Ugh.Pizza is decent, but atmosphere makes it completely unappetizing. Head to Tony Baloneys, you won't be disappointed.
2016-03-12,5,I have lived in the NY/NJ area for over 5 years and this is the best Pizza I have had. HUGE slices and simply perfect!
2016-02-24,3,I waited 45 minutes for a chicken parm-sandwich. That is just too long. Sandwich also needs more marinara. Just get the pizza. I love their pizza, it is quick and delicious. If you take anything from this long and informative review, stick to the pizza.This is mainly for all the Stevens students getting food in between classes and don't really have 45 minutes to spare just waiting for food.
2016-02-23,4,It's hard to beat Benny's for the price that you're paying. I'm a huge fan of their HUGE slices - Benny's is a staple of my Hoboken experience and I bring all of my friends from out of town here when they visit.2 slices of plain cheese pizza and you'll be set for the day! The guys behind the counter are always friendly and welcoming as well.
2016-02-21,4,A Hoboken gem!! This pizza is so huge and well known !!! And it tastes great too!! Don't forget ta a cash only place!! Weather it's plain for pepperoni, this place is delicious!
2016-02-02,5,Love love love their pizza!  I love that they now deliver and that you can get single slices with all of your favorite toppings.  My favorite is sausage and jalapeños! . Every time I visit Hoboken, I make a point to grab a slice.
2016-01-23,5,WOW! So Big and Delicious (thats what she said) But really..... Its so good. Go here. Dont be stupid. Give it a shot. Its really good.
2016-01-18,4,The size of their slices is probably what makes them stand out above their competition. I ended up here as they were closing on a Friday night/Saturday morning. $3.50/slice, which isn't bad considering the size, but they made it clear they were trying to get rid of this particular slice, which was cold. I also didn't care too much for the cat running around the place. For all I know, my pizza may have fallen into his litter box and that's why they were trying to get rid of it, but in the end it tasted fine to me.For that one bad experience, I've had many, many positive experiences, which keeps Benny T.'s as my #1 pizza spot in Hoboken.
2016-01-11,4,Yum!  Huge slices of very thin and crispy pizza.  Can't wait to go back!
2016-01-10,3,I went for the novelty of ordering a huge pizza.  The pizza was good but the reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because we ordered garlic bread with cheese and it was literally some soft cut bread with garlic and cheese on it.  It was bizzare.  Would have been nicer of it was a bigger building it felt very crampt but I understand it's also Hoboken.  It doesn't beat my favorite pizza place but they made a good giant pizza.
2015-12-18,5,Cash only, and ask for the pizza well-done. It's delicious! Like mine with sliced mushrooms or black olives.Just plain good pizza. Nothing more to it. The great big slices are a fun tourist attraction. We love Benny's!
2015-12-14,5,The hands down best slice in Hoboken.  I've eaten them all, and nothing compares to a solid Benny's pie - not to mention their delivery is ON POINT.  These guys show up within 30 minutes every time which is a Hoboken novelty.
2015-12-12,3,Yup probably the largest slice of pizza you will find anywhere in North America!  Classic old school pizzeria with some of the best pizza in the area.   It's so well known that even VP Joe Biden checked it out a while back while traveling through the area.  Awesome pizza, enjoy!
2015-11-30,5,One of my favorites, weather you go to enjoy a slice of pizza, a cheap bite ($3.50 for a slice), or drunk food. This is the spot. The slices are huge so you only need to get one, it's cheap, taste great, and you don't have to wait. Every time I'm in Hoboken I stop in to get a slice.
2015-11-28,5,We were walking down the street when we realized that pizza is what we wanted. Benny Tudino's  pizza shop happened to be sitting right there in the side of the road. In we walked, and the largest slice of our lives was sitting there waiting for us. The pizza was amazing. But even more amazing was the service. What especially striked us was the fact that, at first, there was no room inside, so we ate outside. About ten minutes into our meal, an employee came outside to tell us that a table has opened up inside. That means that we were on their mind throughout the whole meal, which made us feel really good. We recommend this legendary shop to all!
2015-11-22,5,I've been coming to  this place for over 35 years, I traveled almost 3000 miles from Los Angeles California to eat this pizza. This place should be a national landmark. Nowhere in Los Angeles California will you ever get a piece of this delicious and amazing. If anyone has anything negative to say about the pizza in this place it's quite simple they don't know pizza. Sorry Mulberry, sorry Pepe's sorry Joes you have NOTHING NOTHING on the pizza here zero zilch !
2015-11-21,5,Our favorite pizza place in the US. We came here when my kids were young back in 2006 (living in Cincinnati). Now we live in Atlanta and have traveled over 700 miles to come here again. Nothing has changed and the food is still awesome. The biggest meatball sub you could ask for. And the largest slice pizza on the planet. One large slice will fill you up (no lie). Sadly, the owner passed away in September (God bless). A great place in a great part of town.
2015-11-21,5,Thought my hubby was crazy when he wanted to go for a slice of pizza in Jersey. Nothing wrong with that but we were driving from LaGuardia Airport, through the city and the very last thing on my mind was pizza. Coming here we scored parking right in front of the place, how awesome was that? We went on inside and I saw the slices and realized that me and my pizza loving daughter would most likely be able to split one. After eating there was a second I thought I would have to get another one tho lol. The pizza was awesome. Slices good and BIG. They have optional of getting to go or dining in. Have a pretty large menu (i mean, coming from thinking all they had was pizza lol) I could see parking being a pain if you don't get one right there. I just hope we score the same next time because from now on this is where we'll go for our pizza fix when visiting New York (Or Jersey).
2015-11-17,4,This is what Pizza is about...big and in your face slices....I personally am not a pizza lover but my wife and kids can live on the stuff (How come I am the only one that puts in on the waist...side note)Kids love the pizza from here, my 5 year old will put 1 whole slide down, twice as much as other pizza places.I personally have had a better slices in my travels...but for the NJ/NY area....we are probably talking top 1% of all pizza places.  I have not had their other food, but will have to try that at some point...but it seems we do go out of our way when we are in the area to grab a few slices to take home.
2015-11-16,5,The largest pizza I've ever had and it was delicious!!! My friends and I (6) grabbed a table and ordered one of their big pies with pepperoni on half of the pizza. They were not stingy at all as all of the pizza had homemade tomato sauce, cheese and pepperoni. We ordered a pitcher of Blue Moon with a few sodas and the total was only about $45. Great price!
2015-10-29,3,Decent pizza. Everyone who says it's the BEST pizza clearly never had NY pizza before.  Their sauce is too sweet for my liking.  I do like how big the slice is though .
2015-10-27,5,I live one block away from Benny Tudino's and hadn't tried it in the year and a half I lived there. For some reason, I just assumed just because it's the biggest slice doesn't mean its the best slice. I finally decided to give it a try... AND DAMN what I was missing. People rave about how big one slice is... well I had three. It was that good. It's a must have. It's also really awesome that they're open til 1am. Note though that if you're looking for the huge slice, if you order a pie instead of by slices, it's just regular size. Still just as delicious though.
2015-10-15,4,Great pizza, never seen slices so big!! Good bang for the buck. I typically take to go or sit outside on nice days and I think it has a nice atmosphere. The pictures on the oven of baby sized slices is my favorite part, cute touch! Haven't had anything other than the pizza but when I want pizza I go here :)
2015-10-03,5,Whenever I'm in Hoboken and I'm craving for pizza I always go to Benny's! The slices are huge and really good! The slice is $3.50 but really worth it!
2015-09-18,4,Big delicious pizza= amazing! I always recommend this pizza spot to friends/family that have never been to hoboken or have even had giant pizza. Will always come back for this.
2015-09-18,1,Sorry to have to write this review especially after growing up in Hoboken and being a customer for many, many years.  We decided to sit outside on this beautiful late Summer almost Fall day to enjoy the weather & atmosphere of good ol Hoboken.  It was about 4pm on a Thursday, nobody else sitting outside and hardly any people inside.  We ordered 2 plain slices and 1 with mushrooms and my daughter wanted french fries along with 2 sodas and a snapple.  Our (nice) waitress bought out our drinks and we sat waiting for about 15 minutes.  Now a different waitress comes over and asks if we ordered or need to order....told her no we ordered, she comes back to ask us what we ordered (so glad we only went with slices & a fry).  Finally the original  waitress comes back with the fries and then finally the pizza.  Pizza was not even warm and looked like they opened up a can of mushrooms and thew them on the other slice not even heating them so really not sure why it took so long plus the fact that they were not busy at all.  Fries were way over cooked for my liking and the ketchup was not Heinz as the label said but probably a store brand poured into the Heinz bottle.  So as we are eating  the guy comes out and starts washing the window?!?!  Really??!?!  As I said when we got there nobody was sitting outside, just us, and he came out to wash the windows as we were eating?!  If he had just waited a few minutes we would have been finished, only slices and fries!!!  We also were in the back in the corner near the window so as he is spraying this stinky cleaning chemical we could smell it, not very appealing.  Don't think we will be going back.  Very, very disappointed!
2015-09-15,1,Not a fan. Pizza is ok but the service is terrible. There is no common courtesy and they act like you should be privileged to be buying a slice of pizza from them. So many good pizza places in Hoboken that id rather go to one with a friendly environment.
2015-09-14,3,Went here with my girlfriend on a Monday in the early evening around 4 pm. Everything I got was mediocre. I got a small Caesar salad which looked tired (romaine was pretty yellow) and chicken fingers which, while crispy, were otherwise dry and stringy in texture. My girlfriend got spaghetti with garlic oil and she enjoyed it. Too much oil in the dish but we used the plentiful excess for the table bread. Service was decent, our order was taken promptly and our food was out quickly. Had to ask for refills of water. In hindsight maybe we should have stuck to pizza. Would not order the same thing if I come back.
2015-09-10,5,If you want to get a slice and a beer, this is the place! The pizza is very big and very tasty. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Hoboken. The owner is a very nice guy also. I wish they had one in Jersey City where I live.
2015-09-06,4,What a serious slice of pizza. Benny Tudino's I am giving you a serious kudos for representing a phenomenal slice of pizza in New Jersey. Now I have a place to bring out of towners to impress with your delightful slices.I am glad this pizzeria takes it over the edge with those huge deliciously amplified quality slices. Bravo Benny's..bravo..
2015-08-28,5,Benny's has some great, huge, baby-sized pizza. As far as pizza goes; it is pretty cheesy which I like, but the crust is so floppy. Good if you are out drinking and need a bite! It will definitely satisfy your craving.
2015-08-05,5,The best pizza shop in Hoboken! It's a great place to go and hang out with friends and family. The noise level is ok. The pizza is good but I prefer mine to be crunchier. They have a good variety of cold beverages. The pizza is so big, equal to the size of a new born baby! They have different types of pizzas with many toppings and Italian food.
2015-07-31,1,Good food, but terrible and extremely rude service. I have been coming here for 4 years but I decided to go there anymore. It's basically the bad experience you get with employees (from pizzeria to the waitress) that you can even had a good moment. Slow and after all the patience you can put they will throw the food at you.... Not worth it to come here anymore. Sorry Benny!
2015-07-23,5,Food was really good! I am picky because I am Italian so it's very hard to please me. This place was definitely worth it. First things first the slices of pieces are enormous. One slice is really equivalent to two slices. My stepson and I got two and split them in half. We then ordered the buffalo wings with mild sauce very spicy but nice touch with the blue cheese. We were very full after that so for the rest of the family we got one slice of pizza and a shrimp Parmesan sandwich. Everything was great! I always say that the sign of a good pizza is when even the crust is good .... This place definitely had it all!
2015-07-20,3,Good classic pizza and its huge but not the best I've had. Yes they have been around for ages but I am sure not everyone who works there has been around as long. Although the pizza is good it could be great if they were more consistent with how the pizza is cooked. The sauce and cheese is always good but the dough can be undercooked at times. Not sure if that is due to inexperience in the cook or a new fad of pizza. Either way the fact of the inconsistency leaves less to be desired. Simple fix make sure to ask for your pizza well done then your pizza will be worth the trip to this old school feel of a great generation of pizza artists. Now my ratings are strictly on the inconsistency of the pizza being cooked but don't let that discourage you. I yet need to taste their other plates and from other reviews and pics I've seen I am looking forward to it.
2015-07-11,5,After living in Hoboken for 2 years, we finally found our favorite pizza place!  Ordering a pie is different than a single piece - which is HUGE (you can share) - but it's always hot and so good.  I highly recommend this place for Hoboken Pizza!!
2015-07-07,5,The pizza was delish!! Service was great and the admit sphere was great. We had to eat inside since the outside was close. Always great to go to ones old stoping grounds.
2015-06-22,4,This place is great. Ridiculously huge slices. I usually have 2 and beer. The staff is very friendly and place is pretty decent. They also serve authentic Italian food which isn't pretty bad. If you're ever in the area, I would definitely recommend stopping by at least once and trying their pizza. Cash only which kind of sucks.
2015-06-22,3,The famous giant pizza slices live up to their name. The pizza isn't the best tasting though. I much prefer many of the pizzerias around the area but it is a must go just to say you've been there. The service is quick but not very friendly. I tried to have small talk like k do everywhere and the guy just took my money and ignored me. I guess they are busy so it's not a big deal but he could of at least replied or even smiled.
2015-06-21,4,I love the pizza here and it is the biggest slice of pizza I have ever had!! Everyone who works there is very nice and they always have good beer deals during the week! I love their sausage pizza, it is my favorite! The only time I've been disappointed here is when they told me their mushrooms were fresh when I asked and when I got my pizza they were definitely canned mushrooms, a slight disappointment but the pizza is still good!
2015-06-17,1,So I came here as a party of 4 and the kids wanted to sit outside. Unfortunately,  there's only one table that can accommodate 4 people and someone had a bag sitting on the table. I asked our waitress if someone was sitting there, she said, and I quote "yea, sit somewhere else". I should've left right then and there. But like an idiot I stayed. So I said, "where else would you like us to sit?" She pointed to a table set for 3 that was smack in front of a door. When I attempted to pull it out away from the fence, as she stood there watching me do it, she said it was blocking the door and it wouldn't work. So now I'm pissed. I said where would YOU like us to sit, as the 4 of us ate not going to fit at a table for 3. She then instructed me to move the table over to another table... like, me, physically move it as she stood there and watched.  My level of doneness is all the way on high. I'm writing this as I sit at the table waiting for her to bring our food as she stands and texts while she leans on the garbage in between runs to the passenger side of a black Acura parked down the street. I wouldn't come back here if the pizza was free!
2015-06-15,4,Definitly my type of pizza, greasy, cheesy, saucy, and good. ;-) I love the big slices of pizza. Also the fountain soda is a major plus. I'm a fan. They will see my pretty face more times than they can count because I love PIZZA!!!
2015-05-30,5,I really love this place.  Some people don't like the "style" of the pizza, but i love it.  Their dinner meals i think are even better than their pizza. Last night i had the Chicken Murphy.  Very tasty.
2015-05-28,4,I love this place! Yes the pizza is famous but go for the pasta or the hot anti past! Omg!! Fried chicken, eggplant,shrimp,hot sausage and mussels covered in melted mozzarella and sauce - is amazing !!!! The "Marco pollo" amazing!!!!! Garlic knots must be famous because it's hit or miss that they will have any after 8 pm!!! But if you are one of the lucky few- enjoy the savor them!!! The waitress there are great! They remember my "usual" ! I love it! It's always a great time. Date night doesn't always have to be fancy or pricey- sometimes casual and affordable is better- and as you can see by my many log ins I prefer this any night over a stuffy fancy place !
2015-05-25,3,Good pizza, but not great.  Very large slices, which I like.  I used to come here more often when I lived closer to it, but now I live near the PATH so I don't go here too much anymore.  I get cravings for it sometimes and the pizza places near the PATH aren't good, so sometimes I will walk over or order delivery.  It's definitely better than any of the pizza places near the PATH.
2015-05-19,1,The pizza was okay. Nothing special. I'd stop by again maybe to grab a slice to go, but would not dine in again. The service is slow... waitress is too busy sitting down at the table and texting to bother waiting on tables.The area outside to eat is what caught our eye, it was a nice fenced in area with flowers. However, what ruined the ENTIRE experience before our pizza even arrived - and then for the duration of our entire meal, was the multiple delivery boys loitering on all sides of the outdoor eating space CHAIN SMOKING. The delivery boys for this establishment. Who wants to try to eat pizza when they can barely breathe amongst the perpetual second hand smoke?!I'd understand if they were patrons, but there's no better way to undermine your own business than having your very own employees ruining the outdoor dining experience for paying customers. There were multiple families with children eating outside while this was happening... how disrespectful of the delivery boys. And shame on management and ownership for not keeping your employees under better behavior.
2015-05-11,3,Love the ambiance of this place. A fun, cozy, little family pizza place in Hoboken. The people were friendly, and the food was delicious. Honestly, the cheese pizza here was probably the best I've ever had. We ordered the vegetable pizza to go, also, but it wasn't as great as the cheese sadly. It was kind of like eating a salad on pizza crust, because there was so many vegetables and very little cheese or sauce. I know it's just a matter of preference but I would have preferred a little more cheese.But definitely do not miss the cheese pizza!!! Gigantic slices, reasonably priced, and yummy.
2015-05-08,1,Pizza cold. Pizza undercooked. Only plain for quick slices. Pizza guy wouldn't even heat up the slices. Ehhh I have had better Pizza. Recommend trying a tuna melt sandy but not the cold pizza.
2015-04-23,4,Good pizza, huge slices.. and the people who work here are incredibly friendly. Always a great place to pick up a quick slice after a long day of work!
2015-04-23,3,This place has been around for a while now, they have been serving authentic italian food fare since 1968. Last week we were craving pizza and decided to try this place. The spot itself is more suited for takeout rather than a sit down kind of meal. We decided to sit in the back of the restaurant. Ordered the plain cheese pie which was quite big considering the price which we paid.($15.25 for medium). The pizza was tasty and we enjoyed it.The Service itself leaves a lot to be desired at this restaurant. It seemed like the staff did not really cared much about the dine in customers. Staff was very loud while watching the ongoing Rangers match on the big TV screen.FYI - Cash only
2015-04-07,5,Just had a famous Benny's pizza slice. I have been coming here for more than 13 years. Hoboken is very proud to have Benny's, and when we have family from Costa Rica coming to visit for the first time, we always bring them here to enjoy the huge slices. It has become a family tradition.
2015-04-06,3,So many people have said this is the BEST pizza around, but I'd have to disagree. There's absolutely nothing wrong with the pizza, but it's nowhere near the "best". Yea, the slice is huge and costs $3.50, but it was just good pizza at best. Awesome portion to share a slice with a friend. I do love that it's an old school feeling Italian pizza place.  Definitely feels like a throwback when inside. Pictures show babies laying next to the slices and the slices are larger than a baby!If I'm walking by and hungry, I'd come back for a quick slice. I wouldn't stop here if I was in the mood for great pizza.
2015-03-23,5,This is my all time favorite piece of pizza! I am living away from NJ right now and I still crave the amazing Benny Tudino's Pizza! The people there are really friendly too!
2015-03-17,4,Forget the rest and get a larger-than-your-face slice at this hoboken pizza veteran.I'll say I'm slightly biased since this place is nostalgic to me while I was in college at Stevens. BUT! Even years later and trying more pizza places, Benny's is still a top slice. Don't let the size fool you, the pizza doesn't skimp on quality. The dough has the perfect balance of crunch and chewiness. The sauce is my favorite and the cheese brings home the goodness. However I took one star away because sometimes they have their off days and the pizza is on the undercooked chewy side.
2015-03-15,4,When in Hoboken there are a few places you must visit.  Benny's is one of them.Pizza is delicious, though its not unlike many other NJ/NY style pizzas in flavor & quality.  What really sets them apart is this:1. The size of the slice: Largest slice in the state. Requires 2 plates.  Folds in half and is still the size of a 'typical' piece of pizza2. The uniformly brown bottom crust.  I don't know how they do it. The pizza is ginormous and yet it cooks perfectly even on the bottom and throughout.  Order your slice CRISPY and it will be perfectly crisp, brown, and gooey.  The beauty of Benny's pizza is that it's not oversalted or oversauced.  And that two people can share 1 slice. But why would you wanna do that?!
2015-03-05,2,Ordered pizza from them on 3/5/15 They called me back and said the price had changed to almost $10 more, then the delivery boy says it was an extra $5 on top of that and they didn't get the order correct. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINT in a place that has been recommended so many times by friends doesn't know how to properly run a business and doesn't value customers enough to get an order correct.
2015-03-03,4,GIANT pizza slices at a decent price + open late + BYOB = best combo ever. Ask for your slice extra crispy or it could be floppy due to the size. Decent sauce and cheese.
2015-02-15,4,Pizza. It is so simple and an easy hand held food item. But then you go to Benny Tudino's Pizzeria where a slice of pizza is as big as a newborn baby. Literally. They have the photos on the wall to prove it. Plus, for $3.50 a slice of cheese ($1.00 per additional topping), it's the perfect price for your wallet.You're probably thinking, is the pizza good quality? I mean it's your standard big slice of pizza with hot gooey delicious cheese melted on top. I ordered the Italian sausage as my topping on top; sooo good. Spicy and flavorful and just delicious. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.This is the kind of place to come either sober or probably when late night shenanigans occur. Cash only, just as an FYI.
2015-02-08,5,Thin crust to die for. I happened upon this pizzeria in early January, just frolicking about Hoboken and trying to stay away from NYC. Having had TWO slices there, I realized I would probably never eat again. Their slices are ginormous. Unexpectedly great, sweet sauce. Love this place!!!!
2015-02-08,5,Best pizza anywhere! We miss it when we are not there. Try these huge slices!
2015-02-01,5,Love their plain slice! Sauce is on the sweet side and the pizza is on the salty side, but their dough is awesome!
2015-01-30,4,Don't make this difficult. Just get the pizza. Always just get the pizza. The salad is fine. The wings are more like fried chickens. The wrap, sure.Just get the pizza. And what a slice. It's literally the size of an infant. No, this isn't millennial overwrought speak and butchering of the language. There is photo evidence. And it's not just the size that will get you too. The pizza is good, too. Wash it down with the beer and wine they offer. Doesn't matter if you're drunk or sober, Benny's is the best pizza spot in Hoboken.
2015-01-30,5,When I'm in Hoboken, this is the place to get pizza before going to the bars. I sometimes dine in, or take out to the bar locations that allow outside food.
2015-01-24,3,Pizza is huge. Tastes good. The price is alright. The sodas are expensive, like most places, 2 bucks for a can. The atmosphere is very down to earth, no frills, no thrills. The people behind the register are okay, all business and ready to serve what you want. The place can use a slight makeover, maybe some new paint or something. It's pretty much the most hyped neighborhood pizza in the world, and there's nothing great to say about this place, but there's nothing bad to say about it either. Saw Joe Biden there once! I yelled at him "Where's your boss!?" he didn't say anything, but the secret service laughed. lol Google Joe Biden Benny Tudino's, he hit it up after hurricane sandy.
2015-01-22,2,Not a big fan of this pizza place. It doesn't live up to the hyoe and there's much better to be had in Hoboken. Cheese slides right off this huge slice and i don't like the tomato sauce they use. it's just not that tasty to me.
2015-01-15,3,pizza is big and certainly not disappointing or anything, staff is kinda rude
2015-01-08,5,Benny's is an institution in Hoboken.  Those who lived here and have eaten at Benny's always keep coming back once they move out.  The pizza is excellent and huge!  A novelty for some.  Thin slices that you need to use two hands just to hold it up.  The sauce is not too tart and they give you plenty of cheese.  The other dishes are not bad, but most people come for the pizza.  If I'm in Hoboken, Benny's is one place I have to go to.
2015-01-07,5,The people are extremely rude to me and when I order they give me the crappiest/ undercooked pizza. However, I send my boyfriend to get me a slice and it's amazing! One of the best pizzas I've ever tasted in my life, tastes just like New York pizza. The only bad things about this place is the attitudes of the people working.
2014-12-29,3,I am here right now as I type this! (Dec.29th 5 25 pm) great pizza If you like size .    Biggest slice around and they are not ashamed to make that their calling card. Quality wise I think it's middle of the road. What I've noticed about their pizza is that it's generally on the doughy  side and the undercooked side....   Which I actually prefer but if you like crispy pizza stay away or at least ask the guy to put your slice back in the oven to make it crispier.   I adjusted my ranking to 3 stars because I just found out that benny raised the price of his slices by nearly 17% from 3 to 3.50.....:(
2014-12-27,2,Benny's is definitely the place to go for pizza.  Until tonight I would have recommended their other dishes as well, but no more!  We ordered linguini carbonara, which had the most foul-smelling meat I couldn't stomach it.  And the manicotti was just glop.  I ditched my plate and found something else to eat in our freezer.  What a disappointment and waste of good money!
2014-12-25,2,$3.50 for a slice of cheese pizza that's the size of your face (maybe a little larger) sounds like a pretty awesome deal...but then you see how thin the pizza is and question how MUCH you're actually getting! Additionally, the pizza is on the greasier side and lacks a certain quality in the sauce..maybe some spices could help. I think this place is probably perfect for drunk pizza night, but other than that, pizza is abundant in jersey! And given that pizza is one of my fave foods, I've tried a lot and can assure you there are others to be tried :-)
2014-11-29,4,Huge, somewhat greasy slices of pizza with oldschool decor.  For a good slice which you absolutely have to fold, come here.In my younger, Jersey-living days I came here on occasion while out drinking in Hoboken.  Now, my GF and I were in town and a bit hungry around midnight, so a quick yelp search led us back to Benny's.Massive cheese slice for $3.50, which is reminiscent of Three Brothers in Belmar back when they used to be good.  The pizza is thin, a bit tangy sauce, good cheese which is a bit over-hardened, and a 4-napkin covering of grease.  But net net, it's good quality and one slice is good for somewhat hungry, two if hungry, and three if starving or insanely drunk.With a slice this big, folding your slice is beyond necessary.  I've been folding my slice since I was a kid, but my girlfriend never did.  After our slice here, she has come along to the beauty of the fold - no, it's not just for males from NY/NJ, everyone folds.Come here, get a slice, dap off some grease, fold, and enjoy.
2014-11-18,5,This was my first time ever and I was visiting with a co-worker for lunch.  This place is a must if you want pizza in Hoboken.  The slices are huge, fresh, and delicious.  I love the tomato sauce on it.  The quality of the pizza is impressive. The price is very reasonable.  More impressive was my fountain diet coke had carbonation and it wasn't syrup like other places.  Worth a trip from where I live for sure.  To bad I don't live closer!
2014-11-16,3,Pizza is still delicious. Staff and owner have taken a nasty turn in attitude. Only good for delivery these days.
2014-11-12,4,The slices are massive and they charge regular prices.  Pizza is B quality.That sums this place up.  No need to read other reviews I've given the public all they need to know!
2014-11-10,4,I havent really tried anything other than their extremely large slice that they serve. The good part about this place is that they serve liquor. They dont have a cocktail menu but they do have beers and white wine in the fridge. Recently we went here and they now sold Benny Tudino Sparkling Water. I cant tell u how horrible it was. It tasted like Hoboken tap water with Fizz. And i am really being nice about that. All in all it is always a go to spot late at night. Give up trying to look for a spot because it is Hoboken. The only time u will get a spot is by luck... Or if u pay for it.
2014-11-05,1,Eh....the pizza is just ok.  The serivce is terrible.  I called for delivery on a Friday night and was asked to hold.  The man on the other end then hung up on me.  Ok, no big deal.  I called back and the same man answered.  I let it slide since I figured they were busy.  We called back and ordered a Hawaiian pizza and a salad with Ranch ($29 total).  About an hour later, our pizza arrived.  The pizza looked like they had literally dumped a can of pineapple on top.  And the $6 salad.....well, it was hot, wilted  and upappetizing.  Clearly the salad was sitting on the pizza during delivery.  AND they forgot the salad dressing.  I called the next day and asked for a credit.  The angry man on the phone told me to call again tomorrow to talk to a manager.  I have dropped the issue since it is only $6, but what shame to treat a customer that way.  Won't go there again
2014-11-05,5,Best pizza and penne a la vodka in town.   Don't even bother trying any other pizza as you will be dissatisfied!
2014-10-19,3,I'm between 3 and 3.5 stars. Benny's definitely has the biggest slice of pizza I have ever seen. (You need two paper plates to hold it.) The pizza itself was only average. It wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special. It was actually kind of dry. I did like the toppings though. For a dollar I got a ridiculous amount of very delicious eggplant on it.
2014-10-16,2,I don't know why people rave about their pizza. I can't comment on their Italian dishes because I've never wanted to try them but their pizza is mediocre to blah-- just the size of your face.  I rather quality than quantity.  Nice staff though.
2014-10-16,3,The quality of the food compares to Two Bros though the size of the slice never disappointed. Known for making child sized slices, it's too bad they don't have child sized drinks to quench my adult sized thirst. The crab ravioli is not distinguishable from other types of ravioli as it is just swimming in thick red sauce. It could've been any other filling  and tasted the same. A bit of a let down for crab lovers. It might as well have been the ravioli parmigiana which is just plain ravioli. We haven't tried the toppings on the pizza, the slice on its own does enough to satiate your hunger.
2014-10-10,4,As kids in Hoboken we hit this. Best pizza all day.
2014-10-08,2,I thought the pizza was just somewhat average.  At $3.50 per slice, value wise its ok.  I'm not sure if it's an off day but I prefer my pizza to have more of a crust and the cheese hotter.  I would however go back if I'm in the area to give it another try.
2014-10-07,4,Good sauce = Good pizza. This place is an institution for good reason. Old school pizzeria. Their meatballs are also excellent. Please don't ever change.
2014-10-04,5,Huge pizza slices, thin crust, NY style, for uber cheep. Friendly staff. Can't go wrong here!
2014-09-29,4,The biggest slices your littles eyes can see!! Food is great here, I mostly really come for the slices, which you can't beat. Small place family owned has been around for many years. I like seeing the celebrity pictures of people who've gone there. Whenever you're in hoboken please go visit this place.
2014-09-22,3,I've been here several times and it's always the same average pizza. As a long time Hoboken resident I don't understand why this place is always crowded considering the many better pizza choices in town.
2014-09-09,4,Amazing Pizza by the slice. I love their chicken and Broccoli and good people. This is a Cash Only place so don't forget to take your cash with you. Took off one star because their sometimes their slices are bit too oily for me.
2014-09-07,3,Um... this is just slightly above average pizza that's the size of your face. Nothing else special about it. I didn't think it was the best slice I've ever had. I don't get it.. what did everyone else eat????Take the path or ferry across the Hudson and get yourself some pizza worth raving about.
2014-09-06,5,The slice is HUGE! The service was really great as well. Benny himself is at the restaurant a lot of times, so it's pretty cool to run into him.
2014-09-02,2,Benny's does not play when it comes to the "biggest slice in town" claim, and if there's a slice bigger than the two plates it takes to just barely carry one from Benny's, point me in that direction because holy shit. That being said, the pizza is a little too greasy for my personal taste. That combined with the heavy cheese and thin crust means it's going to get sloppy quick. I'm a little bit more of a 7 Star fan myself; this might not be for you if you're like me and want crispy pizza. I'll come back and try other things on the menu for sure.
2014-08-24,5,I have to say I really was impressed!! Came with my family about 20 of us we order the 2 house special Pizza they where huge slices it tasted really good!! The waitress and staff was very nice to us and it was very clean. Everyone had a great time we do recommend people to come and tast the pizza you won't regret it!! Me my family would come back again!!
2014-08-21,5,I was here last night with my girlfriend and her daughter and we had a great time! Her daughter couldn't finish That big slice of pizza! I grew up in Hoboken and when i get the chance to bring people to Hoboken I bring them here!
2014-07-31,4,For the size the taste is spot on. Been here a bunch of times. Great sauce. Great crust.Great ratios: sauce:crust:cheeseAbove I'm referring to the crust under the pizza. Sometimes the crust at the end of the pie is a little too thick....Note I have only had cheese slices. One slice is plenty for me though sometimes I get 2 bc I'm a glutton and very much regret doing so....My favorite pizza spot in hoboken. I drive past at least 6 other pizza places on my way here from my house in hoboken.
2014-07-31,3,Good slice, not great- the value is in the size. Big pizza and tastes average. Since the pizza in hoboken generally sucks it stands above most. Unfortunately, the guys that work up front at the pizza have a douchy attitude after 9pm. Maybe it's because they are used to drunk ppl all night but that's no excuse. Everytime I go there after 9pm stone cold sober they either try to charge me more for a slice, or they don't even bother heating up a slice that's been sitting out for 20+ minutes.  Tonight's pizza was barely luke warm. Very eh. Will only get when I'm craving pizza in hoboken where I live not where I work. For a better quality pie go to san guiseppe under the 14 st overpass
2014-07-24,3,I would give this place a 3.5 but not allowed. HUGE slices! Great portion for the value which is pocket change for a slice. I am not a fan of toppings just thrown on top of a plain slice though, which is what you'll get for all of them. Cash only place just so you know!!
2014-07-13,4,Benny Tudino's makes the biggest slices in the Northern, NJ area and possibly all of NJ. The slices are only $3 (not including any toppings) and for the size it's definitely worth it. I've been here many times and the slices taste amazing every-time. The Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday special is definitely worth trying. It includes the gigantic pie, 10 wings and a 2 Liter Soda for only $25. It will definitely be more than enough for a group of 6.  The wings taste great!! Super crispy, never soggy. Only reason why I can't give it 5 stars is because the bathroom is always a nightmare trying to use, although tables are clean the place is too clustered. The waiters are awesome and super friendly. If you haven't tried Benny Tudino's in Hoboken I recommend everyone to try it out and get the HOUSE Sized slice pizza. You won't regret it!! And if you love wings, give it a try... It won't be the best wings you had but I think it's worth trying.
2014-07-08,4,I should have written a review about Benny Tudino's years ago and thought I actually did.  Anyway, this truly is one of the iconic pizza places in Northern Jersey.  The one thing everyone should know is that the pizza slices are huge.  They are served on two paper plates overlapping each other to make the slice fit.  The toppings are generous as well.  I think a single slice should be enough for most people but if you feel like getting your eat on, a second slice should more than do it.  I've had their wings and other various foods there such as wraps and appetizers and generally I think they are decent.  The service for me has always been pleasant and I generally prefer to sit outside if the weather permits because Hoboken is just a great place to sit outside and people watch while hanging out with friends.
2014-06-24,2,Their slices used to be pretty damn good! It seems like they are starting skimp on the cheese and tomato sauce.
2014-06-22,3,I was torn about Benny Tudino's. Value-wise, it's great -- nay, fantastic. A giant big-as-your-face slice for pocket change? Sign me up! And I know I've had their (takeout) pizza in the past, and it was good. I've had pepperoni pizza, sausage & green peppers, and plain. All good. Thumbs up, Benny.We sat down in the front room, in view of the television so we could watch hockey. Pretty comfortable accommodations, at least until the oven's overhead fan conked out & the room filled with smoke. Oops! But who cares, right? These things happen. I tasted a piece of my fiance's meatball & sausage slice, and it was pretty delicious. Great crust, decent sauce, appropriate amount of cheese. Our fountain sodas were ice cold. The food came out quickly & piping hot. But I still have some issues. Let's talk about your Hawaiian pizza, Benny.Yes, I know. I am Italian, but I still enjoy a Hawaiian slice. Don't look at me like that! Anyway, one of my strong peeves is when the ham is deli-style, not chunk-style. And I'm not even talking strips -- this Hawaiian slice sported some full-sized squares of ham. It almost turns my pizza into an open-faced sandwich, and then I have to try not to drag the entire piece of ham off the slice, leaving a sad doughey cheeseless hole.  The pineapples were not incorporated into the cheese either, and they tumbled about as I struggled to eat my slice without wearing it home.So there you have it. A decent pizza place, with giant, economically-advantageous slices. Strongly recommended -- well, as long as you don't like Hawaiian pizza.
2014-06-18,5,One of my favorite pizza places in Hoboken, especially on a drunken night and an empty stomach. Their pizzas are huge and fresh and full of flavor. Great little hole in the wall pizzeria
2014-06-17,3,Have you ever been to Jumbo Slice in DC? This is the closest thing to that. It's a great slice that basically is a meal for a few bucks. The classic cheese is great as is the pepperoni. The slices are huge so you probably only need to order one. Great on the go!
2014-06-11,1,Wow talk about shady business - I called to order large Margarita Pizza which on their web page says 18 dollars.Guy on the phone tells me its "23 dollars to deliver"I then ask "Wait I thought the web page says its 18"Pizza guy says "yeah 2 weeks ago we changed are prices"I can see a dollar or two increase.  But going from 18 to 23 = 27% increase.So I then have my wife call and ask for the same pizza delivery and he says "20 dollars"Guess how much the delivery guy will get now when he delivers including tip.  23 dollars :)
2014-06-08,3,Their slices are hit or miss, usually miss. They come out raw half the time and they get mad if you ask to put them in longer. That said, they have some decent dishes on the menu. I like spicy so I get the chicken Murphy with extra hot peppers and it usually is right on.  They let me substitute pasta with a salad which is a plus. Service is usually okay, not excellent not horrible. Id give this place 3.5 stars but I can't and since they don't accept credit cards, they get 3. It's 2014, comeon!
2014-05-31,1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!! Their menu is totally misleading. I went there with high expectations to order a white slice of pizza. Well from what the chef explained to me, you can ONLY buy white pizza as well as certain topping if you buy an entire pie (ranging from $17-20). I didnt come to devour an entire pie. I just wanted a slice of pizza. The owner, Mr. Tuddino himself, was there and he was more interested in asking me about my hair than me leaving as an unsatisfied customer. I doubt I'll be back. The menu just didnt make sense.
2014-05-16,5,Wow, my first time at this establishment, and I am amazed. I read the reviews while at work today, and I couldn't resist but to go check it out for myself. The slices of pizza are enormous, so everyone that has reviewed this place before me; it's still on point with the massive pizza slice. I mean, I have never had a slice so massive in my life. Here's the kicker, it's a $3 slice of pizza, and actually tastes very good. I had a slice with ham, and it was just oh so tasty. If you want to eat at a place that seems to have a gag for there huge slices, this is the place, your kids will love it. If you just want a slice of pizza with your friends or family, this is the place. After a night of drinking in Hoboken, or NYC, and taking the bus or train back to Hoboken, and you need a good bite to eat, this is where you want to go!
2014-05-15,3,I'm sort of confused by of all the 5 start ratings.  They have your average, standard New Jersey pizza.  Yes the slices are over sized and its a decent value but it's not 5 star quality.  I like Benny Tudinos but I don't think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread.  It's dough, cheese and sauce; the ingredients aren't overly amazing; it's just a solid NJ pizzeria.
2014-05-02,3,It used to be better, back in the day! You could find me here..if I absolutely have no other choice. But the pizza has lost that flavor it once had. The sauce isn't too savory.. but nonetheless you can eat the slice. My biggest pet peeve is the guys working there. They are a little to flirtatious, hey I don't mind if your flirting but come on you burned my slice -_-
