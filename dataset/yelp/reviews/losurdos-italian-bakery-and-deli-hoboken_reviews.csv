2021-06-22,5,I've been to a bunch of Italian places while visiting family in NJ All your popular local favorites if you went there , I visited it.Let me tell you, all but one were very very good. But sometimes it's the sandwich and you need to give the place another go with a different selection.But this place hands down the best I've tasted in Hoboken and Jersey city.Sandwich melts in your mouth, the flavors exhume every bite , the quantity of everything on the sandwich is perfect the presentation is perfect The taste is perfect you literally want to cheer and scream and yell and that's exactly what I did when I took several bites of this sandwich outside the people around me stared and looked and I said this is the best   sub I've had in my whole life.Voted number 1 by me "Sub Guy" 2021So dam delicious
2021-06-18,5,What can I say about perfection? Love this place. Best salads, subs,  Mutz and ricotta, bread, off the charts of excellence, and anything Italian. Love it.
2021-03-04,3,It's good but I have had much better in Hoboken and other areas. I felt like their mozzarella that everyone raves about was just okay. I had chicken cutlet with mozzarella and roasted peppers. A bit underwhelming
2021-02-19,5,I've only been in Hoboken for less than a year but Losurdo's has quickly become my favorite spot in town. Everything I've ever got here has been absolutely delicious; and I mean everything! Some of the best pizza in Hoboken, amazing sandwiches, fresh bread, and the best chicken salad I've had in my life. They also have great deli options and a great selection of imported Italian goods. The staff is so friendly and helpful and they run a constantly updated Instagram page where you can find all their daily specials. Still need to try the Buffalo chicken pinwheels!! This place is special!!! Mutz to rival Fiore's. A must visit.
2020-12-23,4,Purchased a chicken cutlet sandwich today.  The chicken was by far the best vs it's competitors.  Ordered 3 lbs of mutz. I tried it as soon as I walked in my door (don't worry, I didn't eat all three lbs). The mutz was good but I have another favorite in Hoboken so far.  But everyone likes different things, so please try it for yourself.  It was very creamy and much better than anything you can find in store.  I also bout the imported/domestic prosciutto.  I tried the imported tonight.  It was pretty solid and pricing was reasonable. I decided to get cannolis before I left too.  I was trying to save them for tomorrow, but they looked sooo delicious I had to try; you know, to "taste test".  The filling is not something you will find at your local grocery store and probably not most bakeries.  This is one true Italian cannoli.  I would have eaten all four but know my family would disown me if I did so.  This is great place if you want Italian pasta and condiments as well.  Great selection while your social distancing.
2020-11-15,5,Amazing chicken cutlet sandwich. So fresh and all the ingredients are simple and delicious.
2020-09-23,1,I bought ham and salame and they were good although pricey. The bread was just ok but nothing like real Italian bread. The store has a lot of old stuff on the shelves. I bought some cookies that were stale and some other imported products that were old. They had covered the expiry date with a black marker, but the product had the expiry date on the individual wrappings inside, so I saw that they are selling products that had expired over 6 months ago. I found this very unethical.
2020-08-29,1,I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt because I liked this place a lot, but on several occasions now I have seen employees and/or customers not wearing their masks properly or at all.  I'm done being the customer of businesses that refuse to practice or enforce safety standards for the customers, especially during a pandemic when it is required that everyone indoors in a business is wearing a mask.
2020-08-26,3,First time there so wife and I weren't entirely sure what to order, but got a couple of sandwiches + a bunch of italian groceries. They were fairly well organized, they have a system for ordering (which you don't really know until you've ordered before) and were trying to keep people apart due to COVID. So far so good, but the sandwiches weren't really anything to write home about. They were OK. But what was like, wth, all the grocery items we bought were expired.Maybe they're better as a sandwich shop, but don't tag them as a grocery market or anything like that. Be careful with the shelf products you buy... check expiration dates.
2020-07-08,5,Among good, amazing staff and amazing prices!  Highly recommend a trip to this Hoboken gem!
2020-06-28,5,This is the best deli in town. Delicious fresh bread, great imported goods and delicious sandwiches...all served by great people. Just go.
2020-06-24,5,Best place for hoagies in the Hoboken/Jersey City area !   Staff is always nice & the food is so damn good.   Gives a very positive, hometown feel when you're in there !
2020-05-23,5,Best deli in Hoboken! Their sandwiches are tasty and definitely hefty (I usually split mine into two). Their focaccia is also very good but you have to get it pretty much right after it comes out of the oven since it's so popular (I believe it's in the 10-11 am range on either Saturday or Sunday, but I always call ahead to make sure). Staff is very friendly.
2020-04-28,5,They have the most amazing sandwiches and cold cuts. For sure our go to spot. Try to get their early to catch the specials of the day! My husband loves the roast beef and gravy I'm a hold out for the buffalo chicken pinwheels on Fridays. I also have to say they are so incredibly kind to my 9 year old son, which just speaks volumes for who they are. Good people and they make delicious food!
2020-04-21,5,These guys are the real deal. The BEST mutz in Hoboken. I know that's a bold assertion but it's true. Everything is made fresh on premises including their bread. They make all the old school Italian specialities that you grew up eating for different holidays, my personal fave is the Pizza Rustica at Easter. Also their foccacia that they make on Saturdays is so good: light and airy not heavy at all. My advice get a baby foccacia as a sandwich! Better be there right when the foccacia comes out of the ovens at 11am otherwise you're going to have to fight all the Nonnas. Another bold statement: best cannolis in town. Yes, they are better than that "famous" baker in town. You pretty much can't go wrong at Losurdo's!
2020-04-21,5,This is my go to Italian deli! Losurdo offers delicious homemade items. The homemade dry sausage is delicious, far better quality than anything you'll find at a super market. Fresh baked bread is also delicious, and freezes well. You'll be the hero of any gathering if you bring treats from Losurdo's
2020-02-02,5,One of my favorite places in Hoboken and everyone is extremely friendly. Prices are fair, and everything is fresh and delicious.
2020-01-21,5,Old school corner Italian deli. Everything I've had is fresh and first rate. The wacky local clientele who stop by on a regular basis only adds to the charm.
2020-01-09,4,-Fantastic spot to find classic Italian products -They sell a huge variety of dry pastas -Sandwiches are filled with meats/cheese/veggies-They offer whole wheat bread -They sell focaccia that is terrific -One of my favorite spots for fresh mutz
2019-11-12,5,Best mozzarella in Hoboken (but don't tell anyone as to not make this amazing deli more crowded). Sandwiches are delicious (you have the bread to thank for that), and the cookies at the counter never fail. Plus, some good options to take home in the freezer and other Italian brands/specialties throughout the store. A gem!
2019-08-25,4,In all my time in Hoboken, I've really haven't ventured out to try the local Italian delis, outside of a brief trip to Lisa's when I first moved here. That said, I had heard great things about Losurdo Bros from one of my good friends and knowing that it was in close proximity to my boyfriend's place, he and i had to try it out.The place itself is a true Italian grocery with authentic Italian goods, bakery, and deli, with the deli being the big draw. At 1 PM on a Sunday, the place had sizable lines due to the fact that the entire place was being run by one of the owners and two other employees (Son? Nephew?). When we got to the beginning of the line, we ordered our sandwiches (roast beef with mozzarella for him, turkey and cheddar for me). The staff was FAST, but also friendly and wanted to make sure we got the correct order. Price point was solid, not too pricey ($7-$10 per sandwich depending on meat). We ended up going back to his place to eat and we both loved our sandwiches. The bread had good balance of crunch and softness and the meat itself was sliced freshly and had good flavor. My boyfriend particularly loved their mutz, which was soft and cheesy. We'd definitely go back here sometime soon!
2019-08-03,5,I'm new to the area.  Like very new.  I moved here from Mississippi and this was my first Italian Deli experience.  Everyone was so polite and helpful.  I'm really hoping I didn't pick the best one first because if I did it's all downhill from here.So, I don't know prosciutto from...well...any other Italian meats so I just asked the gentleman to make me whatever.  I got a chicken cutlet sandwich with greens, red peppers, mozzarella and vinaigrette (I think) on the most wonderful bread I have ever eaten.This is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had and the friendliest staff I've ever met made this a very cool "welcome to Hoboken" experience.I'll be back often and highly recommend this place!
2019-07-26,5,Its always fun to visit this absolute Gem in Hoboken.  Always clean and friendly along with the BEST ITALIAN DELICACIES.  You can never go wrong at Losurdo Brothers.  Danny and Nicky make old school Italian food better than any other deli in Hoboken.  Most of the Delicatessens in Hoboken could never match the Quality, Cleanliness and Perfectly prepared meals that they serve.  I will always suggest that anyone who wants a great sandwich to stop by Losurdo Brothers.  Its gonna take about 2 seconds for you to be hooked
2019-05-22,5,Every time I visit mg daughter I take a morning walk to this bakery for their cappuccino and yes, sometimes a sweet or a bread for lunch . It's just so good ! Their cannolis are one of the best I have tried .
2019-05-09,5,Love this local deli!! Workers are so friendly and helpful! Food is delicious as well, I usually go for a weekend sub! Only request is I wish they were open till 7 instead of 6, cause I'm never home on the weekdays before they close.
2019-02-27,4,There's a lot of choices if you want an Italian deli in Hoboken. I've tried most of them and Losurdo's doesn't get enough acclaim. I'd put it third on the list. Behind M&P and Fiore's but ahead of Vito's. That's a pretty good result considering the competition. This place hasn't been packed any of the times I've come in. The food is really good. The prices are fair. There's also a solid option of breads and focaccia. The staff is friendly. It's not easy to stand out as a deli in this town but Losurdo's deserves more attention and customers.
2019-01-30,5,Best sandwiches in Hoboken with the best customer service. Definitely won't be let down coming to Losurdo Bros
2019-01-18,5,our focaccia bread go to place! they only make them saturdays so we always need to plan it out to snag a few before they run out very quickly. such a cozy, feeling like homey spot..
2019-01-02,1,Ordered a catering order from here for my daughter's first bday party. The prosciutto sandwich got everyone who ate it sick. Not sure what they did. Not going back!
2018-12-18,5,Hands down my favorite love coming here every day I'm addicted to it the muzz is to die for. Yesterday I had a chicken muzz and slept for 1 hour!!!!!! Be back tomorrow
2018-11-18,5,The absolute BEST deli in Hoboken. My boyfriend and I had been getting mutz and meats from other delis until recently until we stumbled upon this gem. Authentic, fresh, and a real party pleaser. SO happy we found this place!
2018-09-08,5,This is my go-to neighborhood spot! Friendliest staff, true Italian feel. I have never been disappointed with anything I have gotten! The raviolis to the fresh mozzarella!
2018-07-12,5,Phenomenal meats and the best fresh mozzarella. Sandwiches here are incredibly fresh and huge - definitely more than enough for two meals, and still taste just as great even after a day in the fridge (if you can resist that long!) Losurdo's looks very unsuspecting from the outside, but is definitely a must-try in the area.
2018-05-26,5,Losurdo Bros has been one of my favorite delis in Hoboken for a while because of how incredible their homemade mozzarella (mutz, in Hoboken terms) is, and it recently moved into first place. That's because I finally experienced sandwiches on their focaccia. They make focaccia every Saturday (you can call to reserve your preferred type), and it's the best focaccia I've ever had--that nice fried bottom is to die for. If you ask them, they'll slice the whole thing through the middle and build a humongous sandwich on it. Big enough to feed four people. I'm vegetarian, so I just have mine filled with mutz and all sorts of veggies (despite how their menu appears, they actually have lots of good vegetarian options: eggplant, peppers, sundried tomatoes, arugula, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, etc). They're true artists and super friendly, so I just let them throw whatever they want on it, and it's always great. In summary, you have to try one of their focaccia sandwiches: they're the best sandwiches ever.
2018-01-30,5,Truly authentic. Best Italian Deli in Hoboken without a doubt. Good people and even better food. You will not be disappointed.
2018-01-20,5,Love this deli.  Good price, good sandwiches.  Guys are always fast, nice, and never make a mistake.  Only thing that could improve is if they wore gloves to make your sandwich.
2018-01-15,5,I have returned many times. This is the best deli in the world: the freshness and quality of the deli and everything here is top top notch. One enters and is treated with the greatest warmth and love like family. The homemade roast beef is addictive, as is the fresh mutz, the fresh breads, focaccia, cookies: everything. The market has Italian dried goodies that are also top notch including, pastas, pickles, cakes, cookies, herbs, Italian coffee, you name it!! Thank you Losurdo's!!  So grateful for you!!!
2017-12-15,3,This deli offers some great items home made sausages at the weekends, great sliced meats, the Palma ham and mortadella are very good, cheeses and breads and pastries. The only downside is it can be very frustrating to shop here as the counter service can be chaotic, a phone order will come in and your abandoned while that's taken care of .... this can be generally avoided by shopping at none peak times, however be warned it can make you walk out the store or it has me !!
2017-08-24,5,Best of the best! Love the mutz, but also they have their own fresh breads, Italian cookies, plus salads and deli meats and cheeses. They also have lovely, real-deal products from Italy like Kimbo espresso.
2017-06-20,5,The best hidden gem in Hoboken! Cant beat the sandwiches and pre-prepared food & the small neighborhood feel inside.
2017-06-19,5,Hands down best Mutz in town. Not even a question. Would never have known of this place unless I lived back here.
2016-09-30,4,The eggplant parm was better than my mom's and for me, that's saying a lot! The food seemed fresh and made to order. It was topped with just the right amount of cheese and marinara. The portion size was also good. I would definitely recommend ordering from here; you won't be disappointed!
2016-08-30,5,When speaking hoboken delis everyone screams luca brasi's and Fiore's.  The real GEM is losurdos. They have the best deli sandwiches along with amazing mozz.  They carry the finest Italian imports and most importantly everything always taste prime. This is the SPOT.  Love it and once you try it you'll love it too!
2016-08-21,5,I don't know how to pronounce mozzarella, and I always forget the difference between prosciutto and capicola. However, I went up to the counter and asked "what's the best thing here?" And the dude just nodded and proceeded to make me the best Italian hoagie I've ever had.
2016-05-04,5,This place is great.  The gentleman w the mustache is a classic.   You can tell there is care and love put in that food.
2016-04-28,5,My personal favorite place to get fresh mozz I belive its the best in town everyone treats you like family.
2016-04-06,5,I've been coming here since I was a kid and every time I eat here I always leave satisfied. Living and working only a block away from this gem is great for when I'm looking for a meaty deli sandwich during lunch hours or buying cold cuts and fresh baked bread on Sunday morning for breakfast. The deli sandwiches are definitely the highlight of this place. Whether it be their cold sandwiches like fresh mozzarella and turkey sandwich with roasted peppers or a hot sandwich like their chicken cutlet, you're guaranteed to leave full. They do not skimp on the meat. They offer a great selection of domestic and imported deli meats and their bread is freshly baked on site. They also sell pizza on Thursday and Friday that is a must try and is only $2 per slice or $4 for small personal pie which is very rare in Hoboken to find pizza this good for that price. They also have a great selection of Italian pastas, seasonings, and pastries. They offer catering services for special events and have great daily specials. The staff is always accommodating and attentive. Prices are more than fair with sandwiches ranging from $7 to $9. Price of deli meat and bread depends on what kind you get and how much of it. I come here at least once a week for my sandwich fix and recommend this place to anyone looking for fresh tasting food any day of the week.
2015-11-01,5,We just moved around the corner, and dropped by on our way to pick up our Zipcar.  What an amazing surprise!  The spicy sopresatta sandwich with mozzarella was mind-blowing.  Everything here was delicious, and the guys behind the counter are super sweet and helpful.  Love it!
2015-09-06,4,Came to Losurdos for lunch sandwiches on Labor Day Saturday. The place is a charming and relaxed Italian deli on a relatively sleepy block (Adams and 2nd). You walk up to the counter and see a large menu of sandwiches - none had funny names - just types of Italian meat, types of cheese and then some toppings. You can also order a sandwich that's not on the menu - what we you want. I ordered a chicken cutlet on a hero with hot peppers, mozzarella, oil and vinegar on a hero, a chicken cutlet with cheddar and mayo on a chicken cutlet and a hot soppresata, mozzarella, roasted red pepper and balsamic on a hero. The bread was excellent - soft with a slight crunch. The best sandwich was the soppresata - the meat was spicy and tender and the mozzarella fresh with the slightly sweet roast peppers. They didn't oberstuff he sandwiches either - which I greatly prefer to the Jewish deli meat stack. The chicken cutlets were good but I prefer fried chicken to be slightly fried version at Losurdos...even though I'm pretty sure Losurdos makes quality cutlets. I can't wait to go back and try something else - they didn't have pizza out when I went but would love to try. They also have a pretty impressive little market of Italian foods. As the other reviewers said - you will find people speaking Italian - old ladies to the guys behind the counter - adding to the authenticity.
2015-08-29,5,Some of the best sandwiches in Hoboken!! A hidden neighborhood gem where you'll find old women talking to the guys behind the counter in fluent italian and sharing family stories. Come here for the sandwiches (I recommend the turkey/mutz or soprasatta/Sharp provolone) and the fresh sweet/hot sausage for a family dinner. You'll quickly feel like a hoboken local :)
2015-06-19,2,Called and asked, do you sell Italian cookies? You know the title states "bakery"' person answering said yes.  I get over there and no showcase of Italian cookies to be found.  Yes, cookies were there but packaged like I could buy in ShopRite.What a waste of time and not to mention the parking situation sucks there.
2015-04-19,5,My favorite place for mutz in Hoboken. I could come here every Sunday and get a sandwich. The guys are fantastic to chat with. If you haven't tried this place yet, you better get on the ball!
2015-02-02,5,The bottom line, Danny is THE man.  In baking all their own bread (i.e Hoboken Bread, NOT insulting Subway crap they refer to as "bread"), it makes their sandwiches hands down, the best in this land of Hoboken.  And in a town where people take their sandwiches personally, it's saying more than you even know.  They are true sandwich craftsmen.  The ultimate masters in sandwichology.  Beyond the homemade roast beef or the euphoric eggplant parm hero, the pizza is a MUST.  The Sicilian is beyond words, and both the Sicilian and the traditional slice served have the crispiest, tastiest crust of any slice going.   I'd go now if it weren't Monday.  NOTE: never leave without a biscotti or some other baked cookie delight they've got in the case as a tasty treat for later, and to remind you of the damn awesome sandwich you had earlier.  Forgetaboutit.
2014-12-08,5,Italian Style Portions! (No Skimping Here!) Losurdo's Italian Bakery & Deli ("Tony's"), is a Hoboken MUST.  The staff goes over and beyond to be accommodating and helpful.  Immediately upon entry you are met with that at home, relaxed, no judgment atmosphere.  Even if you walk in not knowing what you want, Losurdo's has tons of daily specials, varieties, and several diet options.  Whether you want a hot or cold dish, soup, pastries, or Italian candies, Losurdo's has it all!
2014-10-25,5,My new lunch spot!  I've been in Hoboken for over a decade and amidst the sea of Italian delis, this place took me by surprise. First noticeable difference, friendly service!  Next and maybe most important, awesomely amazing bread!!!  They're also a bakery, ergo the bread being fantastic. Daily lunch specials go quickly so call ahead and get the rundown.  (There's also a gourmet Italian specialty market.)My favorites (so far):  Eggplant Parmigiana, one of the best in town. Prosciutto/mutz/roasted peppers - this prosciutto melts in your mouth!  Pizza - Sicilian, regular, french bread - in that order. Sliced wheat Italian bread - there's a loaf in my freezer right now!  Cookies; but then who doesn't love cookies?  You'll love these more!  I've been told they have the best tuna salad and shrimp parmigiana as well (by one of the pickiest people I know).If you're looking for something new, you owe it to yourself to give this a try. I'll be forever grateful for a friend's suggestion and now I've paid it forward!  So much to try, so few notches on this belt!
2014-08-09,4,Very good prosciutto, mozzarella and rosted red peppers sandwich!  Ingredients wre fresh, tasty and portions were generous. Very friendly personnel.
2014-04-19,5,Excellent Italian Market. Always interesting selections. Great ricotta, cheeses, breads, pizza. Great pastas in the fridge. Always can find my Annelleti pasta!
2014-03-11,4,A healthy Italian Deli in Hoboken? Who knew?  I have been a fan of their mozzarella since I went to the Hoboken Mutzfest in January. I finally had a chance to go back today after my initial visit about three weeks ago was thwarted by their being closed on Mondays. They have whole wheat and gluten free options which I like and don't normally see in Italian Delis. I ordered two sandwiches. My standard prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, roasted peppers and balsamic vinegar. The other sandwich was roasted turkey and Swiss cheese with lettuce, tomato, oil and vinegar. Even though I was looking forward to my sandwich I let it marinate for a couple of hours so the bread got nice and spongy.   The place smells awesome when you walk in, with baked bread and pastries. I also had to bring home some of their delicious fresh mozzarella. The prices are pretty standard, about 8 dollars a sandwich. I have had larger, but, THIS IS THE BEST MUTZ I HAVE HAD. (So far)  :).
2014-01-03,5,The deli sandwiches here are amazing. $7 for a huge sub chock full of big hunks of mozzarella and Italian meats. Can't wait to come back here and try a few of the other sandwiches.
2013-12-17,4,Hoboken's Italian bakeries are dwindling in numbers with each passing year. Luckily, the Losurdo brothers continue Tony's Italian Bakery's tradition of baking fresh bread daily. Plain or sourdough, all kinds of shapes and sizes. Walking in the bakery you'll almost always hear Italian being spoken by one of the guys or old-time customers. Losurdo sandwiches are always packed with lots deli meats. Not as much as Carnegie Deli 1-pounders, but still more than enough. They stock both imported and domestic meats, my favorite being a hot Calabrese salami which I'd order by the 1/2 pound sliced, and then sliced again down the middle or it'd be too big for crackers. It is simply the hottest, spiciest salami I've found in the Six Boroughs (haha). They also have a good assortment of pickled items, imported Italian pasta, cookies and goods, cheeses and fresh mozzarella. A friendly staple of the neighborhood where I'm sure many folks stop by daily even just to say Ciao.
2013-07-21,4,Our first visit earlier today, while in Jersey City. Travelled through HOBOKEN for some good Italian bread... Excellent fresh ricotta bought for our Cavatelli. The Parmesan Reggiano cheese was awesome! Looking foward to another visit! Gonna make some ricotta pancakes with the rest of the ricotta that was not used for dinner.
2012-07-03,3,Very tasty parmesan sandwich with eggplant. Yes, you read right. I ordered an eggplant parmesan sandwich and there was so much cheese (and very little eggplant), I was so disappointment. The little eggplant I had was delicious though.
