2021-10-15,5,As a hungry vegetarian coming to Mikey Square hits the spot. It is a place where there's happiness all around me great music great food and best of all great prices. I haven't been here or near the area for 13 years and I came back and the food is as good as it was back then.
2021-07-27,1,Don't put anything in the comments for take out, asked for no blue cheese and two times my items (buffalo chicken salad one time and buffalo chicken wrap the other time) were drenched in dressing.
2021-06-23,3,More like three and a half stars. I wasn't very impressed by anything I consumed here. We ended up splitting a chicken salad some drinks. Nothing very much stood out but what did stand out was how incredibly slow the service was. We were repeatedly ignored and if I had to do it again I probably wouldn't eat here. There is no parking in the area you have to park elsewhere and then walk several blocks
2021-05-02,1,Horrible service! We came to eat , the server came to asks us for drinks and never came back to ask what we wanted to eat. And kitchen ended up closing. - Patty and john were our servers. Horrible!!
2021-04-04,2,Not the best experience unfortunately. Have been waiting to try this place so we visited for some drinks and an app. Our waiter Sat us, Forgetting the menus, came back to take our order but we still didn't have menus. And she dropped off the menus she didn't come back for another 15 minutes, so another waiter had to take over our table after asking him for help. Our new waiter was lovely, he had create energy and made our experience a lot better, so this has nothing to do with the waiter. Me and my girlfriend ordered 2 bloodys and my cousin a coors, also waters for the table. We waited 10 minutes for the waiter to get back and he let us know that the bar tender was changing the keg on the coord, and that they were creating a new body mix for us. We are fine with that. 25 minutes later the waiter came back with the coos, but no waters, and let us know that they don't have enough ingredients to make bloody Mary's. After already waiting so long, I ordered a water, nachos and a vodka soda. The nachos came out before my drink came out, which were not even very good.The waiter came back with a small vodka soda that was about one sip, and had no alcohol in it.  The place was not crowded or busy so there was no reason for the long wait. In addition, I went to the bathroom and there was no toilet paper, soap, or paper towels during a pandemic. Would not return unfortunately :(
2021-02-21,1,I like the food here but the service for my indoor brunch was unfortunately bad. The waiter wore his mask below his mouth as he took our orders and brought us our food.  We were seated by the door which we accepted due to distancing,  but then the owner himself propped the door open and kept it that way for a while (it's winter). We didn't understand why until after a good 5-10 minutes he wheeled in what looked like a delivery... not only did this make it incredibly freezing during the indoor meal but the French toast pictured here also got cold.  He was not rushing to close it or apologize. Our presence was not acknowledged at all. I understand if you can't control delivery time, but it would have been appreciated if he or the wait staff at least acknowledged that we were there and tried to keep the door closed until he had to bring in the packages. Then the waitress almost charged us for someone else's meal that was double the price. Luckily I caught it on the receipt and it was corrected.Oh and the bathrooms lacked toilet paper and soap.   like they were still in the drunk crowd condition from the night before .
2020-12-19,1,This place is a nightmare. Horrible service from wait staff, waiter forgot to put in our order 2 times. Waited 2 hours for our food. Also no employees were wearing a mask. Do not recommend going unless you want COVID. AND worst of all, I got food poisoning from the lobster Mac n cheese.
2020-11-30,5,Great sports bar in Hoboken. Everything is good, especially wraps, nachos and sangria. Trivia night is a ton of fun. They have heat lamps too!
2020-10-20,4,Came here for some beers and some apps with friends . Never eaten here before but we got the nachos and wings . I didn't taste the wings but the Nachos were very good and quite large . The wings took a little long and they comped a beer . Great service and food ! I'llBe back to try the burger
2020-09-27,1,Pretty appalling how bad the service is here.. first the waitress gives us the wrong order, then she tells us she's charging us for both meals or she's kicking us out! (Even though we didn't touch the order she ruined) We had to talk to the manager to get our money back because the waitress refused to acknowledge she ruined our order. Please don't do here if you ever want to have a good time, the waitress tried to kick us out of outdoor seating just because she was annoyed that she ruined our order!
2020-08-05,5,Superrrrrrrre cute place to go with anyone! I got the Penne Vodka and it was to die for!!! The only dessert they have is a brownie with vanilla ice cream and raspberry spreading and sis... DELICIOUS!!! Really kind customer service :)
2020-07-04,4,This review will be short and sweet I didnt order food but I don't order drinks and a apertizer.i had spinach dip which was tastey it wasnt the best but it was decent .the waitress was very pleasant and professional and the drinks weren't too pricey. A pitcher of sangria was 25.00 which wasnt bad at all and the sangria was actually good and gave me a buzz .I will definately be going back so I cld try out the food next time. Also it wasnt bad tht it was only 40  outside of ny that's a major plus.
2020-06-29,4,They have one of the best HAPPY HOUR deals in Hoboken. Their martinis, margaritas, and sangria are the best cocktails to get! Sangria used to be 10 dollars on sunday but now it's 15 dollars on the weekend FYI. It has solid nachos and brunch menu (I like their eggs and home fries). They always give my little doggie some cold water so my dog always pulls me in that direction. I like them a lot!
2020-05-29,3,I wanted to love this place but unfortunately did not have a good experience. I would be tempted to try it again though just to see if it was a one time thing or a recurring issue . It started off with the hostess shoving 4 of us at a 2 person table in the corner. I know they were busy but we would have waited. It was past uncomfortable.We started with mimosas (duh since we went for brunch ;) ). I got the sunrise-mosa, mimosa punch, and blueberry lemonade squeeze. All were delicious and I didn't think $15 for a flight of 3 was terrible. These mimosas are really the only reason I gave this place 3 stars. I try not to eat cheese and specifically requested that I do not have cheese on my omelette. The waitress brings it out and what is all over it... cheese. We had waited so long for our food that at this point I was starving and had 3 drinks in me that I needed the food and wasn't going to wait even longer. However really disappointing. She did not even seem apologetic and was honestly kind of rude about it. The omelette was $11 which I think is fair (and for sure cheaper than most places in the city). It was an average omelette though nothing over the top. The breakfast potatoes were tasty though.Plenty of options on the menu for satisfy everyone's needs
2020-02-13,4,This was a spur of the momennt find. Yes it is a dive bar, but sometimes they are fun and have great food. We ordered the nachos, appetizer platter and steak sandwich. Patty was our bar tender and she made the Best! The food was really good but the Mojito was delicious! I recommend this place. Look past the  dive bar and have patty make you a delicious Mojito.
2020-02-09,4,Visited 02/09/2020We really like this place. A couple of minor issues perhaps, but I'd have no problem coming back again. I had their Huevos Rancheros (tortillas topped with 2 fried eggs, black beans and Monterey Jack cheese, guacamole and ranchero sauce)  Pretty tasty with the eggs served the perfect amount of "runny.".. which I like. I also had their Colossal shrimp corn chowder. Taste wise, this is a very good soup, although the word colossal is a bit misleading. I was expecting large shrimp hanging over the bowl, but apparently they were all chopped up in the soup and then... not a 'ton' of them in the soup either. So, a little disappointed with this, but it was very tasty. My wife had a blue cheese burger with fries, which she enjoyed. (Fried too!)  As explained to me, she gave the burger a 9 out of 10... done medium rare just the way she likes it. It seems the others with us enjoyed their meals too... filet mignon sandwiches and a quesadilla. Empty plates tell the story. Service was very good... my wife talked a bit with a very friendly manager  who seemed to be friendly and accommodating with everyone all day. Oh! The full bar offers up an excellent bloody mary and and array of different  mimosas as well as a nice selection of beers and other libations. Hope we get together with family again in Hobo soon.
2020-02-07,5,Jess, she is only here Tuesday mornings and Friday nights but she is worth canceling all your plans at the "spots" in Hoboken to see her! Jess pours a great drink, has great conversation and makes you want to stay like family!
2020-02-01,5,We started to have a really terrible experience. The details are unimportant. There are speed bumps in the restaurant industry. It's how a restaurant overcomes(or doesn't) that will make your experience good, bad, or excellent. The manager, Joy, was amazing and made our experience excellent. We will be back because of her.
2020-01-30,5,Love this place! Half off whole menu (food and drinks) on Mondays...can't beat that! Lots of other great specials and deals throughout the week
2020-01-10,5,Came here with a group of friends on January 5, 2020 for football Sunday. We arrived at Mikie Squared approximately 12:45pm on this Sunday afternoon and immediately we seated. The waiter offered a drink special to us, half price pitchers of Sangria so of course we ordered one red and one white. For lunch I ordered AJ'S SWEET & SPICY CHICKEN SANDWICHwhich included Cajun Chicken, Applewood smoked bacon, mushrooms, Monterey Jack Cheddar, lettuce, tomato & homemade honey mustard with a side of French Fries. The huge piece of chicken breast was seasoned to perfection and was not too spicy, which I loved. The fries were perfectly crispy as well. This meal made me wanting more when I finished! The atmosphere of this establishment definitely has a 'sports bar' feel to it. The people working there were all friendly and awesome! I can't wait to come back when there's warm weather to enjoy their outdoor seating area.
2019-12-28,3,First time dining at Mikie's the service was good but the wait for an omelette and salad was lengthy. But I have to say it was the best omelette I've had in a very long time. Kudos to Mikie!
2019-12-27,3,Although this dive bar/restaurant is right on Washington St, it feels like it's a bit off the beaten path due to minimal crowds. They have outdoor seating and a jukebox inside. The menu consists of average bar food. They offer 50% off their menu, for both food and drinks, on Monday evenings if you pay in cash. The staff is super friendly. I've tried the wings, Cindy is on a diet platter, mozzarella/tomato salad, wings and spinach artichoke dip. All average. I'll continue coming on Mondays for the half off deal.
2019-09-29,3,Buffalo chicken wrap was okay. Enjoyed the fries but nothing special. Seemed like a great local place but pretty small w a little bit of out door seating. Great bartender just nothing much that excited me about the place.
2019-09-23,5,Always a go to in Hoboken! The staff is amazing, the food is delicious and fresh, and sangria Sundays are a must! Great place to watch football games since they have plenty of tvs and seating. Aside from the sangria they also make a great manmosa, especially if Isaac is there. The food never disappoints either. Definitely recommend Mikie's if you're looking for a place with good food, drinks, and a nice atmosphere.
2019-09-08,5,There was a mix up with my order and on a busy football Sunday (first one to be exact) the manager, Allison, personally fixed my order and delivered it herself as she was getting off. Amazing and over the top customer service and good food too. Will continue to order from here.
2019-08-30,4,I have to say YES I am a fan.  LATE NIGHT kitchen is open and food was tasty.It's your average bar and grill with fun staff.  It's exactly what you want as a neighborhood no frill, just chill place.  Atmosphere and price spot on!
2019-07-17,5,Trivia night! Good food, great music and service. It was fun and inviting. Had stuffed burger, chipotle wings, and the Mac and cheese. Yum yum and more yum. For dessert had the brownie a la mode which was devoured.
2019-05-21,5,Ample outdoor patio seating and classic easy to please bar food. I'm into it! I was looking for a quick outdoor bite and drink in Hoboken. Outdoor seating on a gorgeous day can be hard to come by on Washington St, so I was super jazzed to find an available outdoor table. The patio is much larger than many of the other restaurants nearby. The menu has all of the bar food staples - wings, burgers, nachos, etc. I went with an order of chicken tenders. They were perfectly crispy and delicious, and an order was pretty large and came with six tenders. There are lots of different libations on the menu (even a mimosa flight) but I highly recommend the sangria. Pitchers are $25 and a single glass is $8. For $8 the single glass is enormous and easily equates to two drinks. On Sunday they also have a special $10 pitcher which is a pretty incredible deal. Service was quick and friendly. We were in and out in something like 45 minutes. That, along with no wait for an outdoor table is pretty unheard of on a summer Saturday in Hoboken. All that plus chicken fingers and sangria is an A+ in my book.
2019-05-19,1,Stopped in for an afternoon cocktail, server walked past us numerous times... they don't seem to care about their patrons time. Left after 30 minutes of being completely ignored and treated as an after thought.
2019-05-04,5,While walking along Washington Street in Hoboken,  I came across this spot.  Their signs and deals they were advertising (on their Mimosa flights and Sangria) caught my attention. So I went inside.  Right off the bat, I was impressed seeing over 10 different mimosa offerings. I ordered a flight of 4 different mimosas.   (Man-Mosa, Sunday Funday, Blueberry Lemonade,  and Pomegranate).  All 4 of these choices were delicious, but the blueberry lemonade was my favorite.  A great deal trying 4 mimosas for only $20.  For food, I ordered their filet mignon tips to start,  based on all the positive reviews.   I was so glad I ordered this, as it was excellent.  The beef was so tender, and the dipping sauce it came with paired perfectly.   These were so good I wanted another order lol. For main meal, I went with the buffalo chicken wrap with sweet potato fries.  Again, this was also amazing, and cooked perfectly. The buffalo chicken heat ratio was spot on.  Overall, I loved this place. I will be back again to try more of their menu items, as well as some more mimosa flights and their sangrita pitchers. Highly recommended everyone stop by here.
2019-03-26,4,Great neighborhood spot.  They have a nice beer selection, a full bar, a kitchen, plenty of TVs, and a friendly staff.The one time I came here, there were a bunch of regulars.  They were just as friendly as the staff and made the experience really welcoming.
2019-03-24,3,I haven't had the food here, however, it looks decent enough that I'd give it a try.I've been here for drinks twice. It's typically not too crowded so you can get a seat at the bar. I've been here on Monday nights, which I recommend as the entire bar is 50% off. That includes both food AND drinks. Literally everything. The only catch, you need to pay your bill in cash. That caught me a little off guard, but they do have an ATM in the back if you typically pay with credit card.
2019-03-22,1,Just received my second (and last ever order from this place); first time was average, this time was bad.Ordered plain tenders with crispy French fries and BBQ sauce and honey mustard for dipping.  Arrives on time 30 minutes later but spicy buffalo tenders with mushy, soggy fries (maybe due in time for delivery) and blue cheese.Immediately called to explain the issue and the individual started to ring up the order for me again and ready to charge me again for their mistake. There are plenty of better places to order than here. Sorry but you've lost my business for the issue with the order, and the inability to fix it.
2019-03-15,1,chili was watery and exactly like Wendys fast food chili except $5 more expensive.   Very disappointing.  Small portion too and Quesadillas smelled of plastic wrap, very strong.   I took a bite it had zero flavor.    Never going back sorry awful.
2019-02-18,1,This is probably the slowest place in Hoboken. The service was horrible and I would recommend not going. I ordered a cheese burger and it was basically a hockey puck. The woman who ended up being our server had to seat us. We then saw her one time and had to rely on bussers to help us. Terrible service.
2019-02-03,1,Staff is sweet, food is nasty ! Fries look like they where marinated in oil for 6 hours n then they served them to me. At least they comped our food.
2018-11-06,4,My boyfriend took me here last Sunday for brunch. We ordered mimosas--this place has so many flavors of mimosas to choose from; it even has flights!--along with our meals. Omelet for him, huevos rancheros for me. Service was quick, and decor was your average dark Hoboken bar. Mimosas were perfectly balanced. Not too much champagne or too much OJ; we only had one each, but if we weren't careful, we would've definitely had more! My boyfriend loved his omelet, while I found my huevos rancheros tasty and spicy. Our breakfast both came with potatoes and toast. Toast was crispy, but required butter, while the potatoes were addictive. Needless to say, the boyfriend and I cleaned our plates.Overall would come back here for a cheap, quick, boozy brunch!
2018-09-20,4,Stopped by for Happy Hour and decided to make it a Margarita and Wings kind of night. I favor their frozen margaritas over on the rocks.  There are a few sauce options for wings....the one option that immediately stood out was the "Award Winning Honey Chipotle" wings.  With a claim like that how can you not give it a try? They lived up to the name. I loved the sweet savory spice combinations. Well balanced flavor not overpoweringly sweet nor spicy, just a perfectly subtle combination of flavors. I devoured my order of 6 wings. I will definitely go back just for those.
2018-08-18,2,Poor service.  Bartenders are too busy hanging with their friends than dealing with paying customers
2018-08-16,4,This place is great , we work across the street from it and once in a while we go there for a few drinks .. the bartenders are always so awesome and the drinks are really good . However we were there last night to celebrate a friend's birthday and they had a DJ . That was the rudest person I ever met , I asked him to shout a happy birthday to my friend and he completely ignored me and no he did NOT wish her a happy birthday so maybe they should get a more friendly DJ .
2018-08-03,1,Unfortunately, 'zero' is not an option. Ive eaten here several times and overall the experience has been good and the food 'good' by bar food standards.However, sometimes you have an experience at a place that trumps everything else. Well, tonight was one of those times. I worked in food service for many years and 'things happen' and that's part of it. It's how you handle it that matters.The staff at Mikie Squared obviously does not get it. Will not return
2018-08-01,1,I have no idea if this place is good or not.  Stopped in for lunch on a weekday. Only one other patron there. The bartender was stocking the fridge, there was a waitress flipping on her phone at the end of the bar.  I sat there for about five minutes.  Finally he waitress looked up at me. She just kind of stared at me for a minute - didn't say anything. No "can I help you" or "just one second". Just stared. So I just got up and left.
2018-07-10,1,I'm feeling very mad at this place, because it was worse time that I've ever had, people were so racist and very rude, I definitely won't come back to this place
2018-07-10,1,This place was awful, I went with my cousins to have nice time, and they were very racist, totally in an awful attitude, saying horrible jokes, a really bad energy.
2018-07-09,5,Was walking around Hoboken looking for a place to have lunch and picked this spot because their menu looked interesting from outside. The food was great. I got the sweet and spicy chicken sandwich with fries. No complaints. Good portion for the price. (I didn't make sure but I believe sweet potato fries as a side don't cost extra) The place was empty, so maybe it isn't a good judgement but I got great attention and service from Eric, our server/bartender. Super friendly and a cool spot. I will definitely head back to try their maple wings and for trivia night on Wednesdays!
2018-06-23,3,My fries were burnt. At first I thought they were sweet potato, but I didn't order that. I tried my best not to care and ate some, but yeah they were very burnt.Wrap was good though and the delivery didn't take too long.
2018-06-03,5,I love this place (it definitely helps that I live one block away). It's kinda small but it makes up for it by being awesome. There's always a fun drink deal going on--my favorites are the Sunday sangria special and the Thursday martini special--and I love the Alyssa's everyday wrap. They have TVs for watching sports or you can sit outside in nice weather. This is one of my favorite day drinking spots!
2018-05-23,5,Best food, best service, and best drink specials.. I just really love Mikie Squared! It's like my second home! Even their food delivery is fast and yummy!
2018-05-21,5,I had such a good brunch at Mikie Squared. It is very easy to get to on Washington St. The staff was welcoming and friendly. I was impressed with the large selection of mimosas to pick for the brunch mimosa flight. I would highly recommend the avocado toast and french toast entrees though everything else looked good too!
2018-05-19,1,The worst!!! This place is awful!!! Never order from here! They hire the most incompetent people! Food is old...
2018-05-06,1,I am writing this review as I sit here baffled on how a restaurant can be so absurd. We were the only table outside at first and it took 25 minutes for our nachos to come out which were mediocre at best, I ordered avocado toast - on the menu it said poached eggs, what I received was over cooked over easy eggs with guacamole on toast. I then sent it back and just ordered regular toast and it took 20 minutes for my toast with butter to come out. It must have been a magical toaster because I dont understand how it came out in 20 minutes. My toast was hard as a rock I tossed it on the plate and you could hear it . I do not recommend this place. There are much better options !
2018-05-04,4,What's up Hoboken! Last time I was here, tried the nachos and got lucky with two bar seats. The place is chill, bartenders are always friendly and the owner scopes making sure the T's are crossed ad the I's are dotted. They have outside tables where you can sit and enjoy the weather but I like the inside to relax, get a couple of brewskis and chill out after a long day. Its a cool, casual spot to drop in.
2018-03-25,5,Went with my friends on a snow day and the service was incredible (even short handed) Luis was great and made sure that we got everything on time. Not to mention- the food was GREAT!
2018-02-26,4,Not a bad spot in hoboken and a nice location. They run some good deals and the food actually is pretty good. The chips and dip were a lot better than anticipated.
2018-02-11,3,If you're looking for a fun-filled, low-key, non-pretentious kind of night, then Mikie Squared ain't a bad place to go. I gotta give a shout out to the staff. They may get busy, but they are very friendly and as attentive as can be when it starts to get packed. The food is OK. Typical bar food at Hoboken prices. My burger was meaty and juicy but the bun was too big and dry. Fries are good, both the regular and sweet potato variety. If you come on a Wednesday night around 8:30, you can expect a full house as this is their trivia night. Their first prize is a gift certificate and bottle of wine which is nice. They also have some free SWAG for the second and third place winners. Although they do offer select half priced wine bottles and glasses, you're only cheap option for beer is $4 Blue Moon Pints. Of course, you have the option of splurging for a $7 Fat Tire, but it's not worth it in my personal experience. I'd love it if they got some more craft beer and had some better beer specials...
2018-02-08,4,Happy Thirsty Thursday my fellow Adventurers! Came here this past Sunday Funday for both the Super Bowl Specials but also for my birthday. Low key dive bar but they have an awesome Sangria special--$10 per pitcher (red or white). AMAZING! Had a pitch I split with friend and it wasn't too bad, not as strong as say a Portuguese place would have but still tasty and alcoholic. The appetizer sampler is really good too! We had an order of two for 4 people which was more than plenty of food, though we may add an order for the chicken quesadillas to fill us up.The food was typical bar food but still tasted really delicious. Wings weren't too well done but still crispy and meaty. I love wings with the bone not those gourmet chicken nuggets that are called boneless wings. The onion rings and mozzarella sticks were my absolute favorite! I will definitely be coming back here on another Sunday Funday for the Sangria special and order a few different appetizers to munch on. The staff was really attentive and quick with the orders. The space wasn't too crowded even on Super Bowl Sunday which is hard to find in Hoboken.
2018-01-11,5,Amazing food with quick and friendly service. Was there on a Wednesday for half off wine and trivia and it was a great time with a good crowd. Will definitely be back.
2018-01-01,2,I guess this is the first time I give 2 stars ranking. The only good thing at that restaurant was the service. Food was terrible. I ordered a grilled vegetable salad, couldn't imagine how greasey it was. And I was REALLY superised tomatoes tasted different from onions. Martini was awful. The olives must be there for an hoir before it was brought to me.
2017-12-01,2,I came to this bar specifically for their 1/2 price food and drinks on Monday nights. I've had their Maple Chipotle wings before and really enjoyed them, so I thought this would be a great deal for dinner. At the end of the meal, our server told us that the half price only applies if you pay cash only. I double checked their social media (which is how I found out about the deal), their sign out front, and their website. Not one of these sources say anything about cash only on Monday nights. I was really disappointed, since this was the reason we came here for dinner. Luckily, my fiancé had enough cash, but I don't carry too much cash on a regular basis, if it weren't for my fiancé we would've had to pay full price. I don't appreciate this. The owners should make "cash only" clear on every source of advertising this deal, otherwise, it's deceiving in my opinion. As far as the food, we decided to go with just appetizers. I had the maple chipotle wings and French onion soup and my fiancé had a chicken quesadilla. The food was just ok. Maybe because I'm a picky eater, but the French onion soup tasted like store bought beef broth heated up in a microwave. I tried the chicken quesadilla and was not a fan either, the salsa looked like it came from a jar. I did have a glass of their white sangria and really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be coming back based on my experience.
2017-11-18,3,Have gone to Mikie Squared a good handful of times during my years in Hoboken.  Food is pretty good.  I usually go for the Buffalo Chicken wrap which I enjoy.  Most of the items are reasonably priced, few items are a couple dollars more then they should be but what are you going to do, it's Hoboken.  The one big thing Mikie's has going for it is the $10 pitchers of sangria on Sunday and the tables to sit outside and eat during the Spring/Summer.  Red sangria is pretty tasty.This review would have been 4 stars but I did have one terrible experience with a very rude waiter about six months ago.  The waiter was rushing our group and how he spoke to our table was not how a restaurant should ever speak to their customers.  Ironically we had this same waiter again at Charrito's Midtown and Charrito's in Hoboken has the worst customer service.  Have not seen this waiter again at Mikie Squared since.  All in all Mikie Squared is a solid place to go for food and drink in Hoboken and I would recommend going for Sunday sangria or a quick bite.
2017-10-11,5,I give 5 stars to Danny, he was very nice when I placed my order for pick-up today. Not like the lady that took my order 2 weeks ago, she had a nasty attitude, didn't want to explain to me what the salad included, kept on breathing on the phone, she was either having a bad day, or her attitude just stinks. But my 5 STARS goes to the guy today. Thanks for being polite & explaining the appetizer today. The food was great!!!!! :) They should hire more people like you!
2017-09-30,4,Always very satisfied with my experience here. Food is good. Service is ok. Nice outdoor seating. Love going on Mondays when everything is half price!!
2017-09-16,5,Sunday's are $10 sangria pitchers. Their sangria is phenomenal, and I've seen them make it - far from skimpy on the booze. I've really only had apps here so cannot comment too much on the food but the Montana De Nachos are great and so are the Filet Mignon Tips. The staff is friendly and they like to have a good time, creating a fun environment. Definitely recommend this place, especially on Sundays.
2017-08-14,2,1/2 priced Mondays.   The bartenders need to be schooled in customer service.  I've been going here for years, and this staff is godawful.   Today the bartender was too interested in talking to her friends than getting us more water, clean silverware, a second drink or our tab.  They need to turn around and LOOK at their customers on occasion.
2017-08-05,5,I went there on Wednesday for lunch. First time going there and the service was great. The food was delicious. The free appetizer on a Wednesday was more than what I expected. Overall experience was amazing. Great service!
2017-07-12,3,**Monday: 1/2 off menu review**Mikie Squared is one of those bar places where you just want to grab a few drinks while having some okay bar food. So that's what my boyfriend and I decided to do on a Monday night at around 8. It was really their half price menu that got us: on Monday's it's 50% off all food and drinks. However, what they don't mention until you pay is that the 50% off only applies if it's cash only. We only got the head's up when we overheard another table. Luckily, we had enough cash on us. But still, that's pretty shady IMO - to not tell the customer that the deal is cash only, until they get the bill.Other than that, everything else was okay. Like I said, it's okay bar food. Don't expect an out of this world gastronomic experience. Do expect a cheap meal (if you come on a Monday night). I had the AJ's Sweet and Spicy Chicken Sandwich (Cajun chicken, applewood smoked bacon, mushrooms, Monterey Jack cheddar, lettuce, tomato and homemade honey mustard) and I enjoyed it.I think I would be back, especially if it's a lazy Monday and I don't want to cook. Plus they have drink specials every night (including Fridays and Saturdays!)
2017-06-20,4,This bar was your average place to go to grab a drink & have a good time. I was a bit confused as to why the bartender did not know what a "Dirty Shirley" was but maybe some places don't make them even though I thought it was a known drink. She did make an awesome Malibu Bay Breeze though! It was very packed inside and she did her best keeping up with everyone considering you had all these people screaming for her left and right. She was kind & sociable which always makes me happy because I can't stand having a person serving/waiting on me who is rude or too quiet.Overall, good bar...convenient and somewhere to try if all the other places are mobbed.
2017-05-28,4,Great spot on Washington ave, Hoboken. They always have $10 Sangria pitchers. It's good for breakfast or lunch.
2017-05-18,4,Sunday Sangria - $10 pitcher all day special review! The sangria isn't terribly strong but seriously for a all day Sunday special this is not bad! The food is decent - regular bar food. We ordered the appetizer sampler and the nachos with steak (always medium rare) and it was good. Will definitely return for the Sunday specials and a fun time. Bartenders and servers are really nice and music is good.
2017-05-08,1,For a Resturant that seems to make so many Hoboken "top 10 brunches " it was very disappointing! The service was terrible and that would not be so bad if the food was great.  Unfortunately it was not.  There are literally dozens of better choices in Hoboken.  Unless you are looking for a deal on sangria ( that seems to be watered down ) I would look at the dozens of other brunch spots in Hoboken.
2017-04-28,4,It was a really nice day and wanted to sit outside for brunch.We live around the corner and got a table right away - I think we came just in time as the outdoor space filled up QUICK!They have Sangria Sundays, I think it's $10/pitcher - AWESOME!I ordered their breakfast burrito and it was very satisfying.My friend enjoyed her bloody mary, except it wasn't spicy enough.Will definitely come back soon!
2017-04-24,4,Mikie Squared is an excellent place to enjoy a casual dining experience or night out with friends.  I've been here many times during my 9 years in Hoboken (oh my I'm getting old...).  Drinks are reasonably priced and the food is excellent.  My favorite meal is actually the grilled chicken salad.  The best part about Mikie Squared is actually the service!  The hostess, wait staff and bartenders are always incredibly friendly and welcoming.  They've accommodated private parties for me in the past, even offering special prices to be a part of a bar crawl that I organized.  If there is one knock on this place, it's their prices.  They revamped their menu a few years ago and the prices are a little high.  There are other similar, great places in Hoboken offering the same for less.  That being said, the prices won't keep me away.
2017-04-11,4,I live on Washington St. so I come here for brunch usually.  I only get one thing and it's the Breakfast Nachos.They are probably for two or more people but I down it myself and always feel satisfied afterwards.  Service is always good, and during the warmer seasons it's really nice to sit outside to be away from the rowdy crowd during game days.I've seen that they also have some game nights, which look really fun.
2017-04-06,5,Mikie Squared is definitely my favorite brunch spot in Hoboken. Sangria pitchers for $10?! Yes please. I especially love that you can order brunch or lunch so you're not forced to just one kind of food. The Delectable French Toast is my new favorite go-to!
2017-04-02,3,Very nice place to sit down with friends, grab a beer and a sandwich, burger and catch up mid week. I thought the food took a very long time to be served. It was a little crowded. Overall it was an okay place.
2017-03-18,4,Service is of typical NY/NJ . Waiting long than usual for a server who kinda hates his job. But it's tolerable because the food is AMAZING. Great prices! They have this cute little mimosa menu with all different typeS of specialty mimosas. Each was $7 and if you get the try 3 there each $5. Really delicious. Then the menu is to die for. Between me and my two friends we order almost every item off the appetizers menu and everything taste 5 star. Best sweet potato fries hands down. MUST TRY: filet mignon tips & sweet potato fries
2017-02-26,5,First off they open at 10 am  on Saturday and Sunday. Yelp has it wrong. Secondly the service is fantastic and the food is good! Go!
2017-02-23,5,Love this place! I always come here when I'm looking for quality bar food (they have so many wraps and sammys). The staff is always sooo nice and talkative. They'll suggest food choices or specials to you and will change the tv channels to a game if you need. Used to live right nearby, but now I'm downtown and I still make the walk here when I want great food, good beer & friendly, calm crowd.
2017-01-15,5,Great food! We came with 8 people and the service was pretty quick. Sangria is a must!
2016-12-27,4,Mikie's never comes to mind as a strong brunch contender but we stopped here on a whim on a Sunday morning. It was pretty empty; my boyfriend and I sat at the bar and we were the only ones there. Service was quick, friendly and the bloody mary was delish.The food was also surprisingly good! I've been here for lunch before and haven't been impressed, so it looks like brunch is the way to go. The eggs benedict had the perfect amount of hollandaise and the eggs were poached just right. We also shared a waffle and it was tasty. Everything is reasonably priced. Will be back for brunch :)
2016-11-28,4,Isaac is a great bartender. Lots of college kids past 9 on fridays and saturdays. And even earlier on sundays for sangria! food is bangin too
2016-10-21,5,This place is so amazing. Ive come here for Sangria Sunday's a few times and Ive always been satisfied! I even asked to have a birthday here and even though they don't take reservations they worked with me to accommodate my large party and even set us up with a ton of drink and food specials! They made everything amazing and they were so friendly and sweet : )
2016-08-16,1,I strongly suspect I got food poisoning from the cod tacos. Aside from that, the wait staff was awesome.
2016-06-15,5,Great prices, great atmosphere, hospitable bartenders!! They will make you want to be come a regular! Mix crowd, usually from ages 21-35! Love this place!
2016-05-27,1,1 Star is too many. I stopped in here today for their fish taco special that looked like a decent price. There were a good amount of customers outside so I figured the food must be good. I walked by some service staff as I came in and sat at the bar. They saw me but didn't acknowledge me. There was no bar tender behind the bar so I waited. I waited a good ten minutes before I left. Kind of ridiculous.
2016-05-22,5,Had the opportunity to try this spot in hoboken last week. I must admit I was extremely surprised at the amazing ambience. Isaac and Joe and the rest of the staff were extremely friendly. Isaac is an amazing bartender and manages the place with great ease. He really knows how to treat all customers like a family. He is a great asset to this wonderful place. Lastly, I must say that the food is amazing the Filet Mignon tips are finger licking good..highly recommend it for all.
2016-05-20,5,My boyfriend and I came to Mikie Squared for two reasons: one, because on Thursdays, martinis are half priced and two, because my boyfriend's roommate works there now. That being said, Mikie Squared did not disappoint, and I will certainly be back, especially for their Wednesday trivia night.Though it was martini mania, my boyfriend and I got a strawberry margarita and a Blue Moon as our first drinks (Blue Moon was also on sale and my boyfriend is a big beer drinker). My strawberry marg wasn't too sweet or overflowing with alcohol -- perfect for a Thursday night meal. Later, my boyfriend ordered the mango martini (don't judge him) and it was definitely mango-y, but in a good way. Being the girl I am, I enjoyed the fruity taste that masked the overwhelming taste of alcohol. Instead of ordering two entrees, my boyfriend and I decided to split three appetizers -- the buffalo calamari, the tomato and mozzarella salad and the spinach and artichoke dip. Let me just say now that each of these appetizers was incredible. The mozzarella at Mikie Squared is homemade, and you can taste the effort put into making it. The buffalo calamari is also a unique spin on regular fried calamari; combined with the creamy dipping sauce they provide, this was by far one of the best appetizers I've ever had -- especially since as a pescetarian, I never get to eat buffalo wings and this is a great substitute. The best part about our experience was that the staff was friendly (especially since we knew some of them) and I always felt like we were being paid attention to -- our water cups NEVER went dry. When the bill came out, I was surprised that three drinks and three appetizers came out to under $50, but in a good way. I love Mikie Squared and I can't wait to go back.
2016-05-10,5,Solid brunch spot with good drinks.  Get the breakfast burrito and a man-mosa (blue moon beer, champagne, shot of stole orange vodka)
2016-05-06,4,Quality of food tends to change day to day, but if you go on a good day it's amazing. Also this place usually has good specials.
2016-03-17,4,I've been in here twice now, both on Wednesdays. The food is good, especially for a place that looks like a bar (loud music, lots of TV's).  The first time I had the "Cindy's always on a diet" and I really enjoyed it. The honey balsamic side it comes with isn't my jam, but it's ok because you don't need it, the chicken is moist and the veggies are well seasoned. Maybe not worth $13-14, but coupled with cheap wine, it made a decently priced meal. Last night I had the special, which was a corned beef sandwich. I'm no corned beef connoisseur (mainly because it's usually on a reuben with two of the grossest things someone can put on a sandwich- swiss cheese and sauerkraut), but I really enjoyed it. It came with chipolte mayo, which was kind of a weird addition but seriously amazing. Like, I could put that on anything. Even the cole slaw was worth eating by itself. I like that there was no upcharge for getting a side salad instead of fries. Salad itself is just mixed greens and two tomato slices, but it was fresh and well dressed. They have half priced wines on Wednesday, which is always welcome. They also have trivia...I didn't play either night but the questions weren't ridiculously hard and it's well paced. Teddy the bartender took care of me, but all the staff I interacted with were friendly. I'll definitely be back!
2016-02-26,5,Beautiful place. And sitting watching all the food coming out is amazing ...everything look so good.
2016-02-20,5,This is a weekly Sunday spot I go to with bae and drink tons and tons of Sangria. They have great deals on Sundays which includes $10 pitchers of Sangria. I especially like going there when our favorite bar tender Isaac is there. He always makes our time spent there wonderful. The food is great as well, we highly recommend the Buffalo Chicken Wrap and the house wings. Good deals.
2016-02-05,1,Our waitress was serving our table at 4pm on New Years day in her New Years Eve dress and heels. She received reeboks 1/2 way through. We were a table of ten. She was 0/10 on correct orders. Our entire check was comped.
2016-01-29,4,I like this place, fun place to go for some beers and burgers. Quesadillas are amazing, i love the shrimp one. Mimosas are tasty too!
2016-01-04,4,I've always liked Mikie Squared, and have a special appreciation for it's small town bar atmosphere.  It's different than most of the bars in Hoboken, and has a way of keeping friendly clientele absent of roid rages after a couple of beers.  The staff is the likely reason; they are always smiling.  Our waiter tonight was no exception to my previous experiences, and despite coming in for a few drinks, he was awesome and made us feel right at home.  He made the suggestions of a chocolate peanut butter shots to my wife, and she loved them.  I appreciated the selection of beers and loathed my punkin ale that tasted like pumkin.  This is always a spot on bar to go to.
2016-01-03,3,Had problems with the online ordering. Staff was very helpful on the phone. When our food finally came however it was not very good. I am not updating the review because after this was posted the restaurant ended up calling and refunding me. We will definitely visit the restaurant in person because I am sure it will be a great place to visit.
2015-12-13,5,Great service!! Food was amazing!!! Very professional staff and management! :) my friends and I came here on sangria Sunday. We enjoyed brunch and pitchers of sangria for a great price!
2015-12-13,4,Absolutely love the food and the bartenders. They were extremely accomodating with putting on our football team on sunday. Had the steak and eggs for brunch that was cooked to perfection! However... The one bad thing was the waitress Gabrielle... She was extremely rude for no reason and clearly played favorites with her customers. She was not welcoming at all and the entire time the vibe was that she really didnt want to be there. She is single handedly the worst waitress ive ever had and mikies is so delicious it really is a shame that she is kept around there because she brings the whole establishment down. Gabrielle should do everyone a favor and never work with people again because she is an embarassment to herself and whatever restaurant she works at.
2015-12-11,5,First time here. Awesome experience, Great service, food and drink top notch. Scott and Juan are the best. They will treat you like gold. Will most definitely be back.
2015-10-30,4,We like this place.  To be honest, I liked it better as Rogo's way back when, but it is still a solid place.  The waiters and bartenders and even bouncers are nice and friendly and attentive, it has decent chairs and booths that are comfortable to hang out in and watch the game, and the food is actually really good.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the prices are really high.  A sandwich wrap with fries can set you back like $14, which is kind of steep compared to other places and other bars/grills in Hoboken.  So look for their specials and happy hours, and save a buck.  Decent brunch too.  They are also usually really cold inside, regardless of the season, so be prepared. Our favorites are: Chicken Quesadilla, Alyssa's Everyday Chicken Wrap, and Onion Rings (super crispy, greasy, and delicious)...and Yuengling :)The Stevens college crew used to dominate this place, but now it is much more hipster/yuppie Hoboken types, which is actually better (weird to say). Service is fast and attentive, they bring you water right away without having to ask which is nice, and don't mind filling it up versus other places that expect you to only drink alcohol the whole time.  If you stay hydrated with water, you actually drink and spend more, so good job Mikie Squared!I will continue to be a regular here.
2015-10-14,5,Wah I wish this place got better reviews. I'm pulling for you, Mikie's! I often order takeout for lunch, but I've been here multiple times for brunch, dinner, and a drink when I felt it necessary to sit at a bar by myself and sulk. Food's been good every time I came. On some occasions it has been great. One of the guys behind the bar (I wish I remembered his name) makes a mean mojito. The mimosas are so good...try the Manmosa! We stole that one and made it a signature drink at our wedding. Cozy place. I love the decor, great atmosphere. Sometimes it smells like a watering hole but hey, shit happens. I bring everyone here...family, friends. 5 stars.
2015-10-11,2,So disappointing... Went for Sunday brunch based on yelp recommendation...once seated waited at least 20 min for a Bloody Mary. .. The wait continued for utensils,food ,check..so many other choices in Hoboken ...why go back?
2015-09-04,5,Looks can be deceiving....you may think this place is going to be a typical run of the mill bar/restaurant....but it's not.  We were visiting Hoboken & New York for a week and this was the ONLY place we ate at 2x's.  We had breakfast & lunch & both were great.  The menu had the typical things but with a Mikie's twist.  Everything was better...it's not just a regular burger, or a normal appetizer, there was always something a bit better and different which made the food stand out.  Now let's talk about the staff...they were awesome.  The Manager came out to introduce herself ask some questions about us, provided some tips regarding NYC & the subway.  The waiters were sweet and helpful and appeared to really enjoy working there.  The day we were leaving we stopped here for lunch because we were heading to NYC to drop my 16 year old son off at the JFK Hilton Hotel to join the rest of the AFS-USA foreign exchange students going to Europe.  The waiter of course was awesome and was asking about us & we told him our plans.  At the end of the meal when the check came we noticed the 2 beers were not on the ticket and when my husband inquired the Waiter stated "It's on me....good luck with your son and I wish you all safe travels".....WHO DOES THIS?  It was such a 'pay it forward' thing to do that of course we did just that...we handed out our 5 subway unlimited passes (which still had 2 days left) to strangers and they lit up with smiles and thank you's.  Mikie's not  only will provide a wonderful dining experience, the staff will make you feel like you are the only one's there.  I recommend this place to everyone!!!
2015-08-06,4,We stopped in for lunch and had an enjoyable meal.Décor: It's a bar, there's not much more to it than that. However, they have a handful of tables inside and outside and even have a large window that they open on nice days (so you can sit inside be feel like you're outside). Overall, it's pretty dark inside but that just makes it easier to see the bunch of TVs they have that are showing any kind of sporting event on at the time. The actual bar itself is pretty sizable and runs the length of the front room.Bathroom: unknownStaff: Our waitress was nice and kept our water glasses full almost the entire time.Food: We just had lunch, so no drinks. But many others were boozing away during Sunday brunch. We started with the Lobster and Corn Chowder (yum!) and then had a salad and wings. Everything was very tasty, the only thing is that I wish the wings were a bit hotter (temperature wise).Value: The prices are right about what we expected.This is a solid place that I'd come back to again for drinks or some more food (their menu looks pretty solid).
2015-08-05,5,One of my favorite "squares" in Hoboken! I have to confess that the regular food is not the best, except for the calamaris, which is to die for, but the drinks and the service is outstanding. We love to go there weekends morning for brunch (really good), and have amazing Bloody Mary's and Mimosas. Sangria is also a highlight here! Joy and Maria from the staff are simply adorable and they just make you want to stay there, chatting and having a great time! Definitely recommend this bar for a great time in Hoboken!
2015-07-26,4,At first sight this place looks like your regular run of the mill tavern/pub, but having been there for Sunday brunch I have a difference in option. First they have $10 pitcher of sangria (several flavors for different prices). The menu was very diverse. I had the huevos rancheros. It was visually beautiful in presentation and equally as delicious. My friend had the bambino omelette. The way the food is presented opens your appetite. The French toast with fresh fruit was my favorite. Everything also taste very great. The servers were quick and eager to help. Overall, this was a great place and I will go again.
2015-07-24,4,Visit this spot quite frequently... Great sandwich wraps and wide variety of drinks/beers you can choose from. Simple and reliable, its my local staple.
2015-07-04,5,Great time last night. Esp Michael, Ted, and Kate. We had a blast!! Keep up the great work guys.
2015-06-30,4,Stopped in here for a quick lunch my first day visiting NJ/NY... The guy we were there with lives in Hoboken, and he was showing us around just walking along when we came to Mikie's... He has been before, and liked it, so we went to grab a bite.Such a cute little place! We had a really sweet waitress, and the burger i got was to DIE FOR!! Fresh tasting, and the drink list was pretty good as well.I also liked the pictures on the wall of all the people that have worked there over the years.All in all... I would go back on my next visit
2015-06-26,5,Stop it....I'm not kidding. Stop it. I'm furious that I'm *still* searching for a burger better than Mikie Squared's! Juicy, hand-formed, layered with a generous amount of cheese on a fresh bun brings tears to my eyes. Now be a good boy or girl, and bring me one of these burgers. Now.
2015-06-24,3,I recall this place being cheap but Jesus H. Christ don't order the Martini's here. You are asking for a trip to vomit city the next morning. They have a cool touch screen juke box which you can use to your advantage to liven up the joint (hint: this place isn't all that interesting.)
2015-06-21,1,I have never written a review before but I found it necessary after experiencing such rude "customer service" from the owner. My friends and I will never return and told all of our friends about our horrible experience. We ordered lemon chicken and it tasted like rubber so we politely asked to order something else. Some man walked over to the table and said "hey so what was wrong" and we responded "the consistency of the chicken did not taste right... It tasted like rubber" and he responds "that's it...?" And walks away. I have never experienced such rude customer service in all of my years of eating out. Hoboken is a small town and they need to learn hospitality because they just earned themselves a very bad reputation.
2015-06-17,4,I like the relaxed ambiance here and the food is generally pretty good. Service is hit or miss -- I've had great servers sometimes and other times had no water for most of my meal, had appetizers come out after entrees (what?) and warmish beer. Probably just the luck of the draw but worth a shot!
2015-06-13,1,Mickie's (the manager, as I was told) is an absolute prick. The definition of unprofessional and also possible winner of the likely-to-be-punched-in-the-face-for-just-existing award. Treats his bartenders like trash and speaks like a twelve year old angry boy.  Bad look on the business.
2015-05-23,3,Good service, good food but nothing out of the ordinary. It's a nice place to chill with friends if you want a good burger and beer but I wouldn't go out of my way.
2015-05-16,4,It was a nice Sunday out and I stopped here on a late morning. I was trying to catch the Arsenal v Chelsea game but didn't want to get caught up in the usually crowded brunch scene of Hoboken. While the outdoor seating at Mikie's was full, the bar was open so I grabbed a seat. The servers and bartenders were extremely nice and attentive. I opted to got for the $10 sangria pitcher deal since my friend was planning on meeting me at halftime. The sangria was pretty darn good - there was a guy chopping fruit constantly for it literally there entire time I was there. I really liked the laid back atmosphere and upbeat vibe. There were tvs it you wanted to watch spots but it wasn't overwhelming. I didn't eat there but the food looked delicious and with very good portions. I'll definitely be back.
2015-05-05,5,I love Mikie Squared. Everything about this place deserves five stars. The service is fantastic, the food is fantastic, the people are fantastic. A must-go to in Hoboken. Trust me.
2015-04-22,4,Sangria Sundays are the best - you can't really beat $10 sangria pitchers.Their brunch is really good - there are several options for breakfast and lunch type foods.  I usually go with the Mikie's omelet - spinach and mushrooms with cheddar cheese but I like to substitute goat cheese.  Although last time I tried this, they forgot and brought me cheddar. Still good, but not as good.Their "grilled vegetables" in the "Cindy is always on a diet" platter and the veggie wrap, and I'm sure anything with grilled veggies in it - don't really taste grilled - they taste more sauteed, but they do taste fresh at least.I didn't love the turkey burger, I thought it was a little lacking in flavor and overcooked.The buffalo calamari is fantastic! Their buffalo sauce in general is one of my favorites.The filet mignon wrap with fresh mozzarella is always delicious.The shrimp and corn chowder is probably one of my favorite things in any restaurant in all of Hoboken. It's a creamy pink bisque with tons of shrimp flavor and a colossal shrimp garnish.
2015-04-22,5,Great sangria and apps! Trivia night is always fun and this place has touchtunes. Really fun for a girls night out
2015-03-13,1,I always seem to give businesses second chances even when they don't deserve it- and I've learned the hard way why you shouldn't through Mikie Squared.  The worst part is that I used to LOVE this place- but as I mentioned in my previous review, the prices have skyrocketed and it seems that the customer service has plummeted. Since I love their chicken caesar wrap so much, I randomly will still order from here during the lunch prices. Last week, I had a huge craving for this wrap and ordered on seamless.  The wait time was 45-60 minutes, totally understandable especially with the snow.  60 minutes passed by, an hour and a half, and at almost the two hour mark, I called to see what what going on.  The girl on the phone said she would check on my order and when she returned, she mentioned that her shift had just started and the girl before her "forgot to put in my order and it was never made", she said she could "rush" it and have it sent out immediately.  My initial thought was "for free..I hope" but I decided I didn't even want to deal with them and told her to cancel the order completely, making sure I would receive my full refund.  She felt bad but I feel as if I should have been offered a comped meal or at least some kind of compensation..TWO HOURS waiting!? There's clearly something missing and they need to figure their crap out if they're going to charge 16 dollars for a wrap.
2015-03-05,2,My friends and I have been going to mikie squared for years. Their food is AMAZING, we have gone multiple times in a single week in the past- that's how much we love it. Unfortunately my roommate and I just had an awful experience and will never return. We ordered chicken wraps that cost $8 and when it was delivered we were told that it's now $14 because they had a price increase 'due to inventory' $6 more for a chicken wrap at a bar in ABSURD. They also told us that at lunch time the wrap would be $8 but at dinner time it increases by $6 (almost 50%) for literally the exact same item, exact same portion size. So pricing is based on what time I order? I can go to the W hotel and get a burger for the same price.  Also another issue is that the prices are their old reasonable prices on their online menu, and when we called and complained they said that they didn't update their online menu prices. How is that our problem?
2015-02-02,5,This is our favorite brunch spot.  Good food, great drinks.  The "man" mosa is a must.  The french toast is a great choice if you have a sweet tooth.
2015-01-25,5,Came here for the 1st time for brunch...its amazing! French toast is thee best i ever had! Gabrielle our server was great as well. Very nice friendly and was on point with the menu and drinks. Definitely will be coming back...
2015-01-16,5,Great bar food.  Best sangria in town.  Perfect place to meet up with some friends before going out to get some food and drinks.  I have been here for brunch as well and it was delicious.  The french toast are amazing. Mikies prides itself on making fresh upscale bar food and you can tell.  I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Hoboken.Solid place
2015-01-15,5,Easily my favorite hole-in-the-wall bar in Hoboken. It's very low key, but gets a decent crowd. The bartenders are so cool and friendly. The food is actually really good, which you wouldn't expect from a small bar menu. Tuesday nights they have trivia with a $50 cash prize for first place. $25 for second place and $20 for third. Overall this is a great bar.
2015-01-04,4,Wings (world famous chipotle bbq) rockQuesadilla especial tastes like socksWill go solely for the wings.
2015-01-01,4,This place has great options for brunch. I started with a Bloody Mary which was perfection and my boyfriend and I shared two different wraps. I got a chicken wrap with some sort of amazing aioli sauce. So good! My boyfriends wrap had peppers, mozz, chicken, balsamic. I usually find this sort of wrap a little plain but the balsamic dressing is awesome! It was the same dressing that was on the side salad that came with the wrap. Fries are fresh cut.. Yum! Minus one star because service was just a little lacking. I will definitely go back!
2014-12-23,4,Tasty, above average bar food, friendly staff, GREAT wings, decent specials, and DRUNK college youths.  Take it for what it is, you don't come here for a date or a special occasion you come here for some greasy goodness and a cold brew.  They have a nice beer selection ranging from domestic to import to craft.  I've eaten here a couple of times and have never been disappointed with the food.  They have a happy hour and usually have drink specials once that ends.  Good amount of tv's all usually playing something different.  As the night gets later I tend to avoid this place as it becomes a hub for all things that are drunk Steven's students.  Screaming girls wishing their boyfriends would take them somewhere to dance and their boyfriends wishing their girlfriends would shut up and watch the game.  Get out before sundown and you're in the clear.
2014-12-23,2,This place is awful. The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because of the atmosphere of the restaurant. All though everything about this place sucks, it is still a good spot to watch a sporting event. I went to this place with 5 of my friends. When we sat down 3 different servers came up and said the server would be right over. 15 minutes later she showed up and we knew it was going to be a long night. My girlfriend ordered a strawberry mojito and everyone else had ordered beers. First of all, it took 15 minutes for her to grab the beers and mojito which was very long for the amount of people in the restaurant. I would say there was maybe 2-3 other tables in the entire place. The strawberry mojito was easily the worst drink I've ever seen in a restaurant. It tasted like 6 oz of Malibu rum, soda water and there were about 5-6 limes in the drink? Tasted absolutely terrible and we returned it. So at this point it has taken us 20 minutes to get draft beers and some shit mojito drink. Our food then came out. My gf and I had the buffalo chicken wrap and the chicken fajita wrap aka a burrito that they tried to give an cool name. Both were awful, we each took about 3 bites and called it a day. This establishment sucks. Service was beyond bad and there were no systems. It should never take 20 min to get a draft beer when there are 3-4 tables in the restaurant. The saying of the night - "your _____ is on its way." We heard it so many times we joked about it for the rest of the night. This place is simply a joke.
2014-12-21,4,Went here for brunch on a Sunday, and arrived around 11am. There was no wait for my friend and me, which was nice. It was relatively empty, so our waitress was almost over attentive where she interrupted conversations quite a bit to constantly check-in; however, just seems silly to complain about something like that. Food was just ok, nothing special and I wouldn't really even describe it as good. Was just adequate. My friend and I split pitchers of sangria, which were $10--a great deal. We spent quite a bit of time there and, while it got busy, it never got busy enough where we felt pressured to leave because we were monopolizing a table. Overall a good experience, even if it wasn't the most delicious or impressive place!
2014-12-18,4,Had a great time at trivia night here. It seems to draw a diverse crowd, and questions are tough enough while still being fun. We stayed so long we closed down the place.
2014-12-07,5,This bar is really great for any day of the week. Trivia night Tuesday's, Friday happyHours, sports game nights, or Saturday dinner dates. We've made trivia night here a tradition- they give away great prizes and really get everyone involved. My only complaint is that they take too much time in between rounds for Trivia, so everyone cheats! They should shorten the time so everyone has to think quick.  Good people & good times Also, amazing bar food!!! Usually, when you go to a bar you should expect the regular mozzarella sticks and fried food menu that's pretty mediocre. This bar has healthy food and a selection too! AND it's delicious! My group of friends and I got a burger, the veggie wrap and a salad All of them were absolutely excellent. This surprised me for a casual bar but their food was GREAT and it's a fun time to go to to hang out. I highly recommend this place! :)
2014-12-05,4,This place has one of the best bar food situations in Hoboken. The chicken Caesar wrap-- scratch that, any wrap, is amazing. Swap out regular fries for sweet potato fries-- you won't be disappointed. On weekends the vibe is casual and decent-- usually a jukebox is playing patron-requested songs. Oh, and brunch is seriously awesome. Sangria pitcher Sundays!!
2014-11-17,4,Delicious buffalo chicken wrap. Good fries. Great service. A little expensive.
2014-11-17,4,Place was great, easy to get to. The bartender was chill, she was on top of our drinks at all times. The pre made frozen margaritas pack a punch.My girlfriend had a sandwich, it came out in a timely manner and she loved it. I would totally come back here again for drinks or casual bar food.It's definitely a small venue, but wasn't near packed at all. It was a Monday night though, so I can't account for the weekend crowd. They had a bunch of TVs to watch the Eagles game but I'm pretty sure there was no volume on the TV.
2014-11-15,3,We came for sangria, the bar was kinda slow for a Saturday night. Sangria was strong had a nice kick to it. Didn't eat here. If your looking for a good place for sangria I'd advise to try elsewhere
2014-11-12,3,As a Stevens Alumni, I've been to most of the bars in Hoboken on multiple occasions. This past weekend, I took a newer group of friends for a short bar crawl down Washington St. Mikie Squared was our second stop. We had the sangria. They were tasty, but not too strong. On Sundays, they do $10 pitchers of sangria, which is a good deal since it fills up about 6 glasses.I've been here to eat too. The food is ok, but you're probably better off eating a real meal elsewhere and maybe having an appetizer here while drinking.
2014-11-03,2,Do yourself a favor and don't eat here. We ordered nachos for an appetizer and I got a BLT wrap with onion rings. Everything was so bad. The nachos were soggy and they were served with this bright purple bean dip that did not look edible. The wrap tasted like nothing (mostly lettuce) and the onion rings were greasy and soggy. This is the worst meal I've had in a long time. Maybe it's good for drinks but the food was a joke.
2014-11-01,1,This place over night upped their prices by 50% on their wraps. I undoubtedly go here any day of the week for a steak wrap and beer. Now their wrap is on white bread and costs $17 instead of $10. Is it farm to table or something? Like nothing about this bar drastically changed to make them righteous for charging this much for a wrap. Sorry mikie, never going back.
2014-10-18,2,My friend and I went here for the first time for brunch. Unfortunately, my first time is my last time visiting this establishment. We were initially drawn by the outdoor seating, but that's where our attraction ended. While we were quickly seated, the service was flaky. My server forgot my mimosa and I received it with my food well after my partner received hers. The food was bland and unimaginative. The omelette was greasy and the potatoes lacked flavor. The final bill did not justify the experience we had.
2014-10-12,3,Nice place, food is standard bar food but it's pretty good. Prices are okay overall; sangria Sundays is the best day to go!
2014-09-30,5,I go to Mikie Squared for trivia on Tuesday nights and once in a while on weekends for drinks.  The service is excellent; the bartenders are so friendly and attentive they are some of my favorite in Hoboken! Tuesday for trivia is always a good time and if you're getting some appetizers I highly recommend the Filet Mignon tips - they're so delicious. It is pieces of filet mignon on garlic toast with this awesome green pesto sauce. I have no idea what is in the sauce but it's great.  You wouldn't think you'd get that good of food at a place that serves the standard "bar food"...but trust me it is. This a great place to watch sports games, hang out for trivia, or just grab a drink.
2014-09-18,3,Have had food delivered and eaten in.  A year or two ago this would have been 5  Stars, recently...not so much.   The food is still good, the burgers are especially delicious.  I like the option to chose any side with your burger (fries, sweet potato salad etc) and love getting the side spinach salad.My biggest issue is the service.  Delivery times usually take over an hour with the food arriving cold and soggy.  Have also had a few issues with missing items or the incorrect sides.  When I eat-in, service is better nit still not great.  A simple beer order would take 10 minutes to get and we'd seem to be forgotten about often.Again great food, slow service
2014-08-24,4,Brunched at Mikie Squared for the second time. My fellow diner had the pineapple chicken sandwich both times, so obviously a winner if he can't tear himself away. I went for the huevos rancheros the first time. Needed some extra heat, but very tasty. This visit I sampled the steak and eggs. I understand that hangar steaks can be gamey; this was no exception. I had some trouble physically cutting it at first, but once I got in there, it was juicy and flavorful. The over easy eggs were cooked perfectly and the breakfast potatoes were crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, just as they should be.Sat outside both times. Seating is a bit squeezed out there. Inside looks like an upscale sports bar vibe. Diners at a nearby table brought a dog, and the restaurant was very accommodating, bringing out a water bowl for it. On both occasions, dining here was an enjoyable experience. Look forward to trying M2 for lunch or dinner.
2014-07-31,4,Great American food, cooked perfectly. always go on a Sunday for "Sunday funday" $10 pitchers of sangria, which were amazing.
2014-06-21,5,I had the Cindy is always on a diet salad and it was perfect!!! I loved that they don't skimp. Plenty of veggies, and grilled chicken. It would be nice if the veggies were on a small bed of lettuce just for a bit of crunch.  See photo it was delish!!! Def going back.
2014-06-18,3,I LOVE their chicken fajita wrap but why don't they just call it a burrito already! It has rice and refried beans for god sake! Service can be questionable at times.
2014-06-13,4,First time I went to Mikie's was with a few bros to watch the game, drink beers and grab some food.  Plenty of TVs, check.  Respectable tap selection, check.  Quality food--well, that doesn't quite say it.  In fact, the food is what gets this place four stars.  In particular, the summer seasonal specials were fantastic.  The Maple Chipotle Wings were out-of-this-world delicious!  My friends spoke highly about the Tropical Chicken Sandwich and the Triple Decker Chicken Club, and I will put my stamp of approval on the Portobello Chicken Wrap.I heard Mikie's puts together an impressive Sunday atmosphere, so if that lives up to the hype I may be tacking on another star.  To be continued...
2014-05-27,4,Sangria Sunday!!! Very good sangria, most importantly they are strong and a pitcher is only 10 dollars. If you are manly man, and don't feel cool with a glass of sangria in your hand, try a MANMOSA, they are strong and very tasty, and Man is in the title so it is ok to drink it. Their food is pretty good as well, nothing special, but the sandwiches and wraps are solid, and the nachos are ok. This is a bar before restaurant, and there are a better spots in Hoboken for food, but sangria sunday is a great way to get a buzz on before you start your week.
2014-05-04,2,Mike we loved you until today...... My husband and I usually frequent Mikie Sqaured for their popular sangria sunday. 10 Dollar pitchers of pretty good sangria complemented by average bar grub. Today we visited with a group of 5. We ordered our sangria along with wings to start and entrees for all. It was not until we asked for a refill on our sangria that the waiter informed us today Sangria was not 10 dollars. Due to the street fair in town they were not honoring their typical sangria special.  For a restaurant that has a sign outside advertising sangria sunday and signs all over the restaurant stating sunday sangria specials .....shame on you. Our waiter was kind enough to say it was out of his hands and comped our first pitcher out of courtesy. We were grateful of this. We were disappointed to see that Mikie was price gauging and trying to take advantage  of the influx of people in town due to the art fair. Disappointing.
2014-05-04,1,Used salt instead of sugar in mojitos...poor, slow service when restaurant wasn't busy too.
2014-05-03,4,really pleasantly surprised at how GREAT the burgers were here. bartender was awesome too. I didn't expect much from this place and will def go back
2014-04-17,1,Highly overrated.  I went there on 04/17/2014 for lunch.  Watch our for sneaky price changes that don't match their menu so they can nickle and dime you out of some money.I ordered the Veggie Wrap with a side of Sweet Potatoe fries.  The Veggie wrap was described to include the following;  toasted grilled zuchinni, squash, mushrooms, asparagus, peppers, onions,& goat cheese.    Basically the wrap was 95% mushrooms and rest was just filled with barely anything.  The menu says they charge $8 dollars buy my receipt said $10.   In addition, the fries were soggy just like the sandwich. .   To top it off, they advertise $2 dollar Coorslights & Yuengling pints during lunch 12-3.  Yep, I was billed $3 dollars for my Coorslight.   There are a million other better places in Hoboken to spend your money.... FACT
2014-03-20,1,Customer service is terrible.  My boyfriend and I went there for brunch. The waitress sat us at a small table for 2 cramped between a loud obnoxious table of people. I asked to sit at the table that had for seats  instead. The waitress said "no. It's reserved for people who have parties of four". Less than 5 minutes later a couple (2 people) were seated at that table "reserved for only guest with parties of four"..
2014-03-02,4,We were seated as a party of 2 very quickly on a Friday night. Our waitress was super nice and friendly. I like any bar where this Philly girl can get a Yuengling. We placed an order for the chicken grande nachos and the maple teriyaki wings. THE WINGS WERE GREAT-GET THE WINGS!For dinner we got the stuffed chicken breast and the steak sandwich. Honestly our only complaint was that they brought our dinners out while we were still working on the apps and there was no room on the table. When our main courses came out they were cold because they hadn't been placed in the oven or under a heat lamp. We will definitely be back because these are the best wings I've found in Hoboken!
2014-02-05,4,Fun sports bar with great bar food and good sangria (half priced on Sunday). The staff is very friendly. You can't go wrong with the Filet Mignon sandwich or the Chicken Caesar wrap. Also has pretty good French onion soup. Not the biggest fan of their brunch...I would stick to the regular menu. Also, sometimes it tends to get pretty loud and some of the clientele can be obnoxious. Overall fun sports bar that has the best bar food in Hoboken in my opinion.
2014-01-11,3,Here be found one of the best burgers in the "Boken". The Max burger is one of the tastiest, filling and satisfying burgers around. Mikes is a great bar for relaxing and having some decent bar food. The world famous wings are tasty but not spectacular. Well made for a sports viewing outing, these semi sweet wings hit the spot when matched with Mikes great happy hour Martinis.
2013-11-24,5,Service: always friendly,  both at the bar and at tables.Food: strong menu, lots of variation but not overwhelming range of choices, quality/taste always ranges between very good and greatValue: fine for what you get, a decent lunch special would be nice
2013-11-01,5,I had a recent amazing experience with their catering. I had a halloween party last Friday night and wanted to have some finger foods. I ordered 5 trays from here of an assortment of appetizers. They showed up on time, the food was AMAZING and fresh and everyone loved it, I basically had noting left after my guests were done with it. Highly recommended for catering will definitely use again.
2013-10-20,5,Brunch was great today. We sat outside, had strawberry and banana pancakes, a breakfast burrito (which was surprisingly spicy in a good way) and an omelette which I can't remember the name of but there was a lot of meat in it. The service was fast, the food was great, and the coffee was fresh. Wouldn't normally think of this place as a brunch spot but we will from now on. Great experience.
2013-10-18,4,I'm becoming the queen of reviewing bars solely on their food!I came to Mikie Squared based on a Yelp search for a Hoboken burger. I saw "fresh, never frozen" and was 85% sold! I'd had a conversation recently with a friend about how I'd never had a memorable straight up burger in Jersey. I wondered, could this be it?! Reviews were a little mixed but mostly good things about the burger...I decided to take the chance. When I entered for lunch there was a couple sitting outside and 1 guy at the bar inside. I took a seat at 1 of the tables in the front, near the door. The bartender/waiter came right over with water and a menu. I pretended to peruse the menu as if I didn't know that I was only there for "the juiciest burger in town" as they call it. I placed my order and passed the time by reviewing my lunch from the day before lol. The burger came out pretty quickly (I mean I was basically the only customer) and was a perfect medium (secret: I've taken to ordering my burgers medium-rare cause just about everybody seems to over cook them). I thoroughly enjoyed this burger! It was a nice size and indeed pretty damn juicy. It had a great sear and pretty pink center. The cheddar cheese was melted and yummy. The medium-thickness fries it came with were the perfect accompaniment and really good in their own right. I will definitely be back for another burger!
2013-09-18,4,The wraps and sandwiches are awesome.  Some of the best include the filet mignon sandwich/wrap and Alyssa's everyday chicken sandwich/wrap.  They also have good sangria (white and red).  Most of the other food I've eaten here has been pretty good too.  But in my mind this is a place to go have appetizers or sandwiches and chug a few beers or a few glasses of sangria.The atmostphere is usually pretty upbeat and it's always a good time, and the bartenders are really cool.I ordered delivery from here once and it took an an hour and ten minutes to arrive.  The food was still good, however the sweet potato fries were soggy (pretty much impossible to avoid with delivery), so I would recommend getting a side salad instead when ordering for delivery.  But after taking such a long time to deliver the food, we'd probably just go there in person next time.
2013-09-01,1,One star for outdoor seating and good beer, which probably many other places have on this block. Terrible service. No utensils, no napkins, we had to get our own ketchup, and own napkins and had to remind the waiter twice for our drinks. My brother in law was essentially the waiter even though someone took our order. Save yourself an evening and go to the many other cool spots on this street.
2013-08-29,3,Not much to really say here about Mikie Squared. It's a decent spot among half-way decent spots in Hoboken. The food is okay, not great. I don't know why people rave about the food too much. It's average. It's a great spot for young people, not so much for older people trying to have conversation over sunday brunch. Space seems to always be the biggest issue here. It can especially be quite uncomfortable sitting outside on those seats. Best time to come here is earlier in the late morning for Sunday brunch before the drunk beasts come marching in. Prices are decent, and the staff is okay. Three stars is generous.
2013-08-14,4,Best bar food in Hoboken, in my opinion. I haven't had a wrap or salad there that wasn't delicious - and their homemade honey balsamic dressing is the best! The buffalo chicken wrap is also one of the best. They don't give me a hard time when I modify something from the menu either (which I constantly do!). Brunch is also good. And I recently discovered that they deliver! They have fun drinks and good specials. Usually not too crazy, especially in the summer which is nice, and they have outdoor seating. I honestly mostly come here for the food and maybe a drink or 2 on a Sunday or Monday night during football/basketball seasons. I'll continue to be a regular!
2013-08-03,2,Had the pulled pork sandwich. I liked pulled pork sandwiches and the idea of a "pulled pork rib" sandwich was impossible to pass on. Unfortunately it tasted like a Sloppy Joe sandwich with way too much bbq sauce. The chipotle wings were ok but nothing special...maybe we just didn't get the "1st runner up" effort tonight? I'd come back for some drinks but the food won't have me rushing back soon.
2013-07-13,2,The steak sandwich on the lunch menu was delicious but the whole meal felt a little dirty.  Our forks were dirty, there was glitter and no ice in my iced coffee, there was empty sugar packets and a piece of potato in our sugar basket. My parents were appalled.  Then to top it off my chicken sandwich experienced "complications". When I asked what that meant, I was told they saw a hair on it when they were bringing it out.  Scared to see what the kitchen looks like in this place.
2013-06-24,5,Popped into Mikie Squared late on a Sunday night and despite the fact that they were clearly about to close, the bartender Alyssa was extremely friendly and personable.  We didn't feel rushed to leave at all.  Will definitely go back soon!!
2013-06-08,1,This place is falling... Outdated beer, poor food quality, and the horrible downhill outside seating arrangement. Good spot for drinks food isn't anything special it's like they rush, slow and steady wins the race. Ehhh me thinks not...
2013-06-05,3,Ive been here a few times and it is just a typical hoboken bar. Nothing great, but not bad either. I have to agree that the Sangria deal on Sunday is nice.. i love sitting outside and enjoying a nice pitcher of Sangria. I know on tuesdays that have a martini special for $5. last night i had the raspberry martini, and it was pretty good. Ive eaten the salads here, and they are also good. I would definitely check this place out if you come to hoboken often, it just wouldnt be on the top of my list.
2013-05-20,5,I absolutely love this place, whether it's Sangria Sunday a random weeknight or ordering food, Mikies has it all. If you stop by on a Sunday check out their $10 pitchers of red, white, or hidden gem of Blue Sangria. They always have $5 strawberry margaritas which are delicious and on Tuesdays they have a wide variety of martinis which are also $5. Annnnd if you just want to order some food I would recommend the filet mignon wrap which is amazing and the artichoke dip-seriously you can't go wrong with any food from this place. Basically long story short, I love this place.
2013-05-11,4,Not bad. We were seated immediately around 11 am on a Saturday. I did some people watching. They had a breakfast and lunch menu. The food was fresh and brought out quickly. As expected, coffee here was not really the best. By the time we finished eating, there were a lot more people waiting. 3.5 stars - it wasn't amazing but no complaints.
2013-05-10,3,I really do like Mikie squared. The food is good but the crowd there at night/weekends can be really annoying.  The staff is really kind but when it's that crowded, you don't get the same service you would get on a weekday.  And I feel like on the weekends, they have extra staff who do not really care about their customers simply due to the crowd of crazy people that come around that time (which I get) I literally got yelled at by a waitress because she was holding a tray of beers. "GET OUT OF MY WAY UNLESS YOU WANT BEERS SPILLED ALL OVER YOU" (Of course, we were only in the way because the host was taking us to her section to eat.)  She was much nicer then.   Why do I give this place 3 stars?  Because everyone else is really nice!  I really love the Tropical Chicken sandwich and Sangria Sunday is awesome. ($10 for a pitcher) But if you hate the Steven's crowd and all those yuppies coming back from playing Zog sports, then coming here on a weekend is simply not for you.  Or maybe outdoor seating is a good option during the warmer weather. But do try it during the week! It's a great spot  .
2013-05-07,3,Your typical bar in Hoboken, nothing special. I came here for Cinco de Mayo brunch. I had the Eggs Benedict ($11) which was okay. Boyfriend had the Big Belgian Waffle ($10) which came literally drowning in what I felt like was every banana and strawberry that existed in Hoboken. Of course I had to try it and it was delicious! One of the better waffles I've had in a while. Mimosas ($7) were okay, I prefer the $2 Mimosas at 1 Republik. (TWO DOLLAR MIMOSAS!!) The Bloody Marys were great. I've been on the hunt for a good Bloody Mary in Hoboken and I think this is the best I've had so far. Would come back for Bloodys but food, not so much.Oh and service was suppppppppperrrrrrrr slow. So slow that we literally had to order our next drinks as our first drinks came because by the time we finished our current drinks, the next one probably still wouldn't have arrived yet.
2013-05-07,4,I thought the food w good for a Hoboken bar. Service was great even with wall to wall people.Filet mignon sandwich was cooked perfect. Mozzarella was nice and fresh.
2013-04-23,4,Who doesn't love this place? It's always fun, good set up, never empty or too packed. They have fun game nights and good fast food dishes. It is right in the center of Hoboken which makes it convenient. Good service, friendly bartenders.
2013-04-15,4,I've been here multiple times and the food is always delicious for bar food. Service can be spotty but it's definitely worth it for drink specials and food.
2013-04-12,5,Love Mikie Squared! I come here often with my boyfriend for lunch/brunch and have been a couple times for trivia night with friends. Great casual atmosphere and lots of TVs if watching sports is your thing. Mikie Squared has GREAT food. I'm always so surprised how good their food is considering they're a bar. I usually order one of their wraps with sweet potato fries. Recently tired one of their burgers and it was SLAMMIN'. My favorite drink here is the man-mosa. Tip: If you come for trivia night, show up early. The space isn't too large and they fill up quickly.
2013-04-07,3,A group of us came here before our dinner reservation the other night.  It's not the biggest bar, but we were able to snatch up some bar stools.  The bartender was very attentive while we were here and got us our drinks very quickly.  I stuck to the beers - I had the Yuengling they had on tap.  There were 8 beers on tap - not the best selection, but I guess it could be slightly worse.  Our group also ordered some sangria - they thought it was very good.  I am not a fan of sangria so I did not have any but I'll take their word for it.  We also got an order of the mozzarella sticks and they were very tasty.  It could have just been that I was pretty hungry but I was impressed.  I definitely enjoyed my time at this relatively low key bar on Washington Street.  I also thought the prices were pretty reasonable.  I would definitely return.
2013-03-19,4,Really good food.I came here looking for a low key dinner on a Friday night - nothing fancy but somewhere to sit down and relax - This place seemed to follow suite.  Everyone was friendly inside and although it seems as thought it's main function is as a bar they have adequate tables for dinner as well.We got the pulled pork sandwich which was absolutely fantastic.  Way above and beyond what you would expect from a pulled pork sandwich at any bar.  And we also ordered a Cobb salad which was fresh and presented very well - again, much more than you would expect for a regular bar and grill.All the staff from the hostesses to the waiters were extremely friendly.  They also had a pretty vast drink selection and lots of beers on tap.  I was very surprised and impressed with this place.
2013-03-15,4,Good burgers and buffalo chicken wraps!  The Pizza/chicken fingers eh not so much.  They're super fast when it comes to making their food so this is a good spot to hit during the week if you want to have a beer and eat real quick.
2013-03-10,4,Really good food for a bar. Sandwiches and salads are highly recommended. Sangria on Sundays is a great treat. During football it gets really crowded, but overall it is good place to hang out with friends and catch up.
2013-03-07,1,Terrible. The way they handled the St. Patrick's situation in Hoboken was just straight up shady. First of all, they were charging a $10 cover at the door, and offered no real specials inside to offset the cost. Even worse, they were only accepting cash...let's just say that on any other slow Saturday they accept cards. Inside was smelly, dark and dirty. I wouldn't come here again.
2013-02-20,4,Don't know if I would call this place a hidden gem, but its definitely great.  Mikie Squared is fast becoming my weekday low key drinking spot for a couple reasons:  friendly, attentive staff and really really good food.  So far the best Mac n Cheese I've had in Hoboken and the Filet Mignon tips are amazing.  Great place to catch a game also, plenty of tv's around to grab your attention.
2013-02-06,4,I repeat-- get the nachos when you come here! They get better and better everytime :)
2013-01-07,3,The bloody marys are HORRIBLE.  Bad.  Offensive.  Do not order.The food is pretty good otherwise, and trivia on tuesdays is fun.  There are always drink specials but none of them are any good.
2013-01-05,4,We came to Mikie Squared for NYE and for $85 per person, it was well worth it! We had a buffet which consisted of tomato and mozzarella, pastas, salads, ribs, lemon chicken, and assortment of desserts. Open bar (which worked out great for us as we sat at the bar), and a midnight champaign toast. The bar had a nice crowd but wasn't crowded. The bartenders were extremely friendly and had a good time themselves. Even on such a busy night, the bathrooms were relatively clean. This was the perfect pick for a NYE celebration if you live in the hoboken area and want to avoid the city commute.
2012-12-28,3,This place a wide selection of beers and they can mix if you're into that. From what I heard they have the best bar food in town I don't know myself. The one down side is that is get crowded but it's understandable since it's in Washington St.
2012-12-02,4,I really like Mikie Squared. It's one of the more chill places to hang out in Hoboken, but still really fun. The staff is always really friendly and the drink and food prices are pretty cheap.As for food, I've had the eggs benedict for brunch there - not the best I've had but definitely decent. Their wraps and salads are great - my favorite is the buffalo chicken (wrap and salad are both delish). The "Cindy is always on a diet" salad is also very good. My boyfriend always gets the Maxx burger, which he loves.If you're looking for a more laid back atmosphere in Hoboken this is definitely the place.
2012-10-11,4,Order the filet mignon steak tips on garlic toast, and the shrimp corn chowder, and you will be happy happy.
2012-08-30,5,Gotta say I love this plac.e  In my opinion, Mikies serves the best bar food in Hoboken.
2012-08-10,1,Worst burger I have ever had.  On the menu they list juiciest burger in town.  I ordered medium burger and got a over cooked dry one instead.  Never going back.
2012-07-28,4,I have to say, this is one of best places for brunch in Hoboken. If you're looking for a no fuss kind of place, this is it. It's relaxed, the staff is great, the food is good and the drinks are cheap. It's a Win Win!
2012-07-09,4,Food is alright but the Sangrias is wonderful and so it the price! $10 a pitcher on weekends for brunch..awesomeness...
2012-06-08,5,Good food, good prices, good beer.  I've been watching the hockey finals here and the only complaint I have are the frozen margs.  Stay away from those, but otherwise there is must to like about this place.  Great food selection, plenty of TV's without being overwhelming and just all around a great atmosphere.  Also outdoor seating.  Can get crowded when a big game is on, but I never felt sufficated there.
2012-05-03,4,I feel weird updating places and giving them the same number of stars as my original reviews, but I also feel it's good to see some things never change (and that's a good thing). after all, I fear change.Mikie's is still one of my favorite places to start up a night out in Hoboken. I love the fact that it's consistently a fun, nonpretentious atmosphere with a little something for everyone. it doesn't strive to be one of the many tropes that some other Hoboken bars fall into. a few TVs with various sports games, but not too many that it drives you crazy because you can't focus on one. coming here on game days is lots of fun. there is a positive vibe and not just drunk people looking to smash something when their team loses.a decent beer list (they've got Magic Hat, Blue Point, Woodpecker Cider, and some other good brews in addition to the usual big names) and excellent mixed drinks.GREAT food. the filet mignon tips with the lime/cilantro sauce and the nachos are my favorite appetizers (the filet mignon is also availabe in sandwich or wrap). for entrees, besides the great variety of wraps and burgers, I highly recommend the "drunken caveman" pork chops made with cranberries and JACK DANIELS SAWWWWCE. if you're looking to eat healthier they have various salads and a fair amount of the menu is grilled. they're also very accommodating to modifying your order.various specials and events throughout the week. $5 martinis, trivia nights, holiday parties, $2 Yuenglings after 11 on weekends, and of course, Sangria Sundays ($10 pitchers).the service can be a little lagging time-wise, but it's never terrible. understandable, since it's usually a busy place, at least when I go. the staff are friendly too.it's not a perfect bar, but it's still very good - and that's really all you need to get things going for a wild night in Ho-ho-hoboken...
2012-04-23,5,I have only been to mikie squared for sunday brunch. The food is great. The staff is great and the $10 sangria pitchers are awesome. Best sangria ive had in a long time and for a great price! Love this place! Definetly will come back!
2012-03-06,4,Finally! A good burger in Hoboken. I was beginning to think there was some conspiracy to make second-class food in this second-class town (NY). Mikie's burger is freshly made and does not disappear when you cover it with a bun! Also, the fries are great and MIkies seems to be the only place that can deliver them without arriving cold and limp. BBQ wings were pretty good, too. Overall, very impressed and will definitely try other stuff since it can't be worse than the rest of the lame gastronomes Hoboken has to offer. One thing, don't go there for trivia night. Takes about an hour per question. totally lame.
2012-02-29,4,I went to Mikie Squared for the first time a few years ago, then again about a year later.  After going for a third time last weekend I have no idea why I waited so long to go back.  Out of the 6 meals ordered for my 4 friends and I (we ordered blueberry pancakes to share since we all had so much trouble deciding) only one had a slight issue. The steak in one meal was over cooked. It was ordered medium and came out well done.  However, besides the one issue the rest of the meal was a great experience.  The other food was delicious and very filling.  The staff was amazing.  There was constantly someone nearby , whether waiter or bus boy, asking if we needed anything and refilling drinks. It was the perfect place to take my out of town friends for a great meal after a great night out.
2012-02-24,4,Only was here once and it was a while ago, but I distrinctly remember having the baby back pork sandwich and it being incredibly tender, moist, and delicious. Need to make it a point to go back soon.
2012-02-21,5,While I'm not be a fan of Mikie as a nightlife destination, their food is just that consistently good.A broad menu of typical bar food complete with daily specials, everything is always executed perfectly.  Ability to substitute any side of fries for sweet potato fries, salad, or grilled or steamed vegetables is really a nice option.  Top 3 burger in town, and all the other staples are always spot on.The setup just doesn't do it for me to chill out for a night (lots of low tables; not ideal for someone who likes to stand and BS with different groups at the bar), they do have solid trivia on Tuesdays and the outdoor seating and big open windows are great when the weather is nice.
2012-01-24,3,My boyfriend planned a surprise get together for my birthday here.  Walking in on a Saturday night around 10pm, it was shockingly dead for a Hoboken bar.  The bar area is pretty small.  We all sat in the back and my group of friends was basically their entire book of business for the night.  Considering that fact, I was disappointed to later learn that even though we drank, ate and did birthday shots all night there were no buy backs.  Aside from that, the bartenders working that night weren't all that friendly.  Listen, I know drunk people can be annoying and sometimes say stupid things but you're a bartender- it's your job to pretend you're amused and just keep making drinks with a smile.  Someone else mentioned the music was too low.  I'd have to agree with that statement.  I can't even remember hearing a song play that night.  Overall I didn't think this was a horrible bar (then again, I was on a birthday high!), but with all the other choices available in Hoboken, I think they have some work to do on service and music.
2012-01-12,4,I am pretty big fan of Mikie Squared. After reading some other reviews, I was a little surprised to read that people found staff to be sub par. Maybe I came on a good day, but I thoroughy enjoyed my service. Our server Juan was the best, tending to our every need and recommending the DELICIOUS Alyssa's Everyday Chicken Wrap. If I were to go I would ask for him to be our server again. The only two issues I had were the extremely low lights and poor choice in music as well as its volume. We went for dinner and sat toward the back. I was a little annoyed at how hard it was to see things around me. I was also a little disappointed that a tv was right above my head- seeing how it's a bar and grill I had hoped the bar/TV part could be kept away from the dining part. All together, food and service were great. Some minor atmospheric changes would have definitely garnered 5 stars!!
2012-01-12,3,I took my Phillygirl best friend here for brunch after a weekend of college-caliber boozing. Holy liver damage.Stacks was packed, and they don't serve booze anyway. Hello, Mikie Squared.I ordered the Mikie's omelette, which is veggies and cheese. But with eggwhites. It comes with bacon and potatoes. Y U M.Best friend is a weirdo and ordered everything ala carte--scrambled eggs, toast and bacon. She was subsequently served her breakfast on three separate plates.My omelette was good, if a little overcooked. But out waitress was really sweet. I didn't try any breakfast cocktails...since I think at that point I was emitting fumes of vodka and olive juice.I have heard the nightlife scene is good, TBD this weekend I think.
2012-01-02,3,I went for SNF and had a good time. They were very accommodating to our growing party even though it was a packed house. The sangria wasn't all that great, so after one pitcher of the red sangria, we stuck to beer. The nachos were good. Our waiter was genuinely nice and was quick to get anything we requested.
2011-10-22,1,Slow service and management is nasty to customers. I heard the sangria is the big hit but it tasted like Yago with fruit slices in it. Overpriced food came out cold. Stick to the other bars further up or down town.
2011-10-21,3,A great place to sit down and drink outside with friends. Cheap prices, lots of specials. My only complaint is the food. All three times I ate here the food came out pretty gross, the third time it got me sick.
2011-10-03,4,Best place for casual bar food in Hoboken. Its surprising that for how many bars there are in Hoboken, the food is usually pretty lousy, this place a has a great burger, sandwiches and other staples you'd expect from a typical bar menu. Its also a great deal and always has cheap drink deals.
2011-09-14,4,Solid 4-stars. Their $10 Sangria Pitcher Sunday keeps me coming back. Other food options I've had here have been decent as well. Go for the shrimp wrap (I don't know if it's on the printed menu for take-out), but remember it comes with chipotle mayo and can be a bit spicy. Service is typically hit or miss - totally missed after the "hurricane," but they were probably short staffed, so whatevs. It's a neighborhood spot that is decent 9 times out of 10 - hopefully you're not that icky "1."
2011-09-04,2,Don't do delivery!Waited just under 2 hours for delivery and unsurprisingly the food (2 buffalo chicken wraps - def. not a hefty order) was cold, soggy, and not worth the $25, not including tip. Sad, because when I have eaten food there, I've been satisfied with quality/ service/ speed.I waited a long time to order food here because I thought it would be REALLY slow, but they were 2x worse than I could have imagined. Yes it was a weekend night at 7:30 when I ordered, but come the f on - 2 hours?! I live maybe a 10 min. walk away too.After we called 1.5 hours in to check on where our order was, too, no offer to give us a discount on bill, our next order, or any of the like was given.  As for the scene at the bar, it's okay, but not the kind of place you'd go out of your way to visit.  Food & beer quality was not terrible, but it's a classic Hoboken scene with bad top 40 music played too loud (they have a juke box, but the selection is pathetic), divey but w/o character (more because it's dark and dirty), lots of d-bag's and their dates, and it's claustrophobic.After the bad delivery experience, I can't support the mediocre joint anymore.  And while I may be being a tad judgmental on the actual bar, believe me, do not do delivery!
2011-09-02,4,Gotta thank yelp for this one.  Was in a couple places in the area that weren't really doing it for me, and it was only then I remembered to use the trusty Yelp app.  Glad I did, this place was really cool.  There were a lot of things on this menu that you rarely find in most sports bars.  The outdoor seating was nice and the service was great. This place was packed for a Tuesday night, which I'm sure is a sign of how good it is. If for some reason I ever again end up in Hoboken, this place will be my first stop.
2011-08-30,3,Sports Bar ~ Laid Back ~ Good Drink SpecialsThis place is good for that random Monday night when you want to get out and watch the game, eat pretty good bar food and wash it down with $2 drafts. You come here mainly for the atmosphere, the good drink specials and to root for your boys in Green, or whichever you prefer ;) FYI the owner Mike Fasciano also owns Margherita's Pizza and Cafe in Hoboken and is straight off the boat from Italy. Alli's Report Card:Food: The food is pretty good but nothing amazing. Mikie's goes a step above traditional bar food and offers seafood dishes such as Lobster Ravioli ($16) very good burgers and an extensive wrap menu ($10 - $14) I'd stick to the burgers and capitalize on the cheap drafts and $10 Sangria Pitchers, which they also have Monday nights, not just Sundays. Apps: Nachos Grande (($10) were eh, not very good the beans weren't good and the cheese didn't fully cover the chips which is no bueno. Entree: Crab cake sandwich ($13) was ok, cooked well but didn't seem super fresh, might have had something to do with the fact that Hurricane Irene tore through Hoboken two nights prior, either way I was pretty adventurous to try it. The Maxx Burger ($14) was very good, juicy,  fresh avocado, bacon smothered in cheese, yum. Sweet Potato fries were very good cooked very well with a slight crisp, just the way it should be. Booze: $2 drafts and $10 Sangria pitchers. Sold.Service: Very good, Juan rocked it but I think its hard not to since the place is small he was always within earshot. Decor/Layout: Decor is your typical sports bar decor but not super nice. I added layout because I wanted to point out this place is long and narrow, I don't love when bars are long and narrow, and this place is kind of small. If you want to watch the game you have to sit at the bar. I had to move locations because the table I was at I couldn't see the screens. Plating: C - Not the focus of this place but not bad for a sports bar. Date Night: Unless you want to impress him with your football knowledge and chug a few cold ones, take him somewhere less sports-barish. Girls Night : Yes if you are all sports fans.Large Party Gathering of Friends: Yes, this place is somewhat small but can accommodate.
2011-08-17,4,I've only had one bad experience here and that was on a Sunday for brunch - the $10 pitcher of sangria that I ordered before sitting down didn't arrive until after the food arrived and the waiter hardly checked on us. Is that enough explanation for you?This review isn't about the negative experience, but for all of the other good times.This last visit (tonight) was actually one of the best. We had a nice seat by the window and the server, Juan, was super attentive. I haven't seen the prix fixe before (maybe I wasn't looking for it), but decided to try it, and was extremely satisfied and surprised. I had the prime rib and it comes with two sides plus you get either a salad or soup to start and a glass of wine plus cheesecake or chocolate cake for dessert - for $24. WTF the prime rib costs $22 alone, so you're an idiot to not at least try it :)By the way, the bartenders are pretty social and people that frequent are pretty friendly so check it out and have a good time.
2011-08-11,3,Definitely a college/young people bar. Small intimate atmosphere. Can get very packed. The steak wrap and the fajita wrap are worth going for, but their claim to fame is definitely the $10 pitchers of Sangria on Sundays. The people who work there are also really nice and helpful, and  for the most part everyone gets a good view of the TV's to watch the games.
2011-07-22,3,My first impression of Mike Squared was me walking into the place to find a group of muscle heads pushing each other, yelling at the top of their lungs, and punching each other in the chest. I think I just found what people call "the typical jersey crowd". Aside from that the place was alright. My Tuesdays just became my Saturdays because of my work schedule so I was looking for a new place to hit up and meet some people. Since it was a Tuesday night, I understand that it was not the best night to be there but still the place did not impress me that much. They had some sports on the TV which was cool but that was pretty much it. The bartender was not talkative at all and when she was not doing a quick sweep of the bar she was in the corner chatting with the other employee there. With all that going on I finished the one beer that I ordered and headed for the door. Overall I gave this place a three star rating because of what I described above. I would have given it a two star but like I said earlier, it wasn't exactly a Friday night so I understand it was not that bumping. But I have seen other places in Hoboken do better on Tuesday nights. The bartender's attitude did not help much either. I may try this place again if I am out with people, but probably will not be returning anytime soon.
2011-06-09,5,This is by far my favorite place in Hoboken, however, I haven't tried every single restaurant in Hoboken quite yet.  I have gone to Mikie's for years and I'm never disappointed.  I've been there for brunch, lunch, pick up food in the middle of the day, dinner time, and late night drinks.  I've tried pretty much everything on their menu except for a few things.  I'm a huge fan of their Jose Chicken Honey Mustard Salad (not sure of exact name), wraps, apps, and other salads I suggest.  They've added more entrees that I haven't tried yet, but their food is consistent and their martini is great...Frog in a Blender is great!I have gone here enough to make an honest post and can say that I have never been disappointed here.  I've seen it all and have been here over 50 times.  I highly recommend!  Drink specials are good too through the week and they have trivia night (that has always been a huge hit and a fun time)
2011-05-13,5,Totally shameless, but whatever...this place is like my Cheers - I live three blocks away and a very close friend works there...-Adore $10 pitchers of Sangria on Sundays-Fave dishes include Shrimp Caesar Salad, Buffalo Chicken Wrap, Mac & Cheese, Sweet Potato Fries-Brunch Must Have:  French Toast with Amaretto SyrupFun theme events (Love Stinks, V-day; Cinquo de Mayo, Halloween Party), and trivia nights on Tues evenings - it's a fun mix of Stevens students, locals, and the after-work city crowd.
2011-02-19,4,If you do not feel like reading the whole thing....went there for the first time today for brunch and found the Huevos rancheros and home fries to be pretty freaking good! I have never had huevos rancheros before so i do not have anything to compare them to. I went there today for brunch with a friend and after looking at the small menu for a couple minutes decided on the "eggs of the ranch" i think that is what it means...hahaha..little blogger humor there. To me it was like an egg taco and it was tasty! They (2) were topped with some cheese and guacamole and i ate them very fast. The home fries that came along with it almost stole the show. Most time when you receive potatoes with your breakfast plate they are either the hash brown style or the cubed pieces of potato. In this case pieces of potato. They were cooked with some red peppers and onions like many you mike of had but for some reason these ones tasted like they were cooked by the hands of Jesus. I had a so so bloody mary along with my eggs. Bottom line...it was a one time deal, but hey gentle hands of Mikie treated me right and produced a breakfast/brunch dish i will remember for a while. Get the "eggs of the ranch" and let me know if i will be seeing you out there on the dusty trails!
2011-01-02,5,Been here once before going outSangria Sundays -- $10 pitchers = WIN! The price is good and the sangria is even better!They're food is pretty awesome too. I tried the "Montana de Nachos" with chicken and the Filet Mignon tips. The nachos were huge and came with enough toppings. The steak tips tender, juicy and served on small slices of garlic toast. Not as cheap as other Hoboken happy hour spots, but definitely worth it!
2010-12-15,4,I end up visiting Mikie Squared a few times a week. They play good music, always have sports on all their TVs, make delicious burgers, and have dynamite sweet potato fries.This place makes no pretensions. The crowd is relatively young and they're there to spend time together and have a drink. This bar doesn't suddenly become a dance club after 11pm. The bartender is friendly and pours a good pint of Guinness. And Tuesday night trivia has gift cards as prizes, which keeps you coming back. And how can you go wrong with $10 pitchers every Sunday?Guinness, Sam Adams Seasonal, Yeungling, and Blue Moon and Seasonal always on tap, which is a plus.
2010-11-22,5,This has been one of my go-to spots lately. Definitely the best bar food in Hoboken! The service was lacking a little during my last 2 visits, but the food makes up for it. I highly recommend the filet mignon tips - I'm obsessed with the cilantro lime vinegarette that it is served with, and I've gotten it on some of my salads, too. I would also recommend the tropical chicken wrap (it's listed as a sandwich, but you can get it as a wrap - my boyfriend got it as a sandwich last week and wasn't crazy about it on the bread) and the everyday chicken wrap. I would highly recommend Mikie's if you're looking to watch a game or have a few drinks, and have some great food as well!
2010-11-22,2,Good drink specials, boring bar food, lackadaisical staff.
2010-11-07,4,Last Thursday there was a party in my mouth.Well, that was the name of the martini, which was pretty awesome.  I've been to Mikie's many times and it never disappoints.I big favorite of mine is Sangria Sundays, where pitchers are $10.  I'm also a big fan of $2 select domestics at happy hour and $5 martinis.If you're going to order food (you should) try the buffalo chicken wrap or steak sandwich with cilantro lime sauce.There's plenty of TVs for sports coverage and the music doesn't suck.  All in all a great hangout bar!
2010-10-08,4,We swung by Mikie Squared on a random Tuesday afternoon. It was your average sports bar. I went for Honeymoon with a grilled shrimp wrap sandwich. The sandwich was good, but there didn't seem to be any break on the price of the beer, even though it was a really odd time to be at a bar and the place was pretty much empty. They seem to have trivia on Tuesday nights and the place is usually packed. I've yet to go in for the trivia but I hope to try it sometime soon!
2010-06-07,4,Best Tuesday trivia in town.$2 drafts make it an even better bet.Good for Sunday brunch too!
2010-05-03,5,we came in here to watch the mets game (no comment) after a day of walking around the hoboken arts & music fest. two people in our party got actual meals (salad and turkey burger) which they said were good. the other two of us split the mac and cheese bowl and spinach artichoke dip - both were absolutely delicious! good food plus $10 pitchers of sangria (sangria sundays) made me a very happy customer. i will absolutely be back for more sunday funday.
2010-05-02,3,Stopped by here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. The bar inside looked fun to hang out in... atmosphere was the typical bar: dark, beer, and lots of people. On to the food! We had sandwiches. They stuffed so much food into them that I could barely put my mouth around it which is a negative in my book. I like having my sandwich with bread on both sides, I don't like my bread to substitute as a second plate. Oh well. It was pretty tasty. The onion rings were the best part of our meals!We also had the pitcher of Sangria for $10. The Sangria was okay... good for the price.
2010-04-05,4,This was the first bar we stopped at when we went out for my buddy's birthday last Friday night. We had planned on hopping all night, but wound up staying here a bit longer than we anticipated (with good reason - plenty of TVs on so we could watch some Hockey)The bartenders and servers were pleasant, and the drinks were reasonble. (with $3 SoCo Lime shots, you can't really go wrong, plus a bunch of other great drink specials)Only issues we ran into were as follows:The bartender, or maybe it was just the server, didn't know what/how to make a liquid cocaine shot despite how many times my friend tried to explain/order it. (I think our server thought we were joking or something) I had ordered a Long Island Iced Tea for a few girls that were with us, and though it wasn't bad, It wasn't one of the best I've had. (then again I'm from Long Island, so I guess I'm spoiled)There was a bit too much redbull in the jagerbombs.I will most certainly be returning to Mikie Squared for future nights out.
2010-02-22,3,A. Was illogically easy to find a table (for dinner) at 8pm on a Fri eveB. Good looking yups abound; approx. ratio was 1.4:1.0 (M:F) at 10pm C. Waitress was suh-weet, i.e., nice and nice to look atD. Crab cake sandwich (it is a Friday in Lent, you sinners) was acceptable and fries (dang carbs!) were not overflowingE. Music was audible and ipod-worthyF. Smithwicks made me mad numb, which is a +I will hit it again.
2010-01-27,4,i absolutely adore this place due to the following 4 reasons:1. cheap drinks2. plenty of tv's3. lovely bartenders4. my wii bowling score here is greater than anywhere elseI hope you enjoy
2010-01-24,3,The atmosphere here leaves something to be desired - it's sort of a douchey crowd - but the food is great.  I've been here for brunch a few times and dinner once, it's cool and everything...just filled with meatheads.  I was sitting across from my friend and I couldn't even hear her talk, which was pretty obnoxious.One solid point - they serve $10 pitchers of sangria.  Yummmm.
2009-09-30,3,Not into sport's bars so I'm a little bias but the food is much better than expected and has a good atmosphere.
2009-09-14,4,Went back again and actually tried the food. It was a Sunday and the Giants were playing, so it was a bit packed. However, we were still able to get a seat without waiting. I had a southwest sandwich (pork, sweet bbq sauce, onions, swiss cheese)... $9 but it was awesome. really filling. it came with fries, which weren't too good - a bit too seasoned for my taste. my friend had a filet mignon sandwich with fresh mozz.. he also loved it (and also hated the fries).**Edit - the $9 sandwiches were on their LUNCH MENU ONLY. i went back for dinner recently and the same sandwiches were $12-$13. at $9, it's a decent deal.... $13 is a little overpriced for a sandwich + fries any way you cut it**we also split an order of wings... $6 for 8 wings... nothing special, and a little pricey considering that most bars had $.50 wings. at least they weren't bad.they also had $10 pitchers of yuengling, which we consumed a few of. the only bad thing is the tv layout.. if you're sitting all the way by the side, it's hard to see more than 1 or 2 of them. they do have one small tv by the back, which was easy to see however.i'd give them a 3.5 on this particular experience.. bumped up because the sandwich was that good, and also because the giants won.
2009-09-04,3,When most bars' happy hours stay open til 7pm, Mikie's goes the extra mile to extend it to 8pm, which is really the only reason we stopped in here.  I had a pretty decent burger and fries; not sure if it was worth $12, but I was seriously starving.  Service was efficient and polite, but don't expect a lot of attention (you are in a BAR so don't expect high maintenance service).  I'd probably come back if I was in the area, but I might try something new before sticking with Mikie's.
2009-08-30,2,Food took way too long and was served over cooked.  Service was decent. They took off $3 for the overcooked pork chop.  Seems like a slap in the face too me.  The "martini" was watered down.  The food was fair, this was a venture from our usual eateries in Hoboken.  Won't be returning.
2009-08-12,3,Went because it was SANGRIA SUNDAY! $10 pitchers!!! You say sangria, I say I'M THERE! hahaa.  Loved the Sangria!!! The spinach & artichoke dip was great but the chips were really salty.  I had a chicken ceasar salad because I wasn't really hungry.  It was good, nothing too special.  My friend had the tropical chicken sandwich, it was gone in an instant.  He loved it.  Service was kind of unfriendly though :-/Looking for great sangria? Then check it out..
2009-08-05,3,Have been here a couple of times. Decent bar and grill, and everyone at the table loved their food! They also have a good drinks list and some great beers (including my blueberry!) Service OK. We went for lunch the last time I was there and the chic was running around like a headless chicken and forgot a round of drinks at one point. In any case, I wouldn't not go back because of it. I imagine it gets crowded on weekend nights...
2009-07-31,4,they have these amazing fillet tips with some kind of green sauce which is my favorite appetizer! I didn't enjoy my meal as much. the grilled veggies in the Cynthia's on a diet salad had a funky taste. I ended up eating most of my bf's dish which was really good. I think his dish was the "drunken caveman" pork chops. I'm usually the designated driver so i haven't really tried their cocktails yet.
2009-05-04,3,The Husband and I visited Mikie Squared on a Friday night on a whim. We were in town visiting and the strip of Hoboken with restaurants and stores had been recommended by a coworker as a cute area to walk around. We ended up at Mikie Squared due mostly to a close parking spot and our being too lazy to walk very far. We were seated immediately and while the quarters are close, it is not stifling. They seemed to have a drink special for every day of the week and it looked like Ladies Night is every. single. night. We ordered some beers and nachos. I was pleasantly surprised by the nachos and our waiter was great at refilling our drinks with little to no prompting. This just seemed like a nice little neighborhood bar. I will say that if there is a Yankees game on and the guy who was sitting at the bar is there, you may want to leave. He is obnoxious. Especially if you tell him the Yankees are no good.
2008-11-20,5,I have been to Mikie's many times and have never been disappointed. Chef salad has the most amazing cilantro flavored dressing. I also think the Filet Mignon wrap is relly good too. My friend really liked the wings too and he is very picky about his wings.
2008-11-14,3,Mikie Squared is a bar similar to most of the other bars around Hoboken.  However, the food is better than most.  The massive menu offers a large variety of jazzed up American fare.  The interior dining area offers large booths and high tables, neighboring the lengthy bar.  The outdoor patio is a great place to enjoy a weekend brunch, which is what I was here for.  I ordered a large salad with grilled chicken and loved it.  The rest of my party also enjoyed their fresh omelets, juicy sandwiches, and more.  Our main complaint was the service.  The restaurant was decently crowded, but it took my party of 6 close to an hour to receive our basic dishes.  This is completely unacceptable, especially since 2 of the 6 were young children with very little patience.I would consider returning to Mikie Squared, hoping the service was a fluke, because the food really was decent.
2008-10-24,4,The brunch here is great!!! The Eggs Benedict and and Defibrilator omelette are da bomb!
2008-07-12,3,I would classify Mike Square as a fairly decent sports bar with better than average food.  I've had the buffalo chicken wrap and their cajun shrimp appetizer.  Again, the food was OK but this is more of a place to get your drink on during a Yanks or Giants game, because they've got plenty of flat screens all  over the bar.  I've also tried their sangria which is nice to have while sitting outside on a nice day.  There are so many sports bars in Hoboken, so I wouldn't put Mikes Square on top of your list, but it's worth stopping by for a few beers.
2007-10-03,4,AHhhh. Martini Mania Night. $5 Martinis all night.  It's a beautiful thing.Pleasantly surprised to find that it's not just good drinks.  I do mean good. If you're looking for a real martini, look no further.  The food here is solid and well prepared.  No waitstaff attitude and the menus are interesting, not just your typical bar fare. The burgers and the crab cakes are worth the trip as is the beer selection. Go for the 8:30pm Tuesday Trivia Night drink specials:1/2 price Well Drinks ALL night.$1 off all Domestic and Imported Draft beer$5 glasses of House WineI hear Brunch is worth a trip over. Happy Hour is one thing. I'm not too sure that a morning meal could get me out of NYC to NJ. If it ever does, I'll have to up this review to a full 5 stars. We'll see.
