2021-09-04,1,After 8 long hours waiting for my girlfriend to get out of work so we can drive 3 hours to LBI NJ, I got a Buffalo chicken wrap for the road because we were both hungry. They forgot the hot sauce on the Buffalo chicken wrap and the chicken was extremely dry with deli cheddar cheese. Extremely disappointed being a hoboken resident for many years. Whoever needs to hear this in upper management, buff chick needs to be breaded chicken with hot sauce drippin with ranch on the side.. would give 0/10 if I could. Understand it's Labor Day weekend but this place needs a revamp. Not returning again!
2021-08-02,5,Great old fashion deli in a nice neighborhood with lots of nice products in display and great sandwiches made with top of line Mozzarella & Italian Parma prosciutto.Bravo
2021-07-12,1,Do yourself a favor and skip this "Italian deli" if they're even allowed to call themselves that? I'm sure some people like old deli meat and frozen chicken cutlet but definitely not for me. There's 400 other places I'd rather eat!!!!!
2021-07-08,1,Terrible customer service! Ordered through Seamless and the order said it was delivered... but it never arrived. While I understand the restaurant cannot control 3rd parties, the restaurant's response to the issue was terrible. They said to call Seamless and would not call the driver themselves even though I asked ... they offered no other suggestions such as sending a new order through their own driver,  never apologized, etc. When I called back to inquire about options, they said 'we are about to close' and literally hung up on me towards of the conversation. Again, not the restaurant's fault for something on Seamless's end but still terrible customer service. Thankfully Seamless refunded it. I'm sure the food is good, but I'd rather support a local small business that isn't unnecessarily rude to customers.
2021-07-02,5,Lisas is always a reliable spot that I go to when I'm in the mood for a convenient delicious sandwich. I live around Lisa's so when its raining or super cold out, it's a no brainer to get a sandwich from Lisa's. They have a great variety and friendly staff working here as well! With so many fantastic delis in hoboken I truly believe you still will be leaving Lisa's very satisfied with your meal. And they accept credit!
2021-05-15,3,Food is good but service leaves a lot to be desired.  They take your order with a bit of an attitude every time and are not very helpful.  Not a good trait for a neighborhood deli.
2021-04-17,1,The bread is extremely hard, they gave me very little mayonnaise, and there was no great taste to the ingredients
2021-01-13,1,Really disappointing sandwich on my first trying here. When I think of a chicken arrabiata, I'm thinking breaded chicken cutlet with spicy peppers and maybe a bit of red sauce. This was grilled chicken, sweet peppers and fresh mozzarella (pretty dry). Just overall really disappointing, especially when there's so many better options at other deli's around.
2020-12-11,5,I've ordered lunch for pickup from Lisa's a few times during the pandemic since I've been working from home. I don't know why I haven't eaten here before! The food is delicious every time, it's always ready on time (even a little early) and the service is fast and courteous. All you could possibly want in a neighborhood deli. Last time I got an eggplant sandwich with fries it was so good! The bread was perfect and the sandwich was a perfect ratio of eggplant peppers a d onions. The fries were surprisingly good too! I'd definitely recommend stopping by here for a sandwich or salad
2020-11-01,2,Really wish we checked Yelp first. With places like Biancamanos and Vito's around the corner, really wish we did not waste our money here. We got a chicken, an eggplant and a prosciutto sandwich and nobody liked it. I woukd suggest skipping
2020-10-23,3,I typically love Lisa's sandwiches but I ordered a Tuscan Salad the other day and it came with iceberg lettuce instead of arugula (as advertised). Literally the worst substitute. Don't get a salad.
2020-10-18,5,Lisa's deli is a Hoboken classic. Old school place with amazing sandwiches and their MOZZARELLA. The mozz is so incredibly creamy and salty -- a bit expensive for a braid but totally worth it. Their sandwiches are delicious too, they used to make this lemon chicken cutlet sandwich with roasted peppers and mozz on crusty Italian bread, haven't had it in a minute but it was bomb. I don't know about their delivery, this is more of a spot you stop by irl.
2020-09-20,5,Ordered a New York panini with breaded chicken, balsamic, tomato, mozzarella & basil. Really fresh ingredients and friendly staff!
2020-08-13,1,Rude employees. Rude owner. Sub par food. Waited over 10 minutes with no line before an employee even acknowledged me and offered to take my order.
2020-08-02,4,I'm so fortunate to have this deli by me. It's just so good. Old school Italian deli with meats hanging... I go here all of the time but this review is just for the New York chicken sandwich. BOMB. I'd go back just for that sandwich. So. Freaking. Delicious. It's such a simple sandwich but for some reason it just left me so satisfied and happy. Wasn't even hungover or anything. It was just a great sandwich. Ugh I want it again!
2020-01-11,1,Do NOT order from this place! This is the second time we've had the same bad experience. The delivery service they use is horrible. We waited over an hour and a half for our food that we ordered at 11:30am on a Saturday morning. When I called, they said the delivery person had to make other stops and should be there very soon. 20 minutes later I called back and she says she knows the delivery service they use has had many complaints. The owner of Lisa's Deli is aware of these complaints yet they continue to use them. This is what the girl told me on the phone! Our food was cold and basically inedible. It's apparent to me the owner of Lisa's Deli doesn't care about delivering quality food and is just looking to make money. Worst food delivery experience!!!
2019-12-24,3,While visiting Hoboken, when I was strolling through the neighborhood around lunch time I ran across Lisa's and decided to stop in to pick up a sandwich. Like any good deli there are dozens of choices. I opted for a Reuben Pastrami. It was a good sandwich with an ample amount of pastrami and Swiss cheese on Italian bread, but it was not as "Reubenesque" as I thought it would be -- lacking kraut and Russian dressing. Still I enjoyed it and would order it again -- though I'll probably try some of my other favorite combinations first. I noticed a couple of vegetarian and vegan sandwiches too.Lisa's Deli also sells groceries such as pasta, Italian sauces, bread & rolls, and Italian meats and charcuterie. If I lived in the neighborhood I'd probably shop here on a regular basis -- as an occasional visitor I guess I'll be an occasional regular.
2019-11-19,1,I hadnt been to Lisa'a for quite a number of years and now i know why.  The service and unprofessionalism could be used to teach people what NOT to do.  I went in yesterday to order catering for 35 people and when i went to pay and handed them my credit card was told that there would be an additional charge of 4% which i thought was outrageous.  I figured they are either using that as a profit mechanism or dont want to report business.....so i told them i would pay cash.  Then i came in this morning to pay and confirmed they would be delivering and they said yes but when they rang me up i thought the value was higher then i was told yesterday and thats when the person at the register said..there is a 5% delivery fee...I said the person yesterday didnt tell me that when i asked if they can deliver and in her unprofessional tonality said "we dont have to tell you it is on the menu."  I said i felt when i asked about delivery yesterday and the person said yes they deliver she should have said yes we deliver and there is a delivery fee.....again her response was not I'm sorry she should have told you but instead she emphasized they dont have to tell me because it is written on the menu.......so I decided to pick it up myself. I  then wasn't surprised that nobody bothered to assist me in bringing it outside to my car.  I guess i should have known better and will go back to ordering from either Biancamano or Vitos where I am treated properly
2019-11-09,5,Came here on a quest to find a pesto caprese that would hit my dates craving for it. It definitely hit the spot. The deli guy was so nice and offered us all the options of what he cut put on it! The bread was perfectly crunchy yet soggy from the balsamic drizzle. The mozzarella was slightly melted and the peppers were delicious. The cashier lady was very friendly and gave us a student discount!
2019-10-22,4,Lisa's is a family run italian deli that offers a variety of different hot and cold sandwiches as well as pasta dishes. I've only been here for a  breakfast sandwich but I cant imagine how great the lunch and dinner options are.
2019-09-03,1,They arent that great like they used to be i just ordered two sammys and both of them lacked meAt the mozz tasted sour on the reg sandwich back them they would pile shaved ham but now the slices are think and a slice per bite i caught a tummy ache after i ate mines (i disnt finish it because mozz was sour ) definitely not stepping foot there again i used to love lisas deli but now its not the same horrible horrible horrible  never again
2019-08-08,1,This restaurant has very poor quality control and food prep practices.  The chicken parm sandwich I got was frozen on one side and undercooked on the other.  Immediately threw up from taking only a few bites.  Took the sandwich back to show them the uncooked and frozen chicken and they refused to apologise or refund me because I had taken two bites out of it.  Which is somewhat ridiculous, no?  I shouldn't be expected to inspect the food before taking a bite?  I was quite shocked by their customer service reaction.  Seperate to this incident, the food is generally all quite overpriced.  Furthermore, my friend had a similar problem with food he ordered from them being undercooked and said they were extremely rude to him when he queried them about it too.  There are so many good Italian Delis in Hoboken, it's a shame this one isn't up to par.  Since there are plenty of other great spots nearby, we won't ever be going back to this one!
2019-07-21,4,Great spot for a hoggie. Sandwiches are large a tasty. And service is always friendly. This is my go to spot to grab food for a picnic lunch down by the Hudson
2019-04-15,5,Popped in here for a sandwich the other night for dinner. The staff was super helpful - I didn't order a standard sandwich and made a few special requests which they were great to accommodate. A man came in while I was waiting and one of the staff helped him pick out some cheeses from the fridge. A great local spot that I will be happy to go back to!
2019-04-15,4,Pretty good Italian deli. Hopped in for a quick Italian combo. Great size and good taste for like $11
2019-03-23,4,Reviews here make this Lisa's sound not great, but I only have experienced good things in the handful of times I've come. Sandwiches are very solid and not too expensive. Workers have always been nice and respectful when I've been there. Know there's tough competition in Hoboken for deli and Italian sandwiches but definitely still think Lisa's is solid
2019-03-20,4,I order from Lisa's every Monday for lunch, always the same chicken cutlet sandwich with fresh mozzarella and arugula, and it's always delish! Comes very fast, ~20 mins, and the delivery man is always friendly. Would definitely recommend Lisa's to anyone!
2019-03-09,1,Ugh! GAG! This sandwich barely has anything in it! And it cost me $10! For just a basic sub!...ham, salami and cheese with lettuce, toms and onions. I had asked the guy for some extra toppings, but he was quoting me insane prices for them. Still, when I paid $10 for it, I thought he had added them. But nope! No extra toppings... that's the cost. When I called to clear things up, I had to call multiple times as they kept hanging up before I could talk. Christ, get rid of that girl at the counter. All she was doing was talking to her friend--didn't even look at me. From now on, I'll go back to Kings, where you get a nice thick sandwich with quality meats, amazing provolone and all the toppings you want for $7.99. Seriously, this sandwich is a total dud. They don't deserve to be in business, but as I was passing them, I stopped in. I'm so disgusted by it that I'm going to throw out the other half, and I never do that kind of thing. When Kings makes a better sandwich than a supposed Hoboken "legend," you know you're in trouble. TOTAL FAIL. DO NOT GO HERE.
2019-01-17,4,This review is for the mozzarella only.I popped in last Sunday to grab a ball of Lisa's fresh mozzarella. It was good! Seemed fresh, was creamy and great flavor and texture. It wasn't as good as some of the other places I've tried in Hoboken, but very solid. I
2018-12-28,2,Vodka sauce tastes like all cream, no tomato flavor...moz. sticks were not cooked and not worth it...basically frozen deep fried...sandwich, italian sub......not great... quality might be ok on certain things but terrible prep work...lack of flavor in everything we ordered....
2018-12-24,1,On December 17th, I placed a catering order for $246 worth of food trays, 4 trays to be exact, to be delivered to my office on December 19th at 11:30am and my office is only 1 mile away from Lisa's Deli Hoboken location.   On December 19th at 11:20am I received a call the food trays have arrived and to meet the driver in the lobby.  Two colleagues and I head to the lobby to meet the driver.  After waiting 10 minutes in the lobby we call Lisa's Deli to find out where the driver is.  The women who answered the phone (don't remember her name) said they use a third party service for their deliveries and they would need to contact them.  Keep in mind we need this food for a Noon event.  At 11:45am, I spoke to Mark of Lisa's Deli who  has been told by the delivery service there is construction outside our building and the delivery driver cannot leave the truck to bring the food into the lobby.  So my two colleagues and I walk outside to the curb to meet the driver.  As we walked from the lobby to the curb we passed two delivery service people from Park Cafe who like us were having no problem getting from the lobby to the curb.  Reaching the curb, there is no delivery service.  We then walked the entire perimeter of the building looking for this driver an he was no where to be found. I then started calling Lisa's Deli to see where the driver was, Again, but no one would pick up the phone!  Obviously they recognized the telephone number.....and you don't pick up the phone?  Knowing we need this food for an event at Noon!! After trying to call back Lisa's 5 times all the while walking around the building in the cold looking for this driver we had no choice at Noon to go back to our desks and call off the lunch event because we had no food.  At 12:05pm I get a call from the driver stating he couldn't get to the front of our building because of construction and the police.  Police?  We didn't see police.  And the other restaurants delivery service in the area were making their deliveries with no problem.  Now you may say this isn't Lisa's fault, it's the delivery services fault.  LISA'S HAD THE NERVE TO CHARGE US FOR THE FOOD!!!!!!   UNPROFESSIONAL TO SAY THE LEAST!!!!  They should charge the delivery service for the food!  Not us!  We made every attempt to help this driver make the delivery.   He was no where to be found for 40 minutes!  LISA'S DELI YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES FOR ACTING SO UNPROFESSIONAL.  Corporate Amex has taken the dispute and is crediting our account.  However, I felt the need to let everyone know that Lisa's Deli does this kind of business  and to save yourselves the headache of this type of service and go elsewhere!
2018-12-19,1,Lazy, dishonest, and don't give a damn about their customer.I recently ordered food from them, and not only did they forget a complete order item, they also failed to add their "famed" fresh mozzarella to a sandwich whose name starts with "Mozzarella".  When I called and asked them to credit the difference, the person on the line seemed annoyed and like they couldn't be bothered.  In any case, they said they would refund.  Spoiler alert: they never did.  I had to call GrubHub and get them to do it on my behalf.  Further to that, they told the GrubHub agent that the cost of mozzarella on a sandwich was a buck fifty when their app clearly charges $2.00 to add that cheese.  Look - I don't care about 50 cents.  What I do care about is the principle of it.  The meal was crap, we didn't get what we paid for, and we didn't even get refunded properly. They're clearly okay with charging a customer for their own errors.  As others have mentioned, they are rude and take zero accountability.  I get that mistakes happen and am more than willing to give people the benefit of the doubt.  I worked in the service industry for a decade, and am the kind of person who never sends food back at a restaurant and I very rarely tip below 20%.  Usually higher. The food is alright, I guess, if you are okay with spending money to *maybe* receive what you ordered (if you're lucky).  Good luck getting them to take accountability for any mistakes on their part - chances are, you'll end up paying extra and not even breaking even on what you receive vs. what you paid for.  I am never ordering from them again, and I would suggest anyone reading this find another sandwich place / Italian deli in hoboken - there are a lot with better food and service.  This dump does literally nothing good to justify choosing them.
2018-11-07,1,Do not eat at this restaurant they're very cheap with their food. I ordered a shrimp Parmesan dinner in old they sent me with three small shrimp for the whole dinner. Was very upset called the restaurant and all they told me they put three shrimp in the order that's all I get .
2018-11-05,1,Rudest people in Hoboken. Just walked it and was treated like garbage. Never stepping inside again after going there for years. The food is better elsewhere anyway. This place was just convenient
2018-08-17,5,Arguably the BEST MOZZARELLA IN HOBOKEN HANDS DOWN !!!! I always go with the Lunch special with a cold Red Gatorade. I never ordered from them online. I go in person and am treated very well. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS HISTORIC DELI!!!
2018-07-01,5,Foods great and reasonably priced for Hoboken. Hidden gem for breakfast. Nino is the man! Huge help and really nice guy.
2018-06-22,2,Not a bad deli but it pales in comparison to some it's stellar rivals in town (Vito's, Biancomano, & Frannie's). I've had their roast beef subs. Good but there is better in town.
2018-05-28,1,Service at this place is an absolute joke. I can't believe I allowed myself to go back there after I knew how incredibly slow the service was. All of the workers are either doing nothing or just solely focusing on online orders and therefore completely ignore the patrons in the store. If Lisa's wants to only service online orders they shouldn't allow people in their deli. Are they not embarrassed that there are 25 people working there none of which even acknowledge the people in line. Do they not care that several people walked out due to this unacceptable service ? GUESS NOT because they continue to do this time and time again. For comparison purposes, you could be in line at Fiore's around the block and still get your food before you would at Lisa's with just one person in front of you - not to mention you would also get much better food.
2018-05-16,4,Best sandwich shop in the 'boken!!  You have to wait because they make the food right there and the place is always slammed!  Know why?  Cause it's the best sandwich shop in Hoboken!  I'm giving it 4 stars because they scaled back on their grocery section which used to have some really good products to take home as well.
2018-05-11,2,I've had quite a few sandwiches from here over the years and they've always been pretty average. My order today was the last one I'll get. The prosciutto was dry and plasticy, like it had been sat out too long. The tomatoes in it were rock hard and mainly green. The only redeeming feature was the mutz, which was very good. There's way better deli's in Hoboken, go to Fran's Deli instead their mutz and prosciutto is amazing.
2018-04-23,2,I live one block away from Lisa's and have been going to years. However, over the last few years the service and food quality has gone downhill. I called them 4 times and no one ever picked up, so I went over and they said they didn't receive any calls. Overall, the service is mediocre at best and the food isn't much better.
2018-02-26,4,Pretty good deli and one of the larger menus you will find. However, due to the close proximity of some of the best delis I've ever been to Lisa's is probably 3rd to 4th best in Hoboken, but a top choice in most other areas.
2017-12-28,4,Stopped by here yesterday for the first time since I moved to Hoboken about a month ago. It was highly recommended to me by my real estate broker and it didn't disappoint. The fresh mozz was excellent, the breaded chicken cutlet was flavorful and the bread was delicious also! There was no line when I got there so I had my sandwich in hand within 5 minutes. The sandwich was a tad pricey ($9.10) its not gonna stop me from going again but was just caught off guard. All in all, very good and I'll continue to go here as long as I'm living on park avenue !
2017-12-10,1,I saw some reviews comparing this place to Fiore's. The only way this shit stain of a place should be in the same sentence as Fiore's is if the sentence "Lisa's Deli shouldn't be mentioned in the same sentence as Fiore's because Fiore's is great, and Lisa's sucks."Let me elaborate. The food is pretty good, but not great. And CERTAINLY not worth having to wait two hours for delivery. CERTAINLY not worth having to wait 45 minutes inside the store to get a sandwich because the people who work there are morons. CERTAINLY not worth dealing with unprofessional and rude behavior and attitude from them. You want good service and good food? Go somewhere else. Because this place sucks and they definitely don't deserve your business. There are plenty of really good delis and places to get lunch in town, check those out instead.
2017-11-29,5,Honestly, I've only been here once but I think about my sandwich almost every day.  We ordered for pick up online and then walked over to get the food which drastically reduced the waiting process.  I got the Original Jersey Style Hoagie Hero Boy (eggplant, mozzarella, prosciutto, arugula, tomato & balsamic) for $9 and it was 2 meals worth of food that of course I ate in one sitting because it was that good.The mozzarella was super fresh and while I have heard the wait times can be long an the food quality can be inconsistent, my experience was great and I will definitely be returning.
2017-10-29,1,This review is due to the horrendous customer service I received through their online delivery app. I ordered a delivery at 2:20 pm today and received a confirmation email.  Almost three hours later, I still have not received my order nor have I heard anything from Lisas.  I tried calling the deli and they are not answering the phone.  This horrible customer service is awful and they have lost a customer who had been ordering from them for over six years.
2017-10-07,4,My favorite place to get sandwiches in Hoboken. I know there's been an ongoing debate for some time regarding which Hoboken deli has the best mozzarella, I can assure you the mozzarella here is fantastic. They have a massive selection of sandwiches all of which are customizable, so there's bound to be something for everyone. Why did I only give it 4 stars? Two main reasons: price and speed. A single sandwich (large as they are) can cost almost $10, and for that price you'd expect fast service, but the chefs here take notably longer than average times to prepare the food. You can wait 10 minutes to get your food even if you're the only one there! Overall, the quality of the food compensates for most of these flaws. I go here a few times a month and I recommend it to anyone visiting Hoboken.
2017-10-05,3,I've been going here for years and have noticed there has been in a steady decline in quality and consistency. Sandwiches used to be huge and now they're mostly bread. The staff behind the counter is always friendly, but it seems to be taking longer then it used to for my order (probably because of all the seamless orders they get).I will continue to get my fresh mozzarella here, but will pass on the sandwiches from now on.
2017-08-16,5,Such a great old world store. Thank you Lisa's Deli
2017-08-08,4,Lived on the same block as Lisa's for 2 years and loved it. Always good yet sometimes inconsistent. I have had some of THE BEST sandwiches there and then the next week the sandwich would be just above average. That being said I have never had a bad meal from there. Plus the mutz is so good and fresh they take it right out of the water in front of you to cut you a piece any size you want. Prices are very fair and all the workers are unbelievably nice.I will admit the deli does get busy and can take a while so my review may be bias because I used to be able to order a sandwich and then go wait the 10 minutes back in my apartment. But a 10 minute wait is the standard for deli's in hoboken, Vtio's and Fiore's the wait is the same if not longer. I would always recommend Lisa's the prosciutto classic with mutz or the Italian Hero Boy with hot peppers to anybody looking for a good sandwich. Miss not living on that block anymore!
2017-04-24,1,The service here is awful. My wife called in her order about 1:15. We live 2 blocks away and stopped at CVS beforehand so probably got there around 1:35/40. She went to the cashier and said she placed an order. The girl walks in the back where there are 5 guys working and taking orders. She comes back without the sandwich. My wife looks at her and asks if it's ready and she said almost ready. I'm watching the guys in the back take new orders or finish the orders they already have. Three people since we walked in had ordered and received their subs. My wife asked how long and the girl says they made a mistake and gave the sandwich to someone else. She didn't say they're making it or how long. I'm looking and I see the guys working in the back take more orders. The cashier girl then walks back and puts up another order she took on the phone. She doesn't say anything to us as we're standing around. Another ten minutes go by and I ask my wife if she's said anything or if she wants to leave. My wife asks the girl is it almost ready and she doesn't say anything. We said cancel it we're not waiting any longer. She simply shrugs doesn't give a reply that it's almost done, never even check other than to go back and drop off the order she took on the phone. This was the first time we have been there in about a year. The last time we were there, we both ordered and they seemed to take forever, working on phone orders and not acknowledging us. This place is not worth it given the amount of better Italian delis in Hoboken. I highly recommend M&P Biancamanos, Vito's, Fiores', Lucas or even Blimpie over Lisa's.
2017-03-26,3,My favorite breakfast sandwich is Hoboken... BUT... you better have A LOT of patience if you want to order here! The kitchen at Lisa's has no concept of time. On weekends, the door and website say they open at 9 am... but good luck getting the cook on the premise before 9:30 am which means you won't get your food until close to 10 am. This hasn't happened to us once, not even twice, heck we might be at close to 5 times. Why do we go back? Because it's so tasty.  But someday we may stop trying. Oh and good luck ordering on the website.  They usually don't look at the print out until 30 minutes after its been received. Then they took my usual order off of their website even though its still on the menu in the restaurant.  So now we have to go in person, wait for the chef to show up, then maybe get the food around 10 am. I just wish they weren't so frustrating!!  We love their food so much.
2017-02-23,2,Cold cut sandwiches are fine. Got them many times, kinda very pricey. But only option so close to home. Ordered breaded chicken and eggplant Parmesan and got sick for days!!! Really sick
2017-01-23,2,Gave 3 stars last time but this time it was a 2 star meal. First off they barely put anything in our sandwiches. It was all bread and the bread wasnt even that good.  The chicken cutlet sub was just bland and all bread. We also tried the corned beef and that wasn't much better. Seems like the quality has gone down from the last time we ate here.
2017-01-13,1,I said hot corned beef with mozzarella with mustard.  I got corned beef and mustard.  $9 sandwich?  Not the first time they messed up an order, but the last time for me.
2017-01-09,1,I've tried to give this place too many chances. Today was it. Go to Vito's instead, super nice guys, their portions are huge and more importantly, the food is fresh and doesn't taste stale and bland. Too many options available in the area than deal with rude customer service and shitty service. Read some of the other reviews, seems I'm not the only one. And, yeah, you're going to end up waiting forever as they have no clue what's going on
2016-12-18,1,Well I have to say that the overall sandwiches and food here is great. There is no doubt about that. But the service is so pathetically slow that if you plan to get lunch you might as well cancel your plans for dinner because you will still be waiting for lunch..For a deli that has 6+ workers it is apparent that there is no leadership or assigned roles. Literally they are all running around the deli like chickens with their heads cut off. ZERO EFFICIENCY. Phones ringing and ringing no one answers .... you would think that maybe one person would be waiting for phone orders...Nope. At the end of the day I do like Lisa's but the level of aggravation that is involved when you go there doesn't make it worth while. The deli has so much potential but is archaic and more importantly the sandwich makers are at least 70 years old. All about employing the older generation but not in a fast paced environment that they can't keep up in... So I truly hope that the ownership cares enough to jump in to 2017 aiming to improve its service...
2016-12-17,1,Food is fine but delivery and customer service is terrible, they lie about the delivery time and that the food is out for delivery. Ordered at 1140 today, estimated delivery time was 30 mins....it arrived at 1:56. Spent 15 mins on hold trying to track down the order and they didnt even have the decency to pick up the phone again, had to hang up and call again. Wont be ordering from here again, hoboken has many other italian deli's... this one is over rated.
2016-11-21,5,also folks the San Francisco Chicken Panini was amazing, I love Lisa's!! From the chicken to the pesto spread, and yes the bread was perfectly toasted- 10/10!!
2016-11-09,1,Without a doubt the worse deli in Hoboken or New Jersey as far as customer service goes. Havent tried the food in years. The last time I walked in there was no other customers. I had to wait for the owner and his employees to turn around. I finally asked if this was a self service deli and was told by the Owner "Somebody will be with you."  After standing for 10 minutes watching the owner cut lettuce i finally walked out. He asked where I was going and I told him Vitos.If I am starving and havent eaten in weeks I will NEVER WASTE MY TIME OR MONEY at Lisa's Deli.  So many other great Deli's in Hoboken.  The Owner should just sell the place if he doesnt want to work at all and retire.
2016-10-09,1,Delivery came 1 hour past estimated 50 minute time frame. Nearly 2 hours for a breakfast sandwich. I called three times to try and cancel when it was approaching two hours because I had to leave my friend's house and no one picked up any of the times.
2016-09-15,5,Best Italian place in Hoboken period. I go here all the time! I get the prosciutto and mozzarella sandwich most of the time, their home made mozzarella is the best!
2016-08-03,3,Good local deli.  Definitely one of those "hole in the wall" local finds that you normally wouldn't know about unless you went off the beaten path (Washington).  It's small, and they don't stay open very late (particularly on weekends-I think they close at 6 or 7) so if that's what you're looking for on the weekend, just plan ahead (at least for dinner) to pick up early.  If you want fresh bread, they don't make it in house, but they get it from a great (I believe local) bakery.  The selection after work hours (late afternoon/early evening) is few and far between, so make sure you go for that early (they run out).  My go to items here are definitely the prosciutto, the ricotta, and the fresh mozzarella they make (it's the best and they let you taste it before you buy it if you want)!
2016-07-24,5,Tony, the owner is such an engaging, charming man and his sandwiches are the best!  He was the best part of the Mangia Hoboken tour by far. Grazie!
2016-07-16,2,Good cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches come lukewarm and it always closes at least a half hour before advertised. Vito's, Luca Brasi and now Tony Bologna are all better options.
2016-07-16,2,There is ZERO energy in this place.  The staff used to be much more customer focused and they hustled.   None of that now.  Only go there because they are close by.  And as I stated a while ago, the mozz isn't all that great anymore.   Something will give i'm sure.
2016-07-14,4,I would give this place 5 stars, I go there about once a week for a delicious salad but my experience tonight turned it into A 4. Tonight I went in around 830, no one greeted me for a good 5 minutes and wen they did they were expressly rude and seemed like I was ruining their night. The salad was deco erg not as good as usual and looked very thrown together. Then I asked for the bread that it says it comes with and he said " we are out" when I could clearly see bread rolls in the baskets. There is only 1 guy that has actually given me bread with my salad without me asking, he also makes the best salad and its consistent . I don't think ill be frequenting this place as much after the not so great salad, experience or customer service tonight. Very sad.
2016-06-12,1,Delivery was fast; I rarely have anything bad to say but the food is incredibly bland. Maybe I have to try something else next time. Pasta was over cooked. I was excited about the mozzarella from all the reviews, nothing special.
2016-05-30,1,Waited 15 minutes in line to then get yelled at by an old man behind the counter because I asked what type of bread they had- the three people behind me left as well since they were so appalled by how he treated me. The old man stated" if I didn't like it to bad", no one even apologized. The women is the front was no help as well. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE NOT EVER GOING BACK- food isn't fresh-no AC in the store- taking my business else where.. Owner should know the horrible staff he/she has..
2016-05-18,4,Depends what you're going for, the menu is very extensive and reasonably priced. Everything I've had is above average. Except for their break sandwiches. Best in Hoboken I think. Good coffee as well for only a $1.
2016-04-24,1,Took an hour an a half to get my food when I ordered from here.. On top of that they got my order wrong and it was cold by the time it got here. The only thing they got right was a side order of mushrooms but those mushrooms most definitely came straight out of a can. Coming from an Italian, this food sucks. Don't go here
2016-04-24,1,Over an hour to get my delivery and they didn't even get my order right. Food not even worth the wait. This place and its staff are terrible.
2016-04-18,1,My first day moving to Hoboken I figured I'd give this close by deli a chance. I decided to order food for everyone who had helped me move in. I was extremely surprised and disappointed by the quality and service Lisa's had to offer. More than half of our order (about 14 sandwiches total) were not what we ordered. I had put the order through online and figured that would be the easiest way to avoid confusion, clearly I was wrong. I had ordered a prosciutto and fresh mozzarella sandwich and got about 3 slices of meat, some mystery cheese, and arugula. It was probably one of the worst sandwiches I have ever had. When we went to pick up our order we had to wait because it wasn't ready for the scheduled time. Regardless of the timing being the restaurant's wrong doing, the women at the register were still extremely rude. I have yet to go back to this deli. There are some great Italian deli's in the area so I would definitely recommend passing this one by. Definitely do Vito's and you won't be disappointed!
2016-04-10,1,I was just told by the woman behind the counter to "shut up bitch" because they didn't deliver my soda.  Is that how you act to customers??? And I called to speak to a manager and ignored. Do not ever use this place.  If they owners are proud to treat their customers this way then shame on you.  Have manners. Gross.
2016-02-25,2,I've been to Lisa's deli a few times, the first two times it was great. Meat was fresh along with the bread. Next time I got delivery and it was the wrong order with one slice of meat. Thought to go back in for now on, picked up two ham sandwiches and the bread was rock hard! I called to ask about it and the women on the phone called me a liar. Won't be returning.
2016-02-18,5,Lisa's is my ultimate weekend indulgence.  I had the pleasure of living around the corner when I first moved to Hoboken, which is what led me to enter this odd looking corner deli.  Order this: brick oven bread (critical) with prosciutto, arugula, mozz, and pesto (or balsamic).  It is HUGE and so inexpensive.  And they are all very nice!  I also go there when I want to buy good fresh cheese - mozz or ricotta.  I don't think they make their own bagels but BEST BREAKFAST SANDWICHES IN HOBOKEN. Honestly I've never had a better BEC.  So. Much. Bacon.   Delivery service is also quick!
2016-02-09,4,I love this place. I have been ordering from them for the past few years one of my favorite items is there hot pepper shooters!!! delicioso
2016-02-04,4,Great mozzarella, often still warm and runny when you get it. Overall excellent Italian deli. Been going there for years and it never disappoints. Only suggestion is that when you order a sandwich, ask for it on real Italian bread (e.g. Antique Bakery, etc.) not simply sub bread.
2016-01-26,1,Ordered online. Got there and they had changed the menu a while ago and never updated it. Instead of calling me and asking if wanted something else they waited until I showed up, blamed me for not knowing they changed their menu, and didn't even apologize. Would never order again because of the laziness and rudeness.
2015-12-20,2,Lisa's makes a good sandwich so it's a shame that their customer service is terrible. Last time I ordered from here it took an hour and 15 mins to make two Italian subs. Today I called to place a pickup order and was told that they weren't taking any more orders. I asked why and was hung up on. My boyfriend called back and the phone rang for about a minute before someone picked up and then hung up without even saying anything. I'm not sure if they were closing or if they were just really busy, but either way a simple expanation to a customer who wants to buy from your business is not an unreasonable expectation.
2015-11-06,1,Would not recommend Lisa's. I ordered a roast beef sandwich with lettuce, tomato, onion, and hot peppers. After a 2 hour delivery, I got an Italian sub with no lettuce, tomato, or hot peppers. Go to Fiores, Vito's, or Fran's
2015-11-06,1,If you want to be completely inconvenienced, then you should absolutely order from Lisa's Italian Deli. Not only will they put you on hold for a total of 35 minutes (average on hold time each call was roughly 7 minutes accompanied by a lovely voice recording I can now recite in my sleep), they'll even accuse you of already receiving your food.  You got us Lisa's - we're just complete sociopaths who were calling you after we had eaten our paninis to see where they were.My final tip is that If your looking for an irrational and hangry fueled fight with your significant other, please order from Lisa's Italian Deli.  There will be quarrels over who should call back next and lively debates about if you think the paninis will ever be delivered (spoiler alert: they won't).All in all It was an amazing experience learning that a complex order of four paninis from an Italian deli could be so difficult.
2015-10-17,1,You guys need to change your posted hours. If you are open until 7 you shouldn't close your kitchen at 630. It's bad business.Your food is good, but customer service couldn't be more disappointing.
2015-09-28,2,WHERES THE TURKEY? Is the question I was asking after ordering a turkey sub.  It literally had 2 slices on each half of the sub, not what one expects from a Hoboken deli. With Hoboken prices btw.
2015-09-08,3,I had high hopes for my visit, even though it wasn't my first choice as most of the other deli's in town were closed because of the holiday (Labor Day). By the end of my meal, I began to think maybe I just ordered the wrong thing - the Original Italian Hero Boy. I'm a huge fan of the bread selection since it caters to a variety of preferences and indicates a high quality of freshness. There was only 1 layer of each meat, which was by far the most disappointing part since you can get a sandwich 3x the size for a comparable price at Vito's or M&P not too far. After all was said and done, and this is horrible to say, but it kind of reminded me of my last trip to Subway (light-years ago). The only glimmer of hope was when another patron sat at the small table across from me, with a chicken cutlet hero that seemed to be topped with broccoli, fresh mozzarella and maybe sundried tomatoes. Clearly I needed to stick with the grilled/breaded chicken sandwiches, so this was my mistake. That being said, if Lisa's stepped up their cold sandwich game, they could have a serious leg up on some of the other delis nearby just based on their extensive menu.
2015-08-31,1,I wish I could give -5 stars! Awful, AWFUL service and staff! Last Sunday, we came here around 6:10 pm (working hours said they were open until 7pm). When I tried to order my sandwich, the guy said they were no longer serving, cause they were about to close. Then I asked, but aren't you open until 7? So then he mumbled something in Spanish very rudely. Too bad I speak Spanish and I know what he called me. As I walked outside and while I was plotting with my partner where we should go next, I saw many other people go inside and come out very disappointed as well! If the working hours says the place is open until 7, why staff stop serving people at 6? Then shutdown your doors and finish business at 6! I really hope the owner and management see this post! Just take a look at your reviews here and see how many people have been mistreated by your staff! You have a great Deli, so don't let unhappy staff ruin your business!
2015-07-08,5,I've been a Lisa's customer for about 4 years now and I'm obsessed. I live in Hoboken which is packed with Italian delis that specialize in their own homemade mutz. Don't get me wrong, most of them are OUTSTANDING. I've been to the mutzfest a few times and I do love Vito's mutz but their sandwiches aren't as good as Lisa's. I do love m&p as well as fiores but their so old school (which is cool and authentic I get it) that they don't even have chicken cutlet and some other awesome Italian now-a-days specialties. Therefore, in my opinion as a foodie, Lisa's takes the cake in an all-around best Italian deli type of way. Their fresh mutz is made fresh daily and is the perfect amount of salty/milky. It's unreal. They also make the best chicken cutlet sandwich-- I've tried the same one at each of the Italian delis and Lisa's has perfected it better than the rest. The one I like isn't on the menu it's chicken cutlet, fresh mutz, roasted red peppers, either arugula or broccoli rabb (depending on preference), a little mayo & a little balsamic YUM. Specifically the woman Lisa who works there part-time has been more than helpful to me. She's very friendly and she helped me make my best friends surprise delivery dinner a success. I asked her to place a note in the delivery saying happy birthday and who it's from and she took the time to tape on a birthday candle to the note and my friend loved it!! It's the little something extra like that, that really makes a difference. PEOPLE DONT FORGET!! Thank you to the employee who's name happens to be Lisa and thank you Lisa's for your fabulous Mutz and chicken cutlet & turkey sandwiches these past 4 years!
2015-06-30,4,My last day visiting, I was brought to this little deli.... We don't have these down south really, I have never even seen anything like it All the meats looked SO good, and the imported cheeses were SO fresh!!!! I got to try REAL Prosciutto for the first time, and i LOVED it!!!I got a Caprese Salad... FRESH tomatoes, FRESH Mozz, Arugula, and Italian dressing- DELICIOUS!!!Doesnt really look like anything "special"... but go in and sit down and take a load off with one of the BEST sandwiches you'll ever eat anywhere!!!!If i ever go back to visit, this will be a daily stop for me :)
2015-05-14,2,I won't be brutally honest like I usually am, just understand that it takes A LOT to get me to sign in to Yelp.Lisa's a great person, but the rest of her staff is inept at speaking, cooking, and basic customer service.
2015-03-21,2,What the hell happened here? When I first moved to Hoboken 3 years ago this place fed me up to 4 times a week, as I was without a kitchen. I ordered through their website and the food would come within an hour.The last two times I ordered have been disastrous. The first time the food didn't arrive until after 2 hours, blaming their delivery service.That turned me off, but I tried again today. After an hour and 20 minutes I call to find out about my order. I was on hold for 12 minutes, I hang up and call back. They said they never got it. I received a confirmation email immediately after the order. Adding insult to injury the woman who answers the phone said they use a service and never sent along the order to them. Then silence. Me, "I guess you guys need to start using a different delivery service." Her reply, "Yep, sorry". CLICK end of call. No asking if I still wanted to make an order.It is too bad because their food is generally good, a solid 4 stars.
2015-03-19,3,This review pertains to the 'Hoboken Mozzarella Tour' I took last week!  This is not an official tour--just something I decided to embark upon during my visit up North.It is a comparison between 5 different Hoboken delis that make fresh mozzarella cheese.Growing up in Hoboken I feel like I know a few things:  Good pizza, good bagels, and the best mozzarella cheese on Planet Earth.I admit I was, and am, biased.  For the last 28 years I've gone primarily to Vito's Deli. It's always been my, and my mother's, favorite.This time around my boyfriend (who had never had any Hoboken mozzarella cheese before) and I decided it was time to put the cheese to the test.  I'm sure we missed a few places but we had limited time so we decided to try 5 of the highest rated, longest standing, and most renowned in town.My boyfriend never had fresh mozzarella before, so he didn't even recognize this as mozzarella cheese.  Of course I told him, 'this IS mozzarella cheese. Everything else you've had packaged to date is an imposter.'I think it's important to know exactly what you're tasting, so I recommend you taste the mozzarella in each location by itself PRIOR to/INSTEAD of just ordering it in a sandwich.  The taste by itself will really show you what the mozz is made of.Here's how the tour went and brief feedback for each location's mozzarella. My feedback and ratings (above) are solely based on the caliber/taste of mozzarella cheese, not the quality of everything else they sell or the service they provide.They are ALL in comparison to Vito's since that was my baseline.  Vito's is made fresh 4 times daily.  After tasting some of the best choices in Hoboken, I've come to the conclusion there is simply no better fresh mozzarella cheese in town than Vito's. Or anywhere in the world as far as I'm concerned. It's still my favorite. Stop 1: Vito's: Buttery, soft, warm, wet, salty, and literally melts in your mouth Stop 2: Biancamano: Great mozzarella taste overall, a little chewier than Vito's, nice amount of salt and a little wet from the brineStop 3: Lisa's: Great taste inside, but not salty with each bite on the outside.  Also a bit chewier than Vito's Stop 4: Fiore's: The saltiest of all 5 mozzarellas.  Also was the coolest (temperature-wise) and was slightly chewier than Lisa's and Biancamano 5: Luca Brasi: Coldest (temperature-wise) of them all, nice amount of salt, not too buttery however.  Unfortunately I found the texture to be more like cottage cheese once you start chewing it.*This exact review is posted across 4 different locations on my 'Hoboken Mozzarella Tour.'
2015-02-19,5,Lisa (who answers the phone) is the nicest woman alive. She is willing to assist you with anything that you need. Not only is the service amazing, but the sandwiches are the best in Hoboken.
2015-01-21,2,Disappointed to have to update my review but I feel like I need to share. I came in the other day for a sandwich and I was not happy with the product. The bread on my sandwich was so soggy, I almost didn't want to eat it. Also, it all and all just tasted very blain. The mozzarella cheese was not up to par. I still maintain one positive from my previous post, that the price is right. But to be honest, I'd rather pay more and have better quality. I'd still recommend to check it out though, since it seems to be hit or miss.
2015-01-05,4,I got half a pound of prosciutto for my wife's lasagna and some mozzarella ball salad. The in-person wait can be painful. The dude in front of me was an Italian from the motherland -- didn't speak English. That wasn't the problem... but he was getting his order for his big Italian holiday meal and it was taking forever. It seemed like a lot of the other guys were working on delivery orders? Anyway, it's nice having a place like this just a couple blocks from home. Just don't go during the lunch hour rush.
2015-01-02,4,Really fast delivery and really good sandwiches.  We've had the chicken parm, meatball parm, and hot roast beef, all delicious.  Love ordering from Lisa's!
2014-12-16,4,Great variety of simple dishes and standard deli fare with extremely fast delivery. Prosciutto and mozz sand which rivals Fiore's. Easy, quick, delicious.
2014-12-02,1,OMG ROACHES!!! WTF?!?!? I cannot tell you how many times I've eaten here and now I'm thoroughly disgusted and grossed out... ::wretch::Went in to order food... while I waited, a roach as big as a silver dollar slunk out from the glass display where they were grabbing the tuna fish salad from (for my sandwich) and creeped right back in to the display... IN BROAD DAYLIGHT!!! Uggggghhhh!!! You know the age old adage about roaches. "If you've seen one, you probably haven't seen them all."STAY AWAY!!! This place needs to be fumigated and checked out by the health department... oh g-d... please save me.
2014-10-26,3,I was between 2 and 3 stars but I went with 3 because the taste of the sandwich I got was decent and the portion was big but this place is weird. First I asked for a sandwich with eggplant and they looked at me like I was crazy and said they didn't have any. I never heard of an Italian deli that doesn't have eggplant but whatever. I then asked for capicola and the guy picks up a brownish purplish hock of meat. That was apparently their version of capicola so I switched to regular ham. I also ordered fresh moz, lettuce, tomato, and hot cherry peppers on it. The peppers they gave me were banana peppers and the lettuce was bright yellow and tasted like cabbage or something. The fresh moz was good but not good enough for me to ever go back.
2014-10-19,1,Ordered breakfast sandwiches for delivery over 90 minutes ago.  Still waiting.  Have called to follow up twice and the woman on the phone has no clue.  Such ridiculous service.  Never again.
2014-10-02,5,I have to update my review, their delivery service has gotten excellent.  fast, and they are friendly.Food is fantastic, and a great price.
2014-09-10,1,Never again!!Lisa's has been in Hoboken forever and is known as a "staple".....I've been going there since 2006Unfortunately their food has dramatically gone down hill and the service. I don't know why they think it's ok not to wear gloves when making sandwiches.  For the second time in a row, I have become sick within minutes from eating there (running to the bathroom)I feel like they're cutting corners and my stomach is feeling it.....never again Lisa'sWritten from the toilet bowl
2014-08-28,4,I have a not so secret love affair with authentic deli sandwiches and Lisa's really hit the spot. I had a simple turkey sub, and the meat was fresh, tasty and plentiful. My FI had a Chef salad which was also good. It does take a bit of time if you visit the actual location, but the sandwiches are worth the wait! I look forward to trying out some of their traditional Italian fare.
2014-08-08,5,Lisa's never fails us. Delicious sandwiches and specialty meats like porchetta available by the pound too. Mozzarella is terrific. I would argue it is the best in Hoboken. Very nice people working there too.
2014-07-09,4,Less is more at Lisa's, I find that the best items are the simple hot or cold sandwiches. Current favorite would have to be prosciutto, mozzarella, marinated red peppers, arugula, and a little balsamic on brick oven bread-so good. The service is very helpful, and very friendly, a rarity these days. Great mozzarella here too folks, plus in impressive stock of Italian specialty products. Unlike Fiore's, Lisa's is open til 9pm most evenings, accepts all major credit cards, and delivers (Seamless or call them). Sadly, no parking lot for those of you stopping in while driving.Top tip: Try the roast roast beef here, surprisingly good (but different from Fiore's). Pretty much any sandwich here with prosciutto is good.
2014-07-09,4,Work nearby so Lisa's is a weekly occurrence for me. Good food, have had a few things on the menu. Really love the mozz salad, super fresh. Also really love the pastrami rueben sandwhich with well done onions - SO GOOD! the best part about Lisa's is the girl in the front, Dana. She is always super friendly and makes the experience a good one! Overall will continue to be a customer!
2014-06-22,5,The best Italian deli in Hoboken/JC area in my opinion. Their homemade Italian sweet sausage is just addictive and so delicious. Like their fresh mozzarella hc hers and Italian cookies very much as well.
2014-05-12,5,Lisa's is my lunchtime staple. I order from them all the time on Seamless and the food arrives quickly with a smile. I pretty much always get the same thing - chicken monte cristo sandwich - but there are other incredible staples on the menu as well. It's certainly not the healthiest food, but it's damn good, and there's something to be said for the knowledgeable employees that have been there for ages. It's exactly the neighborhood sandwich shop everyone wants in their neighborhood.If you head into the shop, you're likely to get the same kind of service: you'll be greeted with a smile, polite conversation and quick service. It's a cool place to visit anyway just to check out the interesting groceries they have for sale. Definitely pop in and check it out. And definitely get the chicken monte cristo, I promise you will not be sorry.
2014-03-30,5,I love this place! It's seriously been my favorite hidden gem in Hoboken since I moved here 2.5 years ago.The portions are huge for the prices and everything I've eaten here has been incredibly tasty! They have a huge menu and ordering off their website is super simple and you can just pay online and pick it up. You can even select a time that you want to pick it up if you can't come right away, and they can deliver it, too.The people that work here are amazingly nice!!! Just perfect every time. I love everything about it. So much.
2014-03-13,4,The two women in the front are the nicest .  Lisa who probably gets asked if she is the Lisa.  Is not THE LISA.  With her Italian bursting personality and help with cheese info and cooking tips .  You would think she is THE LISA.  Dana is great ! I always see her smiling and is great with the customers!  I come here everyday!
2014-03-09,1,Don't ever order delivery from here. Regardless of quality of food it's unacceptable to wait two hours for delivery and then be told that it's on the way and on the second call told that they're not sure what's going on with the order or if it's gone out.
2014-02-06,3,Great sandwiches, terrible service.  I have ordered from here about 10 times, half the time the order is wrong.  The driver forgot the drinks, wrong chips, wrong bread, wrong dressing, etc.  When the order is correct, the sandwiches are very good.  Great sandwich, louse service.  maybe understaffed, takes forever to answer the phone, when she finally does she sounds very frazzled.
2014-02-04,4,Lisa's is my favorite Italian deli in the area.  Very friendly staff, delicious charcuterie, amazing mozzarella sandwiches and rice balls.  Also very reasonably priced.
2013-12-17,2,I was passing by and stopped in due to the rave reviews but was not impressed. The wait seemed rather pointless - as there were lots of staff who were busy preparing (I'm guessing) phone orders and neglecting customers in the shop. When finally I was asked what I wanted it was very brusquely, like the dude was annoyed with me. Service with a scowl. Sandwich was OK. Lettuce not very fresh.
2013-11-15,5,We loved the service here!  We ordered an italian sub , lisa "a" on the menu and the server asked if we wanted hot or sweet peppers.  The hubby said sweet and i said hot at the same time.   Without missing a beat, he said i'll do half and half ,.. Nice!  And he packaged them separately.   Then we kept saying oh, i want the artichokes, we want the salami sliced, etc, and he said sure!  So patient with me!The owner was in there tooI would say the only neg is don't get their cannoli. It's pre filled and it was soggyThe sandwich was delishWe walked all over Hoboken, checking out frank Sinatra's  birth place and walking along the hudson river. It was a beautiful day. Perfect weather.  We went to irish rep theater at night.
2013-10-05,5,I thought this place was great. I ordered cold cuts and some fresh mozz. I thought the prices were very reasonable and the mozz was amazing! If anything, too salty- but in no way bland. I'll be back here again.
2013-09-29,5,Lisa's mutz may be the best I've ever had!  I have no problem polishing off a pound of it because it's that good!!They also have great subs, incredible soppresata and hot pepper shooters.As for the people who work there, they are so friendly and help me with my stroller every time. Love this place!
2013-06-23,3,The food would get 4 stars but the service gets 0. They are so rude there when you order! They have such a bad attitude and always mess up orders. When you call to ask for it to be corrected, the woman who answers the phone says rude comments like "that's not what you said."
2013-06-21,1,Contrary to all of the ass kissing going on here in the other reviews, I have to throw this place under the bus. The service is flat out rude. Slower than a tired Sloth plus they fucked up my simple Veggie Wrap.When I mentioned they forget a few of the ingredients, they were PISSED at me for mentioning it and basically shoved a tiny plastic container at me with the guts of the wrap the impatient prick forgot. Please make sure you CAREFULLY inspect any cakes, pies,brownies, etc.. they USUALLY have mold on them. NOT joking.  The place it self is very enticing with lots of interesting foods, drinks, spreads and mystery meats from Italy, so I was prematurely blown away when we walked in. But the sweat DRIPPING off the chubby guy at the counter (probably landed in my wrap) made me flinch with fear as I ordered. NONE of the staff smiles or gives a shit what you are saying. Thing is, they receive so many ass-kissing reviews, and the fact they are there for 30 years, they feel they do not have to get your order right or smile. The Veggie wrap I ordered, by the way, was almost $8 and they didn't even get it right. It tasted like shit anyways and they Mozzarella everyone keeps raving about tasted like my fucking yoga mat. These people who are worshiping their nasty rubbery "home made" Mozzarella have clearly NEVER been to Italy. Fuck this place, I'd rather walk a block to Mr. Wraps, which is cheaper, friendlier and tastes better.   Va fan Culo Lisa's.
2013-05-19,4,A solid 4 stars and one of the few Italian Delis in Hoboken that are open long hours on a Sunday.. The place itself is sort of the exact opposite of Fiore's, where Fiore's has no menu and Lisa's never seems to end. When it's all said and done though I would say stick to the Italian classics, after all it's an Italian deli. For something like $8 bucks you can get the "Italian Boy" which is a monster of s sandwich with ham, salami, pepperoni, mutz and roasted peppers. What a lot of people don't know is they get bread delivered from bakeries all over Hoboken, you can actually choose which bread you want your sandwich on.I only come on Sundays and the line can get somewhat long but everyone in the place is friendly and it moves relatively fast.
2013-03-24,3,3.5 if I could.  Opened in 1971.  Being half Italian this was a great place to be.  I couldn't decide which of the amazing sandwiches I was going to get.  Wife was more interested in looking at the imported groceries and cheeses.  This is old school Italian Deli.  I was even there in time to see the mozzarella being made in the back.  They have online ordering and you receive 5% off your order.  They will deliver out of town.  The delivery charge for in town is $2 and out of town is $3.  We may have to try the delivery sometime soon.
2013-03-17,4,Sad to rate Lisa's so low. Have loved their food for months but had an awful experience there today. Ordered a small lunch order and it came with an error. I called to receive a refund for the error and was told with attitude that if I wanted to get my money back, the driver would have to come get the error. I said okay and waited for three hours. I called back to see where the driver was and was told that he already came to my apartment (not true) and talked to me (not true). I was then put on hold for 15 minutes and the person who answered the phone never came back. Disappointed. Will be finding a new sub shop due to this poor service.UPDATE: Owner got in touch with me and apologized, sent me free sandwich. I'm back on board.
2013-03-11,2,I've eaten here for years, and I honestly don't know why.  They are mediocre and the service really is incredibly slow (I still can't understand why it takes them so long to make sandwiches).First, don't ever order anything with grilled chicken; their grilled chicken is of such poor quality.  I can't tell if it's pre-frozen or if they really just don't take the time to trim the fat off of the chicken before they cook/serve it.  I've had several wraps/paninis where I've had to spit some bites out due to the chicken being fatty or just plain gross.Secondly, their menu is just a disaster.  They have 18,432 different versions of it and you never know what you're getting when you order.  I've learned this, so I've called to order and literally told them exactly what I want on the sandwich, and they STILL can't get it right.Their mozzarella is in fact fresh-tasting, and their bread is pretty good too.Overall, I'm over this place; I honestly don't know why they are still somewhat well known and popular.  It's probably pure convenience for those that live in that part of town.
2013-03-10,1,Awful customer service. I was in there at 550 - wanted to order a  $5 entree - but only had 5 so not enough to cover tax. She said no problem - they close at 7.  I call in my order at 630 only to be told they don't take orders anymore since they close at 7. Two issues.. Seeing as I was out on run with only $5   - good business would be to just give it to me.  Standard business would be to tell me what time I need to place an order.. Not when they close. That becomes irrelevant.Reading some food reviews.  This may have been for the best.
2013-02-20,3,Delivery review: Was on time and was definitely happy with their online ordering system!What I love about Lisa's: their variety of sandwich offerings blows any other deli in Hoboken outta the water. Like Chicken Sorento but, in a sandwich, cheesesteaks, wraps, mozz sandwiches, Italians, Hams, Turkey etc... Anything you could ever want you can find at Lisa's between two pieces of bread.What I really like about Lisa's: Their mutz is so fresh, cut so thick and is really damn good. Their sandwiches are MASSIVE and pretty inexpensive (around $8). These bad boys are definitely two meals worthy.What was ok about Lisa's: The quality of chicken and steak in our sandwiches. Definitely not the tops. My man went with the cheesesteak with sauce, and the steak was super chewy and tasteless. My chicken caprese sandwich was delicious, but the last half I had to take the chicken out - it took away from the sandwich. When I did that, the sandwich was really good with salty fresh mutz and the lemony taste of arugula with a balsalmic drizzle but, my sandwich was supposed to have chicken on it and I'm sad to say the chicken just wasn't quality obviously in my opinion.Overall, a solid spot for mutz on something. Maybe we ordered wrong, and some of their other items like chicken cutlet, eggplant, deli meats are legendary; I'm sure I'll be trying something again soon!
2013-02-18,3,Solid italian deli! I'm there fairly often but be forewarned.... If you go during peak hours or a Sunday morning you're going to be in for quite a wait. Luckily my line of work allows me to go in the off hours so I normally don't have a problem. They used to have my favorite breakfast sandwich on the menu, The Genoa Veggie, but it's been taken off. Solid hot and cold sandwiches. I like their mozzarella but I prefer M&P's style of frech mozz. I do love that they have Manhattan Special sodas though! Reminds me of my childhood.
2013-02-11,3,This Italian Deli is great. I stopped in as i was visiting a friend who knows his way around an Italian deli. We ordered a roast beef with asagio cheese, artichoke hearts, and some type of spread. We also picked up some spicy seasoned peppers to take home to snack on and add to a recipe we were making the next day. As soon as we got back to the house and dug into the roast beef sandwich I was in total bliss. The roast beef was so flavorful and tender the cheese, seasons, and artichoke topping definitely complimented the sandwich. My mouth wouldn't stop watering because it was so delicious. As I finished the sandwich I wish we had ordered two so I could have one for later. I will be sure to revisit Lisa's on my next visit and get my fill.
2013-02-08,4,This neighborhood gem is really good - one of the best sandwich spots in town!  I go there often on weekends, and love the Italian combo and Chicken Caprese.  All the ingredients - bread, meats, cheeses, roasted peppers, etc. - are great, and they combine to make delicious sandwiches.  LIsa's has a large menu with lots of choices, but I like those two so much I haven't had a chance to sample some of the other offerings.Lisa's is also a good (albeit small) Italian grocery, and you can get good ravioli, Italian cheeses and other items there at very fair prices.  All in all a great place!
2013-01-29,4,Lisa's would definitely get 5 stars if it wasn't for their paaaainfully slow service. The sandwiches here are definitely my favorite hot sandwiches Hoboken and their selection is amazing. I regularly walk 10 blocks out of my way and past plenty of other deli's just to enjoy a sandwich from here and I'm never disappointed. But definitely expect to wait a while as they prepare your food and you will be hungry surrounded all their hanging meats and goodies around the shop.
2013-01-15,5,Fresh, delicious and FAST delivery.  There's a promo code offered on their website if you order directly through them rather a third party website like seamless.  Best italian deli in Hoboken!
2013-01-12,2,this review is only based on breakfast so take that into consideration.i was looking for a good breakfast sandwich one morning after I had had a long night out drinking, and I came upon Lisa's....i walked in there, waited for what felt like an eternity for my order, and went back to my apartment to eat it. it was not what i wanted or expected, and the eggs were extremely overcooked. my boyfriend, who had gotten taylor ham egg and cheese, said the taylor ham was also very overcooked, and almost burnt. considering the amount of other italian delis in hoboken, i will not be giving Lisa's another try.
2013-01-06,3,The food is fantastic, but don't ever order delivery. We waited 45 minutes and then called, where we were put on hold for 5 minutes. I'm pretty sure that is when they made the order. Took another 15 minutes for the delivery guy to travel the 3 blocks to my apartment, and then he couldn't even climb the four flights of stairs to my apartment. Guess I'm gonna have to go wait in line at the store like always from now on.
2013-01-06,4,Picked up an order of different meats for Christmas (capicola, prosciutto, and hot & sweet sopressata) along with a big piece of mutz.  Everybody loved the selection and the meats and cheese are fresh as could be.  The guy at the counter was friendly and patient while I read off my order from several text messages.  It was Christmas eve and I just missed a big rush of people.  Will definitely be back soon.
2013-01-06,5,Just the smell of Lisa's when you walk through the door is worth the trip. It is truly a meat lover's dream with every Italian hero combination you can think of but with plenty of vegetarian options so don't rule it out if you don't eat meat. My husband gets the eggplant parm hero or a tuna salad sandwich and they have both been out of this world. All of the bread is fresh and the mozz is made right in front of you it's like you are being transported right into an old school Italian home, it's awesome to watch. The best part about Lisa's is that it is so affordable. For that quality food, you would expect wholefoods prices but its anything but. Such a gem in Hoboken, I'd recommend to anyone looking for great sandwiches side salads and cannoli's, they are my favorite!!
2013-01-03,4,Love Lisa's.realy italian sandwiches for cheap. Very fresh and good sizes!They also have other options like pasta and such but their italian subs are amazing!
2013-01-03,2,I ordered from this place twice for delivery. I heard really good things about their fresh mozzarella cheese and their pasta, so I figured, why not?!My meal did come on time, so that was a good thing. Everything else was TERRIBLE. Their fresh mozzarella cheese has like no flavor to it. If you want some good fresh mozz, I suggest Fiore's or Luca's. Also, do not EVER get pasta from this place. I had their rigatoni vodka TWICE and both times it was bland and tasteless. Vodka sauce should have a pink color to it - their vodka sauce was borderline light pink/white. Not to mention it had little to no flavor.I also ordered their pasta with spinach, tomatoes, garlic and mozzarella in it - COMPLETELY TASTELESS. I had to literally douse it in hot sauce to give it flavor.I would give this place one star, but I haven't tried their sandwiches yet, so I will save my full judgment until then.
2012-10-07,4,It's a solid deli that would be the best around in any town other than Hoboken. That said, the size of their menu is incredibly impressive and the food itself was pleasing. I ordered Lisa's Original Italian Hero Boy which is your standard Italian hero; however, the amount of meat in the sandwich was substantial and as a whole, it was very juicy.I definitely want to come back and try some of the delicious looking dried sausage hanging around the store.
2012-09-23,5,one of the best sandwiches Ive ever had! Chicken saltimbocca OH MAN. definitely going back
2012-06-12,5,Lisa's is one of the best delis in Hoboken. The quality of the cured meats and cheeses is excellent and the prices are reasonable too. From a loaf of bread to a Lisa's hero sandwich the place delivers on quality.We usually run in for a sandwich or get cured meats for appetizers. It's always been first rate. Ordering online is a snap and delivery has always been fast.I would highly recommend Lisa's.
2012-06-07,3,A-OK.  In most town's this place would be a superstar.  In Hoboken with all the amazing italian deli's, it falls a little short.It's the bread.  All my gripes are with the bread.  The meat and cheeses I've tried have been quite good.  But the bread!!!  It was a little flaky and dry, not really chewy like the better breads in town.  Changes the dynamic of the entire sandwich.  Now some people may like this type of bread better, so be sure to try this place b/c the meat is very good.... but alas, this is not the greatest sandwich in Hoboken.It's nice that they're open until 9PM many nights too, unlike some of the other deli's in town!
2012-05-05,3,This place is just that, A-ok.  Nothing more, nothing less.  There are better options for everything they offer else where in Hoboken.Their sandwiches are okay.  They tend to be on the smaller side compared to lots of other delis in hoboken such as Vito's, Biancamanos or Fiores. They do make their own mozzarella which is very good but there are better offerings in Hoboken.  The salads they have are very hit or miss.  It is a cool little corner shop though.  They offer fresh breads, imported Italian dried goods and some frozen pasta, etc.I like going in there and getting the old school Italian American guys speaking Italian to each other and if you catch the right crowd you may get offered a taste or two of the still warm, freshly made mozz.Maybe I'm being a little hard on Lisa's because we are spoiled in Hoboken with so many good options but you have to keep your game up to compete!
2012-05-02,4,Solid selection of sandwiches. We order from there often at work and they are extremely accommodating with the orders we give. The tools are soft, service is great and the sandwiches are made as if someone actually cares about the food.
2012-03-06,5,I want to have sex with the Mozzarella, Prosciutto and Basil sandwich here. It is divine. Thats about all I can say about that. The Mozz is the STAR.I am sometimes a creature of habit and always order the same thing here: The aforementioned samich. Be smart and call ahead. And yes they compete with Fiores on this one. Trust me.
2012-03-04,2,Great Mozzarella. Sandwiches are ok. Italian sub decent, but don't order a regular sandwich. Got a turkey sub once...came with 3 slices of turkey on it. Not even close to acceptable. Mozzarella is worth 4 stars, but the rest of it takes this place down to 2
2012-02-03,5,My Favorite Deli in Hoboken - Try the Lisa
2012-01-14,1,Lisa's. You did me dirty. We've ordered from you before and have enjoyed our sammys. But, we've also ordered from you before and received some serious 'tude from the girl that answers the phone. One time we received a horrifying response for asking for sandwiches within 20 minutes of closing time. Frustrating yes, but we could sort of understand, so we excused the awful customer service, ordered quick cold sandwiches and picked them up ASAP. We really enjoyed the food and low price, so we foolishly tried again tonight. This time we called Lisa's with a full 30 minutes to closing time. Well you'll never believed who answered the phone.  The same little $hit with not an ounce of tact or social skills. She immediately barked "What do you want? Are they hot sandwiches? You know we close soon?" Now I get it. I work in customer service and I hate answering the phone close to closing time, but guess what, I answer. And I even answer well after "closing time." We understand she's a child, but it's awful to have someone like that answering your phone, turning away business and pissing off local customers who will NEVER go back to Lisa's and will be damned to recommend you to anyone ever. It's a small town and a little goes a long way for business. Check out the customer service skills of some of your neighbors, Lisa's, (Mr Wraps, Mikies, Vitos) and you might learn a thing or two. Or just change your f-ing hours. Oh and tonight we enjoyed our sammys from Luca Brasi and the gem who handles their phone orders.
2012-01-09,5,If you want the best of the best freshest mozzarella around this is the place to go! They make fabulous sandwiches, great selection of italian meats, cheeses, pastas, olives etc etc!I had never been here, as I had always thought the signs on the outside are a little tacky/gaudy... the decor inside isn't that impressive either.... but once my boyfriend made me try a sandwich with proscuitto and mozzarella I was hooked! it was a big sandwich and I was surprised I ate the whole thing! I did not say one word until it was finished, needed some time alone to understand the exposion of delicious flavors. This place is better than some I have been to in Italy! A must try in Hoboken!
2012-01-01,1,Fifty minutes after placing an online order, I tried calling Lisa's at least 10 times to check on the status of my order, but nobody answered.  When I finally got a hold of someone, I was placed on hold while she went to check on my order. After waiting for about 10 minutes I finally hung up and tried calling back, but of course no answer.Eventually I got a call from Lisa's 1.5 hours after placing my order, but I told the person to cancel the delivery.  I was about to ask for a manager but the employee immediately hung up the phone.  I sent Lisa's Deli an email and tried calling back a little later to complain about the service, but nobody responded to my emails or phone calls.
2011-12-03,1,Their delivery service is horrible. I've ordered from them multiple times. On more than one occasion, the food took 1.5 hours to arrive, was cold, and was not what I ordered.
2011-11-30,2,This place could easily be so much better than what it is and that kind of makes me a little bit sad and also a tad bit offended. So far I've had their chicken parm sandwich and chicken saltimbocca sandwich.  I might be a little harsh when judging italian delis.  I'm born and bred North Jersey so I've experienced some top notch italian food.  My biggest gripe with Lisa's is that their bread is terrible. Its soft and doesn't really have any of the qualities that a true Italian loaf should have. I'm okay with soft bread sometimes but this actually reminds me of Blimpie.  Meanwhile, they sell local Hoboken bakery bread in the store.Their chicken parm was lame. Kind of tasted like chemicals. Then again I've had some slammin' chicken parm in my day.The chicken saltimboca sandwich (the actual chicken salimboca part) was delicious but the entire time I kept thinking about how fantastic it would have been if it wasn't on bread straight out the Blimpie ovens.  This place is really close to my apartment so I know I'll end up giving them more of my money in the future.  But I will ask them to put my sandwich on better bread because seriously that shit sucked.   TLDR: This is NJ, I promise you can find a deli a million times better than this without even trying. Bread is terrible. Chicken Saltimboca sandwich decent even with shitty bread. Chicken parm is lame.
2011-11-26,4,Purpose of visit: quick and inexpensive weekday lunch. Regular order is a chicken arrabiata sandwich. Grilled chicken with hot peppers and fresh mozzarella. Awesome sandwich. Big sandwich, perfect for two. fresh mozzarella is very good and the toasted rolls are baked daily.
2011-10-10,3,Lisa's is a pretty authentic little deli in Hoboken.  I picked up sandwiches yesterday to take up to apple picking.  When we got there, the sandwiches were good (but I still like Vito's better).  The salami and mozzarella sandwich was good but i felt sick afterwards.  I think it was the salami.  Regardless...i think there are other delis that are better in Hoboken.  However, i have to give it to Lisa's for their mozzarella, it's really soft and "tasteless" in a good way!
2011-09-11,3,Argh!   Lisa, Lisa, Lisa...Why do you do this to me??  Things are just not the same...I think we need to take a break.  We came by to order a few sandwiches to take to the beach over Labor Day weekend.  Three sandwiches took just shy of 20 minutes to make. We asked for no onions, they came with onions.  We asked for them to be cut in threes, they were cut in twos.  Not sure this was such a challenge when it was all written down but it was.  The sandwiches were still good but not really all that worth it.  And I'm still kind of annoyed that they bang you $3 for delivery.  With the plentiful amazing Italian delis in this town, I think I'll be checking out some others.
2011-07-15,5,The eggplant Parmesan sandwich and red potato salad are also excellent.  Five stars!
2011-06-12,2,I used to love Lisa's.  I craved their salami and mozzarella when I was pregnant.  I dreamt of it when I was no longer working in Hoboken.  Imagine my excitement at realizing that my new job was across the street!!!!  And then my disappointment when I realized that it has changed for the worse.  Sometimes I have no alternatives due to weather or time restrictions and I am almost always left feeling meh.  The people are amazing and I love the vibe of the place, with the meats and cheeses hanging from the ceiling.  But I just can't seem to get a sandwich or salad I like anymore.  Even when I think I am ordering one I like, they screw it up....adding something I did not ask for or want or omitting something crucial.  Sorry Lisa's, I wish I could write a better review.
2011-05-07,5,Great food, friendly people, great selection for Italian cooking
2011-03-30,4,Lisa's has just about every concoction of Italian sandwich/omelet/salad you can dream up! The mozzarella is pretty much to die for. Reasonable prices and deliciousness. Wish they had a sit-down restaurant just like it!
2011-02-26,4,Very good and fresh food. Imported cold cuts, fresh homemade mozzarella. Good meatballs and chicken parm. Good desserts, imported dry goods from Italy. Good breakfast sandwiches. NIce old fashioned Italian guys from the old country. Can be a little slow during lunch hour when all the construction guys come to get sandwiches but it's a small joint. Worth the wait. haven't been to Vito's yet because I just moved here but this place is among the best I've been to in NJ. I live near both but closer to Lisa's. So far I haven't had a reason to go anywhere else.
2011-01-22,4,Excellent home made Italian food. Their fresh Mozzarella is the best in Hoboken in my opinion. Consistently good and the food is always tasty. Only negative is that the wait for service can be long at busy times. Worth calling ahead for take out. Delicious paninis that are one of my favorite items on the takeout menu.
2011-01-07,2,I've been goign to Lisa's for the last 5 years its a great shop but recently I am a little skeeved out. I realize that this is inevitable but at Christmas time I noticed a small roach on the wall near the soppressata/hard salami and just last night I stopped in for some deli items and a beetle of some sort fell from the ceiling and landed on my bag. This leaves me to believe that Lisa's Deli is not the cleanest place to pick up food items. Sorry Lisa's but I think you just lost a customer.
2010-09-30,4,Great sandwiches and fast delivery. I'm visiting for the first time but will return here when I come back. If u haven't had the shooter stuffed peppers, they r a must for 3$.
2010-09-17,4,Now, THIS is an Italian Deli! However, parking isn't an option. If you go on a Sunday, go only AFTER the Giants game has started (you'll be stuck with a mad rush of tailgaters starting at 8:00 am until kickoff). Employees keep it real.
2010-06-16,5,Hoboken is the best place in the USA for a good italian hero.  Because of that, Lisa's is up against extremely tough competition w/ both Fiore's and Vito's in the same town.  This is my favorite go-to for everything... while it doesn't have Fiore's beat when it comes to Roast Beef & Mozzerella it does have them beat when it comes to Chicken Parmigiana Heros.  Just a ton of stuff on their menu, and if you ask me this seems to be the italian deli that is most overlooked in Hoboken.  Because of that, you're also going to find cheaper prices.
2010-04-14,4,Has a small town deli feel to it. Any of it's cold sandwiches with fresh mozz - YUM. The subs were enormous - I ended up only eating half for dinner and brought the other half to lunch for work.Definitely some place I stop into when I work late and am starving and wanting a quick satisfying meal. Now that's it's warmer out, I see myself grabbing a cold sub and heading over to the pier to lounge on a lazy day.
2010-03-31,3,The place is real old school inside and they have about  a million things on the menu.  While nothings to me truly stands out, it's great in a pinch and you're always going to get friendly service and top quality cold cuts or meats.  If this place was in a lot of other cities it would be a 5 star joint, but with the high level of Hoboken Deli's it's hard to give it 5 stars.I like the prosciutto on a hard roll with lettuce and oil and vinegar
2010-02-15,4,Went here the other day to grab food for lunch and the train ride home.  Got two sandwiches, one hot with roast beef, a little gravy, mozzarella, and sauteed onions; the other with hot soppresata, provolone, tomatoes, a little balsamic, and roasted red peppers.  Had a little problem communicating with the counter staff, but they were friendly enough and let me get a sample of the bresaola and mozzarella.  The mozzarella here didn't impress me that much, pretty good but far from the best.  Their bread on the other hand was perfect, not too dense not too light.  The roast beef sandwich was bursting with beefy flavor, and was incredible.  The soppresata was great too, although the soppresata itself could've had more flavor, but the roasted red peppers were excellent and the balsamic gave it a nice kick.  They put chunks of provolone on the sandwich instead of slices, but I just took a couple chunks off and the sandwich was fine.    Definitely a great sandwich shop, although I think they'd be much better if they had more guys like the owners (who care about what they do) working the counter.
2009-09-13,4,2nd best Italian deli in Hoboken after Fiore's. Was really impressed with their Chicken Pesto w/ Mozz on a whole wheat hero today. You don't get the whole wheat option much and the Mozz is second only to Fiore. Prices are impressive and the menu is the most extensive of all the Italian delis I've been in.
2009-08-08,3,The place has an old feel to it.  I wouldnt eat my food in there because its not very clean looking but the food is good.  I ordered a chicken ceasar salad and my cousin had a tuna sandwich. It was good for the price we paid.  We just wanted a quick and simple lunch to hold us over.
2009-07-19,4,The sandwiches there are good. But the fresh homemade mozarella is off the charts. Absolutely delicious. Never had a better one! Also the place looks like it's never been cleaned and I think I've seen a rodent once.
2009-02-24,4,Lisa's is a good alternative to Vito's if Vito's is closed or if you just want to switch it up. Good sandwiches, but go for the fried/crispy instead of grilled if youre getting a chicken sandwich. Other than that, call ahead and it'll be ready when you pick up.Also - I once ordered a large sub for a group event from Lisa's. It came out to almost half the price as other places, and was pretty good, so make sure to call and get a quote from here if you need catering
2009-02-05,4,Lisa's, my close-to-home deli will always hold a special place in my heart. While looking for apartments in Hoboken for the first time I stopped here and had a Meatball Parm. I have been in love ever since. Now, I will say there are definitely better deli's in town, but Lisa's has more choices than any other place. It was here that I first had a chicken cutlet and mozzarella on a roll. What a combo, and what an idiot I am for never thinking to try that sooner. Regardless, this place cares about each sandwich made and you could go here for a year straight and get something new each time. The only annoying part is that they give you a ticket where you order and then you have to go to a cashier on the other side of the store to actually pay. Doesn't make sense to me.
2008-12-29,3,I've only gotten sandwiches here but so far so good.A little bit on the slow side (I know what you're thinking, just call ahead!) but the convenient location more than makes up for it.Plenty to choose from and I havea  feeling I'm missing out by not checking out the hot dishes...stay tuned for the review on that!
2008-11-14,3,New Jersey Monthly named Lisa's one of the best Italian delis in the state, however, my friend and I enjoy Vito's on Washington St. much better.  Lisa's Deli is located in the middle of a residential area of Hoboken, making it a convenient spot for purchasing fresh mozzarella, large lunch sandwiches, and packaged Italian goods.  Their front patio offers a relaxing spot to enjoy a weekend lunch.  However, when I stopped in for a panini, I was not overly impressed.  The crisp bread was tasty, but the sandwich only had a thin layer of bland mozzarella cheese and a small piece of grilled chicken.  The mozzarella from Vito's is much fuller and sweeter.  They also offer a variety of spreads, breads, and toppings.  I would suggesting opting to go there instead.Lisa's service is also slow and not friendly.It is a decent option, but definitely not the best.
2008-10-26,4,Lisa offers a wide variety of sandwiches all made with fresh fresh bread and ingredients.  It's tough to say whether or not it's better than Vito's, but you can't go wrong either way.  It does appear to be less crowded than Vito's, but that's likely because it doesn't benefit from the foot traffic that Vito's receives by being on busy Washington street.
2008-08-09,4,Great sandwiches... awesome (and freshly made in front of you) mozzarella  cheese... great for taking a lunch out to go.
2007-04-12,5,A true classic. Very old-school - in a good way. I go there for groceries more than for the sandwiches and other deli items. They offer a great selection of imported and local Italian specialty ingredients. It saves me from having to schlep into Little Italy for my Italian stuff. They have some great prepared  foods as well. If I have company coming I usually swing by Lisa's to put together an appetizer platter. The sandwiches are excellent. A large quantity of top quality coldcuts and cheeses on a variety of fresh local breads.
2006-09-19,5,Lisa's is on the short list of the places I always make it back to whenever I return to NY for visits. I used to go several times a week when I lived in Hoboken. Need a sandwich to try? Go with ordering mozzarella on a soft roll w/ sundried tomatoes, romaine, oil/balsamic, oregano & pepper. Oh and maybe a slice of prosciutto on there.Don't forget the sides... stuffed peppers, red-skin potato salad, slaw. Everything is killer, everything is top-notch.
2006-08-23,4,This is the best Deli in the area... as long as you don't actually go inside.  The place is not very clean, but the food more than makes up for it.  My advice?  Order from delivery.com (or by phone).
