2021-11-08,2,I wanted to love this place, and I really hate writing a not-so-good review, but La Isla Uptown came up short on too many fronts.To give credit where it is due, I will start with the good. The decor and the vibes were great. Family photos, Cuba memorabilia, Celia Cruz all over the place, good music, all good things. It was buzzin for Saturday Brunch, also good. All the makings of what should be a great dining experience however...The not so good. First off the service, though friendly, was sporadic at best. I recognize the ongoing labor woes everywhere, but this was beyond. Ordering and arrival of drinks, food, and in between all took quite a long time. We waited well over 25 min for empanadas which were pre-prepared and already waiting in a hotbox on the bar to be put on a plate (I know because I was seated right next to it). When they finally did arrive, they were cold, tasty still, but cold. The remaining food was overall a mixed bag. Main courses for my table of three all came out at separate times, yet all three were separately cold. I had the pernil (pork) tacos which were ok, but a bit lacking in flavor, and you guessed it, cold. The others had brunch bowl and an egg dish respectively, both with similar issues. The unfortunate thing is, the side of moros y cristianos was flavorful and delicious, indicating the chef knows their stuff, so why the problems elsewhere?As I said before, I really wanted to love it...hoping we maybe came at an off time?
2021-10-24,5,Love the food and ambiance. The red sangria is incredible and knocks your socks off, so be careful how quickly you drink it! Love the flavorful churasaco and shrimp appetizer. Also incredible tuna tacos. Definitely go here!!!
2021-10-18,4,Came here with a friend to try out a restaurant. He's been here many times and is a regular and friends with the owner. I had never been here before but I had no issues with the food or the service. The bartender in particular was very friendly and nice and we did sit at the bar. The ambiance is very nice everything is very clean bathroom is clean. I definitely would come back if I was in the area.
2021-10-10,2,Came to this location for dessert and coffee. They did a great job with the place, it feels as if you are in a Cuban joint in Florida. The floors give the whole place a nice touch. Now when it comes to the desserts and the actual service they need to improve EVERYTHING! We got a table right away (Sunday night) it took the water about 20 mins to approach our table, we ordered the mango cheesecake and the coconut flan. The flan was alright, and the cheesecake was frozen so I barely touched it. We also ordered a Cuban late and never made its way to our table so we had to cancel it. They ended up not charging us for anything, which is NOT waist I wanted. Can't comment on the food, but on the service and the dessert alone I wouldn't go back to this location.
2021-10-03,4,Im not sure why all the bad reviews for thier food recently. I was here for the first time today and I thought my brunch tacos were really good. 2 tacos for $12 is expensive but each taco was piled high with meat. I had to use a fork at first! It had nice fresh mango on top too. Wait service was on the slow side. But we weren't in a rush so didn't mind us. Our waiter was really nice too. My friend got the bowl and it was also piled high with meat, rice, eggs and avocado. Pricey at $19 but it was a lot. Also can't beat $5 mimosas and bellinis. We sat outside and I did notice when I wiped up the water from my glass the napkin was brown and dirty. I think they need to clean the outdoor tables more. Inside looks super clean and pristine. And bathrooms were nice too. I would come back and try the empanadas which looked great.
2021-09-18,3,I had VERYYY HIGH expectations of this place.I saw it the night before of DDD and the way Guy was speaking about this place I thought, yes it will be amazing.But it wasn't the service was horrible, and the food we were served was cold. We got the papa rellena, with beef, empanadas, mojitos, bellinis, pork tacos, and porch chunks with rice and beans.The best part of this meal was the drinks. Because the service was HORRIBLE. She never came back, we had to chase her down. The tacos were plentiful. Will I be back, no, I'm all about service and attentiveness and I received none of that here
2021-09-16,1,Clearly service and cooking standards everywhere are just in the toilet but I refuse to lower my standards. Our server was initially friendly but when we had questions that's when things took a turn and we were ignored. No checking in on the food, no offer for more drinks, no refills on water and I'm sure our server had ZERO idea I speak Spanish so when he said to a co-worker "these people need to go they ask to many question"  I was flabbergasted. We also didn't enjoy another staff member whistling and clapping through the dining room right behind my wife's head as if no one was here. A few of the food items were greasy, over salted and just not that good. Bacaloa empanadas, Cuban rice, Flautas, and the tuna spring roll weCould've done without. Disappointed in this place but live and learn. First time and the last. This nonsense can only last so long before people who dine out 5-6x a week just stop going out and places run out of business Order takers with no patience or professionalism seems slowly becoming the norm while we as guests have to avoid micro aggressions and not show our discontent for fear of retribution in the kitchen, being ignored or both. Sad sad sad
2021-08-28,1,La isla uptown.  Food was good waitress was good. Hostess was a pompous ass. Crammed five of us around a table for four in the corner when the restaurant was practically empty even though I made a reservation. Had to complain twice to get her to move us. Never going back. I use to frequent the original restaurant on Washington back in the 90s. This place is just a bloated pompous poor excuse. No character. Never going back.
2021-08-18,1,The food portions were small and lacked flavor. The food was not the best and the customer service from our server Victor was terrible. He never came around to ask if anything was needed and at the end when the bill came, he said we couldn't split the bill and we should've said so at the beginning when normally all establishments can split the bill especially when it's not assumed that a party of 8 is being paid by one person. We believe this was done purposely to secure a higher tip instead of letting us individually choose our tip amounts for each plate. When we left the divided monies and paid card portion he ran outside and shouted out loud (in front of others) that we owed them $48. We had to go back in and realized the amount was only a $5 difference that was left on the tip amount that he had not charged. Not only was this embarrassing because of others making faces but also created a scene that took over 30 mins to deal with. We had a whole family day planned and this took too long that we had to rearrange our whole day. Would not and will never recommend this place to anyone.
2021-08-13,5,By far my favorite restaurant in Hoboken.  Very polite staff - Exceptional service - Delicious food.  I've never been disappointed. Varied selection of Cuban dishes.  And good selection of draft beers & drinks.
2021-07-28,5,I used to visit the Washington St location all the time and decided to set up a reservation at this location for a date. We arrived a few minutes before our afternoon reservation and were immediately sat down, since it wasn't too busy. The ambiance was great- beautiful decor and amazing music. To start, my boyfriend and I ordered Mojitos (Bacardi Limon, mint, simple syrup, fresh lime, club soda) in Coconut & Mango flavors. They were delicious yet still strong. Next time, I definitely want to try out their Pineapple Habenero Mojito! I also ordered the Vegan Empanada (curried cauliflower, potato and edamame beans with mango-pineapple chutney) and I highly recommend it as a starter! The empanada was perfectly warm & crispy with a nice comforting samosa-like filling. It paired beautifully with the side chutney and was a great way to start my lunch!If you eat meat, I recommend trying out the Papa Rellena (flash fried ground beef stuffed potato) as a starter because they're delicious. I used to love ordering one as a kid with a side of maduros from their other location. La Isla, however, also has amazing vegetarian & vegan options!! For our entrees, my boyfriend went with the Churrasco (grilled skirt steak, chimichurri) with white rice & black beans and I ordered a bunch of sides that consisted of arroz con gandules, black beans and maduros. Everything was flavorful, delicious and tasted homemade. My boyfriend enjoyed his steak and said it was cooked nicely and had a lot of flavor. After our entrees, we were too full to try anything else and were very satisfied with our lunch. The service at La Isla was also welcoming, quick and friendly- creating a truly great overall experience. If you are ever in the Hoboken area and are craving some amazing Cuban food, I'd definitely recommend La Isla as an excellent lunch/dinner option!
2021-07-18,3,Food was great. I got the pan con bistec. Only issue was the service. Spent 20 mins waiting for the waiter to come back with the check
2021-06-29,5,This is one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken! I came here over the weekend with my husband and it was just as delicious as always! We started with the Guacamole Caribeño, then I got the Pollo al Ajillo con Espinaca, while my husband got the Churrasco con Chimichurri, everything was very tasty. My husband had also ordered a soup and they forgot to bring it out so they gave it to us to go free of charge. The food and service were both excellent, looking forward to our next visit.
2021-06-26,4,Went here for a casual Friday night dinner date. The server asked if we had plans later or were in a rush. It's good that he asked because it ended up being a very long dinner. The food wasn't cold or anything! It was just slow moving. We were fine because we had no later plans but just be aware in case you're looking for a quick meal or have plans. The food was fantastic and I definitely need to go back to try more options on the cocktail menu. I recommend the tostones and Media Noche sandwich!
2021-05-25,4,Whatever you do please try the guacamole with pomegranate seeds. Unreal I cannot stop thinking about it. Giving 4 stars bc the service was not amazing but that's ok did not effect the food at all
2021-05-06,4,Food was so delicious! My friend and I ordered the octopus/shrimp appetizer and each got the steak salad. We also shared tostones and a chicken empanada. I would highly recommend everything we got!
2021-05-04,5,Best fried chicken sandwhich in the area. I went in for a Togo order but now but the decor makes me want to come back for brunch. The hostess was pleasant and it's location in Hoboken is fairly quiet.
2021-05-01,5,Great lively atmosphere with Latin music. It was nice to feel like we were in another country on vacation for the evening with the festive atmosphere. Our server was great. So friendly & attentive. Exceptional service despite it being a busy Friday night. Appetizer was guacamole to share. Good guacamole served with plantain chips & uniquely topped with chopped mango & pomegranate seeds. We were a party of 3 adults. Entrees were chicken chopped salad & 2 Churrasco. The Chicken Chopped salad was fresh & light. Abundance of chicken & such a large portion that 1/2 was taken home. Both orders of the Churrasco were cooked a perfect medium as ordered. The meat was juicy & flavorful. Side of black beans were some of the best I have ever had, again cooked perfectly & flavorful. Drinks ordered: pitcher of white sangria, coconut mojito & Pineapple Habanero Mojio. All of the drinks were flavorful & a nice compliment to the food. We were too full for dessert. We had an enjoyable evening & fantastic food / drinks.
2021-04-18,5,Went last night with my boyfriend for a sate night. We were seated quickly and appreciated how accommodating the host was with our seating arrangement. Our waiter Bryan was very welcoming, positive, helpful and provided great customer service. He answered any questions we had and took our orders quickly. He was very attentive and friendly. We had the red sangria pitcher which was worth it we recommend it for those that like sangria. The food was very delicious (we forgot to take pictures we ate it so quickly ) and the atmosphere was lovely. The art and the way this restaurant is decorated gave us a real Latin feel. They played good music and the lighting made it feel romantic. Bryan also talked about the dessert I picked out and it was just as delicious as he said it would be. If you are a chocolate lover try out the chocolate coconut lava cake it is amazing. We would definitely come again we had a great time. Thank you Bryan for your amazing service.
2021-04-03,5,What an experience! It was my first time trying Cuban cuisine and I'm glad I was able to try it here! I ordered the quesadilla con langosta and the empanada de carne! My friend had the Cuban empanada (can't remember the actual name on the menu T-T) and the glazed plantains (once again cant remember the actual name on the menu). Everything was so tasty and I wish I had ordered more to eat at home.... The staff were also super friendly and the time to get the food was reasonable! Would definitely recommend!
2021-03-23,5,I have been coming to La Isla for years and absolutely love it.  I've never been to their downtown location which I've heard great things about but know it's smaller and has that "hole in the wall" feeling that people really like. I've come here a lot but after having their latest vegan empanada I realized I needed to drop them a review and give them the credit they deserve. They change the empanadas seasonally (which is great, because it makes me feel like they are likely getting their food from real farms and not restaurant depot).... the only potential negative is that they may take this particular empanada off the menu one day which would break my heart --curried cauliflower, potato and edamame beans with mango-pineapple chutney. I am tempted to get like 20 for the freezer so I can pop them in the oven whenever I want. I honestly can't recommend this highly enough. We also got the BBQ Guava Wings. I'm not generally a big wing girl but the meat fell of the bone perfectly and the sauce was so good. We also got the Vuelve a La Isla (octopus, shrimp, pacific cocktail sauce, avocado, jalapeño, lime, orange, cilantro, fried plantains) - UNREAL.  Sensing our hunger, the waiter explained it might take a little while for this to come out since they make it fresh to order.  GOOD. I hate when restaurants pre-batch stuff like this. The flavor was perfect. There's a slight touch of sweetness, but not too much. It's just perfect. Another fav here are the shishito peppers (not your avg. shishito peppers). I always fall back on the La Isla Salad which is so so so good. Highly recommend. They have great service, wonderful ambiance, outdoor and indoor seating (very spread out, but not awkwardly so). Their cocktails & wine list are amazing too. I got the Miami Spice was delish.
2021-03-20,4,We stopped here after a terrible experience at another local restaurant for dessert.  We also had some empanadas and mojitos. The service here is always on point and the food quality is consistently good.  We came specifically for the tres leche, but it's no longer on the menu. We tried the key lime pie and flan. It was just as good as the tres leches we originally came for. Definitely check this place out.  Whether it's for appetizers and a few drinks, a full meal or just a dessert and espresso; you'll be happy you came here.
2021-03-20,5,This is the second time we have come here and it definitely won't be the last. After having a really disappointing dinner down the street we decided to come here for drinks and desert. The food is so good, really authentic, and super flavorful. I really love their empanadas, they are freshly made and are huge! It's a must get when going there. They have excellent sandwiches too! Their drinks are really tasty as well, we tried the pineapple habanero mojito, super delicious with a little kick.  Key lime pie is one of my favorites in the area! The service is also really great, super friendly staff and really attentive! Can't wait to get back here!!
2021-03-18,5,Excellent!!!!!First impression : Great... staff is extremely friendly and helpful.Drinks : drinks were great , I'm Brazilian and they make a real good caipirinha Food : food was excellent, I had the skirt steak with chimmichuri sauce and that was cooked to perfection .My boyfriend had the la Isla salad with skirt steak and it was so fancy , I loved the presentation. The bathroom: I always notice bathrooms when I go places because that shows me how the rest of the place is . And this bathroom is spotless clean . Overall an amazing experience with great food and friendly staff . HIGHLY RECOMMEND
2021-03-11,5,This is on of my fave Cuban spots to eat at. The food is good through and through and so flavorful. The staff are friendly and gave good recommendations. I ordered a papa relleno and it was huge and so good. The yuca fried in truffle oil were also super good. I wish the cheese on top was more of a melted dip. Something to think about for a menu addition lol. The oxtail stew was also sooo flavorful. The meat came right off the bone and the broth was great with the rice. I was there for my birthday and they brought out a chocolate lava cake and sang. So cute and it was good too. It had rich chocolate flavor.
2021-03-03,2,I came here last week survive was EXCELLENT! But the food was not. I was excited to try this location since the one downtown never disappoints. We order the ceviche- Tasted like Shrimp and Ketchup, the grilled peppers had absolutely no flavor, the steak was eatable but nothing great. I really wanted to live this place, but won't Be coming back. Not worth it
2021-02-21,3,I wanted to start of by saying that i normally don'tgive bad reviews but i wasLeft with no other choice. Being a small business owner i know the detrimental effect a bad review can be to a business. I wanted to email the owner instead of posting a bad review but couldn't find an email on their website. I should've given a1 star but decided to give 3 stars so their overall star rating wouldn't be adversely affected. We came here for my mother in law's birthday and what a mistake. We walked in andThe placeWas a ghost town. We asked for several things on the menu and the waitress told us that they were out of it. So we settled for ropa vieja, churrasco and pan con lechón. When the food arrived it was cold and bland. We didn't want to say anything to the waitress because we feltBad for her. Then we wanted to order dessert so we could sing Happy Birthday to my mother in law and they hardly had any desserts. So we skipped dessert had an espresso and asked for the check. Unfortunately i will not return here again. I may try their other location  which is hole in the wall but have heard wonderful reviews. This place definitely did not meet my expectations.
2021-01-31,5,Another delicious meal from La Isla!  The food is so fresh and delicious!  We tried the Taquitos de Atun appetizer and it was very tasty.  Then for our entree we had Pollo Asado with rice and beans.  Their roasted chicken has so much flavor.  Again, I highly recommend La Isla!
2020-12-30,5,Easily best Cuban food I've had since being in Miami, just amazing ugh where to start! The rice and beans cooked with smoked pork are too die for with the salty/fat + umami bomb that is just the perfect marriage. Always have to get sweet plantain or maduros and these were . Their Cuban rueben was highly recommended as the go to and that didn't disappoint either with corned beef and Swiss with short rib OMG just perfection! Can't wait to have again!
2020-12-19,5,Wonderful experience. We walked over during December snow COVID after an outdoor spot was just too cold for us. The owner/manager said there wasn't any tables but we could wait- gave us some champagne. We sat down, our waiter was so so nice. The food was unbelievable- ordered wings, empanadas, salad and chicken. Drinks were strong. Everything we needed on a cold night, we found our new spot!!! Check it out :)
2020-12-01,3,I used to always go to the downtown restaurant and I looooove their sandwiches. I'm not sure what happened but cubano and media noche were not pressed so they were just sort of fluffy. Maybe uptown location doesn't press their sandwiches but I didn't like them as much. And fried yuca as a side was so small and it was five bucks. I didn't think their side is that worth it.
2020-11-13,1,I actually live in the same building as La Isla uptown, and have given it a try MULTIPLE times...the service is consistently BAD, pre-COVID, and even more post-COVID.  I'm a softy about giving small biz owners a chance and helping them succeed, but these guys are consistently BAD!!  STAY AWAY and save your money!!  I've tried MULTIPLE times, and here are the three consistent themes: #1 - I walk in with ZERO line at the door...I'm first at the desk.  I wait ~10 min for a host (trying to be patient).  The host (pic attached) comes by finally, and completely dismisses me and goes to the guy behind me (who just walked in) and who apparently he was friends with, and seats him.   I interrupted saying I was first with a rez...and HE was annoyed!!  #2 - I place a pick-up order.  20 min later they cancel on me saying they were "too busy" and would refund (no joke - this was the language).  I still haven't received that refund.  #3: THIRD and final chance. I placed a pickup order of seven items. I showed up at the expected time...with the same guy (in the attached picture) who didn't acknowledge me for 10 min.  He seated another couple but still didn't ask if I needed help or if I was there for a rez or pick-up. I tried to catch him a few times for help, but no luck.   Finally, a sweet delivery guy told me they were backed up.  I was frustrated with the attached host, but appreciative that the delivery guy provided me with an update.  We were willing to wait, but when I got the food home (I live in the building), it was stone cold and AWFUL!I am all for giving people a chance during this pandemic, but I AM DONE WITH THIS AWFUL PLACE!  I gave three examples but it's happened over 10 times.  DONE with this place.j
2020-10-31,1,I am a fan of the food since the original La Isla downtown.  But today I had to leave a bad review because we made a reservation on OpenTable for 3:15 PM.,  we made it to the restaurant right on time and they said they were between brunch and dinner and would not be seating anyone else until 4.  We mentioned the reservation but this didn't matter to them.  Fix your reservations options online, and don't list times you do not expect to sit customers!
2020-10-30,5,La Isla is one of Hoboken's best lunch and dinner restaurants, hands down. Their sandwiches are amazing and excellent and worth having even for dinner (and they are still a lot of food). Their dinner entrees are usually excellent. Their sides -- esp. the maduros and the tostones -- are wonderful. The service can be a little slow, but the food is worth it. The atmosphere inside is a perfect facsimile of a Miami Cuban diner. Pre-pandemic, the place was almost always packed and lively. I await the return of that mode of life...
2020-10-14,5,The food here is amazing!  My boyfriend and I braved out first "dining out" experience since quarantine and all my of nerves about it faded soon as we got there.  It was a comfortable setting, spaced apart well, and everything and everyone was clean and following covid guidelines.  I had the montaditos which were a flavor combo I have never had before but completely delicious.  The lamb I had for a main was cooked perfectly and well seasoned and finished with flan.  All awesome.  I am also a fan of any place that has Trefethen by the glass.  Great wine list with lots of well priced wines and a GREAT BTG list.  Cocktails all looked delicious and creative, and I had their version of a mezcal margarita.  Really refreshing with just a little heat.  I took a cuban empanada home for breakfast the next day.  It didn't make it to the next day, I ate it that night.  A Cuban sandwich in an empanada is never a bad idea.  Can't wait to go for lunch next time I'm in NJ and have the actual Cuban sandwich which I hear is great.  I can only imagine it is.  10 out of 10
2020-10-10,1,Disappointing. Had a super sweet waiter but the kitchen refused to make a cheese quesadilla for our vegetarian member. There are 0 vegetarian options on the menu so assumed they would be able to make simple alterations, which they refused to accommodate so we left after appetizer. Waiter was really good though, can tell he was embarrassed. The manager came over to the table and did absolutely nothing to accommodate us.
2020-09-26,5,Food was delicious! Exceeded my expectations. Service was quick and friendly. For our drinks, we had our usual white sangria and it tasted better  than we've had at other places. We started with the Cubanada Empanada and my girlfriend got a Empanada de Carne, which had plenty amount of meat. Then for our entrees we both got Churrasco con Chimichurri but for sides I had yuca and maduros and my girlfriend had rice and beans. We both enjoyed it a lot. I'd say it was the best churrasco I had in my life. It was cooked to perfection with a slight kick. We couldn't end the dinner date without trying the dessert, especially since there was (arroz con leche) rice pudding on the specials menu. Its only fault was that there was not more on the plate. Would recommend this place! Drinks, appetizers, entrees, AND dessert was superb!
2020-09-26,5,Second time here and I loved it again!!Me and my boyfriend decided to visit La Isla, this being my second time and his first. We were quickly seated by a really nice and attentive waiter and given the option of indoor or outdoor beforehand, which was nice. For drinks we went with the half pitcher of white sangria and it was very tasty. We were starving so I got a Empanada de Carne (beef) 10/10 and he got a Cubanada Empanada (pulled pork, ham, swiss pickle, garlic mojo) 10/10. We definitely wanted to order more empanadas afterward!As for entrees, we both got the Churrasco con Chimichurri but my sides were rice and beans and his were yuca and maduros. We both really enjoyed our food. It was so flavorful and just the right quantity to fill us up. The dessert was only on the specials menu (could not find on main menu) and we loved it too. The price was also good for what we got. Would definitely go back for a third time!
2020-09-25,1,I have given this restaurant many chances but they disappoint every time. The food is mediocre at best. The worst part of it is the delivery. They underestimate the time needed to get delivery to you. Example...I live 1 block away and it took 2 hours to get my food on more than one occasion. Don't expect any help from senior staff there. They will blame you, charge you the same for 1 hour old fried food. The manager, Robert,  expected us to pay full price although we said we didn't want the food anymore due to their negligence...lying to us multiple times as to when the food would arrive. (They even said the person was in the elevator as we waited for an extra 20 minutesLiterally can't give this place anymore chances! Don't waste your time.
2020-09-17,4,I have only had take out. Every single thing I have tasted has been delicious. I would give it 5 stars... but I haven't experienced indoor dining yet, so I will update it then.
2020-09-16,4,I only tried one dish on the menu, but I have been dreaming about it every since. The Pan con Bistec with thinly-cut steak, lettuce, tomato, onions, and glorious potato sticks. The steak was so tender and seasoned perfectly. I wasn't even that hungry when I ordered it, but managed to (almost!) finish the whole thing. For $12, the portion is HUGE.In terms of ambiance, the inside is clean and chic with a lot of open space in the back room and by the bar. The staff was friendly and helpful in explaining any menu items we had questions about.I'm happy to see that they are offering outdoor dining. Hope to visit again soon!
2020-09-14,1,My family and I wanted to eat some Cuban food, so we end up here at La Isla Restaurant.  Honestly, it was a bad choice. My daughter and I decided to order the Paella. Horrible! the rice was not cooked at all. When I told my waitress about the rice, she told us that is because they use a type of rice (cannot remember the type of rice).  Honestly, rice is rice and this rice was not fully cooked.  Also, it was mushier (Wet) like asopao.  That is how it exactly looked like. Paellas are not asopao. My daughter was so hungry that she decided to eat at least the sea food.  I had to order something else. So, I order arrow con gandules (yellow rice with green pigeon) and oxtails.  The rice was good, but room temperature and the oxtails were COLD as hell.  I eat the rice and the yellow plantains.  My husband orders a Cuban sandwich which he only eat half a sandwich because the taste was blend and he did not like it at all.  My daughter partner food was the only dish that was good, and she did not have any complain.  She orders the white rice with black beans and shrimps.  We traveled from Westchester County for some good Cuban food just to end up here. What a waste of time and money.  I Will not recommend or visit this place again.  We were still hungry that we ended up in a Tavern a couple of blocks away for drinks and food.
2020-09-02,3,My wife & I went to La Isla last night and it was amazing - the service, the food, the prices! Fast forward one night & we decided to go back... wish we hadn't! Three stars is a combo of last night which was 5 stars and tonight which was 2 stars. I hate when waiters don't write anything down... a middle aged guy took our order and came out with drinks within minutes. Next the second round of appetizers maybe 20 - 30 minutes & the food wasn't hot. Then we waited close to an hour watching other tables who came after us get their food!' I was getting pissed! I would have left if it hadn't been for the fact I was so hungry! I finally barked at the waiter and said did you put in my order because it's been an hour. 15 or so minutes later the food came out - it was good, but no where near as good as last night. It would have been a nice gesture to offer us a glass of wine, or dessert... nope. If you are looking for inconsistent food, aren't hungry, and you have nothing but time on your hands this may be a good place to check out.
2020-08-31,4,I visited the La Isla uptown location for dinner Friday night - first time since their outdoor dining started.  We were able to get a table for 2 at 7:15 pm with no wait.  Luckily the table had an umbrella since it did rain for a short while we were there.  I've had brunch at the uptown location a few times but never dinner.  To start, we shared a papa rellena, the black bean hummus with plantain chips and the crab cakes.  Everything was tasty and they did a good job of spreading out the dishes like I requested.  The plantain chips also came in handy to eat the crab cakes which were served over a corn salsa.   To drink, I ordered the Pineapple Habanero Mojito, extra spicy.   Drink was tasty and the bartender did a good job to add an extra kick.  Unfortunately the bartender didn't make it the same when we ordered our second round and it was much sweeter.   For our main, we shared the Pargo al Caribe dish - snapper, with mussels and shrimp in a coconut cream sauce.  While the menu fails to indicate 'no sides' like some of the other ones do, the server said that meal doesn't include sides like main of the other entrees (they should update their menu).  The dish was very tasty and a big portion.  We ended the meal with the mango cheesecake - very yummy and rich.   Was a pleasant and filling meal.  Our main server was a little spacey and not always attentive, but luckily the runner helped bridge the gap.
2020-08-28,1,I should have walked to shop rite and picked up a frozen dinner. The idea that I called after an hour and a half, was told I'd get a call back (never did) and then finally got ice cold food after two hours is disappointing. Rice and fried food took 2 hours....
2020-08-23,5,I loved my experience here!We were in the area and Pier 13 didn't open up til later since it was supposed to rain so we decided to have lunch. We stumbled upon La Isla and had an overall wonderful time. I decided to go simple and just order the roasted chicken lunch special. It came with a choice of two sides and I got boiled yuca and beans. Everything was so flavorful especially the yuca. The yuca was well flavored with a garlic sauce that tied everything together. I probably could've eaten a plate of just the yuca alone. The chicken was perfectly moist and seasoned, which is a good indicator of how good the restaurant is.My friends also ordered black bean hummus with plantain chips and a cuban sandwich which they enjoyed as well. The server was very attentive and pleasant.Everything was bursting with flavor-- can't wait to revisit again!
2020-08-22,5,La Isla is a small spot but the food makes a HUGE statement! The food is delicious, unfortunately we could not enjoy the inside due to COVID but the outdoor dining was decent,  the street was clean and this restaurant is so pet friendly which I love. Will come back again once this COVID  has gone away to enjoy the full experience.
2020-07-25,5,This was my first time (but not my husband's) eating food from here...and through UberEats.  It took almost 1 hour, which included the 30+ minute delivery to Edgewater.  The food was pretty warm still so we didn't need to reheat or anything.  FRESH.  DELICIOUS. Well packed.  We ordered the churrasco with arroz moro (Cuban black beans and rice) and yuca (boiled cassava), rabo encendido (stewed oxtail) with rice and frijoles negros (black beans), a platano relleno (bacon wrapped sweet plantain stuffed with Manchego cheese and spinach) and a large side of arroz con gandules (rice with pigeon peas).  WORTH THE WAIT.  The churrasco- with or without the chimichurri is one of the best we've eaten (and we've had quite a few).  The churrasco had great flavor and was cooked perfectly.  Arroz moro= perfect texture, on point flavor.  Yuca= perfectly cooked, delicious garlicky sauce that has a touch of acidity to balance the flavor.  Rabo= big hearty oxtail chunks, tender, delicious and full of flavor.  Frijoles negros= cooked so well they had a creamy mouth feel.   The platano relleno= explosive flavors between the salty/smoky bacon and the sweet maduro and then the creamy/salty Manchego cheese and then some heat/a definite kick with an almost chorizo type of flavor to it.  The only thing that was maddening was my husband telling me after the fact that La Isla is known for their empanadas de carne, which I didn't order (note for next time)!  The food was so delicious that it was worth waiting for the delivery, and so good that my husband said he'd eat the churrasco cold (he doesn't eat cold food).  Friends of ours love to eat there and they come from Teaneck.  A coworker of my husband's who grew up near the Little Havana section of Miami said this is the only restaurant in NJ he's found that has authentic Cuban flavor like what you get in Little Havana.  He even learned Spanish just to ensure he orders correctly and he's a regular at La Isla.  THAT good (food and portion sizes). I would post photos but all we have left are empty dishes!
2020-06-25,2,Ordered takeout from the restaurant and went back to pick up at the time they said it would be ready.  Ended up waiting for another 15 minutes and came home only to find items missing.  Be aware and examine your food is all there before you leave.  Poor service
2020-06-07,1,absolutely unacceptable!!!!!!asked for a salmon to go and a bistek de palomilla (which is beef)........instead i get what they call a "bistek of chicken"......(which is chicken)....never ever ever again!i wish i could put 0 stars on this review!
2020-05-10,2,Cold dinner, wrong order, took 2 hours. Promised refund never got it. This place has gone so down hill.
2020-04-25,2,I am a big supporter of patronizing small businesses during this pandemic. I have ordered takeout once a week at this establishment. Today when I picked up my order the woman behind the counter accused me of being rude to her and went off on a temper tantrum. I just wanted my food that I paid for!!! I am an ER nurse in a hot zone hospital in Bergen County and the last thing I need on my one day off is a unprofessional person greeting people. The food is good but I will support other restaurants.
2020-04-17,5,Honestly.. this food is LIFE. I enjoyed my order so much, and la isla threw in an extra tres leches because of a mistake, where my roommate ordered and I ordered not long after, so they thought it had been delivered. The food is amazing!!!
2020-03-30,5,My husband and I needed something delicious to brighten up our self quarantine... La Isla did the trick! Of course I would  love to be sitting in the restaurant enjoying a Mojito and  listening to Latin music as I await my dinner... but I'm in my pajamas - with my own so- so mojito mix BUT the food.... excellent!!We had empanadas, Yuca, pork chops , rice and beans and a Cuban sandwich. The flavors were spot on, food was cooked  to perfection and for a moment I almost forgot what we are all actually dealing with. This to shall pass and I will be back in La Isla Uptown with bells  on! Support local Businesses if you can! You won't regret it!
2020-03-11,3,Honestly, the food was DELICIOUS! I got the chicken with the garlic cream sauce and a side of rice and beans. Absolutely loved it and I have leftovers for tomorrow! However, the service was horrible. We waited almost an hour for our appetizer and didn't even put in our dinner order. The waiter was all over the place and never came to check on us. They also charged us for an extra side of rice AFTER being here for almost 2.5 hours. Just wish the service was better :/
2020-03-02,4,Went for LunchFood - 5/5. Cuban Reuben was fantastic. The corned beef added a firm, salty flavor while the short ribs complimented that with a tender, savory bite. Bread was crusty yet soft, pickles and mustard added a good piquant kick and the cheese gave it that hint of mellowness. Excellent sandwich!Service - 3/5. Service was a bit slow and I was not a fan of our waiter's scoffing at my questions about sides replying that "This is Hoboken". The tone might been intended to be lighter but at the moment it felt abrupt and rude.Value - 4/5. The sandwich is fantastic but a bit pricey at $12 for its size and lack of sides. At that price for lunch, I do not think expecting a small side is unheard of. Every item being a la carte is not inherently bad but a sandwich that comes with zero sides makes you feel a way.Parking - Street (Metered)
2020-02-24,4,Being from Miami , I have a soft spot for Cuban food and this certainly hits it. First off ; the decor is perfect: not too casual , not to fancy with the Cuban style bar wrapping around the dinning area m. The menu has all the classics and although I've had many, you can't go wrong with the basics . This time, I had the breakfast sandwich on multigrain ( not very Cuban like haha ) and my friend had the Cuban Rubin . No doubt hers was much better but we shared the Yuca Frita which was very good . Combined with cafe con leche we were happy campers .
2020-02-23,5,La Isla service is not consistent, but the food has been for us. Regardless if you are going in the am for their breakfast sandwich, which is spot on or their criollo shrimp for lunch or their garlic chicken for dinner. This is definitely one of few places where we hardly have any leftovers for it is that good! Just please work on the customer service!
2020-02-16,5,I'm not a food critic by any means however I'm sitting at la Isla right now dying to tell someone how AMAZING my food dish was but I couldn't cuase I'm here alone but wow! I had ropa vieja which is shredded steak with black rice and yuca.im Puerto Rican, and why I say that is because Cuba's OWN yuca The texture how soft it is with the garlic sauce the Butter the salt everything and I can't make it as good as a Cuban can they definitely nailed it here so if you want a delicious yuca or cassava as soon call it come here for it! It was not disappoint you. Tag me message me comment if your coming here becuase of my review!
2020-02-14,1,Booked a table and got confirmation. They cancelled my reservation without calling! I have no voicemail either.Luckily called them prior to leaving, totally unprofessional
2020-02-04,5,The service was incredible by Carlos C and the food was amazing !! Fantastic lunch and dessert  !!
2020-01-19,4,Ambience and food are great. Staff is very friendly and it's a very kid friendly place. Came here twice for the Sunday brunch around 9am. The place was more than half empty and still service was  very slow....would give it a 5 stars otherwise.
2020-01-18,5,Absolutely loved this place.  We came here for our anniversary dinner.  The drinks were great and food was amazing - it also had a fun vibe.  I can't wait to come back and try brunch!!
2020-01-02,3,I love Cuban food,  but I thought La Isla was just ok.For the positives,  the restaurant has a cool vibe, the service was friendly, and they have a good wine list with a range of prices. The churrasco with chimichurri my friend ordered was excellent. The steak was perfectly cooked and the sauce and onions on top were a great addition. Most dinner entrees come with two sides, and I enjoyed both the moro and the maduros. My paella however, was disappointing, and way too salty. The portion was generous with lots of mussels and clams (less shrimp and calamari) but I left a lot of it because of how salty it was. For dessert, I also thought the tres leches was disappointing. It was dry and not worth the calories!
2019-12-17,5,Awesome El Cubano pressed sandwich. Great service at the bar. One of my favorite places in Hoboken.
2019-12-11,4,Cute little spot for Sunday brunch. Came when I was a bit hungover from a night out with friends. I needed to have a lighter meal because I was a bit nauseous but still needed to eat...the omelet was a good choice for that. It was perfectly cooked and had plenty of cheese. I chose ham, smoked gouda and mushrooms.The stuffed french toast is pretty famous and damn delicious - it has strawberry guava cream cheese filling. My other friend had the brunch bowl - beef and rice with a variety of toppings, also a solid choice. Would like to come back when I don't have to be careful about what I eat!
2019-12-03,1,Staff: cold, remote and act like they are doing you a favor serving you. Service: Slow. It took ages for a simple brunch order to come and then the drinks arrived 15 minutes later. Truly awful.Food: Bad. Tastes like something thrown together with cheap supermarket ingredients. You could make better yourself at home for a fraction of the cost.This place is bad. Avoid it. The got just about everything wrong and created a truly dreadful brunch experience.
2019-11-26,4,Nice restaurant in uptown hoboken. Hard to get a table without rservations. Food is tasty and service is above average. Decor and music are very good and add to ambience of the restaurant. Tends to be extremely noisy however and makes it a little difficult to have conversations.
2019-11-25,5,Definitely the best Cuban food I ever had. The service was really nice and the atmosphere perfect. The menu was very diverse and everybody had something good to choose from. Just a really nice experience. I'd highly recommend it.
2019-11-11,2,What happened to this place??? I don't live nearby so I don't go very often but every time I've gone the food, drinks and service were all really good. Just went this past Friday for lunch and the food was awful and the service was even worse. The real crime food-wise was the ajillo sauce. It was in our mussels appetizer as well as someone's shrimp main course and in both is was very strange. It was super milky which I've never seen in an ajillo sauce before. There was no garlic taste but tons of garlic smell...almost like from garlic powder? It was like eating seafood in half and half that's how white and milky it was. Then the desserts were abysmal. The flan was so over cooked it was like a tough omelet and the tres leches tasted stale. On top of this the waiter was pretty rude and did not pay much attention to our table. I would assume maybe it was just a bad day for the place but other reviews seem to attest to similar experiences.
2019-10-25,4,I love authentic Cuban food and I recently moved to the area and have been in search of such a place and found it. The food options are wonderful, the cocktail specials are amazing, the overall aesthetics and atmosphere is warm, colorful and like walking into little Havana. The waiters were attentive and nice, and if you're looking for classic Cuban food for brunch, lunch or dinner, La Isla got you covered.
2019-10-23,1,Was very disappointed today. This was our first time back after having horrible service a few months ago and swearing we'd never eat here again.  We decided to give it another chance. The service this time was even worse. Was there for lunch and waited 15 mins for our order to be taken after no waiter came by to greet us. We both ordered a soup and sandwich. After 20 mins, the waiter brought our sandwiches and informed us the soup was still not prepared and would not be ready for another 10 mins. He asked us if we still wanted the soup. You'd think it would have been better if he told us after ordering that the soup wasn't prepared yet and see if we wanted to change our order. On top of that, the manager decided to sit at the table next to us to conduct an interview with somebody  applying  for a position in the kitchen. There were empty tables everywhere, so why conduct an interview next to us? It's really a shame because the food is good. Service and management have always been the problem here.
2019-10-16,5,We are visiting from California and we're just walking around Hoboken when we decided to ask someone where a good happy hour would be. She suggest La Isla and it goes till 7.  We head over there and to our surprise, they did have an amazing happy hour! We had planned on one drink but the bartender was so amazing and we had some great conversations. That one drink turned into 5. Joel (I think it was. Guy with braids in a ponytail) was amazing. We loved talking to him and sharing California trip advice while he also told us some NJ NY advice. We went back the next night for dinner because he said the food was also bomb. We weren't very hungry the first night there. He was right! I had the bistec (my Cuban food go to) and Dan had a crab cake sandwich. Both were so good! Our server, again, was amazing! Wasn't the same guy but was still friendly and welcoming. If we lived here, this would be our spot. Hands down. The service alone would keep us coming back. If you like garlic, ask for some mojo sauce!
2019-09-30,3,My rating is 2.5, this restaurant is not kid friendly, they only make chicken tenders on Sunday, and the rice was grainy tasted like saffron or out of a box. The music was modern and the decor was nice, traditional and fun.Maybe I'll have better luck ordering a sandwich next time.
2019-09-22,4,An absolute wonderful gem on 12th Street, La Isla, Uptown will now be my go to brunch spot when in Hoboken; however. I'm eager to try their dinner too.We arrived around 1:30 and the interior was festive, warm and welcoming. It also helped that select brunch cocktails were $5 (only Mimosa, Bellini and Bloody Mary). We started with the Bellini (choice of peach, mango or passion fruit) but I swore it tasted like a Mimosa. I observed the champagne to be a bit warm but overall it was still good. I tried the mango and passion fruit. There was lots to choose from in terms of food from the menu and I felt stuck trying to decide. From salads and sandwiches to eggs and griddle mains, La Isla's menu had something for everyone.We both chose the build your own 3 egg omelet accompanied by home fries and toast or Cuban bread (choose the latter as it is a pressed bread served warm and so delicious).There was a good selection of fillings and I created mine to include onions, Manchego Cheese and wild mushrooms. In addition, I asked if I would be able to substitute salad for the home fries. No problem. Done.When the omelet arrived, it was a proper and very large 3 egg omelet stuffed with the fillings. And the side salad was more like a mini main salad. Definitely the way to go over choosing the home fries. The omelet was very, very delicious, prepared just right---fluffy, tasty and satisfying (only $11).We really enjoyed our visit and meal at La Isla and intend on returning. Service was on point (never an empty water glass), food--delicious and atmosphere was charming.Try it. You'll be hooked.
2019-09-21,5,We had a great time today.  We were a table of 6 and we were seated right away for dinner at 5:30pm.  We all enjoyed our meals!  I had the crab cake sandwich and the irish coffee beer.  Delicious!
2019-09-10,3,I so much loved this place, always clean, with nice atmosphere and really delicious food, I've been coming here for about 3 years. But last couple times I was really disappointed by service and also drinks! What happened? You hired new servers and a bartender?Please pay more attention to your clients! During my last visit the server messed up with my order,even if I pointed it with my finger in the menu.He offered to change for the right dish and it was nice, they took the wrong dish away, and brought the right one in 10 minutes , but then in the bill I found out they included both items.  After a minute of arguing they removed the wrong item. Drinks (cocktails) also were disaster, and before I always loved them. This time they tasted watery and just boring!The server came to us really rarely, he didn't bring us napkins, I asked twice. They didn't clean table when we finished eating, no one just showed up for like 20 minutes! I wanted to have a desert but lost the mood for that, we asked for check and waited again for 20 minutes. I started just walking around and asking other workers to give the check so we can go...I don't know, it's just weird and never happened to me at this restaurant for 3 years! And the most unpleasant thing was,  I've recommended Oa Isla to my friends and they also were surprised how bad service was and told me that today! I felt embarrassed because I believed I sent them to one of the best Cuban restaurants in Hoboken. They also mentioned that food is good, and I agree! but service is also important!
2019-09-09,5,We're engaged!!My fiance proposed on a walk by the water in Hoboken and had a few of our family members and friends waiting at La Isla afterwards.  We had a great table in the back of the restaurant and a fantastic time overall.Two things (besides the celebration part!) made this visit stand out:-Awesome food-Amazing serviceEveryone who came is still raving about the delicious meal we had here.  Each dish was presented beautifully, but more importantly tasted great!  Timing was on point throughout the afternoon - everyone was served each course relatively near each other so there was no waiting around.  And our waitstaff was fantastic, especially our head waitress who was super personable and made sure everyone was taken care of.  My mother even coerced her into jumping into our group pictures because everyone liked her so much!Thank you La Isla for being an awesome part of a day we will never forget.  We used to visit the downtown location when we first started dating, so adding this to our story is a really special memory.
2019-09-04,5,Like walking into little Havana in Florida or of Cuba back in the day. The people are super friendly, the food even better. Doesn't matter what you decided to go for or what your in the mood for, they have it. I am sure they have a Cuban grandma back there cooking !!!!
2019-08-25,4,I have eaten at this restaurant many times with my family and friends and the food is delicious and not that expensive. I would recommend the chicken special which is offered once a week but you have to get their earlier in the evening because they run out of chicken because of the high demand.
2019-08-14,5,Love this place. Delicious food, great vibe and an awesome staff! Can't wait to go again when I am back in town.
2019-08-01,5,Authentic Cuban food. Their happy hour menu is a real bargain.  Great spot for casual dinner.
2019-07-26,4,Great service, we really liked our waiter. Food was delicious except the rice had some hard parts of rice bundles other than that flavorful and fun. Would recommend and go back! Pineapple mojito was awesome!
2019-07-17,4,Our first time there for breakfast, really enjoyed it.  Busy but still comfortable on a summer Sunday.  Mojito was delish.  They were out of breakfast bowls, not sure how that can happen.  But the Breakfast burrito was pressed with a slightly crispy exterior.  Very nice.  Kids burger was really just a slider.  Not worth it.  Looking forward to trying more of the sandwiches next time.
2019-07-14,5,Visiting La Isla was the highlight of my week. I was there for a family celebration, so had the opportunity to taste many of their dishes. Everything I tried was exquisite. The presentation and taste of plate far exceeded my expectations.Our waitress was accommodating and very bubbly. She was quick to serve and refill drinks, and checked in frequently to make certain all of our dining needs were met! La Isla had such a homey feel and we did not at all feel rushed to leave after dessert. The Cuban atmosphere and menu made me want to order in Español! Though this restaurant is a hike from Philly, I will definitely be visiting again soon. ¡Hasta pronto, La Isla!
2019-07-10,4,An upscale version of downtown location original one.  The food is not as good as the original location though.
2019-07-05,4,Ended up at this location after a day out with friends and was not disappointed! We were able to make a reservation while out at Pier 13 and got a table for 10 within an hour and fifteen so not all too bad. Very cool location, decor, and ambiance were all very authentic and gave a very Cuban feel. I definitely enjoyed that aspect. We ordered a few pitchers of Sangria which was one of the aspects I did not enjoy about La Isla. The flavor from pitcher to pitcher varied pretty greatly. While mine tasted like cold red wine, others' drinks were entirely too sweet. We wished there was more consistency in the flavor of these drinks. We ordered various apps which everyone enjoyed very much. I ordered the bistec con pollo which had lots of onions and was very flavorful. I was already a bit full at this point but it made for great leftovers. Would like to return as a date night and try out some different items!
2019-06-14,2,Really disappointed with our meal here last night.  We ordered the special seafood skewer for $15.  There were two tiny shrimp and a charred piece of octopus.  I was really excited to order the whole fish special, but the waiter said they dont have it now, but it the fish may arrive in 60 to 75 minutes.  We decided to order the half chicken special instead, but they came out lukewarm and almost as if they were reheated.  Very disappointed.
2019-06-14,2,My husband and i went to dinner last night.  We recently had drinks in the bar area and noticed the "whole fish" that is on the regular menu come out. It looked great so even after a bad experience a few months ago, we decided to try it again.  We were seated immediately and ordered the special appetizer. (shrimp, chorizo and octopus kabobs).  i ordered the special chicken, and my husband ordered the whole fish.  The waiter told us that the whole fish would likely take over 30 minutes because they had no fish and it was on its way to the restaurant (it was only 7:00 pm).  We looked confused, then he said, "oh, it can be an hour, or maybe an hour and half."  My husband changed his order to chicken as well. Our appetizer came out - with no chorizo, way overcooked octopus, and 3 tiny , overcooked shrimp. Almost unedible. In the end, the waiter took this off of the bill for us.  A positive.  When we got our main chicken dishes, it was dry, and almost cold.  In any event, we will not be returning. Sadly disappointing.
2019-06-04,5,Cuban sandwich are to die for as well as other dishes.   The food is always fresh and never tastes old or processed.
2019-05-20,1,This review is for the restaurant "delivery service" not from an actual visit to this location.   On Sunday, May 19 at 630pm I placed an order using Yelp|Grub Hub for dinner.  Two entrees and two appetizers.  At 633pm, received notification that the order would arrive within 40-50 minutes.  At 620pn, checked an update on the order and was told between 640pm-8pm.  At 805 called Grub Hub direct and after being in hold, was informed the food was still at the restaurant and the updated time would be 825pm.   While I think the food is good - even when items have been overlooked on past orders - I gave this location another try and was disappointed.    I cancelled the order and made Trader Joe's frozen potato pancakes.   Less expensive, much less hassle and was on the table in 15 minutes.  La Isla - there are too many places to dine in HBKN and I will not be offering you another chance.   Let the diner beware.
2019-05-04,1,If you're looking for a stressful, unsatisfying dinner, come here. This restaurant is all over the place and has potential, but is a consistent let down.First- the specials are never available Second- the restaurant has the endless "diner vibe"- bright lights and apathetic serviceThird- literally something will always go wrongOne example: arrived at 6:30pm on a Saturday night, waiter seemed friendly. Gave dinner orders. Appetizer came. No server. Dinner arrived. No server. The server forgotten one of our appetizers, and had never returned to our table!! We finally realized our server had become the bartender (even though the bar was fully staffed).. We were stuck looking for other servers to help and get us the check and had to triple check the charges. Btw the fried yucca was the only thing slightly satisfactory. Whatever you order don't expect to receive it. Most terrible unromantic experience ever.
2019-04-28,3,Came here on Easter Sunday with no problems making last minute reservations for dinner. Parking is a bit terrible, but if you park in a lot next door, the restaurant will validate the parking ticketI absolutely LOVED the decor inside. The tiling on the floor gave the place a cultural vibe and the light fixtures and art work gave the place a modern feel. As you walk in, the bar on the left extends to the back of the restaurant with tables on the right hand side by the window, perfect for people watching. Around the bar sits more tables (usually perfect for two), giving the restaurant an L shaped finish. Coming here in a large group isn't recommended since it could get a bit crowded, but a group of four would be ideal. On to the food! My husband and I shared the seafood paella and chicken empanadas. The empanadas weren't exactly my favorite because I'm usually not a fan of the large and thick crust with dry chicken inside...I've had a fair share of empanadas and I've just never been a fan of empanadas bigger than the size of my palm. In my biased opinion, these were ok. Ordering one would be enough for two people to share because they are really filling and again, bigger than what I would've liked. The seafood paella came with a pretty decent amount of seafood. At first, it looked like soup since the presentation had all the seafood on top with the sauce covering the rice, but after mixing it all together, it was pretty decent. The rice soaking in the sauce really gave the dish the flavor and the seafood on top was more than enough to share between two people. I almost didn't really mind the rice being soaked up like that, but it sort of looked more like a risotto. Our waiter was friendly but not as attentive for a non busy evening. We got our food out at a decent amount of time and he probably came back once after that to check on us. Our waters needed to be refilled and it took a while for someone(not our waiter)  to get the check processed.Truthfully I gave this place a three star because there really wasn't anything spectacular about the food. It's Cuban inspired cuisine and nothing about the place, people, or the food really stood out for me. Others may think different and it is a good place to try in Hoboken. I wasn't crazy about it but it had good food, atmosphere, and good staff.
2019-04-20,4,Definitely one of the best Spanish places in uptown Hoboken. I normally get delivery and have sat inside once. They usually are pretty long at delivery times but worth the wait. Tostones are my favorite appetizers and normally try something new on the menu each time. I haven't ever been disappointed.
2019-04-13,5,Carlos the bartender is THE BOMB every single time! His drinks are amazing my favorite is the coconut Mojito his are theee best. Customer service A1, great conversation and prompt service! Thank you Carlos. The food is absolutely delicious. Love this place my 3rd time here and our go to spot.
2019-04-02,1,4/2/19: just ordered from here and the food is fair. I was very disappointed because I ordered the Tasajo Con boniato. The pic looked delicious but you get something different. Now we all know the at Food pics are usually deceiving anyways but  for $23 I expect to get better quality and attempting provide what the picture gives. The picture has rice and beans with shredded sweet potato. The meal came with plain white rice and no shredded sweet potato. I call to inquire if this was a mistake and I get "well the description says rice". If I would've know I was going to get plain rice I would have ordered beans on the side or something. And the description talks about shredded sweet potato on top as well, so what about that? I guess customer satisfaction means nothing these days. I love Cuban food and Colombian food and I've never had such a disappointment.
2019-03-27,5,Great size for Hoboken restaurants, very spacious inside. Recommended for large groups or a private intimate dining experience. Food is delicious and waiting time even on a busy night wasn't bad at all
2019-03-15,5,I recently came to La Isla for brunch, and it was probably the best brunch I've had in Hoboken (which is saying a lot because there are a lot of great options here. The place was definitely packed, so we did have to wait a bit for our reserved table and service was a tad slow, but everyone was super friendly and accommodating. The food is spectacular! I did a build your own omelette, which was delicious (definitely get any with the musThere are also a ton of breakfast and lunch options - everyone at our table was super happy with their meals. They also provide the table with a basket of delicious bread. Definitely recommend for brunch!
2019-02-25,3,Came here on Saturday at 1pm. Assuming they do brunch Saturday and Sunday, however that's not the case. I hope eventually they'll do brunch both days which would also help alleviate the abundant amount of people on a Sunday. As far as Saturday, it was okay. Nothing great, I don't love their lunch and dinner menu. Their brunch is phenomenal though. The empanadas came out within 30 seconds of ordering, and weren't even warm. It was a huge turn off knowing they were just sitting there and not made fresh. The least they could've done was warm them before arrival at our table. Secondly, the spinach salad we all got was ok. It said it had avocados... I had 2 cubes of an avocado (that's a rip off). I'll definitely go back on Sunday's for brunch, but that's about it.
2019-02-24,5,Food is outstanding, service and overall vibe is great.  One of my favorite restaurants anywhere.
2019-02-22,4,Over the last few years I've been to La Isla several times and each time I've left satisfied. I'm cuban, so I have pretty high expectations whenever I eat at a cuban restaurant and they're rarely met. La Isla comes pretty close. Most of their food is really good and fairly authentic. They use cuban bread to make their sandwiches, and have most of the staples on their menu. However, there are a few items that, while really tasty, don't really have much business being on a cuban menu...namely their tacos. We tried them once and they were delicious, but tacos aren't cuban. Aside from that, I have no complaints. Yes, it's a little pricey for cuban food...especially compared to going to a restaurant in Union City, but it's a beautiful space and it's located in uptown Hoboken. Pay a visit next time you're in the area. I would especially recommend coming during Happy Hour or for breakfast/brunch.
2019-02-13,5,Visited this location twice and while I've heard many people complain, I've had nothing but yummy experiences so it's a 5 from me ; ) On my first AND second visit I had Omar's Stuffed French Toast- it's a French Toast that comes stuffed with guava, cream cheese, and strawberries and drizzled on top with more guava sauce and powdered sugar.. it's also coated with almonds and corn flakes so it's nice and crunchy. The French toast is delicious!! Hence the reason I ordered it on both visits.. but I've also tried their papa rellena (fried mashed potato ball stuffed with beef), and their Pan con bistec (steak sandwich), and both were very good!
2019-01-17,4,While my time spent here was great, I did not appreciate paying $20 for 5 pieces of shrimp. The shrimp portion for my camarones al ajillo should definitely have been more generous. However the tres leches was delicious and very rum heavy is a surprisingly refreshing way. I've never had tres leches done that way and loved the twist. Also they're drinks were tasty too and came in cute decorated cans
2018-12-29,3,Alert! Do not park in lot!  They charge $32 for pkg and $18 if stamped by restaurant.  This was not clear and ended up ruining a great birthday brunch celebration.  The pkg attendant was very very disrespectful and RUDE!  The food, service and ambiance was good but left bad taste in my mouth after the fiasco with pkg.  We spent over $400 that day and the least they could have done is refund the money that was charged for pkg.  Good customer service goes a long way! This again is not reflective of food and waiters.  I don't think I would go back.
2018-12-29,3,The food is good here. The service is spotty. To try to avoid this, I ordered pick up tonight. A relatively easy order (cubano, chicken sandwich, yellow rice, etc). I showed up when they said it would be ready and it wasn't. I waited around for an additional 20 minutes (total wait time was over an hour). No apologies, free drink, or anything but finally get my food.  While walking back to my apt, I get a call to come back because they forgot something. So they make me walk back there (another 15 minutes out of my way). A little annoying because I already waited over an hour but whatever. When I get there, they said that they put an extra side in there. They take it away and are like "thanks. See ya".  So they made me walk back to clear up their mistake. This seems to be the attitude of the staff. If you catch them on a good day, great. If not, well "it's your problem".
2018-12-18,3,The restaurant is overrated in my opinion but passes as a place to take visitors of Hoboken to brunch for. The menu is fairly standard with the items they serve, just with a Cuban twist. The prices are moderate, not expensive but not 99¢ cheap. The design and ambiance of the restaurant is pleasant for a conversation with your fellow diners. Would come back to catch up over breakfast with a friend but not for the food. A simple brunch place, nothing more nothing less.
2018-12-16,5,This is my favorite spot in NJ. The owners and staff are amazing. Best mojitos in NJ. Authentic Cuban food
2018-11-20,5,This place is beautiful. Makes me want to stay. The soup tasted so homemade and healthy it cured my next door neighbor's flu. Roasted pork and other dishes excellent. And the people are super chill and helpful
2018-11-18,4,I rarely go to Jersey to eat but we were visiting some relatives so we ate here.  Food was excellent.  My only issue is I wish they told us what they were out of before we started ordering.  Either wise next time in NJ I'll definitely come back.
2018-11-10,2,We went to La Isla on Sunday for brunch. We were 4 adults with a kid and had a reservation for 1 PM. We were seated right away but it took a while for the waitress to show up (15 mins or so).She took our drinks and food order all at once and then went missing for half an hour. We ordered 2 hot chocolates, 2 coffees, La Island Huevos Rancheros, Omar's stuffed French toast, veggie burger and  Chicken & rice dish. Later on, we also asked for rice and beans for the kid. We specifically asked for no-meat in rice and beans. However, we were served rice and beans which had meat in it. Even after, we mentioned it to the waitress; she insisted saying that there is no meat in it. We never received a replacement for that dish so the kid was forced to it with meat! This is highly unprofessional and I won't be returning to this place as I'm a vegetarian myself.Rest of the food was just ok and not worth the money! Our hot chocolates were also served after the food which is highly unusual!!
2018-11-08,2,I came here with a group of 5 girls on a Sunday afternoon (late brunch) and have to start off by saying the the 3 stars really reflect the service more than anything. We all ordered a drink and those came pretty quickly but the food service was just a nightmare. I think out of the 5 of us, 3 of us ordered the ensalada de hongos with shrimp and two of us ordered the huevos rancheros. The restaurant was pretty empty and it took a while to get our food (which was fine)- slowly we started getting our food. Everything was fine until the waiter showed up with an el Cubano sandwich and asked us who ordered this. We responded that none of us ordered this and he went back to the kitchen. He then came out a second time with the same sandwich and asked us the same question - we again responded that no one ordered that. This again happened a 3rd time. Finally we all repeated our orders to him (at this point 3 of us have our food and 2 are still waiting. About 20 minutes later the rest of our food came out. At that point everything was okay (the waiters did not check on us if we wanted another drink or if everything was okay) but we had our food. Then getting the check - literally took one hour. We asked for it - waited 30 min, asked for it again and after an hour had passed one of us went up to the waiter station and stood there until we received our check. The restaurant itself is very nice and has a pleasant vibe, but with that kind of service, I would not return.
2018-11-04,4,Really like this little establishment! Came on a Saturday night around 6:30pm and was seated fairly promptly even though the place was packed. Ordered the Cuban sandwich and fried pork with rice and beans. Both were very good! We wanted to get the oxtail stew special but was told they ran out. Also very kid friendly and have high chairs. Will be back!
2018-11-03,1,*****RUDE & a waste of TIME !!!!! ********* DO NOT  MAKE RESERVATIONS HERE WHEN YOU GET THERE THEY DO Not  GRANT THEM . I'm so very upset we called A head of time  and let the the man over the phone know that it was my husband and I and our baby he said OK we can accommodate .  then we got there and he said no he can't accommodate . On top of everything the man in the front  was very rude to us and not apologetic. My husband was trying to take me on a date night . we were so very excited to go try this restaurant and all he could offer me was take out ? Horrible customer service !
2018-10-27,5,Went here about a month ago on a Saturday for an early dinner with my friend.  We both had empanadas and they were excellent. We also both had the ox tails and rice and it was superb, great gravy and good size portion. The service was good, the restaurant was nice, well priced and tasty food!
2018-10-27,1,Ordered delivery via Grubhub and the food never arrived. Called after 2 hours and they said it was on the way. Called 45 minutes later to ask for a refund since it still hadn't shown up, which they agreed to, and offered 20% off next time for the inconvenience. They called me 10 minutes later saying the delivery driver had "proof" that my food was delivered, even though it hadn't been, and they rescinded the offer of 20% off my next order.Overall, it was a bizarre experience and I'll never order from here again.
2018-10-27,3,This is a beautiful restaurant. Great ambiance, came recommended by a friend. Absolutely had potential to be a 5 star experience, but unfortunately not the case.Arrived on a Saturday late lunchtime. There were guests but it was not busy. I took a star off because we had issues with temperature of the food twice. Once with apps the other with entrees. 4 top. Ordered apps: 2 beef empanadas, 2 chicken empanadas and the papa rellena. They arrived literally right after we ordered and were cold. These were deep fried, how are they cold? Sent them back. Got the new order and it was good. The supposed star of the show, papa rellena (fried mashed potatoes filled with ground beef) was pretty good. For entrees, ordered the Cuban, media noche, mussels and oxtail stew. Everything but the mussels were cold. Had to send it back again. Then came out and it was good. And I had to take a star off for the service. The waitress we had was not attentive, seemed grumpy and that she was annoyed that she was working. Late on the drinks, disappeared often, forgot plates for apps, just was totally checked out.Bummed because it had potential, but we kept hitting speed bumps.
2018-09-26,3,The place jas a very good ambience and vibe. However, as a vegetarian there are very limited options in the menu. One might just have versions of rice and beans ans plantains as a vegetarian. Their Yuca fries with manchaha cheese are a must have on your visit here.
2018-09-16,5,I was a little worried when the place was empty at 5:30 on a Saturday, but we were just early.   By the time we left, they had a 40 minute wait.  Good casual Cuban restaurant.  Good service, great food.  Has a bar.  We'll be back, the next time we're in the Hoboken area.
2018-09-15,3,The food was okay, the waiter seemed confused by most orders, and the service was slow. The food was just okay, except the Papa Rellena, it was amazing! There is no cell phone service in the restaurant. The beer choice was good with different NJ beers on the list.
2018-09-09,2,Ignored. Sat at a dirty table.  10 minutes later,  no water brought out. I asked the manager politely for it. The coffee and the stuffed potato came out. No fork. Meanwhile, the server is hustling back and forth to the other tables,  food, water, mimosas, etc in hand hustling.  My advice to La Isla on Maxwell in Hoboken is to treat all customers the same,  same attention, same service.  A place can last a long time on brunch business but how you treat the least of your customers says alot about the business.  I'll go back again and perhaps they will correct the issue.  I have worked service in busy restaurants. In my college days I worked as a server and bartender at a popular place on the Riverwalk in San Antonio. It wasn't as busy today as a place like The Riverwalk during Spring Break so they really didn't have an excuse.  I've eaten out a thousand times and this really was not a good experience.*updateI had to go back because I left my messenger bag. I decided to give them another try but this time decided to sit at the counter instead.  The waiter was drinking water and asked me if I liked water.  I said yes. I then put my messenger bag on the seat and sat next to it. The server said I couldn't sit there and pointed to the space next to me.  I asked him why and he said because there wasn't any silver ware there but there was where he pointed me to, which was literally 6 inches away,  the next stool over.  I then just switched table settings and that was fixed.  Then,  the server who served me earlier before I left the first time told me she wanted to explain to me what happened earlier to give me "context". I said that wasn't necessary and to just treat all customers the same.  She still wanted to and I told her again it wasn't necessary.  The manager apologized and I told her I just wanted to have a normal visit where people give you a table mat with silver ware, get you water,  take your order and serve.  I will try again another time. Between the server that didn't want to lay the silverware down and the one who wanted to have a word with me, I hope that they can train them both.***udateI returned after placing a pickup order.  The French toast is so good that I was craving it and was not to be deterred.  I called it in. 20 minutes I picked it up.  I had handed my card to the server and she went to the back.  The manager saw me and told me she would comp it. I said thank you and that I really want them to be great because I love it too much.  In response to the owner: lots of thoughts go through a customer's head when something is so off. We want to make sense of it.  I have no evidence of bias on the part of any of your staff.  I was sharing what was going through my mind.  I want to go on the record to say that the way the manager handled our contact was professional and sincere.  The way the owner responded was also professional and sincere and I can tell that they are proud of what they've taken so long to build.  Always remember that in the end,  all we can do is our best,  and keep driving to improve.
2018-09-02,5,Since moving here we had been here weekly. Got overcharged last time we were here and spoke to Mariam the manager tonight when back for dinner and she was very accommodating. Customer service stellar!  This is just one of the reasons we love it here. Food and service is always amazing as well!  A must try if you never have.
2018-09-01,3,Came here for lunch with coworkers and the food was okay but it could be due to what i ordered . I ordered ropa vieja with white rice and black beans. It was nothing out of this world , the portions were decent and the flavor was just ok. I wouldn't really come back due to the flavor profile. It was $15 but honestly I've been to other cuban restaurants that have ropa vieja for a lower price and better taste. It was also a smaller portion of ropa vieja than i would have expected & when it came out it was not very warm. The black beans were good though. Overall it was - 7/10 not bad not great.
2018-08-24,2,The downtown version is a gem but the uptown restaurant feels like it's making imitated versions of the same menu.  Also, the kitchen was slow and the service affable but not particularly good.  I'll just head downtown from now on.
2018-08-19,4,Really good Cuban food, better than "the Cuban" in my opinion and rivals "Rincon Criollo" in Queens as one of the best Cuban food in the tristate...chicken in creamy garlic sauce is amazing so is the shrimp in garlic sauce, also had the Branzino with Cuban risotto, incredible dish which they should put on the menu.
2018-08-19,4,This place is lovely! The setting is great and the food was great!  I was surprised that you could bring your own wine even though they serve it - great policy.The appetizers are out of this world.Yuca - omg i am still dreaming of itThe plantains - yumThe fried calamari - So very goodFor a main I had the special - bass and shrimp - it was tasty and the shrimp had a hint of spice that I loved.We also had pork and it was very good.  We had so much food we ate the rest the next day!LOVE this place and will be back!
2018-08-18,5,I don't know why the heck this place has 3.5 stars right now. Great service & even better food. Made reservations for a Saturday night and we were seated immediately. The music and overall ambience were enjoyable. The calamari salad and beef empanadas were awesome to start. I got the sirloin steak with black beans and tostadas as a main - couldn't finish all of it but enjoyed every bite. Bonus: the dessert and wine selection were on point (get the cheesecake). Definitely would recommend this place and will be coming back!
2018-08-18,3,The food is good, not awesome but good, the money is well spent, if you consider you will get "gourmet" portions and traditional food with professional chef twist, The issue I have here is the service. The host wanted to sit us originally at the entrance of the restaurant where there were only 2 chairs, and it was a small table, being we wanted to see the water from our table, we declined his suggestion and wanted to go to a four seating table, our host didn't like our idea and even though he walked us to the table we requested, he did it mumbling some comments in between, my friend asked him to repeat whatever he was saying and he left without saying a word. Our server was cordial, but she was forgetful and wasn't paying attention to what we ordered: she forgot we wanted also the pulpo, my glass was empty for 10 minutes before she shows up, and we ordered something else in between and we never got it. The staff is young and you can tell they are college students. My experience was good only because the taste of the food, the ambience, my friend and the buss boy who was the ONLY one to seem on point here, bringing water before my glass hits empty. 3 stars.
2018-08-12,3,Me and my boyfriend have been to la Isla three times now. Every time the food was absolutely incredible, always getting different things and have never been disappointed. However, the service is always pretty slow/not attentive. The food was so good that we didn't mind slower service. When we ate dinner there tonight, we waited ten minutes for our drinks and 35 minutes for our food. We didn't get exactly what we ordered, and our waiter never even stopped in to check on us so he didn't even realize. We told a passing by bus boy that we didn't get the correct sides and they still never came out. We had to go up to the bartender at the end of our meal to give a credit card to pay because we never even received our check. I'm so disappointed in this place. Service should be top priority no matter how good your food is. We will not be returning nor recommending anymore.
2018-07-29,4,I walked in to this place and felt like I was on vacation. Brunch was great, they have a full bar. The food was good and the portions were perfect. Excited to go back and try dinner
2018-07-22,5,Everything was on point. Although we've waited for quite some time before they took our orders and after we ordered but the food was worth waiting for. Maybe we came on a busy Sunday evening that's why the service was slow. Nice restaurant after all definitely recommend it.
2018-07-21,2,I am only giving this restaurant 2 stars because the food sometimes is pretty good. But the service, the service, the service MUST improve.I've been here at least 15 times and every time that you arrive the hostess area is disorganized. The hostess also usually appears to be irritated or overwhelmed.They constantly run out of the daily specials and sometimes meals taste different from one visit to the next. For example, the salmon with rice & mango was good on 1 visit and not so good the next. I've been there when they ran out of flank steak, oxtail, etc. They must do better with this.And don't even let me get into takeout & delivery! The wait is very long....up to 2 hours. It's almost like they are trying to deter you from getting it. They get a lot of business because there are few restaurants in this part of Hoboken. My advice to the business, don't take advantage of this and do better.
2018-07-05,5,Another great meal! Pictured is the cubano, beef stew, black bean hummus, and shredded beef entree. Would recommend any and all!
2018-05-27,2,Ate here for the first time over MDW. The food was delicious but we had incredibly slow service. Took a very long time to have drinks brought over and even put our food orders in. I would come back since the food was so great and hope this was just a bad time to come as far as service goes.
2018-05-22,4,The downtown location is definitely still my favorite but this location has cocktails and a parking garage across the street. I sat at the bar and grabbed dinner with my girlfriend. We shared the empanadas and arroz com pollo. Yes I may have spelled that wrong. The food was great, the service could have been better. We had to ask for water a couple times, we had to keep trying to find our server. The drinks were delicious, could have used a bit less sugar and a bit more alcohol but overall it was a good experience.
2018-05-20,5,Tried twice in 2016 and 2017. Both times are awesome. Tried many dishes from half roast chicken to Cuban sandwich and steak. All of them are very delicious. Half chicken is a really good deal. Their flan is my favorite and a must order. It's a perfect combination with their Cuban coffee. And it's not that expensive as you thought! Uptown is good for a party, plus they have bar service so you can order alcohol here. Completely different vibe than downtown one. Uptown one is more fancy.
2018-05-17,5,Hoboken is heaven for foodies and this Cuban joint is one slice of pleasure !!!Whoever the bar tender is, he/she rocks !! Normally restaurants tend to go low on the alcohol content of cocktails but this guy was not there to shy away !!! Loved the kick on our drinks.We ordered a bunch of appetizers like the crab cake, the chicken empanadas and some fried yucas - Yuca Frita con Aceite de Trufa y Manchego !! All were very good.For main course I ordered the chimichurri steak and my husband ordered the flattened / pounded sirloin steak - Bistek de Palomilla. Both were very flavorful and juicy.We had two more people in our group and they ordered shrimps in white wine sauce - Camarones al Ajillo and creamy chicken in saffron rice - Arroz Con Pollo A La ChorreraThey loved their dishes too.We were too full so we ordered only one Tres Leches cake..and it was so delish that my mouth still waters when I think about it :)Overall...a very good place and nicely decked up and spacious....loved the expereince!
2018-05-16,4,Huge fan of this place, much better than the downtown location.  Had dinner & ordered from here and the food is fantastic!  Brunch is damn good too!
2018-05-12,3,Tale of 2 different experiences with this Restaurant. Food is quite good and of high quality deserving a 5. On the other side the overall service was a 1. Waitress was missing in action throughout the whole meal. If our area was packed I would give her some slack but it was empty. Their were refills needed and added items that I would have liked but MIA. We seen her at the beginning and then she totally disappeared. I had to beg for our check at the end. I always prefer service over food quality so this place will never see me again.
2018-05-08,5,Good service and prices are very non-expensive, I'm willing to come here in the future.
2018-04-23,4,My friend picked this place based on the reviews and proximity. We came here on a Sunday evening for dinner. We were walk ins and didn't have Reservations. My friend and her boyfriend got there first, it was around 5 PM. They walked in and tried to get a table for four, the hostess told them that they didn't have any tables available and everything was booked for later reservations. Me and my boyfriend arrived around 15 minutes later. We walked in and the four of us sat at the bar. About 15 minutes later I went to the hostess told her that we were sitting at the bar and asked if some table for four opened up, if she was able to notify us. Suddenly, I suppose the story changed and she said she had a table available. Food was good, drinks very good (must try the coconut mojito), fun ambiance, and friendly staff, will be returning. The only issue is that there was a bit of a wait on our drinks and the last one never came.
2018-04-15,3,La Isla Uptown is generally an okay spot for Cuban food.  I've been to this location a few times now for lunch/dinner and have always had varied experiences with the food and service.First, this location is much more spacious, brighter and appears cleaner than it's sister location downtown. The restaurant is very cozy and the decor, art, and tealight candles create a nice ambiance.As for the menu, they have both the everyday menu and their daily specials. I usually select an entree from their daily specials, unless I'm not particularly feeling a certain dish on that menu, in which I'll choose something from the regular one.From their daily specials, I've gotten the Pollo Asado (half roasted chicken) and Lechon Asado (roasted pork). Both of these dishes have always been dry, almost like the meat has been roasting on a hot plate all day. I've always enjoyed the Oxtail stew special! It's delicious...the meat is tender and falls right off the bone.Some other dishes that I've tried from the regular menu were the Camarones al Ajillo (shrimp in white wine sauce) and Bistek de Palomilla (sirloin steak pounded thin). Both of these dishes were just okay, nothing special and IMO, very pricey for Cuban food.Service is like opening a box of chocolates. You'll never know what you'll get. I've had fantastic service and on the other hand, I've had little to no service. It just really depends.If you're looking for better Cuban food, head over to La Casa downtown. You won't be disappointed.
2018-04-08,3,Cute atmosphere! It felt very cozy. I had a delicious palomilla (the pounded thin steak), and it was SO delicious. Juicy, perfectly spiced, and easy to cut. My friend had the veggie sandwich which was a little lackluster. But...the service was exceptionally slow. It might have been an off day or something but we were sitting at our table for about 30 minutes with nothing on the table except for a menu. Our drinks came much later, and at one point in the brunch I had to check with our waitress if she even put in our food orders. I think this place is a little hit or miss...my plate was a hit, but everything else about the experience was just eh. Maybe we'll give this uptown location another try later, but for now it is what it is.
2018-04-08,5,Food and drinks here are amazing !! Highly recommend the churrasco the chimichurri is to die for on the steak!! A little on the pricey side, but totally worth it. If you're a fan of mojitos you have to try the mango mojito! Super delicious !!
2018-03-31,5,La Isla - Uptown has the BEST Cuban food and restaurant experience. I've been here a number of times, and the restaurant always impresses me. It has an authentic and beautiful ambiance - there are flowers, incredible decor and great music. The service is excellent - I've had the same waiter, and he always remembers our group!As for food, the empanadas and croqueta appetizers are fantastic. The pressed sandwiches are tasty and delicious. The shakes are also incredible - I recommend Mango! But the thing we love the most is their fries - my roommates and I have craved their french fries on multiple occasions.*I will add that this review if for Uptown only - the Downtown location looks very dirty and terrible from the outside. I definitely suggest Uptown.
2018-03-31,4,The food is really great and the service is also good. I have tried the pork chops which taste great. I'll visit this place again.
2018-03-31,1,Not much to say since we were turned away from a nearly empty restaurant. We came for brunch and there were only a few occupied tables but the hostess said she couldn't accommodate a stroller. Fair enough, one star. Bye.
2018-03-25,1,Really put a damper to a great weekend. We sat down with high expectations based on our experience at La Isla downtown. We went for a family dinner and boy were we disappointed! The placemats were filthy. We didn't get menus until we asked for themWe had to ask for plates and cutlery for the kids. (Are kids supposed to eat straight off filthy placemats?)We asked for a half bottle of wine - the waiter came with a full bottle. She seemed annoyed when we corrected her and said we wanted the half bottle. The appetizers and entrees all came at the same time and the waiter (another server)  left me holding my entree above the table and walked away without looking to help me find some room to put the food down.  There was a hair on my entree (that was straight gross) I mentioned it and a very curt apology at the end of dinner. No mention of trying to make amends. I checked the bill at the end of the night and we were charged for both the half bottle and full bottle. The waiter at the end of the meal said "this just isnt your night" and yes she was right...it wasn't our night and it wasnt our idea of a good meal or experience. The food was mediocre at best. No one really ate much and dinner ended up being the overly salted plaintain chips that came with the appetizers and icecream for dessert. The bill came out to roughly 90 bucks for half bottle of wine and a few appetizers. I felt this was not at all worthwhile and will not return. Needed to post this since I use Yelp as a basis for much of my dining decisions. I typically leave a generous tip but this was the one time I felt, leaving half of what I typically leave was too much. At the very least, they should have comped the dessert for the hungry kids, miscalculating the bill, poor service and the hair in my food.
2018-03-15,5,Delicious! Had the shrimp in white wine sauce with plantanos. Service was fast and friendly
2018-03-11,5,Love this spot! Food is on point and service is great. I live super close to the place so I've been a ton of times and it's always been consistent. Their brunch is great too. The Cuban coffee is delicious!
2018-03-11,5,Had a super nice brunch with great service. Dinner is great here too. One of the most reliable places in the area - really stands out from the mostly below average food and service in Hoboken.
2018-03-08,1,$3 for a can of Diet Coke. Conveniently located but I can by a 12 pack of sodas for that price.
2018-03-07,3,Great drink/bar menu and a fun/casual menu and dining atmosphere.  My one notable complaint/critique of my experience here is that we felt very rushed throughout the service and I was not able to enjoy the meal with those at the table- our server kept coming to our table very persistently asking if we were ready to order (e.g. immediately once we we were sat, several times after, immediately after the appetizers were brought to the table, etc...).  I would be willing to visit this place again if the service did not seem like we were being rushed to eat and leave.
2018-02-26,4,3.5Decent place. Interesting food selection but a little overpriced in my opinion. The ceviche appetizer failed to meet my expectations so I wouldn't recommend that. The salad was good and the beef in it was tasty and flavorful. The steak chimicuhiri appeared to be really popular. It looked really good but it was $28 per plate so I opted for the ropa vieja special because instead which turned out to be great but the rice that came with it wasn't enough.
2018-01-29,2,gave this place a try again after my last review. I think this experience was not great. We ordered the empanada's to start and although they had good flavor they tasted a day old. Seems like they make them in advance and sell them whenever. The french toast was also stale similar to my last experience. The filling was good but did not taste fresh. I expected more and this place just didnt deliver.They also forgot one of my guests entrees and another side dish of ours. The manager did take these items off the bill so that was nice of them. I understand mistakes happen but they had forgotten 3-4 things during the course of our meal which is a problem.Unfortunately I probably wont be back.
2018-01-27,1,I stopped in tonight at 7:45 for dinner without reservations.  Yes, Saturday night, but I thought they would accommodate me. The restaurant was not particularly crowded and I did see empty tables. I was the only person checking in at the time.  The gruff hostess told me that I could sit, but I had to vacate the table at 8:30.  Never asked whether I would sit at the bar and did not try to fit me in at all.  Her brusqueness was a total turn off.  Yes, I have eaten here before, but there are other decent places to eat. I went around the corner and had a great dinner - without a reservation. Why tolerate such a welcome ( or lack thereof) people?
2018-01-07,1,SO SAD that this place can't get their service right.  We couldn't get drinks and appetizers for 30 min AFTER sitting.    Entree came out before the drinks!  More entertaining was the table next to us- the table of 5 obviously were waiting a long time for entrees after finishing their apps- they asked waiter about it a couple times. All of a sudden they came out but no one had cleared the appetizer plates off the table and the keystone cop waiter was trying to jam all the plates on the table.  One went crashing down on a customer.  SERIOUSLY??   Too bad the food is so good it we wouldn't ever go!
2018-01-03,4,This place is super cute! My husband and I came here with friends for a fun Friday night a couple weeks ago.  We had reservations (which we made earlier that night) for around 9pm.  We showed up a little early and were seated pretty immediately.  The interior is super cute, from the floor tiles to the chandelier - great vibes!We ordered a bottle of wine to share and started with some Aperitivos (apps).  We split 3 things (there were 4 of us): the Papa Rellenas, Croqueta de Jamon, and Vegetable Empanadas.  The Papa Rellenas were mashed potato stuffed w/ ground beef, breaded & fried ($4.50/each - we ordered 2).  They were heavy, and reminded me of arancini, not the most flavorful to be honest - but warm and cozy!  The Croquetas ($3/each - we ordered 2) were great, they were much longer than any croqueta I've seen - usually used to oblong/oval shapes, these resembled more of a mozzarella stick to be honest.  Regardless - they were just as creamy and ham-my as I was hoping - great!  The Vegetable Empanada was filled with spinach, crimini mushrooms, calabaza, and manchego cheese ($4.50/each - we ordered 2) - pretty good!  A bit on the dry side, despite having cheese.For dinner, I ordered shrimp, the Camarones al Ajillo: (shrimp sautéed in a white wine garlic sauce), and ordered plantains and brussel sprouts as the 2 sides.  The plantains and brussels were AMAZING - but I was too full to finish them (my husband gladly stepped up to the plate).  He ordered the Bistek de Palomilla (sirloin steak pounded thin, seared and topped with caramelized onions).  I had a bite, and although good - my dish was better!  Looking around the table, everyones' meals looked amazing!  My one friend ordered the Salmon, which gave me plate envy!  She got the Salmón a la Parrilla (grilled salmon in a hoisin guava sesame honey glaze, topped with pineapple mango salsa, over coconut quinoa salad) - said it was really great!Can't wait to try more, I would come here for drinks and apps too - I like the atmosphere.  Our server was really friendly and nice - lots of the reviews speak about terrible service/staff, but luckily we didn't encounter this!
2018-01-01,4,Liked all we got - avocado salad, Jamon e queso sandwich, camarones al ajillo, Fried yucca sticks app, Moro, arroz con gandules and the key lime pie - all were really great but the camarones al ajillo was a bit sweet.
2017-12-08,1,I usually love the food at this spot, but for some reason tonight they were extremely rude. I simply ordered my usual for delivery and the order was incorrect. I simply called to let them know they made a mistake, thinking they would fix it or at least apologize. But no. Instead they decided to berate me like it is my fault, then continued to do nothing about it. I love Cuban food and even like this spot but I do not expect this type of experience, especially over food.
2017-12-07,1,Shame Shame SHAME!!! A thousand and one lashes with a barbed wire for the workers here.I will start out and say food was decent, if this was based on food alone, i would say 2.5 out of 5, nothing special but wasn't awful.However the service here is TERRIBLE! The worst, the single worst experience i have ever had. Where to start:1. Was lied to about happy hour: The waitress barley spoke English witch is a very nasty thing to subject customers to. She lied and said happy hour included everything even pitchers of sangria , we were surprised by this but she had said it was included so we ordered 2! Get the bill no happy hour half off like she said and then she pointed to tiny tiny tiny text that said pitchers aren't included when we said she said it was she said she did not!  A true fabricator  and nasty women! 2. Forgot our appetizers and lied again: We ordered $50 in appetizers that our AWFUL waitress forgot, she came over with our entrees and we were like what about our appetizers and she says " oh i forgot i will bring them out later. UHM EXCUSE ME we wanted to start with those, she acted like she was doing us a favor by bringing our food back to bring the appetizers out first.  She said she would comp some appetizers. Another LIE!3. The adventure that was paying: After accusing us of lying about her saying pitchers were included in happy hour we noticed she did not take off the appetizers that she forgot as she said she would, she then tries to give us a $10 bill saying she did not want to remove it. We said no take if off the bill like you said, she went and removed one $4 thing. For all her awful nasty horrible service to comp $4 on a $300 bill was disgraceful and insulting. She was very rude and snotty! She then lost my credit card and played dumb like she never had it, even after she swiped it through. I got the check back without my credit card! She was very smug insisting she gave it back. When i argued with her for 5 minuets about it, somehow it magically appeared in her hand from the floor! 4: The waitress and the sneak attack: To say i was disappointed with how i was treated here would be an understatement. If i did my job the same way she does hers, i would be fired immediately. She was a real nasty women! So i ask for the manager, when she sees this, she comes sprinting over apologizing. She wouldn't even let me talk to the manager she kept interrupting and was annoying yelling SORRY SORRY over, after being rude all night she was sorry in front of the manager. No one seemed to care and it was really awful.If you are even considering going here DO NOT! Worst service ever ever! Mediocre food needs good service to make up for it. Here the service is horrendous.   Not to mention it was very empty and got seated in the middle of the only two other tables that had people there.Shame on them for how they treat costumers. and SHAME on me for allowing it to happen over and over! DO NOT GO HERE!
2017-12-03,3,I ordered the churrasco, which was very good. The moro (dirty rice) was not as moist as I would've liked. The service was sub par. The waitress was very rude and was trying to rush us out of the restaurant. Although the food was very good I don't know if I would go back because of the service. For the price, I would rather go to Rebecca's in Edgewater.
2017-11-30,2,2 stars is just because the food was pretty good but have to agree with other reviews about bad service. The staff was completely unprofessional and actually annoying. Instead of serving their customers they were at the bar gossiping about fellow staff and customers while counting their money. One particularly annoying/inebriated waitress was actually told to go home. Seemed no manager was on duty. When trying to contact the owners/management because they might be concerned about this, there was no response.
2017-11-22,4,This spot was a great find, their Churrasco was absolutely delicious.  They have a great selection and a pretty good brunch menu
2017-11-17,3,The server was super friendly and patient and attentive.  I loved the ambiance.  The mojito was good.  Nothing I ordered blew me away.  I ordered chicken with creamed spinach $19.  The chicken was tough and dry.  The spinach was raw, the chicken had a creamy sauce and placed on top of the raw spinach.  I ordered the chicken soup $5 and salmon $22 for my daughter.  The chicken soup was flavorful. I liked it.  My daughter did not like it.  The salmon wasnt cooked (raw inside).  They took it back to cook it but it had a strong fishy smell and bad flavor.  we love salmon but my daughter gave 2 thumbs down on the first 2 bites.  My sister loved her meal. She got the special dish Chicken with mushrooms $27 and the pineapple jalapeno mojito. $109 plus tip.
2017-11-14,2,My husband & I visited La Isla for our first time this past week & all I can say is what a disappointment.We went around 3pm in the afternoon on Friday wanting to try something different than our usual spot in Hoboken.Once we arrived there was already a couple waiting to be seated which struck me odd since the place wasn't busy, that being said we waited at least 5 minutes to be seated ourselves.  Hostess wasn't warm & welcoming at all to start off.Then our waitress alike wasn't personable at all.  We could barely hear her over the loud salsa music in the background plus she stood at least 5 feet from the table as though she wasn't comfortable in her shoes.  I even had to ask for a drink menu which seemed strange since you'd expect this to be on the table for customers to see.My husband ordered his drink first as I was still looking at the menu, once I did order my drink it took another 15 minutes to get mine.  Service is way to slow, seems like the waitress was handling bar/tables at the same time clearly not something she could handle. Drinks each were $10 absurd for quality of drink, Mojito tasted like pure lemon and my Tequila drink was more coconut than anything else. We ordered two appetizers and two entres, food was okay nothing out of this world.  Ceviche de camarones & vegetable empanadas were good but portion too small again for price of plate.  We also ordered two entrees, the half chicken & camarones enchilados.  My husband's chicken was actually good but the rice was cold. And my entree the camarones enchilados was not good at all, 6 pieces of shrimp in tomato sauce for $19 is ridiculous. My rice was also cold & dry and the beans were over seasoned. The food also took forever to come, don't understand because it wasn't busy at all.Overall our experience wasn't at all a good one, both service and quality not up to standards for the price you end up paying.  I don't mind paying a hefty bill when we dine out but as long as food and service is exceptional which clearly isn't the case at La Isla.  I'd have to say what stood out and seemed ridiculous the most from our first & definitely last visit to La Isla was what seemed to be the owner telling her employees how to do there job.  After we finished our apps, she had to tell the waitress to remove the dirty plates from our table. These are things that a profesional waitress should know.  Stay away from La Isla, there are much better places to eat at like Zacks Oak Bar on Willow Avenue.  Trust me you will see the difference right away as soon as you walk into the place.
2017-10-23,3,Not a bad option for Cuban food in Hoboken. Our party of 6 came in on a Thursday just after 7 and we got one of the last tables. The place was pretty packed at that time.To start, we ordered the Calamar Fruit (crispy calamari served with fire roasted chili dipping sauce) and the Montaditos (shrimp and chorizo over tostones with red chimichurri). The calamari was pretty basic - nothing special. I was expecting more out of the 'fire-roasted chili dipping sauce', but instead it tasted pretty similar to marinara sauce. The shrimp app was good but I didn't really like the chorizo, even though I normally LOVE it. The chorizo in this dish tasted like an extra smokey hot dog. Not many other flavor notes other than that.For my entree, I opted for El Cuban (pulled pork, ham, swiss cheese, pickle with garlic mojo). I figured you can't go wrong with the classic. Plus, I love cuban sammies. It was nice - perfectly pressed with gooey cheese. But when I tried a bite of the Cuban reuben (corned beef, braised short rib, swiss cheese, pickle, mustard caraway mojo), which is was my BF's Dad ordered, I immediately wished I had order this instead. The meat wasn't as dry as the one in the regular Cuban and was just much more flavorful. I also ordered a side of yuca fries, which I really enjoyed.As for dessert, we ordered the Torta de Limon Frisado con Almivar de Cilantro (frozen key lime pie with cilantro/lime syrup and toasted almonds) and one of the specials, a passionfruit cheesecake. We were all intrigued by the cilantro/lime syrup on a key lime pie. It was interesting in a good way. But overall, everything was too sweet for me. I didn't like the passionfruit cheesecake because it was also very sweet, and I'm not too fond of passionfruit. However, everyone else at the table seemed to really enjoy both dessert we ordered. I guess I'm just not a desserts kind of gal.I'd definitely come back to try some of their $5 apps during happy hour (which ends at 7, so we just missed it that night).
2017-10-21,3,I love their food but come on $8.00 for a small container of black beans and rice ! (No meat) that's way too much for such a small portion of rice and beans .
2017-09-30,1,The food was delicious, but I will never be stepping foot into this place again. I went for a family type bachelorette dinner for my sis in law. It was clearly a family dinner. Two mothers, an aunt, me, & my sis in law. It wasn't a bride with all of her friends looking for a night out. We were asked why my sis in law was wearing a tiara & we told them. When a man looking like he's the manager came up to us with shots of tequila for everyone, we were a little confused, but we looked past it. Should have taken this as a red flag, especially since I'm only 19 & I wasn't even carded. He was so upset 20 minutes later when he showed up & none of us drank those tequila shots. It was a nice gesture, but it was clearly a family dinner & I don't understand why he kept pushing us to take tequila shots, even offering to bring us more & then told us he'd drive us home. So weird. We left the restaurant & we split the payment into three equal parts-- two card & one cash. We told the waitress how we wanted to split it & she told us IT WAS OK. NOT ONCE DID SHE OPEN HER MOUTH TO TELL US IT WOULD BE A PROBLEM. She returned our cards & the change in cash. We left happily. Nobody stopped us. No one said anything about our payment method. We were told to have a good night. Two of us, me & the aunt, stepped back in briefly because our parking pass wasn't working. The same man came up to us asking why we didn't pay the rest/ didn't leave tip. We left a good tip, too. Not just some spare change we had. When the aunt tried to explain how we paid, he kept walking away rudely, printing out the receipt, not even letting us speak. I knew for a fact that the change we got back was correct. He claimed only our card went through & we left no cash. So where was the cash we paid with? He told us to come back with the cash. Both of us left so astounded at the way he was speaking to us, especially since WE PAID. Literally two minutes after we stepped out, he chased us down saying that the "bus boy found the money under the table." He said WE dropped the money under the table. Please someone explain to me how does that even make sense if we were only handed back the change. This guy is a liar & the waitress who took our money was clearly trying to take that cash & keep it for herself. Little did she know we would come back for the parking ticket. Look, I work in customer service/food industry & I know how to act in these situations. I am a 19 year old girl & I could have handled this WAY better than this grown man. Don't blame us for your crappy & sneaky waiters. Clearly, this guy was super unprofessional. This restaurant is super sketch. He's lucky I didn't drink because I could have claimed he was giving alcohol to an underage. What a joke.
2017-09-23,2,Happy hour is good, a little disappointed with food. Seems that when you go into the restaurant you see all the food already set up in small Caldero pans to bring right out, I literally got my food within 2 minutes of when order was placed. This was faster than McDonald's. Ordered maduro sweet plantains and it was hard seems like it was heated up in the microwave. O
2017-09-23,4,Great spot and the food is delicious. The service is very good most of the time, however, they have hired a new server in the last few months that really throws off the experience. She has poor sense in terms of timing for ordering, bringing out the different courses, drinks and the like which throws of the tempo of the meal. Aside from that, the other servers and their service is top notch as is the food.
2017-09-19,5,Service: The service at "La Isla's" is excellent. The servers are very friendly. They don't rush you to order, they give you just the right amount of time to choose what to order. You don't have to wait at all to get seated.  They don't take too long to get the food or even the check. In some places they take so long to give and take the check, well not at La Isla's a Cuban food delight.Food Quality: The food quality is amazing. The food is always fresh and healthy. Nothing is raw, under cooked or over cooked. The coffee is super, and there are a lot of different choices to choose from. The food tastes so good it makes you want more. I love the sandwiches, they're awesome.Atmosphere; the atmosphere is very festive. There is Cuban music playing and it is just so nice. It really feels like you are in Cuba yourself. It is colorful and there are cool pictures on the walls. The lighting is bright but not too bright. Every time I go there it is so beautiful and at night they dim the lights and it is calming. I think you should make a visit to La Islas. (Student Project)
2017-09-11,5,This is my favorite Cuban place in town so if you're craving Cuban food in hoboken this is your spot. The empanadas are so crispy and yummy. The spinach chicken dish is my favorite, it's so full of flavor and never disappoints. The sweet plantains are a must so don't forget to order them!
2017-09-07,5,Very good food and great 'hip' atmosphere. Nice decor, lighting, music.We ate here two nights in a row while in New Jersey. Great 1/2 price cocktail happy hour until 7:00 with about 12 good choices of varied Caribbean influenced drinks (he tried several ;^)She really enjoyed the mojitos. Jerry - excellent bartender. A real mixologist's mixologist.Waiter Carlos: outstanding!! Great guy. FIVE STAR.We had four different entrees including a sea bass special, three different appetizers and three different side dishes and everything was delicious. Good prices too.Sit by a window before dusk and people watch. Fun time.
2017-09-07,4,Came here for happy hour with my boyfriend, we loved our ceviche with plantain chips although I wish it was spicy but next time I'll ask for jalapenos, we also had the grilled pulpo it was good wish it was a little more charred but not bad. Drinks we usually stick to wine Vallard Sauvignon blanc which was fruity but not sweet so perfect with ceviche...so clearly no complaints their happy hour deal is half off by the glass and 5$ mojitos which you can't beat. I'd come back, especially during happy hour.
2017-08-28,5,Where do I begin? I went to La Isla for brunch with 2 friends and sat at the bar. We were immediately greeted by a friendly face. Cindy made sure to stir up some very delicious drinks. My friends had the Pepinotini (cucumber martini) and I had the Bucanero (rumchata and honey whiskey). To start we ordered a papa rellena. It was sooo good! We also ordered other things off the menu and I have no complaints. My churrasco was perfect. I had to compliment the Chef, Miguel, who was kind enough to come greet us. I think I speak for everyone when I say we were satisfied. Thanks to Naila for always checking up on us and making sure everything was ok. After a few more drinks and lots of laughs with Carlos, another friendly employee, we tried the tres leches and empanada de guava y queso. Dessert made in heaven! Needless to say our experience there was a great one. Are there other Cuban spots I could've gone to and had great food? Absolutely! But I'm sure they can't beat the atmosphere and good vibes at La Isla.Thank guys! I will see you again real soon.
2017-08-21,5,Love the atmosphere at the uptown location. The server, Sandra, gave us inside info on the new chef's creations. Had carpaccio and filet mignon raviolis appetizers. Wish I took pics. The fresh pasta was bursting with tender seasoned meat in a red wine reduction. The carpaccio came with pickled onions and port wine sauce. A real light and refreshing treat. Dinner was churrasco that was nice and crunchy on the outside and juicy and like butter on the inside. Sandra treated us like family. Our new local go-to place for sure.
2017-08-21,4,The food is always good.  However, it's difficult to understand why they don't order enough food to accommodate guests when they try to order the daily specials for dinner.  In my experience, the specials are gone by late afternoon.
2017-08-16,4,This Is a good Cuban spot to try if your in uptown Hoboken.  Our server was amazing . The food was pretty good and I enjoyed my cocktail. Parking is either street or there is a parking garbage across the street.
2017-08-11,4,When - Friday night dinnerAmbience - Nice casual, loud, latino music, low lightFood - - What: We had the Chulletas Enceboladas a la Parrila (Pork Chops) with yuka and green beans; Pollo al Ajillo con Espinaca (Chicken) and Flan for dessert- Flavor: All very good- Portion: HUGE!- Presentation: OkOverall - Nice place to go with family and friends. Good food and prices.
2017-08-07,3,Went here for brunch. Food was good. Service was okay. Only negative comment would be that my plate landed in front of me with an eyelash on it.
2017-08-06,1,Just moved to town from Miami and was looking for a morning coffee spot. Asked for un café cubano and the lady looked at me like I had 10 heads. Next thing I know she brings out something like you'd get at Starbucks. Clearly they have no idea what a Cuban coffee is. Watch a YouTube video or something!
2017-07-23,3,La Isla - Uptown has a very different feel than their original location on First & Washington in Hoboken. Unlike the homey mom and pop feel of the original location, Las Isla uptown has a modern, clean, upscale vibe - nothing wrong with that just something to note if you'd been to the original location and are expecting the same experience.My favorite Cuban dish is Ropa Vieja, so I was pleased to find it as one of the Friday specials. Unfortunately, when I tried to oder it the waiter informed me they were all out. He recommended Tasajo con Boniato which is braised salt-cured shredded beef. Having no backup plan in mind and knowing that this dish was featured on Dinners, Drive-ins, and Dives, I went for it.When the food arrived the dish wasn't very visually appealing, but that's never stopped me. However, the taste wasn't appealing either. The braised meet was way too salty and I couldn't stomach more than a couple before I had enough. Luckily, I was with a group and they were ready to share their food. Other dishes I tried were much better, but I cannot really speak to those because I only had a couple bites.Overall, it's close to my apartment and I've had friends with more positive experiences so willing to give it another shot - but first go around was a bit rough.
2017-07-16,2,The food is mediocre and it is definitely overpriced. Won't recommend! Never go back again.
2017-07-07,4,Cafe con leche is the best cuban coffee i've ever had.  There's a reason bobby flay lost this thrown down.  And if you go for dinner and not brunch their sangria is amazing too
2017-07-04,1,Extremely rude hostess. I called this restaurant to specifically ask if the kitchen was serving all meals at 3pm today because it is a holiday. I was told " yes kitchen was serving all meals till 10pm". Then I was hung up on. When I went to the restaurant with my parents for a meal for the Fourth of July the same woman who answered the phone told me kitchen was closing in seven minutes and there would be sandwiches only. When I told her I specifically called to ask about all meals she replied " yes you did call but that was a long time ago." She was rude to me and my parents. I was disgusted by her behavior. I have eaten here several times before and the overall terrible attitude of the staff is just not worth it.
2017-07-02,2,Over priced for some normal food. I had a hair in my cup too. Very disappointed. The customer service is very good tho!
2017-06-27,4,I love this uptown location for dinner. It's nice and pretty inside and good for date night or for an intimate group dinner. The sangria is great and they good the meats perfectly! I definitely will be back for breakfast and lunch as well.
2017-06-25,5,was a little apprehensive ..we are used to the downtown location...didnt know if the new place would have the same quality food..happy to say the food and wait staff are excellent...would definately go back
2017-06-24,5,The churasco and sangria are amazingggg! Our waiter was attentive and the atmosphere is great! I would deff recommend this place also FYI there's two locations, the uptown one serves liquor the other one doesn't
2017-06-23,5,Every time I go I sit at the bar. I always have excellent service from Jerry. He makes an awesome white sangria! I usually get take out and of the items Papa Rellenas always makes the cut.
2017-06-23,4,Nice spot in Hoboken New Jersey for Cuban food. Great specials and nice people working.
2017-06-06,2,Service okay, pork is completely flavorless, order was brought to table wrong to two different guests. Tres leches was awful. Yuca app was good.  Place is pretty , parking is good with validation. This place is good for a drink at the bar. Sangria is too icee. Rice with chicken wasn't cooked properly. Go elsewhere for Cuban.
2017-06-02,4,Always my go to place for Cubano sandwich! The servers are very nice. Tonight I order the special steak. Steak was cooked perfectly. Had the pineapple jalpeno mojito that was very good. Not too sweet or spicy. Location is nice as well.
2017-05-27,4,Great food and ambiance. Service could've been better as they were in a rush for no reason, but loved the location. A good spot for Cuban food!
2017-05-14,3,Been there for lunch. Food is ok for Cuban but good for hoboken. I had the lechon asado which was not nearly as flavorful as it should be (mojo sauce lacked garlic and lime flavors I expect). Pollo asado was a bit more flavorful. Medium portions.
2017-05-07,5,I took my mother here for her birthday, and it was a lovely experience from start to end. We got a 1/2 white sangria pitcher (which was pretty strong) and each of us got a sandwich off the menu. I got the Media Noche which was essentially the most tender Cuban sandwich I've ever had. For sides we got the tostones (deliciously garlicky) and the maduros (super sweet). They also sang happy birthday and brought my mom a complimentary dessert! I also want to shoutout the atmosphere of the restaurant. It was sort, with beautiful floor tile and cuban inspired art hanging on the walls.
2017-04-23,5,This place is phenomenal. Pitcher of red and skirt steak and your set. Food, atmosphere, and the service is impeccable.
2017-04-22,5,Came here for brunch recently after making a reservation through Open Table. Was seated immediately in a nice window side table. The brunch menu is lengthy but all sounds fantastic. I opted for the steak and eggs and my boyfriend got a customized omelette. The steak was cooked perfectly and a great value at $15! It also came with rice and beans. We also got a side of plantains which were SO yummy. The restaurant was packed the entire time we were there, and we understood why! The flavors were delicious. Looking forward to when I move to Hoboken in a couple months and can revisit this great place!
2017-04-15,5,Incredible food and atmosphere. Sandra took great care of us from start to finish. Great place for date night or to take your family when they're in for a visit!
2017-04-13,5,Came here for my birthday dinner and it was a great choice. I had the salmon chino-latino. The salmon had this amazing crust on it and the rice was excellent. My wife had the skate special and I was pretty jealous because it was very good, and well presented. We also had the tostones with mojo sauce, no such thing as enough mojo sauce. Definitely recommend this place if you like good Cuban food and a nice atmosphere. And if you go during happy hour all drinks are half off. That splains why I ordered 2 beers, for myself, at 6:50.
2017-04-05,5,Excellent food, service and atmosphere!!! Prices are not expensive... This place is a must!!!
2017-04-04,5,The absolute best Spanish food in Hudson County!  The place is so beautiful, great brunch on Sunday and the price is always right.
2017-04-02,4,Always love dining at La Isla - either uptown or downtown. This location is much larger and you're guaranteed a table. I've had one experience where I sat and waiting 15 minutes before someone came to my table but that was pretty atypical. I'm obsessed with the Cubano sandwich and iced Cuban latte. Everything here is delicious!
2017-03-21,3,Solid place for lunch, fresh homemade food and nice but very slow service. If you like Cuban food, which is to my opinion very rustique and simple, you will like the place. All Cuban favorites from sandwiches, roasts and stew are available among some decent fish entrees.
2017-03-21,5,Amazing food and service! I came with my girlfriend to celebrate our anniversary, and we sat by the bar area. The bartender Cindy was very attentive and made the night very special for us! The food was excellent, and the service was too! Definitely coming back!
2017-03-20,5,Every time I go here I sit at the bar and get the best service from Cindy. She's the greatest asset that this place has to offer in my opinion. The food is great, their specials are often times innovative but simultaneously stay true to traditional Cuban cuisine. Great atmosphere and music as well.
2017-03-17,5,I was very pleasantly surprised with this new location. I had heard murmurs it wasn't as good as the downtown original, but I must say it's just as good and has much more space. I'm a fan
2017-03-13,1,2 experiences explained...The first was for their Valentine's Day special this year (2017).  A few issues:1) They swapped out the vegetable that was listed with the entree with another without any warning.2) The waitress didn't know a single thing about the prix fixe menu.3) Of the 2 desserts listed on the menu, they only had 1 available at 8pm.4) Plates were rushed out - appetizer followed by main course within minutes.  We felt rushed the entire meal.5) "Complimentary" champagne was poured about 1/8th of a full glass.6) We took our half bottle of wine home - but they had to re-cork it first.  When we got home we realized the manager shoved the dry cork all the way back into the bottle!  You can't do that!  I tried to get the cork out and, as expected, it crumbled into pieces inside the bottle!The second experience was tonight.  We ordered delivery, which was expected to take approximately 1 hour.  It took 1 hour and 49 minutes.  I called the restaurant after 1 hour and 15 minutes to find out if the food was on its way, and the phone just rang, and rang, and rang.  I was never able to speak to anyone.  Once finally delivered, the food was cold.  Additionally, the sauce from one of the entrees was spilled throughout the entire bag.  ADDITIONALLY, one entree that was supposed to come with a side of spinach, actually came with 5 spinach leaves.  That's right, FIVE!  Well, how about this, La Isla Uptown.  I'll see your 5 spinach leaves and raise you 1 star... and we won't be seeing one another any time soon.
2017-03-09,5,Where do I start! We just left the restaurant about 5 minutes ago and I couldn't wait to write about our experience! I hope my uber ride is long enough to write about how amazing our experience was! First off our waitress Sandra was amazing very informative and enthusiastic! She recommended several dishes and we are glad we took her advice as the food was delicious!! We been to the original location many times, this was our first time at the Uptown location and it certainly won't be our last!! BUEN PROVECHO!!
2017-03-09,2,Downgrade alert.  Outside of the brunch this place has disappointed several times since the last review.  Even living so close I find it hard to get motivated to actually go here.  The service has been spotty, one nice waiter then two bad ones etc.  The food is meh, the ingredients just seem cheap and unripe.  It's not the worst place in the world but it is pretty underwhelming.
2017-03-09,1,If you LOVE their downtown location, you will HATE this uptown location. It's got all the charm of a Manhattan bank branch, with staff attitude to match. It's almost as if they were annoyed that we showed up for dinner. La Isla Downtown, of course, is a beloved fixture of Hoboken, with quirky decor, fast service, friendly staff and amazing food. The food here was merely "okay," although my Cubano sandwich was slightly undercooked, and the Morir Sonando for some reason was disguised as a yuppie frappé. Very disappointing. I understand that a business would like to expand, but doing so by discarding everything that made the original great is a losing proposition. I'll happily go back to the one on Washington Street, but I'm never setting foot here again, and if you care about a great Cuban experience, I suggest you do the same.
2017-03-09,1,Today march 9th 2017. This review is solely on the service.  My mother and I walked in about 11:27 in search for a great Cuban breakfast.  We were seated right away but waited for our waitress about 12 minutes.  As she took her time to approach our table (because she was talking to other staff members), she didn't introduce herself or asked us if it was our first time there (it was). She asked us if we wanted drinks; my mother and I both said yes. I then proceeded to order a beer because we were celebrating a special occasion and she replied "interesting choice" and completely disregard my mom and began to walk away.  My mother then had to reach for her and ask for a Cubanccinno. Another item we really wanted to try.  Needless to say at this point they just stopped serving breakfast. The place is empty and perhaps, if I asked, they may be able to do something to accommodate. I asked the waitress if it was possible to order breakfast since that's the only reason we were there and it was our first time. She immediately said no, and I had to request If she could just make a small exception for us since it was just closed and it wasn't busy.  She said she would "try" and came back saying that they had "wiggle" room to accommodate but she wanted me to come up with something WITHOUT looking at the breakfast menu.  She has a very nasty attitude and it did seem like she did not want to work.  Now, maybe I'm being Too critical since I'm also in the service business, but her behaviors is unnecessary and it cost the owner returning customers.  I specifically went there because I'm a Guy Fieri fan and I love that guy and his show. And I am sure if you were to go to his restaurant, this waitress' service would not be tolerated.  Unfortunately, I must express my experience because it was that annoying. I'm sure the food is amazing but the service today needs to be definitely improved.
2017-03-08,5,Can not find any flaws with this place. Service was super friendly and prompt. Food looked as good as it tasted. Very tolerant staff, as there were a few little kids there having fun. The waiter looked that the laughing kids and said "Oh it's Happy Hour" and gave us all a warm smile. So sweet. I had been to the downtown location many times (it is too crowed and small in that location but this new spot uptown is spacious and wonderful)There were fresh flowers in the bathroom, which made it smell divine. Not too expensive either, so we will be back.
2017-03-06,4,First time here and loved it! Place was lovely as well as the staff. We didn't have a reservation however we got lucky!! It filled up quickly. My husband and 2 kids went on a Sunday around 5:30 and I was surprised to see how many families with kids were there. Food was good except my skirt stale with "chimichurri" sauce was not that good. I will definitely give it another try!
2017-02-16,5,-Def one of the best restaurants in Hoboken. The shrimp and chorizo in paprika appetizer was so. Damn. Good. Also recommend their empanadas and pollo asado. Their daily specials were all great.
2017-02-13,5,I just love coming here.  I loved their location downtown and go to that all the time. This location is great for a date night or out with the girls!  The food is always amazing. I was in the mood for their lunch chicken special at dinner time and they made it for me even though it wasn't on the dinner menu.  Their Mojitos are delicious!!!  I have not had the dessert there yet, but they always look so delicious. I am usually pretty full off the main course since the portions are a nice size.
2017-02-06,4,My husband and I have been coming here quite often since we moved uptown and we've enjoyed it each time.The atmosphere in the front of the restaurant when you walk in isn't great - it's far too bright and the bar seating looks like the counter at a diner.  But if you go to the back, it's a completely different world - dim, cozy, and friendly. Service has been good every time we've been.The food has also been consistently pretty good. I particularly like the Yuca with truffle appetizer and the skirt steak with chimichurri.  They have a nice wine list and a nice selection of sipping rums, as well as good cocktails.Surprisingly, the only think I really haven't enjoyed is the stuffed French Toast that was featured on the Food Network.But all in all, La Isla is a solid spot.
2017-02-05,3,I'm giving them 3 stars because while I love the food and find it always delicious, the other night I had the shrimp and garlic and the amount of shrimp was pathetic. I got 5 small shrimp on 5 pounds of rice. Who serves those shrimp anyway? For $20 either put 10 small shrimp on my plate or use decent sized ones. It was very disappointing.
2017-02-05,4,Went here for an early dinner recently. Very convenient if you live in the building and great staff. Our server was knowledgeable about the specials and the menu in general. If you have a taste for Cuban food this place does the trick. Is it the best Cuban food you will ever have? No. But it is straightforward  and has all the classics on the menu. Decent Cuban sandwich. I'd recommend for a weeknight dinner.
2017-02-02,5,Amazing mojitos. Food is excellent. I love this place! The Cuban Reuben and the burger are some of my favorite items to order. I always order an extra side of garlic mojo to smother on just about everything!
2017-02-02,1,Sigh.I'll start by saying that I am a longtime fan of La Isla downtown having gone there for 20 years.  It is my go-to place for fantastic, reasonably priced, delicious Cuban food with attentive service.I've been to Uptown twice and am completely underwhelmed.  Everything that downtown is-- warm, attentive service, charming--- is the exact opposite of Uptown.  On my two visits, we've experienced horrific service.  Both visits, we were ignored by the waiter.  We waited 20 minutes for drinks.  Drinks came for some of our party but not the rest.  Took another 10 minutes for the remainder.  Trying to flag down a waiter was nearly impossible throughout the meal.  Courses were served and we were never checked on.  Food was ok.  I can't really say that the food is any different from downtown, though the ceviche was a touch bland and under-seasoned. Overall, I will not return.  For a higher price point, I would expect better service.  However, downtown has uptown beat in that regard.  I'll stick to downtown.
2017-02-01,4,I'm a long time supporter of La Isla downtown so I was really excited to visit this location when I heard about it. The downside? It's not byob and you end up with a larger bill. But life goes on and there are a few pros from this location. 1, the restaurant is beautiful. Upscale without the uptightness. They did a great job with decorations 2, they stepped up their game on the drinks. The coffee is amazing and still at reasonable prices. 3, this is perfect for date night or an intimate outing. Presentation is beautiful and portions were reasonable without leaving you super full. Which can be a good/bad thing. I take it as a good thing so I can try different dishes. Gets pricy thoughOverall, I'd probably frequent downtown more often since it's more casual. But for the more special days, I'd come here. Parking is plentiful in this area. The food is still amazing and the service is warm and friendly. Plus, there's booze here!
2017-01-29,2,I'm writing this review purely on the treatment I received last night. I have been to the restaurant many times. The food and drinks are good. Especially the appetizers & brunch. The entrees are just ok. But this again is about the treatment. I had a reservation for 4 at 8:00. We arrived about 20 minutes late because we pulled into the wrong lot & had to switch over the to correct one. We were told our table was given away after being 10 minutes late. We weren't called to be made aware of this. Ok, policy is policy. But they were so rude on top of it all. They said you can seat yourself at the bar if you want "it's over there". No effort at all to try to accommodate us. Will not be returning on a Saturday night!!! Better more accommodating places to go in Hoboken (I.e., zafras)!!!
2017-01-16,4,There aren't many Cuban places to compare to, but with amazingly flavorful food, La Isla sets the bar high for the cuisine. The space Uptown feels airy and open compared to downtown. The food here is awesome with the classics like a Cuban sandwich and Ropa Vieja, but some others like the pork sandwiches and shrimp dishes are less expected and just as good. Unlike other Cuban places, the plantains are very flavorful and even the rice and beans are great. It's the perfect place for a filling lunch or a nice dinner.
2017-01-08,3,I've heard amazing things about la isla downtown however i have never been. When I heard about their new uptown location, I decided I want to try it out to celebrate my birthday. My husband and I made reservations for Sunday brunch however it looks like it wasn't necessary to make a reservation because there were plenty of open tables when we were seated. My husband ordered the Omar's stuffed French toast (since it was featured in food network) and I opted for the omelette which you get to choose 3 fillings (I ordered chorizo, manchego cheese, and maduros). I almost went with the churrasco instead and kind of wish I had. The omelette was served with a small serving of their homefries (which were good) and Cuban toast (Yum). The French toast was ok but the strawberry overpowered the flavor. I was expecting more guava cheese and not so much strawberry. We also ordered 2 brunch cocktails which WERE STRONG! The passion fruit belini for me and el bucanero for my husband. I preferred his drink! Service was good. Fast and friendly. I found out to be really pricy but I've been spoiled by low cost delicious Cuban food in my north Hudson area. I can't say that I would come back but I would try the downtown location for lunch or dinner in the future.
2017-01-08,1,This location was completely and utterly unprofessional and ruined Christmas Eve for my family. Despite confirming my reservation the night before, the manager decided that he wanted to close the kitchen and called me 1.5 hours before my reservation and informed me that they could not host me. The manager blamed his employee for being irresponsible and calling me however my family was forced to run around and find an open place on Christmas Eve.Despite having great experiences at the downtown location I will never recommend this restaurant again!
2017-01-06,4,Yummy food and good portions! It was a bit odd, we went in without a reservation on New Years Day and they said the wait would be half an hour to 45 minutes, and then we commented that there were so many empty tables, then they changed their mind and seated us. Once we actually were seated, the place was great. The coffee was delicious, and the brunch was also delicious. The service was good, too. It's a nice spot.
2016-12-30,2,Well let me just say  we will be coming ng to the smaller one from here on out. The food was good, not great like the smaller one unfortunately.  Also the biggest factor was pure waitress. She truly was just scatter brained and bad. We ordered Sangria and it just taste like sweet Moscato. Another waiter came by and said "that is missing something ". Took the pitcher and returned with actual Sangria. Then we ordered Cubaccino after our meal and she came back with these tiny glasses and never asked us if we wanted whip cream. Meanwhile the table adjacent to us had the LA Isla mugs with whip cream and cinnamon for their Cubaccino.  Our meal was $100 and we were not pleased at all with the service at all!
2016-12-30,5,I grew up with La Isla. The rice and beans runs through my veins . I haven't been to the uptown location, but it was really nice. I enjoyed finally being able to enjoy their food in a restaurant space. The waiter was extremely helpful and kind. I ordered the bistec de pollo. I would say it's an average meal. Plain and easy and good!Of course I had to order tostones and yuca frita, fuego!And to top it off, the tres leches was divine. Highly recommended, as always :)
2016-12-29,4,Good for brunch on Sundays!I ordered the shredded beaf with maduros, rice and black beans. The food and service were great!
2016-12-29,3,Decent place....went for an early dinner around 4. Very spacious with lots of tables. we got a pitcher of sangria which was delicious. They gave plenty of food, i got the steak and eggs.
2016-12-26,4,Came with a friend for dinner. This place was packed. I'm usually not a big fan if Cuban food but this beat my expectations and I actually quite enjoyed my food. We were there a bit late, maybe a little after 8:30, the dinner specials were already sold out, so was one other item on the menu that my friend wanted to order. We had some empanadas to start and they were ok. I ordered a shrimp dish that was very creamy and tasty. My friend ordered a chicken dish which was tender and tasty as well. Desert was good but not spectacular. Cocktails we took the suggestions from the waitress and got a guava one, I wasn't impressed but my friend liked it. Overall I think this is a pretty fun place with solid food and drink choices. I'd come back again and try more things.
2016-12-23,1,Visited La Isla for a girls night dinner. I really wanted to like this place beacuse I am Latina and I love supporting Latinx joints but alas... I would say that if you visit this place, visit the bar and NOT the restaurant.  The food itself was tasty -- salty and fried how can you go wrong? -- but I found out this morning that my meal came at a huge cost. Besides paying for food and beverages (my tab came out to abt 60 for shared appetizers, a drink and an entree) I paid dearly with my time this morning given that I was incapacitated with stomach pain and frequently in the bathroom for nearly 2 hours. The staff was very friendly but almost too friendly. They checked in on us quite often -- to the point where we noticed it and felt uncomfortable. They were also pushy with the menu suggestions. We were ordering appetizers and the waitress suggested a platter instead which we agreed to and it came out with a shrimp special. They were good and but we werent even halfway through before the entrees came out. And not only was there no proper spacing between the meals, but 2 entrees came out together and then later another 2 entrees. Very disorganized and not a good experience. We would have preferred to space the meal out and not feel like we had to rush to finish our first course. In addition, since the tables are small, they were trying to remove plates when we weren't finished just to make space. We originally were 5 and later we were 4 and the table could barely hold the 4 of us so I am not sure how they had originally planned to seat 5 at our table. There was no space. And they kept coming back and trying to remove plates, checking in constantly -- they even removed a plate before we were done. NEVER AGAIN
2016-12-22,5,This place is amazing. Every time I've had great food, great service and great drinks. Highly recommended.Update: still amazing. My wife and I just agreed that this is one of our favorite restaurants in the world.
2016-12-14,2,I really wanted to like this place since it's conveniently right beside our apartment. We've tried it twice, bad experiences both times. Our gripe is the food. It's mediocre at best.... very surprised since it was on the food network as a great place to eat. They precook and keep their fried appetizers in a warmer to keep them warm. Really?! This is a sit down NOT fast food restaurant!! Why would you do this??? You can tell they have been precooked immediately when you bit into them. Our meals were dry and warm, not hot. Which leads me to believe they were premade and just warmed up as well. The only thing keeping me from giving 1 star is their happy hour. All drinks on the menu are half price. KEEP IN MIND they are drinks on menu only. Our server told us it was "all drinks half price" so when we ordered a Manhattan and a margarita, which weren't on the menu, we were charged full price for both ($29).
2016-12-11,3,Food is not as good as the downtown La Isla but the drinks more than make up for it.  Cafe con leche is always great and so is the toasted cuban bread.  They are very accommodating to children.  Overall a great place for families and friends out.
2016-12-11,3,Solid place for brunch or dinner. Host and service are a bit hit or miss hence fewer stars. $5 happy hour mojitos and empanadas are worth a stop.
2016-12-05,5,I've heard this is THE brunch spot in Hoboken for a while and now that I've tried it I agree it lives up to the rumors.I came with my father on Sunday. Note - we didn't have a reservation and arrived around 10:45. It was perfect because we beat the rush and only had to wait 15 minutes before the bar opened. By the time we left the place was packed.The waiter was so friendly and attentive. I had the huevos a la Hemingway. Two perfectly poached eggs on top smoked salmon that tasted more like bacon and an English muffin. It was the perfect size and flavorful. We shared the Omar's stuffed French toast. It was crispy on the outside and filled with a strawberry cream cheese. My father was raving about the food and I highly recommend it. The atmosphere was fun and the lighting and decor was welcoming. I had a great experience and will be back to try dinner.
2016-12-03,2,The food is okay. The prices aren't high but they're too high for the quality of the food. The service is lacking and the atmosphere doesn't do much either. I got the chimichuri steak special and was charged an extra  $3.50 for chimichuri. I also had the empanada to start, my dish didn't come with the sauce it's supposed to come with so I got charged $1.00 for that too. Pretty ridiculous.
2016-11-26,2,Absolutely horrible service. Went w 2 kids on Saturday at 530pm. Place was relatively empty. Waiter screwed up order for the kids (no kids menu btw) as well as mine. Could understand a bit more if place was packed. Never seen a less remorseful manager than this one. Service is clearly not at the forefront of this restaurant. We live uptown and unfortunately won't be returning.
2016-11-24,4,We come here quite often. Overall solid place for decent food at a reasonable price. Service is great, food is good (tried a few different things - the only thing I was not a fan of was the grilled chicken dish). Otherwise, their steaks and appetizers are overall great!
2016-11-19,1,If i could i wouldn't even give it a star. We made reservations for 9:45pm. We got stuck in bad traffic because of the weather so we called the restaurant to let them know we were running late. They said nit to worry that they will sit us down as soon as we could arrive, despite it saying that the restaurant closed at 10. We arrived at 9:55pm and they told us that they were closed, mind you the "hostesses" were leaning against their podium and chatting up a storm amongst themselves, 2 guys and 2 girls. Meanwhile we were able to see people were still receiving and eating. They all need to agree on when the kitchen closes and not to tell patrons that they will be seated once they arrive despite the time.
2016-11-18,4,This place was great! I has been here before for cocktails and decided that I had to have dinner here. The most recent time I went, I sat at the bar waiting for my guy friend and the bartender, Joseph, was awesome! He was chatting me up and made me a spectacular tequila cocktail. Once I finished that cocktail, he tried to make me another, and when I didn't approve, he was more than happy to make me whatever I wanted. The food was better than I expected. We started with a vegetable and chicken empanada. They were both really tasty. We also had the Camarones Enchilados o al Ajillo that was tasty. We ordered the Pollo al Ajillo con Espinaca for dinner and it was spectacular! Huge piece of chicken and tons of delicious garlic sauce. The bartender recommended it, and I would recommend it to others. After dinner, I had a key lime martini. OMG, fabulous! We also had some white rice and fried plantains. Overall, food was better than I expected and service was great. It's a mid level place, not super high end, but the food is authentic which I loved.I would definitely go back! Joseph was awesome!
2016-11-15,2,Not as good as downtown, my take out: 2 papa rellena, rice and beans.  My beans consisted of 75% juice and 25% black beans and 2 smooshed papa rellena in a container.  Dissatisfied.
2016-10-31,3,Food was a 3.5-4 (oxtail stew and Cuban Reuben were enjoyable!).  Service was...weird.  Quick to up-sell you and not very attentive. Made an odd comment about a crying baby and forgot our beverage order for a while.  Overall, the place has a nice ambiance and good food but the waitress made our party a bit uncomfortable. Would be reluctant to go back at the same day/time.  Although a totally different ballgame, we prefer the downtown location.
2016-10-23,5,A great night all around at La Isla Uptown. Food was authentic and delicious. We enjoyed the special Paella recommended to us by Andy. Our server Sandra was so attentive and helpful. The room is very bright and inviting. We were never rushed and the pace of the food arrival was timely. The atmosphere with the music and artwork adds to a relaxing and enjoyable experience.
2016-10-01,2,Let's start with the good: the Habanero Mojito was delicious. The Posada de Moda was good, but a little sweet. The vegetable empanada was good. My son's skirt steak was well executed and had good flavors. My daughter's burger was as ordered. But that's where it ends. Now, we were a party of five with reservations at least a week in advance and we were sat at a four top in the corner of their "diner looking " dining room. I was sat at the end and we had very little room on the table. Being Saturday night, it wasn't fun to be so close to the foot traffic,  but I was in the aisle, so... Next, it was 60 degrees outside, yet the A/C was still on. Probably wouldn't have been a problem if they didn't have a bunch of large ceiling fans going at a good clip. We requested the waiter to turn off the fan, as it was cooling off our food (and us) quickly. He said he didn't have the time to get on a ladder and apologized.  Wow, fans without remotes? Really? Ok, now on to the forgettable food. Black beans were incredibly salty. My chicken breast was pounded thin and totally dry, though not salty. The calamari was soggy and oily, I couldn't eat it. The plantains were also greasy and cold, though probably would have been fine if they were hot.  I can't speak to the dessert,  because by that time, we had all lost our appetite. The absolute best part of the meal was leaving the restaurant. Never again. Back to The Cuban for me.
2016-09-24,5,First time here and everything was awesome! The decor is fresh and chic. We enjoyed a pitcher of white sangria and a bunch of apps. The garlic shrimp app was awesome and the papa rellena was SO GOOD. The pork chop and the chimichurri steak were both great, and the sweet fried plantains are a great side. We'll definitely be back!
2016-09-24,5,10/10 yums. Pork chop- delicious. Steak- delicious. Fried mashed potato meat ball thing- delicious. Good job everyone.
2016-09-23,4,I've been to La Isla downtown for breakfast (always so good, heavy..but good!!) and never for lunch or dinner. I came here with my boyfriend on a Thursday evening around 8p. It wasn't too crowded so that was nice. I was greeted very courteously by the host and assuming the manager there. We were seated promptly and the server was quick to pay attention to us. I ordered the vegetarian sandwich, which was a black bean hummus and some veggies sandwiched between two soft 7-grain bread. It's not pressed like most Cuban sandwiches but I aware of that. It was fresh and refreshing as I wasn't looking to eat any meat that evening. It comes with a side of fried plantains. I've had better but still ok taste! My boyfriend had a chicken dish that had spinach underneath it. It was covered with this amazing sauce, I should have asked what It was but it is so good. I think the chicken was slightly over cooked though. It comes with your choice of two sides, and he chose fried yuca and sweet plantains. Both were very yummy and sizable sides. Our server was attentive, service was impeccable and food was good. I'd like to try their more popular dishes as I've heard they've been on the food network, so I will be returning!
2016-08-30,1,I used to love this restaurant.And then I ordered via Seamless.First, the food arrived over an hour late. Then, after calling, they acknowledged that the driver "forgot" about the order and had left it in the car.  They assured me that they recooked everything and resent it.They delivered the order.  They were missing part of the order (platanos maduros).  I called them, talked to the hostess Marianna, who put me on hold.  I eventually had to hang up after waiting about 10 mins, only to call Seamless about the error.  Seamless reached them eventually, and they declined to refund the money on the part of the order they did not deliver.  I called the restaurant again, Marianna answered again, and transferred me to a gentleman who was incredibly rude, said "the camera showed we put everything in there," and still refused to refund.  When I tried to protest, he hung up on me mid-sentence.The sad thing is that I used to really like this place. But I will never order again based on their awful customer service.  Will look to Union City and Weehawken... REAL CUBAN FOOD.
2016-08-16,5,granted my first time going to an actual cuban restauraunt, but it was delicious, great atmosphere!
2016-08-14,1,Beware of ordering delivery, unless you have 2 hours free.  Ordered 6:30pm on a Sunday.  Food arrived mostly all cold at 8:22pm.  Little by the way of concern, in fact when I called they blamed it on the rain.  there was a 10 min shower in the middle of one of the hottest days in the summer.  I had order 1hr before  the surprise shower.  Very dissapointed with this uptown location.  the downtown location was great but alas they stopped deliveries.
2016-08-07,5,Simply amazing! Quaint, sophisticated, authentic with great service. The food was outstanding.
2016-08-01,3,Great service, lots of food especially in the daily specials, and strong drinks. Only negative was the food was VERY SALTY.I came in one one hot Sunday afternoon with a friend to discover this lovely cafe-style restaurant with vibrant Latin music. We got seated by our extremely professional server, Alexa, who took our orders of margaritas while we glanced over the menu. There was a great selection of food but my friend and I both stuck to the specials of the day that ranged between $12-$15 and consisted of a main dish and 2 sides. I decided to get the lechón, rice and plantains while my friend got the ropa vieja, rice and plantains. Our margaritas arrived shortly after and were pretty strong but delicious.Once I got my lechón the first thing I noticed was how incredibly SALTY it was. The plantains were a life savior to counter the saltiness in the lechón but I got to the point where I couldn't handle it anymore. I asked my friend to try some as she wasn't as sensitive to salt as I was and she cringed at it as well. I explained my issue to Alexa who with no hesitation or attitude took the plate away to exchange it. She came back with a new dish which was still salty but much more manageable.Overall, I had an average experience and will consider coming back in the future.
2016-07-24,3,Came to La Isla on a recommendation from my brother while we were visiting.  I usually go online to check out a menu if the restaurant wasn't a pick on the fly. Was super excited to see FrenchToast on the menu.  The added  bonus was that it was featured on the food network.  I. LOVE breakfast.  Got there and the I restaurant was empty.  Sweet! We both order the French toast and wait in anticipation.  And wait.  And wait.  . The first bite.  Really dry.  Hmmm. Maybe cause it was the crust part.  Second bite.  Dry.  Even with the filling it was dry.  And....sigh.....not even good.  Is that the Cuban way?? Dunno.  I don't have super high standards..Dennys is good sometimes.  This, not so much.Three stars  cause I only tried one thing on the menu.  Otherwise, 1 star.
2016-06-26,5,So glad they opened a larger more convenient restaurant. Parking isn't an issue and neither is space. You can have a sit down dinner with all the traditional Cuban dishes that the original restaurant offers. I will definitely come again.
2016-06-19,5,Ambience and decor are awesome. Very friendly stuff and specially Alexa was very attentive and friendly.  Great recommendion from the bartender who came by personally to discuss whisky options which were not in the main cocktail menu. Also their rum selection in the cocktail menu do not have price of it for which you have to ask individually. Food was very tasty and authentic  :)
2016-06-18,5,Awesome awesome awesome! Kale salad yummy! Steak with spinach really good! Chicken in garlic sauce amazing! Yellow rice & beans, plantains so good!
2016-06-16,3,Beautiful space in a weird location.  Very small portions for some items, like the shrimp enchilados (a shrimp dish in an olive, onion and tomato sauce). Food is usually delicious but can be uneven.  My Cuban sandwich was way too dry. Downtown location is better for some reason.
2016-06-15,5,Love this spot!!! Food, atmosphere, wine, and service were all amazing!! Sandra is on point!!!! So friendly!! A must!
2016-06-06,5,Been here for Brunch, lunch and Dinner.  Not much difference between last two as have same menu.  I have liked them all though like brunch the best. The worst thing I could say about them is the bartender at lunch tries to get you to buy more expensive meal instead of daily special which they have Rotating set of three. Whether get special or entree have choice of two sides of which I choose usually the rice, beans, or yucca.   My stomach enjoys the Meat which is always tasty and my wallet enjoys the affordable prices as sandwiches are around 10, daily specials 14 and the entrees can be had for 20.  It is one of my favorite places in the neighborhood.
2016-06-05,4,I would imagine that most people reading yelp reviews for restaurants care more about the food than anything else, so lets start there.  The food is by far the best part of this place, everything we ate (and we ate a lot) was phenomenal, and reasonably priced.  AS a group of 4 we went with 3 different appetizers and everyone got demolished pretty quickly.  All 4 of us ended up getting the Friday night special based on a combination of recommendations, and the fact that the menu is pretty confusing.  It ended up being a solid decision because all 4 of us raved about it.We ordered a variety of specialty drinks, which were good, but not great, but ya know, good.  We also ordered a bottle of wine that was correctly priced, which we enjoyed. The downfall here is the place itself, its really small, so by default its really tight seating. It was hard to get comfortable being so close to the table next to us, and seated right near what I can only describe as "food runner alley"  The decor was decent as well.Overall,  The food, which is the most important part was reasonably priced and phenomenal, enough to bring me back despite the 100s of selections in hoboken
2016-06-04,3,Food was excellent, service was awful. Our waitress was extremely rude and didn't say more than three words every time she came to our table, just: "drinks?" and "are you ready?" She brought us two drinks we didn't order and we had to flag her down from across the restaurant to order our entrees. The restaurant was not too busy and we saw her standing behind the bar taking and joking with other employees while ignoring our table. If the food wasn't so good this would be a one star review.
2016-05-27,4,Finally got a chance to try La Isla and now I can't wait to go back!  Everything we had was tasty and full of flavor but without being overwhelming.  The empanadas were crisp and not greasy!  The Ropa Viejo was excellent as well as the pan con lechon (pork sandwich) and the dessert was worth getting even though we were completely stuffed!  Our waitress, Sandra was also great!  She recommends the brunch so we will be back there soon!!
2016-05-27,5,I finally made my way over to the new location and I was impressed! It is beautiful inside! The service was fine, food tasted just like the Washington street location & the sangria was my favorite part of the meal. I recommend coming to this location if you want ambiance and an awesome drink with your dinner.
2016-05-23,4,Love the vibe of this restaurant.  Everyone is always very friendly and attentive.  Went last night and while they seemed to be short on staff, the bartender made sure to check in with us often which was very much appreciated.  I usually order the shrimp and garlic which is absolutely delicious, but figured I would try the ropa vieja which was on special Sunday night. The dish itself was very good and super tender, just a bit too oily for me.  I also noticed that my boyfriend's black beans seemed to be oily as well.  The tostones and boiled yuca are always fantastic, as is the papa rellena.  They also have a GREAT brunch menu.  Looking forward to going back and trying one of their delicious sounding cocktails... I have heard that the pineapple habanero mojito is everything.
2016-05-21,5,Great food, great ambience. Menus is superb, value is also fantastic. Good job La Isla!
2016-05-15,2,Overall food is good. However, when we first came in, the hosts left us waiting while there were many available tables inside. And the two host ladies were just chatting their own stuff and had us wait.
2016-05-15,1,Bad experience, we saw they have several open space, but they let us wait for several mins! And even no napkins when we sit down.
2016-05-11,4,Awesomeness. I had the spinach salad which was insanely fresh along w the shrimp in garlic sauce (off the menu) and the chicken empanada. Ambience was perfect w high tables, fresh flowers, and subtle nuances in decor that brings you to Havana. Really well done place and service is outstanding and friendly. You won't be disappointed. Can't wait to go back.
2016-05-04,4,Another find via BeerMenus. You can blame Laz @ Sparrow for La Isla's knock out beer selection. Cuban food and American Craft Beer? What a great mix!When you walk in, the place looks like a diner. it has a long counter. Then i walked to the end of the counter. Around the corner is another dinning room. This one had a real bar with taps. Totally different decor.I have only had a few plates here. Everything was prepared quickly and very well seasoned and cooked. The server was very attentive and seemed always available to help.The star here for me is Happy Hour. Half-off pints puts a solid craft beer in your hand for around $3.50. That's a great deal.
2016-05-02,4,I ate here for a late lunch with two other friends last weekend. Overall the food was a 5 and the service was AIGHT. Rounds out to a solid 4 stars. To start we had the ceviche and plantain chips. Both super fresh and tasty. I had the ropa vieja with yuca and black beans. The beans were sub par. Yuca was nice though and the ropa Vieja was fucking perrrrrrfect so tender and juicy. One of My friends had the chicken in the garlic and spinach cream sauce which was UNREAL delicious. Food gets an A. The service on the other hand was pretty slow. They also messed up my friend's order at first. Just slow in general. One last thought- the space is really one of a kind. Art Deco vibes like Miami beach 1970.
2016-05-01,5,Had a yummy dinner here tonight.  Seated at a high top table in the dining area, we were served by a great waitress, Sandra H.  Had the La Isla Salad which is slices of tomato, topped with a slice of avocado & red onion & drizzled with some olive oil...yummy!  My husband had the ceviche which was quite refreshing!  We then shared the Havana Club which was quite delicious (grilled chicken, bacon, tomato, avocado & red onion), all accompanied with Red Sangria.  Our experience here was great, especially the service given by Sandra H.  We will definitely be back again & request we be seated in her section again!
2016-04-28,5,Great spot for authentic Cuban food. Not to mention their Strawberry Stuffed French Toast!
2016-04-22,1,The host lady was so dumb, we were late by 15 mins on a reservation and she tells me we don't honor the late showup (was I catching a flight?)Then she tells the wait is 40 mins (I'm seeing a table empty). My wife books a table on open table which shows available in 10 mins and books.The hostess does craziest thing puts my reservation on waiting!!!! Damn bad experience Oh I so miss the downtown la isla, which straight away went over and enjoyed a nice dinner
2016-04-16,5,Just enjoyed a wonderful dinner with my dear friend. The service was fabulous. We were lucky to have Sandra as our server, who recommended an amazing appetizer of fish ribs. We now know of the Pacu fish that makes four ribs to a fish. It was a delicious surprise dish! You must have the fish ribs (when they are in season). I can't wait to come back!!!
2016-04-13,5,When this place opened initially at the uptown location, there were many issues to be resolved.  It didn't hold a candle to its well optimized downtown location.Over the last few months,  i started visiting them for breakfast and now finally dinner. These guys have upped their game.  The dinner menu, preparation and service are fantastic. The location is larger, neater and still feels "cuban". The hangar steak remains my favorite on the menu ..Highly recommended ...
2016-04-03,5,Great food and service. Wish some of the specials were available when we got there but that's the downside of a popular place. Vegetable empanadas was amazing!
2016-04-01,4,Not sure why, I took me so long to write a review for my go to spot for Cuban food in Hoboken. Been coming here for quite some time now and it has been a great experience food and service wise so far.I love the fact that the owners has tried their best to preserve the authentic Cuban food , there are so many things which are my favorite but the Cameron aj ajilo(shrimp) steals the show. This place is great for brunch, lunch and dinner.FYI- They have long wait for dinner service on weekends so plan accordingly.
2016-03-20,4,This place isn't the original, downtown location and that's more than okay with me. I love this new uptown location. It's perfect for the upscale, sit down meal with friends and family; much moreso than the downtown location. You can't beat the fact that it's a quick walk from the piers. Plus the servers are super friendly and accommodating, always eager to give out suggestions and answer questions. Just like the downtown location, the food is delectable; everytime I stop in there's always something new that I find on the menu that makes me want to return again. Go here.
2016-03-18,5,Today was my first day coming to La Isla Uptown, I came with my best friend because we wanted to try something new other than Havana's. The food was good, the ceviché was A-MAZ-ING! The service was the best part about the place. We have Sandra as or waitress and she was awesome! Very attentive, alert and always kept the drinks flowing! She sealed the seal for us and he experience as she knew what was great on the menu and everything she recommended was awesome! If you are looking for great Cuban cuisine come to La Isla's uptown because the atmosphere is great and the food is even better.
2016-03-13,1,NOT KID FRIENDLY! Went at 5 pm on a Saturday and saw there was plenty of open tables with only a couple of other tables with kids. When went to the hostess she told us they only allow 1 stroller at a time in the restaurant, even though there was plenty of open tables and room for strollers. Did not even ask us if we wanted to wait for the other table to finish or if we could store the stroller outside. Will not be back, horrible customer service.
2016-03-12,2,Came here last Sunday for "brunch". Service was horrendous. The waitress looked at me and my friends like we've never eaten at a "nice" restaurant before. The sour puss on her face every time we asked for something was obvious. The steak and eggs was below average, mojito was decent at best. Will not come back
2016-03-10,2,We celebrated a family member's birthday here. I called ahead and asked if they had cakes like in birthday cakes. The answer was "no they had desserts". I showed up with a birthday cake and was told there would be a "cutting fee" of $1.50 per slice. This is not about the money, however I felt that the manager specifically was not consumer friendly. So as a family we decided to enjoy the cake at a members home, since it was clearly not something the restaurant wanted. The dinner and wait staff were excellent. I enjoyed my dinner and asked if I could get a little more of the Chimichuree sauce, which I did get. So when the check arrives there is an additional, though nominal fee for this tiny amount of the sauce. I was really feeling like this place will nickel and dime you to death.. I think they need to be more willling to serve the customer. I felt like the manager was doing us a favor. I did speak to him to see if he would reconsider, he did not.. Good luck moving uptown. I dont think they will last with these petty fees that by the way, are NOT on the menu. I wont go back. I wouldnt be surprised if they counted the ice cubes in the drink. Needless to say if took the fun out of the Birthday part of the dinner. I found the manager to be very inflexible and not very accomodating.
2016-03-06,3,Food was not a disappointment but nothing to rave about. If you want to go here for brunch, so make a reservation and go before 2 pm. We could have enjoyed our experience a little more than what we did, had the service been more friendly.
2016-02-25,5,Love it! I've been going to the downtown location for YEARS but this one is great also. I really like this location for dinner. The service is impeccable and the drinks were great. I forget the drink's name but it had tequila and coconut cream and I recommend it. The food is just as good as downtown. Definitely make a reservation place is always slammed.
2016-02-21,5,Cannot say enough about how wonderful our experience at La Isla was! First and foremost, I have to give a shoutout to Sandra, our extremely wonderful and accommodating waitress. She gave us a sample of the wine to make sure we liked it before purchasing the entire bottle and was able to get us an order of Tres Leches even after the kitchen had closed. As for the food, it was HEAVEN! I got the chicken w/garlic sauce & spinach with a side of yuca and rice. Sandra even was able to get us some beans so we got the full experience. Lastly, I have never had a more delicious Tres Leches cake than I did here last night. It was the perfect blend of spongey and milky. I will definitely be coming back here again as soon as I can and cannot wait to see Sandra again! Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a trendy ambiance with delicious food and drinks!
2016-02-21,5,This place was a mix of amazing food and amazing service. Our waitress answered all our questions, even got us the dessert despite the fact that the kitchen had closed. We ordered garlic chicken and caramelized chicken and the sangria. Then for dessert we got the tres leches cake - which is probably the best tres leches cake I had. Highly recommend this place! And ask for Sandra; she was a great waitress.
2016-02-14,4,I love love love this place. Both locations are wonderful. The uptown location is beautifully decorated, the staff is friendly and the expanded menu is on point. The new dishes are creative and fresh. Every single one of their salads is absolutely delicious. They have fun, creative drinks. It is a nice addition in a town full of Italian joints to add some variety and great food into the mix. The original downtown location is a Hoboken institution and is a not miss in town!
2016-02-13,4,the place has nice vibe. food is great. service is a bit chaotic but our servers were very nice.
2016-02-08,5,Loved it! Went to the new location for the first time on Sunday for brunch after a relaxing facial, with my girls Sonia & Shenaz. We sat at the bar and the service was amazing. The staff was on point with their customer service, especially Joe and Sandra; the food was amazing! Convinced my friends to try the cafe con leche - and they weren't disappointed. We will be back soon!
2016-02-06,5,This place is great! Ive been here for brunch and had lunch here. The brunch is great for their crunchy stuffed french toast. It really IS the best french toast you will ever have. I also got their steak and eggs which was great also. We had a few brunch drinks that were also great (they have a full bar). Another time I got a cuban sandwich to go for lunch and it was awesome. I love cuban sandwiches and Im pretty picky but there was nothing to complain about with this one. The sandwiches were HUGE and you can probably just eat half or split it with someone and still be good. Service was nice both times. Will definitely be back.
2016-02-04,3,La Isla Uptown-Decor- great Food- very good when finally brought out the right temperature. Our "server" Sandra however was personable, but something was very off- She took our drink order n came back in 10 mins asking us if we were ready to order drinks. (!?!) We ordered jalapeno margaritas n recieved mojitos, which we accepted anyway by the time they got there. One of our table entees was returned twice due to being cold. A beer glass half full, was accidentally knocked over n broke, we asked for her help in which she took her time returning with napkins she handed to us and left the broken glass all over the table with the half broken beer glass standing n beer spilled all over the table dripping on my pants. Such a pretty place w great food, I suggest they spend a bit more time on interviewing staff to match the level. I couldnt imagine this level of service in a low level diner. It was hands down the worst server i have ever experienced n the rest of my party of 4 agreed. They took the cold entree off our bill- but charged us for Patrone Silver margaritas for which we received Mojitos. They r made with rum. Get it together.
2016-02-01,3,1st time at the Uptown spot. Arrived right on time for our 1pm brunch reservationHostess: Your table will be ready in a couple of minutesAt 1:10 we sit as the counter as I am fiending for coffee. Staff behind the bar: Hi ladies, will you be dining at the bar. Me: Hi! No we're waiting for our table & would like some coffee while we waitStaff: Table?!?Me: Yes we had a 1pm reservation & our table is not ready. Would it be possible to order a coffee while we wait? Staff: Yes, of course. Waited. NO COFFEE. Hostess: Your table is readyShe leads us to the back to a table in between to very large parties that had several children & several bags scattered everywhere. Really! Asked for another table.Although there is a brunch menu online, only the regular menu was available. Disappointed. I asked for coffee again. I stressed that I wanted it oscuro/dark (tummy doesn't like cow's milk much & that's all they have). It was very lite/much milk, had to ask for another shot of coffee.Although the waiter recommended the tres leches, it had a funny, something has been in the fridge too long taste. He replace it with my original choice, rice pudding, which was very good.Food was tasty. Love the décor. Service was good.
2016-01-31,2,The food is really good, but the restaurant is in desperate need of a good manager.  The definally need to expand the menu.  They are out of everything.. It feels like I was back in Cuba with food rations.   They are out of everything.  You must ask what they have from the very limited menu.  For a cuban restaurant not to have masitas de Puerco , baca Frita , ropa Vieja on the menu.  They really need to expand and keep track of what to have in stock.  But I have to say if they have it it is good food, the taste is really good. The service need improvement like the manager.
2016-01-27,5,Went their last night...started with black bean hummus with plantain chips and then had the pollo...soaked in butter with spinach. Are you kidding me? It was out of this world. Was fighting a cold so a took a container of chicken noodle soup home. I have been eating it all day It is the best chicken noodle soup I have EVER had.
2016-01-23,4,We ordered La Isla for pick-up last night and I must say, I was impressed. The first time we dined in here, I was not as enthused about the food here partly due to the reputation of the downtown location and the quality of what we ordered. That said, I was hoping to give them another shot. This time, I simplified my order and opted for a Cuban sandwich and a salad. The salad was generously proportioned, with a light but flavorful house champagne dressing. The combination of blue cheese, citrus, mango, chopped macadamias, avocado (very fresh), and red onion added a lot of depth and texture to the California spinach. Very generous portion. Delicious! El Cubano sandwich was awesome. Generous in size, great flavor and texture within the meat, topped with melted cheese and pickles. I will definitely order this again. The maduros and empanadas are also some of the best I have had in town. Worth ordering!
2016-01-21,5,So good that i wish i could give it six stars. I am a little bit of a food snob and this placed surpassed expectations.  Prices are VERY reasonable too.
2016-01-19,1,My husband and I attempted to go here on Friday night. We really love the downtown location and were excited to eat at the uptown one on a recent date night without the kids! We had changed the Opentable reservation and when we arrived they had no record of our reservation. While I understand sometimes errors happen, the way we were treated was horrible. We just got a blank stare -- and they told us no we don't have your reservation. Not even an invitation to wait for a table or a seat at the bar. We have dined at fine establishments around the world and have never encountered such rude service. I was really disappointed and will not go back. And will tell all my friends in town. Part of what is charming about Hoboken is that it is a small town where everyone is nice. The attitude encountered at La Isla was stunning.
2016-01-13,5,Great service. Great food. Fresh homemade flavor.  Restaurant is clean, well laid out and the decor creates a very relaxed ambience ...  Cocktail list is awesome. Recommend the pineapple habanero mojito and the Bianchi Cab. Both delicious.  Cuban sandwich , Isla salad, and chicken noodle soup ... All worth going back for. ...SEE YOU GUYS AGAIN SOON!!! Save me some Bianchi.
2016-01-12,5,Amazing place! The service is usually great and the food is amazing. I've been to brunch here about 5 times and it gets better every time. Can't wait to go back again.
2016-01-11,2,I had high hopes for this place before it opened since it's more convenient for me than the downtown location.  The interior looked very upscale, but my experience eating there really left a sour taste in my mouth.  Of course, the hour wait may not have helped my impressions, but I was still excited to eat when we finally were taken to our table.  Unfortunately, the service was spotty at best (we couldn't even get our server to bring water to the table within 10 minutes of sitting down, and our drink orders didn't come for nearly 30 minutes).  Plus, the food was bland and dried out.  Maybe I went on a bad night, or maybe the restaurant is experiencing growing pains, but I won't be returning for a while.
2016-01-08,5,Service - unreal.  Ask for Sandra, and then ask her about her sweet dog Xena, like the princess! She is sweet, accommodating and absolutely wonderful.  We ordered beef and chicken empanadas to start and then most at the table had the steak chimichura - not that name on the menu but you will find it! Good food! My god.... Delicious on a plate !!!!!!! Steak was so moist- and absolutely flavorful- you need to be here.
2016-01-08,5,If you liked the downtown location then you will love the classed up uptown location. Same food in a better setting.Always a must try when dinning in Hoboken.Famous for brunch, lunch, and dinner.The plus at the uptown is the addition of a bar. Crafty cocktails always make dinner more enjoyable.Try everything!
2015-12-30,3,I gave 3stars I added a star because at the end of our dinner the manager finally helped us but I'll start from the beginning...    I made a reservation for 7 for my jobs holiday dinner... 2 of the party arrived at around 7:05 after waiting on a line at the hostess table we were told that we could not be seated until half our party got there and were directed to sit on the side... Which we found to b a bit rude as she could have easily asked if we would like to wait at the bar...    Then we figured just to go to the bar and then about 5 min two of our other friends arrived so that was more than half of our party we go to the hostess and she's zooming past us helping others and barely acknowledging us standing there finally I speak up and say "half our party is here"    She proceeds to tell me that we are late and they close at 9  then after she notices my attitude she says "but u guys can stay later like 10/11" I then demanded to be seated and she sat us our full crew arrived around 730 and when we finally get to order the waitress begins to tell us everything they are out of uggjhhh no pollo asado no more yellow rice... OK so 4 of the girls ordered ropa vieja... Oh sorry no more ropa vieja!!!! Are u kidding me one of the girls didn't get her tostones that were ordered...     We then ask to speak to the manager, I begin this same full complaint to him and as I'm talking he has this condescending smirk on his face... One of my friends calls him out on it and he says "no I'm not laughing but what can I do if we ran out" like totally not acknowledgin the fact that we are pissed and then he proceeds to b combative with us like well this and that and because this and that... Finally one of my friends simply shooed him away...    After about 10-15 min the manager finally came back and apologized for our experience and took 30% off the bill it was nice of him but I'm not certain if I will b back
2015-12-26,5,Amazing Latin decor, fresh flowers throughout the entire restaurant, especially when you walk into the bathroom --- I was greeted with this refreshing & alluring smell of my favorite flower - exotic tiger lilies. My boyfriend & I visited this establishment on Sunday for brunch. We sat at the bar & received full-service treatment from their bartender, Joe. He was very attentive and made me a delicious virgin Bloody Mary w/ just the right amount of spice.I love eggs benedict & smoked salmon so I was excited when I saw they had a dish that combined the two, Huevos al Hemingway. It was unbelievable. Highly recommend trying this dish for brunch! My boyfriend had the churrasco w/ white rice & red beans and he too was impressed.A perfect ending to a relaxing Sunday. Definitely stop in if your in the area!
2015-12-13,5,Exceptional food & service! Menu options were creative and the El Basero was delicious! Definitely one of the best brunches in Hoboken. Highly recommend.
2015-12-05,5,Love the new uptown location. Food was great, decor and ambiance fantastic, and our waitress Sandra was a delight!
2015-12-04,5,They did such a great job with this space (now that they've mostly resolved the noise issue).  It has become our go to in the neighborhood and is one of the few places in town without a TV (gasp!).  The front area was designed to look like the lunch counter downtown and the back is a stylish dining room with a nice bar and huge windows.  The music gives it a fun vibe, but I'd imagine hearing the same playlist every day must drive the staff nuts...but you'd never know because the staff always brings a smile to your table.  Like downtown, they're open for all 3 meals and the prices are beyond reasonable.  The addition of reservations makes Uptown a reliable dinner destination for your group, which downtown never could be.  And...they just introduced happy hour M-F 5-7.The food:  platano hatuey is the can't miss app.  The cubano is great, but I prefer the bread on the media noche.  Moros is the best rice order.  All the entrees (specials included) are great.  Rotating lunch specials for $10-12 are unbeatable.  And the juevos rancheros are the best on the planet.  Literally.  Try 'em, you won't argue.As for anyone reviewing this location through the lens of the downtown original La Isla, La Isla Uptown is a different restaurant with a separate name and a separate website.  It has a bar, so people may (or may not) dress for a night out.  The neighborhood is loaded with kids, so the restaurants may be forced to serve them.  La Isla Uptown caters to the neighborhood it serves, and it does it to the tune of 5 stars.
2015-11-18,4,I always liked the downtown location but was too lazy to go there & wait for a table. Now the uptown location has become a go to breakfast & lunch spot. Food is good & well priced. Service was quick. I recommend the cuban sandwich, empanada & chicken club. To drink, sangria.I had dinner only once & wasn't as impressed. Specialty cocktails took too long to make & tables inthe front of the restaurant were cramped for a party of 4.
2015-11-16,5,Fantastic food and service! Just dined here and had a great time. Our server, Sandra was fantastic. The fried yuca was unbelievable and the mojitos topped off a great evening. Can't wait to go back again!
2015-11-15,5,I love La Isla in Uptown Hoboken! Finally a place close to Maxwell that has authentic Cuban food. Being born and raised in Cuba, I know the difference! The portions are great, the variety is amazing and the customer service is excellent. You have to try their carne con papa and their Isla burger is to die for! Needless to say that the guava french toast is the most delicious thing I have ever tasted! I'll never get tired of their food. Thanks La Isla, I'm your biggest fan!
2015-11-15,5,As always, the food at La Isla was fantastic, especially their key lime pie desert. Plan to order a pitcher of sangria instead of just a glass and you'll be happy you did! The service has also greatly improved since this location opened.
2015-11-14,4,Food here is SO good. They lose a star from me because they tend to rush you--even on a Thursday night they're pushing you out and I don't like that feeling of "oh man we better go now I can tell they want us to leave" (we had been there less than an hour)
2015-11-09,5,La Isla, is about as good as it gets! I was a frequent customer of the downtown location and would go there for breakfast a lot during the weekend. So, when I heard they were opening another location, I was siked.     The Cuban breakfast sandwich is amazing! However, my absolute favorite item featured on the menu is by far Omar's French Toast. Mmmmmmm Omar's french toast, Absolutely delicious! The staff at La Isla is very kind and quick, and the restaurant is really clean, with a variety of different delicious cuban dishes and drinks to chose from.
2015-11-08,1,The original location is so much better in terms of quality and service. It is a hole in the wall but was always delicious and worth the wait when we used to live in Hoboken. Heard they opened a larger location uptown and we were so excited to finally try it. The whole experience was disappointing from the moment we walked in. The hostess is inefficient and slow. A crowd gathered in the front entrance and she couldn't get it together to quickly seat people.The menu had two items that they couldn't make. Why are they still on the menu??The skirt steak was overcooked. We asked for medium and it came extra well-done. The rest of the food was also mediocre.Definitely not worth it.
2015-11-05,5,Outstanding! Same great food and prices as the downtown La Isla. Great bar, creative food, great service, and great atmosphere. Love it!
2015-11-02,1,I so badly wanted to like this place! I live closer to their downtown location and frequently buy coffee there so when I heard this place opened and had a bar, I was so pumped. My friend came to visit from out of town so I got us a reservation for Friday night. They did seat us on time and our waiter was very nice however my experience with my meal was the worst. I ordered the salmon (which was recommended by the waiter) and my friend ordered the strip steak. While we did wait a bit for the food, it wasn't anything too crazy. When it finally came out, my salmon was basically raw and the inside was almost gooey. I told the waiter and he brought it in the back to be cooked more. This took a while. I didn't my friend's dish to get cold so I made her eat while I waited. When they finally brought mine back out, I was about half way through and what happens? I discover a huge hair. I would've thought it was mine but it was literally embedded in the salmon. I didn't want to say anything but the waiter came over just as I was pulling it out and my friend had a horrified look on her face. Immediately he said "omg" and rushed over to the manager. They didn't charge me for the meal but I went home hungry and grossed out. I don't know if I'll be able to come back.
2015-10-24,1,I live across the street and had high hopes for La Isla but am so disappointed after three dinners over the past 2 months, I will never go again. It was so noisy I couldn't talk to my dinner partner. My head hurt after 20 minutes of trying to scream to be heard above the restaurant noise. The food was not good either. On my last try, I had the salty plantains and they were barely warm round greasy tasteless wafers. The black bean side was lukewarm and the little (I mean tiny) beans were buried in a black watery substance. My friends feel the same as me and we are giving up on this restaurant. We really need a good casual restaurant in this location and hope someday one replaces La Isla Uptown.
2015-10-19,5,I'm pretty skeptical of restaurants expanding, as I feel growth breeds mediocrity in cases where the restaurant wasn't really built for scaling (e.g. Grimaldi's, Shake Shack, Carlos Bakery). So when I heard of Hoboken La Isla opening another location uptown, particularly in Maxwell, not surprisingly, I wasn't too enthused. After all, Cuban food in Hoboken is fantastic between The Cuban, Zafra, and La Isla. I think there's a rubbishy one somewhere by the PATH, but I can't remember the name at the moment.   I am a huge fan of the original La Isla, and the oldschoolness to it as well as the food. I hesitate to use a food review cliches like authentic, because obviously I haven't been to Cuba, artisinal because I don't know what the means, hidden gem, yummy goodnees, and nom nom nom because they are annoying.Anyway, La Isla Uptown accepts opentable reservations, which for brunch is great, considering I had family coming in which included two small (~15 kilos), but hungry nieces. Have to say the decor was nice, and the space was  good compared to the original location which is rather cramped. I really thought the service was phenomenal, everyone from the hostess to the waitresses were friendly, attentive, and accommodating, which generally uplifts the mood of everyone, so I thank them for that. They were also patient with aforementioned nieces, which is always helpful.The brunch food was incredible, it was up there among the top of the internal list. people in my party had juevos rancheros, egg sandwich, stuffed french toast (obviously), sides, omelettes, parfaits and some other stuff. Everyone seemed to love their meal, and I thought everything I tried was fantastic and really can't wait to get it again! However, and don't let this influence you, my 6 year old niece didn't really like the french toast (yet had a specific Chinese food order I had to make when we got home) while the 2 year old ate every egg dish that our table had. Finally, I would add two things - the mojito was good, and the prices were excellent.To summarize, I'm a huge fan, and recommend La Isla Uptown to you.
2015-10-12,3,The original, downtown La Isla had been featured on Throwdown with Bobby Flay, and its chef had even won for his stuffed French toast.  So, between seeing that episode and witnessing the long lines of waiting diners on the sidewalk, I was so intrigued that I needed to check the place out.  Well, rather than subjecting myself to the lengthy wait time, I decided to grab a Chicken sandwich to go.  I got to my apartment, tore open the packaging, and took a crunchy bite into the pressed bread stuffed with grilled chicken breast, lettuce, tomato, and crispy potato sticks.  As I swallowed, I slumped back in my seat, disappointed by the dry meat and lackluster toppings.  Don't get me wrong, I ate the entire thing, but I did not find it as flavorful as I had expected.Several years later, La Isla opened a larger space in Uptown Hoboken, and I decided to give it another shot.  While the original location only offered a lunch counter and several small tables, the new version was upgraded to include a full bar and at least 4 times the number of tables.  Despite the expanded dining space, my friend and I were unable to get a walk-in table on a Sunday night, but were luckily able to grab two stools at the counter.  However, we sat...and sat...and sat...Isn't counter service supposed to be quicker?!  Thankfully, I had a refreshing, vodka-infused Watermelon Cooler to hold me over until my food arrived.  My Seared Salmon was slightly overcooked and served with an oily black bean risotto cake, a charred beyond recognition slice of a plantain, and a cream avocado puree.  Needless to say after that glowing description, I was less than impressed.  The Uptown La Isla offered a more comfortable and classy atmosphere than its downtown sister space, but the food was not that much better.  When I could enjoy a 5-star meal at The Cuban, I could not really see the benefit to dining here.
2015-10-06,5,I would start by saying that I live right across the street, which not only makes it convenient, but dangerous at the same time, because I would love to go everyday. The mouthwatering empanadas are just amazing, and the tasajo and pork sliders are to die for.This would be my recommendation; if you go to La Isla, sitting at the bar, or by the bar area is the best idea. Red (the bartender) will take care of you, and you will not be disappointed whatsoever. Not only he will make you the best of drinks, but he will also recommend something great to eat. His costumer service is incredible, and besides the great food, that's why I keep coming back every time. When I am eating out, I look for a place with good service, La Isla staff will make you feel like if you are home. Way to go La Isla and Mr. Red for being awesome
2015-09-27,3,Disappointing. Very loud. Very very cramped in the back room. We sat at a table in the middle and we were all banged and bashed by the rear ends and elbows of the waitstaff over and over without apology. It all might work if this was a quick in and out joint but it is designed as an upscale-ish uptown restaurant, not a downtown joint. This restaurant needs to decide if it is to be a cramped and crappy joint with OK but not special food and untrained waitstaff or a pleasant place to have a relaxed meal with the family. Since it is designed to be the latter, there needs to be a complete re-think of the way it is organized.
2015-09-27,4,Great new spot in uptown. Black bean hummus served with plantain chips is a must! Sangria was just okay, Have been there 2x, the first time around my bartender was excellent! Second time around we had a new bartender who seemed stuck up for lack of a better word. All in all would make this a regular spot.
2015-09-23,3,Hit the new la isla today for the first time.  Beautiful new space with great atmosphere and high ceilings.  Solid craft beer list and cocktail list.  My date had a spicy pineapple vodka drink converted to a margarita and the staff was happy to accommodate.Had the shrimp in plantain cup appetizer which was the most flavorful dish we had.  My date had the salmon and I had the tabajo, similar to ropa vieja.  Both were tasty but nothing to write home about.The atmosphere and cocktail list makes this a solid week night drinks choice.  We'll have to see about the weekend.
2015-09-19,4,Always been a fan of the downtown location. Uptown is fancier version but same great taste and service. Also has a new addition to the menu called the la Papa which is phenomenal.
2015-09-14,3,The food was great, but the service was severely lacking. While our server was very sweet and accommodating, it took them over an hour to get us out food. There was only 4 of us, so I believe they only did half of the order and forgot the rest because 2 of our dishes were cold and 2 were moderately warm. The staff tried to accommodate us by giving us complimentary empanadas and dessert, but not sure if a 2.5 hours dinner experience with just entrees ordered was justified. Basically, I think the food was good, but the service/kitchen needs to step up its game before I return.
2015-09-13,5,Space AND reservations?? The new uptown location has the same amazing menu and you have the space to spread out. So happy this location is open and they have a great craft beer selection as well.
2015-09-10,1,Came in 10 minutes before closing and dirty looks and teeth sucking. Seemed to have a town hall meeting about whether they should serve us.. right in front of us.. just left. They advertise open till 10 but whatever
2015-08-31,3,Food is great, but wish the service was better.  Really good atmosphere and a fun place to go to.  They have a counter to sit at and order from with tables surrounding them - I like that they have both options.  Good menu and great food, but the service was so bad.  Our waitress barely came to the table... took forever to order and then once we ordered (and gave our drink orders as well), didn't see or hear from her for about 30-40 minutes.  Got 2 drinks and had to tell her when she brought our food out 30-40 minutes later that she forgot to bring them over.  I'm sure I'll return eventually, but not that anxious to get back anytime soon.
2015-08-29,3,What a difference 12 blocks makes... As a semi regular at the original la isla location, I decided to try the new iteration. Wow. Soaring ceilings with Caribbean style fans, beautiful Spanish tile floors, the rest of the interior white, airy and chic. Latin jazz vibrated gently in the background. This is definitely not a diner, drive in, or dive.The menu is the same (including the prices), with the notable addition of a liquor license and accompanying bar. They really push the cocktails, actually withholding food menus until drink orders are placed. The servers look more polished, dressed in black with tight chignons, but the service is equally indifferent as its predecessor.We ordered some old standbys, pollo al ajillo and ropa vieja. The portions, while not as gargantuan as the downtown location, were still generous. And thankfully, the food tasted pretty much the same - delicious.All sounds good, right? So why 3 stars when I unabashedly adore the other location? There were strollers here, several. No one would ever dare bring a stroller to the downtown location for fear of invoking a riot in the cramped space. A toddler actually waddled over to me and had her hand on my thigh. Not cute. The crowd here was dressed to the nines and definitely looking to see and be seen. It was very uptown. That's not why I go to la isla. I go there to devour enormous quantities of Cuban comfort food in a relaxed environment while being casually ignored by the waitstaff. Not bad, just didn't work for me.
2015-08-29,2,Service is glacial.  Quality of food is far lower than the original location.  Almost none of the veterans from the old location are here and the operation does not fill the big shoes it has to fill.
2015-08-27,4,I took a couple of folks here tonight for a work related dinner. The food and the service were great. We ordered shrimp, salmon & chicken. All 3 dishes were delicious & plated well. We shared the keylime pie for dessert, yumm. We loved this place. I would want to go back BUT there was one big downside. We all felt that it was extremely loud. The decibel levels are off the charts.  The seating is a bit too close for comfort which didn't help. Makes for having a conversation rather challenging. I'm seeing this super loud environment trend in the newer restaurants. I think its by design. A few new places in downtown Jersey City are the same.
2015-08-26,2,Came relatively soon after their official opening and were able to get a table for two with ease across from the counter.The new establishment was noticeably louder and seemed designed to do a lot more than their location on Washington St. Yet,that's where the problems occurred.Our food arrived well before our wine-which we were told was due to the busy bar being backed up.Some dishes were lukewarm and when sent back,returned noticeably microwaved. The one standout dish was the black bean hummus.In short,I would rather let this new restaurant work out its growing pains and return to its flagship's charm and efficiency.
2015-08-24,2,My boyfriend and I went on Sunday night to the new location uptown. It was pretty crowed but we managed to get seated quickly near the back kitchen area next to the bar. We saw our waiter 2 times that night. First time when he took our order, second time to take our check and apologize to us about how terrible the service was. I have to say the food was excellent but it took an incredibly long time for us to get our food, drinks and even when we tried to order dessert it took so long that we had to again wave down someone to cancel the dessert order because we had to get going. As all of this was going on I could see our waiter behind the bar/ in the kitchen talking and laughing with his staff, obviously too busy to help us with anything so the busy bartender and hostess kept coming over to get our drinks, desert and give us the check at the end of the meal. The entire time we felt like we were pulling teeth trying to get anyone's attention all the while, watching our waiter in the kitchen/ bar talking and doing nothing. It was busy that night but there's no excuse for that. The food was incredible so that would be the only thing that would bring me back. Maybe next time they will be better staffed.
2015-08-23,2,The food is nothing to brag about. Gets 2 stars because the waiter was really pleasant. Wouldn't go back & wouldn't recommend it to my friends and family.
2015-08-21,5,My wife and I have frequented the downtown Hoboken location, and love it. Uptown is likewise a winner. And they have a bar - with great, hospitable and fun bartenders. We had a blast eating and drinking at the bar, and all was delicious.
2015-08-20,5,If you ever go to La Isla make sure you call and see if  "RED" is working the bar! He is amazing!!!!!!!!! This about my 4th time here, Food is great but the atmosphere is why i keep coming back!!!!!  I am happy to find him behind the bar again once again in hoboken!!  Menu not need when you see this dude!!
2015-08-17,2,We came into the restaurant about two weeks ago.  First impressions were good.  The layout is spacious, there is a nice bar area and ample seating for groups of a variety of sizes.We were seated and our waiter came over and requested our drink order.  Our first issue was that our waiter opened the wine and filled my wife's glass up without allowing her to taste the wine he had suggested.  Normally a minor issue, but the wine recommended was not very good and given the chance, she would have ordered a something different.  Next we ordered our meals.  I had ordered a steak dish medium rare.  My wife ordered shrimp with a side of rice and beans.  To sum up our meal, my steak came out a bit overdone but I still thought it was good so not a huge issue but we only received my wife's shrimp, no rice and beans.  So her dinner consisted three shrimp.Now you may ask, why didn't you ask the waiter to bring the rice and beans out.  Well we would have, but he was no where to be found.  I saw him running into the kitchen and talking to other patrons, but not once did he ask us, "how is your meal?"At this point, we saw two of our friends and they stopped over to our table to talk for a few minutes.  They left and still having no contact with our waiter, we asked a server for the check.  At this point, our waiter reemerges with our check and we tell him that we were not satisfied with the service.  He then suggested that it was our fault because we were talking to our friends.  To make matters worse, the bill included the rice and beans that we did not receive which he then took off.To put it simply, we were unhappy with our first experience at the uptown La Isla. Furthermore,  I have never had a waiter imply that it was my fault for lack of service.
2015-08-11,4,Beautiful small restaurant!! With a real Cuban flavor... The food is delicious! However, the chef seem to be a little too strict.. We arrived 5min past breakfast menu, and did not let us order breakfast... We tried to order from the main menu, but they were missing a few things... Really?!?! No breakfast and not complete lunch menu?!?
2015-08-09,5,Headed to Hoboken for Italian and stayed for Cuban instead. Started with White Sangria. Very nice. Felt like summer vacation. Had chicken empanada. Best I've ever had. Full of flavor. No crazy ingredients. Had chicken soup and excellent. Intense chicken flavor in broth. Lots of perfectly cooked shredded chicken. Home made, not from a Panara soup bladder. Had steak milenesa. They wouldn't add eggs which was odd. However, may have been the most flavorful milenesa I've ever had. Very pleased. For dessert I had the coco flan. After a meal of great food, this flan took the crown. Perfect texture and flavor. Nice sauce. Ground coconut shavings on top with a cherry drizzle. Yummmmmmy. The yellow rice was subpar. The plantains were fine, but nothing special. Would go here again.
2015-08-08,5,I've been to the La Isla downtown and found out about the new uptown location randomly. Went on a Saturday night, service was absolutely fantastic and the drinks at the bar were amazing. Come for the great drinks, incredible food, and go see John at the bar - awesome experience!
2015-08-08,4,The ropa vieja was great especially with tostones covered in mojó. The pineapple and coconut mojoitos were good.The atmosphere was fun by the bar and made it an enjoyable to talk.
2015-08-02,1,I love La Isla downtown, this new location, big meh.Met a friend for brunch, was craving their manchego, onion, and chorizo omelette, which is listed on their brunch menu online.  We get to the restaurant, and it's not on the menu there, but they clearly have all the ingredients.   I ask if they can make it, and the waitress flat out says no, the chef won't do that.  Really?  The chef can't take 10 seconds to dice chorizo and add to eggs, too much of a hardship??!!So I had to order a manchego and onion omelette with a side of chorizo.  When I ordered the side of chorizo she had to go find out if they had it - at a freaking Cuban restaurant on a Sunday morning???When our meals came out, no toast, we had to ask for it, too and waitress gave us more attitude about having to check if our meals came with it.  Meanwhile on the menu it was clearly stated all the egg dishes came with home fries and toast.Do not get me started on the noise level.  The whole place is tiled, whose bright idea was that?  Surely it just kept build out costs down.  You can't hear people at same table without practically yelling.  Will not be returning here.  It's a shame, we had such fond memories of original La Isla which were tarnished by this place.  The owners should be ashamed for the bait and switch.
2015-08-02,1,Nice new decor uptown but horrible service. I went once late night and it was quick especially since we got a Cuban sandwich. I came back with my family for dinner on a Sunday and they ran out of every special, bread (so no sandwiches), roasted chicken,avocado- all of the basics. After ordering the waiter came back to us about 4 times because they kept "running" out of food. Keep in mind they had just opened at 5 pm and that is when we sat down. The manager was no help at all and stated he was upset with the limited amounts of food ( which isn't our problem!). How do you run out of food at 5pm. Will not return- horrible customer service! Disappointed- waste of time.
2015-07-31,5,Went here last week and had the swordfish special with cauliflower Brussels sprouts And a caper sauce. It was amazing, recommended by Red. One of our favorite restaurants in Hoboken. Very accommodating menu for gluten free!
2015-07-29,4,I'm a sucker for good Cuban food and this place delivered. We walked in on a Sunday night and were told they only had room for us at the counter.  I'm actually a fan of sitting at the bar because I find that you normally get better service and most times a show. On this night everyone seems very busy and a bit overwhelmed.  Our waiter took our drink order but the beer list wasn't updated so we had a bit of confusion when figuring out what to order.  We opted for the arroz con pollo and half roasted chicken.  Since our food was a special of the night it actually came out of a steam table which normally would terrify me but in this case the food was still delicious and the chicken moist and tender.  Bae's chicken was also on point and it came with two sides. The tostones were hot and delicious but lacked in that delicious garlic sauce I'm accustomed to.  We tried to be healthy by getting veggies but they were lathered in butter and garlic.  Overall I was really impressed.  The food was on point, the space is new and inviting, and the service attentive but a bit overwhelmed.  I'll be back.
2015-07-27,4,The food is delicious. My only complaint is the noise factor. Why didn't they think about the acoustics more when they built the place? You literally have to scream to hear your table mates on a Saturday night.
2015-07-27,2,This should really be 2.5 stars, I just can't give it "A-Okay."I live 2 blocks from this place and have admittedly never been to the downtown location, but always heard the best things about it and was so excited to have this open.  I am also a big fan of Cuban food when I can find it and - full transparency - the Cuban on Washington is my favorite restaurant in Hoboken in terms of value/quality/ambiance/service.My first experience was on a Sunday evening on July 4th weekend and we sat at a table.  Service was fine, and food was 50/50 - I got the cuban sandwich and while it it no Empanada Guy cuban (YUM), it was solid.  My husband got the famous Tasajo Con Boniato, which was a bit dry, but okay, but a thumbs down overall because it was 18 bucks and the size of an appetizer.  Should have taken this as a sign.Then Saturday happened.  It was 8:30 and we sat at the bar (lots of space despite being busy, no reservation) and the Bartender was great - attentive, served me a tasty, custom made mojito cocktail that was delicious and my husband got a tasty Pale Ale.  We next ordered Camarones al Ajillo...and waited...and WAITED...and watched w/ sadness as two parties at the bar who sat after us received, not just THEIR apps, but their entrees. 45 (!) min., lots of scrambling, several, "it'll be RIGHT OUT, I promise" and many apologies from everyone (but an owner or manager...way to back up your staff!) later we got....three overcooked tiny shrimp!!  I couldn't even contain my disgust when the little pot was opened.  Awful. We did stick it out (it was almost 10 so what choice did we have to go elsewhere?) and I got the mahi mahi special which was very good, but small for $24 and my husband got the steak for $22 (good, but compared to Cuban, which has awesome sides, sauce to DIE for, sub par).  Okay.Now again, the kitchen and bar staff dealt with this as best they could (no idea what happened  though) - Comp'd the shrimp and a drink, so no complaints there.  But honestly, the food is overpriced and simply not that good.  Basically the same plague that befalls the majority of Hoboken spots.  I was also very disappointed that one of the owners (we were clued into this when we sat by other guests), who was sitting two seats down from us and saw this whole debacle, didn't say word ONE to us.  C'mon!All said, save for getting that mojito again and hitting the bar for drinks, when I'm craving Cuban, I'll continue to make the trek downtown.
2015-07-26,4,Long awaited arrival of one of my favorite downtown spots uptown. The decor is nothing like the original; the is one feels like an upscale location that could be in Miami or in a hotel lobby in Cuba. It's bright and airy and lively. The food is much the same as the downtown location, with the main difference being this location has a full bar. We went a few days after the opening, and the brunch menu was limited compared to the downtown location, which I expect will change. The other really nice thing about this location is that they take reservations on opentable, versus the original location which has a hand written waiting list which is loosely referenced when giving people tables.
2015-07-24,5,The Cuban sandwich was excellent as was the Camarones Enchilados... Service was friendly and knowledgeable... Best part of the experience was the Habanero Mojito- its truly a must have!!
2015-07-15,3,First off, my friend and I are huge fans of La Isla and have been going there for many many years, in fact, it's my favorite restaurant on the planet to date.  We were so excited that they had decided to expand and open a new location closer to home.  That being said, I was very disappointed in our dinner last night at the new location.  The new place looks amazing and the service was excellent, however it was extremely loud and we had to shout at our friends in order to be heard in a conversation, it was like being at an elementary school cafeteria during lunchtime.  The food wasn't the same quality or presentation as the original location.  Portions were much smaller, the skirt steak (we ordered 3 of them) came out alone on a white plate with no garnish (no lime/no onions, nothing) they even forgot to put the sauce that belong on it on top,  the black beans were less seasoned and tasteless in comparison,  the boiled yucca and tostones were missing the crushed seasoned garlic, and the Key lime pie was soft like whip cream rather than hard like ice cream on a tiny canoe plate with very little cilantro sauce (which makes this dish) and no cookie or whip cream.  The chef/owners really need to reevaluate things and try to mirror the dishes of the original location, because the food has lost its special flavors in the new location and for long time loyal fans, it was a big disappointment for me and my girlfriend.  For the 3 people we brought as our guests that had not been there previously, they thought it was good, but had they eaten at the old location they would have been floored as were my guest that have come along in the past.Also, it felt like the new location was trying to step up their game by having the wait staff wear all black collared shirts with long aprons and in my opinion, that look is a bit stuffy and doesn't go well with the food.  I understand what they are trying to do by appealing to a higher class of clientele, but I believe the place would feel more accessible if the staff wore the t-shirts or polo shirts.This new place, as it stands today, pales in comparison to the original unfortunately - but I will go again to see if improvements have been made in a few months.  It would be nice to be able to make a reservation and be seated faster; but only if we can get the same quality of food and experience.
2015-07-05,4,I've eaten at the original La Isla down on Washington Street a few times and always enjoyed the food there, but I was especially glad when I noticed they were opening a second location closer to where I live. On Friday (07/03), my boyfriend and I decided to check this place out and see if it was just as good as the La Isla we've come to know and love.First off, the layout is somewhat similar to the original: a long bar/counter frames the front, with small tables lined up along the side. Since the space is larger, though, there are more tables around the perimeter of the place, although we sat at the bar because it looked like every table was already occupied.The menu appears to be identical to the original location's, which is good, since I recognized some of my favorites. I decided to order the Ropa Vieja with a side of black beans and white rice, and my boyfriend ordered the roasted half chicken with yellow rice. I had a bit of a hard time understanding our waitress; her accent was very thick and she spoke softly. But she brought our food out quickly and was very pleasant. My Ropa Vieja was very good, but I found myself comparing it to what I've had at The Cuban, and I'm sorry to say that what I had The Cuban was slightly better. La Isla's Ropa Vieja was cooked well, but the shreds of meat stuck together and were on the dry side, and there wasn't a whole lot of sauce to mix in with the white rice. The black beans were delicious, though. I also tried some of my boyfriend's chicken and...wow. Just wow. I should have ordered that. The chicken was not only roasted, but marinated in a light garlic sauce, so the meat was extremely tender and fell off the bone (literally). The next time I come here, I will order the chicken.Before we left, I decided to get the guanabana sour sop, which tasted like a mix of strawberries, pineapples, and apples with a hint of coconut and milk. It was very tasty and not too thick, which made it easy for me to enjoy during our walk home.Overall, I think the second La Isla is worth another visit. The next time we come, though, I'd rather sit at a table. The counter stools are a bit high, and for vertically-challenged people like myself, that's not necessarily a good thing. ;-p
2015-07-05,2,Food was not bad but I felt that I experienced a soft opening and ended up paying the bill.I ate there on July 4th and was offered a very basic menu (3 starters, 3 main courses). We were told it was because it was the 4th July (!) but I think it was because the chef still cannot cope with a full menu. When I noticed people eating a Cuban sandwich at the bar I asked if they still had some and the waitress told me that it was available, why she didn't mention it when she offered us the menu is strange... Waitress was very sweet but all over the place, seemed very confused and stressed. Drinks are very, very weak and not worth the price, I couldn't taste any alcohol at all. I really want La Isla to be a success but they need to get their act together otherwise people will just walk to The Cuban or Havana. I will try again in a months time and hopefully things will be different. Hostess on our way out seemed a bit out of space and didn't even wished us a good night...
2015-07-04,3,I live on 14th street so wanted to try the new restaurant just a couple of blocks away. Unfortunately I think they're still working out some of the kinks of the business. Our waitress was lovely but service was SLOW - it took over 30 minutes for a cold appetizer to arrive. I ordered a cocktail and it tasted great but there wasn't even a trace of alcohol in the drink and the serving size was tiny.On the plus side when our entree arrived the food was good - I had a good steak though my carrots were a tad undercooked.One other issue - we called the night before to book a table and were told they don't take bookings - but when we arrived they asked if we had a booking! And the hostess totally blanked us as we left!As I say, they need a few weeks to sort out their systems.
2015-07-04,5,La Isla is one of my favorite Cuban restaurants in Hoboken and I am SO happy that they opened a location in uptown.  I no longer have to track downtown!  This location is a lot more spacious and nicer than the downtown location.  Don't get me wrong - the wait may (will) still be there!  So far the food is identical to downtown (including some of the staff so you might see familiar faces).  Incredible food - I absolutely love their cuban sandwiches and Cuban coffee! This location offers full bar service so no BYOB. They charge $20 corking fee.
