2021-07-27,5,I ordered the orange green tea which was the perfect balance. It was just the right amount of sweetness, and the orange juice was freshly squeezed which I really enjoyed. My friend ordered the strawberry lemonade and she loved it as well. Perfect balance and just the right amount of sweetness. We also order the taro milk tea with bubba and it's one of our favorite flavors so it did not disappoint. The place is pretty small however there wasn't anyone there when we walked. I'm glad we found this spot and will be back for sure!
2021-07-01,4,Yesterday tried the Kung Fu Tea Hoboken location and I ordered the peach oolong tea with grass jelly and bubbles. The drank was really good and they have a variety of toppings and tea and non tea based drinks on the menu and definitely would go back and they also have locations throughout New York and New Jersey.
2021-06-17,1,The pearls in the bubble tea I bought today are too hard. It's not good. It's not today, it's often the case.
2021-04-09,5,I'm a big Kung Fu Tea fan! I especially love this location. The staff is always so friendly and they're very efficient. Everything always comes out so fresh. My favorites are winter melon milk green tea, passion fruit green tea, and taro slush. Not only can you adjust the level of sugar and ice to match your preferences, but they also have a wide selection of toppings too-- boba, jellies, and even red bean. You really can't go wrong with anything from here!
2021-04-08,5,One of my fav places to get a bubble tea at! There's a similar Kung fu tea in Princeton downtown and my go-to drink is taro bubble tea with lychee jelly!! So so soooo good. It's a must try!
2021-03-08,4,I ordered for pick up via the app since I was in the Warby Parker next door. My order was ready within about 5 minutes. They have the entire shop zoned off and your order is on top of a rack. There are bags and straws for you to pack your own order. This is completely fine with me - I'd rather the least amount of human interaction possible during these times! Drinks were made correctly and tasted like classic KFT.
2021-03-06,2,Well, ordered delivery from here today. Never tried their bubble tea.We ordered the signature medium Kung fu milk tea, seasonal pumpkin oolong milk tea, and matcha milk tea.Delivery was quick. Packed neatly. The medium is more like a small....The signature milk tea arrived warm. Ordered it with less ice. It came with no ice. It tastes like soap. It's awful. I do not recommend it at all. Got it with bubbles. It was $6.05. Way too expensive for what it is. Never again.The matcha milk tea with bubbles added was okay. I've had better quality matcha. It's definitely on the sweet side even though I ordered it with 0% sugar and less ice. This came with some ice and was cold. Would I order this small matcha again for $7.35? Hell no! Way too expensive for a little matcha. :(The pumpkin oolong milk tea was the best of the three! Ordered it with 0% sugar and less ice with added coffee popping bubbles (so neat! And yummy) and the tapioca bubbles. This drink arrived cold with some ice. The coffee popping bubbles were great. Tapioca bubbles great. The flavor is also sweet on its own. This was the only drink we agreed was worth it. The medium (though small size) was $6.80. A fair price since it was delicious. This is the only drink we would order from here again. It's seasonal so try it while it's here! :)
2021-03-03,1,The cashier in the store today is super rude. Very disappointed. Never experienced such bad customer service at Kung Fu Tea before.
2021-01-27,3,I ordered coffee milk tea with bubbles, it was pretty good but not today, it tastes like coffee milk sugar water.
2021-01-12,5,I got the honey milk green tea shit was fire! Tasted amazing sweet and milky. Definitely recommend this place.
2020-12-23,5,I love Kung fu, I have been ordering boba from their chain for two years now. You can taste the freshness of the tea and the sweetness of the bubble tea.
2020-10-14,5,Ordered through Uber Eats and had a great experience. I have had classic bubble/milk tea from Kung Fu before (at one of their locations in NYC) but this was my first time trying this location.I ordered the classic winter melon green tea, 30% sugar with pudding and jelly and tapioca. I would highly recommend and will definitely order again.
2020-10-03,2,I normally love this place but today 10/3/20 at 5:46pm was horrible. The person taking the order was rude (this never happened in the years and amount of times I've been here). I was right in front of her when she still proceeded to process an online order first. That would've been ok if she didn't give so much attitude. When I received the order it was so watered down too and not the normal quality at all. What is happening to this place! It's so disappointing since I love this place so much and the people that worked here. I'm giving a 2 star instead of 1 because I'm hopeful they can turn this around.
2020-09-10,1,As someone who works at another Kung Fu Tea location, I am very disappointed with the customer service here. I have given this place many tries and I have been unsatisfied with the service every time. The workers are not friendly, quite rude and impatient. I tried to order a customized drink today and the woman taking my order looked at me like I was crazy and rolled her eyes. I know people have bad days, but to receive this service every time is a waste of my time. When I did receive the drink there was hair strands inside the cup. Do not recommend this location. Try Gong-Cha across the street.
2020-08-16,5,I had the opportunity to go inside and order. Everything was set up wonderfully and the lady at the cashier was VERY nice and I didn't feel pressured to order ASAP. She even suggested a few milk based bubble teas which my mom ended up loving!The tapioca is also DELICIOUS. Not stale. Not dry. Just perfection.I even loved the fact that they had straws, napkins and these CUTE drink bags to go. I'm glad I stumbled upon this place!
2020-05-27,1,My third time picking up  bubble teas, they just ignore my request of "less sugar" Somehow they jack up the amount of sugar way more than usual when I specifically ask for less sugar.  Today's staff was rude. Taste your drink before you leave. I am tired of going back for a remake.
2020-03-16,1,Rude staff. Just purchased bubble tea, asked for a plastic bag to carry, the lady staff just threw a plastic bag on the table and said nothing, continuing what she was doing. Very unhappy! Even a basic "Thank you" or "Have a good day" was not possible???
2020-02-22,4,I walked about a mile today to get the bubble tea from here. I got the grapefruit green tea with bubbles. It was very refreshing. I saw people ordering JianBing from here. I will give it a try next time.
2019-08-27,2,I like their tea but they closed early today. Saw us outside the window just now and ignored us. I hate businesses that don't stick to their operating hours. Hope they had a good excuse.
2019-07-23,5,Great bubble tea! My favorite is the Taro Green Milk tea, no sugar and no ice. The bubbles/tapioca pearls are soft with the right amount of chew. Staff are friendly and efficient. Never had to wait long for my drink. There are plenty of seats and spacious enough to accommodate my stroller. There are several bubble tea places in Hoboken, but Kung Fu Tea is my go-to.
2019-07-15,1,This location is honestly the worst! People are so slow mo cant understand any order like what a joke! Customers put in instructions for a reason don't just ignore it what if they have allergies!!! Loved Kung Fu Tea but terrible business here!
2019-06-27,1,i place order for delivery but I don't know why they give me hot bubble tea with 87 Fahrenheit weather what's more there is no seal.
2019-06-16,4,Popping bubbles!!!! Love this place. It's a bit pricey but good for a tea hot or cold.
2019-05-20,5,The best  bubble tea ,the taste is so creamy . You can taste the tea equal to cream or flavor.Perfect !!!!!!!!!
2019-04-26,5,Tapioca: 10/10. Probably the most flavorful and the softest tapioca on the bubble tea you can ever have. Favorite flavors: Milk Tea bubble tea and Thai tea bubble tea with normal ice and sugar. I found that they dont always have Thai Milk Tea but when they do have it, i would say it is Kung Fu's best flavor.Havent tried any fruit flavors but will be trying it out soon. Everytime I go there I always call ahead (5 mins) to order for pick-up. The place is located in the most busiest street of Hoboken so parking is hard to find.
2019-04-17,5,Great service. Fast, clean and drinks are amazing. I drive an hour to have mango snow slush. I typically grab 2 one for the ride home.
2019-04-05,5,I am more of a Gong Cha fan but I like coming to this KFT location because of what they offer. Other locations in NYC do not have the rice rolls which they have here. The location near me in Brooklyn has other food options (popcorn chicken, squid..) which they do not have here. I think the food is based on where you are and what the store decides to offer. I know there are some locations in Manhattan which only offers drinks and no food. There is also a lot of seating for a bubble tea place and they also have board games for groups to play. I also like how KFT has an app where you can earn rewards. So far I have been able to get a few drinks for free with the rewards. So kudos to kung fu with the great marketing.
2019-03-31,5,Kung Fu Milk Tea is always my favorite bubble tea spot. I could never get tired of tbh. They're very quick at this location and I love how they have a little corner full of messages/drawings on sticky notes. :P
2019-02-23,5,I've been to other Kung Fu Teas before and I have to say this tea was much better. The bubbles/tapioca balls were so fresh and my almond tea was so delicious. You really can't go wrong with KFT but this location was especially good.
2019-02-23,5,I Recommend the mango green tea with mango jelly.. Don't recommend the strawberry lemon GT (added mango jelly), it was super bitter. The after taste was not pleasant.
2019-02-17,5,Hot latte boba... who knew? Love this little gem
2019-02-11,5,My favorite bubble tea place in Fort Lee! I love that they adjust the sugar and honey levels for my teas. The staff is super nice and I'm always impressed by how quick they are. They have a lot of drinks but I'd definitely recommend a hot honey oolong milk tea! Love that its lactose free :)
2019-02-09,4,I've come here twice to get bubble tea. The shop is usually empty so I've gone right up to the cashier to order and my drink is ready within a few minutes. The decor inside is cute and the staff is friendly. There is a seating area in the back. Gong Cha recently opened across the street and I know you can choose how much sugar you want in your drink over there... not sure if Kung Fu Tea offers that option.
2019-01-25,5,Still my #1 choice for milk tea in Hoboken!! I actually are very glad to see more bubble place is opening in town, because when there is healthy competition, there will be improvement!! With that said this is still my #1  tea place in town. Not only do their tea taste good, one should also try their Hong Kong Stye Egg Pancake and with a twist of ice-cream on top. My favorite combination is with the Matcha. Besides the signature Kung Fu milk tea, you should also try the Lychee punch  and passion fruit green tea, both with Nata Jelly, just to name a few. There are many more good flavors drinks. Staffs are always polite, warmth and welcoming! I agree sometimes the service can be faster but this is really the best tasted tea in town, so I understand when there is a long line and the wait is unavoidable. !And I wouldn't want to trade another tea place because of the wait! Their tea actually have tea taste other than any other place in town of just sugary taste.The place is also very cute, very clean! There are sitting places from front to back. There are a few table at the back. They have a few board games and some magazines too. Had never used it myself but they definitely put the customers in mind and making the whole place welcoming for everyone. Not to mention that old style video game console by the entrance. Bringing back some old day memories and can actually introduce to the youngsters what we played back in the 80's
2019-01-17,2,I was walking down Washington Street and craving some bubble tea, so I decided to stop in to grab a drink. I've been to Kung Fu Tea before, but it has been a while and I've never been to this location ... and this was a reminder why I haven't been to one in a while and why I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon.Service is extremely slow -- I felt like I could've taught myself to make bubble tea faster than it took their trained workers to do it. From the moment I ordered to when my drinks finally came out, it took almost 15 minutes. As far as I could tell, there was only 1 order ahead of me. The cashier was extremely slow (may have been a trainee, which would explain his trouble putting my order in). And one of the workers that was supposed to be making my drinks was staring at his phone for minutes before he started to make my drinks.The milk tea is heavy on the milk and light on the tea flavor. It just seemed so heavily diluted that there was no balance. If I'm drinking bubble tea, I'd like to taste some of the tea and not just milk. I did learn from a friend that they use powder for their tea, which I was told is pretty common for most bubble tea places and probably affects the flavor. Not helping matters were their tapioca balls, which did not taste fresh at all. They were sour, and it seemed like they were serving a day old batch.Perhaps this was just an off day for them, but I'd like consistent quality if I'm going to be spending that much for bubble tea.
2019-01-06,5,Love this place. The staff is always friendly and the service is quick! Try the mango green tea!
2018-12-07,4,I am just addicted to their bubble teas. Order bubble teas from this place in a daily bases, i  didnt like coffee popping bubbles though. Also i cant find regular Wow milk tea in grubhub and doordash online menu.
2018-12-01,5,This is probably my favorite bubble tea spot. I have ordered several times through Uber Eats. The delivery has always been on time and the drinks are just perfect everytime. Lychee punch with extra lychee pulp FTW!!
2018-11-29,5,I love this place more than anywhere in hoboken. I am almost there  everyday. Workers are so nice and gentle. I tried all kind of teas in 2 years. I never carry  cash w me. App makes easier to pay . Thanks everyone!
2018-11-25,1,Nice staff but I've never waited longer for a bubble tea. The front cashier seemed more concerned about getting their Seamless orders into the system than taking the orders from customers in front of them.
2018-10-23,3,This is the slowest Kung Fu I've ever been to, they probably average 1 minute per customer just for them to order your drink on their little iPad, and then you still have to wait for your drink to be made so even if you're taking your drink to go it eats up around 10 minutes of your time. The tea is somewhere between mediocre and normal, usually a bit watery. The bubbles are usually not bad, it's kung fu typical honey boba and the texture is generally good - not too mushy. I'll keep coming here, but only because there are so few boba places in Hoboken and Kung Fu is at least better than ViVi's. When Gong Cha opens across the street this place will have some competition!
2018-09-21,1,Don't get their milk based teas!!I've been to a lot of bubble tea places in the area and a few Kung Fu Teas, this one has gotten a lot worse in the past couple of months. Came here a few days ago and felt sick after getting a milk based tea. My bf got the matcha milk; not only did it have an uncomfortable concentration of match (to the point where it was almost bitter), the milk also made him feel sick. Their fruit teas are decent, I enjoy the mango green tea. I wish they didn't charge extra for adding boba though considering most people come here for bubble tea. There are definitely better boba places, especially in the city, if you're interested real, authentic bubble tea that doesn't make you sick.
2018-08-02,1,I don't understand how you can go to a spot dedicated to making bubble tea but the workers don't even bother to ask you if you want tapioca. They charged me $9.33 for two cups of tea, one with tapioca and apparently the other without tapioca, which I was not aware of until afterwards even though I mentioned to her I wanted tapioca in both of my drinks. I still gave them a $10 bill and told them to keep the change. After I got my drinks, one of the cups had no tapioca in it. When I went to tell the lady who placed my order, she pointed at the menu and told me that she would have to charge me another $.50 for tapioca when I clearly gave her more than 50 cents as a tip. The least she could've done to make a customer happy was give me the tapioca she clearly already charged me for. Horrible customer service. Stick to the Kung Fu Tea's in New York.
2018-06-30,5,Lines out the door and for good reason! This is probably the best location I've been to based off of the selection of teas they have to offer. They ran out of Thai but I ended up getting the coffee flavored milk tea which was amazing. The bf got an Oreo flavored one which was equally amazing. Will definitely be back!
2018-06-28,5,I LOVE coming to Kung Fu Tea with my friends! We can sit by the window or at a little table while drinking our yummy tea. The store is really clean and the decor is nice. I like the post-it wall which I have become a part of!! Can't wait to come back and enjoy more bubble tea
2018-06-23,3,One of the better bubble tea places in the area however can seem to have some grainy issues with the milk teas. Coco is better but Kung Fu is the 2nd best place I have been in Jersey City
2018-06-03,3,Story time with tiny! (My nickname everyone calls me lol) So. First time at this location and came on a Sunday night. I wasn't expecting it to be busy at all but boy was I wrong! Upon ordering there were already a good amount of people waiting for their drinks and from the looks of it, they looked like they've been waiting for a while. I believe their were only 3 people on staff.Anyways, my sister and I ordered our drinks and she got the taro milk tea and I got the strawberry lemon green tea. Right after we ordered a couple behind us ordered and behind them were a group of 4-5 other people. Why am I mentioning them? I'll be getting to that.After placing our order I didn't expect us to be waiting for so long. Almost a 15min wait, and more and more people started coming in and it was getting a bit crowded. A couple of more mins passed by and the worker finally called out our drinks. My sister got hers and mine came right after. As soon as I went up to get it, a girl from the group of 4-5 people took my drink (oddly enough we ordered the same drink). I was like "uhhhhh wutttt" I was just so confused. Wouldn't it make sense that if someone placed an order after you did, their drink would come after? Even when other people who also ordered before you didn't get their drink yet either? Makes sense right? By the time I realized she took my drink and started walking away I kept saying "excuse me excuse me" and also the couple behind me tried to get her attention as well. When she finally caught on and told her that she took my drink she was already drinking it. At that point I was annoyed and I ended up waiting even longer to get her drink since she took mine. Yes we're all human and we do make mistakes but still. (Enough of my mini rant)All in all the interior of the place was really nice with plenty of seating in the front and back of the business. The place was clean as well and the drink was also good (just wish it wasn't taken from me). If I did have to suggest a couple of things I would say that the workers should ask for the customers name and have it on their drink so other people wouldn't get mixed up. Another thing would be to have a couple of more people on staff cause the service I was experiencing was just lacking. (Hence my 3 star rating). Will I be back? Maybe but for now 3 stars it is.
2018-05-16,5,loved the tea and service here and the prices aren't bad either !
2018-05-03,5,I am a huge fan of bubble tea and this place did not disappoint. The tapioca is delicious and the tea itself has a great flavor. I recommend this place.
2018-04-27,5,THIS PLACE ROCKS!!! Soooo many options...i got the strawberry lemonade flavor and it was probably the best bubble tea ive ever had. My sister got the tarot and liked it also. I like how they have alot of flavors that are non-dairy for us lactose intolerant people out there! Open a location on Long Island and ill be a loyal customer forever :)
2018-04-16,4,As good as bubble tea gets!  I ordered a mango slush with mango jelly, and it was so good, I finished it on the walk back to work (full-stomach & brain-freeze all the way~).The facility is equipped with LCD menus, appropriate industry-grade mechanical shakers, cup sealers, which is expected.It's not obvious, but the LCD menu shows options for "Sugar level" and "ice level" for your beverage.  The staff was friendly and able to change my order last second (opted for no extra sugar).There is seating in the back, but it's rendered useless for meetings or getting work done because the shakers are really loud.Did you know that it's called "Bubble" tea because there are bubbles at the top of the cup after the beverage is properly shaken?  That tradition has been broken, since they wipe the bubbles off in order to make more room for drink, before sealing it air-tight.  No complaints here!
2018-03-29,3,I heard great things about Kung Fu Tea, so I figured I stop by this location for dessert after we had dinner in town. We came 15 minutes before closing, so I think that contributed to my poor experience, but I still believe that timing should have a very minimal impact on food quality or availability, especially for a bubble tea shop.I wanted to order a green tea milk tea, but we were told they were out of green tea. Because of the language barrier, it was hard to tell if it they were out of it because they only make a certain batch per day or they were trying to do closing procedures earlier than closing. Either way, I was happy to find something else on the menu to order. It wasn't clear on the menu that they served black tea milk tea, but it's usually my go-to drink, so I tried to order it and it was accepted. My boyfriend ran into similar difficulties when he wanted to order drink, but they were also out of that particular tea.I have never run into a problem like this at other bubble tea shops/stands, so I was very disappointed in our experience. On the plus side, they have a video game console set up in the seating area which we played to pass the time while our drinks were being made. Overall, I wouldn't come out of my way to come back to this particular Kung Fu Tea location.
2018-03-27,4,I love this place- I go a few times a year since I know it's all sugar and not something I should have daily, although I could- I so could!! There's a lot of options, many I haven't tried but would love to. I usually get mango green tea with bubbles- a large is on the expensive side and sometimes I feel like there's a bit more ice then needed but overall I like the service and the place is clean! They have a punch card as well which is great if you go often.
2018-02-22,3,I am from Taiwan and I tried the Kung Fu Tea here in  USA. I can only say Kung Fu tea in Taiwan is already not good and not popular. Kung Fu tea here is worse than Taiwan. The bubble tea is way too sweet even I ordered less sugar. I couldn't even finish because it's so terrible. Plus, they're confusing the customers that they actually don't use real milk in normal bubble tea. You have to emphasize if you want real milk and you need to add money. A real milk bubble tea is like $6 and it's ridiculous. Service they're very good but sadly this is the best bubble tea we can have in Hoboken. If I was in New York, I would choose Gong Cha or Coco which is much closer real bubble tea from Taiwan.
2018-01-23,5,Lovely atmosphere and a great selection of bubble teas. The most convenient and consistent of all the bubble tea places in Hoboken. The prices are expensive, but no more so then any other bubble tea place. The seasonal flavors for the teas are lovely and I always have several choices of what to order every time I come here. The only thing that their menu is missing is 'milk cap' as a handful of bubble tea places started offering a few years back. Their egg waffles are also really nice, and their milk tea shaved ices are some of the most delicious deserts I've had in the past few years.
2018-01-23,5,Great service and great tasting slushes specially pineapple and passion fruit. Must go place when is hot and humid. You have to try the Passion Fruit slush with regular sugar.
2017-12-20,5,I'm a big bubble tea person so let me just say that this is the best bubble tea I've had in the area. I'm pretty sad they stopped doing deliveries through ubereats because that's usually where I ordered it from since going to Hoboken and finding parking or risking double parking for a ticket is just too much of a hassle for me.I personally love their black tea, which I believe is called kung fu milk tea? I could be wrong. The bubbles are just amazing. Not too sweet and not too stale like most places i know. There is a great balance with their milk teas. I love it.
2017-12-01,5,It's about time a bubble tea place came to Hoboken. A handful of the Asian restaurants in town offer bubble tea, but a specialty shop is much appreciated. I've never been to a King Fu Tea location before, but I've seen people in here each time I walk by. Today was my first stop and I was pleasantly impressed. There are games in the front HS kids were crowded by, a line of tables along the back, a nook of seats in the front by the window, as well as outdoor seating. I got the Kung Fu milk tea (a medium is the smallest size and runs you $4.28) -- it was delicious! Also love that you can order to your liking; adjusting the amount of ice, bubbles and sugar! This location is on Washington Street b/w 5th and 6th; smack in the middle of town on the Main Street. It will be successful I'm sure!
2017-11-27,5,Absolutely love there bubble tea! It's delicious and something I could drink it all the time! I recommend the coconut milk tea. Fast and efficient service. I would highly recommend to anyone!
2017-11-11,5,This popular chain store on busy Washington Street is a great place to stop and satisfy your craving with some bubble tea!  There is some seating in the back, but seems like the popular thing to do is to order to go.  Location is great and definitely worth stopping by after Saturday brunch.
2017-10-31,3,I'm not that into bubble tea and these sort of drinks but my boyfriend really likes this place, so I gave it a try. I can't remember if I've been to other Kung Fu Tea chains in the city or if they're all the same, but I liked the menu system at this location. It's extremely customizable - you get to choose bubbles vs. tapioca, etc., flavor, sugar level, and ice level. Just be careful thought because those add-ins can add up real quick. I had the iced oolong tea with herbal jelly. I really enjoyed it but lots of the herbal jelly chunks were way to big to fit through the straw. The tea was great too. It wasn't watered down like I was half expecting. Would definitely be willing to come back and try some other combinations.
2017-10-10,5,This is one of my favorite places to get bubble tea!! so love the quality and the friendly employees and the stylish environment! BUT i think they should brand the location out to different areas of New Jersey like the Montclair area!! Montclair would bea. PERFECT location for King Fu Tea!!!
2017-09-12,5,Great place. A Large variety of drink options. Everyone is always super friendly and quick. No complaints
2017-09-02,5,Let's start off my addressing my morbid obsession with tea. I am an AVID tea drinker, needless to say I am fully cognitive of the tea quality spectrum. I was reluctant and determined to NEVER return to a Kung fu tea since my first awfully memorable experience at another location....until I read another yelp review. They advised against making a review about the chain BEFORE giving this location a try, so I took her word and I am sufficiently impressed and surprised.I got the honey green milk tea. GOLDEN. It was freshly brewed to perfection and the boba was chewy and perfectly sweet (even 20 minutes prior to closing). I am so glad I gave Kung fu tea a second chance as my patience for finding a great tea spot in Hobo was growing THIN. 1000× better than ViVi IMO. Customer service is on point. The girls in the front were welcoming and very sweet, NO REGRETS! This place is a MUST! Grab a drink and head over to frank Sinatra park to enjoy the NY skyline - priceless!
2017-08-03,5,This is my all time FAVORITE tea/bubble tea place!  You can tell them what percentage of sweetness you want your drink so you never end up with a sickly sweet drink unless you want it.  Their menu is large but the staff is incredibly friendly and very knowledgeable ready and willing to help with any question you may have.  They have a clean bathroom and free wifi as well as lots of seating indoors and some seating outdoors.  My favorite drink which happens to be vegan friendly is the Green Tea Milk Tea with bubbles 70% sweet.  They have a frequent buyer stamp card, 10 stamps and you get a free drink!  My only suggestion is to stick with the "tea" flavors as that seems to be what they do best!
2017-08-01,4,I was so incredibly happy that Kung Fu opened up in Hoboken! This Kung Fu is pretty spacious, with a seating area in the back with tables and a few games that you can play! There's also a few seats in the front of the store. It's always really clean and never too packed. I also really like the decorations in the store -- always bright and cheerful. The location is a bit of a hike from the PATH, but if you're out and about for a meal on Washington Street, it's a perfect place to stop by and get dessert!
2017-07-13,4,I had passed by this business many a time thinking it was strictly tea. One hot evening I noticed they have iced drinks and I stopped in for the Caribbean frozen drink in the window. The store is narrow but it actually is very large in that it goes deep and has a separate back room filled w tables and what appears to be a popular vibe. The drink was absolutely fantastic. It was fresh fruit without the sugar and the ice was ground extremely fine. The drink was tightly sealed in case you want to take it to go. The frozen drink was a delightful surprise. I will be back to test other items on the menu.
2017-06-17,5,Love this location - the service is great and their seating area is a great place to relax (they even have some games to play). On top of the bubble teas, I love that they have matcha cream snow.
2017-05-14,5,Really good stuff! I love that they have a loyalty card. No complaints! Atmosphere is nice too and bathroom is always clean. Super helpful staff.
2017-05-11,4,This review is for the egg waffles only (I was too overwhelmed by the number of teas and didn't know enough to make an educated decision).  I've now come on 2 separate occasions and gotten them, here's why:Pro's: quick service, not too expensive, different "treat" vs your typical baked good (since these are made to order), they're super light, and it only takes a minute or two.  We didn't sit inside, but it's clean and there is a lot of room to stay if needed.  There's even outdoor seating during the summer months!Con's:  menu (for tea) is a bit overwhelming, and if you've never tried bubble, milk or slush tea (like me), it'd be hard to know what to get.  The snacks look neat, but they're not in English so it's a bit of a guessing game on what you're getting (unless you speak the language).  Overall-come here for the waffles-do the tea if you're adventurous!
2017-05-09,5,BEST BOBA TEA ever!!! and ive had lots lol i like the slushes, my favorite one is the coffee and the taro slush.
2017-04-03,5,An amazing place! The employees are always SO nice, even when there's a huge line and they're working like crazy. I get the two same things more or less, and it really is all about the customization! My preferences are either: mocha slush with oreo, or strawberry lemon green tea with fig jelly. Even though I stick to what I know I like, sometimes the girls there will suggest I try a variation based on what I order and they're usually right! (That's how I started putting oreo in my mocha slush). Less ice, more ice, less sugar, little sugar, zero sugar, toppings and bubbles and jelly... there are so many options!The work area can be a nice little corner even when the line is long, and I've spent many hours there. Definitely try it even if you don't like the bubbles (like me!), but maybe don't go at rush hour (3-4pm) if you don't know what you want.
2017-03-28,4,Kung Fu Tea, you never disappoint. This location has even more arcane options than most, including "fig jelly" and "corn silk juice" (the latter, by the way, is very delicious). The staff tends to be slow most of the time, but they're all so sweet and likable it's hard to get annoyed at them. They also have speedy wifi and plenty of comfortable seating.
2017-03-08,4,I like coming here for bubble tea. Wish it was a little cheaper or have the price of the bubbles already be included in the listed price. I don't see other bubble tea shops charge extra for bubbles when its something that should be included.
2017-02-26,3,This place is cute and welcoming, but way overpriced. A green tea boba tea is $7+. I would be such a fan if it were a few dollars cheaper. They offered me a free sample of their corn juice. I thought they were joking but it was legitimately juiced corn! I'll stick with the boba.
2017-01-31,5,Always my go-to spot during warmer weather. I go with my best friend and we bring our dogs and sit outside. Always refreshing and delicious.
2017-01-16,5,An update review, yay.So, I still love bubble tea. I'm more of a person that only likes one flavor of something, so coconut bubble tea is the best. Tastes AWESOME! Also I've learned about punch cards, check in 10 times with it to get a free drink (yay!) Snow Creams, something added - I like it! It's so soft and it's like really creamy ice cream. I always add tapioca (since I love it! get Oreos the next time you get it). Great place, nice staff, great service, love this place. Definitely a must try.
2017-01-07,5,If you are an avid bubble tea drinker, I am sure you tried Kung Fu Tea somewhere as it is a popular chain.  I tried Kung Fu Tea on numerous occasions in Chinatown, Flushing, etc. and truth be told, I was not a huge fan so I was not excited when I saw this store opening in Hoboken.  I don't know what the other chains are doing wrong but this store's bubble tea is amazing!  This tops all KFT stores that I've been to and definitely tops all the other bubble tea places in Hoboken.  If you think you know Kung Fu Tea, you don't really know what they have until you visit here.  What I found is that.. it's not the item you order but the customization.   - I always order my drink with less or half sugar.  If you do not like sweet, go little sugar.  Wow Milk does not have sugar but has naturally sweetness in it.   - Black Milk Tea with Pudding - the pudding is more like custard jelly than pudding.  - Mung Bean Wow MilkIf you are not adventurous, Black Milk Tea is a safe drink.  Cheers!
2016-12-14,5,love, love, love. I've only been here once but I know I love it better than Vivi Bubble tea down the street. The bubble tea (taro, at least) taste better and employees are way nicer than Vivi.I love that you can customize your bubble tea here. My go to flavor is taro and I always get 0% sugar and it is still naturally sweet because of the taro powder.I'd love to try new flavors such as Oreo milk tea and the dessert menu next! Waffle & ice cream?!Also if you're a frequent costumer, make sure you get their stamp cards. 10 stamps = 1 free medium drink!
2016-11-04,4,Definitely a nice addition to Hoboken.  My go to is the milk green tea with herbal jelly.  Quick polite service and a nice spot to catch up with friends.  They have communal games which is a nice added touch when you are with others.  Cute decor.
2016-10-28,4,When I needed a boba fix I would go to this place and I need a fix almost everyday.  During my stint here, I wondered if the drinks were different than the one in Southern California.  Many have said the pizza in NY is way better than the pizza's in California because of the NY water.  Maybe the NY water would make NY boba's here better.  So, I tried many boba's and different boba shops.  I had milk tea's to regular teas.  My deduction?  I have no idea.  I just know they all tasted wonderful, in particular, KFT.  Plus, it was very close and convenient.  The reason why I like these drinks better than their competition was because the teas were more fragrant.  The boba's themselves were chewy and tastey.  Muy Bueno
2016-09-23,5,Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Teas are never too sweet. Great place to sit and hang for a while- they have outlets to charge your phone or laptop while you do work. Also, they have a selection of games which is fun sometimes. Kids love this spot. But it is also peaceful is you want to get work done. Highly recommend!!
2016-09-03,5,The tapionca is just how i like it here. Customer service is excellent they replaced a drink that didnt taste right.
2016-08-30,5,BEST SERVICE AND LOCATION FOR A BUBBLE TEA SPOT!!!The interior is inviting, the decor is very beautiful, they have free wifi and outlets everywhere. This place wants you here to hang out and enjoy yourself. There are also games and books in the back!
2016-08-22,5,If you love bubble tea, come here. If you've never tried it before, come here. If you're looking for something to do--well, you get the point. Kung Fu Tea is my go to bubble tea joint. I'll usually stop by for lunch (the rule of thumb is to order milk tea if you haven't eaten as they are more filling, and something like a punch tea if you want something lighter and more refreshing) or in between calls while volunteering at Hoboken ambulance corps to hold me over. The service is wonderful and they make great recommendations if you're thinking of trying something new. They're prompt with serving up your order, and don't forget to grab a punch card: buy ten and get a medium bubble tea for free! For one, what makes this place better than rest is the quality of ingredients: fresh juice in the grapefruit green tea or chunks of peaches in the peach oolong tea. Their almond milk tea ACTUALLY has a great sweet almond extract taste that many places fail to achieve and their passionfruit green tea is something wondrous and worth giving a shot. Another great thing about Kung fu, as echoed by other reviews, is the ability to adjust sugar levels as well as the amount of ice in your drink (no infamous Starbucks sized drinks where a small at DD gives you more than what you get in a "venti"). You can also add maya jelly, herbal jelly, red bean, mung bean or pudding to your drinks -- not that I've been adventurous enough to do so myself (yet!). Essentially, do yourself a favor a try this place out.
2016-08-12,5,Love it here...the honey black tea is AMAZING! Lots to choose from.
2016-07-24,5,Been coming since they opened a few months ago and now they have a frequent customers card. Buy 10 get 1 free.  Quality is always consistent with a great variety of different choices.  Store is clean and staff is nice and helpful.
2016-07-15,5,Dang, their bubbles are so good. I've tried so many of their delicious drinks and so far the only mistake I made was ordering the mango slush with too many add-ins (mango chunks, pudding AND bubbles). I would stick to one or *maybe* two next time.P.S. The milk cap options are salty. Be prepared if you're going to try them.
2016-06-30,5,My wife and I feel like we've paid rent here since it opened in Hoboken. It's become one of our favorite places to go. I'm a fan of the Peach Iced Tea with Bubble and my wife has tried pretty much every flavor imaginable and hasn't been disappointed yet. Vey traditional Bubble Tea place with excellent options and quite a variety.
2016-06-28,5,Love that you can adjust the sugar and ice level! Tapioca balls or what they call "bubbles" are consistently perfect. Always a pleasant experience here.
2016-06-11,5,The staff is very friendly! Place is clean and my grapefruit green tea with bubbles was bomb. Helen is great!
2016-06-10,4,I am admittedly a first-timer when it comes to bubble tea and had no idea what to expect. The inviting décor drew me in, and I did not leave disappointed. I've had Kung Fu Tea three times and somehow walked out with a different finished product each time thinking it would be the same, but to no one's fault but my own--I really have no idea what I'm doing. I explained to the girl behind the counter what I liked, and they did the rest. The tea is incredibly fresh, and the bubbles are just the right consistency. My one recommendation is if you're not a fan of overly sweet tea, say so. Very accommodating, cute place. Will be back.
2016-05-30,3,Has very clean facilities as it is a relatively new place. Kung fu tea is a chainstore that offers different variations on traditional bubble tea. You're also able to adjust the amount of sugar you would like in your tea which is a plus. I personally got the Oreo milk bubble tea which I thought was very unique. It was decent as it was the first time I tried it but it's definitely not something I would get frequently because of how sugary it is. I had also tried the taro milk tea with the "little sugar" setting but it still came out to be really sweet- it's as good as the traditional milk tea they have in Hong Kong but if you're looking to try something new, I suppose this place should suffice.
2016-05-23,5,Hurray! ...another Asian drink establishment in Hoboken. I was so delighted to see this bubble tea venue that opened 1 month ago in hobo. We ordered a hot black milk tea 50% less sweet and it was delicious. Not overly floral, not overly perfumy, not overly sweet and with a deep and delicious tea flavor. I would definitely come here again. Other excellent options for black milk tea are Vivi and Phonomenon; I'm not a Bene tea fan. I feel the black tea among Hoboken locations is best here actually as it has great depth of flavor without being overly perfumy. I like the natural wood decor. Too bad they don't make Asian snacks too.
2016-05-21,5,Their Mango Slush, Honey Lemonade, and Strawberry Lemon Green Tea, all with bubbles are all great!  I'm not actually much of a tea person so I end up getting the least-tea-like options, which I can say are good.  Sometimes it takes them a while to get the tea, other times not so much, but it doesn't take them an excessive amount of time considering bubble tea is a process.  Nice seating area it seems like and the desserts look like they'd be good to try!
2016-05-03,5,Pretty awesome bubble tea place. I really like how they cooked the bubbles - just the right softness and chewiness with a gentle sweet taste in it. The price is better than Vivi a few blocks away. The regular bubble tea starts at $3.50, same at both places (Kung Fu charges the drink and the bubbles separately). Then the upgrade to a large costs 75c at Kung Fu vs $1 at Vivi. The difference is small, but multiplied by how many you buy, lol.Vivi offers ramen noodles and other snacks. Kung Fu has a few cake varieties, but no hot food and nothing that would pass as a meal (unless you eat bubbles for dinner...) so in that sense the menu is more limited.
2016-05-03,5,Yes yes yes!!!!! Just what we needed in mid-town Hoboken!!! I'm hooked. First of all I love how you can customize how much sugar, ice etc. for your tea! A ton of flavors and beverage options! I got a large taro tea w/ bubble little sugar and ice...it was so refreshing! I'll be here at least a few times a week. Also they have a cute area for sitting with free wifi!! Love it.
2016-05-01,5,Run, sprint, drive over the speed limit, take a helicopter, hop on a yacht. . . get to this KFT now.This place just opened.  It's fresh out the oven newness from my fave bubble tea brand.  I no longer need to trek up to Fort Lee or out to NYC for my fix.And the tea?  Simply the best.  You know if it's KFT they using real tea, you have entered a no powder zone.  Get. The. Milk. Cap.  It's salty and what my life has been missing thus far.  The actual bubbles are chewy and I suspect they are soaked in brown sugar because they are sweet.Mirrors and wood adorn the inside.  Decorated like a temple, this location is particularly beautiful and has 3 separate seating areas.Will be back, maybe tomorrow night. The boba addiction is real.
2016-04-30,5,So you've had bubble tea before? Well if you've never tried Kung Fu Tea their different! Instead of using powdered sugary artificial tea flavoring they are known for using real tea leaves brewed daily. Their oolong, green, and jasmine at least. The other artificial flavors like taro, lychee, mango etc are exactly that artificial flavoring. It's the best bubble tea chain in my opinion and I really enjoy ViVi too but real tea takes the win. Highly recommend adding pudding to any cold tea! Many of my friends can't get used to the consistency of the pudding but its worth a try I promise! Service is fast considering how busy they get. Only con is the a large drink can be equivalent to a venti starbucks at $5.50- $5.75 which is pricey considering its just tea. Treat yo self :) Favorites- Iced oolong milk tea w/ pudding, bubbles, half sugar (pudding is sweet enough)- Hot almond milk tea w/ bubbles, half sugar (bubbles are sweet too!)- Iced green tea jasmine milk tea w/ bubbles- Taro Slush w/ bubbles
2016-04-26,1,After reading the reviews I had high expectation of this place. Turns out these reviews seems more likely written by friends to help boost sale. The bubble I had were undercooked and tough. The taro tea was nothing special. Pretty generic. This place i not comparable to the other bubble tea chains.  Not even close. I haven't try the other toppings and probably won't based on how the bubbles were. Plus they don't sell food but the cakes I might be back for even though  they probably just order it through a bakery and mark it up.
2016-04-23,4,Very happy to see an Asian bubble tea joint open up in Hoboken. We don't have one here and frankly all the coffee cafes and coffee drinking can't be good for us...The staff are very friendly. This shop just opened this week and the staff have that newly opened shop energy. I love it. Now they have great selection - oolong tea and other teas infused with juice flavored such as peach. In addition you can add milk to it - sadly they don't have soy milk. You can also add tapioca bubbles or pearls to it - hence the name of "true pearl milk tea". (珍珠奶茶)If you haven't tried bubble tea before this is a good one place to start.
2016-04-23,5,Decided to stop here after our Saturday morning brunch for a tea fix. From the young lady pouring the free samples to the cashier, the staff was very friendly. I ordered the Taro Milk Tea with "half sugar" and Tapioca. My boyfriend ordered the Coconut Milk Tea with "little sugar" and Tapioca. Both were really good and very refreshing but I did prefer his over mine not because of the flavor but because of the sweetness. I'd recommend ordering with little or maybe even no sugar. All in all, great flavor. I'll definitely be back during their Grand Opening promotion 4/29 - 5/3 when select drinks are Buy 1 Get 1 Free.
2016-04-19,5,I ordered my favorite green milk tea from them i was very pleased with the quality of the drink and everyone seem very friendly i will definitely come back for more :)
2016-04-18,4,Great drink choice. Got the Kung fu milk tea and it is great I prefer a little less sweet. Only thing is the line was long when I was there. It is their pre opening and so not all item is available.
2016-04-18,5,Came to visit a friend and stop by at this place for a drink. Not officially open yet but they have free sample, tried the passionfruit green tea and it is very refreshing.. Cute Tea-tender LOL... He is very helpful with recommending us other drinks.. We can request for less sugar which is a plus.
2016-04-18,4,Not bad bubble tea but not as good as Coco's.  They are 2nd on my book after Coco's.  Cheaper than Caffe Bene and Paris Baguetter and way better than Vivi bubble tea. You can add pudding, 2 types of jelly, extra tapioca pearls, mung beans, red beans in your drink.You can adjust the sweetness level to:Less Sugar (70%) Half Sugar (50%) Little Sugar (30%) No Sugar (0%)Ice Levels to:Less IceLittle IceNo IceWarmIf milk tea is not your "thang" then you can opt for a coffee (mostly iced but I'm sure you can ask for hot) or slush.Great options, not bad price
