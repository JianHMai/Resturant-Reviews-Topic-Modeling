2021-10-19,5,Lovely spot to grab coffee! Very comfy on the inside and the coffee has been delicious. Looking forward to trying some of their featured flavors.
2021-10-09,5,Love this gem of a coffee shop!!! So chill, good service, great coffee, yummy treats. It's quickly becoming my new favorite!!!
2021-09-23,2,Very friendly service. This is my usual coffee spot but they seem to have some new baristas recently, the last two espresso drinks I've bought here were pretty bad. Milk on the lattes tasted burnt and the froth on the cappuccino was lumpy, rough and uneven. Worse than Starbucks and Dunkin! Will probably switch to the cold brews and other non-mixed drinks from now on. Wi-Fi is available but spotty during busy times. They also have a nice selection of pastries.
2021-09-19,5,Mojo coffee is the BEST in Hoboken! Their maple cold brew is out of this world. From the staff to the Decor, it is nothing short of perfection. Great way to start the day, thank you Mojo coffee!!
2021-07-30,4,I stopped into Mojo Coffee Company recently and was thrilled with their fast and friendly service.  The MOJO House Blend was also more rich and flavorful than traditional house varieties.  My boyfriend gave his Flat White two thumbs up also.
2021-07-13,5,Its safe to say that this place WOWWED me! Walked in one day with a friend and was SHOCKED by how cute, trendy and modern the inside of this place is. They've got a simplistic menu hanging on the wall, just enough greenery spread around, a few seats by their giant window and a comfy couch with a cute background.I got the lavender latte and it was perfect. Not too sweet, but just right! I've never had a lavender latte before and this place totally made me want to get it at other places. There's some outdoor seating available as well, if you wanna grab a coffee and enjoy it on a beautiful day. Prices are similar to your other local coffee shops/starbucks -- but the sizes ate definitely bigger than starbucks. Service is SO nice, the staff is amazingly nice, they wear masks and they offer you great suggestions when you ask. They also sell a ton of their products and have them on display close to the wall menu. It's so tempting to just pick up something (and I think it's a good idea to, if you're in the mood to support this local business), I love to grab a candy or something whenever I can. Last time they had some good popcorn, so I scooped that up for some coworkers. It's a great coffee joint and worth checking out!
2021-07-02,5,Hands down best coffee in Hoboken! The staff is very friendly, went in for a quick coffee/espresso to recharge wish I could of ordered a XXXL cup but amazing
2021-06-22,5,Best coffee shop in Hoboken, Sam is so helpful and Tony is fast and friendly! Best coffee and best vibe.
2021-05-15,5,We are down the block and love having mojo as our daily go to coffee place! Loving the spring menu with the blackberry mocha and lavender matcha latte. The staff there are also so friendly - I completely forgot what I ordered one early morning and even though I ordered something completely different, they just made me the drink I thought i ordered! I was fine with the drink I actually ordered by accident but the gesture was greatly appreciated!
2021-05-12,5,Mojo Coffee Company wowed me on my first visit!    It's interior is set up with a modern feel, a few seats, and cute aesthetics for pics " Ok, but first coffee". :) I scoped the place out and wanted to try two things: the iced vanilla latte (w/ oat milk) and one of their pastries ( I went for lemony poppy).I would go back for both items. The pastry was not overly sweet and tasted super fresh. The latte was perfect. Good balance of vanilla syrup, milk, and the espresso shots. Friendly staff  that is adhering to covid precautions. They also have plenty of outdoor seating! Go check them out!
2021-04-01,5,MOJO It is a drink is exquisite in a place pleasant cozy atmosphere clean and tidy in all hoboken what more can you say
2021-03-29,5,Favorite coffee joint in Hoboken by far! Their cold brew is delicious and they always have delicious treats. My favorite is the Everything Croissant with cream cheese on the weekend :) Highly recommend!
2021-01-28,5,Love this place!! The maple latte brought me back to Vermont but sadly it's seasonal always super quick service, great coffee
2021-01-24,5,We love mojo! It's the perfect walk on a Sunday morning for coffee with the dog. They still have tables set up outside even though it's freezing haha with heating lamps if you want to stay longer than a few minutes. The lattes are generally perfect. Not too sweet when you add a flavor. The espressos the right amount of strong. Has become a bit of a weekend routine. One of my favorite things about Hoboken is being able find new coffee shops it's an added bonus when it's close enough to walk the dog. Mojos one we've found ourselves going back to again and again. The baristas are always sweet. And sometimes they have delicious little muffins you can indulge with. Most importantly the coffee has disappointed.
2020-12-29,5,Mojo is incredible! Easily my favorite coffee place in NJ. The lattes are amazing, coffee blends are delicious, the coffee cake is so good and the chocolate covered popcorn is ADDICTING. So addicting that I ordered 8 bags to give to everyone I was gifting for the holidays! The owners are also very kind and helpful.
2020-12-21,5,Ordered 35 bags of the most delicious popcorn from Mojo Coffee Company for gift bags and guests this holiday season! This sweet and salty popcorn is mouth watering -- as soon as I tasted it I was hooked! All of your family and friends will love it!  Make sure you buy/order enough for yourself too
2020-11-15,4,Cute coffee shop right near the park! They have good coffee and seasonal drinks/flavors and all kinds of milk.
2020-11-11,5,Alejandro and the Mojo team are 10/10. Great coffee, great service, worth the $. This is my new local spot! I will certainly be back- great lattes
2020-11-09,5,The maple chai tea latte here changed my life. I've always been a chai drinker and can promise you I have a short list of my go to chai spots in Hoboken - this one blew it away. First - I always feel safe when I come here. The space is clean, tables are spacious and the safe is following all the COVID protocols. While you do order inside, your order is ready for pick up in moments to get you back out and moving. If the weather permits they also leave the door open. Second - I've had excellent recommendations from the staff here on multiple occasions. They're knowledgeable and you should feel confident they know how how to give five star service. Third - they have a lovely outdoor space. Heaters are provided. I love working here during the day and hope to as long as the weather is nice!
2020-11-05,4,Nice people, really cute spot, pumpkin cake was yummy & my chai latte was decent (let it be known I am a harsh chai latte critic!) However, if you are coming to do work/study be aware that the wifi is spotty. But, it is a super great place if you want to just grab and go coffee or enjoy it with someone. I'm happy a new coffee shop was added downtown & I'll definitely head there again for a coffee date with someone.
2020-09-29,5,Cold brew is smooth, not bitter, and perfect! The women that work there are so nice too!
2020-09-20,4,Big fan because this is a bomb coffee spot that is super super close to the my place of work so I love it. It has a great selection of classic coffee drinks and some seasonal specialty drinks which are delicious. Small selection of pastries and snacks available as well. I would definitely recommend a visit here if in the area.
2020-09-13,5,We found this place by chance after having trekked to another local coffee joint and realizing it had closed early.  I'm glad we found this place because I think it will become a regular local favorite.We were greeted by a friendly barista and upon entering, we immediately noticed how modern, light, and beautifully decorated the place was (Very Instagram-able).  I tried their caramel latte which was delicious. As for seating, they've set up a few outdoor tables.  There's also the park a block down.Definitely would come back to try other drinks here!
2020-08-29,5,Delicious vanilla cold brew greeted with a smile (behind the mask)! Their cinnamon loaf is also A+, moist and delicious! Ate it before I even took a photo
2020-08-21,5,Stopped in today and tried the light roast large iced sugar free vanilla latte with almond milk and it is delicious! I'm not much of a fan of the dark roast it turns out. Cara was super helpful today and excellent with customers! I love her energy! I also ordered my boyfriend the cold brew and he loves it. Love the location.
2020-08-06,5,This place is great! Owner also owns Zach's next door which we love. They make all the great coffee drinks, staff is really friendly and they make a great flatwhite w/oat milk which is always my coffee-snob test. Support local business!
2020-07-30,5,People working there were so kind and helpful. My coffee was great and the cinnamon walnut cake is a must try! So delicious. Will definitely be going back.
2020-07-23,4,Very good coffee. Some of the baristas struggle with attention to detail with the order taking but to be expected from a new place. A welcome addition to the community. My only real issue is that the iced coffee lids leak, i wouldn't trust going there in nice clothes or on the move. I always have to transfer it into another cup when i get home. I've mentioned this to staff and it's not getting better.
2020-07-16,5,It was my first time at Mojo and I have to say that was arguably the best cold brew I've ever had.  The service was great and I loved the overall vibe. Will definitely be making Mojo Coffee Company more of a regular stomping ground now!
2020-07-05,4,Nice decor, friendly staff with all basic coffee and tea options. We got iced Espresso and latte, liked both drinks. They have an option to pick roast for even espresso which i think is really unique. I will definitely recommend this place.
2020-07-02,5,What a wonderful little coffee shop! I was welcomed by the very friendly staff who were very helpful to recommend the delicious vanilla cold brew. The atmosphere of the shop is adorable and perfect for remote working or a study break. I also had a slice of the walnut coffee cake which was delicious!
2020-06-30,5,Recently visited Mojo and fell in love. Between the cute modern aesthetic and the yummy chai tea latte, this will definitely be my new neighborhood spot. Highly recommend to anyone who is looking to support local!
2020-06-30,5,So excited to have a new coffee shop on Willow Ave! The cold brew is perfect and they have both dairy and non dairy milk! It was super smooth and just right-not too strong. Perfect for that AM or afternoon pick me up! Love the interior as well- A simple and modern feel and that neon sign!! It's a very convenient and great location to stop by on the way to Washington St., the Path or even the Dog Park. Highly recommend!
2020-06-27,5,this place is dope. the people who work there are so friendly and sweet. coffee is great. a hidden gem for sure.
2020-06-21,5,I haven't yet stepped inside but my husband ran in, while I waited in the car, for two cold brew coffees today and yesterday. WOW. So good. I don't post often but I LOVE my coffee and the strength of the cold brew here is remarkable. We live uptown but will continue to come out of our way for this. So good. Lots of luck to the owners!! Thank you for making my weekend (still enjoying and sipping my drink)!
2020-06-19,4,I wanted to support more local coffee shops because of the pandemic. So glad that a new one opened up in Hoboken!We got the iced chai and iced latte. They were both great drinks. I saw the coffee cake on their Instagram and definitely wanted to try it. It was so moist and delicious--definitely give it a try. The inside was also super cute and Instagrammable. They have cute merch too.
2020-06-10,5,I've been here twice already and definitely plan on returning soon. The staff is friendly and the decor is fun. They make a great flat white! Check it out.
2020-06-03,5,Went here this morning for their opening and it's so cute!! I got the cold brew which was delicious and my husband got the iced latte which came out great. They left their tables and chairs up for aesthetic which will be so cute to sit in once things open back up. I'm very lucky about my cold brew but this place has one of the best in town already!
