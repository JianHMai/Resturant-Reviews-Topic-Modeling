2021-10-27,5,I want here on a first day and the food was delicious. They have an array of sauces for you to dip your meats in and plenty of choices for you to choose from meats. Also the sides were delicious I do recommend they are corn pudding side I do believe. It was so delicious and sweet. Also, it's by the waterfront so it's great to take a stroll after a day. I do recommend this place if you are on a budget I want tasty  food and a great view
2021-10-24,1,This was among the worst bbq I've ever had. It was bland and fatty and everything (the pulled pork, mac & cheese, and cornbread) tasted the same. They forgot by Texas BBQ Beans, which was one of the sides that was supposed to be included.
2021-10-17,2,The worst bbq I've had since moving to Jersey. They're ribs were a 2 out of 10 at best and their sausage was underwhelming.Their cornbread pudding was delicious though. I enjoyed that and only that!
2021-10-15,1,This is a little late (okay VERY late) but...The kicker is that we walked about 3 blocks away and had the best meal at Zero Otto Uno Cafe on Washington Street. Some of our party decided to part ways due to the delay/disaster at House of Que so it ended up being just 8 of us left. The staff of Zero Otto Uno Cafe literally MADE space for us as their sidewalk seating was mostly occupied when we arrived. So, they brought tables from inside the restaurant and set them up adjacent to the seating area that already had outside. Talk about going the extra mile...especially when House of Que seemed to go out of their way to NOT seat us!
2021-10-02,1,This place has been reported to the Better Business Bureau of New Jersey. They blatantly lie to your face and say there is a "$50 minimum to get a table by the live music"  when we confirmed and said "$50 a table we can do that" we are not corrected. When it came time to get the bill we were told we did not reach the minimum and we had to spend $200 ( there was 6 of us total) and they said it was "$50 a person". Since we were almost at $200 we said we would order another round to reach it. When we ordered the next round the waitress said "sorry I hate to do this but you actually have to meet a minimum of $320. At this point we called them out on this scam and the "security" came to "talk" to us ... he tried to rough us up and scare us into paying. We finally came to an "agreement" that we would pay $250 because we did not want to cause any problems. This place is a complete scam and needs to be investigated and honestly shut down. Do not go here. Very disgusted by what happened...
2021-09-20,3,Meats are quite good, especially the brisket. However, it's definitely more expensive than usual. I guess they have to pay more for the location. But overall great experience between the view, atmosphere and foods.Will come back again once for a while to enjoy the atmosphere. Would not come too often for sure based on the price.
2021-09-07,1,While we had a great time, and the view was great, I though the food was borderline inedible.  I don't know if everything had vinegar in it, but the smell was off and the food did not taste fresh. We tried just about all the smoked meats- even the chicken- and it also had an awful, almost turned type flavor. Some of the worst barbecue I have ever eaten.
2021-09-05,4,We came here on a Saturday night for dinner and it was pretty packed. We got the 48 hour smoked wings to start and they were really juicy and the bbq sauce was sweet. For the main course, we got 1/2 pound of brisket and 1/2 pound of pork ribs and a medium texas slaw. The brisket and pork ribs were really tender and went great with the bbq sauce. The texas slaw I wasn't a big fan of just because I usually like my cole slaw sweeter. We also got drinks and they were really tasty.The ambiance of this place is great. There was live music and the performers were great! I would definitely come back here again when I'm craving barbeque.
2021-09-04,3,I came here with my family for a birthday celebration. I am not usually a huge fan of BBQ food, as I am not one that can eat a whole lot of meats. I am more of a sides kind of gal. We came here on a recommendation and for starters, the vibe, views, and atmosphere was really spot on. We decided to dine outside, and the weather was just perfect for it. The views are also spectacular as it was by the water.We ordered the loaded nachos, the smoked wings, and egg rolls. The loaded nachos were mediocre, it was not anything too special, but the portions were decently sized. The wings were def. smokey and really flavorful; however, we had hoped the meat would be a bit more juicy/tender, which was not. The egg rolls were really good, it was crunchy/flakey and the filling as cheesy. For the mains, we got the Pitmaster's Pick, which contained 1 lb of brisket, 4 ribs, 4 sausages, 1/2 smoked chicken, with a side of mac n cheese and collard greens. The meats (brisket, chicken, ribs) were generally very dry and lacked the smokey flavor. It did not appear to be smoked and the brisket especially did not have that "fall apart" factor. The meats were nevertheless "alright" in overall flavor, but the texture was lacking. The prices for the food was a bit high as well, and while we did not mind paying a higher price, the food quality did not meet those standards.
2021-08-28,5,Their BBQ is my favorite. This is the spot I bring all my friends when they ask me to recommend a place for a group gathering. Brisket, fire. Ribs, fire. Pulled pork? Fire. Go. You will not be disappointed.
2021-08-15,5,Got really excited when I learned of this local BBQ spot near me. It might be my new go-to favorite spot in Hoboken. The great live music, the outstanding food, and the skyline views along the water on the summer night made for a solid night out. Was it the absolute best BBQ I've ever had? No, I can't say it was. But it was good and the whole experience was worth the money overall. The server, Melissa, was an absolute gem. Good vibes all around. We're definitely excited to bring company here when they visit.
2021-08-04,3,Came here with a party of three on a Thursday night and they had trivia inside but we wanted to sit outside by the water. Maybe it was because we were the last table but our service was horrible. Our server came by probably once every 30 minutes and was impossible to wave down. We ordered the pitmaster's pick which was more than enough food for three people plus leftovers. The ribs and brisket were decently tender but not incredibly flavorful. The sausage was ok, nothing special and the chicken was incredibly dry. The corn pudding was by far the standout and best of the sides with the brisket chili also being good but nothing super special. I would pass on the mac 'n cheese and potato salad - you can find better at the grocery store. Overall, the location is nice and would probably be fun to come for trivia but don't expect much from the food or service.
2021-07-27,1,We got unnecessarily excited upon finding this place. We are from Austin and miss real true southern flavors- we saw Austin BBQ, read the pit masters credentials, and that's where we should've known... it was too good to be true. The decor is very Texas... But, the meat is not. It does not appear to be smoked and if it is... it's not properly done. Meat is overcooked, chewy, and somehow flavorless - It is not fall apart or melt in the mouth. You cannot smell the pit at all, which makes us wonder - is there one? The prices are high (and not worth it), the food is not hot... it's barely room temperature. We got the "18 hour smoked" brisket - overcooked, no flavor, lots of fat, and chewy... The "local Texas" sausage was WAY overcooked - maybe they cook that for 18 hours? The collard greens are not anything more than chopped up greens in some oil and cooked.Pickles are store bought, jalapeños are pickled, pricey, and not spicy. Corned pudding & Slaw were the most decent sides. Sadly, we learned the answer to "why would a good BBQ place be in Hoboken?" (Spoiler, if there is, this is not it). And that credentials on paper mean nothing if it can't be executed in real life. The search for BBQ on the east coast continues.Can't recommend this place to anyone.
2021-07-21,5,My friends and I made a reservation for 20 with Natalie. She was very sweet and helpful. The night was a blast. We all loved the drinks and food. Must go for BBQ!
2021-07-04,4,Very Busy place, but the food is Delicious! We ordered the BBQ wings, HOQ salad & 1/2 chicken with Mac & cheese & sweet potato fries. It took a while to get our food. Approximately 30-40 minutes after ordering. My husband received his food  first.  However, the rest of my party received our food 10 minutes later. The service was pretty slow but our waitress was very nice.
2021-06-26,5,Great atmosphere to sit outside on the weekend. Being from Texas I was so happy to find a good BBQ place near me. Great selection of food and the drinks are on point. Ask for Jon or Vanessa because they are the top notch servers
2021-06-24,5,I've been to House of Que 5 times and I've had a wonderful experience every single time. I am not even a huge meat/BBQ eater but the food here is so good and so is the 512 sauce which I would eat just by itself if possible. The sides are all delicious but the corn pudding is above and beyond. I dream about it, I think about it all the time, I wish I was eating it right now. I don't even have photos of the food because I eat it all so quickly my brain doesn't have time to process the idea of taking a photo. I've also had a GREAT time at Dueling Pianos (I'm the nerd asking for them to play Hamilton.) I highly recommend stopping by!
2021-06-10,1,If you're looking for good BBQ please turn away! I ordered the ribs which were over cooked and no flavor! The Mac and cheese was served cold! My friend got a burger medium and it was charred and dry! Which was $18 dollars. The 48 hour wings had no flavor whatsoever so I highly doubt they were smoked for 48 hours!
2021-05-26,1,Ordered for the first time yesterday. The presentation was on point! The food looked amazing. However, when I took a bite it was disgusting. They don't season the food at all. No dry rub, just charred meat. The Mac and cheese was great! The Texas beans were God awful and had chunks in them, never seen baked beans like that.
2021-05-22,3,This a great place if you like your beer warm and your BBQ cold. The place says something about Austin in their name. If I was Austin I'd get an injunction. What did Austin do to you that you would sully their name so badly. Has anyone at House of Que been to Austin? I'm not sure how the kitchen fell apart. The pork belly appetizer was great. Queso perfect. Service great. But when it came to the main event, BBQ,  it was like the whole kitchen went out for a smoke. The brisket sandwich was so cold that I asked the server it it was supposed to be cold because it seemed intentional it was so cold.  I mean what do I know, that could be their thing, right?  She said no and immediately tried to correct the issue. A few minutes later, a new sandwich comes out with out the chill on it but still cold. Maybe that's how you're supposed to order it...I'll have the brisket sandwich without the chill. Now I'm having trust issues at this place. I'm guessing, no thermometers? Having issues working an open flame? IDK. What I do know is that hot food should be served hot and cold food should be cold. Simple. When it comes out somewhere in between I feel like someone is daring me to eat it. Like, the kitchen is telling me I don't know right from wrong, dangerous from safe. With respect to all the other types of cuisines on the face of the earth, BBQ has got to be in the top 5 of easiest things to do, except in Hoboken at the House of Que. I feel bad. People want to come out.  People need to get back to work and start making some money.  And this place had the business but the kitchen was asleep at the wheel. They ended up taking the sandwiches off the bill but 2 appetizers, one side of fries, 2 beers and one Texas mule, 60 bucks. Then I got it! On the way out I look around and my wife and I were the only schmoes who had been eating. So, jokes on me. They don't really want to sell food. Their not kidding anybody except people who are not from Hoboken. It's alright. They got me once, you know what I mean. And if anyone in the kitchen gets a whiff of this just know it is super disrespectful to your coworkers to put their livelihood at risk because you don't feel like doing your job properly. Yous should be changing tires on the Parkway.
2021-05-02,2,This place is extremely over priced for just ok food that usually arrives cold. It was pretty decent when it opened, but COVID has not been kind to it. The meat was tough and under flavored. The service was slow. Bright side, the sides are still pretty good.
2021-05-01,2,Well I can say probably won't return here, VERY over priced. Before we even get to price our party was already turned off as we approached the podium to be seated we were not greeted warmly, as we felt like what do you want, later I was told the guy was a manager named Zeus that was covering the podium 5/1 late afternoon...as I was not in a mood to make this a race thing I proceeded and decided to see how this played out. One thing these establiments need to realize is you never know WHO is walking thru your doors...well today it was a YELPER & a Google Review Guru with over 2.5 MILLION views of my pic's etc. So after the rude approach upon seating us, we were seated and not really feeling the seating we asked if we could change the young man said oh you have to ask the guy at the podium..after how we felt.. I refused and was annoyed as we asked you and you work there and I need you to go inquire for me as a customer. We moved. Vanessa came and introduced herself she was nice and professional- Service was ok. Food was Super overpriced and we ordered these "48 hour wings" which were OK, tasted like the same wings I make in my air fryer and 6 wings for 14.00? Air fryer wings?? The Cowgirl drink was nice. We ordered burgers and fries. Burger was good and flavorful. Our bill was 140.00.3 drinks, 3 meals, & 6 wings & order or fries. The liquor store and Five Guys may have been a cheaper option LOL  #YOLOI will need a redo of my B day Kick Off...smh
2021-04-17,4,This is a half a pound of brisket ($16). It's three pieces. Sides were one cup each ($6 each). You should go with the single meat plate and two sides for ($23) it's the same amount of food.
2021-04-16,1,Awful service and do not follow COVID restrictions. Do not recommend at all would leave zero stars if possible
2021-03-18,3,Climatic view, lackluster que.I'm gonna keep it straight up, I was really disappointed with the food. From what I got, this is an excellent spot to listen to some country, have some drinks and look at the skyline. And I would definitely come back for just that. But to spend a good bit of money on the barbecue again, I don't think so.We started off with pork belly and 48 hour smoked wings. The pork belly was pretty good and left me expecting a bar to be hit by the other food. More like 48 minute smoked wings...the wings barely had a smokey flavor and I felt they just dumped sweet baby Ray bbq sauce on top of it. The texture was no good either. For entree we had brisket, which was very very dry. The pulled pork really didn't have much of a taste either. To sum it up... the bbq we ordered felt like it came from a restaurant that doesn't specialize in bbq! This was a first to me when the bbq at a bbq spot was not more than good. The Mac and cheese too...smh.
2021-03-06,1,Great views but that's about it. Food is mediocre and Covid guidelines are laughable. Singing, pianos and dancing during a pandemic. Fully packed indoors and outdoors.
2021-02-28,5,This place has great live music and an amazing staff. I never write reviews but the staff was so good that I had to. They went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and asked if we wanted them to tell creepy, unwanted guys lingering at our table to take a hike. Fries were great and they had hand sanitizers on every table. We will be back!!
2021-02-23,5,Love this place. The atmosphere is fun. The hostesses and the girls who took care of us were great. Food is delicious. If you've lived in the south and have been craving biscuits and gravy, this place does a great job of it as part of their weekend brunch. Check them out, you won't be disappointed.
2021-02-21,4,Made reservations for a Saturday night, to come to this restaurant with my girlfriend.  We were in the mood for some BBQ food, and this place had the best reviews in our area. I had been here once before years ago, but this was my girlfriends first time. We got lucky and got parking right outside this place. Once we were seated, we started with some drinks and ordered the Chipotle BBQ Wings. I had an ipa beer to start and my girlfriend got a mixed drink. The wings were excellent. We loved them so much. The meat was cooked perfectly, nice sized wings, and the chipotle BBQ flavor on them was so good. After a second round of drinks, we then put in our order for our main meal. We ordered a BBQ combo platter of different meats and sides. We went with the brisket, pulled pork, bbq beans, slaw, and mac n cheese.  My favorites from this was the brisket and the bbq beans. The brisket was amazing.  So good.  The pulled pork was pretty decent as well.  We enjoyed all of our sides. Everything was really good. We had such a great time here. We would definitely come back for some more bbq options.
2021-02-18,5,Wings and nachos are top notch stuff. Great specials for large parties too and Trivia on Tuesdays!
2021-02-16,5,I came here with 5 of my closest friends for my birthday this past weekend and it was such an amazing time. My boyfriend and I chose this place to celebrate because we've came here before and were accommodated so nicely by the most generous staff, note: we traveled in from Staten Island to see Dualing Pianos. The piano show was so much fun! The food was outstanding, we loved the wings. They offer a beer tower which we refilled a few times and it worked nicely for a table of a bigger party. I have to say, Natalie (the woman who I was in contact with for about a month re: the reservation) was so kind and knowledgeable via email and each email I sent received a quick response. Our waitress Mel was very patient with us and a lot of fun, the manager Chris came up to our table to thank us for coming. All in all - excellent experience, yet again.
2021-02-14,1,Very disappointed in the service my group received. Considering the amount of money our large group spent, you'd think we would have been treated better. We made reservations in advance to make sure the night of would be enjoyable and stress free as we were there celebrating a birthday. We requested far in advance that our tables be placed next to each other and we were told by the women in charge of reservations that we were all set and that it wasn't a problem. Of course when we arrive we find our tables were not placed next to each other as promised. When asked to switch tables we were told we weren't placed next to each other on purpose because they didn't want to have to yell at us to sit down the whole night....? Staff was very rude in this regard. Male host got aggressive and threatened to kick each person out if they were to stand up out of there seat... all because we asked to switch tables. We should have never been told in the first place that our tables would be next to each other if they weren't!!! Also it was never advertised that it was "UFC night" and that the TVs would be blasting. We couldn't hear the dueling pianos AT ALL from where our tables were placed. When asked if the TV volume could be lowered we were told "no it's ufc night" again, we were never told this. I was in contact, texting and emailing, the women in charge of reservations ALL WEEK to make sure we were set to have a fun night which we were extremely excited for.  Imagine our disappointment when everything we were promised by this women was not delivered whatsoever. I made it very clear we wanted to be next to each other and we were there for the dueling pianos. We should have been told from the start that the area we were being placed in was for "ufc night" and that we wouldn't be able to hear the pianos. We were given the run around by this women and were treated extremely poorly by the male host/manager the night of. Again you'd think they'd be nicer and more accommodating considering we were a large group giving them A LOT of business.
2021-02-05,4,This is definitely a spot for recent grads to hang out and drink. This isn't a family type restaurant. Food was ok, definitely a bit overpriced but it's in a prime location in Hoboken. Drinks are decent. Music was great ! I would come here if you're into a casual sports bar type vibe ! Restaurant is taking protocols for covid which is comforting.Overall, pretty decent spot.
2021-01-30,1,Avoid this place at all cost. This was the worst place I have ever been to. Location is the only thing going for this place. The service was the worst I have ever experienced. Do not see Vanessa. The food took long and was not good I ended up just throwing it away. Drinks were horrible server kept talking to my guest and not me even though I was paying and made the reservations and all. I was excited to get bbq after moving here a month ago from down south. But this was a huge disappointment. I should have paid on my credit card so I could have disputed the charges. Do yourself a favor do not go there.
2021-01-24,5,We had my daughter's 5th bday "party" (my family + my sister's) here and it was the perfect place! Natalie who is in charge of their events replied back to my reservation request immediately and made sure our request for 2 tables was met. They allowed us to have a banner and balloons and made us feel welcome the whole time. Special shout-out to our rockstar server Vanessa, who made sure everything went well, and her upbeat attitude livened up the "party". The food was great as always. Thanks to the entire crew at House of Que Hoboken!
2021-01-23,1,Probably the worst host I've seen to set people in an empty restaurant next to the door when it's close to 30 degrees outside. Went to celebrate a birthday on a Friday night instead got sat close by the door. When asked to sit in a both the guy ran up to the hostess to seat in a high top table. When neither of us wanted to sit there. When asked if we can sit in a booth was told they were all reserved by people with a reservation. I myself had a reservation but was not able to sit there. Thanks to that terrible/worst host that sat us. We bothered not to celebrate there. Other than that the food and waitresses that served on us were amazing. If only that guy wasn't there to ruin our celebration night.
2021-01-21,5,Unfortunately I did not get to take photos because I was too busy eating so fast! I had a very smooth experience here. My party was seated quickly on a weekday at 6pm since it was empty there. They seat people at every other booth to make distance, which was great. The staff was so friendly! The manager (I think) went and helped out at our table and was made jokes that kept us entertained and our waitress was really sweet. She suggested a drink that I really liked.For my meal, I had the 'Que Burger with curly fries. Very juicy and flavored burger. I hadn't had curly fries in a long time so I was excited. For drinks I got the Drunken Cowboy and the peach mule. Both fruity and the mule tasted herbal-y which I liked a lot. Def going back! Also so convenient since it's a 5 min walk from the Hoboken lightrail station.
2021-01-16,4,I attempt to sample BBQ from any smokehouse or pit I can. I'm big into the food and culture of BBQ, often spending hours smoking meats at home. Needless to say, it's a major hobby of mine. House of Que was a place I stumbled upon accidentally. It has ample seating, a great beer selection, and friendly staff. Their house BBQ sauce is quite good. Us, loving BBQ, did the smoked wings as an appetizer and the Pitmaster's Pick. The wings were excellent. The sampler was also quite good. The sausage was excellent, as were the ribs. The brisket was a bit dry, in my opinion. As for sides, we did the beans, Mac and cheese, and chili. All were excellent, but the chili was our favorite of the group. Overall, I plan to visit again and would recommend it. Authentic BBQ flavor in Jersey.
2021-01-09,5,If I could give more than 5 stars I would. I can't begin to tell you how fantastic this place was between the food, drinks, and the superior customer service. Our waitress Vanessa was awesome! She made sure we were very well taken care of as well as the manager Chris. He and Vanessa made me and my girlfriend feel like family even though it is our first time here. We most certainly will be coming back to enjoy another great experience at the House of Que. To Vanessa and Chris, keep up the fantastic work! This can't be topped by anyone else!
2020-12-30,2,The food is okay. Brisket was super dry. Sausage is disgusting. Mac & Cheese were basically buttered noddles, no cheese or flavor. Potato Salad was super dry. The only good thing was the egg rolls appetizer. Drinks had absolutely no alcohol in them. Disappointed.
2020-12-29,1,Absolutely awful food and the place is extremely dirty. Steer clear of this place 100%
2020-12-21,5,First time my girlfriend went out for a while and decided to watch some football. So many screens to watch for which was super clutch. The food was sooo good i definitely recommend their nachos and wings. A lot of beer options and the staff is so friendly
2020-11-30,5,Had some really good BBQ with terrific service. Plenty of outdoor tables with a great views of NYC. Good selection of beers on tap and bottles. Indoors tables are well spaced a great place to catch a game, plenty of TVs. Dueling pianos is plenty of fun.
2020-11-21,2,Wow!  What a TREMENDOUS disappointment!  Ordered delivery...while it arrived within the expected time, the majority of the food was cold and had to be reheated.    Brisket looked boiled and completely unappetizing.  Mac and cheese had zero flavor.  Fries were soggy.  Pulled pork was tolerable.  Burger looked like a fast food item.  My husband said the ribs were the only thing that came close to decent BBQ.  We have 3 sons who love BBQ and they all said, "Mom, please don't order from this place again."  Next time , I'd rather drive all the way into NYC to take out from a real BBQ joint like Virgils.
2020-10-30,1,Food was ice cold. Brisket was tough. Mac and Cheese was worse than Kraft. Save your money and order from another place.
2020-10-27,2,This place was never THAT great but I think it got worse with COVID. Pork rib was my favorite dish in this place but it was dry and stale. The meat was so dry it was rubbery outside. Mac and cheese was really old and soggy. Corn and bean salad was maybe refrigerated for so long it was stale and had a refrigerator smell to it. Their hot sauce tasted really strange. Their bbq sauce is ok. I wish hoboken had a better bbq place.
2020-10-11,2,The food was ok nothing spectacular definitely not outstanding but simply bland. The drink prices were outrageous. 14 bucks for a tequila shot? Margarita was horribly tart and tasted as if it had no tequila in it thus paid 14 bucks for it then 14 to add a shot to it so hopefully drinkable but still tart so ordered another double shoot to make tolerable at a cost of 28 dollars now had 56.00 dollars invested in a single Margarita and still tasted awful. Obviously had no clue what we were being charged as were ordered thus was annoyed to see the bill. Nice atmosphere, bland food and outrageous drink prices therefore crossed it off the list!
2020-10-07,2,Went for happy hour/dinner here a couple of Fridays ago. Only plus was that the Food tasted really good but portions were very small (the 1/2 chicken seems to be missing pieces) and chicken was very dry, maybe cooked too far in advance. Service was acceptable.
2020-10-04,5,I reached out to House of Que for football Sunday for October 4th and I reached out over a week in advance. Natalie responded promptly and was very accommodating for my 4 person party. She was very transparent and communicative for the group and hoped me and my group. The morning of my reservation, one of my friends was sick and the other was in close contact so I shrunk my reservation to 2 people. Natalie was very accommodating and when I got to the restaurant the GM, Chris was extremely nice and accommodated me and my dining partner. When I sat down Kayla and Vanessa were our servers and they were extremely nice and accommodating and super nice and attentive to our table. I will definitely be returning to this bar for future Sunday football and future. Kayla and Vanessa were the best servers I had in Hoboken and I truly appreciate their attentiveness and care.
2020-09-08,5,Went to "The House of 'Que" this past Saturday.  Our server was "Gabby" and will definitely ask for her next time.  Gabby was very attentive without being intrusive.  She is a very good conversationalist with a maturity beyond her years.  Gabby should train servers as to how to engage with customers! The smoked sausage and ribs were very good.  The brisket was very moist, but had no bark/crust on my portion.  (see below)After the meal, I asked to speak with a manager and spoke with "Chris, the General Manager".  I wanted him to hear how good their employee, Gabby, is and I described why.  I also mentioned that my portion of  brisket had no bark and asked if that is usual.  Chris said no it is not and that next time to mention to the server that I like the bark and/or would like some of the burnt ends!Chis is very personable, as is Gabby!  I hope the owners of House of 'Que read this review, about Chris and especially about Gabby!Best regards,Tom G.
2020-09-08,4,We were out for a walk along the river and decided to grab an outdoor table at House of 'Que.  We ordered a pitcher of Frozen Lime Margaritas, which were made with Casamigos tequila.  The cocktail arrived so frozen that we needed to scoop it into our cups with a fork.  It was also on the sweet side, but very enjoyable.  In addition to the drinks, we decided to sample some appetizers.  The Texas Chips and Salsa were on par with those you would get from a top-tier Mexican restaurant.  The tortilla chips were crispy and perfectly salted.  The accompanying homemade salsa was almost like a tomato puree or gazpacho that was well-balanced and well-seasoned.  In addition, their French Fries were flavorful, especially when dipped into their barbecue sauces, of which I preferred the vinegar-based one to the tomato-based variety.Though this was a brief meal for us, I can say that House of 'Que provides a fun atmosphere and delicious food.
2020-08-24,5,Very well packed and great portions. The beat collard greens this side of Louisiana!!!
2020-08-18,3,We went here to try something different. BBQ is never at the top of my list. Covid restrictions had us dining outside along the street. Very windy not good. Food was OK, service slow and the beer warm. Not a great combination. I'm checking off that box as there's no reason to go back.
2020-08-15,5,I'm so glad we finally came here! The outdoor seating is spacious and they have shade. The appetizers were delicious. Everything we tried was fresh and flavorful. The drinks were also good. Our sever was very nice and helpful. Will definitely be back one day for dinner.
2020-08-05,1,First time at this place. Good service. Ribs were dry and could be a day or two old. The brisket could be better. It was on the dry side but edible with some sauce. It might be better to come back when covid situation is over and they can actually move fresh food.
2020-07-29,1,I tried this place for the first time and I it will be my last. I ordered thru Uber Eats and not worth it for the money spent.  The ribs were dry with a little sauce and the Cole slaw was old but the potato salad was ok, the peach cobbler was okay.  Not worth the money as far as I am concern. Never again.  House of Que were  you having a bad evening and just sent what you had leftover to make a sale?  Very disappointing.
2020-07-29,3,The brisket, ribs and chili were decent..not the best or the worst I've had. Nice view from the outdoor patio.
2020-07-28,5,Food was absolutely delicious we got the Pitmaster's Pick was plenty for my son and I! The sausage was simply amazing, brisket was cooked perfectly! The chicken was just a little dry, the ribs where also delicious fell off the bone! Would highly recommend! The location is beautiful right on the water! The decorations on the interior is gorgeous! I am a Texas Native so this food was a good taste from home!
2020-07-15,2,Unfortunately there are not many places at all around here to get a decent plate of bbq to begin with. HOQ is No exception and tends to the miss the mark considerably from my prior experiences. They have a decent setup with ample indoor/outdoor seating and solid happy hour drinks - but I don't necessarily need a BBQ place to be good at that.More Importantly the food: it's not bad- it's edible - it's just not good. My lunch plate pictured was bleak and tasted as dry as it looks. Thankfully the sauce was good enough to drown out whatever inadequacies the meat had: The ribs felt petrified  on the bone and the sausage was sadly falling apart. Brisket wasn't bad to be fair but I wouldn't be surprised if it was a few days old. The sides were decent and I've enjoyed the appetizer selection in the past but again - not why I'm there. HOQ makeups for the lack in food with the bells-and-whistles of what you might expect in a 'Texas style' joint. Don't expect anything to blow you away but if you need BBQ and it makes no difference this might work for you.
2020-07-01,1,The first time I ordered from here the food was amazing. The last two times it has been plagued with mistakes and bad service. I received six wings one which came with no meat on it for $15, a half pound of ribs that consisted of THREE ribs for $10. The food is good but the prices and measurements of the food is way off. The manager told me the new prices reflect for everything that's going on related to COVID. Skimping people to make up for lost business is not the answer.
2020-06-27,1,Food is TRASH. Came here last night, it was our first time here and most definitely was the last.The burgers were super dry and hard, the fries were very soggy, AND they aren't keeping up with their cleaning.I saw multiple guests leave and they did not clean the tables, how is this even allowed???STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOBOKEN LOCATION!!!
2020-06-26,1,everything was great ! i came looking for a server who took care of my family and i several times , Grace , truly an amazing server , she was the reason I returned here with my family several times , always made sure my kids got their meals. this time the servers weren't as great. i'm truly disappointed.
2020-06-24,3,Rating House of 'Que a 3 because staff was friendly and helpful. I like how they are practicing social distancing with strict enforcement. However, the food was cold, and very under seasoned. I ordered a moscow mule horrible! It tasted bitter, and watery with a hint of ginger beer. The waitress was very friendly and conversational which somewhat helped overlook the flaw of the dissatisfying food.
2020-06-20,1,After calling and putting myself on the waitlist, they told me it would be about an hour. I waited an hour and figured I should show up to the restaurant since they had not called me back yet. When I arrived I asked when I would get seated and they proceeded to tell me it would be about 1 more hour. Already annoyed because it was hot and there was no where to sit, they told me they would call my number when the table would be ready. They never called and when I showed back up at the restaurant I was ignored the entire time. Never going back.
2020-06-17,1,The overpriced food was bland like they ordered it from Boston deli and reheated it for me. This is not barbeque at all.
2020-05-31,4,First time trying this place out and it's was delicious. Great flavor and not greasy. Definitely try the corn pudding and Mac and cheese. Brisket was a bit fatty but juicy and not dry.
2020-05-22,1,The worst brisket I've ever eaten. The restaurant brags that the meat is smoked for 18 hours. There wasnt a smoke ring in sight and the meat was wet like it was boiled. I also ordered the smoked wings. They are not smoked and are in fact plain ole fried wings. A waste of 40 bucks
2020-05-14,5,I've been to this location a couple of times, but recently was here before quarantine for a surprise birthday party. The service and organization of the party was really good, the servers were attentive with food and drinks. They had dueling pianos which was really cool as well for the ambience. The food itself was very good and definitely hit the spot everybody kept devouring the platters that they put out for us. Great experience
2020-04-07,4,We've been wanting to try this place for awhile, but it's always super busy. Well, after ordering food last week I know why. He ordered a pulled pork sandwich, brisket chilli, and mac and cheese.I ordered the brisket and ribs combo, macaroni and cheese, and corn pudding. Everything was delicious, however I wasn't crazy about the macaroni. I would definitely order from here again.
2020-03-15,4,Went to House if 'Que on our first night in town and loved it. Our party of 4 shared a large sampler platter and still had plenty left over. The brisket was perfect! Probably the best we've ever had. We paired it with a couple of sides and still had enough left for lunches the next day. The view of Manhattan can't be beat. The server was super sweet. Fun atmosphere. A must try
2020-03-13,3,This place is a fun vibe in the summer time. They usually have events at night (trivia is the best). Its a little pricey so I would suggest going for happy hour. The wings are mediocre but the sauces on the table give the wings the perfect kick it needs. The nachos are dry, a lot of chips were just plain with no cheese/toppings. I love the location, it is a perfect place for a bite after going for a stroll on the Hoboken waterfront.
2020-03-13,4,Good quality place, vibes are fun. Drinks are really pricey but it's pretty strong so it makes up for it. The food is good especially the wings. It's located in a good spot too in Hoboken right near the waterfront.
2020-01-26,3,On 01/26/20 I decided to bring a party of 4 to this restaurant. I have been here before and I wanted to share the great experience I had before with my family. The atmosphere was great, the food was great, but the service was awful. When I sat down on the bench it was completely sticky and disgusting so I turned around and began to change the bench myself. There were multiple employees around watching me do this. Then 3 people out of my party of 4 help me out switch the bench. Then one employee came up to me after I did the hard part. As my night continued, the Waitress Graciela was very disrespectful. She came up to my table and did not introduce herself. She asked if we were ready to order and notice we were not ready so she gave us time. Once she came back she still had an attitude and gave me the wrong order. Once I told them that this was the wrong order, they told me that I can keep this order and they will get me the proper order. As I was pouring sangria for my family I notice a hand from under my arm and the incorrect order was rudely snatched away from the table. I was disgusted by how the employees were acting. During my meal, my waitress did not check on my party as well. Later on, another employee took several drinks and plates before we were done eating without asking. Once we finished, 3 people out of my party tipped although the service were not good. I decided not to. Once the bill was paid for my group we asked the front host to take a picture of us. The waitress Graciela stalked us through the window and went outside and said a rude remark. Once we were done taking the pictures outside we walked away, and Graciela followed and began to scream profanity at me for not tipping. She also insulted everyone in my party on our way out. Since it was busy, I called the manager, Zeus, later and explained how I had been harassed by Graciela. After prolonged atrocious service, the only good part about this night was how respectful and helpful manager Zeus is.
2020-01-26,3,Looks like a good place to go with a group.  Communal tables, lots of TVs,  good service.  BBQ isn't bad but let down by rolls (for the sandwiches) and the sauces.
2020-01-21,1,food's honestly pretty nasty. but its fun to drink at especially if you go for dueling pianos. but dont make a reservation for more than 10 people because then they charge a $50 min per person. the beer towers are cheap but that just means you literally need to order an absurd amount to reach the min.
2020-01-20,1,Brisket was pathetic. Chewy, tasteless. I think the chef (clearly not a pit master) needs to go south to see what brisket is supposed to be like. Service wasnt great either. On the plus side its a good bar, location is great.. onion rings were tasty (though I was charged full price $7 instead of $2 upgrade) and the deviled eggs were good but not worth $5 for 3. Clearly in need of some work....
2020-01-11,5,The BEST bbq wings I've ever had and amazing quesadillas as well.
2020-01-05,3,Dueling pianos is such a blast but it was such a horrible experience booking it. If you want to make a reservation for over 11 people, it's $50 pp. They make the beer towers cheap and affordable but it means you have to order an exuberant amount to meet a $50 minimum per person. Say you make a reservation for 15, you put a down payment down for 15 people at $50 pp, but then you only have 14 friends show up. You still have to pay for 15. Say in that same scenario you have 16 friends show up, you pay for 16 plus a fee for an extra individual. Basically it was a pain in the butt and i don't recommend going unless you're making it for 10 people or less.
2020-01-01,5,New Year's Eve was a blast! The food was amazing, the wait staff were efficient and pleasant and the entertainment was just so much fun! We will definitely be back!  Chris did a great job taking care of our initial reservation and then remembered us when we arrived.  Customer service, food and atmosphere makes this a 5 star experience. What a great way to ring in 2020!
2019-12-29,4,Cool and Friendly place for sports screening lovers. You can sip beer and watch sport screening. The place has really good vibes and really good atmosphere.
2019-12-22,1,Don't come here for brunch! Even high school cafeteria food comes with much better presentation. The coffee... omg... was it the previous day's batch? You make it so hard to love you guyyys.Another thing- the servers could clearly tell I was uneasy with eating the food. I voiced it as well but all I got was an awkward, "let me talk to the chef." I'm just mind blown that a chef made this in the first place. Breakfast isn't hard to nail. I should become a chef at this rate. I make a mean, yummy-looking, yummy-tasting breakfast. Should have eaten at home and saved some holiday coins. Why are you like this House of Que? Please remove "brunch" from your menu and website.
2019-12-13,5,House of 'Que is a great place to hang out on Football Sunday.  It's so great, I did a reverse "bridge and tunnel" route, coming all the way from NYC. The food is good the service is good and the drinks specials are a reason to come, especially the beer tower.   My favorite part is that there two sections in this restaurant. One section features a more lively/social section near the bar that has long high tables.  The other table features low wooden picnic type tables that are very suitable for groups and families.   Special thank you to Grace and Thamara who found feminine hygiene products for me because the ladies room did not have the machine for purchase.  Overall, very good experience at House of 'Que. You will have a very pleasant, professional and courteous experience if you get seated in the section with Grace and Thamara.
2019-11-21,3,Great view of Manhattan. The food is average. The cocktails are average. The restaurant is a good option if you want to show someone from out of town the Manhattan skyline. The room is comfortable and the staff is attentive.
2019-10-26,4,Awesome atmosphere, tasty food, great service. I know it's a BBQ place but I wish they had some vegetarian options to accommodate everyone in my party.
2019-10-14,3,Came here with a group of friends in the spirit of the 4th of July. The location is perfect--right in front of Sinatra Park where you can overlook the west side of NYC and catch the fireworks afterwards. We chose the Pitmaster's Pick with the corn pudding and their famous brisket chili as our sides. Between the 5 of us, we all were able to get out fair share of each item and it left us satisfied--it's a great deal if you don't have a huge appetite to begin with and if proteins can easily fill you up. We enjoyed almost each item--especially the ribs--but the chicken was probably our least favorite because it was a bit dry and the sausages were also average. The corn pudding was also really good--think of mushed cornbread with butter and that's pretty much what you get. The brisket chili was also OK, but not spicy at all (this, coming from someone who can't tolerate spice). Overall, the bbq was solid, but it wasn't like we were expected some mind-blowing southern style bbq either. The atmosphere is a weird mix of sports bar/bbq joint/family-style that I guess in a way is suitable for any kind of group setting.
2019-10-14,3,Great location. Right on the water with a beautiful view of the Manhattan skyline. Just wish the bbq was a little better. Maybe I got spoiled a couple weeks ago when I was in Texas but thought it was just kind of average. Queso was good so was the fried pickles. But brisket was just ok. And sausage was nothing special. Mac and cheese was decent and potato salad was too mustardy. But the drinks were good and strong.
2019-10-12,4,Came here with a group of 12.  Service and food was good - as you would expect.
2019-10-08,4,Watch NFL games here! Happy hour for wings is something you can't beat and they're really good too. Crispy skin and saucy, saucy, saucy, which is how I like 'em. Entrees you can skip, get your fill on this and a nice bucket of beers or pitchers. We were also "fortunate" enough to witness some good karaoke afterwards too. Cool setting, cool vibes and lots of space to sit with friends and enjoy some football.
2019-09-30,4,NFL football Sunday here are awesome. Great vibesGreat atmosphere Drove from Staten Island to come here for some bbq. Most of what we ate delivered on all aspects of flavor. Started with smoked wings and quesadillas with brisket. Wings, both sauced and naked, were quite delicious but the smoked brisket quesadillas hit on juiciness.Moving on, had ribs and sausage with sides of Mac and cheese and corn casserole. The ribs were perfectly smoky and tender. The sausage had good snap, but wasn't juicy at all. Didn't really care for it at all. The sides, especially the corn casserole, were 10 out of 10.There seems to be so many options in Hoboken but glad we tried it her. Our server Mel was a rock star. Glasses kept full. Service not intrusive. 4 for atmosphere 3 1/2 for food
2019-09-03,1,I ordered takeout from this place tues. Sept 3. I honestly wouldnt come back. The 1/2 pound of ribs i got were measly, 5 overcooked and dried out ribs. I swear it was like peeling tape off a bone, and even worse to swallow. The wedge salad sounded good, but the bacon was soggy and gray. A clear indication that it wasnt fresh. I placed my order 30 minutes before i picked it up. When i got there it wasnt ready and 5 minutes before it was ready, they informed me they didnt have peach cobbler. That was disappointing because it probably would have been the best part of this meal.
2019-09-02,3,The bests wings ever! The wings are big and very good. All the food it's good at least at the Hoboken location
2019-08-30,3,It was fine - we sat outside and it took forever for the bartender to come over to us at the outdoor bar seating area.  I ordered my drink and as my friend looked back at the restaurant to get the proper name of the cocktail the bar tender walked away... and didnt come back for quite some time... chatting and talking with the other staff... it was NOT busy I'll have to go back and give it another try....but so far eh
2019-08-24,5,The set-up is really neat. I came here on a date and we were sitting on the "bar" that is half outside half inside. It was nice to be able to people watch and turn around to see the skyline. The drinks we got (margarita and a Ketel one botanical in cucumber mint) were delicious! Definitely worth a visit, I've heard the food is great too.
2019-08-04,2,This is probably the worst restaurant I've ever ordered from. First, let's start with the fact that my entire $75 meat combo was never delivered. Then, I called 4 times, all of which the calls were hung up on before one girl finally said that she would get it out to us. Additionally, they forgot our cornbread pudding. My friends and I proceeded to eat the sides, all of which were terrible. The baked beans were just pinto beans in briny water with unfortunate chunks of brisket in it. The coleslaw tasted like cardboard and the Mac n' cheese was bland. The only reason I'm not giving it one star is because the brisket was really good. I highly recommend avoiding this place. Their customer service is bland, just like their beans.
2019-08-03,5,Here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch with family. I had the pulled pork sandwich with slaw on the side. Delish! Of course I added more sauce cuz it's amazing. For a side we split an order of sweet potato fries. Some of the best I've had. Enjoyed the live entertainment too. Grace, our server was a sweetheart. In fact, all the waitstaff were very pleasant and friendly. I'll be back if possible cuz we're from out of the area, so this was a treat.
2019-07-29,1,I didn't like it, the pulled pork was terrible, was cold, the coleslaw was so few, bad presentation, was server in a paper plate, the service (server, food runner) was not kindfully, i wouldn't came back ever
2019-07-29,4,We stopped in here today to try some Hoboken BBQ! We ordered the lunch combo to try a few things and it comes with your choice of two sides. For sides we did the Mac and cheese and brisket chili. I don't eat ribs so I can't say anything about them. The Mac and cheese needed salt and pepper; didn't have much flavor. I'd pass on that next time. The brisket chili was delicious! We wished everything came out warmer but we were hungry so we didn't send it back. The sausage was delicious. Tender and cooked perfect. The brisket delicious too! It was tender and the fat was flavorful and had a nice crisp. Best brisket I've ever had? No. But it hits the spot. Our bartender, Caitlin, was very helpful and attentive. She was great. I also ordered the BBQ quesadilla. That was the best thing I ate there lol. It had a perfect crunch on the tortilla and flavors were fresh inside and it arrived hot. The ranch was good too. I'd order that again for sure. Prices aren't bad either.
2019-07-28,2,Usually have a good time here, great environment especially with the piano. Had a horrible experience with waiter Erik. Worst service I've received there. Ribs were not hot at all and not good. Won't be going back anymore:/
2019-07-26,5,So can I just day how nice and friendly EVERYONE here is???? Like seriously, the food keep me coming back but the service is crazy amazing! I've been here 3x (July 4, 16 and 26) and seriously great people. Love all the TVs with all the sports on and love the posts of events on weeknights. I haven't come that late to enjoy them. Ok the food is really good. Might Quinn's who??? My husband asked which did I like better. Definitely HOC!!! Oh and did I say their nachos are the best I ever had (in my Drake voice Hahha) - stop by HOC, you won't be disappointed!
2019-07-12,1,Bad rating is solely for the waitress 'Gabriella'. I've been here before and everything went fine previously. The waitress was rude from the start. We ordered Deviled eggs, waitress said they're out of Deviled eggs and we asked her to check and place the order if they're available. She brought 3 halves of Deviled eggs (anywhere in the world we would get 4 halves) they're cold and tasted like left overs. At the end, after the check, she was angry for the tips given for her bad attitude and she told "try not to come back here".I will definitely come back here and leave a bad review if I encounter the same waitress. She is just arrogant!!! Remember her name, Gabriella.
2019-07-07,5,Brisket is out of this world, and a great atmosphere for watching a game. Love the sides - get the corn bread for sure.
2019-06-27,3,The service was good but the BBQ itself was just OK. The ribs felt a little dry and the sausage didn't have that much of a taste. However, the briskets were good !!! Perhaps it was because we went during lunch time and not dinner time
2019-06-20,5,Some of the best food and best service in hoboken. That place is fantastic . Burgers, wings, ribs. Best barbecue in New Jersey. Good with sit in or pickup orders. Fast service at the bar as well . Really well run establishment
2019-06-14,1,Truly, truly disgusting. Spit out the Mac and cheese bc it was mushy and sour. Chicken was so tough and salty it was inedible.
2019-05-22,5,Great food, great drinks and great atmosphere.  Love the view of NYC skyline.  After eating we take a walk down the pier to somewhat walk off the food LOL.
2019-04-13,5,House of Que is always a fun time with friends! I usually go for BBQ appetizers and drinks, and it's always a great atmosphere. The nachos are on point, there's even a little unexpected queso surprise on the bottom on the plate that's a great touch. The beer and cocktails are on point, and each day they have their own happy hour specials. It's the perfect place for casual food and drinks with friends, especially on a nice summer day!
2019-04-06,1,Zero stars for food. (4 for location & live music) baby back ribs dry, charred & overkill on that bottled smoke stuff that stains your fingers for hours. Baked beans & corn bread sides cost extra. Beans watery. Bread basic. Chicken sandwich skimpy. Waiter barely said 2 words. He must know the food sucks. I would only go back for a beer outside. Save your money- eat somewhere else.
2019-03-23,1,Not a food review, unfortunately we never made it past the front door. Turned away at the door. We dared to turn up on a Saturday night w/o a reservation. Security guard and front door staff were very stressed and not polite, for what? No reservation...we would have happily returned with a reservation at another date and time. Back to Dallas BBQ in NYC I guess.
2019-03-23,1,The people here told us there was an hour wait and did not clarify it was on a wait list rather than a reservation. After a full hour, we went and asked for an update and was told that because we didn't have a reservation, it was possible that it could be another hour. They didn't tell us this at the beginning and we wasted our time waiting. When we confronted the hostess about this, she claimed she had. Bad service. Won't be coming back.
2019-03-23,4,Decent barbecue place in Hoboken, especially for the location (waterfront) and price! My partner is from North Carolina and a notorious BBQ snob and even he liked it! Mac and cheese was decent and my BBQ chicken sandwich was also solid. Very laidback vibes with picnic benches and we went on a really warm day last week and they had the siding open and outdoor seating available which is always a plus! As we were leaving the even had live music setting up (Friday evenings at 9).
2019-03-17,2,Sub-par customer service.  We attempted to make a reservation a few days prior and the website stated "no reservations on Saturday".  We came anyway as a group of four and we were immediately told they have no seats available for the night because everything was reserved and that we could try the bar area. How confusing!  We asked why the website had no reservations listed, but now there was zero availability due to reservations.  We were met with a shoulder shrug and prompted to try the bar.We then watched other groups come in and have their names taken down.  We went back to ask again what the procedure is for getting a table, and were told they are full bc of call ins for a waitlist. We had to then prompt the hostess to put us on this wait list.  We were told there was no way we were going to get a table anyway.  We finished up our drinks and appetizer at the bar and closed out to leave. No sooner did we have our coats on, we were approached to be seated at a table.  Just a very odd customer service experience from the hostess stand.As for the food - it was tasty, but the brisket was a bit chewy - I strictly judge my bbq on the brisket.  Our orders came to the table disjointed - two plates came, and the other two folks waited 15 minutes for their dishes.  I'd like to chalk it up to a rough night - hopefully I will try them again to see if the experience is different.  But it looks like the hostesses could use more support from their management on communicating what restaurant seating policies are.
2019-03-13,5,This place is a great time! My girlfriends and I had girls night and came here to listen to dueling pianos eat some great food and enjoy a night of drinking. The one thing is that girls take a long time to get ready so we were running late when we got there the hostess said she had given away our table. Another hostess was able to give us a table still and was very accommodating.
2019-03-03,4,My rating is strictly for dueling pianos on Saturday night.  Make sure you show up early or very close to the start time because it was PACKED when we got there late.  We came back closer to the end and it was still fun.  They play all kinds of songs, not just your typical piano fare.  I heard "Wannabe" by the Spice Girls and "F--k You" by Ceelo Green.  I thought that if the City Bar had such fare for Talent Night shows I'd have enjoyed them far more.
2019-03-03,5,My husband made a reservation a day before for us and on the day of the reservation we got a confirmation call around 12pm to confirm we were going. On our way there, 30 mins before our reservation, they call us and advise there was a mistake and if we can move our reservation about 2 hours later. We couldn't, but they were nice enough to let us know there was an event going on but they would accommodate us. When we arrived they let us know because of the event, the kitchen was close but had opened just for us. The manager was really nice and apologized for the mistake and even gave us a percentage off of our whole check. We couldn't however get any of the smoked meat since that was available until after the event was done. The food that we got was absolutely amazing however. I would highly recommend and come again! The sauces were so good! We had the wings, frito pie, Texas burger and the hot dogs  DELICIOUS!
2019-02-19,2,The hostess, the waitress/staff, the food, the dueling pianos were wonderful however the event planner Natalie Jones was horrendous to work with, this is why I gave a 2 rating. Not only she was rude and not at all accommodating she yelled at my party when we arrived. Do not go through Natalie, she does not accommodate large parties. I got my own table via her and my friends LAST MINUTE got a different table across the room that day and she threw a temper tantrum, she almost didn't allow me to store my ice cream cake in the refrigerator, which was absurd and child-like. It was pretty ridiculous how greedy and rude was. Luckily, the hostess was SUPER friendly and kind and assured me that everything would be okay that day.
2019-02-13,4,House of 'Que is a solid choice if you are looking to eat some barbecue food. There is literally nothing healthy on the menu, so don't go to House of 'Que thinking that you will be able to eat something healthy. But if you like barbecue food, House of 'Que is not bad at all! If you work in the Hoboken area, House of 'Que has a lot of great lunch special options. House of 'Que is a nice spot to go out to eat lunch with your coworkers on a Friday. House of 'Que is also a solid happy hour spot to go to after work with your coworkers. House of 'Que also has surprisingly good desserts! I would recommend trying them if you are looking for something sweet. Their sliders and sandwiches are also a great option. And, of course, their barbecue sides are delicious.
2019-01-26,2,Honestly the food isn't that great but it's the only bbq place in town so what are you gonna do when you want bbq :/ at least the ambiance is good and entertainment is cool
2019-01-24,5,I ordered their white queso for delivery. And if your looking for Tex mex style queso this place has it! Including the style of chips! So good! Surprising for a Bbq joint but available!
2019-01-19,5,Went to try something new and I was left with such a great first impression! First of all, the ambience is great. We went on a Friday night and they had live music. The menu is not too big, but my boyfriend had the 2nd pick which are two chili hot dogs with frieds and I had the HOQ Chicken sandwich which can be on a brioche bun or wrap. I had it on a brioche bun. It was DELICIOUS!!! The BBQ chipotle mayo gave it such a great touch. The fries were super crispy and just the perfect amount. Kate, our waitress, was SUPER ATTENTIVE and iloved it!! We never had to look for her to ask her for anything, she was always on top of everything. It is affordable for a restaurant with a great view (by the hudson river). During the summer, they have outdoors too so you get to dine with a view. The drinks are great too! We had the drunken cowgirl and drunken cowboy, strond great drinks for the price! I will definitely go back for more.
2019-01-18,4,I haven't been back since the first time I went a few years ago. I was craving their corn pudding, so I thought why not and ordered delivery. Much to my delight (and surprise), everything was much better than I remembered, particularly the mac n cheese. Considering it was delivery, and the delay in me actually getting my food, I imagine the seated experience is even better. I'm looking forward to going back very soon.
2019-01-14,4,If you want some good bbq this is a good spot. They do a good job with Texas BBQ since it's in Jersey and all. Large place so a great happy hour spot with bench tables and let's not forget the lovely voices during karaoke on Thursday. Service was okay but our waitress was very nice and helpful when trying to decide on sides and portions.
2019-01-13,4,Went on a weeknight for a casual dinner. Food was delicious. We had the brisket and a bunch of their sides. Chill atmosphere. There was karaoke at the bar that one particular patron sounded like he was really enjoying. Bar seemed to have a good amount of people but dining area was a little quieter so a nice balance for a weeknight. Would try it again!
2019-01-08,5,Best BBQ I have ever had. Great beer selection also. Great service and atmosphere. The corn bread is phenomenal !
2019-01-01,4,Food is good but drinks are pricey. The menu itself is quite limited but for what they offer, it's pretty good. I had the quesadilla appetizer which was really good. It came with this spicy mayo type sauce that definitely enhanced the flavor. For entree, I had the house of que burger which had a slab of brisket on top of the burger. That burger was really good. The brisket was juicy with tons of flavor as was the burger. Only knack is their beers are expensive. I went towards the tail end of their happy hour. I had a shiner bock for $4. It came in a small 12oz plastic cup. Once happy hour ended I switched to a Brooklyn winter lager thinking I'd get a full sized beer in a glass. Nope. Got the same small plastic cup but this time it was full priced ($7 I believe). I'm not even sure if the cups were even 12oz but they were pretty small. But other then that the place has some good bbq.
2018-12-19,4,There aren't many (or any other) places in Hoboken for BBQ, so if you're having a craving, this is really the only place that you can go.  I used to think the food at House of Que was sub-par, but with my most recent visits, I'm changing my tune.  It makes sense the establishment has just opened up another location in Weehawken.  On to what I like: The smoked wings have a lot of flavor and aren't breaded (as any bbq wings should not be).  The ribs are tender, but not FALL off the bone which actually irks me - if I wanted meat off the bone, I would have gotten the pulled pork!   Can't forget that they offer frito pie (bag of Fritos, with toppings and choice of meat) and loaded baked potato (with choice of bbw meat as well).   I like they have two kinds of bbq sauce at the table, so you can mix and match and see what you like better!  I prefer the darker bbq sauce - it's a little more spicy and less vinegary than the other.    They also have an a la mode option with their dessert offerings!    In the summer, it's great to have the outdoor patio with the epic waterfront view. Most notably on Friday and Saturday nights, House of Que has their Dueling Pianos show where audience can tip the pianists to get their requests played & for a larger sum (usually $20), you can get them to stop a song you don't like as well.  This show is usually high energy and a fun thing do to with a group of pals. Cons:  The Pork belly appetizer I find to be too sweet and wish the fat was rendered more and the outside was crispier.   Secondly, when ordering the desserts a la  mode, the desserts don't come to the table piping hot, which makes for a sad dessert situation.  The bbq meats can now only be ordered in  1/2 pound increments, so if you're not super hungry and only want 1⁄4 pound, you're out of luck.   The corn pudding is meh (get the fries instead).
2018-12-16,3,Service great, food ok but overpriced. The wings are very good and the happy hours solid. but 6.50 for curly fries is pretty absurd. Also pulled pork was ok... baked potato small and under cooked... again wings amazing so if you go get the wings
2018-12-09,4,Really delicious barbeque, coming from someone who has not previously liked BBQ food. I got either pulled pork or pulled brisket most recently and it was so good. Great for large groups, bdays, etc. Long table seating is fun! Beer towers are also a must for the cost and for the fun of it. Dueling pianos also a really nice time! Have gone for that and beer towers a few times.
2018-12-09,1,Food was cold and tasteless. Not worth it. Quality has gone down hill. Ordered the pulled pork, chicken, and ribs. The pulled pork was served like a ball all cold and tasteless. The ribs were cold. The chicken was warm the best of the bunch. Mac and Cheese was tasteless.
2018-12-02,5,This is the first steakhouse I've been to in a while. The atmosphere as well as the ambience was very energetic with the sports fest, featuring Sunday night football going on in the background. The staff was friendly as well as helpful in every aspect. Providing great service especially with the knowledge of the house made sauces. The item that swept my tastebuds had to be the brisket. The tenderness as well as the smoked flavor was spot on. I had to say, the house made uncooked BBQ house sauce was the best I've had ever. The wings were delightful, cooked with finesse and just the way you would picture wings to be. Recommended to all who are in favor to BBQ which is a home away from home. Enjoyed the food and a great place to dine and have great dishes.
2018-12-02,5,The wait staff was attentive brought us everything and kept our hands clean ! The brought every slice they make here and it was all so good!
2018-11-28,4,I always thought no two things went together better than BBQ and piano bars. So happy I finally found a place that agrees with me. Met my brothers here for a drink and a burger and was pleasantly surprised to learn that we were in for a show. Dueling Pianos meant two people both on pianos taking requests for songs from the audience and they were both incredible. I think this happens every Saturday (she said, marking Dueling Pianos in her calendar for the next 10 Saturdays). I started off with chicken wings but just got them naked (no sauce, get your head out of the gutter!) and used the BBQ sauce that they had on the table. I must say, it is nice eating wings without the mess. Whoever thought that a finger food should come smothered in sauce definitely didn't think the whole thing through. But nonetheless the wings were cooked perfectly! Next was the burger. It was great but I will say that I asked for medium and it was a lot closer to well done  than medium. But it was still a great meal so I won't complain. Upgraded to the sweet potato fries which were alone 5 stars. The place was huge with nearly half of it being filled with picnic tables. I'm not sure if it was because of the show, but the tables were very close together. To the point where we had to climb on chairs to get to our own table. Although it was not a huge deal, I did wish we could have a bit more elbow room. All in all, it was a fun night and a really nice surprise to find a great show. See you soon for Dueling Pianos and maybe a good brisket.
2018-11-20,3,Food is mediocre at best, bbq sauce lacked a bit of a zing. Mac and cheese was just straight up flavorless. Their drinks and queso dip were the saving grace, but over all underwhelming
2018-11-17,5,some really great bbq && some really great sweets including their pecan pie pictured here a must hit while in the jc or hoboken area
2018-11-09,5,I ordered delivery from here tonight.  I was soaked and it was pouring rain, and nothing is better the eating BBQ on a cold rainy night.  I had the Mac and cheese, fried pickle spears, and the wings.  All five star worthy.The wings were a little messy.  But that's normal.If you're looking for BBQ in Hoboken, I totally recommend.
2018-10-13,1,Literally the meanest staff ever. Don't waste your time. Made reservations a week in advance and we were waiting on one more person to arrive to our table because the PATH was closed and they were threatening to give our table away. Not how you treat anyone on their birthday.
2018-09-30,4,I love this place! After going the first time I went back multiple times in the same month because it was a fun environment with great food. When the weather is nice it's a great option to sit outside. All the food we have gotten here has been flavorful and cooked well, modifications were always correct and the service has been great every time.
2018-09-23,3,Decent BBQ if you can't go to Texas, Kansas, Illinois, Alabama, Missouri, or the Carolina's. :-)The view was great from our table to see the city, the food wasn't the best tasting although the brisket was tender and juicy. The wings were also pretty decent. The rest was just meh, the service was pretty good from start until finish.Don't think I would return though.
2018-09-07,4,This place is so much fun! I had a reservation and went with a small group for Dueling Piano night (Saturday nights) and we were seated at a circle booth right near the stage. I definitely recommend coming with a group for this event, it's a fun night out. As far as food, we shared a bunch of things- nachos, Frito pie, brisket, ribs, sweet potato fries, and corn pudding. Everything was good, but my personal favorite was the corn pudding- it has the consistency of a casserole with pieces of corn. It was delicious! The drinks were good and strong and our server was great- very easy to communicate with despite the high level of noise. Also forgot to mention the location is great, right across from the water. I want to come back and try dessert, not sure why I didn't get any!
2018-08-31,1,The dueling pianos was talented but pretended that we didn't pay any money for the song requests.  $50+ dollars down the drain.  Some horrible woman with profanities on her jacket ruined the whole night  for the entire bar.  If I ever come again and she is there, I won't spend a dime because it's a waste of my time and money.
2018-08-30,3,Went for lunch with my husband and kids - kids menu is limited to chicken fingers, burger, hot dog all comes with fries. My son had the hotdog, he ate it which is a good sign because he is kind of picky when it comes to food. Out good could've been better everything tasted like it was reheated. We ordered the brisket sandwich with corn pudding and brisket chili as sides. We ordered sweet tea - it's brewed not fountain so I was expecting for it to taste great but it didn't. We ordered the cookie and that was warmed up in a microwave (you can taste it). I feel like this place is probably known for their night time atmosphere and not so much for their food.
2018-08-23,4,They are much better than when they opened a few yeara ago.   I will definitely be going again!
2018-08-13,5,We celebrated my wife's birthday at HoQ and couldn't have been more pleased.  We worked with Natalie who is the event coordinator that handles large parties (we were a group of 20). She was a true professional and made sure all of requests were taken care of prior to our arrival. Our party was on a Saturday night so we had the dueling pianos for entertainment. I was immediately introduced to all of the staff I would be interacting with throughout the night. The members of our party began arriving at 7:30 and were taken care of right away.  We pre-ordered some food and drinks and our server even re-checked with us when we wanted them delivered to the table. We did adjust the delivery time of some of the items and that was handled without issue. We enjoyed the Texas Sampler (wings, stuffed jalapenos, state roll of texas, fried pickles), brisket and chicken tenders.  Everyone in our party raved about the food and we even ordered more throughout the night.  We ordered ALOT of the specialty pitchers of alcohol and they must have been really good because they just couldn't disappear any faster.The dueling pianos were absolutely fantastic.  They kept the entire place entertained the whole night. Although our night was an absolute success and we will, without a doubt, be returning to HoQ there were a few things that could use a little improvement. The seating/tables in front of the stage are absolutely packed in like sardines. I understand that the more people the more money but it can become uncomfortable real quick.  With the amount of people at those tables they should look at the amount of staff dedicated to that area. I am not sure if they could do anything about the temperature inside the building because the entire front is left open to entice people passing by to come in but it was about a million degrees in the place all night.
2018-07-25,4,Really good spot. Awesome atmosphere with a sweet Southern charm and great view by the water. I went on a Sunday afternoon but I'm sure it's a hot spot on a weekend night. They had signs up for Dueling Pianos every Saturday night which sounded like a great night out too. Had the State Roll of Texas, Fried Pickle Spears, BBQ Quesadillas, Curley Fries, Pulled Pork, and Brisket. Everything was amazing and probably the best quesadilla I ever had. The chicken was so juicy and The State Roll of Texas was practically orgasmic. The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was because the brisket was a bit dry. But the house BBQ sauce was slamming and had to have a cocktail so I got the Driftwood Sunset Punch and it was quite delish. Definitely will be returning...and with more friends.
2018-07-19,4,Being from Texas (and doing college in Austin) I have a soft spot for what they're trying to do here. It's great having Shiner available on tap, the margaritas are pretty good (other than the spicy margarita, wasn't a fan - not really spicy enough). The BBQ is pretty good as well, close enough for NJ!Definitely come on a weekend to check out the dueling pianos, but make sure to make a reservation to get a good spot.
2018-07-08,1,Worst BBQ I ever had in my life. Got the brisket that was loaded with fat and the pork ribs that were dry and tastless. All items are al-a-cart and do not include sides. Everything is extra. I will never go back. Not worth my hard earned money.
2018-07-05,3,This place can be really great or really average depending on what you're looking for. The space is great. It's very open and fun, and the outdoor seating is in a prime Hoboken location--right by the river with great views. The drinks are also pretty good. However, the food is extremely average. Nothing was bad, but the queso dip and nachos were very underwhelming. This was a big minus for me, especially since I was with a large group that was sharing a lot of plates. I would recommend, but only for the space and the drinks.
2018-06-29,5,I came here with my fiance right before an event we we're going to attend nearby. We love eating meat and we saw this place on Yelp before so we decided to come in.Service: We came at a time where it wasn't super busy, but it played in our favor. We we're helped right away and our food even came right away! Since we were hungry, it was so great that it did.Food: It could be that we were soo hungry since we didn't eat all day that made us believe that the food was so good, but honestly we kept the leftovers and had it the next day and we still love it! We can't believe how good the food was. We ordered one of the combos because we love meat so much and wanted our focus on that. The quality of the food is so juicy, well-cooked, and good the next day. Drinks: We only ordered two tequila shots (house) and I wouldn't recommend it.. just because after drinking it, the terrible taste of the tequila lingered. Eck! I still remember the taste. But I'm sure they have other great drinks! We are definitely coming back because we seriously loved the food that much!
2018-06-24,5,The food was great. The place is very family-friendly. I came here Friday night and there was live music. The singer was taking request from kids and singing with them Disney's songs until late.
2018-06-22,5,Ordered the combo plate and the chicken wings. Brisket was tender and had good flavor and the collard greens were fantastic.
2018-06-22,5,The pitmaster was originally from salt lick in driftwood/austin Texas and moved to nj and lucky to us local to the tri-state area he opened up an awesome big bbq place that is close to the path. The brisket was unreal. The mac n cheese could have been better but there were so many great sides to choose from. Cafeteria style like hill country. Just a great place
2018-06-18,5,Love this spot! Great food. Great atmosphere... fun for a group. Especially enjoy dueling pianos on Saturday nights.
2018-06-17,3,House of Que, I have mixed feelings. The Longhorn, is a stacked 2 platters full of meat : Ribs, Sausage, Brisket, Smoked chicken served along with your choice of 4 Large sides or 2 Texas size sides. Like other yelpers, I too will vouch for the corn pudding, sweet & savory compliments the food well. Chili, Mac and cheese were both adequate but I cant see them being anything anyone is going to write home about. The chicken and ribs were the most delicious items, the brisket wasn't bad but it was cold which made the meat a bit tough, the sausages had the texture of Hillshire farms turkey kielbasa, to be honest I would've been happier with that.The restaurant has plenty of seating which can accommodate large groups, the service however left much to be desired. Our server was pretty flippant about serving us after he put down the pitcher of water. Went missing for about 15 minutes when he returned we were ready to put in drinks and apps. He took down one drink, the app then said he was going to put the app in real quick, Disappeared again, had to ask the food runner if we could put in drinks, were told he would get the waiter, 95% finished with our apps and the waiter finally returned to take these drink orders. I understand it was a nice day out but this guy seemed like he was on another planet and really the only bad part of this otherwise decent experience. Also this doesnt speak for service at this place as a whole as other servers did seem attentive like they were actually trying to earn their tips.
2018-06-14,5,Me and my wife are from St. Louis and I never write reviews but I like to read restaurant reviews when we travel.  We are visiting family in Hoboken, NJ and being that we are from St. Louis I was trying to find a good BBQ place to eat.  After finding House of Que I looked at their reviews and they had some good once and some not so good.  But me and my wife decided to give it a chance.  I must say it was one of the best BBQ places i have been too.  From the minute we got there we were greeted by the young hostess and go a table outside right a way.  our waitress was very polite and service was very fast and really good.  We ordered 2 of their signature Tea cocktails which were very good.  We had their BBQ wings for appetizer (which were half price on Wednesday) and they were really delicious.  Then we got Brisket and chicken with side of their corn pudding and mac & cheese.  I must say best brisket i ever tasted.  5 minutes in to our diner a manager came over to see how we were doing and after we told him we were from St. Louis he told us about the restaurant and the chef being from Texas.  Both the young waitress and the manager check on us multiple times.  I must say if you are in the mood for good BBQ food and great customer service THIS IS A PLACE TO GO.
2018-06-03,4,This place has great fried pickles and mac & cheese, a fun beer tower deal (not sure if it actually saves any money but beer towers are fun), and good vibes. It's laid back, I've never had a problem with the service, and the prices are pretty standard for the area.I love their dueling piano nights and I would go every week if my friends would let me--if you live in Hoboken you can't miss this (it's probably not necessary, but I usually make a reservation when I go). Trivia Tuesdays are also fun.The reason I can't give them five stars is that they used to have dueling pianos on Fridays and Saturdays and now it's only on Saturdays and I am heartbroken.
2018-05-26,3,The corn pudding omg... corn pudding!!!!  so damn good!!!!! Its was a good portion to share with 2 with the medium size.  Now let get to the meat, ribs were fabulous!! Brisket was a ok, kinda missing something like favor not just a smoked taste.  Sausage, not missing  nothing at all.  A little pricey to buy all meats,beat deal might be to get it during lunch hour specials. Ending wasting about $95 with tip.  Bought thing all separate not in the combo price they offer.Service sucked!!!!!  Waitress had no knowledge of their special drinks, couldn't recommend a customers favorite.  It was like pulling teeth when asking how something tasted, sweet/spicy/ well done ect ect....
2018-05-25,1,Came here for dinner with my family since my mom has been dying to come here. Arrived at 10pm on a Friday and there was a good crowd and ambiance. The hostess sat us but didn't give us any menus, we only had the one menu on the table (there was 4 of us). The waitress came 3 minutes later asking if we were ready to order, but we told her we needed a few more minutes. She came 15mins later and told us the kitchen was closed but it was only 10:17pm and it isn't suppose to close until 10:30pm. I'm not one to complain but the service just ruined the entire experience. Maybe lunch is better, but I won't be back to find out.However, Donna saved the night. She wasn't even our waitress and she checked up on us, served our food, refilled and explained the BBQ sauce. That star is for Donna
2018-05-16,4,Ordered delivery. It said the food was coming within 70-80 mins. It came in 35 minutes. All the food was delicious. Good portions. It comes with extra sides of bbq sauce without having to ask for it. Highly satisfied.
2018-05-13,1,Ambience: COOLHometown, country, & rustic BBQ joint.  There is a variety of seating booths, bench with picnic tables and high tables. Cafeteria style seating mostly throughout. The tables could be a bit further apart for comfort and fire safetyFood: OKWe had -beef brisket which was tender, moist & delicious - BBQ wings sweet and surprising spicy sauce - Hamburger, we requested medium well. However is was dry cooked to a crisp -fries, ok Service: AWFUL! Extremely disappointing. We were greeted with an attitude. We were unnecessarily lied to about a table we requested to sit at. The manager Dino and hostess  Estefania stated a customer specifically reserved a window seat we requested. Turns out that was a lie, as I asked the customer. He then backpedaled and stated "customers that make reservations 2 weeks in advance gets preferential seating; we made our reservations ~2 hours before arriving. When I asked him why he lied to us. He stated he does not want to be interrogated. We were given 50% off our bill. However my mother's day was already ruined. Discounts don't make up for poor service. *In addition when I requested for the manager to come our table he sent another manger (who's under him) Kayla who was very polite. But she was there because he was now trying to avoid us, because we discovered his lie. This experience was like being in the Twilight Zone! I love BBQ. I was hoping to make this place a regular stop, as we work in the area. But the service was just too awful. Customer service training might go a long way. We dine out equally for the service and food.
2018-05-12,3,Okay barbecue place for the area, good place for large groups.We came with a large party and split a platter for four, along with some additional sides and an extra half pound of ribs. The meat was flavored decently but a bit on the saltier end, although I found the chicken to be fairly tender and flavorful; it was probably the best meat I had for the meal. The fries were fairly well-prepared and seasoned, while the mac and cheese was pretty mediocre. It's a bit on the pricier end for the quality of the meal, but it's spacious and can hold large parties.
2018-05-11,4,brisket is really good.. the thursday lady night drinks are great and the dan the karaoke guy is my fav.. my only suggestion would be keeping him longer than 10 pm he was really hyping the place up and had to stop.. so silly
2018-05-10,2,We went to this place because the prices didn't look too bad, especially for waterfront Hoboken ($10 salad, $14 sandwich, etc.). We figured that we'd end up spending just as much at Panera, so we went in. We should have just went to Panera. We tried the brisket, chicken, salad, and drinks. The brisket was passable, the chicken was absolute trash (like, horrible chewy quality), and the salad was fine (I say that because I should have known better than to order a salad from a BBQ joint). The service- we sat in the bar area- was marginal, at best: super pushy and annoying. If I didn't know what I wanted less than 10 seconds ago, I'm probably still not going to know now! The food, as I said, was edible, but nothing that I'd ever seek again. My boyfriend and I spoke about how we'd rather have a spicy chicken sandwich from Burger King than anything that we got here. Plates/serving wares were kind of odd as well; they jammed everything from fries to lettuce to a sandwich in these tiny baskets. It wasn't like it was a lot of food, spilling over- it was just a weirdly tiny basket-like thing. To compensate, the server gave us little plastic plates from the mess hall at Girl Scout camp, so I guess that ended up being fine? Just kind of weird to have an issue be an insufficiently sized plate/basket. The saving grace was the ambience. It was a nice evening, the windows were open, there were tons of TVs for watching sports, and it wasn't too loud or crowded. Might return on an 'activity'-themed night for the dueling pianos or trivia, but I'd probably just get a water and call it a day.
2018-05-07,3,Pretty average food but the ambiance does remind me of BBQ places in Austin! So great job on that! We were fortunate enough to be seated in one of the booths that circle around the perimeter of the main eating area. The seats in the middle of the restaurant are more family-style bench seating with picnic tables. Super casual restaurant, the food typically arrives in paper on a tray or lined basket. I think only one dish was served on an actual plate. Drinks are also in plastic cups.We had a couple cocktails -- both didn't taste very strong but did pack a punch later! Our meal consisted of:Bring on the Belly Brisket sandwichPound of Ribs Mac and cheeseCorn puddingOverall the meal was average. There were some highs -- the corn pudding and pork ribs and some lows -- bring on the belly appetizer and mac and cheese. The pork belly appetizer was disappointing because it was very flavorful but super dry and tough! Pork belly should be soft and succulent.. this wasn't.  Also, don't waste your money ordering the mac and cheese. This is reminiscent of KFC mac n cheese or the kind you'd get in a school cafeteria.We did love the corn pudding though! We could have had a large order each! Very sweet, this could almost be your dessert!The pork ribs were very tender--fall off the bone, even. Great smoke flavor. Their house made BBQ sauce is also very good! The brisket sandwich was just average. A little lean and tougher than I prefer for brisket.The dueling pianos were the highlight of the meal! We came a little before they started, so just a warning--the pianos get VERY loud!
2018-05-04,3,Since my previous review things have changed at House of Que. The Good is still good. It's likely the best BBQ in Hoboken. But I would put an asterisk on that - Hamilton Pork, which is 1 mile away in Jersey City absolutely blows House of Que out of the water. But, it's in Jersey City - and not on the waterfront.The Bad has changed. They fixed the drink & ordering process. This is very good - but now I have a major complaint. We arrived, sat down, ordered the food on a Friday night in which 1/3 of the restaurant was full, with mostly people sitting outside. It took 50 minutes for our food to arrive. On top of that when we showed up at 6:10pm, we asked for a seat outside. They had a waiting list. It was 4 names ahead of me. No problem, there were two open tables and I told them I would wait. It took 45 minutes to get a seat for myself, two others and a baby. I'm sorry but House of Que really isn't worth the hassle. I doubt I will be back anytime soon. My friends were in from out of town with their baby and I wanted to try something good by the waterfront. We liked the BBQ. The manager, to his credit, did comp us a free round of beers.But when you are arrive by 6:10, get a seat by 7pm, eating by 7:50pm - and then add up a free round of drinks - still doesn't really take away the annoyance of our visit. I get it was busy outside, but the outdoor seating design needs to be improved. They have six-top seating outside, and often two people are seated at a table. These are the changes I would make:1. To sit at a table you need at least three people. If two or less show up, they should sit at the chairs that line the "bar" that faces inside.2. If someone signs up on a waitlist, they should be reasonably close. If your name is called out, and you aren't there - you lost your spot in line. I saw multiple tables that were open for 10+ minutes while we were waiting for a seat.3. While i'm glad they made the changes to ordering, it really slowed down ordering food and waiting for food. Bring back the cafeteria style ordering (at least for the slow cooked food, like chicken/ribs/brisket/sausage/etc). This should already be prepared, it isn't like someone is cooking the slow cooked food for the first time.4. How about vinyl cushions to line the bench seating? Yeah, maybe i'm old but those outdoor bench seats are killer on my back.5. If people want to sit outside and drink, that's cool. But I saw tables order food and then sip water for 30 minutes after they were done while a line of people are waiting for a table outside. Something has to be said about turning over tables properly. I used to work at a place that would offer 1/2 priced round to tables to ask the diners to head over to the bar if they were done eating - most reasonable people (especially those who have worked in the bar/restaurant industry) wouldn't be offended by this.I really wish I knew the management and/or owners. If they could just fix their service I would gladly give it four stars again. Right now, it is only three.
2018-05-02,5,The brisket sandwich is hands down one of the most delicious bites of food (not inclusive to sandwiches) I have ever eaten. I cannot believe brisket can be that moist melt in your mouth bite of fatty juicy beefy goodness. When you eat the sandwich, there's lots of that delicious goodness on a tasty but simple bun, pickle, onion that enhance the brisket but allow it to completely shine.

2018-04-30,3,I finally went out to Hoboken for the first time for a friend's birthday and we came to HOQ for dinner and drinks. The vibe is laid back but the bar and tables were packed even at 7:30pm. My friend reserved a table so we had comfortable seating and got to enjoy the dueling piano performance. Just wish were a bit closer to the stage since it was hard to see. Lots of fun though. They played their rendition of some 90s songs, Disney, and even hip hop songs. Very cool vibe and had lots of laughs.The food was good too. I got the HOQ burger which was a solid choice for the night. The burger definitely had some kind of onion mix in it so if you're not into that, you may want to steer clear but I enjoyed it. Fries made it better of course.For those who are curious, there is no cover charge. I'd come back for drinks for sure. Cool vibe, good music, fun crowd.
2018-04-22,3,LOL to the experience, not the food. We joined house of Que for a late lunch with fiends on a Saturday afternoon. We tired for a spot next door at Union Hall, but it was closed due to some baby shower thing. Any who, this LARGE and in charge BBQ joint was filled with it all. Bench style seating, House BBQ sauce, and flavorful que. what wasn't great was the 'Family Fun Saturday' we had to endure during our meal. Thankful we weren't hungover for this or we would have walked out. There. Were. Kids. Everywhere. When we thought it couldn't get any worse, ELMO showed up! After wheels on the bus LIT up my Saturday lunch, we were along for the ride until our meal was done. We went along with the show and couldn't wait to snag the check. The food/drink/service:-ALL GOOD. Average BBQ, but flavorful. -Drinks were great. Spicy marg was splendid and then cider I ordered was fresh and clean. -Service was good! Everything was quick and painless as they knew we weren't aware of Saturday Funday with the kids. We'll be back, but not on Saturday before 3PM. Highly recommend the brisket sandwich!
2018-04-14,1,This was some of the worst service I have ever experienced. It was somewhat busy today but the server was terrible. They brought out only three of the four entrees we ordered, forgetting my daughter's hot dog. Ok missed hot dog so it should take 5 minutes to grill a hot dog on the fly. We asked 4-5 times over the next 45 minutes. No hot dog. My wife walked to the kitchen to ask for our order, and they gave us a side of of Mac and cheese for my daughter to munch on until the hot dog came. Over an hour since we ordered, no hot dog. I got the check and the server had the cojones to put the hot dog on there that we never got, and never apologized. Tried to complain to a manager, but I think I got a head waitress, not the manager. She took half the price of the bill off. This was the third or fourth time we had been there and each time they seemed to be disorganized. The lack of any apology from the waiter as my daughter sat patiently while we ate our lunches was unacceptable.
2018-04-14,1,Music is obnoxiously loud.  Asked the server to turn it down and she couldn't hear me Pint of Guinness are served in a plastic cup.  Different rules for different seating areas.   Staff is unhelpful and restaurant is filthy.  This place is awful. - stay away
2018-04-01,4,Great food and big location. Probably best option for BBQ in Hoboken. Their wings are really good but other stuff isn't as good
2018-03-12,4,We picked House of Que to celebrate our twins' first birthday here last week and couldn't be more pleased with our choice!  House of Que is a family friendly restaurant (so lacking in Hoboken) with a great upbeat vibe and friendly staff. We worked with Natalie (the event manager) to arrange everything at pretty much the last minute and she and the staff were so fab to work with. This is a great venue - bright, airy and spacious if you're looking to do a family get-to-gather, a birthday celebration or any event in general. They have family fun days over the weekend; face painting, balloon making, a band et al ... definitely a hug hit with kids of all ages. We chose Sunday for our small birthday celebration and it was perfect. We ordered party platters from the catering menu and our guests couldn't stop raving about the food - the jalapeno poppers, smoked wings, chicken tenders, fries and brisket were a hit. The drinks were great and Maria, our server was very accommodating. The space is airy and well lit and lends it self for great pics! There's also a small gaming arcade for kids at the back of the restaurant. Besides family fun weekends, House of Que has great lunch specials and live music nights. We plan to go back soon!
2018-03-07,4,Wanted a quick bite of something tasty while in the Hoboken area, I looked up and I smelled something in the air. There was House of Que, it was early Tuesday evening so it was a bit empty, but not a problem because the food was amazing. I had the pulled pork sandwich along side some zesty curly fries. The sauce was very tasty. I can't wait to go back with a bigger appetite to try out some more items on the menu.
2018-03-06,3,Although House of Que smells like bathroom cleaner, I must say that their brisket is actually pretty good.Our party of four showed up on a Thursday at around 6 and aside from what looked like a small company having a work HH, and a few families, the place wasn't too packed. We decided to go with the Pitmaster's Pick for 4 (1 lb of brisket, 4 ribs, 4 sausage links, half a smoked chicken, and 4 medium sides). The brisket was very tender. It needed a bit more flavor but the BBQ sauce definitely helped. The ribs weren't bad, the sausage links were tough and super salty, and the chicken was dry. As for sides, we got the collard greens (super salty), potato salad, beans, and cole slaw, which was great.While it wasn't the best BBQ, there don't seem to be a lot of BBQ options in Hoboken. That being said, if I come back, I'll just get the brisket and cole slaw, or maybe try one of their sammies.Tip - HH is Mon-Fri (11 am to 7 pm). Just don't get the 'house wine'. It was probably the most terrible wine I've ever had in my life.
2018-02-24,2,House of Que is supposed to be Texas bbq but the only highlight of the restaurant was the dueling pianos that were playing the weekend night we went. I was there for a birthday party and therefore the ability to request and dedicate songs was fun. The performers themselves were very talented and comedic and blunt lol.The food was dry and reminded me nothing of Texas, also over priced. Only the hot dog was decent and that's not real meat. Wouldn't come back.
2018-02-23,1,Very disappointed in my recent trip to House of Que on 2/22. Seems like I come here less and less now and the service and quality deteriorates. Used to come all the time, bring my friend's... that's when the bartenders were absolutely awesome. The only one still there is Rocco. Anyway so this time around... National Margarita Day, they get the promo wrong, terrible drinks and food was okay at most. First off, promo that was texted out was "margaritas 1/2 price all day", we get there and the bartender tells us it's frozen margaritas. Misled. Then she tells us after 7pm it's ladies 1/2 price bar, so okay now we order our spicy margaritas on the rocks, The weakest, most bland tasting drink we've ever had and the lowest grade of tequila. They never made them this way, just because you're running a promo you shouldn't change the quality of the drinks. Then the manager came around and asked how everything was and we told him the drinks sucked, he asked how and we took him just blah, no alcohol in it. He told us it was a new bartender and he will give us extra tequila.  That didn't work one bit, drink still tasted like trash. At the very least, he should've offered to remake the 2 spicy margaritas. Then it was bill time, he tells us he gave us a discount, sure it was like $2 off. So 3 frozen margaritas, 1 beer, 2 spicy margaritas, an order of wings and loaded fries = $93 + tip. Repeat customer officially lost.
2018-02-21,5,good food and bbq and music is a fun environment with two guys playung piano were they work for there money literally
2018-02-16,4,Delicious barbecue and incredibly fun nightlife. Dueling pianos and drool-worthy food, corn breaks, how can you go wrong?! They often host karaoke nights as well. It's fun for large parties. A couple times we've had slow service (or I'd rank all 5 stars!) Each visit has always been fun so it's hard to even complain about any type of wait!
2018-02-04,3,Highly recommend coming here for the Dueling Pianos. I can't remember their names, but both of them are so talented. They can pretty much sing anything!As for the food, the corn pudding is amazing. I thought it would be a cream since it said "pudding", but it was more like a corn bread served in a cup. The bread is buttery heaven, so moist and warm. The corn gives it some texture and additional flavor. I highly recommend trying it! I also had a BBQ chicken sandwich, but it wasn't as good. It had ok flavor, but the chicken is extremely dry. Expected much more from a BBQ place, especially when it boasts bringing Austin to Hoboken. Drinks are okay priced - $8-9 a drink. They make a great gin and tonic. Shots on the other hand, are pretty expensive. $8 for a shot in the small plastic cup. Not worth it.I'll certainly be back for Dueling Pianos, but not sure I'll be here for the food otherwise.
2018-01-24,2,I was looking forward to trying this place after hearing good things but it was just ok.  Ribs were the best of the smoked meats and corn pudding was the best side.  They were slightly above average but nothing to write home about.  Everything else was average.  Not bad, nice place, server was nice but the food is average and because of that it is overpriced.
2018-01-16,4,I came here with my boyfriend and his best friend and we have not stopped talking about the chips and queso blanco. You have the option to add in meat to the queso. We added the brisket into ours and it was life-changing.We got the platter that feeds four and comes with two large sides. You can't get fries as one of those sides; you have to choose from their list then pay additional for the fries, so you basically have three sides. Other than that, the chips and queso and drinks were awesome.
2017-12-25,1,This is the third time I'm giving this place a chance and I am making my review final.Service seems to be getting worse and worse as the staff in this place are extremely lazy and clueless.The barbecue in this place is entirely flavorless and dry, it doesn't even seem like they use a smoker it seems like it's baked in a regular oven.I've left a review for this place in the past and the owner made it a point to get my review erased from Yelp and was offended when I spoke the truth. If you are in the mood for barbecue go to Jersey City and try Hamilton pork.  It's well worth it believe me.
2017-12-21,3,The food was great, they had live music when I went , the band was good the only issue I had was the guy at the door checking IDs was rude, and we didn't see a server for a good half of the night after she took our order.
2017-12-16,5,My husband and I had our rehearsal dinner here, and it was just amazing! Not only is the food delicious, but the drinks are fantastic and the staff is super friendly. The view (waterfront!) is unbeatable, and all of our guests are still raving about how cool it was to do our rehearsal dinner there.
2017-12-05,4,I came here with my fiance after running the city challenge race in Hoboken for some celebratory drinks (a free one for race participants) and celebratory wings. We sat at the bar and unfortunately the bartender didn't honor the free drink without the drink ticket... which is attached to your race bib and seemingly gets ripped off when running obstacles. Not a deal breaker and of course there are in house policies, but it would have been nice for this to still be honored.In any case, can't go wrong with beers in general (most of the time), but really came to review the delicious smoked wings. Marinated so well, peppery with an incredible BBQ sauce. Highly recommend stopping by for this solely.
2017-12-05,5,I don't think these reviews do this place justice!! Easily one of the best restaurants in Hoboken. Chris was an especially great server - he spent so much time chatting with us about traveling and his hometown! Thank you Chris and thank you HOQ!!
2017-11-14,4,Meat!!!! Yum. Was here in August for a birthday celebration and loved everything! Fun part of Hoboken, cool atmosphere. Sadly missed the live music. Corn pudding and ribs are must haves. Yum!
2017-11-03,1,DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE. I ordered via Seamless the brisket sandwich with two sides- mac and cheese and potato salad. The food came and was lukewarm at best. The macaroni and cheese tasted like it was from a frozen dinner and the brisket so overcooked and fatty it was literally inedible. I contacted Seamless with photos at the ready and they contacted the restaurant. The girl, Jenna, apologized and asked how she could make it right. I was so grossed out I just asked for a refund which she outright refused. The only solution she offered was sending another sandwich- why would I want another sandwich when the first one was so repulsive? It's not like they just forgot something. I am completely grossed out and lost my appetite. Why would Jenna ask how to make it right if you can only offer one solution? I had Seamless call back to get her name and she hung up on them. I strongly advised Seamless not to work with them in the future. Gross food and awful customer service makes me wonder how much longer this place will last. Avoid avoid avoid.
2017-10-25,1,I loved house of que until tonight. Me and my friend walked in at 10:19PM and they had all the chairs up and said they were closed. The doors say you close at 2am and the site says 12am. It looked like staff was more happy about counting their tips behind the counter vs helping us and seating us. Horrible service!
2017-10-12,3,FOR Delivery: guys the rumors are true, delivery is really really slow and our order came with no BBQ sauce at all even though I asked for extra on the side!
2017-10-08,4,Oh yes! I have been yearning for the corn pudding since I left.  I'm glad I listened to other yelpers and tried it. It's delicious.  So get it.  Seriously. The brisket sandwich with fries was good. I also enjoyed the platter of brisket and ribs. They were solid without fuss and tasty.  I  got to really enjoy the flavor of the meat.  The Mac and cheese was OK.  The greens were good especially when I added a little bit of Tabasco for heat. Overall a strong barbecue meal with a great location. We got to sit outside and enjoy a great view!
2017-09-30,1,If you are coming in as a couple to enjoy the piano players just forget about it and turn around. They "reserve" ALL the tables by the piano to groups. The staff is not accommodating whatsoever. I came in with a friend and the manager was super rude when we pointed out at the empty tables.
2017-09-17,5,I've been fortune enough to have visited a bunch of great BBQ spots near the University of Georgia and House of Que is right up there with those authentic places. I highly recommend a visit to House of Que to enjoy the smoked brisket, delicious sides, etc.
2017-09-12,4,The drinks were interesting. Ambience was good... live music. Service was good. We ordered the spicy drinks... extremely tasty
2017-09-11,4,Fun place to go on a summer night! We sat outside on the patio with great views of the city. The service was good and beers reasonably priced. The BBQ was better than I expected - their brisket is actually really good! Also tried the pulled pork which was a little dry. The white queso appetizer was a hit with our table too! Overall it was a nice restaurant to sit outside with a few drinks and enjoy a summer night on the river.
2017-09-07,5,hoq is great service and great food...great place to watch a game unlike some other places in hoboken where you are surrounded by a bunch of bros whoever runs this place is doing a terrific job, hats off to them as michael corleone would say: don't ever take sides with anyone against the family
2017-09-06,2,You can find better barbecue elsewhere. My family and I were craving for some serious "low and slow" barbecue process and came here with high hopes based on yelp reviews. The prices doesn't do justice. The brisket, ribs and Chicken didn't have any barbecue flavor at all. Makes me wonder what type of wood they use to smoke them. The sausages were very dry. Not sure what everyone was talking about... I guess they all have bland palettes.
2017-09-03,3,The meat was tender but a little salty. Baby back ribs, pork sausages, beef brisket. The cornbread was dry.
2017-09-01,5,It's my favorite sports bar when it comes to big games. I was here to watch World Series 2016 and Super Bowl 2017. It's very friendly environment. The waitress are very nice and they have a really big screen. My friend he loves the steak here a lot.
2017-08-29,4,A fun place to go to Happy Hour after work. The margaritas were half off & came out really quick. The foods pretty good but expensive. The corn pudding side is a must have when you go there!! The baked potato is a great choice for an entree - it's big & you can load it up with whatever you want (pulled pork, cheese, sour cream, etc). We sat outside on a beautiful night. Their patio overlooks the city so you get food & a view.
2017-08-20,3,So we went back to Que last night for dueling pianos.  Our server, Ross, was amazing.  He worked hard, he read his tables and catered to all of them, including us!!!!  We had wings and nachos, which were good.  I had peach sangria, tasty, but a little bland.  We added Malibu, and it gave it the right amount of flavor.It was dueling pianos last night.  Great concept.  Sound was a little off (the guy was close to us and harder to hear).  The girl was, by far, much clearer and therefore better.  BUT, and there is always a but.  Dueling Pianos gives out a request slip to play songs you like, and you give them money for this request (not free of charge).  We were early.  We sent in 4 requests with money inside.  It became apparent as the night went on that the more money you gave, the quicker your songs were played, if at all.  I understand they are there to make money, but to hear all night "I have 5 good reasons to play this song",  "I have 20 good reasons to put this song to the top", "I have 50 good reasons to play this song again".  I get it!  Money gets the songs played, but while we were there so early without the 20 and 50 good reasons, our songs still did not get played, so therefore, we essentially just tipped them for the entertainment.So should Que charge so this doesn't happen?  Should the dueling pianos put an exact number to be paid for a song so that those with more money don't get their songs all night.  Table 42,34, that is all we heard all night.It was definitely entertaining, but something needs to be tweaked.
2017-08-19,1,Let me start off by saying I will never come back to House of Q again and I will say why okay one I did not know it was live music night but like most places you think you would be courteous to some people who actually want to have a quiet peaceful meal or at least a decent sounding conversation so the music doesn't override you and this case they didn't have a private room like Maxwell Tavern did so it was hard for me to even enjoy myself I could not talk I could not think I could not speak to my friends and have a conversation or sit down and eat I actually lost my appetite all I got was a bottle of water and then I found out that it's a $15 minimum if you want to pay with card so if you come to this place getting something cheap you better have cash it makes the night worse knowing that parking sucks around here there's a parking lot around from house of q but it's $25 good luck I want to come back here if they gave me free food for life
2017-08-16,1,Ordered a pulled pork sandwich, mac and cheese, beans and brisket. The one star is for the beans. The brisket has no flavor, the mac and cheese wasn't edible. I spat it out. The pulled pork also had no flavor. This is by far the absolute worst take out I have ever had from any establishment. I'm appalled they even serve this stuff. GROSS.
2017-08-11,1,This review is based on multiple visits. Food is average, sometimes okay and sometimes is very bad. Service is not something that I would recommend to other places to study from. Rude approach and disorder when crowded. We will not come back to this place due to an average food and bad service.
2017-08-05,5,Before House of Que opened, to get any decent BBQ, I'd have to traverse into Manhattan and wait 2+ hours for a table. I've been here a few times since it opened in 2015, on different days of the week and at different hours. Food is consistently good. I brought friends a few time and they loved it too. The nights with live music could get pretty packed. Hoboken really has every kind of food that I care about now. Awesome BBQ at my door step, no need to trek into NYC anymore, yay!
2017-08-01,3,I think this place was average. The live music and atmosphere were great, and I love the way they open the windows on the summer days/nights. Definitely a plus. They offer both indoor and outdoor seating.The drinks were great. The Big Tex Palmer and the HOQ Spiked Lemon Tea were fantastic. We kept the drinks coming! However, the food was nothing special. The Queso Blanco was okay. Fried Pickle Spears should have had way more to them - the appetizer only included 5 pickles and it just looked scarce on the plate. The Pork Ribs were very fatty and the HOQ Chicken Sandwich almost reminded me of fast food. Overall, it was very average. I had higher expectations for this place.
2017-07-28,4,Love the vibe in this place. The food is delicious too! The drinks are great and most of the bartenders are really nice. The decor is really cool and it's just an overall chill place. My only complaint is sometimes it's gets really overcrowded where you can't get a table in the front or at the bar. But I definitely understand why! :)
2017-07-16,3,You don't go to HOQ for the food; you go for the view. The barbecue is mediocre at best with uninspired options. The smoked meats are dry rubbed and there is BBQ sauce on the table. The fried pickles were five spears to an order; they were well-fried, with a creamy ranch dressing. I had the pulled pork sandwich, which was stacked with meat, Coleslaw, and a splash of sauce. The sandwich doesn't come with any sides, but for the size of the sandwich, you don't need anything else. Outdoor seating is the best part of the experience. Situated right on Sinatra drive, you have a prime view of the Empire State Building. Tables are picnic style (communal style indoors) with condiments and paper towels already on the table.
2017-07-11,5,Omggg The brisket was wonderful!!!!!! My boyfriend and i had a great time tonight and the atmosphere was great!!!! We will be back!!!
2017-07-05,2,Admittedly, this isn't a review for the food. My boyfriend and I tried to go here on the night of the derby and it was crowded.  The hostess didn't seem too engaged with customers, and plopped us down unceremoniously at a table that looked like it had been semi occupied just moments before, a full beer can on the picnic table.  We asked for another spot as we thought it was occupied but she just moved the beer.  We ended up not staying because the service was already uncaring and we assumed it wouldn't get better.  Will update if we try again, but as a hostess you probably shouldn't look like you hate everything even if you do.
2017-07-04,3,Been hearing a lot of good things about this place and seeing as it is also by the water, a beautiful July 4th day was perfect to try it. I came here with reservations for 12:30pm but didn't really need it because the place was pretty empty. I am assuming it is because of the holiday weekend as every time i drive by it looks busy. House of Que offers both inside and outside seating. The outside gives you a nice view of the water and city. We opted for the inside as it was very hot today.The staff here were very helpful and extremely friendly. Once seated we were greeted by our waiter who made a few recommendations for us. My group decided on a pound of the smoked wings naked and the Pickmaster's Pick combo with 4 sides. The combo includes 1lb of brisket, 4 ribs, 4 sausage links and half a smoked chicken. For the sides we got the mac salad, mac and cheese, slaw, and chili. The food unfortunately looked a lot better than it tasted minus the chicken. The chicken items were all surprising really good! My favorite was the smoked wings. Getting them naked really brings out the smokey taste and when dipped with ranch, it turns it into an epic appetizer. Everything else tasted okay. To be honest most of the items were very bland. Even when dipped with one of the two sauces provided it still wasn't that great. The sides were nothing to talk about either. It wasn't great but it wasn't so awful that it was not edible.Overall, this place is very average. I was extremely impressed by their staff and how quickly all the food came. The food won't blow your mind but it will definitely get you full. Next time I come I will just be sticking with the wings and drinks.
2017-06-21,3,Not much of a fan of this place. Since there arent many BBQ spots in hoboken, there arent  any other options if your craving bbq. It would be unfair to say this place is bad but the food just doesnt have the flavor of authentic BBQ compared to other places I have been too.Pros: Alot of seating, Bar, Normal service (nothing over the top) and TV'sCons: Food is normal (nothing over the top)I would come back and give it a second chance.
2017-06-18,1,Used to be a really solid place. Food went from above average BBQ to on par with microwaveable bbq. Check out photo of the "sloppy Texan", including extra bacon for 20% extra. Service is terrible too. Would never come back.
2017-06-13,5,Visited House of Que recently on a Friday night with some girl friends. We took the train into Hoboken, and the fact that this place is only a short walk away was a definite plus. Reservations can be made on OpenTable, and we were able to easily push ours back a half hour since we missed the earlier train. We were seated promptly, near the stage where they have live music, which was our only qualm as we had to shout a bit to hear each other talk. But we are pretty easy going and made the best of it. It was a warm night, so the windows were open to a patio area and offered great views of the city. The windows being open also offered extra bar-like seating facing into the restaurant, which I thought was a great use of the space.My party ordered the fried pickle spears, Texas 3 cheese nachos, state roll of Texas & two pitchers of the ruby red sangria to share. Everything was delicious. The only thing I would pass on for next time is the state roll of Texas which was a little too spicy for my taste (but for reference, my taste buds are sensitive to spice). I ordered the HOQ burger: a 1/2 lb ground beef & smoked brisket patty with lettuce, tomato, pickled onions, american cheese, queso & special sauce on a brioche bun served with fries. I also added the bacon option. I was so hungry and it smelled so good that I forgot to take a picture to show. It was cooked just the way I asked, medium well. Even though the burger was juicy, the brioche bun kept from getting soggy.We didn't stay for dessert this time, but I think it's safe to say that we will be back again for another low-key girls night out!
2017-06-12,3,For our visit, we had the chicken and it was quite salty, and a little undercooked on the inside. The corn pudding was good, the nachos were decent, and the frozen margarita was a little too sweet. Both the service and ambiance were great, especially when you're sitting outside and looking over the waterfront.
2017-06-11,4,Up there as BBQ spot. The side portions were massive. All the meats were great - I had brisket, sausage, pulled pork and ribs. All very good. The corn pudding is the bomb.com. Must get! The waiter checked up too much for my liking
2017-06-07,1,I was really excited to taste these ribs and brisket - but I shouldn't of .. I visited there on 6/7/17 around 1:30 pm I walked in and just felt the staff staring at me since no one was there . I awkwardly said hi grabbed the menu the young girl in the front just stared at me then I asked uh can I look at this menu - oh yes go head ... okkkkk I ordered 1/2 ribs 1/4 pork 1/4 brisket ... I said how long the girl said oh it's already ready I then see this other young kid grabbing the meats out of a heating fridge weighing like it was butcher meat and throwing them in a tiny plastic container .. Now we all know you aren't giving us freshly baked meats but at least pretend like they were roasting in the kitchen until I came .. I still gave them benefit of the doubt .. ribs looked dry I asked for BBQ the girl said in the bag - i left I ate .... the meats all three were dry and extremely salty . One bite of each meat my fiancé and I ordered something else for lunch .. one star for the corn pudding ..
2017-05-31,1,I am specifically reviewing the 1/2 pound of brisket I had here on Memorial Day. It was terrible and definitely one of the worst briskets I've ever had. I asked for fatty pieces but instead I got dry and tough pieces. Cutting it with a fork was not possible, if you told me it was top round I would have believed you.The pieces weren't even cut all the way through and were just plopped on the side of the plate.   Presentation counts for something, even if it's just properly layered and cut slices. It must have been the slicers first day since my pieces should have gone on a sandwich or something.One friend also got sliced brisket, and his portion has better than mine. It was fattier and could at least be cut with fork. I probably should have sent it back, but by the time I ate enough to know it wasn't going to get any better it was too late. Sometimes you just have to take the loss.Five other people seemed to enjoy their assorted sandwiches and salads, and the Palmer spiked tea got rave reviews from a few. Give it a try if that's what you're looking for, but as a place serving Texas style brisket it is a hard pass for me.
2017-05-27,1,This place is trash...honestly u get better BBQ at the fire pit in Belleville...the smoke flavor on the chicken was just weird!! Not to mention wit the ribs which were also dry!! Big disappointment to say the least!!! Don't waste ur time here honestly!!!! Place deserves 0 stars!!!
2017-05-22,5,Entertained about 75 guests at the House of Que for a party last night.  Our guests had so much fun. The food, the service, the space and the entertainment was enjoyed by everyone!  Appetizers were brought out on time and ample service staff was provided to keep the crowd well taken care of.  Thank you and your staff for everything !   So glad we held our party at the House of Que!
2017-05-20,1,This place may be the biggest shithole I ever been in. Sitting at a picnic table eating chicken fingers that taste like they came out of a freezer after 2 years. If they had a noose I may have hung it up. iF u ever wanna get some aggression out go here on piano night there's plenty of jerk offs in the crowd who think they know all the words signing in ur ear and any one of them would make a perfect person to pick up your first manslaughter charge on.
2017-05-20,1,I am currently here with a group of 16 people - was a reservation made ahead of time for a birthday -- let me tell you how this is unfolding...1. We sat down at 8pm - asked for waters for the table -- just got them at 9:35pm2. I asked for two new beers about 30 min ago before my meal came out - I have since finished my meal and my beers never came.3. Speaking of meals -- I ordered the pound of brisket. 3 other people did as well. For a total of 4 lbs of brisket. They brought out one tray of brisket and a half tray combined with someone else's order and tried to pass it off as 4 lbs of brisket that were apparently supposed to be shared between the 4 orders even though we were all at opposite ends of the tables....also pretty sure that doesn't add up to 4 lbs....i would think that each order would come on a separate tray since, you know, they are all separate orders....they then tried to pass it up as a complete order and only came over 20 min later with magically 2 lbs of brisket after we had all tried to ration out the measly questionable 1.5 lbs on our table. This has been far from the only error of the night --  What a disaster. 4. There have been multiple occasions where they have come to our table with other peoples orders/food. I feel bad for those people too..5. It's now almost 10 and I still never got those beers...The service here is a train wreck and I would avoid it at all costs if you have a large party for dinner!!!!
2017-05-20,5,I'm in love with this place! I've been here three times now and love it more and more every time I go. My favorite thing on their menu is the pulled pork sandwich. I'm not HUGE on barbecue sauce but the ones that they provide are great. The service was always amazing and the atmosphere is always GREAT. It's my new favorite spot in Hoboken!
2017-05-15,3,Deliecery was swift. I like their bbq sauce and corn pudding. But ribs were pretty bad. I like Carvao's bbq better.
2017-05-08,5,This is my new favorite place in Hobo. The bbq chicken tenders and homemade ranch are to die for. The bar tenders are really chill and cool too. It's awesome when the weather is nice and you can sit outside at the bar. Also have been here to watch Rangers games and they're always accommodating with the tvs. Love this place!
2017-05-01,4,House of que is great because it is so versatile. I go there when my family comes into visit and it's always a crowd pleaser, but they also offer a great happy hour (and celebrate my favorite holidays like national margarita day...). I tend to go here a lot after work with some coworkers.Overall, great place, great food.
2017-04-29,3,Really smoky BBQ and that's a good thing. Lovely Saturday nights with the dueling pianos, but if you're drinking it's best to stick with beer since they water down all the mixed drinks.
2017-04-29,4,Easygoing laid back atmosphere. Food is great Free refills.  Friendly staff.  Great place to watch sports.  Lots of tvs. Great selection of food.  Prices are reasonable.  Frito pie yumm!
2017-04-29,5,First of all, let me just say--the bar is SO cool here.  It wraps around so that you can actually be sitting outside (and everyone else getting fresh air) on a warm night.  The happy hour specials look great (Tito's for $5 M-F, 11-7!) and the vibe is perfect for watching a game on their massive TV.  The view from the patio is gorgeous--it's right across the street from the river with views of the NYC skyline, provided a giant camper van doesn't park directly in front of you  lol.  It smells like heaven and the food is great.  The pork belly appetizer is surprisingly large for the price, the BBQ sauces on the table are delicious, and everything we tried was very good.  The corn pudding stands out as probably my favorite side, and a good substitute for cornbread with the chili!Service was friendly and the beers came out much faster when our waitress was getting them than when we were at the bar with the other hoards of clientele clawing their way forward for a drink  (weekends are busy!).  We had a great time!
2017-04-20,4,Good BBQ, live music when we went, ambiance was cool  and the rustic feel of the establishment was neat.
2017-04-20,5,OMGEEEE!!!! Go for lunch.  The lunch specials are to die for.  Baked beans and mac n cheese are my favorites.  Don't forget the $6 Spiked Sweet Tea.  Customer Service was great.  Nice place, off the water and the park across the street to "People Watch".  Oh yea, THE BBQ SAUCE!!!!!!!! Couldn't decide, I loved them both.
2017-04-19,3,Went on 4/5 for lunch. I was craving bbq so i found out this place via yelp.  It did have a weird set up where you order the drinks with the wait staff and order the food in line.  But the customer figures it out quickly. Food:  (4/5)  I had the smoked wings and queso blanco.  The smoked wings were pretty fresh and seasoned very well. I am a big of their smoked wings and it is filling on its own. I wanted to try their brisket but I did not want to pay that price tag on it.Service:  (3/5) they were a bit slow. The queso blanco came out fast but the smoked wings took way too long.  I had to ask twice for my water to be refilled.   Atmosphere: (3 /5)  it is a typical bar restaurant atmosphere. It smelled like bbq.  However, i did not like the set up on ordering drinks with someone else and get inline to order the food.
2017-04-04,4,The bar itself is great; live music on the weekends, tons of tvs for sports, lots of space etc etc. But the food . The wings are pretty good and the sausages are decent but other than that it's not very good.  Pulled pork and ribs are average.... and the brisket is the worst one I've actually ever had. I'd go as far as to say I'd rather throw my show in the smoker and eat that than order it again.
2017-04-04,5,One of my favorite bars in Hoboken. They have a lot of fun activities going on during the week and there's always live music which is a plus for me. Food is good, too, if you wanted to come here for dinner. Also a good daylong spot on the weekend. Met the owner during a St Patrick's bar crawl and he was so great it made me love this place even more.
2017-04-01,3,I enjoy coming to HOQ for wings, brisket nachos, and catching a game! However I find that the whole set up is awkward (order drinks with waitstaff but go in line to order? By the time you leave you have 7 different checks) and the people that work there have no clue. I placed an order over the phone and when I arrived it wasn't given to the kitchen and I had to wait anyways..grr!The food itself is okay, but it definitely satisfies my BBQ craving. Overall I like HOQ but I think the execution isn't that great.
2017-03-17,5,Cute spot and glad I came with friends to celebrate saint patty's day. Great food and drinks and would like to come back!
2017-02-26,3,The food was alright. Was good in some places, bad in the other. I got the burger. Anything above medium is cooked like ground beef, as it is very tough. The fries were great, but the BBQ sauces I was mixed on. The 512 sauce was great (was outstanding on the fries and the burger), while the Texas 2 Step was decent. The sauce on the burger was bland and flavor less. Put a BBQ sauce on it. It helps. Overall good service and was a good experience for someone from Jersey, but I would imagine any diehard Southerner would be deeply offended.
2017-02-25,2,Service wasn't great at all. Asked for and ice tea 2 times waited 10 mins...burger came with ketchup packets asked for a bottle of ketchup so I didn't have to bite and squeeze ketchup packets no one brought it over finally my husband went up and asked for it and they gave us a basket of ketchup packets they didn't have ketchup in a bottle. Waited 10 minutes for all of that and the burger was awful anyway. Wings were about the only good thing. Need to improve their service and prove their menu with more options the barbecue itself was just okay I've had much better. Disappointed was really looking for this place to be good.
2017-02-21,3,Mediocre. Not bad, not good. Guess that for Hoboken restaurant quality it's already a great thingOnly option in Hoboken for BBQ ribs. Delivery was fast.
2017-02-20,4,Very good quality Austin smoked BBQ. Very good smoked brisket (better the second time I was there), pulled pork, and chicken. Smoked ribs were excellent. Good sauces on the side. Mac and cheese was just mediocre, but the "corn pudding" was fantastic. And good cold beers. The beer towers were neat too. And the Saturday night Dueling Pianos show is a lot of fun.
2017-02-10,5,Solid barbecue with welcoming service. This is where to go for Austin style smoky ribs, brisket or wings with a side of hospitality and a view of NYC.Came on St. Patty's Day last year. Owners were onsite and made everyone feel like VIPs. They went all out for the big day - free drinks and tshirts were given out. But the best part of the meal aside from the amazing food was the service - exactly what you would want from a small town like Hoboken. They were completely charming and dedicated to making sure every guest that walked in felt welcome. Such sweethearts! Made me like this place even more.The food was awesome. We got the lunch special for $13 with a taste of the ribs, brisket and sausage plus 2 generous sides. The ribs were meaty with a legit bark (a must for any good BBQ). Brisket was super tender. Mac and cheese was perfectly cheesy. Even the collards were delicious! Everything was so good and the place had such a great vibe that we ordered another round of ribs plus wings. Again, smoky and great portion. Can't end a meal like that without dessert - an enormous chocolate chip cookie served warm and warm peach cobbler. Do not leave without trying both. The design was also worth noticing. Lots of communal tables, huge booths and cafeteria style dining option make this the perfect place for groups. Every detail was perfect for Texas BBQ down to the tin ceilings with stars in the ladies room. Plus the whole place was spotless - no sticky menus, clean floors and it smelled only of good ol' bbq. This place gets everything right - food, service, vibe and decor. Does not always happen in Hoboken. We really needed this place. Can't wait to come back on weekends when they will have dueling pianos and walking live guitarists!
2017-02-09,3,Okay friends- this review is based off dinner and rest assured I will tell you like it is. The brisket sandwich with pickles and onions was delicious. The pulled pork was mediocre and the ribs were inedible. They were so dry- the outside skin was tough to chew and had formed a stale crust. They offer a few dipping sauces but those were only OK. The coleslaw needed more mayo/sweetness it was all vinegar and really just not good at all. We didn't try any other sides because we had lost faith.. The service is great and the atmosphere is fun. I don't recommend eating here but the events here at night and drinks are great! Please do something about the food!!! You have so much potential!
2017-01-31,2,Service: great! Atmosphere: cool! Food:.... waste of money. It's edible. But if you're going out to eat, you might as well go somewhere good.
2017-01-29,5,Had a great time on Saturday night.  Food was good and dueling pianos was great. We ordered the big platter for 6 of us and there was extra left over
2017-01-23,2,Came on Sunday to watch the NFC championship game. It was nice because they had all the TVs on, and the game was projected onto a huge screen. There were four of us and we ordered a beer tower and asked our server for a glass of water with it. She told us she'd bring us a pitcher. Fifteen minutes later, we get the beer tower, and our server is nowhere to be found. Another fifteen minutes pass, and our server comes to take our food order. We order the nachos with chicken, wings with chipotle BBQ sauce, and a side of Mac and Cheese. We ask her again for the water. Ten minutes later we finally get the water we asked for forty minutes ago.The food came. The nachos were eh. I added a little bbq sauce to give it some kind of kick but it still wasn't great. The wings were good. The chipotle bbq sauce was sweet and spicy, and the meat came right off the bone. The mac and cheese, on the other hand, was bland and gross. Don't order it.Service isn't too great, and the food isn't either. Probably won't be back.
2017-01-15,3,Barbecue is mediocre but the corn pudding is awesome .  Don't go to this place on a Friday or Saturday night if you enjoy your eardrums.. the live band is obnoxiously loud ..
2017-01-14,5,Yummmmmmmm. Everything was awesome and it has a great vibe. Like brother jimmys but classier and better!
2017-01-11,5,SOOOO GOOD! I had the pulled pork sandwich and corn pudding lunch special. The sandwich was moist and had just the right amount of sauce. There is also a bottle of their 'special sauce' on the table if you want more. Shared the nachos and wings for appetizer. The wings were amazing. Cool atmosphere and decor. Nice location with a great view. Definitely recommend anyone who loves good BBQ to check it out!
2017-01-02,2,Service: 5 starsFood: 2-2.5 stars.Our server, Ross, was great. Extremely informative and attentive to us. Food and drinks came our promptly.The food here, for a smokehouse is very WEAK for the HIGH prices you will pay. I have been to better bbq joints that were either family owned or commercial (think Famous Daves) but HOQ was a let down. The ribs were juicy and had flavor so did the chicken, but we ordered 4 sides and none stood out or were all that great. I'd have to say my most anticipated side in the bbq beans was the biggest underwhelming dish for me personally and everything else was just OK and I say that mildly.The menu seemed a little concise as well for the variety of bbq you can typically get. The prices? Lord, granted take note you are in Hoboken and this place sits right on the water but if you're inside and depending on which way you're seated that view is pretty much nonexistent. The sides were $5 each for a small, and a lb of ribs which was essentially (8) and a 1/2 chicken came to $16 and $9 respectively. Our bill was over $50 bucks.All that for mediocre bbq? I don't think so. I have had far better elsewhere. You wouldnt catch me back here.
2016-12-22,5,Good ass BBQ! Good location and great service! Will be back many times!  Their fudge brownie is outstanding! The beef brisket is amazing!
2016-12-14,4,I went to House of Que early on a Tuesday Night around 5:30pm for happy hour & dinner. The hostess greeted us and let us pick our table. The restaurant has a great county theme and as a big country fan it was comforting to hear some of my favorite songs playing all night. We all ordered Brisket meals, 3 of us getting the brisket sandwich and 2 of us sharing a lb. of sliced brisket. The meat was delicious. They have 2 BBQ sauces on the table, one vinegar based and the other a sweet & spicy thicker sauce. I would have preferred more options for my brisket. For sides we ordered the mac & cheese, delicious with a hint of nutmeg and the corn pudding also very very good. I definitely want to come back to HOQ one a weekend night to try the dueling pianos!
2016-12-12,1,Had a large group and ordered a mixed platter of lots of different choices. They all sucked. Dry, tasteless and by far the worst BBQ I've had on the planet. Service paralleled the poor cooking and the beer choices for a BBQ place in 2016 were pathetic. Will never go there again.
2016-12-10,5,The manager Mike made sure my friend and I were well taken care of. We went for karaoke night last night and had a great time. Expect a very young college crowd who likes to sing and dance to greatest hits. Very good vibe, good service and tasty food. I have encountered better karaoke DJs for sure, but the venue is amazing. The decor, sound and view of Manhattan make this place a sure thing.
2016-12-08,1,Place is awful! Pulled pork sandwich was cold and no flavor what so ever. Very expensive with poor quality. If you eat there prepared to leave hungry still. Was 50 cent wings but had to order 10.... good luck if you go....
2016-12-05,2,Fun lively place but I'm an avid BBQ fan and seek out really great quality BBQ meat and this was pretty good but not on par with my local BBQ restaurants so it was a bit disappointing to make the drive up to Hoboken for average BBQ The dueling pianos show started 40 minutes late which was not appreciated
2016-12-03,5,I'm so glad we found this place on yelp! we are from California and lucille's bar b q is a really popular place, but depending on what you get, I would say this place is better. I got the HOQ burger, ground beef and smoked brisket patty, so flavorful. Order and chili and fries, the best chili fries I've tasted. But my highlight, finding a jalapeño margarita that was the best I've ever had, actually spicy, the kick I've been looking for. Love this place.
2016-11-30,5,If you're in the mood for good ol' American comfort foods, Southern charm and hospitality, and great country music this is the place for you! The food is delicious. The staff are awesome. They're very accommodating. Willy is a great bartender and Mike is a great manager. My friend and I came here for Star Wars trivia through Trivia, A. D. They never showed up for the trivia smh. Thank goodness this place was great and we enjoyed our night regardless.
2016-11-25,5,We've been coming for awhile and have always had good experiences. I've had better BBQ down south but this certainly comes very close and is extra nice that I don't have to leave Hoboken. I love the mac n cheese and corn bread pudding for the sides. The wings are extremely good too and we've never had issues with the staff. I highly recommend giving it a try.
2016-11-14,1,SIGNED UP FOR A SCAM WHILE WATCHING FOOTBALL ON SUNDAY!!!! DO NOT ENTER THEIR FALSE RAFFLES!!! THEY WILL JUST DO IT TO GET YOUR INFORMATION AND MONEY!! My friends and I signed up for a raffle to win "two free Giants football tickets". After we entered, we all received multiple texts that we were entered to win and that we would have to be present to win. The night of the drawing (Monday Night Football) we all got a text message at 5pm to make sure we were there for the raffle drawing at half time. We showed up at House of Que (before Monday Night Football started at 8:30pm) got seats at the bar and proceeded to order a few rounds of drinks. During half time nothing was drawn, we asked the bartender if the drawing was happening and he replied that he was unsure. After a few minutes he "checked with a manager" then proceeded to tell us that the drawing was off and he was still unsure exactly why. We were never given any information from a manager as to why the "raffle" was called off. Ultimately, we were brought in just to buy drinks and add service to their bar. It was a Monday night crowd where there were only a few people at the bar and we were their main customers. It was clear to us that they did this "raffle" just to bring in new customers, but they did not fulfill their promise. As we left, the bartender said we would receive an email, but we have yet to receive one. We were very unsatisfied with this service. We are residents of the Hoboken community, and are greatly disappointed. We will not be returning, or telling our friends and family to give their business to this establishment.Besides all of the above, the service and food was subpar.
2016-11-13,2,Unfortunately must say I was disappointed by coming here. We came for some BBQ with my gf and her family to celebrate her birthday. We were all disappointed with the food and especially the service.Let's start with the food since we were a group of 7 we decided to get a lb of the various meats and share it. We also got a large Mac and cheese. The brisket was not bad but it was better with there BBQ sauce. The chicken was ok as well. The other people had the pork and they were not that impressed. The mac and cheese was not really that good either. There buffalo wings were probably the best thing we had.Now with respect to the server (Erika) she starts off ok by coming by and taking our order, but then she disappears. I even had to go get side plates from a vacant table since we waited so long. Never once did she really come back to check on us and it was a pain just to even get the check to pay. Even the busboy had no idea where she is when I asked for her. I was once a server and this is not how you treat guests.Crappy service and ofcourse we get imposed 18% gratuity on the check; like really? If you are getting 18% then give me 18% service. I do not care about the imposed gratuity but the service should be better then what we got. Will definitely not bring my business back.
2016-11-11,5,great place with reasonably priced food and drinks. piano bar was great too! highly recommend this place for a Friday night outing.
2016-11-05,1,rude phone customer service. called to ask to make a reservation and was told they don't take reservations on saturdays and hung up on me. also .. yes you can make reservations if they offer it on opentable.
2016-11-03,4,Delicious.  This is the real deal when it comes to BBQ.  I've lived in the south, and this gets pretty darn close to real southern BBQ.  Served quickly, with a smile, in a great location.  You can't ask for more.
2016-11-02,3,The brisket was really good. We ordered the macaroni and cheese because so many reviews said not to miss it. I thought it lacked flavor, while it was very creamy it was tasteless and expensive. The "family size mac and cheese is $11 and unless there are only 1 or 2 people in your family this size container is not going to be enough. Really not impressed.
2016-10-31,4,Went here last Saturday evening to celebrate my sister's birthday. My sister called in beforehand to reserve two tables as we had a big crowd going there that night. The staff was very friendly with my sister & when she arrived they sat her right away instead of making her wait until the entire party was present. When I arrived with a few others, the staff at the front was very friendly & showed us where our table was. This establishment has a southern theme to it. There are booths & picnic tables near the stage where the dueling pianos are & there are also tv's mounted on the walls. On this particular night they had college football & the NLCS on. The waitress that we had was very kind & she was always checking in on us to see if we needed any more buckets of beer.The food at this place goes along with the southern theme as there are plenty of BBQ choices to choose from. I did not order anything on this night but the food that I saw going to other tables all looked delicious.The dueling pianos that were playing this night were great. Both performers did a great job playing requests & entertaining the crowd. They played a variety of different songs & everyone in the place were jamming out. Overall, I had a great time at this place. The only reason that it doesn't have a 5 star review is because it is a little bit on the pricey side. Even with that, I would definitely go back.
2016-10-24,5,My first time going there and I already started raving about it. The atmosphere is so great and the show they have every night is amazing and so much fun even sober. I have already recommended this place for more people.
2016-10-20,4,I love Texas BBQ, and I was skeptical when I heard there was a place in Hoboken that was doing it right. Well, they made me a believer. I went there with a friend and we got the Pitmaster's Pick, which was a whole bunch of brisket, ribs, sausage, chicken, and sides.There are a good number of beers on tap and in bottles, but the only Texas brew was Shiner Bock. It would be awesome to have some local beers from Austin added to the list.Overall. the food was great, friendly service, and a fun scene there.
2016-10-08,3,Based on my observation, at 12:25am. The bar tender seems annoyed and notPleased either because I don't order too much or not to mention my racial background. I'll give it a benefit of a doubt.... but either way... as most of us know... we all have to do our job regardless. I didn't disrespect myBar tender at somepoint. This is just a mere shortObservation. Nothing personal.
2016-10-08,3,Drinks are weak as hell. I got a mojito which tasted like sprite and only sprite. And it was $13. Lame.Bbq was mediocre. The brisket was dry.I did like the corn pudding. That was probably the best part of the meal.Food was acceptable but we won't be going back. If I want bbq I'd rather travel out to Newark for some Dinosaur BBQ.
2016-10-04,5,Great Food, low carbing it? Get a pound of brisket, it the best!Great atmosphere!
2016-10-03,3,Nice location in south Hoboken overlooking the river. They have big windows that open to the large patio and have barstools on either side so that you can look in or look up depending on your interest.The happy hour beers are decent, the wings were delicious but $12 for six smoked wings seemed fairly steep at four in the afternoon.It is a very, very large venue and it would be interesting to see how crowded it gets and how good the barbecue is during peak times.
2016-10-03,4,Fun! Fun and some very solid BBQ. We ordered the family style deal which is about $75 for a group of 4 and has brisket, ribs, chicken and sausages plus 4 small sides. All meats were terrific along w some great BBQ sauces. Sausages good, not great and as a group of 4, they should give more than one single rib each! Corn thingie was excellent as other have said but they need to change up the mac and cheese recipe because it was just ok. Service was superb with all smiles and super quick. We did have a complaint about the music which was they had the bass up WAY too high and volume up too loud so that was a bit of an annoyance. All in all, a good solid choice for BBQ in NJ
2016-10-02,5,Hands down the best BBQ ive had! The bisket sandwhich was amazing and all the differet sauces were delicious! The wings were crispy and well done just like we like them! If you love bbq you will love thks place! We got the slaw and brisket chill both were good not as great as others made them seem but still really good! My fav is definitely the brisket sandwhich and the wings.
2016-10-01,1,Quite possibly the best BBQ east of Kansas City and north of Texas, and quite possibly the worst service and ambiance south of Chuck E Cheese. My advice: order take out. If you decide to eat onsite, bring earplugs and count your change. The first two times I ate there, it was four or five stars across the board, The next three times, it was unequivocal strikeouts, service-wise. Next bbq batter up!
2016-09-29,4,Went here to watch the Clemson Football game and had a great time. Plenty of drinks and wings.
2016-09-19,4,My boyfriend and I went to House of Que for dinner. We came on a chiller night -  right away we were seated by the bar - but since the window (large garage door) was wide open we asked to be moved to the other side (where the pianist is) - it took a while to get seated. The waitress was attentive - we immensely enjoyed the pianists who played covers from throughout the years (they play every Friday and Saturday night starting at eight) - people seemed to really be enjoying themselves, joining in singing/ dancing on the stage. The crowd is definitely young business men/women in their mid 20s'. The food was great - order less to begin with because you will be surprised how much food you get. DEFINITELY ORDER THE CORN PUDDING - it's AMAZING!
2016-09-15,4,The four stars here are for the ribs (and BBQ sauce) alone, and not the sides. The ribs are super tender and full of flavor with the dry rub. These ribs don't need BBQ sauce but that's not to say the sauce on the table isn't delicious, because it is. The sides here were unimpressive. The macaroni and cheese was a bit on the mushy side, and the brisket chili was a bit on the dry side. The peach cobbler was ok, but same as the rest of the sides, isn't why you come here. The ribs here are the best I've had in Hoboken, so I'll be back for them again.
2016-09-11,1,The atmosphere is good but the food is nothing great. The menu is very confusing, the food (other than the specific sandwiches) come out family style so if you're in a large group it's impossible to split up the food evenly. Also keep in mind that if you get the brisket half of the pieces have fat on them, so while they charge by the pound you're paying mostly for fatty meats which is absolutely wrong. If it wasn't for the dueling piano entertainment on Saturday night I would be asking for my money back. Overall the BBQ tasted fake to me and wouldn't go out of my way to go back.
2016-09-11,1,Ordered at approximately 6:30 on a Saturday night so I obviously expected a little bit of a wait. At 7:42, I received a call saying that they are backed up with drivers and it was going to take him a while to deliver it. Normally, I would have chosen somewhere else, but at this point I was already waiting for an hour and fifteen minutes.  Still not entirely sure why the fact that they were short on drivers and delivery would be delayed was not communicated from the beginning. Given that he said he only has to go to Jersey City just a few miles away I figured "how long could it take". At 8:18, I called the restaurant and was put on hold. While on hold, I was hung up on and never called back. Finally several minutes later I received my food. The food was obviously not very hot given how long it has been sitting prior to the delivery and my pulled pork sandwich was as dry as could be with no sauce on the side. I think I would choose another restaurant next time.
2016-09-08,2,The food was great and waitress was good too, but we went on Thursday night for NFL kickoff and went with the yeungling beer tower $25 special we got the beer and immediately after taking a sip found it was either watered down or skunked, but it didn't taste like yeungling because we just had it at the bar before. We mentioned it to the waitress and got nothing but an oh are you closing out very disappointing. No matter what special you have, no matter what emails you send for free stuff can't fix bad service and lack of sympathy. We left behind almost all of the beer and still got charged for it.
2016-09-05,3,Very nice service, but any place that says (on a chalkboard when you walk in) that you only have 90 minutes to eat your dinner isn't really ok by me. This is Hoboken for crying out loud, not...well, nowhere should give you a limit on eating. Also, it's the usual Ho-broken atmosphere: humongous tvs and tries too hard. To be fair, maybe not my personal way to go, but seriously 90 minutes?
2016-09-04,4,Ok....this was definitely an experience. Between the dueling live pianos and the humongous tv's showing sports, the vibe can be a bit jarring upon entering this restaurant. But things seem to level out once you adjust to your surroundings (yeah it's a little loud on a Saturday night - but it's fun!). I have to disagree with some of the other reviewers on here. I thought the meat was flavorful and far from dry. The brisket and the ribs both had a good pull to them, not the melt in your mouth overcooked mush that you get at some BBQ places. My only advice to anyone trying this place for the first time is don't expect your typical seasoning on the BBQ ribs. There was definitely something different going on there, I don't know it that's how they do things in Austin or if that's just the chefs own recipe; but it's different. As everyone else has mentioned the corn pudding is amazing. Definitely order a large portion of you have more than 3 people in your party. That was by far our favorite side dish. The Mac and Cheese comes in second. A nice blend of cheeses seasoned with a hint of nutmeg - don't turn up your nose, try it! Their BBQ sauces are a nice balance of tangy and sweet; and served on the side like it should be when it comes to real Texas BBQ.  The sausage is pretty good too and all of their meat had a rich smoked flavor that I was still thinking about the next day.Service here is excellent. The women who work here are sincere and you never have to wonder where your waitress wandered off to. I didn't try any of their signature cocktails but they all looked good and averaged about $12 each. Overall a great dining experience right on the bank of the Hudson River overlooking the NY skyline. You can't beat that.
2016-09-02,4,Great place in a great location. Arrived in a Friday night to live music and a vibrant crowd. Service was great and fast and drinks tasted great. Ordered the Spicy Chipotle BBQ wings which were good and the smoked brisket. Both dishes were good and their BBQ sauce also tasted great, they offers 2 different BBQ choices. The atmosphere definitely feels southern and it's a great place to visit. They also offer many games for people at the bar like a human size connect four. Lot of tv's for sporting events as well.
2016-09-02,2,Gave me like two spoonful of beans for a side in my $23 order. Pretty disappointing overall considering the price.
2016-09-02,3,House of que is in a great location, and has a cool atmosphere.Im not crazy about their meats here. Everything seemed a little dry. I got the 3 meat lunch special which included sausage,  Brisket and a rib.The brisket was disappointing. So dry. Usually when you stab into a piece of brisket it falls off your fork. This one stayed intact in one piece. The sausage tasted really good but was also very dry. The rib was surprisingly the best out of the bunch.For sides I got the Mac and cheese and the corner/black bean salad. Both were fantastic.They don't have cornbread here. What?!I'd come back to have a beer at the bar and watch football, but not to eat!
2016-08-31,4,I am not a barbeque fan but that being said I really enjoy this place.  I have been here with barbeque lovers from places that know how to do barbeque (Texas) and everyone has seemed to have been very pleased.   Fun atmosphere, great for everyone including families and big groups.   Service has always been great, very attentive and friendly.  Love to sit outside and still be able to watch a game.   Also really enjoyed the dueling pianos on Saturday.   Overall a great addition to Hoboken.
2016-08-28,1,Horrible nachos.  Terrible service. Are they kidding?
2016-08-22,3,Came here for drinks and nachos with friends. I have had better BBQ elsewhere but this is easily the best place in Hoboken for it. The nachos are awesome, the chili brisket is the best around, the pulled pork is incredible, and they have live music on certain nights. Definitely check this place out for good BBQ in Hoboken.
2016-08-19,4,I only had their nachos (with smoked chicken) and they were so good that I had to write a review just for them. The chips must have been homemade, if not they were of superior quality anyway. All of the toppings were delicious and really fresh. Had I not been on a date I would have ordered wings... I'll have to come back.
2016-08-12,1,First went to this place back in April. I thought the BBQ was so so. The service was pretty good though. My son likes BBQ and he was over for the weekend so we decided to go in tonight and try it again. It was 630pm and the place was half empty. They asked me if I had a reservation. Um what? They said that the inside seating was reserved for "dueling pianos" at 8pm, and that we could sit at the bar with my 3rd grader, or go sit outside in the 100 degree humidity. No thanks. You couldn't figure out a way to take my business and serve 3 of us in one and a half hours?Nice job House of Que. When you can't get anyone to eat there and you start offering Groupons I'll pass.
2016-08-11,4,Went to House of Que on a Wednesday night with a couple of friends for trivia (a weekly thing, and with Game of Thrones this week...who could resist?). The space,located in a former garage, does its best to emulate a rowdy Western BBQ joint, though with a distinct 'Downtown Hoboken' shine. What you can expect is some tasty, if not spectacular BBQ and brews at higher-than-average prices. A chopped brisket sandwich was on the small side, topped with a few slices of raw onion and some sauce, and rang in at $10.50 (the smallest sides were about $4.50 extra). The brisket had the kind of deep smokiness you'd expect from Texas-style 'cue, but the seasoning was a bit tame. Add some of the house sauces (Texas 2 Step and 519) to make the flavours pop.
2016-08-10,4,great service, food was delicious, I love the ribs and brisket. Their Special sauces were really good as well. My favorite sides are the corn pudding and potato salad!
2016-08-07,5,I went here for a girls night on a Friday. We have such a good time. Music was good and the live pianist were great. We ordered the wings in regular and spicy which were both delicious. We also ordered the brisket nachos which were just amazing and of course I order a side of pickles because that's my favorite . Everything was good and prices were good. I will be back
2016-08-07,5,I went there with friends to hear the dueling pianos but was blown away by the food, especially the chicken. Just delicious. The service was great and the pianists were talented and funny without being overly vulgar (like some I have seen elsewhere). Will definitely go back.
2016-08-02,5,So this is the "Real Deal". As a Texas Boy, living here in Hoboken, I dearly miss real Texas BBQ. The owner....very sharp dude... Built out a great space. Great outdoor seating (magical views of the Hudson and NYC's skyline), a great live music layout, a great interior layout, well designed bar.   First time I met one of the owners (pre-opening), I was skeptical that someone would, or could, do the real (Texas style) 'Que here in Hoboken....but he had all the right answers. I asked how many hours they smoked their brisket... He answered " 16 to 20 hours depending on the size of the brisket".      Right answer!  He went on to say that they had hired Michael Rodriguez, the Pitmaster at Austin's renowned "Salt Lick" BBQ palace. Mike is a super chef who not only was great at Salt Lick and now at House of 'Que, but competes in the big BBQ cook offs around the country.   So it's the "Real Deal".   Great Bar. Try the Spicy Laredo 'Rita.... A knockout Texas margarita with mulled jalapeño. Lots of interesting Southwestern craft cocktails and cool beers.     Like most Texas BBQ places, the emphasis is on excellent brisket, pork ribs, and house made sausage . But that said, the 1/2 chicken and the wings are terrific. Sides include excellent beans, potato salad, Cole slaw, and even real no kidding collard greens.   And finish off with some authentic Texas pecan pie....Mike's grandmother's recipe. Yum!   Lot's to try here.....   House of 'Que has terrific CW entertainment at night, and also a high tech TVs, especially behind the bar.... So great for sports, as well as great 'Que.    So saddle up Cowgirls and Cowboys, and head for House of 'Que!   And oh yes, open for lunch every day
2016-07-29,3,Went to House of Que as a party of 3 for dinner.  We had reservations and were quickly seated - it wasn't very crowded.  We opted to sit outside, so I can't comment much on the atmosphere - outside is nice though, right on the river with plenty of people watching.To start we had the spicy margarita, which had some kick to it and was pretty good.For dinner, we ordered 2 lbs of ribs for 3 people along with the corn pudding, potato salad, and slaw.  We also had the Chipotle wings.The food came out about 1 minute after we ordered it - way too quick. It felt like we were being rushed when we just wanted to enjoy a nice, leisurely evening.- The ribs came dry, and unfortunately, our table had no bbq sauce.  I had 2 dry and then was finally brought bbq sauce.  I thought the ribs were decent - not the best I've ever had, but not bad either - they were nicely cooked and nicely flavored.- The corn pudding was very good, my favorite dish.- I thought the potato salad lacked flavor, although my husband seemed to enjoy it.- The slaw was pretty good as well.- The wings I didn't like at all, they were way too sweet.  The had some heat, but it was just buried in the cloying sweetness of the sauce.Overall, this wasn't the best bbq I've had, but it was pretty good - and given that there's nothing else like it in town, I'd probably go back.  It's worth a visit.
2016-07-23,5,I am not a BBQ connosieur but based on what I've had so far, this place has good stuff. Ordered a beef brisket sandwich with Texas slaw, corn pudding side. Everything tastes great and went well together. Their sauces are great too. And to top that up, the decor, service and price were all great! Would go again for sure!!
2016-07-18,4,Again, I'm not the biggest fan of BBQ cuisine but something always gets me back to it. I went with a friend here after a long day. We walked right in and were greeted cordially. As soon as we sat down, we had impeccable service. Our waitress's name was Lisa (You must ask for her! She will take care of you!) My buddy and I ordered ribs, brisket and 1/2 of chicken. I only ate the chicken. Our sides were the chilie, black beans and corn salad, macaroni salad, Mac and cheese and baked beans. All in all it was an exceptional meal. It is pretty pricey with the sides but worth it. I will come back to this establishment when I'm back in Hoboken and want delicious BBQ chicken. Maybe I'll just get 1 lb of chicken next time! Try this place out, ask for Lisa and just enjoy the Texan atmosphere.
2016-07-17,2,Lunch with my sister and she suggested house of que.  bbq why not? The place is very casual and the location is great.  If only the review would end there.  A surprisingly small menu with a few unusual items.  She decided on a chopped brisket sandwich and I ordered the hoq burger.  I ordered it without pickles, onions and the spicy cheese sauce.  It was just the two of us and ten minutes later my burger comes out and her sandwich doesn't.  I look down and it has pickles and not 1 or 2 pickles but like 10 of them.  So I get the waitress and tell her she takes the plate back to the kitchen.  She comes out two minutes later with my sisters sandwich and my "new" burger.  I check the burger and you already know it was the same burger with the pickles removed.  I tried to eat it but I could still taste pickles.  I called her over again just to let her know I was aware of what they did.  She apologized but she brought it out so she knew they didn't make a new one she offered to make a new one but I was over the whole thing at that point.  I ate the fries and left the burger, for 14.99 I should be able to get the burger I want.  They did take 50% off the price of the burger but that's not what I wanted just make it the way I ask.  So many restaurants in Hoboken skip this one!
2016-07-16,3,Good bbq ribs had great flavor but a little dry, brisket was mediocre and cold, chicken was the best. Side of mac and bbq beans were nothing special. For the price ordered by the pound our bill came to 85 bucks and the plate was pretty skimpy. Probably will not return just because the cost for a small amount of food.
2016-07-15,1,It's Friday night, the door says they close at 3am. They called last call at 12:40am. They started kicking people out at 1:15am although there was a decent amount of people at the bar. The security guard makes a lovely statement as we leave "summer sucks so we are closing early" great service. The worst experience ever. We had a big party of at least 30 people coming. They could have made some money but I guess not.
2016-07-15,5,We went here for the first time tonight after passing by a few times and it was absolutely amazing. The ambiance, the staff, the food, everything.  Everyone was so nice and friendly and welcoming. Our waiter, Ross, who was nothing shy of excellent did a terrific job of explaining the menu and gave really amazing recommendations. We had the pork ribs, pork shoulder, smoked chicken, corn pudding and bbq baked beans. And to top it off, we had a giant chocolate cookie a la mode. The BBQ was so delicious and tasty. We will definitely be going back here regularly.  We sat outside and the view was simply amazing. It's also priced very fairly for Hoboken and for the quality of food and service. A must try if you're craving pork shoulder and ribs!  The corn pudding was also insane. I can go on and on.
2016-07-13,5,This is our favorite spot in Hoboken for drinks and/or a quick snack.The thing we love the most is the service.
2016-07-11,5,Their brisket is delicious and tender! Super juicy! My boyfriend and I split the meat platter lunch special which came with a couple sausage slices, a couple ribs, and a few slices of brisket. We loved the brisket so we ordered another half pound and indulged ourselves. Their drinks are great too! The spicy margarita was SPICY!!!! Plenty of drink options. The place itself is great for large groups. Can't wait to come back for me!
2016-07-11,2,Two stars for location and fast service. Food below any quality .. Especially the brisket - fatty dry and chewy. I guess that's just their style. I also has the lunch "special" .. Three meats and two sides for 13$. Well I got one rib -- diced sausage -- and again the below avg dried out brisket.. Best part was the sides I guess? But the mac which I always love most places was very blah. The slaw .. Again dry I personally like slaw a lil wetter so I'm not feeling like I'm eat actual shredded cabbage. Anyway great view .. Below average food .. Which made me sad I really wanted to like it because I love bbq!!! Oh well ... Lots of places to eat in Hoboken ..
2016-07-09,4,good bbq at a good spot w great views of the waterfront. if you want to enjoy ambience and good meat on a saturday (wearing flip flops and shorts), this could be an option. i went w friends for lunch on a sat. got greeted by a smiling staff. sat outside where we could see the water. hoboken has a lot of dog walkers. i'm no bbq expert but i know good food and business, and food was good, and business was good. the wait staff knew the menu and made spot on recommendations. business acumen pretty on point bc they take off your parking cost if you park at the adjacent garage. it's a win win for both the pitmasters and customers. don't come thinking you're going to feast on grade a bbq. come with good vibes and you'll be welcomed at the house of que
2016-07-03,2,Disappointed...overall 1-2 stars...Pork spare ribs: little dry 2 stars Pork shoulder: pretty good 4 starsBrisket: very dry 1 stars 1/2 BBQ chicken: dry 1 starsSides: pretty good 4 starsBeer selection: 4 starsSpicy wings: 3 stars
2016-06-25,5,I really don't understand why this establishment has so many reviews claiming the service and food were poor. The food was fantastic, the staff were satisfactory, and the live entertainment was superb. Highly recommended. Go with the pork shoulder and that corn pudding is uffffffa, amazing!
2016-06-25,2,We came in on a Saturday night for dueling pianos (5 stars for those guys!) but I was otherwise underwhelmed. Boyfriend had made a reservation for my birthday. We were seated right in front of the piano guys at one of their picnic table style tables. Our server seemed overwhelmed by the various groups. I watched a couple tables around us waiting for missing food. It took a very long time to get our drinks. The waiter was apologetic, but said "the server bar always gets backed up". Get another bartender back there, then! Boyfriend got a gin cocktail off the list, and it was pretty good.I got a frozen margarita for $10 and it tasted like limeade. I asked if I could get the $2 extra shot to make it better... Our waiter disappeared. He came back and said no, I'd have to pay $10 for a regular shot. I complained that this drink was really disappointing. He went off to ask his manager and came back to offer to make me a new margarita drink with the shot in it, which was fine with me, but it took another 20 minutes to get it! But that was better, although not $12 delicious. It was equally difficult to pay our check. The food was mostly fine. We got ribs (1/2lb, or 3 ribs) and 1/2lb pulled park, both of which just served as a vehicle for barbecue sauce. The medium potato salad was terrible, under seasoned and mealy. The deviled eggs were probably the best, but still... Not really impressive or worth the price. I hope the dueling piano guys find a better place to play.
2016-06-23,4,I know good barbecue and I have a trophy to prove it... (People's Choice Award at a well-established competition in Northeast credentials provided upon request)... this is the real deal here no frills and not presumptuous particularly since it's right down the street from some fancy joints... they hand you a roll of paper towels when u eat at the bar and you're probably...strike that you are definitely gonna need them... very authentic not mucked up with a bunch of sauce like some places that try to mask bad BBQ...they have good barbecue sauce if you'd like it but right on the side first or dip your fries or whatever... and definitely get the burnt ends chili and corn pudding...which are the best I've ever had including my own... if you're looking for white tablecloth walk down the street but if you're ready to get a feed on hit this here Que...
2016-06-18,4,First time visiting house of que. Went on a Sunday afternoon and they had the windows open cause it was a lovely day outside. Big wooden picnic tables and rolls of paper towels, I knew we were in for a treat. We started with the chipotle wings and they were much spicier than the server described and my gf does not like spice so we were slightly disappointed in those. The chicken was perfectly cooked but the sauce was spicy even for my liking and I love spice. The ribs had a perfect dry rub and were very tender and delicious. Finished off with a peach cobbler which was out of this world good.
2016-06-18,1,Made a reservation for dinner on a Saturday night for 7 people to enjoy the dueling pianos. We got seated right away and the two pianists were great. However, we had the worst service we've ever had anywhere, and the food was not good. It took 45 minutes for us to get our first round of drinks, which were brought piecemeal and included two drinks that were wrong. Same with the food. We had four different servers, none of which checked on us and all of which blamed someone else for multiple mistakes. And when we got the food, the pulled pork was fatty and lacking in flavor, same for the brisket and burger. Fries were cold. And other basics were bizarre - one person asked for jalapeños on his burger...and got a whole, uncooked jalapeño on the side with no knife. What? We won't be going back and strongly suggest you don't waste your time or money either.  Five stars for the pianists, and zero for everything else.
2016-06-17,2,Went on a Friday around 2pm after work. Probably about 15 people in the whole place. Pretty empty . Service is terrible took 20 mins to get a beer that we put in with our waiter and order. We almost just left and went somewhere else. Servers and bar staff are lazy and just stand around and do nothing. Food was good but if service is this bad when the place is empty I'm afraid to know what a busy time is like.
2016-06-17,5,House of Que is the place to be and eat in Hoboken! If you are looking for good eats and a good time then you would love House of Que! I'm from the deep south, so I have pretty high standards when it comes to authentic bbq and hospitality! I am so impressed with the quality of the food. Be sure to come with an appetite because they will not let you down with the servings! My favorites are the pulled pork, brisket, collard greens, and mac & cheese! Not only is the food to die for, but the service is impeccable! Everyone (including management) is so personable, friendly, and attentive. Be sure to ask for Winston because he takes good care of his customers! One more thing, be sure to stop by on the nights that Dueling Pianos are playing. They will keep you singing and laughing all night! I love this place!
2016-06-17,4,Best wings I've ever had! If you love wings you MUST try the chipotle BBQ! On Tuesday they are half price and they also have Bingo going on! The reason for the 4 star and not a 5 is due to the slow service.
2016-06-16,2,Service was ok..Place is really nice...food wasnt that great. Chicken was bland, No flavorWish the food was better.
2016-06-14,2,I'm no BBQ expert but, I wasn't impressed at all by the quality of this place. Yes, the vibes are cool and I would probably consider coming back to have a couple beers with friends buuuut that's about it. Got 2 Texas Palmers to start.... zero alcohol. I didn't even end up drinking mine and my boyfriend got a vodka soda after finishing it in one gulp. Waste of $22.We initially ordered a 1/4 lb of each the brisket (2 slabs) and ribs (about 6) plus sides of slaw and bbq beans for my other half. I was torn about the mac & cheese and when I asked my waitress which she thought about it she was like ehhhhhh its good. Against my better judgement, I ordered them anyway because I felt like it should be good at a bbq spot. Food came out pretty quickly and soon thereafter we were overwhelmed with disappointment. As we took the first couple bites of everything, we were nooooot happy at all. The only item we actually enjoyed were the ribs. With that being said, we were dipping them in their house BBQ sauces, which were much more flavorful than anything else on our tray. The mac and cheese was so gross and mushy, I gave it back and asked for the slaw instead-much better option. Should have stuck with my gut on that one. The brisket was almost 80% fat and that's where all the flavor was. Didn't feel like clogging an artery that night so we barely touched that. Ended up having to order another 1/4 lb of ribs since it was the only thing we liked and didn't want to leave hungry. I think there's a lot this place has to work on because I'm not sure Austin or other Texas "pitmasters" would want to be associated with House of Que.
2016-06-13,3,I came here on a Sunday after the Hoboken Arts Festival and it was just that -- alright. For one, the wait was very quick ( actually no wait at all) for our dine in. ( There was a bit of a wait for the outdoor seating). Upon being seated we asked if we would be able to try a sample and the staff was really nice about that. Despite that service is SLOW! My uncle ordered a sandwich and his fries weren't bought out until he was completely done! ( However the fries were apart of the meal). I had a rather light meal and went with the sides. I got the deviled eggs, mac & cheese and potato salad. Let me tell you the deviled eggs were AMAZING but then again how could one go wrong with that anyways? The mac& cheese was horrible and I was actually sad because I really wanted to like it but I couldn't. The potato salad was OK. Nothing I would come back for but it also wasn't horrible. Overall, this isn't a bad place but again it's just okay for a quick bite to eat. I probably wouldn't come back. I felt like trying this place out one time was good enough. I think they definatly need to work on their service and being a bit more attentive to their paying customers.
2016-06-11,1,Came here at 5 was told we'd get a table after the Belmont race. After the Belmont no table. Way to cater to your resident crowd.
2016-06-11,2,Went for a birthday dinner with family. Got one of the bundle specials which apparently doesn't allow any substitutions, I get it but still kind of annoying.Food was... fine. Not terrible but definitely not great and as someone who visits Texas frequently not, "authentic." Brisket was probably the best but even still was kind of meh. Service was great at least. Drinks were very good and I bet it's fun at night with dueling pianos. Definitely would not recommend for food.
2016-06-11,1,Distasterous management.Requested outdoor table as indoors was too loud. Told 1 hour wait so we agreed. 1 hour 20 mins passed - asked for an update - was told only 2 ahead of us. Ok - busy night but almost there - WRONG!Fifteen mins later got called and informed that a table was ready - INDOORS (still too loud due to over amplified amateur pianists)Asked how long for outdoor table and was told another 1/2 hour. That would be over 2 hours after arriving. Now too hungry to wait any longer we left and had a great mean elsewhere (good food great service and atmosphere but wont say where)Adios Que - we were obviously bypassed in your queuing system and ultimately treated like the meat you cook. Your management truly sucks!
2016-06-08,5,So I'm kinda in love with this place. I visit my friend in Austin multiple times a year and we will inevitably do the famous BBQ places (Franklin's, County Line etc). This place is legitimately the closest I've come to matching my favorite Austin BBQ places outside of Texas.  The Bingo night on Tuesdays is always a blast.  Food wise, you must do the ribs and the brisket chili (no beans!!!) and don't forget the Pecan pie ala mode for desert. My new favorite date night out place.
2016-06-07,4,Really enjoyed the brisket sandwich and collard greens both times I came here. Some drinks are tasty, especially the Bloody Mary. Unfortunately the spiked tea's are lacking in kick. Came once for lunch and once for dinner on a PACKED Saturday night for Dueling Pianos. Obviously they're doing something right to have a consistent crowd. Great atmosphere, but like everything else in town--pricey. A once-in-a-blue-moon type of place.
2016-06-07,2,My review can be summed up with: no corn bread.Granted it's not the only awful thing about the place, the no corn bread really did it for me. Came here on a double date after a day on the pier and as BBQ fanatics, we were all excited to try House of Que out given it's prime location on the waterfront. It was insanely expensive and all of the food was underwhelming. I'd go as far to say as the sausage and the mac and cheese was gross. The only thing I finished was my pickle.Service was also lacking. Our waitress came by once to deliver extra wet naps but drink orders were only taken once at the beginning. She forgot to bring a portion of our order until she was reminded.I'm not mad - I'm just disappointed.
2016-06-05,3,For an update..,I had made my reservation through Open Table.  The next day I got a message from Open Table admonishing me about not showing up for my reservation and if it happened too many more times...well just don't make us have to come get you Lady!  I responded to Open Table with a copy of my check, server name, a bunch of stuff indicating I did keep the reservation and oh by the way, I would not be going back.  Aside from the bad experience, they didn't even acknowledge my reservation in the system? Egad!
2016-06-04,2,Never again will I go here.   Terrible service, waited way too long to get a waiter and way too many screw ups on the meal.  My wife and I had to send out salads back.....TWICE.   The table next to us got up and left before they could order because it took too long.  Decent food but terrible service.
2016-05-31,4,I like this place. Been a couple times, and both times, the food was pretty solid. Liked the ribs and pulled pork the best. Brisket chili was also good. I'd return, for sure.
2016-05-31,4,Only there for drinks looking out over the water.  It was good, lights were kind of bright but that's for the people eating.  Crowd was big, as were the portions being served.  Seemed a little over the top, the slices of meat were enough to feed a whole family, but I guess people like that. The view was good, and the live guitar player was talented.  They have dueling pianos some nights, would like to see that.
2016-05-30,2,Ive visited House of 'Que twice.  The first time with my little family of four, and the second time with my extended family of twelve.  I really wanted to love it both times, but it's just "meh".  I think part of the problem was that we had the same waitress twice, and she's pretty awful.  Both times we waited a really long time for her to come to the table, for drinks and for our food.  On our first visit, the food was pretty decent.  We liked the variety.  On this second visit, much of our group decided to order a special that was listed on the board outdoors, but were told that it was not available after 3:00.  Really the board should NOT have been up if that was the case.  Three of us ended up getting burgers.  No one ever asked what temp we wanted the meat done, and when a member of our party asked for baked beans instead of fries the waitress said "no substitutions". There was pretty much no rhyme or reason for how these burgers came out two had bacon and one was covered in weird runny cheese sauce, no one requested any of this...and my mom's food came out a full 20 minutes after the rest of ours did.  We sat with empty drinks for more than half of our  two hour experience. When my mom told the waitress we needed refills, she was fed up and a bit nasty.  The waitress got even nastier and never once apologized for the obviously horrendous service nor sent a manager over to apologize.  I really wanted to like this place.  The decor is cute and the location is even better!  Sadly the service is pretty terrible and the food is hit or miss.  Some recommendations: 1)Throw some cornbread on the table when people sit down (even Boston market has this "luxury")! Then people won't notice it takes 90 years for the waitress to come back.2) Hire a food runner.  Both times I've noticed the manager running food.  He'd have more time to help customers and monitor tables if he wasn't picking up the slack for the craptastic waitress.3) If your special board is out, offer whatever is on it.  If not, put it away.4)  With that, it makes no sense that the pick three items special isn't a normal menu item.  There should also just be a single side choice to go with all sandwiches. It shouldn't be a big deal if someone wants to trade out french fries, just up charge a replacement.  I don't know, maybe Gordon Ramsay should just take this place over.
2016-05-30,3,Was excited to see a BBQ place -- and with a view.  Today was Memorial Day and so I hope the service was unusually awful.  People were waiting for waiters for more then 15 -20 minutes and the bartender who took my order for ribs was a bit overwhelmed and ordered me pulled pork by accident.  Cause it came so late -- almost a 1/2 hour later - I just kept the pulled pork.  It was bit dry but the sauce choices were nice and helped.  The potato salad was tasty.  The tea vodka drink was awful - no vodka and bland - but he Bloody Mary was decent.  The Bartender was nice and comped me for the drink because of the mix up in the food.  All in all -- I think it has real potential and so I will try it again and I hope it will all be a bit better.
2016-05-30,1,This will relate strictly to the (horrible) service, since they didn't give me the opportunity to even rate the food. Arrived at 2:15 and ended up walking out at 3:15 since my table was yet to even receive water, let alone the drinks that we ordered. For some context, this is the first time I've ever walked out of a restaurant. I'm generally empathetic to servers and front of house staff (used to serve in college), but when we asked where our waters were about 50 minutes in, we were told "the manager is working on it", without any apology. We gave it another 10 minutes, but nope. The table next to us also walked out - they had two toddlers and an elderly couple and also didn't receive any water or drinks. I'm open to coming back because I'm a big BBQ fan but I'm less than impressed with the service and general lack of organization.
2016-05-28,1,bad experience, ordered a chicken wings without pepper (smoked Wings NAKED) served me a very spicy, complained asked to exchange, the waitress made the charge on my check. I not come back ever again. after she complained that came with "SORRY" missed. always check your pay!!!!
2016-05-24,5,i eat there a lot, big fan of brisk, pork ribs. I do not like chicken. Else is good. The cool sides is very good, better than hot sides.
2016-05-23,2,I love the atmosphere and space they've created but the food was OK at best. The brisket was a bit flavorless. Really good wings. Side items were good like mac and cheese and collard greens. Biggest problem I had with House of Que was the service. When I go bbq places I expect hospitality and I didn't really get it here. And I think this is a management issue because no one seemed to be trained very well. It could have been an applebees for that matter.
2016-05-22,1,Tried to come for my brother's birthday. We had a reservation for 8 outside at 2pm- we show up right at 2pm and there were zero available tables. Not only was the hostess unapologetic, but there were zero offers for proper resolution and the hostess gave other tables away as they became available instead of asking if we were interested. I was excited for BBQ but will not be back to see how it is here. Poor poor management and hospitality. What a shame.
2016-05-22,3,Dueling pianos is a lot of fun and great entertainment, especially in Hoboken which is really lacking in live music. Our server was awesome and food was delicious! I only gave 3 stars because of the drinks, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. We ordered the spicy margaritas and you couldn't even taste the tequila, so for round 2 we ordered doubles. Still nothing and we were going through these drinks fast (bc it just tasted like spicy soda). Round 3 we got vodka sodas and again still not even a buzz? Found out later the bartenders use automatic pourers on the bottles. Stick with beer or shots at this place or you're wasting your money on expensive cocktails.
2016-05-22,3,Food is decent here. Honestly I like the portions it comes in, but they make it without any sauce and it causes the meat to become really dry. The two sauces are at the table. I lived in Texas and there is no greater BBQ than there. This place falls short on the menu. The mac n cheese is pretty good. The peach cobbler with icecream is fabulous. The atmosphere is really cute and fun. They have live music once in a while. Cinco de mayo was really loud and we had a 2 year old. Not they're fault and will not hold them against that, but if that's your thing, I can see it being a lot of fun. Just be prepared the BBQ won't be up to par.
2016-05-22,3,My first visit was FUN.  The atmosphere was great and the owner Creedo was amazing.  He checked on us three times.  The brisket was good and the sauce was good.  The greens, mac & cheese was tolerable.  I'm very picky about the two items.  I will be back!  FYI... If you park in the garage the restaurant will discount your bill.
2016-05-21,5,Food and service was excellent. It's a good value for the quality. Brisket chili was amazing and the brisket was perfect.
2016-05-21,5,I rarely write reviews, but when I do, it's because the owner comes to chit chat, the staff is awesome, and the food/drinks are amazing.
2016-05-21,4,The place was pretty decent, I went in with some friends on a Friday and even though we made reservations it took them a couple of minutes to get us a table (could've done a better job) and the place was very busy, they had some kind of piano duet that was pretty cool and made the environment super casual, the server (Winston) was super nice and helpful though he was super busy, but he was very apologetic about it and professional. Now let's talk Food and Drinks, shall we? Ok.. I had a brisket sandwich that was so good it would make any other brisket taste like a car crash in your mouth,  the ribs were pretty good too with a spicy flavor at the end kinda smoky-ish but it was delicious. for the sides we had the salad, potato salad and mac and cheese (not impressed). For drinks I was feeling like having cocktails so I went for the spicy margarita and it was really good, probably in my top 5 I've ever had. Definitely recommend the place, overall the food was great. I would recommend to go on a more quiet day to really enjoy it.
2016-05-19,5,I've heard great things over the last few months about this place but had not had a chance to stop in and try it myself. I finally stopped in for an early dinner and had a truly terrific experience.  Before I get to the food, I was really impressed with the vibe of the place.  Great location, great staff (so friendly well trained), great city skyline views, loved the communal tables, tons of TVs, validated parking, fair prices, loved it all....totally authentic.I was with a bunch of big eater male friends, so we ordered virtually everything on the menu.  There were no weak points but I'll tell you my personal favorites:* The wings were truly amazing.  And I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur in this area!* The mac and cheese - fantastic.* The Ribs are meaty, and fall of the bone tender.* Deviled eggs - not something I would ordinarily order but one of my buddies insisted.  They were excellent.* Brisket / Chili - one word.....PERFECT.* Corn pudding - if you decide to give this place a try and don't get this, HUGE mistake.  It's the BEST.Not sure if the owner is there all the time but he was when we were there.  He checked in frequently to make sure we were being taken care of and seemed like a genuinely good dude. He really seems to care and is dedicated to making this place a long term success.Bottom line:  Hoboken needed a place like this and I'm thrilled we have it now.  Welcome to the neighborhood!
2016-05-18,5,Favorite BBQ joint in jersey, they accommodated my group of 8.  Good drinks and great food, live music put it over the top.  The atmosphere is very rustic and manager and owner came up to our table multiple times to check on us.  It's great for big groups, we stayed all night.  If you want to have a good social experience plus great BBQ check out this spot.
2016-05-18,5,Arrived on a Sunny Saturday afternoon, quick seating and sat outdoors. This is a family style spot, we ordered a pound of brisket (delicious!), half a chicken (it was a bit dry but okay), mac n cheese (could have been more cheesy) and the corn pudding which was everything! The corn pudding tasted like a dessert so I wanted more! Quick service, we pretty much sat and ate all in 30 minutes. Great food, service and drinks, I'll definitely be back.
2016-05-17,5,Live music at 8:30 on a Friday night pair nicely with the amazing BBQ! Loved the vibe, the staff were super attentive, and even when the bar got backed up and our beers were delayed they made it up to us! Our waiter brought us a round of shots for our table to apologize for the wait, that's above and beyond good customer service! Definitely recommending to all my friends for delicious food, great service and even a spectacular view of NYC!!
2016-05-14,1,I hope they get their act together cause it could be an awesome place. Went there tonight (Saturday) for the dueling piano and it was packed and a great crowd. Put in our name with the hostess, she said it was a 20min wait and would text us when table was ready. Never got back to us so 45 minutes later we sat at the bar. Well that was a mistake because to get someone to wait on us to longer than running a marathon. We asked 3 waitresses and they all said they would send someone over and they never did. Finally the bartender took our drinks and a waitress came over and said "oh great you guys are good." We told her we wanted to order, and our food came fast. The second round of drinks was even more painful, we watched our drinks sit at the bar window for awhile and when she picked them up the beers were warm and flat and there was no vodka in the iced tea. After we were done we could have walked out because it took her forever to bring our check. I hope they were just having an off night but if they don't get their shit together it's not going to be there for long.
2016-05-11,2,I am a lover of all things BBQ and I was excited to try House of Que. I read that the pit master was from Austin, Texas so it had to be good! I was a little disappointed when I tried the brisket, sausage, BBQ beans and corn pudding. The brisket was moist but it lacked the smokiness of a brisket that's cooked for an extended period of time, the sausage wasn't that great either it lacked the flavor that we were used to during our many trips to the state of Texas and the baked beans also didn't have very much flavor either. If this review offends anyone, don't fret it's just one mans opinion. I'm sure there are folks that may like it. We all have different taste. The last thing I want to do is ruin a business but I thought I'd give my honest opinion.
2016-05-10,1,Overpriced bad food and terrible service.  The brisket chili had more chunks of fat than actual meat.  In addition, my order was screwed up and I was over-charged.  Did I mention we also got an attitude and a lecture about how the customer is supposed to have singles to pay with and the restaurant doesn't have change? Spend your money at any of the other restaurants in town.  This one gets a big thumbs down.
2016-05-09,3,Loved the decor.Manager was on site and was super helpful and extremely nice.Chicken wings were amazingly delicious!That said, everything else was mediocre. It's also not exactly cheap, so... It's 3 starts for me.
2016-05-08,3,The 'cue is real, none of that liquid smoke nonsense. And it's good. Sides are good too, the right balance of salty and sweet to pair with the meat. I keep going back for the food, but the service needs a tweak, hence the rating. It's friendly - and that's half of it for me - but the attention to detail is just not there. Every time I've been there, something comes out wrong, something's missing from the table, whether it's something I ordered, or there's no BBQ sauce on the table, or no paper towels (and you will need them!)...sometimes multiple mistakes in one visit. Maybe there's a communication problem between the servers and the kitchen, maybe it's the kitchen, maybe there aren't enough servers or busers, I don't know. It just seems disorganized and that puts a dent in the experience. As another reviewer mentioned, I'm rooting for this place too. I really look forward to updating my review. Just get it together a little bit! Also, a small lagniappe would go a very long way - pickles, hushpuppies, cornbread or something to munch on with your first drink while you peruse the menu and wait for your food.
2016-05-06,5,Love the ribs and corn pudding! Corn pudding is amazing! Brisket Chili side is recommend!
2016-05-05,1,I don't often write reviews, but this I had to.  So, me and my GF decided to go on a Weds night because we we're craving BBQ.  Brisket to be more specific.  We get in and are seated immediately and the waitress takes our drink order.  We order 2 tap beers.  15 mins later someone comes by and asks if we need drinks, we say we already ordered a while ago, but would like to order our food now.  We order the brisket with a side of coleslaw and mac and cheese.  Then, the waitress comes back with our beers.  The were COMPLETELY flat. I mean zero carbonation, basically beer flavored water.  The other guy comes back and we tell him the beer is completely flat, he apologizes and gets us two different beers, and says "I'm very sorry, these beers are on me."  Very nice of him, however those beers were flat too, so something is clearly wrong with their entire tap.  Food arrives and we are starving so we dive in.  Doesn't take us long to realize this is literally the worst brisket either of us have ever had.  It was WAY over cooked, (wouldn't be surprised if it was days old and "resmoked").  It tasted more like dry corn beef with a smokey flavor than BBQ Brisket.  We eat it anyway cause we were starving.  The sauces they had helped a little, but even they were bland.  Moving on to the sides, it's really hard to mess up simple things like mac and cheese and cole slaw, and although neither was terrible they were not very good at all.  The Mac and cheese was very blah, I could have made a better mac and cheese at home in 15 mins using 3 ingredients. The cole slaw was clearly a prepackaged mix that had zero flavor to it at all and was overly watery. We aren't the type to complain so we get our check and notice the 2 flat beers that we're "on me" as the guy told us, we were indeed charged for...whatever.  We pay the bill and leave and realize if we had spent 15 mins to take the path into the city we could have not wasted our time and money on such a disappointing experience.  Bad restaurants don't last long in prime locations here in hoboken and this is one of the worst I've seen in a while.  Don't waste your time.  I have had amazing BBQ in the city, just take the extra time to go there.  This is crap and anyone who is rating this place well or saying this is actually good BBQ doesn't know what the hell they are talking about.
2016-04-27,4,Great addition to the Hoboken waterfront.  Ordered ribs and brisket, with two sides of slaw and brisket chilli.  Everything was good, service was nice, live music was a good touch.  I will say that these are probably not their signature sides, next time will try others.   Was surprised that there was no option for cornbread though!  Will come back for sure.
2016-04-24,5,Awesome food and service. Went to my nephews first birthday party there. Singer playing guitar and face painting for the kids, apparently they're there on Sunday's. More food then we could eat (50 people). Brisket was moist and tender, ribs fall off the bone. Wait staff never kept us waiting for a drink, and the owner ( always checking in) never rushed us out ( he also seems to be the bus boy).We will be back, and if you want a great authentic Texas bbq, this is the place! Throw in river front setting, and validated parking, they get my first 5 start review (I'm a pain in the butt)
2016-04-23,3,Ordered from Seamless on a Thursday night. Delivery was prompt so that was a plus. Delivery BBQ, I will admit, isn't the best way to enjoy this type of food. I ordered brisket, ribs, collared greens and beans. Everything was very tasty - he brisket a little salty the rib meat tender the collard greens flavorful and he beans rich with chunks of meat. They also provided plenty of BBQ sauce - big plus. But the portion was tiny and the price was 30 dollars. When I say tiny I mean one rib, two pieces of brisket, a handful of beans and another handful of collard greens. Lost s star because of the price and portions but the food is solid.
2016-04-19,2,I like House of Que, but there is room for improvement.  I recently came here on a nice spring Sunday with a friend and wanted to sit outside.  There were several open tables outside and seats at the exterior bar.  We weren't sure if we should sit ourselves since no one was outside, but the bus boy said check in with the hostess.  The hostess told us it'd be a 45 minute wait, despite there being several open seats.  She ended up calling us 20 minutes and said we could sit ourselves at any open table outside.  We had cocktails - a mojito and a spicy margarita.  They were good - but I'd expect that for $13+ in hoboken.  We both ordered the pulled pork sandwich.  We were very disappointed when it arrived.  The pork wasn't pulled at all - rather, it was chopped.  I would expect at a BBQ place they'd have pulled pork down to a science.  When we asked the waitress if the meal was correct, she answered - "yeah, this is the sandwich.  Sometimes they chop the pork instead of pulling it."   If I wanted a chopped pork sandwich, I would've ordered that.   The place can be fun with friends, but it's BBQ is overrated and overpriced for what you get.
2016-04-18,1,It was interesting to see so many bifurcated reviews on this place - I can safely say the negative reviews are deserved. Considered giving it 2 stars just for convenience in Hoboken and waterfront location but ultimately couldn't.The place is a messy array of tables, benches, and chairs - strangely none of it matches and more importantly the layout was entirely awkward. I ended up being sitting in the middle of an isle constantly getting bumped into. Some tables are blocked by columns, others simply should be removed. Service is slow to take orders (though food comes out quick being premade), the hostess was not at her station as we walked in. Seems like several employees just sitting around as we scanned the place to get someone's attention.Ordering food is a task in and of itself given the meats are sold by the pound and ultimately overpriced for what comes out of the kitchen. 1/2 lb of ribs yielded only 3 ribs total but the server said is enough for one person, thus a full lb would have been 6 ribs and well short of a rack for $16. I was surprised the restaurant did not round up for our table of two as to not give us an odd number. A lb of wings yielded about 9-10 wings for $12. 1/2 brisket portion seemed on point given no bones, but would be helpful if servers gave a little better guidance. They should really portion out food in single orders, with the option to order by the pound for large groups (probably more profitable as it is currently). So on to the food:Brisket - tender, but come fairly flavorless. Have to add your own bbq sauce - only two to choose from.Ribs - decent, but lack any sort of rub to make them tasty. Moist but not fall of they bone. NOTE: They only have one type of pork rib which is very disappointing. Most places have memphis dry rub and st louis style at least. Very disappointing to see no beef rib on the menu, but I doubt they would do a good job with that anyways.Wings - chipotle bbq - crispy under, but drenched in sauce. Sadly, probably best thing we tried in terms of taste.Mac & Cheese - HORRENDOUS. Bland, overcooked. Probably the worst I've ever had at a restaurant. Slaw - pretty generic, but met expectations.Cocktails at $11 are overpriced and light on alcohol. Overall I was very disappointed on food, price, and service. Would recommend Smoking Barrel over this place if you are looking for BBQ in hoboken.
2016-04-17,4,I was a bit hesitant to try this place after reading the mixed reviews. I have also been to the BBQ capital of the world, Austin Texas, and thought it would be tough to beat. Our group of 4 went on a Sunday for dinner with no reservation. We were told there was a 45 min wait, and I was nervous as reviews said it could me much longer. Pleasantly surprised when our table was ready in 20 min. Downside - 6pm and bar was out of first 3 beers I asked for that were on tap. Our waitress was nice and helpful, we got the 4 person combo deal. The brisket and ribs were my favorite, flavorful and full of meat. the sausage was my least favorite and dry. The chicken was above average. We got 4 sides - Mac and cheese which was bland and missing a flavor, bbq beans which were very disappointing - very runny and no taste, also needed a little flavor or smokiness on them. The chili was average, nothing overly impressive. Our favorite was the corn pudding and would highly recommend.Overall, service was slow but the food made up for it. Not as good as real Texas BBQ but a close second. Definitely the best you are going to get. Ambiance was cool and had ample outdoor seating. Bonus - if you park in parking garage and give them your coupon, you get free parking. I'd come back again.
2016-04-16,5,We had the chilli, brisket and the pulled pork sandwich. The food was excellent  and the service was very good. There was also somebody playinh live music, which is nice but it made conversations difficult since the music was simply too loud. The chilli is a can't miss! If you go there you've got to try it!
2016-04-16,1,Literally the slowest delivery ever in the history of the world. They lie about their delivery time and then continuously push it back.And then brought us the wrong food 2 hours later.
2016-04-16,1,Terrible service. If you choose to order on line like we did and we placed a huge order you can expect them to be super late, have issues getting through to even find out about your order, then have some flakey waitress tell you they can't find it bc they spelled your name wrong even though you place it online.  Save your money and tastebuds for something worth while. There is nothing worse than bad service and when a restaurant plays stupid and does not apologize or give an explaination, that's even worse.
2016-04-14,4,Delicious. Pulled pork, Cole slaw, and corn dish. I was a little worried it may not be fresh bc it was 4pm which is off peak. A little price but the bbq was solid so I'd eat again.
2016-04-13,1,This place is absolutely the worst. Went here a fee times to give it a shot and I am continuously disappointed. Not only is everything EXTREMELY overpriced. Food, beer and cocktail. Also the food I ordered came out incorrect and was disgusting. The mac and cheese was burnt and tasteless. The wings have the tickest skin in the heaviest, sugary sauce that clumps together. The meat isnt even good or white. I have given this place enough chances and I am not coming back. They are over charging customers for terrible food because their rent is through the roof being by the water. The only good thing about this place is the NYC skyline.
2016-04-08,3,The food, is great. The service, not so much. They have a bizarre phone tree to call in an place and order. They will not work with the customer to adjust the order, and, they will deliver your food earlier than you asked for.
2016-04-05,1,I waited for a while to be seated. Decided to sit near the bar until I realized the DJ was about to play. It was already too loud so they say me in the restaurant. After waiting for 10 minutes and having 4 servers walk by with no acknowledgement, I decided to take my dollars elsewhere.
2016-04-05,5,One of the best bbq places I have been. Great atmosphere and great drinks. Would highly recommend if you are in the area!
2016-04-05,1,Went for the $29.95 all you can eat special...what a joke.  After asking how long it lasted, we were told all night (lie number 1).  They bring it out in small portions and you can re-order as many times as you want...sounds great.  After the first order of brisket and ribs at 9:20pm, it went downhill quick.  The waiter disappeared.  We finished the small portion, 2 ribs and 2 pieces of brisket, quickly.  When he finally came back at 9:45, we placed another order of the same.  Instead of the ribs and brisket, he brought out a plate of sausage and said they were cooking more ribs and brisket (lie number 2) and this was to hold us over.  We flagged him down another 20 minutes later and he said "yeah you guys really ordered at the worst time since the kitchen closes at 10".  $90 + drinks for three of us to have two ribs and two pieces of brisket each...won't be back.
2016-04-02,5,Long time Yelper user, but rarely left any reviews. I decided I'm going to change that tact here as I have with my Waze App and other Apps. ;)We were at House of Que last week with two other couples (6 total) on Friday night, as one of the couples lives in Hoboken, and we all like to party there as its a fun town. We were all stoked, as we were all first timers. We didn't have a reservation and as walk-ins the hostess said it would be about 25 -35 min to be seated. So we gave our name and walked over to the bar to get drinks while we waited for our table. Bar area had a great vibe and was a fairly large, so it wasn't a struggle to get drinks (10min ?). Bartender was nice, yet more important was that our significant others are typically high maintenance about their mixed drinks, so when they all came out "right" the 1st time, I knew we were in the right place and we hadn't even eaten yet. We were seated in about 30 min, which was just fine. We were given the choice of ordering from the waitress or filling out our own menu card and walking up cafeteria style. We ordered from our waitress who was very helpful and attentive throughout our stay. We ordered  "The Long Horn" from the menu which included 2lbs of brisket, a whole chicken, 2 lbs of sausage and a few racks of ribs. WIt also included 4 orders of sides: we got the brisket chili, mac & cheese, corn (bread) pudding (to effin die for) and Texas cole slaw. The brisket was sliced in varying thicknesses and the thinner slices just literally melted in your mouth, and the thicker slices were spot on. The chicken was very tasty, which the ladies eventually had trouble sharing with us. The sausage was also very juicy (although it needed to be served warmer) and the ribs were fall off the bone and had super flavor (took some of these home as we were stuffed). All the sides were great, with the corn bread pudding being so over the top and only lasting all but 2 min., so we ordered some more of that ! We were all too stuffed to try dessert. (next time we'll take more home so we can fit it in). All of us are into smoked meat joints and were therefore excited to have this place open up. Our waitress brought us another round of drinks, and since they have live music, we stayed for another hour+ drinking. We all agreed we'd come back here in heartbeat and can't wait for the good weather to eat outside. Thanks House of Que - until next time !! (PS - I also have to say they had very clean bathrooms !)
2016-03-31,5,Had the pulled pork - AH-MAZ-ING THE MOJITO IS LIFEWinston was the best - I love this place
2016-03-31,5,Love this place. Eat here every day if you can. I would if I could. Ask for Winston. Order the meat sampler. Also order pulled pork. Corn pudding and brisket chili are amazing. You're welcome, everyone.
2016-03-25,2,The space/layout is awesome--really cool design and I like the music and vibe of the place. The food left a lot to be desired, though. I had the brisket which was just okay, the slaw which needed more vinegar, and the beans which were eh. The mac n cheese was really bad--it was almost soapy. One of the sauces was really good to dip in, but I'm not about to give an extra star for a condiment. I would like to come hang out here and drink (dueling piano's on Saturdays sounds awesome), but $7 for a Shiner Bock is crazy (Shiner:Texas what Yuengling:PA). With the amount of lunch options in the downtown area, I won't be going back for that. Two of us spent $40+ on two lunch "specials" and a beer each. I wasn't expecting Franklin BBQ, but I was hoping it would be better than some of the NYC places (Hill Country, RUB). Hearing that the pit master came from the Salt Lick, I just expected better, and it wasn't even close to the good Texas BBQ I've had (Salt Lick, Kreitz Market, Smitty's, Pecan Lodge). They're still relatively new, so hopefully they get some feedback and make some adjustments--I would love it if the place turned out to be great.
2016-03-23,2,BBQ is very good, but as to delivery they left 1/3 off my order. Disappointing, especially since I  paid for the food that was never delivered.
2016-03-23,5,WAHOOO! Some of the best BBQ in NJ.  fun times had by all
2016-03-23,5,best. bbq. ever. period! this place is not to be missed!
2016-03-23,5,The best bbq in NJ! The staff was super nice and the pulled pork sandwich is so yummy! I've been twice and cant wait to go back!
2016-03-22,5,Have always enjoyed the restaurant, but recently started working with Morgan from events on booking a rather large, somewhat complex event- she has gone above and beyond to this point, making my job much easier, and less stressful. Will send an update for how everything goes, but so far, so good.
2016-03-20,3,I want to start by saying there were/are a lot of things that I really liked about this place. i love the music they play, the food was great (I had the pulled pork sandwich with the mac salad side), I enjoyed the general vibe. I was there for the dueling piano show on Saturday night - the performers were good, fun, lively, played some great songs. However I had a real huge problem with the way this places seats people. It is absolutely absurd. They boast on their website that they have cafeteria style food service and I even heard one of the managers say it someone while we were there. However - they require you to put your name down to get a seat and they take reservations. Which is absurd if you are offering cafeteria style/self service. We got there and it was a 40 minute wait for a table. We were able to grab drinks at the bar and hang around but you need a table to put your food on so we couldn't eat. It probably took about an hour and half to get a drink. The managers were constantly apologizing to people. The hostess seemed overwhelmed and didn't really always seem like she knew when you were going to get your table. To top that off - they also offer waitress service. So its extremely confusing. You have the option of using your waitress or using the self serve option. This place NEEDS TO PICK ONE. If you are going to make people wait 1.5 hours to sit at a table and then tell them they can get their food at a counter on their own - absurd. If you are going to have counter service then you should allow people to pick their own seats. On a Saturday night - this is a bar  - not a restaurant - it is a bar with food and it should be treated as such. I also believe they should NOT take reservations - because it isn't a formal dining environment. It needs to figure things out. Also - they ran out of Fat Tire and PBR before 11 pm.
2016-03-19,5,Solid barbecue with welcoming service. This is where to go for Austin style smoky ribs, brisket or wings with a side of hospitality and a view of NYC.Came on St. Patty's Day. Owners were onsite and made everyone feel like VIPs. They went all out for the big day - free drinks and tshirts were given out. But the best part of the meal aside from the amazing food was the service - exactly what you would want from a small town like Hoboken. They were completely charming and dedicated to making sure every guest that walked in felt welcome. Such sweethearts! Made me like this place even more.The food was awesome. We got the lunch special for $13 with a taste of the ribs, brisket and sausage plus 2 generous sides. The ribs were meaty with a legit bark (a must for any good BBQ). Brisket was super tender. Mac and cheese was perfectly cheesy. Even the collards were delicious! Everything was so good and the place had such a great vibe that we ordered another round of ribs plus wings. Again, smoky and great portion. Can't end a meal like that without dessert - an enormous chocolate chip cookie served warm and warm peach cobbler. Do not leave without trying both. The design was also worth noticing. Lots of communal tables, huge booths and cafeteria style dining option make this the perfect place for groups. Every detail was perfect for Texas BBQ down to the tin ceilings with stars in the ladies room. Plus the whole place was spotless - no sticky menus, clean floors and it smelled only of good ol' bbq. This place gets everything right - food, service, vibe and decor. Does not always happen in Hoboken. We really needed this place. Can't wait to come back on weekends when they will have dueling pianos and walking live guitarists!
2016-03-18,1,Very loud music, can't even hear friend sitting next to me. Service is terrible - had to take food by myself after waiting 15 minutes for waitress to ask.
2016-03-18,1,I think they do not understand what the good service means. Very frustrating ordering system. Food is nit great. For the same price in the city will get better barbecue and service for sure... Music is so loud that we have to scream at each other on our table...
2016-03-18,5,Very nice addition to Hoboken. We were celebrating our anniversary and St. Patrick's Day. The entire staff was very friendly. The owner Sean and his partners were extremely welcoming. The food was great too. Will definitely come back and recommend to my friends.
2016-03-17,4,Solid & welcome addition to the food and bar scene in Hoboken. I love the vibe at this place. It is huge and open and manages to be one of those places that is what you make it. What do I mean by this? Examples: you can stop by for a drink or 5 on a random Sunday afternoon with friends, check. You can come for a casual date for drinks, check. You can come for a more serious date and get dinner, check. You can randomly be craving brisket and walk in and order takeout with your gym clothes on and your yoga mat around your shoulder, check! I may or may not have been guilty of that last one.I love the layout of the restaurant and how they've separated the bar from the dining tables, and how you can even comfortably dine at the bar! Everything I've tried of their food so far, I've loved. So far, I've had the brisket (personal favorite), the corn bread pudding (yum!), and the mac salad (classic). I've heard less enthusiastic reviews of the pulled pork and the mac and cheese from my roommates, but thus far I've yet to have a bad experience. Can't wait for next football season here!
2016-03-16,2,Maybe there are still kinks, but this place could be so much better. Too many TVs, I mean seriously mounted everywhere. The service is outrageously slow, more than a half hour to get drinks last time I was there and the first time wasn't much better. I tried ordering a side from the waitress and it ended up coming well after we'd finished our entire meals. Wish I could say the BBQ made up for the other issues...
2016-03-14,5,I went here a few weeks ago with my son and his friends to hear the dueling pianos.The service was great the manager, our waiter were so helpful. The manager gave us this round table next to the stage. I have to say it was a really fun night.
2016-03-13,1,Sorry to say but this place kinda sucks, first of all the ordering process is so confusing it's a slow moving cafeteria style line with rude servers. If it's your first time there good luck. You have no idea how they serve how to order and how much anything costs. So while you are confused with ordering there's no prices posted so you have no idea what your spending. After I carried a 30lb metal tray full of my food through two active closed doorways and to my table I forgot the silverware which I had to get up and get that myself again and of course that to was a whole ordeal itself. It cost 92.00 for 2 people and I had no idea it would be that much. Good was ok but nothing special and I had to listen to horrible country music the entire time. Definatly not going back. I give this place a year max. In business
2016-03-12,3,Came here on a Sat evening at 6:30pm w/o a reservation, so we were told it would be a 30min wait. 45 mins later, we were told ANOTHER 30 mins by hostess who seemed unsure of that answer even. So we chose to just take food togo and eat it on their patio tables. I wish that option was presented to be before I waited 45 mins. On to the food, we got a lb of brisket, 1/2 lb of chicken, the brisket chili, mac & cheese and the slaw. The brisket was decent, but the chicken was great. The sides were great as well. So we ate on the patio tables, and it was a tad bit cold since we are next to the water, so the food didn't stay hot very long. Its a cute place, the music was great (a lot of country) So we spoke with the manager, Matt and he apologized for the horrible service and gave us a refund for our meal, which is why I am giving more stars than I would due to his awesome customer service skills.After we already ate, spoke to the manager and left, they called me stating my table is ready, 1.5 hours later. Goooodbye.
2016-03-11,4,Using Hill Country as the tri-state benchmark for cafeteria style BBQ this place comes awfully close. Hands down the brisket is the best, followed by the ribs, pulled pork and chicken. The sides are good but it's that brisket that you'll keep coming back for, my God! In the two times I've visited the manager has stopped by to check in and make sure everything was ok. That should speak volumes to how committed they are to their customers. Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed.
2016-03-11,2,Meh. Average at best. We came in here for dinner last night were a bit disappointed. When we asked for a table outside, we had to talk to 3 different people before getting a seat. There didn't seem to be a lot of communication at the front of the house. The service was equally as average and it took about 10 minutes for our waitress to bring us our beers. Positives:-The pulled pork sandwich (slaw + special sauce) - highlight: special sauce.-Macaroni and cheese - pretty satisfying.Negatives: -St. Louis Ribs - weren't very flavorful and I was hoping for more of a "fall off the bone" texture/consistency. -Sides - I was a bit disappointed with the selection of these sides. Wish they had more in the way of something like hush puppies or corn fritters or something. -BBQ beans - just don't even order these.Pretty affordable, but overall disappointing. I realize they are still new, but they're not THAT new. Gotta iron out those small kinks to improve the average quality of your BBQ.
2016-03-11,4,Amazing barbecue and service! Only thing I'd change would be the cocktails. Pretty much all the drinks we ordered were either extremely sweet or very sour. Stick with beer or wine here!
2016-03-11,3,This place is still new, so they may just need some time to work out the kinks. Let me start by saying their customer service was AMAZING, I forgot our waiter's name (tall, black guy) but he was super nice and very helpful. The ambience of this place is pretty nice too, they did a great job making it feel like you're in a backyard. There's a bar along the border that you can sit at while still being outside, with the view of the water and NYC it almost has a Miami beach feel. It also looks like they have a cover band every Friday and dueling pianos on Saturday. I'm not a big country fan but you can check their website for more deets.So, on to why I only gave 3 stars. There are 2 ways you can order here (as our waiter informed us). At the table with your waiter or cafeteria style, where you walk up, choose and carry it back to your table. I was with a group of 5 for lunch, a few of us knew what we wanted already so we ordered with the waiter. The rest walked up to get a better look at what they had to offer and ended up choosing it there. Our ordered food took an additional 20 minutes! I was really disappointed because it comes from the exact same place and it wasn't crowded at all. It just put kind of a damper on my experience. If you ever come here, just go grab the food yourself. I personally think it should all be served this way, as I've been to BBQ places that just offer self service. In addition, the food was cold. Everyone's meat was cold. I'm not the type of diner who needs my food piping hot, but I don't expect it to be cooler than room temperature.I ordered the sliced brisket sandwich, nothing to write home about but the tangy BBQ sauce they offer is pretty good. I had a side of corn pudding which essentially is cornbread with pieces of corn in it, and it was really tasty. Other people at my table had the Chopped BBQ sandwich and they enjoyed it. Overall, I'd come back. I loved the ambience, service and the food was decent. They offer comment cards at the end of the experience to get your feedback, which is a great practice. I wish this place much success.
2016-03-09,4,Direct from Austin, Hoboken now has it's own legitimate Texas style BBQ joint. With credentials from what may be the best BBQ place on the planet, Salt Lick outside Austin, Tx, the bbq here should be top notch. The brisket is good, but in my opinion, a bit drier and less marbled than the deep hearted red slices you get in Texas. With the tasty sauce on each table though, it is delicious. Better than the brisket though, were the amazing wings. These are cooked with a perfect crispy skin and imbued with strong tangy bbq flavor, clearly not just dumped on at the end. Even the blue cheese is better than average, I believe with the addition of buttermilk. Get your hands and face messy with some of these bad boys. The mac and cheese was just ok, only a little stronger than the boxed variety. The brisket chilli was delicious though. Perhaps a bit on the salty side, but it goes down well with a beer. The beer menu is a bit disappointing when comparing with the great craft beer scene in Austin as the only entrants here are Guinness, Sam Adams, and Shiner. Service was very friendly and the food came out incredibly fast. You can order at the table or go up to the butcher to select the pieces you'd like. The menu lists items by the pound, but you can go in 1⁄4 or  1/2 pound increments as well. The ambiance is pretty authentic for Texas with wooden picnic tables, garage doors that open in the summer for fresh air, and even live music pretty often. Only the large red and white vinyl booths that look like they are from a 50s diner don't seem to fit in.
2016-03-06,2,Pretty unimpressive, half empty and still slow service, requested drinks 3 times before arriving. Food was "meh", ribs inconsistent, guitar player was great, pretty expensive for what it was. Overall not recommended.
2016-03-06,5,This place is amazing !!! The ribs and the brisket are delicious and the people that work here are very friendly .. Definitely coming back !
2016-03-05,1,I brought my husband here as a Sunday treat. We love barbeque so we had high expectations from reading the reviews. We arrived. Waited to be seated. While looking around it seemed really unorganised. It's the weekend! It is busy everywhere so thought they should have been more prepared. The hostess as seating people, clearing and cleaning tables. We got seated at a large picnic table. Pretty cool. I am confused as to what style they want the resturant to be. They have self service for some people, loud music bar area other end, middle section has kitchen & then dining area with mix of booths and picnic tables. Anyway, our picnic table was near the register & front door. The trolley had about 12 metal trays, plates, unwashed cutlery & it looked a mess. The floor had food on it around the resturant & I noticed a man with a family across from us take his foot and kick/ move food that was on ground under his table. Our waitress was so run off her feet she didn't get to us to take drinks so the hostess gave us a sheet to fill out to bring up to order ourselves in self service. I did - it was quick. Great. The pulled pork wad little dry,the ribs were amazing!! The beans could have been more texas & less gravity - was not thick but soupy! Another girl started work and she helped out massively. She cleared the unwashed area on the trolley,  she gave us our drinks & cutlery. My husband ordered a cocktail & it was 12 dollars for the SMALLEST jam jar of a drink!! Robbery! Then Our waitress then asked what did we get from the self servuce. I told her the sheet infilled out was up at the kitchen register as we were over half way fibished eating. She just starting looking at our meal & asking questions.. was bizarre. Why fill out sheet? Thought then there must not be communication between the sections. Looking around again - some tables were complaining they wanted to pay cheque and one of the bus boys said it to the waitresses & was apologizing to the table. Just felt it was a frantic experience. I didn't relax one bit! We asked for cheque. The waitress gave it & apologized for the lack of service & frantic atmostphere & said she hopes we come bac! That would be a no! There are nicer places to eat in hoboken!
2016-03-05,5,Danni B.SPOT ON BBQ!!!! I am a mac and cheese fanatic and theirs is amazing!!!  The staff were all so friendly, and the view is hands down one of the best in Hoboken.  Can't wait until summer for outdoor seating.  Love the huge bar, and of course my boyfriend loves the TV's!!!  Have gone with a few large groups, perfect for our friends 40th, we all ordered different things to share,  the pulled pork was melting in my mouth.   Such a cool vibe, best BBQ around, perfect view on the water, prices so reasonable and generous portions.My bf and friends love it, think we may be regulars!
2016-03-01,5,Based on what I'd read and seen about House of 'Que before I went there last Saturday night (February 27, 2016), my expectations were high. I'm a pretty tough critic, and I have to say that House of 'Que exceeded my expectations. We will be back for sure.From the moment my party of four walked in we knew we were in four a great time. The place was packed, but we never felt crowded. The vibe was just right--House of 'Que tells you this is the kind of joint you want to spend an entire evening eating (lots), drinking (of course), watching, listening (we were there for the very fun Dueling Pianos), and hanging. I'm always in search of what I call being in the moment, and House of 'Que delivers in a big way.Food: Simply put, this is real-deal barbecue. The four of us had the Pitmaster's deal--$72 for a fantastic, abundant mix of ribs, brisket, sausage, and chicken with four tasty sides. You taste the smoke on the succulent meats (they use hickory, oak, and cherry, I think) but it is by no means overwhelming. The two sauces (a ketchup-based one and a vinegar-based one) were just right: They didn't overwhelm the meat at all. We got to meet Mike Rodriguez, who was pitmaster at the famous Salt Lick outside Austin, Texas. This guy knows barbecue and he and his crew serve up righteous stuff. The wings and nachos starters were also top-notch. Details matter to me, so I appreciated the really good chips--not at all greasy, these chips were light and crispy, the perfect foil to the rich toppings.We ended up with a to-go box with two big slices of brisket, a whole chicken leg, and a link of sausage. My wife devoured some of the leftovers the next day.By the way, consider going cafeteria style for your main meal. You can go up and tell the guys which cuts you want. (The owner brought us a special treat of some burnt ends--unreal flavor, which comes from doing the BBQ right.)Drinks: Gotta have drinks with this food. This is no chi-chi speakeasy. Just a solid bar with enough good beer choices and a really good cocktail menu with drinks that are just right for this food. The bar area was rocking when we went but I was able to grab myself a beer without any wait at the bar (after enjoying an interesting twist on a Mojito and another nice fruity drink).Ambience: As I said above, this plays makes you want to hang out. The decor isn't some cheesy, fake Texas roadhouse wannabe. Even though it's right on the Hudson overlooking Manhattan once you step inside you could be in some Texas honky tonk--it just feels right. The owner has clearly taken a lot of care in using reclaimed materials and lots of other cool stuff. There's a lot to look at and appreciate (beyond the attractive women who were there) if you're into that kind of thing. Don't forget to check out the view (especially as the weather gets warmer). House of 'Que is right on the waterfront, so after a satisfying meal you'll want to take a stroll. Who knows? Maybe you'll build up an appetite and grab something to go from the restaurant. Your family will thank you.Don't miss this place. Rally a big group of friends, clear your schedules (and put down your devices), and settle in for an awesome night of fine food and fun.
2016-02-29,4,Had the Pitmaster! For 4ppl...Delivery! Great portion of meats..The Ribs my favorite! Outstanding barbecue sauce!...had four sides..best pick Corn pudding,Collard greens & coleslaw not crazy about Mac & cheese..others loved it!! Now this was takeaway and enjoyed..planning on going to eat here this weekend eating in I will most definitely fall madly in love with House of Que!! Good job!!
2016-02-29,2,Food was ok. Service was awful. Place itself was nice and atmoshphere was good but enough to make up for decent BBQ at a place that focuses on that
2016-02-28,5,Outstanding food and service. From the minute our party walked in we were well taken care of. The service was attentive and the BBQ was excellent. Everyone from the hostess, to our waitress, the guys behind the line firing up the food to the busboy did their jobs well and made us feel at home and well taken care of.We were a party of 4 hungry guys, started with wings which were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside as they are supposed to be. Ordered the Pitmaster's Pick and had more than enough food to go around. The sausage, ribs and brisket were standouts and cooked to perfection. Two types of bbq sauce, one sweeter and one spicier was a nice touch. As for sides the corn pudding was incredible and the cole slaw was fresh and not over sauced.If you take the time to ask about the place the owner will talk to you about the effort put in to make it unique. Ask about where the bar came from.To top it off it was dueling piano night which was a mix of great tunes and humor. I looked around and the majority of the place could not keep themselves from singing along.As for desserts its cobbler or pecan pie. We ordered both and were not disappointed. Cobbler was warm and ice cream was fresh on both.On top of it all you cannot pay for a view like the one this place has. Unbelievable view of the city. I cannot wait to come back when the weather warms up and you can eat outside.
2016-02-28,5,I've been to the House of Que a few times and it's been 5 Stars everytime. The food is outstanding - both the meats and sides. The drinks are great as well. And the service is fast and very friendly. This is definitely the best BBQ around.  I recommend the brisket, pork shoulder and the sausage as well as the brisket chili and the corn pudding.
2016-02-28,5,Was here in January with a group of 12 for NFL playoffs and had a great time!  Was back recently with just a few people and just as good.  Love the layout and design of the place.  The wings were my favorite and the ribs and corn pudding were great!  Need to try the pulled pork and chicken next
2016-02-28,5,Went with a group of nine.  Had great food, great service and a great time.  The place is big so you don't feel all jammed in.  Highly recommend it!!
