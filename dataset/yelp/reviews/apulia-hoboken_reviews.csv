2021-10-31,1,Management was not nice to another family that was dining right when we walked in so we canceled our reservation. Very uncomfortable.
2021-10-25,5,Easily one of my favorite spots for pizza in Hoboken! Feel this one is very slept on and deserves way more love. Went with their "D.O.P." Pie this time around, which consists of apulian tomatoes, mozz, prosciutto DP, arugula, 3 year aged parm DOP & EVOO. Amazingly balanced flavors and the dough here is special!
2021-10-14,5,Awesome little spot! Reservation was for outside and it was so cute in the patio. BYOB which is a plus but you can also buy a bottle while there. We got the margarita pizza (amazing!), cacio e pepe, and a carbonara. Carbanara was SO GOOD, and cacio e pepe was also good but very very cheesy - bit overbearing with parmesan. We also got the coffee dessert at the end (name?) but it was to DIE FOR!!!! Must try. Only negative I can say was the service when we first got there. The waiter, maybe manager, was rude. Told us he couldn't find our reservation and gave us attitude that he couldn't seat us. Finally found our reservation.
2021-10-13,4,Big fan of the personal pizzas that are thin crust with high quality ingredients. Ordered out a few times which works, though the outdoor dining in back is lovely. A little pricey, lunch for two was $75 (no drinks), but that's because it's tough not to order burrata and a few other delicious additions to pizz.
2021-09-30,2,Nice looking place in Northeast Hoboken with a private outdoor patio space in the back and some tables outside in the front. Inside, the pizza oven dominates the center of the main dining room with a small ice cream freezer at the front. Promptly seated and scanned the menu. Ordered the beet salad and a rustica (prosciutto, sausage, broccoli rabe) pizza. The salad was fine, nicely presented, but nothing spectacular. Good, but not a great value given the price. The pizza however, was disappointing. Soggy in the middle and probably should have been kept in the oven for another minute. Not very flavorful. The crust greatly resembled a large naan that could have been toasted a bit longer. Walked down Washington later and noticed some other pizza places were busier - will probably try them next time.
2021-09-26,5,Great vibe & excellent food! Burrata was delicious!! We got the buffalo mozzarella pizza & hazelnut + spicy honey pizza. Both great, but the honey wasn't spicy. The penne pasta had a unique texture, freshlymade & al dante! Both affogato  & tiramisu were great! They have really good espresso flavor.
2021-08-26,5,Hands down the BEST pizza I have ever had in my life!!! Don't skip the calamari and make sure you try their carbonara! You'll never want it to end. Beautiful patio and amazing service. Ask for Frank, he's awesome
2021-07-31,3,Amazing, excellent and well crafted food....  Excellent !!   BUT -- the service is quite bad and the worst part of the evening was the intense and exceptionally LOUD hard rock music blasting.  We asked 3 times to please lower the music and the "manager" came to the table and said he would or did but 6 of us were screaming over the table for conversation.... I'd not go back for that reason alone.   Especially at the prices they are charging.   Also, they need to get real napkins.   The Costco napkins were a bit down and dirty.   All in all, this is a good take out place.   Def not a place for dining environment or relaxing enjoyment.
2021-07-08,5,This spot is a gem. It is BYOB but I believe they also serve wine there. Make sure to grab your favorite bottle of wine and head on over there to enjoy a relaxing Saturday night. They have vibey outdoor seating in a mini courtyard out back which is a cozy spot to linger over dinner in the balmy summer evenings. This is a good first, second, third, forever date spot. It's off the beaten path in uptown Hoboken. The pasta is homemade so the chew!! *chef's kiss*. The waiter told me the chef makes the food just how they do back in his hometown in Apulia in Southern Italy and travels there frequently so it is as authentic as it gets! I would 1000% get the pasta here again. Their pizzas are woodfired, to 1000 degrees I think they mentioned. Unfortunately, my pizza was a little soggy in the middle for some reason so the pizza would flop over and not hold up the ingredients. I'm not sure I would go back here for the pizza. But maybe I would order a more simple one next time.
2021-07-01,4,I came here to try the pizza and my rate is exclusively on that. I liked the place, an italian spot in New Jersey. The pizza place is in the center of the restaurant. They are fast, the pizza came in 10'. The pizza is very good, much better than the average in USA.
2021-06-26,2,The reason for the 2.5 star review is because we ordered the bruschetta as an appetizer and the bread was unfortunately hard as a rock and therefore very difficult to eat. The outdoor backyard seating looked great, but the ambience of the indoor seating didn't feel as nice. The pizza we got was actually pretty tasty although the vegetariana was just the slightest bit soggy. The waiter and service was not bad though. Overall okay experience
2021-06-19,5,Apulia is hands down the best pizza in Hoboken. The service is great and the staff is always friendly. Highly recommend.
2021-06-16,3,Pretty Good food and BYOB but they WILL not give you even a full hour if you don't continue ordering. We were soooooo rushed and then told we had ten min left. Ridiculous. I prob would've ordered more had they gave us a chance. Prob were there maybe 35 full minutes (ordered pizza, calamari, and gelato).
2021-06-11,2,Could be much better.     Service was likely the issue.   Pizza wasn't as firey hot (fresh out of the oven - burn your mouth hot)  as I'd expect for a restaurant that was very quiet.  Assume the waiter let the order sit before serving it, he also did not come back to check on the order.    Better spots in my opinion.
2021-05-26,2,Food wasn't great, the octopus was very over cooked to the point that it was hard to cut. The shrimp was pretty good but that was the most stand out item I think. The server was very antsy to get us going on our orders, which was difficult because there was six of us. He made sure to remind us 3-4 times that we were on a time clock. The whole experience was pretty disappointing. Can't say I plan to go back any time soon.
2021-04-24,5,A fine italian restaurant with great food and a good vibe! The inferno pizza is absolutely delicious!!  The theatrics with the presentation were unexpectedly delightful, the pizza was literally on fire! We also ordered the ravioli and panzerotti which were equally good. The tiramisu is a must have!!!
2021-03-16,5,First time here. Very impressed with the food. So much flavor in everything! Ryan was great at recommending various dishes. Grilled octopus was delicious. Will be back for sure. Thank you guys!
2021-03-14,5,Edward is the best, and pizza is amazing! Edward made you feel like family. It is a good BYOB. Everyone is very professional and very nice. Music and atmosphere is great. Just would prefer more relaxing service.
2021-03-13,2,The food was really good but the way we were greeted and the way our waiter acted was not enjoyable. When we arrived I stated the name and reservation time for the back patio.  The guy who greeted us asked if we wanted the back or the front and I asked which was a nicer ambiance and he just laughed and said it was warmer in the front...it very much was not. We requested to be moved to the back patio. When we were seated in the back our waiter Marco came out and asked which wine we wanted opened first.  I asked my friend to choose as we were celebrating her birthday (which was mentioned in the reservation notes and nothing was done for her) and as she was choosing the waiter rudely says "3-2-1 choose" as if waiting there for 30 seconds while she chooses was such an inconvenience.  When we were ordering, we requested everything to be gluten free which wasn't a problem.  We ordered the linguine dish and asked if the gluten free pasta was linguine or something else and our waiter told us it was gluten free linguine--it was not.  Our dish came out and it was penne.  When we finished our meals the waiter came and said our only gluten free dessert was gelato and we said okay that we just want a few minutes to digest before looking at the dessert menu.  After about 5 minutes the waiter comes back and tosses the bill on our table and walks away, doesn't even say anything.  We really thought that was strange and rude because not only did we not ask for the check but he didn't even come back to check if we wanted anything else.  As we look at the bill we notice a service charge and a bottle opening charge.  We asked our waiter what the service charge was and he said it was for opening the wine I said then why is there a separate opening charge and he said oh I don't know I am new here let me go ask.  Now we had put our credit cards down and he took the bill, took our cards, and we watched him go in  and just charge our cards--didn't even try to pretend to go and talk to someone.  It just seemed so sneaky and dishonest.  I think any additional charges should be displayed clearly on the menu whether it's a service charge or what the corking fee is.  In regards to the corking fee their menu just states a fee MAY apply.  So what does that mean you just pick and choose who you'll charge a corking fee to?  It is sad because the food really is good, but when you receive service like this and see how dishonest they are it just ruins the entire experience.
2021-03-07,5,Five star food, vibe and service. I highly recommend the Apulia way. We then got the gelato and espresso for the perfect ending to the meal.
2021-02-24,5,A friend of mine told us about this place. The minute you taste their pizza you transform yourself to Italy. It's probably the most authentic pizza I ever tried in America. It's so fresh and delicious and it's BYOB.  I am waiting for the NYT to rated this Pizza as good as Razza (which according to them is the best pizza in NY). I also love their local element and the whole story about Puglia a region in Italy which is where their name and their taste come from.
2021-02-12,5,This pizza restaurant was part of a magic trick by Dan white the magician tonight! Would love to know if you really picked the queen of hearts
2021-02-01,5,A must-try Italian experience that will certainly become your go-to dine-in/out option, as it embraces an Italian authenticity that is truly unparalleled in the area. From the food, to the staff, to the ambiance, you will be rewarded with a sense of warmth and delicacy that never disappoints.
2021-01-24,5,Very authentic Italian food to be had here! Don't miss out on their hot chili oil- this was a great addition for dipping out pizza and drizzling on the pasta.  I'd like to come back and try the sampler special (chef chooses variety of items for your meal).
2021-01-17,5,This place has great ambience, hip but kinda romantic. The service is very attentive and knowledgeable. There is a wine list but BYOB is accepted. The pizza is absolutely delicious and the pasta dishes are well thought out and filling. I've come here with my fiancé many times and we love it.
2021-01-11,3,So disappointing. Our 2 pies and mussels all needed to be cooked another 90 seconds. No char or crispness to the crust at all. We agreed it was like Italian ingredients on Naan. The pie with sopressata and hazelnuts was overly sweet and we tossed a slice. Who throws away pizza? I'll stick with Mario's.PS...They literally charge $5 for delivery. Not seamless or grubhub, but directly from their website. Who does that??$70 and the 2 of us are still hungry.
2021-01-07,5,Probably the best Italian in hoboken. The pizza is better than many of the most popular places in New York. I've only gotten delivery but I'm sure it's even better in person. Highly recommend the Diavla and they have a solid caesar.
2020-12-31,4,Apulia is a pizza that's elevated. It's pizza that you can take a date to while still feeling like a try hard, or simpler, pizza you can eat while feeling you're not settling for dinner. My understanding is that Apulia is venture from former employees of Ridgewood's S. Egidio. Their style is similar, creatively imagined and deliciously executed Neapolitan pizza using a brick coal oven and fine ingredients. The end result is either on par or better.I won't do the pizzas justice with words, so I'll end it by simply saying that you should check this place out.
2020-12-16,5,Best Italian in Hoboken hands down. Real fresh ingredients, always leave happy, super clean environment, even before covid. 11/10
2020-11-22,3,Since seemed to have survived awhile including during covid figure should give place a try.Place was okay with some good and some less than good.In regards to covid they have outdoor seating out front and in back garden.  Stated had heat lamps out back.  The menu has exactly what expect from italian place nowadays with variety of pastas and fancy pizzas. Got the orecchiette which was okay but found pasta not well cooked but that is a preference of how al dente one wants it. Decent amount of sausage buy did not find very flavorful. Have three wines of each color that come in full or half bottle.   Looked up my red on Vivino and there were no reviews but the smoky variety by same vineyard had people stating would rather lick an ashtray.  It was not that bad but nothing special.  Know more limited in half bottle sizes but since saving money by never having wine go to waste should do better.Service was good and might come back if have another decent weather night to take advantage of heated garden.
2020-11-15,5,This is hands down my favorite BYOB spot in Hoboken. The staff is always so accommodating and gracious. I've only had five star experiences here. If you're a first timer at Apulia you'll need to know it's BYOB and they're isn't a corkage fee. It's one of my favorite features of this spot. The second thing to know is, you'll want to order everything on the menu. I've gone with different sizes groups and we typically order something from each section. The inferno and Davila pizzas are two of my favorites. They split the menu between reds and white sauces which I really love. As for pasta, the broccoli Rob pasta is incredible. Oh and dessert, yes dessert! The Nutella calzone. This is a real thing! I didn't want to order it at first, but I'm so glad we did. One of the best things I've tried!If you're a foodie, this is a must visit. Don't by shy and ask the staff for recommendations. They really know what they're talking about!
2020-11-08,4,Great BYOB spot in Hoboken with amazing pizza. They do take reservations and have a great backyard seating area. One downside is it is pretty chaotic when arriving/being seated. They do take reservations though which can help avoid this.
2020-10-29,5,Honestly, pizza was fantastic.  Hoboken is loaded with mediocre pizza places and this one was surprisingly great.  A little expensive, but worth it.
2020-10-26,5,Love the seating in the back of the restaurant and Apulia's vibes. My girlfriends and I loved the grilled octopus and orecchiette! Really enjoyed the margherita pizza but the DOP was alright. Great addition to Hoboken for sure!
2020-09-22,4,My friend and I went to this restaurant on a Friday and sat outside on the patio. The inside and ambience is definitely the best part. For an app, we shared the Uccelletti which was Prosciutto wrapped around fresh mozz. and then broiled the oven. This was phenomenal! However the server was supposed to bring us bread and never did. To his defense, I think he was busy and possibly the only server in the restaurant. It was delicious without though.. and lord knows we didn't need more bread during this meal!For entrees, we shared a margarita pizza and the Tagliatelle Bolognese. Margarita pizza was thin crust and was just ok. Nothing stood out to me. The pasta was delicious and homemade. Overall a solid night.
2020-09-19,1,Never again We were celebrating our nephew's  birthday  and we made a reservation a week ago at "Apulia" because hardly any restaurants were taking reservations in Hoboken on Saturday evening - more of a first come first served basis.We arrived at the restaurant on time, were seated promptly. We ordered 4 entrees, 2 Margherita pies, 1 Bolognese and 1 tuna. After about 30 mins the Bolognese and tuna arrived which was tolerable. After waiting almost an hour into those meals we inquired about the 2 pizza pies, the server flippantly made a sign of "thumbs up" but still no sign of the pies. They obviously are amateurs with no idea of how to treat their guests as  the owner comes out and when we tell him we were waiting for over an hour for the food, he says "GOOD". And "do you still want the pizzas; I will start them now?" Obviously, someone had "botched" the order for the pies because they had not even started yet. Aghast at the treatment , we said "no". Never again, what an awful experience! We  were quite dumbfounded at comments such as "we are very busy", "it comes from 2 separate kitchens".  The only positive thing was they "comped" the meals.  We would have much preferred to have the 2 pies than not have to pay for the 2 meals our guests ate. Don't go there - there are plenty of amazing places in Hoboken for a memorable meal.
2020-09-18,1,Horrible experience. We ordered 2 appetizers and a pizza. We got the appetizers in a normal time 20-30 minutes. When we were done the apps, we waited for the pizza for over an hour. We kept asking where it was and the waiter said they must've lost the ticket and after an hour 20 minutes we asked for the check as we were no longer hungry. It's a shame that we came for the pizza and left without any pizza/dinner. Won't be returning anytime soon. Don't come here hungry because there's a chance you won't get to eat!
2020-09-14,5,I hardly visit Hoboken, and given that there are so many restaurants in the area, I relied on trusty Yelp to find me a spot to eat. And I'm glad that I decided to go with Apulia.I had the Cacio e Pepe and thought it was very good. The waiter was also very nice and able to recommend and describe different dishes.
2020-09-12,5,Don't be fooled by the outdoor seating in the front! You really want to sit out back if you can - it's really pretty! My bf had gone a bunch of times with his friends, and suggested I try it too. I got the Fresca and he ordered the Romana. We also split the beet salad. It was so nice to eat a salad that was lightly dressed with pizza with very little oil. Now that the covered patio is up, I see no reason why I wouldn't return - and I'll try some pasta and desserts, too.
2020-08-21,5,After taking a bite of my Inferno 12" brick blazed pie, I felt under dressed. That has never happened before. Though I dined alone, I was relishing everything I was enjoying about my pizza as if there was someone with me to agree! Crust on a pizza is so important, and Apulia has a rave worthy recipe! The bite/chew of the crust is so enjoyable. The sause was the perfect balance of tangy and sweet just how I like it, plus the cheese was great quality. I'll leave it to anyone who reads this to choose their toppings, you'll know what the Inferno is dressed with from reading the menu, but we all know the base of a pizza being great is what's important. So over the moon with the pizza, I then decided to enjoy their special yesterday which was a fabulous butter sause ravioli dish, yes singular, one huge scrumptious pasta creation filled with Longoste. I ended with the chocolate nutella gelato to satiate my sweet tooth. I left there feeling like I was underdressed because the staff was attentive and accommodating, making sure I was comfortable, and that I always had my water filled, royal treatment. I didn't see any woman on staff so keep up the good work gentleman!
2020-08-18,5,I had been here once before and I loved it then. Just came  back today and loved it even more. I live in Weehawken and everyone raves about Porto, let me tell you something - this place is 5x better than Porto. All their pizza is delicious, so authentic. It's like being in Florence. Super thin crust and delicious flavors. You need to check it out for yourself. Highly recommend it.
2020-07-15,5,Just ordered here for the first time via Grubhub I got the margherita pizza with olives. 10/10 will 1000% be my new go-to! Delicious pizza a MUST try, you won't be disappointed!
2020-07-08,5,Great Italian byob restaurant with the most adorable back patio and excellent service. You can't go wrong with their DOP pizza or bruschetta. I am also shocked at how amazing their salads are!! Highly recommend
2020-06-28,4,This was my first visit to Apulia as it's still relatively new to the Hoboken food scene. I'm always excited to try a new pizza spot even though Hoboken has a ton. When my two friends and I arrived, we were seated relatively promptly - I did make a reservation. I'm writing this during the time of outdoor only dining so I would 100% recommend making a rez. We were seated in the cute and cozy back patio. Tables were comfortably far apart and the staff was very kind. The only negative is that since the walls around are so high, there is pretty much No breeze - it was quite hot even at 8pm. As for the food, I thought it was solid. I would compare this pizza to Dozzino if you are familiar with Hoboken pizza spots. Everything was tasty and the portions were worth it for the price. The best thing was that no one rushed us out. My friends and I sat for a few hours and never did we feel pressured to leave. Overall, another good addition to Hoboken.
2020-05-20,5,This place is such an exciting addition to the food scene in Hoboken. Ordered pickup for 2 pies: Caprina and Diavola. Both were beyond delicious. Diavola was similar to Pepperoni; I loved the spices and flavor on it. Caprina with its slivers of goat cheese was sweetish but delightful. Friendly service as well. Excellent stuff overall.
2020-03-19,5,Favorite pizza in uptown Hoboken! The Murgese Pizza is def one of my favorites and hasn't disappointed. Staff has always been friendly too :)
2020-03-08,5,Awesome pizza, great atmosphere.  The vegetariana pizza is perfect and Frank can carry on a good discussion on music.
2020-02-23,5,The best cacio and pepe I had in the US since I am living here in the States! For real you cannot go wrong choosing Apulia when in Hoboken! Trust the Italian!
2020-01-12,1,Had a really bad dinner date night due to the staff at this restaurant. Ordered prosciutto as an appetizer and it looked like they pulled it out of a package and just placed it on a plate with, by the way, no bread (at an Italian restaurant?) I questioned the size of the sangria pitcher which for the cost of $35 i expected a decent sized pitcher and the waiter had called the head chef from the kitchen and he stormed over to our table with a new bottle of sangria to prove that they had poured the whole bottle into the pitcher. With a nasty facial expression and and attitude told my date and i "i hope this makes you happy" and stormed off. That in fact just ruined my dinner experience at your restaurant, so no, I'm not happy. That is by far the worst i have ever been spoken to any restaurant I am giving my business to. On top of the very rude waiter and chef, our pizza (D.O.P.) was so intermediated and under cooked, as well as the Clams with pasta that looked and tasted like it came out of a Chef Boyardee can. Nothing was good or appetizing about any of it. I have NO idea how this place gets any type of business. For the price and experience I would've preferred ordering Domino's and staying home.
2020-01-04,4,Ambiance is chic , warm and inviting. The wait staff was very friendly and accommodating. The menu is very authentic so be prepared to google some of the ingredients if you are not Italian. The food was really good, healthy portions. It cost $20 each we got 1 pizza and 1 pasta. They are BYOB, just like most pizza / Italian restaurants in Hoboken.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic Italian dishes!
2020-01-01,5,Came here when they first opened and the menu was limited and it was packed with strollers; a year later, my girlfriend dragged me in, I was pleasantly surprised, the food was excellent, cozy and the staff (Ryan) was extremely friendly and helpful.  I will definitely come back again!
2019-12-30,5,Apulia is up there for best Italian in Hoboken.  For the price, you cannot beat it.  I went here a few nights ago with my brother and boyfriend.  We had a reservation but given it's a smaller restaurant, it took a few minutes to clear our table.  Our waiter opened our wine and poured us glasses while we waited (it's BYOB too!).  We had the Oro Puglia and Arugula salad for starters- which I would definitely order again.  We split their specialty calzone, the Inferno pizza, and Cacio de Pepe.  The pizza was crisp, the pasta was al dente, it was overall a PERFECT meal.  Their staff was beyond friendly and truly made the experience that much better.  We had a fine dining experience while paying less than $40 each.   I would recommend this place to anyone.
2019-12-29,5,We had an early dinner there recently with some of our friends. The service was great, everyone was very friendly and helpful and even when the restaurant filled up they still got to us (or asked for few minutes patience when they took order for a larger company next to us). Both the meatball and the octopus appetizer were great and the pizzas were awesome - light, flavorful, right out of the wood-fired oven. Our friends (both were born and raised in Italy) agreed that the pizza was outstanding. We will definitely visit the place again to try some of the other dishes.
2019-12-15,1,WARNING: THEY ADD MONEY TO THE TIP ON YOUR CREDIT CARD.Beware of this establishment. Not only were my girlfriend and I rushed out of this place, but they had the nerve to add some extra to the tip on the receipt. We were in and out of this place for a friday night dinner in 35 minutes, and in the worst way possible. They almost took our plates away while we were still eating.Also, the food was terrible. Their supposed homemade cavatelli did not nearly have the appeal that fresh pasta usually does. Bottom line: Never eat here. When restaurants pull sneaky stuff like stealing money from you, they deserve zero customers.
2019-12-14,2,The tables are so close together that they need to pull out the table all the way for you to sit on one side. Then you are in the middle of two sets of conversation. We had to yell to hear each other through out dinner. So unpleasant.I thought the waiter said "We'll get you some water." I smiled and said thanks and then he sarcastically replied "there was a question in there, what kind of water?" I couldn't hear him it was so loud. And I'm getting attitude and sarcasm because of your poorly designed restaurant designed to maximize profit? Thanks, I'll pass. The waiter's attitude continued through the evening. Slapped down the check at the end without a smile or a thank you. Food was disappointing. Had to ask for bread to go with appetizer, which was prosciutto wrapped baked cheese. The pizza we ordered - which was supposed to have sausage and broccoli rabe - barely had either and was a very small size given the price. Overall disappointing. Maybe apologize for the noise or be pleasant instead of a sarcastic arse? The pizza is not worth the attitude and discomfort. Won't be back and won't recommend to others. If you want friendly service at a byob with good pizza that is a good portion size, I'd try Johnny Pepperonis. I've never been disappointed there.
2019-12-13,5,The best restaurant in uptown Hoboken! Our entire family loves it.
2019-11-26,1,Extemely poor service. The server was not interested in taking our order and we had to wait over 15 minutes, when the restaurant was not even that busy. The entrees came out at different times and were not plated properly. Food was average at best
2019-11-04,1,We sat down at 6:30, ordered at 6:45, started receiving our food 7:00-7:15 and were asked to leave by 7:35. Unbelievably rude waiter and mediocre food. I'll go to Panello's next time.
2019-11-02,5,Ate here again last night- the Pizza is simply AMAZING - light, fresh perfect. The owner and all of his employees are so friendly- and attentive. Even though there was a wait- that grew longer as the night went on we sat down within 10 minutes! We enjoyed a delicious arugula salad perfectly dressed and the DOP pizza-sublime. Crisped on the outside and soft inside -perfection. Dripping with prosciutto carved directly on to it with cherry tomatoes more arugula (umm) and EVOO.  You can bring your own wine but they are starting to offer reasonably priced wines as well. Definitely will be returning- again and again
2019-10-28,5,Chewy crispy crustPremium ingredientsWood-fired awesomeness.
2019-10-08,5,I have been back many times and long overdue for a follow up review. The food is consistently great. The pizza is the main attraction but don't miss out on the various appetizers and the other main courses especially the in house made pastas (and finish up with a gelato and an espresso). It is not just about eating really good food but the experience of the meal-more enjoyable with a group. The staff is friendly, patient and helpful with suggestions. Check out the back patio which adds to the overall ambience. Another plus is that they are BYO but they offer for purchase select wines by the bottle. Once you go you will become a regular.
2019-10-07,5,This restaurant not only left us feeling full but the food was delicious fresh. I really try when eating out to stay away from all the fatty non healthy choices but here even the freshly baked pizza which I never eat was amazing...That leads me to the service friendly attentive and most accommodating...Highly Recommended....All I can say is go....
2019-09-07,4,Burrata saladMargheritaProsciutto w shiitake mushroom and truffle oilSuper friendly staff - witty
2019-09-07,4,Apulia has great food!  We had the grilled vegetables to start.  While delicious they are a bit salty and also served with capers so keep that in mind if you are thinking about ordering them.  We also had the marinara pizza with anchovies which was delicious and the linguini and clams which was very good as well.  Didn't have room for dessert, it was all so good.  The service there was excellent too.
2019-09-03,5,Best pizzas in Hoboken--with delicious and authentic (think more Italian than American-Italian) fare, littles-friendly service, and a beautiful courtyard in the back for outdoor lunches or private events on sunny days. The food is always fresh and now that they have gelato there are about a dozen+ more reasons to return!
2019-08-26,4,Super cute space, especially out back. There a nice lights and lots of tables to enjoy a beautiful evening with pizza. The food was delicious and they were able to accommodate everything we ordered for our dietary restrictions. Overall, the food was very good and I was a huge fan of the crust! Our server was very nice, but it took far too long for our pizzas to come out. The restaurant was busy, but not packed so I don't think the wait time was justified.
2019-08-21,4,I knew what you were thinking, "A new pizza place in Hoboken is the last thing we need", and, initially, I agreed.  However, Apulia's brick oven cooking, backyard dining, and uptown location made it more appealing than many of its competitors.  Plus, it was an addition to the lengthy list of casual, BYO dining establishments in town.  My initial visit with my friend on a Saturday evening incurred a slight wait for a table, but that added time provided a window to run and grab a bottle of wine.  Once we were seated, we enjoyed hearing about the menu from our friendly server and decided to share a few items.We started with the Pulpo e Burrata appetizer - an odd combination of seafood and dairy that worked surprisingly well.  One large octopus tentacle had been charred in the wood-fire oven and was served alongside a red pepper puree and the aforementioned fresh, creamy cheese.  From there, our experience progressed with an indulgence in two pizza pies.  The Apulia was a flavorful combination of mozzarella, capocollo, artichokes, shrimp, garlic, crumbled taralli, extra virgin olive oil, and basil.  The taralli bites were like broken pieces of breadsticks that added a pleasant crunchy texture.  The capocollo and garlic added a contrasting boldness to the lighter artichoke and shrimp flavors.  The Mare Nostro Pizza was a briny pie that brought the flavors of the sea with its toppings of Italian tuna and anchovies, in addition to its other Italian ingredients of Apulian tomatoes, mozzarella, red onion, capers, and extra virgin olive oil.  This aromatic pizza was unique and simply delightful.After such an enjoyable meal, we could not skip a sweet finale and ordered an ice cream parfait of sorts.  The 10 or so ounce glass was filled with Pistachio and Vanilla Ice Cream and topped with a thick layer of crumbled pistachio nuts.  It was a simple, yet tastefully done sundae that was not overly heavy.I had liked my meal so much that I actually wound up going back to the restaurant with my brother and placing almost the exact same order, but minus the dessert.  The food was still tasty on my second trip, but not quite as enjoyable as it had been the first time.  For example, the appetizer burrata seemed like it was starting to turn a bit sour.  Overall, though, Apulia was a terrific new spot to satisfy your Italian food cravings.
2019-08-17,3,Came here for a casual dinner on a Friday night. It was busy with a big mix of people. The servers were friendly but service felt confused and somewhat amateur. We ordered a salad to share and it was okay, not great, underdressed bagged mesclun type leaves, a couple of cherry tomatoes (literally) and some red onion. And then we sat and waited for quite a long time before our pizzas arrived. (It wasn't that they had forgotten our table or anything, everyone was waiting. The table next to ours asked where their food was and was told 'we are really busy' which made me raise my eyebrows - no apology - just a kind of 'what do you expect can't you see there's a lot of customers'.)When the pizzas did arrive they were good and if I were judging Apulia purely on its pizza it would be a four or possibly a five. The crust was thin and crunchy without being tough and the toppings were of high quality, but they could have been made with a bit more care as the distribution of the toppings was very uneven. Also I think that they are overpriced, this is Hoboken, not NYC for goodness sake, and the service and decor here are very rudimentary. The decor is pretty non-existent actually, I felt like I was eating in the back room of a bar. The tableware was very ordinary the table wasn't wiped down before we sat, and there was no condiments or even salt and pepper on the table. Apulia is BYO and it is also pretty noisy. I'm quite happy to drop $60.00 on two pizzas and a salad but the service and atmosphere have to be good as well as the pizza and that simply wasn't the case here.
2019-08-16,5,Ok I've been looking forward to coming here since they've opened since I know the owners chefs operators etc from S.Edigio in Ridgewood. Without any doubt this is the best artisanal "Neapolitan" style pizza and southern Italian food in NYC and NJ.  I challenge anyone with a serious cultured taste to say otherwise.    All about the ingredients and original style (Apulia is on the other coast from Naples but shares the same food roots) and eating culture - natural, whole, best of, in season, made with care and meant to enjoyed with family and friends.  It's not food worship - this is the real deal of living well. Pizza crust has a distinct yeasty taste, a food onto itself.  Made in wood fired oven seared crunch on outside and soft pillow like crumb inside.   You'd love to have this as your table bread let alone pizza base.   Toppings fantastic - again all seasonal, fresh, whole and the vibe here inside and out is like a happy family feast. Tried an excellent pasta with several pizzas - cherry tomatoes EVOO and sea urchin.  Just like in Bari. Maybe better.  Unusual and conventional pizza toppings.  I don't need to weigh or be relative here the 5 stars.  (I usually say a 5 star NJ place is a 3 star in Manhattan) Apulia would be 5 stars in Manhattan, Rome, Bari and New Jersey.
2019-08-10,1,This place was horrendous! The manager/owner is an immature, inconsiderate, stuck up prick! The service was horrible and when I asked for money off of the bill he pulled me aside and spoke to me in such a rude manor I was appalled. Never go and waste your money here! There are plenty of better places to get pizza!
2019-08-10,5,Update:  finally had a chance to get the pizza fresh and hot from the restaurant.  Wow.  Does not disappoint.  This is the best pizza in New England.  And I used to live in New Haven!  Franco and the rest of the staff also seem like awesome people.  Will be back soon! Old Review:  I'm starting with the bad news.  Our pizza showed up stone cold.  Very close to the original time window, which was great.  But cold. The pizza box was cold to the touch and the pizza inside nearly the same.  We had to heat it up in the oven which is a little disappointing when you end up paying 25 bucks per pizza with tax, tip, and delivery fee.  Maybe they need to invest in those delivery bags?   The pizza was delicious, I think the best I've had in the union city/Hoboken/jersey city area, which is why I gave the three stars I'm giving. I guess do yourself a favor and eat there if you want to try it.
2019-08-03,3,I went here with my wife we ordered a salad and two pizzas, the salad was large enough for two and tasty, well dressed etc, we waited for quite a long time for the pizzas to come out however when they did they were excellent I would go as far as to say like Roberta's quality.Downside very child rich and they are allowed to run all over the place this was at 8:30/9:00 on a Friday night.The prices are a bit steep salad was 11 or 12 and the pizzas are 20 so $60 for pizza and a salad seems expensive NYC prices I will go back as the pizza is so good but .....
2019-07-28,3,Pretty good wood burning pizza.   But man, what an attitude! You would think they were a famous restaurant.  It's a upscale pizza joint- nothing more.
2019-07-24,5,The pizzas are amazing! The wait is a bit long (~30mins from ordering to serving), but great food for sure.
2019-07-18,4,I dined at Apulia for the first time last night with a friend.  I live a block away so it's convenient to my apartment but I've never stopped in before since Hoboken is peppered with brick oven BYO spots.  The ambiance of Apulia is very nice.  We sat in the front area, but there is seating in the back and a cute backyard courtyard.  There's very limited seating outside in the front.  Since it was 90+ degrees yesterday and storms came through, we sat inside.  There was one gentleman waiting on the entire restaurant and a few runners.   It was pretty quiet when we got there around 7:30 but more people started coming in once the torrential rain and storms blew through.   Overall, the service was very good.  The waiter was attentive and answered our questions. Brought us plenty of water and ice as needed.    Opened our bottle of wine quickly.For food, we shared the Fragola salad to start.  I liked the strawberries and the salad overall - just wish the chunks of goat cheese were bigger.  For main we shared the Inferno pie.  It was delicious and not to spicy.  Came out very hot - it's not a huge pizza and is good for 2 people max if you are also sharing a starter.  It was cut as 4 large slices.  Since it was still storming out, we decided to order dessert and had the Torta Di Ricotta.   The cheesecake was tasty, and not too dense which is why I like ricotta cheese cake.  Not a huge slice, but good to share and had fresh strawberry, a strawberry syrup and whipped cream on the plate.  From a price standpoint, it is on the pricier side given the actual size of the pizza pie and would say its comparable to a Panello in that regards.   Overall though, I enjoyed my first experience there and would come back again when weather is nice enough to sit in the courtyard.
2019-07-15,5,My friends surprised me by taking me to Apulia bringing our own wine to celebrate my Birthday.  We were seated in the lovely garden. I ordered the bresaola and arugula as an appetizer, then a delicious  margarita pizza.  Two of my friends ordered the roasted octopus appetizer and loved it.  We shared the dessert. Our server, Ryan was very friendly and attentive.  We all had a great relaxing time.  I will definitely go back soon.
2019-07-15,5,Went with another couple. We tried so many things that I can't spell but the food was fantastic.  It's a BYOB and that's fine. Service was good, we ate outside on the back patio. We'll all be back.
2019-07-13,1,Was very disappointed with the restaurant.  We ordered the cheese board - our waiter didn't even tell what each one was. They didn't bring out the bread for the cheese until 15/20 minutes after we got the board.  The salad ordered was too acidic- the lemon was over powering. We were so disappointed with the food that we left after appetizer and went somewhere else.
2019-07-05,5,Not a typical chunky cheese Hoboken pizza place. Pizza is excellent but their Italian food menu items and specials are 5*. An adult restaurant with Great food, service and atmosphere in Uptown Hoboken is long overdue and so gladly welcomed. Doesn't disappoint and Highly recommend!!!
2019-07-05,5,Amazing. Amazing restaurant!!! The food and service is beyond anything in Hoboken. From the decor( yes outside space ) to the pizza to the specials on the menu. Frank co-owner, really cares about what we and others think , and Ryan one of the servers , really is a special person anticipating our needs. Thank you for coming to uptown Hoboken!!
2019-07-03,1,I ordered through seamless but couldn't figure out how to leave a review. The gnocchi is terrible. Absolutely no flavor, rubbery and dry. So disappointed and will definitely not order pasta from here again. $38 for a terrible pasta and Diet Coke. Absurd. If you're craving pasta, order from Bin14 across the street.Also, my apologies it what the orecchiette.
2019-06-28,4,Love this place. They are always packed around dinner time on the weekends so come early. No reservations either. I like trying the different specials they have going on. The apulian burrata was not the best burrata I have had. The inside was creamy but the exterior was a little rubbery. I am a sucker for porchetta so I had to try that. This one is thinly sliced with some sauteed onions. It was pretty good. We also had the grilled octopus that also had good flavor. The pizza however was the star of the show. It has a chewy crust and all the ingredients work. I tried a different one this time called the rustica. Solid pizza all around. The marinara one is on point and it is literally just tomato sauce, crust, and some olive oil.
2019-06-25,5,Had this for take out on Father's Day. The Pizza Inferno was one of the best I've had in my life. Cavatelli pasta was very good. The bag ripped on leaving and some of the food spilled & they replaced everything right away. Will be back for sure. Highly recommend.
2019-06-23,5,We tried Apulia for the first time this Saturday.And everything was delicious from the appetizers to the pizza I'm a big fan of Neapolitan Pizza.. this is one of the best I had.. you can see they use fresh and authentic ingredients. It's definitely the best Neapolitan Pizza In HOBOKEN.. believe me I tried them all.. this place reminds me so much of Ribalta in New York City.. the chef comes from Italy.. great job! Definitely will come back!!
2019-06-15,2,Attempted to go here in a Friday night with a group of friends. Upon entry, we witnessed a man asking for the manager because he has been waiting for his food for over an hour. Not too long after, another person had a similar complaint. After about 10 minutes we finally were able to ask about the wait & and we're told around 20 minutes. We were fine with the initial wait considering it was a Friday night. However, about five minutes past and the manager came up to our group and said repeatedly it's going to be 30 minutes over and over again. Essentially telling our group we need to leave the restaurant. This left a horrible taste in our mouths and we immediately left the restaurant and decided to go elsewhere. I do not recommend going here on a busy night, extremely slow and rude service.
2019-06-05,1,The portions are complete robbery .. I have to order pizza from another place after .. spent 60$ for 2 people and not nearly enough food
2019-05-27,4,Great neapolitan style pizzas here.  Margherita was solid and the prosciutto arugula was also fantastic.  Good affocato.  BYOB
2019-05-23,5,Simply perfect cuisine. We started with the octopus which was of a lovely texture. Not too chewy not too tender.  Pasta with mussels and salad with fresh seared tuna were also top-notch.  Very attentive service. We will certainly be back.
2019-05-16,5,Ok. I'm going to say it. As far as food goes... it's currently the best Italian restaurant in Hoboken. We started off by just ordering pizza delivery. I remember thinking "really.. another pizza spot in Hoboken" but damn, they know what they are doing. I'm transported to Italy with every bite. Someone on here said the eggplant didn't have enough cheese haaaaaa. Girl, you haven't been to Italy then. They don't drown their eggplant in mozzarella like the east coast 7th generation Italians do. The food here is sophisticated. I was so excited to take my parents (from Italy) here as well. They loved it. Every course refined. If you see the octopus carpaccio as a special, you have to order it. I had never had it in a carpaccio style, melts in your mouth. Great personable service. I will be back and back and back. Don't you dare move back to Italy!
2019-05-16,5,I've been here a number of times. The food is always consistently excellent. And the service is also great. Big Fan
2019-05-04,4,Yeah- really good  Not your football watching pizza place as the saying goes but good specialty pizza.BYOB- BTW  3 people had 3 pizzas and that was good. Small place waited about 25 minutes Saturday night around 7:30. I am not a huge thin crispy crust pizza guy so I was very pleased that although the base of the crust was kinda crispy, the outer ring was a little doughy  Like a bialy (if you can relate). Appetizers did not blow us away so we skipped.Had Inferno pizza (don't worry far from it) but very tasty with spicy soppressata   We had D.O P  with prosciutto and different cheeses almost classic and very enjoyable. We also had Murgese pizza prosciutto shitake mushrooms and truffle pecorino cheese.  They had some specials and pastas that I would imagine were good. Good customer service, friendly waiter.
2019-04-18,4,Great neighborhood spot for fresh yummy pizza. BYOB and decent services. No reservation and it can get busy so head over earlier.
2019-04-18,5,Really wonderful pizza in Hoboken, much better than most other places in Hoboken for delivery
2019-03-31,1,I'm very confused about the rave reviews on here for this restaurant.  My best friend and I went here on a random Wednesday night and ordered the following:Eggplant Parmesan for appetizer:  barely any cheese on this-- wasn't that good at all.  1/5 We then got the apulia with the shrimp: don't get this not good. Inferno: this was better than the apulia pizza but nothing spectacular. Super disappointed  and was really looking forward to this place.  My biggest tip is to go to zero Otto uno for the best pizza in Hoboken.  This place doesn't compare unfortunately ....
2019-03-22,3,Lovely pizza lovely salad but seamless deliver shows up limp and cold. Put the pizza in a warmer when you are delivering! Cmon!!!!
2019-03-21,5,Delivery was fast.  Pizza was hot.  Large selection of pizzas.  Pasta selection is a little subpar.
2019-03-19,5,Great new pizza(and more) in this little cozy place I. The corner of Washington and 14th St. Food is definitely authentic southern Italian(Palermo) some of the dishes are exclusively from there. Great salad and Pizza. And it's a BYO.
2019-03-15,5,My wife and I ate here tonight for the first time and absolutely loved it. We will definitely be returning to try the other pies, as I think it could have the best pizza in town if you enjoy Neapolitan style.  Service was great and staff was friendly. Highly recommend!
2019-03-08,5,Best pizza in hoboken. The place is beautiful, service is excellent, and the place is amazing food (not just pizza)! Can't wait to go back esp when the back patio opens. If you haven't been here yet or gotten take out, def put this on add this to your list now
2019-02-28,5,Excellent fresh pizza and great salad! Service is great and a very clean restaurant. Owner is on premise and extremely attentive. Staff is happy an the vibe is great! My new fav place in Hoboken!!
2019-02-24,5,Ate here on Friday night with a coworker. It was my first time. Its byob so I picked up 2 bottles of chianti... its my go to wine and taste the best with pizza and pasta red sauce and meats. The server recommended the soppressata pizza and it was soo good, full of flavor. The prosciutto pizza we also had and that was nearly just as good. We also had a cavatelli with ragu sauce. I was pleased with everything i had. Being italian they did a job well done and would recommend this to others.
2019-02-23,5,Ordered delivery and got the Inferno Pizza. It may very well be one of the best pizzas I've ever had! A little pricey for the size but for the quality you can't complain.
2019-02-23,4,I love Neapolitan style pizza so when I heard Apulia was opening, I had to give it a try. We went to Apulia on weekday night so we didn't have to wait for a table. The restaurant is very nice inside with the focal point being the large oven where the pizza was being prepared. We were seated at a table near the oven which was fun because we could see the pizza making process. Additionally, our servers were friendly, helpful, and attentive. We ordered the eggplant parmesan and the inferno pizza. Both were very good. The eggplant parmesan was stacked with layers of cheese between and covered in sauce. This made it a very cheesy/saucy dish, which I loved, but could see being a bit much for people who are looking for an eggplant parmesan where the is the eggplant star. The inferno pizza was great. It was piping hot with the perfect chewy and slightly charred Neapolitan crust. It was spicy but not overwhelming and overall I was really happy with what we ordered. Can't wait to come back.
2019-02-15,5,Finally a place in Hoboken where you actually feel like you're in Manhattan! Great food, amazing service and the specials are unreal!! Worth checking out if you're around the area.
2019-02-15,5,We went on Valentine's Day & it was absolutely lovely . There are no reservations , so just walk in with your bottle of wine :) the food was fantastic , very authentic & delicious . The service was excellent . Very reasonably priced . Def worth an evening out !!
2019-02-09,5,As authentic Italian goes, Apulia ranks up amongst the best in New Jersey! Superb vibe, great hard working staff and importantly for me commendable interpersonal skills! Apulia know their niche and perfect that niche! BYOB adds to the flavor! Will be returning for the 10th time!
2019-02-08,5,Best BYOB in Hoboken hands down. Fun, high energy environment. Open kitchen, blocks of fresh prosciut on the meat slicer and pizza oven humming puts you in the action. Service is top notch, attentive, and accomodating. Amazing family owned, personable local restaurant feel that makes the Hoboken Restaurant scene what it is. Local wine stores 1 block away make the amazing food experience very affordable. My new go to place!!
2019-02-08,5,Not only is this THE pizza spot in Hoboken, it is also the best service out of any restaurant we have been to, and we go to a lot of restaurants. The pizza, apps, salads, are all DELICIOUS. Ryan, Frank, Brian are all amazing. This is our new go to place. There really is no other place we will go to for pizza from now. And they deliver!!!
2019-02-08,5,The only thing better than the food is the service. Everyone is amazing, waited on us hand and foot. Food is incredible. Highly recommend the muscles, prosciutto, octopus, and the hot pepperoni pizza. Ask for frank or brian, they'll take care of you.
2019-01-30,1,We ordered the eggplant appetizer special with prosciutto and ricotta. It was delicious, but very small portion (3 tiny pieces) and expensive for the small portion size. The inferno pizza is highly rated but underwhelming. There are a lot of pizza places in Hoboken that I would prefer over this one. The environment is nice though and BYO is a plus. The food was too pricey and not great so I will not be returning
2019-01-27,5,These guys really get it. Eating at Apulia is like being with family. Frank, the owner, wants to build his business organically which is so refreshing. If you have lived Hoboken for 15+ years you will really appreciate all of the vibes at Apulia. It's old school mentality for the next generation of restaurant entrepreneurs. Now onto the food - pizza is real deal with amazing sauce and cooked to perfection. Cavatelli is handmade on premises and delicious. To start we had the arugula salad and the octopus which were both amazing. Everything is made with love between Frank and his chef. These guys care about every detail of their restaurant. Get to Apulia and welcome them to the neighborhood. Love this place !!!
2019-01-26,5,This newly opened restaurant has the excellent Neapolitan pizza and authentic southern Italian small plates from the Puglia regiFor appetizers we had the mussels, swordfish, braciole, and the octopus. All were excellent. We also had several pizzas. My favorite is the Inferno. Back again today for lunch. Inferno pizza is the best I ever had. They explained that the Baresa style is different than Neapolitan as it is crisp, light and not doughy. I went to Razza last week which was also great. However, Apia is my favorite.
2019-01-26,5,Incredible pizza.  Have no idea how they make a thin pizza that is not soggy. Must try the speck as an appetizer.   I must try. Go during the week to avoid the crowds   BYOB
2019-01-20,5,This review is for delivery only.  The pizza here is on point.  Ordered a few margarita pies and they were delicious.  Can't wait to try the others!
2019-01-19,4,I like to try new places and Apulia was one of them. I had The marguerita pizza and my husband the truffle pecorino.Both of them were really good, nice and light tomato sauce without those strange spices, nice layer of cheese and topping. The crust is similar to real Italian pizza and not pizza pan, so if you want a traditional Italian pizza this is the place.Love it!
2019-01-15,5,I am back, as I noticed that I mistakenly clicked on 4 stars instead of 5.  This restaurant is definitely a 5 star rating.  So much so, that I had to come back and update my review.  And I had to take the time out to read HOW to do that, as it was that important to me!
2019-01-15,3,Dining room and service were quite good.   Nothing super special but nothing bad either.   I just don't like the value on the pizza.   It's good pizza with thin crust and good quality ingredients but the pizzas are 4 slice personal pies for $18+ Each..   3 of us ate 1 pizza each for lunch and after tip and tax it was $68.  Wow.   Hoboken has a ton of pizza places and I am just not sure this price point remains viable.
2019-01-14,5,LOVE THIS GREAT HOBOKEN UPTOWN SPOT! * Great salads! Ask for the brick oven grilled chicken on top! * Delicious brick oven pizzas! * Prosciutto and fresh Moz are on point! * BYOB & convenient wine shops only 1 block away. * ask from Frank!
2019-01-14,1,The atmosphere is nice and I really wanted to like it.  However, the service was awful when we went and the food was only mediocre.  It took over 20 minutes after we sat before I actually got up myself to go get a menu since nobody brought us one.  Another 30 minutes later before we had to flag someone down to finally come speak to us and take our order.  I don't think it should take over 45 minutes to get someone at a supposedly nice restaurant to acknowledge your existence and speak to you especially after you've been already seated.  I wanted to walk out at the point because I was so thirsty (of course no water in addition to no menus) and so annoyed.  Finally my boyfriend was able to get the attention of a server who made some hand signal that I assume means wait since it was another 10 minutes when he finally did come by.  There was no apology or anything and the pizza and appetizers we had were only so-so.  Despite being so close to our apartment building we will definitely not be coming back nor recommending it to any of our friends.
2019-01-14,4,Great new pizza place in Hoboken! They offer various wood fired pizzas, pastas and salads. We got the Fresca and the inferno pizzas. Both were great, however contrary to the name, the inferno pizza was not spicy! The servers were accommodating and kind. We met the owner who was very friendly and let us finish our wine even though it was closing time. FYI it's BYOB! Would definitely come back!
2019-01-12,3,Finally got around to trying the new spot Apulia.  Overall, place had a good atmosphere and is really nice, definetly a great addition to uptown Hoboken. It's also byob which is a huge plus. It was very crowded with about a 45 minute wait, they need a more formal and better process with a host to monitor the lines and provide updates.  Once we got seated, they were out of a few of the items on menu and the menu is very limited outside of pizza. We ordered mussels, 2 pizzas then entrees. From service perspective and timing they need huge improvements. The mussels came first and were deliscious (only had one cherry tomato tho - needed more), then the 2 pizzas came out with good timing after mussels, but literally after one bite of pizza entrees came out. This was awful delivery for a nice restaurant.  The entrees were good but way over priced for what it was. The gnocchi pesto was basically just tiny balls of gnocchi And sauce, could use some other things if going to charge 22 for few bites of pasta and sauce. Menu could be enhanced also.   Lastly, the bus boys kept trying to take out plates when we were still eating as if they were trying to turn our table over.Overall food was good but not great, service and organization needs sig. improvement, and menu could be enhanced. I'll def be back especially when the patio is open in summer. Zero Otto uno a new spot on 5th m wash is same origin of food and is also new is much much better in comparison and service is top notch.
2019-01-04,5,Pizza perfection.  Made the right way.  Excellent Service. Only Italians would ask you if you want an espresso before you eat... yes please.  And then after of course. Margherita was spectacular and the mozzarella was definitely aged to perfection.  I haven't had a pizza like this in a while.
2018-12-31,5,Brand new place in Hoboken, so good! Went with a group of people, so good for larger parties or just for two. Food was so tasty and came out quick! Run very well considering it is a new place. Will definitely return and want to try more items on the menu. Went on a Saturday night, walked in and the place was full, go now before it get's super popular and too packed to go to!
2018-12-23,5,Besides wonderful food (the pulpo e burrata and the margherita pizza were fantastic, and I'd be remiss if I did not mention the fabulous espresso machine), the owner and his best friend are an absolute delight. I no longer live in the area and the holidays have been tough but these 2 reminded me what it's like to be home. I cannot thank them enough for their company, comic relief, and healthy Cowboys v. Giants rivalry. Truly a delightful new spot and I wish you many more "weeks" of prosperity! :)
2018-12-22,5,Really enjoyed our first meal at Apulia.  The ambiance gives off a very cozy feel.  The octopus was delicious and the pizza was excellent, especially the consistency of the dough.   Great, friendly and fast service.  We'll definitely be back.
2018-12-21,5,Round 2 for me: The Apulia pizza is sooooooo fire!!! It's the one with shrimp and speck! The salty charcuterie right off the slicer combined with fresh shrimp and garlic is unreal! Espresso is amazing as well. Highly recommend this place. Perfect service execution & savory options all over the menu. Keep it up Apulia!
2018-12-20,5,Great place.  Second time here and awesome food, service and people.  We had a couple of pasta dishes and two pizzas.  Inferno is our favorite.  Gr8 place and byob as well tops it off.
2018-12-19,3,Very good restaurant. Pizza crust was very traditional and delicious. However, I was surprised with how delicious the pasta and mussels were!
2018-12-16,5,Great pizza with phenomenal service.We dropped in on a Saturday at 6:30 with an infant AND a toddler expecting to be told we needed a reservation. Not only did they seat us right away, but they put us at a great table in the back.Since it's BYOB, the waiter pointed me to a local wine store 1 block away.The white pizza was AWESOME! And highly recommend the pistachio desert.Music was also great. when we asked the name of a song that played, the owner came over to talk to us about the music and how he ended up picking the location.Overall a great, unexpected, night out. Haven't had customer service this great in a long time.Thanks Frank and crew!
2018-12-12,5,Great addition to Hoboken. Frank is fabulous. Tiramisu amazing. Good pizza, salads and pasta.
2018-12-11,5,What a great addition to the city; we went there for a business meal with clients. As you enter the warm of the wood fired pizza oven welcomes you along the friendly owner Frank and staff. We started off with three pizzas and the burratta and octopus appetizer, all excellent. After adding two more home made pasta dishes we finished with great oven roasted Italian coffee and a dessert platter - we will be back. Young and dynamic team, please support them
2018-12-02,4,Yum! Interesting pizza options - we tried 3 different ones and all were very good. No wait - went around 5:30 pm. They are new and admitted they were working on flow. Would definitely go back.
2018-11-30,5,Great new place! Food is great and fresh and the service is very good! We had the inferno pizza and it was awesome. Definitely will be going back often!!
2018-11-29,1,I have never had a more horrible experience at a restaurant. I went to Apulia tonight, the food was decent, the waiter was still training but they showed their true colors when the check came out. I made the mistake of putting my credit card down without looking at the bill and after the card was run. I learned they charged me for a $18 appetizer I did not order nor eat. After finally finding the manager to talk to, I waited at least 15 minutes for someone to come back over to our table. I figured we would be offered a dessert or coffee on the house. When an employee finally came over he did not come over with a refund or solution to the check, but to ask me if I would give up my chair for another table. He had no shame. The owner/manager came back a few minutes later with a revised check and when we asked him how to tip the waiter, he told us not to tip since it was "all the waiters fault". And he did not even refund my card for the full incorrect amount I was charged for. I have worked in multiple restaurants and have never seen one run so poorly.
2018-11-28,2,Uhm it seems like the prior reviews are artificial. It took about the 20min for anybody to take our order.   Another 5min after that to have them open our wine bottle. On top of that, the pizza ordered doesn't compare to Napolis or Brick. Even Urban Coalhouse pizza was a little better. The 2nd star was out of sympathy. FYI, please avoid the tall red-headed waiter.
2018-11-17,5,I went tonight with a friend for the first time and was lucky enough to be seated next to Uncle Sal-uncle to the owner as well as the entire restaurant! His food recommendations were appreciated and his charm was endearing! Hopefully he becomes a fixture at the restaurant as everyone needs an Uncle Sal who is very knowledgeable about the menu       The food was well prepared and unique Italian dishes. The restaurant was appealing and a good atmosphere. I'd recommend it if you are looking for traditional real Italian food prepared well.
2018-11-17,5,Instant fan of this new spot in uptown Hoboken.  The space is redone and looks great inside.  Also a lot of tables along the wall and in the back of the restaurant.  The staff are super friendly, service was definitely a plus.  We had eggplant parm, burrata, and the Inferno pizza.  Every dish is homemade - even the ricotta cheesecake, which was amazing!
2018-11-09,5,Delicious Pizza and appetizers, love the coziness of the place.. will be  back !
2018-10-24,5,I've tried a lot of pizza in my day and this is by far the most delicious and authentic Italian pizza. The staff is great. The chef is incredible. We also tried the orecchiette which is made from scratch and amazing. I can't wait to go back and try more.
