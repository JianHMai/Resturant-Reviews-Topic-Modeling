2021-11-04,5,I love tostis because they make it easy to get a simple breakfast or lunch with a twist. Take for example, their tumeric tuna sandwich. It's yummy, nutritious, and doesn't cost an arm and a leg.
2021-10-30,1,Tried to come here with a group of people in our early 20s for brunch and they would not seat us because all the open tables were "reserved". Then another older group came next to us with no reservation and was seated at one of the many open tables right away. The server was very ageist and kept saying they was no availability when there clearly was.
2021-10-25,5,My main regret about Tosti is that I didn't make it here sooner. The Spicy Fried Chicken Burger is TO DIE FOR. Not for the faint of heart, it's Korean sauce packs a spicy punch, and for messy eaters (like me), it can cause some unfortunate photo ops (the trick is to slice it around the individual pieces of fried chicken- yes, I recommend eating this with a knife and fork to save the aforementioned sauce and Korean slaw to plop onto your place). My girlfriend had the turkey BLT which was very nice with sliced turkey breast (not deli slices). The menu has always intrigued me, and I would come to try breakfast or a myriad assortment of their tacos, sandwiches and salads. But I will CERTAINLY be coming back for that spicy saucy crunchy goodness that is the Spicy Chicken Burger.
2021-10-24,2,I've been to this establishment multiple times, even ordered food for pick up. Today I went with both my daughters, 2 and 5 years old, my eldest ordered the Tosti pancakes, took one bite and wanted nothing to do with it, my youngest didn't neither. I ordered a sandwich for myself and only ate half and ordered a box just for my other half of sandwich, told the waitress my kids didn't like the pancakes and wasn't offered a substitute. I got charged full price for pancakes that my kids found unappetizing.
2021-10-23,1,Had farmers plate and avocado Benedict.(Sigh) Where do I start...1. Gravy tasted like Campbell's canned soup or something. Def not special. Very strange tasting gravy.2. Biscuits...oh no oh no oh no no no no no. Dry and tasteless. I wouldn't even call it a biscuit.3. Avocado Benedict...what made me open up the yelp app and write this review. Soggy and tasteless. Just NO.I am very confused with high rating of this place.I suspect the ownership / chef changed recently? Idk. This was my first time here and there won't be a second time.Conclusion: Food quality was something I would get at an airport waiting for my next flight.Price was average.Waitress was attentive and nice.Plenty of outdoor seating.Food came out fast.
2021-10-14,5,Tosti is such a good go-to. The food is good, the little outdoor space is adorable and the staff is so nice. It's also dog friendly outdoors. Get the salmon bowl!
2021-09-10,5,Thier dinner food is UNDER RATED!! I split the salmon, shrimp tacos, and veggie quesadilla with my GF and WOW. Everything was 10/10. Would recommend to a friend!
2021-09-10,5,The best brunch place! SO many drink options and the food is always so tasty! Highly recommend Tosti for breakfast or lunch!!!!
2021-09-07,5,One of the best cafe in Hoboken.1) Their chai latte is out of this world.2) Their mocha latte is also excellent.3) Had their avocado toast, because I never had it. It was great, but I understand why every other generation laughs at millennials for spending 13 bucks on bread with avocado that doesn't even fill you up. 4) The ambiance of this place is very nice.
2021-08-31,5,For the third time we went for lunch and had really good food. Service is excellent, friendly and quick. Menu has great choices: eggs, salads, sandwiches. Today I had a TBLT (a BLT with sliced turkey), on multigrain toast, with chipotle mayo, which was delicious. Brandin had pancakes, which he loved. Laura thought her burger was perfectly cooked. My iced coffee was superb. All around great meal. Highly recommended.
2021-08-20,4,Love the vibe here. Very quiet with light music in the background.Great place for work meeting.Coffee was okCroque madame was delicious.  Very few places Make it well.The good is all fresh and made to orderService is quick and kindStreet parkingBathroom cleanCredit card okDef will return
2021-08-19,4,This is yummy for your tell me the service the people that location and the food is excellent would not recommend you to go anywhere else other than toasty cafeÃÅ and kitcken
2021-08-11,5,Great little cafe - service is warm and food is super solid. The TBLT and tuna sandwich are all really great. Would totally recommend if you're looking for a quick lunch and/or coffee.
2021-08-06,5,Always a staple in our routine for a reason. Great food! Service is great and it is kid friendly. Never have had a bad experience.
2021-08-02,2,Presentation was nice. Chicken sandwich is boneless dark meat pieces, not a fan. The sauce and coleslaw was very good.
2021-07-28,5,My parents went here for breakfast while they were in Weehawken. They absolutely loved this restaurant! Very quant and relaxing. Gabby was a great waitress! It's a little on the expensive side if you're getting a full meal, but you can get a smaller breakfast by ordering sides. Also, great tea presentation!
2021-07-20,5,This is our go to breakfast place. The Tosti breakfast sandwich never disappoint with perfectly cooked eggs, the slightly spicy sauce and a soft Brioche bun. If your hungry try the Fried Chicken and Waffle.
2021-07-11,4,Hi ! I'll start by saying this is my favorite brunch place in town. 4 out of 5 Stars. Let me break it down:- Food. Solid 4+ Stars. Food is reliable great. It is one step below fantastic. Can't quite tell you why, but when you eat Fantastic you know it. You do know that whatever you order, it will be delicious and well worth coming here for.- Service - 3 Stars. My server today was a typical 'fire and forget'.  Takes your order, forgets the extra you asked for, and seldom shows up afterwards. Here is where I need to give a plug for Mina, the bus boy. 5+ Stars. He makes up for any shortfall in the wait staff service. - Ambiance - 4 Stars. Truly pleasant surroundings, lovely music playing inside. Acoustics inside can be challenging at certain tables, but fine at most. I can't emphasize how much I like this place. I'll remind my readers that I reserve 5 Stars for a truly epic experience, and these 4 Stars are well earned and means this is a Great place to go for a brunch. A note on their weekday menu (bunch-esque, not lunch). The foods I enjoy on the weekend are usually not available during the week, and I do I have less experience with their week lunch menu.
2021-07-03,5,This place has the best service in Hoboken, hands down. Food is also consistently good, portions are normal, coffee is bomb... highly highly recommend. A nice refreshing break from other Hoboken restaurants that keep you waiting forever just to get a drink order! 10/10
2021-06-25,5,Great cafe! Good Menu!The service was great and it was very nice to be able to sit outside!
2021-06-18,5,Staff here are incredible, food is delicious, gotta be one of my favorite brunch spots- never a miss
2021-06-14,5,The service was great and the staff was very friendly! Food was amazing! We ordered the guacamole and chips and the salmon bowl as well as the Santa Fe Bowl!
2021-06-10,2,The avocado toast with a side of bacon is a great breakfast or brunch choice, but the manager with black hair was really disruptive. She was constantly yelling and nagging at the servers and it really ruined the mood. It was really unprofessional of her to do so openly and a little disconcerting how often she was doing it. I would've given it a better rating because the food isn't the worst, but that manager totally ruined the experience. Might not come back if she's working that day.
2021-06-10,5,Came here with a friend's recommendation, and she was right. I loved it. The vibe was great. The Bulgogi roll was amazing. Would definitely come back again :)
2021-06-07,5,The best!!! Service is always great, kale salad with grilled chicken is my favorite. Chicken quesadilla and the southwest/Mexican bowl are also amazing Turkey sandwich was great too!
2021-06-06,5,had a party of 5 today 6/6 around noon & got seated immediately indoors (thank god cause it was HOT). our server was incredibly spunky & gave great confirmation on our order choices. i has the beet juice which was SO GOOD. amazing actually. and i made my own omelette with avocado, provolone & bacon - it was huge. it was delicious. we will we back.
2021-06-01,5,We ordered guac chips and portobello sandwich, both are great. Love their outdoor decor too. Nothing feels better than a chilling night sitting outdoor with some tasting food!
2021-06-01,5,Tosti is very nice beautiful place. Interesting menu and great service. I highly recommend
2021-05-25,5,Great outdoor area with a shaded area with really nice servers!! Great menu too! Chips and guacamole are awesome!!
2021-05-23,5,Great Brunch!!! Great food and even better waitress!! Linda is super awesome!!! So happy and uplifting!  Really went above and beyond to make sure it was a great meal !
2021-05-19,5,Good quality food for a decent price. Menu has a good variety and offers many different selections. Also has BYOB for dinner services.
2021-05-15,5,Has become my go-to brunch spot in Hoboken! I recently started dining at restaurants again and felt very comfortable here in terms of their safety measures.  The service is also great-Both  times my waitresses were very friendly and helpful. There menu is extensive and so far I've tried the kale salad and tuna salad on croissant. Both were delicious and I cannot wait to try more!
2021-05-11,5,One of our go to places. Brunch, salads, sandwiches - all great options. We've never had a bad meal here, whether takeout or dine in. They've done a great job with outdoor seating during COVID, too.
2021-04-18,3,Cute little cafe, but our Sunday brunch had execution and cleanliness issues. Service was not attentive and hurried/transactional. The smoked salmon plate was just okay and served with toast (why no bagel?) and lacking the extra creme fraiche I requested. The table was sticky, the first silverware set-up had an obviously dirty knife, and a server/runner touched a straw in our unfinished iced coffee. Will not return.
2021-04-16,4,Not the best eggs benedict I've had, but the croissant was amazing. Cute little place with a nice vibe to it.
2021-03-16,3,Used to be such a fan of this place but I don't know if they have switched managers or something because they have been messing up every order. They forgot to include part of my order. I called to report and the manager was supposed to call me back - nothing happened. My bf the very next day picked up a sandwich from them and they made the wrong sandwich.Again, I don't know if there is something going on with the management that they are not check the orders going out but it's a shame because I used to order from them all the time and I am very hesitant to order again.
2021-02-16,5,Great place to eat, good atmosphere and good service. The food is simple but incredibly tasty. The French toast is bang!!!! French fries with the dipping sauce also is Bang!!! You can't go wrong with this small breakfast spot, it's on point.
2021-02-13,5,Always a great dinimg experience. Delicious for brunch and lunches. Soups are so good, love their portabello sandwich, toasted bread is so good. Really great little spot for lunch or brunch.
2020-12-30,5,Any problems Tosti had in getting off the ground are totally resolved. This has become my favorite local eatery, and friends and I care so much about the owners that we eat and order out from here as much as possible during this Covid crisis. They also have great gluten-free and vegan options, and the menu is always evolving in creative and delicious ways. No complaints at all. It's fantastic.
2020-11-15,5,With the recent warm fall weather, Tosti became a go to work from home space the past few weeks. The safe is always super great with the safety protocols when I've been here. You'll notice they're all wearing masks and providing hand sanitizer upon arrival. The tables are a good distant from each other and most seating is offered outside. If the weather starts cooling down, I'd recommend taking a jacket! An important thing to know is, they serve breakfast all day until 4! The menu notes anything from omelets to grain bowls, to tiramisu for dessert! I personally love the selection of teas and tea lattes they have. The vanilla chai tea latte is one of my go-to choices. If you're there for lunch, the Kale or Caesar salads with chicken are generous portions. WiFi is available so if you're looking for a new work spaces, this just might be it.
2020-10-25,4,Cute little breakfast spot in Hoboken. A lot of outdoor seating which was nice. I was disappointed that my hot macchiato came pretty much room temperature, had to send it back and ask for a new one. The waffle was very big and filling. Very sweet, not your traditional waffle. The omelet was pretty good. Service was excellent.
2020-10-15,5,This is absolutely the best restaurant around hands down. Everything on their menu is delicious. Such variety, quality, and care. I would recommend this place to everyone, a must try! Also, the waiters are great! Thank you for your service, please don't change!
2020-10-10,3,Nothing to wow me! I was by the waterfront with my family and stumbled across this place. The food was not impressive at all
2020-08-30,3,Cute cafe on Washington St. I only stopped here for a drink. I had their hibiscus tea which was very refreshing. They have a good amount of outdoor seating. Their menu looked good. I'd try them again.
2020-08-28,5,Quick service, clean outdoor seating and good tasting food. Love the patio grass space and tent they set up to respect covid 19 guidelines. Coffee was flavored well but not strong. Waters were constantly refilled and made the experience better on a hot summer day
2020-08-25,5,Amazing spot for food in Hoboken! You can't really go wrong with anything on the menu here. I've had many of the vegetarian and non-veg options and they are all great! I would recommend the Smoked Salmon Toast, Chicken Sandwich, Portobello Sandwich, and the Omelet Bar
2020-08-20,5,Love this place! Always come here for brunch the eggs Benedict and Tosti sandwich are amazing. Love there coffee and chai teas too!
2020-08-17,5,Hands down best pancakes I've ever had!! The steak in the Santa Fe Bowl was prefect and the smoothies were great. Literally no complaints. Staff was friendly and outdoor ambience was nice. One of the best brunch spots here in Hoboken, will definitely be coming back.
2020-08-14,5,Great service. I love how my friends and I were able to enjoy the delicious food and catch up.
2020-08-13,2,We decided to give them a try.  I got the avocado toast, which I loved.  My husband had the bad luck on our order today. He got the Croque Madame and we wanted to try the biscuits.  Biscuits were dry and hard.  The croque was cold and did not fare well during the delivery process.  It took an hour and 15 minutes to get delivered.
2020-07-18,4,Delicious breakfast (Country Breakfast and French Toast) and the staff was friendly. We were there at 10am and have waited for few minutes before sitting. During the waiting they've given us the menu in order to choose our breakfast in advance. Even the iced coffee was delicious!
2020-07-13,5,We came across this little cafe by chance and now we are Hooked...Best breakfast/lunch place...delicious & fresh food! The service is great and the outdoor setup because of covid is cozy with tens and fake grass. My new fav place!!!
2020-04-16,5,Have dined in and ordered takeout from Tosti. Food has been consistently fresh and flavorful. Their turmeric tuna is delicious! So are their fish tacos! Oh and they have really good guac:)
2020-04-08,1,Tosti is a nice place and we come all the way from Jersey City and are regular loyal customers that keep coming back so it was shocking today when we wanted to order the avocado toast today minus the sunny side egg because I am a vegan. They refused to take the cost off the egg or change the order expecting us to pay 12$ for 1 avocado toast. You lost a customer today Tosti! All this good business has given you an attitude and you will not survive in the long run!
2020-03-05,5,Lovely and cozy, but also spacious cafe with friendly staff!  Had a great latte and got my work done on a Thursday afternoon. Really liked the vibe and the menu was reasonably priced with good options. Will come next time for lunch!
2020-03-02,5,This place has probably some of the best omelets in Hoboken. I got an egg white omelet with asparagus, spinach, tomatoes, onions, mozzarella, and cheddar and all of the veggies were cooked into it. I know that sounds like a duh, but a handful of restaurants don't do that.
2020-02-20,4,Great breakfast/brunch spot for a reasonable price. Perfect if you don't feel like dropping $30+/head on a boozy brunch. Nice selection of reasonably healthy breakfast options, as well as a handful of Gluten Free and Vegan options if you're into that sort of thing. Good coffee and espresso drinks to pair with meals and the staff is generally very friendly. I'm fairly certain they don't take reservations but it's ok because tables seem to turn over quickly.
2020-02-18,4,Came here for lunch and it's a great addition to Hoboken - some of the seating was weird but not a big deal just a small wait. The Mac and cheese was so yum! Service was decent. It's byob which is also great - nice to have some more casual spots in the city
2020-02-17,3,Tosti is a new-ish breakfast/lunch/cafe in hoboken. We have been a handful of times and its always consistently okay. food feedback: the food and menu are simple, but limited. my go to order is usually eggs benedict but i've had the beet salad as well as the build your own omelette. the eggs benedict is by the far best of those options. the omelette was lacking flavor despite having bacon, goat cheese, and spinach in it. the salad had odd ingredients not typical to a beet salad. the food rarely arrives hot. beverages feedback: the hot lattes and coffees are their best feature. the vanilla chai latte is SO SO SO yummy. highly recommend it. we often bring prosecco/champagne and get orange juice. they only have one size for the orange juice and its not fresh.. but, it does the job.service feedback: the servers are super nice and attentive. especially their weekend staff. they are delightful!
2020-02-17,5,I love this place so much! I started coming here when I saw the chai options because I love chai. Their food is also amazing. The whole mood is relaxing and sweet. The service is great. Never a long wait time to be seated and food is brought out very quickly. Highly reccomend.
2020-02-08,4,Went there today and had the hummus salad and my friend had the steak and eggs.  Great food, loved the atmosphere and their layout.  Will definitely let go there again!! I recommend it!
2020-02-08,3,#Tosti is a cute little cafe that offers breakfast and lunch. I have visited twice but I have to say my lunch experience was much better (food wise). My breakfast platter was lacking in flavor, the food was on the colder side, and I remember thinking " I won't be returning". But I gave Tosti another try for lunch. I was a fan of their Grilled chicken sandwich (w/ a salad+ avocado). It was delicious and filling. Our server forgot basic things and didn't check on us at all during our stay. I had to call him over to get a refill on water and he managed to forget. The place wasn't busy when we stopped by either.  Overall 3.5 stars.
2020-01-26,4,Tosti is a comfortable place to grab a coffee or lunch. They have a wide menu selection for breakfast and lunch and their sandwiches are great! Will definitely be frequenting this spot more often!
2020-01-24,3,I don't get the reviews of this place. First off, the biscuits are very dry. Coulda used them as a hockey puck.  The steak and eggs were over salted and not the best. The home fries were pretty good but thats about it. The avocado toast was flavorless as well. It seems like they either over-season or under-season. Need to work on that. I wanted to give them another chance but nothing has changed from my first review honestly.Not sure how this place is 4.5 stars on yelp. Don't think I would give it another shot but wishing them the best of luck!
2020-01-18,4,Tasty! Great coffee and tea assortment.. great service too. Got seated within 5 minutes on a Saturday at 12:30.
2020-01-06,4,Tosti is a cute little breakfast spot on Washington, and although it doesn't face as much competition as it used to, there are still plenty of local options to choose from for breakfast or brunch. It gets a little crowded here later in the morning on weekends (after 10am), but there is more seating than initially visible up front and so wait times don't seem terrible for groups of 4 or less. I got hot water to drink since the herbal tea options were virtually non existent, but they were nice and refilled it for me a few times. The huevos rancheros are vegetarian (woohoo!) and the breakfast sandwich is pretty good too. Decent portion sizes, reasonable prices.
2020-01-04,5,Great ambience for all day brunch fare in central Hoboken. Check it out when in the area.
2020-01-04,5,Great brunch spot! Decent prices. Tuna croissant is fantastic. Also love the matcha latte. Nice staff. Never too hard to get table.
2020-01-02,5,Bold statement here... been in Hoboken over a decade and tried a lot of Brunch spots... this might be my new favorite and possibly the best spot in town for Brunch. Good menu, excellent food, nice staff, good coffee, BYOB, not too hard to get a table. New fav!
2019-12-29,5,Excellent breakfast- French toast with warm maple syrup was delicious.  Cute location, friendly staff.  Would recommend.
2019-12-01,5,Have been coming here for brunch and dinner for months and have never had a complaint. Always fresh, delicious, clean. Good service. Fair prices. Menu is not large but has variety and very well "curated" modern American with a Korean touch,  all interesting combos. Some chef really put it together with love. Busy for brunch, stumped that they are not yet as busy for dinner. A great place for dinner!! Byob, a different very affordable menu, all made with love.
2019-11-19,5,The vegan food is amazing. Very happy to see more vegan options on the menu. Service is great and friendly- Mike is a particularly awesome server! Vegan burrito is a great move
2019-11-17,4,Went in for breakfast one morning with my wife.  I had a basic breakfast fried eggs, potatoes, bacon and toast.  Bacon should have been a bit crispier and toast was not warm enough to melt butter but all in all a good meal.
2019-11-16,4,Solid breakfast/brunch spot in Hoboken. We were are party of 2 and got seated immediately at about 10am on a Saturday. There did seem to be a little bit of a wait for others as it got closer to 11. I got the corque monsieur, which was good. I probably wouldn't get it again though. And it was HUGE. I could barely finish half. My husband got the chicken and waffle with some peruvian green sauce. Super good!! We also shared a side of french toast, which were very simple. But that's exactly how I like my french toast, so I loved them.
2019-11-07,5,I come here to work often and the service is exquisite. I love their coffee and everything that I've had on the menu is delicious. Great vibes all around. Thank you Tosti!!
2019-11-03,1,We went to Tosti for brunch to have the chicken waffle and their egg sliders and were extremely disappointed. We are not really overly picky about food but frankly, the breakfast was so bad I felt I had to leave a review. On the plus side, our server was very kind and affable. On the negative side:  the chicken on the waffle was undercooked and consisted of huge chunks of soft, dark meat covered with a thin layer of semi-crispy skin (it was very rubbery); the taste of the chicken left much to be desired, so much that I left nearly the entire chicken off of the waffle; however, the waffle tasted old, was extremely soft and rubbery, and tasted so bad I could only eat 1/4 of it. I am not exaggerating when I say that I have never had a waffle that tasted worse than this one (in fact, I had yet to taste a waffle that I did not at least somewhat enjoy until this one); the maple syrup was bland and I had to ask for another serving just to give the waffle some taste, before I gave up. I wish I could say that this was only one dish, but my wife's egg slides were equally bad (so much so that she only ate one of the the two) - barely any flavor, which we had to greatly enhance by pouring huge quantities of fruit compote.  We both had cappuccinos, which were both average. I have been to a few brunch places in Hoboken that were less than memorable, but I have never been to one that I felt was memorable for the very low quality of the food (which I could not finish). Overall, I don't think this place compares even remotely to any of the many other good brunch spots that Hoboken has to offer.
2019-10-30,5,My absolute go to cafe. The Bulgogi roll with the side salad is a must!! Service is very friendly and food is fantastic!
2019-10-28,5,I only have wonderful things to say about Tosti. I've been here at least a dozen times since it opened, and every time, I've had wonderful service, exemplary food, and an overall noteworthy experience.Though the menu isn't anything out of the ordinary, Tosti does everything well and they don't overcharge for what they do. Want an egg sandwich? Don't expect to pay more than $10. Craving a salad? You can easily get a delicious one here with steak for under $20. Whatever your heart desires, you can find it at Tosti.If you're looking for something unique, I highly recommend the turmeric tuna salad. It comes on a croissant with jam, and it could not be more delicious. For brunch, you can't go wrong with the smoked salmon toast and the make your own omelette. Honestly, everything here is worth writing about! If you haven't already, you won't regret giving Tosti a chance.
2019-10-18,5,Lovely atmosphere!! And friendly service with great food. BYOB makes the trip even more sweet.
2019-10-18,4,What's not to love about a cute new cafe? I've been here a bunch of times to stay and eat in or to just pick up an iced coffee or tea and keep walking about town. All experiences have been wonderful. They have plenty of tables indoors and also free wifi for all you folk that like to buckle down somewhere and get some work done. They also have a bunch of outdoor tables that have been lovely for the summer and we might just get another week or two out of them. (Fingers crossed!!) Most of the times I've been here have just been for coffee or tea. I've gotten everything from just a black coffee to a chai latte to a lavender earl grey iced tea. All fabulous, and decently priced too, surprisingly. The last time I went was for breakfast and I made my own omelette: goat cheese, asparagus, spinach, onions, tomatoes. What some may call the perfect omelette. Came with toast and  butter and was delicious. I also got a side fruit bowl that consisted of bananas, blueberries and strawberries. I didn't see it on the menu but when I asked about a side of fruit they had a few options. I have to come back again soon for lunch because they really got their breakfast figured out, but in the meantime, I'll continue to just stop in for my coffee to go.
2019-10-18,5,Super friendly!! Very attentive staff and a great atmosphere! Food is delicious and the waiter is funny.
2019-10-14,5,The service and the food was great. We ordered salads for dinner that were great and back 2 days later for brunch
2019-10-07,4,I came here for brunch and ordered the Tosti sandwich. It was great but a little small (for $12) and the cafe latte with oat milk (loved this). I feel that maybe if they include a side of potatoes it would be more filling. Someone in our party ordered the Croque Madame (pictured) and she absolutely loved it. The others ordered the Bacon Cheddar sandwich, the Country Breakfast, and the pancakes and everyone seemed to like it, however felt that the proportions were a bit small. All in all, the best value item was the Croque Madame, as the rest of us were hungry again in an hour!
2019-10-04,5,Cute outside seating and a nice menu for breakfast and lunch! Great service as well.... really nice to be able to sit outside during beautiful weather and get some great food!
2019-09-30,5,Tosti is tasty! Great outdoor seating and the inside is even nicer :) really cute and good for all meals. We had Mike as our server. He was super nice and knowledgeable about the menu. Gave good food recs :)
2019-09-30,4,Really enjoyed Tosti Cafe for a sunny Sunday brunch. Nice menu, laid back cafe vibe and lots of different food options and the staff were friendly too. I had the veggie burger which was great and so many fries came with it - bonus points! Would absolutely come back again, especially as it's BYOB!
2019-09-29,5,Me and my wife love this place! The food is so delicious for both sit down service and for food to go. The service is great and really friendly. One of our favorite brunch spots in Hoboken!
2019-09-20,5,Great brunch, excellent service by our server Mike! Awesome healthy options for all times of the day. Highly recommend
2019-09-12,4,Visiting a friend in Hoboken. Cute place to kill some time!Ordered the portobello sandwich and side salad and chips and guacamole. Everything was very fresh!Water came with a fresh slice of lemon - a very nice touch! There are charging outlets at the front bar seating on either side of the window.
2019-09-09,5,This is absolutely the most delicious fresh incredible place in Hoboken!!Don't miss the salmon bowl-bulgogi rolls...tumeric latte is DIVINE.The nicest most helpful patient to staff... just a lovely delicious find!!!
2019-09-08,1,If I could give this 0 stars I would. Last week I went to tosti I ordered the farmers breakfast. The "biscuits" were more of a very dry roll and the gravy was like water. I am very picky about biscuits so I thought I just ordered the wrong thing because everything in all the pictures looks so good, right?!Today I went back. I ordered a Belgian waffle and the person I was with ordered French toast (both side items). My water had a dead gnat in it and was warm because they just have glasses of water sitting in the corner to give you when you come in. We then proceeded to wait for 30 minutes ..... for a piece of toast and a waffle. Now, I was a server for years and I understand the struggles. However, our server never came to us to let us know what was going on. The tables to both sides of us got there after us, ate, paid and left and we were still waiting. I get up to ask someone and they said they would have it right out. Great! I sat back down and waited. 50 minutes later... still no food or server. I went to the counter and told them I would like to pay for my drink and just leave. They did not allow me to do that. Instead they brought an appetizer of fries to my table..... then a man (who I assume is the manager) comes over and told me they were having issues with the waffle maker... yet multiple people around me had been getting waffles.... then our server came up to us and said the kitchen was behind... also a lie because people who came after us had gotten their food and left. Our server finally brought out the food and it was not at all hot and the waffle was so bland. I mean, when continental breakfast at a hotel has a better waffle then your restaurant you should probably just take it off the menu. this place had plenty of chances to make this right, but did not. I'm always very patient and understanding in restaurants because I know what it's like to be a server, but I was absolutely livid. We got our bill and we had been charged for every item... you would think they would at least have taken something off for our wait... wouldn't you? This place is horribly managed. This is not how you treat customers. This place will not last here.
2019-09-05,5,First time trying this restaurant. Amazing service from Bobbi, great food & tacos located right in the middle of Hoboken. A little gem tucked away on Washington street. A must try if you're ever in the area!
2019-09-01,5,My family and I love this place. The food is always great, and the staff is somehow even greater. You can't go wrong with the Korean steak tacos or Korean BBQ steak. You can't really go wrong with anything, actually. Convenient location and very clean restaurant. Can't ask for more than that!!
2019-08-27,4,I've been to Tosti a few times and have enjoyed each experience. The staff is super friendly, there is a nice selection of speciality coffees and with great food. I've had their breakfast sandwich and the combo of egg, caramelized onions, chives and Sriracha mayo is perfection - bursting with flavor and probably one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've had. Most recently I built my own omlete, equally as tasty and with super quick service. They have a good amount of outdoor seating and it's an adorable cafe for meeting a friend or getting some work done inside.
2019-08-27,1,POWDERED EGGS. Really cute place but most of the food is tasteless. Avocado toast is blaaand. Service is kind of clueless. Been there a few times because I live in the area but it gets worse every time. Overpriced for the quality. Honestly you can get better breakfast for half the price at a shitty diner.
2019-08-24,1,The worst experience ever. Wanted to order food to take out while my elderly parents rest at their out door table. We were told that they could not wait there. What sort of rude behavior is this? The server could see my father had leg braces & could not stand for too long. It's not like we decided to take a break on their bench without spending money. Will never give them my business ever. I wish I could give them zero stars!!!!May be a cute place but terrible service!
2019-08-22,4,Cute little cafeÃÅ in uptown Hoboken. Perfect spot to grab brunch or just a cup of coffee.  Portions are generous and staff is friendly. Also love that the drinks come in mason jars- nice touch!
2019-08-20,5,Tosti has the best coffee in town. I always get the black iced coffee with avocado toast and it is great. Being a vegetarian it is hard to find good spots, but they are really great and I highly recommend coming here for brunch or dinner.
2019-08-14,5,Tosti is such a cute cafe with great brunch food and a cool atmosphere. The service is friendly and helpful. We ordered the French toast and home fries which were both scrumptious and were exactly what we needed. Definitely would come here again!
2019-08-13,5,Cute little cafe on Washington street! I had the ramen noodles. Food was delicious and the portions were huge. I saved some of my noodles to indulge in later! Love that! The service was wonderful. My waitress went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable! Great place to sit down and do some work during the day. It's BYOB!
2019-08-11,5,Honestly, I almost never give 5 stars, but this place is great (for what it is).  I came here on a late Friday afternoon, sat outside (they have 2 tables for two), as the guy working behind the counter suggested and said he'd be able to wait on me (I don't know why, but I thought going in it'd be a bit more self-serve).  He was diligent, kind, but not too invasive.Now onto the food.  The portions are larger than you think, so just keep that in mind.  I was here by myself and ordered one of their special "tartines" or toasts. This one had prosciutto and Granny Smith apple on top of arugula and lemon whipped goat cheese-delicious, fresh, sulking and still somehow light! I ordered a main (the veggie bowl)-it was huge, and it came with spinach (raw), roasted portobello, red peppers and asparagus and a large piece of toast cut in two.  pro tip:  you can ask for a different type of toast, they have 3:  whole wheat I believe is their default, but they have seven grain and sourdough (I went sourdough obviously), they bring you butter and the DELICIOUS house made raspberry jam-it's to die for! I'll definitely be coming back! Ps-it's BYOB, AND they make iced coffee and homemade iced tea--it's only $3
2019-08-09,4,Solid brunch option..  no frills, good food, good service..
2019-08-08,2,I really want to give this place a higher rating as they are local and very friendly. They also look like they have some great stuff on the menu. Unfortunately I went with the steak sandwich which was my first experience and surprisingly chewy. The bites I did manage to chew had a weird taste to them, so not a good choice. Everything else was great -french fries ciabatta bun fresh vegetables etc. They're all great. Just avoid the steak.
2019-07-26,4,I tried Tosti for the first time on Wednesday night.  It was a really nice night and my friend and I wanted to go somewhere casual and sit outside since we had recently finished running and it was a really nice night..   There were only a couple of people there at 8 pm at a table outside.  We picked up a six pack of beer at the liquor store conveniently down the street and were seated at a table outside.  After we popped open a beer and were reviewing the menus, the waitress came over and asked us if we'd move inside since she said the ownerwanted to shut down the outside.  We were pretty frustrated by that since we wouldn't have sat down or opened up a beer if they were going to ask us to move inside, especially since they were supposed to be open for another hour.  She came back and said it was fine to stay outside, but it felt like they were trying to rush us and they were clearing things away all around us the entire time.   Despite the issues with service, the food itself was very tasty.  There were several items on the menu I would have liked to try.  We shared the hummus with pita to start - the pita was nice and warm when it came out and there were whole pine nuts in the hummus.   I ordered the bibimbap bowl with beef bulgogi.   It was very tasty and a good sized portion.  My friend ordered the kale salad with grilled salmon on top.  It was a good sized portion of fish, however, the salad is very kale heavy.   The food came out pretty quickly.  We were done by 9 pm, the time the restaurant was due to close.  Will likely come back to try brunch or lunch and sit outside again (and hopefully not be rushed).
2019-07-13,4,The food here was delicious. I ordered from the build your own omelette bar that had a variety of options and the ingredients were fresh. We also ordered sides of bacon, biscuits, and the home fries (a must get here). There is a nice outdoor seating area, and the inside has a trendy decor. The prices were very reasonable, and I will definitely be coming back next time I'm in Hoboken.
2019-07-12,5,The food here is amazing.When I first walked in, I was greeted with a smile and seated right away.  Servers and busboys were friendly and attentive.  I had the omelet.  They have a build your own omelet bar.  I had mine with peppers, cheddar, and bacon.  Everyone has their own taste, but to me this was melt in your mouth delicious.  I've never felt rushed in here.  Will definitely be back.
2019-07-10,4,Tosti continues to be a wonderful addition to the neighborhood. Many of the menu items are innovative and very good.  One item that really could use an overhaul is the avocado toast with egg.  It is grossly overpriced for what you get and a pretty bad value.  For $11, you get a single slice of toast with avocado spread and an egg. You also get diced tomatoes, but they appear to be of the variety that comes scooped out from a store bought container.The owners should visit Turning Point to get an idea of how to do this item right.  For under $7, Turning Point sells two slices of artisanal grain toast slathered generously with avocado, then topped with freshly sliced plum tomatoes, and drizzled with really good olive oil.   $2.25 more and they toss in two (not just one) egg prepared how you want it.  After eating this, you're pretty much stuffed, unlike the counterpart at Tosti (which is less than half the same offering quantity and quality-wise and almost $2 more!).Until the item is changed, I suggest avoiding this one from the menu.
2019-07-06,2,Overpriced and mediocre food. Croque madame has way too much bread. I actually had to remove a slice and leave it on the side. $10 for a basic bacon, egg, and cheese on a brioche. Waitress offered coffee, would've passed if I knew I'd be paying $3.00 + for a basic cup. I don't mind paying for good food, it's decent food but not worth what u pay.
2019-07-05,3,Went there for brunch.  The bunch was good but very heavy on bread dishes (i.e sandwiches) which really isn't my thing.  Others that are into bread may rate higher.
2019-07-04,5,Very cute and rustic looking brunch cafe. The chicken and waffles is really good, as are the huevos rancheros. Visited on a holiday around 11:00am and it wasn't too crowded. There is a small outside seating area and a big indoor seating place in the back. Definitely worth a visit if you're in Hoboken! Prices are also very reasonable. Service is good too. Seems like all the waiters and waitresses are local college students.
2019-07-03,5,The vibes here are unmatched as is the food. The bibimbap bowl is so incredibly yummy and filling. As is the kale avocado salad. I also love the veggie burger and burritos. Truly everything on the menu is great! It's also super clean and friendly atmosphere. This might be my favorite brunch spot in Hoboken.  Pricing is also very reasonable. 2 entrees and 2 soft drinks for ~$30.
2019-07-02,5,Excellent atmosphere and great wait staff. We walked in close to their closing and they were kind and happy to serve us! Try the dumplings! Great!
2019-07-01,5,Amazing ambiance and outdoor seating, perfect for a summer day lunch with friends. Drinks come in mason jars and are super refreshing. I ordered the turmeric iced latte and my friend Arnold Palmer, both delicious! Service is great and so many yummy brunch, lunch and dinner options! Must try if in Hoboken!
2019-06-27,5,Great environment, friendly service, delicious food! Great spot in town & we'll be back!
2019-06-17,4,Stopped in , in the am for a coffee and a wrap - very good stuff!  I ate outside as it was a perfect morning. Ordered coffee and a mushroom , avocado and egg wrap.  Cannot complain - very happy with this place and will return
2019-06-10,4,I went to Tosti for dinner and got the Deep Fried Oysters for my appetizer and the Bulgogi Burrito for my main dish. The oysters were quite small and not that meaty. I don't think they're really worth $8. The Bulgogi Burrito had a really tasty flavor. Even the rice in the burritos was flavorful. However, the amount of meat in the burrito was small. I got the burritos with fries, which were a bit plain. The burritos were $14, which is a pretty good deal. For dessert, I tried the Chocolate Peanut Butter Cake and the Peach Pie (both homemade). The Chocolate Peanut Butter Cake had a very strong peanut butter flavor, but was tasty. The peach pie was also good. They were both $5 per slice, which is a bit pricey.The service speed was a little slow. That being said, our waiter was super friendly, helpful, and attentive. The cafeÃÅ is nicely decorated with a chill vibe.Overall, Tosti is a very nice and affordable spot for a lunch or casual dinner in Hoboken to come with a couple friends.
2019-06-05,5,Great food and excellent service! Nice variety of good eats on the menu. This is a great place to come to if looking for healthy meal alternatives.Also, boyb!
2019-06-05,2,I was walking on my way to a different restaurant down the street to grab a bite for lunch. I passed the outdoor seating and the food some were eating outside looked appetizing, I stopped to look at the menu. Nothing special and a little pricey. I thought what can go wrong a chicken sandwich. I entered and was confused by the layout of the restaurant was confusing. Do I order at the register or sit down? I ordered the chicken sandwich with salad and sat down. The best service I received was from the gentleman in the black outfit, the busboy I believe. He gave the restaurant some sort of character or story the space was severely lacking. The food arrived very quick, within five minutes. At first glance, it was a little messy and I could tell it looked ok but it was not going to be my best. I took my first bite, it was on the dry side which I can bear but then it became crunchy. I then realized bacon smothered the sandwich. Very crispy, over cooked bacon ruined it for me and I just picked them out to salvage what I had left. I think once they make it more clear what the business model is, the customers can better know what to expect instead of being confused or not have their expectations met. The interior decorations did not help create the vibe I got from outside. Lighting needs to be improved, very dark. Oh, the salad. The greens were barely fresh as the bottom were all wilted and were room temperature. Ingredients need to be fresher, please.
2019-06-04,5,Why didn't I come here sooner? This place is a cafeÃÅ that's really more like a diner, tucked away in uptown Hoboken on Washington Street. When bae and I went, the place was crowded, even at 10 AM, when your average Hoboken brunch spot is just getting things started.The food itself is well-priced, with very few, if any, dishes above $15. My boyfriend and I ordered iced coffee and their Farmer's Breakfast (over easy eggs, with two biscuits, sausage gravy and homemade jam on the side), along with a side order of hash browns. The food itself is delish! Coffee was well-balanced and had all the feel of a good diner coffee. The eggs were cooked  to perfection and had the right amount of runniness. My favorite things, however, were the biscuits and jam. The biscuits were that perfect combination of flaky, soft, and melt-in-your-mouth, and it paired excellently with the homemade jam, which was sweet but not overly so. The hash browns were equally heavenly, and were seasoned to perfection; however, the quality and filling effect of the food made me feel like they weren't necessarily needed and perhaps too much. The only dull spot was the sausage gravy, which tasted creamy and savory at first, but then paled in comparison to the jam from a flavor standpoint.A must-try if you're in Hoboken and want a new spot for brunch!
2019-06-01,3,Food is good, but not amazing and overpriced for stingy portion sizes and casual atmosphere. The toast seemed like the same thing I could have picked up at a diner for half the price. My family left still hungry
2019-05-29,2,We stopped in and ordered coffee, chicken sandwich, burger, and bibimbowl to go. Food was quite good, coffee was just ok. There are definitely better choices in this area.The two stars are for the rude Korean staff at the cashier.  She never smiled and was not friendly when we placed the order. My 1.5 year old took one of the tea boxes out from the display cabinet and she walked out from the counter and tried to pull the box away from his hand. Not cool. She could have just let us know and we will put it back. Luckily my son didn't cry. With this kind of service we will not go back.
2019-05-28,5,Been here three times in the last two days. This place is great. Get the chicken and waffles or steak and eggs.
2019-05-23,4,Came here for breakfast and enjoyed the coffee! The breakfast sandwich was incredible but the chicken for the chicken and waffles was a bit odd.
2019-05-16,5,My girlfriend and I have came here three times so far and it has always been great. I recommend the Bulgogi stone bowl
2019-05-10,1,My wife and her friend just finished having lunch at Tosti.  Besides the fact that their food was terrible they are now both sick indicating improper sanitation.  I strongly suggest that you not eat in this restaurant.
2019-05-07,2,The food here is good, but not worth the rude, slow service. We asked multiple times for water, and my daughters order was forgotten. After a second wait period we were rudely told "it's coming as fast as it can" by the waitress who had forgotten to put it in in the first place. So many places in town with lovely service, no need to waste time here!
2019-05-03,5,Very friendly customer service, clean, homey and interesting menu. I liked the fact that they take apple pay it was very covinient. They also have a large range of coffees and teas!
2019-05-03,5,I eat at this place once a week and everything on the menu is really great! The staff is friendly and wide assortment of drinks. One of the best places in Hoboken. Great brunch on the weekends too, and super fast.
2019-04-25,5,This restaurant is  a gem!  I have been there many times and have never had anything I didn't love.  Don't skip dessert.  Pies and cheesecake all homemade.  BRING YOUR OWN BOTTLE  and relax and ENJOY!  I just noticed....they don't mention they are open most days until 9pm.  Dinner IS SERVED!
2019-04-24,5,Great place to go study or go on a dinner date! Good variety of food. Little known BYOB place, which is also a plus. The service here is also really good!
2019-04-22,4,A short Uber ride from my place. Breakfast served til 4pm. Plenty of vegetarian & pescatarian menu choices. No item over $12. Check, check, check, & check. This adorable cafe hit all our requirements. We shared French toast which could have been fluffier & better soaked in egg batter, but the caramel sauce which we generous drizzled over made up for the qualities we thought were lacking. Filling & well made, I couldn't finish my Croque Madame topped with an overhard egg. Also on our table were a salad (not sure which) with roasted tofu, T(urkey)BLT, & Turmeric Tuna Salad Sandwich. Satisfying portions, homemade cooking, comfortable space -- I'd come back with just a book or another group of favorites. Service was lovely, but a little forgetful when our waitress took phone or to-go orders. Not a problem if you're like me & not shy about getting up & asking for items my table needed.
2019-04-22,5,This morning I came here pretty hungry and I thought "ugh! I hope this place's food is good and it comes out quick." And it did. It was amazing. In the whole New York area, breakfast items could get pretty pricey depending on where you go to. But here, my whole table of 4 all got drinks, and food items that if they were basically anywhere else it would be well over 80 bucks (we're talking 2 big egg sandwiches, 1 big plate of French toast, and a plate of 3 decently sized waffles) for under 50 bucks! This place is great!
2019-04-18,5,This place has amazing food, great service, BYOB, intimate setting. Very reasonably priced too!
2019-04-16,2,My boyfriend and I walked in to try their lattes. Online it said they accept Apple Pay. They do not. They have a sign covering it that says there's a $5 minimum for credit card purchases. The girl behind the counter was rude. My boyfriend ordered two lattes. They were horrid. I do not recommend coming here for lattes! Might as well have gathered up some dirt and brewed it. Can't say anything about the food. We left. The coffee was expensive too! $9.75 for two bad tasting lattes. No thanks! Two stars is for the almond milk. I liked that they had milk alternatives. That's it.
2019-04-11,5,Wow. Found this place when visiting New Jersey for a quick work trip. The sign doesn't entirely "stick out", so keep an eye out for it! And the decorations could be a little updated. Originally came here for breakfast, but as soon as the waiter said the Bibimbowl was a homemade recipe by the owners, I of course had to try it. So out went they French toast and in came the rice bowl.It DID NOT disappoint! A Korean rice dish with tons of flavors including veggies, egg garnish, and bulgogi (my added choice of meat). It was definitely a filling dish, but I'm a small-portion eater, so take that for what it is. I had leftovers for another meal!Coffee was also a hit! Definitely one of the better choices since I've been in town.Service was also on par, but I had gone later in the afternoon so it wasn't entirely busy.Check this little gem out, it won't disappoint!
2019-03-30,3,So this review is not at the food. Because everything we ordered was very good. But the 3 stars are for that horrible costumer service. Waiters took half hour to come, never checked on us, and the food took even longer to arrive. Such a shame to see a place with such great food be so poorly managed.
2019-03-30,4,Stopped in to Tosti Cafe & Kitchen for brunch and it was very enjoyable! While this place was crowded and full, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table for two at 11:15am. The brunch menu had lots of good options ranging from healthier to more indulgent. Service is a little slow and inattentive, but they are friendly and food did come out fast. I had the Tosti breakfast sandwich with a side salad and it was one of the better breakfast sandwiches that I've ever had. I'd definitely come back for it! Coffee was nice and strong, too.Looking forward to snagging an outside table next time!
2019-03-27,5,Tosti is amazing! Great food as well as a lovely environment!! Also, great location and beautiful interior!
2019-03-15,5,Super cute cafe with attentive staff, fresh ingredients, and a range of breakfast drinks! I ordered a custom breakfast burrito with sausage, avocado, and roasted red peppers. This was good but could use a bit more flavor. I might order it with onion instead of red peppers if I came here again. My friend ordered the Tosti egg sliders and the portion size was good. The biscuits were dense, and the jam was delicious. Crispy bacon! Another friend ordered the veggie burger which was very good. Patty was tasty, filling and had good flavors. Comes loaded with guac, red onion, and arugula. Overall good, not the best breakfast I've had in Hoboken, but definitely a good spot with diverse options.
2019-03-10,4,Great coffee and delicious toast! I had the salmon toast and my fiancee had the avocado toast. They definitely didn't skimp on the toppings! The coffee was amazing, perfectly roasted and brewed!
2019-02-22,5,This place is unique and such a great find in the Hoboken restaurant scene. The service was excellent, as if you were in someone's home, and the food was delicious. The menu has an array of food items that makes you want to come back for more!!
2019-02-18,5,Can't speak for all their food (although now I definitely wanna eat here one day after seeing everyone's pictures) butttt their coffee is perfection. In a world full of crappy coffee, I can count on Tosti a few times a week for a solid cup of joe on my way to work. I have also had their chocolate croissant which was deeeelish!!!I recommend it to be shared because it's a little on the rich side. Love this place!
2019-02-17,5,Loved the ambience! Best part is the byob. It's v busy and buzzy during the weekends. I ordered the hummus salad. The veggies and the hummus were fresh and the pita was warm. Delicious. My friend ordered the portabello sandwich- the best part was the pesto with red peppers. It's all an ample quantity to fill you. Good spot in Washington st!
2019-02-17,5,Love the tosti sliders for breakfast. Also their salads are amazing. Great place, my go to spot for breakfast and lunch. On Tuesday, MUST get the tacos. Legitimately best tacos ive ever had anywhere
2019-02-10,5,Best breakfast sandwich in Hoboken. Sliced brioche was nice and "Tosti," egg cooked perfectly, and bacon was crispy. Good coffee and attentive service. Hoboken needs more quality restaurants like this one.
2019-02-02,5,One of my favorite places to go for a Chai latte. It was really good and the price was much better than anything I would have gotten in the city. Nice vibe, courteous service and cute little place. Definitely would come back with friends
2019-01-14,4,Found this place by chance and really liked it! There's a nice smell of food being prepared. I totally recommend it
2019-01-04,5,Cute spot! Happy to discover it right around the corner from me! I enjoyed the kale salad and guac & chips. Everything seemed very fresh. I definitely will be back many times to come. Recommend it for breakfast or lunch!
2018-12-31,5,Comfy cafe environment - room to work or just socialize. Full espresso bar with a plethora of great drink options. Warm staff and a dynamic menu - Tosti really hits the mark!
2018-12-19,5,This place is super cute and has great options! The menu is amazing and has so many things my friend and I want to try, we just have to come back again! The teas were great and the roasts and salads were just as good.
2018-12-04,5,Korean Steak Tacos are 10/10, the workers are always so sweet and diligent. Love this place.
2018-12-02,3,Tasty cafe with good brunch toast dishes. A little pricey but that is par for these types of coffee bars. The highlights: Tuna toast, French toast. Good coffee!
2018-12-01,1,The food is great, but the service is awful. The wait staff has forgotten my table every time I have come in. Don't giving them second chances.
2018-11-25,5,Best waffle. The whipped cream on top is delicious. Brother had French toast and thought it was great as well. Good coffee with nice presentation.
2018-11-25,3,My husband and I stopped into Tosti for a bite to eat before a movie, this is our third time coming. Every time we say the same thing, service could have been way better. Unfortunately, this time they did not bring out what my husband ordered. Service is very slow and we were practically the only ones in the restaurant. In Hoboken especially with the competition, there are so many other places to eat. The food is good, but all the other factors come into play.
2018-11-23,5,Came in on a chilly day and got very nice tea (cute mugs!) and coffee (the iced coffee and the chai lattes are very good). Charming decor, nice jazz, and the service is pleasant!
2018-11-21,5,Incredibly delicious food! Plus the huevos rancheros were appealing to the eye. Eggs delicately perched atop tortillas, with fresh salsa on the side. I tried the Korean BBQ taco not knowing to expect. So much flavor! I was disappointed when I finished it so quickly. Literally licked my fingers to make the juicy goodness last as long as possible. Got this with a surprisingly delicious side salad (included) that was lightly dressed with a vinaigrette and red onions. Drank a perfect unsweetened iced tea with lemon. Love the rustic / cute decor. I want to hug this place. Truly a gem!! Can't wait to go back!!
2018-11-19,4,Really cute spot for brunch! Decent prices and good options. At our table we liked the madame croque, build your own egg sandwich, and pancakes the most. I got the bacon cheddar but wish I'd built my own sandwich instead. Would like to return for lunch next time and try some of those items!Service was alright - they were very nice and our food came quickly enough but we had multiple servers who got confused who was taking our order and we said no to more coffee at least 5 times before we had to ask for our check. Overall, could have been better but wasn't something to prevent me from returning.
2018-11-10,5,Delicious food, super fast service, high-quality coffee and friendly waitstaff. What more could you want? Definitely check it out, I feel like this place is super underrated.
2018-11-02,5,So excited to eat here! The cutest little place on the block. Plus they serve breakfast until 4!! Win win!
2018-10-29,3,The coffee was amazing here but unfortunately the food and service was ok. I would 100% come back for the lattes or iced coffee, but would do without the food next time.
2018-10-29,5,My first time to Tosti. Service is great as is the food. Stroller friendly during the week
2018-10-29,5,Tosti is a great new spot! Perfect for a casual breakfast or lunch. I love the Tostis sandwich. It's also a great place to study or do some work. Try it out!!
2018-10-28,4,4.5- We loved the food this morning and the manager (an Asian gentleman) was doing his best to make sure everything was running smoothly. The service was good and they were busy- later we did find out they were short staffed. We tried the biscuits to start (they were ok, a little burnt on top) but the gravy and jam were delicious. I could easily have ordered the gravy in a cup with spoon, it was like a chowder- really so good! We then ordered an egg burrito (with avocado, bacon, cheddar) and an omelette (spinach, mushroom, avocado, feta) both were delicious, hot and came out quickly. The salsa verde was delicious as was the chipotle mayo. We didn't try any of the coffee's or drinks but we would go back, prices are reasonable.
2018-10-27,5,Great brunch spot in uptown Hoboken, great place for families and groups, they are currently working on a gluten free items but my favorite is definitely the bacon  and cheddar cheese on a croissant  it's a my favorite, they make a great cortado and the staff is pleasant and professional and friendly, they are very accommodating and they do offer parties/gathering as long as you tell them in advanced and a great place uptown to host a special event. They have a great Rice Crispy and amazing brownie. They have a bathroom in the back and take cash or credit, I rarely give five stars and this is a great addition to Hoboken.
2018-10-24,5,This place was a delightful surprise. I stopped in here for dinner after my son's dentist appointment. I had yummy tacos that came with a salad and my son had pancakes and sausage (the server accommodated us as it was past the time for serving pancakes). The food was delicious and we will definitely be coming again to try other items.
2018-10-23,4,Very solid breakfast food choices.Weak coffee.Nice little breakfast spot.  Tried a couple different items on multiple visits.  Everything was above average, looking forward to trying more items.The coffee could use a little improvement though.  But other than that, a welcome addition to the neighborhood.
2018-10-12,4,Generous portions, friendly staff, and a lovely interior with a variety of seating spaces. 4 stars for ambiance, food quality, and service. Glad to have a spot like this in the neighborhood for brunch and dinner!
2018-10-08,5,Very cute place, nice menu selection and good daily specials. Breakfast from 8am-4pm and lunch starting at 11:30; great option for everyone.
2018-09-28,5,Super cute place with a good brunch / lunch menu! Awesome hot chocolate too, highly recommend. Our server Matt was great and we'll definitely be back
2018-09-25,5,This is a nice casual place to eat. They have great options and the service is prompt. The spicy fish tacos are amazing!! So delicious and perfect spice level. Lots of good Mexican-esque options, among others. Also if you write a review, they give you free chips and guacamole! Love it and would recommend :)
2018-09-25,3,Stopped by here on a Saturday afternoon as it was one of the few brunch places with outside seating that wasn't taking a siesta. BYOB spot with a standard selection of brunch favorites.Between two people: Biscuits & Jam ($5), Turmeric Tuna Sandwich ($12), and an Omelette ($10ish with add ons). Biscuits aren't as buttery as I'd like, though they are warm and are served alongside a flavorful jam (and butter). Tuna sandwich has lots of turmeric and onions inside, accompanied by a handful of perfectly cooked fries and a Chipotle mayo sauce. Omelet is your basic fare; added mushrooms, onions and cheese to balance out the eggs. Toast is a slice of bread cut diagonally. Had the Arnold Palmer ($4.50) to wash it down; a mix of iced tea and lemonade that I was expecting to be sweeter.Service here could have been better. We were told when we first got in that we would be seated next, but they forgot about a group before us (shit happens). Then, it took almost 15 minutes before someone took our order because no one told the wait staff we were waiting. Had to ask for my water to be refilled and to get the check. Overall, while the food quality was there, the service was not.
2018-09-24,5,Great service and amazing food. Really happy this spot opened in the neighborhood. I find this place very affordable and it's BYOB can't beat that! Bubbly brunch
2018-09-22,5,Awesome spot for brunch and dinner! Hoboken really needed a spot like this! I particular recommend anything with portobellos as well as the breakfast sandwich!
2018-09-19,4,Very good lunch spot. Friendly staff, consistently yummy food, relaxed atmosphere, and feels fresh and clean. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because I believe it's a touch overpriced. But that doesn't stop me from returning.
2018-09-16,5,We were in Tosti for brunch. This was our first time. We ordered French toast, sausages and omelette. Everything was delicious, cooked to perfection. 5 stars for great food, nice decor and vibe, very nice serve who thought I had great eyes :)
2018-09-07,5,In from out of town and this is exactly what I needed after a run along the river! Avocado toast was amazing!
2018-09-07,5,Absolutely love this great addition to Hoboken!! Excellent for brunch and lunch. Have tried and loved the French toast, avocado toast and the kale salad (can add salmon)! Also very baby friendly which is a huge plus!
2018-09-04,5,Walked in on a Sunday for brunch and was pleasantly surprised.  The service was great and we got seated right away.  I ordered the Hummus Salad which was delicious.  The portion was great and the homemade hummus tasted fresh.  I asked for a side of the lemon dressing and it went really well with the salad.  I'll be back and I look forward to trying more dishes there!
2018-08-29,4,I came here wanting to try their country breakfast brunch plate turns out they only serve that on the weekends. I wish that was specified on their menu. However, I was able to replicate that dish by ordering from the omelette bar with a side of home fries. I ordered a bacon, onions and peppers omelette and it came a salsa verde which was a nice touch and as for the home fries, I was expecting just your basic regular home fries and to my surprise it was a nicely roasted quartered potatoes with onions and peppers as well. Needless to say I enjoyed my meal.
2018-08-17,5,First time here after discovering it on a walk uptown and man I am so happy I did!  Menu looked amazing and the reviews backed it up so me and the hubs tried it today and it delivered on food, staff and ambiance.  Coffee was so good, had an omelette burrito with this delicious green sauce and then we had to try the biscuits and homemade raspberry jam and again our tastebuds were thrilled.  Can't wait to try them for lunch!!!
2018-08-16,5,Always great food. Homemade raspberry jelly, crispy bacon, strong coffee is always good. Every little detail inside is well thought out. Waitstaff is always nice and owner is very personable. Was recommended to come here by a friend and have been back 5 times since. Highly recommend. Weekend has great breakfast specials.
2018-08-10,5,Great stop for lunch. Sat outside and server was very attentive. Checked on me several times and always made sure I had water. They also gave my dog a biscuit and water which was a bonus! I ordered the salmon salad and it was delicious. Good size portion of salmon cooked to order. The salad was very fresh and had lots of veggies and a nice portion of olives and fresh feta cheese. The dressing was also very flavorful and not too heavy. A great addition to the neighborhood!
2018-07-23,3,Visited the place for brunch. The decor was minimal but nicely done. Service was good. Loved that they put slices of lemon in glasses of water (without asking for it).The menu has a lot of options. Noting new or fancy but good enough variety to cater to everyone.We ordered cappuccino and hot chocolate. Hot Chocolate was average. Felt like someone had used a ready made packet. Coffee was good.For food,we ordered waffles and nachos. Waffles were average. Nothing exceptional. With Nachos the biggest issue was that the toppings were not enough. I think they could do with little more toppings, or maybe provide salsa on the side just in case the toppings get over.So, all in all I would come here if I live in the area and am in no mood to cook. But not because they make something exceptional.
2018-07-21,4,really diggin' this place !  I've had the veggie burger twice .  Cute atmosphere & nice staff. I took one star off only because I just wish it was a little more affordable !  :D    I understand it's Hoboken prices though. I'd be coming for sandwiches more often if they were just a couple $ cheaper.
2018-07-19,4,I've been here multiple times since they have opened and everything I've eaten off their breakfast menu has been really good and I keep wanting to go back. Staff is friendly and the iced coffee is great too.
2018-07-15,2,Some members of the staff were rude. I live nearby and after my wife ate here with a friend I came to try out the offerings. I decided takeout BYO omelet at first and made an order. Before I even paid at a second glance I saw there is some "brunch" recommendations and asked the girl at the counter if I can still order this. My reply was that she already placed the order with the kitchen and looked at me as if I have two heads. It was literally 30 seconds after I finished my omelet order I asked. Another girl came by told the girl with the look on her face to simply check if the order has been started and swap if I'd like. Thanks. Well with the fuss the first counterperson cause I just said I'll have the omelet and it's fine. I wasn't even fazed I don't care about this kinda stuff really. But I was very shocked that after a minute or two the girl from the counter starts talking to another worker literally two feet from me and says how customers could be so rude and how they are not always right. Yo, I literally just asked if I can switch my omelet order to something else and you had to walk back to the kitchen. Chill. This chick literally looks at me while off on her rude customer rant. Girl, I ain't rude - you are just sour. She hands me the foot I make a very vocal thank you and shorty doesn't even say Your welcome. Honestly I can get an omelet croissant and coffee in a bunch of other places in Hoboken. Only giving extra star because one of the people working was nice. Get your staff in check. Never again.
2018-07-14,5,I stopped by this morning for some coffee and breakfast--cute place, friendly staff, perfect Americano and delicious avocado toast. I'm glad to have Tosti's in the neighborhood!
2018-07-13,5,Very pleasant restaurant. Came right after the airport and was able to bring my luggage in and had a great meal. The girls here are so nice! Would come back again if I had a chance
2018-07-02,5,Everything was simply tasty to the extent that we came here two days in a row! Their maple syrup was mixed with caramel I guess and it adds to the flavour.
2018-06-30,4,Great for dinner as well as brunch! I had the carbonara; my husband had a steak sandwich and we split hummus and bruschetta. Everything was great. The strawberry and tomato bruschetta was really yummy, great for summer. My carbonara was yummmmmm. My husband enjoyed his steak sandwich quite a bit. I would definitely come back, try other things; I feel like this place is a little undiscovered for dinner but I hope that changes! The food is terrific and the atmosphere is casual but still feels like a nice quiet couples' night out.
2018-06-07,4,From the outside looking in you would never guess how big it is inside. Stopped here for lunch with family from out of town. The staff was very friendly and accommodating as I had my 10 month old with me. I was able to fold the stroller up and leave it in the corner and they provided us with a high chair. We ordered a latte and chai latte for drinks, presentation and taste were wonderful. For food we had the chicken sandwich, tosti burger, chili, and prosciutto toast. They...were...all...delicious. The prosciutto toast was huge. My brother ordered the chilli thinking the toast wouldn't be enough but it was a large portion and he ended up taking most of the chilli to go. The chicken and burger were delicious and the brioche bun was not overly oily. The best part was the chipotle mayo to go with the French fries. If your order does not come with chipotle mayo I would suggest getting it on the side...seriously you will not regret it. I only took away one star because I thought the portion of fries on the side could have been larger. I'm a small girl and I usually can't finish a side of fries but I finished them wanting more, maybe it was the chipotle mayo?? Overall a great addition to uptown hoboken I will definitely be back!
2018-06-04,5,Great breakfast and service! Everything we ordered was delicious (Country Breakfast and Avocado Toast). The biscuits were also amazing!
2018-05-11,5,Tasti iced coffees to get your morning buzz on and flaky French pastries for a delightful accompaniment.
2018-05-06,3,Tosti opened this weekend and we were anxious to give it a try.  I really wanted to love this place but overall left a bit disappointed.  The pros: the staff was super nice, and the remodeled space was very nice.  Felt a lot like Bluestone.  Coffee was very good.  The food.... was just okay.  We both had egg sandwiches (I had the prosciutto, which was not actually a sandwich but was opened faced, he had the bacon).  Overall they were fine, but not very flavorful, esp in the bites that didn't have meat.  Tosti, you have to salt and pepper your eggs!  And at $10-12 each, they were nowhere near as good as what you can get at other places for $6-8.
