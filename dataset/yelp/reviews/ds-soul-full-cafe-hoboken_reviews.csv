2021-10-17,1,You just lost a regular customer. I order from here regularly through seamless app and always tip generously. This time I ordered a pickup and there is absolutely no obligation for me to tip for a take out order. I was yelled at for not tipping and will not be ordering from here again.
2021-10-06,5,Hands down the best breakfast in Hoboken. Food is always hot and absolutely delicious! Great coffee too. The delivery drivers are always super nice too. Get the weird nj burrito or the Popeye burrito!
2021-08-08,3,I got a BYO wrap with bacon, spicy hashbrowns, and I added avocado for an extra $1. TLDR: Okay wrap but for $10 I would probably opt for a really great breakfast sandwich somewhere else in town! I ordered online and had to wait a while because they were busy and I guess I got there too soon. It was like 11:30am on a Thursday. I liked how this wrap was ~pressed~ so it was crunchy on the outside, and warm.  The hash browns weren't overly spicy, they were good. But the other ingredients didn't standout. Nothing special here, sorry! :/ The only other thing I have to say was that I paid extra just to get tiny two slices of avocado. I feel like anywhere else when you add avocado to a meal, they give you a quarter to a half of an avocado.
2021-07-23,5,Steve, Howie, Jonathan and the entire staff offer great breakfast, lunch and fantastic service! As a vegetarian and breakfast person, having healthy options are super important to me. My go-to's are the veggie hangover burrito with spinach and avocado as well as the Garden of Vegan salad. Portions are delicious and generous- you won't be disappointed! There's a huge array of burritos, sandwiches, soups and salads (with and without meat). The daily assortment of coffee flavors and friendly morning chat with staff & patrons helps kick start my day. It's a nice, cozy cafe that also supports local artists (showcases hoboken magnets and wall art). They also sell gift certificates. I highly recommend checking out D's Soul Full Cafe!
2021-05-23,4,Great spot to order for lunch. Love their jazzed up grilled cheeses so much! My usual go-to is the apple jack melt, you won't be disappointed, love the nice crunch and tart of the apple in the gooey cheese! Also recently have gotten the nutty professor wrap and was pleasantly surprised! The description sounded odd but I was intrigued. Out of the sides, the coleslaw is my favorite! One of the perks of working from home is being able to order delivery or pickup from here!
2020-07-29,4,We've ordered breakfast from here maybe a few years ago and I thought it was only okay. I had had the The Spanish Fly breakfast burrito (two eggs, Spanish chorizo, tomato, spicy hash browns, cheese, ketchup and salt and pepper). In theory, it had all the things I love - chorizo, cheese, tomato, and hash browns. Except it fell kind of flat. Overall, it was soggy, the chorizo was meh, and the spicy hash browns were more like home fries. They were good but it is a bit misleading if you are expecting crispy potatoes but you get something else.Fast forward to mid-quarantine. We ordered D's Spicy Buffalo Chicken and Spicy Hash Browns (again, these were good but we had forgotten they were more like home fries, so not what we were expecting). The sandwich was really good! The chicken was perfect and it had the right amount of buffalo sauce in it. I'm thinking that their sandwiches (as opposed to burritos) might be better. I'd definitely be willing to try some of their other sammies because a lot of them sound pretty good. Also - D's, if you are reading this, please put some CRISPY spicy hash browns on the menu! (or at least rename them)
2020-06-14,5,Best coffee with tasty flavors always on rotation. Love the Farmer's Wrap for breakfast! Great local biz in Hoboken.
2020-05-20,5,Hands down the best coffee in hoboken and also some of the nicest and most authentic people you will ever meet. It is not your normal shop and there is an affinity towards the arts and music on display there that makes the vibe even better. Big personality for a small shop.
2020-01-23,3,This place is three stars to me, but a good place to go for something convenient. Food and coffee are just Eh... not anything to die over. But if you're hungover and need fast delivery... this is the place for you.
2019-11-20,1,Food arrived VERY late, cold and inedible. I live approximately 6 blocks away and it was 2:00 on Wednesday afternoon, hardly rush hour.  It was just an egg sandwich and bacon, not rocket science. I could make that when I was 10. They put the bacon in a big plastic bin so I'm sure it was cold almost immediately, they didn't even bother to put the food in foil! Place sounds dynamite judging from the menu choices especially if you're sick and want comfort food, it's also fairly inexpensive however it falls FAR short. There are too many great restaurants in town to go here! i did it for you. Save your money or if you want to go, I suggest ordering something that doesn't need to be warm.  Some of the food was improperly packaged so everything was cold, something you'd think a take out restaurant would have done pat.    Apparently there are a ton of bad reviews, unfortunately I read only the first page.  I can't believe people really still like this place.  How hard is it to make a decent egg sandwich and deliver it Six blocks at 2:30 on Wednesday afternoon.
2019-10-27,2,Have seen this place on some delivery sites for a while now but never tried it. I figured it would be some below average take out since all signs pointed to that and my intuition was right. I ordered a bunch of random stuff to give it a shot. I started with the disco home fries. They were bland potatoes with some sort of gravy.  The buffalo chicken sandwich tasted like something I would find in my school cafeteria back in the day.  The breaded chicken was from the freezer section I think.  It didnt taste horrible but I have had better.  I also tried an egg sandwich with hash browns and ham inside. Not my favorite. Would rather order from Bagels on the Hudson.  Tried some other sandwich too and wasn't a fan. If you are hungover and just need some fuel then this may do the trick. Otherwise I would try another place.
2019-10-20,4,A cute spot tucked away in the more residential area of Hoboken, this place has so many breakfast sandwich options! I'm not a fan of burritos so I got the Spanish Fry on a roll and would definitely recommend. You can also get your classic breakfast sandwiches if you don't want a specialty. Still so many I want to try!
2019-08-16,5,Ordered delivery from here today, ignoring the bad reviews. I had a great experience! I ordered the build your own breakfast burrito. It's a whole wheat wrap (white wrap an option too) with scrambled eggs and hash browns and your choice of what you want in it. I got mine with chicken, bacon, pepper jack cheese, mushrooms, hot cherry peppers and spinach. I also ordered a medium hot coffee. The delivery was early, the man was nice, and everything arrived hot. Burrito is large and filling! Everything was correct. Coffee is hot and they left room in my cup for me to add almond milk. Prices aren't bad either. I'm full! So it's definitely worth it. I'd order from here again. :)
2019-06-06,5,I've ordered delivery from this place a few times.  They are fast and very professional.  The food is awesome.  I order a French vanilla ice coffee, the paisano sandwich and the tuna melt.  The biggest compliment that I can give this place, comes down to one word.  CONSISTENCY... they always have the same quality and it's made the same way.  I love that.  One time they didn't have the French vanilla flavor for the ice coffee and they called to ask what flavor I would like instead..not the usual laziness of other places where they just send it to you plain and say that they didn't have what you wanted.  This place actually cares and gives you a choice.  Highly recommend!
2019-03-06,5,I love this place! Cute little coffee shop with friendly service and good food. I love the muffins and snickerdoodle coffee!
2019-02-11,5,I love D's. It's my go-to little spot for a great breakfast sandwich or wrap. So thankful they offer vegan options, too! Their spicy avocado hummus is to die for. I get it on a round roll or rye toast and it's so delicious!
2018-12-09,5,I decided to order from D's cafe because my roommate recently ordered delivery from here and was blown away by their delivery speeds and their food selections. I just ordered delivery from D's and I'm completely impressed. It took 15 Minutes from when I placed the order to when the delivery guy came to my door. I ordered the weird NJ breakfast burrito with a macaroni salad and a coffee. The burrito is tasty and so filling and the coffee arrived with no spills whatsoever. I'm so impressed I had to immediately write a review to let people know about this quiet, unsuspecting spot on Willow. I had always driven or walked past it so many times and didn't pay any attention to it until my my roommate raved about it. I will absolutely order from here and I can easily see it becoming my go-to!
2018-12-01,5,We love this little spot. It doesn't look like much and it's oddly placed on Willow, but their breakfast burritos are the best and super filling. We've never eaten anything here we didn't inhale.
2018-09-02,4,Always great wraps and coffee here . A little hole in the wall but cozy place . I get the groovy green !
2018-07-26,5,This place is great! I got veggie melt and it was amazing! Has so many menu options for vegan, vegetarian and non-vegetarians! Would recommend this place to anyone!
2018-07-17,4,I usually order breakfast burritos from here and usually as a hangover cure tbh. Most of the burritos are good. I've tried one or two that I wasn't a fan of, but my favorite is the mexican burrito. I've also ordered coffee from here. It was just ok. They also have a lot of other options besides breakfast burritos that at some point I would like to try.
2018-06-06,5,Delivery comes so fast and is always delicious! Everyone is always friendly too. One of the few businesses that give us local teachers a little discount. We appreciate having D's near us!  Definitely try their buffalo chicken salad and veggie chili - amazing.
2018-05-31,3,D's Soul Full Cafe was just what we needed -- a place in the neighborhood, a half block from our AirBnB, where we could grab a quick breakfast before heading into the city for a day of sightseeing.They offer a nice selection of breakfast wraps that can easily be eaten on the go if you need to. Mine tasted fine -- a good combination of eggs, veggies and sausage. Their food is what I like to call "utilitarian food." It's not haute cuisine nor is it trying to be. It's properly prepared, it tastes fine, and it serves its purpose, and all at a fair price. Sometimes that's all you need.
2018-04-04,4,This place has become my go-to breakfast burrito joint in Hoboken. They have a huge menu of options and each time it does not disappoint. My wife and I frequently wake up on our day off, look at one another and say, "Breakfast Burrito?" and the answer is always D's. I'm a fan of the Ranchero and the Urban Cowboy. My wife likes the Mexicano. Either way, they do a great job of toasting it and putting all the ingredients together. The only thing keeping it from being 5 stars is the wait times. I understand good food takes time but we do consistently wait a pretty good amount of time when we dine in. Delivery is the same. It takes some time. You do get a free coffee when you dine in with the burrito order so that's a plus as well. Just speed up a little bit D's and you've got yourselves 5 stars!
2018-03-01,5,Great place, the breakfast and sandwich wraps are terrific.  Staff is friendly and quick.  They deliver but we always stop in to take out and they also have a small eat in area both inside and out.  Check out the local artist works on the wall if you go in.
2017-12-31,3,Most is not all items are microwaved which you can taste in a weird way. I feel they should invest in a flattop is they don't already and add more substance into the burritos. Coffee is good. Employees were throwing food at one another when I was there... and eating... which threw me off. I expected more.
2017-12-09,2,My delivery was already a half hour late when my husband called to see what the problem was. The man who answered the phone was unapologetic and blamed it on the snow. We are having light snow today but that is not an excuse to have your food take 2 hours without any apology or compensation. Our food finally arrived over an hour after the latest quote time and it wasn't that good. I wouldn't order from here again.
2017-10-29,1,Been waiting 2 full hours for breakfast sandwiches. First and last time I'll ever order from here. Given the shitty reviews below, I shouldn't get my hopes up.Update: food arrived and I wish I could say it was "worth the two hour wait" but their breakfast potatoes are uncooked and the eggs are reminiscent of what I'd get at McDonalds. I wish I could return!
2017-10-08,2,I really want to like these guys.  We've never had issues with the food and the staff is always friendly and courteous.  The problem with D's is (and has always been) the wait.  Other reviewers have said the same thing unfortunately.  Today, I ordered two breakfast sandwiches at 10:45 for delivery.  I'm writing this review at 12:10 and the food still hasn't arrived.  I understand if you're busy, but there is no way it should take 90 minutes to prepare and deliver a pair of breakfast sandwiches.  In fact, I called them twice and they told me "that they were a little behind" today.  Sandwiches finally came at 12:20.  I don't know the owners, but I hope they read their online reviews.  This isn't the first time someone has complained about the timeliness of an order, so I hope they improve because the food is good.
2017-10-01,2,Below average breakfast wrap that took 30 minutes. They didn't acknowledge us for a solid three minutes. Even after we made eye contact on multiple occasions. Go to OBagel or Frans for a better sandwich. Seemed like microwaved bacon and fake eggs. Only tasted ketchup and the tortilla. Save yourself the $7.95.
2017-09-22,5,This was my first time ordering dinner from D's. I ordered the NE Philly cheesesteak with side of coke slaw. Wow! Really great sandwich and the slaw is great too. I look forward to exploring their menu. They start at a 5. Bravo!9/22/2017 this morning I had D's "4:20" Burrito and coffee. Just perfect together. The 4:20 is wonderfully unique with breakfast standards combined with maple syrup. I  D's and encourage you to check them out.
2017-09-16,2,Stay away for breakfast. I don't know about most people, but I like real eggs and real bacon. When I ordered a bacon, egg and cheese, I watched some workers simply throw a frozen egg patty and some bacon strips in the microwave. Also, it took them 20 minutes to put this microwaved breakfast sandwich together.I am giving two stars to give them the benefit of the doubt as lunch items could potentially be better. I simply won't be returning after seeing my breakfast microwaved. The workers were pretty friendly so that's always good I guess.
2017-07-31,3,I want to love this place so bad...the breakfast burritos are tasty, maybe a little expensive but you get your money's worth.  The staff is friendly.  So why only three stars?  This place takes FOREVER to get your food.  I live in the neighborhood, have ordered delivery just a few blocks away (I was hungover, sue me), and it took well over an hour.  I thought I had learned my lesson, and instead started going there to pick up...both times I had to wait literally an hour for them to catch up on their orders and make me a breakfast burrito.  I asked about my order a few times, being polite as possible because they really are very friendly, but still, it took them over an hour to get me my food.  While I was sitting there waiting.  And they kept telling me it would just be a few minutes.  Seriously?  I'm sitting right there waiting, just make my burrito real quick so I can get out of there.  If I didn't mind waiting, I would have just ordered delivery.  A 10-15 minute wait after the confirmed pickup time is fine, shit happens.  Over an hour is not okay.  It's a breakfast burrito.  They literally make some of the stuff in the microwave (and I'm not knocking them for that, the food is tasty)Unfortunately I will probably not eat from here again as I just don't have the time to wait around an hour for a breakfast burrito.
2017-06-11,5,I'm a huge fan of D's. All of the breakfast and lunch wraps are delicious and I love that you get a small coffee free with a breakfast wrap. The fact that they take a while could be seen as a negative, but for some reason, it doesn't irk me. The employees are super nice as well.
2017-05-28,1,I came here last Saturday for a breakfast burrito since I heard very good things about D's. My buddy and I ordered one each, and we waited and waited and waited. People came in after us, ordered, and got their breakfast before us. When I inquired about the delay, they told us that we would get the food soon, but this promise was not adhered to. 30 minutes after ordering, we finally got our burritos. When I inquired as to why it took so long (they weren't very busy), they told me that the people who got their burritos ahead of us ordered before arriving (they didn't, I watched them order). As I was in the middle of explaining this to them, they just walked away from me, extremely rudely. This is not a place I'll be coming back to. The burritos were just alright. The one I had that was supposed to have chorizo was severely lacking in the meat, unfortunately.
2017-05-25,5,This place has amazing wraps and subs. Stand outs: iron man, cardiac attack and jacks roast beef.  Place is the best mom & pop size shop around.
2017-05-18,5,The most consistent, friendly, and quick restaurant I have ever witnessed. Great brunch on Sundays and the delivery is half the time of anyone else's. I've ordered here a good number of times and will continue to do so. Way to go - love me some D's
2017-04-17,5,By far my favorite place to order from in Hoboken, actually the only reason I use seamless! Delivery is fast and accurate. The delivery guys are always very nice, and if ordered for pick up the management and staff is always super nice and greets you with a smile and hello! And to come completely full circle the food is delicious, only place you can count on quality food for breakfast, lunch, or dinner!! D's will continue to be my go-to! Thanks :)
2017-03-28,3,Food is good and fresh. Some items are stars and some are just average. Service and inconsistency is main reason for three stars. Here are the hits and star items: Drunken Turkey Wrap, Classic Cafe Wrap with Chicken, Pesto Mayonaise, Avocado, Relish the Curry Gobbler Turkey with Kale, Gruyere, Emmenthal and Apple Relish, and the Chick Pea, Kale, Pineapple, Salad. The just average items are the Egg Wraps, the Italian Godfather (can't hang, not sure why they offer it, competition is steep in Hoboken, stick to their wheel house items), the Roast Beef, the Chicken Balsamic Wrap. Most of the regular staff are very cool, pleasant, happy to help. Owner doesn't always seem to embrace patience or be open to his audience and customers, and what they are saying. Still eat there, because their star items are quite bright comparatively for what they are, and in Hoboken. Hoboken hurts in actual good, quality, fast food, or food on the go. They are way behind Manhattan still for the casual bites.
2017-01-21,1,Terrible service. We had to wait for almost five minutes before anybody would even take our order and then had to wait another 30 for it to come. Food is decent but absolutely not worth the wait. There are many other better breakfast sandwich places in Hoboken with better service.
2017-01-15,4,Breakfast burritos here are really good especially when you put the spicy hash browns on it .. the BBQ chicken sandwich is good too
2017-01-04,2,I live in the neighborhood and had never been here. About a month ago I had a great experience: whoever was behind the counter gave me quarters for laundry (that I desperately needed), even though they were closed. I noticed they had breakfast and made a note to return and give them my business.      Today I walked in and ordered an $8 breakfast burrito. After I ordered, the man behind the counter, who seemed to be an owner or manager, informed me it came with a free coffee - the regular was ready, the hazelnut was brewing. Surprised, I said "Great. Could I also have a cup of tap water, please?" The man said...no. Since the burrito already came with free coffee, I would have to buy a bottle of water. Sensing how taken aback I was, he informed me that I could have a cup of water, but I would not be given the coffee. I could hardly believe my ears. I get that a small business has to keep tight margins. But to flatly deny a customer a cup of water? If they're that worried about giving away free water, I suggest they stop giving away free coffee. The man's attitude wasn't exactly apologetic. I did not know I was being so brazen. As a first time customer, it left a horrible taste in my mouth. I can throw a rock and hit three other places to pick up a breakfast sandwich.              I live on the block - they could have had me there twice a week for years to come Now I doubt I'll ever go back.                 The burrito took forever, by the way.
2016-10-08,2,Meh. I wish I liked this place because they are around the corner from my apartment and everything on the menu SOUNDS good. I got the Jack's roast beef wrap which was so bland tasting and dry that I couldn't even finish it (and it was pretty tiny). It had one piece of mozzarella cheese that you couldn't even taste. It was very disappointing. Maybe I'll give them one more try.
2016-09-19,1,Officially the GROSSEST experience I've ever had. I pulled a chewed off FINGER NAIL out of my mouth which came from the hash browns. I ordered from this place for the past few yrs. When I called to explain what happened the manager wasn't very apologetic. He claimed that they wear gloves . Obviously someone chewed their nail off , & spit it, unfortunately into my food . So so gross. I even saved it for them to see that obviously it couldn't be mine lol!
2016-09-02,2,I've never been moved to post a review on Yelp, until today. I've ordered a few times from this place in the past and the delivery guy is always a little rude and hurried, but whatever that doesn't bother me as long as I get my food. Today I open my bag and the potato salad has spilled over on to everything and the sandwich looked like it was sat on. The bread is insanely soggy, like how long did it have to sit to get this way? It's the saddest sandwich I've ever seen. I'm giving it 2 stars since at least it's still food and I'm hungry.
2016-08-11,4,I tried this place for the first time today cause of all the great reviews. had the hangover with sausage n it was excellent. 2 reasons it doesn't get 5 stars. 1 being it really does take a long time for them to make but then again I guess u can't rush perfection. 2 there is no parking n I ended up getting a $55 ticket waiting on my $7.65 burrito!  #SuperFail food is excellent but don't know if I will be returning cause of the parking issue. I'm pretty well off in life but $63 everytime I goto get a burrito is pretty stupid. they don't deliver to port imperial so I guess this will be the first and last time. if u live in the neighborhood it's a must try. gentlemen that runs the front counter was very pleasant n courteous also. too bad D's....start delivering to port imperial n I'll be ordering few times a week easily.
2016-07-11,5,I ordered the BBQ Chipotle Sandwich.. its amazing and i cant believe no one has reviewed it. If you go, get it. IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE. Definitely want to try the Mexicano Breakfast Burrito now that i read these reviews!
2016-06-09,4,I've eaten here 3 times now and tried a different burrito each time - the Mexicano, Farmer, and Weird NJ are all winners in their own ways! It's got some heft but doesn't make me feel bloated and horrible for eating something substantial for lunch either. I'm a big fan of the spicy hash browns as well. Service is friendly and quick, pickup times on Delivery.com are on the money and the owner is often around if for some reason you'd have an issue. If it were more walkable on a lunch break I'd probably eat here daily. Affordable as well, they could easily get away with charging more for what you get. I love breakfast food and this place nails it for something just a little different.
2016-03-18,5,I'd lived in Hoboken 2 years before I gave this place a shot (let alone knew it existed), but I'm so glad I found it! It looks pretty dive-y from outside, but don't let that fool you. I haven't tried their famous burritos, but the soups (vegetarian chili is my pick), salads, sandwiches (nutella and fluff!) and iced coffee are delicious. The salad I ordered was crisp with delicious tuna salad, tons of veggies and even had grated beets mixed in- pretty yummy and unexpected for your standard garden salad. I've ordered via seamless as well and delivery is extremely speedy and near the freshest of any Hoboken spot - and I've ordered a LOT of Seamless. Find your way to this place!
2016-03-13,3,Nice staff on the phone, and delivery was quick, but I paid for a side of macaroni salad and what I got was a dressing-sized mini cup of mayonnaise soaked pasta, maybe a spoonful amount. How much can macaroni salad really cost? Y'all couldn't really give someone some more?
2016-02-14,1,The menu is ambitious and wordy. I ordered something safe since it was my first time there - a grilled cheese. I did not know it was possible go screw up a grilled cheese. Needless to say I will not be returning.
2016-01-16,5,This is super tight!  I got like four burritos here once and it was off the hizzy!!!!!!!! #blessed
2016-01-11,3,Better before the fire burnt it down. This is not what it was. I came in high spirits and left dejected. Sigh. At least they used gloves but then collected money with it. wish I walked further in the freezing cold somewhere else. Wrap was ok. Pass from now on most likely.
2016-01-10,1,Very disappointing, I wanted to give these guys a chance. Ordered seamless with minimal instructions no salsa/ no ketchup. Unfortunately our entire order contained exactly what I requested not to have. These things happen, when I called the first person to answer made it clear she didn't care. When I asked for the owner/manager he also was aloof. For a small local business with plenty of competition around I would think customer service would be more important.
2015-11-29,5,Breakfast game is strong with this one. The Mexicano - 2 Eggs, Spicy Hash Browns, Refried Beans, Homemade Salsa, Pepper Jack Cheese. Great customer service too. They called an hour after the order was placed to tell me that one of the items orders was not available. My response "you're just firing this now? We ordered it an hour ago!" The caller apologized and explained that they were busy. 30 minutes later the food arrived. The delivery person offers a handshake and an apology. Then told me he was the owner and wanted to apologize face to face. About a half hour later I received an email with part of my order refunded. Most places wouldn't even apologize. Totally appreciate the outstanding customer service and thankfully the food was damn good. Will definitely be ordering again.
2015-11-07,4,4 stars for the food but the service, let's just say there's a lot of room for improvement. Ordered the famous hangover cure and the weird NJ. Both burritos were very tasty and filling. Each burrito came with a free small (12oz) coffee-  bonus!. This made up for the lengthy wait to receive our order (highly recommend calling in to order for pick-up if they often take this long). Cool selection of coffee flavors. The graham cracker was pretty good.The staff can be more friendly and welcoming. It almost became awkward when the girl taking the orders took her time to acknowledge us even though she appeared not to be busy, whatever!
2015-08-28,5,A great variety of breakfast burritos and sandwiches which always hit the spot (especially when nursing a hangover)! Prices are great, delivery is fast (no fee on delivery.com and only a $8 minimum). Iced coffee is a must (be sure to ask what flavors they have that day).
2015-08-16,5,Like a Frozen Monkey revival but better because: 1) it's open; 2) in my 'hood; 3) great vibe!!!
2015-08-09,2,The burritos were very average, the eggs lacked taste n appeared microwaved. The farmer's which was supposed to include mushroom, didn't have any. Also, you think you can't go wrong with an egg n cheese sandwich but the bread was dry/stale and there was hardly any cheese in it, we had to throw most of it away.
2015-08-07,5,If you have not yet visited this place, shame on you. You're missing out!!I have worked with the guys from D's on multiple occasions to host an event at Stevens Institute. They were always beyond generous, and their passion about their business shone through. They are genuine, and I am proud to support an establishment like that in the community.The past six months that they were closed due to the fire/renovations was awful - I found myself craving their food all the time! But, they are back, and the quality is still impeccable.Do yourself a favor and order the spicy drunken turkey. I'm not always the biggest fan of turkey on a sub - but this is to die for. It's soaked in bourbon and really picks up an incredible flavor; it's moist, and they load it on the sandwich. The bourbon sauce is a sweet, barbeque-y flavor with a bit of a spice - it's messy, but ohhh so delicious. Finally, it's topped with avocado (who doesn't love avocado these days?) as well as cheese, spinach, and tomatoes. Oh, and don't forget the chipotle mayo, which adds a creamy compliment to the already delicious sandwich. Go get one right now.Welcome back, D's - Stevens will have to get you new certificates so you can display that you are still "Best Sandwich!"
2015-08-02,4,I never thought much of D's until they closed for several months to fix fire damage and I realized I missed them.The breakfast burritos are really consistent and satisfying. Staff are good and the vibe is comfortable and welcoming.I'm looking forward to adding them back into my working from home lunch line up :)Added bonus: they actively support local art and music, which is a rare find in Hoboken especially for a small cafe.
2015-01-31,2,This place is pretty awful. Terrible coffee that they run out of, so can't even get the free cup I would prefer.  Breakfast burritos are edible but they cut them in half.. Through tin foil.  How ignorant do you have to be to not know that you don't cut through tin foil? But hey, I barely noticed the tiny pieces of tin foil I was eating. They microwave their eggs.  And the owner is mercurial at best.  Apparently he's nice to girls tho. Major thumbs down and disappointment. I'm mulling changing the rating to 1 star.
2014-12-18,4,Great breakfast wraps!! Lunch is also pretty solid too! I love ordering the breakfast especially with a hangover!! It's a lot of food, love that they put the potatoes right in the burrito. The lunch is also tasty and unique, I love the buffalo chicken! Also great that this place is now open a little later. I definitely suggest going there for the cool vibe or getting delivery for some good eats!!
2014-12-09,4,Yumm!! I ordered a sub from here and it was fresh and delicious! My only complaint was that for the price, the side of cole slaw was small.
2014-12-08,5,I might be jumping the gun here with this review since it's only my first time ordering delivery, but wow, I am so glad I tried this place. Ordered the hangover cure burrito with ham and friend ordered the cardiac arrest burrito. Both delicious, fresh, hot, and filling. Delivery was light speed quick. Granted, it's a Monday morning and I live around the corner from here (don't judge- it's freezing out today!) so that might have something to do with the speed.I can't wait to try more of the menu! If their food matches the quality of my breakfast burrito, I'm in. Oh, and did I mention it's super affordable?Btw- while I'm sure the hangover cure does the trick for hangovers, it doubles as a great power breakfast if you're stuck in the house studying for final exams Thank you D's! This just moved to the top of my list for breakfast delivery.
2014-12-07,2,This food is pretty average. From the description, their Monster Veggie Wrap sounded 1) very filling and 2) very delicious. The ingredients weren't mixed well and worst of all, the wrap was cold! It did not advertise the wrap being heated but I feel anything that is full of steamed veggies would be warmed. I wouldn't say the wrap tasted horrible or anything necessarily, and would probably eat it again if I was very hungry, but I wouldn't say that this was an exquisite wrap or a must-try.
2014-12-06,4,The word "creative" is used a lot to describe D's cooking and that is so true! From the outside, it may not look like much, but the sandwiches, wraps, soups and salads are amazing! Not at all typical or boring.The owner seems like such a great guy, always friendly, so I'm glad to be able to support his business. Pro tip: if you're picking up, call in advance. They are very popular so call in your order to avoid the wait.
2014-11-15,5,This down & dirty sandwich shot always hits the spot. They have creative and tasty breakfast wraps and great iced coffee. On weekends they have live music by local artists. Yum!
2014-10-26,5,Freaking delicious!! Definitely my new favorite delivery breakfast spot!  I got the Mexicano breakfast wrap and substituted green peppers for the refried beans. It was amazing and just the right amount of food. The spicy hash potatoes are awesome and have just the right amount of kick.  Will definitely order from here again!!
2014-10-11,4,Love D's..they have have awesome menu items especially for breakfast.  Great cup of coffee and funky menu items.  I really enjoy the quinoa salad and will usually stop by on my lunch break. Doesn't hurt either that they give 15% off for teachers :)
2014-08-12,4,I ordered a burrito called Mexican for breakfast. But that was SO BIG that I ate only a half, then took another half away. I didn't finish it until the evening that day. It was delicious anyway, and the small coffee and taco (can't remember it clearly) are free. It's worth its price for sure.
2014-07-24,5,Love getting food from here - it's always so good. I love getting their egg, cheese, and bread sandwich and my husband loves the spanish fly!
2014-07-15,4,Signed up to yelp just to review this place. Ordered delivery for lunch today. Two of their chicken selection wraps. Absolutely great and tasty food. Really well done and I will be trying something new next time. Only 4/5 as the delivery was fairly slow (35+ mins).
2014-07-02,5,Delicious food and vegetarian friendly! Friendly staff, quirky ambiance and reasonably priced! I've found my new favorite neighborhood spot.
2014-06-29,4,Wow, pleasantly surprised.  From the outside, this place looks pretty unimpressive and a bit divey, indoors too, but I like a good dive and when the food's this good, all the better!  Great neighborhood vibe, creative (yes, not just another Italian hero shoppe), tasty, and pleasant service.  We did the Groovy Green and Spanish Fly breakfast burritos and they were both delicious, well priced, and again, YUM. Will definitely be back - hurray for Variety & Quality in a city that is in desperate need of more of both.  Kudos.
2014-06-15,4,I live just a few doors down from D's but I just stopped in for the first time a few days ago. It's not that I haven't wanted to try it -- but it's usually dinner time when I don't feel like cooking and want to order food. Most of what they sell is sandwiches and usually I want something more than a sandwich for dinner.I had to run somewhere and needed to pick up breakfast recently so I decided to try one of their breakfast burritos. It was quite good. Really like the fact that they want to encourage the local art scene and they are creative Tweeters. Look forward to going back. Would be likely to order more often if they served more entree-like food for dinner time.
2014-05-27,5,Although I haven't had anything else -- I love the breakfast burritos here, especially the Big Dog!  The spicy hash browns are unique and tasty!
2014-04-29,5,I ordered lunch from there in the middle of the week when I was not feeling well.  I must say, the soups are sensational.  I REALLY liked the veggie chili.....DELISH! The prices are comparable to most other delivery places in town.  This will definitely be added to the short list of places I order from.
2014-02-07,5,Delicious quinoa soup with chipotle and kale and also highly recommend the avocado salad. Love the herb mayonnaise dressing. My favorite delivery place at the moment for good healthy, reasonably priced delicious food
2014-01-12,5,I don't get the fuss. d's rules. Stephen (the owner) is one of the most down to earth people i know in Hoboken. Sundays are for featured musicians who do month long residencies.  Try the honey turkey supreme....so yum!
2013-12-18,5,I like this place. A lot. The guys are awesome, breakfast sandwiches with a small coffee (or if you bring your own resizable container any size within reason) are tasty and the price is right. Good energy, good food and even the patrons seem to be good people...PS. Howie is the best.
2013-12-03,4,Decided to try this place out since it's 2 blocks down the street from my apartment.  Very happy with my decision.  Both times I've been there have been good experiences.  The breakfast wraps are very good, and they come with a small coffee.  Great deal, and great food.  The staff is friendly, and they even had live music on Saturday morning.  There are only 3 tables inside...so it might be tough to get a seat.
2013-11-19,5,My favorite breakfast spot in Hoboken!  I absolutely love the atmosphere and the friendly staff.  When I lived there I was obsessed with the breakfast burritos and could not go a week with out my "Mexicano."  Breakfast was my favorite, however the wraps are also very good. If you go that route I suggest you try the drunken turkey.  They have the delicious homemade sauce that makes it taste great.  Also, if you're into music or art, the owner and manager  are really knowledgeable about events going on in the area.  They are really active in Hoboken and can give you some tips on things to do if you are new to town. Occasionally during the summer, they also have an open mic to support the local musical artists.
2013-10-19,5,Always get seamless never eat there or ever been there but it's fantastic!! Amazing food every single time. Not one complaint! Fast delivery and everything I have ordered so far has been amazing! I order at least once if not twice a week from here for breakfast or brunch!
2013-08-01,4,I'm obsessed with breakfast burritos and my first hungover thought in the morning is typically, where can I get one.  Luckilly, seamless directed me to D's which has a few breakfast burrito options.  I got the appropriately named hangover cure burrito which was tasty and definitely did the trick.  I don't love toasted breakfast burritos but would definitely order it again.  My friend got a bagel with lox, which wasn't anything out of the ordinary, but she enjoyed it.  While delivery took a while, I enjoyed every bite of my burrito
2013-07-28,4,This is a neighborhood joint that I really want to do well. Such a good vibe around the place. The wraps/subs are really great value for what you get. I have only been a few times and it's always been pretty tasty. Last time I had the veggie chilli wrap which was delicious. It was a fairly long wait for it considering I was pretty much the only person in there. But I probably only noticed that as I was running a little late for getting back to work.
2013-07-13,3,I've already written a pretty good review that was filtered out, just wanted to do an update.The food has only gotten better, did the build your own breakfast burrito a little while back and it was spot on.My only complaints are the following:-With any breakfast burrito special you are supposed to get a free small coffee. Now because I ordered in seamless and picked it up, I was informed that I didn't get one. Not a huge deal necessarily. It is clearly stated on their website that its for walk in customers, but when a customer goes out of the way to ask its just a little disappointing. I'm from a small town and for the most part this place reminded me of back home and somewhat small town values where little things like that would be okay. Especially since I really like their coffee I was really looking forward to their Elvis blend. Also, the vibe when I had been here before was always upbeat and chill. Didn't quite feel the same and I don't think the cashier even said one word to me until I asked about the free coffee with burrito purchase. Still love this place and the food has always been great just a little disappointed in the customer service. I work in customer care and my recent visit wasn't the best example of what good customer service was.
2013-05-24,4,Best wraps in town.  Start with any of the roast beef wraps or Soul Full Cafe Classic (chicken pesto).  Too bad they don't serve the dinner crowd.Update Oct 6 - It appears that they stay open for dinner now!  Great news.
2013-05-05,2,We will go back time and time again for the coffee. Haven't had the food yet, wish the place was bigger and had some seating, but coffee ROCKS! -updating my post, the food is awful. Coffee still great!
2013-02-21,2,This place is hit or miss.  Their wraps or burritos are always good, as are their bagels, but they randomly run out of things and don't bother calling you.  They just show up sans items and say "oh we'll credit you back whatever you're missing."  Annoying when you order delivery for 3 people and only 2 get to eat...
2013-01-06,4,I live around the corner and order breakfast from D's all the time. The Famous Hangover Cure burrito is exactly what you want on a Saturday morning, I usually order two. The only negative thing I have noticed is that I actually wind up getting my food faster if I place an online order than if I go there in person.
2012-06-22,1,I should have listened to yelp, but I had a coupon. Not a good enough reason  to try this, but I did. I got food poisoning. Lesson learned.
2012-02-22,2,This off the beaten path little shop on Willow between 9th and 10th is open only for breakfast and lunch.  I have to be honest, I haven't had their lunch yet since I work in the city.  They have local artists hanging on the walls and will feature live acoustic sets from musical artists every once and while.  As for the food, I've only been for breakfast and coffee.  So the coffee is usually decent and hot though the station can get a bit tight with more than 2 people getting coffee.  The breakfast wraps are just passable and can be more on the expensive side.  Being a person who lives on the block though they give a discount so it comes out to be the cost of a normal breakfast $5~.  One big issue I have is that all the eggs are cooked in a microwave, in fact everything is.  I don't even have a microwave in my apartment because I hate them so much. The service and also be very slow at times.  The owner seems like he is doing a nice thing by employing local kids but they are easily distracted and more often than not, I will end up with the wrong food. All and all the only reason I really ever go to this place is if I have no food in my apartment on a Saturday morning and I can't wait for a better option (anything in the neighborhood) to open up.
2012-01-09,4,I tried D's last week for lunch. Fast, courteous service (no high schooler staff). Also, the sandwiches were delicious, hot, tasty, toasted bread... will definitely be going back!Also, I loved the vibe in the restaurant, though I got my food to go (time contraints). The people (customers and staff) were friendly, it was very clean, and there was good music playing. Defintely a plus.
2011-07-04,4,My girlfriend and I love this place. We always get breakfast wraps and are never disappointed. The "Groovy Greens" wrap and the "Hang Over" are great.  The coffee is pretty tasty too- few different flavors, but I recommend the Brooklyn Blend or the Graham Cracker. The owner, Dwight, is usually around and always makes sure to say hi everyone who comes in. It can get busy on the weekends so recommend calling ahead with your order and then waiting a good fifteen before heading over. Overall, great neighborhood place.
2011-05-01,1,Just picked up breakfast - microwaved eggs wtf? Not cool. Review ends there really because there wasn't much else to say. Really upset that I tried D's today.
2011-02-08,1,D's is Hit or Miss... 95% miss. Amazing flavored coffee... none left = MISS Bagel w/ extra cream cheese (b/c ordering it normally had the absolute minimal)... correct bagel this time, but veggy cream cheese = MISS! Bagel w/ egg and cheese... nuked egg in plastic container, over-sprayed w/ pam-like garbage = MISS! I can only go here when I have patience, its been Josh and Eve's, then the Smashery, now D's... still same unbelievably terrible staffing. I rarely drink coffee, but when I do, I try to go to D's. Then I'll only order a bagel if the line is less than 3 people and the owner is working. That way I have a better chance of getting my bagel in less than 20 min. I was there this past Sunday, as I wanted some coffee, and decided on a bagel, and it was the 1st time in this bagel shops existence that the order was right/ satisfying; most likely because the owner made it... took 15 min to order, got it within 15min...but they ran out of change... MISS!  Might have to change that to a 99% chance of MISS if you want more that a coffee. This has the possibility of a good shop, really nice owner, the vibe is cool with local art and music influence, and good bagels. Get rid of 90% of the staff, get a freaking griddle, and someone to man the coffee; otherwise the only customers will be the local artists and musicians that you feature/ promote on the walls.
2010-12-14,1,I'm suspicious about all of these high reviews for this place...might be yelp compromised. They have 3 high school idiots running the joint and they took over 10 mins to make a simple breakfast sandwich with no line. They also asked me multiple times what I ordered and I'd say their food was not even up to Dunkin Donuts breakfast standards. Come for breakfast, leave without your soul.
2010-12-02,5,One of my favorite spots to get bagels in Hoboken. The bagels are coffee are very good, and the selection of wraps is pretty impressive. Usually i'll get an everything bagel with cheddar and spicy hash browns...pressed (not smashed..haha)  They're open pretty late into the afternoon, and are trying a couple of late nights during the weekend.The most important thing to know about this place though, is that the owner, Dwight, is really doing a cool job with the spot. Not only does he have great food, but he's also promoting positivity throughout the store and with his t-shirt business.In addition to that, he also incorporates an artist of the month (which have been awesome thus far) ,and a musical act of the month..which he plays through the in house radio in the cafe. Sometimes he even has live music in the shop. From what I know...most of his employees are people from around the area, and he's tryin' to get 'em off the street, and into a job. I always have great service there. Whenever i'm in the cafe, it seems Dwight is always trying to do something good for Hoboken, and that's really respectable. Next time you're in there, say what's up to Dwight, and tell 'em Brian sent ya.
