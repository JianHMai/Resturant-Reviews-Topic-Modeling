2021-09-18,5,This is a fantastic place for pizza and sandwiches!!  The lady at the counter was super friendly and the food was really great. I'm glad my wife and I came here after having heard of this place for a while. Great gelato as wel
2021-09-16,5,The pizza boxing was unique and different but I had no issue with it as the pizza was delicious! We did a half and half of the spicy pepperoni and margarita. The pepperoni was pretty spicy, a good heat. There was plenty of cheesy goodness on the pizza. The crust held well and leftovers was just as delicious. Would definitely come here again!
2021-09-12,1,The food is good... assuming they actually make it. And if they do make it, it's consistently late. Perpetually understaffed - the experience is not worth the effort it takes to get your food. One time they immediately marked an online order as completed and never fulfilled it. Every other time the food was ready 20-30 minutes after the estimated time. I'm writing this review inside of the restaurant while I wait an extra 20 minutes for 2 egg and cheese bagels. Don't come here until they fix their servicing issues.
2021-09-10,1,We were sent the wrong order and  need to say that the order had a receipt that was TWO DAYS OLD. That's so gross and needs to be repremanded.
2021-09-10,1,Got sent two day old pizza via Uber eats. We didn't even order pizza. This is DISGUSTING
2021-08-14,5,Hidden gem. As original as it can get . Fantastic service fresh ingredients, checks all my requirements. I even got to buy some Italian cookies.
2021-08-08,4,Delicious pizza! My husband and I got the Pala Pizza - a "long stretch of pizza" (30 inches!!!) - with half Queen Margherita and half pepperoni for takeout tonight. It was delicious, especially the fresh basil, and was more than enough for two hungry adults!They also serve breakfast sandwiches, coffee, gelato, and Italian grocery specialties. Can't wait to try the coffee and breakfast sandwiches sometime soon!
2021-08-04,1,I recently placed and order for a pizza pie. It was scheduled to arrive between 2:10 and 2:20 I called at 2:25 and was told it was on its way.  If it just left it's about 15 min to get delivered. I called back at 2:45 and told them to cancel the order. He acknowledge the cancelation. At 3:30 my front door bell rings, I was on a business call and couldn't answer. I went to the front door and there was a pie and a brown paper bag. I called back and told them that I do not want the pie. The guy said not to worry he would refund me. 4 days later I have not received a confirmation of credit. In the brown paper bag there was a note: sorry for the late delivery, inside there was something that looked like  brownies, I bit into it and it tasted like marzipan, which i hate. I threw it in the garbage. Clearly the person that told me that it was.on it's way and said they would credit me lied. If it arrived well over an hour w the desert they never made my pizza. This level of dishonesty drives.me crazy. Not very reputable and that.was the first and last time I will order from this place.
2021-07-27,5,I've only ever gotten delivery from Alessio's but have had no Delivery Issues (everything has been accurate and very quick). Paninis are fantastic.Definitely one of the best Italian/Pizza places in Hoboken.
2021-07-10,5,Best slice in town. A perfect slice. Only $3. Can take it to sit outside. Can't go wrong! Can't wait to try the rest!
2021-06-23,5,Alessios is such a great place. Cute deli environment and we really love their coffee and breakfast sandwiches. Met the owner and he is so sweet and welcoming. Would recommend to anyone in the area.
2021-06-14,5,Alessio's is an excellent addition to the Hoboken pizza scene. Their standard pies are as good as any, but the real standout is their 'pala style' pizza, which is large, thin, and sort of oblong in shape. The crust on the pala style is a little lighter and crispier than normal pizza crust, and it is just great. As far as I know, you can't get this style of pizza anywhere else in Hoboken, and it is well worth a try. Bonus: If you order it for carryout, it comes in a comically large pizza box. Aside from the excellent pizza, they have a small selection of Italian grocery items which is also nice. And they make a great iced mocha as well.
2021-05-28,1,Order never arrived, and no one would answer the phone to even give an ETA or notice of cancelation.
2021-05-25,5,Everything ya want in an Italian deli, but ya also get breakfast sandwiches, specialty pastries, gelato, pizza and great coffee creations, what's not to love? Went with "The Hoboken" panini this time around, which has prosciutto di Parma, porchetta, arugula, roasted peppers, fresh mutz and balsamic that was AWESOME. Crunchy outside and super soft inside (bread is incredible and tastes homemade/very well may be), perfectly balanced with flavors and amount of toppings (key for a good sandwich). Loved it. Had to get a couple mini chocolate (Nutella) Bombolones for dessert, ugh so good. Just go already!
2021-05-13,5,We order takeout from here at least once a week. Everything we have ordered we have loved - fresh salads, sandwiches (FYI amazing bread!), and unreal pastas!
2021-05-06,4,Great service, very quick. The individual behind the counter was very nice and friendly. The gelato (I had vanilla + hazelnut) was pretty good. I will be back.
2021-04-25,5,Just to reiterate how great this place is. I ordered a breakfast sandwich and coffee yesterday morning from here... when my order arrived I did notice that my coffee was missing, but I was so hungry I cared more about eating! Not even 10 min later.. the owner showed up to my place to deliver the forgotten coffee! He walked from the shop to my place to deliver as soon as he realized the driver forgot.This is an owner who cares deeply about his business and customers and the reason I will continue to support.
2021-04-19,4,I had not tried Alessio's before but I do know this location has had a lot of turnover with businesses over the years. Glad to see Alessio's is doing well over here.  I went with the nonna's pizza since I love this style of pizza. It was a little doughier than I would have thought.  I could tell off the bat because the pizza is heavier than it looks. It did have good flavor but not my favorite grandma pie. The capri sandwich (chicken sandwich) definitely stuck out from other sandwiches in the area. The chicken was moist and all the flavors worked. If I had one critique it was that there was not enough sun dried tomatoes on it.  If its going to be on there put enough for me to notice! The only thing I wouldn't reorder is the caesar salad. It was basic and nothing to it. Skip it. Alessio's had serviceable food at a good price. Did anything blow me away? No. But the sandwich was good and pizza did the trick. Give this place a shot.
2021-04-14,4,Got delivery. grilled chicken sandwich  with pesto and mozzarella and it was delicious. Taking off one star for not poking a hole in the French fry container amd they steamed and got soggy. But, the fries were tasty so I imagine when they are fresh they are delicious. My son got a margherita pizza and loved it.
2021-04-05,4,Excellent capricciosa pizza, with a good amount of toppings and a perfect crust. The crust has the right amount of chewiness and bounce, with hints of smoke and a good transition from the middle to the edge. The tiramisu is also delicious.Temperature could have been better when arriving at my door, but a quick spin in the microwave takes care of that.
2021-03-06,5,This is a really great place I like to go for my morning coffee and a small bite. I've also had their pizza, grandmas style. It's delish. Everything they make is a hit, so it's worth the trip. Go check it out. All the staff is very friendly too. Huge plus.
2021-01-31,5,First time here and it's very good. The breakfast sandwich was delicious. We ordered one eggs and cheese on a roll and one caprese sandwich on a ciabatta bread. Very fresh, made on a spot and tasty. Right after we order bombolone and cannoli with espresso and I felt like in Italy. (Home sweet home) He owner is Italian and he was really nice. I highly recommend this place. Very cute place in Hoboken, for sure I'll come here again. See you soon, a presto
2021-01-30,1,The picture when I ordered online vs. what I got. What comes after disappointed?  Would not have ordered from here had I known.
2021-01-19,5,Alessio's is an Italian cafe, yet its most popular Yelp item is the Spicy Texas Sandwich. Sure, why not? It falls broadly within the genre of deli breakfast sandwiches, yet throws in new twists with avocado and chipotle aioli.For an appetizer I got a slice of the Diavola Pizza. It's excellent that they offer this on four sizes. The spicy sopressata is so great you may find it tough to return to pepperoni. My Hoboken radius has often encompassed waterfront, Washington and 1st if I'm feeling adventurous so I"m glad I found Alessio's during the remedial geography lessons of my recent hikes.
2021-01-16,5,I don't understand how anyone could possibly give Alessio's less than five stars. Let me assure you, I have eaten so much pizza around the New York City and Hoboken area in my life time (some people might say the most pizza ever eaten by one individual), and last night I got a pizza delivered to me that was one of the best I have ever tried. It was hot when it got here and it was unbelievable. We got the Spicy Diavola. Two of us ate the entire thing in one sitting. We had NO CHOICE THOUGH IT WAS THAT GOOD.  Do it. Now.
2021-01-12,5,Consistently quality coffee and food. The owner is a great and energetic guy who you can tell is passionate about his business. The food- Pizza is always consistent, the sandwiches are all great from what I've tried, and I'm a huge fan of their wings. Haven't tried their breakfast items but everyone else reviewing has mostly positives. Their dessert options are wide and great. Coffee- Solid, solid coffee. The price is what you can expect from the area.
2021-01-01,5,Honestly, there is so much care and attention in everything and every ingredient on the menu. The gelato is my absolute favorite... but don't sleep on those bomboloni! Wonderful local spot, great addition to the neighborhood.
2020-12-20,5,This place is amazing! I live a few doors down & Alessio's has been a staple. All the food is so good and the workers are so friendly.
2020-12-13,5,Alessio's is the perfect spot for all your breakfast/lunch needs. We've had their breakfast sandwiches, their pastries, their pizza, and their coffee and every single item has always been delicious. We suggest the spicy Texas or the Diavola pizza!! Inside the store they also sell a bunch of gourmet Italian products. They have outdoor seating available that is quaint and cute. Also the people who work there are always warm and welcoming. We will definitely be back!
2020-12-11,5,Best cold brew in Hoboken! and their sandwiches (both lunch and breakfast) are fantastic. Luca the owner is so warm and friendly, and always gives our pup a complimentary "pupaccino" which she LOVES (sometimes we end up their unintentionally bc she needs her fix!!). Luca also stocks lots of cool Italian sauces, pastas, products etc. Great addition to Hoboken!!
2020-11-15,4,If you live in Hoboken and haven't been to Alessio's yet, you're missing out. This is the cutest spot for your coffee, tea or even gelato fix. The patio is the first thing to make note of. They have plenty of outdoor seating if you're looking to switch up your work space or have coffee and catch up with a friend on the weekend. I'm typically visiting for my chai latte or the gelato, but the menu has much more than that. They offered breakfast sandwiches, pizza, breads and even pasta. You can also bring your favorite beverage as they're BYOB! They recently added a small Italian market style shopping area in the store. Here, you can pick up pastas, sauces and bruschetta. Now the gelato - my first experience was with the tiramisu. It was out of the world. Since then I've had pistachio and cookies and cream, and let me tell you I'm never disappointed. If you're in Hoboken, this is a must visit!
2020-11-11,5,I love this place! Everything I have tried is amazing and the people who work there make the experience even better. Do yourself a favor and try this adorable establishment ASAP.
2020-11-08,4,I found this place on Instagram and was super excited to try! I ordered a spicy Texas sandwich, a Capri lunch sandwich, and two hazelnut iced lattes. The only problem was the wait, I got there 20 min later and still had to wait another 10-15 minutes. They're not prepared and well staffed for busy Sunday mornings. but the food was delicious and everyone there seemed to be returning customers who love the place. The owner is also extremely friendly and builds connections with his local customers which I love. would come back and try their gelato, pizza and other items!
2020-10-14,5,Not only do they have the best fresh mozz pizza in Hoboken, but they're so respectful in packaging and sealing their food for delivery (no spills & no anxiety or worry of contamination during Covid)
2020-10-14,5,Love this place! I've had lots of lunch sandwiches and breakfast sandwiches and all have been excellent. Also, the gelato is fantastic.
2020-10-01,3,Wellll... ordered delivery from here today. I also did yesterday. I had better quality yesterday I'm sad to say.I ordered a Parma panini (tomatoes, mozzarella, prosciutto, arugula and basil), egg sandwich with porchetta, and the four piece chicken fingers. Delivery arrived a little late. Food was warm. No spills, packed neatly.The Parma panini was the best thing we ordered but it was off today. Less meat and cheese today than yesterday. Flavor is great. Just wish for the price point there was more (like yesterday!) and that they are consistent. Everything is fresh.The egg sandwich was a nice size. The egg was cooked perfect. I ordered it with cheddar and they used American cheese. Disappointed. The porchetta was very minimal. Barely any. See photo. It was okay. My boyfriend didn't like it. So we wouldn't order it again.The chicken fingers were not crispy when they arrived. We like the crunch. Average honey mustard. We wouldn't order these again. They are better at pig and parrot.It was worth a try though, right?
2020-09-29,5,I live right next door and I love this spot! The staff are all so friendly and their coffee, breakfast and dinner food are all delicious! So glad that they opened up! Will be back for sure!
2020-09-26,5,How can you not love this place? Amazing food and coffee, great service, wonderful atmosphere. This little Hoboken cafe is the best!
2020-09-25,5,So happy we tried this place! We got the Diavolo Pizza, Mini Chocolate Bombolone, and vanilla and hazelnut gelato. This pizza was out of this world! Thin crust and the right about of spice. My favorite was the mini chocolate bombolones. I could probably eat 10 of these. They arrived hot and filled with Nutella.. Sooooo good
2020-09-19,4,Great local spot in Hoboken. They have a great selection of gelatos to choose from. If you're coming here for breakfast, I'd recommend the morning wrap. It's really good.
2020-09-16,2,I really want to like Alessio's since they have such positive social media presence, but my two experiences there have both been misses. Food hasn't been great and the service has been very slow. My first experience was over the summer and picked up their morning wrap with egg bacon cheese and avocado. I ordered ahead and still had to wait a very long time. Sandwich didn't live up to the hype and the avocado wasn't ripe - hard as a rock.  My second experience was tonight for a casual dinner. We were only ones there when we ordered. We each got a slice of nonna's pie and an order of the  Rigatoni Siciliano to share to stay. Our slices came out quickly but weren't that hot. I brought it back in to be heated up but then they forgot about my slice so I had to go back and get it since they would've just let it burn.   Pizza was just okay. I probably wouldn't get pizza from there again. It took a long time for our pasta to finally come out. When it did, she brought it out in a to go container and forgot we were staying. Pasta wasn't great. Eggplant wasn't cooked well and was tough.  It upset both of our stomachs. Apparently the chef didn't show up tonight. I decided to get a rainbow cookie to go while I paid.  Overpriced for a cookie that weighed only an ounce. 2.50 an ounce would be $40 a pound. Cookie was good but they should really sell them by the lb. I got the runt of the batch.
2020-09-11,5,I have gotten their pizza for dinner, wrap for breakfast, and coffee on the go and all have been amazing. This is hands down one of my favorite places in Hoboken. I highly recommend everyone goes! Also, the people who work there are SUPER friendly and welcoming!
2020-08-31,4,Great selection of gelatos and food. I love the pistachio gelato and the hazelnut gelato. I've also tried their prosciutto panini with balsamic and arugula and it was so good. Great small, local spot.
2020-08-23,5,Amazing sandwiches with perfect ratios and cooked to perfection. Owner also is very friendly and helpful, super passionate about his food :)
2020-08-14,5,Love this spot. So friendly and so yummy! I get their iced coffee once or twice a week- love their iced coffee. I also got a free sample of their fresh mozz, Amazing!! I have yet to try their pizza but I had a breakfast sandwich (so great) and a lunch panini (also amazing) and the food was excellent. Very cute spot to sit outside and in a nice quiet location close to town. Must try!
2020-08-09,5,Great new place in Hoboken! They have a small selection of gelato but the ice cream quality is terrific. Would highly recommend.
2020-07-29,5,Came here for the first time over the weekend for lunch. Great socially distanced seating outdoors, shaded from the hot sun by umbrellas and the building itself. We had the morning wrap and a pepperoni panini, both of which were delicious! Quality ingredients and lovely staff. Solid cold brew. Will definitely come again!
2020-07-19,5,This place is amazing, everything we try is delicious from their paninis to their pizza. They even give our dog a puppuccino every time we visit. Really nice people working there, you can tell they truly care about their food and customer service. Love this place!
2020-07-12,5,5 stars for Alessio's, it's consistently delicious. The pizza is one of the best in town, thin with a crunchy crust and very tastey sauce. The prosciutto de parm panini is a household favorite, and today we also tried the bruschetta. All absolutely delicious.
2020-07-11,5,Stopped here for a croissant and a sandwich (had the Milano). Both were excellent and the owner, who helped us, was very nice. We'll be back!
2020-07-09,5,Went here this morning with my boyfriend. We got 2 cold brew coffees and he got the spicy Texas sandwich and I got the morning wrap and everything was AMAZING. Ridiculously fresh and delicious. I could drink the pesto sauce that was on the wrap; it tasted like there was a grandma back there that just finished making it from scratch haha But what really made it even better of an experience is that the owner was so sweet and cared so much to make everything special. We ate it out front where they have cute tables setup. Will definitely be a regular here. Wishing them well deserved success opening up in these tough times! Update: we are now addicted to this place. I've lived in Hoboken for 4 years and I can honestly say this is one of the best places in town. The cold brew is hands down the best cold brew I've ever had as well. I really don't write reviews normally, but I could write a novel about how good this food is. I can't wait to try everything on the menu.
2020-07-03,5,I wish I could give this perfect bistro 10 stars! Luca, who is the owner, is a lovely man who is incredibly friendly and accommodating. Not only is the food their fantastic (highly recommend the parma panini) but their gelato is amazing and imported from Italy!  During my most recent visit, I ordered a donut to go, but because Luca and I were talking, it wasn't placed in my to-go order bag and I didn't realize this until I got home. When I called just to let him know, Luca INSISTED on coming straight to me to deliver the donut. He pulled up on his Vespa within 5 minutes and was charming as ever. I highly recommend this wonderful new corner spot! I studied abroad in Rome when I was younger and whenever I visit, I feel like I am back in Italy. Grazi Luca!
2020-06-24,5,Such a great new addition to the community!  We needed a warm and inviting food establishment with super friendly staff and amazing food.  Their breakfast includes traditional sammies like egg and cheese - and a wide variety of omelettes.  The pizza and the paninnis: excellent. The gelato:  Off the charts! If you're in Hoboken, go to Alessio's for breakfast, lunch or dinner!  They've got it all - and it's all delicious!
2020-06-20,5,Stopped here with my pup for breakfast today. Unbelievably good food. I got a breakfast sandwich on a fresh made croissant, and it's leagues better than what you'll get at the bagel shops in Hoboken. No microwaved eggs here, fresh ingredients freshly prepared for you. One of the best I've ever had. The owner also gave my pup a cup of whipped cream as I waited which she rated 5 stars as well.  Definitely will be back for lunch/dinner and gelato.
2020-06-16,5,Just discovered this place today and I'm really happy about it. They specialize in everything! The owner is from a small town minutes away from where my nana grew up in Italy and it's as authentic as it gets!
2020-06-14,5,Gelato is  (fire emoji x2)) As per my man inside, shipped from Italy weekly. Very nice man also. Will patron frequently. Don't @ me
2020-06-08,5,A cute little place in Hoboken. The business seemed just opened a few months ago. I had the hazelnut gelato and vanilla gelato. Both tasted very fresh and creamy. While I was inside of the store, I smelt the fresh pizza. I will definitely like to go back or order delivery to try it.
2020-06-05,5,Love this place. Have only gone in for beverages but it's always been a great experience. Great quality coffee drinks at a fraction of the price of nearby competitors.
2020-05-28,5,This place is awesome! We always get the cold brew and the lemon gelato. They always give my dogs puppuchinos so they love coming here too :)
2020-05-24,5,Really fantastic! Staff is incredibly pleasant! We got 3 scoops of gelato. It was fantastic. Eli (sp?) Was so kind and friendly, he saw me eyeing a a slice of pizza and he offered it to us to try. This was an incredibly kind gesture. It was mushroom and onion. My son who is finicky fell in love with it and now that is a requirement for any pie that we get.The sauce was unique and very tasty. The crust was crisp, crunchy and still airy. I definitely recommend trying it! We live in a world where pizza snobbery has become intense. Remember its pizza! It's good most of the time! Here, it's a bit different and makes you want more!!We ordered a meatball parm which comes on their super tasty bread. Gobbled up just like that. Heading there in a little bit!
2020-02-26,5,Alessio's Cafe has a great and authentic food selection. They have a really large menu with a lot of different choices between pizzas and pastas, salads sandwiches and more. They also have a barista who makes excellent drinks, nonalcoholic, such as lattes. I had a tasty frozen Nutella beverage alongside my housemade gnocchi and pesto. My husband tried one of the pizzas. We both enjoyed trying both entrees. The food was so rich and delicious, I will definitely have to come back here and try more soon- especially looking forward to gelato when it gets a bit warmer- any day now. They also have a comfortable space for seating which is nice and a little bit off the beaten path but still accessible from public transportation and just off Washington street in Hoboken, which is one of the main roads. I was also able to find meter street parking right there.
2020-02-24,4,Excellent breakfast sandwich. Very clean and looks to be very well maintained. The only reason I didn't award a 5th star is that my order took a good 10 minutes to complete when I was the only customer. Not a major gig but if I was on my way to work I wouldn't have been pleased. I will definitely be back to try lunch..!! A very nice addition to the neighborhood...
2020-02-23,5,Favorite new local spot in Hoboken. Great food, modern and trendy decor, and friendly staff. Owner Luca was super friendly and very accommodating to me and my toddler. He even cut up her pizza into bite sized pieces for her! Sammies and gelato looked delish. Will definitely be back for some more!
2020-02-15,5,What a GREAT addition to the neighborhood!  I've lived in the area for over 10 years and this location has seen a constant rotation of mediocre businesses. Alessio is the exception. The lattes are very good and my daughter loves the mini Nutella donuts. We've enjoyed pizza and breakfast sandwiches and haven't been disappointed once.  Everything is delicious. Plus, Luca, behind the counter is very charming and efficient.
2020-02-03,5,I am so grateful for the delicious lentil soup I had today. I had a cold and was looking for a legume rich, healthy and satisfying soup. In fact, I was searching for lentil soup. I love beans and lentils but am only now learning how to cook with them now after becoming vegetarian. Lentils are a great source of iron among other things.We were greeted warmly by the chef Pasquale and Jimmy. Pasquale told me he made homemade lentil soup that morning! So I ordered this and it was so delicious and nourishing. It was an Italian version with a tomato base and carrots, garlic, and tomatoes (I was used to the French version). It was perfectly seasoned and was bubbling hot and could not be better!  I ordered two more to go. Their hot chocolate was milky, not too sweet and the quality of chocolate was very good. Pasquale was so kind. He made me sautéed garlic vegetables (off the menu). Will be back to try their pizza and Beyond Meat burger, and for gelato and Italian dessert.
2020-01-26,5,My husband and I both had a latte - one decaf, one regular  - and they were very good! Alessio's is one block from Church Square Park and a great location since we often cut through the park to get downtown and to the PATH. The coffee was much more affordable than the competition nearby and the staff was very friendly. They have some good combo deals and coffees and bakery items and a full menu of breakfast, lunch, and dinner options. We didn't try the gelato, but it looked really good!! The store front and interior is really nicely put together and a great addition to the neighborhood. It is a cozy spot and has WiFi and good seating if you wanted to bring work to do. Definitely look forward to trying it again.
2020-01-12,5,This cafe is awesome!  What a great addition to the neighborhood.  The espresso is really high quality and I can't wait to try all the gelato flavors.  Really solid slice of pizza too.  I'll be back!
2020-01-11,5,Brand new little cafe in the area! Has a variety of options from breakfast pastries, pizza and gelato. We tried a slice of pizza and it was tasty!A great add to those in the middle of Hoboken and don't want to go to washington street for a quick bite
