2021-09-13,4,This is one of our regular Hoboken lunch spots. It's a small, narrow space. It has limited outdoor seating, which isn't great, but it has great food. Its menu is funky, in a good sense: pesto on a sandwich? It really works. Great coffee, not made in a factory, but literally by hand by the staff.  Wide array of teas. Very pleasant overall. Delicious food. Nice setting. We'll certainly go back.
2021-09-07,5,I've lived in Hoboken for a decade and I've tried every breakfast spot under the sun. Either if it's for a friend visiting town or I just need my routine morning coffee, the Little Grocery is always at the top of my list. You can't go wrong with stopping in for breakfast at Hoboken's best breakfast experience!In a town where Baby Gap and Lululemon have replaced the local neighborhood spots, Little Grocery is a timeless gem that helps Hoboken retain it's authentic feel. The food is outstanding (literally anything you order), the service is the most attentive in town, the atmosphere is relaxing and genuine and the coffee is sourced from one of the best shops in NYC (Kobrick)!It pains me to let the secret out that the Little Grocery does have, as their menu naming suggests, "Hoboken's Best Egg Sandwich." Whether you get it on a bagel (which you should), croissant, or a roll, you will not be disappointed. I typically get either taylor ham or sausage with egg and cheese and I will never tire of either. These bagels and coffees are always the highlights of my weekend. The eggs are fluffy and the bagels are light enough to not slow you down for the rest of your day. I have legitimately never had a bad or rushed bagel from LG.The atmosphere and service are unparalleled. I walk in feeling like Norm from Cheers and it's evident with every visit that the staff builds this type of relationship with new and frequent patrons that stop by for their morning coffees. The music and aromas always pique my excitement and appetite upon every visit! The personal neighborhood experience does sometimes come at the cost of a wait but only during heavily congested times. With that said, the ambience, atmosphere and food make the wait worth it!
2021-09-06,5,My roommate and I had a great breakfast here Sunday morning! The restaurant is simply adorable, with a huge mouth-watering menu and friendly staff. My friend and I both had amazing egg sandwiches with iced coffee (that the staff graciously refilled for us). Definitely think this will be our new go-to spot!
2021-09-03,5,I moved to Hoboken in 2015 and knew a few people in the area who I asked for general suggestions about breakfast spots. They all told me to go to Little Grocery and I'm happy they did.Amazing breakfast sandwiches - my go to is the ham, egg, and cheese on everything. I go at least once a weekend for this. Coffee is pretty outstanding too, both hot and iced.  I've never had an issue with quality, as it's always the same guy making the sandwich. I usually call my order in ahead of time or if I'm not in a rush will place my order, get a coffee, go for a walk on the waterfront, and then come back for it.The salads and lunch sandwiches are fantastic, as well. For salads, I've tried the Kitchen Sink and Greek - both are great. As far as lunch sandwiches are concerned, I've tried the Parma and Tuna sub and recommend each of them.
2021-09-03,5,I get a latte and a muffin here for breakfast multiple times a week, and it's the best part of my day. The staff is so kind and friendly. The coffee is great. And I'd always rather spend my money at a small local business than a Starbucks. Highly recommend if you live in the area, but also if you're visiting!
2021-08-14,2,I have been here twice for breakfast sandwiches, the first time I didn't know better and  the second time was because my car was parked across the street and needed something to eat and fast. After my first experience I swore I'd never be back but I gave them another shot. What a waste. First time I ordered a ham, egg and cheese sandwich which cost me more than $7 for an ok sandwich. Not bad but certainly not worth over $7. The second time I ordered just an egg and cheese sandwich which was supposed to be $5.50 but they must have screwed up my order because they charged me $7.70 for the sandwich which again was nothing memorable and in no way worth that much money. I will NEVER return.
2021-08-07,4,The sandwiches remind me of an upscale version of the ones my Mom used to give me. They are on the smaller side but they are quality. I got one with chicken and it was tender and juicy. The pesto type sauce on it complimented the sandwich well. I think they make homemade lemonade since it has the Little Grocery label on it. It was refreshing and worked well with the sandwich. This is unassuming shop that packs a punch. I ordered delivery and it came quickly. Nothing else you can ask for.
2021-06-23,5,Cannot recommend enough!!! My favorite place ever. Been to hundreds of coffee shops in my lifetime and their cappuccino is by far the best - out of this world. Boyfriend loves the egg sandwiches too.
2020-11-07,2,I'm not THAT picky and try to give places the benefit of the doubt, but this was my second "less than stellar" order from here. I went in for a simple breakfast sandwich and was disappointed by the entire experience. I had gone here before and thought it was mediocre but passable so I gave it a second chance.A bacon egg and cheese with salt, pepper, and ketchup shouldn't really be a difficult thing to get right. Roll was stale and the sandwich was lukewarm and it was like $7? I'm pretty sure it was a stale grocery store roll, as I saw no provisions for baking anything they sell. Oh, and apparently paying in cash was some horrible inconvenience for the staff here.TL;DR - Bagels on the Hudson makes a significantly better breakfast sandwich and it's worth the wait. Even O'bagel is better. Tried this place twice and I'm officially done.
2020-11-07,4,Great sandwiches but several times I've had an order not right - one time cheese was missing, another time the egg, another time the basil pesto. Everything is meticulously typed online so I'm not sure if it's a certain person that messes up the orders. Frustrating... otherwise would give it 5 stars.
2020-09-23,5,It's funny, I gave the former downtown location 4 stars, yet find the current spot to be even better. Strong Kobrick coffee is always a win, but what truly sets this spot apart is the care that goes into each order. Yes it takes time. No it's not cheap. But I'd be damned if I said that it wasn't worth the time and cash. I've gotten the veggie omelet on multiple occasions and at many spots in town, the veggies are raw or undercooked. Here, everything is sautéed and that extra time and care spent means a truly epic omelet. Another fun fact is everything is cooked out where all customers can see. The fresh ingredients and sanitation practices here are top notch as well. Truly a five star experience!
2020-07-21,5,Best breakfast sandwiches on Washington Street! I recommend the sausage, egg, and cheese on a croissant! I've had it about 50 times and order it almost every weekend.
2020-06-21,1,I ordered 2 breakfast sandwiches through seamless. The order sent was wrong and on calling the restaurant, they were defiant that it's my fault. I should call seamles, get a refund, and place another order.  Essentially, the customer has to do all the work for their mistake. The management needs a reminder that they're in business because of the customer. No wonder because of their attitude the other location is closed.  Good food, terrible customer experience and extremely poor management/employee attitude. My recommendation - do not order from here.
2020-06-05,5,I can't say enough good things about this place! Their breakfast sandwiches are arguably the best in Hoboken - they get their bagels from Hoboken Hot Bagels and their eggs and toppings are perfectly cooked on a hot plate (not microwaved like other places). Their omelette though are really where they shine. They use fresh ingredients and fully cook everything (no raw onions here!) into a delightful omelette that is worth the wait! I highly recommend the veggie omelette, and their coffee (both iced and hot) is fantastic. This is the place to go for delicious food and friendly service.
2020-06-01,5,This food is amazing! It is now mine and my boyfriends favorite place for a go to sandwich! Great customer service, food is always good and the staff is very sweet. The only somewhat off thing is that sometimes the ingredients used can be a little inconsistent, but I truly believe that's only because they always use fresh ingredients! Don't hesitate to go over, especially for a sandwich.
2020-03-08,4,When want a better breakfast food I come here instead of Starbucks.  They actually make the breakfast sandwich instead of rehearing a pre made sandwich.   They do a lot with a couple of hot plates and small pans.  Have not had many items but the eggs sandwiches on bagels are good.  The brioche French toast I found a bit soggy as find that an issue with thick sliced French toast as either dry or soggy.   Coffees are okay and usually served in real cups if staying there to eat.  Can go old school with the news as keep New York time in paper form.  Seats are cafe style and not the restaurant sink in types see at some coffee shops.
2020-02-27,5,My heart nearly broke in two when I saw their downtown location had closed, but little did I know that they had a sister spot all the way uptown. All is good again. My heart is fine, thanks! The space is cozy and lined with tables and art all over the walls. You pour your own water and chat with the owner while you wait for your food. You'll feel like you've been friends with him for years. Just a heads up the wait can sometimes take awhile, but it's only because of how much care goes into each order. I always get the same thing: bacon, egg and cheese and it is honestly one of my favorite breakfast sandwiches, ever. He makes the whole thing into a scramble and it just is cooked so perfectly and has so much flavor. There are a ton of great breakfast sandwich spots in Hoboken, but they are the best. Oh, and the coffee is great as well. I've only gotten drip, but it is strong and bold and just the way I like it.
2020-01-25,4,A very cozy and delicious Breakfast/Lunch place in the neighborhood. The Breakfast Sandwiches are outstanding and the other sandwiches are really good. The staff is very friendly and the service is spot on. Since it is a small place, it can take a while to get your order on the weekends due to its popularity, restaurant size, and the care that they put into preparing your food. I haven't had coffee/lattes here, but they seem to serve them  pretty fast. A lot of people order coffee so it must be good.I usually take my food out, but the restaurant setup is comfortable with good music that most folks should enjoy
2020-01-08,2,Service has grown worse (a shame for a small cafe), and I routinely get the wrong items in orders (wrong bagels, missing muffins, etc). Out of the last 5 Uber Eats deliveries, I've only gotten precisely what I ordered once. On the second to last order, they were missing the muffin and included a note that a refund was issued, but when I checked, they didn't even refund the full price of the muffin (or the tax on it), so I had to dispute it with Uber. And on other recent orders, they just choose a random bagel type to include in the order if they don't have your bagel. Why not a simple phone call to make sure the new bagel choice is OK? The last order was almost entirely wrong except for the coffee (the wrong bagel, the wrong fillings, and the wrong muffin). When I went to call them, they didn't answer the phone. I also used to be able to call ahead in the morning on weekdays for pickups to avoid service issues so that the breakfast sandwich was ready when I got there, but lately, one of the newer guys working there (who is cold to customers) almost never answers the phone. Insult to injury: I've seen this guy not using gloves while he makes the sandwiches and then taking people's cash without washing his hands. Like other reviewers, I want to love this place, and two of the employees are really friendly! But the inconsistency (especially when placing an order on Uber Eats) makes it impossible to give a good rating.
2019-12-09,5,Homemade specialties, great coffee, and captivating art. Little Grocery is small and cozy, and offers a warm vibe that no one else in Hoboken can replicate. Definitely recommend this hidden gem.
2019-09-25,5,My favorite little cafe in Hoboken . A cozy space with beautiful decor ,  almost makes you feel like a cafe in the west village . Everyone is always friendly , and more than happy to greet each client . They carry breads and croissants from Balthazar , so all of their sandwiches are delicious !  They also have great coffee /espresso drinks .  The food is fresh and always delicious , and keeps me coming back frequently .
2019-08-26,2,So want this place to be great, it's a locally owned place with good food.  I've tried this place a few times over the last couple of years, and the service is just consistently bad.
2019-08-15,5,This place is absolutely incredible! It's homey and cute but also trendy and sophisticated. Also the guy at the front is so welcoming and friendly.
2019-08-02,5,Excited to discover this gem in a part of Hoboken I assumed lacked a smaller-scale sandwich/salad spot. Most establishments surrounding it appear to be formal sit-down restaurants, so it was good to find a place I could dine casually on my own. Also has a full coffee bar, and lovely staff. Will definitely return.
2019-06-17,1,I ordered a "Double Thick French Quiche" to serve at a brunch party for $38. It was overcooked and dry to the point it was inedible. Additionally, nowhere on the Breakfast Lunch Catering menu does it mention that this is a crustless (gluten-free) quiche. I am extremely disappointed in the quality of food and even more disappointed in the customer service.
2019-06-08,1,Definitely not going back. The staff is quite unfriendly, this really ruined the whole experience. We ordered french toast for my 4 year old, and it was gooey and uncooked in the middle and over cooked and charred on the outside. I was told that's how french toast is supposed to be. Sure....
2019-05-12,4,Cute breakfast spot. We came early on Sunday (before 10am) and it wasn't packed. We all ordered bfast sandwiches and cappuccinos. All the sandwiches were on point. Loved the fluffy eggs in my sandwich! Unfortunately, my cappuccino was not that great. It was kinda blah and I'll stick to regular coffee next time. Great place to get a tasty sandwich after a night out. Coffee was 4ish and the sandwich was 6ish.
2019-03-30,1,Used to be good but horrible service now. You'll likely wait 20-30 minutes before they even acknowledge you. No defined system of any line or order and also very unclean. Go to Chocopain or Hudson Coffee instead, you won't regret it.
2019-03-01,5,One downtown and now uptown!  This place is my favorite breakfast take out shop.  The quality of the food is unsurpassed.  The bread from Balthazar is a nice addition.
2019-01-09,3,It's a cute little shop. However there are quite a few places around which are much cheaper.
2018-12-30,1,I really do love this place but I've placed two orders online and neither was right. One was from Grub Hub and the other was from Uber Eats so it has to be this place messing up my order. Why does this keep happening? I tried to call to tell them about this mistake (called both the uptown and downtown location) but neither would make it right for me. They said I would have to come in or call the delivery service. This is really upsetting.
2018-07-20,1,I loved this place but had a terrible experience and breakfast this morning. They had no clue what they were doing and messed up our orders. Plus they ran out of their toast which is the reason why I came in and were rude about it. Never coming back!
2018-07-14,4,Came in on a Saturday afternoon after hearing about this place from a close friend. It was quiet, but peaceful.Only two employees --an older woman and a younger girl--were running the kitchen, which at this time of day, was salads and sandwiches. I ordered a Granny panini (turkey, Brie, and Granny Smith apples on multigrain) and the younger girl recommended their raspberry iced tea as a drink. The sandwich was satisfying and tasted homemade, as if I made a panini in my own kitchen. The sandwich was perfectly balanced: not too much or too little of anything and easy to eat. However, I was impressed by the raspberry iced tea, which was sweet without any added sugar or syrup. Refreshing on a hot day!Overall, I enjoyed my meal here and will have to come back for breakfast!
2018-06-26,5,I have been coming to this place for a few months now. The breakfast sandwiches are amazing as their coffee and lattes are as well. The chocolate chocolate chip muffins are great too. Highly recommend
2018-06-24,5,Great spot to dine in or take out. Often find myself here for breakfast on the weekends. Everything is made fresh and you can create a sandwich to your taste or choose one from the board. Love getting an egg sandwich on a croissant, such a delicious change of pace. They also offer bagels, rolls or multigrain toast. Pictured is spinach, bacon and egg on a croissant.
2018-06-15,4,I like that The Little Grocery offers a lot of options but takes time to make everything to order. My wife especially loved this place when we lived close by.My last visit I got a bagel with cream cheese, salmon,and capers for a bit over $5. It was great! Honestly I have never had anything here I did not like. FYI they do takes cards.
2018-06-02,1,$7.25 for 2 slices of bagged bread with an egg, slice of Swiss, and a few spinach leaves. Won't be back.
2017-12-28,5,Great breakfast sandwiches and coffee. Nice service and very cute place! Prices are very good and yes ...it will take a little longer than normal because they make everything from scratch...worth the wait.
2017-11-18,1,Came in for the first time today and given how small the place is it's slightly disorganized! Also wouldn't hurt for the staff to be a bit more pleasant- the gentleman at the front collect payment barely said thank you or even smokes at customers Being a small place in Hoboken if you want regular customers- I would recommend a bit of hospitalitySmiling doesn't cost anything!
2017-10-12,2,Hugely disappointed by my breakfast sandwiches here. A few weekends ago decided to stop by to grab some quick breakfast, the shop opens at 8AM on Saturdays but no one opened the store till a few minutes past 8. And then took several minutes to unload the bakery deliveries etc before we could place our order. There was only one person working - taking orders, making food and coffee. Ordered 2 egg and bacon sandwiches one on a bagel other on a croissant. Bagel was not toasted and so my sandwich was cold and hard on the outside - bagel not fresh. The croissant one a little better but they nickle and dime you for even tomatoes and lettuce on it. The 2 items came to a total of $13+!!!  For the price I expected at least well-made breakfast sandwiches, definitely will not be coming back. I would rather eat a Starbucks Double-Smoked Bacon, Cheddar & Egg Sandwich for far less the cost!
2017-09-29,1,I am completely horrified at the service that I didn't not receive this morning at the uptown little grocery location. I am a loyal customer who enjoys going to little grocery for breakfast and coffee at least once or twice a week. The female owner is very nice but I'm not here to write about her. One of the male workers who claims he is the owner was extremely rude. I arrived this morning for coffee and breakfast before work at 7:06am, yet the store was pitch dark even though I checked their store hours before leaving my house and taking a completely different route to work which inconvenienced me but their service and food is always worth it to me- but I was oh so wrong. This male worked is sitting in his car watching me knock on the window and staring at me as I'm looking into the glass to see if anyone is inside. He comes storing out of his car and asks me to get out of the way. He proceeds to call me "a rude girl". I replied that I believe the store was open at 7 AM but now it is 7:15 AM and I'm going to be late for work. i've never felt so offended this early in the morning in my entire life. I'm completely disgusted by this breakfast spot and will no longer be a client. I will be back one more time just to inform the female owner of this situation.
2017-09-16,5,Cute cafe with tons of healthy options! I have tried multiple sandwiches and their veggie omelete- all which were great. Very reasonable prices, too!
2017-09-02,3,It's a very cute and quaint place, I love the vibe of it. However I ordered a bacon and cheese sandwich and a small hot coffee and it came out to 11 dollars.... when I asked how it was that expensive the young woman at the counter tried to explain it, and although it made no sense, she still insisted I pay that price... I understand everything in Hoboken is expensive but THAT it just a little too excessive
2017-09-01,4,The best egg sandwich ($5.5) in Hoboken and good ice coffee with good price. ($2.75 for Large ice coffee) but sometimes there's a really long line and will have to wait for 20 minutes to get a sandwich... if you have time and patience, then it'll be a really good spot to grab a breakfast in Hoboken.
2017-07-21,5,Awesome little place! Feels like home!  Food is fabulous, staff is courteous and friendly.  Can't say enough good things about it!  A little gem in Hoboken!
2017-07-06,5,Last week I was walking around washington street and looking for a new place to eat and stumbled upon this gem! The menu is great and everything looks and smells delicious! The owner is super nice and I will definitely be back to try more!!
2017-06-18,3,The employees were super nice, but service was very slow. Also, the sandwiches are seriously underwhelming.
2017-05-19,5,"Food tastes better when you cook it with love."  The venue is small, warm and unassuming.  You will wait a few minutes for a freshly cooked sandwich, but the wait is worth it, even before jumping on the bus to work the morning.  I can't explain what magic makes my egg sandwich on a croissant taste better than the others made in town, but it just does. If we are lucky, this town gem stays in business for a very long time.
2017-04-02,5,I was a bit hesitant to try this place after reading some reviews below, but I came in here yesterday with my husband for a quick lunch as we were short on time. I am pleased to say that we had a really great experience, and I am laughing at myself for not trying this place sooner! It seems from the below reviews that historically some people have had different levels of service, but all I can report is that we had a really great experience when we went in yesterday. We ordered some sandwiches off the menu and they were made fresh in the cafe in only a few minutes. They were very, very fresh and  tasty and so much better than the usual store bought stuff you normally get in cafes. We had really great service too - very friendly and polite. I really love that this is not just another corporate chain restaurant that seem to be taking over the neighborhood, but a very charming and local cafe that is part of the neighborhood. I would highly recommend giving this place a try!
2017-02-28,5,I love finding places like this. Amazing homemade food and service to match. Won't be the last time here.
2017-02-12,5,Breakfast and lunch are both delicious. I had the Granny panini and my girlfriend had the veggie omelette. We've lived here over a year and never knew this place was here. Amazing food! We'll be back!
2017-01-24,2,The food here is great. I have to say that I love their breakfast sandwiches. I also enjoy the place itself it's very nice. But the people that work there aren't very nice. The Asian girl that works there ignored me for like 10 minutes and didn't take my order, and was very obviously avoiding me. Then a group of girls came and I moved out of the way because it's a tight corridor, and when the dude started taking orders he claimed they were there first. I didn't really care because he took my order anyway, he was just a bit rude about it. And the Asian girl seems a bit condescending, like she's miserable working there. If you hate your job, quit! Anyhow the food is great. And there's no other legit breakfast spots in Hoboken so they have the upper hand.... for now.
2017-01-23,4,What a cute little gem hidden in Hoboken! My first time coming here was almost an accident. As my boyfriend and I were walking along Washington St., I saw the sign outside for latte specials (including a green tea latte) and I couldn't resist going inside to try one. I immediately fell in love with the cozy atmosphere, the large window overlooking the street, and the feeling that I could sit there all day and just veg out with a good book. As for the latte itself, it was delicious and satisfied my green tea craving on a frigid winter day.Since that chance encounter, I've gone to The Little Grocery several times to try a chai tea latte, a pumpkin spice latte and the breakfast sandwiches, and I've never been disappointed. Not only are the prices extremely reasonable, but everything is delicious and prepared in a timely manner so I can go to work with a smile on my face. I especially love that I can get lox on my sandwich here and it's not an extra $8 like some other places will charge you. The only downside here I would say is that sometimes the lady behind the counter (who I presume owns the cafe) is less than enthusiastic about taking my order and makes me feel a bit unwelcome, but I'm willing to overlook it for great food and a picturesque cafe.
2016-12-02,5,This place is so cozy it should really be renamed to Cozy Little Grocery.My visit was no more than 10 minutes, but I got a great experience from Little Grocery. I was greeted with a big smile and good morning at 830AM on a Sunday. Normally, you wouldn't be very upbeat on a Sunday morning, but the employees were!I looked at the massive (and a little confusing) breakfast menu and went with the sausage/egg/cheese on an everything bagel. Friend and I waited about 5 minutes for my sandwich and his cream cheese on a bagel to be finished. In that time, we noticed the self serve water and poured ourselves a glass.Hands down, one of the best sausage/egg/cheese sandwiches I've ever had. The egg was nice and fluffy, cheese was....cheesy and sausage was juicy. According to my friend, they do not make their own bagels, but  get them from a spot farther downtown on Washington.I wish I had time to sit in at the table near the window. Seems like a great spot to spend the morning having breakfast, sipping coffee and checking your e-mail.
2016-11-10,3,Setting is nice as it feels very Polynesian and French like atmosphere. I like the location since it's right on Washington Street and there is indoor and outdoor seating. The seats by the window are very nice and relaxing to eat and just people watch. The owner and other workers are all kind and very polite.Food quality isn't anything special and slightly overpriced. The chicken avocado on rye is really good but again overpriced. I usually just come for a bacon, egg, and cheese and coffee in the morning.Recommend coming here to grab something quick for breakfast.
2016-11-05,4,The Little Grocery is a cute spot we go to for egg sandwiches and paninis. Eggs are always cooked perfectly, no rubbery egg substitutes here. The bread is fantastic - my favorite is the Balthazar multigrain toast. We once tried the French toast, it's the usual fluffy challah French toast you get at cafes but it's still delicious. I find the portions to be realistic rather than 3 meals in one - I personally appreciate that.It's small so make sure not to bring 10 people thinking you'll find a seat- it's better for twosomes or take-out. If it's warm enough outside, there's two tables available on the sidewalk. Staff is very nice and accommodating. We've been back several times and will definitely go back again.
2016-10-11,5,Good food fresh. Great service. And price is a steal. Love this place for breakfast.. #just what hoboken needed. U are awsome. #love it
2016-08-25,4,Fresh, healthy, and nice surrounding for a cup of coffee with friends. Great go-to spot!
2016-06-19,5,We love the little grocery. They have the best coffee and the veggie omelette is delicious. Hands down the cutest breakfast spot uptown :)
2016-06-05,4,I had the pleasure of enjoying their breakfast items here, which seem to be a very popular among Yelpers. I ordered an egg+sausage sandwich with pesto and tomato on multi-grain (the bread is awesome) I could probably make this at home, but will say it was very tasty and made quick and to-order. My boyfriend had a similar breakfast sandwich, on a roll with bacon, also pretty good. We also added on a coffee and a pumpkin spice latte, both were basic coffees, still good! I gave a 4, bc I'd love to try their sandwich/panini items and may review again. The staff there are very friendly as well!
2016-05-29,2,I placed an order through grubhub on Sunday at 3:55.  It was confirmed and 20 minutes later I received a text and email with an updated delivery time of 5:05-5:30.  When it still hadn't arrived by 6:00, I called the store only to get a voicemail saying that they were closed on weekends.  Not sure how it got confirmed with an updated delivery time if the store was closed.  Needless to say, I won't be placing an order with them again since I don't want to risk waiting two hours just to find out my food won't ever be coming.
2016-04-22,2,I'm writing this review as I am sitting and waiting 20 mins for my mediocre panini to come out. I don't understand how a place with no line can be so slow. The sandwiches are pretty meh and the people working behind the counter are as meh as the sandwiches. I attempted to come in here 5 times, without getting acknowledged ONCE before I actually got to place an order. And if there's a line, don't bother. You could knit 3 sweaters before your order would be ready. I'm sure the people who work here are probably pretty pissed they have to cook everything on a 1950's hot plate. One highlight is the do have a pretty good selection of egg sammy's. Don't torture yourself and go to one of the local deli's like Biancamano's or head over to Schnackenberg's instead of putting yourself through the torture of this place. Get it together LG. You have potential.
2016-04-02,2,Breakfast sandwiches aren't good and they're expensive. The amount of bacon is embarrassing and the way the cook the eggs (like an omelette) is very sub optimal for a breakfast sandwich. Also, a bacon egg cheese and avocado on a roll is $7. And it wasn't good.
2016-02-15,2,Decided to give this place a second shot before writing my review. First experience, nice staff and cute place but so skimpy on the meat in my "overstuffed" sandwich. Second time, they messed up the order and somehow confused bread pudding with a pasta dish...there was no one else ordering. How do those two things get mixed up. Got home to find out I received the wrong order and had to go back. I will say their muffins are tasty but overall not a fan of this place.
2016-01-23,4,Came back for a breakfast sandwich - $5.50 for a sausage, egg, and cheese which is about $1.50 more than what I would normally pay. That said, it was delicious. Balthazar bread really elevates their sandwiches here. I won't be back for a breakfast sandwich, but if you don't mind paying more, this is a good bet.
2015-12-10,5,We love this place! The staff and the food are equally amazing every time! No other breakfast spot in Hoboken compares!!!
2015-12-06,4,I'm overdue for an update of this place, which now merits 4 stars.I first visited shortly after they opened, and at that time found the service to be a bit slow.  It seems they've worked out all the kinks, because now it's quite prompt.I've been here many times since my first review, and have often ordered the egg sandwich, which really is very good.  They offer up lots of choices for meats and cheeses to add, and the Balthazar french roll it comes on is really the perfect vehicle for the sandwich.  Soft, with just a hint of crust, a lot of chew and great flavor, it really takes the sandwich to the next level.  I'm a sucker for a good egg sandwich, and this is my favorite in Hoboken, maybe anywhere.At $6, the sandwich is fairly priced, especially when you factor in the Balthazar roll, the higher-end choices for meats & cheeses, and the Washington St. rent.
2015-11-15,1,I hate to say this but I walked in and walked out 10 minutes later with nothing. Only 2 other patrons there. The barista told me to order down the counter so I walked around then realized the others were still waiting to order. 5 minutes later they were asked their order. I stepped up and nada. I waited another 5 minutes but no one even looked up to ask for my order - even when I said excuse me. So I walked out and made my own eggs at home. I'd probably still be waiting to order if I stayed...
2015-11-13,5,Best breakfast sandwich Hoboken is right! The Little Grocery certainly has the goods to back up that claim! My clients gave me a giftcard a couple of months ago to The Little Grocery and I've been hooked ever since! So happy to have discovered this place as I am a huge breakfast food fanatic! Officially obsessed!I always get a sausage, egg and cheese on a croissant. The eggs are so fluffy and tasty. I've asked the owners what their secret is and they said it's just eggs blended with heavy cream yet I can't replicate it! The sausage is hearty without being too salty and heavy. On occasion I will also get the brioche French toast which is to die for. Also their coffee is the bees knees! I've found myself going here instead of Starbucks now.  I have a very physically demanding job and The Little Grocery always comes in clutch with their hearty and filling breakfast sandwiches! I've have yet to try their lunch and dinner offerings but I can bet when I do I won't be disappointed. The staff is always upbeat, friendly and attentive. I honestly don't know what the other reviewers are talking about. I go to The Little Grocery multiple times weekly and everyone has been nothing but courteous. Sure it gets busy sometimes but I am always taken care of in a timely fashion. As for wait times, I've never waited for more than 10 minutes for my food. If you want a breakfast sandwich in 90 seconds go to McDonalds. I'd rather wait a little longer and pay a little extra for a sandwich made with real tasty eggs on a soft, buttery croissant! I love The Little Grocery! I just wish they delivered to my bedside on Sundays! ;-)
2015-11-01,5,Lovely French style bakery.  Wonderful addition to Hoboken's range of culinary options.  Their sandwiches are so fresh.  What's even better is that they're willing to customize your food to your requests, and do so with a smile.  Katherine greets you with a smile and it feels like an old time neighborhood store as I imagine they existed 100 years ago.
2015-09-19,2,Meh. Kitchen is literally two hot plates in the back. Service is super slow and not overly friendly. You do not get the quality that the prices would suggest. Cannot recommend.
2015-09-06,5,Perfect breakfast, and yes, the best eggs in Hoboken (and I make damned good eggs and they are even better than mine). Perfectly brewed coffee and big portion of it, delicious French toast that is homemade and not overly sweet, and very relaxing and cozy ambiance. The music today is Pearl Jam and U2, taking us back to our youth and nostalgic and soothing, a blast from the past. The service is attentive and warm. There is even the latest edition of the NYTimes to read.  We frequent the original downtown Little Grocery which we love as well, glad to see the newer uptown one is just as great with the same delicious food and warm service and ambiance! Thank you!
2015-08-23,5,I love this place! I come here almost every weekend for a quick yet delightful breakfast. I've gotten lox and cream cheese with capers and tomatoes and I've also had egg with brie on a fresh roll. Delicious every time. The owner is super friendly and the environment is so quaint that it's the perfect start to any day!
2015-08-12,2,It's such a sweet mom and pop kinda store that I hate writing a bad review, but honestly the service I got was abysmal. I walked in at 1:05 needing lunch, asked for a panini and was then sitting without any further updates from the owners till 1:45. I believe  the lady might have had to run out to get some ingredients, but without a word to me... I would've happily switched orders if I'd been told it would take 40 mins. When I did finally the panini, it was burnt since it had been left in too longThe ambience is lovely, the owners seem very friendly with the regulars
2015-08-06,4,Went today for lunch. The woman who works there is very sweet and welcoming. I love when people ask how you are and say hello, very polite. She recommended the prosciutto, Brie, pesto, and sundries tomato sandwich. The bread is came on was delicious and added so much flavor to the pesto and sundried tomato. The prosciutto was a little thick and tough for me. I enjoy soft tender prosciutto. Cute little bistro! 100% going back soon :)
2015-08-02,2,I used to love the little grocery downtown and was so excited for the uptown location, however I have been there probably about ten times and can confidently say it is disappointing and quality has declined.The bread is not as fresh, they are SO skimpy on the meat, like one slice of deli ham, and I am not a fan of the layout in the new location. It's crowded, complicated and not comfortable (although decor is cute).The eggs are still delicious and the new staff are nice. I used to be on board with their claim of being the best egg sandwich but now I'd say it's a far cry (despite there not being much competition in hoboken).
2015-07-05,4,My boyfriend and I went here for a late brunch and we were surprised at how empty the place was. Granted, it was a Sunday afternoon during the 4th of July holiday, so maybe that explained the lack of people. Also, we looked up the distance from our apartment to the original Little Grocery location vs. this new location and found a two-minute difference in walking time, with the new location barely edging out the original as "closer".I ordered smoked salmon with cream cheese, capers and tomatoes on a toasted egg bagel; my boyfriend ordered the Dino omelette with brie, prosciutto, and onion with a slice of multigrain toast. For drinks, I had raspberry iced tea and he had an iced coffee. My bagel was toasted just right, and the consistency was perfect (not too chewy, and definitely not dry). The ratio of salmon to cream cheese was also balanced perfectly, and the salmon itself was thinly and cleanly sliced. I didn't get a chance to sample any of the Dino omelette, but my boyfriend clearly liked it.The one issue I had with The Little Grocery was that it was on the warm side indoors, even though the air conditioner was on and the ceiling fans were running. Thank goodness I had my delicious raspberry tea to keep me cool.
2015-06-20,3,Good menu, nice venue, their lunch and dinner sandwiches are excellent. They have some issues dealing with volume but I can handle the 5-10 minute wait.      There are 1 or 2 people there that will for sure forget one thing about your order so stay on top of them.        Main qualm: put more meat on the breakfast sandwiches!!! One slice of pastrami or one piece of bacon doesn't cut it. A good bacon and egg should have 4 pieces bacon at a minimum. Since I used to go there for the breakfast sandwiches, and they claim to have the best in hoboken, I've been disappointed and probably won't bother ordering a breakfast sandwich from here until I've confirmed this has been rectified.
2015-05-21,3,Breakfast sandwiches are good but nothing groundbreaking, and slightly overpriced for what they are. Service can be slow but the atmosphere is nice.
2015-05-01,5,Hubby and I grabbed brunch at LG today. He had the quiche and I had the egg sandwich on a croissant. Both were done really well. Iced coffee was decent. No issue with speed as some others mentioned however we were there at noon on a Friday.  Given how few good places there are uptown, we will be back.
2015-04-26,1,Horrible. Rude. Dirty. I saw someone take money and not change gloves before touching food. They throw trash on the floor, you can tell they have no respect for their own establishment. Though serving people less than half your age must get to them. They should probably find a better profession for their sour attitudes.
2015-04-20,4,its tiny and fills up fast but the food makes up for it. The people who work here (at least on the weekends) are very friendly. We had the egg sandwich on a jalapeño Bagel, the veggie panini, the broccoli cheddar quiche and the coconut bread pudding along with some coffees,everything was solid. Cant wait to go back and try their croissants. Its a good place if you want to grab some breakfast in an informal setting. Try it !
2015-03-28,3,The breakfast here is pretty good: the service is not. If you are going to ask me my order 6 times, you should get it right. You should also write it down. You should also make sure to explain up charges like French toast. Also once when coming here we were told there was a 30 minute wait for food. Why is their kitchen smaller than my apartment's and they are using a Forman grill to cook?
2015-03-23,3,Well, this isn't the kind of place you go for your formal, sit down brunch. Grab whatever seat you can find, take your paper menu, and order at the register. Food is good and prepared fresh, but when it comes to it, this isn't what I am looking for in brunch in Hoboken. Small changes would make a big improvement, like formal waiter service, real menus, and coffee mugs instead of disposable cups.
2015-03-22,2,Very underwhelming. Went for brunch and got a smoked salmon bagel w/cream cheese, tomatoes, onions and capers. I saw a picture from another yelper and it looked really good. I asked for an everything bagel and at first she said they didn't have any but checked the basket and found one. So I was disappointed when they gave it to me on an onion bagel instead. I told the guy who brought my food that I had asked for an everything bagel and he just stood there staring at me...not apologetic at all. I said I would just eat it (I didn't feel like waiting for them to fix it). When I opened up the bagel there was a very thin layer of salmon, 4-5 capers, a few pieces of diced tomatoes and some small pieces of onions. I was so disappointed bc the picture that I saw on yelp had big slices of tomatoes and looked amazing. My sandwich was a joke. My bf's cobb sandwich was so-so...definitely not worth $9+. Also, I watched them clear some tables and they basically just removed the plates without wiping them clean. I really wanted to like it here because it's a small cute place but it fell short in so many ways.
2015-03-18,1,Worst service ever. The guy who works there was extremely rude and I will never go back. My friend ordered breakfast from here and called the downtown location not realizing she called the wrong store. We order breakfast for pick up so I go to pick up the order and sure enough it wasn't there because my friend called the wrong location, completely our fault. I ask to gentlemen who was working at the time, if I can place order through him and in a rude tone he told me he can't help me and he will not take an order from me. I understand that being we called the the other location he can't make the same order because the other food goes to waste I totally get it. Instead of turning me away the gentlemen could of called the other location to explain the misunderstanding and ask them to deliver since they do deliver. Instead he tells me in a rude manor he can't help me. I will not go back to this place solely based of this experience.
2015-03-09,3,Came in on Sunday morning (3/8), believe this was day 2 or so of the soft opening of their new location....on one hand that forgives some of the issues I had but the fact that this is their second location makes some of the disorganization hard to believe.Upon walking in, the guy behind the counter was sort of just sitting there, however across from him were two finished tables which had not been cleared off.  It was like I had to make hard eye contact and look toward the dirty tables to remind him to come over and clear it off before I sat down (and there was another waitress, who wasn't up to much, so some coordination to take care of such an essential restaurant task???).  Where to order wasn't too clear, seems like they took some orders near the chef location (a whopping 2' x 2' piece of real estate, cheers to the chef for making it work but clearly this place is not trying to or could serve high volume with two frying pans as their kitchen).  Had to try the self-proclaimed 'best egg sandwich in Hoboken',with egg, Taylor Ham, on toasted multi-grain (meant bagel but did not specify, my fault).  I'd say the egg sandwich was quite good, saying its the best is a stretch.  Was dissapointed that ZERO attempt was made to toast the bread as i requested.  Would I try it again?  Yes, I would order it as takeout for sure.  Why?  This place is not really conducive to dining in any real sense.  If you have to take one of the two seat tables (which is the vast majority here) against the wall not only do you get plenty of ass bumps from people ordering or going to the back (???) to get their drinks, you also have the heater blasting from your feet up to your face - a nice, refreshing rush of hot air in my face is not my version of a relaxing meal - perhaps the front tables that seat more have more promise.  Also got the french toast with a veggie omelette as part of a big breakfast deal.  The omelette was okay, the french toast was very rich, albeit presented in a very non-traditional way that honestly looked like a kid threw it together for his mom on Mother's day.All in all a lackluster first visit, but the contents of the egg sandwich earns them a chance at redemption.  They really need to tighten up their operation in my opinion.
2015-02-27,1,I opened up a yelp account to review the cobb salad because I was so absolutely disappointed. For a visual, please look at the photo in the post below. It does not look appetizing....because it isn't. To be honest, I am not even sure if the chicken is white meat. I am sure that it is gross. It was slimy, BROWN and felt like plastic. Even after removing the chicken, I decided to just throw the salad away and order elsewhere as I couldn't stomach eating the lettuce after the chicken touched it. There is nothing special with this salad. I could have made a better one at home.
2015-02-09,5,I adore this place!  I highly recommend the breakfast sandwiches - I love the simple egg and cheese on a roll.  I love bacon, egg, and brie on croissant.  The food here is not greasy and it makes you feel good about eating it. The only downside is that for the quality, you have to pay the price so sandwich and coffee cost ~$7-8.
2015-01-31,5,Best breakfast and Lunch in Hoboken! Try the omlettes for yourself! You won't regret it! They make everything from scratch with the best ingredients!
2015-01-24,5,Egg sandwich with ham, avocado and tomato -- perfectly done. Good cup of coffee too!  Friendly service and a really charming atmosphere. Love the downtown location too!
2015-01-19,5,Had the veggie omelet it was amazing.  Roomie got the salmon cream cheese omelet. Just the right texture...  And the toast was fresh and not too crunchy.
