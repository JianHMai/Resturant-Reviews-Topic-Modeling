2021-11-06,5,By far the best bagels in Hoboken and maybe NYC
2021-09-23,1,Overpriced for a microwaved breakfast sandwich on a subpar bagel. With so many other good bagel options in town, I won't be coming back.
2021-07-13,4,If your in NY you have to try the hot bagels. Well this place was popping so that's why we picked it but in all honesty I was expecting more from just the bagel itself. It was a bit of a letdown that the bagel was subpar. The fixings on the bagel made it all work but I was hoping the bagel was a bit bigger and fluffier. The service is quick so don't be discouraged by the long line outside the shop. It moves pretty fast. The ham deluxe is like two inches of ham. The amigo bagel was tasty but more jalapeño would be better. The coffee was tasty and fresh. Wish we had more time in Hoboken to try more items on the menu. Definitely a local spot on Sundays.
2021-04-04,4,Good bagels that are still bagels and not a giant bread roll pretending to be a bagel.
2021-04-02,5,I think this is hands down the best bagel shop in the Hoboken and JC area. They don't have the Instagram worthy sandwich selection like an OBagel but judging based on the bagel itself they are the absolute best...nobody comes close.
2021-03-04,2,I avoid giving poor ratings given the times. But given that food was being delivered to a hungry kid in school I expected at least a little remorse in it being delayed. No fault of the restaurant - the delivery guy was lost. I called to let the shop know that delivery was delayed and took 45 mins. the response I got was "we usually take 30-45 mins". Really?! No, I'm sorry I hope ur child got his lunch. $5 delivery fee for local delivery, I wouldn't order if I had other choices.
2021-03-03,5,You want a bagel made with pure talent and passion, this is the place, forget the Letters or the Pictures on the menu, walk in there and just smell the pure rich scent of this Bagel Shop. There's a line for a reason, every bite is worth the wait.
2021-02-17,1,I just paid $4.50 for a bacon egg and cheese bagel. I watched them make it - they microwaved the egg and bacon in a plastic cup and dumped it on my bagel. This is so gross. I asked them if this is how they normally make it and they said yes. I asked them if they have a stove at all and they said no. It even smells bad.
2020-12-06,1,Really wanted to love this local bagel shop - it didn't seem like the cleanest compared to some of the other places in town but appeared popular enough to give it a try. I was hugely disappointed and disgusted to find a large hair on my bagel, right in the cream cheese. Will never ever go back. Do yourself a favor and go to O'Bagel, which is always clean and has awesome bagels.
2020-11-30,5,Consistently the bagels fresh in Hoboken!! Go in the morning and you can get them hot. Lox spread is delicious and has big chunks of lox mixed in. All spreads are great and the staff is nice and quick. Sometimes there is a line but it moves quickly and is always worth it. I recommend this place to everyone!
2020-11-07,1,No it's not amazing.  I didnt even get food.  Yes, owner.  I was standing outside for 25 min and couldnt even get inside because you had a full line of customers.  Two things wrong here.   This is a bagel shop, your food is simple to make, how are they even waiting?????  Secondly there's a PANDEMIC going on??? Why do you even allow a tightly packed line to form indoors??? Last i checked you are allowed 25% occupancy and that makes up your entire store (100%) because it's so sad and small.  Will never be back.
2020-10-27,4,Great local small business, pre-covid it could get a little crowded waiting for a bagel on the weekend, so theres always an option to call ahead. I usually got the everything bagel with egg and cheese. Always good!
2020-10-23,2,I generally like Hot Bagels but will not return until after the pandemic. I walked in twice to get a breakfast sandwich and walked out because the guy behind the counter had his mask on below his nose. Once might be an accident but twice means he is clueless or doesn't care. Considering how small this place is I just don't want to push my luck.
2020-10-19,1,Do yourself a favor and do NOT get any egg sandwiches from this shop. Unless you like microwave eggs and rubber like bacon
2020-07-24,5,Was trying to find a place to get breakfast and was luck to find this place. The bagel was toasted enough to where it was able to complete the sandwich. 10/10 if i am in the area again for breakfast, this will be the first place I go too.
2020-07-10,1,I never ever ever ever give one-star reviews. On the rare occasion that I do, a place must've REALLY gotten on my bad side.Here's the thing, my biggest pet peeve in the foodie world is a bad bagel. The bagels here are such an abomination that after I ordered and the guy handed it to me, I told him I didn't want it and walked out.First of all, the "bagels," or rather, whatever poor excuse they're selling and calling them bagels, are the equivalent in size to a mini bagel. Take a look in the back, they don't even look freshly made. I can go to the bakery section of Shop Rite and buy a fake bagel that's twice the size and likely tastes better. If you want a bagel in Hoboken, go to JP's. Don't waste your time at this imposter place.
2020-07-06,5,Waiting at the Vet next door we saw a line here in the morning. Decided to take some bagels to go and it was such a good decision. Have gone back twice after that and i love their egg bagels with scallion cream cheese and also their everything bagel with scallion cream cheese. Next time will try the egg sandwich bagels.
2020-06-29,1,I am not sure if it's just me but I really did not like their bagels. Compared to Obagel I can get, their bagels don't taste fresh and they are so dense inside. They just taste kind of like a grocery market bagel, which is awful. And I didn't know that it's possible to not like taylor ham, egg, and cheese on bagel. I saw them microwaving my egg and cheese and I was very shocked. I never went there ever again after that.
2020-06-15,2,I stopped in the other day due to the reviews here like "best bagels in Hoboken" or "best bagels ever". I feel like the folks who wrote that aren't actually familiar with bagels. You know how when you want a croissant, you want it to be light and fluffy, but the less than capable bakers where you purchased it made it thick and heavy? This place is like the bagel version of that. The bagels are far denser than anyone would want them to be and average to below average in flavor.  Another reviewer mentioned a lack of sesame seeds on a bagel and this must be the same for all the stock. I got a couple plain and a couple garlic bagels (and had to ask for separate bags, a thing someone who works at a bagel shop should know intuitively, as garlic is one of the stickier add ons). The garlic bagels only had garlic on one side and what was there was barely there.  If this is the best bagel in Hoboken, time to go into the city...
2020-05-31,5,Best Bagels I have ever had. When ever I am back in Jersey this is a place I must hit. Love it!
2020-05-02,5,Easily the best bagels in Hoboken and perhaps including New York City area.  These are made in a classic style fresh daily... These are far superior to H&H bagels which seem like a big hype to me. ( although I do go to HH once in a while to compare; ehh) i've been coming to Hobo bagels for years...(20). It's a small hole in the wall type of shop with a quirky Small town feeling. It's mostly take out with a couple of seats upfront. Classic selection of flavors... You can't go wrong with whatever you want to put on it or just eating and playing.
2020-01-23,4,This is a solid bagel place for me... the delivery isn't as long and their bagels are huge! I've been ordering extra bagels and just freeze them for Sunday mornings :)Please note that I get regular whole wheat everything bagels and add my own toppings at home! So this review is purely for the bagels themselves!
2020-01-03,5,Authentic, fast and delicious! Some of the best bagels I've had. Definitely a great spot to grab and go eat on the water after a quick walk.
2019-12-20,4,I'll preface this post with the fact that this was my first time ever having a New Jersey bagel. As an out of towner, I had a great experience in the shop. While it is small, it's nothing I wasn't used to while chasing flavors. The man behind graciously helped me out trying to figure out what sandwich combination would be the best. We settled on the Chicken Salad on an Everything Bagel (which I heard was top class in Hoboken). I'll say I had a great time indulging this sandwich. The dough was soft, and the bagel was jam packed with flavor. Hefty scoops of chicken salad pulled it all together in a salty/creamy experience. A friend recommended this place, and I endorse it as well.
2019-11-17,5,Stopped in for a couple of breakfast sandwiches toasted bagel, Taylor Ham and egg.  Had to walk a couple of blocks home and the sandwiches were still hot.  Staff is friendly and place is clean.
2019-10-30,1,0 stars. Boring bagel. Breakfast sandwich was the worst I've ever had. There's no grill behind the counter so you conveniently can't see them make it. 99% sure it was all microwaved Dunkin style.With the likes of O'Bagel basically next door, Bagels on the Hudson down the block, JPs downtown, and other superiors, there's simply no logical reason to step foot in or near this place.Have some respect for yourself. Go elsewhere.
2019-10-20,5,For your classic bagel and cream cheese, or dozen bagels to go, go here. The bagels themselves are high quality. Reminds me of Black Seed Bagels in NYC. If you're looking for an egg sandwich or something fancier, this isn't your place. I've heard they microwave their eggs.
2019-10-06,5,Fast, efficient service on a Sunday morning. Got a whole wheat everything bagel with vegetable tofu cream cheese and an OJ from the fridge. Reasonably priced considering the area, and overwhelmingly delicious! I will return every time I am in the area! Very generous with cream cheese and perfectly toasted.
2019-09-12,5,Classic, great bagels, doughy and perfectly chewy inside. If you ask which ones are warm they'll tell you - get them! Plenty of seeds on the seeded bagels, and for a change I like the 'amigo,' which looks like an egg bagel but has a little spicy kick of jalapeno. There can be a line sometimes, but it moves quickly and is worth the brief wait. The owner is genuinely nice for a chat and has been running this place for many years. Always my first choice when I'm in town.
2019-08-04,1,We had guests staying with us so I got out early to get some bagels. I bought four everything and two plain.  The everything bagels were stale. Clearly yesterday's. I have never been served stale bagels at a bagel store. Try serving fresh ones. You may sell enough so you don't need to serve yesterday's today. I won't go to this store again. There are other options very close that I will try.
2019-08-02,2,Bagels here are weak. I'd recommend you try one of Hoboken's alternative like O'Bagel half a block down town. The bagels here are not fluffy or doughy and their size appears slightly smaller than your typical bagel. I give them recognition for spread options; they've got light cream cheese to tofu spread. Their major disappointment is that they microwave their eggs when you ask for any bagel with eggs. Their pricing is in line with others around town, but you can do better.
2019-06-26,3,Good, not great.  I mean it's a straight forward bagel place.  Small, no frills, open limited hours, no parking (except for street, so walk there), and limited seating (3 seats inside, 3-4 tables for two outside when the weather permits).Here's the good news: it's not expensive, they have the best everything bagels in Hoboken (unlike some of the other shops who put 3 sesame seeds and one poppyseed on a plain bagel and call it an everything ‍), their scallion cream cheese is awesome, and their flavored coffees are really good.Here's the bad news:  they run out of bagels ALL of the time (literally, and it's so frustrating), so go there as early as it can not only to get what you want, but to get a bagel period.  The other thing I wish was different was the toughness of the bagel-it's SO tough, sometimes it's like bawling on stale bread-I don't know how their bagels are this tough sometimes, it astounds me.Anyway-worth the trip, go early, and make sure you walk there!
2019-06-26,5,They make good breakfast sandwiches on great bagels. There is a few other baked goods as well.
2019-04-29,3,Hoboken Hot Bagels is a little hole in the wall bagel shop on Washington. (And don't be fooled by the big ATM in the front of the shop as I was - they do take cards here!!)The workers here were kind of short with me when I ordered. The egg for my bagel looked almost like it was premade? It was in a squarish hunk. And the slice of cheese was thrown on top of it and put in a microwave? I am not sure if this is how all bagel places do it and I am just missing something or what, but it seemed off to me.But in the end, my motto "all bagels are good bagels" still remains. The bagel was good, and I ate it all up in a heartbeat. It wasn't the best bagel I have ever had, but was still a good lil bagel.
2019-01-03,5,Your not going to get the brunch experience you want or weird named sandwich... Just a simple hole in the wall that's been around forever but makes the best tasting bagel in Hoboken and the surrounding area. Basic bagel sandwiches and spreads is what you get here but well worth it.
2018-12-12,5,Their bagels are made the original way which is to boil the dough first then baking them.  They make their bagels daily so everything is really fresh.  The owner is super sweet.  They have a ton of options for your bagel from a variety of cream cheese to other toppings as well.Don't go to any other bagel shop in Hoboken by you will be disappointed.
2018-09-05,4,The only place I'll go to in Hoboken for a delish bagel and spread.  Everything bagel toasted with cream cheese was heaven. The line can look intimidating during busy hours but the employees keep things moving at a reasonable pace. Seating is limited.
2018-06-30,5,I had forgotten how good the bagels here are.....had everything bagel with scallion cream cheese and it was DELICIOUS It's the perfect combination of crunchy outside and beautifully soft inside. I LOVED IT!
2018-04-29,5,Fantastic service. Delicious food. Quick and amazingly priced. This is the place to go.
2018-04-28,2,Ordered Taylor ham egg and cheese on a bagel. What I got was a pretty good bagel, I microwaved egg microwaved Taylor ham and really crappy American cheese. Microwaved are you kidding. They should kick you out of New Jersey. Not for me
2018-04-25,3,HHB is my friend's favorite place for bagels in Hoboken and I was willing to give it a try.The store itself can be categorized in the "hole in the wall" kind of store. There's enough room to stand about 3-5 people in line and then it's the door.What I did notice is that HHB is a bit cheaper than Bagels on Hudson farther down on Washington. After I got my order of sausage egg and cheese on an everything bagel, I realized why. Their bagels are a bit smaller than their competitors. No complaints about size to cost ratio and no complaints about the taste of my bagel too.What threw me off was I was asked twice whether I wanted salt/pepper/ketchup. My friend who I went with was asked 3-4 times! Once or twice by the guy at the counter and another time by someone from the kitchen. Was it so hard to write that down on the initial order?All in all, I had no major complaints about the place and the food. Nonetheless, I can't say that HHB is my top pick when I want a breakfast sandwich in Hoboken.
2018-03-01,4,Went here a few time. Some experience are good some are not. As for the price, the have cheaper price with same quality of bagels compared to other Hoboken bagels shop. Sometimes they're a little impatient for the customers. For example, they don't like to introduce you what kind of bagels they have or how to eat it. They just want you to be quick and to the next customer. That sucks.
2018-02-25,5,This little bagel joint is so underrated compared to its nearby bagel stores. There everything bagels are out of this world. My hubby lives for these bagels on the weekend... greatest bagels in Hoboken!
2018-02-21,4,I really do love this place, it's my favorite bagel spot in hoboken.  With that being said there are a few things I wish would change.  First being consistency.  Depending on who makes your bagel, the same order can be different every time no matter how clear you are on what exactly you want. Second being customer service.  While a few of the employees are very friendly (older white guy with white hair and shorter young guy with dark hair and Latin looking-don't know their names) their others  definitely don't care about pleasing their clients.  One of the employees (older Latin guy) got really pissed off that I went in 45 mins before closing and very rudely told me I could not get nova on my bagel because he had dishes to wash.  THEN he told me I couldn't even have my bagel toasted.  He ended up toasting it but would not give me nova.  While I was waiting for my bagel a young couple came in and he outright told them to leave because they were closed...this was a good chunk of time before closing time.None the less I continue going to hoboken hot bagels because when it's made right it's absolutely delicious!
2018-02-04,1,Hot Bagels was my go-to bagel spot in Hoboken. That is, until I spotted a MOUSE dash across the floor behind the register. If you do decide to eat here, stick with cream cheese or butter. Anything ending with "egg and cheese" is quickly nuked in a microwave.
2018-01-20,4,My go to spot for bagels in Hudson county. Don't let the "small in the hole" appearance deceive you. Authentic Bagels are made fresh daily and they don't shy on the amount of cream cheese and lox they add on. Prices are a lot cheaper than their Hoboken competitions such as O'Bagel or Bagels On the Hudson. Knocked off a star cuz i agree with one of the fellow helpers below, employees lack luster on personality and can be rude at times
2018-01-20,1,After a disastrous experience at Bagels on the Hudson, this was my go-to bagel shop. The location is extremely small and packed with people, but I've always powered through for a decent bagel. Everything's been quality... until today. I ordered a bagel with butter and the butter was BAD. It literally tasted terrible. On a Saturday morning, how do you have bad butter?? The place was packed, so I feel bad for all the other families spitting out bagels this morning. Can someone please tell me a good and consistent bagel shop in Hoboken?? Can't seem to find one and it's annoying!
2017-12-19,5,So happy that I was sent to NYC for training, for my new job. I got to have my favorite bagel! Everything bagel with a layer of scallion cream cheese, a layer of smoked whitefish salad, red onion, and tomato! We can't get smoked whitefish salad in Hawaii.
2017-12-18,5,Who would have thought that one of NYC's best bagels can only be found in New Jersey? These folks are the real deal. Authentic in every way, and well worth seeking out.
2017-11-05,3,They don't have a good way of managing the crowds of students and the bagels themselves are average at best. I prefer JPs on the weekends as it is easier and tastier.
2017-10-07,4,I love their bagels! They seem the most authentic bagel available in Hoboken. The everything bagel is amazing. If you are looking for breakfast sandwiches go to obagel. But if you want a good bagel with cream cheese, this place is awesome.
2017-10-02,5,Our go to bagel place in Hoboken. White fish & everything bagel is a great way to start a weekend. There's often a line out of the door on a weekend morning but it usually moves quickly.
2017-09-09,1,I don't even want to give a star! The food was mediocre Not great tasty bagel n cream cheese is ehhh!Staff RUDE! I ordered cinnamon raisin bagel with walnut raisin cream cheese. The guy didn't toast the bagel before putting on the cream cheese. Than he gave me an attitude when I asked him why didn't he toasted the bagel before putting on the cream cheese. The guy told me I should told him I want my bagel toasted. I'm confused... every bagel shop I been to ask me (the customer) do you want your bagel toasted it. Next time maybe your staffs should ASK the customer preference first!No wonder O'bagels few blocks down is taking your business..., I wonder why!!!!
2017-09-03,4,So I get it -  they microwave their eggs and that's sacrilegious.  I ordered an egg sandwich there just once.  Not great for sure.  BUT..... if you want a GREAT Everything bagel this is the best place west of NYC.   And their coffee is fabulous too.  As for their service, I've never had anything but a nice experience with the really helpful and caring staff.  This is our Go-To bagel joint in Hoboken.   So would be 5 stars for bagels and coffee.   Just don't get the eggs.
2017-08-06,1,Just not what you want. Bagels have no flavor to them and things just don't seem fresh. I feel like cut too many corners. Wouldn't recommend
2017-07-30,5,Amazing authentic bagel. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Delicious cream cheese options. Best bagels in Hoboken hands down.
2017-07-30,1,The Staff: Zombies, but rude. Rude zombies. "Rumbies." Just unpleasant people who appear to be in constant fear of their manager. Every time I come in here there's some rudeness from the main guy at the register or behind the counter. Over the past fifteen years, they seem to have gotten more disgruntled and detached. I wonder why.The Manager: I used to never see this guy. With the O'Bagel popping up a block away, I see him all the time.The Bagels: Meh. The Everything Bagel is pretty good. The rest are not so good. As noted by other Yelpers, they microwave their eggs. Ya know, like McDonalds or Dunkin' Donuts. Never wised up and invested in a grill. Who knows why.The Coffee: I use it to clean my lawnmower's engine. Also probably good for stripping paint.
2017-06-06,5,Hands down the best bagels in Hoboken.  The staff is friendly even when they are swamped and the bagels are always fresh & delicious!  My favorite Saturday morning treat!
2017-05-11,5,We love love their bagels! My kids have grown up eating them ...
2017-04-30,5,Great Bagels!!!! Best in Hoboken and I always go out of my way when I'm in the area. I prefer these bagels over the 2 other stores very close by. They boil the bagels and then bake. Not a fake spray bagel that just tastes like Italian bread
2017-04-09,5,The everything bagels are the best in Hoboken. Everything is made fresh and tastes delicious. If there is a line it moves quickly and definitely worth the wait.
2017-02-25,5,Totally good. I was going here every day to get bagels with turkey, roast beef or ham... They give you a good amount of meat and are 1/3 the price of O'Bagel.  The staff is friendly and it normally doesn't take much time to get in and out.
2017-02-25,4,An oldie but a goodie. Don't expect anything fancy here but do expect a line at peak hours and a great bagel & cream cheese. Remember - cash only!
2017-01-07,5,I love this iconic place and would be at a loss for bagels without them. They epitomize the way a bagel should be, crispy outside and soft inside. Keep up the good bagel-ing....
2016-12-04,5,Really good bagels.. Fresh and light - not too doughy I like that... Love plain and everything!!!
2016-10-08,1,Worst bagel I've ever had! Ordered a bacon egg and cheese on an everything bagel. The egg was microwaved. There was only one super thin tiny slice of bacon. And the bagel was hard and dry.... Gross
2016-08-25,5,Great place for a breakfast and very very reasonable price, less than a dollar for a good size bagel, I can't find anywhere else to beat that!
2016-08-13,2,Could never understand some folk's fascination with this place. It's mediocre at best. Here's three major - MAJOR - issues with this joint:1.  The bagels are usually "thinner" and harder in texture. This is not a good NY-style bagel. Bagels on the Hudson and JP's bagels are far more superb.  I made the mistake of bringing two dozen of their bagels into my office in Manhattan one day and was laughed at by every New Yorker who had one. Many compared the size and texture to frozen bagels. 2. They make all egg breakfast sandwiches in the microwave. They should be given negative stars for this.  The resulting sandwich is terrible.  TERRIBLE. 3. They run out of the most popular bagels early and won't restock later in the day.  Why this is the case is just bizarre. We are talking about making a dozen or two more bagels at pennies cost to them. Why is inventory control so difficult?Not sure if they are losing business after a few new places have opened up but they really need to reinvent themselves.
2016-07-14,4,I've been going here for a few years and still think these bagels are better than most in Hoboken. They taste great, especially when they are fresh out of the oven. The other place that just opened is good but very pricey. I think I'll stick with this spot and save some money too!
2016-07-10,1,Worst bagel sandwich I have ever had. It almost made me cry. It should be a crime to call that a bagel sandwich. First, they got my order wrong. They forgot to put ham on my HEC. The eggs were green, rubbery, and absolutely disgusting. I couldn't even eat it. Easily the worst thing I have ever purchased. Do not go here!
2016-07-09,4,Love these bagels! The store is a little tight for waiting but, it's worth it anyway.
2016-06-19,3,There bagels themselves are good esp with cream cheese ! Do NoT get any eggs because they are fake eggs like he one dunkin donuts use very disappointed and you will be too. I never in my life have ever went to a bagel place and got fake egg like that. You have been warned !
2016-05-28,5,Best bagels in Hoboken bar none. The quality is so good, crusty on the outside, thick and chewy on the inside. Always made to perfection.
2016-05-03,3,My favorite bagel spot in town and if you're a regular you'll know why. Considering it is a tiny narrow space they offer freshly baked bagels daily. The everything bagel is one of their bests. A bagel with butter/cream cheese will cost you $1.50.  Additionally you can get breakfast sandwiches (careful with these as in my experience and my friends they tend to toast the bagel itself too much). The staff is always friendly and move at a quick pace considering how busy they can get. If coming on the weekend be expecting to wait on a line that goes out the door literally. They do not offer an area that is large enough to sit down and eat the bagel so my advice would be to grab and go. Try this spot out for a fresh local bagel! You won't regret it.
2016-05-01,2,Everyone knows you can't scramble the egg on a TEC. Unusually small bagel, sloppily put together, with 1 slice of Taylor ham and cheese. Still searching for that go to bagel shop in Hoboken.
2016-04-29,5,This place is a Hoboken classic. Don't come here expecting a gourmet cafe. But if you want the best bagels in Hoboken at a good price there is no better spot around. If you need more proof just look at the line out the door (literally) every single weekend.I'm a regular here & have been since I'm a kid. The staff are wonderful people & they usually have my order ready before I get up to the counter. They even know I like my bagels crispy & will fish out a dark one for me. The bagels here are exactly how they should be, water bagels. Meaning they're boiled before being baked. If a bagel isn't boiled it's really just bread shaped like a bagel. The texture is not the same. Plus they're freshly baked every morning and throughout the day.This is a good old fashioned bagel shop with bagels made the old fashioned way.
2016-04-23,1,Not good at all. Hard bagels. Eggs are green? Wtf. Never again. And you need cash under 10$. And they weigh cream cheese out- I hate places that are so stingy.
2016-04-18,4,One of the superior bagel spots in the neighborhood for sure. Bagels are always fresh, the jalapeño cream cheese with amigo bagels is my go-to. They're a little on the crispy side if you prefer very doughy bagels, but I don't mind that at all. One point off for some of the younger people working there being total brain trust members who work just glacially slow and have no clue how to work the register - absolute slow motion nightmare when trying to run in before work for a quickie bagel stop. The owner and the other guy who usually is working are great and fast, though.
2016-04-14,4,Great bagels but I don't get sandwiches here since they are made in the microwave. Not doughy like bagels on the Hudson.... And they have flavor! They also give you as much or as little spread as you like.
2016-03-05,4,Best bagel place I've found in Hoboken so far! $0.85 bagels, $10.20 for a dozen. Will definitely be my go-to bagel stop from now on!
2016-02-22,2,Not gonna lie but everyone who lives in hoboken knows Bagels on the Hudson is ten times better. This place needs a renovation, it's never going to be as good as Bagels on the Hudson.
2016-02-11,3,These bagels are definitely different than the ones down the street at bagels on the hudson.  Depending on the day my preference changes.  This is more on the crunchy side rather than the more chewy bagels at bagels on the hudson.  I am not a fan of them microwaving their eggs to cook them but what are you gonna do.Come here if your in need of a hangover cure, it will be your savior.
2016-02-10,1,Customer service not too good. The Spanish guy with the glasses needs to be more polite to people and shoukd explain without an attitude. I went to buy a bagel with butter, I assumed it would be toasted, so I asked him, is it toasted and he said no, why would it be, you didn't specify. Excuse me????? I said oh ok, thank you, but I would like the bagel toasted, he frabs the bagel, rolls his eyes & tells me that now he has throw the bagel away. I was so upset, I told him stay with the bagel because I don't want anything & I walked out. No need for an attitude, if yoy don't like your job, then change it!!!!!
2016-02-09,5,Best tasting bagels in Hoboken.  I have been to JPS bagel, bagel smashery, Hudson bagels (which sucks) and Frans deli. This place has the best tasting bagels.  Not super doughy, not too dense, and everything bagel did not skimp out on the seasoning.  Too bad they don't deliver.
2016-01-16,1,I have been eating bagels my whole life, in many places.  I have never thrown out bagels for being too salty!  Even the cinnamon raisin ones, what were they thinking?  The veggie cream cheese was decent, but I definitely won't be back.
2015-12-20,5,Hands down nicest people working here EVER. The bagels are delicious and the nice man that works there on the weekday mornings makes my day!!!!! They handcraft the bagels, I saw one of the guys blow a kiss at one before handing it to a customer. Go to HOt bagels.
2015-11-29,1,Omg. Stay away. I came here only because it was recently reviewed bagel spot of Hoboken bagels and I was trying to satisfy a craving. But JESUS!! These bagels were horrible! It was so hard and not at all worth $4. My coworker and I got two bagels. 1- whole grain with lox & cream cheese - hard as HELL bagel. Gave a decent amount of lox... Loads of cream cheese. Can't complain about those two things. 2- plain with sausage and egg- sausage was cold in the middle. Egg was microwaved. Bagel was hard Both of us had less than half the bagel and threw it out. I came for crispy on the outside chewy on the inside bagels and it was NOT the case. Such a disappointment. Another restaurant added to my "stay off Washington st" theory.
2015-11-08,2,If you're saying this is the best bagel you ever had, you haven't lived and you're definitely a tourist.
2015-10-31,1,$6.20 for two bagels with cream cheese....that's nuts!  Microwave to cook their sandwiches versus a grill. No comprehension of toasting a bagel. Fail fail fail. None of the workers wear gloves and they all touch money and then your food, super sanitary money only I'm sure.
2015-10-11,4,My sister and I frequented this place nearly every day before heading to the city during our trip! Their bagels are pretty spot on for a small place so I wasn't really put down at all. The first time I had a bagel from here, I didn't get the pleasure of picking my own. It was an egg/ham/cheese on one of their salt encrusted bagels and it wasn't really my thing. The bagel was extremely salty! It sounds like I should've expected it, and I kind of did, but not to that extent. I was chugging water like no tomorrow after finishing it. The next few times I went I got the egg/ham/cheese on a plain scooped out bagel and I loved it so much!!! I love that they give you a "scooped out" (less innards of your bagel, hence 'scooped out') option because it makes your meal a lot less heavy. I have yet to go to a bagel shop in CA that lets me do that. Other: - Service is what you'd expect from a bagel shop but it tends to get crowded during certain hours so be patient! - Servers are nice :-) - Tiny shop but there's a few tables outside for you to cop a squat if you wanted
2015-10-10,3,The bagels are decent and they have a few different selections of cream cheese, but the ordering is odd no real menu of bagel types. The worst thing is the coffee. It tastes like some filled a used ash try with hot water.
2015-09-27,4,So far the best bagels we have had in Hoboken. Line is always out the door. Bagels are good. Vegan cream cheese was delicious. Outdoor seating is nice. Just wish they (like almost every bagel place) would take the extra few seconds to actually spread the butter instead of just throwing it on in a clump (in one area).
2015-08-05,1,Preordered 2 sandwiches and an order or bagels with cream cheese. Apparently that means you have to wait like everyone else. Laughable... People were rude and just not helpful in getting me in and out. What's worse is they charge a ton for a small tub of their premium cream cheeses. O yea they also half fill a regular tub but charge you for a full. Com' on man...
2015-07-19,5,WARNING: Don't use the ATM!We love the bagels and have been regulars here for several years.  I definitely recommend the bagels, and the staff is very nice.They recently added an ATM that is serviced by a third party.  The guy in line ahead of me used it to take out $200, and the machine returned six twenties, a five and three ones (i.e., $128).  So, whoever operates that ATM is a scammer.So go across the street to the bank for cash, but go to Hoboken Bagels for bagels!
2015-07-13,5,I gave them another chance. They now toast bagels on the weekend and they are amazing.
2015-07-03,3,I was disappointed that they didn't have a stove to make a REAL egg sandwich. They only had a microwave for eggs - so why bother. Bagels were good. Cream Cheese was really good. It's a small place. Good for a hot, fresh bagel.
2015-07-03,1,Sad to say that this is not the Hoboken Hot Bagels that I was such a big fan of a year ago. This is review is for the food, and only the food. Both my girlfriend and myself stopped in for BEC sandwiches. What we received were stale bagels, with a small serving of overcooked eggs, unmelted cheese and what seemed like a sample of bacon - pretty terrible all around. For those looking for better quality and overall experience, JP's near the PATH is the way to go
2015-06-17,2,The bagels themselves are decent (though not earth-shattering, which is what the weekend lines would lead one to believe) but the real issue with HHB is the total lack of organization/communication in the line when it gets long. People are yelling, nobody knows which orders goes to who... not worth the stress.
2015-06-13,2,Bagels are fine but they've screwed up my order repeatedly the last 3 times I've gone in. They've given me the wrong bagels every time. I always get it to go too so it's never been remedied. Never going there again.
2015-06-02,3,Ordered a bagel with eggs and bacon.The bagel was quite good, though not the 'best bagels in area' by a stretch. That honor goes to Wonder Bagels, easily. Still, these were above average.There were, however, only two lonely strips of bacon. And limp, flimsy, and thin McDonalds-style bacon at that. It was just sad. Someone said these were microwaved? That makes perfect sense.  I'm tryin to start my day right. Don't cheap out on the bacon.
2015-05-16,4,After testing a few different bagel places in Hoboken and being underwhelmed, I read some reviews and decided to check this place out. My coworkers are all mostly locals to the general area (which I am not) and are, therefore, experts on NY bagels. They regularly bring in a couple dozens of delicious local bagels for our team and I decided it was my turn. Unfortunately, with the standards so high, I had to do my research and choose wisely. Between the Yelp reviews and the fact that it was open at 6a, I landed here. While the prices were a bit more than I would've anticipated, the bagels were fresh and there were plenty of flavors (both bagels and cream cheese). Between two dozen bagels and 2 large tubs of CC, I hit about $36. But I will say it more than fed over 20 people. And this was by far the best bagel place I've fun into in Hoboken - simple, no nonsense, good bagels. This is be my go-to spoke going forward.
2015-05-12,5,Best bagel in town. By FAR. Best bagel I've ever had. Nicest people, just an overal great experience. ****I've reviewed this place in the last but over the weekend I went for my usual bagel before work and I saw something which I needed to write here. The owner walked out during the morning Rush to give a homeless man standing outside a bagel and a cup of coffee. Apparently he does this often, feeds who is in need. I'm very big on action against hunger campaigns. I've worked many charity events in my life and always try to find someone in need instead of throwing out any food I have..so seeing this makes me very happy. I have always been a loyal customer for Hot bagel but after that, I will never give my money to another bagel place. Kudos to that man.****
2015-05-03,4,Hoboken's best bagels. Dinging them because they sometimes run out of your preferred kind, one of the workers there has a personality of a wooden plank, and they should mix it up a little with some of their offerings / spreads.
2015-04-29,3,You would think with all of these one star reviews that were written solely for the fact that they microwave their breakfast sandwiches, they would gather the change they make from the long line out the door every weekend and purchase a grill, but apparently that's not the case. Don't get me wrong, the bagels from here are probably some of the best I've ever had but who in their right mind enjoys a breakfast sandwich where the eggs and pork roll are microwaved? Gross.  Service is good and I've even ordered a couple dozen bagels from here in advance for Saint Patrick's Day and my order was ready with no problems.  However, until they get a griddle, they will remain a 3-star review from me.
2015-04-03,2,not greeted with a hello or good morning, the man working behind the counter was the most miserable person ive ever encountered.. slamming stuff around n was downright rude, never again comin back, its a shame, because the bagels are pretty good.
2015-03-09,1,Been there many times, MOSTLY good but not  today. We ordered the bagel buttons to go with some cream cheese, which we have purchased many times. When we got home we found in the bag pieces of cut bagels mixed in with the buttons. I did not pay for pieces of bagels! You may screw a customer, but not me. one star for you!
2015-02-17,4,Stopped in one afternoon for a study snack and was seriously satisfied! I love a LOT of cream cheese, and the guys here slathered my bagel with delicious scallion CC (so much that I actually took some off!). They had run out of some bagel flavors and soups by mid-afternoon, which is understandable. Overall good!
2015-02-01,2,These are not "the best bagels ever!!" And they're not the worst.  Good variety.  But why 2 stars? They don't f$&@ing toast bagels. Period. Don't even own a toaster.  Is this a NJ thing? Basically eliminates this place as a viable option.  Bad coffee and TINY.And there's only a long line and decent reviews because there's zero competition.  It's 100% mediocre.
2015-01-15,1,I was craving a good bagel on a Saturday afternoon while staying with family in HOB & visiting from LA. It's hard to find good bagels in Los Angeles so I figured I would venture out on a cold and rainy day in HOB to scout out a new bagel shop. This place had decent reviews and was open later in the afternoon so I figured why not?Upon arrival, I was greeted by a woman who clearly didn't want to be there. I really wanted a sausage patty, egg & cheese sandwich right off the grill. She said they could make me that, but it could only be prepared in the MICROWAVE?! Seriously? They do that already out here at bagel shops and it makes the meat product taste like shit. I said no thanks and I asked to just have a bagel with cream cheese. I then saw a sign that said "10 MINIMUM ON DEBIT CARDS." There was no ATM machine in-house, and it was pouring rain outside. I asked the lady if she could let it slide this once (usually they do), and she said no. I asked her politely again, and her manager angrily shook his head "NO!" I thought it was a dick move since it was raining out and they already starting toasting the bagel. And seriously, fuck the owner of this place. Way to isolate customers by being an ignorant piece of shit.
2015-01-14,4,These bagels aren't as good as the top tier of bagels in NYC. But I've tried bagels from the 4 main bagel shops in Hoboken now (Hoboken Hot Bagels, Bagels on the Hudson, Bagel Smashery and JP's Bagel Express) and Hoboken Hot Bagels is clearly the best bagel shop from a bagel-purist perspective. Look, if you get your bagel toasted, get bagel sandwiches, put anything other than cream cheese on your bagel, etc... you can go anywhere. It won't matter. But if you *love* bagels like I do... If you left NYC thinking you'll have a better life elsewhere, then came back 10 months later because you missed the bagels (like I did)... you should not get bagels in Hoboken anywhere other than Hoboken Hot Bagels. Why is this place so much better? Well, to me, making a great bagel is about getting the texture of the bread right. Even if it's freshly baked, in-store, it has to have *just* the right amount of chewiness. The bagel "flavor" whether it's egg, everything, cinnamon raisin, garlic, etc. -- that's just a distraction from what really makes a bagel a good bagel. Don't waste your time or money elsewhere. Unless you like wasting your time and money on inferior products.
2015-01-07,5,Love this place. Their toasted everything bagels with cream cheese are amazing!! Best bagels I've ever had. Only bad thing is that they sell out quickly of the everything bagels and the place closes very early.
2015-01-06,5,NJ native, but been living in sf for 8 yrs.  Had a bagel and a PEC.  Damn, thank you for bringing me back to my childhood and reminding me what a real bagel was and my lost love the porkroll.
2014-12-10,2,This place is incredibly tiny and jammed pack.  You usually have to elbow your way to the cashier to order and get  a number.  Make sure to get here early for their whole selection of bagels, because they won't re-stock later in the day.Overall, I thought the bagels were ok, nothing special.  Maybe it is because I grew up eating bagels every single day, but really nothing special about their bagels.  I will give them credit for having an egg bagel, which is hard to come by.I ordered a sausage egg and cheese and also a bagel with cream cheese and can't say a single thing was memorable.  I just remembered it was not bad, but how does one even mess up such a simple order.  Not worth the wait, there are better bagels out there.
2014-12-09,5,I come here almost every day !!  The staff is incredibly nice and swift. Bagels are made 'the way they should be' - part boiled & part baked. They are not bread, as in most places.  Bagels are made on the premises. I like mine with a crispy crust and they indulge me by finding them (sometimes ahead of time!). They microwave so I know it's not for the 'toasted bagel' crowd. They provide GREAT service - staff are very nice and move the line along. If you want something special - extra butter, lite butter , etc. just ask and they do -They have my highest praise.
2014-11-20,2,A bagel is a bagel, I know, but I've definitely had better. They put way too much cream cheese on my bagel, did not have very many bagel flavors to choose from, and worst of all... served me my bagel cold and untoasted. I'm sure if I went back and reminded them to heat it and put on light cream cheese, it would be okay but there are definitely other bagel places in Hoboken to go to instead.
2014-10-26,5,My favorite bagel place in hoboken! Too much lox but that's okay because I just share with people who don't have lox. Sometimes I even give it to homeless because because even homeless people need omega 3s. That was a joke. But seriously it's a lot of lox and cream cheese
2014-10-25,4,HHB won our limited sample competition with the other bagel place down the street.  The bagels had the perfect snap crust and soft interior.  Maybe too much cream cheese, but that appears to be a common thing.
2014-10-19,2,One word... Meh. Actually 2.. Overrated. This place is really nothing special. There is always a line out the door and honestly the food isn't great. I am used to a Long Island BEC and the BEC sold here is disappointing.  I read the great reviews and was excited to try this place for breakfast but overall it was a sad experience.
2014-10-11,2,Good bagels, but nothing crazy!  It's extremely small so there is always a line out the door and it doesn't help with the stroller epidemic in Hoboken.  I've been coming here a lot more because Bagels on the Hudson is under renovation and there aren't ANY bagel places in the area.  It definitely satisfies my mood for a bagel and cream cheese.  The reason for my 2 stars is because they microwave taylor ham which is such a no no!!  I agree with everyone and just don't understand the hype around HHB..
2014-09-11,4,There is always a line out the door here for a reason: best bagels in Hoboken!!And don't worry, the line actually goes very fast. They have an array of beverages on your left when you walk in and a small staggered counter upfront. Bagels are fresh and delicious!Personal fav: everything with cream cheese and lox. Not to be mistaken for nova cream cheese, which is also delicious. I only wish that made their deli salads. Was bummed to see the store bought chicken salad being brought in in the morning.
2014-09-03,2,First time here and I got a roll with taylor ham, egg and cheese. 1 piece of taylor ham. The egg, cheese and ham was microwaved together. I expected better especially from good reviews about their bagel. I would have liked at least 4 pieces of taylor ham as I usually get form other places and cooked on a hot skillet. meh, good roll though.
2014-09-01,5,I love this place because I appreciate how consistent the food is. stay clear around 8am, but besides for the morning rush the service is always great and I've never had a bad experience!
2014-08-29,5,This place has yet to let me down. The service is quick and the staff is always friendly. So many options for bagels! I try to stop by towards the end of the day because I usually (magically!) find some extra bagels in my bag. My go to is a sausage, egg and cheese on an everything and Hoboken Hot Bagel certainly delivers on that one. Give them a try-your bagel standards will instantly be elevated.
2014-08-27,2,I don't understand the hype, I really really don't.  If these are the best bagels in Hoboken then we are in trouble.  I ordered two taylor ham, egg, and cheeses both on toasted everything with salt, pepper, and ketchup.  I was thrown by the size of this place as it is TINY and figured the flat top for the hot breakfast items was in the back.  However I was mistaken as nothing was cooked on a flat top but in a microwave.  Eggs were a scrambled blend not the traditional fried egg I am accostmed to.  Taylor ham was not crispy or cooked through.  Bagels were good but also very small.  Service was polite but a bit forgetful.  I think I was asked 5 times if I wanted salt, pepper, ketchup.    Not many other options for bagels in town which makes me very very sad. Hoping one of the 10 million brick over pizza places closes up shop and a true bagel store can be born.
2014-08-12,4,I know some folks have complained about the service here; maybe it's because I came on a weekday morning around 9am; the line was short, and the service friendly and fast.  I ordered a meh iced coffee and a whole wheat everything, scooped (these guys scoop out less than the NY shops do but I guess that's good?), toasted with light cream cheese.  The cream cheese was thankfully not lathered on and was ok in flavor.  The bagel was nice and salty as everything bagels should be a good size-- not too big, not too small.  Total $4.40. Glad I tried it- they're good but doesn't strike the top of my list.
2014-07-18,5,Love this place! The everything bagels are amazing. Get a sausage and egg on a bagel and it will sure be your favorite thing ever! If Taylor Ham is your thing, their Taylor ham, egg, and cheese, is also very tasty. Service is quick and they always let you know if bagels are warm if you want it toasted!! I brought a bag of bagels up to my former Tristate-area based parents when I went to visit them in Maine and they loved them! Will be bringing up a bag next time I head north as well.
2014-07-12,2,The attitude from the men who work at the counter is enough to keep me away from this place for a good month or so after each visit. One time I ordered a bagel with lox and cream cheese (about $7) plus another bagel with butter on the side. The guy said that he was going to have to charge me extra for the butter in the side because the containers cost money. I thought I was a joke, so I asked if he was kidding. Apparently not... The bagels are okay, sometimes a bit tough for my tastes, but they are really the only game in this part of town.
2014-07-12,3,Solid bagels. Better than Wonder Bagel in Jersey City, but a bit behind a lot of places in Manhattan. Arguably the best bagels in Hoboken. The outdoor seating is a huge plus.I've gotten chicken salad the past couple times and it's decent, but a bit heavy in mayo flavor.
2014-07-05,5,My favorite bagel spot in Hoboken. The bagels are always fresh, and the staff is friendly. The line is often long but it always moves quickly. It's a go to spot on a Sunday morning.
2014-04-15,5,Bagels are crispy & airy and with thinly sliced lox with onion, cream cheese, & tomato is outrageous! Great local bagel spot!
2014-04-08,5,Come here for the best bagels in Hoboken. This is my typical Saturday morning breakfast spot, and I have been coming here since I moved to Hoboken. My personal favorite: the classic everything bagel with cream cheese. The "everything" on the bagel is so flavorful and generously applied. I go non-toasted, so the cream cheese doesn't melt. I have even tried the famous bagel places around Manhattan, and I can honestly say I enjoyed the bagels here more than across the river. The people who work here are really nice also, they knew what I normally ordered when I walked up to the counter (until I started getting different bagels + cream cheeses).
2014-03-29,5,i haven't had a better bagel in town.  the service is great too.
2014-03-23,3,Ok bagels ...... Terrible lox...... I miss nyc :(
2014-03-16,5,Hoboken Hot Bagels is the best bagel store I have ever visited. The only problem with this fine bagel establishment is it's out of the way for me. It saddens me to have to leave my apartment 30 minutes earlier in order to go to what I refer to as "the good bagel shop" in the morning before work.If I'm up REAL early on Saturday I'll walk here for a bagel before my Saturday sandwich at Fiores.  The everything with cream cheese is solid and the bagels freeze well for what it's worth. They have just the right amount of crunch and have a ton of "everything" on them. Lots of bagel places skimp on the everything. Not so here, it's truly an everything bagel! I've never had a breakfast sandwich, so I can't say if they are good or not. The coffee is pretty good...but it's pretty tough to mess up coffee. Then again Bagels on the Hudson...
2014-03-02,1,Lose the unnecessary attitude at the counter. Bagels are fine, but this place perpetuates the horrendous customer service at bagel stores in Hoboken. It's not that difficult.
2014-03-01,4,Grabbed a quick lunch here and enjoyed it.There isn't too much to say about the staff or the decor as it's just a grab-and-go kind of place. But the sandwich I had was good! Nothing special, as it was just a turkey bagel sandwich, but I enjoyed it.It's a solid place and I'd come back for another sandwich. Actually, I'd like to try a breakfast sandwich soon.
2014-02-01,5,Yum! Such good bagels ! Everyone is really nice except the one girl who works there. She had an attitude with me twice and also ignored my requests. Maybe I'm over reacting? Either way love the bagels and (most of) the staff. Good whitefish salad. Coffee is good too! Reasonable prices
2014-01-24,4,Came in at about 8 AM on a weekday. There were only 3 people in front of me. Keep in mind that the place is small, so you need to take what you're having to-go. I ordered a plain bagel with scallion cream cheese and an OJ. Service was friendly and quick. The only thing I didn't like was that the cream cheese was applied and not really spread out. I would imagine that this is the reason they toast the bagel without asking you if you'd like it toasted -- so that the cream cheese will melt and spread. Only issue is that if you eat it immediately and don't wait for it to melt, you'll have an uneven distribution of the cream cheese. They did a nice job overall though. I'd go back if I was in the area.
2014-01-20,2,They have good bagels, but if you ask for anything other than plain bagels, you never know what you're gonna get.  Sometimes they don't properly toast bagels, sometimes they're burnt, and other times they're barely toasted. And if you ask for butter, most of the times the bagel is dripping and completely soaked through the bag from the amount of butter they put on, which is pretty disgusting.  The bagels themselves are pretty good, but they just don't know how to prepare them.  If you want butter, just make sure you specify that you don't want a lot.  My biggest issue with this place is some of the people behind the counter are lousy at serving.  I've gotten in the habit of getting BLT's on my bagels, but it's quite shocking how much the quality varies depending on who is serving you.  The young brothers are the only one I trust not to screw up an order.  The older guy is nice enough, but not great at preparing food, and the girl is terrible at serving, and she's often just obnoxious.  I sometimes just let people behind me order if I get to the front of the line and she's taking the next order because I hate ordering from her so much.The other day she was yelling at me and my girlfriend because we were trying to order, but the place was so crowded we couldn't see her.  There were about 4 people between us and the counter, and I didn't exactly feel like talking to the back of someone's head, so I was trying to wait so I could actually make eye contact.  Apparently she didn't want to wait for that so she started screaming "NEXT ORDER".  Not exactly a pleasant way to start your day.  And then, after I placed my order she rudely told us "we're not toasting bagels today". Nothing about the toaster being broken or anything, nothing apologetic, just a rude "we're not toasting bagels today".  It might have been helpful if they had put up a sign!  After 20 minutes of waiting in line, I find out they're not toasting????  How many of the customers ask for toasted bagels?  And how much time would it take you to put up a damn sign so your customers can NOT waste 20 minutes in line.  Of course, after being yelled at, and having my time wasted, I walked out, and I won't be returning.The bagels are decent quality here, but man, the service is just not worth it. It looks like they're renovating Hudson Bagels up the street... maybe if they reopen I'll start going there again.
2013-12-11,5,The bagels are outstanding. Best in Hobo. Don't let the line intimidate you. These guys and gals know what they're doing and even if you start with a spot past the outside railing, you'll be at the front within 10 minutes. Quick and friendly service. I usually get the everything bagel toasted (must specify) with chive cream cheese. Iced hazelnut coffee too. BOMB!!
2013-12-11,3,The service was very quick and I love the coffee station on the side. I was very disappointed that my egg whites were microwaved rather than cooked on a hot griddle, bad choice for a hot egg sandwich.
2013-11-26,3,Great bagels & fast breakfast. Always a line & you better have cash. Definitely recommend!
2013-11-13,5,So I am originally from the midwest - land of the chains.  So for breakfast when I needed something quick I would go to DD on my way to work. I started getting restless and annoyed that the ham egg and cheese on everything bagels toasted never had melted cheese, I mean common thats one of the main reasons you ask for cheese.  So I decided to give this place a shot which is next to a DD.  They use yummy taylor ham and the cheese is soooo melty! The everything bagels are covered in everything just the way I like it.  Best everything bagel I have ever had.  I have been here with people that got bagels other than everything and they werent the biggest of fans - I have never tried so I cant comment on that.  My suggestion - just get the everything you will love it!  The staff is great and friendly and make you feel at home.  They know my order when i walk through the doors. On the weekends there is a line out the doors.  Give it a go and on weekends come early so you dont miss out of the the everything! *Enjoy!
2013-10-06,3,Good bagels, good variety, way too small. Who the hell are these people who go to these tiny hole-in-the-wall places and bring in a full-sized stroller???The coffee was good. I had a coffee and a poppy with cream cheese, the husband had a cinnamon raisin with cream cheese, and the kid had a plain with cream cheese. She didn't want hers toasted but they toasted it anyway.Still, they were very quick and efficient and the bagels were good.
2013-09-26,4,I am glad I moved around the corner and have such a great bagel box in Hoboken.  It is the best one in town.  The bagels are what bagels should taste like.  A great dough with a light crust on the outside.  They are not the mushy things you get elsewhere or the bland ones you get at the chains.You can leave with a bagel and juice in the morning for under a fiver.  Unlike the weekend you are in and out in under 3 minutes.  With the weekend rush they are still on point and do not mess up your order.  The line does move fast so do not let it discourage you.There are a nice amount of options and it does not appear they are ever sold out of anything.
2013-07-16,4,The bagels are simply amazing!!! I had an everything bagel with egg, sausage, and ketchup. Delicious!! I was visiting the area and I went based off other yelp reviews and I'm glad I did. You have to know what you want because even though you feel like your at the end of the line, they will shout out and ask for your order. You don't want to hold up the line, especially on the day I went. Hoboken was having a heat wave and with the humidity, you don't want to be standing outside. My only complaint was the temperature inside...it needs to be cooler on hot days.
2013-07-03,4,Hoboken bagels may look like another hole-in-the wall bagel joint...and it is. But they're honestly the best bagel place in Hoboken. My Sunday morning pick is a toasted whole wheat bagel with veggie cream cheese and lox. Delicious!
2013-06-24,4,Despite the annoyingly long line on the weekends, this place is a slam dunk. They have a ton of bagel varieties, AND they put salt on their everything bagels which some places, surprisingly, don't do. They have a great selection of bagels and the prices are way cheaper than the Smashery.
2013-06-04,1,The bagels I got here were burned and dry. I was so disappointed cuz I went by the reviews brought them home to CA because there are no good bagels here and ended up throwing out half of them.
2013-06-01,1,If you like tiny, soggy bagel sandwiches with a side of eye roll and attitude, then this is the place for you!
2013-04-08,3,Best bagels in Hoboken, generous with the cream cheese or chicken salad, but they microwave their eggs and that has to be -2.  Outdoor seating is great, but just 3 stools at a counter inside; the line often goes out the door on weekends but moves fairly quickly.
2013-03-09,2,I'm a huge everything bagel fan and have been to this place many times. I do like the fact that they put salt on the everything's, but the bagels are a bit denser than I would like. The dough is quite dense and not necessarily fluffy, still not bad though. My one complaint is that when you order a breakfast sandwich they don't fry the eggs right then they may use a micro or something, I don't know but I'm not a huge fan of getting sandwiches from here
2013-03-08,4,There's a reason there is always a line out the door on Saturday and Sunday mornings. Their bagels are awesome! Toasted everything with cream cheese which is seasoned on both sides is out of this world.  There's also a huge variety of cream cheese available surely will satisfy any craving, day or night!I am totally hooked on this place!
2013-02-18,3,Been there a few times. I usually try a bagel place out by getting a bagel with lox and cream cheese. Not bad at all but I think they might be a little pricey and the bagel sizes could be a little bigger. Those are my only complaints but otherwise a pretty solid place.
2013-02-13,4,Best bagel sandwich in hoboken. Hands down. And great prices, too. You can put practically any ingredient you can imagine on your bagel sandwich, they have it all.  Good quality meat and cheese and the bagels are always super fresh (like just out of the oven, fresh). During the "rush hour" (ie: pre-work or mid-morning on weekends) don't be intimidated by the long line...they really speed through it and you'll never spend more than a few minutes waiting!
2013-02-12,4,Toasted everything bagel with cream cheese was excellent and with a drink, was under $4.  Tough to beat the price and quality.
2013-02-04,4,In a town that is surprisingly devoid of quality bagels, Hoboken Hot Bagels shall reign supreme.they do it right.  Small place that has that bagel stop smell in it which reminds me of Sundays growing up.  Service is very fast, and the men and women who work there seem to always be polite and courteous, no matter how many people are there.Bagels taste great and fresh.Plus - they have YooHoo.  Great way to start a Sat or Sun.
2013-01-25,5,Best bagel joint in town, fresh every day with home made cream cheese. Great for a light breakfast in the warm months with their outdoor seating. They have by far the BEST bagels in Hoboken. Very small, do not plan on eating inside.
2013-01-08,5,These bagels truly are "as good as it gets".  If you're used to grocery store bagels or even "authentic" but average bagels, you'll be amazed at what you've been missing.  Perfect crisp shell and soft (but not doughy) inside - and substantially sized enough to make an actual sandwich from.Really, I can't think of any way to improve them!
2012-11-04,3,Decent breakfast spot in Hoboken- Midtown, located right by Dunkin Donuts..Nice people who work the counter and haven't messed up an order in all my years of going here. Bagels are the BEST when fresh but some things aren't as fresh as I'd like them to be.      Nonetheless a good place to grab a Cream Cheese bagel, in my personal opinion - not so good for Bacon Egg and Cheese or anythingb e c a u s e.......---------------------------------------------I don't do the whole microwaved eggs thing. 3 Stars  because they survive on Washington St
2012-10-20,3,The bagels here are pretty good. I've stopped by a few times for a cheap breakfast/snack option and its been to my satisfaction. You pick from the options behind the counter and they toast it and make it up pretty fast. The only thing that kind of bothers me is the fact that they use store bought cream cheese spreads. My bagel place near AC is similar, only they have more bagel options and they mix up all their own cream cheese spreads, blending them with fresh ingredients to create unique flavors. It just brings the bagels up a notch and makes for something all the more delicious. Hoboken Hot Bagels should get innovative and make their own fresh cream cheese flavors.
2012-10-19,5,My favorite bagel in the world and I'm from a town, Livingston, that should claim that title but sadly does not.  Crispy outside, chewy inside, perfect every time.
2012-09-30,3,while visiting a friend in Hoboken, I walked over to Hoboken bagels for breakfast.  I had a onion bagel, fresh out of the oven, with some locks cream cheese ($3) It was a pretty good bagel but not the best and frankly there are better places in Manhattan.  Dunken Donuts is nearby if you want some coffee although this place does have coffee too - i did not taste it though.
2012-08-25,4,You could easily pass up this tiny little bagel place on Washington St. Don't. This is one of the few good bagel places in Hoboken, if not the best.There's not much seating here. No bathroom. The selection of cream cheeses are limited. But what this place does have are really good, fresh bagels. I had to practically hurdle over the work table that have inside. The tiny place was open but they took their sweet time in getting organized. Barely three people could fit inside the store with the obstructions. Now on to the good part: the bagels.Hoboken hot bagels has perfected the cooked, "crunchy outside and soft inside" way of making bagels. You want a fairly good crunchy to soft ratio in bagel selection. This is one of the few places where I forgive a place for not having a wide variety of cream cheeses and bagels. The bagels stand for themselves. People usually think New York when it comes to bagels but it's nice to see that Jersey can put out a decent bagel as well.
2012-08-09,4,As I've said in another review I've written, cream cheese really makes a bagel place for me.  As long as the bagels aren't bad, the cream cheese can make up for it, but this place manages to have both.Their amigo bagel is a delicious blend of salsa and jalapenos if I'm not mistaken, and their poppy seed bagel is the best I've had in years.  Their bagels are not as large as many in the area and are probably a little more on the side of being dense rather than doughy, so you have to see if this style suits you.  I prefer their bagels toasted and they usually ask, but when they get busy they may not, so make sure you let them know if you want your bagel toasted.Their veggie cream cheese is easily the best I've tasted since Einstein Bro's, but in my experience it doesn't keep well (maybe ~3 days or so in the fridge before it starts smelling funky).  I'm not usually a fan of sun-dried tomato cream cheese, but theirs is excellent along with the scallion and the jalapeno cream cheese.I know people complain that their eggs are made in the microwave, and I agree that this is one area that could use some improvement, but really it's palatable enough.  I love egg and cheese with pepper on their poppy bagel; it's one of my favorite breakfasts.The staff is also friendly and pretty quick.  They clearly know many of the regulars and greet them by name.  Overall, this is an awesome bagel place; I only wish they delivered!
2012-07-16,2,Meh..... microwaved eggs but outdoor seating on a hot day made this manageable....shouldn't have came. ended up at dunkin donuts across the st for an iced coffee. Shoulda started there
2012-07-11,4,the best bagels in Hoboken, a town sorely lacking of quality bagel establishments (and breakfast places in general). they cook 'em the right way - so they're shiny and crispy. sometimes the taste resembles a quality barroom German pretzel! good prices and staff as well.if you want a breakfast sandwich just cook your own at home, using their bagels. the place is too small for a grill. an extra star will be easy to provide if they ever expand, and they would be wise to do so.
2012-07-08,3,Great bagels....but they get 3 stars from me for nuking the eggs.  The other bagel places in Hoboken actually cook their eggs on a flattop or stove, but they don't have better bagels.  That's where you need to make your decision.  Especially since you see your egg get cracked into a plastic cup and thrown into the microwave if you order an egg sandwich.  I'll always get my bagels from there, but I think they should get at least a hot-plate!!!!
2012-07-02,4,Great, cheap bagels. I recommend the great selection of cream cheeses over the egg sandwiches.
2012-06-27,4,Their bagels are fresh, not too doughy, and baked to perfection. The outside is somewhat crispy.The prices are fair, about $1/bagel without cream cheese. They have a very large selection of bagel flavors. They sell some other snacks too. Don't be fooled by its quant exterior, these are some of the best bagels in the area.
2012-06-11,4,Why exactly is there a Dunkin' Donuts around the corner from this place? In my opinion it's because this place just doesn't stand out when you're walking past it on the street. I recently had to stop drinking coffee (or at least the volume I was consuming) so I stopped going to the Dunkin' on the corner. One day, while walking with my fiancé, she suggested we go into Hoboken Hot Bagels for a small coffee and an everything bagel. I literally couldn't believe I had walked past the place so many times and never even noticed it! Well, I won't make that mistake again!Not only were the bagels FRESH and DELICIOUS! The butter was some of the best I've tasted, the coffee RIVALED that of anyone in town, the tea selection was incredible, and the price was downright CHEAP!! This place is the best, and they have a wonderful wonderful selection of baked goods too!! It's a must if you're in this area of Hoboken
2012-05-30,3,You know what happens Sunday morning when the big dog rises? I'll give you a hint, it rhymes with- schmungry schfor schbagels.Tried this place a couple of times (note the tried) It's really not a bad place, just a little sketchy looking. I'll just dive right into the details:PRO's-For some strange reason, I am able to find a parking spot close by. Bizarro, but definitely a pro-Always have bagels. Been to some places where after 12, their bagel supply consists of the scraps-Staff is friendly and moves pretty quicklyCON's-Their bagels are OK. So if you read my other reviews, I have reviewed a place called Bagel Spot. That's the epitome of a a bagel jumpoff. Maybe I've just been spoiled my entire life with legit bagels, but it just seems like whenever I take a bite into my bagel from here, my teeth are at risk of falling out.-No grill. So this may strike you as "unique." Being a tiny tiny tiny place, there just isn't room for a grill. This means that egg sandwiches are made via microwave. Not horrid, but not my first choice when I want a B.A.P taylor ham, egg, cheese.LBD Scale- 6. Unfortunately, I don't see much of a trending upward either. Seems like the place is perfecto for people living in Hoboken. If you have a car, you may be able to find a place that will suit your bageling needs.
2012-05-23,4,Thank G for HHB. Tried their bagels per the suggestion of a fellow Yelper and I'm glad I did. Bagels were fresh, not overbearing, chewy, and delicious. I went with the porkroll, egg & cheese to nurse my hangover, and it did just that. They're generous with the cream cheese, beware!!!
2012-05-01,5,I love bagelsssssss. Ok, truth is that I love NJ bagels and yet living in MA, I have very very few of these. This place was tiny (but Charrito's operates a full restaurant in the same size so no real excuses) and they have salt bagels. I got six to take home with me and one for there. They are generous with the cream cheese, and despite not having a ton of preservatives (I would hope), they are still good two days later.
2012-04-06,4,Definitely the best bagels in Hoboken, but that isn't saying much because the bagels in Hoboken are not very good.  This place is the exception.  They are one of the only, if not THE only, place that actually cooks their bagels the right way--by properly boiling them (which is what gives bagels that shiny, crispy layer on the outside).  Pretty much everywhere else in town just gives you bread with a hole in it which does not really count as a bagel in my book.  Hoboken Hot Bagels has a decent selection of bagels and assorted cream cheeses.  Try the Amigo bagel, which has jalapenos, and goes well with the sundried tomato cream cheese.
2012-03-25,3,Pros: Their bagels and coffee are good  They make a good, crispy bagel. Vegetable cream cheese is good too. Cons: The store is the size of a closet. I ordered an egg sandwich....it looked like they microwaved the eggs......what? No grill? And they put way too much black pepper.  Stick with the bagel and cream cheese or butter.
2012-02-13,4,I had to check this place out after reading all the good reviews.  I made a short trek from JC the other weekend, and knowing what a mob scene Washington st can be, i went early Sunday morning (10ish).  The place is not for claustrophobic types. It was crammed with just a few people and the line was growing quickly. Most folks were busy ordering individual bagel combos. I came to try a half dozen. Ordered everything, onion and cinnamon raisin bagels. They were piping hot. I couldn't contain myself and ate one of the hot numbers on the drive back to JC.  Soooo, I like the piping hot bread out of the oven, but it was a bit too soft on the inside. The raisin one was a miss. I wanted more chew factor.  Pretty good but I still like Brooklyn Bagels better.
2012-01-06,5,The most delicious bagels in Hoboken, perhaps my favorite bagels in the world! In fact, on the rumored 2012 doomsday I plan to start my day off with a sesame bagel with cream cheese from this, the most glorious bagel establishment. At least I'll know I've had one of life's little treasures on my last day.The place is a hole in the wall - recently improved with some snazzy new brighter lighting - yup. You heard me... you can see in here now! Perhaps someday there will be a regular crazy light show up in here... at least a girl can dream. The tiny establishment always fills up quickly with a line almost out the door - word to the wise about this line... get in it. Wait. Eventually you will be first and someone will take your order. After you've given your order, step to the left and wait patiently for the same person who took your order to give you your ordered goodness and accept your payment. It's always a bumble-jumble up at the front of the line, especially when you get first-time orderers at the front of the line. Oh, and a personal request to the stroller mafia in Hoboken, please leave your stroller outside. There is no room for your stroller inside. No room at all.All of the bagels are fresh. In fact, they are so fresh that sometimes when you request a toast (not champagne, ok?) they tell you, "umm, m'am those bagels just came out of the oven and are hot. do you really your bagel toasted?" The cream cheeses are also delicious and can be ordered in a tub or on your bagel - the schmears on the bagels are enough for at least two bagels. Y-U-M-M-Y!!!I can't say enough about quality of the bagels. I got a block and a half out of my way to avoid the sub-par bagel joint closer to my house. Oh, and in the warm weather there are tables outside so you can actually sit and enjoy your bagel.BTW, they close at 2:00pm!
2011-12-13,4,So far Hoboken Hot Bagels is my winner for the best bagel in Hoboken. The bagels are good. They are not the size of my head which I must say I prefer - if a bagel is the size of my head, I am helpless against the power of the bread, and I eat the whole thing and then feel sick. These bagels are a nice size. The prices are reasonable - $2.20 for a bagel with peanut butter. The service is friendly. Now if they could only either double the size of the shop, or come up with a different process for ordering and waiting for one's bagel(s), this place would be great. It is always such a cluster inside unless it's really early in the morning and I'm the only one there. I always feel so awkward - well I ordered, now where do I stand? There is nowhere you can stand without feeling like you're in ten peoples' way. This really is a small issue though. Now I am just wishing I had a Hoboken Hot Bagel in my hot little hand!
2011-11-05,3,Absolutely reliable, this place is a classic hole in the wall bagel shop. I think its the best one in Hoboken. They have all the standards, but they just do it better than everyone else. I have high standards for bagels (Montreal) so I can't go to high on the 'ole star rating. If we are heading out of town for a long road trip we will load up here with a solid breakfast sandwich. A little crazy inside during breakfast hour, but you'll never spend more than five minutes in there despite the line. Careful with the orange juice that's were they take you for a ride!
2011-10-16,2,slightly better than reheating frozen ones..nice peopleorganized staff, line moves quickly not cheap
2011-08-22,5,The. Best. Bagels. Friendly, quick service too!
2011-08-12,3,The bagels and cream cheese are absolutely amazing however, the chaos that exudes from walking throught the door up until you leave is beyond annoying... The ordering process is close to impossible because not only can you not see over the ridiculously high counter, the staff is rude and incompetant.  Its hard to figure where the line begins and where the line ends, additionally it's a cat and mouse game trying to  figure out how to pay, where to pay and in what order to pay. So if you want an incredible bagel (if they get your order right) WITH all the hassle, then this is the place to go!
2011-07-22,2,Not the best bagels you'll ever had, but not the worst. Cream cheeses were average. You'll feel claustrophobic when walking in- Bagels on the Hudson is better.
2011-04-30,5,The bagels are bananas! Whole Wheat Everything and Cinnamon Raisin....mmmmm!
2011-04-26,5,Best bagels in Hoboken hands down.  They always taste very fresh and flavorful.
2011-04-10,2,I was so excited by the positive Yelp reviews, so I went here to try a cinnamon raisin bagel with plain cream cheese, the only bagel kind I really get.  Boy was I disappointed!  It was a little tiny, and it wasn't doughy or the least bit sweet.  The cream cheese was slightly gooey and tasted like what I think glue would look and taste like.  It was $1.95 for a bagel with cream cheese, in case you're wondering.  I, on the other hand, will gladly walk to the bagel shop next to the path and pay $0.19 more for better bagels and cream cheese.  I don't think I'll be coming here again anytime soon.
2011-03-08,5,I work in Manhattan and import my bagels every morning from Hoboken because nothing I've found in the city even comes close! HB is a small, super efficient shop that will have you in and out in minutes with as many bagels as you heart desires. And they don't skimp on the cream cheese. Which means they've earned 6 stars in my book.
2011-02-20,1,moved back to the area after being in CA for 7 years.  I was hoping to try a real NY bagel and this place really  disappointed me.  I ordered an everything bagel toasted and it was burnt and all I tasted was salt.  I ordered a cinnamon raisin too with butter and it was fair at best.I would never go back.
2011-01-31,2,Worst hot bagel I have ever had. I called in a Taylor ham, egg and cheese on a plain bagel and by the time I got there it was cold because rather than wrapping the bagel in foil, they used white dell paper. Ketchup looked and tasted like it had been mixed with BBQ. Stick with the cream cheese or go elsewhere.
2011-01-20,4,Definitely the best bagels in Hoboken.  I wish they were open 24/7 but when they are open there is no other choice.  Their are large but not over-sized and they constantly dump in more fresh bagels.  There's also a full spread of custom cream cheeses for you to try.  I believe this bagel shop is also cheaper than the others and a whole heckuva lot nicer too.Try anything, its all good.-"Frat Boy"
2011-01-19,4,Hoboken Bagels has some of the best bagels I have ever tried (sorry H&H).  Their bagels have just the right crust, and are nice and soft on the inside.  They are perfect for loading up with cream cheese, onion, tomato, and some good lox.  I can't wait to grab some lox from Russ and Daughters and throw it on a Hoboken bagel.  They also have bagel bites, which are little bagel nibbles that are very well priced if you are looking for something differrent to try.
2010-11-21,4,if you are looking for the traditional new york style bagel, hoboken bagels fits the bill.  these bagels are smaller than the puffed out versions that have taken over as normal.  i found the bagels to be fresh and tasty.  the one thing is that this is near stevens and Sunday morning is like a frat/college boy hang out.  go for the bagels.  ignore the frat boys.
2010-11-19,4,For some reason, Hoboken seems to be lacking in bagel places (which is probably good for my health!) and this very well may be the best one here.  Finally, just this morning, I took a stroll down to this tiny place.  The everything bagels are awesome and the cream cheese is quite good.  It was $4-and-change for a bagel with cream cheese and tomato and a large coffee which is pretty reasonable.  My only complaint?  They need to step up their coffee game...It's gray-ish in color and funky tasting.
2010-10-06,5,I love Hoboken Bagels! The quality is undeniable. I have also tried Bagels on the Hudson, but I will walk the extra block to get to Hoboken Bagels. The staff is usually friendly and the bagels are to die for. The morning bagels with cream cheese come with enough cream cheese to feed a small village, but so do most other bagel shops in NYC. Hoboken Bagels will also make a bagel sandwich for you around lunch time, however there is no established lunch menu so you have to go in knowing what you want on your sandwich. It's a hole in the wall, but I love it!
2010-08-26,4,Bagels are fresh, hot and tasty and best of all fast and cheap. This place is a legit bagel shop.
2010-03-28,4,The only thing keeping this place from getting five stars is the lack of quality bagel toppings such as good nova, herring, etc.  Otherwise this is one of the best fresh bagel places in the tri-state area.  hand rolled, boiled and perfect. Not overly huge rolls masquerading as bagels.  Take it from this Jew, these are the real deal. Enjoy.
2010-03-07,3,Beware egg and meat sandwiches were all microwaved. They were still good though but could've been better if they were made on a grill.
2010-01-24,5,This is the closest bagel place to my apartment, and it's always busy.  The bagels are delicious and if to go early in the morning, they're still hot out of the oven!
2009-09-07,4,Crowded, tiny, noisy and smelling delicious - this is how bagel shops are supposed to be.  My BF had a bacon and egg on an everything bagel and just about swallowed it in three big bites (he was hungry, and it was good).  I tried the bagel holes and wished I had bought more. Never had a bagel hole before (just like a donute hole) and it was cute and bitesize which was exactly what I was looking for before a big day out.
2009-07-15,4,the best bagel joint in Hoboken!great variety and price. good selection of teas and juice as well.their sausage/egg/cheese on a bagel is an extremely viable contender against the Dunkin Donuts sausage/egg/cheese on a croisssant.
2009-07-12,5,Hoboken Hot Bagels makes THE BEST Taylor Ham (pork roll), egg & cheese bagel sandwiches. I lived in Hoboken while attending Stevens, and I miss them so much now. I've been living in Los Angeles for the past couple of years, but my wife and I end up returning to Jersey City pretty frequently (where she has family). EVERY time we're back in Jersey I make sure we swing by Hoboken Hot Bagels to get a Taylor Ham, egg & cheese on an everything bagel. This past weekend, my wife made the trip back to NJ without me, and she's bringing two sandwiches back with her on the plane.A few reviewers on various websites have complained about the fact that they microwave their eggs instead of frying them on a griddle.  I was skeptical at first too, but then I tasted the sandwich.  If you can ditch your snobby side, you'll notice that the eggs come out much lighter & fluffier -- and tastier -- than if they had been fried.  Their slices of Taylor Ham are nice and thick, too; so the whole bagel-to-fillings ratio ends up being something like 2:1.As for the quality of the bagel, they are just the right taste, texture and size.  (This place has resisted the urge to jumbo-size.)  The NY Times wrote a little article on them, which they have posted on the wall of the shop.  It's online, too.  nytimes.com/2004/01/04/n...I just wish they would stay open later.  Oh, and I don't really recommend their coffee.
2009-04-02,5,Hands down the best bagels on the planet.  The only other that comes close is H & H in the city.  Chewiness is key and these are definitely that.  Please DON'T give me a bready bagel.  Their everything is to die for.  Keep it simple, though. The cream cheese is not the best.....tastes like they cut it with flour or something.  But you absolutely can't beat the bagels.  And unlike Murray's in the city (totally overrated if you ask me) Hoboken Bagels will actually toast it for you.
2009-03-21,4,Best place to get bagels in Hoboken -- so far that I've tasted. I had lox cream cheese on a sesame bagel with tomato and it was delicious.  Warm without needing toasting, chewy, and all around yumminess.
2008-08-08,3,I had the lox and cream cheese and it was a bit saltier than I was expecting, but the bagel was delish.  They load your bagel up with lots of shmear.  Loves it... didn't like the super saltiness.I'd go back, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it either.
2008-07-29,5,These are the best bagels on the planet (and there's no place better in Hoboken). I've been eating them since the place opened and I've never found better bagels. They are chewy on the inside with a nice crusty outside, which is what is always missing from other bagels. On Saturday and Sunday mornings, there's usually a wait.
2008-02-09,5,If you've walked past Hoboken Bagels on a weekend, then you don't need to read this review. The line coming out the door is a testament to the quality of the bagels.The most remarkable thing about Hoboken Bagels is how fast that line moves given the fact that there is only about 4 people on staff. The trick is that there is no assembly line. One employee sees your order through from start to finish. The bagels are amazing. The cream cheese is mountainous. The prices are reasonable.I've eaten a lot of bagels. Hoboken Bagels are-by far-the best. I grew up on their bagels and swear by them. They have the best prices around - I implore you to find a cheaper lox and cream cheese bagel.
