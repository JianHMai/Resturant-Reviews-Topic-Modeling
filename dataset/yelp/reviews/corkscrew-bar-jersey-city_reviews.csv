2021-11-03,5,You'll be greeted by a sign saying "Best Burger in the Heights" ... and we can safely say that it's true after trying their amazing burgers
2021-10-23,5,Ok, sooooo, we were unable to go to Hudson Burgers and Beer in North Bergen due to it not being open????? We waited a reasonable amount of time at opening time and still dark inside. Anyway we always wanted to try Corkscrew Bar in the Jersey City Heights and OH BOY ! Let me tell you ! This place was awesome ! First we had the sweet and spicy wings (12). They must have been brined because they were absolutely wonderful, tender fall off the bone inside and crispy sweet and spicy outside ! Mannn they are good, Next we went for the cheddar burgers (Pat LaFreida). Short rib blend, OMG awesome. And to top things off the chef really knows how to prepare her stuff! In addition to that we had the most attentive, polite awesome waitress/barperson, (Allison). Everybody was wonderful, beers were COLD! And prices were reasonable ! Thank you Corkscrew bar !
2021-09-20,3,Ordered the crispy chicken sandwich, Cajun fries and a jersey burger. For delivery 3 items came out to $50 for less than a 10 min drive away. The chicken sandwich although crispy was inconsistently salted. Some bites were savory others were completely bland. My boyfriend got the jersey burger medium rare but the pink to cooked ratio was overwhelming. Nothing special about either food item and definitely not worth wasting $50.
2021-09-04,5,Amazing burgers and a nice little seating area outside. Service is a little slow but that's ok as my husband and I love to come after work and chill.
2021-06-28,3,I'm giving this a lower than expected rating for a couple reasons.The employee cooking our food was visually working without a hair net, and seemed to not have the highest standards of health and food safety. Other than that the bartender that served us did a great job, she was friendly and pleasant with everyone in the bar. Overall I appreciate businesses that go above and beyond for food safety.
2021-06-04,5,AmaZing burgers & bbq wings! Very generous on the sauces for fries. Loved their menu!
2021-05-26,5,Great spot with great service and food.  Burgers are top notch.  They have pretty nice TV's for sports as well.
2021-04-30,2,Not here to review the food.  Sandwiches don't come with fries.  At $13-18, the expectation is fries.  Don't give me some canned "oh sorry the menu is wasn't clear" BS.  No time for bad business practices.  Operating a restaurant isn't all about saving a buck here and there.  Lost what would have been a return customer because I hate feeling like someone fleeced me.
2021-04-16,3,I needed a spot for delivery and found this on a delivery app. Before I ordered I also checked the Yelp reviews and they passed the test.  The burgers seemed to be the go to here so I went with it.  I went with a simple burger with american cheese and tomato. I ordered it medium and they did a good job cooking it. The burgers don't come with fries but you can order them a la carte. They have shoestring fries here so they are a little thinner but I like it that way.  Here is what tripped me up about the experience... it was $12 for buffalo fries and $5.50 for fries without toppings. That was bizarre. The portion wasn't bigger and the toppings didn't warrant doubling the price. Not sure if it was a typo or a mistake on the app but I wouldn't reorder the fries with toppings because of that. In the end, it was a serviceable meal and my craving for a burger was satisfied. It wasn't a burger I would rave about but it did the job.
2021-03-18,4,This place is the perfect hidden gem with amazing bar food.  It's a few blocks off the light rail, which is nice.  If you like burgers this is definitely the place to get one.  I am obsessed with their sweet potato fries and get them every time.  Beer/drink selection is good.  The staff is great.  This place is small, so on busy days you may have to wait a bit for a table or opt for takeout. We have been here twice and both times were amazing.  We will be back again for sure.
2021-03-10,5,We had just pulled into town and most places were closing. This place saved our butts. The burgers and wings were first rate. We took out b/c of Covid, but it looks like a fun place to hang.
2021-03-07,5,I went here to celebrate my birthday with a couple of girlfriends!!! Absolutely loved the vibe here and the servers (didn't catch their name) were super friendly and it is a pretty chill atmosphere! Will definitely go there again
2021-01-24,4,Really good, straight ahead bar food. They ain't fancy, but they don't need to be! The burgers, fries & chicken fingers are all tasty. This is the first place I'd ever been to that tosses the chicken in the honey mustard sauce to coat it. Amazingly simple thing, with amazingly wonderful results! A good beer selection & friendly staff make this a recommend.
2021-01-20,5,I had eaten here before but it has been maybe two years? And i remember it being a cool place to grab drinks and eat with a group of people. I was craving a burger and decided to take a chance. Why i say a chance? Well when you have your food delivered, there is a chance of it being soggy, messy etc. but wow! Our food was delivered and the presentation of the food was as if i am eating at the place. I highly recommend this spot and their food! My bf had the smokehouse burger and i had the Sriracha burger! Sooo good!
2020-12-30,5,Awesome little "dive" spot that we stumbled upon. They have a small kitchen to the side of the bar which is really cool in my opinion that slings pat lafrieda burgers, which are cooked PERFECTLY. They have wings and fries on the menu as well. You'll find a great assortment of craft beers from the area as well. I love this place it's just a few blocks walk from the light rail as well, which is super convenient.
2020-12-20,5,This bar is awesome we have been in here many times and the service is great. Food and drinks are always on point. Prices and quality is sooo good.
2020-12-01,5,A local gem, my favorite cozy bar to sneak in a quick meal, or spend all afternoon catching up with a friend on their outdoor patio. As far as the food, my friend told me Nicole's burgers were the best she ever had. I'm a veggie and with loads of options from the Buffalo cheese fries, to the delicious veggie burger the food really never disappoints. Nicole and her team are crazy knowledgeable about their large variety of local beers which is think really cool. They also have yummy old fashions in a barrel. If you haven't gone your missing out.
2020-11-29,2,I ordered the Buffalo Chicken bar pie. Wound up throwing half of it out. Some of the chicken was under cooked or very sinewed (gristle). Seems like scrap pieces were thrown on the pizza. Not recommended.
2020-11-22,3,Nice little local restaurant in the Jersey City heights. Came by for brunch, was seated outdoors in late October, wish they had some heating lamps. Service was decent for football Sunday, our server was bouncing around and working very hard. Food was okay, portions could of used some sprucing up; particularly the breakfast burrito. The breakfast burrito on the menu states it comes with home fries but came to realize it was like 3 pieces of potatoes IN the burrito, meh. If you live close by definitely worth going to wet your whistle, not sure I'd cross through town to go back personally.
2020-11-01,1,I'm not the type of person too leave reviews. The experience here for the first time was horrible. I ordered a veggie burger and it was fried and greasy! I ended up with food poisoning. I ordered a beer and it had soap in it. Terrible service. The food didn't even come out at the same time. The server didn't even remember everyone's order. I was highly disappointed.
2020-10-01,4,The location is not the best, but the food, omg,let me tell you something, the chicken wings and jalapeños cheddar burger are probably the best one I've never had. Yes they are GOOOOOD.  The waiter was really friendly and told us everything about the food and beer. I had really good time there.
2020-09-05,5,Corkscrew has y favorite buffalo chicken wrap in the neighborhood. The bartenders are also super friendly and knowledgeable on their beer options!
2020-07-30,3,We ordered delivery from here tonight for the first time. We ordered the chicken Caesar wrap, shoestring fries, and jalapeño cheddar burger with bacon added.I'll start with the pros:Everything arrived early thanks to Postmates delivery. Everything was packed neatly, no spills. Everything in order was correct. I like their logo stickers! The chicken Caesar wrap was full of chicken and a little lettuce. Flavor of Caesar dressing was good. The shoestring fries was a decent portion. The jalapeño cheddar burger was a good size and tasted great! I loved that it was rare (though that's not what was ordered). Bacon was good.Now the Cons:Burger didn't arrive hot, unfortunately. The jalapeños on the burger were not spicy lol. For the up charge I would have appreciated more bacon. The special instructions for the fries were not followed. We asked for them to be burnt and extra crispy. They were not. The chicken Caesar wrap was small for $12 and there was a lot of wrap, so it definitely could've been filled more. If not with more chicken, add more lettuce to stuff it!
2020-04-15,5,A Constant In The Crazy : Everything about our world right now  is uncertain, unnatural and unfortunate. So I'm more thankful than ever for Nichole and the team at The Corkscrew for risking themselves to provide us a bit of "constant in the crazy". Each day they are cooking for us and providing fantastic take out at a more than reasonable price with the same wonderful customer service and quality. Today was the Screw Burger and 12 BBQ wings. Hit and delicious even after the trek back to my place. PLEASE... give yourself a treat and a break from cooking and support this local gem as they try to provide the "constant in the crazy" that we all need so much right now.  Thanks and stay healthy everyone!PS: don't forget to dig deep when it's time to tip!
2020-03-07,3,This is a good example of an OK bar in the heights.  Food is pretty consistent, it's impressive what is acomplished with such a small grill.  Service can be spotty depending which bartender you get.  Definitely a neighborhood bar.  If you're not with the in clique be prepared to feel left out.  May try again.  Drinks are pricy for a neighborhood dive.  Worth a visit.  Decide for yourself.
2020-02-23,5,I'm recently  new to the neighborhood and I came here on a whim. I originally ordered take out but ended up wanting to stay and I was able to eat the meal at the bar. Very friendly staff and attentive. I look forward to coming bacK. Thanks for having me!
2020-02-22,5,Very relaxed bar! Great food, nice staff, affordable, and a chill ambiance. Multiple TVs to watch games. Highly recommend if you are looking to go to a local bar.
2020-02-09,5,I've been coming  to the corkscrew for 3 years and  I couldn't recommend a better bar. Great food. Better service. The best people in the business. Nicole, Rachel, Maria, Carlos, Darrell, Elliott, Dennis. The best ever!!!! Don't change a thing!
2020-02-06,3,Decent place to get a cheap beer and some fries. They have an indoor grill, but it's really just standard bar food.I do like their trivia nights because they always find a way of getting you a free drink, but it's a little annoying when you're trying to watch a game on a Thursday night.
2020-01-10,5,This is my second visit to Corkscrew Bar.  My first experience was great so when the hubby, son and his friends wanted a sports bar that was casual, quick and close to the school (Saint Peters U), I thought of this place.    It was a Sunday and the Eagles were playing.                  E A G L E S...Eagles!   The son had a b-ball game prior so we rushed over to Corkscrew in hopes that it wasn't too crowded for the five us to squat a spot. Corkscrew is a local bar on a corner in a residential area.  You would easily miss it if you weren't familiar with the area.  Thanks to Yelp in finding this hidden gem.  It's very casual with just a bar and a few tables near windows.When we arrived we were lucky to find a booth for all of us.  We immediate sat down to watch the Eagles game.  Our waitress Rachel came over, we shared words and she immediately remember us.  We ordered a couple beers and a Moscow mule.  Our apps were wings (bbq and honey mustard) which were good.  Entrees were Quesadillas, Burgers w/the egg (Jersey Burger?) and Grilled Chicken sandwich.  All of the sandwiches came with fries, sweet potatoe, waffle or regular.  We had all three.   This place is great for watching a game.  Not big but comfy enough to enjoy the food and conversation.  The service is always good and their hamburgers are the best.
2020-01-04,5,We happened upon this bar after brunch and had a great experience. The bartender was lovely and very knowledgeable. The place was also kid friendly, which is a plus since we have a 3 year old. We look forward to coming back!
2020-01-04,3,Corkscrew Bar is a typical local bar. It's pretty hidden and off the beaten path, so if I didn't see it on Yelp, I probably would have never stumbled upon it. It's a tiny little place with 1 bar that runs the length of the establishment, in the photos I saw a pool table, however in real life they haven't had one in ages.I came to Corkscrew with a group of friends - on a Friday night it was mildly busy so you could actually get the attention of the bartender which I liked. We ordered a some drinks like the Manmosa & some food like Threesome (Cajun waffle fries, Mozzarella Sticks, and Buffalo Wings)
2020-01-02,5,Came in with a party of two for a beer. I was pleasantly surprised by the service and amount of different beers on the menu. We order chicken wings, which were battered and not my favorite, but they were good. We also ordered some fries with this mayo sauce that was delicious and I def recommend. I was in the mood to drink beer, but since I don't know much about it I ordered the beer flight and asked for recommendations. The bartender recommended great choices for the two of us, even tho we had completely different tastes. Out of the 10 beers, we liked 9 of them!!! I was very impressed!!!
2019-12-01,5,The service was amazing the food was delicious and the prices weren't high! Definitely recommend this place.
2019-11-23,5,The best burger in jersey city by far....excellent taste, perfectly cooked, awesome bar..
2019-11-13,5,Great neighborhood bar. Best burger in the Heights,period. Darts, games, keno, karaoke, open mics.
2019-11-07,5,OMG!!!!! this place has the best fucking burgers I've ever tasted in my WHOLE damn life. They are so juicy and flavorful. First of all, I'm vegan adjacent so this was s cheat night. Secondly, I live in the city. I mean WAY uptown. Why am I across state lines, on a work night, whilst the sandman has already blanketed the city with sleeping dust? No one could tell you that, but what I do know. I'm definitely coming back here. Drinks are good, service is good, karaoke host/dj on Wednesday night rocks the house. Jersey City staple.
2019-10-20,1,If I can give a lower rating I would . First , they got some knock off soda so it tasted really nasty so I had asked the waitress which is also the bartender  to get me water she totally forgets and gave some other people water as soon as they walked in . Second ,When I said excuse me she gave a really nasty attitude. If she's frustrated and can't handle the bar and the outside of the bar that's non of my fault and super unprofessional for her to snap at a paying customer. Please hire better people or more people to help out . Last , she has the nerve to come out of the bar and say something I would've gave her a good tip if she was attentive and not so rude because I am paying for her service as well  aI didn't like It therefore I'm not giving her money for something she didn't provide .
2019-09-29,3,Generally happy with their food. Pizza not so much. Grilled chicken is a good choice.
2019-09-26,5,Rachel the bar tender was awesome! My friends and I, 7 of us, stayed in an Air bnb across the street from the bar! I must say, it was the most fun neighborhood bar with very friendly people! I met new friends! One of those "where everybody knows your name" bars!
2019-08-28,5,Yes it is a pub and yes it has a bar but my god is this place fantastic !! The service here is awesome. The burger here is the best burger in New Jersey. I read other reviews and thought there is no way this place has the best burger so my wife and I decided to go and check it out ourselves. To say that those reviews were correct is an understatement. By far the burgers here are as good as a burger from a fine 5 star restaurant. And if you like beer, their selection is great and the waiters know what to recommend. I loved it and so will you....
2019-07-10,5,Nice little bar/restaurant in Jersey. My husband and I went there for a late night dinner and to my plesant surprise, it was karaoke night! I love karaoke, lots of great singers! Friendly staff, karaoke guy and patrons.
2019-05-29,5,I love this place! Great staff and the food is sooooo good! I am quite obsessed with their grilled chicken sandwich.  So much so, that I've made it my personal mission to find a better one in the area and none compare!
2019-02-17,5,Corkscrew is another great place up in the jersey city heights. It a pretty good sports bar (although one time they didn't play the giants game on the main bar screens because a customer had first dibs with a dolphins game? Weird, but I forgive them.The wings are great there, as well are the burgers. My favorite burger is the brunch burger, with Taylor Ham, cause we're in north jersey and not the savages of south jersey calling it p*rk r*ll. The burgers are cooked perfectly right on a grill in front of you and they use pat lafrieda meat, which is simply the best.
2019-02-15,4,I dig what has evolved here after Yusef left...Not that I didn't like Yusef, just that Nicole has brought a cooler vibe to the establishment, can't figure out why, but it's just a feeling of you never know what's going to happen, & later on, it gets packed!...Wes & Rachel are excellent bartenders, & Shorty is an awesome DJ...No shit, I was there one evening & hung for like 6 hours...and there were people who were there before me & hung longer...testament to the chillness of the place...Now if they can only get those nice big rocks for my whiskey glass...
2019-02-10,1,It was okay but I was absolutely turned off by the smell of bacon in the air. Now my pea coat smells of swine. Mind you I'm a swine lover.
2019-01-21,4,Lively local place, family run i belive. Good for  a fun hangout its a small place though . Got a burger and waffle fries they taste good. The food is made besides the bar and you can see it being prepared. The staff is  good. Price is reasonable. I would come back here if i am in this area.
2018-11-25,5,Love the bartenders! Super friendly. Great brunch menu. Love manmosa and bloody Mary's
2018-10-04,3,Definelty a divey type of joint. I liked that we have a small yet decent bar right in the heart of the heights neighborhood. The food is good. We really like the waffle fries. Chicken tacos are good too. It is a small menu as it is a small place, the kitchen is right in front of you at the bar area. I don't mind that actually, I like watching the cook prepare my food, that I can make sure there isn't any funny business happening with my food. My only complaint is that the have the DJ play music SO DANG LOUD. And no I'm not old, I enjoy listening to music and all that but for real, for such a small space they have the music blaring! So if you'd like to leave a place with a headache this place is for you lol. Over all though, decent joint to have a few beers and a late night snack!
2018-10-04,3,Visited Corkscrew in the Jersey City Heights neighborhood after hearing about their "Manmosa," which friends mentioned was worth a try. I visited with a friend on a Wednesday evening, there was a decent amount of folks in the small neighborhood bar, but it soon became more packed later in the evening as the baseball playoffs were starting. There was also plenty of parking around the neighborhood, so that was very convenient as well. As friends recommended, I tried the Manmosa (Blue Moon, Vodka, Splash of Orange Juice, Topped with a Float of Champagne) ($10). It took a bit of getting used to and it did taste a bit unique at first taste, but it was tasty after you do. We also ordered a side of Cajun Waffle Fries (Crispy Cajun Waffle Fries with Cajun Mayo) ($6), which was very tasty as well. Generally, it was a fun time. Very much a neighborhood bar with good food and reasonably priced drinks. I would certainly come back in the future for a laid-back time catching up with friends.
2018-07-25,5,I learned about this place because it's my cousin's favorite spot, especially for burgers. I have to agree with him on that because their burgers are really good. Great atmosphere with great people. If you want to watch any games and have a few drinks in a chill location this is the place to go.
2018-05-12,5,The brunch on Saturdays and Sundays is FIRE. Pretty happy about it. And, super nice people. I'm from Texas so nice is definitely a requirement. If you want a cool hang, great food, and great drinks, this is the place!
2018-05-07,5,Local Bar of Jersey City Heights, with great food, solid drinks, and friendly service. I have been meaning to review this place for both the brunch menu and the late night snack options.Love the buffalo french fries with mozz cheese on top and ranch dipping sauce on the side. This dish in its simplicity is fantastic because every ingredient is prepared perfectly and the combination is just delightful. The crunchy french fries topped with melted mozz cheese dipped with some ranch sauce is just so great.Wings here, the dry rubs are so friggin good and these aren't the baby tiny wings, these wings are like thick, meaty and super filing, I could honestly eat about 20 wings by myself but these wings are so big, I could only finish 6. Hamburgers, juicy and amazing. The burger is so thick and piled high with ingredients and really delicious. Honestly, don't think you could go wrong with any of the items on the menu, have never found something yet at least.The drinks, the bartenders are super friendly and if you talk to them like humans, they will pour with a heavy hand. Especially some nights its like dead so you can just be chill and hang out there - won't regret it a great time!
2018-04-21,5,Live this place and the local vibe. A Live music brunch in Saturday's from 1-4pm hosted by Nick Ciavatta is an outstanding fun event, and open mic night on Tuesday's from 9-12am can range from rock, to rap, to poetry to singer songwriter to outstanding musicians is a must attend. The hamburger is to die fir!
2018-04-21,5,OH MY GOD THAT WAS SO GOOD.  Drinks, juicy high quality burgers, friendly staff.  I can't wait to go back
2018-03-30,5,Everytime I come home from Hawaii this is the only I go to for food drinks and quality people
2018-03-21,5,We ate here on our honeymoon. I had a chicken ceased salad which was wonderful. My husband had the grilled chicken soft taco but it came out barbecue chicken and he didn't like it. Not that it was bad food, it just wasn't a liking to his taste buds. We had water which was good, didn't taste like tap water at all. There was live music for open mic night which was awesome. The place was packed but not rowdy and we didn't have trouble finding a table.
2018-03-02,4,Believe it or not this lil place actually has a good dj....moscow mule is the new drink to have but i still prefer a blue moon or guiness...alot of ppl i know actually hangs out here lol i showed up one night it was like a lil reunion...saturdays is the best night
2018-02-18,3,Place actually isn't bad I mean if I could give a 3 and a half stars I would, but they kind of messed up on my order and the grilled chicken sandwich I ordered was pretty small. Service wasn't bad either but I requested the Cajun mayo and they forgot(I'm sure he forgot) to add it on my sandwich and never came back to check on us so I couldn't ask for it if I tried. We sat on the table instead of on the bar as the bar was pretty crowded and we wanted to stay away from the crowd. The buffalo chicken wings were actually really good and the burger my friend had also looked delicious as he said it was but my chicken sandwich lacked size and flavor. I will give them another try since the food wasn't bad and hopefully the server that took care of us checks on us the next time, and hopefully I can change my review.
2018-01-25,5,I spent half of my NYE here. It was a lot of fun, for the most part. I haven't had the food yet but the drinks were a solid price and made well. It gets very loud here due to the music and influx of people but I've grown to accept that and don't mind. I think I'll partake in one of their trivia nights soon. It looks like a lot of fun.
2017-12-08,4,Great neighborhood bar with brunch on the weekend, bar food and burgers at other times and games on the TVs. It gets a bit loud during games, as you could imagine. Staff is friendly and quick. Their "kitchen" is literally the little griddle behind the bar. Bathroom is kind of set up awkwardly. I come here for brunch because their Bloody Marys are the best in JC, hands down. There are three different spice levels, I like mine spicy and find the medium heat one just perfect. I turned a little red sipping down the extra spicy one. Brunch menu is limited to a few breakfast items and wings. Wasn't really into their Benedicts but the egg tacos and wings were good. I am told this place is very different from how it was years ago.
2017-11-18,4,Local neighborhood bar with great staff and a nice selection of drinks.  It attracts a lot of young professionals and locals and has a very relaxed, friendly vibe about it.  My only complaint is that when they have a DJ in there it's too loud to have a good conversation...and too small to really dance...I'd say scrap the DJ nights and focus on being a relaxed local bar!
2017-11-08,5,Small kitchen but well thought out menu. I really like this place. If you're new to the heights it's a good place to get to know your neighbors.
2017-10-29,4,Casual, solid sports bar with friendly staff. Great choices for beer and all the tv screens for my husband. There were only 3 people working on the Thursday night we were there, but still the service was good. My veggie burger and fries were good. Husband didn't care for their wings since they were breaded, but that's just a matter of how he likes his wings. Seating is self-served which I always like. We'll be back.
2017-10-21,5,Nice corner neighbor spot. Amazing food, great service and good music. Everything I had here has been awesome from the eggs benedict to the chicken and waffles and their specials are killer too! Good drinks, and if you're a Bloody Mary person they make awesome.
2017-10-16,5,I'm a Bloody Mary snob. I was hesitant to try theirs but then I saw it as a special on the drink menu.  Three different levels of spicy? Oh I just had to try.  Omg, addicted!! What is their secret? Absolutely superb. Fabulous vibe and creative, delicious food menu too!
2017-10-04,1,I thought this was a residential area? Anyone want to start a petition to close them down? Unless they keep the noise inside..
2017-09-14,5,Fantastic service. Ridiculously good food, especially the burgers, fried chicken sandwiches and waffle fries. My go to bar in the heights.
2017-09-14,3,Loud! I would not recommend going here on a Saturday if you are planning on having a conversation/ catching up w friends. You won't be able to hear much haha! The bartender working there was nice.
2017-08-26,5,This burger is insanely delicious. Overall, super chill neighborhood joint with dive prices and a surprisingly good margarita. Sometimes, I just stop by for sweet potato fries. They say there is live jazz on certain Sundays, but I've never happened by at the right time. Karaoke on Wednesday is great time!
2017-08-22,5,Really solid neighborhood joint. When I lived up in the Heights, I used to come here late at night for a bite. Always friendly people around and waitstaff. Curly fries and a burger are the way to go and they have well-priced brunch. :) The patrons are for the most part longtime Heights residents.
2017-08-18,4,I had the brunch burger, advertised as Pat LaFrieda (I'm a fan). She had the eggs Benedict. The burger came with a fried egg underneath. It was cooked to the proper doneness I'd ordered. While it was missing the cheddar cheese from the menu description, it was a good burger nevertheless, so I didn't mind (I did end up mentioning this to the waiter). It came with a perfectly fried order of waffle fries.The eggs Benedict were well received with a tasty albeit pretty thin hollandaise sauce. The accompanying home fries were spot on.Service was friendly and fine, with even the cook checking in with diners.The ambiance is a sports bar with several tables, most of which are the higher tables you find in a bar area of a larger restaurant. I liked the electronic music playing, but didn't open the Shazam app.There is a bit of a disconnect between the menu and what shows up on the bill. For example, the bill showed a burger charge plus a charge for the missing cheese, while the description on the menu said it included cheese. Since the waiter took the missing cheese charge off the bill, it didn't matter to me. You may want to keep an eye out.We'll likely be back.
2017-07-16,1,Horrible service. The manager Yusef is a RACIST. My friend got kicked out and was told by the manager that he had to leave because he another customer wanted to fight him.. what the manager didn't know is that they were actually friends and it's known he made it all up. What each race was is irrelevant, but my friend was the only one of his kind there that night and he was shunned. Never did anything wrong. Disgusting. Don't spend your money here. This behavior should NEVER be supported.
2017-07-11,5,I've been here twice & plan on coming back over & over again! Great food for Brunch, lunch or dinner! Great burgers!! Well made drinks & ice cold beer. Nice ambiance & interesting clientele. Very cool bar & neighborhood. Love it!
2017-07-04,2,Sweet potato fries were burnt, "Cajun Dry Rub," actually means plain breaded and fried wings, BBQ wings were also super breaded and fried with a drizzle of sauce, not tossed. Service was very nice, although a bit slow.
2017-06-14,4,one of those truly neighborhood places to hang out. Good bar, good drinks, good tv screens all over to watch whatever sports are on. BUT what they have which many neighborhood bars don't is AWESOME food. I didn't think the food would be ok. But it is. And its not your average flavor, average quality, average spiced food. They get crafty with their burgers, and pizza, and fries, and drink & food specials. And that just makes you want to come back often. Staff is very friendly and welcoming. Such a variety of folks who come through there to drink and eat. Check em out, you wont be disappointed.
2017-05-02,4,Good spot to have a few drinks and a bite to eat. Staff is friendly and they have some game nights
2017-04-30,3,Rolled in about 12 on a Sunday for brunch... with "no way to heat up water" coffee and tea were immediately ruled out. The portion size left much to be desired, especially in the spud department. On top of that our order was botched and oh yea they didn't have coffee! Bullspit
2017-02-21,5,I was here for a Devils viewing party. The burgers were awesome and the beer was nice and cold. I had a great time.
2017-02-16,5,Stopped in on a Monday night to explore with my boyfriend ! Awesome little place foods looks great can't wait to try it out .  Jay took great care of us ! Played Jenga all night so much fun deff coming again !
2017-02-16,5,A great neighborhood bar. The staff is always super friendly. The menu isn't extensive, but what they do have is absolutely delicious and affordable. We stop in at least twice a month for a burger or the brunch chicken and waffles.
2017-02-12,5,best burger & beer in jersey city hands down (including downtown spots). A must try especially for my fellow Heights neighbors!
2017-01-05,5,Love these guys! Always warm and inviting staff, great beer selection and fun regulars. Thanks for the great vibe Euceph.
2016-12-03,5,I was very skeptical because of the neighborhood and the outside but once I went it, it was pretty cool. Music was nice and it was not full. Cook and bartender were really nice and friendly. Good prices, would come back.
2016-11-29,5,Love this place. The wings and burgers are way better than most pubs. Bar staff great. This place isn't trying to be Fox and Crow down the street - isn't trying to appeal to Brooklyn hipster crowd ... thankfully. Cork Screw just a solid neighborhood bar with no attitude
2016-10-30,4,Nice surprise! Stopped in on a rare trip through the Heights and were very pleased. Very friendly welcoming staff. Had wings, a burger, sweet potato fries, and chicken and waffles. Everything was perfect, the burger was cooked to order, sweet potato fries were crispy and served with a delicious garlic aioli sauce. We will be back!
2016-10-09,4,First time at a bar in the Heights. Great chicken and waffles and tacos. Great atmosphere. Knocking off one star because the bartender just let obnoxious people vape illegally in the bar and didn't care when I brought it to his attention.
2016-10-05,1,Place regardless of the much do renovation SUCKS at best! Hard to believe the owner renovated to "try" to make this place better under the management of Euceph must be related or blowing him! No change has occurred same crack ass ghetto folk with more expensive drinks and food. There was a time before Euceph and the renovations, this place was classic and had a great neighborhood vibe now its just filled with thinking its the TGIF of Jersey City Heights! New management is a definite need for this place to survive! To the owner you are sitting on a pot of gold but yet what is being create is tin!
2016-08-05,1,Ugh.What a bummer. I was really hoping I would like this place - unfortunately, my very quick experience has put me off for good.I rarely go out in my own hood, but my friend was willing to travel and we chose the Corkscrew. it was very busy when I walked in, There happened to be two seats at the bar, so I asked the bartender if they were free and he said yes. Great. I studied the menu for a few minutes - it looked really interesting actually, and I was planning what I wanted, but realized I hadnt ordered a drink, so I looked up and tried to catch the bartenders eye.Well, I sat there 15 minutes being absolutely 100% ignored.He knew I was there totally because I spoke to him and he watched me sit down.As soon as my friend arrived we bolted. I was actually really pleased I got ignored, for we went over to the Fox and Crow and had a delicious, and very serene experience.FAR more civilized.Even if I hadnt have been ignored, we would have left after the first drink because the vibe in there was HORRIBLE.I cant for the life of me figure out what the Corkscrew is trying to be or who it wants to cater to.The menu sounded really good and a step up from standard bar fare, the decor is sports bar, the crowd was mixed the music was rap the vibe was club.It was A W F U L.Quite obviously if you are over 40, you are unwelcome.If you have any sense of sophistication, save your money and walk over to Fox and Crow to spend your money.
2016-07-28,5,I love this place. Best bar in the heights. Food is great. Beers are cold ;) and the staff is friendly and awesome. Special shout out to Wes and Eucef for always making me feel welcome. As an added bonus they have trivia night on Thursdays.
2016-06-26,4,Weekend brunch review. Well this was a very pleasant surprise. Brunch is a favorite for me and the Mrs. The Corkscrew has a pretty nice sized menu with about nine to ten items for brunch.  It was hard to choose.  I finally decided on the brunch burger which had a Jersey sandwich staple, Taylor ham, egg and American cheese.  It is served on toasted bun and topped with a sriracha aioli and accompanied by sweet potato fries.  There is just something about a burger cooked on a grill that makes your mouth water.   This burger does that and more.  They are known for their burgers and I can see why, they are outstanding. The wife had the brunch Cubano, a traditional Cuban sandwich topped with a runny egg on an English muffin. It also comes with fried plantains. She really enjoyed it saying the egg with the salty pork and pickles were delicious. Believe it or not there was a three piece Jazz band that started playing shortly before we left. Which of course caused me to order a pint to prolong the stay. I had the Illusive Traveler Grapefruit Shandy. It was very refreshing with just a hint of the grapefruit.  I would definitely come back. Though they probably should think about hiring a waitress during the weekends as they were packed and seemed to me that 3 people just aren't enough.
2016-06-17,1,Disgusting food, burgers charged at $10 each without any accompaniments, one was burnt and the other being extremely under cooked. Has an amateur chef but wanting to charge Michelin prices. Get real this is still the heights not Williamsburg or lower east. DO NOT BUY FOOD FROM THIS SHITHOLE, managers don't even respond to complaints and they didn't seem to care. Spend your money somewhere else than this filthy bar. Also after ingesting few bites a friend and I were extremely sick afterwards. Hopefully someone with any knowledge of running a successful bar will eventually take over this place because it's run by idiots who haven't any clue as to what catering and service industry entails.
2016-06-10,5,Awesome place!!!!! Daniel " the bartender" is Amazing!!! right on board with your drinks and food!!!!! totally worth going for a fun time with great people!!!!!!!!!!!
2016-06-03,5,Daniel the bartender was the man. He had the whole bar and tables handled. as soon as our drinks were empty they were full. very attentive.
2016-06-01,4,I came for trivia night last Thursday and was pleasantly surprised. The trivia was difficult but super fun and interesting. The trivia host was engaging and the wait staff / bartenders were very attentive and entertaining. Even the music was solid!I didn't order any food but sat right by the kitchen and everything that came out looked delicious, especially the sriracha honey wings that were on special. I hope they're on the menu when I come back. I might make this a regular spot, especially on trivia nights.
2016-04-29,5,I have to say that I was highly impressed by this place in JC.  The environment is just amazing for a Saturday night, the place is always full of life as I had to go back again cause I got hooked.  The live DJ is amazing.  The costumer service is great, the waiter remembered us the second time we were there.  But the food!  The food is amazing, so fresh and delic, I would encourage anyone to visit this place.
2016-04-05,5,This place got a major overhaul a bit ago. The owner, taking a hint from the slow gentrification process in the Heights, gave this bar a beautiful facelift. This place is TOTALLY different than what my partner and I witnessed when we gave it a try about 2 years ago. Being slightly turned off by the ratchet-ish ambiance, I vowed not to return. BUT this place has totally changed since then and it certainly still has that neighborhood feel with a more refined ambiance, adorned with new wood floors and tables, and flat screen tvs, but most importantly: an actually appetizing menu. Yes, there's the classic bar food but they take it a step further serving bar food that's worth trying and isn't only fried crap. They even have a brunch menu! I truly enjoyed my calm, chill brunch experience recently on a Sunday. My beau and I, refusing to wait for brunch at a downtown JC spot, decided to try the chicken & waffle dish offered here. We were so surprised at how good the food was! The waffle was fluffy & soft, what you expect from a great waffle, and the chicken (boneless strips & I ordered a side of sweet & spicy chicken wings) were cooked/fried to a yummy crispness that satisfied our Sunday brunch cravings. Top that with a $5 mimosa and a $4 Yeungling and we were set. The Big Bang Theory on tv was also a plus! This is a great neighborhood spot!
2016-03-28,4,Solid local spot with TVs for sports and a rotating selection of drinks on tap. The food is good and the cook staff are always coming up with fun new food ideas. I recommend getting the wings, they are killer!
2016-03-16,1,Good evening,I just moved to Jersey City and someone recommended Corkscrew to me.  So I went a couple weeks ago with a buddy.  We had a tremendous experience as Tracy was SO accommodating in a way that didn't seem fake. AT ALL.  Made us feel right at home. It was terrific. So naturally we wanted to go back and we did.  But our 2nd visit was a horror show. Service slower than molasses. Maybe it's because Tracy wasn't there.
2016-02-05,4,My husband and I stopped here tonight for a quick drink and meal and I like it!Sat at bar which was filled with what appeared to be regulars.  Very nice bartender who had a real handle on everything that was going on.   We ordered a dozen wings - half Thai half spicy.  Good wings, well seasoned and served with some sort of creamy dipping sauce, not bluecheese dressing.    We had a second beer ($2 for a Yuengling, so cheap) and asked for an order of sliders.  The sliders come in three with really good crispy skinny fries.  The food was good and the cook seemed very happy to be interacting with the guests.  It's fun to thank the cook directly and see him smile in appreciation.  A woman next to us had a very good looking hamburger that she said was perfect.The only thing that was weird, and absolutely no reflection on the bar, was that some of the regulars at the bar are a bit loud and crude, talking about things best left for a bachelor party.  They seemed intent on making the newbies cringe, or at least that's the impression that I got.  This place has been around for a while, and in fact we'd been there 12 years ago when we lived in the Heights and it was more of a tavern, so maybe the guys were used to a bit more of a boys-club atmosphere and we were the ones in the way....
2016-01-31,3,I'm unsure how Corkscrew Bar has such a high review here. Anyway, good burgers, good fries, and decent beer list.Better service and better decor would help a lot.A good neighborhood pub, but certainly not great. However it's obvious that some effort is put in to having somewhat interesting burgers and specials. Just sort of seems like 50% effort is put in. A fair comparison would be White Star Bar, which is a much better example of a great neighborhood pub. That being said, I'll keep coming back for the Apple Bottom burger and a stout!
2016-01-06,5,I am a sucker for a good neighborhood bar!! And this one stole my heart!! My boyfriend lives around the corner and we often find ourselves here when we want a drink, a great dinner , or even just want to get out of the house! I seriously enjoy the service, the waiters and bartenders are so friendly, helpful, and great to chat with! The atmosphere and people are never too rowdy and always comforting. We stopped in on a fall night to grab a bite and some drinks before meeting friends downtown. The apple bottom burger was so on point and I like to say "tasted like fall". The drinks are priced great, I love cider which usually runs around 6-7$ and they have lots of beer on tap.
2015-12-20,5,Went on a Sunday for brunch. Love their brunch on Sundays! My boyfriend and I went here for the first time to have some brunch on a Sunday when the Ravens were losing terribly ( Ravens fan this 2015 season sucks for us) anyway . We had the chicken and Waffles and Argentinean Hot dogs. Okay .... BEST. HOTDOG. EVER! Lol they were banging. We also had the buffalo fries. It was delist! The mimosas complemented our meals nicely. Overall great place  try it here it's worth it. Great prices.
2015-10-04,4,You'd be surprised the brunch is pretty good here. Its a couple of blocks down from my house and I come here sometimes at night with my neighbors. Its a fun atmosphere and drinks are well priced. I have to admit I've been hammered here and have had good memories. I just dislike that they took out the pool table.
2015-09-24,4,Yay neighborhood bar! I swear I had already reviewed this place but it seems like that review is gone so here we go again. I've been to corkscrew before and after the renovations and must say kudos for the update!! Adding windows to the location is a big PLUS along with getting the pool table out.  Sorry, not sorry.  They have definitely update on so many level and kept the same feel as to a great neighborhood bar. Their food has stayed yummy and perhaps better than before. Their burgers are so delicious, the fries and the perfect amount of crispiness. They have Sunday Brunch that has live music as well.  Trivia on Thursday nights and I think Ladies night on Saturday.  TVs to watch games, high top tables, they even have a jukebox machine where you can play music. Definitely a great bar in the heights.
2015-09-22,4,Went here one night for drinks and have been going ever since. Thursday is trivia night, food is great and my go to drink when it's available is the "victory golden monkey". Three of those and your good for the rest of the night.
2015-09-15,4,Two words "Kevin Bacon!" You won't be disappointed! This place is a nice neighborhood bar, nothing pretentious just good food and drinks.
2015-08-30,5,I think the Corkscrew Bar & Grill is my favorite gastropub in Jersey City! Tara makes great drinks and Kevin is a mad scientist with the food! Delicious food concoctions!The Chicken & waffles during brunch is really good! The salmon and Sautéed spinach Benedict was really delicious, their BBQ Wings were crunchy and juicy; but the winner was their Screw Burger....FRICKN SLAMMIN'! Now it's important to note that I still have an affection for the burgers from Left Bank, The Kitchen & GrovevStreet, Dullboy, Park & Sixth (lamb Burger), Light Horse Tavern, Krugs Tavern (Newark NJ), and Park Tavern, but I gotta be honest the Screw Burger is "Winninggggggg"!
2015-08-28,5,The corkscrew has a special place in my heart.   I started going after work to catch a drink about 5 years ago.  It is not the usual place to "fall" in love but, I did!  Anyway back to the bar...It has changed so much in the last 5 years!  It was always a great place to hang with some friends and drink, no frill, just fun.  With the renovation and the strengthening of the management the Cork,  it is really developing into something more than a bar.  Euceph is the bar manager that keeps the place contemporary with its changing neighborhood and clientele The food that Kevin is making at the grill and the quality of meals is something that surprises me every time I go.   They have specials that change often and go quickly which speaks to how tasty.  They are big part of the community and host different events that support the community.  Jazz brunch is fun!
2015-08-23,2,Wings are from a frozen bag. They are the ones that are 50% breading and 40 bone and 10% chicken meat. What goes on with all these reviews about great wings? Ugh. I went by other reviews and was stuck with 24 deep fried disappointments. Place is nice inside and drinks look good as well as other food menu items so perhaps there is hope yet. Wings though, don't be a turkey and get them.
2015-07-30,4,Great selection of alcohol and great food. There is a lot of local vibe here and looked like everyone knew each other. First timers might feel a little out of the place. Flatbreads and wings are a must try.
2015-07-25,5,My husband and I have gone here a few times for brunch and it is amazing. Even though the menu is small, the food is fantastic. You would never think to hit a bar up for brunch, but this is the place to go!! Very unique menu!
2015-07-12,4,One of the local bars in Jersey City Heights. Walked over to check it out. It wasn't packed when we walked in on a Saturday night. We sat at the bar. I found out that it Saturdays are Ladies Nights so all martinis were $5. I asked the bartender to make me a sweet martini and he made me a white gummy bear martini which was pretty delicious. They also have a pretty decent beer selection. The kitchen is behind the bar area in the back corner. They have a pretty simple food menu considering they don't have a real kitchen. I was pretty amazed by what they can make. We had 2 drinks and left. The place was pretty crowded by the time we were leaving. All the seats at the bar were taken. They also have Trivia Thursdays and brunch on weekends until 4pm. I will definitely be back to check that out.
2015-07-02,5,On a Friday or Saturday night in the Heights, this is the place to be.  Nothing fancy, nothing "hip" or pretentious.  Just a solid bar with solid food and solid drinks.  The food is all very good, and their brunch is dangerous. I can't go here for brunch and expect to do anything productive, because I'm going to stuff my face with chicken and waffles and down 3 manmosas before I leave, no matter what my initial plan going in was.The staff is friendly, and there's definitely a close, communal feel to the place with a steady crowd of regulars every weekend.
2015-06-28,4,First impression.. Yay!!!!I'm from Irvington where I have not visited any bars and I will not say Y.. I visited the Bar/Grill with a friend who frequent the place. The bar manager (cute) staff( day and evening) where beyond the epitome of friendly and service . The atmosphere is warm, inviting and place bigger than I thought from the outside view. I can speak on both the morning staff/food and the evening staff/food. The woman ROCK even my waitress, cook and bartenders. I got a chance meet the handsome guy who put the menu together and I say damn good menu: Keep up the good work. My bartender RJ ( HOTTIE) is the BOMB: if you don't know what to drink then he s the man to make one up for U.
2015-06-05,4,What a pleasant surprise this place is. I must say for that area this spot was way last on my list for places to go eat and drink just because I remember what it used to be before their renovation. But it's a cute spot! Small and intimate with speedy service. The locals there are all super friendly and the food is actually pretty amazing! The chicken and waffles takes the cake for me but their burgers are delicious as well. Plus they have trivia nights - I now know how I will be spending my Tuesday evenings... For those who haven't been definitely check this place out! It wont disappoint.
2015-05-31,5,Utterly amazing bar food!! Perfect for late night cravings like buffalo wings, cajun fries or a delicious screw burger. Add a couple of blue moons and you are in business. My wife and I drove by this place repeatedly on our way back home and always wondered if the food was any good. Boy we got more than impressed by it. We are from union city so it's perfect if you live close by the heights. Parking is tricky but you can usually find a spot on webster. Back to the food they got so many combinations for their burgers and fries that you can definitely find something to suit your needs. They got specials every night and live music during the week. The service is also on top of its game. The staff is friendly and efficient.I would highly recommend stopping by this joint. Planning to come back soon. Can't get enough of those wings and fries combination.
2015-05-28,5,As always, the beer selection is great (and changes regularly), the brunch is awesome, and everyone is so welcoming. Best place is the neighborhood.
2015-05-18,5,Great atmosphere, great choice of local beer on tap, delicious bar food -- Mac and cheese is a must try!!! I am really impressed by this bar, will for sure come back anytime soon.
2015-05-17,3,We came to Corkscrew for brunch with a friend. For prime brunch time on a Sunday, it wasn't too packed and was a nice and cool place to hang out before going over to the farmers market. Brunch menu was fairly limited. They had two specials - an eggs Benedict florentine with salmon and a chicken fried steak dish. Feeling underwhelmed by the rest of the fairly small brunch menu, I ordered the chicken fried steak. I almost immediately regretted this after seeing the chicken and waffles come out.Everything looks like it's homemade despite their tiny kitchen - I watched the food being made and nothing came from a freezer bag. Pretty impressive. The chicken fried steak itself was pretty good, but the gravy didn't really taste like much and the accompanying biscuit was a little too heavy. My two brunch companions had cocktails which were quite large and inexpensive. One reported that the eggs Benedict was "standard" and the other said that the salad he had was good, but could have used more quinoa. Note that there are very limited vegetarian options. Also, they didn't offer the yelp check in deal, so keep that in mind if you think you'll get 25% off. This seems like a good place for drinks and bar food, but I'd probably skip the brunch next time.
2015-05-16,4,Honestly wouldn't have thought this place was going to be as nice as it was. When stepping inside you forget where you are and could easily think you were in some trendy Brooklyn bar. The food was also a surprise the chicken sandwich and the classic burger were both nicely displayed and tasted delicious. Would have given this place 5 stars but I felt the food took just slightly longer than it should have.
2015-05-12,4,I live a few blocks away and I've only been here a few times with my gf but each time was great. Perfect local bar with great food. Pretty good draft beer selection and I think the Old Fashioned I ordered was better than most I've gotten at some cocktail bars in downtown!  Worth a visit if you're in the area.
2015-05-09,5,The new food menu is slammin ! Heart attack hot dogs may be the best dog ive ever had... buffalo chicken pizzas and the quesadillas  never disappoint. The real gem is the WINGS sweet & spicy BEST WINGS IN THE JC AREA HANDS DOWN. The people are chill locals/regulars and always  new faces every night. Staff is always awesome. Definitely  best bar in the heights if not all of JC.
2015-05-07,5,My only lament is that I live so far away, otherwise I would be a regular in this cozy bar!I was visiting my friends in JC and we were in need of some brunch/lunch options. My friend suggested his new favorite place, the remodeled Corkscrew, advice which I'm glad I took. The remodeled interior was very welcoming, with dark wood and a semi-rustic feel. The large windows made for great lighting and people watching as we enjoyed our food and drinks. The music was perfect, the playlist was on point for the 25-35 year old crowd. There wasn't a bad song played, all familiar favorites. I do love me some 90's R&B.The tap list, while not overly extensive, was very impressive. Its a rotating selection with excellent offerings from Ommegang, Brooklyn, Dogfish Head, and other reputable craft breweries. As a beer drinker, I was very excited by the offerings and sad I could not try everything as I had to drive into NYC directly after the meal. I was able to try a tasty saison, and I will definitely be back to try more. There was also a nice selection of specialty mixed drinks and daily cocktail specials. This is the kind of place where drinkers of all varieties will find something to satisfy their palate. The food selection is limited because there really isn't a full kitchen space. All the food looks to be prepared in a small griddle area behind the bar. Given these limitations, the menu is still impressive. I got the Screw Burger, while my friends had eggs benedict and the chicken and waffles. The burger and eggs benedict were good, but not great, pretty standard fare. I liked the thin cut fries that accompanied the burger, crispy and fresh. The real standout was the chicken and waffles. The tenderloins that topped the fresh, fluffy Belgian waffle were so moist and well seasoned, they easily make my top 5 list of chicken and waffles I've ever had. However they're preparing those chicken tenders, I'm convinced there some wizardry happening. The dinner specials looked really good, but sadly were not available during lunch. This is a true neighborhood bar, one that makes you feel at home the moment you walk through the door. The friendly, attentive staff, chill music and ambience, and delicious food make me wish they'd open up shop next to me in Morristown. Until then, I'll gladly make the trek up the JC.
2015-05-06,5,I'm from jersey city and I work in the industry in Hoboken. I've been to the corkscrew 5 times in the last month after my shift. And I really fell in love with it. It's an amazing vibe and atmosphere. Great people and drinks. Service is perfect and management has this place running on wheels!! It's my go to bar from now on.
2015-05-06,5,Corkscrew is a model of consistency. I've been here several times and the service, food and drink selection are always outstanding. They've really rebranded themselves to into more then just a local watering hole and are quickly becoming a go-to spot in the JC Heights. There are three scenarios that I usually find myself in here:BRUNCH. The new spring '15 brunch food/drink menu is phenomenal. I came in last week and we all ordered the chicken and waffles **droool** - two fried chicken tenders atop a soft and pillowy belgian waffle drenched in powdered sugar and maple syrup. Need I say more? I'm not into bloodies but my friends agreed that these were some of the best. Din Din. This is a good place to come in and unwind after work, especially if you are into unwinding with a beer in one hand and a burger in the other. Depending on the night there are various drink specials and trivia. The BF and I are partial to the burger with a Three Philosophers demi glace. Not even Socrates, Plato and Aristotle could resist this. Add in some smoked Gouda and perfectly caramelized onions and we've got a real serious mouth party on our hands. Cooked to perfection, this left little to be desired except for more. The beer infused demi glace was the perfect accent. They change their dinner specials up pretty often. Late Night. My friends live up the street and we come in for a nightcap from time to time, every saturday, same difference. I never drunk eat ... but if I were going to then the classic bar menu choices like mozz sticks and chicken fingers would be my choice. If I were going to. Jeez Corkscrew, I wish that you weren't so damn good because JC has way too many other spots to try. Your worth the trek over from Grove Street any day of the week.
2015-05-06,3,People are friendly. Good fat burgers. Wish there was a pool table or something of that sort.
2015-04-16,5,Went to Corkscrew. Pretty cool place. They did a great job renovating the place and it looks great. The food was pretty good and the crowd was pretty chill. They have a great election of beers and some nice choices on the menu for food. Definitely going back. Someone who worked there that didn't wait on me said to have a good day. I appreciated that. You usually don't get that personal touch. Keep up the great work!
2015-04-15,5,I came here for the first time after the refurb with the fab Nile H. and after an hour she said "This needs to be your neighborhood bar".  Indeed, I went back a few times after and always enjoyed good drinks, good food, and great company. I've moved out of the neighborhood (*sob*) but the Corkscrew will always be my short list of places to hang out in JC.
2015-04-06,4,Corkscrew Bar is a great addition to the Riverview Arts District of Jersey City Heights. The owner is very attentive to the customers which he tries his best to really get to know you even when the place is crowded. The Hamburgers are probably the best burgers that I have had in a long time. Eclectic list of beers on tap...something for everyone. One suggestion that I would make is to turn the tunes down just a bit on Sunday afternoons when the games are on TV. Other than that, you will see me there again.
2015-04-04,4,Went here cause I was craving a burger and from reading the reviews I thought I would try. My craving was quenched. Got the southwest burger and my boyfriend got the Lucy screw burger and they were both banging. People were really nice. The beer selection was decent. Really nice environment I'll definitely be going back
2015-03-31,5,I've been living in the heights for almost 10 years and always travel downtown for grub and drinks.  A friend of mine suggested we go to Thursday trivia night.  It was fantastic!  We arrived early to ensure seats at the bar.  The "Garbage Tater Tots" were fantastic to go along with our 3 shared beer flights.  The Trivia Master was quick witted and had a varied mix of questions.  I won a Jameson shirt!!! The crowd was a chill but damn serious about their trivia!  The bar gave away cash prizes to the top teams.  It was a great time and I plan to go back for some more!
2015-03-28,4,Really chilled out place ! Good food and good beer. Love coming here with my husbandThey have good wingsThey have really friendly bartenders on the weekends RJ AND Yusuf. And Casey too.
2015-03-26,4,Lovely little corner bar in a weird part of jersey city. Its small, but intimate and has a great selection of craft beer on tap. I was so surprised and if youre not sure what something tastes like, dont be scared to ask for a sample. Their food menu is small too, but they do make aloit of their dishes---very few things are frozen.They even have a DJ in the corner, however his lights are a big exhausting. The staff and owners are awesome and so friendly. And they do ladies night, $5 martiinis on a saturday after 8!They need to tfix those bathrooms tho, theyre messy and smell so bad.
2015-03-06,4,Great neighborhood spot! Tara, the bartender, was friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu and all of the beers on tap.My boyfriend and I both ordered burgers off of their small but interesting menu. Burgers were juicy with a great char, a bit under-seasoned though. The waffle fries are AWESOME. Prices are great! Our entire meal with drinks was about $30. The music was on point switching seamlessly from dance music to old school hip hop, however sitting at a table by the speakers my boyfriend and I found ourselves practically yelling at each other to be able to have a conversation. Overall, great experience. I'm excited to come back on the weekend to try brunch!
2015-03-01,4,I was pretty happy with my experience at Corkscrew Bar. Some further thoughts-The good:-the kitchen is open until 2 hours before the bar closes everyday... so on weekends, it is open until 1 am which is way later than most other bars in JC-really friendly service and bartenders who make sure to learn your name-interesting specials (when I was there, they had a quinoa salad, fish tacos, and other stuff)-16 beers on tap plus many bottles in addition to a fairly wide wine selection and a full bar including a few specialty cocktailsCould be better:-I ordered one thing from the menu, the barbecue chicken tenders. They weren't bad by any means but I thought they could have used more flavor and/or more sauce. The sample size is super small though and I look forward to trying more of the menu-I asked what beers they had on tap and was told they have 16 and then asked what I like. While I appreciate the bartender trying to find me something I would like, I would have liked to see a list of their selection. Not sure if they have one (it wasn't part of their drink menu) but with that many beers on tap, they should-The menu isn't small but it also isn't the most interesting- you have pretty much standard finger/bar food like chicken wings, burgers, fries, etc. Their specials and brunch menu show more imagination so it would be nice to see this included in a few of their regular food items as well. Not a huge issue but just a thought-I was told martinis would be $5 because Saturday was "ladies night" but was charged $7 on my bill. I didn't bother to get it corrected because that is still a pretty good price and I wasn't going to complain about $2 but I guess just having consistent pricing would be good.Overall, I enjoyed my time here and although there are a ton of options in Jersey City, I could definitely see myself coming back.
2015-03-01,4,This was the 2nd Sunday we have had the new Brunch menu and it was as good this week as it was last week. We love the chicken and waffles. The waffles are flavorful and the chicken is just the right size to compliment the waffle in addition to being crispy and very tasty. Great job Euceph and Kevin. This is our new favorite place on Sunday's.
2015-02-28,5,When my wife and I moved to JC, we thought this would be our neighborhood bar. We were right!  This place has a solid list of beers and their recent renovation classed the place up considerably. The staff is always friendly as well.Their new brunch menu took us by suprise this weekend. Their kitchen setup is tiny, but they crank out some great stuff! The chicken and waffles with maple bacon butter is outstanding and the croissant french toast is solid. Highly recommended.
2015-02-27,5,I have to give this place 5 stars.  I've becoming to corkscrew for a while now and have to say it is a great local hang out bar.  I work in the area so it's a very convenient location.  The environment is very casual and chill.  There's a jukebox, high top tables, nice bar area, trivia on Thursdays and GREAT food.  I love their wings, but tonight they had a special - fish tacos and they were AMAZING!The staff is great and know how to treat their customers.  If you haven't been there it is definitely a must!
2015-02-25,5,Almost afraid to leave such a rave review in fear of not getting a table next weekend. I'm a huge breakfast/brunch lover and this place is top notch. They've really stepped up their game and I couldn't be happier. The chicken and waffles was hands down the best I've had in NYC/nj area (and I've had many.) The Bloody Mary special is a welcomed treat after a night out and I recommend the medium heat - the hot is habanero and only for the daring. The staff is efficient and beyond friendly. Can't beat the prices and the craft beer selection is pretty darn good, especially compared to other bars in the neighborhood. The overall experience here is fantastic. Highly recommend. Proud to have such a great place in the heights!PS- for all those fry fans like me...they have waffle friessss!
2015-02-25,5,The corkscrew is really leading an amazing charge to up the game in the Heights. No lie,  this may have been one of the best brunches I've had, considering the overall meal ( $9 eggs Benedict, $5 fresh Bloody Mary's, great service, fresh and fantastic food and great bar/ restaurant space with amazing staff). The hollandaise sauce was the best I've ever had and you can get the Bloody Mary's three different ways ( the hottest is really, really hot- be warned). Please support this local spot and the amazing direction in which they are moving.
2015-02-19,5,Great food, amazing drinks, and super lovely staff! The Trivia Thursdays are a lot of fun! You should check out this pace whenever you're in the area! Loved it!
2015-01-24,5,Love this place manager is supper friendly n off course drinks are cheap very work it.. Good music, good drinks, n good  staff
2015-01-16,3,Great bar and food.  The only problem I have is that if the bartender doesn't like what you're playing on the jukebox, they'll override it.  Other than that, I love this place.
2014-12-23,5,This is the new local spot! The atmosphere is chill and friendly,  plus the food and drinks are amazing!!! Order the wings and an old fashion and tell Euceph Andre sent you, trust me the best pairing you will ever have! The staff is very attentive and drinks are reasonably priced.  I've finally found my "cheers bar" and they actually wanted to know my name.
2014-12-10,5,Went on trivia night- everyone was very friendly- had a great time! Trivia was intricate, challenging and fun! The fries are wonderful! Would ask for a veggie/vegan burger or mushroom option though so I don't eat fries all night haha. But they were delicious! The beer selection was great. Prices were typical of Brooklyn for beer. Clean, easy to get to and chill, looking forward to going back!
2014-12-02,5,For being a few doors down I figured I'd give this place a try. I came in for a few beers and left. I came back a few weeks later and felt very welcomed by the owner and he even remembered me by name which was very nice.I was coming in for only a drink or two but with the awesome service I decided to stay and try some food instead of going to hoboken. I'm glad I did. The Lucy burger sounded weird but with bacon, peanut butter with a hamburger cooked perfectly, it was very good. Good drinks, good service and good bar food for an affordable price, will definitely be back.
2014-11-08,4,first time at this place and it was a great time. stopped in with a friend for a couple drinks ended up staying longer then we planned. the beer selection was great, I had a hard time choosing because I couldn't see the taps from where I was sitting, but luckily both the bartender and owner were there to offer some options with samples. the cook accidentally made buffalo cheese fries that ended up with us, yum! I'm excited to go back during my next visit to jersey city, I hear the burgers are amazing!
2014-07-03,4,This is only my second time up in the heights but this place comes as a surprise.  Great draught list and nineties rock, a pool table and six screens.  Bartenser is also knowledgable.  Cant speak to the food but the grill looks inviting.   If you like the downtown jc feel of yesteryear you'll dig this place.
2014-05-22,5,I've been coming to this bar for a while. First the service:GREAT! That's why I've been coming here! All the help does a fantastic job and the owner Yusef (hope I spelled it right) will go far out of his way to make sure you enjoy your experience. The other employees seem to really care that you enjoy yourself and make damn fine drinks. The food is deceptively good for the price. I just ate a 6 dollar chicken sandwich that made me want to go back for more. Wings are great. The XXX isn't that spicy but they're tasty. Try the screw Lucy burger. The peanut butter sauce is strangely good on it. They've been making improvements since I started going there a few months ago and I didn't see a lot of room for improvement to start with. Love it, will come back whenever possible!
2014-04-16,5,The Corkscrew has got to be one of the jankiest dive bars in JC Heights but I love it anyway.  You will find locals and bartenders with that JC attitude, but get over it & appreciate it for what it is!  Some nights are hit or miss- it may be quiet or you may have just walked into a club with bad techno. The food is SLAMMING. I love the wings && mozzarella sticks.  I have yet to try the chicken sandwich & burger.  Overall though, I love it here & so glad we only live two blocks away!
2014-04-11,4,As a Heights dweller, great places like this are few and far between. Friendly staff. I love that you never know what kind of crowd there will be- kind of like a cross section of the Heights. Trivia on Thursdays with Justin is awesome.
2014-02-16,5,Wow, lived in the heights for a year and finally got to the cork screw.. And I was impressed.. They had a little laguitas little sumptin sumptin ale on tap.. Never seen this before.. The boneless buffalo chicken was on the money.. They had a great menu with so many drink options at the best prices without going into a dump oldMan bar.   The bartender and owner was really nice and attentive.. And the owner called us a cab and let us stay inside until it arrived even though he closed the bar.  Great crowd, nice mix of music..
2014-02-04,1,Obviously most of the reviews must be made by staff or friends of staff because they are completely wrong. -first off as soon as we entered there was some loud ass girl talking so damn loud to another person across the room about depressing and personal issues. The staff allowed it of course despite how annoying it was while keeping the music extremely low allowing the entire bar to hear her. -the bartender was very friendly but service was backwards because we sat at a table and had to constantly go over to the bar to order our drinks and food.-lastly the food was not cooked medium like asked and got the wrong cheese on the sandwich. It was mediocre at best so overall it was a very disappointing first time experience. WILL NOT BE RETURNING.
2014-01-17,4,I'm feeling the Corkscrew. Great neighborhood bar, lots of locals and regulars, but newbies like me are made to feel at home pretty quickly.  Buy backs come your way, and if you drink whatever the nightly special is you can drink pretty cheaply here.  My favorites are Bluemoon on tap and the house special drink, Screw Tea.  They have a pretty decent menu, very burger centric, I've had the cheese quesadilla and the waffle fries.  Dunked in ranch sauce on the side the waffle fries are pretty tasty!  Pool is free (yay) and trivia night is a blast.
2013-08-25,4,i've been here when it's been both dead and very busy, the crowd varies (ghetto one day, not the next) and i must say a few things are always consistent: 1- bartenders are nice & attentive 2- they always have some sort of specialthe NJ Transit bus 85 runs right by the bar, so you can take it down or Hoboken... or walk a few blocks to the light rail station on Congress
2013-05-11,4,For years I've passed right by this place on the walk home from the lightrail. Being a Corkscrew regular for over three years now, don't sleep on this neighborhood bar! This spot has one of the tastiest burgers I've ever had (friends from Queens and South Jersey always make an attempt to have one every time they are around the area)! Not a burger fan? Try their wings (buffalo and cajun dry rub) and buffalo cheese fries w/ ranch dressing.Their drink specials are reasonably priced ($2-3 shots)- try the Blood Orange vodka, it's sweet, smooth, and yummy-- totally appropriate for NYK wins (shameless plug for my die-hard Knicks fan-friends). For $5 you can treat yourself to the Campfire shot (it has cinnamon & fire, and it's just as amazing as it sounds)! Friends are a huge fan of their Screw Sweet Tea and Screw Rootie Tootie (be careful with these- dangerously sweet but guises the taste of alcohol). You'll be impressed with their selection of craft beers as well.The people who occupy this bar varies from night-to-night. For instance the Thursday rock lovin' Trivia Night crowd differs from the Saturday new hiphop/rap "let's party" crowd (bouncer included). Regardless of what day or time it is you will always find a couple of regulars, locals, and regular locals.The owner and bartenders are super friendly and personable. The owner, Youssef, will check in and say hello to you as well.The kitchen closes at midnight, perfect for your late-night appetite. So forget the diet for a night and come in with an appetite. Try the 'screw burger, wash it down with a 'screw tea, and thank me later :)
2012-12-06,5,Love this place. Ghetto but the crowd is friendlier than you think. Thursday night ladies 1/2 off the already cheap drinks. $2 PBR's go in :)
2012-09-19,4,Corkscrew is a great neighborhood bar.  Being born and raised in the area it is nice to find a bar that has a nice balance of locals and out of towners.  Sure, this bar definitely has the standard (JC) regulars, but that always makes for a great time.  Most people are friendly ( if they are not staring you down like a piece of meat) and the range of age and diversity proves they are a real neighborhood pub, not just your pop-up, artsy, overcompensating hipster bar.  Though some nights (thursdays, ladies nights 1/2 price drinks) are cray cray and so I can't say the crowd is peachy every day of the week.  Bartenders are all friendly and highly attentive.  Drinks are always on point and they have specials on the board every day.  Food is greasy and delicious but really, who doesn't love that?   What i mean is, if you are looking for a chill atmosphere, extremely tasty burgers ( cooked to  perfection by the bartender) and some slammin sweet potato fries( i like to dip mine in bleu cheese) then you have found the right place.  Try the screw tea - super sweetcakes.  Cheers
2012-07-29,4,I recently moved to the neighborhood and have begun frequenting this bar when I'm not quite up to venturing forth into more adventurous areas like hoboken and the city. It's a little divy, with somewhat of an occasionally suspect crowd, but for the most part a great time to spend a (relatively) quiety friday evening. They have a pretty standard beer selection, with a modest amount of imports and microbrews that's a little more stocked than your average watering hole. The barkeeps were friendly as well.
2012-03-24,5,I have always wanted to my own "cheers" bar where everyone knows my name. The Corkscrew is becoming that place. I live only 2 blocks away so i came here one day because i needed a beer. I saw at the bar by myself and instantly started talking to people around me. I brought my friends here one night and now it has become one of our regular spots. The vibe is really chill and welcoming. There are so many different types of people that go there and everyone fits in. There are so many regulars and so many people know each other. Its just a fun neighborhood bar. Oh and their food is really good! I love their cajun fries. Waffle fries with cajun seasonings and served with this spicy cajun mayo they make. I dont eat burgers but if you do i have heard they are good! And same thing about their wings! Check this place out!
2012-03-12,1,Some of the reviews below are so obviously written by the managers--so lame!The corkscrew really does have great chicken wings, but order them to-go...The management at this place is a joke!  they overly cater to their old regulars; this group of smelly, loud, inappropriate drunks.  Meanwhile they have attitudes with new costumers.  My friends and i moved here from NYC, we are all 20% or more tippers and laid-back customers...yet when you ask for simple things like "can you please ask they guy who smells like urine to stop leering at us and screaming at the TVs"--all the sudden we were made to feel ridiculous.we really did try to like this place, we went a handful of times during football season.  Luckily we met a few of the cooler people who went there (out of habit and convenience more than enjoyment; they said "well, its the only place in the heights, so... we know it is awful") and decided to rotate hosting football parties...just to avoid watching games at that shit hole.too bad for the corkscrew.  the location is great and the building has potential.  this neighborhood is coming up and if they catered to the new crowd, instead of old deadbeats, they could really have something.  I feel badly for the pretty girl manager who works there; she has potential, just like the place does.  but she and the corkscrew are TOTALLY DRAGGED DOWN BY YUESEF, THE IDIOT MANAGER.  if the owners read this: can that guy, groom you crowd, and you could really be the toast of the town (also, the grammatical errors on your signs are embarrassing).
2011-05-04,5,I'm giving the Cork 5 Stars because it is a 5 Star Neighborhood Bar.  I'm the weird mix between a local and a hipster.  I have been to dozens of JC local bars over the years, and I have found the best one: Corkscrew.The atmosphere is well lit and clean; something not found in many local bars.  The regular patrons range from the local flavor, workers, suits, mod punk, and teachers.  Euceph, the manager, is very friendly and seems to welcome every single person that walks through the door.  The drinks are reasonably priced as any bar in JC can be.  Great Happy Hour.  The food is the real treasure.  The signs say the best hamburgers and wings in the area.  The hamburgers are really really good and they have some specialty toppings.  The wings are hands down the best in NJ, NY and PA; I have lived in all 3 states and have searched for good wings.  Harder than you think.  The rest of the menu is excellent with the standard tavern fare with some added flare.   Overall- if you're looking for a place to stop by and get a drink and/or bite, then Corkscrew is for you.  If you're looking for your regular bar that when you walk in your beer is waiting for, then the Corkscrew is for you.  UPDATE!!!Cork has revamped itself!!  You wouldn't recognize it. Beautiful woodwork, granite bar, and fresh decor. The Jewel of JC Heights bar scene!  Prices still the same and the atmosphere is great. The new windows really change the place.  They expanded the menu with some specialty items such as Fish Tacos and Quinoa Salads, and they have started a brunch menu on Saturday and Sunday from 11-2. Eggs Benedict, $9, was amazing. My wife thinks it's the best in the area. The Chicken and Waffles, $10, are amazing. Take a look. Its worth a revisit; you won't be disappointed.Have Fun
2010-12-21,1,I am redoing my previous glowing review. I just left there annoyed, disappointed and hungry. Little background, I HEART their wings, I truly do. I allow myself to have wings there twice a month, and between visits I lust over the wings twice a day as I walk to and fro the lightrail. So today I decided to treat myself. Go in, order 10 wings plain to go and order a draft while I wait. Girl bartender, not friendly, doesn't ask if I want a drink, etc...order comes, I ask her to leave it on bar figuring I can enjoy while finishing my beer. Open up carton and its chicken fingers!! I immediately say "oh, I wanted wings" she said " that's what you ordered" and walked away. I try to be a good sport and start eating the chicken fingers, but disappointed and not happy. After two, decide I am not eating something I don't enjoy, ask for my check ...she hands it to me and I tell her I am pissed, that this isn't what I ordered, that she was rude and it was terrible customer service. Only then does she say, oh, well I will make you new ones. Didn't mean to be rude. It will take five minutes to make new ones. I told her that's what she should have said in the beginning and that I was done. Walked out leaving the fingers and half a beer. I know much worst things can happen in life but it isn't easy when you don't feel welcome. So disappointed. I had been looking forward to those all day. Left a bad taste in my mouth. Love the wings but won't put up with poor customer service. Guess I will have to find a new place to gush about.
2010-06-11,5,Its all about the Wings!  You would never know that among all of the dark and dingy local bars in the Heights of Jersey City, there is a small, clean, comfortable bar that has some of the best bar food in Hudson County, and possibly North Jersey.  The bartenders and manager are all very friendly, making you feel like a close friend the moment you walk in (unlike most local bars that frown on outsiders).  The atmosphere is clean and comfortable, and they have darts, pool, and video games.  But the real reason to go is the food.  The new management is always playing with new flavor combination and specials.  They currently have a "Screw Burger" that is amazing, with Gorgonzola cheese and a spicy Cajun mayo.  The wings are the best I've had in years, and blow away every other local pub in the area.
2009-09-08,5,This place is great! The crowd, the bar food and the staff just give this place great vibe. There are different drink specials all week long. This is the Cheers of Jersey City.
2021-11-03,5,You'll be greeted by a sign saying "Best Burger in the Heights" ... and we can safely say that it's true after trying their amazing burgers
2021-10-23,5,Ok, sooooo, we were unable to go to Hudson Burgers and Beer in North Bergen due to it not being open????? We waited a reasonable amount of time at opening time and still dark inside. Anyway we always wanted to try Corkscrew Bar in the Jersey City Heights and OH BOY ! Let me tell you ! This place was awesome ! First we had the sweet and spicy wings (12). They must have been brined because they were absolutely wonderful, tender fall off the bone inside and crispy sweet and spicy outside ! Mannn they are good, Next we went for the cheddar burgers (Pat LaFreida). Short rib blend, OMG awesome. And to top things off the chef really knows how to prepare her stuff! In addition to that we had the most attentive, polite awesome waitress/barperson, (Allison). Everybody was wonderful, beers were COLD! And prices were reasonable ! Thank you Corkscrew bar !
2021-09-20,3,Ordered the crispy chicken sandwich, Cajun fries and a jersey burger. For delivery 3 items came out to $50 for less than a 10 min drive away. The chicken sandwich although crispy was inconsistently salted. Some bites were savory others were completely bland. My boyfriend got the jersey burger medium rare but the pink to cooked ratio was overwhelming. Nothing special about either food item and definitely not worth wasting $50.
2021-09-04,5,Amazing burgers and a nice little seating area outside. Service is a little slow but that's ok as my husband and I love to come after work and chill.
2021-06-28,3,I'm giving this a lower than expected rating for a couple reasons.The employee cooking our food was visually working without a hair net, and seemed to not have the highest standards of health and food safety. Other than that the bartender that served us did a great job, she was friendly and pleasant with everyone in the bar. Overall I appreciate businesses that go above and beyond for food safety.
2021-06-04,5,AmaZing burgers & bbq wings! Very generous on the sauces for fries. Loved their menu!
2021-05-26,5,Great spot with great service and food.  Burgers are top notch.  They have pretty nice TV's for sports as well.
2021-04-30,2,Not here to review the food.  Sandwiches don't come with fries.  At $13-18, the expectation is fries.  Don't give me some canned "oh sorry the menu is wasn't clear" BS.  No time for bad business practices.  Operating a restaurant isn't all about saving a buck here and there.  Lost what would have been a return customer because I hate feeling like someone fleeced me.
2021-04-16,3,I needed a spot for delivery and found this on a delivery app. Before I ordered I also checked the Yelp reviews and they passed the test.  The burgers seemed to be the go to here so I went with it.  I went with a simple burger with american cheese and tomato. I ordered it medium and they did a good job cooking it. The burgers don't come with fries but you can order them a la carte. They have shoestring fries here so they are a little thinner but I like it that way.  Here is what tripped me up about the experience... it was $12 for buffalo fries and $5.50 for fries without toppings. That was bizarre. The portion wasn't bigger and the toppings didn't warrant doubling the price. Not sure if it was a typo or a mistake on the app but I wouldn't reorder the fries with toppings because of that. In the end, it was a serviceable meal and my craving for a burger was satisfied. It wasn't a burger I would rave about but it did the job.
2021-03-18,4,This place is the perfect hidden gem with amazing bar food.  It's a few blocks off the light rail, which is nice.  If you like burgers this is definitely the place to get one.  I am obsessed with their sweet potato fries and get them every time.  Beer/drink selection is good.  The staff is great.  This place is small, so on busy days you may have to wait a bit for a table or opt for takeout. We have been here twice and both times were amazing.  We will be back again for sure.
2021-03-10,5,We had just pulled into town and most places were closing. This place saved our butts. The burgers and wings were first rate. We took out b/c of Covid, but it looks like a fun place to hang.
2021-03-07,5,I went here to celebrate my birthday with a couple of girlfriends!!! Absolutely loved the vibe here and the servers (didn't catch their name) were super friendly and it is a pretty chill atmosphere! Will definitely go there again
2021-01-24,4,Really good, straight ahead bar food. They ain't fancy, but they don't need to be! The burgers, fries & chicken fingers are all tasty. This is the first place I'd ever been to that tosses the chicken in the honey mustard sauce to coat it. Amazingly simple thing, with amazingly wonderful results! A good beer selection & friendly staff make this a recommend.
2021-01-20,5,I had eaten here before but it has been maybe two years? And i remember it being a cool place to grab drinks and eat with a group of people. I was craving a burger and decided to take a chance. Why i say a chance? Well when you have your food delivered, there is a chance of it being soggy, messy etc. but wow! Our food was delivered and the presentation of the food was as if i am eating at the place. I highly recommend this spot and their food! My bf had the smokehouse burger and i had the Sriracha burger! Sooo good!
2020-12-30,5,Awesome little "dive" spot that we stumbled upon. They have a small kitchen to the side of the bar which is really cool in my opinion that slings pat lafrieda burgers, which are cooked PERFECTLY. They have wings and fries on the menu as well. You'll find a great assortment of craft beers from the area as well. I love this place it's just a few blocks walk from the light rail as well, which is super convenient.
2020-12-20,5,This bar is awesome we have been in here many times and the service is great. Food and drinks are always on point. Prices and quality is sooo good.
2020-12-01,5,A local gem, my favorite cozy bar to sneak in a quick meal, or spend all afternoon catching up with a friend on their outdoor patio. As far as the food, my friend told me Nicole's burgers were the best she ever had. I'm a veggie and with loads of options from the Buffalo cheese fries, to the delicious veggie burger the food really never disappoints. Nicole and her team are crazy knowledgeable about their large variety of local beers which is think really cool. They also have yummy old fashions in a barrel. If you haven't gone your missing out.
2020-11-29,2,I ordered the Buffalo Chicken bar pie. Wound up throwing half of it out. Some of the chicken was under cooked or very sinewed (gristle). Seems like scrap pieces were thrown on the pizza. Not recommended.
2020-11-22,3,Nice little local restaurant in the Jersey City heights. Came by for brunch, was seated outdoors in late October, wish they had some heating lamps. Service was decent for football Sunday, our server was bouncing around and working very hard. Food was okay, portions could of used some sprucing up; particularly the breakfast burrito. The breakfast burrito on the menu states it comes with home fries but came to realize it was like 3 pieces of potatoes IN the burrito, meh. If you live close by definitely worth going to wet your whistle, not sure I'd cross through town to go back personally.
2020-11-01,1,I'm not the type of person too leave reviews. The experience here for the first time was horrible. I ordered a veggie burger and it was fried and greasy! I ended up with food poisoning. I ordered a beer and it had soap in it. Terrible service. The food didn't even come out at the same time. The server didn't even remember everyone's order. I was highly disappointed.
2020-10-01,4,The location is not the best, but the food, omg,let me tell you something, the chicken wings and jalapeños cheddar burger are probably the best one I've never had. Yes they are GOOOOOD.  The waiter was really friendly and told us everything about the food and beer. I had really good time there.
2020-09-05,5,Corkscrew has y favorite buffalo chicken wrap in the neighborhood. The bartenders are also super friendly and knowledgeable on their beer options!
2020-07-30,3,We ordered delivery from here tonight for the first time. We ordered the chicken Caesar wrap, shoestring fries, and jalapeño cheddar burger with bacon added.I'll start with the pros:Everything arrived early thanks to Postmates delivery. Everything was packed neatly, no spills. Everything in order was correct. I like their logo stickers! The chicken Caesar wrap was full of chicken and a little lettuce. Flavor of Caesar dressing was good. The shoestring fries was a decent portion. The jalapeño cheddar burger was a good size and tasted great! I loved that it was rare (though that's not what was ordered). Bacon was good.Now the Cons:Burger didn't arrive hot, unfortunately. The jalapeños on the burger were not spicy lol. For the up charge I would have appreciated more bacon. The special instructions for the fries were not followed. We asked for them to be burnt and extra crispy. They were not. The chicken Caesar wrap was small for $12 and there was a lot of wrap, so it definitely could've been filled more. If not with more chicken, add more lettuce to stuff it!
2020-04-15,5,A Constant In The Crazy : Everything about our world right now  is uncertain, unnatural and unfortunate. So I'm more thankful than ever for Nichole and the team at The Corkscrew for risking themselves to provide us a bit of "constant in the crazy". Each day they are cooking for us and providing fantastic take out at a more than reasonable price with the same wonderful customer service and quality. Today was the Screw Burger and 12 BBQ wings. Hit and delicious even after the trek back to my place. PLEASE... give yourself a treat and a break from cooking and support this local gem as they try to provide the "constant in the crazy" that we all need so much right now.  Thanks and stay healthy everyone!PS: don't forget to dig deep when it's time to tip!
2020-03-07,3,This is a good example of an OK bar in the heights.  Food is pretty consistent, it's impressive what is acomplished with such a small grill.  Service can be spotty depending which bartender you get.  Definitely a neighborhood bar.  If you're not with the in clique be prepared to feel left out.  May try again.  Drinks are pricy for a neighborhood dive.  Worth a visit.  Decide for yourself.
2020-02-23,5,I'm recently  new to the neighborhood and I came here on a whim. I originally ordered take out but ended up wanting to stay and I was able to eat the meal at the bar. Very friendly staff and attentive. I look forward to coming bacK. Thanks for having me!
2020-02-22,5,Very relaxed bar! Great food, nice staff, affordable, and a chill ambiance. Multiple TVs to watch games. Highly recommend if you are looking to go to a local bar.
2020-02-09,5,I've been coming  to the corkscrew for 3 years and  I couldn't recommend a better bar. Great food. Better service. The best people in the business. Nicole, Rachel, Maria, Carlos, Darrell, Elliott, Dennis. The best ever!!!! Don't change a thing!
2020-02-06,3,Decent place to get a cheap beer and some fries. They have an indoor grill, but it's really just standard bar food.I do like their trivia nights because they always find a way of getting you a free drink, but it's a little annoying when you're trying to watch a game on a Thursday night.
2020-01-10,5,This is my second visit to Corkscrew Bar.  My first experience was great so when the hubby, son and his friends wanted a sports bar that was casual, quick and close to the school (Saint Peters U), I thought of this place.    It was a Sunday and the Eagles were playing.                  E A G L E S...Eagles!   The son had a b-ball game prior so we rushed over to Corkscrew in hopes that it wasn't too crowded for the five us to squat a spot. Corkscrew is a local bar on a corner in a residential area.  You would easily miss it if you weren't familiar with the area.  Thanks to Yelp in finding this hidden gem.  It's very casual with just a bar and a few tables near windows.When we arrived we were lucky to find a booth for all of us.  We immediate sat down to watch the Eagles game.  Our waitress Rachel came over, we shared words and she immediately remember us.  We ordered a couple beers and a Moscow mule.  Our apps were wings (bbq and honey mustard) which were good.  Entrees were Quesadillas, Burgers w/the egg (Jersey Burger?) and Grilled Chicken sandwich.  All of the sandwiches came with fries, sweet potatoe, waffle or regular.  We had all three.   This place is great for watching a game.  Not big but comfy enough to enjoy the food and conversation.  The service is always good and their hamburgers are the best.
2020-01-04,5,We happened upon this bar after brunch and had a great experience. The bartender was lovely and very knowledgeable. The place was also kid friendly, which is a plus since we have a 3 year old. We look forward to coming back!
2020-01-04,3,Corkscrew Bar is a typical local bar. It's pretty hidden and off the beaten path, so if I didn't see it on Yelp, I probably would have never stumbled upon it. It's a tiny little place with 1 bar that runs the length of the establishment, in the photos I saw a pool table, however in real life they haven't had one in ages.I came to Corkscrew with a group of friends - on a Friday night it was mildly busy so you could actually get the attention of the bartender which I liked. We ordered a some drinks like the Manmosa & some food like Threesome (Cajun waffle fries, Mozzarella Sticks, and Buffalo Wings)
2020-01-02,5,Came in with a party of two for a beer. I was pleasantly surprised by the service and amount of different beers on the menu. We order chicken wings, which were battered and not my favorite, but they were good. We also ordered some fries with this mayo sauce that was delicious and I def recommend. I was in the mood to drink beer, but since I don't know much about it I ordered the beer flight and asked for recommendations. The bartender recommended great choices for the two of us, even tho we had completely different tastes. Out of the 10 beers, we liked 9 of them!!! I was very impressed!!!
2019-12-01,5,The service was amazing the food was delicious and the prices weren't high! Definitely recommend this place.
2019-11-23,5,The best burger in jersey city by far....excellent taste, perfectly cooked, awesome bar..
2019-11-13,5,Great neighborhood bar. Best burger in the Heights,period. Darts, games, keno, karaoke, open mics.
2019-11-07,5,OMG!!!!! this place has the best fucking burgers I've ever tasted in my WHOLE damn life. They are so juicy and flavorful. First of all, I'm vegan adjacent so this was s cheat night. Secondly, I live in the city. I mean WAY uptown. Why am I across state lines, on a work night, whilst the sandman has already blanketed the city with sleeping dust? No one could tell you that, but what I do know. I'm definitely coming back here. Drinks are good, service is good, karaoke host/dj on Wednesday night rocks the house. Jersey City staple.
2019-10-20,1,If I can give a lower rating I would . First , they got some knock off soda so it tasted really nasty so I had asked the waitress which is also the bartender  to get me water she totally forgets and gave some other people water as soon as they walked in . Second ,When I said excuse me she gave a really nasty attitude. If she's frustrated and can't handle the bar and the outside of the bar that's non of my fault and super unprofessional for her to snap at a paying customer. Please hire better people or more people to help out . Last , she has the nerve to come out of the bar and say something I would've gave her a good tip if she was attentive and not so rude because I am paying for her service as well  aI didn't like It therefore I'm not giving her money for something she didn't provide .
2019-09-29,3,Generally happy with their food. Pizza not so much. Grilled chicken is a good choice.
2019-09-26,5,Rachel the bar tender was awesome! My friends and I, 7 of us, stayed in an Air bnb across the street from the bar! I must say, it was the most fun neighborhood bar with very friendly people! I met new friends! One of those "where everybody knows your name" bars!
2019-08-28,5,Yes it is a pub and yes it has a bar but my god is this place fantastic !! The service here is awesome. The burger here is the best burger in New Jersey. I read other reviews and thought there is no way this place has the best burger so my wife and I decided to go and check it out ourselves. To say that those reviews were correct is an understatement. By far the burgers here are as good as a burger from a fine 5 star restaurant. And if you like beer, their selection is great and the waiters know what to recommend. I loved it and so will you....
2019-07-10,5,Nice little bar/restaurant in Jersey. My husband and I went there for a late night dinner and to my plesant surprise, it was karaoke night! I love karaoke, lots of great singers! Friendly staff, karaoke guy and patrons.
2019-05-29,5,I love this place! Great staff and the food is sooooo good! I am quite obsessed with their grilled chicken sandwich.  So much so, that I've made it my personal mission to find a better one in the area and none compare!
2019-02-17,5,Corkscrew is another great place up in the jersey city heights. It a pretty good sports bar (although one time they didn't play the giants game on the main bar screens because a customer had first dibs with a dolphins game? Weird, but I forgive them.The wings are great there, as well are the burgers. My favorite burger is the brunch burger, with Taylor Ham, cause we're in north jersey and not the savages of south jersey calling it p*rk r*ll. The burgers are cooked perfectly right on a grill in front of you and they use pat lafrieda meat, which is simply the best.
2019-02-15,4,I dig what has evolved here after Yusef left...Not that I didn't like Yusef, just that Nicole has brought a cooler vibe to the establishment, can't figure out why, but it's just a feeling of you never know what's going to happen, & later on, it gets packed!...Wes & Rachel are excellent bartenders, & Shorty is an awesome DJ...No shit, I was there one evening & hung for like 6 hours...and there were people who were there before me & hung longer...testament to the chillness of the place...Now if they can only get those nice big rocks for my whiskey glass...
2019-02-10,1,It was okay but I was absolutely turned off by the smell of bacon in the air. Now my pea coat smells of swine. Mind you I'm a swine lover.
2019-01-21,4,Lively local place, family run i belive. Good for  a fun hangout its a small place though . Got a burger and waffle fries they taste good. The food is made besides the bar and you can see it being prepared. The staff is  good. Price is reasonable. I would come back here if i am in this area.
2018-11-25,5,Love the bartenders! Super friendly. Great brunch menu. Love manmosa and bloody Mary's
2018-10-04,3,Definelty a divey type of joint. I liked that we have a small yet decent bar right in the heart of the heights neighborhood. The food is good. We really like the waffle fries. Chicken tacos are good too. It is a small menu as it is a small place, the kitchen is right in front of you at the bar area. I don't mind that actually, I like watching the cook prepare my food, that I can make sure there isn't any funny business happening with my food. My only complaint is that the have the DJ play music SO DANG LOUD. And no I'm not old, I enjoy listening to music and all that but for real, for such a small space they have the music blaring! So if you'd like to leave a place with a headache this place is for you lol. Over all though, decent joint to have a few beers and a late night snack!
2018-10-04,3,Visited Corkscrew in the Jersey City Heights neighborhood after hearing about their "Manmosa," which friends mentioned was worth a try. I visited with a friend on a Wednesday evening, there was a decent amount of folks in the small neighborhood bar, but it soon became more packed later in the evening as the baseball playoffs were starting. There was also plenty of parking around the neighborhood, so that was very convenient as well. As friends recommended, I tried the Manmosa (Blue Moon, Vodka, Splash of Orange Juice, Topped with a Float of Champagne) ($10). It took a bit of getting used to and it did taste a bit unique at first taste, but it was tasty after you do. We also ordered a side of Cajun Waffle Fries (Crispy Cajun Waffle Fries with Cajun Mayo) ($6), which was very tasty as well. Generally, it was a fun time. Very much a neighborhood bar with good food and reasonably priced drinks. I would certainly come back in the future for a laid-back time catching up with friends.
2018-07-25,5,I learned about this place because it's my cousin's favorite spot, especially for burgers. I have to agree with him on that because their burgers are really good. Great atmosphere with great people. If you want to watch any games and have a few drinks in a chill location this is the place to go.
2018-05-12,5,The brunch on Saturdays and Sundays is FIRE. Pretty happy about it. And, super nice people. I'm from Texas so nice is definitely a requirement. If you want a cool hang, great food, and great drinks, this is the place!
2018-05-07,5,Local Bar of Jersey City Heights, with great food, solid drinks, and friendly service. I have been meaning to review this place for both the brunch menu and the late night snack options.Love the buffalo french fries with mozz cheese on top and ranch dipping sauce on the side. This dish in its simplicity is fantastic because every ingredient is prepared perfectly and the combination is just delightful. The crunchy french fries topped with melted mozz cheese dipped with some ranch sauce is just so great.Wings here, the dry rubs are so friggin good and these aren't the baby tiny wings, these wings are like thick, meaty and super filing, I could honestly eat about 20 wings by myself but these wings are so big, I could only finish 6. Hamburgers, juicy and amazing. The burger is so thick and piled high with ingredients and really delicious. Honestly, don't think you could go wrong with any of the items on the menu, have never found something yet at least.The drinks, the bartenders are super friendly and if you talk to them like humans, they will pour with a heavy hand. Especially some nights its like dead so you can just be chill and hang out there - won't regret it a great time!
2018-04-21,5,Live this place and the local vibe. A Live music brunch in Saturday's from 1-4pm hosted by Nick Ciavatta is an outstanding fun event, and open mic night on Tuesday's from 9-12am can range from rock, to rap, to poetry to singer songwriter to outstanding musicians is a must attend. The hamburger is to die fir!
2018-04-21,5,OH MY GOD THAT WAS SO GOOD.  Drinks, juicy high quality burgers, friendly staff.  I can't wait to go back
2018-03-30,5,Everytime I come home from Hawaii this is the only I go to for food drinks and quality people
2018-03-21,5,We ate here on our honeymoon. I had a chicken ceased salad which was wonderful. My husband had the grilled chicken soft taco but it came out barbecue chicken and he didn't like it. Not that it was bad food, it just wasn't a liking to his taste buds. We had water which was good, didn't taste like tap water at all. There was live music for open mic night which was awesome. The place was packed but not rowdy and we didn't have trouble finding a table.
2018-03-02,4,Believe it or not this lil place actually has a good dj....moscow mule is the new drink to have but i still prefer a blue moon or guiness...alot of ppl i know actually hangs out here lol i showed up one night it was like a lil reunion...saturdays is the best night
2018-02-18,3,Place actually isn't bad I mean if I could give a 3 and a half stars I would, but they kind of messed up on my order and the grilled chicken sandwich I ordered was pretty small. Service wasn't bad either but I requested the Cajun mayo and they forgot(I'm sure he forgot) to add it on my sandwich and never came back to check on us so I couldn't ask for it if I tried. We sat on the table instead of on the bar as the bar was pretty crowded and we wanted to stay away from the crowd. The buffalo chicken wings were actually really good and the burger my friend had also looked delicious as he said it was but my chicken sandwich lacked size and flavor. I will give them another try since the food wasn't bad and hopefully the server that took care of us checks on us the next time, and hopefully I can change my review.
2018-01-25,5,I spent half of my NYE here. It was a lot of fun, for the most part. I haven't had the food yet but the drinks were a solid price and made well. It gets very loud here due to the music and influx of people but I've grown to accept that and don't mind. I think I'll partake in one of their trivia nights soon. It looks like a lot of fun.
2017-12-08,4,Great neighborhood bar with brunch on the weekend, bar food and burgers at other times and games on the TVs. It gets a bit loud during games, as you could imagine. Staff is friendly and quick. Their "kitchen" is literally the little griddle behind the bar. Bathroom is kind of set up awkwardly. I come here for brunch because their Bloody Marys are the best in JC, hands down. There are three different spice levels, I like mine spicy and find the medium heat one just perfect. I turned a little red sipping down the extra spicy one. Brunch menu is limited to a few breakfast items and wings. Wasn't really into their Benedicts but the egg tacos and wings were good. I am told this place is very different from how it was years ago.
2017-11-18,4,Local neighborhood bar with great staff and a nice selection of drinks.  It attracts a lot of young professionals and locals and has a very relaxed, friendly vibe about it.  My only complaint is that when they have a DJ in there it's too loud to have a good conversation...and too small to really dance...I'd say scrap the DJ nights and focus on being a relaxed local bar!
2017-11-08,5,Small kitchen but well thought out menu. I really like this place. If you're new to the heights it's a good place to get to know your neighbors.
2017-10-29,4,Casual, solid sports bar with friendly staff. Great choices for beer and all the tv screens for my husband. There were only 3 people working on the Thursday night we were there, but still the service was good. My veggie burger and fries were good. Husband didn't care for their wings since they were breaded, but that's just a matter of how he likes his wings. Seating is self-served which I always like. We'll be back.
2017-10-21,5,Nice corner neighbor spot. Amazing food, great service and good music. Everything I had here has been awesome from the eggs benedict to the chicken and waffles and their specials are killer too! Good drinks, and if you're a Bloody Mary person they make awesome.
2017-10-16,5,I'm a Bloody Mary snob. I was hesitant to try theirs but then I saw it as a special on the drink menu.  Three different levels of spicy? Oh I just had to try.  Omg, addicted!! What is their secret? Absolutely superb. Fabulous vibe and creative, delicious food menu too!
2017-10-04,1,I thought this was a residential area? Anyone want to start a petition to close them down? Unless they keep the noise inside..
2017-09-14,5,Fantastic service. Ridiculously good food, especially the burgers, fried chicken sandwiches and waffle fries. My go to bar in the heights.
2017-09-14,3,Loud! I would not recommend going here on a Saturday if you are planning on having a conversation/ catching up w friends. You won't be able to hear much haha! The bartender working there was nice.
2017-08-26,5,This burger is insanely delicious. Overall, super chill neighborhood joint with dive prices and a surprisingly good margarita. Sometimes, I just stop by for sweet potato fries. They say there is live jazz on certain Sundays, but I've never happened by at the right time. Karaoke on Wednesday is great time!
2017-08-22,5,Really solid neighborhood joint. When I lived up in the Heights, I used to come here late at night for a bite. Always friendly people around and waitstaff. Curly fries and a burger are the way to go and they have well-priced brunch. :) The patrons are for the most part longtime Heights residents.
2017-08-18,4,I had the brunch burger, advertised as Pat LaFrieda (I'm a fan). She had the eggs Benedict. The burger came with a fried egg underneath. It was cooked to the proper doneness I'd ordered. While it was missing the cheddar cheese from the menu description, it was a good burger nevertheless, so I didn't mind (I did end up mentioning this to the waiter). It came with a perfectly fried order of waffle fries.The eggs Benedict were well received with a tasty albeit pretty thin hollandaise sauce. The accompanying home fries were spot on.Service was friendly and fine, with even the cook checking in with diners.The ambiance is a sports bar with several tables, most of which are the higher tables you find in a bar area of a larger restaurant. I liked the electronic music playing, but didn't open the Shazam app.There is a bit of a disconnect between the menu and what shows up on the bill. For example, the bill showed a burger charge plus a charge for the missing cheese, while the description on the menu said it included cheese. Since the waiter took the missing cheese charge off the bill, it didn't matter to me. You may want to keep an eye out.We'll likely be back.
2017-07-16,1,Horrible service. The manager Yusef is a RACIST. My friend got kicked out and was told by the manager that he had to leave because he another customer wanted to fight him.. what the manager didn't know is that they were actually friends and it's known he made it all up. What each race was is irrelevant, but my friend was the only one of his kind there that night and he was shunned. Never did anything wrong. Disgusting. Don't spend your money here. This behavior should NEVER be supported.
2017-07-11,5,I've been here twice & plan on coming back over & over again! Great food for Brunch, lunch or dinner! Great burgers!! Well made drinks & ice cold beer. Nice ambiance & interesting clientele. Very cool bar & neighborhood. Love it!
2017-07-04,2,Sweet potato fries were burnt, "Cajun Dry Rub," actually means plain breaded and fried wings, BBQ wings were also super breaded and fried with a drizzle of sauce, not tossed. Service was very nice, although a bit slow.
2017-06-14,4,one of those truly neighborhood places to hang out. Good bar, good drinks, good tv screens all over to watch whatever sports are on. BUT what they have which many neighborhood bars don't is AWESOME food. I didn't think the food would be ok. But it is. And its not your average flavor, average quality, average spiced food. They get crafty with their burgers, and pizza, and fries, and drink & food specials. And that just makes you want to come back often. Staff is very friendly and welcoming. Such a variety of folks who come through there to drink and eat. Check em out, you wont be disappointed.
2017-05-02,4,Good spot to have a few drinks and a bite to eat. Staff is friendly and they have some game nights
2017-04-30,3,Rolled in about 12 on a Sunday for brunch... with "no way to heat up water" coffee and tea were immediately ruled out. The portion size left much to be desired, especially in the spud department. On top of that our order was botched and oh yea they didn't have coffee! Bullspit
2017-02-21,5,I was here for a Devils viewing party. The burgers were awesome and the beer was nice and cold. I had a great time.
2017-02-16,5,Stopped in on a Monday night to explore with my boyfriend ! Awesome little place foods looks great can't wait to try it out .  Jay took great care of us ! Played Jenga all night so much fun deff coming again !
2017-02-16,5,A great neighborhood bar. The staff is always super friendly. The menu isn't extensive, but what they do have is absolutely delicious and affordable. We stop in at least twice a month for a burger or the brunch chicken and waffles.
2017-02-12,5,best burger & beer in jersey city hands down (including downtown spots). A must try especially for my fellow Heights neighbors!
2017-01-05,5,Love these guys! Always warm and inviting staff, great beer selection and fun regulars. Thanks for the great vibe Euceph.
2016-12-03,5,I was very skeptical because of the neighborhood and the outside but once I went it, it was pretty cool. Music was nice and it was not full. Cook and bartender were really nice and friendly. Good prices, would come back.
2016-11-29,5,Love this place. The wings and burgers are way better than most pubs. Bar staff great. This place isn't trying to be Fox and Crow down the street - isn't trying to appeal to Brooklyn hipster crowd ... thankfully. Cork Screw just a solid neighborhood bar with no attitude
2016-10-30,4,Nice surprise! Stopped in on a rare trip through the Heights and were very pleased. Very friendly welcoming staff. Had wings, a burger, sweet potato fries, and chicken and waffles. Everything was perfect, the burger was cooked to order, sweet potato fries were crispy and served with a delicious garlic aioli sauce. We will be back!
2016-10-09,4,First time at a bar in the Heights. Great chicken and waffles and tacos. Great atmosphere. Knocking off one star because the bartender just let obnoxious people vape illegally in the bar and didn't care when I brought it to his attention.
2016-10-05,1,Place regardless of the much do renovation SUCKS at best! Hard to believe the owner renovated to "try" to make this place better under the management of Euceph must be related or blowing him! No change has occurred same crack ass ghetto folk with more expensive drinks and food. There was a time before Euceph and the renovations, this place was classic and had a great neighborhood vibe now its just filled with thinking its the TGIF of Jersey City Heights! New management is a definite need for this place to survive! To the owner you are sitting on a pot of gold but yet what is being create is tin!
2016-08-05,1,Ugh.What a bummer. I was really hoping I would like this place - unfortunately, my very quick experience has put me off for good.I rarely go out in my own hood, but my friend was willing to travel and we chose the Corkscrew. it was very busy when I walked in, There happened to be two seats at the bar, so I asked the bartender if they were free and he said yes. Great. I studied the menu for a few minutes - it looked really interesting actually, and I was planning what I wanted, but realized I hadnt ordered a drink, so I looked up and tried to catch the bartenders eye.Well, I sat there 15 minutes being absolutely 100% ignored.He knew I was there totally because I spoke to him and he watched me sit down.As soon as my friend arrived we bolted. I was actually really pleased I got ignored, for we went over to the Fox and Crow and had a delicious, and very serene experience.FAR more civilized.Even if I hadnt have been ignored, we would have left after the first drink because the vibe in there was HORRIBLE.I cant for the life of me figure out what the Corkscrew is trying to be or who it wants to cater to.The menu sounded really good and a step up from standard bar fare, the decor is sports bar, the crowd was mixed the music was rap the vibe was club.It was A W F U L.Quite obviously if you are over 40, you are unwelcome.If you have any sense of sophistication, save your money and walk over to Fox and Crow to spend your money.
2016-07-28,5,I love this place. Best bar in the heights. Food is great. Beers are cold ;) and the staff is friendly and awesome. Special shout out to Wes and Eucef for always making me feel welcome. As an added bonus they have trivia night on Thursdays.
2016-06-26,4,Weekend brunch review. Well this was a very pleasant surprise. Brunch is a favorite for me and the Mrs. The Corkscrew has a pretty nice sized menu with about nine to ten items for brunch.  It was hard to choose.  I finally decided on the brunch burger which had a Jersey sandwich staple, Taylor ham, egg and American cheese.  It is served on toasted bun and topped with a sriracha aioli and accompanied by sweet potato fries.  There is just something about a burger cooked on a grill that makes your mouth water.   This burger does that and more.  They are known for their burgers and I can see why, they are outstanding. The wife had the brunch Cubano, a traditional Cuban sandwich topped with a runny egg on an English muffin. It also comes with fried plantains. She really enjoyed it saying the egg with the salty pork and pickles were delicious. Believe it or not there was a three piece Jazz band that started playing shortly before we left. Which of course caused me to order a pint to prolong the stay. I had the Illusive Traveler Grapefruit Shandy. It was very refreshing with just a hint of the grapefruit.  I would definitely come back. Though they probably should think about hiring a waitress during the weekends as they were packed and seemed to me that 3 people just aren't enough.
2016-06-17,1,Disgusting food, burgers charged at $10 each without any accompaniments, one was burnt and the other being extremely under cooked. Has an amateur chef but wanting to charge Michelin prices. Get real this is still the heights not Williamsburg or lower east. DO NOT BUY FOOD FROM THIS SHITHOLE, managers don't even respond to complaints and they didn't seem to care. Spend your money somewhere else than this filthy bar. Also after ingesting few bites a friend and I were extremely sick afterwards. Hopefully someone with any knowledge of running a successful bar will eventually take over this place because it's run by idiots who haven't any clue as to what catering and service industry entails.
2016-06-10,5,Awesome place!!!!! Daniel " the bartender" is Amazing!!! right on board with your drinks and food!!!!! totally worth going for a fun time with great people!!!!!!!!!!!
2016-06-03,5,Daniel the bartender was the man. He had the whole bar and tables handled. as soon as our drinks were empty they were full. very attentive.
2016-06-01,4,I came for trivia night last Thursday and was pleasantly surprised. The trivia was difficult but super fun and interesting. The trivia host was engaging and the wait staff / bartenders were very attentive and entertaining. Even the music was solid!I didn't order any food but sat right by the kitchen and everything that came out looked delicious, especially the sriracha honey wings that were on special. I hope they're on the menu when I come back. I might make this a regular spot, especially on trivia nights.
2016-04-29,5,I have to say that I was highly impressed by this place in JC.  The environment is just amazing for a Saturday night, the place is always full of life as I had to go back again cause I got hooked.  The live DJ is amazing.  The costumer service is great, the waiter remembered us the second time we were there.  But the food!  The food is amazing, so fresh and delic, I would encourage anyone to visit this place.
2016-04-05,5,This place got a major overhaul a bit ago. The owner, taking a hint from the slow gentrification process in the Heights, gave this bar a beautiful facelift. This place is TOTALLY different than what my partner and I witnessed when we gave it a try about 2 years ago. Being slightly turned off by the ratchet-ish ambiance, I vowed not to return. BUT this place has totally changed since then and it certainly still has that neighborhood feel with a more refined ambiance, adorned with new wood floors and tables, and flat screen tvs, but most importantly: an actually appetizing menu. Yes, there's the classic bar food but they take it a step further serving bar food that's worth trying and isn't only fried crap. They even have a brunch menu! I truly enjoyed my calm, chill brunch experience recently on a Sunday. My beau and I, refusing to wait for brunch at a downtown JC spot, decided to try the chicken & waffle dish offered here. We were so surprised at how good the food was! The waffle was fluffy & soft, what you expect from a great waffle, and the chicken (boneless strips & I ordered a side of sweet & spicy chicken wings) were cooked/fried to a yummy crispness that satisfied our Sunday brunch cravings. Top that with a $5 mimosa and a $4 Yeungling and we were set. The Big Bang Theory on tv was also a plus! This is a great neighborhood spot!
2016-03-28,4,Solid local spot with TVs for sports and a rotating selection of drinks on tap. The food is good and the cook staff are always coming up with fun new food ideas. I recommend getting the wings, they are killer!
2016-03-16,1,Good evening,I just moved to Jersey City and someone recommended Corkscrew to me.  So I went a couple weeks ago with a buddy.  We had a tremendous experience as Tracy was SO accommodating in a way that didn't seem fake. AT ALL.  Made us feel right at home. It was terrific. So naturally we wanted to go back and we did.  But our 2nd visit was a horror show. Service slower than molasses. Maybe it's because Tracy wasn't there.
2016-02-05,4,My husband and I stopped here tonight for a quick drink and meal and I like it!Sat at bar which was filled with what appeared to be regulars.  Very nice bartender who had a real handle on everything that was going on.   We ordered a dozen wings - half Thai half spicy.  Good wings, well seasoned and served with some sort of creamy dipping sauce, not bluecheese dressing.    We had a second beer ($2 for a Yuengling, so cheap) and asked for an order of sliders.  The sliders come in three with really good crispy skinny fries.  The food was good and the cook seemed very happy to be interacting with the guests.  It's fun to thank the cook directly and see him smile in appreciation.  A woman next to us had a very good looking hamburger that she said was perfect.The only thing that was weird, and absolutely no reflection on the bar, was that some of the regulars at the bar are a bit loud and crude, talking about things best left for a bachelor party.  They seemed intent on making the newbies cringe, or at least that's the impression that I got.  This place has been around for a while, and in fact we'd been there 12 years ago when we lived in the Heights and it was more of a tavern, so maybe the guys were used to a bit more of a boys-club atmosphere and we were the ones in the way....
2016-01-31,3,I'm unsure how Corkscrew Bar has such a high review here. Anyway, good burgers, good fries, and decent beer list.Better service and better decor would help a lot.A good neighborhood pub, but certainly not great. However it's obvious that some effort is put in to having somewhat interesting burgers and specials. Just sort of seems like 50% effort is put in. A fair comparison would be White Star Bar, which is a much better example of a great neighborhood pub. That being said, I'll keep coming back for the Apple Bottom burger and a stout!
2016-01-06,5,I am a sucker for a good neighborhood bar!! And this one stole my heart!! My boyfriend lives around the corner and we often find ourselves here when we want a drink, a great dinner , or even just want to get out of the house! I seriously enjoy the service, the waiters and bartenders are so friendly, helpful, and great to chat with! The atmosphere and people are never too rowdy and always comforting. We stopped in on a fall night to grab a bite and some drinks before meeting friends downtown. The apple bottom burger was so on point and I like to say "tasted like fall". The drinks are priced great, I love cider which usually runs around 6-7$ and they have lots of beer on tap.
2015-12-20,5,Went on a Sunday for brunch. Love their brunch on Sundays! My boyfriend and I went here for the first time to have some brunch on a Sunday when the Ravens were losing terribly ( Ravens fan this 2015 season sucks for us) anyway . We had the chicken and Waffles and Argentinean Hot dogs. Okay .... BEST. HOTDOG. EVER! Lol they were banging. We also had the buffalo fries. It was delist! The mimosas complemented our meals nicely. Overall great place  try it here it's worth it. Great prices.
2015-10-04,4,You'd be surprised the brunch is pretty good here. Its a couple of blocks down from my house and I come here sometimes at night with my neighbors. Its a fun atmosphere and drinks are well priced. I have to admit I've been hammered here and have had good memories. I just dislike that they took out the pool table.
2015-09-24,4,Yay neighborhood bar! I swear I had already reviewed this place but it seems like that review is gone so here we go again. I've been to corkscrew before and after the renovations and must say kudos for the update!! Adding windows to the location is a big PLUS along with getting the pool table out.  Sorry, not sorry.  They have definitely update on so many level and kept the same feel as to a great neighborhood bar. Their food has stayed yummy and perhaps better than before. Their burgers are so delicious, the fries and the perfect amount of crispiness. They have Sunday Brunch that has live music as well.  Trivia on Thursday nights and I think Ladies night on Saturday.  TVs to watch games, high top tables, they even have a jukebox machine where you can play music. Definitely a great bar in the heights.
2015-09-22,4,Went here one night for drinks and have been going ever since. Thursday is trivia night, food is great and my go to drink when it's available is the "victory golden monkey". Three of those and your good for the rest of the night.
2015-09-15,4,Two words "Kevin Bacon!" You won't be disappointed! This place is a nice neighborhood bar, nothing pretentious just good food and drinks.
2015-08-30,5,I think the Corkscrew Bar & Grill is my favorite gastropub in Jersey City! Tara makes great drinks and Kevin is a mad scientist with the food! Delicious food concoctions!The Chicken & waffles during brunch is really good! The salmon and Sautéed spinach Benedict was really delicious, their BBQ Wings were crunchy and juicy; but the winner was their Screw Burger....FRICKN SLAMMIN'! Now it's important to note that I still have an affection for the burgers from Left Bank, The Kitchen & GrovevStreet, Dullboy, Park & Sixth (lamb Burger), Light Horse Tavern, Krugs Tavern (Newark NJ), and Park Tavern, but I gotta be honest the Screw Burger is "Winninggggggg"!
2015-08-28,5,The corkscrew has a special place in my heart.   I started going after work to catch a drink about 5 years ago.  It is not the usual place to "fall" in love but, I did!  Anyway back to the bar...It has changed so much in the last 5 years!  It was always a great place to hang with some friends and drink, no frill, just fun.  With the renovation and the strengthening of the management the Cork,  it is really developing into something more than a bar.  Euceph is the bar manager that keeps the place contemporary with its changing neighborhood and clientele The food that Kevin is making at the grill and the quality of meals is something that surprises me every time I go.   They have specials that change often and go quickly which speaks to how tasty.  They are big part of the community and host different events that support the community.  Jazz brunch is fun!
2015-08-23,2,Wings are from a frozen bag. They are the ones that are 50% breading and 40 bone and 10% chicken meat. What goes on with all these reviews about great wings? Ugh. I went by other reviews and was stuck with 24 deep fried disappointments. Place is nice inside and drinks look good as well as other food menu items so perhaps there is hope yet. Wings though, don't be a turkey and get them.
2015-07-30,4,Great selection of alcohol and great food. There is a lot of local vibe here and looked like everyone knew each other. First timers might feel a little out of the place. Flatbreads and wings are a must try.
2015-07-25,5,My husband and I have gone here a few times for brunch and it is amazing. Even though the menu is small, the food is fantastic. You would never think to hit a bar up for brunch, but this is the place to go!! Very unique menu!
2015-07-12,4,One of the local bars in Jersey City Heights. Walked over to check it out. It wasn't packed when we walked in on a Saturday night. We sat at the bar. I found out that it Saturdays are Ladies Nights so all martinis were $5. I asked the bartender to make me a sweet martini and he made me a white gummy bear martini which was pretty delicious. They also have a pretty decent beer selection. The kitchen is behind the bar area in the back corner. They have a pretty simple food menu considering they don't have a real kitchen. I was pretty amazed by what they can make. We had 2 drinks and left. The place was pretty crowded by the time we were leaving. All the seats at the bar were taken. They also have Trivia Thursdays and brunch on weekends until 4pm. I will definitely be back to check that out.
2015-07-02,5,On a Friday or Saturday night in the Heights, this is the place to be.  Nothing fancy, nothing "hip" or pretentious.  Just a solid bar with solid food and solid drinks.  The food is all very good, and their brunch is dangerous. I can't go here for brunch and expect to do anything productive, because I'm going to stuff my face with chicken and waffles and down 3 manmosas before I leave, no matter what my initial plan going in was.The staff is friendly, and there's definitely a close, communal feel to the place with a steady crowd of regulars every weekend.
2015-06-28,4,First impression.. Yay!!!!I'm from Irvington where I have not visited any bars and I will not say Y.. I visited the Bar/Grill with a friend who frequent the place. The bar manager (cute) staff( day and evening) where beyond the epitome of friendly and service . The atmosphere is warm, inviting and place bigger than I thought from the outside view. I can speak on both the morning staff/food and the evening staff/food. The woman ROCK even my waitress, cook and bartenders. I got a chance meet the handsome guy who put the menu together and I say damn good menu: Keep up the good work. My bartender RJ ( HOTTIE) is the BOMB: if you don't know what to drink then he s the man to make one up for U.
2015-06-05,4,What a pleasant surprise this place is. I must say for that area this spot was way last on my list for places to go eat and drink just because I remember what it used to be before their renovation. But it's a cute spot! Small and intimate with speedy service. The locals there are all super friendly and the food is actually pretty amazing! The chicken and waffles takes the cake for me but their burgers are delicious as well. Plus they have trivia nights - I now know how I will be spending my Tuesday evenings... For those who haven't been definitely check this place out! It wont disappoint.
2015-05-31,5,Utterly amazing bar food!! Perfect for late night cravings like buffalo wings, cajun fries or a delicious screw burger. Add a couple of blue moons and you are in business. My wife and I drove by this place repeatedly on our way back home and always wondered if the food was any good. Boy we got more than impressed by it. We are from union city so it's perfect if you live close by the heights. Parking is tricky but you can usually find a spot on webster. Back to the food they got so many combinations for their burgers and fries that you can definitely find something to suit your needs. They got specials every night and live music during the week. The service is also on top of its game. The staff is friendly and efficient.I would highly recommend stopping by this joint. Planning to come back soon. Can't get enough of those wings and fries combination.
2015-05-28,5,As always, the beer selection is great (and changes regularly), the brunch is awesome, and everyone is so welcoming. Best place is the neighborhood.
2015-05-18,5,Great atmosphere, great choice of local beer on tap, delicious bar food -- Mac and cheese is a must try!!! I am really impressed by this bar, will for sure come back anytime soon.
2015-05-17,3,We came to Corkscrew for brunch with a friend. For prime brunch time on a Sunday, it wasn't too packed and was a nice and cool place to hang out before going over to the farmers market. Brunch menu was fairly limited. They had two specials - an eggs Benedict florentine with salmon and a chicken fried steak dish. Feeling underwhelmed by the rest of the fairly small brunch menu, I ordered the chicken fried steak. I almost immediately regretted this after seeing the chicken and waffles come out.Everything looks like it's homemade despite their tiny kitchen - I watched the food being made and nothing came from a freezer bag. Pretty impressive. The chicken fried steak itself was pretty good, but the gravy didn't really taste like much and the accompanying biscuit was a little too heavy. My two brunch companions had cocktails which were quite large and inexpensive. One reported that the eggs Benedict was "standard" and the other said that the salad he had was good, but could have used more quinoa. Note that there are very limited vegetarian options. Also, they didn't offer the yelp check in deal, so keep that in mind if you think you'll get 25% off. This seems like a good place for drinks and bar food, but I'd probably skip the brunch next time.
2015-05-16,4,Honestly wouldn't have thought this place was going to be as nice as it was. When stepping inside you forget where you are and could easily think you were in some trendy Brooklyn bar. The food was also a surprise the chicken sandwich and the classic burger were both nicely displayed and tasted delicious. Would have given this place 5 stars but I felt the food took just slightly longer than it should have.
2015-05-12,4,I live a few blocks away and I've only been here a few times with my gf but each time was great. Perfect local bar with great food. Pretty good draft beer selection and I think the Old Fashioned I ordered was better than most I've gotten at some cocktail bars in downtown!  Worth a visit if you're in the area.
2015-05-09,5,The new food menu is slammin ! Heart attack hot dogs may be the best dog ive ever had... buffalo chicken pizzas and the quesadillas  never disappoint. The real gem is the WINGS sweet & spicy BEST WINGS IN THE JC AREA HANDS DOWN. The people are chill locals/regulars and always  new faces every night. Staff is always awesome. Definitely  best bar in the heights if not all of JC.
2015-05-07,5,My only lament is that I live so far away, otherwise I would be a regular in this cozy bar!I was visiting my friends in JC and we were in need of some brunch/lunch options. My friend suggested his new favorite place, the remodeled Corkscrew, advice which I'm glad I took. The remodeled interior was very welcoming, with dark wood and a semi-rustic feel. The large windows made for great lighting and people watching as we enjoyed our food and drinks. The music was perfect, the playlist was on point for the 25-35 year old crowd. There wasn't a bad song played, all familiar favorites. I do love me some 90's R&B.The tap list, while not overly extensive, was very impressive. Its a rotating selection with excellent offerings from Ommegang, Brooklyn, Dogfish Head, and other reputable craft breweries. As a beer drinker, I was very excited by the offerings and sad I could not try everything as I had to drive into NYC directly after the meal. I was able to try a tasty saison, and I will definitely be back to try more. There was also a nice selection of specialty mixed drinks and daily cocktail specials. This is the kind of place where drinkers of all varieties will find something to satisfy their palate. The food selection is limited because there really isn't a full kitchen space. All the food looks to be prepared in a small griddle area behind the bar. Given these limitations, the menu is still impressive. I got the Screw Burger, while my friends had eggs benedict and the chicken and waffles. The burger and eggs benedict were good, but not great, pretty standard fare. I liked the thin cut fries that accompanied the burger, crispy and fresh. The real standout was the chicken and waffles. The tenderloins that topped the fresh, fluffy Belgian waffle were so moist and well seasoned, they easily make my top 5 list of chicken and waffles I've ever had. However they're preparing those chicken tenders, I'm convinced there some wizardry happening. The dinner specials looked really good, but sadly were not available during lunch. This is a true neighborhood bar, one that makes you feel at home the moment you walk through the door. The friendly, attentive staff, chill music and ambience, and delicious food make me wish they'd open up shop next to me in Morristown. Until then, I'll gladly make the trek up the JC.
2015-05-06,5,I'm from jersey city and I work in the industry in Hoboken. I've been to the corkscrew 5 times in the last month after my shift. And I really fell in love with it. It's an amazing vibe and atmosphere. Great people and drinks. Service is perfect and management has this place running on wheels!! It's my go to bar from now on.
2015-05-06,5,Corkscrew is a model of consistency. I've been here several times and the service, food and drink selection are always outstanding. They've really rebranded themselves to into more then just a local watering hole and are quickly becoming a go-to spot in the JC Heights. There are three scenarios that I usually find myself in here:BRUNCH. The new spring '15 brunch food/drink menu is phenomenal. I came in last week and we all ordered the chicken and waffles **droool** - two fried chicken tenders atop a soft and pillowy belgian waffle drenched in powdered sugar and maple syrup. Need I say more? I'm not into bloodies but my friends agreed that these were some of the best. Din Din. This is a good place to come in and unwind after work, especially if you are into unwinding with a beer in one hand and a burger in the other. Depending on the night there are various drink specials and trivia. The BF and I are partial to the burger with a Three Philosophers demi glace. Not even Socrates, Plato and Aristotle could resist this. Add in some smoked Gouda and perfectly caramelized onions and we've got a real serious mouth party on our hands. Cooked to perfection, this left little to be desired except for more. The beer infused demi glace was the perfect accent. They change their dinner specials up pretty often. Late Night. My friends live up the street and we come in for a nightcap from time to time, every saturday, same difference. I never drunk eat ... but if I were going to then the classic bar menu choices like mozz sticks and chicken fingers would be my choice. If I were going to. Jeez Corkscrew, I wish that you weren't so damn good because JC has way too many other spots to try. Your worth the trek over from Grove Street any day of the week.
2015-05-06,3,People are friendly. Good fat burgers. Wish there was a pool table or something of that sort.
2015-04-16,5,Went to Corkscrew. Pretty cool place. They did a great job renovating the place and it looks great. The food was pretty good and the crowd was pretty chill. They have a great election of beers and some nice choices on the menu for food. Definitely going back. Someone who worked there that didn't wait on me said to have a good day. I appreciated that. You usually don't get that personal touch. Keep up the great work!
2015-04-15,5,I came here for the first time after the refurb with the fab Nile H. and after an hour she said "This needs to be your neighborhood bar".  Indeed, I went back a few times after and always enjoyed good drinks, good food, and great company. I've moved out of the neighborhood (*sob*) but the Corkscrew will always be my short list of places to hang out in JC.
2015-04-06,4,Corkscrew Bar is a great addition to the Riverview Arts District of Jersey City Heights. The owner is very attentive to the customers which he tries his best to really get to know you even when the place is crowded. The Hamburgers are probably the best burgers that I have had in a long time. Eclectic list of beers on tap...something for everyone. One suggestion that I would make is to turn the tunes down just a bit on Sunday afternoons when the games are on TV. Other than that, you will see me there again.
2015-04-04,4,Went here cause I was craving a burger and from reading the reviews I thought I would try. My craving was quenched. Got the southwest burger and my boyfriend got the Lucy screw burger and they were both banging. People were really nice. The beer selection was decent. Really nice environment I'll definitely be going back
2015-03-31,5,I've been living in the heights for almost 10 years and always travel downtown for grub and drinks.  A friend of mine suggested we go to Thursday trivia night.  It was fantastic!  We arrived early to ensure seats at the bar.  The "Garbage Tater Tots" were fantastic to go along with our 3 shared beer flights.  The Trivia Master was quick witted and had a varied mix of questions.  I won a Jameson shirt!!! The crowd was a chill but damn serious about their trivia!  The bar gave away cash prizes to the top teams.  It was a great time and I plan to go back for some more!
2015-03-28,4,Really chilled out place ! Good food and good beer. Love coming here with my husbandThey have good wingsThey have really friendly bartenders on the weekends RJ AND Yusuf. And Casey too.
2015-03-26,4,Lovely little corner bar in a weird part of jersey city. Its small, but intimate and has a great selection of craft beer on tap. I was so surprised and if youre not sure what something tastes like, dont be scared to ask for a sample. Their food menu is small too, but they do make aloit of their dishes---very few things are frozen.They even have a DJ in the corner, however his lights are a big exhausting. The staff and owners are awesome and so friendly. And they do ladies night, $5 martiinis on a saturday after 8!They need to tfix those bathrooms tho, theyre messy and smell so bad.
2015-03-06,4,Great neighborhood spot! Tara, the bartender, was friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu and all of the beers on tap.My boyfriend and I both ordered burgers off of their small but interesting menu. Burgers were juicy with a great char, a bit under-seasoned though. The waffle fries are AWESOME. Prices are great! Our entire meal with drinks was about $30. The music was on point switching seamlessly from dance music to old school hip hop, however sitting at a table by the speakers my boyfriend and I found ourselves practically yelling at each other to be able to have a conversation. Overall, great experience. I'm excited to come back on the weekend to try brunch!
2015-03-01,4,I was pretty happy with my experience at Corkscrew Bar. Some further thoughts-The good:-the kitchen is open until 2 hours before the bar closes everyday... so on weekends, it is open until 1 am which is way later than most other bars in JC-really friendly service and bartenders who make sure to learn your name-interesting specials (when I was there, they had a quinoa salad, fish tacos, and other stuff)-16 beers on tap plus many bottles in addition to a fairly wide wine selection and a full bar including a few specialty cocktailsCould be better:-I ordered one thing from the menu, the barbecue chicken tenders. They weren't bad by any means but I thought they could have used more flavor and/or more sauce. The sample size is super small though and I look forward to trying more of the menu-I asked what beers they had on tap and was told they have 16 and then asked what I like. While I appreciate the bartender trying to find me something I would like, I would have liked to see a list of their selection. Not sure if they have one (it wasn't part of their drink menu) but with that many beers on tap, they should-The menu isn't small but it also isn't the most interesting- you have pretty much standard finger/bar food like chicken wings, burgers, fries, etc. Their specials and brunch menu show more imagination so it would be nice to see this included in a few of their regular food items as well. Not a huge issue but just a thought-I was told martinis would be $5 because Saturday was "ladies night" but was charged $7 on my bill. I didn't bother to get it corrected because that is still a pretty good price and I wasn't going to complain about $2 but I guess just having consistent pricing would be good.Overall, I enjoyed my time here and although there are a ton of options in Jersey City, I could definitely see myself coming back.
2015-03-01,4,This was the 2nd Sunday we have had the new Brunch menu and it was as good this week as it was last week. We love the chicken and waffles. The waffles are flavorful and the chicken is just the right size to compliment the waffle in addition to being crispy and very tasty. Great job Euceph and Kevin. This is our new favorite place on Sunday's.
2015-02-28,5,When my wife and I moved to JC, we thought this would be our neighborhood bar. We were right!  This place has a solid list of beers and their recent renovation classed the place up considerably. The staff is always friendly as well.Their new brunch menu took us by suprise this weekend. Their kitchen setup is tiny, but they crank out some great stuff! The chicken and waffles with maple bacon butter is outstanding and the croissant french toast is solid. Highly recommended.
2015-02-27,5,I have to give this place 5 stars.  I've becoming to corkscrew for a while now and have to say it is a great local hang out bar.  I work in the area so it's a very convenient location.  The environment is very casual and chill.  There's a jukebox, high top tables, nice bar area, trivia on Thursdays and GREAT food.  I love their wings, but tonight they had a special - fish tacos and they were AMAZING!The staff is great and know how to treat their customers.  If you haven't been there it is definitely a must!
2015-02-25,5,Almost afraid to leave such a rave review in fear of not getting a table next weekend. I'm a huge breakfast/brunch lover and this place is top notch. They've really stepped up their game and I couldn't be happier. The chicken and waffles was hands down the best I've had in NYC/nj area (and I've had many.) The Bloody Mary special is a welcomed treat after a night out and I recommend the medium heat - the hot is habanero and only for the daring. The staff is efficient and beyond friendly. Can't beat the prices and the craft beer selection is pretty darn good, especially compared to other bars in the neighborhood. The overall experience here is fantastic. Highly recommend. Proud to have such a great place in the heights!PS- for all those fry fans like me...they have waffle friessss!
2015-02-25,5,The corkscrew is really leading an amazing charge to up the game in the Heights. No lie,  this may have been one of the best brunches I've had, considering the overall meal ( $9 eggs Benedict, $5 fresh Bloody Mary's, great service, fresh and fantastic food and great bar/ restaurant space with amazing staff). The hollandaise sauce was the best I've ever had and you can get the Bloody Mary's three different ways ( the hottest is really, really hot- be warned). Please support this local spot and the amazing direction in which they are moving.
2015-02-19,5,Great food, amazing drinks, and super lovely staff! The Trivia Thursdays are a lot of fun! You should check out this pace whenever you're in the area! Loved it!
2015-01-24,5,Love this place manager is supper friendly n off course drinks are cheap very work it.. Good music, good drinks, n good  staff
2015-01-16,3,Great bar and food.  The only problem I have is that if the bartender doesn't like what you're playing on the jukebox, they'll override it.  Other than that, I love this place.
2014-12-23,5,This is the new local spot! The atmosphere is chill and friendly,  plus the food and drinks are amazing!!! Order the wings and an old fashion and tell Euceph Andre sent you, trust me the best pairing you will ever have! The staff is very attentive and drinks are reasonably priced.  I've finally found my "cheers bar" and they actually wanted to know my name.
2014-12-10,5,Went on trivia night- everyone was very friendly- had a great time! Trivia was intricate, challenging and fun! The fries are wonderful! Would ask for a veggie/vegan burger or mushroom option though so I don't eat fries all night haha. But they were delicious! The beer selection was great. Prices were typical of Brooklyn for beer. Clean, easy to get to and chill, looking forward to going back!
2014-12-02,5,For being a few doors down I figured I'd give this place a try. I came in for a few beers and left. I came back a few weeks later and felt very welcomed by the owner and he even remembered me by name which was very nice.I was coming in for only a drink or two but with the awesome service I decided to stay and try some food instead of going to hoboken. I'm glad I did. The Lucy burger sounded weird but with bacon, peanut butter with a hamburger cooked perfectly, it was very good. Good drinks, good service and good bar food for an affordable price, will definitely be back.
2014-11-08,4,first time at this place and it was a great time. stopped in with a friend for a couple drinks ended up staying longer then we planned. the beer selection was great, I had a hard time choosing because I couldn't see the taps from where I was sitting, but luckily both the bartender and owner were there to offer some options with samples. the cook accidentally made buffalo cheese fries that ended up with us, yum! I'm excited to go back during my next visit to jersey city, I hear the burgers are amazing!
2014-07-03,4,This is only my second time up in the heights but this place comes as a surprise.  Great draught list and nineties rock, a pool table and six screens.  Bartenser is also knowledgable.  Cant speak to the food but the grill looks inviting.   If you like the downtown jc feel of yesteryear you'll dig this place.
2014-05-22,5,I've been coming to this bar for a while. First the service:GREAT! That's why I've been coming here! All the help does a fantastic job and the owner Yusef (hope I spelled it right) will go far out of his way to make sure you enjoy your experience. The other employees seem to really care that you enjoy yourself and make damn fine drinks. The food is deceptively good for the price. I just ate a 6 dollar chicken sandwich that made me want to go back for more. Wings are great. The XXX isn't that spicy but they're tasty. Try the screw Lucy burger. The peanut butter sauce is strangely good on it. They've been making improvements since I started going there a few months ago and I didn't see a lot of room for improvement to start with. Love it, will come back whenever possible!
2014-04-16,5,The Corkscrew has got to be one of the jankiest dive bars in JC Heights but I love it anyway.  You will find locals and bartenders with that JC attitude, but get over it & appreciate it for what it is!  Some nights are hit or miss- it may be quiet or you may have just walked into a club with bad techno. The food is SLAMMING. I love the wings && mozzarella sticks.  I have yet to try the chicken sandwich & burger.  Overall though, I love it here & so glad we only live two blocks away!
2014-04-11,4,As a Heights dweller, great places like this are few and far between. Friendly staff. I love that you never know what kind of crowd there will be- kind of like a cross section of the Heights. Trivia on Thursdays with Justin is awesome.
2014-02-16,5,Wow, lived in the heights for a year and finally got to the cork screw.. And I was impressed.. They had a little laguitas little sumptin sumptin ale on tap.. Never seen this before.. The boneless buffalo chicken was on the money.. They had a great menu with so many drink options at the best prices without going into a dump oldMan bar.   The bartender and owner was really nice and attentive.. And the owner called us a cab and let us stay inside until it arrived even though he closed the bar.  Great crowd, nice mix of music..
2014-02-04,1,Obviously most of the reviews must be made by staff or friends of staff because they are completely wrong. -first off as soon as we entered there was some loud ass girl talking so damn loud to another person across the room about depressing and personal issues. The staff allowed it of course despite how annoying it was while keeping the music extremely low allowing the entire bar to hear her. -the bartender was very friendly but service was backwards because we sat at a table and had to constantly go over to the bar to order our drinks and food.-lastly the food was not cooked medium like asked and got the wrong cheese on the sandwich. It was mediocre at best so overall it was a very disappointing first time experience. WILL NOT BE RETURNING.
2014-01-17,4,I'm feeling the Corkscrew. Great neighborhood bar, lots of locals and regulars, but newbies like me are made to feel at home pretty quickly.  Buy backs come your way, and if you drink whatever the nightly special is you can drink pretty cheaply here.  My favorites are Bluemoon on tap and the house special drink, Screw Tea.  They have a pretty decent menu, very burger centric, I've had the cheese quesadilla and the waffle fries.  Dunked in ranch sauce on the side the waffle fries are pretty tasty!  Pool is free (yay) and trivia night is a blast.
2013-08-25,4,i've been here when it's been both dead and very busy, the crowd varies (ghetto one day, not the next) and i must say a few things are always consistent: 1- bartenders are nice & attentive 2- they always have some sort of specialthe NJ Transit bus 85 runs right by the bar, so you can take it down or Hoboken... or walk a few blocks to the light rail station on Congress
2013-05-11,4,For years I've passed right by this place on the walk home from the lightrail. Being a Corkscrew regular for over three years now, don't sleep on this neighborhood bar! This spot has one of the tastiest burgers I've ever had (friends from Queens and South Jersey always make an attempt to have one every time they are around the area)! Not a burger fan? Try their wings (buffalo and cajun dry rub) and buffalo cheese fries w/ ranch dressing.Their drink specials are reasonably priced ($2-3 shots)- try the Blood Orange vodka, it's sweet, smooth, and yummy-- totally appropriate for NYK wins (shameless plug for my die-hard Knicks fan-friends). For $5 you can treat yourself to the Campfire shot (it has cinnamon & fire, and it's just as amazing as it sounds)! Friends are a huge fan of their Screw Sweet Tea and Screw Rootie Tootie (be careful with these- dangerously sweet but guises the taste of alcohol). You'll be impressed with their selection of craft beers as well.The people who occupy this bar varies from night-to-night. For instance the Thursday rock lovin' Trivia Night crowd differs from the Saturday new hiphop/rap "let's party" crowd (bouncer included). Regardless of what day or time it is you will always find a couple of regulars, locals, and regular locals.The owner and bartenders are super friendly and personable. The owner, Youssef, will check in and say hello to you as well.The kitchen closes at midnight, perfect for your late-night appetite. So forget the diet for a night and come in with an appetite. Try the 'screw burger, wash it down with a 'screw tea, and thank me later :)
2012-12-06,5,Love this place. Ghetto but the crowd is friendlier than you think. Thursday night ladies 1/2 off the already cheap drinks. $2 PBR's go in :)
2012-09-19,4,Corkscrew is a great neighborhood bar.  Being born and raised in the area it is nice to find a bar that has a nice balance of locals and out of towners.  Sure, this bar definitely has the standard (JC) regulars, but that always makes for a great time.  Most people are friendly ( if they are not staring you down like a piece of meat) and the range of age and diversity proves they are a real neighborhood pub, not just your pop-up, artsy, overcompensating hipster bar.  Though some nights (thursdays, ladies nights 1/2 price drinks) are cray cray and so I can't say the crowd is peachy every day of the week.  Bartenders are all friendly and highly attentive.  Drinks are always on point and they have specials on the board every day.  Food is greasy and delicious but really, who doesn't love that?   What i mean is, if you are looking for a chill atmosphere, extremely tasty burgers ( cooked to  perfection by the bartender) and some slammin sweet potato fries( i like to dip mine in bleu cheese) then you have found the right place.  Try the screw tea - super sweetcakes.  Cheers
2012-07-29,4,I recently moved to the neighborhood and have begun frequenting this bar when I'm not quite up to venturing forth into more adventurous areas like hoboken and the city. It's a little divy, with somewhat of an occasionally suspect crowd, but for the most part a great time to spend a (relatively) quiety friday evening. They have a pretty standard beer selection, with a modest amount of imports and microbrews that's a little more stocked than your average watering hole. The barkeeps were friendly as well.
2012-03-24,5,I have always wanted to my own "cheers" bar where everyone knows my name. The Corkscrew is becoming that place. I live only 2 blocks away so i came here one day because i needed a beer. I saw at the bar by myself and instantly started talking to people around me. I brought my friends here one night and now it has become one of our regular spots. The vibe is really chill and welcoming. There are so many different types of people that go there and everyone fits in. There are so many regulars and so many people know each other. Its just a fun neighborhood bar. Oh and their food is really good! I love their cajun fries. Waffle fries with cajun seasonings and served with this spicy cajun mayo they make. I dont eat burgers but if you do i have heard they are good! And same thing about their wings! Check this place out!
2012-03-12,1,Some of the reviews below are so obviously written by the managers--so lame!The corkscrew really does have great chicken wings, but order them to-go...The management at this place is a joke!  they overly cater to their old regulars; this group of smelly, loud, inappropriate drunks.  Meanwhile they have attitudes with new costumers.  My friends and i moved here from NYC, we are all 20% or more tippers and laid-back customers...yet when you ask for simple things like "can you please ask they guy who smells like urine to stop leering at us and screaming at the TVs"--all the sudden we were made to feel ridiculous.we really did try to like this place, we went a handful of times during football season.  Luckily we met a few of the cooler people who went there (out of habit and convenience more than enjoyment; they said "well, its the only place in the heights, so... we know it is awful") and decided to rotate hosting football parties...just to avoid watching games at that shit hole.too bad for the corkscrew.  the location is great and the building has potential.  this neighborhood is coming up and if they catered to the new crowd, instead of old deadbeats, they could really have something.  I feel badly for the pretty girl manager who works there; she has potential, just like the place does.  but she and the corkscrew are TOTALLY DRAGGED DOWN BY YUESEF, THE IDIOT MANAGER.  if the owners read this: can that guy, groom you crowd, and you could really be the toast of the town (also, the grammatical errors on your signs are embarrassing).
2011-05-04,5,I'm giving the Cork 5 Stars because it is a 5 Star Neighborhood Bar.  I'm the weird mix between a local and a hipster.  I have been to dozens of JC local bars over the years, and I have found the best one: Corkscrew.The atmosphere is well lit and clean; something not found in many local bars.  The regular patrons range from the local flavor, workers, suits, mod punk, and teachers.  Euceph, the manager, is very friendly and seems to welcome every single person that walks through the door.  The drinks are reasonably priced as any bar in JC can be.  Great Happy Hour.  The food is the real treasure.  The signs say the best hamburgers and wings in the area.  The hamburgers are really really good and they have some specialty toppings.  The wings are hands down the best in NJ, NY and PA; I have lived in all 3 states and have searched for good wings.  Harder than you think.  The rest of the menu is excellent with the standard tavern fare with some added flare.   Overall- if you're looking for a place to stop by and get a drink and/or bite, then Corkscrew is for you.  If you're looking for your regular bar that when you walk in your beer is waiting for, then the Corkscrew is for you.  UPDATE!!!Cork has revamped itself!!  You wouldn't recognize it. Beautiful woodwork, granite bar, and fresh decor. The Jewel of JC Heights bar scene!  Prices still the same and the atmosphere is great. The new windows really change the place.  They expanded the menu with some specialty items such as Fish Tacos and Quinoa Salads, and they have started a brunch menu on Saturday and Sunday from 11-2. Eggs Benedict, $9, was amazing. My wife thinks it's the best in the area. The Chicken and Waffles, $10, are amazing. Take a look. Its worth a revisit; you won't be disappointed.Have Fun
2010-12-21,1,I am redoing my previous glowing review. I just left there annoyed, disappointed and hungry. Little background, I HEART their wings, I truly do. I allow myself to have wings there twice a month, and between visits I lust over the wings twice a day as I walk to and fro the lightrail. So today I decided to treat myself. Go in, order 10 wings plain to go and order a draft while I wait. Girl bartender, not friendly, doesn't ask if I want a drink, etc...order comes, I ask her to leave it on bar figuring I can enjoy while finishing my beer. Open up carton and its chicken fingers!! I immediately say "oh, I wanted wings" she said " that's what you ordered" and walked away. I try to be a good sport and start eating the chicken fingers, but disappointed and not happy. After two, decide I am not eating something I don't enjoy, ask for my check ...she hands it to me and I tell her I am pissed, that this isn't what I ordered, that she was rude and it was terrible customer service. Only then does she say, oh, well I will make you new ones. Didn't mean to be rude. It will take five minutes to make new ones. I told her that's what she should have said in the beginning and that I was done. Walked out leaving the fingers and half a beer. I know much worst things can happen in life but it isn't easy when you don't feel welcome. So disappointed. I had been looking forward to those all day. Left a bad taste in my mouth. Love the wings but won't put up with poor customer service. Guess I will have to find a new place to gush about.
2010-06-11,5,Its all about the Wings!  You would never know that among all of the dark and dingy local bars in the Heights of Jersey City, there is a small, clean, comfortable bar that has some of the best bar food in Hudson County, and possibly North Jersey.  The bartenders and manager are all very friendly, making you feel like a close friend the moment you walk in (unlike most local bars that frown on outsiders).  The atmosphere is clean and comfortable, and they have darts, pool, and video games.  But the real reason to go is the food.  The new management is always playing with new flavor combination and specials.  They currently have a "Screw Burger" that is amazing, with Gorgonzola cheese and a spicy Cajun mayo.  The wings are the best I've had in years, and blow away every other local pub in the area.
2009-09-08,5,This place is great! The crowd, the bar food and the staff just give this place great vibe. There are different drink specials all week long. This is the Cheers of Jersey City.
