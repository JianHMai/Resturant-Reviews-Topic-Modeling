2021-10-30,5,Service was unusually great for nyc/ hoboken area. Everyone was nice and attentive. Loved the cocktail and wine choices. Food was tasty as well. I'd definitely visit again.
2021-10-30,5,The food and service is great. Outdoor dining was really good to where for a moment you forget you are on the sidewalk. It has a romantic vibe late at night. We enjoyed our meals.
2021-10-18,3,This  restaurant had a good vibe. Sat at a 4 top at the bar. The waitress preferred us to order our apps and entrees  at the same time for the kitchen so we were like sure no problem. As we are eating the apps, our other food comes.  Small tables.  So of course the guy starts to take out apps away! I literally was scraping burrata off the plate as he was taking it away.  I really wanted to send the food back and tell them to wait with it. But who knows what would happen. We wanted to hang out and have drinks but we were so rushed out of there. Left us with a bad taste. The waitress had zero personality and was kinda short with us  and bitchy.
2021-10-11,1,Extremely disappointed. I've lived in the area and Zack's has always been a staple. Last night, I ordered the Brisket Burger (take-out) and upon returning home I discovered that instead of the Brisket Burger, I was given a plain hamburger patty with lettuce and a bun. I called and was told to come back with the burger and they would sort it out. Once I got there, I was told that the CHEF (not management) refused to change my meal because the order ticket said "Classic Burger" instead of Brisket Burger. I asked the host if there was anything they could do as I had COME back a second time and he said no, that the chef would not change the order in ANY way. The host then asked me if I wanted my initial order back, now cold and soggy, as if he was doing me a favor. I asked to speak to a manager, and was told there was no manager. This is completely unacceptable to treat a paying customer in this way. No apology, no reasoning, not even an offer to the burger it off my bill for their blunder. This was a mistake on the restaurant and they did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to cure it. Their disinterest in trying to take care of a paying customer who had made a second trip back to the restaurant was actually quite shocking. While this place has good food, I'm done with this place, they need to figure out their management and fix their customer service/hospitality. I'd warn those who plan on going to be aware that the complete lack of service will not justify the pricey bill you'll be left with and that any complaint you have will not be addressed with management because there is none. While this place is good, its not that good to be treated like garbage and keep returning.
2021-10-10,5,The food was spectacular!! My boyfriend found this place and made reservations for brunch. Everything was so good all the way down to the mimosas! We split the BLT and Mac cheese. Mac and cheese please get!  You won't be disappointed because it is goodddd. The BLT was so tasty! Even the fries were perfectly cooked. I really enjoyed the bacon because it had like a fire pit smoked taste to it and they put the garlic aioli on it which made it even more tastier. Mushroom soup was very good! And the Parmesan bread that came along was great. Mimosas was really good too! The perfect blend of juice and champagne and it was a decent price. I will definitely be back here again. I want to try the lunch and dinner menu.
2021-10-04,4,The staff here was very friendly and welcoming. Our waiter was knowledgeable of the menu and attentive. The outdoor seating was perfect and airy and is in an area that wasn't too busy....at least not while we were there. I ordered a chopped "cobb" salad and it was very underwhelming. The salad looked and tasted quite bland. On the other hand our drinks (sidecars) were made to perfection...Manhattan level good which I was pleased with.
2021-09-25,5,Had a lovely experience at Zach's. Ordered the Kung Pao Cauliflower to start which was delicious. For entrees we ordered the chicken skewers and steak and shared the two. Large portions, and quality food. Service was good and atmosphere pleasant. No complaints and would return!
2021-09-24,2,I've been here 5 times since I've moved to Hoboken, and the first few times no complaints -- great service, great atmosphere, great food.However, we went on a rainy night and had a reservation soft indoors. Upon getting there, while half of the restaurant was empty, they sat us next to a noisy group of 4 when they could've sat us on the other end, however they did move us once we asked to be moved.Once we sat down, we were informed that we only had 90 minutes to dine since they had to move their outdoor reservations indoors. This wouldn't have been a big deal, except during the duration of our dining our waitress kept reminding us of the time we had left.To top things off, the French onion soup was lukewarm, dinner was brought out far before we finished our appetizer, the braised short rib was flavorless, and the coffee at the end was not good and had grinded coffee beans in it.Considering we've been here a number of times and it's been great, it's disappointing that we had this happen to us. What was supposed to be a relaxing night with my girlfriend ended up being rushed, annoyed, and flavorless.
2021-09-11,5,this is my second time coming here and I am already planning a third! i've come for brunch and dinner and both times were AMAZING. the drinks are so refreshing and tasty and each meal I got was so flavorful. last night I got the lamb bolognese pasta. it was DELICIOUS. I can't wait to come back!
2021-09-11,3,I only get takeout from Zacks on occasion and the food is pretty good, but we usually get it for the Mac n cheese. The Mac n cheese is so perfect, not too cheese but also buttery on a shell pasta. Absolutely love!
2021-08-26,4,Wanted to try something new in Hoboken for the night. Settled on Zack's Oak Bar & Restaurant. It's a smaller spot; inside is dimly lit and sort of intimate. We elected to sit outside due to the nice weather. The food was good but not spectacular. They ran out of salmon (which we both wanted) so we had to settle for chicken. The nice decor and good service were enough to make me drop in again if the chance arose.
2021-08-15,4,So I met a friend of mine for brunch here. I made my reservations online for 12:30pm. When I arrived I parked on the street fairly quickly. I walked up and the hostess greeted us and sat us. She sat us in the corner inside and said there is a 90 minute limit for tables. Mackie was our server and she was nice. For my drink I ordered a spiked coffee drink and my friend ordered a mimosa. The drink wasn't bad, didn't taste any liquor at all. For my entrée I ordered the chicken and waffles and my friend ordered the salmon salad special. My meal wasn't bad at all, I liked the waffles more than the chicken. My friend said her salad was good, she just wished there was more dressing. The bill for me came to about $31. We had a pretty decent time all in all.
2021-08-14,3,The first thing I noticed about Zack's was the friendliness of the stafff. I was greeted with a great big smile and I immediately felt welcome. Servers were attentive and had a positive attitude.The food was pretty good. I got the salmon benedict for brunch and had some of the chilaquiles. I saw the breakfast burrito and was surprised by how large it was. Next time I may try the burrito.The drink I ordered was mediocre. I had a coffee and baileys based cocktail and it was very diluted in flavor and weak in alcohol. It did not taste good.The prices were moderate. The food was moderately reasonably priced, the drinks were not.I would give this place 3.5 stars.
2021-08-13,2,Party of two. Two stars go to the waiter for a good service. Everything else in short - Unwelcoming hostess (girl w curly hair) / food disappointed tons. Had a reservation for 9 pm. Came in at 8.50. While a long line of tables was open outside (with few inside as we found later) we were told we have to come back at 9 as there are a lot of reservations. We looked at rows of  empty tables (see pic) and went to the car. Came back at 9 and the situation with tables didn't change. No ppl. Hostess was not welcoming and showed us attitude for no reason. Food was ok Ish. Ordered pasta - way too salty. Ordered steak - no flavor or spices. Not sure what everyone likes about this place. We had high expectations I guess for no reason.  Not going back for sure.
2021-08-03,5,Found this place searching for cute restaurants on Yelp, and I couldn't be happier! Such great food if you're in the mood for anything from bar food to a salmon entree. The drinks are also really good and made perfectly every time. Since I've found this place I probably get it like twice a month
2021-07-20,4,Came for a late lunch and decided to sit at the bar. Michael, the bartender is awesome! Very personable, friendly, and attentive. He  was able to create drinks around my grapefruit obsession lol. All of my drinks were 10/10. The menu for lunch had a good number of choices from salads to sandwiches to entrees. Tried the calamari for starters. I wasn't a huge fan of the coating on the calamari not exactly what I'm used to. Seemed a little heavier than normal but despite that it was delicious! Opted for a Cobb salad for lunch and it was just ok but that's my fault for getting iceberg lettuce based salad lol. My friend got the pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries and loved it. Overall great experience!
2021-07-18,4,Went for a Sunday brunch and loved it. We were seated pretty quickly and our waitress was very courteous. I like the options on their menu, both food and liquor. I got the Chilaquiles. Very generous portion. Could have been a touch more spicy for my liking but it hit all the right notes. Our drinks arrived pretty late, but this was likely a one-off; our waitress mentioned the bartender was running behind with orders. Overall, definitely better than some of the other Hoboken-JC brunch spots I've been to, and I'll probably visit again.
2021-07-17,4,Always been a fan! I hadn't been back in a while so I'm glad I stopped in on a Tuesday to grab dinner! We had the avocado pear salad (my fav), mussels app and each ordered entrees. My friend had the shrimp/scallop special and I had a cheese burger. I loved everything - she thought the special was just ok and wanted a more buttery lemon sauce taste. We also tried there brownie with ice cream on side (dairy allergy) and it almost tasted flourless? I enjoyed it because I'm used to that but I don't think my friend did. Regardless service was pretty good and food was too! I'll always support Zack's!
2021-07-15,3,This is our second visit to Zack's and there is a lack of consistency. The experience was so incredibly different. Our first visit was for brunch one Sunday afternoon and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal ambience and drinks.  A very attentive staff throughout. This visit was poor from the start to the end.  The hostess at the door was on the phone when we arrived, not a problem, but she didn't acknowledge we were there. The only available seating for a mid-week dinner was outside, ok, but not our preference. Our waitress did not visit our table for 10 minutes take a drink and appetizer order. Our drinks were watery. The food was  good. Our next course came out and the empty dishes were still on our table. In short, disorganized and unprofessional. The bill was also disorganized, order the same drink twice, once it was $10 and the next it was $12. We were told that a rocks and neat drink is priced at a $2 difference. Huh? At least the food is good, the rest is a toss up.
2021-07-13,4,Dined here based on reviews and I too must give this restaurant a thumbs up. We had a wait but with Covid restrictions in place, it was understood. Our server was fantastic. He gave us honest, and great suggestions for their menu. I had the Brisket Blend Burger and Braised Shortribs. Our server was more than happy to make this alteration to my order, and it was appreciated. All three of us dining were very happy with our meals. Great portion sizes and all were very flavorful.
2021-07-06,3,First time here and the service didn't convince me to return. Multiple staff walked by not even acknowledging us. Appetizers took way too long, in fact I ate my entree before my appetizer ever came. It was clear our server kept forgetting to put it in even though I mentioned it every time he passed. I was full by time it finally arrived and I was too upset to deal with the hassle of sending it back and making a big deal  - I just wanted to pay and leave. I actually gave it 3 stars because the food was at least good.
2021-06-25,1,After coming here for 5 years... Never. Again.The interaction with both general manager & server was unlike anything I've ever experienced before - unprofessional, rude, argumentative, & passive aggressive to end it all. The fact that the GM was leading by example speaks volumes.As someone who has worked in foodservice before, I get the industry is tough, but WOW was tonight unacceptable!Firstly, we waited 20 minutes to see our server after placing our orders. Next, what started off as a simple request to have our 2 drinks remade (old fashioned's that tasted like straight whiskey on the rocks) escalated into the serving getting defensive saying it's impossible for the drinks to be wrong because the bartender is an award-winning mixologist. Great, cool story - I've never had an old fashioned like that (even at Zack's) and, as the customer, was unsatisfied with the output. You'd think a simple, "Sorry you were dissatisfied; what can we do to make it better?" would have resolved it quickly, but NOPE! The mixologist/GM comes out of the restaurant to continue the defense by giving a 3-minute argument on how she straw tested it herself and it has everything an old fashioned should. Finally, after being berated, we told her what we felt they were missing & she remade the drinks... but proceeded to charge us for 3?! The server defended the overcharge saying the mixologist explained the rule to us - FALSE. We were told the drinks couldn't be comped, not that we'd be charged for 4 considering we didn't even drink the 2 we sent back. What kind of restaurant charges for a returned item?! One with absolutely horrible customer service, obviously.The old fashioned cost $16; that's like 1/3 the retail price of a whole Widow Jane 750ml bottle. Don't tell me you guys are losing money on remaking a shot's worth of alcohol.After having a longwinded disagreement with the server, she finally went back to the manager to readjust our bill. Granted, the GM ended up comping our beverages altogether, but not without a nice eye roll as she left the bill on our table. We never believed the other bad service reviews... until now, especially since we got to experience it for ourselves... what a lucky day.TL;DR - food is fine, but don't expect any sort of customer service or professionalism. If you want a pleasant dining experience, go somewhere else.
2021-06-25,1,Used to be my favorite place in all of Hoboken, after tonight that's no more. I've been coming here almost monthly for the past six years, but I don't think I've ever been treated as poorly as I was tonight. The food is great here but after tonight I am contemplating never going back after the way our server Daniele and the night manager/bartender acted.We ordered appetizers and entrees and two old fashions. We received two whiskey on the rocks instead. After waiting around for 20 mins for our server to come back around we very politely asked if there was mix up since these didn't taste like they should. This is when the waitress verbally confronted us that we are making this up and that's there's no way their "award winning" bartender could've messed it up and kept arguing with us. We asked for them to be remade, which we thought that was the end of it. However a few mins later the bartender/manager (Ashleigh?) came over and started fighting with us that there's no way it could've been wrong - again we've had it here 20x+ time before so we simply asked for them to be remade again. We weren't looking for a comp or anything just to fix the drinks.We got our newly made drinks and again we thought this was the end of our saga. Once we asked for the check, it came back with a charge for an extra old fashioned because they "already were being nice and not charging us for four".  mind you we took one sip of the drink before getting them remade. Had to call over the manager again (who is also the bartender), she made us wait 10 minutes and then angrily threw our check on the table saying she comped the drinks and stormed off. Again she completely missed the point - we were looking for good service not a free drink. Stupidly left them a nice tip but I guess that's a small price to pay for a break up - since I'm not coming here again for a while.
2021-06-24,5,Just went here last night for dinner and drinks. Sat outside in the overhang built out on the sidewalk. Service was great, the food was amazing, and the drinks were even better. I tried a draft beer or two and tried this cucumber cocktail (don't remember the name) but was phenomenal.  We got the Kung Pao Cauliflower and Zucchini sticks for apps, and I got the Monroe sandwich and would recommend all three.  I've been here a couple of times now and haven't had a bad experience yet. I would definitely recommend checking this place out!
2021-06-18,5,Great neighborhood place. Food is delicious, drinks are creative and service is good. Came for brunch and had a reservation. I arrived at the same time ~10 other parties arrived. They were understaffed as a waitress showed up late (while we were waiting for the table) so we sat down 15 min after our reservation time, but things happen. After we sat down service was attentive and quick.
2021-06-10,4,Another gem in the Hoboken area. Outdoor dinning is great here. And they have amazing vegetarian options. Go for their arugula salad and penne pasta. You also can't go wrong with their blackberry margaritas.
2021-05-31,4,Tried this restaurant/bar on a whim over the weekend. Tried the filet mignon tacos and honey hoboken sandwich. Must say- the filet mignon was cooked to perfection and the chicken sandwich also hit the spot. We also tried the cucumber watermelon cocktail and learned I don't have a taste for cucumber drinks. While it wasn't my taste, I won't hold it against them. Service was quick. Wait staff could have been friendlier. Definitely interested in trying their brunch. 4.5/5
2021-05-24,3,Went to this restaurant very excited for brunch. Reservation was 2:30pm we were promptly told that there is a 90 minute limit. When we sat down we ordered drinks right away which did not come for about 25-30mins. The waitress also didn't take our food order for over 30 minutes after we sat. After ordering and waiting for another 30 minutes a staff member came out to say that the one member of our party wasn't allowed to get her order because it was after the brunch timing. This was extremely disappointing. Service was overall very slow food was very good though. We were there for over 2 hours (all our entrees were salads). Would like to give it another try to see if it was just an off day.
2021-05-16,4,Gets pretty busy on the weekend. Couldn't find a table a day before but I called and got a table for us. A must try is their baked eggs which has artichokes and marinara base. Yummy! Don't miss their mimosas.
2021-05-16,2,Ugh we love this place but usually come during the week. We came for the first time on a Sunday for brunch and had a pretty tough experience. Seated at the end of the corner and felt a little forgotten about ... took almost a half hour for water and drinks. Our food order was all messed up. The manager was nice enough to stop by but overall not our best Zacks experience. Seemed a little swamped on the weekend
2021-05-12,1,Iam a black woman and i felt super uncomfortable here so uncomfortable that I couldn't eat I had to cancel my reservations they made me feel not welcomed. If I could give a zero star I would I felt so uncomfortable my friends and I decided we will take our business elsewhere
2021-05-11,4,Great brunch menu. The crab cake Benedict was delicious. Go for the food drink snd atmosphere
2021-05-11,4,Went for Monday dinner since we were in Hoboken. Really great atmosphere, relatively reasonable price, and great food. Loved their truffle fries and sweet potato fries! Also my lobster sandwich was really good. My fiance had their famous beef brisket burger and really liked it. Our waiter recommended a fruity cocktail to me and it ended up tasting like cough syrup. It looks like they have good drinks I just got very unlucky. Would still love to come back here!
2021-05-07,4,Decent date night spot. Good ambiance and cocktails. I don't think the tables inside are socially distanced so if that bugs you than I'd make a reservation outside. Staff not as friendly but not rude either. Food is good, pork chop and steak were cooked properly which is hard to come by.
2021-04-25,5,Very pleasant dining experience. Nice outdoor seating area and available indoor dining. The menu has a large variety of options. The tempura shrimp sandwich, Hoboken sandwich, and Classic Burger were all quite enjoyable. Each one came with fries, which are delicious. The service is fast, pleasant, and helpful. Great experience.
2021-04-21,4,It was a lovely night when we visited. The tables were spaced out nicely and there was a short wait with our reservation. Staff was friendly and wore masks. The IPA, burrata, gnocchi, and short ribs were delicious. Can't wait to try other items and cocktails. We will be back :)
2021-04-11,1,An absolute NEVER AGAIN for me...My bf went to the ER at Hoboken Uni Medical, so while he received medical treatment I waited in our car--as I was prepared to do--and eventually got hungry. I checked Yelp for places in the area I could walk to and found Zack's. It was literally around the block from where I parked on Clinton and the ratings looked good.I was craving calamari, and they had it. So I was happy about that! I walked over and the rest looked nice. I walked in and the ambiance looked nice. And then I was met with the lackluster/ indifferent attitude of the staff. There was nothing welcoming about them just a demeanor like I was bothering them. I placed my order for calamari + salad and was told it would be a few minutes. I waited outside on the patio, so as not stand awkwardly at the bar and maintain a social distance. It was pretty chilly that night, but I figured it would be a quick wait because calamari does not take long to cook and the salad I ordered would take even less time. 10 minutes pass. I go to check and it's not done. I made a point to tell them I was on the patio just in case. So I'm sitting there on the patio still waiting... Waiters are walking by and I believe one of the managers and no one even bothers to offer me water or to order a drink while I wait. I found this to be rude, but it was on par with the staff. So finally I decide to check again after another 10 minutes and one of the women says she's going to check. I go back outside and a few moments later she comes out hands me my order, apologizes for the wait, and tells me it was sitting in the kitchen them proceeds to walk away. I immediately stopped her, because she didn't even know that I hadn't been charged yet. I take my food and literally walk around the corner to my car where I am thoroughly disgusted (but starving at this point and out of walkable options because places had closed for the evening) when I open my food. Take a look at the videos of this raggedy plate of calamari I was served...This is just beyond unacceptable. I would've went back and asked for a refund, but again there weren't other restaurants in walking distance that was open at this point. So I ate this horrible food, the mediocre salad and all. Thankfully I asked for lemons because I doused the bland cold (at this point) calamari in lemon juice just to make it more tolerable.
2021-04-04,3,Came here for brunch and got the baked eggs. The dish was good, but it was just a tad simple. The sauce could have used a little more seasoning. There was also a lot of big chunks of artichokes. I wasn't a fan of the dish I got but overall the food looks good and i'll probably come back at some point to check out their dinner menu.
2021-04-04,4,Came here for a Sunday brunch around 10am and it wasn't too crowded and I was easily able to make a reservation. This spot is right on 3rd and Willow, so not too far from downtown but still away from all the noise. The coffee was just okay, wasn't too memorable. I had the baked eggs for brunch and I thought it was pretty good! It has spinach, artichokes, marinara sauce, burrata and eggs over easy. It also came with a side of parmesan toast. Overall, I'm happy with my experience here.
2021-03-25,4,Some appetizers for dinner are okay but I've gone here for brunch twice and was super impressed both times, especially with the fried chicken sandwich. I prefer the sauce on the side, though. Nice atmosphere and great patio seating.
2021-03-23,1,We had a rather disappointing experience at Zack's. Once we were seated, we realized that there wasn't any real ambiance - the music genre changed every few songs, leftover Christmas decorations were hanging over the bar. The chairs are very outdated and rocked around uncomfortably. We received dirty silverware (I'm assuming that they aren't paying attention to that when wrapping silverware in napkins). The food was mediocre at best. Zack's always looked like a lovely dinner place whenever we walked by, which made our experience even more disappointing. I hope the management will undergo some serious quality checks, so other customers don't have the same experience.
2021-03-22,5,Went there 2 weeks ago with my family. We had a reservation how ever there was a little wait... no big deal. Our server was very nice. We had crab cake, calamari and cauliflower for appetizer. I had salmon for main course. Food was really good. I like that the place is not too loud so we could hear each other and enjoy :).
2021-03-09,4,Pretty decent place....nice vibe and good food...had a lamb special which I recommend if they offer It...they also offer pretty good cocktails
2021-03-06,5,Brunch at Zack's was delicious. Food came out fast and HOT and brunch cocktails were amazing
2021-02-28,5,Dined at Zack's for the second time last Saturday for brunch. I made a reservation here because I liked the outdoor dining setup for COVID safety. Even in the 37 degree weather, we were comfortable with the heater setup. It had rained that morning and the tables and chairs were wet when we arrived. No one was sitting outside so I was originally worried that we wouldn't be able to sit outside. However the hostess said it was no problem and she promptly went outside with a roll of paper towels and tirelessly wiped every drop of water from the tables and chairs for us. As for the food, I ordered the eggs benedict. Eggs were cooked perfectly and weren't too runny. The Canadian bacon was pretty standard and my only issue with the meal was that the English muffin was not toasted enough and so it was a bit chewy, and hard to cut with a knife. The homefries served on the side were a mix of sweet potato and russet. The sweet potatoes were super good. The peach Bellini was delicious too!Overall, this is a solid brunch/lunch spot. Definitely check it out!
2021-02-22,4,Made reservations for Valentines Day (inside initially, will explain..). Arrived to a very warm welcome from the staff and were seated in the main dining room; here's where the issue was. Although very beautiful wine nicely setup, the tables were on top of each other (maybe 3ft away and that's generous). My girlfriend and I felt uncomfortable and noticed that there were high top tables across from the bar that were separated by plexiglass and safely spaced out. Upon asking we were informed that area was specifically reserved and fully booked, so we requested to eat outside. The staff were very helpful in assisting us with the heated seating area outside and we felt much more comfortable. Now to the best part of the experience- food!Pros: Flavor of chicken Empanadas were awesome. Truffle fries were warm and wonderfully truffled/parmed (yes these are adjectives now :). Stuffed chicken had asparagus which was a nice texture and the sauce was wonderful. Filet was perfectly cooked and the lobster was only slightly over cooked but tasted great. Chocolate cake was warm and decadent with a nice contrast with ice cream and fresh mint. Cons: Chicken empanadas arrived cold in the middle. Stuffed chicken desperately needed cheese stuffed inside with the asparagus. Filet could of arrived warmer.Overall a great meal, just hope they are more mindful in the main dining room to help customers feel more safe eating indoors, as the food is wonderful!
2021-02-20,3,Had to wait 10 minutes past our reservation time. Dark atmosphere with upbeat clubby music- interesting vibe for a dinner. Creative and strong cocktails. Food came out lukewarm. They have plenty of options to choose from. Staff is friendly. It's a small place, but they have partitions put up between tables in the bar area. No distancing in the dining room area though.
2021-02-14,4,I give Zack's Oak Bar & Restaurant 4 stars. I dined at  Zack's on January 22nd. The appetizers were the highlight of the dinner. The short rib spring rolls were one of the best items I've had at a restaurant in quite some time. They were absolutely delicious and are a perfect reason to return. The calamari was good, but it was a little dry and I have certainly had better at many other restaurants. I thought they had a good drink selection and the staff was always checking in to see if we needed refills on anything. I had the brisket burger for my main course. It had good flavor and was cooked to perfection (medium rare). I enjoyed the crispy fries which are always a good companion for a burger. Unfortunately I didn't want to double up and order the short rib ravioli for my main course which I wish I had. The appetizer was so good that I am sure this would have been a phenomenal option as well. Helpful Tip: order the short rib spring rolls no matter what!
2021-02-14,3,January 22, 2021 - Took my boyfriend here to celebrate his birthday and again, and was a little disappointed with the food compared to the previous time I was here. The Short Rib Spring Rolls was great, but the Friend Calamari was dry (I definitely could've done without it if I knew it wasn't going to be as good as the first time I went to Zack's) My Steak & Fries were incredibly dry (well just the steak) and the fries were a little flavorless. Again, not what I remember from my first visit here a few months back & my boyfriend defined his burger as "decent, nothing special." I was really disappointment at the quality of food during this visit, as I've never been disappointed before. But I do give Zack's 3 Stars because I know how good they can be and their customer service was a plus.
2021-02-13,5,As a long time Hoboken resident who lives down the street Zacks is pretty much my go to. In the last few years I feel like Hoboken has really discovered the awesomeness that is Zacks. Delicious, reasonably priced food and drinks. Great servers (and owners!). A little bit of everything on their menu, you really can't go wrong with all the options, brunch in particular is a favorite. My only complaint is as Zacks has become so popular it's hard to decide to go to dinner last minute because it isn't easy to get into on a Saturday night, but I couldn't be happier for the team. IMO Hoboken needs more places like Zacks!
2021-01-26,5,Such a good spot. My boyfriend got the filet mignon tacos which were two big tacos and fries and I got the stuffed chicken because my friend had gotten it the last time we went. The stuffed chicken is so good! I highly recommend it. The app we had chosen were the general tsao cauliflower bites which were BOMB. They have cute little cocktails for about $10-12 bucks which is less expensive than the other places in hobo. I had two cocktails, he had two IPAS one app and two entrees with tip at about $126
2021-01-08,5,The gnocchi was unreal. Heaters and outdoor seating were perfect. Can't wait to go back!!!!
2021-01-01,4,I've been wanting to try Zack's for a while now. My boyfriend and I came here on New Year's Eve and were able to get a indoor table without a reservation.We started with drinks, a Tin Ceiling and Zack's Drink. To eat we shared appetizers: fried calamari, tempura chicken bites and mac and cheese. We ordered another round of drinks, the Fernet Me Not and Willow Smash. The cocktails selection was on the smaller side but had an interesting/unique selection. The drinks were pretty good and decorated nicely.The calamari was nicely breaded and cooked. The breading was not the typically kind. This one was kind of like chicken tender breading. I'm not sure I'm accurately describing it but we really enjoyed it. The tempura chicken bites were what you'd expect. They were good, but nothing mind blowing. My favorite of the three was the mac and cheese. It was so good! The appetizer size could have been enough for a smaller main meal. After 4 drinks and 3 appetizers, we were full. The pricing is great. The servers and our waitress were friendly and attentive. Zack's had beaded necklaces and New Year's Eve headbands and hats for guests to take on the way out. We had a great experience and I'd gladly return to try more of the menu!
2021-01-01,5,Beautiful traditional yet modern cozy restaurant with delicious food and amazing service. Bartender is an artist and will take care of you! The gnocchi is made in house and is the softest most delicate addition to your tongue! Delicious cream sauce. Definitely get the short rib egg rolls! On point. Go! You will be taken care of.
2020-12-27,3,The food was alright but the customer service was lacking. After finding hair in my food and notifying the server, he told me that it wasn't possible because all of the kitchen staff were bald. Instead of listening to a paying customer he instead decided to blow the subject off. The staff was very unprofessional about checking ID's and switching shifts properly and in a polite manner.
2020-12-23,5,Came here on a busy Sunday with a party of 6 and was seated almost immediately. Almost all of us ordered the soup special as an appetizer, which was mushroom soup - absolutely delicious. I would come back solely for the soup alone. Beyond that, our entire group was very pleased with their meals. I ordered the penne vodka, which was super flavorful.
2020-12-20,4,Finally had brunch at Zacks! Was able to easily make a reservation on yelp for outdoors. Our table was in the streetery section with heaters on both sides of the table. They came in handy since it got chilly!  Unfortunately by 1:30 pm they were already sold out of the muffin special for the day so we didn't get a starter. I got the fried chicken & waffle dish. Was really tasty and I loved the kick the syrup had. I paired this with their cinnamon vodka cocktail which was delicious. My friend had a chicken sandwich and said it was very good. Always a good experience at Zack's.
2020-12-19,1,I have been to Zack's multiple times. This time I ordered take out. Today I ordered the Brisket Blend Burger, which was awful. The burger smelled rancid. I took about two bites and I had to throw it out. For 18$ I would expect so much more. Really disappointed and wish I had this meal in the restaurant so I could receive some type of compensation for the meal.
2020-12-13,5,So I want to start by saying I've had three wonderful experiences here. Two of them for brunch and one for dinner. I can't express enough how amazing the staff is here. They are super attentive, extremely nice, and very quick with service. For some reason I haven't taken photos, usually because I'm way to excited to dig in! Mac and cheese is a must have! French onion soup is delicious, as well as the Monroe and Hoboken sandwiches. I've also had the burger which was cooked perfectly. They do have a great selection of draft beer S well! Keep up the great work guys, we will surely be back!
2020-12-10,5,Delicious food and great staff. My faves are Peach Vibes, cauliflower app and the spinach and baby Kale salad with blackened chicken. They have something for everyone on their menu! My 2yo nephew loves their Mac and cheese!
2020-12-01,5,Great food great vibe. Simple but also elegant. Great mellow lighting a long with great seating tables.
2020-11-24,5,I highly recommend Zack's for brunch in Hoboken! We went for my friends birthday and their service + food was great. The penne vodka and Mac & cheese were to die for! The fries were a great snack & the drinks all tasted great. Some drinks were deff strong, but not an issue!
2020-11-17,1,An employee tested positive & they did not shut down the restaurant. Unsanitary. Do not eat there.
2020-11-09,5,We live right around the block and have been meaning to come here for so long. Well worth the wait. We were so impressed by everything this restaurant had to offer. The service was fantastic, upon arrival the owner insisted that we move to a better table and they really made us feel welcomed and comfortable. Food and drinks were amazing and definitely recommend for an all around great experience!
2020-11-01,5,We sat outside for brunch yesterday and it was pretty cold out. The heaters worked well to keep us warm. Service was quick and the food was delicious. There were six of us for Halloween Brunch.We were slightly disappointed that they ran out of pumpkin beer. Also, there is a brunch menu, but there is no deal. Pricing is very reasonable though and the food is really good. My friend had some sort of banana pancakes that she loved, I ordered an omelette with Swiss, mushroom, and feta that was excellent, my other friend had an omelette with bacon. My husband and our friend both had a fried chicken sandwich and our other friend had a shrimp sandwich. Everyone was very satisfied with their meals. We also got drinks. My friend and I had the apple cider Bellini, which we liked a lot. The boys all got PB&J beer that no one was excited about. I will definitely be back tomorrow
2020-10-30,5,Customer service was excellent and the drinks were yummy! If you're looking for a cozy restaurant to take your girlfriend this spot is perfect. The drinks were delicious and the food was tasty!! We can't wait to go back but I'd pass on the calamari app!
2020-10-27,5,Great service and great food/drinks! They did a temperature check for our whole group in order to eat indoors which really made me feel safe and put my mind at ease!
2020-10-27,4,I usually go here whenever I want brunchy type of food. They cook eggs perfectly and their pancakes aren't bad. The only complaint I had about this place is that they had sweet potatoes as home fries. I never order sweet potatoes. I was sad that they didn't ask me or had options to do just normal potato home fries. Other than that, very good.
2020-10-25,5,Zack's is one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken! It  has a pretty diverse menu and they are very consistent with quality of food. I've literally never had a bad meal here - which makes it easy to switch things up without risk of being disappointed. My personal favorites for lunch or dinner include the short rib spring rolls, fish tacos (last time was a bit salty, but still good), portobello sandwich, French onion soup, as well as the pear and avocado salad. They also had a great shrimp bisque as a brunch special a few weeks back that would be great for dinner in my opinion. For brunch I tend to go for the open faced egg, but you MUST get a baked good when you go. They are always super fresh. Other good bites include the empanadas and truffle fries. Penne vodka is decent as well, but if you're a die hard Italian, don't have crazy expectations. If you like cocktails, just note this menu leans towards the sweet side. I wish they didn't take the jalapeño tequila off the list. It was a nice balance if I wasn't in the mood for wine or beer!
2020-10-25,2,I am all for small businesses and restaurants - i love to support them and considering that Zacks is less than two minutes from me, I was so excited to try it for dinner this time (since I moved here about two months ago). However I had an experience that totally turned me off. We were on a walk with my dog and ready to get food so we figured why not go to Zacks. I wanted to check they had availability first before we went home so I went up and asked the hostess. It seemed as if I was bothering them that I wanted to eat there. I said I would eat inside and they tried to bash it saying "We only have high tops inside" and I'm not picky when it comes to seating so I said okay. She then looked me and said "Unfortunately we don't allow dogs inside" and obviously I figured that but again I mentioned to her twice that my boyfriend would be bringing the dog home (like I said we live next door). She said okay and just looked at me. Then the manager kept asking me if I'm going to stand there and wasn't being clear if they were ready to seat me. Usually a restaurant says "Okay you can follow me" or "Right this way". The manager then got snappy with me and started to yell "are you just going to stand there?". I've never been so turned off and didn't want to give business. That is the kind of first impression your going to give??? When I was like "okay ya" (because the whole time her and the hostess are just looking at me and i thought i would have to wait for my boyfriend to come back before being seated) the hostess had to temperature check me ANYWAY. So obviously it wasn't a matter of going in right away. It didn't make sense to me. Ridiculous. I saw someone recently gave a bad review where the manager asked if they were upset with her and I'm pretty sure I was there at the same time because I heard it. That manager does not know how to be hospitable and professional. The rest of the night she was drinking with her buds. Whoever the owner of Zacks is, i would advise the hostess and manager to learn how to accompany people to their table. It was truly rude and the fact that the other table had an issue with her says a lot. You shouldn't scream at someone if they are going to stand there the whole time - it's "you can follow me to your table" The only reason i'm giving 2 stars is because the food is pretty good and our waiter was nice. They should also be trained to know the menu which ours wasn't but i understand. But the first impression through the staff definitely puts a damper on the whole experience. Im not sure I will be back.
2020-10-23,5,Loved this plce! 25% Indoor capacity and It felt super safe! The food was incredible, got the tempura chicken and calamari apps and it was delicious. For main I got the butternut squash pasta, and friends got short rib ravioli, penne vodka (insanely amazing), steak, and fish tacos. Everyone adored their food and we got drinks that were silicosis as well. On the slightly pricier side but for NY, not bad at all. Will definitely suggest to friends and come back whenever I'm near. Loved the food and the vibes and the service
2020-10-22,5,Fantastic cocktails and food! I came for dinner and absolutely loved their salmon dish- it was very nicely cooked with a flavorful herb aioli and delicious sides of spinach and cous cous. Can't wait to go back!
2020-10-17,4,We went to Zack's last weekend for a tasty brunch and was certainly not disappointed. The staff was friendly and helpful (which is great given COVID), the service was speedy, and the food was tasty! Only reason for 4 not 5 stars is because the cutlery smelled a bit off and musky. We started with the Mac and cheese - it was Incredible. 10/10 recommend that you order this! I had the chicken and waffles with the sriracha infused syrup - it was great! The waffle was fluffy and had a nice crunch, the chicken was crispy and tender, the syrup had just the right balance of sweet and spice. My boyfriend had the shrimp tempura sandwich. It was very tasty. It was supposed to come on ciabatta bread but was served on baguette making it more difficult and messy to eat. Overall, solid brunch experience and I would definitely recommend Zack's for brunch! Note on COVID: felt safe the whole time - it was clean, staff wore masks, tables were rather well spaced out
2020-10-15,1,So I made a reservation for this place almost a week before .. I get there and I'm told they had to confirm it ( seriously)  I was there 15 minutes before my reservation time and I was waiting for one other person , so they said I couldn't be seated until everyone was there . I than asked to seat at the bar while I waited and I was told I couldn't seat at the bar either cause all parties needed to be present . SERIOUSLY ?! Everywhere else you can seat at the bar and have a drink while you wait . But NOPE ..NOT HERE ...  they couldn't seat me because I was missing one other person ( not to mention there was no one inside . But they say 2 people for a party of 4 outside .. please explain that one , I thought everyone needed to be present before they were seated . Than by the time I was seated I already been there for 20 minutes and right before we went in she needed to go check if my table was ready .. seriously ?? I've been here for 20 minutes and now you gotta check the table ? So we go in and there is absolutely NO ONE inside so that means there were plenty of tables ready. After about 15 minutes or so the manager came to our table and explained I couldn't sit at the bar because there was a party there , (ANOTHER LIE) cause when I walked passed the entrance I could clearly see there was NO ONE at the bar . Than she asked me if there was anything she could do to make it better because I looked upset .. well at that point was a bit to late for that . Food was ok but nothing so amazing .They could offer me free food and I wouldn't go back , the service was simply terrible , their excuse was restrictions due to Covid .. haha such bullshit since I've been to so many other places with restrictions but none as ridiculous as these . These people will certainly never see me again .. don't waste your time going there ...
2020-10-10,5,This review is long overdue. Im not from Hoboken but I first went to Zack's almost 3 years ago on a first date. Very small, cozy, hip bar. Food and cocktails were great. Cool music, not too loud. Went back there last year and my then boyfriend promosed to me right outside Zack's.  Truly a memorable place for us.
2020-10-08,5,The food and drinks were amazing. My friends and I had a great time. We just walked in and didn't make reservations so they only had outdoor seating for us which we didn't mind at all. We ordered the braised beef, stuffed chicken and the New York strip. All were cooked perfectly. My drink was Serendipity and I just had to get two glasses of it haha. Looking forward to going back.
2020-10-03,5,We had a great time. Our server was amazing and the food fresh and delicious! Will def come back!
2020-09-27,5,Great restaurant in the midtown area of Hoboken. All the dishes are amazing. Cocktails are great and reasonably priced. Penne Vodka is one of their most loved dish!
2020-09-25,4,Good and awesome service. We came in without reservation on Wednesday night and got seated within 10 mins on a high top table outside. The cocktails are great here. We had zacks special cocktail and the peach cocktail that was vodka based. We split a salad to start and got ribs and lobster raviolis for main dishes. I highly recommend the ribs it was delicious. The raviolis were just ok. Great vibe around this place. Will definitely come back to try other cocktails!!
2020-09-24,4,As a self proclaimed Hoboken brunch aficionado, I was surprised that I never tried Zack's before given the large selection of menu items and cocktails. This is a great spot since it's off the beaten path (Washington street) and there's plenty of space for outdoor seating on a nice day. My friends and I all ordered the Willow punch and it one was of the best cocktails I've ever had. Not too sweet, not too strong, just right. I opted for the BEC burger because I'm a sucker for a burger and fried egg combo. Nothing screams brunch more than some kind of egg sandwich. It was really tasty and I loved the fries - that's saying something for someone that usually doesn't really eat them. All in all, Zack's launched itself to the top of my Hoboken brunch list and I'm definitely not sad about it.
2020-09-20,4,Came by here with some friends for a late brunch, super cute spot. We didn't have any drinks this time around but they had a nice selection choices. I had Zacks Baked Eggs which were were so delicious!! I loved the spicy sauce and toast it came with. My friends really enjoyed their meals as well. Service was friendly/attentive. I wish there were some more vegetarian options on the menu but overall a nice spot. Definitely looking forward to visiting again.
2020-09-09,4,4.5-starsI have been to Zack's several times since my previous review from 2018, and each time provided excellent food and drinks.  My recent visit was no different.  Thankfully, we were able to secure one of their last tables without having a reservation.  Our server greeted us soon after we sat in order to take our beverage order.  I simply love their ever-changing, seasonal cocktails and ordered their Peach Vibes, a blend of mezcal, passionfruit liqueur, coconut agave, peach nectar, and fresh lime juice.  The drink was my dream, infusing all of my favorite flavors - the smoky mezcal, sour passionfruit, summery coconut, and sweet peach.  It was fabulous!  In addition to the cocktail, we shared an order of the Short Rib Spring Roll appetizer, which included 4 bite-sized fried rolls filled with tender, flavorful beef and shredded cabbage.  They were served with a five-spice dipping sauce, which really added an Asian flare to the starter course.  For my entree, I selected the Salmon, which had been pan-seared to perfection.  The fish was just slightly cooked through, and its top had been sprinkled with salt and pepper.  In addition, a fresh herb aioli was ever so slightly drizzled over the well-seasoned salmon.  Initially, I had been worried about how much aioli would be used, as I had forgotten to request it served on the side, but the chef used just the ideal hint.  The fish was accompanied by sautéed spinach and vegetable cous cous, both of which were delicious!Zack's bar and dining areas are always packed with a local crowd, and its well-executed cuisine is proof of why it is such a neighborhood hot spot.  However, its excellence should encourage others from outside of the area to give it a try!
2020-09-05,5,Awesome service and such a nice spot for a lunch date. Highly recommend. Had the chicken and waffles and their new more mosa.
2020-09-05,5,Zacks is hands down my favorite restaurant in Hoboken!  Consistently good food, drinks, and service.  Their dinner specials are often my go to  but the regular menu is full of great options too (highly recommend he braised short ribs!). In addition to the food they are always coming up with creative and delicious cocktails to try. This was our first stop now that indoor dining is open and they did a really great  job with everything and we felt totally comfortable. Check out zacks - you won't be disappointed!
2020-09-04,5,Zack's is one of the best restaurants in Hoboken. It has the perfect ambiance, highest quality food and excellent service. I've been here several times, and I've never been disappointed!Our group of 5 had a reservation tonight. Connor was taking care of us and truly made the experience perfect. Our group is known for ordering a lot of food/drinks/complicated orders, and he was extremely friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and kind. He made amazing recommendations for drinks and entrees, and our table absolutely loved him and his kind spirit. Side note - we really need more people like Connor in the world. As for food, every single thing was amazing. The penne vodka never disappoints, and my friend said the chicken sandwich was the best he's ever had. The menu had a mix of American/Italian dishes - all of them are perfectly executed and well portioned. I highly recommend Zack's! Can't wait to go back.
2020-09-04,5,Zack's as always is amazing!  Easily one of the best  dining experiences in Hoboken.  The food is amazing, and the specials are continually rotating.  The cocktails are also outstanding (Ask for Steve's Cocktail!)
2020-09-01,5,Really enjoyed this place! My first time coming here and it did not disappoint. They have a ton of outdoor seating on both corners of the restaurant and out front. The wait staff was super sweet and the tables were well distanced.We got two cocktails an old fashioned and the 232 gin drink (forget the exact name) that were both delicious!For dinner we got the grilled mahi mahi and shrimp special it was amazing and so fresh & the braised short rib was to die for - a must get.
2020-08-12,5,Always heard good things about Zack's brunch and they certainly met my expectations! My fiancé and I came recently for brunch- he got a brisket burger (so good!) and I got the blackened chicken sandwich with mozz and arugula (was a special for that day). Plenty of outdoor seating. Friendly staff. Definitely a repeat spot!
2020-07-20,5,Absolutely loved my recent experience at Zack's. Arrived on a Sunday evening, without a reservation and was sat outside immediately. All the employees were wearing masks and I felt very comfortable through the whole meal. The food tasted fresh and delicious. I am looking forward to going there again - the zucchini sticks were to die for!
2020-07-16,5,Came here for dinner and cannot say enough about how great the food, drinks, and service was. Definitely my new go-to restaurant in Hoboken. Everything we had was delicious!
2020-07-14,5,My son recently moved to Hoboken and we actually met the owner outside when he was setting up the outdoor area because of the corona virus a month or so ago. We got to eat lunch there outside today and it was awesome!  They set up some nice tables outside and the service and the food couldn't be better!  Lunch was delicious and we will be sure to go back soon to try their dinner menu.  What a fantastic restaurant in Hoboken.  My only hope is that Gov. Murphy gives the okay for indoor dining soon so Zack's can continue serving the community with great food and drink! Great service as well.
2020-07-12,5,One of the best dining experiences I've had in Hoboken. Great service, great ambiance and excellent food and drinks. Definitely will be back!
2020-07-11,5,Great restaurant. This is my bfs and I go to. Never have had a bad meal here. The Hoboken is amazing and so is the steak salad.
2020-07-06,5,I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!! The food is always amazing, the atmosphere is perfect and the staff are always friendly and attentive. Going to Zacks is the only reason to go to Hoboken! Will definitely be back!
2020-06-19,5,Amazing! Lemon ricotta pancakes are a MUST! If you can, sit outdoors on a nice day and go for brunch.
2020-05-23,5,This place has been fantastic every time I've come! Their brunch menu is especially fabulous and the service is good. The last time I came here I got the baked eggs and can't wait to get it again!
2020-04-18,5,One of the biggest highlights of living in Hoboken for 4 years was going to this place! The food is amazing, the staff is always great and they have an amazing ambiance. Compared to most of the other restaurants in Hoboken, this place feels like a class-act yet isn't uptight. They have a wide selection of food options and their drink menu is creative as well. My favorite place to bring visitors and a great location hidden from the messy, Washington street crowd.
2020-03-16,4,We enjoy Zack's for brunch, lunch, and dinner. It's truly a great restaurant for any meal. Their burger is particularly good. I'd definitely recommend checking them out for a meal &/or drinks any time of day.
2020-03-08,4,Coming here for brunch with no reservations? EXPECT TO WAIT ! Thankfully we made some (LOL) Wow was this place crowded & now I know why. Food was sooooo good & came out fast. Giving 4 stars for just a two reasons, friends & I shared the Mac & cheese-food was still in the plate & bus boy wanted to take it away! Uhh, no! (MAC & cheese was good). Finished my drink & no one asked if I wanted another one or even refilled our water glasses. Waiter came by 30 sec after our food was handed to us & asked if everything was fine. Can we taste our food first ? I hate when they do that ! My sweet potato home fries were a surprise but delicious & my egg was perfect. Will come by again if I'm ever in Hoboken.
2020-02-28,5,Such a great neighborhood spot. I've come here a few times with friends and family and the variety of the menu is just as amazing as each piece of food I've tasted from it. HIGHLY recommend the mac & cheese as well as the short rib-- of course you probably can't go wrong if you choose something else. I can't wait to eat here again.
2020-02-09,5,Zack's is great if you want to go out for dinner and drinks and feel like you had a fun night out without having to be in a club. First off, they have great espresso martinis. The branzino dish was also really great! Everything I've had here has been enjoyable and I look forward to going back.
2020-01-31,5,Called for  a reservation but ended up arriving super early! They were very accommodating. Dinner was delicious (mushroom/short rib ravioli) and the hot brownie desert was a treat! By the time we  left at the place was bustling!!
2020-01-31,2,Enjoyed my dinner but when I asked if I I can come in with a group of  20, on a Thursday night, I was told they wouldn't be able to accommodate. I've been in business for a long time and NO just doesn't work for me. I've always made things work above my means. That's how my business has grown. Guess the owners are absent and don't  care anymore.
2020-01-31,3,Not a bad dinner spot for a weeknight in Hoboken. Food was ok, menu was a little odd- I've never seen a bar list mozzarella sticks as a "special" menu item before.We kept the meal safe, the tacos were ok, but cod was in huge chunks and impossible to eat.It becomes packed after 6pm so hustle  out of work
2020-01-12,4,Brazino was cooked to perfection, skin was nice and crispy, and the meat was moist and tender. The wild mushroom risotto was delicious. Asparagus stuffed chicken was fantastic! Chicken was super flavorful and tender. On the other hand, bacon brussel sprouts is a no no for me. There were no bacon flavor and brussel sprouts were mushy. Over all, the entrees were fantastic and I recommend. Services was lacking. Waiters weren't that attentive. But food made up for it. They also have tv so if you want to catch a game and grab dinner, this is the spot.
2020-01-05,5,My friends and I always refer to zack's as the perfect date spot. It just has everything you'd want from easy sandwiches and wrap to delicious entrees. I've been here just for drinks at the bar and also for lunch/dinner. I'd recommend this place 10/10
2020-01-04,4,Food was really delicious and good portion for the price. The fries were seasoned really well and they were crispy which I love. Turkey burger was good, no complaints. Had a tomato jelly that was pretty great. Went here for lunch and it can get moderately busy, was happy I got there before the rush started.
2019-12-28,5,The absolute best fried chicken sandwhich i have ever had!!! Which is saying a lot, being from the Carolinas. The aesthetic of this place is super neat, and everything I've tried there was delicious. Great place to go with your family or friends visiting in town.
2019-12-24,5,Went here with a friend on a Friday night and the wait was definitely worth it! The drinks are good, the food is good, and it has a nice cozy environment. The only thing I would recommend is to make a reservation if possible since it's a small place and it gets packed pretty quickly.
2019-12-21,1,Unfortunately, I've had two different issues at Zack's that I feel should be brought to attention. I went there a few months ago and ordered the Huevos Ranchero's. The menu does NOT specify that this order contains guacamole, while all of their other brunch other items do specify items that contain guacamole. I have an allergy to avocado - not deadly, but strong enough to make me tell abt and all servers about it when I order menu items that contain it. My order came out with 3 pieces of avocado on top. Needless to say, I sent it back with the nice food runner. Our waitress came back, with an inappropriate attitude, and immediately claimed "you never told me" rather then apologizing for the lack of mentioning avocado on the menu- she then rolled her eyes, looked at the menu, and realized her mistake. I felt unwelcome and upset at the lack of apology from our waitress - she was confrontational and rude as opposed to apologetic and remorseful for the lack of detail that the menu provides. No special treatment and/or rectification was provided by the owner as well. I looked past all of this and returned a few months later with another group of friends. Again, ordered the Huevos Racheros and was sure to specify 'no avocado' (the menu has YET to be changed to reflect that avocado is included). The menu specifies "fried eggs" as part of the Huevos. I confirmed with my waitress that 2 eggs would be provided, and she confirmed this and my meal was delivered perfectly - no avocado and two eggs. The check comes with a $3 charge for an egg. The waitress explained that the Huevos usually comes with one egg, but she took the liberty of adding an egg to my order since I mentioned it earlier. Although she was SO nice and a great waitress, we fought this charge, as the menu specifies fried eggS and being charged for an extra seems silly based on the description. The charge was removed. This issue alone wouldn't have sparked my review, but combined with the avocado incident, I felt compelled to write my experience and share with other diners as well as management, since they never approached me and rectified the situation. My friends who live in Hoboken absolutely love Zack's and I know the food is quality and well- respected; however, it's necessary they know their shortcomings in terms of menu descriptions and wait-staff attitude in order to continue achieving greatness.
2019-12-14,5,Great Bloody Marys. Great place for Brunch!!!!
2019-11-30,5,this place is so cute! the atmosphere is very nice. i had fries and they were very good! you get alot too. i also had the Burrata which had tomato, arugula, balsamic reduction, country bread. very good! i would order these things again. and the prices was very reasonable for everything. friendly staff.
2019-11-29,2,Food was overpriced and not very good.  I ordered a hamburger and asked for it to be cooked medium.  After a very long wait (not a busy time), it came out extremely undercooked.  I had to send it back.  It then came out well done and that aside, it was not a good burger.  My girlfriend had a veggie burger that wasn't very tasty.  I'd chalk it up as no big deal if it weren't for the price associated with the sub-par food.
2019-11-27,5,It did not disappoint! Hoboken sandwich is amazing. Very fresh. Seemed like many other people around me were also getting it. Thyme cocktail is also amazing, definitely on the sweeter side. Burrata was good but could have used more balsamic in my opinion.
2019-11-25,2,I came by here randomly on a Tuesday for dinner. I have been wanting to come here for quite some time, since I live in Weehawken. When I got in, it was not busy, so I grabbed a seat at the bar. Bartender was ok, she didnt give much insight about the menu. I ended up going with the tenders, truffle fries, and the mezcal cocktail named XXX. I would have definitely spent $38 somewhere else with better food. Service was good, but the food was just not worth it. Tenders- 3 huge fried pieces of chicken breastFries- were not hot, cheese was not melted
2019-11-23,3,Great drinks. Great ambience. Fantastic service.Go for the cocktails and order a few!Unfortunately, the food leaves a bit to be desired. For the price I expected more, but in the end it was overpriced Applebee's food.
2019-11-03,4,Zacks is very good! I've tried their french toast, open faced eggs, and cappuccinos and I have to say they are excellent. The service is great and so too is the ambiance. I have gone a few times and will continue to go as long as they keep up their food quality and great selection.
2019-10-27,5,Love the food and the vibe! Staff was friendly but not in an annoying way (lol). The menu has a lot of fun twists on basic food. I'm very picky and still had many options. Went for lunch so didn't have the chance to drink yet but will definitely be back.
2019-10-25,3,Came here for an early lunch, 11:30ish on a Friday. I ordered a Mediterranean salad with hard boiled egg (they offer egg on their Cobb salad so I knew it was available). Husband ordered their steak salad, med rare. It was roughly 20 min before we got our food- a ridiculous amount of time considering we were the only people in the restaurant. My $11 salad was essentially a plate of spinach with exactly 3 cherry tomatoes, 4 slices of cucumber, an egg, and a sprinkling of pizza topping style canned sliced black olives. Waiter never checked on us but to clear our plates. Just disappointing.
2019-10-15,5,I've been to Zacks, with my wife, about a dozen times; sometimes meeting friends in Hoboken for dinner and drinks. Zacks has been the "go to" place, even if we haven't eaten there, and each time the service and ambiance of a great neighborhood bar is exceptional. The people there are a mix of all age groups, but primarily it's a younger, well mannered crowd yet it comprises many eclectic groups, including some families with kids on weekend afternoons and early evenings.  Each time, I found the folks who frequent Zacks to be vibrant, cheerful and friendly. You can converse easily with strangers, if you want or if they want, or watch a game unencumbered by disruptions. The service staff is friendly, know how to mix a great drink and never give you the feeling of wanting you to "drink up" and have another, which is nice. Additionally, my wife and I have eaten there and the food is excellent. We've never had a complaint. I wish I lived closer to Hoboken. It reminds me of where I grew up in Brooklyn, NY. The city of Hoboken has a great vibe as does Zacks. I highly recommend it if you're in Hoboken, for any reason.
2019-10-05,4,The lemon ricotta pancakes were AMAZING! So delicious! Fluffly, not too sweet, and the strawberries were a perfect fresh touch! 3 small pancakes though, not your normal huge stack if that's what you're looking for. My waitress however didn't check on me once...until I asked for the check. Woulda been nice to have a coffee refill with my breakfast. Other than that, I would go back for the pancakes. 4/5 stars because of poor service.
2019-10-01,3,The food is ok. Limited menu for dinner. The service was good. Drinks were better, but a bit pricey.
2019-09-30,4,Here's a place I would've never tried my own had colleagues not organized the inevitable team dinner there. I use the term 'team' rather euphemistically since I barely knew anybody in a party of twelve. My company has a satellite office in Hoboken, a city I actually visited with Jamie W. based on a mutual friend's recommendation that the best Cubano could be had at Zafra Kitchen. Not quite (review: bit.ly/2oLru2o) but hey, my only other reference to Hoboken was Bugs Bunny when he tried to take a doe-eyed penguin to the South Pole where upon arrival, he finds out the penguin's from Hoboken."HOBOKEN??!! Ohhhhhh, I'm dying'!!" My favorite Bugs line. Anyway, I wasn't dyin' but more accurately, suffering from my inability to sustain small talk at the dinner table. Luckily my dietary restrictions were accommodated by a flexible menu that highlighted Market Salads. I ordered the $11 Mango Salad, a surprisingly tantalizing mix of arugula, butter lettuce, red onion, cucumber, avocado, mango, and toasted almonds, all of it tossed in a lime vinaigrette. I had them add grilled prawns for an additional $8 because who cares? I wasn't payin' for it. The result was delicious (photo: bit.ly/2oLru2o). If they added carrots, Bugs would've liked it, too.FOOD - 4 stars...nice mix of flavors, savory with a bit of tropical that worked well together AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...popular post-work spotSERVICE - 3.5 stars...nice enough TOTAL - 4 stars...HOBOKEN??!! Ohhhhhh, I'm dying'!!"RELATED - Hangin' out in Joisey? Here's a collection of places I've visited and reviewed: bit.ly/2HnXQqD
2019-09-28,5,I have been living in Hoboken for two years now and can't believe that I haven't been to this place sooner. Me and my friend got Fish tacos and Turkey burger both were delicious and staff was really friendly
2019-09-27,4,The food itself is phenomenal. The chicken finger app is unreal, I feel like they're probably air fried. The brisket burger is also super legit. Mac and cheese, also delectable. Order all of the above. I've also been recommended the steak salad multiple times but have yet to try it. The food took forever the first time I went. Second time, I had a reservation, Thursday evening. We walked in and the hostess said hello, can I help you, I mentioned our reservation and she said "okay just a minute." Well, 13 minutes passed. She forgot about us. Fantastic. She cans up to us and said the exact same thing. I was fuming at this point. She walked away, and seated us 5 minutes later. The open table was there the whole time.Make sure you guys have enough stAff or stAff that has a better memory next time. The server himself was great and attentive.
2019-09-26,3,We went their for lunch but food was average and service was ok. Have had better pasta at other places.
2019-09-25,4,I came here with my husband on a date night and it was amazing. We were there around 8 pm and were seated right away. It was almost fully packed. There was not a lot seating around the bar and the restaurant itself is very small, they have outside seating as well. I have had this place bookmarked since very long and I knew what I am going to order. Mu husband dint take time as well. We ordered stuffed chicken and brisket burger for our entrees. Both of our dishes came after 15-20 mins once we placed the order. For dessert we also had Peanut butter pie, it was the best pie I have ever had. Food - 5/5Stuffed Chicken - it was a huge portion with breaded chicken breast tender/pieces stuffed with asparagus topped with red peppers. The chicken was under creamy mashed potatoes and the sauce. The sauce was delicious and as an entire dish it was perfect. I really enjoyed it.Brisket Burger - my husband ordered this and he was happy with it. The burger came with side of fries and tomato ketchup, the fries were really good, very thin and properly crisp. The burger itself tasted delicious, altogether it was a very good burger.Peanut Butter Pie - I highly recommend this pie in dessert. It was a perfect portion for 2, came with chocolate drizzle on top and whipped cream on side. Nothing was too much on this plate and wasn't very sweet. Restroom - 5/5very clean and very well maintained. Service - 4/5we ordered 3 things and all 3 were served by different person and with long waits, as it was highly packed we did get everything late.Ambiance - 4/5It is a small restaurant and all the tables are very close.Parking - only street parking, very hard to find nearby in peak hours.
2019-09-22,5,First date night with the wife in quite a while and this was the perfect place for that.The bar and restaurant are open but they feel separate so if you want to have drinks and apps you can sit at the bar or if you want a nice quiet(ish) dinner with the family the restaurant seating is very cozy.We ordered a Caesar to split and the spring rolls.  My wife had the steak and I had the filet.I am not sure how to explain it but the food was...subtle?  At first I did not care for the salad and thought it was too dry but every bite sort of built and in the end we were fighting over the last bite.  One of the best salads I've had.Same for the filet.  It was cooked with a wine reduction which I usually expect to be too runny or taste too "winey."  This sauce was thick and again at first I felt it was a little bland but then as I ate more the flavors sort of built.  The sauce did not overpower the taste of the meat or the other way round.  They both complemented each other perfectly.Desert was a peanut butter pie which was good but nothing special (sorry).The wait staff was always available and friendly.  We will definitely be coming here again.
2019-09-15,4,Stopped in again and I have to say, I really like the bloody Mary's here! They make a jalapeño vodka that's yummy and adds heat the the Bloody Mary. I love the olives too. Salty and fresh. The two male bartenders are quick, friendly, and attentive. We also tried the buffalo chicken tonight and it was good. The blue cheese dressing is good here too. Beer or a Bloody Mary is all I would drink here. The food has always been good!
2019-09-15,4,The food was decent but on the pricier side. We split truffle fries and then each ordered an entree and didn't have to wait long for our food. The atmosphere was nice but very noisy, making hard to hear at times. If we sat outside I'm sure that wouldn't have been an issue!
2019-09-15,3,A perfectly average brunch. Friendly, attentive service. Decent drinks. Decent prices.  Food was good, not great. Nothing to rave about but no big complaints, other than the acoustics. When the tables are full the din is deafening and it's difficult to hold a conversation at your table.  It was serviceable. If it were more than that, we probably wouldn't have gone to a different spot for a second drink.  It's okay, but the 4-5 star brunch reviews build up something the overall experience doesn't achieve.
2019-09-04,3,I really wanted to like this place.  But after a pounding headache from a poorly made cocktail, I'm not really sure I'd come back for drinks.  The food was average and the area isn't great for a traveling driver, very limited free parking (you may score a meter).
2019-09-02,5,Came here for brunch on Sunday and it did not disappoint. Always very nice and friendly staff. I especially like the location being in the middle of Hoboken. I ordered the Chilaquiles to try something new. Egg, seasoned chicken, and veggies smothered in a tomatillo sauce on top of chips. It was delicious and filling. The sauce had a nice little kick to it as well. I've been here a few times now and definitely will keep coming back.
2019-08-29,5,Awesome brunch spot! The food was delicious and the service was great as well! The calamari was crispy, the burrata was served on fresh tomato and was very good, the bone less wings were good but not a must have. We also tried the classic cheese burger which was delicious! Would recommend if in the area and are looking for brunch food with a drink!
2019-08-27,4,Really great food and great atmosphere.  Can be really packed at times so try to schedule a reservation or join the waitlist if there is one. Overall a pretty good experience and I would go back again to eat.
2019-08-19,5,I had the fish tacos which has the fish of the day, avocado, corn and a spicy sauce drizzled on top, along with a side salad. It was soooo delicious, even the fries are seasoned to perfection. The outdoor seating is cute and the waitress was very friendly to us. This place is great for birthdays and anniversaries. The dress code is on the classier side.
2019-08-18,3,The customer service was awesome, however, the calamari was terrible. My boyfriend ordered the chicken sandwich, which was good. Besides the calamari, I also ordered the breakfast burrito, which surprisingly had very little flavor. We ordered two drinks which were very beautiful and tasty. I'd try it again but I'd order something different.
2019-08-17,5,Absolute best mac and cheese I have ever eaten in my 25 years of life. Great food, great service, great experience.
2019-08-15,3,Cute atmosphere. So my husband loves this place, especially the crab cake sandwich. The pear salad is really good. 3 stars because there are barely any vegetarian/vegan options. Replace the portobello burger with a real vegan burger! I don't know any vegetarian/vegan who would actually decide to eat a portobello burger.
2019-08-13,5,After a long day of hauling large pieces of furniture and sweating from moving into my new Hoboken apartment, I was so impressed by this amazing restaurant right down the street! Even during "slow" hours the place still has quite a few customers and the wait staff is incredibly friendly and attentive. The oak bar is also very beautiful and well maintained.Everything on the menu sounded delicious but the Mac and cheese sent me over the top, SO GOOD! The honey fried chicken sandwich was crispy and delicious and served with a large pile of fries. Huge plus for me, they also have Kane Head High on tap; one of my favorite NJ beers. I'm excited to try their dinner and brunch menus as well. Definitely going to be a new regular!
2019-08-10,4,Great food! Their truffle fries is delicious! They also have fresh orange juice!
2019-07-30,5,This is one of our favorite spots in Hoboken! The food is always incredible no matter what we order. It's definitely our favorite burger ever. The classic burger is awesome, but omg the brisket blend burger is insanely delicious (and messy)!!! The mac & cheese here is unreal. I don't know how they make it so perfect, but it sure is! Their chicken skewers with couscous are awesome. We've heard great things about the chicken here and it is truly amazing. Cooked to perfection! Lovely outdoor seating area and perfect spot for drinks too!
2019-07-25,5,This was my first time at Zacks for dinner and it was great! It's small but the inside is nice and classy with a bar. I got the mussels and burrata as an app and both were amazing. I highly recommend the mussels the sauce was to die for. As an entree I got the tagliatelle and loved it. The shrimp was perfectly cooked and mixed well with the sauce. The drinks were also perfectly made. Portions were big and service was great. Highly recommend this place for a nice dinner!
2019-07-21,5,Beautiful neighborhood place.  Very pleasant seating outdoors and comfortable seating inside. Lots a greenery and lights outside.  Inside had tin ceiling clean tiled floor and European bistro style seating. The bar section was pub-like but brighter.  This was our first visit although assuredly not our last. Our waitress was friendly enough- she made amazing recommendations. We deviated from our initial choices based on her recommendations.  The brunch item chilliquidia or something like that was not even our radar but my partner got it and after two bites we were plotting our next visit to have it.  I got Zacks bakes eggs. Yumminess!!  The sauce was sooooo good. I was having such a great experience I decided to grab a drink- the peach vibe.  It was excellent. Overall this was a great experience that we will come back for.  Maybe see u there.
2019-07-16,4,Zack's looks like a nice and simple neighborhood bar and restaurant and that's what it is. Nothing unusual or cutting edge or even worth driving a distance for - we were in nearby Jersey City. Zack's is an unpretentious place to dine on the standards.However there are a few negatives about Zack's. When it gets busy it can seem really tight and crowded not to mention the noise levels.Service was slightly rushed and impersonal.Everything we've had has been good. Stuffed chicken was fine, braised short ribs were good and the tagliatelle pasta was good. Fantastic and amazing? Probably not, but good and that's Zack's and that's a lot more than most places.
2019-07-13,5,My favorite restaurant in Hoboken.  Love the Parmesan fries, penne vodka and French onion soup! Always a great go to restaurant in Hoboken!
2019-07-07,4,Pretty good food and atmosphere. Nothing special but overall enjoyable.Food came out very fast too. Typically that's a good thing but in this case the food came out almost too fast, entree was brought out before we were halfway done with the apps.B+, would return.
2019-07-06,4,Great little spot! Food was good, drinks were good. A tad pricey for the amount of food you get, but it won't stop me from coming back!
2019-07-06,5,I have been going to Zack's with my fiancé on a fairly regular basis for the last 2 years and can honestly say this is one of the best spots in Hoboken.  I noticed that a few bad reviews got into Yelp, and think they completely miss the mark. Food:Between the two of us, we have had virtually every dinner entree on the menu, and although we both have our favorites (fish tacos for me, cobb salad for her), everything on the menu is delicious.  Meals are consistently good, time and time again. Service:The service at Zack's is fantastic. The entire staff, from bartenders to waiters and busboys are friendly and pleasant. In our numerous visits, we never have had to wait a long time for our food to come out. Bar:The bar at Zacks (besides being beautiful) is an awesome spot to just sit and relax with a delicious drink. The bar staff consistently product quality drinks that both my fiancé and I enjoy.
2019-07-02,5,Liked the ambience, food and service. I have given 5 stars as everything was just as fine from appetizers to desert.
2019-07-01,1,Food is good , bartender is cool , floor staff is T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E. They treat us like crap.
2019-06-27,2,I like the atmosphere of this place, but the food has been consistently terrible.  The burgers are like burnt little hockey pucks and the crab cake was so over mixed, it must have been in slurry form at some point.  There is no way it can be considered "lump crab cakes."  The prices are very high considering the poor quality.  I may come back to have some drinks because I like the atmosphere, but I've given them many chances with the food and it's never been good.  I won't be eating here again.
2019-06-26,2,I was working in town and had some time for lunch. I stopped in out of nostalgia (we used to come here when we lived in the area) and ordered a Mediterranean salad with salmon. Pros: not crowded at Wednesday lunch, salmon was nicely cooked if under seasoned, spinach salad not overdressed, spinach seemed fresh Cons: the salad was advertised to have cucumber, tomato, olives, red onion and spinach - technically true, but in reality I was served spinach with about 3/4 cup of bland, canned black olives (I would have expected Kalamata or even green olives), two slices of cucumber and three grape tomatoes. There were a few pieces of red onion in the salad, but barely. Now I'm usually more likely to criticize the lack of greens but even for me this was a strange balance of spinach and black olives (odd choice, cheap?) to barely any tomato or cucumber. Passable, if strange, meal, but definitely not worth the price.Service was fine, but on the slow side, which I also don't mind, but I've typed this whole review since finishing my meal and no one has been by.I think if you are visiting the nearby hospital and need to grab some lunch this will be fine, but there are so many better options in Hoboken, I regret not choosing somewhere else.Overall assessment: mediocre, phoned in
2019-06-23,5,Had a great time here saturday night. Bartenders were fast and attentive and the stuffed chicken was phenomenal. Will definitely be back!
2019-06-22,5,I went to Zacks the other day and met Max who was bartending. He gave excellent service, was quick to fill my drink (and keep it full), and made great conversation. I will absolutely be back to visit him. It helps that the food was amazing and came out in a timely manner. I highly recommend!!
2019-06-22,5,One of my favorite new Hoboken spots. First, the food. Great selection of salads sandwiches and entrees. There's really something for everyone here. The Hoboken is my go to sandwich. Spicy chicken. Yes please.Second, the drinks. Great draft and bottles selection for you beer drinkers. Wine lovers, they have you covered too. Great list with a lot of variety. The cocktail list pairs nicely with their menu.If you get a chance, sit at the bar. The service here is outstanding. The bartenders Max and Ashleigh are always on top of everything. I don't think my glass was empty once. Overall great experience and highly recommend!
2019-06-21,2,I normally like this place. You can't beat the atmosphere. But tonight I sat and the bar. I ordered a beer, it came fast, and that was it. After 10 minutes of tying to get service to place an order I decided I should just leave, but I couldn't even pay because, again, the bartender was too busy chatting with his buddies. His poor co-worker was working her butt off pouring drinks, and the dude was just hangin out. At 15 minutes (yes I timed) she told him to take some orders ffs, at which point I blew up at him. She comped my drink and I left. Screw that guy, he needs to go.Edited to add: All O wanted was a burger so I went to O'Niel's 2 blocks away. Not only was my order taken within 2 (2!!) minutes, but that burger was a 10/10.
2019-06-21,5,Came here on the first day of summer!! It was splendid. I've never seen such fast service and good food. Almost right after we sat down the waitress (Amanda) came to collect our drink orders. She was extremely nice and helpful, she recommended food and we took her suggestions. We ordered food and it came within minutes. It was so good. They filled out drinks to the brim which was wonderful. I don't have one single complaint. I would strongly recommend this place.
2019-06-17,1,I'm sorry but this place was really terrible lolI mean...laughable so. My husband and I went on a "food" tour of Hoboken and we chose this place as one of our stops. We ordered a couple cocktails, all underwhelming, and we ordered 5 of the appetizers, I cant even recall which ones because they were ALL pathetic. I hate having to write this but it's so strange this place is rated #2. Honestly going to an Applebees would be a step up. The atmosphere is about the same. Loud, not cute and sort of like a shitty sports bar. We never plan on coming back.
2019-06-14,5,Awesome brunch experience. Firstly, my boyfriend, friend and I came here without making a brunch reservation, and were seated promptly at a great table. It was certainly busy, so I wouldn't risk coming in without a reservation any other time but they were more than accommodating. Our waiter, Joe, was very polite and friendly, even laughing at our jokes and being very patient with our indecisiveness regarding the menu. Also ALL the waiters and waitresses were beautiful people, for real. I ordered the smoked salmon Benedict which was just incredible. It came fairly quickly-- definitely faster than I was expecting with the restaurant as packed as it was. Perfectly sized portion with high quality fish and an excellent flavored sauce. My friend got the avacado Parmesan toast which was on a delicious high quality bread flavored wonderfully. The home fries were also quite good. The ambiance was really perfect. They had great songs playing in the background the whole time. It was busy, but still a nice relaxing brunch experience. Again, Joe and the rest of the waitstaff were very accommodating and helpful, and the food was just wonderful. Definitely a new favorite brunch spot in Hoboken!
2019-06-11,2,DON'T GO HERE IF YOU HAVE FOOD ALLERGIESThe fish in the fish tacos are excellent. However, I confirmed they came with corn tacos because I'm gluten intolerant. They arrived with flour tacos, which I only found out after I took a bite. I pointed it out, and no effort was made to correct this, except for an apology, so I requested a side of fries and ate around the flour tacos. It was late and I was hungry and just wanted the quickest option. They then charged me for the fries, which was annoying after I made it clear that I couldn't eat what they had provided, but completely within their rights to do. However I'm lucky that I don't have celiac disease - an incident like that could put someone in the hospital. Mojitos used mint simple syrup, not fresh mint, and it wasn't minty enough. A request for more mint resulted in a glass of simple syrup gratis, which only made the mojito sweeter, not mintier. Room is high and extremely loud, so loud our waitress had to come back after putting in our order and verify we wanted the steak salad medium or medium well done. She then complained about the noise. Maybe that's why the kitchen screwed up my order. It made the screaming baby at the next table pretty intolerable. The remaining food is good and the ambience is nice once the baby left, but I am spoiled for choice in Hoboken and there are plenty of places that understand how important food allergies are and train their staff accordingly, at the same price point, like Bluestone Lane. I'd rather spend $20 per entree there and not worry about ending up sick in bed for the next 2-3 days.
2019-06-09,4,Definitely a great brunch spot! Very nice ambiance inside and plenty of outdoor seating too. Since it isn't on Washington Ave, it felt less crowded than a lot of the other brunch spots I've tried. Everything we ordered was delicious - especially the BLT Burger (huge portion, plenty of crispy bacon on top..yum) and the Buttermilk Pancakes. My fiancé loved the Steak and Eggs too. The bellinis were great...but it's a bummer that they don't have any discounted drink specials for brunch. Only downside was that our waiter was a little absent. Our food came out quickly but whenever we needed drink refills it was hard to track him down.
2019-06-09,2,Unremarkable. Had the steak sandwich with fries and a Diet Coke. Soda was certainly off brand, fries were fine but nothing special, same with the sandwich. In fact, the sandwich didn't have any real actual flavor, just kind of all blended together. Service also was a little ridiculous. Hostess was distracted (not busy), and there were 4 people making 4 mimosas, inside a rather empty dining room. Poorly managed.
2019-06-08,5,Liked everything about this place! Cocktails are amazing, food is delicious, service is great! Also, they are dog friendly and it's awesome! Had a great dinner with my husband tonight. Definitely will be back!
2019-06-05,1,Yelp photos don't match their menu. The bread and bacon are as​​ hard as rocks. Don't kill yourself and waste the money here.
2019-05-28,5,We went here for Sunday brunch. I had breakfast burrito without the chorizo and my wife had the chilaquiles without the chicken. The food was tasty overall. They have accommodations available for big groups.
2019-05-26,5,Went here for dinner on a Saturday night and was seated immediately. The staff and my waiter were all extremely nice and attentive, probably one of the best dining experiences I've had in a while. I ordered a salad with shrimp which was very good. I would come back to Zack's in a heartbeat. A+ !!
2019-05-24,1,Came here for Mother's Day brunch and ended up at Del Frisco's because the experience was terrible. This was our second time here and I felt like I was in a completely different restaurant the second time around. To begin with, I've never written a review in my entire life. When we arrived, we asked to be seated and the hostess refused to seat us until the entire group was there. That's fine, but given the holiday the restaurant was packed, there was no where for us to stand and I explained would it be possible for us to just sit because the only person we're waiting on is parking the car since it was raining and he dropped us off and we keep being pushed into. She finally brings us to our table and there was a seat missing and we were crammed between the bathroom and the entrance to the kitchen. I very politely asked her for another seat and she snapped at me and was talking about us to the other hostess saying "Well they wanted to sit down SO...." What???? Asking for the missing seat for the other person coming doesn't seem like an unreasonable request.Okay, whatever, over it. Then my mom asks for some coffee and the mug had a LIPSTICK stain on it (NOT hers). Disgusting!!!We all ordered different dishes with eggs. My parents ordered omelettes and the eggs for the omelettes were FAKE eggs. Like why??? On top of that, all of our dishes were supposed to come with home fries meanwhile the "home fries" were COLD, BURNT, and simply uneatable. I am actually not exaggerating when I say black, cold, bits on a plate are not home fries. I am not going to comment on the server. The service was average at best. I was SO disappointed that this was the experience for a Mother's Day brunch. The day honestly would have been completely ruined had it not been for Del Frisco's where we were actually able to eat the food.Never again. Much better places in the area where the hostess won't get worked up so easily, the glasses and cutlery will be CLEAN, and the food will actually be eatable.
2019-05-17,4,First time coming to this place and definitely not the last. The atmosphere is family friendly and inviting , also complemented by a nice modern decor. Hard to find any misses on the menu as well , all the food is great. We had Joseph as our waiter and could not have asked for a smoother evening. Service was fast and attentive , drinks always filled , recommendations were spot on. Only thing preventing this from being a 5 star was the Cobb salad.  It's constructed a bit more like a wedge salad and lacked some other common ingredients. Nonetheless , we had a fantastic evening and will be back again soon.
2019-05-14,5,Zack's is the bomb diggity. Food is fantastic and the drinks are tasty. Just make a reservation because the wait is usually long, brunch is sometimes impossible.
2019-05-13,5,Zacks Oak bar and restaurant in Hoboken is such an adorable place. They have excellent food both for brunch and for dinner. I have come here in groups of two and four, but also with a party of 10 and they were able to seat all of us comfortably. They were very accommodating. I definitely would say that their steak is fantastic, always great soup, you can't go wrong with any of their appetizers. They have an excellent chocolate dessert as well. Most recently I had a salad with grilled chicken and avocado, and I was very satisfied with my meal. I will also note that they have a variety of cocktails that are all quite good, as well as standard wine and beer. 100% a place that I will come back to you again and again. I would recommend making a reservation if possible. It is not that large of a place and it does fill up, but completely worth it!
2019-05-12,3,Tried crab cake burger. It was ok. The buns they use for the burger look and taste like cheap buns you can buy from walmart, and the burger was too salty. I liked the atmosphere though!
2019-05-11,2,Two stars because the food was bleh and the service was terrible. With very few people inside, somehow it took a VERY long time for food to come out and for waiters to check in. Entering the restaurant, we were shoved aside by a waiter coming through the door. Eggs Benedict came out lukewarm and hollandaise was flavorless. Disappointed overall for such a cute spot, but maybe it was just an off day.
2019-05-02,5,I came for a girls night with my old roommate and it was amazing! We both got the spritzers and were pleasantly surprised by how good it was (we've had a lot of mixed drink disappointments recently). The food breakdown:-Short rib spring rolls-incredible, but way smaller than anticipated-Gnocchi-SO GOOD, soft and pillowy. The sauce was incredible and the bits of cheese on top just perfect-Stuffed chicken-also amazing, we were a bit hesitant to get it but it was so worth it-Banana pudding-only ok. It was pretty solid but tasted more like something I could myself, and came out suspiciously fast. Still giving this place 5 stars and we will definitely be adding it to the Hoboken rotation.
2019-04-25,5,One of my favorite spots in Hoboken! Best burger, great chicken sandwich, and the stuffed chicken is BOMB.
2019-04-21,5,Brought our pup for brunch to sit outside and Joe the server immediately brought water for all of us. Highly recommend coming here for the environment, staff, drinks and food.
2019-04-19,4,A casual neighborhood eatery with a friendly atmosphere. Our waitress was very attentive and actually seemed like she likes working here. LolFor the appetizer we had the short rib spring rolls (an absolute must try!) and crab cakes. Entrees the salmon and the short rib ravioli. Both delicious. And for dessert please try the peanut butter pie. It's rich and creamy and a perfect portion to share.Speaking of portions, all of the dishes are large enough to share. All in all, enjoyed this restaurant and as a newbie to Hoboken I'll be coming back again.
2019-04-13,5,Amazing atmosphere and service. The short ribs spring rolls are amazing. They are small and only have 4 so you may want to have 2 orders if it's more than one person. The drinks were good and they weren't watered down. They play music which makes it feel very social. I only experienced the place in the day time and plan to come back at night to see the vibe. They also have outdoor seating for those nice days.
2019-04-09,4,First time here, decided to ear at the bar.  Very friendly staff.  Bartender was friendly & attentive.  The food came out fast and fresh, don't order all at once so you can time it.  I had the stuffed chicken, fabulous!  The arugula salad was simple, but perfectly light.  Calamari was good as well.  Very happy to recommend, good atmosphere.
2019-04-05,5,Great food! Drinks are amazing but can be pricey. I think it is one of those places that is WORTH the price! Amazing. I have been for brunch and I have been for dinner- both were great! The place gets busy so you should 100% make a reservation.
2019-04-05,5,Incredible place and it's the #1 restaurant in Hoboken. If you're looking for a quick drink, the bar is great. If you're looking for a nice dinner, this is the place!
2019-04-03,4,Came here for brunch on a Saturday afternoon and definitely recommend for anyone looking for a cute, hip spot. I ordered the mac and cheese which was cooked very well & made with all the right cheese - def recommend for those looking for a lunch-y option within the brunch menu. My friend ordered the buttermilk pancakes with brown butter, caramel & apples - she loved this option and if you have a sweet tooth dive into this dish. In addition, i had a moscow mule which was actually done very well. I've had some bad moscow mules, so it was appreciated to have it done right.I didnt give it a full 5 stars cus i felt the waiter was basically pushing us out the door after we ate our dishes. We still had drinks at hand... But other than that, I recommend.
2019-03-20,4,Consistent.  It's so key and for the dozen or so times I've been to Zacks it's been good.  I like that i went on a Saturday around 3pm and wasn't forced to choose between pancakes and eggs.  I know Hoboken is such a brunch place, but after 1pm I'd like a lunch selection and zacks offered salads, sandwiches, burgers etc.  service was great and so was the food.
2019-03-12,4,Though not spectacular, the items we tried at Zack's exceeded my expectations for brunch at a bar. The hot chocolate was extra creamy & decadent. It was a minor issue that his (NY strip) Steak & Eggs were a touch overcooked because the flavor was satisfactory. Home fries had a few sweet potato pieces thrown in. My Baked Eggs came with two pieces of parmesan toast to sop up the spicy tomato sauce. Underneath the sauce, the remaining ingredients were arranged in sections -- stretchy burrata, tender artichokes, by the time I got to the spinach at the other end, I was too full to eat my greens! Our bill was under $40. A nice way to spend a Saturday morning. Zack's is a cozy American bar with ornate ceiling details & beautiful floors that make you wonder if they're original to the building.
2019-03-09,4,Excellent brunch location, great food with lots of flavor and very good sauces. Had a Bloody Mary and it was perfect not too heavy and not too light. Had items off the Brunch menu and highly recommend trying the Zacks baked eggs or the Chilaquiles both were exceptional.
2019-03-02,3,This is definitely a casual restaurant. Food was good. Restaurant was very loud and service was so so.
2019-03-02,5,This is our go-to brunch place in Hoboken.  It is never super crowded, prices are very reasonable and its nice to sit out side during warmer months. The menu is solid- highly recommend the Lemmon Ricotta Pancakes and the Farmers Breakfast Sandwich. In my experience the specials are hit or miss. Sometimes they are excellent (The vegetable omelette) and other times not so much. That being said, I've always enjoyed the regular menu items.************Update:  I've upped this to a five. It's now been a couple more years of my husband and I enjoying Zach's and it really is just one of those places where you will reliably get good drinks and tasty food every single time you go.  Such a wonderful neighborhood spot away from some of the more - and yes I know I sound old saying this- unpleasantly rowdy locations Hoboken sometimes boasts on weekends.  And I stand by those pancakes being the best pancakes.
2019-02-27,4,Really enjoyed my meal here at Zack's. Came here in the afternoon on a Wednesday and was greeted and seated quickly. It's a quiet and relaxing place to catch up with friends and have a quick meal!We really enjoyed the Turkey Burger and Brisket Blend Burger. Everything was cooked well and the French fries were delicious!
2019-02-26,3,The food wasn't fresh unfortunately. It was one of the worst crab cake dishes I've ever had. Soggy and sloppy presentation. Yuck! The service was great though and the drinks were decent.
2019-02-22,5,My favorite brunch spot in Hoboken! It's a few blocks away from the main road so it's quieter and less crowded but the locals know where to find it. The decor (interior and exterior) is beautiful and the wait staff is always very nice. If you're looking for a cozy spot for some good brunchin', this is it.The brunch options are pretty standard and the menu isn't extremely extensive but I've been here twice and have had a great experience both times. The breakfast burrito was gigantic and eggs benedict was very well done. Their coffee is unlimited so get you can easily get your caffeine fix here. I've never had a wait on the weekends but I think it's best to make a reservation if you know you're planning on coming.Will be back again!
2019-02-18,4,Bustling brunch spot with everything you expect on the menu. Wait with a reservation was still a bit long because people just do not leave. It's a tight spot with not a lot of space. Friendly staff and food is solid. Good Bloody Mary too (ask for extra horseradish) and the prices are GREAT and affordable (~$25-30 for brunch + drink + tip/tax)
2019-02-17,5,You down to try a brunch spot that 100% has a name similar to your BFF from camp, high school, College, or that LES bar at 2AM? Well, Zack's your place. This spot was great for a late lunch/brunch spot on Presidents' Day weekend. Joe was a fantastic server that was loving my side jokes. The party I was with not so much. Any who, lunch was spot on. The drinks were $12 each and fairly priced for Hoboken right off the PATH. Our wait was 30 minutes but we waited 10 minutes for a table. Solid. Food:-Hot Friend Chicken Sanch. Not hot, but very flavorful. Solid mayo based slaw with a side of fries and a large in charge pickle. -Steal salad with medium steak. VERY good according to my soon to be wife. In total, group of 4 and 2 drinks each we settled with sub $150. Good price for great quality. Drinks were very good. Highly recommend the bourbon 232!
2019-02-16,3,I came to Zack's on a Friday night with my boyfriend after making a reservation online. You should definitely have a reservation for dinner or you will be waiting (learned this the hard way after trying to walk in on other nights and being met with a 40+ min wait). We were sat in the middle of the room in a tiny table sandwiched in the middle of two others. I asked for a different two top (there were two empty on the wall) and the hostess said they were waiting to put them together for a larger reservation. Totally cool, however she then went and sat two two tops in those tables about 5 mins later... minus 1 starI'm not sure if it was because it was Friday night, but the music in this place was so loud I could not hear anything. I couldn't hear my date or the server the entire night which was very annoying. If you're going for the going out Friday night hot spot vibe, then do that, however half the place is having dinner with entrees that cost $20+ (not exactly just bar food). The setting should reflect this in my opinion .... it really took away from the experience for me.The food and drinks i enjoyed, which WOULD make me come back despite the customer service and ambiance. I had the French onion soup (so good) and short rib ravioli (a little one dimensional as far as the flavor but still good). Boyfriend had mussels and the salmon, both he enjoyed.
2019-02-15,2,I feel strange about updating this review Bc I had pretty good experiences here in the past but maybe they've slowly been on a decline and I've just not noticed until now.A friend and I met up early evening/late afternoon to catch up, saw Zac's was open even in that awkward in between meal stage so we went.There was only one other table and a couple people sitting at the bar so we were expecting to be really well accommodated but as we were told to sit anywhere we'd like, the server then came up to us and asked for us to move tables (gesturing to a table in the far corner of the bar) "in case a larger party came and needed the 4 top"As a server/ bartender for 10+ years, glanced over the empty dining room at the 3 additional available 4tops I declined. Typically I wouldn't sit at a large table if it wasn't necessary but I felt shafted right out the gate when he wanted us to move to a less comfortable table just to have a more open dining room.Then he switched gears, brought water then waited for menus. As he dropped the menus asked us what we'd like....... told him we needed more time. Then a different server asked us for our order... said we just got the menu.. the original guy comes back and asks if "we at least know what we want to drink."Honestly, the whole experience was so uncomfortable we just picked the first things we saw on the menu just so we could be left alone for a minute to look at the food.Then we were interrupted about 10-15 more times throughout the course of us drinking/eating/talking. I could barely eat anything. I had a portobello samdwich and my friend had a burger.Everything was so big and the portions of fries could have fed a table of 6. I felt terrible not really touching my meal but I wasn't going to suffer through that meal anymore than I was already.We were thinking about ordering more drinks but then when he came back from taking our places he already dropped the check. We were like ok clearly we aren't supposed to be here so we paid and left. I'm not sure I'd go back.
2019-02-13,4,Delicious dinner at Zack's Oak Bar & Restaurant. Recommend a reservation because the restaurant was packed and we started our meal at the bar. Portions were perfectly sized - not too much (but shareable) and not too little. We ordered the mussels, which were honestly some of the best I've had - they come over a tomato based broth with several pieces of toasted bread for dipping. Then we had the stuffed chicken and pear and avocado salad with baked crab cake. For dessert, we tried the brownie with ice cream which was rich and delectable... couldn't stop eating until it was all gone! Many of the appetizers are fried - french fries, tenders, spring rolls, empanadas, shrimp tempura, nachos, etc so keep that in mind if you're looking for healthier eats, although there are healthier entree and salad options. Atmosphere was louder than I anticipated, so don't expect a super romantic candlelit dinner. Great for more of a relaxed, low key dinner or a pub style bar experience. Overall, really enjoyed every dish, the service and atmosphere. Look forward to coming back to this local Hoboken spot for another meal soon!
2019-02-05,5,So glad I wondered out of the hospital looking for lunch somewhere besides the cafeteria. You can literally fall out of the hospital entrance and into Zack's. The lunch options are plentiful and priced very nicely. Even the "First Course" options make a perfect lunch portion and of course you can't go wrong with the burgers. The fries are especially good!
2019-02-03,2,I've been wanting to try this place for a while. The food did not disappoint. However, the main problem I had was that the service was very slow.Overall, 2/5 Stars.
2019-01-28,3,My friend and I were looking at options for brunch on a Sunday and stumbled upon Zack's after narrowing the list down. I'm Celiac and very limited in my options nowadays so I figured we could head there and I'd warn the restaurant ahead of time when choosing my meal. The food at Zack's is nothing to write home about. I ordered the salmon eggs Benedict and mentioned to the server that I would like them to omit the English muffin as I have a gluten allergy. Once my food arrived, to my dismay the poached eggs and lox were casually resting on top of English muffin halves. I removed them from the dish but wish that the waitress would have been more mindful as this probably led to the cross contamination of the food as a whole. I was starving at that point so shrugged it off. My friend ordered the Farmer's breakfast, nothing special either.Food - ok.Drinks - better.If you love tequila, Mezcal included, and coconut, go for the Madame Agave. You won't be disappointed.
2019-01-26,5,My husband and I just had one of those impromptu restaurant drop-ins that turned out to be one of the best meals we have had in a while.He lived in Hoboken years ago, and Zach's had always been his great local pub with typical pub fare.  We both agree that this restaurant is now far more than the standard bar and grill.  It is located on a cozy corner in Hoboken.  About half of the restaurant is the bar / bar table area, and the back half is all small dining tables.  The interior is nice with wooden fixtures and decorative lighting.We sat down at the bar area and started with some cocktails - I had the Sarszack which was great.  We then ordered the calamari and mussels for appetizers.  Both were wonderful - but the mussels were really one of the best that I have had in a long while.  The description (mussels in red sauce) simply does not do them justice.  Then on to our entrees - Breaded chicken stuffed with asparagus over mashed potatoes and a red wine glaze.  He had the braised short rib over mash with roasted carrots.  Both were cooked to perfection.  We paired all of this with a wonderful red from Bolgheri (for $44).I dont give out 5 stars often but given the price, the service, and quality of food - I could give Zacks nothing less.  Highly recommend!
2019-01-19,5,Zack's is our solid all-around go-to local spot where everything is reasonably priced and delicious. The staff is friendly and attentive. Zack's isn't fancy, but it's clean and high-quality. It's just a good, well-run, bar/restaurant.
2019-01-15,5,This place never disappoints me.  From brunch to dinner, always a delicious meal. Not to mention they greet me so friendly when I go in with my small chihuahua service dog. Smiles all around,  especially last Sunday when I was thrown out of Northern Soul and told repeatedly they have a kitchen so my dog can't be inside. I tried explaining she was a service dog, but manger did not care, neither did the owner later on when I called.  I have been to Zacks a ton of times living in Hoboken, but since I moved out of town,  I haven't been.  I was so excited when my friend suggested to go last Sunday after our awful experience at Northern soul!  Myself, service dog, and friend all had such a tasty brunch. They gave me water for my dog as well to make sure she was taken care of just as well as we were.  Thank you Zacks for always serving yummy food and now being accommodating of people with service dogs.
2019-01-14,4,This place has a great atmosphere.  I like that it is on the corner, good beer, good hard liquor, and great staff.  The food selection is good.   Any place that has wax paper placed at the bar is good in my books.  We are here on a Monday evening and energy is in the air.
2019-01-10,5,Excellent gnocchi...stuffed chicken,great atmosphere and the service was excellent and helpful
2019-01-04,5,Came here with the family for brunch. They have great service and the food was delicious. I'll be back on my next visit to Hoboken.
2019-01-04,1,My friend got sprayed in the face with club soda by the bartender and wasn't even offered a towel to dry off. Her response was "I do that all the time". Besides having no manners, she clearly doesn't know how to count, as we were given change for $50 and not $100. With so many great bars and restaurants in Hoboken you need to avoid this place!
2019-01-03,4,Visiting NYC, stayed in NJ.  We decided to try this place.  Superb food and the service was not bad either.  I had a bacon cheeseburger and french fries.  Burger was cooked perfectly and the fries were great!   Nice little spot I would definitely visit again if ever in NJ.
2018-12-06,5,Cute spot for the holidays! It's very warm and cozy and I indulged on their organic Pinot Grigio.  The burrata appetizer was absolutely delicious, highly recommended it!I had the pear and avocado salad which was good (trying to stay healthy until I finally give into the holidays)! My friend had one of the chicken sandwiches (not sure which one) and liked it.
2018-12-01,4,What a cute place in the middle of crazy Hoboken. Loved everything. Food, ambiance and service. Will be back soon.
2018-11-18,3,Pretty much what you'd expect it to be...friendly, cozy, neighborhood joint. Noisy and crowded...our party of six, with 8pm reservations, waited forever while two lovebirds overstayed their welcome long after they paid their check. Nice staff comped us drinks. Ordered nearly every appetizer on the menu and nothing disappointed. My brisket blend burger was good but a bit dry. Fun place, enjoyable night.
2018-11-16,4,Cool atmosphere. Food was great. Wine was okay. Mixture of walk ins and reservations left my party of two waiting an hour and 15 min when we were told it would be 30. Other than that it was definitely a great experience.
2018-11-15,5,I have lived right around the corner from Zack's for 3 years, but I hadn't started going there regularly until about 6 months ago. My first experience was that it was nice establishment with outdoor seating and reasonable pricing. The first two times I went there I had the eggs benedict and the monroe, which I enjoyed. I guess about 6 months I decided to stop being lazy and do pick up orders because I would save on tip and delivery charges and get to enjoy this delicious food; I have been coming here at least once a week since I began doing that. The atmosphere in this place is always bubbling as it is usually busy, but they never slack on the preparation time. I've tried the regular bacon cheeseburger, the brisket blend burger, the nachos and chicken tenders. I have been meaning to try more things, but I get complacent at times as what I've had I'm always satisfied with. They also recently updated their menu; to see a restaurant like this doing that and also providing excellent customer service is why it deserves 5 stars in my eyes. The hostess who I see regularly is always very friendly with me (I forgot her name) but it's the little things that keep me coming back in combination with the quality of the food. I'm abroad right now, but I have no doubt in my mind that I will be coming back to Zack's soon and bringing more of my friends with me!
2018-11-13,5,I've been in Hoboken for a few years now and haven't gotten tired of Zack's yet. You can check in a few more years, but unless their perfectly thin and crispy fries turn fat and and soggy, my answer will most likely remain the same. Their menu is always changing or sprouting new dishes and they have a brunch menu that will make you so happy you managed to crawl out of bed. I've gotten everything from lobster ravioli to a classic burger and have always left so happy with my choice. There are a lot of great places in Hoboken, but rarely will you find a place that has something for LITERALLY EVERYONE. Looking at you, picky eaters. I'm a little embarrassed, but only very little, to admit that I actually went here back to back days this past weekend. "Their brunch menu and dinner menu is so different, though." - My boyfriend who makes very good arguments. I wanted a salad, he wanted a burger. Zach's easily catered to both of those palettes. I got the beet and pear salad with grilled chicken. Tasty crunchy beets, perfectly grilled chicken, and creamy goat cheese. This place is so incredibly beautiful inside. It's cozy and old timey and quaint. Go in the winter to warm up with an Irish coffee or go in the summer to sit outside and sip brunch cocktails.
2018-11-11,4,Great neighborhood bar amidst a sea of sports bars, sort of Irish pubs and pizza places. Whether it's during the week or on the weekend, Zack's is a solid option for good food, ambiance and drinks. Tuesday's are great in particular because of the half price wine deal, but also really enjoy Thursday/Friday Happy hours there. Not going to be mind blowing but that's not the point of this place either.
2018-11-10,2,My friends and I forgot to make reservations for Sunday brunch in Hoboken. I realized this Saturday at 2 am, so I sighed of relief when I was able to make a reservation online via Yelp for brunch the following morning. When we got there, it just opened but was starting to get packed as time went on. One of my friends has been here for brunch before, so I felt reassured that we made a good decision to come here for brunch. Evident by the rating of this review, I kind of regret that decision.Let's start off with the positive. Zack's is located on a quaint corner on Willow. This quaintness extended to its interior and overall charming ambiance. The waiter was nice and was doing the best he can considering the gradual brunch crowd that came in as we dined. The coffee was pretty good too. Now onto the two main negative aspects of my experience that really swayed my review:1. I was seated at the chair closest to the kitchen and because of the restaurant's small space, I kept being knocked into by waiters and other staff members coming in and out of the kitchen. Being that it's a restaurant and people go in and out of the kitchen a lot, it happened several times. I told one of the waiters that I was getting bumped into and tried to move over, but both proved to be ineffective. 2. I ordered the smoked salmon benedict. I was pleasantly surprised by the sweet potatoes mixed into my home fries that came with my meal. I was not pleasantly surprised to find that my food was cold. The potatoes, the eggs, and the subpar hollandaise sauce were barely room temperature, not even warm. My friend had ordered fries which were also cold. It took a little while to get our food, so it's understandable why the food got cold especially when the restaurant is busy. However, eggs benedict just isn't meant to be microwaved and have the same taste. The smoked salmon alone was now cooked and didn't taste the same. Since I've only been here for brunch, I'm hoping the dinner experience is different and better than the brunch one. Considering all the brunch places in Hoboken, Zack's isn't my top pick for brunch.
2018-11-05,5,Excellent burgers, cocktails, and desserts! My brother in law plowed through each of our dessert plates- and he doesn't have a sweet tooth! Great date spot or place to take the parents. If you can make a reservation, I definitely recommend doing so- this place can get packed!
2018-11-02,1,Always empty seats but they "do not take walk ins".  Not exactly the caliber restaurant you think of for reservations only.
2018-10-28,4,Came on a Saturday afternoon and sat at the bar. Bartender was very friendly. The soup and sandwich we ordered was delicious. Nice chill atmosphere.
2018-10-18,5,Favorite restaurant in Hoboken. Food is always amazing. Staff is always friendly. Affordable. Always clean.
2018-10-14,5,Zack's!! What can I say about Zack's .. Gets 2 stars for being on 3rd  & Willow  (3 more for there excellent & consensey in there food! And  for the best burger (anywhere!) Brisket burger med.. Iam a  ketcup girl ...believe me when this  comes to  the table ..party over ! Only bruger  that I never put a condtiment on. Sorry Corner Bistro still love ya.!! Like I said they get (10 's) for  not only being on 3rd & Willow but for there consistency. Maybe that's why this gem  has mantained for over 20yrs..  Excellent service.. Oh.. more prasie.. They stay open Monday.- Friday 2:am... Great neighborhood joint!!!
2018-10-08,5,This is probably my favorite restaurant in Hoboken. Well priced, good vibe, consistent, and great food. My favorite burger in town and that is usually what I come here for but everything is great and you really can't go wrong on the menu!
2018-10-04,5,Brunch here is great! Zero complaints, the food and the service was perfect.
2018-09-16,5,Amazing brunch and dinner. Never let down when I come to Zack's! The service is really quick and they're super accommodating with food allergies. Definitely a Hoboken staple.
2018-09-10,1,I just ordered the steak and fries. I received a tiny peace of tough dry meet with potatoes for $30No sauce, nothing tender or juicy. Just a cheap peace of meat that had been frozen and was then thrown on a grill until bone dry.Maybe this place is meant for drinks and happy hour because dinner was poor quality. WASTE OF MONEY for FOOD. Repeat,  WASTE OF MONEY FOR FOOD. Stay away from the crappy quality food of this place
2018-09-09,5,Had a reservation @ 7pm. Got there a tad early and was still able to get our table right away on a Friday night. Was an overall great place. Nice candlelight and fresh flower on each table really added to the attention to detail. Mac & Cheese was some of the best I've ever had. Perfect amount of cheese. Friend ordered Cod and that was also pretty good too. Would most definitely go back.
2018-09-08,4,Came here for Saturday  brunch group of 3, we had a reservation. Was busy without being packed, I would get a rezzy to be safe though.Got mimosas, with bottle of prosecco which was very reasonable. Service was quick and polite, nice chilled atmosphere.Was very reasonably priced, but food was pretty average, not bad by not amazing. I had the eggs Benedict which was ok, home fries needed a little salt but mixed in sweet potatoes were great.The farmers breakfast looked good, I got to taste sausage and bacon which were good. For the price it's good, I wouldn't come here for anything special. But for a regular brunch breakfast it's a decent spot.
2018-09-08,3,Decent food, nice clean place. Waiter was nice, reasonably priced. Eggs were cooked over medium as I asked, potatoes were mixed with sweet potatoes which was a nice surprise.I came here for brunch it was ok, nice spot if your looking for an easy chilled brunch.
2018-09-07,5,Loved the food, had brunch with my daughters they had the steak and fries, they also loved their meals. The service was amazing as well.
2018-09-05,4,Ordered the branzino and truffle fries. Both were pretty good, however, I didn't really see much truffle on the fries.  Place is busy on a Friday. We made reservations beforehand. We were a little bit late, but they still seated us, which was good.
2018-09-02,4,Family came and had a very nice meal; stuffed chic breast great, as was salads and apps; party of 6 accommodated nicely and really enjoyed it.  Wish we had a local bar/restaurant near us just as good-would definitely recommend for a nice, quality meal at reasonable price.
2018-08-09,5,Came here for an impromptu dinner on a weekday and the food was amazing. My wife had Tagliatelle pasta and I had fish tacos. We were sitting outside and enjoyed the dinner.
2018-08-08,4,Great spot in Hoboken. Reasonably priced decent food. Went on Tuesday for their 1/2 off bottles and glasses of wine and it was worth it. They have a pretty extensive list of wine. Made a reservation in case it was busy and it was a good idea.
2018-07-28,4,Strolling around in Hoboken and got a craving for a burger. Yelp to the rescue!  They were able to seat us ina. Saturday night around 8pm. Waiter was very nice and service overall was good. I had the burger and it was cooked perfectly!  Hubby had the steak burger which he really liked as well. Look forward to coming back!
2018-07-28,4,Really solid place - food was good. Got the short rib spring rolls for an appetizer, fish tacos and a burger for dinner. Portion size was small for both the short rib spring roll and fish tacos. Burger was just average. Overall definitely give it a try!
2018-07-19,5,Delicious! Their ranch pizzawich is amazing! My husband enjoyed the turkey and cheese one.
2018-07-18,5,I love Zacks. I have been here twice and enjoyed it each time. The food is very good.  The employees are very nice. It's great overall.  One of the best places in Hoboken.
2018-06-20,3,Great atmosphere, nice outdoor seating area. Being in the backend of Hoboken, it is in the quieter, less traveled portion. Ok beer selection, there is better in Hoboken. Very interesting menu, Italian, mexican, spanish, korean... I got the short rib ravioli, which had a nice sauce, filled with perfectly cooked short rib, just wish there was more filling, and the ravioli was cooked a little more.
2018-06-09,3,Came here twice and felt disappointed twice. Ordered soup the first time and had Cod today. The cod was over cooked and the sauce tasted like nothing. It just didn't mix well. The atmosphere was pretty good tho.
2018-06-09,4,Most people pass by Zach's not knowing the great food they have inside the restaurant, but the aroma that comes out side when you walk by will make you think twice, the staff is very helpful and will accommodate your order, I ended up starting my brunch with their Eggs Benedict $10 instead of bacon I went with their delicious sausage links with the english muffin and a side of toasted regular and sweet potatoes glazed with their special Hollandaise sauce, they are also known for their stuffed chicken $16 with 5 spices and their brisket blend burger $14 for dinner.
2018-06-02,4,Good to get away from the Washington Bars. I really love this spot but the only reason why I can't give it a five stars is because I literally go here all the time and they are just not personable people. If you're looking to get away from some of the annoying washington ave bars and crowds, zack's is a nice spot! Brunch is delicious and everything is always fresh. Bloodmary is on point along with their cocktails - my friend is obsessed with their spicy cocktail, something on fire? Idk but she really loves it. The food is good and never disappoints. They have outdoor seating and I like that they have high top tables.
2018-05-31,4,Only been here a handful of times since I moved to Hoboken in January but each time I had good experience. There's a few things that stand out about this place, one being the lack of management which is extremely obvious. The second being the attentive and genuinely personable staff despite being neglected by the owners or whatever management they might have. Going through the reviews, you can tell that they're placed by people who have never worked a day in a restaurant or don't even seem like they know how to eat in a restaurant, they're misleading. The staff is refreshing and you don't seem to find that a lot in Hoboken... We had one issue with the kitchen taking a while on the food and if it wasn't for the great server we had and his attentiveness, I wouldn't have come back the third time. His coworker and himself were very apologetic that there wasn't a manager to speak to but by the end of the convo my fiancé and I completely forgot about the food. Aside from the drinks being tasty We would definitely go back to have either of those guys serve us and exchange dog stories!
2018-05-29,5,Omg had THE BEST DINNER EVER!!! Service was on point, cozy environment and fun atmosphere! Had many dishes to choose from I actually had a hard time to pick just one! If I lived there this would be my weekly place to eat! Great price and perfect plates! It's like the chef knew what your taste bud was looking for! Only bad part is that I cleaned my plate and was too full for dessert! Everyone in my family cleaned there plates and that says something!
2018-05-29,4,stopped here on one of the first warm nights of spring to sit outside on their patio. inside was super crowded as it had just rained, so it was very easy to get a table outside. the menu offers multiple different american options. i started with some french onion soup, which was very tasty. i was also super tempted to order truffle fries, as i had smelled them earlier in the inside dining room, but i resisted! for my entree i was between the famous stuffed chicken and the gnocchi. my server reco'd the chicken. Overall the chicken was a unique dish, something different and had more of an asian flavor vs. what i was expecting (there's five spice in the sauce). mike had the steak salad, which was also delicious. i am definitely planning on coming back to try the gnocchi and truffle fries!
2018-05-25,2,Disappointed as I had wanted to try this restaurant for months. Service was terrible! Had a reservation, place was not busy. We were seated by a hostess and no one ever came over to our table. After about 15 minutes we had to flag someone down to get water. In order to place our food order we had to do the same thing. No one came to check in. Never got refills of water. Each time someone new came over to our table to give us utensils, bring our food, take our check after we had to search around and grab someone. We did not get new utensils/plates between a messy appetizer and our entrees. The food was alright, pretty average. My tagliatelle was not warm and had limited flavor. The sausage was actually very good but it was in a bland butter sauce. The short rib ravioli was decent but the flavor of the sauce overpowered the short rib (could have been any other meat and tasted the same). If the place was cheaper I would say it was okay, but paying $20 per entree was too much for how average/plain the food tasted. Probably will not come back to Zack's.
2018-05-12,4,Get the short rib ravioli spicy and absolutely fantastic! I also tried my friends meals the gnocchi was probably the best I have ever had, the stuffed chicken was ok and the steak was average. Italian might may be the way to go here!
2018-05-08,2,This packed, loud, small place has some great food like the mac and cheese and the seafood special (though lacking sauce) but also some very bland and under seasoned dishes like the lentil salad and the burrata cheese appetizer. I was very disappointed at how bland and under-salted they were. The portions were also small. The food did come out fast and the waiter was pretty attentive.
2018-04-21,5,Great food, executed perfectly.  I have been to Zack's four times now, and everything I ordered here was good!  My favorite appetizer is the Truffle fries. The favorites for dinner are two short rib dishes: braised short ribs and short rib ravioli.  Brunch here is great too: the smoked salmon Benedict and their burgers are very good.  Cannot wait to come back here and try more items on the menu!
2018-04-20,5,Delicious food, loved the ambiance and the drinks were averagely priced but pretty strong. Recommend it.
2018-04-20,4,Tried Zack's for the first time in a long time. I ate here probably 5 years ago and felt it was average.Things have clearly changed. First off, a much improved wine selection. Secondly, an improved menu with some interesting fare which you don't see everyday at restaurants. Whatever they are doing - it is clearly headed in the right direction. Reminds me of Court Street, which was my go-to restaurant when I lived two blocks away. Going to go back and try some more things from the menu and i'm looking forward to it.
2018-04-16,4,We went there on a Sunday for brunch. Got there around 10:15 and it was just starting to get crowded. Within 10 minutes of us being seated, the place was pretty much full to capacity. It took a few minutes for our server to get to us,  but I've he did,  our orders came out really quickly. I ordered a steak and eggs medium. They gave  it to me on the rare side, but better undercooked than overcooked when it comes to steak. I've also come to the realization, that  very few places (outside of actual steakhouses) can do a steak justice. It's just a lost art. We also ordered Bloody Marys and they were very good. I'd definitely go there again, it's cozy and intimate and the food was  very tasty, especially the potato hash with  Russet potatoes and Sweet potatoes.
2018-04-10,5,Met friends for lunch the other day and the meals consisted of arugula salad with grilled chicken and chicken quesadilla. Presentation and meals were excellent. Salad dressing was light and flavorful. Waitress was very attentive and pleasant. A keeper....
2018-04-09,4,I had the short rib ravioli for a Sunday evening dinner. The tomato sauce was surprisingly spicy and somewhat overpowered the flavor of the short ribs. Feel like they should have mentioned the spiciness of the sauce on the menu. But the ravioli filling was meaty and creamy and delicious as you'd want it.Overall a solid pasta dish. And the flourless chocolate cake was a delicious dense chocolatey treat for dessert!
2018-04-08,3,Usually pretty good but today I was served cold food (eggs Benedict and potatoes) by a server who couldn't really care less if I needed anything else or how my meal was. My friends' food was also cold, but we all ate it because the server never came back to the table until it was time to clear the plates. Unfortunate, because this is usually a great place.
2018-04-08,4,Great brunch and service. Full bar. Reservations recommended as it gets busy on weekends. Recommend the cappuccino at brunch. Prices are very reasonable for good quality classic brunch dishes. All in all a great experience.
2018-04-02,4,I've been to Zack's before for brunch but I came here a few weeks ago with friends for dinner. The dinner is just as good as the brunch and I was not disappointed with the food. I got the salmon dinner entree and it was so so good! The restaurant was reasonably packed but luckily we had reservations so did not have to wait long to be seated.  I will definitely be back here and add this restaurant into my rotation.
2018-03-30,3,Great food but the seating was extremely odd. Very cramped, thumbelina and her family could not have dined comfortably here.
2018-03-20,4,Good food. Lots of Flickr in the crab cakes. The Willow sandwich is a bit dry but okay. The house of Shandy lemon tase like lemonade On too of lemonade with beer. Yet the cheesecake is the bomb.
2018-03-11,4,Dined here this morning for Brunch, with a 12PM reservation.I highly recommend reservations as this place can get a little tight. With out OpenTable Reservation we got seated right away.Cocktails- Brunch cocktails range between $8-12 each. All handcrafted, and great quality. Downside- For brunch, there are no pitcher options for Mimosas for large groups or for when you just want to enjoy a Sunday Brunch with your girlfriends. After 3 rounds the cocktails add up/FOOD- Amazing! I ordered the Open Faced Egg ($12) and My date ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes ($8). SERVICE-  The restaurant got too packed when a party of 6 walked in and the service staff asked if my date and myself (party of 2) could switch tables so the 6 party could take our large table, and they would give us a free dessert. Highly recommend the Brownie A la Mode. Most certainly will return. My only advice is the cocktails. Offering better options for pricing would make this place a great competitive options for groups, birthday parties, and family brunches. If it is just 2 people then paying per drink is no problem!
2018-03-02,5,Very good food and very chill bar scene.  The place itself is beautiful and they have outdoor seating in the warmer months.  Staff is attentive and prices are reasonable.  Good place for brunch or dinner with anyone.  Live jazz band Wednesday nights!
2018-02-25,5,Love this place. Great food / cocktails / decor. A nice reprieve from the Irish pubs filled with flexing bros that are so typical of hoboken.
2018-02-18,5,One of the best brunch's in Hoboken. Very friendly service. Best eggs Benedict I've ever had! Very good Bloody Mary as well.
2018-02-17,3,Very busy on a Friday evening. Parking wasn't too hard to find shockingly. We had reservations at 7 but the table was still occupied. We were waiting for 2 more but considering we had a reservation I feel like the table should have been ready! The table was free around early 7 but our friends still didn't show up until later on.My other friend and I ordered. I got the Portobello mushroom burger and she got the short rib ravilolli We got prosecco to begin with for drinks. The bartenders were very nice. The Portobello burger was just not good at all. Disappointing since they don't really have many if not any vegetarian/vegan options. My friend liked her short rib a lot. My other friends got the penne vodka which they both really liked.The waitress noticed I didn't finish my food and asked what was wrong. I simple said I don't like it but it was okay. She removed it from the check, which I felt very bad about even though I didn't eat it. I am giving them 4 stars for service and for the food that my friends enjoyed, but I'm going to give them 3 for the lack of options for vegetarians! I liked the environment, though it is a lot smaller than I thought it would be. Would you back for drinks at least.
2018-02-05,2,Big disappointment and in complete contrast to the majority of 4 and 5 star yelp reviews. We arrived and were greeted by a melancholy waitress who seemed indifferent to serving us. No smile or pleasantries. It made us feel uncomfortable. The quinoa bowl while somewhat visually appealing was bland and lacked seasoning. The pear salad was a wilted soggy mess of yellow lettuce and pine nuts with a thin, reasonably tasty chicken breast sliced and lobbed onto the side of the dish. The steak and eggs with mixed sweet and white potatoes tasted like leftovers. The meat was tough and overdone despite my request for medium rare. The redeeming dish was the baked eggs. The tomato sauce and cheese blend with the eggs was flavorful and hearty. The grated cheese sprinkled toasted and buttered baguette was a nice textual contrast to the dish. I wasn't impressed with the mimosas. They tasted cheap and flat. We finished the meal with beverages. a hot chocolate which was sweet, rich, creamy, and topped with a generous amount of whipped cream. The Irish coffee was tasty with a healthy portion of bailey's liquor and more tasty whip cream. However, these two dessert drinks were not enough to redeem this sad excuse for a brunch. Overall my experience at Zack's was undesirable and I will not be returning to give it another shot.
2018-02-04,2,I had high hopes for this place. There menu had a bunch of brunch options but unfortunately I was reminded to not judge a book by its cover. 1 out of the 4 items we ordered were good. The baked eggs were the savor of the meal. Everything else was so so. The cranberry pear salad was wilted and had no flavor. The quinoa was tasteless. The steak and eggs were just ok. If you come here try the baked eggs. Those seemed to save the day. Nice ambiance tho. On to the next...
2018-01-28,1,Went there this past Saturday for brunch and there was an obnoxious group getting way too roudy and drunk - and so loud that every table around theirs was looking for another place to eat. No effort was made by the restaurant to control the volume level, even as it turned to full on screams, shots and chants.I can guarantee none of the 6 or so families including ours that witnessed this malarkey will ever return, even though the food and waitstaff were lovely.It's your restaurant - you have the control and responsibility to maintain a baseline code of conduct.
2018-01-28,5,I threw a surprise 25th birthday brunch here with 24 people and the service was excellent! The menu was a mix of eggs, salad and burgers so everyone had choices! The food was tasty and for such a large group all the food and drinks were serve timely. Thank you!
2018-01-22,5,Really great atmosphere. Younger crowd than the feeling I got from looking through the window. Been for drinks which is great if you're looking for a quite evening. Dinner was very yummy
2018-01-20,5,On my Hoboken go to list.I love sitting a the bar.  Great service.Food is solid, but little pricey, but you walk away full.  I usually get the chicken sandwich and fries, and always happy.
2018-01-08,4,Came here on a Saturday night on a whim since we live in the neighborhood and pass all the time. After first experience this is great for a casual date night or sit at the bar to catch up. Food was good, the crab cake portion wasn't too big but the braised short ribs were phenomenal! We definitely would come back again.
2018-01-07,3,Came here on a frigid night with my boyfriend for a casual dinner. We both ordered French onion soup, it was okay. Surprisingly it was under salted, which is pretty impossible to be.I ordered a sour and my boyfriend ordered a Manhattan. The drinks took forever. We received our soup before our cocktails, and finished the soup before the drinks came. We also ordered dinner, my boyfriend ordered a pork chop. He loved it, said it was well cooked and seasoned well. Our waiter was on top of things, just seemed the bar was working slow or potentially they could have used an additional bartender on site. It was a Wednesday and the place was not packed. Waiting 17 minutes for a drink isn't ideal.
2018-01-06,4,I live right around the corner and have been to Zack's a few times. This is a cozy, classic American bar setup pumping out Italian/American food each evening. The food is good for a bar without being spectacular. Their burger is definitely worth a look, served with a good amount of fries and a whole juicy pickle! The spaghetti meatballs were solid, although I thought the sauce could've had more flavour. Definitely a step up from your average hoboken pub, I'd recommend dropping by for a burger and a beer if you're in the area.
2017-12-21,5,If would give a 6, if I could! From start to finish, I would say this was an organically comfortably flawless and authentic place. Designed like an old (seemingly pre-war), moderately renovated American bar, this place had a clean charming, holiday wreath entrance, located at a quiet residential corner; however the restaurant was bustling inside as if it were supposed to be in the city -- such a contrast to the neighborhood.They sat us right away, as I made reservations via Yelp's guidance. They had the table nicely prepared. We were able to order wine and appetizer right away. I was very impressed with the appetizers we ordered, especially the al dente mac and cheese and truffle fries! We also ordered spicy calamari which was also delicious. They were decievingly delicious because they came out on a casual plate, generous portions, which only adds to the experience.For main courses, we ordered two NY rib eyes, one gnocchi, one fish tacos, two ribs. I can only speak to the medium steak and gnocchi that I shared. It was probably one of the best steaks I had. Very tender/slightly rare, well cooked and the gorgonzola butter made it all the more savory. It was a perfectly blend of rare and seared/cooked at the outer layers. Side note: Bottle of wine and and dessert were similarly good. The key like pie wasn't overly sweet or sour. Probably one if best key lime pies I've had. Everything was freshly made.Not only was the food good, but while it was packed inside, the service was on point. The waitress was timely, friendly, quickly/succinctly resourceful, and nimble but not overly engaged. My water glass was never empty. She was on point! Not to mention, Wednesday nights have live music. Perfect score for this beloved, happening gem located in a quiet area!
2017-12-11,5,Very cozy inside and probably my favorite mac and cheese that I've had in a while!  Prices are on par with other comparable spots in the area, service is friendly and efficient.  The food was all-around very good although the meat:potato ratio in the Shepherd's Pie was a little much for me, personally.  The whole menu sounded delish--will be back to try more!
2017-11-13,4,Fun fresh cocktails. Recommend outdoor seating when weather allows, inside can be noises! Lots of wine to choose from also. Service was quick and friendly. I would go recommend for a date spot also. Expect a wait, but grab a drink in the meantime! Try the caprese salad, and the crab cake sandwich. Not an egg person but tons of brunch options.
2017-11-13,4,Have never had the pleasure of checking this place out for dinner but their lunch menu is a good alternative for the days you want to splurge with a fancy salad or in the mood for some nachos. my favorite has to be the butter lettuce and avocado salad. so delicious. 11 dollars gets you butter lettuce, avocado, sliced pears, pine nuts and a creamy goat dressing. Really hungry? the nachos or turkey burgers are goof alternatives.
2017-11-12,5,One of my favorite places in HobokenGreat serviceGreat foodWhether you go for just drinks and apps or dinner, you wont be disappointed
2017-11-05,4,They offer a pretty decent brunch with a comfortable dining experience.It is basically impossible to find the correct entrance and once you do, to catch the attention of the appropriate person, but the food makes up for it.
2017-11-01,2,The food was terrible. I ordered the calamari appetizer and steak entree which both lacked seasoning and flavor. The steak tasted like a frozen salisbury steak dinner that had been heated up in the microwave. The fries were good. Additionally, the service was not great. I know that it was busy but the waitress kept forgetting to bring us items that we asked for. There was also a mistake on our bill and the waitress charged this wrong amount on our card then had to reverse then rerun the transaction. Maybe she was new. Overall, I was not impressed.
2017-11-01,1,I ordered empanadas which was an appetizer and with everything they should have taken 16 dollars, but they charged me the 16 dollars and then 30 dollars for nothing. This is not ok. The server was irresponsible and they are taking forever to refund me like they don't care about their customers. Worst service!
2017-10-29,5,Great quality food and terrific staff. Definitely recommend the rigatoni (the Saturday special pasta) and short ribs! Will definitely be returning to try more things on the menu!
2017-10-29,4,Good ambience. Tried the grilled portobello, was delicious and the Cibatta was crispy! Fries were good. Do try the hot chocolate!
2017-10-22,3,Enjoyed my food and drinks here however the service was less than satisfactory. My waitress was very kind but failed to be attentive to our group.
2017-10-16,4,Such a cute spot in Hoboken. When you step in, you feel like you've stepped into a ski lodge den of some sort. The lights are dim and it has a cozy feel, makes you want to order a glass of wine and get comfortable. It is on the smaller side so recommend reserving a table ahead of time. By 7:30 on a Friday night this place got packed. Even still, this place had a very relaxing vibe. We started off ordering a few appetizers, the burrata, the nachos, and the Truffle fries. The burrata was served over tomato with some bread on the side, really good. The nacho platter was really big and a little hard to eat as all the toppings were literally on top of the bed of nachos and not dispersed throughout. The Truffle fries were pretty good and there was a decent serving. All in all we were very pleased and moved on to entrees. I have been eyeing the calamari on the menu and saw it come out for another table so I subdue this in for my entree and was very satisfied. The waitress recommended a Chipotle aioli sauce and so she brought it on the side, it was delicious! The marinara on the side was also great with the calamari. This hit the spot. My husband got the penne vodka and devoured it, I didn't have the chance to sneak in a bite! So I know it must have been really good! Prices are average for food, the drink prices are a little high but considering the area it isn't awful. I remember the Zacks cocktail clocked in at $12, which I thought was a little too much for what was served. Overall it was a nice spot for dinner.
2017-09-21,5,Zack's is the best! It is our go-to for super good American food - or when we can't figure out where else to go! Any dish - whether for brunch, lunch or dinner is so delicious. Mark, the owner, his wife, and the staff are super welcoming and love having regulars. Kid and dog friendly too! :)Our favorites are: Salmon entree, brisket burger, lentil salad, calamari, steak frites...to name a few. Also, truffle fries...yum.
2017-09-21,5,The brisket blend is the best burger in Hoboken, and it comes with outstanding fries. Every time I come here I say I'm going to get something else, but it's so hard to pass up the BB burger. The salmon entree is also delicious, including the sides. Like Court Street, Zack's has a bar dining area, and a separate dining area, so it's great to watch a game or take a date. Zack's consistently satisfies.
2017-09-21,4,Consider this a 3.5. I came with a group on a Saturday. Service was a little short but quick and good for the Saturday craziness. I ordered one of their more popular chicken dishes and the chicken came out slimy.  After asking my dining companion to try it and getting his second opinion I sent it back.  The servers replaced the order without any fuss and I just switched to what my friend was eating(a lamb ragout pasta-which was very good).  Slight hiccup and I'll be back to try that chicken dish one day.
2017-09-10,2,Food was fine but the service left something to be desired. Specifically my waitress who managed to spill a beer and a thing of vinegar on me. Also nothing was taken off the bill so I paid full price for a beer that my jeans drank.
2017-09-05,5,How can this place not always get 5 stars. The food and service is amazing. For starters I had the Zacks Sour is was to die and had me on the floor basically after the second on and to add its very pretty . For appetizers we had a the Short Rib Spring Rolls which pair so well with the sauce provide the cilantro adds a great touch. We add the Pear and Avocado salad to go with it. It has Pine Nuts and Cranberries which add a great touch. And let me tell you please get the Shrimp Po Boy, the shrimp were so tender and fresh. I have nothing but good things to say. Sarah was the bartender and made the night a time to remember. We will be back. I encourage anyone in turn area to come. Great atmosphere.
2017-08-30,4,Came here the other night with my sister for a late dinner ! We had a great meal ! We shared the crab cake and the pear and pecan arugula salad ! I had the burger and she had fish tacos ! It was all very good ! Def would come again
2017-08-27,5,Absolutely outstanding restaurant. We've lived in Hoboken for over 2 years and this is easily a top 3 restaurant, if not #1 in town. The menu is incredible and everything we ordered was literally amazing. I highly, highly, highly, highly recommend this place.
2017-08-24,5,Visited this place last Saturday for brunch and was quite pleased. Food was great for the prices, and so were the mimosas however they were served a little on the warm side (chilled would be better). But waitress was very attentive. Overall i would definitely visit again. Loved it!!
2017-08-21,4,Overall good place. Super Awesome server. Well priced food with good quality and value behind it.  Great bread for the sandwich. Not a fan of the fries.  Ambience is big for me and this place is cute.  Great dinner date spot.  Nice lunch menu. Definitly give you some options.  Ill be back for dinner.
2017-08-20,5,Great menu, execution and service plus fine selection of wines and beers. On top of that original XIX century interior with tin ceiling makes it unique. Stuffed chicken breast was above and beyond - maybe the best chicken on a menu in recent memory. The place is real gem!
2017-08-14,3,Came here with a friend for brunch and expected to have a better experience. The place looks nice from the outside. The inside as well kind of vintage. The bar area is great huge selection of alcohol, but was not impressed with the Beer selection. As well as the menu. I'm a huge fan of draft beer and when I look at a menu I like to see how much percentage of alcohol each beer has. Every time you go to a bar and want draft beers there's always going to be different selections and you would always want to know how it's made. I enjoy exploring new beers and connecting with the right taste. The first round of beers were hot not impressed. The bartender by the name of Kieran should have know that beer was not ready to be served. The second beers were much better still not too cold would of loved cold one better bit for some reason we just had a bad experience with the beers. My friend was getting hungry so he order the Bec Burger he loved it. So did I... i had a huge bite from it. The music was bad not impressed Kieran that's playing instruments the whole time I rather listen to jazz music at least or anything else besides instrumentals. The bathroom smelled great single bathrooms. And the atmosphere was great as well. Kieran kept checkin on us making sure we were good. Very good bartender just needs to be clear if something is not ready to be served. Other than that will visit again if I'm near by and I the experience is better I will be editing this post.
2017-08-13,5,Love this restaurant. Waitress was so friendly and nice. We orders 3 different appetizers, every single one was delicious! Sitting outside with beer and rose in a beautiful Sunday afternoon, place to go!
2017-08-12,4,Went for breakfast. Food was good, but nothing spectacular. Most of our party got open faced egg sandwiches which were nice, but the potatoes were undercooked. The mimosas were nice and strong though. We didn't have reservations but they still seated our party of 7 at 10am on a Saturday. The waitstaff were super attentive and very willing to put up with the three kids we had with us. Seriously they were beyond awesome. I'd go back just for the drinks and their fabulous service. Major props to the Saturday morning crew!!
2017-08-03,5,Came here with 3 friends with a reservation for 6:15 in a Wednesday. Considering it was Hoboken it was hard to find parking so we got to the place 15 minutes late, but they still held the table for us. At the time it wasn't busy, but it eventually got busy and it was a little hard to hear one another. Also the place is small, but the food was delicious. I had the fried calamari, which was a little spicy  but I didn't mind it because it had great  flavor. Then I had the French cut chicken breast which was amazing, it wasn't dry and the presentation was nice. Dessert was great too, don't remember what I had but it wasn't too sweet and the coffee was fresh. Ordered a bottle of Pinot noir and that was great. Chris, our waiter, was very attentive especially with water. It's really something to appreciate when you don't have to ask for more water, that the staff already know to pour more. Would go again
2017-07-28,4,Great place to take a date, great drinks, amazing beer in bottle and on tap. Food was amazing. Cooked to perfection. Staff went above and beyond to make sure you had everything you needed, they were polite. Definitely a place to check out, you'll have a great time and also the music is on point
2017-07-24,4,Best Bloody Mary! My mother and I search high and low for good bloody mary's and we have not found one that compares to Zack's. Food, environment, and staff are all wonderful as well.
2017-07-19,5,Fish tacos all the way- they mix up the selection of fish (it was cod night) I got mine blackened for a little extra kick. Soooo good! Corn salsa, avocado, lettuce and a chipotle aioli (I think?) Definitely will be coming back in for these!
2017-07-11,5,We've been to Zach's several times and really love it. Great service, warm, friendly atmosphere,  delicious drinks and very tasty food. Great choices too!
2017-07-02,5,I love everything about this place. The food, the service, the ambiance.. it's always a good time when I go. The food is delicious and the drinks are great!
2017-06-27,5,My local bar, always great service and nice low key atmosphere. Try the burger, its awesome.
2017-06-27,4,This place is great! I dined here on a Saturday night after being really indecisive on where to eat dinner. By the time we made a decision it was 8PM-- prime time for dinner in Hoboken. I called to see if they'd be able to seat 2 people and they hostess said we could be seated within 30 mins. I got to the restaurant within 20 min and we were seated right away. The place was packed but we were able to still enjoy a nice date night dinner. The drinks were great and the food was tasty as well. The food came out incredibly fast-- something I didn't mind at the time but on other nights I might have felt a little rushed. There was a few large parties seated so I can see they were trying to tend to the small tables as fast as they could to focus on those groups. Overall, I think Zack's is a great restaurant. I like that they have pasta specials every night and the prices are reasonable too.
2017-06-24,3,Great Food---Service Lacking.Made a reservation for 6 people at 9 PM on a Friday evening.   The place was very busy-hence the reason why we made a reservation ahead of time for a large group.  We weren't seated until 9:30 PM by a hostess who was very flustered and felt like we were getting rushed out of our table the entire time.  We ordered a bottle of wine for the table - it was served already open and placed in the middle of the table with the foil still on the top that needed to be torn off.  No taste testing to make sure the wine wasn't corked.  The food came out quickly and was good- that was probably the only saving grace for the meal.
2017-06-18,4,Zack's had a great looking menu, so my friend and I split a few options. We ordered the short rib egg rolls, chicken and cheese empanadas and the pear-avocado salad. All were really good! The egg rolls and empanadas both came with 4 pieces each and were relatively small, so it didn't feel like too much food. We could have done with a protein in the salad because of that, but it was all good. She was drinking beer but I opted for the "Zack's Cocktail," which had run, banana, fig and tamarind in it and it was GREAT. Very boozy but I only had one and it really took the end-of-the-week edge off. Nice outdoor seating in downtown Hoboken topped it off. I'd go back!
2017-06-04,5,First time here! Dined here for a mid-day lunch last weekend. The menu was pretty limited. I'm guessing because of the mid-day transition from brunch to dinner; however, still found items I liked on the menu.The decor has an old but updated touch to it. The ceilings in the back room is how I envisioned my future loft apartment to mirror. Super cute. Food:Ordered the salad with blue cheese and cranberries  usually my go to option when I'm in the mood for a a salad. Added grilled shrimp to it, perfect. Looking forward to coming back here for brunch.
2017-06-04,4,I didn't get any food we just came on here for some drinks on a Saturday night before heading outI thought our bartender was very friendly and the atmosphere was nice everyone was well-behaved it wasn't a fancy place in my opinion but it is definitely marketed very nicely I didn't take a look at the menu We had already had dinner in Cedar Grove so my review is just based on the atmosphere and we took an Uber there there is no parking so you have to be on flight or get dropped off and it's not on Main Street either. I would definitely return
2017-05-29,1,My boyfriend and I wanted to find a spot off the Main Street by our apartment and this place had great reviews and it was so close. The place was very packed and cool looking at first but the food was very disappointing. First we ordered the nachos and they were basically Tostitos with shredded cheese microwaved on and slabs of toppings on top. You could literally peel the cold cheese off and have just chips with the remaining unmelted cheese under it. I ordered a pear and avocado salad which the waitress said was the most popular salad. It was 90% lettuce with almost nothing on it. I think there was about four mini pieces of pear and two avocado slices.My boyfriend got the penne vodka and it was average. Seemed like they took a bad jar of sauce from the grocery store and served it. All in all if I wanted store bought food I would have went to the grocery store. Nothing seemed fresh or prepared from scratch, it seemed like it came right off the shelf ready to heat up.
2017-05-29,4,Great looking place, great crowd, indoor and outdoor.  Great service. I had the bec burger for Lunch. Burger, bacon, egg and other thins I can't remember but overall great choice. The fries are addicting so good. The chicken fingers are chicken cutlets fried, they could have been better. My date had a shrimp salad and she loved it
2017-05-27,5,Great place for a sit down brunch weather you plan to eat and go or hang out for a few drinks. People where friendly. Food was good and I enjoyed my bloody Mary. Also seemed to be one of the few brunch places open on a Saturday morning.
2017-05-26,4,Cute inside and outside ambiance. Much better food quality than some of the other nearby bars and still at a good affordable price!!
2017-05-23,2,Where to start?!?! I booked reservations online about 3 weeks in advance for a Sunday early afternoon brunch for a group of 12. (I should mention I called TWICE to confirm - initially after making the reservation, and a few days before). We arrived a few minutes early, and there was clearly no where that 12 of us would sit. The hostess had a look of panic on her face and started talking to everyone else that worked there. Then I got the excuse of, "well if you booked online, it sometimes double books." WELL you should probably figure that out! ...a few minutes after that, I got the excuse of "well we were backed up this morning..." STILL not a good excuse. We finally were able to sit 45 minutes later (what's the use of a reservation at that point?!?!)... food was OK, price was reasonable but we definitely will not be back.
2017-05-17,5,This is our favorite bar in Hoboken. Consistently delicious food and rotating draft beer options that keep us coming back time and time againMonday night is out kids favorite as the pasta special (they do a different pasta every night) is the spaghetti and meatballs. It is really good!My husband and I love the steak, mashed potatoes and broccoli. Always really good and very reasonably priced. We often also get the salads, salmon or turkey burgers and everything always comes out great. Very very consistent. I also really like their wine options. They have some really nice wines by the glass which makes hanging out here over brunch or dinner a great choiceIn the nicer weather they have several outdoor tables. There is sometimes a wait but a nice bar to hang out at while you wait. I believe they have also started taking reservations from OpenTable which can help on the weekends.
2017-05-16,4,Nice quaint place, food was good, waitress was really friendly . Good place for a date or for small groups
2017-04-29,1,Never again. The food was terrible. How do you mess up truffle fries, soggy and gross. Stick to the salads. Christina was the best bartender ever. Would comeback just for her.  We sat at the bar, service was excellent.
2017-04-29,5,Serious spot, must try. I don't review often, but the staff was warm and on the moneyGreat job on the food, brisket burger was just right, different though and my date said the Mahi Mahi was also very good.
2017-04-25,4,Stopped in for a drink recently and this place hasn't changed one bit in the 7+ years between visits. Nice 90s playlist. Ball games on TV. An OK selection of craft brews. Nice relaxed vibe. We missed you Zack's!
2017-04-23,4,Servers are friendly, food is good. I ordered steak and home fries, they were tasty. One star reduction is for lack of creativity lol. If you want a standard brunch it is a good place to go,but if you want something creative or interesting I guess you can try other restaurants.Ps: I also ordered espresso, it was okay.
2017-04-15,4,Great location especially on the weekends if you are looking to avoid the meatheads on Washington Street. Good bar, intimate dining area, good food, good service. You can't go wrong here.
2017-04-09,5,Keeran was an awesome bartender. So friendly and nice great time. Awesome food too. Great ambiance and amazingly clean bathrooms
2017-03-27,4,Great brunch spot for a big group! We were able to get a reservation for 10 only a couple days in advance and they were very accommodating of our need for high chairs, etc.I had the vegetable omelette, which was very good. The use of Parmesan cheese was unique and very tasty.  I was also very happy that they had fresh squeezed orange juice. Overall, it may not be a grand culinary experience but it's a solid spot where the service and food are both good and the prices are on point.
2017-03-26,5,This is a great, cozy corner spot for a meal or few casual drinks. It's NOT a sports/Irish bar like 80% of other bar-restaurants in Hoboken. The food menu is diverse enough to have options outside of burger&fries but not overwhelming. I havent had a bad plate there, been there five times and thats the truth. Prices are in line with the ambiance and quality as well. Wait staff is always friendly, accurate, and quick. Definitely a recommend.
2017-03-21,5,I came here for Sunday brunch and really enjoyed it. Reasonably priced, excellent food (burger & crab cakes) topped with an awesome and friendly environment
2017-03-18,4,Pretty old school decor and feel in this bar.  As the name suggests - lots of oak. Beer selection pretty good and staff were very attentive and amiable.Food wise I just had the burger. Standard enough. But the menu is pretty good and food I saw coming from kitchen looked the part. Will come again.
2017-03-15,5,I have been going here for years.  Their food is good and the menu stays pretty consistent.  I love their old bar and like the fact that they are open late.   It's nice that it's on a side street away from the main drag.  More of a locals kind a place instead of all the crazies that come from out of town.
2017-03-15,3,Great prices and great atmosphere but not exactly very tasty dishes. They rely on the fact that the lights are low and the local tinder first dates that didn't want to go to a bar.
2017-03-12,5,My group visited on 3/11/17.  We had reservations at 8pm. What a great place!  Great atmosphere, terrific service, and delicious food and drinks. Parking is hard to come by...but the owner was gracious enough to move his car so a person in our group had a place to park.  Thank you for a great experience. We look forward to another visit!
2017-03-07,5,We were a party of 6 for my daughter's 21st birthday. Chicken specials, salmon specials, and shepherds pie specials. Every one of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals. Our server was very polite and food was served at An appropriate pace. Would definitely return and definitely recommend. We also made reservations for dinner and our table was waiting for us. They realized it was a birthday celebration and added a candle to my daughter's dessert. Nice touch!
2017-03-04,4,I came her with my wife and another couple after looking for a nice place to have dinner in Hoboken that wasn't littered with drunk kids on a Saturday night. We made reservations but still had to wait about 30 minutes. The manager or owner was very apologetic about the few delay - it was because a toddler had fallen asleep at the table we were waiting for. Totally ok, but they could have made up for the inconvenience. The wait, however, was worth it... We had appetizers, drinks (try the jalapeño drink!) and entrees, all of which were delicious and reasonably priced... considering we live in NYC and didn't know what to think about this "bar."The wait staff was accommodating and speedy, but not annoying asking us every 10 seconds if we needed something. They had a very good sense for when to refill water, etc. One other negative thing would have to be the noise level. The acoustics in the restaurant seem to just reverb voices a touch, making it sound louder than it was. That being said, we were still able to have a comfortable conversation with our friends. Also, a Check in offer would be nice, too - perhaps a glass of house wine or even an app for the table. Chances are, you're spending $40pp anyways! We will absolutely comeback here the next time we are in Hoboken, but because there were a few things that could have been better, I can only give a 4-star review for now.
2017-03-01,2,Grill clearly wasn't cleaned before my burger was put on it. Had the charred remains of whatever was cooked before it and a burnt taste. Is there any solid food in Hoboken??
2017-02-26,3,My girlfriend and I decided to stop here for a drink and some small bites before hanging out in Hoboken. I do love that it was tucked away on a smaller street, instead of being on the main street. We ventured in around mid-day, so unfortunately we missed brunch. Their mid-day menu was just ok, there weren't anything spectacular (burgers, smalls and apps). I wish they had a better mid-day menu. The cobb salad was pretty basic. The nachos could have been better constructed, the chili was placed on the bottom and topped with the nachos, which made the nachos a bit soggy. However, the star of the apps were the crab cake, perfectly fried and full of flavor. The aoili with it was magical. The environment was super cute, and the vibe was really homey and I loved it. So I def will try to be back for brunch or dinner.
2017-02-19,5,Was in NYC on business and went over to Hoboken to meet a friend for dinner.  Got there early so dived into Zack's for a drink whilst I killed time!Nice american bar.  The food menu looked great and a good selection of Beers, Lagers and IPAs available.  Prompt service and chilled vibes.  Will be visiting again for sure !
2017-01-15,5,Definitely some of the best bar food in Hoboken .. this place is a little off the main strip but worth the trip ..
2017-01-11,5,Great experience dining at Zack's on a double date.  We went on a Sunday night for dinner and both our server (Casey) and food were excellent.   We ordered steak sandwiches and burgers and both were great.  The atmosphere was casual and lively but not too loud.  Highly recommend Zacks.
2017-01-11,2,The place itself is really pretty and has a great ambiance, but the food was just bad. We came during their day menu which is pretty limited and went with the bec burger. Both my boyfriend and I were extremely disappointed. Our burgers had no flavor, and mine was burnt. The service was ok but she couldn't get our plates away from us fast enough! Maybe it's because my boyfriend and I are young, but that's no excuse. The place was fairly empty as well. Needless to say, I'd say skip out on this place during the day hours. Perhaps the dinner is better.
2017-01-02,5,I give this place five stars.From the get go my girlfriend and I were greeted and seated right away to our preference.We ordered a bottle of Pinot noir then had a salmon plate and the Willow steak sandwich. The salmon was better then the willow, but both were delicious. Great service on a packed night with great ambiance. For dessert we had the warm apple cobbler a la mode which was delicious and the right size to share. The tables all had a pink rose and candle to set the cozy, romantic scene. Some background music to set the scene but low enough for you to have a nice conversation. We had a wonderful date night and would return again. I give this place 5 starts because of the great combination of food, wine, atmosphere and service. I highly recommend this place.
2017-01-01,4,Good food, great service, and fairly decent wine selection. We enjoyed our dinner here but thought it could have been better for the price.
2016-12-18,5,Came here on a Sunday for some cocktails with my girl friends. The customer service was above and beyond. We sat in the bar area and the bartender, Kieran, was so friendly and always made sure we had full drinks and had everything we needed. The atmosphere was decorated nicely for Christmas and the music was festive as well. Definitely would come back!!!
2016-12-18,5,The vibe here is fantastic, and the service is on point. It's the first time in a long time I can say that the wait staff is attentive and just plain nice. Food is tasty and prices are reasonable. Great place for reliable food and service.
2016-12-18,5,I was a regular here for a couple of years.  Zack's is fantastic.  The owners are often around and really care about the place being run well.  All of the staff is friendly and there is a great atmosphere, especially with many regulars who become friends over time.  Great food with a rotating menu, great drinks, rotating craft beers.  I know this is weird to mention but I have a thing about bathrooms and theirs are great, always clean, always great smelling candles.  They do everything right, can't recommend this place enough.
2016-12-13,5,Zack's is incredible. From the service to the food to the ambiance and the prices. Very reasonable prices for the quality of food you get here. The stuffed chicken entrées is phenomenal! Seriously every time I come I say I'm gonna try something else but can't help but order the stuffed chicken. The banana bread pudding is easily the best dessert I've ever had. Came here recently for my anniversary and Casey was an amazing server.... He took our picture helped us choose a wine and was genuinely courteous and so so friendly. If you're even thinking about coming here. Do it. Get the stuffed chicken. Finish with banana bread pudding and you're set.
2016-12-12,5,We came out to have dinner in Hoboken on a Saturday night. Decided to checkout Zack's for a drink or two. The Bartender, Kieran was the Best. It was very busy and he kept smiling and our drinks were very delicious and perfect for the great dinner we had here at Zack's. Thank u so much Kieran for the Gr8ness. We will definitely be back.
2016-12-10,4,Came here for brunch and the selection was pretty solid. The boozy drink combinations were a plenty and the wait staff was very accommodating. I won't be back for brunch though, because there were just too many families with poorly behaved children. I know it's Hoboken, but it's also very much a bar, brunch or not, and being subjected to kid temper tantrums was just not the atmosphere for me.
2016-11-20,3,Came here for brunch on a Saturday. The service was great and there was no wait. I got the French toast and it was mediocre. The boyfriend got the breakfast burrito and thought it was average. The salsa that came with the burrito was definitely out of a jar which I can't stand.
2016-11-06,5,We needed to kill 30 minutes because our table wasn't ready next door so we stumbled across Zack's and it was quite a surprise. They were packed, but the man at the door welcomed us in. We sat at their busy bar for just a beer, but they were very attentive and friendly. The food that was being served looked great. We regret our dinner next door and so we are planning a trip back to Zack's. Will update.
2016-10-07,4,Good non-college town bar place to eat. Went with a buddy and got the fish tacos and shrimp po sandwich. My fish was so good I had to share it. Nachos were good nothing special and the dessert, banana bread was decent. So, all in all, good fish taco bar that isn't too loud from college kids.
2016-10-01,3,Came here on a Friday night. Took about 15-20 minutes for the waiter to come over and greet us. He was nice but when he finally did he blamed the host for the delay. We forgave it and ordered cocktails which were actually very good.That was best part of our meal. We tried the steak sandwich and the shrimp risotto. Both were fine but super bland. We left disappointed and out $80.We might give it another try since it's literally a block from our apt, but with all the other choices nearby, it might be a while.
2016-09-25,1,Not impressed. Just came in for a drink there were 7 in our party. The bartender was too busy chatting to listen to the entire order...bad service.
2016-09-05,5,I've eaten here a few times and it has yet to do me wrong. The staff is always really friendly and glad to give recommendations, and I've always been seated quickly with no fuss.Also, the brisket blend burger is legitimately one of the greatest burgers I've ever had. Seriously, it's incredible.The other food ranges from just fine to really tasty. I had a rare tuna special they had once with sundried tomatoes and asparagus on the side and it was absolutely delicious. Another time I had their steak sandwich and to be honest, it was a bit dry and probably could have used some kind of sauce to add a bit more flavor. Not bad, just really average.The cocktails are of similar quality - some really good and some just ok. Ask the servers for recommendations.Overall you can't go too wrong with Zack's, it's basically upscale-ish pub food at reasonable prices.
2016-08-28,4,I like Zack's, it's close, the food is good as well as the service. Today was the first time I ever had a problem, I got Eggs Benedict again, but this time the hollandaise tasted awful... Turns out it came from a jar.Please, stop doing that.
2016-08-16,5,Our bartender Mark was fantastic took the time to socialize and let us know what beers we would enjoy...especially based on hoppines. We will definitely be back.
2016-07-15,5,Been to Zacks several times and have never been disappointed.  If you like burgers you should try the brisket blend burger!
2016-07-14,4,Pretty good! Had the truffle fries as an appie and  crab cake sandwich and my two friends had the lentil/goat cheese salad. All delicious! Just didn't leave wanting to rave about it. Would still go back!
2016-07-10,4,Came here for brunch with some friends on a Sunday morning. There was no wait and you can choose to sit inside (with A/C) or outside. They have the standard brunch fare as well as burgers/wraps/pasta. Zack's also has a bunch of specials. I had the farmer's breakfast, eggs, sausage, home fries and bacon! Their coffee isn't bad, though they didn't offer refills. Overall, a great place to catch up with friends or bring kids!
2016-06-24,1,This used to be one of my favorite restaurants in town (the food was always on point) but the last 2 times I ate here have been awful. About a month ago I sat outside with a friend and the waitress got our order all wrong and the food seemed to be of lesser quality than I was used to. Wilted lettuce, less salad toppings. And last night I ordered takeout with my husband and my salad was terrible. The watermelon salad is described as having candied walnuts (the walnuts were not candied last night) and the chicken on top was chewy and a little pink. Clearly the chicken had been frozen and recooked, really not the level of food Zacks has always been known for. Disappointed and not sure I am willing to go back anytime soon.
2016-06-05,5,Best service, awesome drinks and great food. I had an amazing bartender by the name of Kieran. I strongly recommend asking for him when you come in.
2016-06-05,4,Just moved to the area and wanted to get some a very late brunch on a Saturday before they stopped serving at 3pm. Staff was incredibly friendly and very quick to accommodate us as we only had 30 minutes before they stopped serving brunch. My husband had the breakfast burrito and I had the grilled chicken sandwich and both of us thought the food was good for the price. I had the watermelon mojito which was made with fresh puree and was delicious. We really liked the vibe and will definitely come back to check it out again.
2016-05-30,4,I came to Zack's with a group of friends for dinner. We had reservations for 8:30pm (came to the resturant at 8:20pm) on a Friday night but unfortunately we were seated at 9:05pm. We were clearly upset and asked to speak to a manager. We spoke to someone and expressed our disappointment. He was very apologetic and indicated that he offered to buy us a first round of drinks. Beside this negative initial experience the rest of the night was great. The food came out exactly as we ordered it and was very good. The server was also very nice and attentive to our needs. I would highly recommend Zacks to anyone in the area. I will definitely try it again. Zack's lost a star for me because they did not honor the reservation.I would rate Zack's as follows: Food is 4 Stars, Service is 3 Stars (They lost one star for not honoring my reservations), Atmosphere is 3.5 Stars and Price is 4 Stars.The views expressed are of my own and are my true personal experience at this establishment. My personal experience may not reflect this actual establishment, their quality or someone else's experience at the establishment.
2016-05-21,5,We have only been here twice, both times with our young son. They are really nice people working there. Very kid friendly. The food is wonderful. If you ever get the chance to have the filet mignon on special, try it. Prices are great. Outdoor patio is our favorite. We ordered for our son the chicken tenders app, big pieces of chicken LIGHTLY breaded. Wonderful. Great wines as well. Too bad the location doesn't have more foot traffic because it should be packed at all times, personally speaking.
2016-05-17,5,Love this place! The food was good and service is amazing. They were also very accommodating of my cousin's last-minute party of over 20 people.
2016-05-11,4,Excellent ambience. I love the style of the bar. Feels classer than you would except but not so much so or in a way where you feel like you don't belong in there without a suit on. Tends to get crowded at the popular times. The food here is very good but the cocktails are the real star. They made one of the best manhattans I have ever had. Would recommend.
2016-05-04,5,This bar and grill is super consistent. The food and service are on par with their prices. We have consistently had great service.This bar seems to always have room when other places are packed. A great secret spot when you need a quieter night. Also good if you want a bar seat for a last minute sports event on TV.Their menu is full of winners. I especially love the French Cut Chicken and Brisket Blend Burger. Their weekend brunch menu is diverse enough to please a brunch-hater like me :)
2016-05-02,4,Cute bar and restaurant off of Washington Street.  The cheeseburger was perfectly cooked and came with crispy seasoned shoestring fries which were great.   The sunday pasta special was also really good!  Service was quick (almost a little too quick) but overall it was a really nice evening with friendly staff and good food. I would highly recommend.This is a great alternative restaurant to O'Nieals (less crowded/less noisy).
2016-04-29,4,I love Zack's!  More than just because they are down the street, but it's an adult feeling bar.  It has TVs, is clean and doesn't smell like stale beer, and has a great menu.  I've probably had 50% of the menu at this point, all very good.  The chicken sandwiches are great, and the brisket burger is very good (quite heavy on the cheese, though).  I love that their fries are not heavily salted as well.  One of the more surprisingly good items I've had is there lentil salad.  I'll keep coming back!
2016-04-28,4,I had a dinner with office team here.They were good on phone taking reservation; and the table was ready when we reached. I'm glad we'd made the reservation; it got crowded even on a weekday.They have decent choice of drinks at the bar, and serving time was pretty good - both at the bar (for those of us who'd reached before the reservation time), and at the table.Food choice was good. They offered to make veggie sandwiches that are offered on the lunch menu, even though it wasn't offered on the dinner menu. Service was good. Though food quality is not outstanding, it's pretty reasonable in this price range. Their french fries were really good. Dessert was so-so.Overall, I'd be happy to visit this place again.
2016-04-25,3,The service was excellent although the food was so-so. We ordered the pork sliders, calamari, goat cheese fritter salad, fish tacos and bread pudding. Out of the above would come back for only the tacos and bread pudding which was excellent.
2016-03-30,3,The place was clean and the staff was friendly. The food was good, but not very memorable. My friend and I had a pleasant enough experience.
2016-03-25,4,Came here for the second time with friends and everything was great! The service is awesome and there is a pretty varied menu. I had the lentil salad with salmon which was delicious, the truffle fries are awesome and the stuffed chicken is a must have! I'll be back again for the atmosphere as well. A great spot tucked farther back from Washington!!
2016-03-20,3,I come here every couple months wanting it to be something it's not. Getting the first glass of wine is never a problem but I try to hold in my need to walk out while waiting for a second glass. Even a little banter with the bartenders might be nice as I'm a single woman. My bill tonight was $75 in about and hour and a half and the bartender can't even look at me in the eye. The prices are too high to not feel taken care of. By the way I'm still waiting for the bartender to take my check so I can get out of here and drink cheaper down the street!!!
2016-03-17,4,Food: BWe got the bacon wrapped filet mignon and asparagus as an appetizer and it was delicious. The only thing was that it was a very small dish and it wasn't cheap. There were only two servings, which was fine for us, but if you have more people than that, I'd ask about the servings. For our entrees, we got the Brisket burger and the Willow. Both came with herb fries, which were thin and crispy, just how I like them. The willow was on point too - it was sliced steak with onions and mushrooms on ciabatta. I got mine medium rare, and it was a bitttt on the rare side so it was a little hard to eat in the sandwich. But I would much rather have it on the rare side than over cooked. Overall, the food was awesome and the total cost not bad at all for what we got.Service: BThe service here was great - the waiter was very attentive and super friendly, and the food came very quickly, which was great since we were starving. The waiter was on point, making sure to refill our drinks and ask how our food was and if we needed anything else. However, there was one thing that put me off, not about the waiter but about the host. When he had seated us, he simply put down our menus and said nothing. I noticed later that when he seated others, he told them the specials and made recommendations. I'm not sure whether it was because we looked a bit younger (we are in our early/mid twenties) or whether he had something else against us. He could've been in a rush with my table, but it would have been odd since we came when it was less busy.Ambiance: AThe atmosphere here was nice on a not too packed Wednesday night. It's a small restaurant, but the set up of the tables was just spacious enough that it didn't feel too crowded. Each table had its own (real) rose and (real) lit candle, which was a nice change. The lighting was not too dark, not too bright - great for a date. There's a full bar there as well.
2016-03-09,4,I stopped in pretty early last night, and grabbed one of the only empty seats at the bar.  I was greeted quickly with menus but then waited a bit to get a drink order in and bit longer to get a food order in. I realized after sitting there for an hour or two that it's because there is an odd mix of people that are serving the restaurant, the bar, playing hostess, taking to go orders via the phone and walk in's and doing a little bar back...like each of them are doing all of those things? Maybe that helps keep service moving, but I think it also led to a little confusion on who should be helping me. Regardless, everyone was very friendly and since I was at the end of the bar (near what would maybe be a service well in a different restaurant), I got to hear them all talking and working together. Everyone seemed like they were genuinely trying to get people seated in places that wouldn't be crowded and checking on orders, cleaning tables rapidly...so maybe the everyone does everything model works. The bartender started talking to me after the bar cleared out a bit and he was very friendly, making suggestions for my stay in Hoboken and even charged my phone!End my overly long description on that.  The food-- I was debating between the special salad of the evening, prime rib salad and one of their staple salads, the pear and avocado. One of the server/hostess ladies said the pear avocado was delicious so I went with that one, only I subbed the champagne vinaigrette for the goat cheese dressing.  I found the vinaigrette to be a perfect compliment to delicate butter lettuce and subtle flavors of the pear and avocado, I wonder if the goat cheese would be too overpowering... Anyway, great salad. I forgot to order my dressing on the side, but to my surprise it came out perfectly dressed. Like, exactly as I would have done it! I swear everyone wants their salad drowning in dressing, but this was perfect. It is pretty big, but I didn't add protein so it ended up being a perfect size for me.Tuesday's are half price wine, even the house ones, so I had a few glasses of a good pinot grigio for $3.50 each. Yes, $3.50. I'll definitely be back!
2016-03-06,5,I came here with a few of my friends. This place has amazing food and service. The drinks are strong and and the atmosphere is great.
2016-02-26,5,Okay, so the rating is on a Hoboken scale (which means it's tops for Hoboken but if it was compared to NYC, then it'd be a solid 4 stars).  This place is great and here is why:1) It's a restaurant with a bar - not a bar that serves food.  They care about the food they serve and they serve great food.  Some of our favorites are the Sheperd's Pie and the Short Ribs.  Both are absolutely delicious and very generous in sizing.2) Service is very fast.  Yes, the place does get more busy as it gets later in the evening and service slows down as they reach full capacity but if you're there at 7:30pm on a weeknight, your appetizers and your entrees will appear before you in record times.  3) It's not super loud so you can actually have a conversation.4) They do have a full bar so in addition to good food, they have plenty of drinks to go with dinner.  They have a good selection on draft and also plenty of specialty beers in bottle.
2016-02-21,3,Came here for dinner last night (Saturday night) with my lady. We've been wanting to try this place. I had come to this place for brunch in what seems like many moons ago but dinner never tried. We made a reservation shortly before we got there. I knew the place was small so figured we would need a ressy. Very accommodating. Sat us right away when we got in at a high top table near the bar. The place was loud (again small bar in Hoboken).  The waiter was very nice and accommodating. We ordered drinks and our meals. Fish tacos and the stuffed chicken. The waiter seemed to believe we ordered good stuff. I enjoyed both but have I had better meals. Yes. In Hoboken? Questionable. But the food was good not amazing. However when we ordered a side veggie that was not on menu the waiter said anything we wanted he would get. And he did. Again, very accommodating. There were some loud and obnoxious people. Surprising for 30-40 year olds. Sure. For Hoboken - expected. But I do not blame the establishment one bit. Overall I would come again.
2016-02-16,4,Good vibe good food. Wish they have more red wine choices. Ordered special for the day which was filet. Slightly surprised that the server never asked me how would i like my meat to cook but it turns great.
2016-02-15,5,Came back again this past weekend and had a great experience. Thomas was our bartender and he, along with the rest of the staff, was very friendly and personable. We ordered the truffle fries (again-too good to pass up), goat cheese wontons, the brisket burger and the sausage & provolone bites and everything was perfect!
2016-02-04,5,Zacks is a great local Hoboken spot. I go here a few times a month. Great for a date on a Friday or Saturday or a casual week night out. I've tried almost everything on the menu and never been disappointed. The owner is there on most weekend nights and will personally seat restaurant goers and check in that the meal is up to par. Also makes really good cocktails and has a nice craft brewery selection.  Highly recommend, overall good scene with great food and drink.  Different from the Hoboken frat crowd and that's what makes it so good.  Make sure to check it out and support a local business.Recommendations:Brisket blend burgerWillow sandwichSalmon entreeFish tacosStuffed chicken Most specialsTruffle friesSausage and provolone bitesKale saladArugula saladBuffalo wingsCrab cakesLiterally had the whole menu, can't go wrong. Eat here for good American food.
2016-02-01,4,Ate here over the weekend for brunch . Let me start by saying I am not a brunch guy. had the open face egg sandwhich. It was very good, but i cant give 5 stars based on an egg sandwich.i will be back to try dinner.
2016-01-18,4,I went to Zack's for the first time Saturday night with a group of 8 for my friends birthday. I got there early and the table was ready and the host allowed me to sit down. He was very friendly and welcoming and asked me if I wanted a drink. I ordered Zack's cocktail which was delicious. My friends came and the waiter was alert and waited on us right away. We ordered the Mac & cheese as an appetizer which was really good and calamari which was ok, a little spicy for me. I ordered the salmon for dinner, it was very tasty! They brought out dessert with a candle for my friends birthday. We had a very enjoyable time. Great atmosphere. Great staff. Would definitely go back!
2016-01-13,5,Zack's is great. The drinks are very strong and the food is really good. I had the breaded chicken stuffed with asparagus which came with mashed potatoes- I would definitely have that again! And the brownie dessert was delicious and came with ice cream on top.Also I went this past Tuesday and wine by the glass and by the bottle were both half price. Can't beat that!Also the service is very attentive and polite and the bathrooms are very nice and clean!
2016-01-12,5,One of my favorite brunch spots in Hoboken by far! Just moved here a few months ago, Went on a Saturday morning w a friend for brunch. Amazing and decently priced for the quality of food. Would go back in a heartbeat
2016-01-10,5,One of my favorite dinner spots in Hoboken. The food, atmosphere, and service is superb. I typically order the stuffed chicken or the penne.
2016-01-04,5,A must-go American Restaurant by the other side of the river. Food: 5/5Value: 4/5Service: 5/5 Ambiance: 5/5Decor: 4/5Space: 4/5 Wait: 5/5 (Call to make reservation - it can get crowded)Bathroom: 5/5Crab Cake Sandwich - YES YESBrisket Blend Burger - YESMonroe - YESTruffle Oil Fries - YESThe food was amazing! Often times I felt that American cuisine overcooks their ingredients and then covers with oil and cheese to hide the flaws but Not Zack's! The meats tasted fresh, tender, and juicy! I was pleasantly surprised by the pop of flavors here and there using pickled vegetable or ... beer sauce? hm???? If you are a fan of crab cake, you are in for a treat - It was cooked to perfection, slightly crispy on the outside, soft and aromatic center, and the taste? Totally hit the spot.A big family? A big group? Having trouble booking for a table last minute? Well look no further - Zack's was unbelievably accommodating. We called for a table of 7 and then we arrived early, still they were happily making the arrangement (we have tried to call several other places and no-go once they heard the number 7). Just about coming to the end of the meal. one of the party members wrapped a valuable object in napkin and was taken away like trash (our fault) but our waitress retrieved the object for us (from the trash bin??) without any mumbling or complaints at all. The bathroom is located at the far end where there is no light or sign but once you find you way in, you are welcomed by the gentle floral candle scented space, clean and relaxing without being too dim or crammed.
2015-12-29,5,This place is our favorite "pre-game" place!  The menu has something for everyone and the atmosphere is friendly. The wait staff are all good but we always ask for Karl if he's on that night!
2015-12-27,4,This is one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants in Hoboken. Great atmosphere with friendly and attentive staff. Menu is small, but includes a pretty good variety of options for all tastes and daily specials. Great place for classic, American food. Would definitely recommend the Brisket Burger...might be the best burger in Hoboken!
2015-12-18,5,My Fiancé and I love this place. We came here on the night we got engaged and the food was incredible. It has become a regular place for us and every time we eat here, the owner is always there and super friendly. I don't write a lot of reviews, but I have to recommend this place as one of my favorite places in Hoboken to eat.
2015-12-12,2,I give this place two stars 1- for the genuine attempt the new waiter made he didn't know what he was doing and I felt bad no one helped him. 2nd- the place is nice and has a good set up. Otherwise it's not great. Been here about 10times usually for a cocktail. Nothing special it is close to my commute from the bus so it's easy to grab a drink walking home. The bartenders seem to be a little arrogant .. I asked after work one day around 6ish (just moved to area and an obvious new customer in work attire) if there was a happy hour and he laughed and said "haha no.. Try Washington" I was pretty taken back. The drinks are all pricey so I guess they dont care. It's not a welcoming feel it seems like the bartenders are career bar keeps and that's fine but they are rude and not happy ever. I bartended for 10yrs it's hard work but was also nice.Anyways went for brunch today. The new waiter took my order. Coffee Bloody Mary and eggs bene with cheese and instead of Canadian bacon which I don't like I ask for well done ham-Taylor ham-or bacon. Well the order came out before the coffee. No cheese with Canadian bacon pretty much rare.. The hollandaise sauce  was also the worst I have ever had .. (Bad batch or something).The waiter said I guess they don't have the other meats u asked for sorry .. I said no cheese also ? He took it back and they put two square out of the wrapper cheese pieces on top and didn't melt it at all .. I took a bite pushed it forward .. Left 30$ and walked away ... Feel bad for the waiter he had no direction. In a good restaurant if food goes back the manager or expo better take the lead and never let it go out like garbage. He was trying hard and was nice but the over all management failed him. Sorry will not be back ... And I'm sure the arrogance that exists will not care at all .. Based on my experiences at this place they only want regulars who are in love with them. It's a shame because it is a nice setup and location. They service management truly lacks tack and or an appreciation for new business or quality of food that goes out.
2015-12-12,3,Love this place!  Great food at a reasonable price.  Not a loud drunken dive bar.  This is another local neighborhood gem that caters to couples.   Warm atmosphere, great service and a relaxing time.
2015-12-08,5,Great foodThe stuffed chicken might be the best meal I've ever eatenBurgers r real good tooService is good as well
2015-11-25,5,This is my go to spot. Whenever i am hungry i think of Zaks. They are a guarantee for an awesome meal and great atmosphere. Mark and Sheila are wonderful people who have employed an special staff. Ask for John or Karl when your there and they will make sure you are well taken care of. Also check out their daily specials, they are dynomiteeee!!
2015-11-20,5,Overall a good bar and restaurant. The interior is nice, food is pretty good, very good beer and whiskey collection. Good spot to go for lunch at the weekend and have a few pints.They also give back to the community, with their annual Thanksgiving event for families in need
2015-10-27,2,I ordered the short ribs last Wednesday and had diarrhea for 3 days. Not sure what is going on with their kitchen staff and if food was not cooked or stored properly. Would not recommend this entree.
2015-10-25,5,Came here for brunch.. The atmosphere is really nice... I ordered the breakfast burrito which was great! My friends got the beef brisket burger and it was soo good! The fries were amazing too!
2015-10-12,5,I love this place. I love getting their steak and Cobb salad.  The salmon is unbelievable, my son loves their burgers and I have never tried their nachos but every time I see them come out I go nuts looking at them. The service is great, the consistency is unbelievable and they have tons of draft beers on tap and great wines.  The best value for your dollar. I probably eat here 4 or 5 times a week with my family. My favorite thing about the restaurant is that the decor,  dark wood, sharp and clean and I believe the bar itself is from the late 1800s. Definitely one of Hoboken's best little restaurants!
2015-10-10,4,This is by far the best restaurant I have visited in Hoboken. The shepherd's pie was delicious, and the brownie a la mode I had for dessert was delightful. The service was also on point. I just wish they offered a basket of bread before the meal. Other than that it was perfect.
2015-10-09,4,Zack's hits the right notes (or at least that notes right-enough) that it keeps us coming back.The nacho's are exceptional deal ($10), and I've been pleased with almost everything I've ordered.  The beer selection is somewhat small (I like to stop by Cork City first, when I can pull that off).  Service is great.  If something is wrong with your order, they fix it fast.  (In fact, I don't recall another restaurants resolving issues so quickly/easily.)Zack's is comfortable in its skin.  It does what it does well, and doesn't try to be something it isn't.  I recommend a visit (or two or three)...
2015-09-28,4,Definitely on my top 5 favorite restaurants in Hoboken list, it is consistently good.  The things I love on the menu are the nachos and the brisket burger. The wings have a great sauce but I sometimes find that the wings have more fat than meat on them.  For brunch I love their avocado toast.  Good atmosphere, cozy and intimate.
2015-09-28,3,I very much enjoyed the food and it was a great place to take my friend before she headed back home. This was my first time here and I am sad to say I was slightly disappointed. Not because of the food, but because of my service. It wasn't bad, I just wish the server was a little more attentive. All of our meals were amazing and I encourage everyone to try the stuffed chicken, it had the most amazing flavor. I am voting that next time I go the service will be better so I can give this place the rating it deserves!
2015-09-07,5,Quality spot overall, a hidden gem off the strip that's worth the trip! Pros:1. Food is yummy! Stuffed chicken has a good sauce, branzino special is great, short ribs and steak are great, nachos are even good too.2. Outdoor seating is nice and quiet on Willow, except maybe a couple ambulances from the nearby hospital.3. Service is good and attentive.4. Wines are good, we haven't had a bad one yet, and bottle prices are decent.5. Good value, I think the most expensive entrée is $22 for a steak, so not bad.6. Pasta specials vary each day of the week which is nice.Cons:1. Small and can get crowded and they seat you on top of each other sometimes, like New York city.
2015-08-27,4,I've been here a couple of times and it has become one of the restaurants I can rely on for good atmosphere, great food and delicious drinks in Hoboken, without the hustle and bustle of being on Washington Street. Zack's is tucked away on the corner of 3rd and Willow, which can help explain the relaxed ambiance inside. The service is always friendly and attentive, albeit a little slow at times. Cocktails like the Vodka Thyme Lemonade and White Sangria are always on point in addition to their collections of whiskeys, bourbons, craft beers and wine. I've had a little bit of everything from their menu and nothing has been shy of great.APPS: The Fried Calamari appetizer has a great kick to it from the cajun seasoning, the Truffle Fries are good (but served with ketchup? Should be with one of the aioli sauces for sure), and the nachos are piled high with flavorful layers of chili, cheese, salsas and all the extra good stuff. ENTREES: The Penne Vodka and Stuffed Chicken are among some of the house specialties. The salads are of substantial size and perfectly dressed; my favorite is with Pear & Avocado with an additional protein. Early in the summer I had a Scallop special, which had asparagus, corn and tomato and it was a perfectly executed summer dish. The Steak n Fries is also a classic, done very well. I can't comment on brunch, but I imagine it being equally as enjoyable as dinner has been for me.
