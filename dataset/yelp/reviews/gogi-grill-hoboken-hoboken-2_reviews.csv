2021-11-03,1,Im korean and this has to be the worst korean fusion place i ever ordered at. The tofu soup is nothing close to a soondubu soup and the kimchee bowls have little to no kimchee and they give you the end piece of the kimchee where you cant even eat!!! The bacon, is just thick pork they use for another dish. The chicken tenders had no sauce on them and tasted bland. Wont recommend or go eat here again
2021-11-01,3,The bowl is average, toppings are a little all over the place in terms of flavor. Didn't really taste much korean flavor
2021-09-21,4,Ordered through grubhub.I ordered the vegetarian bowl. I liked the option for customisation. The ingredients were fresh and bowl was filling. I love Korean food!
2021-09-11,4,Had dinner here with some friends, the food was great and portions were large. I had soy garlic wings, very tender and flavorful. I tried some of my friend's bulgogi bowl as well, it was very fresh and savory. Lastly I had a strawberry matcha bubble tea which was sweet and refreshing, a good desert to end with.
2021-07-28,1,I used to come here all the time. Just went on Monday and was disappointed. Paid $13 for a bowl and received 4  cubes of chicken. I asked for double spinach and didn't even receive single spinach. I think it was the owner or manager who made my bowl. Trying to save pennies, they lost a customer.  And the chicken was dry dry.
2021-07-23,1,Never got to try it out! DoorDash kept changing drivers. Then, after an hour and 15 minutes, our order got canceled. ‍
2021-06-26,4,I picked up some food from Gogi Grill on Friday around 6:30pm. They sell bubble tea and they have a couple of seats outside on the sidewalk.I got a bulgogi bowl with vermicelli, and my friend got a a spicy chicken bowl with purple rice. The bowls were very filling, and the vegetables all tasted very fresh. You can pick up to four toppings, and you can also get sesame seeds and/or seaweed on top. The bulgogi itself was sweet and pretty average. I would recommend stopping by if you're looking for some food to pick up!
2021-06-18,4,Good quality ingredients and portions! The food was fresh and very filling. I like the customization such that you can be as healthy or unhealthy as you want.The spicy chicken and galbi was a little sweet for my taste. And got too much sauce. The shrimp was rather bland. Vegetables were standard, freshly prepared.Good quick lunch overall.
2021-06-17,1,We ordered through DoorDash. The food is okay but the packaging is HORRIBLE. The paper bags have staples EVERYWHERE including bag handles. My husband and I both injured our hands by taking the bags. Understanding the purposes, they should consider customers' safety in the first place. Will NEVER order from this place and will NEVER recommend to anyone.Purely stupid packaging.
2021-05-19,5,I really like this place and the food is fantastic every time I order. The one thing that irked me tonight was that the vegetable dumplings had pork in it. No mention of that on the menu AT ALL. Luckily, I had the first bite and not my vegetarian partner. While the dumplings ended up being delicious, you should really note if a vegetable dumpling has meat in it.**EDIT/UPDATE** I ordered through Caviar, which did not mention the pork in the veggie dumplings but I do see it mentioned on the menu listed on Yelp.
2021-05-13,1,Came here last night to order takeout. My roommate placed her order and then proceeded to order bubble tea at the opposite counter while we waited for the food to be prepared. We were the ONLY two people in the store (standing right in the middle, 2 feet away from either counter) who weren't workers when another two customers walk in to order their food. We waited a while for the food when my roommate approached the counter again asking about her order when she was told that they accidentally gave her two items to the previous customer. She then had to reorder everything and we had to wait again, which sucked because I had to be somewhere and this was supposed to be a quick stop. I'm not sure how you can have only two sets of customers at a time and make a mistake like that.
2021-05-02,4,It's been 2 years I've been wanting to try this place and I finally got to. It was very good I got the Korean friend rice with spicy chicken. Everything was tasteful but the chicken was a little too spicy for me. Maybe because I got Sriracha sour cream on top as well but very good. My friend got the short rib and it was very juice and tender. Will deff go back !!
2021-03-21,5,I would definitely recommend Gogi Grill for a quick meal! The food here is great! They have so many options. You can choose from a bowl, burrito, or taco. I decided to get the bowl with chicken, fried rice, cucumber, carrots, and corn. You can get up to 4 sides. Everything was tasty and they served a good amount of food. The staff is very nice and welcoming. The place was clean and they are taking Covid-19 precautions by spacing out the tables they have and wearing masks. I also enjoyed the music they played. Honestly felt like a DJ was controlling it!
2021-03-14,4,ordered this through doordash!I ordered the kitchen sink combo which I shared with my fiance. lots of food packed in this big combo bowl and they are pretty fair with the portions for the price.we also ordered a set of 3 bulgogi tacos which were just the tortilla and bulgogi and no other toppings inside which I was surprised about. kimcheese tots were okI think it was pretty standard korean food, but it tastes good! the cilantro lime sauce though was a hit, we used that sauce on everything!
2021-02-11,5,Great restaurant, great taste!!Portion of their bowl is good. Don't forget to try their green sauce. Very delicious!!!
2021-01-30,5,Best "bowl" joint of all time. Everything they serve is delicious!
2021-01-27,1,I ordered plenty of times from here to find out that they decided to change the quality of the Galbi meat. It is extremely upsetting when the Galbi is dry and looks like they scraped together what they can to just send the order. Just take a look at the picture and tell me if it's edible. No. I won't be ordering from here and it is extremely disappointing since their sides is very good.
2021-01-04,4,Solid Korean food! I have gone here a few times and walked in to order. Each time I've gotten a different bowl and enjoyed the food, especially the jap chae. If you like spicy food, their kimchi is also good.
2020-10-11,2,The food is great and the portions are hefty. My boyfriend and I used to love ordering from Gogi Grill a while ago. Some time ago, we went through a phase of getting it weekly, however, we started having issues with the delivery of it. Something was always missing--whether it be an add on sauce that we paid extra for or a topping. This turned us off from ordering for a while because we'd pay extra for these things and would not receive them the majority of the time. A couple weeks back, we placed a delivery order and were reminded of why we loved Gogi Grill so much. All was good. We then ordered again and unfortunately, the extra sauce we ordered was missing. We were hopeful and tried again last week and this time a sauce and our favorite topping was missing. I decided to write this review because I'd love to order from Gogi Grill more consecutively, but the deliver service of it is so inconsistent that it turns me off. I never know if my order will be fully correct or if something will be missing. I end up grumpily eating a dried/sauce-less chicken bowl or missing my beloved noodles! It is quite frustrating when it happens often! Gogi Grill, please fix this!! I love your bowls and would love to order delivery from you more often!Edit:I ordered delivery yesterday and was hopeful my order would be fine. This time, I got sent the wrong order and was not able to get my food. The restaurant tried fixing the issue, they let me keep the wrong order, Grubhub refunded me, but I wasn't able to reorder because the restaurant closed at 9PM. It looks like I'll be staying away from Gogi Grill again.
2020-09-25,5,Best fast casual in hoboken. Fresh veggies and high quality ingredients. Lots of choices. Like a Korean fresher better version of Chipotle.
2020-09-24,3,I usually order through Uber Eats and while I enjoy the food, my order is consistently wrong.  No matter what rice I order, I always get white. Putting that to the side, it's just okay.  The bulgogi is always too dry so I would not recommend it.  I like the choice of toppings and they are always good and fresh, but the beef leaves a lot to be desired.
2020-09-11,4,Overall I had a positive experience with my meal from Gogi Grill. I got the dor sot bibimbop, i'm sure my spelling is off but it is the bibimbap in a stone bowl. Food was very fresh and delicious. Downside was delivery was on the slower side. However I would say it is worth stopping in or getting takeout as the food was up to snuff.
2020-08-30,2,I really, really wanted to like this place, since this is the only place in Hoboken where you can get a fix for Korean food. But nope... The meat has always been constantly dry and flavorless, the rice is always rock hard and compared to this other Chipotle style Korean place in Manhattan, it's just underwhelming. :(
2020-08-14,3,This place is rationing so badly!  For $11 a bowl the 4 sides they give is so skimpy.... not sure why they are serving food if they don't want to let go of it!  It's extremely unwelcoming and makes you think many times before coming here.  Happened two times previously but this time after having my bowl I am looking in my fridge for more food :(you will get more for your money elsewhere.
2020-07-18,2,Food is okay. Not much given. Bubble tea is terrible and small and full of ice. You really shouldn't waste your money here. Hopefully this restaurant turns itself around. Idk why it had so many good reviews. I had the spicy chicken bowl and I had the brown sugar milk tea.
2020-07-01,5,I love this place the food is great -  I hate the Chownow Service they recommend for delivery
2020-06-29,4,I wouldn't call it the most authentic Korean food in the world but if you are craving something Korean and casual, it's not a bad choice. I wish it's a little bigger option and more veggies but that's just my preference when it comes to Korean food.
2020-06-16,4,Had no issue using Groupon but did pay up charge for something. Overall tasty (I got the shrimp and hubby got beef I think) and filling but I'm not sure I'd pay full price for it because it didn't taste as fresh as I would have expected. Will give em another shot in the future maybe
2020-04-20,4,The food is amazing, but if ordering online, if you have dietary restrictions or need modifications to your order, I suggest you call to make sure they follow the modifications on top of typing it in. Anytime I've ordered from them online requesting the sauce on the side, they have not done that. If I call them to tell them about the modification, they follow it. They did say that they always put the sauce on the side, but that is clearly not the case.
2020-03-15,3,Made my own bowl with a lot of toppings. Like how flexible of the selections. It came in a good portion and Korean hot sauce. Overall not bad.
2020-03-14,1,The worst place in Hoboken. Food is terrible. Service is terrible. Staff is rude and not helpful at all. Go to the city if you want this type of food.
2020-02-27,2,Huge fan of Korean BBQ when done right, but this place unfortunately didn't deliver. Usually suspects of rice, kimchi, carrots and cucumber all were okay, but for an additional $3 they charge for short rib, it was dry and flavorless (as if left out allday). Very disappointing, will not be back!
2020-02-24,5,Gogi Grill im craving you!!!!!!!! I first tried this place in NY and became hooked. While in Hoboken I came across and decided to have lunch. I can come here over and over again. The staff was pleasant and the food was on point. I cant way to go back.
2020-01-13,2,Found a hair in my spicy chicken bowl and was sick to my stomach instantly. Upon calling the restaurant for a refund on my order, the manager on shift only refunded me for one bowl although both bowls(2) had spicy chicken.. "hair only fell on one bowl so I can only refund you for one". Well what will you make you think I'll find the other bowl appetizing now?
2020-01-04,1,Absolutely awful! The people that run this place are rude, don't care, and treat clients like garbage. We ordered food at 6:40 and after 2:30 hours, 15 phone calls and 3 loud arguments we got cold food.Don't ever order from here. Pick up if you're ok with rude people serving you. And good luck!!!!
2019-12-14,1,Wouldn't allow us to redeem our Groupon certificate despite having a printed voucher and the instructions were clear you could redeem it accordingly. Sold out on many of its options. Won't be back!
2019-12-03,3,I met with a friend for a quick dinner near Hoboken Station. I read the other reviews to find out there was a Groupon for $12 for any bowl and a drink (good deal, although your drink options are very limited). FOOD: I got a bowl with purple rice, Galbi (rib eye beef), butter kimchi, romaine lettuce, garlic corn, and sautéed onions. I got the spicy sauce as my sauce. It was okay. I thought the Galbi was under flavored and generally underwhelming. The spicy sauce was pretty good, flavorful and not too spicy. I would probably get the spinach as a topping next time. AMBIANCE: Fast casual where they make it for you and then you pay and serve yourself, like Chipotle. Decent space and a good amount of seating. The place was empty when I got there. SERVICE: I was served promptly but the person working clearly didn't really want to be there. OVERALL: Meh. Nothing to really write home about. Edible but definitely not noteworthy. But well priced with a Groupon!
2019-11-25,1,WATCH OUT. If you purchased the Groupon, beware of false advertising. I was charged for ordering the galbi even though I didn't know about it. The fine print of the Groupon does not state this at all so I purchased the Groupon thinking I could order the galbi. However, once I got to the restaurant, I was charged for order it. If I knew about this BEFORE I purchased the Groupon, I wouldn't have purchased it.
2019-11-25,1,Experience:Came here with a Groupon thinking it was a steal but they just slap a notice on the counter with limitations on what you can get! This should be on the Groupon itself! They use Groupon to get customers just to do the switch and bait. I ended up paying extra to get what I wanted and the bowl isn't even full. The workers just shrugged and said that's the bosses policy and they just didn't really care. After getting my food, I hear them talking about me in spanish and that's just rude. Never coming back!Food:The galbi is not as tender as it used to be. It is much more tough and clearly not marinated as long. The portions are less and they put way too much sauce. Overall, disappointing!
2019-11-25,3,I admit I had mixed feelings about Gogi Grill.  I love Korean food, so I was intrigued by the opportunity to get a quick meal with those flavors in my neighborhood.  However, something about its location near the Path, fast-food environment, and college kid crowd made me hesitant to give it a fair shot.  But, after an evening of whisky tasting and only a small amount of food to absorb the alcohol, my boyfriend asked if I would be open to splitting a burrito from GG.  Since we would be sharing the meal, I figured that it was the ideal time to try the place.  We walked in and were "greeted" by a young kid that seemed completely disinterested in serving us.  The ingredients in front of him looked rather dried out, but, granted, it was around 9:00 pm.  The kitchen actually looked pretty spotless, so at least that was reassuring.  As we had agreed, we decided to skip the bowl, salad, and taco options and order a burrito instead.  The 12" wrap seemed like a massive start, but my companion warned me that the burrito would be even more substantial after it was filled.  In terms of the add-ins, we used Sweet Potato Vermicelli as the base.  The glass noodles had been made from sweet potato flour and stir-fried in soy sauce and sesame oil.  We then opted for the Bulgogi Beef ribeye and its sweet marinade as our protein.  From there, we were allowed to select 4 other toppings, most of which were either some form of kimchi or a vegetable seasoned with sesame oil.  We went with sliced Carrots, garlic Corn, julienned Zucchini and Yellow Squash, and seasoned Bean Sprouts.  Lastly, we had Gochujang Red Pepper Sauce squirted over the mixture before it was tightly wrapped.  We went home to break into the burrito, and I was shocked at how flavorful it really was.  The meat had thoroughly absorbed its marinade, leaving it garlicky and well-seasoned.  The vegetables added a substantial crunch; the long noodle strands were perfectly cooked; and the spicy sauce added heat.  So, while the ingredients did not seem the freshest at the late hour, they sure tasted great.  I was happy that I had succumbed to my curiosity and given Gogi Grill a try.   I then had a better understanding of why people enjoyed it so much.
2019-11-10,5,Had two tofu rice bowls delivered for dinner last night and they were delish! We were craving vegetarian bibimbap and Gogi Grill made it happen. Highly recommend.
2019-10-31,1,Don't order from here.At least act like you care when my order is running super late, I called and got a deadpan "what about it?" Response Better yet, make sure the order is correct, because it wasn't. Conclusion: I was left with food I couldn't even eat almost 2 hrs later.
2019-10-18,5,This place actually surprised me!  I wasn't expecting the food to be as yummy as it was....the bowls are packed with tons of options and the Korean BQQ idea is a new twist when I'm tapped on chipotle.  You will not be disappointed at all!
2019-09-07,2,It's just okay. Can the kimchi fried rice be actually kimchi fried rice? Not soy sauce drizzled rice without kimchi? Or else it should just be called soy sauce rice!Service is pretty slow. Portions are small and only 4 toppings with the smallest grabs. Not worth it for the price. Quality and flavor just wasn't there. Didn't taste Korean at all...the bowl looks pretty sad too.
2019-09-05,5,Never had an issue with this place - super close to the path station and has both outside/inside seating. I love how they serve kimchi fried rice as part of their base, which they make on the spot after requested and they have a solid toppings selection. Their portions are huge, def bang for the buck.
2019-08-31,5,This place is so good. I often uber eats from here but also stop by from time to time for kimchitots! The place is always kind of empty but they have some outside seating. The location is super close to the Hoboken station, and pretty convenient!
2019-08-22,4,The food was pretty good. Its not GREAT Korean food, but it does the job.
2019-08-16,4,Hidden spot only found because of yelp ;) the seasoning and flavors were very tame compared to Korean standards but the menu is simple enough and the flavors are well balanced. The staff is friendly and it's a great spot for lunch or you take it to the park down the street. For quick bite this is great. Best part? Kimchi actually tastes authentic.
2019-08-13,4,So tasty Get Short rib it's way better than bulgogiLove the vegetables you can addQuality korean food without having to waitExcited to come back
2019-08-11,5,This place is truly a hidden gem and should be on the main streets of hoboken. It was so good i tried the purple rice with spicy chicken, corn, lettuce,carrots, and onions which was so good. I got the cilantro sauce and ugh next time I'll definitely pay for extra because it truly was delicious! I'll definitely go back for another bowl and I'm happy to see they deliver! Also the staff is very welcoming and kind which is always a plus!
2019-08-11,5,I've ordered delivery from here twice, and the food was delicious. Got a beef bowl both of those times, and had the kimchi tots once (a must try -- it has cheese and kimchi and tots. Sounds weird but it's GOOD). Today, a friend and I used our Groupon deals and visited in person. The staff were so nice and friendly! They were generous with the serving portions, too! This time, I chose a shrimp bowl -- the shrimp had a yummy smoky, grilled flavor.
2019-07-25,1,I ordered Goji Grill through seamless, I believe my order from Goji is what gave me food poisoning. The food itself was okay, if not a bit cold (but that's delivery). More concerning was the post meal reaction. Do not recommend
2019-07-22,3,Service is ALWAYS poor. Food is good. Service is so poor though it deserves 2.5 stars. Let's start with the food... it's great and tasty! The bulgogi tacos are what I always get and it's always cooked with nice texture and flavor. They have so many toppings and sauces to choose from in a similar style of chipotle. You can build your own order so you can customize it as much as you want. Their kimchi tater tots are a my guilty pleasure. So yummy and filling. The food is just plain good and at a competitive price. The only issue is service. Not that any of the staff here is rude or mean whatsoever. The problem is the lack of competency. It's like they're not being trained well. EVERY SINGLE TIME I've come here I've had issues with them overcharging, forgetting my items in my order, or them not knowing what's on their menu. Not to mention if you order from here be prepared to wait a while. The place is designed like a chipotle but doesn't run efficiently. Service is super slow. For instance the most recent time I went, I ordered the 3 for $11 tacos and $6 kimchi tots. The staff rang me up to $31. I tell the staff that math doesn't add up. He then tells me that it's because the tacos are $11 each not 3 for $11. This doesn't make any sense. I point him to the menu and he re-reads it. He's even more confused. Another staff member steps in to help and recognizes the problem. Confusion ensues because they've already totaled my bill to be $31 and now the computer won't correct. OR the time I ordered and they forgot half my meal. OR the time I asked for kimchi and staff had no idea what kimchi was even though it's supposed to a Korean restaurant. To wrap everything up. The food is great, service not so great. This seems like it could improve with better staff training. I keep coming back because the food. But it's really not worth the hassle sometimes.
2019-07-07,1,I used to go to Gogi Grill 1-2 times a week. I was obsessed until...I brought one of my friends from out of town for a quick dinner. As we ate our meals, I told her mine tasted a bit off compared to normal, but I kept eating. Later that night, we were both horribly sick with food poisoning and I continued to vomit all the next day. After speaking with some friends who have also eaten there, they all had similar experiences. I always loved the food but I'll never go back and risk food poisoning again.
2019-06-23,5,This is the first time me and my girl friend tried this place.If you generally like Korean BBQ this places items are amazing to have everything in the bowl.And STEVEN is the man make my and my girl friend's day better. He is super friendly , helpful and funny. Amazing guy.Highly recommending this place and Steven :):)
2019-06-06,4,Good place to go if you're starving and want a quick bite. Had the purple rice with beef bulgogi. Their brown sauce could use a little improvement, but other than that, yum!
2019-05-27,1,Update to the update. i've ordered from this place 3x and each time the delivery has been 1.5 hour wait. I'm currently waiting for my order which has STILL not come (912PM now, ordered 740PM). Not sure why they keep sticking to their current delivery service, which you have to pay $2.99 for. Not worth the time!
2019-05-26,4,We ended up at Gogi Grill one late Sunday afternoon after day-long household chores on an empty stomach. We had bowls. Loved the spinach, radish and tofu. Cucumber Kimchi and sprouts were okay. Pros:-- Delicious and healthy (depending on carbs etc that you choose)-- Value for money -- Nice variation from the usual bowls available -- Helpful staffCons:-- The rice serving is disproportionately large but you can always ask the staff in advance for small serving
2019-05-21,4,Huge portions and good food. The service was great. Food: 3.5/5Service : 5/5Price: 5/5Overall good experience.
2019-05-18,1,Delivery is insane here. They took 1 and a half hour to deliver, didnt know where their driver was, delivered cold food and offered me 20% off my next order as compensation. Insane.
2019-05-12,2,First time I ordered here was online. Food was good and adequate proportion for the price. However, the driver got lost when based on google maps, the drive is around 14 minutes if you know where you're going. Since the driver got lost, he mentioned that the delivery place is far. I did not complain about that incident. Fast forward to today, 2nd time I ordered online, I got a call from the restaurant saying that the delivery was on the way. I thought it was a little odd since I just ordered but I let it go. Then I get a call from Yelp a few minutes after that my order has been cancelled. It's all a little confusing whether it's the restaurant's fault or Yelp and I'm wondering if that was also connected to the first delivery. In any case just clarify the area that you deliver to and maybe using google maps should help the delivery person.
2019-05-05,1,If I could give zero stars I would. My delivery was supposed to arrive an hour ago. The person on the phone does know where the order is. When I called, I requested to talk to the manager. The manager never called back. I need my money back since the food isn't here. NEVER order online delivery. (I ordered through the website as I was unable to order through Yelp...).I also tried calling back multiple times to follow up. No voicemail option. They never answered. This is unacceptable. It is a SCAM for all I know.Ok fast forward an hour and a half later than the expected delivery time. The food came. But it was cold. And they didn't follow my instructions to put the free toppings on the side. So my seaweed was soggy.
2019-04-25,5,Was so so happy to find out there's a NJ location! I had it in NYC and I never really had the time to make that commute back there. But Hobo is closer to home!
2019-03-25,4,We got take out last night and i had the bulgogi and my husband had the kalbi. We also got the kimchi totters. They were both delicious. They are also very generous with the dish sizes for the price. I didn't like the teriyaki sauce as much as it's a bit on the sweeter side. The Kalbi definitely tasted more moist and tender then the bulgogi. The kimchi was a bit spicier than I can take it but it was quite authentic. It's quite an interesting mixture of the cheese and kimchi on the totter but then it made it more soggier than the crispy flavor it originally had. I think maybe it would've tasted better if we had it there. Overall we did like it. I would try the chicken next time and hopefully it's not as spicy as I imagine it to be :)
2019-02-16,4,Pretty good casual eatery. I had their bowl with beef, spicy cabbage, spinach and carrots. Just walk up to the counter, pick out your protein and rice, add toppings, and go. The beef was sitting in one of those scoop out containers that are typically used for salad toppings, which I wasn't crazy about because sure enough when I sat down to eat the meat was a tad cold. The sauce options were nice though, restaurant was pretty clean, and the staff were friendly. I also liked their drink options in the fridge (Aloe Vera juices, plenty of healthy drink options). Price wasn't bad either. I'll be back again when I want a quick meal to take home.
2019-02-13,5,Gogi Grill is an amazing lunch spot in Hoboken! There are one or two other Korean lunch restaurants in Hoboken that are good for workdays (i.e., picking up lunch and taking it to the office), but Gogi is the best!I love that you can really customize your bowl at Gogi Grill. That is probably the biggest differentiator between Gogi Grill and the other Korean food lunch restaurants in Hoboken. Gogi Grill is cool because it is a fast casual "Chipotle style" restaurant, so you can pick and choose every single thing that goes in your bowl. The sweet potato japchae noodles are amazing! Sweet potato noodles are not a common option for workday lunch, so it's great to see that Gogi Grill offers this option. My favorite protein is the spicy chicken. Gogi Grill also has amazing kimchi!
2019-01-26,5,I've gotten delivery from here. They came quickly, the food was warm and the order was accurate. Also the food was excelllent. Would definitely order from again.
2019-01-21,2,WARNING : If you are someone use to REAL Korean food, stay away. This place will only disappoint & frustrate you. Not sure what all the hype is about this place, consider me spoiled I guess but I can honestly say never again. The chipotle style of serving food is not for every culture. The beef (bulgogi) was of poor quality and full of fat. Real bulgogi you can scoop up with a fork and eat with worry of biting into something rubbery. The other meat options do not look like it's made fresh, but rather Pre made and heated on a grill. This is just a sorry excuse of maximizing on the "Korean" trend that is hitting the US. Again, there are so many reviews with good ratings but those that enjoy real Korean BBQ will know what's up.
2019-01-17,5,This place has the best pineapple chicken with sesame seeds in Hoboken. If you are in the area give it a shot and make your own with the actual Gogi beef
2018-12-28,5,Whether I am looking for a light meal or starving, Gogi Grill is a go to. I work and live in the area, and always have to introduce new comers here, because it is consistent, flavorful. and spot on. The chain like food service, allows for quick and convenient ordering, and allows for a different selection every time. I have had salads to purple rice, to vermicelli noodles. I cannot complain. Addicted.
2018-12-27,3,Got the fried rice bowl with tofu for my protein. For my toppings I got the sautéed onions, cheese, zucchini, and carrots. I chose the spicy lime cilantro sauce. I enjoyed the texture of the tofu and taste of the onions and loved how giant the portion was, esp for the price of $10. But in terms of overall taste, a lot was left to be desired. The food felt dry and bland. The service was great- the staff was kind and polite. Just didn't find the food very enjoyable
2018-12-20,1,To go along with what John C said below me, this exact scenario has happened to me many many times. They have forgotten parts of my order, and when I call to ask if they can bring the forgotten parts, I am either laughed at or told the delivery person doesn't want to return. The customer service is terrible
2018-12-18,1,Terrible is an understatement. Ordered online and our email was not confirmed. Called them. They said we are just waiting on our driver, your food is ready- should be there in 15 minutes. 45 minutes rolls around, we call back. "let me call the driver and see where he is." They do not call back. We call back 15 minutes later. "He will be there in 6 minutes." 15 more minutes pass, we call back saying he has not arrived. She says "let me call the driver and leaves me on hold for 10 minutes, and never picks up. Call back again, offers a discount- (it has now been 2+ hours for food that should have arrived in 35.) I request a full refund as the food never came and she argued with me that she already gave a discount and couldnt offer a refund. I demanded to speak to manage, and finally got a refund, 3 hours later. TERRIBLE SERVICE.
2018-12-05,5,Gogi grill is like chipotle you go in get a bowl and tell them what you want in it but it's so much better. The quality of the food is great especially the short rib. Everything is FLAVOR PACKED so think carefully about your add ins or it could get overwhelming with flavor where it loses what actually makes it great. They have some plain vegetable add ins which I recommend to put some crunch into your bowl since a lot of the other ingredients are slaw or pickled style. I've never gotten delivery since I pass it on my way home, but they are super quick so I suggest just stopping in to get it super fresh.
2018-12-03,2,I normally go here after work to grab dinner. Today I came in and ordered my regular bowel with extra short ribs A Tall Hispanic guy greeted me after waiting and when asked what protein. I wanted I said "short ribs with extra meat" . He then continued to scoop scraps of meat and crumbs of the meat from bottom the container in my bowel . When I questioned him and told him I don't want crumbs of the meat and if he can get me some fresh short ribs . He said it's going to take to long to make it and I can't wait . So I should order something else.He should have informed me he didn't have enough meat to even serve one serving. I don't understand was he going serve me crumbs and charge me ? Such incompetent people with horrible customer service .
2018-12-02,3,Right in the heart of hoboken so horrible parking but totally worth it! Tried the crunchy dumplings which were $10 for 10 basically ... delicious i wish i had gotten more !however the staff was very young and extremely rude rushing me although there was no one in the restaurant... the cashier told me the total but i couldn't hear her when i asked her to repeat it she rolled her eyes and said it louder.. would come back for the food but the service is lacking
2018-11-21,2,Shockingly bad. Service left much to be desired. Nothing unforgivable but not nothing good either. The katsu sauce does not resemble katsu at all... It's like vinegary. The spicy slaw is also a big mistake. Oof.
2018-11-11,3,Sucks because I wanted to like Gogi Grill. I've actually ordered from here in the past, but yesterday's food was all of the following:- stale (the lime and cilantro sauce)- bland- dry... I mean rice and pieces of meat and dry kimchi. Like I could have been chewing on a microwaved dish. Anyone who's tried legit Korean fast food (if I can call it that) e.g. Koreana in university city or Olive bbq in Korea town nyc, knows what flavorful food tastes like. Gogi you ruined my dinner so badly I ordered in bbq from house of Que. Oh well.
2018-10-21,5,This place was great. The bowl they start with is huge. I got a salad with spicy chicken and nearly every topping. My server was awesome literally gave me like three scoops of chicken and didn't charge me for extra toppings (they're usually 0.75 cents more once you choose over 4) Just be sure to ask about about toppings- for instance I wasn't offered sesame seeds or nori but saw they had it so asked for it. also I wasn't told what the two different kimchi's were but apparently there's one spicy and one non. Recommend the cilantro jalapeño sauce for sure.
2018-10-02,5,This place is really good.  Just ordered take out, received it quickly, and loved it.  I ordered a burrito and a bowl- they are both delicious.  It's pretty easy to make most dishes vegan just have to be careful of butter, and mayo in certain things.  I will definitely order from Gogi Grill again!
2018-09-21,3,Ended up getting a refund but I didnt like how this was initially handled. Not willing to return
2018-08-27,3,I ordered the Combo #1 which comes with choice of protein, butter kimchi, pickled onions, and pickled cucumbers. Flavor of the meat and toppings are very good. BUT EXTREMELY cheap on the meat. I would say it is not a good value for what you pay for. I paid $14 for the bowl and it looked like I only received not even 1 oz of meat. And the rest was RICE For context, I regular weigh and track my daily food intake so I know what the proportions should look like.
2018-08-26,4,This was my first time visiting after hearing great reviews. I got the purple rice with beef, corn, onions, bean sprouts and one other thing that is slipping my mind. The place is cute and has outside seating which was great for the weather. The food was pretty good, I made my oven bowl but next time I think I'll go for one of the dignitaries bowls! I would recommend this place for sure the serving portions are so large! It's easily two meals. I'll definitely be back!
2018-08-24,5,Love their bowls, potion size is huuuuuge!!! Their cilantro lime sauce is to die for!!
2018-08-22,5,I ordered the spicy chicken bowl but I lost my photo. It is very good. I love the spicy of the chicken and the seaweed salad.
2018-08-12,4,The food was decent, the service was mediocre, but I didn't really have high expectations for this restaurant. If you want fast Korean-ish food with large portions, then go here. If you want delicious, authentic Korean food, go somewhere else. The staff was fairly nice, but they blasted the music and were screaming along to the music where I could barely hear the person across from me. More annoying than something that would prevent me from going again.
2018-07-29,2,Haven't been here. Ordered on Uber eats though. I got the Tofu soup and I must say I'm not impressed.   Very salty and arrived cold. It's not even spicy. Only positive is the generous beef serving inside the soup. I lived in Korea for two years so I guess maybe my standards are different. I won't be order nor visiting here anytime soon.
2018-07-29,4,A great Korean fusion place in downtown Hoboken, I highly recommend the kimchi cheese tots and try one of their bowls where you can mix and match different toppings with their choices of meat or non-meat items from marinated steak to tofu to chicken or even shrimp. I mixed and created my own burrito with kimchi fried rice with their famous spicy slaw marinated steak and corn  in a burrito  and it came out amazing, it definitely feed two people, they have WiFi and a dessert as well, they offer bubble tea or Thai rolled ice cream. They have street and bike parking and restrooms for their customers, they take cash or credit and offer take out or delivery. Enjoy!
2018-07-25,2,Ughhhhhhhh my delivery was 42 minutes late and the food was cold. Specifically ordered the Galbi Short Rib meat which they charge extra for and they instead gave the rib eye. I am so disappointed. I really love this place but not sure what's happening lately... Hopefully I'll be credited for the extra charge for the meat I didn't get . Also I noticed they overcharged me $4.26?!?!
2018-07-21,3,This place is decent. I ordered a bowl with veggies and red pepper sauce and vegetable dumplings. I ordered quite early as I have had some late delivery experiences before as well with other places, so I have learned to order as early as possible. The delivery was half hour late and the dumplings were too cold. The veggie bowl was decent. I like Korean food and I can tell the overall quality was decent here. I will consider this place again if I don't find anything better.
2018-07-11,4,Stopped by here to grab a quick lunch.  I brought the rice bowl with purple rice, galbi, butter kimchi, white radish, cucumber kimchi and spicy slaw. Let me talk about the negative first.  The galbi was such a disappointment, the meat itself was ridiculously dry, like small pieces of cardboard.  There was a few rare pieces that were actually tender and they were very flavorful.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of the pieces of meat were way overcooked.Conversely, I thought the spicy slaw was amazing.  It was the perfect combination of spiciness, crunchiness and creaminess.  I was initially a bit taken back by how "mayo-y" it seemed, but it was absolutely delicious and it came in handy against the overcooked galbi.  The other accompaniments were also quite good, I particularly liked the two kimchis, both were the perfect amount of sourness and spiciness.  The portion was also quite big, I thought it was pretty good value for the price.Overall, I've debated whether to give Gogi Grill three or four stars, but ended up giving it four as the vast majority of the dish were pretty delicious, save for the protein.  Perhaps I will try a different protein next time.
2018-07-07,5,My co worker and I ordered for the first time for delivery because we have never tried it. It was so good. We both bought bowls and it came with a generous amount for the price. Everything tasted so fresh. It was so good I was craving it again two days later and actually went to pick it up before work. Definitely a go to !!!
2018-07-07,5,If you like kimchi, this place is excellent. Pay an extra $1 and they'll make kimchi fried rice in front of you.
2018-06-28,5,yessssss, YEEEEEEESSSSSS.....mmmyessssss. Outstanding inside an out. Beef, chicken, glass noodle, purple Cilantro bust sauce, that red spicy sauce. All FIRE MONEY. Coming back here again and again.
2018-06-22,4,This place looks very unsuspecting from the outside, but the food is awesome! I've been to a similar spot when I went to Rutgers in New Brunswick and this place is much better. Everything was fresh and delicious, and the sauces are amazing. I liked that there are numerous choices of protein, toppings and sauces so that you can customize your meal and try a new combination every time you come. The portions are also a great bang for your buck and guaranteed to have you feeling stuffed when you leave.
2018-06-13,5,Came here for dinner around 7:30 and there was barely a line! I ordered combo bowl #4, which has white rice, tofu, spinach, sprouts, cucumbers (I got the cucumbers without kimchi), radishes, and brown sauce. I love that the radishes were spiralized- so much easier to eat them that way! This bowl was delicious and extremely filling! I couldn't even finish it! I love how fresh all the ingredients tasted too. Can't wait to come back and try the tacos!
2018-06-10,4,I ordered the KOriginal and found the dish overall to be pretty excellent. I think the ratio of certain foods could be different (less rice, more toppings) but for the price, the meal was worth it.
2018-06-03,3,It was a humid Saturday afternoon, there were no customers in the store but I still gave the place a try. A new concept, kinda like a burrito bowl but Not really. Like a sort of a korean spanish fusion but ntot really. I was a bit confused by the menu. Combo menu says +1 and I didnt understand what you get plus one of.  I ended up getting combo #2 with shrimp, no egg topping (extra $).  It was okay, Im not really a fan of butter sauteed kimchi tho. I really like fresh kimchi. It is a huge bowl you can share with someone else. Perhaps a choice of small, medium, large in the future(?) And a simpler menu for the newbies(?)Regarding cleanliness, I lost my appetite a bit when I sat at the metal stainless table that really was not so clean. Like a dirty mirror, I dont quite know what the word for this is. Then afterwards I went to the restroom and found a used maxi pad on top of the toilet paper dispenser. I needed to put some paper towels on top of that so i wouldnt see it  I dont know if it was the "cleaning staff" girl before me or if it was someone from the morning who forgot to put it in the trash! but staff should really have noticed and cleared it out. That was kinda the last straw for me. Then I really lost my appetite, took the leftovers to my mom and decided to never go back to GG.Cleanliness really does matter to most people. If there are no customers, i wish staff would care to CLEAN. And education on the food is necessary to staff and the Understanding of culture and ingredient combinations. Overall its a good place to try at least once when you have the appetite for fast food mixed rice bowls.
2018-05-20,3,I'd like to compare this place to a 'Korean Chipotle'. People can pick up protein and vegetables as they want. I ordered salad with shrimp and chose four toppings. It's healthy and they gave fair amount of food. But the Kimchi tasted like normal cabbage and they wouldn't provide tap water.
2018-05-15,1,Worst delivery experience ever!!! Waited for more than 2 hours to get my delivery. They first forgot my order, then went to the wrong place!!! I checked once after waiting for one hour, they told me to wait for 10 more minutes, then I waited for 1 more hour to get their call. Then my dad waited for 15 minutes in the lobby getting nothing because they sent to the wrong place. And when I opened it, the beef bowl with kimchi fried rice didn't have any beef!!!!! And it was white rice instead of fried rice!!!!!!! I think you should refund me and you owe me a huge apology!
2018-05-13,5,Amazing food! Love the tofu soup, which was perfectly spicy. HIGHLY recommend their bulgogi burrito. Bravo!
2018-05-12,1,Waited an 1.5 hrs, never got my order. Left on hold for 20 min. Terrible customer service. I would suggest ordering from anywhere else.
2018-05-12,1,TERRIBLE SERVICE AND THEY LIE!2 hours after i placed my order, they hadnt even started on it yet. BUT all the times i called (4) they told me that the delivery guys was 1 min away. Why lie? Why not just be honest and cancel my order if they are too busy. Why make me wait 2 hours and then call me to ask if i still want my food. Ridiculous.
2018-05-09,5,This place is really good. Good value, fun unique food, nice service. Everything fresh and high quality, just wanted to try something new by stopping here and I've been back a dozen or so times. Consistently.Changed my review to 5 just becAuse the devil is in the details and these guys kill it
2018-05-07,5,If you go here, expect to be addicted because omg it's so good!Went here on a whim and ordered the Combo #1. It was so good! I do the  short ribs and everything that comes with the combo. I've tried the Combo #2 as well and it's also delicious. The flavor is there, veggies are fresh, kimchi spicy and some crunch is thrown in there too. I've had good Korean food and this is a great place to try Korean in case you never have. It's also a big portion. I also have never sat inside, I just do take out. It's a speedy process and have never spent over 3-5 minutes ordering and paying (which is important when you have a tight schedule for lunch!) Definitely will go again, and again, and again :)
2018-05-05,1,For the last two orders, it took on average twice the time it says on the estimate. I placed the order at 12 and it has been 90 minutes and I still didn't receive anything. For the first time this happens, I thought it was on the off chance that this happened. And yet here again, today sitting here grumpy and hungry waiting for food. I called the restaurant twice and their response is the same "should" be here any minute now. Let's see how long their any minute will be.
2018-04-25,2,Top of my list when don't feel like cooking. Upcharged 30% when I ordered shrimp bowl today, disappointed
2018-04-25,4,Went for LunchFood - 4/5. The vegetables were fresh and crunchy but the amount of them overwhelmed the bowl as there was way too much crunch. The kimchi was more fresh than sauteed so it added to the crunchy texture. The rice and beef were hard to distinguish due to so much of the vegetables being prevalent. The red sauce was nice and spicy but the textures did not feel very balanced.Service - 4/5. It is a self service location. The cashiers were courteous.Value - 4/5. The concept is good and the flavors were fine but I did not feel it particularly stood out. I would probably have liked it better making my own bowl but I feel the combo bowls are what is suggested by the restaurant for new diners. Going by that, it was alright.Parking - Street (Metered)
2018-04-12,5,Great place to get amazing food that is a reasonable cost. Angel prepared my food and he is very personable and helpful.  I definitely recommend this spot.
2018-04-08,5,Love this spot..its so addictive.  The food is fresh and taste awesome.  We have tried mostly of everything.  The shrimp tacos are great and they give you right amount of shrimp, toppings and sauces.  Chicken tacos are also excellent. I have tried a bowl with my selection of toppings that had bulgogi and it was delicious.  Its made the way you want it.  I have also tried the tofu soup and its on point.  The soup is delicious. Just wish it had a bit more bulgogi in it.  You can even add rice to the smaller one by getting it on the site.  Also I want to try the dumplings but wish they were steamed instead of being fried. In addition, the selection of drinks are great too. I have not tried the ice creams but here its delicious.  I order from them at least 2-3 times a week.  And its ALWAYS on point.  In addition, their customer service rock...I was missing some sauces and they sent it immediately.  And for delivery, they are super fast.  Now I think Gogi needs to expand...I think everyone needs to try Gogi.  Thank you Gogi!
2018-04-07,3,Decent food. Not meant to be super authentic korean food so do not expect it to be. The staff were unfriendly and not very helpful with anything. There are a few tables and chairs to sit and eat but not sure if i would do that again b/c the rolled ice cream being made consistently (even when there are no customers) is pretty loud the whole time
2018-04-07,4,I wanted to wait to make this review until after I reheated my leftovers and I am glad that I did because my meal honestly only got better. This place is a great fast casual restaurant that has a lot of foods that can introduce you to Korean flavors. Though it isn't exactly authentic, it offers a great selection of tasty food with relatively large portions.This was both me and my boyfriend's first time here so we decided to get a little bit of everything and double meat. We both had the Korean fried rice, bulgogi and added extra Galbi. We had different toppings and sauces but both of our combinations were great.I would highly recommend the green sauce because it compliments all of the heavy ingredients so nicely.My only complain with this place is the price. The portion size that came out after ordering extra meat was great but I felt like it was a portion that should have come out for the regular price. They make up for it with the rice and toppings but everyone knows that people want protein. Also a fried egg on top is an extra charge which is in some ways understandable but the price just doesn't seem reasonable If the price for extra meat or the standard bowls was decreased by just a dollar or 2, I would give this place 5 stars.
2018-04-04,5,Great flavor and variety of options! Conveniently 2 blocks from the Hoboken terminal.
2018-03-24,4,Fantastic Korean fusion food! We ordered the rib eye bowl and the dumplings. The dumplings were so-so, but the rib-eye bowl just hit the stop so good! Definitely stopping by here again!
2018-03-22,2,Delivery took an hour and I'm​ not even a mile away. the food was very bland and got here cold
2018-03-19,5,This is one of the top lunch spots on rotation at work. Always fast, solid, and filling! The chicken japchae noodle bowl is delicious and my go-to.
2018-03-13,5,This was an amazing find! It's like Asian Chipotle. The bibimbap bowls are perfect. We had Combo #2 - one with Shrimp and other with Ribeye. The ingredients were very fresh, the shrimp and beef were perfectly cooked. The red sauce is a hit!! Also loved the Green sauce. This is a perfect place for a lunch or a quick meal. The price is reasonable and quantity is lot. The kimchi fried rice is a must try! I'm coming back here for more bibimbaps!!
2018-03-12,5,The Korean BBQ version of Chipotle, in a very good way. Came here and was super satisfied with my bulgogi beef create-your-own bowl for the very reasonable grand total of $11.96. The bowl comes with 4 toppings and is BIG in terms of portions. Would definitely come again! Wish they had this back in South Florida or California.
2018-03-09,5,This place has fantastic food. Just had the bulgogi beef bowl, dumplings and the spicy tofu soup. This stuff is like crack. The portions are amazing and the flavor is outstanding. I will be back many many times. The woman who took my order over the phone was super patient and explained the options for the bowl in detail. Another woman who expedited my food when I picked it up was super nice. Great service!
2018-03-09,4,I came here during lunch time with my coworker and the food was really good! I had the spicy chicken tacos and loved them! Also their green cilantro lime sauce is awesome! The girl who helped me was also very friendly so I definitely will go back again.
2018-03-09,2,Food was meh and customer service was atrocious We ordered 3 bowls for delivery last night. ETA was 45 minutes the delivery took over 75 minutes. I called the restaurant after an hour to inquire about my order but the lady who picked up obviously could not care less about my order. Where's my food? "It left a while ago and I have no idea how much longer" Thanks lady, very helpful. The bowls were cold and meat was dry. Maybe the bowls are better warm and fresh but I'll never know.
2018-03-08,2,Meh.  I don't understand why Gogi Grill does not have soondubu soup without beef on their menu; every Korean restaurant has tofu soondubu as the standard with options to add meat, seafood, or more veggies.  I had shrimp tacos which were okay; they have you pick what topping you want rather than a set ingredient combination for the tacos.  My fella had a burrito and really liked it.  I came for quick soondubu and left with tacos, the tacos had a flour shell, not scallion pancake shell.  Kimchi was okay.  I would not go back.
2018-03-04,5,Amazing employees  people here are very nice and welcoming . Right across to the Korean grill is a ice cream place which is super good and low key i recommend Angel and demon
2018-03-02,5,OMGGGGGGGG THIS PLACE IS AMAZING.  Never lets me down and I always get 2 meals out of it.  100% get one of the combo bowls, and if you don't get spicy bacon you're a psychopath.
2018-02-15,5,Tried delivery from here for the first time last night and I'm sad I ate it all and don't have leftovers because I really want it again right now! I ordered a bulgogi bowl and added an egg (perfect over-easy egg!) Also tried gochujang and cilantro-lime sauce and both were delicious. I appreciate that the spice levels were hot, but not so hot that you could only taste the sauce and not the food. Just right. The bulgogi was tasty and I was impressed with how much meat was in my bowl. I seemed to get a little bit in every bite once I mixed it all up. My partner tried a chicken bowl with teriyaki sauce and all I can say is that he's usually a slow eater but he really woofed it down so it must have been good! :D We also tried an order of the kimchi tots for fun, which I thought would be super weird but were actually pretty delightful. I was not expecting the cheese to be... cheese whiz? But eating it made me happy, like eating moms mac&cheese. The tots could have been a crispier but that's just my preference.The delivery guy was really friendly and arrived earlier than the estimated time. Everything about the order was perfect. I'll definitely be eating here all the time now! Way to go, Gogi!
2018-02-05,5,I love this place, it's crazy addicting! I almost wish it wasn't so conveniently located next to the Path.I did the Um, Because Bacon Bowl-it's got all the K-BBQ necessities: pickled everything, kimchi, and a cilantro lime sauce with the perfect kick! Try it-you won't be sorry!
2018-02-01,4,Ordered a beef bulgogi bowl and my partner ordered a chicken bowl. There were so many amazing options, even for a picky eater like myself. I love kimchi so I ended up with a spicier variation, and my partner got teriyaki sauce so his food was a little sweeter. The purple rice wasn't bad, but I'd like to tried kimchi fried rice next time. Overall a great experience! We didn't finish everything so it was warmed up the next day -- still tasted very good after microwaving. Another bonus is that it shares the building space with an ice cream shop so we got some right after eating lunch.
2018-01-27,4,My boyfriend and I have been ordering from Gogi Grill three weeks in a row. We were looking for a place that served Korean bowls for the longest time. The food is delicious. We opt to go with the extra protein since the normal portion of chicken is very little. It is worth it. For 3 extra dollars you get much more chicken.Update: Food is good, my boyfriend and I are addicted, but when ordering from the store, be sure to check your bag before leaving. I was so dissapointed when I got home and realized that I was missing my two teriyaki sauces. The sauces really do make a difference in the food. Otherwise, it's a bit dry/bland sometimes depending on the toppings you get. I would have gone back to Gogi Grill if I had not just spent 15 minutes finding parking.  My boyfriend has now ordered an additional bowl via delivery so that we can get what should have come with our two bowls to begin with. Very irritating, but the sauces they offer make the bowls so much better.
2018-01-24,1,FOOD POISONING!I've been here before and had maybe a 3 star experience. I won't be back after my last visit (weekday lunchtime). They nickel and dime you, everything is an up-charge. The staff is unknowledgeable about their menu items, and frequently make mistakes. The protein is NOT FRESH. I ordered shrimp and tofu. The shrimp was dry, and something tasted really funky about it. I ate only 3 of them before I was so disgusted that I threw the rest out. My friend got the same and felt the same way. Sure enough, 2 hours later, we were both experiencing nausea, bloating, cramping. 24 hours later, my friend is still sick and now has a fever. Luckily I barely ate any shrimp so I am better.
2018-01-13,3,Okay, it's decent - there's a lot of food, probably enough for 2 people if you're appetite isn't that big. The concept is easy enough, pick a base, then protein then toppings and a sauce.My issue is that the extra protein of Galbi was overcooked, burnt really and it's tough. That really ruined an otherwise fine meal.Just get Bulgogi, which was soft and flavorful and definitely worth it.
2018-01-13,4,My girlfriend and I were looking at places to satisfy our hunger when we stumbled upon Gogi Grill. The pictures looked really nice and immediately caught our eyes. However, upon getting the food it was nothing like the picture. Maybe this is because we ordered on uber eats instead of actually sitting down at the restaurant itself. We ordered the bowl your own bowl and the portions are huge. If you have don't have a big stomach like I do , I recommend you share one bowl. P.S , the siracha and katsu sauce do not go well together....sodium overload.
2018-01-11,4,Really good if like gochujang flavors and Korean barbeque flavors. The restaurant is similar to a Chipotle, so very fast and efficient service. I think the prices are a little high for what you get though, i.e. roughly $15 for a steak bowl, add drinks and it comes to $18ish, which is pricey for what I'd expect to be a fast casual place.
2018-01-08,4,I find myself strangely addicted to the vegetable dumplings.  I've ordered delivery several times through the Yelp app and always arrives fairly quickly with no issues.  Been my go to place for several weeks now.
2018-01-06,5,One of the best takeout options in Hoboken! Their loaded tater tots with cheese, bacon and kimchi are awesome and their bowls are super generous in size. The beef bulgogi has to be the best of the proteins, super smoky and a great addition to the veggies that go along with it. One of their bowls is good to share between two people, otherwise you're likely to have leftovers!
2018-01-05,5,Ordered delivery from here with a few friends and everyone was satisfied with their food, the preparation was quick and the delivery was ahead of schedule. The food is delicious and big portions, I ate mine for 3 meals!
2017-12-15,3,Ok so first let me give acknowledgment to the owner. He does cares about his business. I had two experiences that I was unhappy about and he personal reach out me. So the fact of the matter is the food is Great! I wouldn't say I'll never try them again and I would suggest you try them. I would however say go there physically rather then using delivery.
2017-12-12,3,My experience with tofu tacos is not great. But tofu rice bowl is good and tasty. I first ordered online through yelp and had pickup, I ordered tofu tacos, selected tofu, to my surprise, there is just tofu in the taco, nothing else, Bit disappointed, Pricey for just tofu.
2017-12-01,4,Oh Gogi Grill, why aren't thou more spicy? All of us Kimchi fried rice lovers are asking! Having said that the Kimchi fried rice bowl is my go-to and I get it every time with tofu. The freshness can't be beat and it's a super convenient Korean BBQ option in Hoboken. My favorite toppings are spinach, corn, sprouts, spicy slaw and zucchini. I also love their green and brown sauces, but the green has a tangy flavor which I prefer (cilantro-lime-jalapeno). I would love it if they would kick it up a notch on their spice level and go bold! Definitely a solid option for lunch. Looking forward to trying the ice-creams soon!
2017-11-20,4,Ambiance - 4/5Taste - 4.5/5Price - 4/5Hospitality - 4/5Quantity - 4.5/5Fresh ingredients, well mixed, simple combinations and very flavorful. Fast service. Overall a wonderful lunch option. I am yet to try their ice cream rolls.
2017-11-15,4,Was here couple of times, good food, everything looks fresh, healthy and tasted good. Only thing I felt bad is , they restrict on choosing veggies and even sauce and extra for each small thing. Overall experience is good. Small and nice place.
2017-11-06,4,I went there with an open mind bc dont really eat Korean food but it was really good. I wish they had a smaller bowl option. The bowl is a large portion and very filling. I chose spicy chicken, kimchi, cucumbers, spicy slaw, and hot peppers. It was overall good food and the staff was very friendly.
2017-11-02,4,Good place for lunch. Serves bowls where you pick starch, protein and four veggie sides.  The glass noodles are really good.  They are very friendly and serve fast. The bowls are big and usually I can't finish to food. The only negative is they do not have cups for water.  Really strange. You either have to bring water or buy a drink.
2017-11-01,3,Nice quick spot to grab some Korean food to go. You pick your base, protein, and up to 4 sides as well as the sauce. I'm not a big fan of spicy food, and even though their green sauce is medium spicy, it's really good. I think it was the best part of the meal! The food itself without the sauce was good but a little bland. I had the white rice with chicken, corn, bean sprouts, carrots, and spinach. I may stop by for a quick meal again but I think there are other places that do Korean food better.
2017-10-30,3,I tried the large spicy tofu soup, and bulgogi bowl based on reviewsNot authentic Korean except for the basic flavors.  The soup was literally a big ugly block of tofu simmered in a sweet spicy water with oil.  The rice in the beef bowl was mushy and so we're the sides. You could taste only sugar and oily to everything to make up for flavor.  Certainly different, healthier and cleaner tasting than other places in the area (pizza, Chinese, diner, middle eastern), but menu caters to the lame neighborhood tastebuds.
2017-10-29,4,Basically Chipotle but Korean style, and it was fantastic! Highly recommend the bean sprouts, sautéed onions, fresh jalapeños, the spicy red sauce, and the spicy cilantro sauce, but the fried egg for an extra buck is what pulled it all together. Will definitely be back!
2017-10-24,3,Not so good. The rice is very hard, the chicken is not fresh. Beef is charred. I didn't get what I ordered for sides. Overall I don't think it is worth 4.5 stars.
2017-10-23,5,The food at Gogi Grill is delicious, you get to pick what goes in your bowl and the selection is reasonably healthy if you want to make it so. The proximity to the PATH is appealing to grab food for dinner on the way home.
2017-10-22,4,Delicious Korean BBQ fast food has finally come to Hoboken. I stopped by based on yelp reviews. Very much like Chipotle's with its ordering: select choice of rice, protein and 4 sides to add to your rice bowl bibimbap plus your sauce. Try the purple rice (a mixture of white and wild rice), the thin sliced bulgogi rib-eye beef and whatever sides you want as long as you get kimchi. Yum! The server gave me two sauces (green and spicy red) because I couldn't decide. They were good mixed together, but I was partial to the cilantro lime jalapeño green sauce.Gogi Grill is a welcome and needed restaurant in a city with such a diverse and cosmopolitan population. Hopefully it lasts a long time in a spot where successive restaurants have failed every six months or so. Office tenant growth nearby bodes well for Gogi!
2017-10-20,1,Terrible service. Person who answered the phone for delivery was slow, unfocused and immature. A simple order took 15 minutes to place. Then, 30 whole minutes passed before I got a phone call saying that my order was cancelled because they "no longer delivered" to my location.
2017-10-18,5,Delicious! And a good amount of food. Will definitely be making this one of my Hoboken lunch staples.
2017-10-08,5,Just ordered delivery from Gogi Grill tonight and I'm SO glad I did. This will for sure be our new go-to. We ordered two make your own bowl and they are so big for $10.50! Plenty of rice, meat, and sides. I got the ribeye and my bf got the short ribs. We tried each other's and agreed it isn't worth the extra $3 for the short ribs; the ribeye was just as good. Either way, it's hard to find a delicious and satisfying meal for $10 so we will be ordering often, but probably picking up to avoid the delivery fee. There are also a lot of options so we won't tire of Gogi Grill quickly. Delivery was 45 mins on a rainy Sunday, which is great! Can't wait to try the sweet potato vermicelli and maybe try the burrito option next time!
2017-09-28,5,Amazing! This place is like a fancy chipotle for Korean food. You get a choice of rice bowl and add onto it different toppings like meat, kimchee, veggies, and so on. My husband, my kids and I went and we all loved it! There is also an ice-cream place inside where they make the ice cream right in front of you.
2017-09-28,5,If I die eating Gogi Grill then I will die happy knowing that I died doing what I love most... eating Gogi Grill.
2017-09-26,3,There is already a very limited option when it comes to Korean food in Hoboken; so beggars can't be chooser. But for a tiny grab and go joint; it is not all that bad. The portion size is generous and you can add additional toppings into your bowl (like a fried egg!) I think it should default come with; so slightly sad I have to pay extra for it; since that is one of the main ingredients of the bibimbap dish! Also got the fried mandoo (dumplings) but not too impress there; just stick with the bowl (I recommend the bulgogi) and they have a respectable kimchi. Not the worst thing I've eaten but hop on the train (it across the street) and go into Manhattan for some mind-blowing Korean cuisine.
2017-09-23,4,Whenever I travel to NJ i will be staying in the Sheraton and i always head to manhattan korea town for K food! My favorite is Galbi, bulgogi and spicy pork bibimbap! Never feel tired of those. So this is the first time ordering Gogi and deliver right infront of my door! I ordered beef bulgogi bowl and also a spicy bacon bowl. Beef taste delicious but the bacon disappointed me a bit, its different from the spicy pork that i usually have, its hard to chew, smoky and i think it could taste so much better if just using pork loin rather than bacon. (Trust me more and more people will ordering this if u change XD ) Overall the toppings are well marinated with sesame oil especially the kimchi cucumber watercress also the impressive garlic corn. Match perfectly with gochujang (red pepper sauce) and the purple rice is well cooked. Ladies n gents , if u order these bowls make sure u add an FRIED EGG on top and you will feel absolutely contented! NO REGRETS. Definitely will order next time when i stay in.
2017-09-19,5,Very different than anything I've ever ate before, Korean bulgogi in a burrito. Asian fused with Latin cuisine. And the two fit together perfectly, unfortunately I don't live in Hoboken, so I don't know the next time I will be able to eat here. But if it were in Fort Worth, Gogi Grill will definitely be my go-to spot.
2017-09-15,3,Average Korean food close to the Path stop. We stopped by on a week day night to pick up dinner. It was not very clear how the bowls worked (you're limited to 4 toppings), and the server had a bad attitude when we asked questions. The bulgogi ($11) was flavorful but wish they gave more meat, and the egg was $1 extra. Get the Forkcast app to get 10% off your order. The restaurant had some seating inside and a few seats outdoors, but there was a lot of foot traffic from the Path so may not be for everyone. There was also a small shop in the corner of the store that offered rolled ice cream.
2017-09-10,5,Great quick and delicious Korean barbeque. Perfect for a quick weeknight dinner. Love that they have options to tweak the rice bowls to as close as it gets to your taste. The Korean fried rice I got was buttery and sticky and went great with the beef, butter corn and Sriracha sour cream.
2017-09-08,5,I had the bowl w Purple rice (amazing texture) w bulgogi, bean sprouts, a fried egg (extra $1), pickled zucchini. They also do homemade ice cream made to order - creamery style. I had the matcha green tea w red bean paste topped w teddy graham bears :)
2017-08-31,4,Best Korean food I had in a long while. I don't get tired of eating there food. My go to whenever I'm in hoboken. My only complaint is the delivery drivers they tend to have an attitude for no reason. But overall the place is good.
2017-08-26,5,This place is amazing! My first time there with my husband and daughter and the food was incredible ! Clean place, we ate outside it was a beautiful night. The staff was nice and helpful. I got the kitchen sink it basically had all the meat and shrimp in it. It had 2 things in it I didn't care for but I don't know what it was  however that aside it was all good especially the bacon the spicy chicken lives up to its name. My daughter had white rice with tofu and shrimp I don't remember everything my husband had in his but it was good! You go in pick your protein and what other toppings you want on it. After dinner inside the same place they have an ice cream bar they make the ice cream right there in front of you! It looks so pretty I almost didn't want to eat it. I had dark chocolate with raspberries in it and on top of it with hot fudge. My daughter had mocha ice cream with sprinkles and my husband had smore crapes. It was so good but we were full! We decided to take a walk they are 2-3 blocks away from the water and a beautiful park.
2017-08-12,3,Wasn't a big fan of the food at this Korean Restaurant. My spicy chicken was very dry. I order a burrito but, maybe that was the issue... that it was a burrito.  My friend ordered bowl. She said it was okay at best. With two different proteins. For the $17 she spent she should of experienced more than an okay meal.  I will not be eating here again... it just didn't do it for me.
2017-08-11,5,Delicious!  Not a fan of flour tacos but taste is awesome. Not too impressed with website though.
2017-08-10,3,Thought I would give this place a try! I come here often for business travel and like to try new places. Food in the pictures looked pretty good, so I was excited. I got a bowl with short ribs and spicy chicken. The meat was good, both kinds. The kimchi wasn't for me. I think the let down was there wasn't enough sauce. I got the lime cilantro one. I feel like it needed a sweet sauce as well. It was just too dry for my taste. Delivery on this place was pretty slow quoted about 45 min. Took a little over an hr.
2017-08-04,4,I love the concept of a Korean bowl. Don't get me wrong, fresh Korean barbecue is awesome, but this place had add-ins which really complemented the meat - kimchi fried rice, butter kimchi, sauteed onions, or even the sriracha sour cream. I decided to cut into the flavor with the flavorful cilantro green sauce. The bulgogi was well-done and seemed fairly fresh, but the galbi was a real winner - tender with just the right flavor of sweet and savory - I would go back just for that. The only downside is the place is crazy expensive - more than $20 for a bowl with two types of meat (bulgogi & galbi).
2017-07-27,5,Really good and fresh. Had the sweet potato vermicelli with shrimp and katsu sauce, really gooooood. Would come back.
2017-07-26,5,I ordered the Combo#1 with steak which came out delicious. Great Food and Great Serving. Very Reasonable for what you get.
2017-07-20,4,This is a pretty decent place, a bit pricey but then again it is Hoboken so no surprise there. Their food is delicious, and very pleased with their service. Will be going here more often when in the mood for some korean food.
2017-07-19,3,Food  was good and fresh. Definitely Chipotle style as others are saying so it was quick and easy ordering. I would eat here again.
2017-07-16,5,Very clean. Very good service. GREAT food. Gogi grill is my go-to. Very reasonable prices too. I love this place.
2017-07-15,2,This was my first time here.  I gave a 2star because not one person said hello or smiled.  They did not look happy working there.  So rude how they took my order.  I even told them this was my first time here.  No response except what?  So, I ordered the combo #1.  So, I thought the combo# 1 standard was bulgogi but I guess not.  Then to the cashier, I asked to go but no response.  I paid and had to ask 3 times for a bag to go.  The food was just ok.  Bulgogi had good charcoal smoke flavor but lacked other Korean bbq bulgogi flavor.  Kimchi was cooked and fermented  too long.   I will not be coming back here again
2017-07-12,4,Not a huge fan of Korean food but this was pretty good!  The staff was extra helpful with my menu choices being it was my first time.  They walked me through the ordering process and helped me put together a delicious dish.I would try again.
2017-07-10,5,Food was delicious! My boyfriend and I really enjoy Korean BBQ. We usually get it from a location in Jersey City, but they don't deliver to where we live! So we decided on ordering from this place. My boyfriend isn't a big fan of the Kimichi from the place in Jersey City, so he was hesitant to try the Kimichi from Gogi. He loved it! He was talking it up the next day. We ordered the Kitchen Sink dish. It was enough for both of us. My only complaint was that the bacon has too much fat on it. We also tried the food with all the sauces that they sent us. The sauces were great. We were really impressed. Definitely recommend!
2017-07-06,5,This place was amazing. I ordered the chicken Goji bowl with purple rice kimchi cucumber kimchi spinach carrots and the sauce. It was so delicious and it tasted really healthy. They need to get one of these in Atlanta . There's not much parking there street parking but it's usually full it seems. I would recommend ubering it or walking there.
2017-06-29,1,DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE.  The food is OKAY at best.   More importantly, the customer service is HORRENDOUS.  The owner, Inku, is an idiot.  We ordered from here one night, and the order was EXTREMELY (over 2 hours) late.  We called a few times to check on it and talked to a lovely young woman who told us she was very sorry and we would be refunded because there was a mistake with our order, and that it was being sent out momentarily.  A week or so later we noticed on our credit card statement that the charge had not been reversed.  We called back, assuming that we would encounter the same excellent customer service we had received previously.  This was far from the case.  The owner, Inku, accused us of lying, made us go through the entire story about 5 times, was EXTREMELY rude, said he didn't know what had happened because he was on vacation, and basically made the entire situation a nightmare.  It was amateur hour, for sure.  There are so many great places to order from in Hoboken, skip this one. (BTW, the same night we had this horrible encounter with Inku, we had been planning on ordering from there again - this guy doesn't care about losing customers.)
2017-06-19,5,WOAH. Haven't crushed a meal in it's entirety like that in a minute. Bulgogi bowl was legit 10/10, wouldn't change a thing. Add a fried egg, you'll be happy you did.
2017-06-16,5,Wow! I decided to buy this for dinner tonight... amazing!!!!! I love the taste of the food and it was good portion and I couldn't finish eating at all! Food was very fresh and taste great! I definitely will return back again!!!
2017-06-14,4,If Chipotle had a Korean cousin, this would be it. The portion size for the bowl is large and the prices are reasonable. The only downfall is that this place doesn't turn on their AC, which can make dining in slightly less than comfortable.
2017-06-07,5,Super cool place! It's pretty much two things in one. In one corner we have the Korean BBQ and the other corner we have the rolled ice cream. The food was fresh and we the ice cream was to die for!!  I can't stop thinking about the rolled ice cream! It takes a little bit to get together around 10-15 mins per order. I got a coconut toasted almond vegan option. And it was delicious, my husband got French toast and also very tasty! Will be going back to try other flavors !!!
2017-06-07,4,Very good for a takeout joint! Good flavors, decent portions. Get gojujang to spice up.
2017-06-06,5,Food is great and on point. Generous helpings in the bowls and tasty. Love picking out all the different sides to go into my bowl. Wish there was another one serving uptown Hoboken.
2017-06-05,5,So so delicious. I wish I could have tried everything on the menu since it all seems amazing. Can't wait to come back
2017-06-05,5,WOW - ok I'm not sure where to start.  I loved this place so much chewing wasn't an option LOL.  First encounter with Korean style food- although its been on my bucket list for some time. The menu was short and legible. Another post described it as 'chipotle' style serving which is very accurate. We selected bowls and selected chicken, veggies, noodles etc.  The veggie selection was very crisp and fresh, noodles were awesome (not bland at all).  Being we have dietary restrictions this place is very natural, clean and fresh.  They make their own sauces - don't be afraid to sample them.A new favorite!!!
2017-06-04,5,Their bowls are BANGIN! It's like an upscale Chipotle since they give you options such as shrimp, zucchini, etc. If I'm downtown in Hoboken during lunch time chances are I'll go here for the bowl.
2017-06-03,5,Glad we finally tried this place!  The food is delicious -and you definitely get both quantity and quality!  For about $10, you can get a rice bowl or salad and add in your preferred toppings.  Try the chicken, also try the bacon- so good!! All of the toppings are equally delicious, but unless you LOVE extremely spicy food, I'd stay away from the longhorn peppers.  They are intense!!  Delivery is also super quick - both times we ordered, the food arrived in about 25 minutes.Give this place a try!
2017-06-02,2,I don't recommend getting food delivered from here. I got 3 sets of tacos (chicken/shrimp/short rib), however it looks like the delivery method combined it all into one mess.
2017-05-02,5,Food was delicious! Prices were great for the very generous portion sizes. Highly recommend!
2017-04-23,5,I ordered the Make-Your-Own, the bowl was very good and delicious! You can chose your type or rice, a meet, 4 different veggie options, and a sauce! I would recommend the Make-Your-Own if you don't know much about Korean food.
2017-04-20,4,This "chipotle" styled Korean restaurant is great! You could make your own bowls, or pick from the signature ones. You could also make your own tacos, or salad. But I'd go with the bowl to get your money's worth. With the bowl you get to choose your type of rice, meat, 4 toppings (which include spicy slaw, siracha sour cream, garlic-butter corn, etc.) and one of their sauces. There's two things I'd recommend they'd change and that is the spiciness(nothing is really spicy, it's mild at best) and the amount of meat they put. I would've finished my bowl but that was left was the Korean fried rice. I was really excited to try this place out and even though I was disappointed about the portion of meat and spiciness of their toppings/sauces the food was still delicious.
2017-04-17,4,Nice place if you want to grab some asian food quickly. the price is a little bit pricy compared to other more authentic Korean restaurants
2017-04-11,2,I had really high hopes for this place! I ordered a shrimp bowl with carrots, sautéed onions, and peppers. I added extra shrimp, extra lettuce, and extra peppers. The shrimp, definitely not my favorite! I'm not sure if the water from the lettuce had anything to do with this but the shrimp was incredibly soggy and mushy too taste. Being that the shrimp was the focal point of the dish I ordered, everything fell apart from there. The bottom of the bowl has a lot of water, again I'm assuming it's from the lettuce. Maybe the food is better when you dine in.
2017-04-05,4,I was surprised that their bowl changed since last time I ordered for delivery. It seemed bigger and the portion definitely got larger. However the meat to rice ratio is still the same as last time--not enough. For the amount they gave me for my bowl, I was able to make it into two meals--lunch & dinner!
2017-04-01,5,Great food! If you're looking for something healthy, this is your place to go! We tried the Burrito with Spicy Chicken & Bowl with Tofu. The portions are very well worth the price, especially the bowls. Also the ice cream counter is another great place for some creamy home made ice cream. Loved the French Toast & Dark chocolate with Raspberry. Would definitely visit again!
2017-03-30,5,This place is the bee's kneeeees.I am always excited about new, asian restaurants in Hoboken because I feel like there's a lack of good asian restaurants in the area, so when I heard about this place from a friend, I had to check it out.This fast casual spot is close to the Hoboken PATH with ample seating inside. Similar to Chipotle, they build bowls and burritos in an assembly type system so servive goes by pretty quickly. 1) Your order either a bowl, burrito or salad2) You pick your starch, your protein, and your toppings (up to 4)There are at least four options for each category so the combinations are endless. They have scallion pancakes for order as well. I ordered the bowl, with sweet potato vermicelli, shortrib, kimchi, cucumber, sprouts, and spicy slaw, with the spicy Korean red pepper sauce on the side. And it was everything I expected it to be. The key for Korean food is freshness, and, as someone who is Korean, I felt that the food was not only fresh, but also authentic. The combinations can also range vastly on what you're feeling that day because they have so many options - although my choices veered towards more pickled vegetables and fresh flavors, my boyfriend ordered a heavier meal with korean fried rice, spicy korean bacon as his starch and protein. The food here exceeded my expectations and I am always recommending it to my friends in the area. It can be a little intimidating at first with some of the more traditional options, but it is totally worth it!! Will be coming back over and over again!
2017-03-30,4,Good fast food option. I ordered the spicy chicken and Korean fried rice with veggies. Liked the ability to customize my order.
2017-03-25,4,A tasty and much needed bit of diversity among Hoboken's restaurant options (pizza, pizza, pizza...) The ingredients are fresh, the portion is generous, and the delivery was on time. My reason for giving Gogi Grill 4 stars instead of 5 is the price - while delicious, this is Korean food served Chipotle style. I've paid the same price for a steaming bowl of dolsot bibimbap at many a restaurant. That being said, Gogi Grill is a great addition to town, and a nice alternative to trekking to Fort Lee when you're craving Korean cuisine.
2017-03-19,5,Really good take on modern Korean BBQ. Stopped here to do a takeout bowl with spicy chicken- was pleasantly surprised at how flavorful everything was. Portions were very healthy for $11. Will absolutely be back to try other variations (and rolled ice cream!)
2017-03-17,4,I come in here a few times a week. Bowls are not bad, but they changed the spicy bacon from finely chopped to huge chunks of fat. Pretty gnarly. Everything else is good, though.
2017-03-14,5,My favorite place in Hoboken for lunch, very clean restaurant, fast service, delicious food and generous proportion for a reasonable price!
2017-03-13,4,Overall a very enjoyable experience, some areas for improvement but nothing that's a show stopper.Gogi is the pick your own meets Korean food for those who aren't familiar with their concept.I came Sunday and it was very chill, probably because it's not on Washington and the office crowd wasn't in. The overall menu set up was confusing, typically whenever I go you start off telling them the base and then the protein, their menu was set up with protein first even though the crew will ask you what base you want. After the slight confusion, highly recommend their management change this, we were back in business. I had the potato vermicelli and bacon with a few veggie toppings. My favorite were the watercress and radish, I love an added crunch factor. There's a variety of sauces to choose from so if you have a chance try a few and see which ones you like. Flavors were on point and serving size was just enough. It's pricier than chipotle but hey treat yourself.
2017-03-11,5,after a day of walking all over jersey city and hoboken I really needed to eat something savory and a lot, this place totally hit the spot. Everyone is super friendly and they give you a ton of food in your bowl for such a good price, I still have enough for lunch tomorrow or a dinner part 2
2017-03-04,3,Food is delicious no doubt about that. But skip the delivery - the last three times we've ordered there have been items missing.
2017-03-04,4,Try the kimchi on anything. Definitely good. The combination of sauces and veggies I took kept my dish a bit bland (lime cilantro sauce, zucchini, brocolli rabe, tofu) and creamy. But I'll definitely go again to try out the other combinations. Maybe they need I offer a smaller bowl for a lower price.
2017-02-24,5,I ordered the bulgogi bowl twice from this place and really love their food. Food is well prepared and very fresh. I can taste the food quality is better than some other Korean restaurants. Recommend!
2017-02-16,5,This place is basically like a Chipotle, but Korean-style.So far, I've tried their Bulgogi-Ribeye & Spicy Bacon bowls with Korean fried rice.  Both meats were marinated really well, the seasoned rice was super fluffy, and they have a large selection of toppings to pair with your meats.  The take-out bowls offer a generous portion - enough for light lunch the next day (and I can eat).  What a great new addition to Hoboken - hopefully it'll stick around for the long haul!
2017-02-13,4,Randomly found this place after leaving the gym. Based off it having good 4 Stars reviews (find those to be the most honest) and the manager's good interaction w/reviews, I decided to give it a try. Entree: shrimp Kimchi Bowl #2 with purple rice and lime jalapeño sauce (only sub - opted for the un-buttered kimichi side options instead of the buttered that it came with). Pros (mostly): Everything was moist and flavorful to compliment each other. The shrimp was seasoned well. Cons:  Kimchi cucumbers were bland and the sauce was flat (added the side of the "hot" sauce). Overall, good meal that's a nice change to what's standardly available. I hope they stick around and more of a punch to their line jalapeño sauce. See you, GG.
2017-02-09,3,I ordered the kalbi bowl for delivery tonight. As soon as I opened the packaging, the smell was right  on-point, of gochujang and kimchi. It was a large portion, so my hopes for a decent meal was excited to have comfort food for the blizzard slash snowpocalypse of 2017. It arrived on time with a kind delivery person, and all the components from the purple rice to the cucumber kimchi had great texture and flavor. I mean, who doesn't like purple freakin' rice?!? However, the main protein, the star, the core of my craving, the kalbi short rib itself? It was too well done, some parts actually burnt. Womp womp, indeed.  How underwhelming! In fact, instead of being tender, fatty, and flavorful with marinade it was too chewy and dry. There want enough protein also, but I'm more disappointed by texture & lost opportunity. This restaurant is in the sweep of popularized manhattan's Korilla and jersey city's Kraverie plus Beechwood's Korean fare tickled in their menu. Sadly, at a $20+ tag with delivery fee, you can't mess up the meat quality. At that price point, it doesn't compare to the aforementioned spots in technique and attention to the proteins. Korean food and this bowl are meant to channel the tart, spicy, and savory concept of a bibimbop and it's obnoxious that the meat doesn't deliver. Why not cook the steak correctly? Perhaps, this is the downfall of the fast food bowl, but it's been executed by others. Was it my bad luck and their off day? Summary: Flavors are strong but texture of proteins need improvement to come correct. I'm surprised with all the positive reviews clad the stars. Maybe Hoboken has Korean food scarcity? Either way, treat the meat right, Gogi. It would make the difference of average to outstanding. You, me, and the meat, we all deserve more. I'll try you again and hold my breath for an isolated incident and improvement.
2017-02-08,4,I work upstairs and this location has seen many businesses come and go.  Lucky burger then a Philly cheesesteak shop etc etc BUT finally it's a healthier option.  I'm Korean and this food isn't authentic but it's not trying to be, it's a new modern take.  I wish they had a $10 dollar lunch special or something like that because it does get a little pricey (I get the prices...they need to cover the high rent and overhead costs) but if it was a few bucks less I would probably eat here more.  Given the choices in the area for healthy food, this is a solid place but don't go thinking you'll get fort Lee/ pal park/flushing level Korean food.  This is Westernized Korean food.  I wish this business luck and hope they do well, so go visit!
2017-01-31,4,Ordered two different bowls from here. Really enjoyed the options and the ease of ordering.The meat was very tender and tasted fresh. All the different ingredients worked well together.  One thing you have to make sure is not to overcomplicate things. Check out the pictures everything looks good.The sauce is crucial and getting extra sauce always helps!
2017-01-28,5,Great Korean tacos and best ice cream i have had in town!!I had chicken, spicy chicken, and tofu. All really good. Ice cream made from scratch.
2017-01-27,4,Just ordered right off the Yelp app at 3:17, just arrived at 3:47..not bad! I'm in the heights area of jersey city ..cute delivery lady..she's like are you paying cash, I'm like no I paid with my card/PayPal..she's like oh because you didn't tip but it's okay...felt bad because I didn't have any cash on me and I thought the 3$ gogi was charging me for delivery went to you, my bad! Haha..NEXT TIME HUN! Lol..portions were ehh, but I always want more for portions because I'm a fat ass...good food, spicy the way I like it, felt like I ate all the chicken with two bites..the egg on top of everything oozing on all the ingredients in the bowl was everything! No need to sugar coat they are pretty pricey..but I'm all about the food quality and it was amazing...super delicious you heard! Facts though If you're a penny pincher this place isn't for you haha...
2017-01-26,5,This spot has changed food places so many times. It's good to see something good come along. Stepped in for the first time and was a little overwhelmed with picking the menu.. I finally got the hang of it and the food was great. I had a beef bowl with the vermicelli. All the toppings are amazing. Great lunch or quick dinner to go  spot. Will be back for the ice cream
2017-01-15,5,This chipotle style Korean BBQ spot is outstanding . The short rib is probably my favorite protein closely followed by the spicy chicken . Delivery is fast and food arrives hot . This place gets my vote
2017-01-12,5,Terrific place if you want to get your Korean cravings quenched. There so many choices, and all of them are fresh and amazing. If you can't decide, the kitchen sink has  little of everything. The Korean bacon is my favorite! And definitely add the egg... It just ties the whole thing together. They're constantly trying new things and adding to their menu too, so I can't wait to see what else is next. And don't forget to save room for dessert since they have rolled ice-cream in the same spot. Perfect place to grab a quick lunch and dessert (though it's just as great for dinner). If only I lived closer...
2017-01-05,5,Pretty pumped to have found this place. Perfect for a quick bite on the way home and they have some good healthier options. We had the spicy chicken with the green sauce on top and it was beyond delicious- will be ordering again. The other half of the restaurant has rolled iced cream and MATCHA!! Yup, finally found my matcha spot and I couldn't be more excited.Also the staff at both counters were beyond pleasant and incredibly patient with us. It was our first time ordering and they took their time walking us through everything and gave us advice. While at the ice cream counter, I messed up my tea order and didn't ask for soy when I realized they went above and beyond to correct my mistake! I felt terrible but I'm grateful they were so nice about it.
2016-12-22,5,Visiting from Los Angeles and staying at hotel nearby. My husband and I tried this place out..... DELICIOUS! We love Asian fusion and this place certainly exceeded our expectations for take out. Great portion and great price. Would recommend to anyone looking for something quick, fresh, and filling! I definitely would come back again. The owner was super nice too. Enjoy!
2016-12-19,5,This was the best korean food I've ever had. The spicy chicken, korean fried rice, and spicy coleslaw were unbelievable.. just go
2016-12-18,5,My husband and I were searching for the other of the two korean places that we heard had opened literally across the street from each other near the Path train. We found it! ...and so happy we did. This is the better and more authentic of the two restos, sorry to be so bluntly honest. We love korean food and kimchi and BBQ (my husband makes a mean korean BBQ). We followed on the footsteps of a kind korean gentleman who told us this was korean food was delicious and authentic. We ordered what he was getting: the beef taco with spicy kimchi and watercress topped with korean Spicy hot sauce. We also got 2 sides, the pickled radish which was delicious and the slaw which was also tasty but a little overly rich for me (FYI you get 4 free sides so if you want two, for ex, on top of your taco but don't want to overload your taco with toppings, they will give you the other two on the side). The servers were knowledgable and very kind and helpful. We got all 4 types of taco mains: beef, tofu, shrimp, and spicy chicken. For me the beef and tofu were equally outstanding. The spicy chicken was good but since marinated created less satisfying smokiness and less contrast with moist toppings if that makes sense. I didn't try the shrimp but my husband enjoyed it. Tacos were a good size with authentic korean spice, great kimchi!!! So excited to have authentic korean food in Hoboken!!  Afterward we had the rolled ice cream by Angel. First, I'm an ice cream fiend, searching for the best anywhere. We ordered the Moonlight Sonata (earl grey) condensed milk, and Toasted marshmallow. It was incredible.   It had great earl grey flavor, wonderful and satisfying creaminess like gelato with the freshness of the rolled ice cream. It was some of the best ice cream I've had in the nyc area. Angel is a superlative chef and ice cream artisan and he's truly mastered his craft. His ice cream was way better than the one in the West village that had a line out the door. Also, smart to marry ice cream with BBQ. Great combo, the ice cream lightening the spiciness of the authentic korean food we ate prior and the hot (bbq) and cold (ice cream) a great marriage for winter months. I will be back here a lot. Next time shall try the rice bowl and more ice cream flavors. Also the place (in true korean fashion) is spotlessly clean and very welcoming. Thank you!!
2016-12-12,5,Found this gem because my doctors office is right next door and let me tell you this place is AMAZING. Staff is super friendly and the food is great! I got a bowl with the Korean fried rice and spicy chicken ... they give you 4 toppings free and you have to try the kimchi ... both cabbage and cucumber with the cilantro sauce. Definitely my new go to stop! Not to mention the portion size is awesome definitely worth the $10 P.S try the purple rice! My boyfriend had it and we both loved it.
2016-12-07,5,Fresh meat and quite delectable. Purple rice & vermicelli noodles are bangin, spicy chicken is really good and not overly marinated, green and red sauce are great.
2016-12-02,5,Amazing healthy quick option right near the train station. Hoboken needs more places like this!
2016-11-30,5,Absolutely delicious!  Happy that Hoboken finally has a new takeout option.   Also Angels ice cream was the perfect dessert!
2016-11-30,4,Given the woeful lack of success of every other establishment that has been at this location over the past 10 years, I didn't have particularly high hopes for Gogi Grill.  I was happily wrong.My husband and I love Korean food, so we decided to give Gogi a try when we needed a quick meal one night.  There were a few other patrons there, but not many (it's more of a delivery/take out place anyway).  We walked up to the counter, ordered, and had our food in hand moments later.  Both bowls that we ordered were delicious - much more flavorful that a lot of the bimbimbap I've tried.  I had the korean rice with spicy bacon and an egg (and a bunch of sides).  My husband ordered the same with the short ribs.  We will definitely order from here again - fast, inexpensive, convenient, and delicious.  What more can you ask for?
2016-11-29,5,Very authentic ingredients!!  Gogi is legit and a much needed addition to Hoboken.  I hope more "foodie" spots like this pop up in the area as diversification is lacking within the Hoboken food scene!!!
2016-11-22,4,Okay so I get the concept with the food and why the short ribs weren't marinated that much.  (My complaint from my first review). It's like chipotle, but with an influence of Korean food.  Just saw Shark Tank the other week and saw a similar restaurant called Chi'Lantro from Texas.  The difference was Chi'Lantro is real Korean BBQ inspired in the style of chipotle or Tex-Mex preparations.   One of the Sharks said it was the best Korean Kalbi they ever had, which is saying a lot.  I think Gogi Grill can have that same potential but it has to decide whether they are a chipotle restaurant with an influence of Korean food or are they a Korean restaurant with an influence of chipotle's style (like Chi'Lantro).I'm raising it 1 star but I'd say 3.5 stars.  Food needs to be more Korean flavored.   I hope owner does the spam and egg options I mentioned.  No more butter in the cooked kimchi either.   I'll be back to update.
2016-11-21,5,Gogi Grill is a welcome addition to downtown Hoboken. I've lived in the area for roughly 8 years and every new opening seems underwhelming, or repetitive of something else within a mile.... who needs more pizza or Italian restaurants? I don't. Happily I can add gogi to the mix! Came here on Friday for lunch and made a bowl with sweet potato noodles, spicy kimchi, and tofu. The quality was solid and the production line (think Chipoltle) was efficient. When we finished our meal we were offered a taste of their homemade ice cream, which was, A) a nice surprise, and B) really good.  Perfect location and solid, quick food. I'll be a repeat customer for sure!
2016-11-17,4,Interesting little place that attempts to combine the convenience of Chipotle with the taste of Kbbq. I was ecstatic when I heard a Korean-food restaurant opening up as the nearest one is miles away. Ordered a bowl with Korean fried rice, short ribs, and some greens. Service could definitely be better. I came in when there were no one there and everyone seemed busy prepping the food or something. After waiting a little while, I had to initiate for them to take my order. Once I made the bowl, they left it in the counter for quite a while. Although, they give a pretty good quality take-out bag. Price wise, I spent 12 on the bowl alone, decent.I asked them for green sauce and they either forgot or put a minuscule amount. Yet, the food still tasted great. Rice was cooked thoroughly and had good texture. The kimchi was slightly too much. Butter is fine usually, but I felt it overbearing as well. The ribs were slightly chewy. Definitely can't compare to a legit Korean barbecue. But at this speed and convenience, can't really complain.
2016-11-16,5,I chose a Bowl of spicy chicken, Korean fried rice along with the following 4 toppings...watercress, carrots, spicy slaw and cheese. Wasn't sure what sauce to choose from but the really sweet girl working behind the food bar gave me a few sauces to sample. I really enjoyed the green sauce-cilantro, lime jalapeño. I'm glad I stopped in for lunch. Will definitely come back again and try the ice cream too. I was too full to try today....next time !
2016-11-12,5,So far I love this place. Since I've been working in Hoboken, I've seen so many restaurants open in close in this same location. I really hope this place does well and sticks around.  My coworker and I usually come here usually around around 7:30 being that we have a late lunch. What I like most is how their food always taste fresh, never like it's been sitting around all day. The staff is so friendly and always push you to try something new. The bowls are great and there's so much food. Scallion pancake tacos are delicious I have yet to try a burrito but I'm pretty sure it's just as good. We've even had the rolled ice cream and it's heavenly. This was my first time trying Korean BBQ so I really don't have any other restaurants to compare it to, but I'm not disappointed. This is my new spot.
2016-11-09,5,Shot summary:  Great place, great service, phenomenal food!  Details:  Stopped by on a rainy afternoon (cause the line is usually out the door at lunchtime).  Decor is simple yet trendy and the feel of the place is down to earth and welcoming.  The service was impeccable and they took a lot of care when crafting my tacos which were really good (coming from a Korean who has had a lot of Korean BBQ from a mom who makes it from scratch).  I just finished my tacos and will be walking out with a burrito in hand. Now about that liquor license...hehe
2016-11-08,4,There is now an amazing lunch alternative to Honeygrow and I can't be more excited about it. They are still in soft opening mode, so there were some minor issues with their payment system, but I'm sure they'll figure it out soon. This is a fast casual place - think Asian Chipotle. You pick your base (bowl, salad, or burrito), your meat (short rib +$2 ftw!!!!), 4 base ingredients (sauteed onions duh), and a sauce. I was overwhelmed by the sheer variety of options and the amount of food they give you. SO MUCH GOOD FOOD!! You can sample things too, if you aren't sure what the ingredients are. I would recommend getting the sauce on the side as some flavors might not always go well together. It was fine for me but for my coworkers who have never had Korean food before, I wish they had sample combos (e.g a numbered menu of options) so that it makes it somewhat easier to order. (Thinking of Honeygrow combos, with option to customize.)If you're ordering for the first time, try to stick to the ingredients you know (like lettuce, corn, onions, etc.) and depending on how brave you feel, try mixing in new(er) ingredients like kimchi, radish, etc. Get the short rib!!! The line can get busy, so I would get here right at 12. Make sure to get the rolled ice cream and coffee after :) Angels is located inside the Gogi Grill restaurant. Brilliant if you ask me. Overall, a solid lunch spot - and a welcomed addition to the Hoboken neighborhood! 4.5 stars.
2016-11-08,5,Came here around 9:15pm (they close at 10pm) after a long day of work. Decided to give this new spot a shot- this place definitely surprised me in how good it was, after only being open for less than a month. This place is like the Korean version of Chipotle. The staff was SUPER friendly and made great recommendations (even gave out free samples)! I ended up getting a bowl with vermicelli noodles(carb), short ribs (protein), and 4 FREE toppings: butter kimchi, corn, watercress, and a korean slaw. For less than $11, the portions were huge and I'd definitely recommend everyone to try this new spot, especially when it's conveniently located by the PATH, and would be a fast pickup on your way home from work.
2016-11-07,5,I lived in Korea for four years and, after moving to Hoboken from Manhattan this summer, have been disappointed by a lack of places I can use to satisfy my cravings for Asian cuisine generally (Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, etc).This place is great. To clarify, it's not trying to be a hyper-authentic Korean restaurant. It bills itself as "Korean BBQ To-Go" and the flavors are on point, especially if you choose your add-ons wisely. The food is reasonably priced, delicious, and satisfies my Korean food craving. I will definitely be back again and again.Make sure you also order ice cream from Angel for dessert!
2016-11-05,4,I dropped by to pick up lunch earlier today. We got a short rib and bacon burrito, a chicken taco, a tofu bowl, and rolled ice cream. The staff were friendly and I thought all of the food was delicious and good value for the money spent.That said, despite being the only customer placing an order at the time, it still took over 15 minutes to actually get it. I think part of that is likely because this restaurant is very new and the staff haven't really ironed out their workflow yet. I think they could improve by taking in the whole order at the start and working on each item in parallel rather than one at a time. Some sort of kiosk to enter the large set of meats, toppings, etc would be helpful!
2016-11-04,5,As a Korean that's been living in Hoboken for nearly a decade, this is the first restaurant to offer legit Korean food. Let me clarify, there's no such things as burritos or salad bowls in Korea but the ingredients used in their dishes are all very authentic (and delicious) with maybe just a slight twist to cater to people that are not used to Korean food. My wife and I have already gone twice and plan to frequent this establishment very often. As much as I love pizzas and bagels it's refreshing to have a new option in town.
2016-11-04,5,Meal was fantastic! Got the bowl with kalbi, kimchi fried rice, butter kimchi and some other toppings. Meat was fresh, workers were friendly, and the bowl was fantastic.  I've spent extended periods of time in Korea and thus I'm always on the hunt for quality Korean food in the USA. Better than Mogo (Asbury Park) in my opinion. Will definitely be back.
