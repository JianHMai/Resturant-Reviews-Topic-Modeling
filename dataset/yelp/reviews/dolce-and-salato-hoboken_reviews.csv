2021-11-05,5,Fabulous Molfetta sandwiches and cannoli!. Really fresh foccacia.  Quality ingredients. My new fav. Ital deli!
2021-10-14,2,Great food but orders often get delayed and take forever and you are just sitting around wasting your time waiting. Not a great experience- wish the owner would look into this as the food is good but the experience leaves you questioning if you should order from here or a bunch of other spots in hoboken. A shame really. Waited 90 minutes after 3 calls to the restaurant saying the driver is on the way for last 20 minutes i finally gave up and just asked for a refund. Not a great customer experience.
2021-10-09,2,I really Lili the food and the pastries here. The avocado toast is to kill for. However service is TERRIBLE. If you go there at 5:30, the staff will mop your feet and you will have to bring down the chairs from above the tables. I don't understand what's the purpose of closing at 7 pm if you are not welcome after 5. This place lacks management oversight.
2021-07-08,2,Good sauce and pasta - bad desserts, cookies and pastries  - go to Giorgio up the street on Washington if you want good pastries - they are by far the best in the tri state area
2021-07-02,5,I am glad we passed on living at the Rivington because I would go broke with this across the street. Instead of going every other day, I would be here every day. 5 stars for authenticity. It tastes like Italy and I am talking of real Italy, not an HBO version of it. I only started drinking coffee when my son was born and of course when I am in Italy. I cannot palate most coffee and their espressos / cappuccinos are the best. A nice blend of nuttiness and roasted aroma. The biscotti is perfect. The gelato once again tastes like you are in Italy (the chocolate is the best) and not like this other faux stuff that just tastes like a modified baskin robbins.
2021-06-23,4,This is a great neighborhood staple that serves fresh and tasty food. I order the Cobb salad most days and it is always prepared fresh and is delicious. Sometimes I pop in for their perfect coffee and a biscotti treat. This week I took my mom there for a sit down lunch and she had the Cobb Salad and I tried their panini - chicken with fresh mozzarella, roasted peppers, and pesto...yummy! Both dishes were generous in size and presented nicely. They also have great outdoor seating with plenty of space with a large awning to escape the heat of the sun! The staff is friendly too but what I really love is that they have great hours. They always seem to be open when I need a place to eat out for lunch/breakfast - most places in hoboken are still only open for dinner!
2021-05-14,2,Went there as a treat for my kids after a hard week. Sat outside. Younger kid made some shapes in chalk under the table. Two men came out and looked ashen and started squirting the table right under our legs, with cleaning solution, and then gruffly asked us to immediately move to a different table. They didn't ask us to clean up or even talk to us, just started squirting us. We had just started eating and had spent a lot of money on the food, and now we had a crying child who felt she'd done something bad. I told her it wasn't her fault and I wasn't sure why the  men were acting like that. I reached out later to the place afterward and asked if maybe they could have talked to us first or handled it more kindly, rather than making a child cry. Got zero response. And no, there isn't some other side of this, or something we did wrong; these two men came out and started squirting and gruffly told us to move! Least they could have done is responded to us. My parents grew up in Hoboken so we're here often and we also know there are lots of other places in Hoboken to enjoy baked goods (some that have been here for decades without making children cry!) but I figured I'd give them a chance. I reached out again figuring maybe a manager had to talk to the workers, but still got no response. The positive thing is that perhaps they will see this and the next family who is celebrating something can enjoy their meal outside and not have a bad memory. So this is actually a positive review in that good will come of it. Alternatively they could put a sign saying they don't want families' business. I am glad this crisis is almost over and I hope lots of nice businesses open in that neighborhood. Lots of people have praised their delivery so maybe they've gotten wise and dealt with people outside the premises.
2021-04-25,5,I LOVED my skim milk latte (it was perfect and I'd order it again even though normally I prefer flavored drinks) and the small cannoli was great! Good true ricotta flavor. I also like that they play normal pop music inside and that they have outdoor seating without service so it's casual. Also, free WiFi.
2021-03-23,5,Ordered delivery from ChowNow (more money for businesses than GunHub/Seamless/DoorDash). I ordered a Lobster tail, Sfogliatelle, Nutella Bomba, fried  house made fresh mozzarella, house made meatballs, house made meat lasagna, iced coffee, and a latte with almond milk.Order arrived a little later than expected but we were ok with it bc everything was delicious!!! Love that they have their own label on the boxes.Meatballs arrive cold so heat them up. They are solid, light in weight, and hold together. Nice light herb flavor. And wow! The marinara is incredible!! Highly recommend!! And we got a large quantity, 6 meatballs, for $8.75. Excellent. We will definitely order them again!! They're a nice size too.The house made meat lasagna was also excellent! Perfect size for the two of us and decent amount of meat. Again, the sauce is so so so good! Cheese perfectly melted. Price is a little high at $16 for this item but it was so good we would order it again lol. Definitely worth it.The fried house made fresh mozzarella was delicious!! Perfectly salty and crunchy with great stretchy texture of fresh mozzarella. $8 is sooo worth it!! We would definitely order them again!!! So good!!Iced coffee is good. Latte with almond milk is okay; it has a nutty flavor of espresso. I don't mind it. Prices aren't bad for them.The lobster tail, sfogliatelle, and bombs are amazing!! So fresh and soft for bomba. Wish there was more of a Nutella filling lol but it's good. The lobster tail and Sfogliatelle are both made well and have perfectly crunchy outer layers and thick creamy citrus inside lobster tail. Chocolate inside sfogliatelle.All worth it!!!We will for sure be ordering again from Dolce & Solato!!! :)
2021-03-18,5,So I went by the place today to pick up some Zeppolis  for my Italian boyfriend on Saint Giuseppe's day tomorrow .. they had 3 different kinds and the Chantilly ones were so delicious and absolutely fresh , in my opinion pastries must be fresh in order to taste good . The place is so clean and everything looks amazing in there , I definitely have to go back and try some other things they have . Staff so friendly too. This place should be on Washington street .. Carlos Bakery should definitely learn from them .If you want desserts with perfect presentation and tasteful at the same time this is definitely the place for you !!  Can't wait to try some other things .
2021-01-19,5,Love their soups and pastas. Such a good value and delicious food. The lentil spinach and chicken noodle soups are excellent.
2021-01-07,5,Dolce & Salato has the most amazing pasties I've ever had! The donuts are incredibly fluffy and light, coated in sugar with a hint of lemon. What I love the most is that they do not skimp on any pastry filling. I've tried the lobster tails and chocolate croissants and both were stuffed with filling! I ordered their Parma sandwich for lunch today (takeout) and it was delicious! Fresh mozzarella and prosciutto on soft focaccia. The sandwich was larger than I expected. It came with a small side salad and overall the price was worth the meal. Staff was properly following COVID protocols and friendly the entire time. I felt safe and welcomed at this establishment.
2020-12-16,2,Nice cafe in Hoboken but not the nicest staff. Pros: they have a variety of choices on their menu that all look delicious. Unfortunately I only got to try the small sugar cookies with sprinkles and it was firm (in a good way) and good. Reasonable pricing. Cons: I came here with a friend and the kids we watch so they can have a small snack and use the bathroom on a very cold day. Upon coming in one of the staff members gave us a very rude look, like she did not want us there. It was very off-putting. The other staff member assured us it was okay we were there and was very nice. I don't think I will be returning since there are so many other cafes I can give my service to whose staff will not behave rudely to customers.
2020-11-29,5,This is my place to go to for coffee and breakfast every weekend. The coffee is delicious and their bakery is fresh. I recommend the vanilla bombolone. The staff is friendly and helpful. The place is beautifully decorated. It reminds me of modern European bakeries (I'm from Madrid). I also love the outside space.
2020-11-08,5,This place is amazing! Great food and even better desserts and coffees. I come here every time I'm in Hoboken.
2020-11-04,5,Amazing coffee and very friendly staff. Just tried their calamari salad and chicken parm entree for take out and it was delicious. It's a big portion so very well worth for the price. Will definitely go back again.
2020-10-27,4,This place has a variety of baked goods. I always looove custard. Custard filled donut and croissant was good but the filling is not that satisfying. I had to save the custard as I was eating pastries because there just wasn't enough. Chocolate mousse cake was very well made and cannoli was not stale. Cannoli was pre filled but still crispy and fresh. Overall, I was happy with the quality.
2020-10-25,1,I passed by one day and loved the looks of the place, and I'm giving one star only for this. Today I remembered and went there to try their food. What a poor decision. Nice clean and good looking place. The woman who helped was maybe tired but she gave me the feeling she wanted me out soonest. I was staying in and told her what I wanted; she said I should chose something else because she couldn't warm it up as I had requested. I didn't find this too difficult to do but anyway I chose something else and she wasn't even helping she left and came back. Then food was ready, the soup was bland, I finished the pepper bottle and some salt nothing helped that boiled water!! The sandwich  was so so and salad dressing was too acidic and no taste.Needless to say I won't be returning to that place. Restaurants are saying how bad it is and they need our patronage but please make an effort and be nice and cook well so that people can go to you. I'll never be going there ever again !
2020-09-02,2,Food and drinks are mediocre. Menu stated items are not delivered as described. The issue was bought to the owners attention, who was extremely rude & unapologetic. The Two stars are for the yummy pear in my salad. That's all.I will not be returning.
2020-08-04,5,Came here for a quick latte during COVID, as I've been wanting to try this place since they opened. They have so many beautiful pastries, I ordered a rainbow cookie and 2 skim lattes to go.The rainbow cookies (7layers) were good and the lattes were delicious. The price point was reasonable. There is a decent amount of street parking on the block.
2020-07-14,5,I'm so happy they're back and reopened with delivery! Always serving large portions you'll never leave hungry and will even have left overs. Plus, their nitro cold brew is amazing.
2020-02-16,5,Great coffee and deserts but has an even better weekly menu. We didn't originally realize they offered lunch options but decided to give it a try. We had eggplant Parmesan, flatbread and lasana - all were excellent! Everything was homemade and the red sauce is great. We will definitely be returning.
2020-01-23,4,I want to love this place, but it's definitely pricey. The coffee is delicious and the atmosphere is lovely. Perfect to go with friends or loved ones to chat over coffee. They also have WiFi options. I've been here 2-3 times and once in awhile we share a pastry (Nutella Croissant) to have something. To me, it's a "once in awhile" kind of place. If you get me.
2019-12-09,5,Clean, delicious, and beautiful. They have a complete modern vibe, with absolutely classic recipes and food. Whether its coffee, lunch, or desserts its always a pleasure to stop by.
2019-12-07,3,Located in what's a restaurant desert of Hoboken.  Got a panini (which came with a side salad).  I'll admit it was tasty and more filling then I thought it would have been, but little pricey for a panini and a side of salad.I'd go back if I was passing by, but probably wouldn't make a special trip there.  I'd also be open to trying some other items but again little pricey.
2019-10-19,1,I stopped at Dolce & Salato for the first time yesterday. Had a nice cup of coffee and purchased a pasterie & two pre-made dinners to go - not cheap, $10 dollars (ziti) & $19 dollars (salmon). Put them in the refrigerator over night and popped the ziti in the oven for dinner tonight. To my complete disappointment, it was rancid, not edible at all. I'm, frankly, scared to try the salmon. My warning to everyone, don't ever buy Doce & Salato pre-made meals. You'll be throwing your dinner away with the money you spent.
2019-10-09,5,Had no idea this place existed until I drove by. It looks modern and clean. They have outdoor seating and some tables inside. I think it is a good place to get work done. You can have both breakfast and lunch here. They also have desserts if you are into that. I tried the quiche which was pre-sliced behind the counter. I guess they heat it up once you order. It was still pretty good. I also had the mediterrenea salad. Good portion and fresh ingredients. Delicious. My coworker tried the panini and enjoyed it as well.  I would probably try the chicken salad on a croissant next time. It looked awesome. They also have a gelato stand in here if you are feeling crazy.I would 100% come back for either breakfast or lunch. Really cool place and a perfect alternative to starbucks or panera to get work done. It is a hidden gem for now.
2019-09-06,4,Cute little Italian bakery. Delicious sandwiches and salads. Friendly staff and very quick service. Try the Buono santo sandwich(comes with a small salad)- large portion especially for lunch.
2019-08-18,5,Dolce & Salato is the best authentic Italian cafe in Hoboken. I always go for lunch with my boyfriend, and sometimes we bring the dog, and we've got everything from the chicken salad sandwich which is my personal favorite, to the Italian panini with assorted cured meats, fresh mozz on a crisp focaccia bread. Everything is always amazingly delicious, and it's the one place I like to order the specials from because they are always so tastey. For the holidays I always get a box of assorted pastries and they are my family's favorite not only because the pastries are fresh but they come in small sizes so you can have a taste of everything.
2019-08-17,5,The most amazing iced coffee I've had in a while and definitely the best in Hoboken hands down. Such a hidden gem. Amazing food options at reasonable prices. Must go!
2019-07-21,5,Hidden gem in Hoboken!! We got a custard croissant and the Boun-Santo panini (for only $11.75) and we were impressed by both. You could tell the ingredients were fresh and straight out of Italy. Just like Nonna's cooking! Compared to the other deli/bakeries in Hoboken this is my favorite!  It has an upscale feel and the place is really clean. We didn't try any coffee/ drinks but we'll definitely be back soon!
2019-07-07,5,Beautiful place, delicious pastries and coffee. Great way to spend a weekend morning. Will definitely return again and again.
2019-06-19,4,Place is gorgeous as has everything from faux marble looking walls to the hybrid italian Edison light bulbs.   Have free WiFi and comfortable chairs for those looking to work.  The mocha was good as was fried dough.  Prices similar to Starbucks on these two items.  They also have panini which are as mentioned by others on the pricey side more fancy manhattan than Hoboken.   Do not have breakfast panini or ham and cheese croissant.  Quiche available day I went was vegetable and would have gotten if had one with meat.Overall good place especially if do not want to trek down to Washington.
2019-06-15,5,Love love love this place! The pastries, sandwiches, pastas, and soups are fresh and delicious, and for the summer they now offer yummy gelato! The people who work here are all warm and attentive. I come here at least once a week - love the food and saying hi to them :) So glad we have this in Hoboken!
2019-05-13,5,Such a cute Italian bakery. I like that the location is off the beaten path. It makes it more quaint. It's very nice inside. I got a cappuccino and some pastries. I had the ricotta cheesecake and picked up some donuts and Tiramisu. I tasted all of them and they were so tasty. The pastries are really good. I definitely want to go back and try the food menu. I noticed they had somethings that sounded good on the menu. Can't wait to go back.
2019-04-17,5,First time here we grabbed pastries to go (spent only $30-ish for 8 pieces and some were big enough to cut in half), and second time we got lunch and sat outside.Cannoli cream is great, tiramusi is solid, pastries are overall very good. St. Joseph's zeppoli with cannoli filling is my recommendation. Also had a huge fresh salad, a delicious rice ball stuffed with two kinds of cheese, and a sandwich on a baguette. The food is very good and the staff is really friendly. My new go-to spot uptown to sit outside off the beaten path or grab dessert.
2019-04-05,4,I really enjoyed my lunch here. Fried calamari and my friend had eggplant parm. Not complicated dishes but so many places get them wrong. The store is also very nice. I especially love the pastries and the Easter items. If you have spent time in Italy you understand what they are bringing here - a coffee/pastry shop combined with a good lunch spot. Common there, not so much here. Well done. Buona Pasqua.
2019-03-25,4,I had lunch at this spot for the first time this past Saturday.  I walk by the café weekly on my route to Shoprite and always thought it looked very cute from the outside, so I was happy to finally give it a try.   Inside it is very bright and clean & white.  There is high top seating along the one wall/windows and then some table seating on the other side.  They also look like they will have a decent amount of outdoor seating once the weather gets warmer.   You order and pay at the counter and they give you a buzzer so you know when your meal is ready.  It's self-service clean up at the tables.  The menu features salads, paninis, and a few shareable plates along with coffee/café drinks.  They also have several bakery items you can purchase and breakfast quiche.   I tried the Palermo panini ($11) which came with a side salad.   It was a decent amount of food for $11 and it was very tasty.  I also had a latté - the latté could've been hotter.  My friend had the Buon-Santo panini which is very similar to the Palermo, just with chicken, which she said was also very good.I definitely will come back to this spot again to try a different panini.   It's very casual and quaint.  The only complaint I have is that it can take a while to order at the counter if there is a line.
2019-02-22,4,Came here to get a quick coffee drink and was incredibly impressed!! I order the Pisa and my fiance ordered the capri - both amazing. The pastries look amazing as does the small assortment of homemade soups they have available for purchase. The only think that threw  me a but off was the very modern decor, as the drinks call for a bit cozier vibe. I will definitely be back.
2019-02-13,5,Wow.This place doesn't get everything right. The cookies are good not great.But -- the pastry. Good god. Best sfogatelli (lobster tail pastry filled with sweet cream) I've ever had.And -- the espresso! I am a total coffee snob and this was the best espresso I've had outside Italy. Better than the espresso at Eataly in Manhattan, and better than pretty much any other fancy coffee joint I've been in in the the city.Can't wait to come back!
2019-02-03,5,My favorite cafe in the area. Being of italian descent growing up eating these foods it makes me feel at home. Coming from brooklyn in an italian area this is the closest cafe i can find to what I am used to. Their pastries are of great quality and the service is super friendly. A bit pricey for an italian cafe but im sure that is due to the high rent and the amount they put into the location to make it look the way it does.
2018-12-09,5,So glad this place popped up right by my apartment. Very cute, staff and owners are so friendly, and you've got to try the canolis. Sandwiches are on the pricier end and I still have to try them but everything looks delicious. Coffee is also great! Will definitely be a regular spot for me.
2018-12-03,5,They absolutely nailed my catering!! I was so glad I chose them do our family birthday party. As someone who has never had anything catered before because I love to cook, the whole prospect makes me nervous. I must say I was so relieved by the results and really proud to serve their food.  We went with a delicious meat lasagna and a lovely green salad with chickpeas, olives and feta (a custom variation on one of their menu items) with the most delicious lemony vinaigrette. The chef, Frank, really worked with me to answer my questions and consider some of our guests' dietary needs. He was lovely and the food was delicious.  The owner, Maurizio, was great as well. I had a coffee in the shop, just black, and it was excellent.  This is to say nothing of the pastries which I added to our order- chocolate sandwich cookies and vanilla cookies with sprinkles for the kids, sfogliatelle for the adults- it was all stupendous and my all Italian family, who are snobs when it comes to Italian food were raving about the whole evening.  A few said the sfogliatelle was the best they'd had. All in all Dolce and Salato did a really great job and I would recommend them to absolutely anyone for a variety of events. I'm telling you, this town has limited truly good catering options and this is a real gem.
2018-11-27,5,It's a great place that we've discovered recently: delicious both the dolce and the salato :) , friendly and welcoming staff, cozy ambiance.We were a party of 5: four adults and a baby on a Sunday afternoon. And all of us walked out happy and talking about going back there soon. Their Panettone deserves an ode! It's bound to be a centerpiece of the holiday table: food of angels, eating it resembles eating a lemony cloud with raindrops of fruit Be sure to grab one! 'tis the Season, after all!
2018-10-14,5,Love the new tiny cozy place in uptown Hoboken! Fresh servings and great hot chocolate. There are so many sweets to try out and I am surely returning there soon. Totally recommended!!!
2018-10-10,4,Love this new addition to Uptown! I live right around the corner, so I'm always happy to find new restaurants popping up nearby and on less busy streets than Washington. Hoboken has a lot of Italian restaurants, but I really think Dolce and Salato fills a gap. It's a fast-casual place and had an amazing selection of Italian paninis and salads and other lunch options. It also has lots of coffee and dessert options. I believe it closes before I typically get home from work, otherwise I'd go there for dinner often.
2018-10-07,4,I went to D @ S thinking 'another cafe, another expense place, another place to bring my laptop, another place to hang.' Was I wrong! Great place to stay on a lonely Sunday, friendly staff to keep you company, the vegetable soup was the best I ever tasted! The reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars....I can't come here every night! So its on me!
2018-10-02,5,This place is a game changer for the neighborhood. Excellent, authentic, Italian coffee, latte, etc. And truly excellent pastries. This morning I had a latte and cinnamon donut and sat outside and felt like I was in another city. This was desperately needed in Hoboken, especially uptown. 5 stars.
2018-10-01,5,This cafe is too cute to pass up! I was here with my husband to stop by for some dessert. We have never tried this place so we gave it a try for our first time. I had a decaf coffee, my husband had a double espresso and shared a small square cheesecake and a shortbread custard filled mini pie. Ooooo so good. The shortbread might be a tad too thick but it was very good - nothing was overly sweet which is a 100% win in my book for dessert. The staff are very courteous and knowledgeable of their products and explained to me what each one has in it (in case I had allergies). They have small plates for dine-in which are recyclable. I heard their lunch items are amazing so I'll have to come back to try those!! I took some Italian cookies to take home which some were made with regular flour, others in one section made with only almond flour. Overall really great, quant place to check out. Plus they have outdoor seating!
2018-09-29,3,Wayyyyy overpriced for a sub par lunch ($20 salad was mostly lettuce) Do yourself a favor and skip the food and just get coffee or a pastry here!
2018-09-25,5,Pretty new spot in Hoboken but I'm sure this is going to be a popular one.I had the calamari salad and it was really good. It's a nice portion, fresh ingredients and a very good taste.Afterwards I had a cappuccino with their torta de nona and it was delicious!Also a very friendly waitress!
2018-09-23,5,This place has very good food and maybe even better Italian pastry. I tried the sfogliatelle and the caprese torte, one of the grilled chicken paninis and  a salad. The chicken was freshly grilled and the bread was so great. The sfogliatelle was the best in Hoboken. Every single thing looks delicious and I can't wait to try more. If you are like me and grew up on Italian bakeries this will not disappoint. The cakes look so amazing I already told my husband that I want one for my birthday.
2018-09-22,5,Walked by this morning and decided to stop in, place was clean and had a lot of chairs for both indoor and outdoor seating. We tried the Nutella croissant, it was delicious. We are excited to try more things on the menu and are glad to see another local spot for food! They also had a lot of grab and go options and pre-made dinner meals and soup in the fridge. Welcome to the neighborhood!
2018-09-21,5,Sitting outside, thoroughly enjoying my Mediterranea salad. I just wish there was a beach view in front of me or a pizza with fountains. This place is on the pricier side, but I guess the rent isn't cheap in Hoboken. Going back in to spend more money on coffee. Come here and support this excellent new cafe!
2018-09-20,5,Place is spotless you could eat pastries off the floors. Very friendly and kind Italian people. Delicious latte, pastry and salad. Mauricio the owner was very pleasant. Luca, one of the workers is very nice. There was also a nice young lady behind the counter, though I didn't get her name. Everyone smiles and they treat you well. Fine selection of pastries and nice lunch menu. What's not to like?!
2018-09-16,5,Great place .Everything looks great.I didn't try everything yet but I think they have a really good cake!!!
2018-09-15,5,Amazing cafe uptown with a variety of options. I am thrilled that there is something for the folks uptown by 11th and Grand (near shoprite) where they can grab a nice bite before hitting their next destination. They are open from Mon-Fri 7AM-7PM, Sat 8-7PM, Sunday 8-6PM. They also are collaborating with Palazzone 1960 which is one of my favorites in north jersey and it's worth checking out if you ever are near the willow brook mall. Makes you feel like they brought Italy to you.  Check out their daily menu they sometimes have salmon to calamari. It's pricey but worth spending money on quality dishes.
2018-09-15,5,A very welcome addition to the neighborhood. So impressed with the food & service. Incredible, fresh pastries - sfoliatelle, assorted croissants, cream puffs - they are all fresh, very high quality & so delicious. Great selection of cookies. Excellent coffees. They also serve lunches - chicken salad is amazing.  Outdoor & indoor seating.
2018-09-06,5,We got the takeout items 1. Pasta with fresh mozzarella 2. Sausage and escarole soup. Hope my mom doesn't see this but it's better than hers and her soup is amazing. I was helped by this man who I think is the owner - what a nice person, he was very kind and helpful.
2018-09-04,5,This place is an Italian dream in Hoboken!  A step in here and you will transported.  It's absolutely beautiful inside.  It is decorated with white marble, greenery and bright lighting plus natural sunlight.  The colors of the pastries catch your eye right away.  I had the Milano coffee which was more than what I normally pay for a coffee but they really gave me a ton of Nutella in my cappuccino and made it with soy milk which was a plus.  Not every place has soy milk (these days they should) but especially for an Italian place to have it is impressive since they don't serve it there, either.  I will be back and will definitely try the pastries!
2018-09-04,4,Coffee and pastries are amazing. Although I didn't taste the gelato, it looked equally as good as the cookies and cake. Staff was also friendly and welcoming. The only negative was it's a little overpriced; however, it's Hoboken and that's to be expected.
2018-08-25,5,Awesome coffee!! Yummy food! Great addition to the neighborhood, finally. The place is very clean, and service was ok so far, but the main thing that would bring me back is the coffee.
2018-08-25,5,I was driving in the area and noticed Dolce & Salato. This place is super chic and the service was really fast. Definitely a spot to go with your friends and not that busy (early Saturday afternoon). This place is perfect to stop and get your morning coffee and pastry! This is my new favorite spot!
2018-08-17,4,Loved this place! It was very nice! Had a great modern vibe to it very clean and the staff is nice and look like they know what they are doing. They also have a nice assortment of pastries, wish I could have all of them. You can eat outside with nice furniture. I enjoy caramel machiatto, unfortunately they don't have carame syrup =[ lol had the cappuccino instead.Tip: Don't leave plates and utensils on the tables, they have a designated area for you to put away the dirty dishes. Do the right thing =]
2018-08-12,3,A classy new addition to uptown Hoboken. Great selection of classic pastries, paninis, coffee and gelato. It has an authentic Italy feel as the gelato flavors are only in Italian. I'm cool with that because it takes me back to my days in Florence and amazing gelato and cappuccinos. For gelato flavors We had the nocciola (hazelnut), fragola (strawberry), and vanilla - all were great. Also had the classic pignoli cookies SO GOOD! Unfortunately they need to step up there service speed. Otherwise this is a 4 or 5 star joint for sure!
2018-08-12,3,Food is good but a bit overpriced for the amount you get. They are still working out some kinks as our sandwich was incorrect but they apologized and made a fresh one along with some c
2018-08-10,5,Great addition to the uptown area! The owner is very friendly and I had great service both times that I visited in the past week. I didn't get to try the gelato so I guess I'll have to go back soon! The fried tortelloni is amazing, great marinara sauce on the side! My Macchiato took me back to Italy. I went with a bunch of Mom friends and we tried a bunch of small pastries, they were all delicious! Also as a bunch of moms with crazy babies around the age of one they were very accommodating. I love that they have buzzers to collect your food when it's ready as it can get quite busy. I will definitely be back again and again!
2018-08-07,5,Loved the food!  Good variety and selections of salads and sandwiches.  Hope they stay around since there are no other options in the area.  I recommend the Emily.
2018-08-06,4,Welcome to the hood but please be sure to step up your game in the coming weeks. Pastries looked delicious. Ordered a $15 sandwich and over 15 mins later still no sandwich unfortunately. While I understand your sandwiches are made "fresh", so are most at cafes and delis nearby. Please step up your speed especially for take-out food and you will be a 5 Stars spot!
2018-08-06,5,Welcome to Hoboken!  It's nice to see a tasty option open  somewhere besides Washington St.  The Italian style bakery serves specialty coffees, sandwiches and most of all, baked sweets.  Sandwiches are a bit on the pricey side, but hey, that's Hoboken - and the coffee is cheaper and better than Starbucks.
