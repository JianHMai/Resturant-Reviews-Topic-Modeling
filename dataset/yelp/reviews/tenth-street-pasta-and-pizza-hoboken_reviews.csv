2021-11-14,1,This was rated a 8.6 on One Bite, Dave Portnoy is on fucking drugsThe server came up to the table to take our order"One plain pie and we'll start with the meatballs"He must have misheard what I said as "make sure the food sucks and that we have an unpleasant experience" because that's exactly what we got.Cracker thin crust with less 15% of the pizza having any sauce on it. It was a chore choking down slice after slice, we eventually gave up.Quick little tip: fix the fucking door that slams closed every time someone enters and exits your place. There's nothing like having your dinner serenaded every few minutes by a loud fucking bang.
2021-10-24,1,Something has definitely changed in their recipe. I used to LOVE this pizza and now it tastes like they're using cheap ingredients or they changed the cook. Something is different. It's a shame because they were so good but the last few months I've ordered, it's very bland.. burnt and doesn't have the same flavor it did. I think they let the barstool review go to their head and started skimping out on the quality. Not sure, but I won't be returning. For the price, the pizza should be nothing short of excellent and consistent every time.
2021-10-14,1,Went a few weeks ago while visiting a friend. Heard decent things, so we checked it out. Service was terrible. Outside of ours, there was one other table, but somehow it took over an hour for one pizza to come out. The water thing is insane - they won't give you regular tap, you have to buy bottled. They don't even tell you this, so if you're with a big family/kids just be aware. The pizza straight up sucked too. It was very bland and tasted more like a pasta sauce. Also came out fairly cold. Idk, not for me. Best thing about it was that it confirmed the barstool guy is loser and full of crap.
2021-10-03,1,Live close by been wanting to try this spot for a long time. As a local, I want to give this place a good rating but long story short... it just does not deliver. First, the service is terrible. Asked for a glass of water but forced to get bottled waters... the pizza itself was mediocre at best.. certain bites were totally bland... couldn't even finish the pie ... el presidente let us down
2021-09-30,5,Absolutely loved their pizza. I've had delivery a couple of times from here and really enjoyed it but just tried it fresh for the first time a couple of weeks ago and was blown away. So thin and crispy - I don't know if we just got lucky but nothing was burnt at all. Naked meatballs also reminded me of my moms. Highly recommend!
2021-09-21,5,THE BEST PIZZA AROUND TOWN! Worth the $ - all the food is really good. No complaints at all. Shout out to Angel who already knows us and how we like the pizza. The best pizza in the tri state!
2021-09-10,1,Seriously the worst. Don't go because you saw the barstool review. Over an hour waiting for a takeout order for ONE pie. Unbelievable this is after waited the 30mins they said it would take. The week prior they gave me the wrong order. So slow you can find much better pizza not worth your time
2021-09-04,1,Tenth Street Pizza is a big round ZERO! I ate here this past Friday night and all I can tell you is their pizza is horrible! It's crispy, but it's too crispy.  I ordered my pie with extra cheese and it was still very little cheese.  There is a soupy orange sauce on their pizza.  It's not red tomato sauce, which would make sense.  This orange sauce is as disgusting to eat as it is to look at.  None of the ingredients of their pizza tasted good.  Awful just awful!
2021-08-30,5,Absolutely amazing pizza. A little different than your typical jersey slice but in the best way. Very fresh and crispy and they have the tiny pepperonis which are my personal favorite.This restaurant has a large outdoor seating area as it is on the corner of the street (seating on both sides). The inside is slightly more limited in seating and is a little more upscale than a typical pizzeria. One pie is always more than enough for two people with some left over for the next day! I have had the Bolognese here as well but I prefer the pizza when dining here as there are other spots in town with better Bolognese.This restaurant is byob but has soda and water available for purchase. Definitely a must try in Hoboken.
2021-08-21,3,4% fee for credit card, plastic cups for our wine, only option for water is to buy Poland spring?... Took an hour to get our pizza which arrived luke warm. The pizza was delicious but unfortunately it was overshadowed by the feeling of getting nickeled and dimed.
2021-07-23,1,We were so excited to try this place due to the barstool review... but wow we were disappointed. I will say the atmosphere is very nice and the wait time was nothing for a Friday night, so that was nice.  But we were charged for water, given a can of coke instead of fountain and also a completely charred pizza. It would of been a better experience, except when we complained that the pizza was not edible the waitress just kept telling us it's "well done" LOL she offered no solution. It was black on the bottom. So needless to say we won't be going back. And when reading these reviews there are a TON that say the same thing.
2021-07-19,3,I came here for sit down dinner and the pizza came at a luke warm temperature. By my second slice it was cold. When I expect to eat pizza at a restaurant, I expect it to come hot especially when the menu describes it as "well done." The pizza had to have been sitting in the kitchen for a while before they brought it out.  Although the pizza  was good, I was disappointed by my experience.
2021-07-18,4,Absolutely delicious square pie, half with ricotta peppers and pesto, but we didn't enjoy the Tenth St Pasta quite as much -- garlic flavor was a bit off.
2021-07-15,4,Food was really delicious! Small menu to choose from and a little pricey but overall the food is worth the price. BYOB if you're interested. Staff was very nice.
2021-07-07,2,I was shocked that it cost $89 bucks for 2 pies and a small salad. VERY overpriced, borderline robbery. I called in to place the order and was told that I'd get a text or call when the order was ready. I didn't get a call for over an hour so I called back and they said "oh my bad, it's ready" . My 38 dollar pizza was cold so I won't be coming back.
2021-06-28,3,The pizza was ok expensive and really greasy; the thing that rubbed me the wrong was was charging for water and charging a fee to use a credit card. Credit cards are a normal part of everyone's lives. We shouldn't have to hit an atm because of cheap ownership. The pizza was good; not great. Not my first choice in that area.
2021-06-11,2,I can't believe that more people aren't outraged that they charge $34 + credit card service charge for such a mediocre tasting and greasy pizza. Won't be bothering with that again.
2021-06-11,5,My boyfriend and I finally tried this restaurant out and we were very happy we did. Everyone working there was accommodating and they're byob which is always a plus. We just ordered a pie with half pepperoni no apps...the pie came out hot, crispy and delicious. Tenth Street became our favorite pizza in Hoboken hands down. We can't wait to return and try some other items on their menu!!
2021-06-05,5,Probably the best pizza in Hoboken, and very friendly staff. The pepperoni square pie had a generous amount of cheese and toppings. Very happy will be back!
2021-06-05,4,This was amazing pizza! Me and my brother visited bc it was rated so highly by Dave Portnoy and it def lived up to the hype, pizza was thin but not too thin and it had the perfect ratio of cheese and sauce of good quality. Also this place is BYOB with a liquor store within walking distance.The only reason I'm not giving this a 5 star review is bc a large standard pie was $26; which is prob the highest I've paid for pizza in NJ
2021-05-31,5,Best pizza in town by far!  Best in person but still really good when delivered.  Make sure to ask for the spicy olive oil spread.
2021-05-18,5,Amazing pizza, amazing staff, so friendly. Such a great place to go on a date or with a group. Having Angel as your server makes the experience even more phenomenal, keep it up guys!!
2021-05-15,1,Was super excited to try this place until we got sat and waited 20 minutes without ever having anyone come to our table. Ruined my night, especially because other places had over an hour wait. Thanks for nothing!
2021-05-10,5,Love love love their pizza!! I am a person who loves her wood fired pizza and tenth street makes them the best in Hoboken! We are long time Hoboken residents and had stumbled upon the place when they had recently opened but I never got to writing a review so here we go!I have tried multiple pizzas but I like that we can add custom vegetables. Being a vegetarian that is super convenient. This time we tried the burrata appetizer and margarita pizza with olives and onions. The burrata was great! And the pizza was amazingly flavorful with a crispy crust and soft cheesy top. We really like their sauce with the way they prepare their base. We have also tried their classic and white pizzas and they are equally good! Also the ricotta crostini is really good. All in all it is a very homely place. There is always a wait to get a table so make sure you call them in advance and give them enough time for takeout.
2021-04-30,5,Best pizza in Hoboken without a question. Honestly the best pizza I've ever had (even better than Brooklyn!) Their apps are really good too.
2021-04-14,5,Let me tell you, I just moved to the area and was looking for pizza to try and this was the BEST PIE AROUND. Ordered a margherita pizza for delivery, came super quick and the driver was very communicative and friendly. Pizza was crisp, tasty, and the ingredients were amazing. BEST pizza in Hoboken!
2021-03-29,5,I cannot believe this placed is ranked 3.5- this is a mistake! They are a 10/10!!! The Square pizza is my best friend and I am obsessed with their garlic crushed pepper oil. You have to try it!!! They have a chef who comes out and gives you tastes of bread and she's great. Love this spot. Best pie in town!
2021-03-24,5,If I could give this place 6 stars I would. I've eaten here/ordered take out numerous times and it is my favorite pizza place in Hoboken (Verizza is my second). I can speak for their regular pie, meatballs in sauce and chicken parm sandwich. Amazing. The staff is also extremely on top of their game, they know their stuff, very professional, fast to greet you, they are very nice, make sure you got what you ordered. I appreciate you guys!
2021-03-20,3,Came here a few weeks ago for dinner with my friends. Pizza was delicious!! Thin crust and very flavorful. The reason I am giving this 3 stars is because of the appetizers and the pasta. We got meatballs and ricotta for appetizers. The ricotta had no taste and the meatballs were cold inside!! We were not pleased by the appetizers at all and were disappointed because they all sounded so good. The pasta was decent, but again you'd think it would taste better. Definitely recommend this place for pizza only.
2021-03-18,5,Seriously may be my favorite pizza I've ever had! On-top of just pizza, their ricotta crostini, Cacio e Pepe, and Tenth Street pasta all never disappoint. Angel and the other employees work hard and ensure we have an amazing experience every time!
2021-03-13,5,Amazing pizza. This is our go to pizza place in Hoboken. The classic pie, or the margarita are the best.
2021-02-27,5,I have to say- as a pizza connoisseur- this ranks one of the highest pizzas I've ever had (and I've been to MANY pizza places- top places, Joe's, Mamas Too, Price street, etc). The atmosphere is truly adorable and relaxing all in one. Drove from Long Island all the way to Hoboken, and I'd do it all over again in a heart beat. Service was great, the flavor of the pizza was incredible. I liked the square better than the round- so I'd definitely go with that over the round if I had to pick one. Freshest ingredients, crispy, came out hot...don't walk, run.
2021-02-14,5,For several reasons, this is easily the best pizza I've had on my quest to find the Best Pizza in NJ/NY.I'm assuming the sauce must be cooked prior to the pizza being made because it's perfectly seasoned and savory as opposed to tangy and acidic.  The cheese is tight, has just enough chewiness and flavor - possibly a custom, homemade blend they're making on-site. Also, that little bit of shaved parmesan adds a great touch.Top-notch dough and tastes like the bread of an old-school bakery. Loving the fresh basil. That garlic, chili-pepper oil is a tremendous add-on and the perfect heat and flavor combo. Sidenote: on this same day, my buddy and I ate John's of Bleecker, which was good. This is much better. Pending to try: Lucali, DiFara, DeLorenzo's, Conte's, DeNino's, Sally's ApizzaTerrific service and again, easily best pizza I've had in NJ and best pizza in Hudson County by light years. The difference between this place and second in Hudson would be like comparing the star of the varsity team to a nice player on the freshman team.*Applause*
2021-02-11,1,Want to begin by saying that I was very excited coming to this place especially after David's (el presidente) review, but unfortunately I was extremely disappointed with my dining experience all together. So here we go. My friend and I got a whole classic cheese pie. When the pizza was served to us, I noticed that one of the slices was a lot smaller than the rest as you can see below. I didn't give much attention to it as I was still very excited to try it for the first time. My disappointment continued after the first bite. Pizza is just barely warm not remotely hot. Furthermore pizza felt very crispy without any flop that you typically expect with a fresh out of the oven pie. We asked the server who was nice and apologizing to warm it up for us and we then spoke to the manager who didn't take our criticism very well failing to offer a sincere apology. The pie was still good but I really wish it was fresh as you would expect at a sit down restaurant. P.s i hate to be the person to offer a bad review especially in the time of a pandemic. My intention is not to harm this business, but please don't serve an old warmed up pie to anyone, it is quite disrespectful.
2021-02-05,4,My pizza arrived cold and it's still the best pizza I've had since moving to Hoboken. Will definitely order again, but will ask for extra garlic oil.
2021-01-24,1,I just got back from driving 20 minutes into hoboken to pick up a square bufala mutz pie and unfortunately left no with pizza. When I arrived I was told by an employee that my pizza separated and opened the box to show me. There was sauce all over the box, the crust was completely burnt, and the cheese had fallen off. I asked if I could have a new one and the employee spoke with the cook and showed him the pizza, and he responded by pushing the pizza back together and presenting to me what it was supposed to look like. I was expecting a yes when I asked for a new pizza since it cost $55 which is also just insane but #Hoboken and it's my birthday. At that point I just asked for my money back which they were nice enough to accommodate. This place was the best 3 or 4 years ago.
2021-01-23,2,Was our go to pizza in Hoboken before they increased their prices. They are priced above the very best NYC pizza places I love from Lucali's to John's. $24+$8 for a round pepperoni and $34 for a square... Covid or not, I'm so incredibly disappointed in the owners decision!
2021-01-21,1,great pizza, absolutely terrible service. Regularly try to order through them on PostMates, only to have the delivery guy call me when here's there to pick up say "they don't deal with PostMates" .... OK... so get off the App then. tried to work it out with the manager and he was arrogant, unapologetic and totally unhelpful.
2021-01-09,5,Get delivery here all the time, by far best pizza in Hoboken. Would go as far to say as they beat some of the more famous pizzas in the city. Just had a pizza delivered and it came very cold. I called to let them know and they immediately sent me another pizza free of charge. Could tell that the second time they made the pizza and had someone drive it straight out. It's that kind of service that makes these guys the best around.
2020-12-19,3,Pizza was good not great and very overpriced. I love a square pizza with a crunchy crust. However, the crust was soggy, there was no crisp at all and not very flavorful. The cheese also tasted oily. I was so excited to try Tenth Street, but it fell short of expectations. At $40 for a plain pizza, it's just not worth it.
2020-12-11,5,This might be some of the best Iv ever had. It's worth every penny! Trust the method, the grandma style pan pizza is something you can't find anywhere else!
2020-11-29,4,The ExperienceSince everyone had fled the NYC area for thanksgiving the cute outdoor seating was nicely empty. The heat lamps helped us pretend we weren't eating outside in the winter and the BYOB policy allowed me to warm myself with copious amounts of red wine. The service wasn't as good as the ambiance. We had to ask for utensils, ask twice for water, and there was a snafu with the bill.The AccoutrementsWe got the "naked meatballs" which wasn't an 80's adult film but rather a sauceless appetizer. Instead of marinara, you got a hot pepper and ricotta on the side. The meatballs had a rich meaty flavor that stood on their own without the sauce. The pepper and ricotta added a fun dynamic. The pepper left this lasting tingle on the tongue which you could cool down with the ricotta. Overall a more interesting take on the normal saucy meatballs.The Main CourseThe pizza is in their name and so it had to be good. We got a classic pie with mushrooms, pepperoni, and arugula. The stand out topping was the pepperoni. This was not your bargain been cheapo roni this was top tier rounds of red flavor. Speaking of red, the sauce tasted so fresh I started looking around for the garden they picked the tomatoes from. Grab a pie here and you won't be disappointed.The VerdictRealistically this is 3.5. The service was 3 stars if I'm being generous. However, the atmosphere and food were a 4-star situation. Since I'm a glass half full guy I'll round up to 4 stars. Your waiters might not be attentive but your taste buds will appreciate your patience.
2020-11-27,2,You'll get a good pizza here once in a blue moon... about the most inconsistent I've ever had. And don't even thinking about picking up... they text you when your pizza is "done" and you come and pick it up cold. What kind of place can't give you a decent estimate on timing?? No pizza can make up for such incompetent management.
2020-11-27,3,The first time I bought a pizza at Tenth Street, it was excellent! They have great pizza recipes. The prices are on the high side because they do use premium ingredients. I have, however, found a consistency issue. I've been mostly a takeout customer. The first few pies were spot on. My favorite is the round pizza with half sausage/peppers. After my couple of awesome takeout experiences, the inconsistency crept in. One pizza was no longer warm (didn't get the phone call to pick up, stopped in after 40 minutes). Another pizza was very charred and dark on the bottom. On my last takeout, they forgot the peppers on my sausage/peppers side. I'm sure if I went back, they'd make it right, but for pizzas with extra toppings that can add up to over $30, getting it right the first time is key. They do have a nicely put together streetery for outdoor dining (now with chilly-weather heating). The indoor dining tables are separated properly for social distancing.   Overall, I'm a fan and with more consistency I'll support them loyally.
2020-11-23,3,Didn't quite live up to all the hype from El Presidente. Lot of crunch but unfortunately somewhat lacking flavors - looks great at first. Could use more sauce and missing that cheesy pull that makes pizza so satisfying. Can't quite put my finger on it but its neither thin crust or traditional, kinda like a frozen pizza done extra crispy in the oven (don't get me wrong, I'm sure they are using gourmet quality ingredients). Several reviews complain about the pizza being burnt and can see that...borders on the line of being too hard around the edges. Short window of pizza coming out when its too hot to eat vs becoming a cold, undesirable slab, this is probably not a pizza you want delivered.  Give it a try...understand why some people might like it but just not my thing.
2020-11-13,1,I never, ever write reviews but we went to Tenth street pizza last night and it was a very stressful and disconcerting night. My husband and I live a block away and have always enjoyed the pizza from Tenth street. We we last there a few weeks ago and sat outside, the tables were all spaced safely apart and all the servers were wearing masks. It was an enjoyable experience and there was even a lovely older gentlemen that gifted us a burrata salad on the house. At the end of the night a woman who works at or owns the establishment came out without a mask to give away free bread to the tables that were left. It was a nice gesture but unsettling because she was going table to table with no facial covering. We just said no thank you as she approached us.  I understand the desire to socialize and interact with customers but it was bizarre and unsafe. We decided to try dining inside Tenth street last night because almost no one was there. There were three tables including ourselves all spaced very well apart. The waiters were wearing masks, although sometimes below the nose but the effort was somewhat there. After our salad and before our pizza arrived the same woman comes walking into the indoor dining room with no mask, proceeds to sit down at the table with four people by the window and chat to them, and then walk around the dining room talking to the servers without a thought to any of the diners in the restaurant. She clearly didn't care at all.  My husband finally walked over and asked her very nicely to put a mask on, he explained that our son is on chemo and the cases in Hoboken are spiking again.  It was clear she really doesn't care about the health of her customers, we took our pizza and went home. As much as we want to support our local restaurants, if they don't care about the health and safety of their customers we cannot. We will continue to walk a block in the other direction to Anthony David's where they are doing everything they can to ensure the customer is safe and comfortable. Last night was a highly stressful and disappointing at Tenth Street Pizza.
2020-11-09,3,The hype has picked up on this place recently and so I had to do a redo.  The first time I wasn't too impressed and the second time it was about the same. On first glance the pizza looks really good. Very instagram friendly if you are into that! Unfortunately, the food looks a lot better than it tastes.  Everything was heavy and salty which was surprising. First off the Chicken parm sandwich is a small sandwich and way overpriced ($17).  There was barely any meat on it. The bread also was very hard. If you aren't careful you can lose a tooth. The focaccia with fried fried proscuitto de parma was good but the proscuitto was very salty. It had mozzarella as well that helped cut the salt but to no avail. Now for the pizza which is probably the reason people come..  the pizza is good but missing that addicting quality where you can't stop eating it. I ate 2 slices and I was done. The cheese makes the pizza heavy and salty and it makes me not want to keep eating.  I was bloated after. The 5 star pizza places are different where I can't stop eating those pizza's. Tenth street pizza is a decent place but unfortunately doesn't live up to the hype. I would stick with 3 stars here.
2020-11-05,3,I've been here 3 times and I've yet to see what all the hype is about. We've tried the Sicilian Pizza and that was the only pizza we actually enjoyed, but our experience was turned off by a manager cursing out a cook when one of us went to the bathroom.I can recommend the sausage and peppers appetizer- very oily, but incredibly tasty. This place has some serious potential but I think it's simply mismanaged.
2020-11-01,5,Finally getting around to reviewing here. I came by to get a pie to go to share it with a few friends of mine. I was an occasional writer on my one friend's website, ThatsSoCheezy.com, which did pizza reviews and since he loves thin crust and a small amount of sauce, I knew my go to.Food: unfortunately I have not been able to really sit down and enjoy a full meal, but their pies are incredible. Thin crust, more cheesy then saucy, and what I believe to be grated pecorino romano (correct me if I am wrong) on the top of a large pie is incredible. The price is significantly higher then the average pie, but part of me thinks it's worth it.Service: All of the people I have interacted with there were really good and professional.Aesthetic: I haven't actually been into the establishment but from what I can see it is well maintained and very modern.
2020-10-18,4,The only pizza in the area that's actually crispy! I live in the weehawken area and it's tough to find pizza that can compare to a NY slice and that has a crispy crust, tenth street does it well. A little pricy but worth it.
2020-10-02,2,Excellent pizza...BUT we waited over an hour and a half for our pizza and never even received plates for everyone at the table. After asking for waters for the table, the owner got them and slammed them on the table and said "you don't need to come back." By the end of the night he graciously invited us to meet him out back for a nice little fist fight. Cool guy, but again excellent pizza.
2020-09-27,1,Was here last night for dinner. We were skipped on the list by another two top who walked up because the servers and manager didn't communicate about there being a wait list..once we got our table, the same server who skipped us then opened our wine and left..No cups?? We ordered ricotta crostini, margherita pie and the bolognese. The app and pie came first...the pasta we had to remind the server about multiple times and to multiple servers because they would come and ask if we wanted anything else...yes the pasta we ordered over an hour ago..!! You would think based on the service and wait times they would comp the $6 you have to pay to have water but nope..will not be back. Their pizza is not worth the rude manager and terrible service..such a same since back in February we had a much better experience
2020-09-22,5,Sat down for outdoor dining late last night (around 8:45). Outdoor dining area was spacious, well-lit, BYOB, and comfortable. Our waiter, Freddy, was the best! He was very friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and came to check on us just the right amount of times. We got the square pizza and the chicken parm- both were delicious and portions were large enough to give us leftovers for the following day. Will be back soon (and requesting Freddy)!
2020-09-12,1,I'm pretty upset to have to get them 1 Star when in fact I love their pizza. However since they've had outdoor dining we come 1x/week at least (unless we get delivery) but everything has gone downhill. They forget apps every time, or don't bring them at all. And when you order for delivery they won't even call to say they delivered it. It seems pride has really gotten to their heads and it's sad to see.
2020-09-12,1,I've had the pizza here a few times historically but this place is proof that service can negate good food. They forgot our apps. Then brought out the wrong ones after they forgot them. Then had to chase them down for the check. Pride comes before the fall...I get the sense they're relying on their good pizza rep and compromising on everything else. Please do better.
2020-09-12,2,One of our favorite pizzas in Hoboken but the service is terrible. The new streatery is great but in our 7-10 trips here the last 3 months every time they have forgotten apps, brought wrong pies out, and just totally forgotten about us. It's unfortunate because the taste is great but they don't know how to deliver that to customers.
2020-09-11,4,I first ordered takeout pizza from here a year ago and was so dissatisfied with the burnt crust it was very hard to go back. We decided to check out the restaurant in person and WOW what a great place to eat! The pizza and pasta were to die for! I wish I didn't wait so long to try here (in person) because they honestly may have one of the best Cacio e Pepe in Hoboken!
2020-09-08,4,Adorable spot for an outdoor date night! I loved their outdoor seating and would highly recommend trying this spot. It is also BYOB - which I personally LOVE. The White pizza was delightful and so was our Focaccia and prosciutto appetizer. Took off 1 star because the service was very, very slow. But the amazing food made up for it!
2020-08-27,4,Tenth street is a strong addition to the pizza scene in Hoboken.  Even with their expanded streatery/outdoor dining, you may have to wait for a table here.  They also seem to have a steady flow of takeout orders.  Their menu is short & concise and sticks to the basics. Their pizzas come well down & are nice and crispy. They also prepare their own olive oil with garlic & red pepper which you can drizzle on your slice if you like a little heat.   Their pizza is always good.  I've also tried their Tenth Street pasta dish which was pretty good - please note even though the menu doesn't mention it, there is a ton of garlic in that pasta dish. Tenth street is BYO which is an added bonus.   Definitely will be back in the future!
2020-08-26,5,What a gem in Hoboken! Took a visit last week and regret it took us so long to try out this place. We ordered the famous square pie, the naked meatballs and the antipasto. Everything was absolutely delicious. We wanted to get everything on the menu but our stomachs just didn't allow that...which is why we can't wait to go back! It's BYOB (loveeee) and they have a nice outdoor space set up due to Covid. The staff was attentive and food came out quick. Highly recommend! Oh and ask for the pepper oil to put on the pizza...game changer
2020-08-23,1,If you are looking this up on yelp to decide if you want to eat here, let me save you the hour wait and the very overpriced burnt pizza experience. My friend told me this pizza was going to be great. Unfortunately, we had a terrible experience. We were seated in uncomfortable chairs and asked if we were ready to order two mins later. We asked for drinks and water. Drinks come warm in a can that you pour into a plastic cup with ice in it. You have to PAY FOR WATER, which is unbelievable, but okay we'll let that slide. Half hour after we order, we ask if our pizza is almost ready. The waiter realizes that no one put the order in for us. So he comes back out and tells us it will be 5 mins. 10 mins go by and we're asked to move to a different table because they want to close our section. We are polite people, so we say okay and move. Another 10 mins goes by (50mins total now) and still no pizza. Some random lady walking from across the street overhears us and asks us what we ordered and then rudely tells us it's coming soon (obviously had no clue what she was talking about). We believe she may be the owner or manager. Another 10 mins goes by, so we are fed up. Politely told the workers that we're leaving because of the ridiculous wait. A server tells me he is sorry for this (first nice person we speak to all night who seems he wants to be helpful). As we are leaving, he tells us to just wait a minute and he'll give us the pizza for free (a $40 square pepperoni pizza). So we agreed. We took the pizza and ate it by the water. It was decent pizza, but it was super oily, very heavy, and burnt to a crisp. This pizza was worth exactly what we paid for it, $0. Will never visit this place or the owner's other place, tenth and Willow, again. No thanks from me.
2020-08-23,1,I am in disbelief by the altercation that occurred in this restaurant. We had a unbelievably rude waiter. From the second we got there the service was terrible, the waiter doesn't greet us doesn't introduce himself just asks if we are ready to order 10 mins after being seated. But that wasn't our issue, after receiving our pizza my partner was in the midst of grabbing a slice and the waiter comes over and tells us "this isn't your pizza" and snatches the pizza right out of his hands. Instead of apologizing for his actions he denies his approach while smart mouthing which escalated the situation. Had he been honest and respectful the outcome would have been different. I have never experienced that kind of service anywhere and will never spend my money here again. I hope the owner handles this situation accordingly.
2020-08-22,5,My favorite pizza. "Well done" classic Hoboken style .. if you don't know then you (incorrectly) call it burnt and won't appreciate the true artistry behind it.  The cacio e pepe and brocc rabe are also *chefs kiss*.  A million stars 10/10
2020-08-03,5,Best pizza in Hoboken by far. I dream of that garlic oil! Also, great COVID safety precautions.
2020-08-01,5,Love this spot. I love the outdoor tables, and the service is always really great - despite how busy they may be (and they get super busy). My only qualm is that they don't provide ice buckets for the drinks (it's BYOB), but other than that, it's an amazing spot for amazing pizza. I've had the classic pizza (usually with pepperoni), which is always cooked to perfection, and the pepperoni is always perfectly crispy and delicious. The square pies are always well done, but not burnt, and they're crispy but still fluffy in the middle. My friends and I are a huge fan of the meat and cheese plate (anti-pasto), which comes with toasted bread, a generous portion of various cheeses, a salami or prosciutto, and their house-made pepper relish. I'm not sure how they can handle all of the tables and their takeout orders, but their staff is always on top of everything and never make you feel like you're being rushed. Prob some of the best pizza I've had in hoboken - def recommend.
2020-07-26,5,Husband and I were walking by last night and decided to dine on a whim. We ordered one pizza - half with arugula and prosciutto, half with meatballs and hot peppers. Best pizza ever. Leftovers were amazing too. Will be back.
2020-07-19,1,It's 95 degrees out, there is nobody at the restaurant right now, we turned one of there outdoor table so we could both have shade. Apparently that's not allowed because "they are going to get busy." The only other table in the shade is a 4 person table, GOD forbid if two people sat there. I heard the food is amazing but these people are assholes.
2020-07-18,1,Shame, great pizza. Horrible customer service. I ordered 2 sodas with my pizza, both arrived warm. I called them to ask if I can get a refund and that they can come back and get the sodas if they want. The manager told me it's "obvious" they would be warm because they never refrigerate their sodas, and I would know that if I ever ordered from them before. And I should've asked for cold soda if I wanted it. Then she says I could easily put them in my fridge or use ice. Oh really? Is that how I make my drinks colder? Gee thanks. Not everyone has ice ready and I never had a pizza place deliver warm sodas before. They also forgot the garlic oil that comes with every pizza and I specifically asked for, and rudely told me that's a courtesy so I shouldn't complain about it. I've delivered food before so I'm not about to make their driver come back to my 4th floor apartment to get me a cup of oil so I just hung up on them. Btw, this is for a 46 dollar bill, for 1 large pizza and 2 warm sodas lol.
2020-07-17,1,Don't understand the huge hype for this place whatsoever.   Got the 30 dollar dollar square pie with mozzarella --- burnt to a crisp upon arrival and wasn't stellar.  So disappointing. Also got the bruschetta for like 15 bucks four small slices ehhh sub par.  All in all I do not recommend this place --- wayyyyy over rated.  Go somewhere else and save ya money honey!  Way better in Hoboken.
2020-07-16,5,Square pie is the best Pizza in Hoboken.
2020-07-02,2,By far some of the best pizza in Hoboken...but you have to PAY FOR TAP WATER. This is just the most absurd thing I've ever heard of. You can't get any type of water there unless you pay for it. It's unfortunate because a lot of people are turned off by this when the pizza really does speak for itself. If you didn't have to pay for water, and the apps were more consistent, this place would be a 10/10.
2020-06-29,3,I would have given this place 3.5 stars if there was an option. I feel like it's too pricey for what it is. I ordered a plain our and it was 22 dollars. I eat a lot of pizza and I feel like Grimaldi's has a better and reasonable pricing for their pizza. Their pizza isn't certainly bad but it's not a premium pizza. It's very well-done to the crisp so certain people might not like it but I like the crispy pizza crust. One thing I really liked about them is that they gave me chilly oil on the side. That was super delicious and flavorful.
2020-06-21,4,Amazing thin crust pizza - great BYOB place with a small menu. Apps can be hit or miss but don't miss out on their homemade peppers and be sure to ask for the homemade chili oil to put on your pizza. You won't be disappointed. Even take out is good.
2020-06-17,5,Being that we got Tenth Street takeout, I can only imagine how good this place is when you dine in. We got a square pie with half pepperoni and a side of cacio e pepe. The pasta had the right flavors, but most pastas you need to eat fresh, not 30-45 mins later. The pizza is amazing. It says on the menu they cook it well done which is my favorite. Also, they give you hot oil! It's a perfect pizza topper. It's definitely some of the best pizza I've had lately, and once restaurants reopen, I will be visiting Tenth Street immediately.
2020-06-12,5,I've been to a lot of pizza spots and this is up there with some of the best I've had. Best pizza I had in NJ and competes with the best in NYC. The sauce is phenomenal especially with the hot oil on the side . Yeah it might be a little expensive but I think it's worth it. This is a must try for pizza lovers
2020-05-10,5,I love pizza. Probably more than any other food. If I had a choice of one food for the rest of my life, I'd likely choose pizza. So when I say I've have what could be the best pizza ever I am coming from a place of experience. I had a square pie from Tenth St. last night. Absurdly good. So worth the price. Go. Now.
2020-04-26,3,I like their normal pies but the square pizza was very disappointing. Dough was tough to bite into and was too chewy
2020-04-23,5,How is this only 3.5 stars!?! I understand if people don't care for the owners but I saw this on one bite and was surprised about the review he gave them and had to check it out. We got the pepperoni pizza and meatballs - both were incredible! The pizza was crispy and flavorful. I'm so excited for it to open back up! The meatballs were beautiful. You have to give it a try and bring a bottle of wine because it's byob
2020-04-22,5,ordered for the first time last week and now i'm hooked! if you love a crispy pizza this is your place. yes, the food may take some time to prepare - but just order early and let them do their magic. I already returned to buy a second pie and try their sandwiches & the quality and taste were just as delicious as my prior visit. they definitely gained a new regular customer!
2020-04-08,1,It was burned to a crisp. I don't get how they can send out burned to a crisp pizzas to their customers. (So many reviews stating that so apparently that's not a rare incident) Crust is my favorite part and it was inedible. The sauce was in glubs and because it was so overcooked the cheese was hard and barely there. I waited an hour and a half to get this below average pizza.
2020-04-04,1,The food is pretty good but the owner is extremely rude and temperamental.  You would think with all the Italian places here he'd be somewhat gracious but he's not!  I will never go back there again.
2020-03-27,1,Tried calling like 10 times within a 30 minute time period to try to order (because they are too cheap to be on seamless or any other mobile ordering) to no answer. They are somewhat nearby so figured maybe there is something wrong with their phone. Walked all the way there only to find that they wouldn't take my order as it was 'too late' despite it being over 30 minutes before their supposed closing time. Very disappointed as I was trying to support a small business during this crazy coronavirus time period and they wouldn't even take my order. Good pizza but you need to run a better business.
2020-03-23,5,LOVE this place - the staff is super friendly, and the food is always good. Both the pizza and pasta are awesome, and it's BYOB so it ends up being super affordable. They also have great outdoor dining in the summer. Tenth Street has become our "default" restaurant on a Friday night and we never get sick of it.
2020-03-21,2,It took 5 calls to place an order for 1 pie, pickup. After an hour and ten minutes I called 9 times to check on the status, no answer. I received a call 9mins before the city curfew that it was ready; seems they waited for all pickups until last minute. I picked up my lukewarm pizza to be greeted by a less than pleasant employee who couldn't so much as say thank you. I realize we are currently under extenuating circumstances but there should still be a standard of service or at minimum additional communication that things will take longer because of staffing. It shouldn't be an hour and a half to pick up a single $40 barely hot pizza.
2020-03-13,1,This actually breaks my heart to write because I have been right here with this place since day one. I live right around the corner and have dined here dozens of times. I have been to parties and even held a dinner party here once. I have ignored the reviews about Mario because  we love Chris Manzo and the rest of the staff, but WOW I have never in my life experienced customer service like I have tonight, and I will try to avoid 4 letter words to describe the experience. As we are in the beginning of a Coronavirus outbreak (first case in hoboken announced today) I felt it was important to leave the house and support the local restaurants as many encourage to do. We arrived at 6:15pm when the place was still half empty and opted to sit outside. We ordered a salad, pasta and plain pizza. The salad and pasta came out right away, but by 7:15pm there still wasn't any pizza and my 7 year old daughter was starving. At this point the restaurant was packed with takeout and diners. I walked up to Mario saying "we ordered a plain pie an hour ago can you check on it." He gestured to the dining room showing me it's packed (I still don't know why that is an excuse if you actually know how to run a small restaurant) My response was "we arrived way before it was packed." and what was his response you may ask: "MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T COME BACK HERE!" Thank you, Mario! Truer words have never been spoken! At this very moment in time the sad thing is Manhattan restaurants are going to continue to suffer, but an ungrateful prick (still didn't use a 4 letter word) like you is talking to customers in that manner when they are simply asking why their plain pizza hasn't arrived after an hour. Good luck to you in the future! An online endorsement can only go so far and I have held off mentioning out of loyalty for months now that all of our pickup orders (even being a block away and arriving early) have been ice cold when we get them.
2020-03-06,5,I've order a few pie's from Tenth Street, and I have to say that I haven't been disappointed. The sauce I have have to say is beyond delicious and I love the garlic and hot oil that comes with the pie.
2020-03-01,1,Not only did they get our order completely wrong when we picked up, they would not send the right pizza to us and we wound up spending $50 for 2 cold, no cheese plain pizzas that are usually $15 anywhere else in town. I have lived in Hoboken over 15 years and this was probably the worst pizza o have ever had. Go somewhere else especially since their customer service is not on par with other places in hoboken.
2020-03-01,1,First, we were looking forward to come here and try their supposedly excellent pizza. But looking back I wish we had checked their Yelp reviews first. If you check the recent ones, our experience below just runs in the category "Yet another one". Got here to order to go which takes about half an hour. While we were waiting, we were rudely approached by a gentlemen coming in and telling us to leave until we receive a text message. If we don't want to wait we could cancel our order. He double checked with us twice. He then explained that he is the owner and just got there. Very rude since we hadn't been told we couldn't wait inside before and would've been okay if he had been more polite about it. This put a bad taste to the otherwise  good pizza even though some of the edges were a little too charred for my liking.
2020-02-29,2,I've eaten at Tenth St. during its soft open, post opening, swore it off, and have recently decided for another take. Unfortunately, it's no different now from then. Slightly below medium -- the good is the clean modern rustic design, and that the pizza tastes like it's made of quality ingredients. In fact I enjoyed the taste of fragrant basil on their plain pie, but the big problem is that the pizzas are almost always burnt. There's a distinction between crisp and burnt, and burnt dough isn't as appealing. I question if I'd ever eat another pie, let alone wait through hordes that line their doors each Friday and Saturday. Really, don't let the crowd, or clueless pizza reviewers of the bar stool sitting variety fool you otherwise. There's other problems too. My experience ordering delivery took 110 minutes and yielded a overcooked and cold pie. The service is mostly slow and inattentive; chili flakes, napkins, and checks are frequently a hassle to ask for. Sometimes wait staff have their moods, and I feel a bit like walking on egg shells.
2020-02-29,1,Always enjoyed the pizza here.  HOWEVER, the owner Mario is definitely on drugs.  Always being rushed out of the restaurant.  This was a hidden gem when he first opened and obviously a quality product will gain increased notoriety, especially when the pizza king gives you an 8+ review.  Still doesn't excused the poor customer services and drug abuse.  With Mario in place I would make this a hard pass regardless of the quality of the pie.
2020-02-28,3,First time experience for my colleagues and I. We went in with high expectations and honestly are a bit disappointed. The price of the pies were expensive as expected after the review Barstool Sports gave it. There is a "bouncer" who stands at the door and takes his job way too serious for being a pizzeria. Two of the people in my group made it to the pizzeria before the rest and the bouncer made them wait outside in the cold before the rest of the group showed up. (It's 6:30pm on a Thursday and the restaurant might be half full.) The employees, specifically one young guy, was very rude. He threw the menus on the table and was trying to force our group to order more food than we wanted. Also, forgot to bring out one of our appetizers we ordered and charged us for waters. The pizza was good don't get me wrong but didn't live up to the hype. It's not a place I'm dying to get back to and honestly might never go back to. Overall not a great experience for us.
2020-02-23,4,Small place with limited seats.  Pizza takes about 30 minutes to come out.  No tap water or fountain soda which was surprising to me... I had to settle for a warm can of soda and a cup of ice.  However, the pizza is very good!  Crust is excellent and the pizza has equal parts cheese and sauce.  The grated Parmesan is a must!  I would prefer to order take out next time as the restaurant was nothing special.
2020-02-17,3,Pretty terrible service, the young male staff (zero females working there, prob why it lacks any attention to detail) is rude. Walked in on Super Bowl Sunday at 4pm and were laughed at by the owner Mario "we are backed up by 2 hours of deliveries", no one was in the restaurant - then put a sign on your door. Went again recently and was told to sit at the "table right there" so we went to the one with silverware and plates - "I said THIS table, that one is reserved" said the rude former bus boy from 10th and willow. Pizza is good but the management needs major work. Meatballs are dry.
2020-02-16,1,Over-hyped from Barstool. Also, their schedule is off, they don't open at 12:00 on weekends. Rude staff.
2020-02-08,1,Liked the pizza, the owner is a crazy person.  Don't go here. Berates his customers for innocent conversation.  They treat their customers like garbage.  Mario is on meth or coke.  Order takeout if anything.
2020-02-08,1,So, I love the pizza here. Think it's well done. However, the slack jawed man with the goofy scarf (who I believe to be the owner) is outrageously disrespectful. Just because Dave Portnoy gave you an 8.6 doesn't mean youre the king of the world, pal. I sat down with my family to eat, had already ordered, as my brother got up and spoke with another family with young children. This grumpy man with a silly scarf came storming up to him and told him "don't talk to my customers". And then CALLED THE COPS! Mind you, as soon as we walked in, he said we had a 45 minute limit to eat. Bro, just because your scarf is so outrageous, doesn't mean you have to follow suit. Your pizza is good, but you suck. Run a better business, man. ADDITION: the cops even EXCUSED us from any wrong doing! The owner with the goofy scarf was IN THE WRONG!
2020-02-06,3,As soon as I walked in with the boys , the owner of the place said guys we are closing in 45 minutes . I guess he was a little worried we were gona stay all night because he was stressing about the time we walked in . We ordered 2 regular pies and 1 grandma pie . Stoolepresidente rated this place an 8.6 and I'm honestly shocked he rated it that high. Usually his ratings are on point . The pizza literally had no taste to it , the flavor was very bland . Service was great , the owner was pretty friendly after we ordered. I wish I can give it a 5 star from the pictures it looked amazing , I was honestly shocked ... but then again maybe it was our unlucky day . Drove 1 hour to try it , I kind of want to give the place another shot but I really don't know if it's worth the drive anymore .
2020-01-30,5,Mario and Chris run this spot on the corner of 10th and Willow and prime location uptown and has been non stop ever since they opened and recently the CEO of barstool sports Dave Portnoy did a pizza review giving them a legit 8.6 and ever since he did the review, it's gone gangbusters so be advised that they do take pick ups but you have to call in advance and takes 20-30 depends on the volume but it's worth it! They do not sell slices and if you want you can go across the street at 10th and Willow bar grab a beverage and wait til the pizza is ready or go early like around 5/6 on a Mon-Wed. and you should be able to sit and grab a bite. They do take  credit cards and they open around 4-10 pm except the weekends  they open at noon. They have a restroom and there is street parking as well. Be patient, it's worth the wait!
2020-01-29,1,We ordered a large round pizza and long hots to go from here last week. The long hots were chopped up and oily AF. Tasted disgusting.It took around 20-25min until they called that it's done. We walked over to pick up. The man who greeted us was friendly at first. We asked if we could eat it there I instead and he told us to sit at a specific table/area even though they aren't busy at this time. He was very rude about it. We decided to go. We were turned off by the service. Also, I believe the pizza is WAY overpriced for what you get. We ordered pepperoni and mushroom on one side. There isn't many pepperoni and I even forgot we ordered mushrooms because there weren't enough. See photos yourself. It didn't even cover half the pie! They skimp on the fresh basil too and cheese! It was $27.72 for this burnt pizza! Not worth it. Too much hype for this place because of the "one bite" pizza guy who doesn't know pizza lol. The crust was thin and burnt. Not my style. This is a waste of calories. The sauce was average. I burped this most of the afternoon. Needless to say, I won't be ordering from here again.My favorite is still Tony Boloneys. I highly recommend you go there instead for amazing and delicious pizza. That's worth the calories! And the staff is always friendly.
2020-01-28,4,Located in Hoboken with tricky parking aka no parking but the pizza is the bomb! Cooked perfectly, we got half pepperoni and half classic. Our mouths were watering. The sauce was tangy and the crust was crispy. We got the round pizza but the thick square pizzas at the table over looked really good too, but at $30 for the square we weren't willing to blow that on pizza. We also got the ricotta crostini as an app which we really enjoyed, it's served cool FYI! Instead of crushed red pepper for the pizza they have what they call 10th st drizzle which is basically garlic, olive oil and crushed red pepper all marinated into yummy goodness that you spoon onto your pizza. Atmosphere is cute too, it was pretty crowded on a Monday night. Oh also, it's BYOB wish we knew!! They only have water bottles to drink, not tap water...... and canned or bottled sodas. So just bring booze! We are already planning our return!
2020-01-25,5,The secret is out, after Pres's 8.6 rating this place is the new go-to spot for pizza in Hoboken. I'm not sure, but I think they shut down delivery because they got so busy! Looking forward to eating here again soon.
2020-01-24,1,So we came here at 9pm, we were told there was a waiting list & gladly put our name on the list. Asked the person how long the wait would be, said "shouldn't be too long, people are starting to get up, it'll move". Ok cool no problem. They suggested we go across the street for a drink, im guessing same owners. An hour passes, no phone call. Walk back across the street, spoke to another gentleman who pretty much had a 'I don't give a fuck' attitude. Told him I've been waiting for an hour for a table & no call. He proceeded to advise me that they weren't taking anymore tables. I think my frustration at this point is justified that this location would be UNPROFESSIONAL enough to tell me "it is what it is" when told that they couldn't take the time to call us & say they aren't sitting anymore. My wife & I were starving, we drove  45 min from Westchester, completely discourteous & unprofessional. Anyone who goes, make sure you're guaranteed a seat & not some disgusting attitude from staff for wanting to be a customer.
2020-01-24,1,I really wanted to like this place. Came here twice. Unfortunately, the service is beyond lacking. One of the owners, Mario, makes you feel unwelcome, almost to the point as if you're bothering him by even being there and even talks down to customers. Even if you're jam packed, its easy to be professional and hospitable.
2020-01-21,5,Really. Really good pizza. A tremendous crisp and ingredients. Really enjoyed it and sad I was relyIng on a ton of other lame pizza placEs in the area before I found this. BYOB as well. Amazing job guys!
2020-01-19,2,I called Tenth Street on a Sunday at noon to order one square pie for pick-up, 25 minute wait.  I come in at 12:30, the pizza is not ready yet.  No problem.  One manager shortly says to "wait in the back by the door", so my sister and I do that.  I'm also mid-sentence saying something and he turns and walks away while I'm speaking...very rude.  While waiting at the door, another waiter in a top bun comes over and says "due to traffic in the restaurant (there were like half tables filled/half empty), we tell people waiting to wait across the street."  Meanwhile it is now 12:45 (45 mins after I first called and 20 mins behind schedule), luckily the first manager says "it's ok I said they can wait by the door".  Feeling very unwelcome/awkward at this point, we wait another 5 minutes for our square pie, they hand it to us, and we leave.We get home and open the pizza - I understand that their menu does say "all pizza well done" but this was BURNT.  The crust was black and hard as a rock.  Honestly just looked very unappetizing.I will say the inside portion that we managed to eat was very good.  The completely burnt crust and rude attitude of the staff definitely is a turnoff and would make me think twice about going back.
2020-01-18,5,Big score, big big score. 8.6 was well deserved by Prez from barstool sports. We just came for the plain large pie and it was great to me. Good crunch, good sauce and a good restaurant type pizza. Will go back for the square pie and other items on the menu.
2020-01-18,5,One of the most authentic italian spots in Hoboken. Cozy little spot & BYOB. So many great options to choose from on the menu. Recommend to friends and family regularly!
2020-01-17,5,Simply incredible! The place was packed, dude took my order, went across the street, had a couple pints, gave me a call, picked up. Botta bing. Botta boom. Fking pie was phenomenal! Round. Pepperoni. Mushroom. Never had better. Cheers!
2020-01-04,5,It's the best gourmet pizza in Hoboken and really should be kept in a different category for pizza. It's expensive, $30 for a square pie I believe, but it's unlike any other pizza in the city.I'd recommend one square pie per 3 people. Haven't had any of the round pies in my multiple visits but the squares have never disappointed.From what i hear the pasta dishes are alright/good but can neither confirm nor deny. Typically I'll go with a group, bring wine (it's BYOB which is amazing), and order a couple square pies.NOTE: ask for the garlic oil to add atop your pizza and gladly accept the fresh parm shred over the topSomething else I love about Tenth Street is how they'll call you when your food is ready for pickup. Very unusual but I'm a fan.
2020-01-01,5,Best pizza in Hoboken and possibly have ever had hands down. Need to eat it while it's hot though. Usually get the half hot peppers and half pepperoni.
2019-12-23,1,Service was dreadful.  We dined Sunday afternoon and the server could not have been less interested.  Never once did he ask if we needed something.  Rather, it was us always asking for what we needed.  He was staring at his cell phone the entire time.  My wife commented that maybe the guy's girlfriend broke up with him or something.  If not, he is in the wrong business, i.e., service.Food was fine.  Nothing great but not bad either.The service was terrible and we will not go back.  There are too many other Italian restaurants in Hoboken to give this place a mulligan.
2019-12-16,2,Really solid pizza, questionable business practices in my opinion. First off, big fan of the food. We're in there quite a bit when we're back in Hoboken, but now we're in the burbs. That said, my wife and I needed a $100.00 gift card for our daughter's teacher who lives in Hoboken and frequents this place. I'm still clueless as to why they can't issue a gift card. Do they know 30% of gift cards are lost or go unused meaning they still make the sale but might not have to even deliver on the product? We also got a run around too being told to call back and speak to the person that handles that. When we finally talked to Angel (nice chap, he was just following orders) we were told we could come in and eat but his boss says they wont mail us a gift card. I would have paid the 50 cents for the stamps, it's just that I'm 30 minutes out in Union County and I needed the gift certificate by Christmas. Whatever - just silly in my opinion to turn down $100 bucks. Must be awesome to be that rich. And if they don't do gift certificates at all, we could have all saved some time and they could have told me that in the beginning.
2019-12-01,2,While the service here was so nice and welcoming, I have to admit that both entrees that my boyfriend and I got were horrible. I got the Casio e Pepe (waiter recommended that I get the special with naked meatballs and toasted breadcrumbs so I did) and it barely had any cheese in the dish at all and was horribly seasoned with breadcrumbs and far too much pepper. My boyfriend got a dish with chicken, pasta, and broccoli rabe and it was horribly bland. Maybe we made the mistake of not getting pizza but we will definitely not be getting their entrees again!
2019-11-25,5,Best pizza in Hoboken period, nothing more to say.
2019-11-18,3,My first time here with a large group and we were seated right away which is always a plus especially since it took about 40 minutes to get a parking spot.  The place is really quaint, cozy and has an inviting feel which I love. We tried a lot of things on the menu my favorites were the meatballs, salad and the pizza was cooked perfectly I love a well done pie. Now the antipasto needs a little help the cheese served was the rine of the cheese which was not edible / the salami was slimy and they only give you three small pieces of bread with it. Also the service really lacks they plop a pile of plates on the table and plastic cups making me the waitress for the night filing waters and handing out plates and silverware. Show some TLC to your antipasto and the service and you have a little gold mine.  I would definitely go back hopefully as a guest only.
2019-11-18,5,The room was so nice and small. Was so comfortable an inviting. My serve was such a great guy! Angelo was so friendly and nice. I felt so at ease. The pizza was so good, I it was nice a crisp with unbelievable sauce i cant stop thinking about it. I wish I took a large pie to go so I could have more the next day. The naked meatballs were delicious. It's such a nice byob with great Italian food I will def be back and will be recommending to all my friends and family! I can't wait to go back and try the pasta!
2019-11-17,5,Totally a must try! Small cozy place thats perfect for a date night, birthday party or anything. I can't wait to go when the weather is warmer and sit outside. The food was fantastic as well. The pizza was in between of bar pizza and pizza parlor. Perfect crispiness and sauce was fantastic. We also had the naked meatballs and they were amazing appetizer. Definitely wanna try the pasta next time we go. Totally will go back soon!!!
2019-11-16,1,Went last night for the first time after reading the recent article in the star ledger about being the top 20 new pizzerias in NJ. We called earlier in the day to see if they take reservations and was politely told that they dont take reservations and was asked what time we were planning to come and was told that the wait at that time would be short usually 10-15 minutes... when we showed up the place was slammed and put our name on the list. After waiting close to 20 minutes and waiting outside in the cold, we were getting antsy and we checked back with the staff and was told that we had still more than an hour wait. So we decided to just place an order to go. We ordered the square pie, which the SL article indicated was a must try and the pizza was not only good, but prob one of the worst cooked pies I ever had. It was like an over cooked frozen Ellios pizza you buy in the supermarket. It tasted greasy and overcooked and was crunchy burnt ... I want to also mention that the pie cost 31 bucks and the 1 staff guy there who was waiting on tables with his tight muscle shirt and glasses was rude and not welcoming at all...  needless to say this place was a huge disappointment and you won't see us back there.  Plus my wife and I both felt like we had an instant stomachache and sadly ended up throwing away the majority of the pie...  -rude service, long wait, high prices and terrible pie all add up to never again !
2019-11-15,5,Best Italian food in the area. So good. I am dairy free and they go above and behind to ensure I can have something.
2019-10-21,1,I have been to Tenth Street Pasta & Pizza twice.  The first time, we sat at a table for two and was disappointed by the rudeness of the waitstaff.  When we asked what pizza's they had on the menu, he spoke no words and rather pointed to the sign and walked away.  Pizza was okay but pricey.The second time we went was this past weekend.  We had a group of 7, and walked in around 8pm.  When we asked for a table they told us 45 minutes inside, or we could sit outside.  As it was a nice night out we decided to sit outside.  When we asked if we could shift the two tables together to sit as one, the waiter rudely told us that he, nor us, would move the tables as it would be "blocking" the entry way.  It was not even close to blocking anything! He could not be more rude.  We decided to leave to eat at a place that would welcome us.This was twice the wait staff was nothing but rude.  I will not be returning. There are so many great places in Hoboken to eat, might as well eat somewhere they appreciate your business.
2019-10-20,4,Walked into 10th street pizza (no reservations) on a Thursday night around 8pm with a party of 4. We had no problem getting a table right away, but must have been a bit lucky since almost every other one was full! It's small and cozy on the inside and really great for a date, casual meetup, or to take parents. We split the square pie with half spicy sausage and half meatball as well as an antipasto plate and were VERY satisfied. We brought 3 slices of pizza home and couldn't polish of all the cheese on the antipasto plate. The antipasto plate had pecorino, burrata, salami, roasted peppers, and bread. Really delicious! The pizzas here are all well done - I enjoyed the charred taste, but I get it's not for everyone. Really loved the sweetness of the sauce too. Would definitely come back and try the chicken parm!
2019-09-12,1,Extremely poor delivery experience, Pizza arrived on time but it was not what we ordered. We ordered a large plain pie and it came as a margarita, which wouldn't have been a problem but the pizza was terribly burnt. I would say the pizza is practically inedible. We called the restaurant back to request what was ordered and they told us that a large pizza is the same as a margarita, and that all of the pizzas come burnt like that. You can see the picture for yourself. Please don't order from here.The cheese and sauce and everything on top of the pizza was actually really good, but it was ruined by overburned, charred, hard as a rock crust.
2019-09-05,5,I visited for a take out pizza last night for the first time. I'm right in the neighborhood so it's really convenient. They couldn't have been nicer and I got my pizza super fast. I ordered a Margherita pizza and an order of Meatballs. Both of these were really delicious. They also make their own dough which is a huge plus for me. The pizza was thin and crispy and absolutely perfect. They also included a really nice dipping sauce which had garlic and some other spices in it which was really nice as well. I also asked for a little extra basil on my pizza  and they even double checked to see if they had put enough on to my liking which I thought was very nice. The meatballs were cooked to Perfection and served in a red sauce which was delicious. I definitely plan to go back as a sit down guest to try the other specialties they have on their menu.
2019-08-31,5,Best pizza in Hoboken! Love the square pies and my Italian boyfriend agrees- he's very picky on good Italian! The ricotta crostini is probably our favorite thing on the menu. Could have that every night. Have been going since it first opened and always a quality option.
2019-08-23,5,Delicious pizza and pasta. We basically built our own pizza with suggestions from the server and it turned out amazing! Razza's got nothing on Tenth st.! This might easily be one of the best pizzas on this side of the Hudson. Everyone is super friendly and they make you feel like home. Definitely a neighborhood favorite!
2019-08-16,5,The sauce on the pizza was the best sauce I have ever tasted! The best pizza place in the area, hands down! There is not much on their menu, but less is always better! The meatballs and salad was also delicious! You won't be disappointed! The best part is seeing Albie Manzo! Sweetest guy ever!
2019-07-28,2,Pizza was average at best, the dough / crust was over cooked. I choose to pickup my overcooked $26 pizza to avoid the delivery fee... We might give them a second chance but Hoboken has so many pizza places that are WAY better they most likely lost by business. In conclusion Tenth Street was a let down and for the price an overall disappointment.
2019-07-27,4,Came here for the first time with friends who had been there once or twice before.  Friday night later dinner - inside and outdoor seating and they were about to sit us after a few minutes.  Server was very nice.  We brought two bottles of white wine which were opened right away but after a while had to ask that they be put on ice for us.  We ordered the Antipasto which was great and included fresh bread, delicious burrata, and homemade sweet peppers with other meat and cheese - came out quickly!  We tried their "square" pizza (it's rectangle) which looked to have a thicker crust than the round pies we saw coming out.  The flavors were great and it was served HOT (if a pizza can be too hot it may have been too hot...by the end of dinner it still hadn't cooled!).  To that point, and I think it's the style they're going for, but I think the crust was too well-done for my liking.  The edges actually had too much of a burned taste and the bottom just too crunchy (it does hold the toppings well though).  It should come with a small handled server (we just got forks, no knives) so you can cut/get the slices off the tray.  I'd like to try the round pizza another time.
2019-07-25,5,Had the chance to eat here while visiting Hoboken, NJ. The square pizza was great! The manager made a point to come out and make sure everything was good and see how we were doing as well.
2019-07-21,5,Consistently good...square pie is worth the splurge just get it with buffalo cheese!!!
2019-07-20,5,Way better than expected!! Will definitely go back. Pizza was out of this world, delicious!! Crispy, chewy, charcoaly crust. So good that we bought another one to bring home. Cacio de Pepe was just like Italy...I was scraping the plate, couldn't get enough. Sat at the counter, great service. The waiter that opened our wine was adorable, great personality and friendly. It was 95 degrees and restaurant was a little warm but these waiters worked there butts off, they didn't let it bother them. A must go to in Hoboken.Also, was so impressed with Chris Manzo, what a hard working kid... great work ethic. No silver spoon in his mouth. Can't say enough, loved it.
2019-06-24,5,Discovered my new favorite pizzeria in town! This place is a hidden gem located on tenth street, right by tenth and willow. 5 stars for the ambiance, hospitality and food. I recommend starting off with a cheese & meat plate followed by the meatball app server with fluffy ricotta. Also really recommend the tenth street pasta.. it was seasoned with bread crumbs and cooked to perfection. Out of the pizza choices, I highly recommend the square pie: the absolute perfected cheese to sauce ratio. Also, BYOB is always a win in this area :) will be coming back here for more Sunday eats :)
2019-06-22,3,Went here last night. Kind of a mixed reviews for us. The waiters were all very nice, and the pizza was pretty good. We liked the square pizza the best. Everything else was just ok. The service was not great. We had to repeatedly ask for things like ice, or water. I think they may just have needed to have one more waiter helping, everyone seemed really busy, so it wasn't like they were just standing around.  But they served water in disposable plastic cups, which I just find wasteful when you using the cups there.  It's BYOB which I love, but the service was just not good for the price. We were a party of 4, with 2 pizzas, and 2 apps and our bill came to about $100. Maybe it was just a fluke. May try it again sometime.
2019-06-19,3,Since we were staying practically next door to Tenth Street Pasta & Pizza it was a convenient place to stop for a quick lunch.I ordered their Italian sausage sandwich. The tasty sausage was nicely grilled, served on a crunchy Italian roll and appropriately dressed with a tangy tomato sauce and garnished with some parmigiana. I added a few shakes of red pepper flakes to kick it up a notch. The sandwich was quite large, more than I needed for lunch, so I took half home for breakfast the next morning.My wife ordered a small cheese pizza with anchovies which she reports was fine, though not outstanding.The restaurant has nice outdoor seating if the weather is cooperative. The service was perfunctory but satisfactory.The beverage selection was limited. I was hankering for a beer with my sandwich but when we were there they apparently did not have a liquor license. I stuck with water and my wife had a soft drink. With the type of food on the menu I would hope they are eventually able to serve beer and wine. If not I probably will try another place next time because there are many similar places within walking distance. (I'll update this review if I learn that this changes.)
2019-06-07,3,This used to be my husband's favorite pizza joint when we want to splurge a little. Lately we ran into a string of mishaps /disappointment. What is up with the slightly burnt / burnt pizza?! This pizza joint opened maybe a year ago. We were blown away by the pizza. Perfect crispy crust with delectable toppings. We always get the round pizza with sausage and peppers. It was so good that once my husband killed half a pie by himself. I ordered the square pizza once and the crust was so tough that I only ate one slice. I decided that round pizza was the way to go. In the last few months, the pizza crust have been burnt and super tough to eat. Currently there is half a pie sitting sadly in my fridge because it's just not good. For $30 a pie, I do expect quality or minimally edible pizza.
2019-05-27,2,Food was decent, but service is horrible. Our server didn't check on us one time during or even after our meal. He only came to give us our check and didn't even ask us how our meal was, or even offer more water for the table. I wouldn't go back.
2019-05-10,5,I love a good BYOB!!! So I went on a fluke because my friend wanted to try this place. It's very cute and small. We went in and got a table immediately. The service was awesome!! The two servers were so funny and personable. They made me feel like I was at their house and we were just hangin for dinner. The food was very very good. We got a meatball pie and the rigatoni bolognese. The pie was hot and fresh and absolutely delicious. The rigatoni was a little al dente but delicious and fresh none the less. I love the warm, romantic atmosphere and how comfortable I felt there. I love that it's cozy and a BYOB. I will definitely be back!
2019-05-07,5,Pictures does not do this pizza justice! Got the square pie with peppers, which are fresh and made on site, and pepperoni...amazing! Lots of flavor! Pizza was cooked perfectly, not burnt at all. BYOB, great wait staff and overall great environment! We loved it!
2019-05-04,5,Great atmosphere and a BYOB , staff is awesome.The square pie is easily one of the best pizzas I have ever had , we got the pepperoni with sweet and hot peppers (on par with rubirosa and joes pizza in NYC , high praise but it's the truth) This place is must try.
2019-04-10,1,Ordered a small margherita pie and got a sad slab of dough with mozzarella and grated cheese on top. No basil. Don't know how to make an item? Don't put it on your menu.
2019-03-31,5,We ate here last night for the first time and the food was absolutely incredible. We got prosciutto salad, burrata, margarita pizza, Caccio e Pepe, and chicken parm. Each thing was better than the last, can't wait to come back. The owner Chris couldn't have been nicer, sat down and talked to us for a little and made us feel very welcome. Ask for their chili oil. Also BYOB which is nice
2019-03-27,5,So good! We went with a group of 4 and got the square pizza with hot long peppers. So delicious and filling. 10/10 would go again. Also- it's BYOB!!
2019-03-21,4,This place was recommended by a friend as "the best pizza in Hoboken", the boyfriend and I decided to try it out after a hard morning workout on 2/24/19. We got the Margherita pizza and added in roasted peppers, mushrooms and prosciutto. The waiter was working alone during their busy lunch hour with a huge birthday party, he tried his best to be attentive but I would suggest the restaurant hire one more staff...also want to point out that most of the low Yelp ratings are for slow service! Huge plus for BYOB and the personalized pizza experience, will return for sure!
2019-03-19,1,I was staying in the Airbnb across the street from this neighborhood restaurant. I never had a $23 Meatball sub before so I was expecting to get something halfway decent. The roll was burned. Here is a tip to the owners. When you charge such high prices for a Meatball sub it would be nice if you put in a little effort. If you burn the roll, throw it out and toast another one.The Meatballs were actually tasteless. If I could give the meatballs a zero I would.I got two sodas to go and they gave me unrefrigerated  bottles that were sitting on a shelf. Really? Most people would have common sense to refrigerate sodas you are selling to customers for orders to go.This place is convenient if you live on Willow but I would not recommend eating there. Save your money and walk up to Washington.
2019-03-19,5,One of my go-to pizza spots in Hoboken. I've tried most of the pizza here, but I think the Margherita is hands down the best. That's definitely the one I'd highly recommend.
2019-03-15,1,Came here tonight, maybe the second or third time we've been here but tonight was just an embarrassing experience. As a business owner in town I can understand that when it's busy it can be overwhelming but the customer comes first always.   Pizza was good, service ok but we got our check without asking for it, as I was actually considering ordering another dish, but ok we paid. Still had some wine left and the place started to get busy. Well we were told to finish up our wine because "he had a wait". Not sure the name of the guy, had a pony tail tho, only one, maybe an owner. Anyway, he continued to make comments and also told my fiancée to leave because "he wasn't his type". All this while serving tables. Long story short, it was rude and un called for,racist for sure. Bottom line I don't recommend coming here. Napoli's is by the best place in town, service, quality and respect to the client.
2019-03-06,5,Best Italian food and pizza around by far. The reviews are true, self serve water is annoying and the glasses are tiny, the staff is very chill so on busy nights I can imagine it's a bit disorganized. The ingredients and recipes over shine all the little problems they have! Truly amazing place
2019-02-24,3,Pizza was average and the service was slow.  I would go back and give it a second shot. I just wasn't overly impressed.  Also thought it was weird no one brought us over water, but apparently you get it yourself?
2019-02-18,5,The appetizers and pizza are always delicious. You can really taste that everything is made to ordered,  served fresh and hot. I would recommend ordering the white pizza with ricotta, homemade pesto and artichokes + the square margarita pizza with pepperoni. My only call out would be the tomato salad or really any salad on the menu with red onion has too many thick pieces of red onion! Do not forget to ask for a side of their homemade spicy garlic and herb olive oil, it is the best! One of the best pizza places in Hoboken!
2019-02-15,2,I REALLY want to give this place a good review. BUT there are so many small problems - that even though the pizza is amazingly good (seriously some of the best ever) we don't make this place a regular stop, because the service is so lacking. We even live right across the street. Not sure if they are under staffed or what, but it takes a very long time for them to take your order, and then, both times we've gone, the appetizers come out after or at the same time as the food. Not the end of the world but annoying. It also seemed that people we were being very social and/or who knew the owner or staff got regularly checked on, & got their food way before us, despite us arriving a good 30 mins before them. Again, our missing appetizer with no update, meanwhile their full meals have come? Every customer needs to be treated the same. Both times we've gone we've been told there aren't enough water carafes. What? Self serve water is fine - but this seems like more of an upscale pizza joint, & to have to constantly get up to refill your own water, & awkwardly squeeze through & disturb your neighbors, it's really annoying. The water glasses are also extremely small so it doesn't take long to run out. Buy enough water carafes to have enough for every table, and a few extra for when they're being washed! Ridiculous! You can go to the dollar tree for god sakes and get some!!! THEN we were given plastic solo cups for our wine. This has happened twice! Again, go on amazon & get some wine glasses!!!!!  Also....come back to see what the order is promptly. Check in on the food. & while you're at a table, check in on the other table right next to you to see how things are & kill two birds with one stone. So many times the server would be right next to us talking to another table & we couldn't get their attention for something. Excellent food. Amazing, fresh, crispy pizza. The peppers are really something, the ricotta is so delicate & nomzzzz. But. The service, is so bad. They're very very very nice. I was a waitress for 4 years so I know it's tough. But they need to either staff more or re-train staff how to properly attend to guests.
2019-02-06,5,Literally the BEST pizza in Hoboken.  Crispy, thin, cheesy and amazing red sauce.  They also just added chicken parm to their menu... amazing! Best I've had! The staff is so nice and friendly.  Thank you for a wonderful meal.  We'll be back!!
2019-01-29,5,By far our favorite place in Hoboken for pizza, their pizza is top notch and we love the neighborhood feel every time we call or go in. Chris is a great guy and goes above and beyond to always make our dining experience a pleasure!
2019-01-19,3,Went on a Friday night with kids around 630 and place was pretty empty when we sat. Food was quite good....salad and 2 different types of pizza. But certainly didn't feel welcome with the kids. Servers were a little obnoxious all things considered. It's a pizza place after all, and they're serving us in red tee shirts. Chill everybody!
2019-01-10,5,From one Pizza owner to another excellent pie we had sausage and Pepperoni.   Meatball parmigiana was perfection great bread and better service.   A must try in Hoboken.
2019-01-09,5,the waiter here read my mind of what i wanted! I love that this place is byob and they use fresh and delicious ingredients. 100% recommend if you're looking for a low key night. Only change/recommendation I have is to have actual wine/champagne glasses to use!
2019-01-05,5,Updating my review. This is hands down the best pizza in Hoboken, and quite possibly, the best pizza I've ever had. Over the past few months, I've become obsessed! As an Italian, I am so picky with my pizza and this place knocks it out of the park.Whenever my roommates and I are looking to order pizza, this is our go-to. For dine in, it's just as amazing. Such a cute atmosphere and it's BYOB! They use the freshest ingredients and the pizza is thin and crispy - so delicious. The white pizza, plain pizza with sausage and square pizza are all my favorites.The owners are also so friendly and literally wave and recognize my roommates and I as we pass their restaurant. So family oriented - I'm so lucky to have this place right around the corner. Thank you Tenth Street!
2019-01-02,5,Really cute restaurant. Have been here a few times and always happy with the food & awesome service. We get the square pizza every time and it never disappoints. The ricotta crostini, tomato salad, and broccoli rabe are all very good.
2018-12-22,1,This review is for the service. Our family of four went in to celebrate a birthday. Out of 11 tables, 2 tables were occupied at the time, 6:30 pm. So when the server suggested a super tiny table for us and our two kids, we asked if we could join two single table to have a bit more space. Upon sitting, and receiving our water in (plastic) cups, the server came over and loudly and rudely told us " tonight is going to be crazy busy, so if a couple walks in we will have to move you" because we don't have enough tables for couples?!!! Are a couple more important than my kids? I've grown up in restaurant family and you never move a sitting customer, specially with two young kids. The servers answer was " I don't make the rules It's the owner"As it was a birthday and I didn't want to ruin the vibe, we stayed and had the dough, sauce and cheese, and tipped well too. Will never go back.
2018-12-14,5,Adorable BYOB place! The antipasto was delish!! We didn't stay for dinner because we didn't want to go and grab a bottle. I will definitely check them out again next time I'm in town. Their one bread dip is OFF THE CHARTS amazing!!!! Had just a right amount of kick!!! Service was great! I can't wait to come back for the pizza!!!
2018-12-07,1,Having tried most, if not all, pizza places in Hoboken, we were excited to try Tenth Street for their square pie. As loyal customers to Johnny Pepperoni, it was suggested we give this place a whirl. Huge mistake.We ordered a sausage and pepperoni square pie and received just plain cheese. When we called, the manager was rude and unhelpful. No apologies were given. The sauce was tasteless, the crust was hard and the plain pie was delivered cold.  For $34, you would expect a little more than that.  They probably think adding enough imported buffalo mozzarella will make people pay a premium price for subpar pizza. If you are looking for a tasty square pie, for a good price with great service, go to Johnny Pepperoni's. Save yourself the aggravation and disappointment.
2018-12-01,5,The food and overall experience was amazing. The pizza was delicious and the atmosphere was cozy and enjoyable. The appetizers of burrata and bruschetta were also delicious. Also, our waiter Chris was personable and made the experience that much better. 10/10- would highly recommend!
2018-11-09,5,Our fave pizza in Hoboken! The sharing app with burrata is a good size and good quality food. We got the classic pie and added half and half toppings, defs recommend the artichoke with the sausage. Perfect sharing size for two. Super friendly team working there, happy to advise on the menu and a really good atmosphere- BYOB always a winner too. 100% our new go-to local pizza place.
2018-11-04,5,I was pleasantly impressed by this new spot in Hoboken. The food was phenomenal, friendly service and good ambiance. Great spot for a first date or going out with a small group of friends.I'm surprised by the other reviews - the owner was actively helping out the servers, actually busting his ass. Very hard working and it showed. Congrats on your new spot! Happy to have this in mid/uptown Hob.
2018-11-04,1,Good food if you are actually eating in the restaurant. DO NOT GET TAKE OUT. Ordered a pizza, and they told us they would call us back when it was ready (happened about 45 minutes later) which is quite long for pizza when you go pick it up and no one is in the restaurant. Came home to find out that my pizza was completely black on the bottom and unable to even bite into. I call and explain that my pizza is black and get put on hold for about 2 minutes. After being on hold, a new man answers and I have to re-explain what happened they tell me they can deliver me a new pizza, nice. Not really when you have to wait 1 hour and 30 min + for delivery. Will never get take out from here again. Quite disappointed in the costumer service they offer.
2018-11-03,1,Nothing special, overpriced.  I went in when the place first opened.  The owners had some buds of theirs come in, and the owners proceeded to sit down and hang with them ignoring all the customers in the restaurant.  To top it off, they ran out of glass wine glasses and gave the last ones to the owners friends.  They sent a waiter out for plastic cups.I've since tried the pizza again via takeout.  The sauce is absolutely flavorless.  It's amay because the pizza looks picture-perfect, but has zero taste.  Pass on this one.
2018-10-16,2,Ok if you want a "really" expensive pizza this is the place for you. Unfortunately ours hardly had cheese or meat on it- just lots of sauce & oil. Definitely NOT worth the $50 we paid for it!!! Yes $50 for a pizza!! Unreal - save you money
2018-10-01,5,Delicious pizza, crunchy crust -- some of the best I've ever had. The garlic-chili oil was PHENOMENAL! I almost stole it!Chill vibe, beautiful section of Hoboken. I'll be back for sure.
2018-09-17,1,Without a doubt, the worst pizza I have ever had. So burnt, the box probably tasted better. Not to mention it was $36.50 and the box was only half full. Requested plates and, of course, the delivery guy forgot them. Gave the guy $40 and said keep it. He said he'd bring some plates back. Never saw him again. Call them up. They also said they'd send some plates down, nothing again. The person on the phone said that all their pizzas are well done and the square pies didn't fit their boxes well. Huh? That place is off my list permanently.
2018-09-14,1,This place stinks. Ordered an antipasto salad and plain pie and an hour and 20 minutes later we were still not served. I asked politely the status of our order and the owner/manager barked back in my face saying they were backed up and "it's coming." Horrendous service, will definitely not be returning.
2018-08-17,4,Amazing pizza (we got the round pie) and fresh tomato salad!! Staff was so friendly. It's BYO, which is a plus and makes it a very reasonably priced dining experience. I can't wait to go back for the square pie- another table got it and it looked amazing.
2018-07-06,3,Pizza just ok. Too much attitude.The first time we went for Sunday dinner. They didn't tell us it was pre fixe with no vegetarian options or ability to order from menu. Still the owner was super friendly and accommodating. We ordered a few times and pizza was pretty good. Crust is decent, sauce is good and cheese is fresh.Second time we went back on a Mon night with a party of three. Owner wasn't there and staff was very rude. Seated us at a 2 top even though every other table in the restaurant was open but for one l party of 2. The third seat at our table was literally in the middle of the bussing station. We asked a few times if we could move but were rudely told "no" each time. Then another party of 3 walked in and got seated at a 4 top. The waitress told us the owner told her that the first party of 3 had to be seated where we were sat and next party of 3 could be sat at a 4 top.We got up and moved all of our stuff to a 4 top. The entire restaurant continued to be empty other than three tables till we left.It was silly. Pizza is ok but not worth the attitude. We'll go to Johnny Pepperonis next time.
2018-07-04,1,We live on 10th street and were super excited about this place. The first time we ordered the square pie- meh. I thought maybe it was just a bad night/delivery. We hoped it'd be similar to Prince Street Pizza or L & B, not at all. The second time we went there to eat.... we were told to seat ourselves outside, fine. Then we were told to get our own napkins, silverware, and even water from this small service station. I've never really seen this in a restaurant before with servers? It was a confusing process and all of the tables around us were confused as well. This time we ordered the antipasto which was awesome (except they only gave you four small crostinis for a large plate of peppers and cheese). Then we ordered a large margarita pie.... literally the most awful pizza we've ever had. The dough was basically a cracker- so thin, dry and hard. The menu states that all pizzas are cooked well done- that to me sounds like they have no clue how to work their ovens and can't avoid burning/drying out the dough. And the sauce has zero flavor. I have no idea why anyone would ever return here. Stick to Grimaldi's for Hoboken pizza!
2018-06-28,1,Tonight we ordered a large square pizza for 32 dollars to go. When we got it home it was completely burnt. We called Tenth Street and the employee who answered was pretty rude. He stated that all of there pizzas are "well done". I agreed since we have eaten there once before. However, it's literally inedibly burnt. He took our name and number and said the manager may come tonight so he MAY give you a call. I said okay, but we still have a burnt pizza, what can we do? He said "there's nothing I can do about it" and then HUNG UP.
2018-06-26,3,It was the perfect summer evening for a pizza on the patio, but unfortunately the staff didn't allow for us to sit outside.  There's a hidden rule that you can't sit outside 45 minutes prior to closing.  Note, we arrived an hour before closing.  We were also told that we were going to need to leave by 10pm, before we sat down.  Pizza was good, but not worth the price.  Expensive, especially compared to the other great pizza spots in the neighborhood.  Overall, disappointed.
2018-06-24,4,Good quality pizza, nice thin crust, could be a little more crispier to my taste but I did have take out so I'll have to try this while dining in. But overall good pizza/Italian place to add to my list
2018-06-22,1,Verdict: best pizza in Hoboken is Grimaldis with Napolis a close second. Verdict 2: If you want to spend a lot on pizza go to Panello. Who are the people giving great reviews?  Maybe they didn't have the square pizza. This was SO disappointing!  Had heard so many good things. Service: minimal and not warm ("water is self serve in plastic cups over there")Food:  $40 pizza (!!!) was unbelievably lame. No flavor. Even toppings couldn't save it. Cannot believe it.
2018-05-23,5,I think we finally have a place that does unique, great pizza, something that's always been lacking in Hoboken. I mean hey, Napolis, Benny's, Johnny PepS and even Tony Bs are solid but if you live here, all those places ultimately leave you longing for some NYC pizza. 10th seems to have found something. It's a well done pizza, with good sauce that peeks through the cheese and oh the cheese.... I'm a sauce guy when it comes to pizza and 10th doesn't leave anything to be desired there, but the cheese... idk what they do but it's special. So much flavor. Like, i said, a unique, great pizza. Reasonably priced too. I'll agree the square is a bit pricey but it's good too and I'm thinking it's due to quality ingredients. When you try the cheese I think you'll agree. One last thing, it's far and away the best pizza I've had after a night in the fridge. I think that says something. Bravo! Bring on the pasta.
2018-05-18,5,I originally gave 10th Street 1 Star - the service and delivery left very little to be desired. I take it all back. It seems the kinks were worked out and Tenth Street has proven consistency over the last few months with delivery times, service and quality of pizza. Best in Hoboken. humble pie for 1? Yes please.
2018-05-12,4,Round 2! This time we got the square pie with mushrooms & onions. 4/5 - it took about 25-30min to get the pie which felt like forever but it was seriously delicious! Although 30$ seems high it's worth it! They also had a pitcher of citrus/regular water that customers need to refill their own glasses with. I found this odd but the citrus water was refreshing! We will be back!
2018-05-06,3,I really wanted to love this place but not a comfortable experience. With that being said the white pizza was delicious and the crust was perfect!! I say pick up or delivery with these prices the service needs to be better!!
2018-04-14,5,I can't vouch for delivery but eating at this pizzeria is nice and the pizza was very very good.
2018-04-11,4,Had been meaning to try this place for a while, and happy my roommates and I finally made it. We ordered a square plain pizza as well as a white pizza, and both were amazing! The space is also really inviting and nicely decorated. One thing to keep in mind, there's no menu to look at, as they offer three appetizers and pizza with an array of toppings. The water is also self serve. Definitely do recommend if you're looking for great pizza.
2018-04-05,5,Great pizza , I always say keep it simple ... they are the best , take the starter , the Burata is sooo good ... love this place love the Staff there , we come again thx for alllll
2018-03-29,4,Pasta? Likely never as a regular menu item I guess, but the pizza is undeniably excellent. Love the homemade hot pepper relish and the garlic oil.
2018-03-28,4,Ive been waiting to try this place since they started building over the summer. We were a large party but the owner Mario was kind enough to accommodate. The menu is very limited- salads, antipasto plate, burrata, ricotta toast and pizza. You can pick from a square or round pizza. We tried the square. It was crispy on the bottom and chewy on top. We also tried one of each of the appetizers. Everting was fresh and a good sized portion. They are byob and small so make sure to come early!
2018-03-27,5,Have lived in town for over 7 years and this is the best pizza in Hoboken, worth every penny
2018-03-24,1,My GF and I have been there 3 times; never seated.  First time we stood there for 20 mins (930 sat night)  and only Chris acknowledged us (nice guy) and the older meat head that either manages or owns it walked passed us at least 4 times and never acknowledged us; totalJerkoff.  Second time we went they said it would over an hour wait; no thanks.  Thinking the third time would be a charm, we sat ourselves and Chris came up to us to tell us and said "we ran out of dough". I asked him to repeat it because I didn't believe it myself.  Ran out of dough???? What's next, Taco Bell is going to run out of tacos?   This place is run by incompetent Jerkoffs.  And btw no one takes a date out to sit at their "bar" to eat pizza so stop pushing that on people.  Go to Margeritas instead!
2018-03-24,4,Ordered large half plain half pepperoni pie. Wife & I really enjoyed the pizza. Sauce was good, fresh basil & Parmesan was nice touch. The garlic chili oil is pretty darn tasty! Definitely will order again!
2018-03-23,5,This place is amazing and our new go-to pizza spot in Hoboken. Great ambiance. Don't wait to try this place.
2018-03-13,5,That was some of the best pizza I have ever had!!! By far the best pizza in Hoboken. I love that there is no menu. The owner is super super nice.  The salads, mozzarella, sausage and peppers on the pizza (which usually isn't my thing), were some of my favorites. I almost don't want to leave a really good review because I'm afraid everyone will go here and I won't be able to get a seat.... just kidding. But seriously, my husband and I always talk about their pizza, and people say to us, "do you own that place?"  Hahaha. Do yourself a favor and eat here!
2018-03-10,5,We order delivery from here quite often, because it's simply the one of best pies in Hoboken.  The ingredients are fresh, seriously delicious, and high-quality. We also love the antipasto with Burrata, chunks of Parmesan, homemade roasted peppers and sopressat. I can't wait for their pasta. I'm sure it's going to be amazing.
2018-03-06,5,Sunday Dinner is a must and a welcome new tradition in Hoboken!! The pizza is great (especially with the fresh ingredients, homemade peppers, and burrata), but the real highlight is their Sunday Dinner Seatings. They do a few times each Sunday, the multi-course menu changes each week, and ranges across all your Italian-grandmother-favorites (manicotti, Sunday gravy, etc.) Everything we were served was fantastic, and Chris and Mario make the whole experience top notch. :)Favorite new place in Hoboken!
2018-03-02,4,So I've walked by this place so many times since it opened. I was excited to see what the fuss was all about as I've been a loyalist to Johnny Pepperoni. But this was a delight... on this wintry mix of a night I decided to bite the bullet and cheat on JP. Boy was this affair worth it (no one should cheat but when you do it with a better pizza, it's ok).  I was pleasantly surprised in the price and size of the small... It was the best 12 inches that have ever entered my mouth. The sauce, great... the cheese, great...the crunch of the crust, crunchy delight. I totally recommend this place when jonesing for that triangular hot treat. I did a simple pick up and stuff my shameless face at home but I think I would like to go back and try something table-side next. Welcome to the neighborhood.I will say Chris Manzo seemed a little short and just ready to have me be out of his sight... all I asked was if the place was BYOB and he answered with a simple short yes. Nothing more nothing less. Guess he didn't care to have my continued business.
2018-02-26,5,Some of the best pizza I've had and great ambiance with no tvs and nice setting. BYOB and they are very helpful by even keeping the beverages cold in the fridge. No menu in the me physical sense, but creates more of a bespoke experience. The pizza is pricey, but this should be expected as you can taste the freshness and quality ingredients. The sides were great and it is a nice spot for a relaxing, but still "going out" style dinner. Can't wait to try the Sunday dinner.
2018-02-24,2,My first experience with Tenth Street was positive during their soft opening back in October 2017.  They were offering a limited menu at the time (only pizza and calzones).  The pizza we had was fresh and delicious; the service was great as well, but then again we were one of the two parties dining there.My most recent experience was a complete 180 from the one I remembered a few months ago.  I recently placed a pick-up order for a large pepperoni pizza.  I was told it would take approximately 25 min and would receive a phone call when my order was ready.  After waiting almost an hour, I decided to follow-up with them.  When I arrived, the staff seemed disorganized and confused.  I did not receive any apology or explanation, but I was clearly annoyed that it took almost an hour to get a simple pepperoni pie.  When I finally got my order, the pizza was burnt and stale.After this experience, I will not be returning.  Save yourself the trouble and try the other dozens of pizzerias in Hoboken.
2018-02-21,1,Went in to order a pepperoni pizza for take out on a game day Sunday a few months back.  The place was empty.  It came out really fast, which at first was impressive(but read on).  The apartment was close so I got back fast.  Everyone grabbed a slice and then it became apparent to all they had given me a plain pizza which was sitting around for a while that they put pepperoni and a little more cheese on it and stuck it back in the oven.  With as many good pizza choices in town this is one strike and your out.
2018-02-18,2,The service here is horrendous and the manager is extremely rude. The pizza is ok, above average, but is way overpriced - $30 for a square pie that feeds two.Spend your precious weekend dinners elsewhere, trust me.
2018-02-17,5,Pizza was absolutely perfect and delicious - all of the ingredients you could tell are fresh. Very cute small space and great that it's a BYOB. The appetizer and salad we had were both excellent as well. They don't have a full menu and not sure if they plan to, but regardless love i and can't wait to go back. Really cannot say enough good things!
2018-02-11,4,Great new addition to Hoboken - adds something different than your usual pizzeria with their square pies. Don't expect to come here and order a slice and walk right out - people complaining about wait time are walking in with incorrect expectations. The pies are definitely worth the wait. We ordered one with sausage and soppressata and drizzled their house-made oil on top. Perfect balance of salt, heat, cheese, and crunch in each bite. The reason this isn't 5 stars is because although It was delicious it's not your everyday pie (It doesn't come cheap). Maybe another visit and a few more topping combinations and I'll justify the cost more often.
2018-02-09,1,Note: this review is based off wait time and customer service.My boyfriend and I waited nearly an hour for our half mushroom and half pepperoni Sicilian pizza to come out of the oven. As the daughter of a former Italian restaurant owner, I can tell you with 100% certainty that a Sicilian pie takes 30 minutes MAX to cook. Not only did the pizza take an hour, the pizza order was incorrect -- both toppings were on one side of the pie and the other side was plain. When brought to the owner's attention (not the Bravo-lebrity), he shrugged it off and moved on to the next annoyed customer.Bottom line: Staff seem unorganized, frazzled, and downright incapable of handling the amount of food being ordered or the number of customers. Try one of million other pizzerias in Hoboken. You'll save yourself the aggravation.
2018-02-09,1,There are too many places in Hoboken to order pizza to accept bad service and pizza. The first time we ordered take out and picked it up ourselves it was fantastic. The second time we ordered delivery. Not only was the pizza burnt to a crisp the driver dropped the pizza and flipped the box. Absolutely no apology or refund was offered. Tonight I called and was going to pick it up myself. The rude girl asked me to repeat every single thing I said and then when she finally had my order refused to tell me how long until I could come pick up my order. I was told very rudely  "we'll call you when it is ready." The best she could do was "at least 30 minutes." I am done. I'll stick with Rosarios down the street where they know my voice, order and phone number as soon as they answer. That is appreciation for business and knowing your customers.
2018-02-04,1,Felt so compelled to write about and send caution to fellow Hoboken residents that this is actually my first yelp review - sadly it is not positive. Experienced an incredibly disappointing evening at Tenth Street last night - my fiancé and I were treated with tremendous disrespect and lack of hospitality from the manager/owner (?). Barely had finished our meal and we were abruptly and seriously harassed to get up and leave restaurant to turn tables as quickly as possible - three separate times in a span of three minutes. Have to say that I'm sad as I've visited his venue often and frequently do order from them - but I won't be returning and have spread the word to friends in neighborhood.
2018-02-03,1,The first time I ate there, I sat at the counter and was ignored for a good 7 minutes until someone decided to ask what we would like. We asked a couple questions, went with the waiters suggestion. A few minutes went by and he asked if we were ready to order - which we thought we already did. He continued to ask if if it was for here or to go. Rolled his eyes when we said we were eating there. I actually asked him "is that okay with you". I just ordered a pizza to my friends apartment with a bottle of water. They never charged my card, then charged my friend and never brought the water either. I had to call and switch the charge and on top of it - whoever picked up admitted that they knew they messed up but never called me back to charge me. It's pizza - it's not hard- worst customer experience. There's much better places to order from so don't waste your time and by the way was not amazed either - you want sick pizza go to Razza in jersey city
2018-01-27,4,This is the culmination of two visits. First went here when it was still on its soft open. They served sandwiches and slices and wouldn't say they set themselves apart from the many Hoboken pizza places. But the place is up and running now and the pizza is delicious. The square buffala pie is a signature dish. Get whatever topping you like. Went with mushrooms and their homemade peppers. The key is to get the homemade spicy olive oil on the side. Drizzle it over the slices generously. Takes the pizza from a good to great square slice. Haven't had the regular pie since the first visit, when it was ordinary.
2018-01-24,5,LOVE THIS PLACE!! The restaurant is small but very welcoming and comfortable. The pizza is AMAZING. It is served piping hot with a side of garlic/red pepper olive oil to drizzle on top. They are still working on the menu, but everything they have thus far is delicious! Go for the square pie with bufala mozzarella.
2018-01-22,5,After my disappointing experience, Tenth Street responded to my review in an attempt to fix the situation. DeAnna was wonderful and recommended a square pie, half sausage and peppers and half plain. She said it would arrive to my apartment in 45 minutes -- it came probably in 30 minutes! Pizza was absolutely delicious, and I can see why they say that the square pie is their best seller. Really appreciate Tenth Street for reaching out!
2018-01-20,1,Ordered take out. Came quickly but toppings very sparse for the price. Didn't taste great either.
2018-01-20,2,We had a terrible experience here. After waiting over an hour for a table (which we were totally understanding about as it is a very small restaurant) the three of us were seated at a table that was clearly only meant for two. We ordered appetizers which were good but not amazing. We then had to wait for one of the owners to come over so we could let him know we hadn't ordered pizza yet (to which he replied, "really?"). After ordering we waited another good hour or so as everyone around us had gotten their food and tables were turning over. After complaining to one of the waiters that they had clearly forgotten our food he didn't apologize and kept insisting it was coming (which was exactly what he had said twenty minutes prior). The pizza came and was cold and just ok. They never offered an apology or took anything off the bill. We were completely shocked as this place had gotten great reviews. We won't be returning.
2018-01-18,2,Some things done right, but the biscotti-like crust is holding this pizza back.
2018-01-17,5,Easiest 5 stars I've ever given. Hands down best pizza in Hoboken by far! Square pie with buffalo mozz and sausage is to die for! I also recently tried their Sunday night dinner and everything was so fresh, authentic, and delicious, not to mention a massive amount of food. Highly recommended !
2018-01-16,5,The best pizza I've had in Hoboken!Great service, relaxing atmosphere, byobHighly recommend their home made peppers
2018-01-12,5,Awesome pizza! The best in Hoboken. My kids even said "yum, this is awesome" after the 1st bite and they've had my mother's homemade pizza many times. You can taste all the high quality ingredients and homemade recipe. We had the plain pizza and will be sure to go back for the square pie (their speciality). Our pizza had a wonderful crisp, thin crust, fresh parmesan and basil. Also loved the garlic/oil/pepper dressing that came with it!!! This is going to be our standard italian place.Can't wait to taste more off the menu.
2018-01-11,5,My wife and I were headed over to Hoboken for the afternoon.  We were craving a good pie so I searched/reviewed on Yelp and Tenth Street Pizza, although there were only 11, had the best reviews of the bunch.  It's not located on the main drag (Washington St.), but a few blocks away, which is nice.  We arrived just after 4 pm and were the first customers of the day.  We were promptly greeted by Chris(one of three owners) and we selected our table next to the window.  Chris went over the menu items and he asked if he could put our beer in the fridge for the time being, as we hadbrought our own.  I had read it was byob so we made a stop at the local craft beer shop nearby.  Tenth Street serves two types of pizza, a New York style round with thin crust or a square pizza that has a bit of a thicker crust. We opted for the square with half pepperoni and the other half with peppers, pepperoni and sausage.  It took about 20 mins for our pizza to be ready as everything is made from scratch.  It was well worth it!!  During our wait we talked with owners Chris, Mario and Urbano about their new restaurant.  It's only been there less than 3 mos.  Our pizza arrived and it looked great and tasted even better.  They also serve a side of their signature oil to drizzle over your pizza if you so desire.  It is good so I'd recommend trying a bit on your pizza.  My wife and I must have stayed there 2 hours during which time local first timers came in and raved about how good the pizza tasted.  Thx to Chris, Mario and Urbano for the great hospitality and for serving up some amazing pizza.  We didn't want to leave, but we will definitely stop in on our next trip to Hoboken.  Tips: **They do accept credit cards unlike some spots that are cash only. **BYOB - which we kinda like as we are really into craft beer. **Come hungry.  Even the small pizza is fairly large.
2018-01-08,3,The pizza was a bit overpriced for what I've seen in Hoboken ($30 for their square pie and no toppings). Also, we had only 3 choices for an appetizer and only two choices for pizza. This would be fine for a casual bite but there are better pizza places around (ex. Johnny pepperoni and Grimaldi's). Would eat again as takeout but would not sit down as service took a very long time.
2018-01-01,4,Ordered on New Year's Eve and was very happy. The pizza was delivered on time. The person I spoke to on the phone was very friendly and helpful in describing their square and circle pizzas. We ended up ordering hot pepper and sausage on a large round pizza. It was great and we'll be ordering again. I'm not yet sure it's the best in Hoboken yet - I still love me some Dozzinos and certain pies from Tony Baloneys but this is better than Napoli's and Grimaldi's in my view. One thing I would like to see is some creativity in pizza delivery packaging. The standard box and warmer are fine but they don't keep the pizza hot enough. Dominos has a pretty good system and I believe their boxes are somehow insulated but would be nice to figure out a way to keep delivery food hotter given how popular delivery is these days. Anyway - I'm on a soap box and it's not just for this place to resolve. End conclusion - this is very good pizza.
2017-12-21,5,Amazing new BYO Pizza spot in Hoboken! The square pie was incredible, and it comes with a side of spicy, garlicky, delicious sauce to spread all over it. Great music, cute ambiance make for a nice easy causal date night spot, or good for a low key dinner with a larger group of friends. Service was great and you can tell the staff is super passionate about the food and the experience. 10/10 will be back again soon!
2017-12-07,5,Finally, the perfect pie in Hoboken! And we are lucky enough to live a block away. The boys from 10th and Willow have opened a little pizza joint across the street and it is amaze-balls. They are using their grandmothers recipes (they say they ate this pizza all the time growing up) and the history shows. It has only been open a short time, a sort of soft open, so the menu is limited, they will be adding more later, but what they have is incredible. We had the square pie and loved it. The dough and sauce compliment each other perfectly. The toppings were fresh, generous, and authentic. A nice greek salad was the perfect addition. The service is prompt and friendly. It is BYOB, which is another strong plus. I can't recommend it enough and will regret it when it becomes so popular I can't push my way through the door.
2017-12-05,5,Best NY style pizza I ever had!  Mario is an amazing host/owner.  Great to meet someone so passionate and caring about their food and your dining experience.  Incredible crust, large pies, great service and an amazing selection of gourmet toppings.  Love this place.  Will look forward to the next visit!
2017-12-02,5,Amazing new restaurant and hands down the best pizza in Hoboken! The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. My new favorite BYOB!
2017-11-30,5,This place is amazing. The pizza is by far the best in Hoboken. We ordered a pie with sopressata and it was fantastic. The cheese, dough, and spices were fresh and cooked perfectly. It was served with a homemade garlic olive oil that complimented the pie really nicely. The owner, Mario, was wonderfully attentive and funny. I am very much looking forward to making this my new pizza staple---it is a must try!
2017-11-18,5,Pizza is amazing.  Some of the best in THE best pizza town in America.  Mario and his team do an excellent job.  Square pie with bufala is a must.  Throw some housemade peppers on there for some real salivation.
2017-11-18,5,Pizza was on point. Crispy and the tomato sauce was homemade and to die for. Had the traditional but going to try the square pie next time.This place is for real and it's here to stay. Had plenty of seating inside and was extra clean
2017-11-14,5,This was awesome! Same owners as 10th and Willow. Pizza is delicious ! Cozy BYOB will definitely be back! Can't wait to try their pasta menu! We had the regular pie and the square pie! Square pie was my favorite! It was crispy and delicious. Highly recommend this establishment!
2017-11-13,5,The last thing Hoboken needs is another pizzeria but this is one of the best! The owner Mario was our server and he is not only friendly and knowledgeable but took amazing care of us and all other tables that came in. We got the square pie with half pepperoni and arugula and half plain. The tomato sauce was incredibly fresh tasting, parm shaved on top table side and garlic chili oil to put on top. Seriously amazing pizza unlike any other in Hoboken. Byob and cash only.
2017-10-30,5,Beautiful new restaurant popped up on one of the corners of 10th Street and Willow Avenue. A cute chalkboard sign out front announces they're open for business (no "official" sign on the building, yet). Cozy decor and ambiance inside. What really pulled us in was the scent of pizza baking in their oven.The waiter told us they opened a few weeks ago and are slowly testing and adding to their menu. For now, they have pizzas in 2 sizes, and slices (until 3 am on Fridays and Saturdays). This place is BYOB.Breaking News: this is now Hoboken's best pizza. The crust is thin, crispy and divine (I usually leave the edges uneaten -- not these). They get the Margherita right: cheese is excellent and in the right quantity. No extra grease anywhere. All of the toppings (we chose Margherita base plus pepperoni, mushrooms, hot peppers) were of the highest quality. (Mushrooms, however, can be of a more interesting variety). So delicious, I accidentally ate half of a large pie by myself. I'm not even embarrassed. This place just opened, and there is already a lot to love. 5/5 stars, 10/5 stars for their pizza.
