2021-10-05,4,Tried for the first time. portions are decent. Spicy noodles with tofu was good overall and really spicy. Something diff was the silken tofu usually thai restaurants use fried firm tofu because silken tofu is not to be used with any noodles. thats why one star less. Stir fried veggies in garlic sauce was very good I really loved it! The food was good hot when came home so didn't need to heat up.
2021-09-30,4,Tried T Thai for the first time over the weekend and I'm impressed! Love me some filling, affordable Thai food. Our order was delivered before our estimated delivery time, too. - Steamed Thai dumplings: Four dumplings per order, good appetizer size. Steamed perfectly and packed with chicken and veggies! - Chicken pad Thai: I order Pad Thai pretty often and have to say this was an especially flavorful dish. I really hate bland pad thai or one that's heavier on the noodles vs. the chicken and veggies, so this was perfect. I had leftovers for the next day too! - Chicken fried rice: This was the only item that I wasn't crazy about. There were chunks of mushed tomato in the dish, which isn't typical of the fried rice dishes I usually order. My husband liked it, however, so maybe just a personal preference. - Beef with rice noodles and broccoli: My husband ordered this as his main dish and said the beef was perfectly tender and that the sauce was savory without overpowering the dish. I snuck a few bites and may have to order this as my main dish next time!
2021-07-10,4,I like this place mainly because they have lunch special 7 days/week until 4 pm. An entrée costs $9-10 and you'll get a spring roll and a salad. The food tastes great too. If you are there for lunch, either dine-in or take-out, make sure you ask for their lunch special menu. Or they might charge you dinner price instead, which is a lot more expensive and it doesn't come with any appetizers.
2021-06-28,5,I ordered from T Thai today for the first time on DoorDash and I loved it!! The wait time said about 40-50 minutes but it was at my doorstep in 20, which was amazing. Needless to say this place offers fast and efficient service. Here's what I ordered:- Spicy noodle with tofu: 10/10 SO GOOD. It came with a lot of veggies (broccoli, bell peppers, eggplant, carrot, zucchini, etc.) & it's not fried tofu, more like the soft silky kind, which worked really well with the dish. The noodles were so flavorful and delicious. They were spicy, so they definitely live up to the title, but not overwhelmingly. I've previously been to thai restaurants where the food is SO spicy you can't even eat it or enjoy it so I was pleasantly surprised with the balanced spice level of this dish. Also for $13, this dish was HUGE (I can make two meals out of it easily). It was also piping hot and fresh when delivered. Definitely do not miss out on this if you order from here.- Mango salad: 8/10 really good! The mango was fresh, perfect level of ripeness (not too sour or too sweet). It was basically strips of mango, lettuce, tomato, cilantro and onion with some dressing. The dressing was too sweet for my taste, the salad was better with out it. Overall, I'd get it again with the spicy noodles as it offset the spice really well and created a very balanced flavor pallet. Again, for $6, the portion size was huge, I was able to eat it twice. - Fried roll: 9/10! You get 3 rolls and they're just what you would expect, a crispy, flakey spring roll with a warm veggie filling (it tasted like cabbage and carrot to me). The price is $4, and I think it's worth it as a good side dish!All in all, high quality and fresh ingredients were used and the food was delightful. I'll be ordering from here again, for sure!
2021-06-23,5,The only thing I'm disappointed about is that I haven't been here before! This food was absolutely incredible and the service was top notch. Adorable hard workers. Come here 10 times out of 10. The food has plenty of flavor, perfect amount of spice, and sweetness. Will be back!!!
2021-05-20,3,Ok.  Good but not memorable or anything that stands out versus any other Thai restaurant in this city or anywhere. Go without worry. Food will be good. Don't expect anything special.
2021-03-20,2,I recently ordered from seamless.The good:Portions were decent.The so-so:Pad thai tasted okay but they noodles were overcooked and they were cheap with the chicken.The bad:Pineapple fried rice tasted like pinesol.Steamed dumplings were off.The final verdict: Not ordering again
2021-03-17,5,I order from this place all the time. The tom yum soup is so good and a great portion size for the price. I can always count on a fast delivery time as well.
2021-01-28,3,Ordered from this restaurant from one of our common use apps. I can say that the delivery was pretty swift. Now for the food. Ordered chicken pad tai, rice noodles with chicken and two orders of wings. The noodles for both dishes were ok, but could use some more flavor. Lime juice was slightly overwhelming the pad tai. The wings themselves can use some more flavor for itself, but I do give a thumbs up for the chili sauce for adding needed flavor and my favorite, some heat. I expected somewhat better, but I'm always one to give a second chance to a restaurant and if it's better the next time around, I always update my review with the next experience. Will try again in the future.
2021-01-25,5,Tempers will flare when there's a close election like T Thai's list of popular items. As of press time, green curry has 19 reviews, with red curry at 18 and tom yum soup 17. But many voters can agree that Pad Thai's tally of only 4 is a pleasant alternative to listings where that safe bet crowds out more exotic choices.No, I'm not an objective journalist, I'm a green curry partisan after tonight. This is not entry-level spice. It's on the high side of medium, but not without hints of coconut sweetness. The curry puffs are enjoyable too, albeit with a more centrist vibe.No doubt I'll be back to try the other curries. Uber Eats pickup was quick and easy.
2021-01-25,4,I'm not yet well versed in the world of Thai food, but T Thai is my favorite that Hoboken has to offer. I've had it a few times now, and the Spicy Noodles and Pad Thai are both delicious options.Most recently I had the Duck Pad Thai. The duck was tender and flavorful. Well worth the $3 extra. The pad Thai was rich and savory. I also loved the house salad and peanut dressing. And no Thai food order is complete without spring rolls.
2021-01-19,5,I love this Thai place- a few minutes further to get to than other Thai restaurants but it's worth it. The pad Thai is very tasty and the potions are large, and I would also highly recommend the green curry. It's spicy, so you'd have to have a tolerance for spice but the rice helps to balance it out. The Thai iced tea is also a great way to balance the heat.
2020-12-15,1,Disappointed to be writing this review because their food is genuinely great. However, my most recent experience with their customer service cannot be ignored. I ordered their pineapple fried rice for the first time. I have a severe cashew allergy, but noticed that all of the menu items that do use nuts (e.g., Pad Thai, Cashew Chicken) have allergen warnings or declare it in the ingredients. I didn't see anything on the pineapple fried rice and safely assumed there were no cashews used. I received it with cashews and immediately called the restaurant. The response from T Thai was unacceptable: they blamed me for not assuming that they used cashews (even though I have had it at establishments that either don't use them or declare that they do). I asserted that they need to disclose this because they could quite literally kill someone. They confessed that they have had many complaints about this *exact issue* (cashews in their pineapple fried rice) but still have not revised the menu item to show use of cashews. Long-story short, be skeptical of their menu item descriptions. If you have any food allergy - declare it to them, because you cannot assume that T Thai will look out for their customers.
2020-11-10,4,Drunken noodles and spicy fried rice were incredible! Also enjoyed the chicken satay and dumplings. The Pad Thai was very mediocre and noodles lacked taste. Pickup order was quick and easy. Even gave us extra spicy red chilli sauce.
2020-10-31,5,I ordered this from Uber Eats but I will definitely order directly from them next time. The packaging was neat and secure. I ordered Massaman Curry with Shrimp, Veggie Spring Rolls and Tom Kha Soup. All of it was delicious!! The order of spring rolls comes with only 3 but,  the dipping sauce is surprisingly good.  This will mostly likely become my go-to Thai place!
2020-10-01,1,Super disappointed! We were craving Thai food and saw this place had some decent reviews, so we ordered for delivery: Chicken fried rice, Chicken Pad Thai, and Tom Yum soup. The Tom yum soup was very watery-not much body to the soup. It only had 1 piece of shrimp in it! We added hot sauce and soy sauce to it, so it wasnt so bland.The chicken fried rice was also super bland as well, and I was disappointed that it only had a few tiny pieces of chicken in it. The rice was sticky/greasy, and they put way too many eggs in the dish. The dish also had a sweet taste to it which I didnt like, as I prefer a more spicy/garlic taste to it. My fiance had the chicken pad thai. Again, it only had a few tiny pieces of chicken in it, and was also bland. We threw most of it out! Wont be ordering from here again.
2020-09-23,1,Except for Tom Kha soup, thefood was really bad. Papaya salad was very sour, perhaps they squeezed lemon twice or thrice. Green curry was so watery and tasteless.
2020-09-19,1,This is not a vegetarian friendly restaurant.  I ended up having to throw away my entire order because I wasn't made aware that everything, including vegetarian items, contains fish and/or oyster sauce.  Even the veggie fried rice is not suitable for vegetarians!  They're going to end up putting someone into anaphylactic shock.
2020-09-04,3,Delivery was really fast and shrimp read curry was good. Tofu green curry was tasteless though , almost fist size tofu chunks were thrown into the curry and they were not cooked at all. For faster delivery, the quality of food was below average.
2020-08-20,3,Tried this spot as I was craving fried rice and it had been suggested by some people on social media. I liked the quantity - it was enough for two people. Also liked the fact that they had added quite a lot of veggies. But the veggies weren't finely chopped, as I would expect in a fried rice dish. Instead, it had large chunks of carrot, ginger and cucumber which was a bit of a turn off. Additionally, I was disappointed with the flavor overall. Even though this was 'spicy' fried rice, it lacked spice and the taste didn't really stand out. Might give this place another go for other dishes on the menu.
2020-08-13,4,Solid take out meal! We ordered in a few weeks ago and the food came quickly. Really awesome Pad Thai! Large portions, good quality ingredients. Next time we get the itch for Thai (and we're in NJ) we will for sure order from T Thai!
2020-08-13,3,I ordered the pad Thai with added shrimp and the Tom yum soup. The pad Thai didn't taste very authentic, all you could taste was the sweet sauce they cooked it in. The shrimp was extra and it didn't add to the noodles much.
2020-08-12,5,Love trying new food from this hidden gem! The Tom Kha chicken coconut soup is incredible. All of the curries are delicious. Very quick delivery.
2020-07-02,1,Do not order food from here.Reasons1. They get only half of your order. 2. I ordered green curry , spicy fried rice with side of wings and soup.   I never got fried rice. Curry was disaster. No taste. Actually no curry, only chicken and veggies with zero taste. Wings were very dry. Honestly it was waste of money.
2020-06-28,5,Just moved into the neighborhood and this is now my go to Thai takeout spot!! Looking forward to eating here once things are back to normal. The cashew chicken is amazing, with great spice and flavor!!
2020-06-18,5,Every time I go to Jersey City, T Thai is the first place I go to for food. The staff is very respectful! The food is delicious!!
2020-06-11,2,The food is ok at best. The delivery is fast. I have never eaten here, only ordered delivery.
2020-05-13,1,Food never showed. Seamless said it was the restaurant's fault. They pushed back the delivery time 5 times before I called to find out what was going on. NEVER TRUSTING THEIR LIES AGAIN
2020-05-06,1,I ordered a delivery - Tom Yum Soup and Pad Thai, both are nahThere's only a frozen shrimp in the Soup, and there's hair! Chicken Pad Thai - chicken is too dry, they added too much pad that sauce Both are Americanized.
2020-03-06,3,Close to the Hoboken station and right on the same block as the police department. The food here is good, and the service was great. So why only 3 stars? I thought the sauces were good but not great. My red curry sauce lacked thickness and wasn't very creamy. My wife's brown sauce was also very thin. The vegetables and portions were ok but not abundant for the money. They do offer brown rice. A good experience but not a memorable one. Would we return? I don't think so with the number of other close and abundant choices available .
2020-02-08,1,Was in search of good vegetarian Thai restaurant and google pointed this one..checked the menu before going..looked good..they only have one vegetarian entree (Thai Fried Rice) other than that everything else has fish oil in it..they eveN don't want to cool without fish oil..would not recommend to any vegetarian.
2020-01-24,5,Solid. Excellent. Flavorful. Dynamic. YAS! Finally authentic Thai food with savory flavors and reasonable pricing! Ordered delivery from here (took a little longer than stated, but it was being delivered via DoorDash and it was rush hour time of the evening- no worries!I tried 4 Thai restaurants in Jersey City and horrible, in fact so horrible they closed down. T Thai is pretty reasonable price wise as well. I love the fact they deliver Thai iced tea and offer a cup size soup option for $4. Right now with certain Chase Sapphire Reserve Card, DoorDash delivery fees are waived and this restaurant participates saving me about $6 in delivery fees. I ordered a Tom Yum Soup and a Tom Kha soUp, veggie spring roll appetizer, Thai iced tea and cashew nut chicken. Everything was dynamite, bomb dot com and then some.
2020-01-07,3,This is my go to place for Thai take out. The delivery time is always quick and under 40 minutes. The pad Thai is very good. I always order the duck pad Thai and there's never a noodle left in the container, it's that good. The red curry dish mixed with coconut rice has a nice balance of spice and sweetness. This dish isn't as spicy as other curry dishes I've had, so for someone who's is introducing their taste buds with spicy foods, the curry dishes here are good starters. The mango salad is refreshing and light. The mango is cut super thin and is on top on a bed of lettuce with onions, tomatoes and comes with a spicy sweet sauce. I've order all of their soups and recommend them but removing a star for finding a long gray hair in the broth once.
2020-01-03,5,Yumm! Tried the chicken fried rice and pad Thai. Food arrived fast and fresh. Super delicious, give this place a try if you haven't already.
2020-01-01,4,This place tends to make their dishes and drinks very sweet so if you like that, then this is the place for you. Their pad see ew was on the sweeter side as was their Thai iced tea. They also use regular broccoli in their dish instead of a Chinese broccoli.
2019-12-29,2,First time ordering today, food is pretty subpar. The spicy noodle should as well be renamed sweet noodle, not only wasn't it spicy (even though I specially requested for extra spicy), it tasted very unsavory, and again sweet. The chicken wings were also dry and unappetizing. This place has more yelp stars that the other local thai places, not sure how!
2019-12-28,5,Great fast and good quality food! Always go with the pad Thai and chicken basil spicy !
2019-12-20,5,I've come here multiple times before with my friends and we will keep coming here!We always get the calamari and chicken pad thai, so I can't speak to any other dish. The calamari is nice and crispy with the usual sweet chili sauce.The chicken pad thai is sooo good! One of the best in the area. It's coated in a good amount of sauce and the bean sprouts add a good crunch. The chicken is also tender. A lot of other pad thais usually have the driest chicken but this one doesn't.You can also BYOB. We've done that multiple times. This does seem more like a takeout place though. I've never seen many people sit down and eat.
2019-11-25,4,I have both dined in and ordered delivery from T Thai, and I have always enjoyed it.  Occasionally I start with a Tom Yum Soup, warming up my taste buds with its spicy and acidic notes.  From there, I always select one of two dishes - either the Rice Noodles and Broccoli (their version of Pad See Ew) or the Chilli Paste and Basil Entree with eggplant and bell peppers, though the protein I opt to include often varies.  Both main courses are always flavorful and not very greasy.  When it comes to presentation, the restaurant is casual and comfortable, while the delivery is quick and efficient, making T Thai one of our top meal providers.
2019-10-28,4,Delicious, fast, very convenient place to order food for take out during my lunch hour. I put my order in via yelp and by the time I walk down the street to pick up it's ready. Service is great and fast if you go and sit. Flavors are delicious, excellent menu. Highly recommend !
2019-10-24,4,I really like their Beef Padthai. Probably the best thing on their menu... But I am biased.
2019-10-23,4,I stopped by here for quick lunch with colleagues. I absolutely loved their food. There were some vegetarian options, spicy noodles with tofu was incredibly good. I also tried some veg dumplings and spring rolls for appetizers. Restaurant was always clean inside and out. Staff was always making sure to check in so your not left hanging there.
2019-10-22,1,Good food, but giving 1star for the service. The server we had was just obnoxious. To the extent she pulled away a fork from my son who was fiddling with it after the meal. We have been there multiple times but this experience was bad. May not go back again. Satay which is a block away has similar food and much better service
2019-10-18,4,I really enjoyed the early bird special! $15 for soup, salad, "appetizer" (1-2 pieces of a normal appetizer), and full entree. And I mean FULL!! So much food I had to take it home. The last few times I've gotten Thai from other places the portions have been underwhelming, especially for noodle dishes. T Thai was flavorful, filling, and not too greasy. The vegetables tasted fresh and the noodles were perfectly cooked. I wish the place was a little nicer inside but it's a great little local place if you want a good deal and tasty food!
2019-10-05,1,Via Seamless, we placed our order. The driver refused to deliver the order to our building, even though we paid the delivery fee, driver tip AND we have temporary parking in front of or building, thanks to Duncan Donuts!!  T Thai REFUSED to give a refund even though we did not get our order. We WERE a regular customer. We will get our refund for ORDER NEVER RECEIVED from Seamless.  That's one sure way to lose a faithful customer thanks to one lousy driver... !!
2019-10-04,1,They cheat on quantity. They reduced all the quantities by half and kept the prices the same. Not good value for money.
2019-09-30,5,I have been coming here for a while for the early bird special, and I usually get the spicy noodle entree, but today I decided to try something different. I went ahead and tried the Panang Curry entree and I was not disappointed. I had never even heard of Penang curry,  and just kind of blindly chose it off the menu (with a nod of affirmation from the friendly waitress.)  It was extremely flavorful and has quickly moved into my top 10 dishes. The curry mixed with the coconut milk are balanced delicately, and generously coat the chicken. Then you get a crunch from the peppers and long beans. All served with jasmine rice. I ate it down to the sauce. It's is everything you imagine when you think of comfort food. I would've ordered it again in the same sitting. I'm surprised this dish doesn't have more reviews.
2019-09-30,1,If you prefer white rice with massive chunks of raw vegetables to traditional fried rice then this is the place for you. We ordered curry puffs (the only thing that tasted decent but there were TWO), pineapple fried rice which literally just was not that, Thai dumplings which who even knows what they were, and some kind of broccoli noodle thing that was also bad. I wish I could go back in time and get a Big Mac instead of wasting my money at this terrible place.
2019-09-21,5,How do you say effing great curry in Thai? "Effing great curry" or TThai. I went twice in 2 days for the Massman curry. Apparently Jersey people are delicate on the "heat" but that is my only issue. Get the Thai tea also, soooo refreshing like a cold beer on a hot summer day. I could probably drink 10 of them and I didn't even order the first one, it was delivered by mistake since my Israelite friend doesn't know what a real ice tea is. Best mistake I have made since entering the men's best chest contest in 1999.
2019-09-20,5,Weekly customer I have become since June ! Tried several items from this menu ! The lunch portions come with a small side salad and mini egg roll. Spicy Noodles: this is my go to. The noodles are thick and sticky, and the spice level is tolerable or you can order extra spicy. Perfect amount of meat, sprouts, and vegetables. I've tried with beef and chicken, both delicious. Pad Thai: this was just ok for me. This dish would not being me back again unlike the others. Spicy rice: yes also another great option !!! Green curry: this was good as well. I ordered extra spicy to take into count the coconut cream lessens. The dish was delightful, and I also see others frequently ordering this one. Thai Ice Tea: I get this every time. Without a doubt you'll want more. Thai Ice coffee: another solid drink - I feel this one really have me a wake up kick for the afternoon. Appetizer Shrimp is delicious. I don't eat shrimp and these are incredible. Squeeze fresh lime on, and boom flavor.
2019-09-18,1,I ordered green curry from T Thai for dinner from Doordash. Firstly, the quantity was really less. It was a small takeaway container with only vegetables and very little gravy. Secondly, it had a strong overpowering smell of fish that made it difficult to eat. I wish they would mention in the description that they add fish/shrimp sauce to it so that vegetarians can steer clear of the dish. The curry tasted very bad and gave me stomach ache. Thirdly, the rice was very sticky and overcooked. I had mentioned in the special instructions if they could a little more rice, since usually the quantity of rice can be less. They treated this as an additional order and charged my card without calling me for approval. This was one of the worst experiences of Thai food I have had. I would not recommend!
2019-08-31,5,T Thai is a favorite of mine. It is delicious every single time I go. I love that they have a lunch special even on the weekends that is a huge plus for me. I strongly recommend the peanut curry or spicy noodles!
2019-08-26,2,Well. Me and my wife have been to every possible Thai place near us. This places food is pretty good but there is one thing that annoys me to death. While the curry puffs in themselves are good, They serve just two on a small plate. I find that most Thai places give 3. But the really annoying part is the cucumber sauce. They barely cut the cucumber. It's the largest 1/4" 1/3" inch chunks of cucumber on the east coast. This has taken place FOR YEARS. Someone back in the kitchen needs to stop being lazy and finely dice the cucumbers so one can spoon it into their delicate puffs. Also. My second to last time here one of the waitresses was a tad stank. Food is good. But years of bad chopping makes me give them a two. Sorry.
2019-08-08,2,We got the shrimp and the duck pad thai, and it was extremely vinegar-y, and didn't taste much like what pad Thai is supposed to taste like. The Thai tea and the chicken appetizers were okay at best, but I'd think for a restaurant in Hoboken with this price, it'd be better. Disappointing!
2019-07-17,4,Their coconut rice is to die for. Their lunch specials are amazing. Everything is delicious and it's BYOB. Here's the thing. There was one time that I went there that they tried to keep a large amount of change from me when I paid cash. It was when I was out with a bunch of friends and I assume they figured we wouldn't notice. I had to argue to get my money back...But the food is really good and of all the times I went there that was a one time thing. But it needs to be said for those who are looking to get an honest review.
2019-07-11,5,This restaurant is so good, we had the chicken pad Thai; phenomenal. The only complaint I have is the amount of time we have to wait for our food. Other then that very enjoyable and authentic.
2019-07-02,4,T Thai is a cute little (kinda hidden)Thai restaurant.Actually I was recommended by the people from basic food market as T Thai is not greasy, pretty good place for Thai in Hoboken.When I was waiting for my food, I saw a lady who was making the spring rolls, felt pretty cozy & relaxed feeling to be there, there are some solo people were eating pad Thai, noodles etc.I got beef Pad Thai & shrimp fried rice.Even lunch time, they give you pretty big portion(took almost 3days to finish), good fresh ingredients, wasn't greasy, so I felt good after eating.I really liked their pad Thai, also I would like to try their crab fried rive next time!I like this place!
2019-06-13,4,Very delicious!! I got the green curry (chicken) extra spicy with a side of rice. it was soooo good.
2019-06-11,5,I've always been really impressed with T-Thai. Very fast, great specials, and the best Tom Kha I've had to date. The indoor seating is small but nicely decorated and always clean. Pineapple fried rice is excellent as well. The last time I flew in to the city I made a special trip over to Hoboken just to eat here and reminisce on my college days!
2019-05-29,4,A bunch of co-workers and I were visiting a local government office and decided to get a large take out order while we worked through lunch.  Takeout was a good choice because there wasn't an open table when we picked up.  We had the steamed Thai dumplings, two orders of the chicken pad Thai, an order of the chicken massaman curry, and chicken red curry.  The lunch specials aren't fantastic.  It includes a very tiny side salad and a very small fried vegetable roll i.e. the size of your pinkie finger.  However, the portions were generous.  The chicken pad Thai was probably too sweet for my liking.  It was the sweetest pad Thai that I can recall ever having.  Plenty of chicken and the portion was large.  The 4 dumplings were smaller than bite size but perfect for dipping.  Was everything tasty?  Yes.  High grades for the chicken massaman curry.Prices were very fair.  There is no street parking.  There are a few tables outside and good for people watching.  It's right next to the Hoboken Police Station so I wouldn't recommend misbehaving.
2019-05-27,3,Definitely average Thai food. I would recommend trying other places in Hoboken. Seriously - delivery was slow too much sugar in the iced tea.
2019-05-05,3,The thai food is decent for this area but the customer service is not so good. The food taste good (soups, noodles, curry, chef specials). We order at least 1-2 times a week on an average. We ordered the clear noodle soup and it cost $10 but today they gave us a soup that was about 1/2-1/3 of the container. I called them up and told them that we usually get the soup to be full but why is it half? See the picture. Plus there were only a few pieces of chicken. She said that's how they serve and asked me what I wanted in return. Told them to refund the 10 or deliver a new one and she goes to say I can give half of the money back for the soup 5 because I have half of the soup here at home. What nonsense. Finally arguing with her she refunded the 10 dollars. Extremely unprofessional and rude. Businesses in this area need to learn how to run a business and learn customer service or they will lose loyal customers or even go out of business.
2019-04-25,3,This is my go-to place in Hoboken for takeout Thai, I find it to be better than the other Thai places I've tried in Hoboken. That said, I think there are a lot of Thai restaurants in Manhattan at the same price point that are  noticeably better (e.g. Rhong Tiam).
2019-04-13,3,Ordered their delivery - got the spicy noodles and chili basil chicken. Portion was quite small. Noodles were okay. Chili basil chicken tasted better - only few pieces of chicken though.
2019-03-27,4,This isn't top notch Thai food but the service is fast, price is cheap, and portions are large - great spot for a quick lunch. This place can get real crowded real fast so I recommend getting in a little before noon to avoid the lunchtime rush. If you're getting takeout, make sure to call at least 20 minutes ahead of time. I have never seen this place empty at lunch time. However, if there is a wait, it's usually not too bad since people eat quickly.Immediately after you sit down, they provide you with a lunch specials menu that covers the basics: pad thai, curry, fried rice, glass noodles, etc. I consistently order either the pad thai or the fried rice since they're hard to mess up. I always get the chicken as my meat of choice since it's dependable but the beef tastes pretty good too. After you order, they give you a small plate of salad with peanut dressing and a spring roll as an appetizer. The spring roll doesn't taste great but it's a nice little treat before the main course.For less than $10, the portion size and taste of the food is well worth it. I never finish my dish in one sitting. There's just SO MUCH FOOD. This is a great place to go if you're on a tight budget since you can easily split it into two meals. When the weather gets warmer, they also have a small patio out front where you can sit outdoors, people watch, and enjoy a quick lunch with friends/coworkers.
2019-02-23,2,This is without a doubt, the worst Pad Thai I have ever had in my life. I've eaten a lot of Thai food in my life in the US and in Thailand. By no means am I comparing this dish to the way it's made in Thailand but this is unacceptable. Thai food is all about a balance between sweet, savory, and spicy and this dish was all sweet with a tiny hint of savory and zero spicy. Fine, I can forgive the lack of spiciness to it because I understand the demographic who goes to this restaurant but to have almost zero savoriness makes this Pad Thai almost inedible. You can tell that they did not put enough of the savory components of the sauce (fish sauce, vinegars, soy sauce) because the noodles which normally have a reddish hue to them are a petrified white (see picture below). There is almost zero chicken. The only reason why I'm giving this two stars is because my girlfriend enjoyed her Tom Yum soup and Panang Curry.
2019-02-18,4,great food at great prices! proportions were plenty and served quickly. waitresses were very sweet and checked on us as at appropriate times. area is great too, easy walk to desserts nearby or towards the pier after having a delicious meal. definitely recommend.
2019-01-05,2,I'm sorry but the Pad Thai at this place was the worst Pad Thai I ever had and I eat it quite often. It was sweetened (tasted like honey?) to the point of inedible - I only ate a few forks. The thai ice tea was nice, so was the restaurant itself. My husband said he was scared to touch the light switch in the bathroom, though. We would not return if we lived in NY.
2018-12-17,5,Just had a glass noodles mixed with chicken egg and vegetables, truely awesome , authentic taste .. I asked the waitress to make it spicy , it was right on point.. whenever I travel to Hoboken , my must sit down place !! Cheers!!Service was so nice
2018-12-05,1,God, where do I start. This is by far the worst Thai restaurant I've ever tried, which is saying a lot since I live in NY/NJ and I eat Thai food at least 3x a week. I ordered three basic Thai dishes for delivery during lunch time and the only thing they did right was the Thai iced tea. The papaya salad tasted disgusting - it was like they flavored it with just lemon juice. I ordered a fried ice cream (green tea), and they ended up giving me two scoops of green tea ice cream instead. Huh?Being that they're one of the few Thai restaurants in Hoboken, I guess they still get business even if the food is crappy‍ simply due to lack of other options.To consumers: if you support businesses even when the food is crappy, they'll never improve and you'll never get what you paid for. BTW the two scoops of green tea ice cream was $6... so overpriced‍ never again.
2018-11-11,1,Ordered through Grubhub. Never received order. Asked restaurant for explanation. They asked me to contact Grubhub. Disappointing service. Won't order from them again.
2018-11-02,1,Ordered delivery and have been waiting over two hours. The restaurant has now closed and nobody is answering the phone.
2018-10-24,5,Best drunken noodles I've had in the Hudson county region. They use fresh ingredients and you feel clean after eating their food.
2018-10-13,4,Very good food at affordable prices. We had their green and red curry dishes. Both were delicious.
2018-10-13,4,Came in after 12:30pmI was seated and right away was given a glass if water and they pointed out the their lunch special menu.I order the Green Chicken Curry that comes with white rice and salad & 1 veggie spring roll drizzled with some kind of peanut sauce dressing. Portion was good. I had to ask for extra rice, so it's safe to say that it could be a 2 person meal if you're a light eater. It was delicious.I asked it to be extra spicy but still wasn't as spicy as I wanted it to be..but it's ok.  They're very attentive and friendly.
2018-10-07,5,Best restaurant for Thai food in Hoboken as pretty much all other places for Thai aren't good here. I ordered the drunken noodles aka pad Kee mao. The spice level is good although if you like really spicy ask them to do spicy not just medium spicy. The masaman curry here is also good, along with the basil chicken (not a gravy food). The service here is very friendly. The servers are always very attentive, smiling, and helpful.Now this isn't the best Thai food in NJ but it is the best in the area and it's reasonably priced, a comfortable casual dining setting, with very friendly service.
2018-10-06,5,I love this place. Very nice and friendly staff, but the food is amazing. I judge thai places by how good the pad thai is and this is the best you can find in the area. I have been to just a few places in the city that can compare.
2018-09-06,3,Love the food but they seem to be completely unable to deliver an order within their estimated time range. I'm going to have to eat something else because he food is so late and I have to go, so this is wasted. I've given them multiple chances because I really like their food but it's just not worth it.
2018-08-24,1,I ordered Pad Thai with Chicken two days ago. A few hours after eating it I got food poisoning. Worst pain I have ever been in. It was so bad I am turned off from eating Thai complexly. Would of been less sick if I ate food off of the side walk.
2018-07-08,4,Pretty good Thai spot! In fact, it's my go to Thai spot in Hoboken. Service is always super fast and the wait staff is very nice. Food is pretty good and they have give generously sized portions in my opinion.
2018-07-03,1,I rarely review but this deserved special consideration.   One of the worst delivery meals I've ever had.  Terrible - I don't know how you can make Thai food taste this bad.
2018-07-01,1,The spicy fried rice is absolutely disgusting. Feels like a pile of salt was just dumped on it. Vegetable fried roll was just as bad. Would not ever order from here again
2018-06-16,5,I moved out of Hoboken and one of the places i miss the most is T Thai.  Good lord is this the best peanut sauce this side of the Hudson. There's a lot of places to get Thai in Hoboken but T wins all day everyday.  Oh and get the cheese puffs as an appetizer. You won't regret it.
2018-06-08,1,Order elsewhere. I have now experienced twice where my order was over an hour late. I make phone calls and they insist the food is on its way, then have to make a second phone call 40 minutes later because the food still hasn't arrived. I gave them a second chance thinking it was fluke. Don't give them your business. Order elsewhere.
2018-06-03,5,I found this gem a few weeks ago, and this place has quickly turned into my favorite place to grab lunch specials.  The prices are extremely reasonable, and I have yet to meet a staff member that wasn't friendly.  If you like can handle spicy, my go to is the spicy noodles (It's like drunken noodles but slightly different).  Highly recommended!
2018-05-27,2,Spring rolls all bread. Pad Thai noodles not so good. Curry was pretty good. Average Thai place
2018-05-19,4,This is a great quick lunch place. Their lunch specials are really cheap and pretty good, and they serve you so fast! I love it for that reason even though it's probably not the best Thai food I've ever had. But as far as Hoboken options go, it's great. My favorite is the massaman curry, but their other curries and pad Thai are good too. Lunch specials come with a spring roll and small salad. Again, the service is really quick and efficient, so you can easily be in and out in under an hour.
2018-04-27,1,The food is good but the delivery service is HORRIBLE!!!  It took over an hour and 1/2 to get my order out of their door when I ordered it at 5:45 in the afternoon. No restaurant is that busy at that hour.  I will never order from them again.
2018-04-14,1,T Thai was my favorite Thai place in Hoboken, and I placed orders weekly through delivery.com. Apparently now you can only order delivery through services that charge delivery fees. Too many other places in Hoboken to choose from. Bye, T Thai.
2018-04-14,4,A perfect Thai food experience, very authentic and absolutely delicious. I always have the Tom Yum soup, curry puffs and chicken skewers. On occasion, during peak hours, delivery can be problematic, with slightly degraded food, but I've never been less than bowled over when I visit the restaurant in person. The staff is terrific and I leave feeling satiated and energized.
2018-04-03,4,Ordered from here after it showed up on Seamless for us in JC.  I agree with others who say that there aren't any real standout Thai restaurants in the area, but T. Thai is pretty good overall.  I did think that their Green Curry was genuinely very good - I asked for extra spicy and it came with decent heat.  The Pad See Ew was very good as well - more vegetables than other places - and the noodles were soft and chewy.  The Pad Thai was disappointing - it tastes sweet and seemed like a dish catering to a more Western pallet.  The appetizers (dumplings and squid) were decent although not spectacular.  Overall, it was a worthwhile meal and I plan on ordering from them again - their curries and non-Pad Thai noodle dishes were very good.  I would other give a 3/5 stars if I could, but am rounding to 4 for this review.
2018-04-03,4,Ordered delivery from this restaurant. Tom yum soup and pad kee mao. It was spicy as asked for and was delivered in time.
2018-03-21,5,Best chicken pad thai I've ever had! I prefer pad thai that's more on the sour-sweet side, and this does the job perfectly. It's conveniently located a few blocks away from the Hoboken PATH station. If you get the pad thai as their lunch special, which is $8 before 4:00, it also comes with an appetizer of salad and spring roll, which are lackluster compared to the main dish. The noodles of the pad thai are slightly al dente but still chewy, and they mix the bean sprout, green onion, carrot and peanuts with the noodles. The portion is really large, and can be split into two meals. They take card, and split it amongst our party of 4. I always come back whenever I'm feeling down and need to indulge a plate of heavy noodles.
2018-03-19,5,This is definitely my favorite Thai restaurant. The service is always fast and the food is always fresh. I would highly recommend this restaurant. The duck pad thai is my favorite thing here. If you come in before 4 there's a great lunch special that's only $8.
2018-03-05,5,This is my favorite Thai restaurant in town, I love their staff, service and quality of their food. The restaurant is very clean and intimate.I'm a big fan of their Thai Iced T ($3) and I always order the vegetarian duck with spicy noodle $12 and the cheese puff appetizer which costs around  $5.00 for two pieces of flaky on the inside but creamy surprise on the inside of hot melted cheese.  They accept credit card/cash and they do deliveries and are quite fast. Minimum order of $10.00 is required for deliveryThey have outdoor seating when the weather is nice and it's also BYOB.  It's a great ambiance, really no frills but worth checking out their food. If you're lucky they have this blue crab fried rice which is one of their specials which is delicious and you can tell them how spicy you want on their dishes.I don't think they use MSG since I don't get tired after a hearty meal. Enjoy!
2018-02-09,1,Food was ok, delivery took two hours. Won't be ordering again. The delivery driver was rude too.
2018-01-20,5,Ordered curry puffs, red curry and veg fried roll. Food was delicious. Service was prompt and the place isn't expensive at all! I'll return when I'm in the area again!
2017-12-17,3,Not sure why sautéed veggies should take over an hour to be delivered but every time I've ordered the wait has been borderline ridiculous. My husband and I both ordered at the same time tonight, he did Pure Pita and within 25 minutes his order was here...I'm still waiting for mine over an hour now and counting. Hoboken needs more Thai options! Or T Thai needs to get their delivery act together.
2017-12-02,1,Is it impossible to find a decent Thai restaurant in Jersey City/Hoboken?! Decided to order delivery tonight at T Thai. Much to my surprised when I opened the containers the Tofu with basil sauce was just 4 huge chunks of cold tofu in the dish!!! The chicken pad thai barely any chicken in it and the chicken wings were over fried and dry. Ugh I can deal with subpar pad thai and over cooked wings but the COLD chunks of soft tofu in the dish was so disgusting. Recommend staying Far Far away from this thai restaurant!
2017-11-06,3,Good food. Essentially my go-to for Thai takeout. The only downside is that they forget my order 50% of the time and after an hour of waiting, I have to call to check on it. Then they say it's out for delivery, but it shows up piping hot 30 minutes later, signaling that they most likely prepared it while I was on the phone checking the status and proceeded to lie. Also, warning to those with allergies, if you are ordering via Seamless, the "special instructions" text will be vehemently ignored.
2017-11-06,1,Worst Experience ever ... Requested any thing vegetarian... they were so rude and confirmed that they don't have anything without oyster or fish sauce ... requested them whether they can make veg fried rice without adding those sauces ... they rudely told no they cannot make ... i just had to drink a fruit juice when my friends were having their lunch .... rude customer service ... sincere request to vegetarians and vegans  ... pls do not visit this place ... you will definitely be offended and disappointed ... !
2017-10-14,4,We eat here regularly. The duck curry is nice, though the duck is sometimes skinny and skimpy. The Pad See Yew with beef was excellent today. Chicken wings we tasty but have a lot of breading and took more ham 30 minutes to come. Not many Thai restaurants in Hoboken and this is our go-to.
2017-10-01,2,I really really want to like this place. The staff seem very nice. I ate here once in the restaurant and once through delivery. The first time I got the pad Thai early bird dinner special. The pad Thai did not taste authentic (I think they use vinegar in place of tamarind) but it was sort of tasty. I'd say three stars. I just ordered delivery tonight though and unfortunately the pad Thai this time was so bad and overloaded with sugar that I just threw the entire thing in the trash. I have /never/ done that with Thai. I have a very high tolerance for meh when it comes to my pad thai. Unfortunately, it was that bad. I hope they can improve the food. Hoboken needs a good Thai place and the staff are nice here.
2017-09-30,5,Great options and good value for the price! Servers are fast and friendly. I think it is BYOB- which I like! I prefer it during lunch but dinner is great too! Overall good experience
2017-09-09,1,As many times as I enjoyed coming here, it only takes one bad experience to sour me on a restaurant, and that's the case today.  My wife and I went to T Thai for lunch today, knowing that their lunch special ended at 4pm (we've been coming for 2 yrs).  We arrived at 3:55pm sat down and, knowing what we wanted sat ready as the waitress folded napkins a few tables away from us.  She came back to our table a few minutes later, and as we started ordering our lunch said "I'm sorry lunch ends at 4pm".  I said "I know, that's why we rushed here and got here before 4."  She said "yes you arrived at 3:55, I looked at my watch, and had you ordered then you'd be fine". I kid you not!I retorted "wait, if I ordered as I was walking to the table, I'd be fine, but after waiting while you folded napkins forget it?"  She said "sorry"I implored her not to do this, she'd be losing good long time customers, but she stood motionless.  If a place wants to play a game of technicalities with me, they lose me.  Make up your own mind if you want to go there.
2017-09-08,4,Had Lunch today at this Thai spot and was very impressed. It was a nice change up for lunch and was very good. They have an awesome Lunch Menu that is a great deal compared to other lunch spots in Hoboken. I got the Shrimp Spicy Rice which was $8.60 with tax, you also get a house salad and a spring roll with the lunch menu. All were very delicious and you get a nice sized plate of food. The food came out quick and the service was great. My only complaint was having only 4-5 Shrimp in the rice, which is usually the case with Shrimp dishes. Restaurants tend to go on the lighter side but would have liked a few more Shrimp in there. Definitely worth checking out, you won't regret it.
2017-09-01,4,Cute little Thai place in Hoboken, they have outdoor seating (where we sat) and the staff is very friendly and attentive. The place is also byob and they provide an ice bucket if you need one. We got there around 615 and made it in time for the early bird specials which run 4pm to 7pm. For $15 (or $16 depending on the protein you get in your entree) you get a soup (tom yum or coconut), a small side salad with peanut sauce, an appetizer (fried calamari, Thai dumplings with chicken and shrimp, spring rolls, or shrimp rolls) and then you pick an entree with the protein you want (veggie, tofu, chicken, shrimp, squid, beef). We got 2 or the specials, so we tried both soups and for the entree we got the chicken pad Thai and the basil sauce with veggies and squid which comes with white rice. Some things were too spicy for me but everything tasted great! The restaurant is quite, since its not on Washington street, and I'm definitely looking forward to coming back again soon!
2017-08-12,5,This is simply the best Thai restaurant in Hoboken. Everything is fresh and flavorful. If you're a vegetarian try the veggie duck. It's unbelievable! Close to the path train too.
2017-08-10,5,Love the food here! And the service is friendly and efficient. Well priced for what you get. Can't get enough of their Tom Kha
2017-08-09,5,So happy I stumbled upon this place. I eat here at least once a week. Good food, affordable prices and great service. My favs here are the fried calamari and the shrimp or vegetable fried rice. The coconut water is a banger too.
2017-08-09,2,I only dined in one time and had the Pad Thai.  I was not impressed with the food.  The staff was helpful and the restaurant had a nice ambiance.  I am willing to try again however and will update my review once I do so.
2017-06-12,5,This no frills restaurant is my one of my favorite Thai spots in Hoboken.The service is great!  As soon as we walked in the waitress greeted and seated us. Even throughout the meal the waitress was very attentive.We had the lunch special, for $8 you get a spring roll, salad and an entree. A lot of food for only $8!!The entree came out really fast, we were only half way through our salad lol. I ordered the Chicken Thai Basil, which was seasoned really well. The Basil sauce wasn't to spicy and it included lots of veggies (always need veggies with every meal). My husband's pad thai with beef was also really good. The glass noodles were flavorful and the dish wasn't dry at all. I had some unpleasent experiences where the the pad thai was super dry and crispy. Pad thai should never be crispy!I highly recommend T Thai for a cheap Thai meal.
2017-05-08,1,Sadly, I was once again fooled by the reviews for restaurants in Hoboken.  I keep forgetting now the new people that live here are from ELSEWHERE and have no clue about good food vs NOT!   This place gets rated as the best Thai.  I ordered.  Its not even Thai food.  I dont know where the cooks are from but they clearly are not Thai and have never had Thai food.  I ordered simple Pad Thai.   What they sent are noodles but they are not Thai looking or tasting.  I guess there arent any good Thai places to eat in Hoboken.   Stick with a burger from The Stewed Cow!
2017-04-04,3,Walked in here for dinner around 7-8pm on a Saturday night and there were plenty of tables open. The space is small, but from what I could see it didn't tend to fill up too often. We were immediately seated and were asked for drink and app orders shortly after. They also brought out a bottle opener and offered glasses for our BYOB drinks. I ordered a tom yum soup (Thai hot) for my app, while others at the table got the grilled squid and a fried roll. My soup came out nice and spicy, just the way I like it. If you like it this way (and not watered down) make sure to ask for it Thai hot. I didn't try the fried roll, but my friend finished it so I assume it was fine. The grilled squid, however, was completely rubbery and pretty inedible. My friend tried one piece and I tried another to confirm it was terrible. So this remained untouched after this. A server later asked us if she should pack this to go and we told her no, to which she relied, "No good?" and received an honest answer about it being chewy beyond eating. For entrees one of my friends ordered Penang curry, which is tasty and good for people who don't want much spice. My other friend and I each ordered the green curry with chicken. I forgot to order it Thai hot- and wish that I had. I found this to be a very mild and underwhelming dish, despite being edible enough. My friend, however, thought it was too spicy for her taste (we both had the same spice level, which is the regular as it comes). So if you are a fan of spicy Asian cuisines, order Thai hot, and if you can't handle Asian spice maybe order it mild. Service wasn't exactly friendly, nor was it unfriendly- despite maybe an eye roll when friend was deciding on order choice. Just kind of quick and to the point in general. I probably wouldn't come back here, but if you're in the area and need a quick Thai to-go or delivery, you're probably pretty safe on ordering a curry dish- just specify your desired level of spice.
2017-03-24,5,Dragged my mom to Hoboken for good eats and came across this gem because of lack of parking. What a perfect nightmare! The food was amazing. We started with the hot &a sour lemon grass shrimp soup.. perfection! We also had the grilled shrimp w chili sauce.. amazing! fried rice entrees were great as well. I'll be back again and again if parking allows for it.
2017-03-11,5,I've been to this place twice. It's a nice hidden Thai place. The red curry and Thai iced tea are always my favorite!
2017-02-22,3,Came in on a weekday for lunch, the place had a nice ambiance and wooden tables. Their lunch special was $8 dollars for an entree, spring roll, and salad. The salad was pre-made and brought out pretty fast, globbed with peanut dressing and a few tomatoes over lettuce, I wasn't impressed. The spring roll tasted like it was sitting at the bottom of one of those plastic chinese-delivery containers for a while. For my entree I took the peanut curry with shrimp. I asked how spicy it was and I was told medium (it ended up being mild actually imo), but it would have been nice if they offered to cater it to my liking. The peanut curry itself wasn't bad, all though I only got around 4 pieces of shrimp (with the tails intact, and no knife, they did bring one though after I asked). I suppose I got what I paid for here, an OK fast thai lunch with no frills. If I was back in Hoboken I would likely try another establishment first before returning.
2017-02-14,4,The food was really delicious. We ordered take out to be delivered, which took about an hour on a Sunday evening. The portions were not as large as the Thai places I usually order from, but the food makes up for it. Also, the price is relative to the area and food type, so for two people, with tip and tax, expect it to be about $50 (with next day leftovers). We ordered the sweet & sour chicken, eggplant/basil chicken, chicken skewers w/ PB sauce (a little fatty) and steamed dumplings.
2017-01-27,5,straight fireeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee meal I just had. The rice noodle and broccoli had not only delicious texture but was a full on party in my mouth
2017-01-16,5,We love this place as our go-to eating out or delivery option. They are always very fast and the food is always great! Love the pad thai, spicy noodle, and tom kha soup the best.
2016-12-11,5,The food is incredible and the service is super speedy! The lunch special is an incredible deal, and I would highly recommend the massaman curry.
2016-12-06,1,**BEWARE** Used to like going there all the time. The food seemed good today UNTIL TODAY. I've always been weary of why it's so dark in there. As I was eating my food, I noticed bugs flying around and had to "shoo" them away from my food which made me want to take a closer look at my food only to notice there were little flies in the rice! I had asked for soy sauce which they brought to me in a little plate and there were 3 little flies in that too! Not sure if it was in the sauce and I poured it on to the rice or they were in both but regardless I'm never eating there AGAIN. After I mentioned it to the waitress she didn't say anything at all and tried to exchange it and I refused. It was very disturbing and disgusting.
2016-12-05,5,Love this restaurant. I get food delivered from here m. The portions are generous. The food is clean, not oily and yet so tasteful. The place is byob and offers various combination meals like appetizer, entree etc in a cheap price. This is one of my fav go to places in Hoboken.
2016-11-28,1,Food was cold when delivered about an hour and half after order. The chicken pad Thai was bland so I used half a bottle of cholula sauce to help with the taste, the beef flat noodles tasted like it was cooked in sewage water. I hope I don't have food poisoning. I wouldn't recommend this place to my friends or enemies.
2016-10-21,4,Very cosy place, good atmosphere. Parking definately a problem in case you plan to drive. would definately recommend to order Ginger Chicken. The food comes in time .
2016-10-05,3,Came here with a friend. Had the green curry and spring rolls for an appetizer. The food was decent, but nothing to write home about. If you're looking for a reasonably priced Thai place to eat, this is just fine.
2016-10-04,5,We recently moved to Hoboken and we have been hungry for Thai. We found this place casually walking around. The food was excellent, service was very good. They came and asked for water every few minutes and kept checking on us promptly even though there were a few customers outside. I am very happy to have found a Thai place we can visit often.
2016-10-02,3,Got the chicken Thai rice..not spicy and not seasoned at all..could have made it myself.. disappointed :(
2016-09-28,1,Can't seem to get delivery right. Called 1 hour in and was told they're in the area. 20 mins later, same response...somehow. At this point we cancelled.  8 mins later (1 hour 28 mins in) they finished the .4 mile journey.    Good luck.
2016-09-17,5,Green Thai curry was very very good. The tofu luscious and soft and the curry just perfectly spicy but not overly so. I went for lunch and the portion for the price is quite good too. The outdoor seating is lovely in the summer.This place stays a reliable lunch option and regardless of what I order (even the spicy noodles are fantastic), food stays great!!
2016-09-09,5,I stumbled upon this place en route to the city. A lunch special, the food and service was excellent. This is not a "luxurious" venue but in Thai fashion, it is a simple Thai restaurant. The food was so good I ordered delivery the next evening and everything was perfect!!! Best Thai in Hoboken in my mind !
2016-08-06,4,Reasonably priced and good food.  Delivery is usually fast. The Thai fried rice is delicious. I also like the noodle with broccoli.  All the dishes I have tried so far have been delicious.
2016-07-31,4,Nice Thai food place in Hoboken. We ended up walking in because it was close to the oarking lot where we left our rental and we were ravenously hungry. It turned out to be chill and low key, the type of place that's been in the neighborhood awhile and has a realiable following for dining in and carry-out.Lunch specials were very reasonably priced and portioned. We started with some chicken wings with chili (good), grilled squid with chili sauce and ground peanut (not bad but too tender for my taste...Iike squid chewy), and I had the spicy thick noodles with shrimp, which were good.There were also some interesting chef's specials if you're willing to spend a few extra bucks. Overall, a nice neighborhood Thai joint for the residents.
2016-07-20,4,Solid Thai food, had the red curry and my friends had the pineapple fried rice.  Generous portions, casual dining with small outdoor space.
2016-07-17,3,I got the lunch special. It was a great deal, lots of food for $8. However, I ordered the Pad Thai with tofu and was dissapointed that the tofu wasn't cooked or flavored -- they had just cut it up into cubes and put it (still cold in the middle) around the edges of the dish. If the tofu had been fried, or even if they had included extra of the flavored small peices of tofu instead, I would have really enjoyed this.
2016-07-15,5,Some of the best Thai food I've ever had! Went on a lunch date, we both had curries (peanut for me, green for her) and added broccoli. Lunch is $8 and big proportions! I only finished half. The peanut curry was creamy and DELICIOUS.  The green curry was a good amount of spicy. It took less than ten minutes to get our food -- I was impressed by the service. If I lived in NJ I would eat here all the time.
2016-06-30,5,I didn't know I liked Thai food until I went here. Their Pad Thai is amazing. Owner is so friendly and helpful. Highly recommend stopping in here for a delicious local meal!
2016-06-20,4,Located near the water, this is a great place to stop by on your date.I stop by at least once a month (which is a lot for me) and the staff are always nice. Sometimes the service is a little slow because they seem to do more take out than sit in. My go to orders are the beef pad Thai and chicken with ginger sauce. It's always fresh and has the right spices. Their pad Thai is a little on the sweeter side, I wish it had more tang naturally but I just squeeze extra lime on it.Be careful of their Thai ice tea, it's seriously addicting.
2016-05-19,3,I ordered the spicy rice wth shrimp and my friend ordered the pad Thai.  The spicy rice was alright but nothing special.  It only includes about 4 shrimp.  The portion of rice was huge.  I did not try the pad Thai but my friend said it was great.  Service was as expected for the type of restaurant it is.  My water stayed filled, which all I can ask.
2016-05-13,5,Trust me, authentic Thai food like how my mom makes it. Cheap and large yummy portions. Pad Thai is on point! Get here by 1130 to beat the lunch special rush hour. Soup, salad/egg roll and meal for $8. Can't beat that for actual authentic Thai food.
2016-05-09,4,T Thai is a hidden gem in Hoboken. It is a very small and casual place with a great price. You can't beat the dinner special! It comes with a salad, soup, appetizer, and a full entree for under $20. The portions are super generous. The pro is that it's byob and the con is that they don't take reservations. Not that it's ever been a huge issue but with a rather larger party it might be.     I do recommend the Tom yum soup, the beef and pineapple fried rice, drunken noodles, the duck and mango salad and the shrimp roll. Complement the meal with a Thai ice tea and close the meal with their fried ice cream drizzled with raspberry purée.... Yummy!! I've never left this place not satisfied. Did I mention the service is great and the employees are super nice and attentive?! That really makes the experience as well.
2016-04-21,5,A hidden gem in Hoboken. The quality and amount of food you get for the price is unbeatable. Its also BYOB which makes it even more affordable. The food is always freshly made. The Calamari and Beef Pineapple Fried Rice are a must. For spicy food lovers, the Green Curry will not disappoint. I do wish they'd take reservations. The place is pretty small and getting a table for a bigger party may not be as easy. My go-to for homemade quality food.
2016-03-29,4,Solid thai food.  Nothing fancy.  There's really no incredible Thai food in this area so this is the best you are going to get.Got their pad thai lunch special and the noodles were fine, seasoned like most pad thai.  The spring roll that came with it was barely edible, but it could be a personal preference as I am generally not a fan of spring rolls.Got a thai iced tea and that tasted just like every other I've had.  All in all, I will be back as this is your best bet for Thai.
2016-03-28,3,Food: BI had a craving for pad thai, which is why I ended up here. I came with 3 friends and after we each ordered our food, they came out with an appetizer salad for each of us, simple iceberg lettuce with a bit of tomato and shredded carrots in a peanut sauce/dressing, as well as a miniature spring roll. It was a nice surprise, since none of us realized we'd be getting complimentary anything with our entrees, but both the salad and the spring roll were meh. The spring roll barely had anything in it - it looked a decent size, but it was mostly more of the dough/wrapping inside than filling. As for the pad thai that I ordered, the noodles were cooked very well, long and just chewy enough for my liking. However, I chose to order shrimp pad thai, rather than chicken, tofu, or beef, and I counted three shrimps. TOTAL. When I paid extra for the shrimp (it's slightly more expensive than chicken or tofu). Therefore, I can only give the food a B.Service: C+Sub par. I asked for my pad thai to be made spicy. It was not...at all. I didn't bother complaining since I was starving and didn't want to wait longer to eat, so I just mixed in hot sauce. I was very disappointed though. Other than that, the service was average. They weren't overly friendly, but we got our food and our waters were refilled. *shrug*Ambiance: B-This place is decorated very simply, nothing special. It was quiet here on a Sunday afternoon. There were maybe one or two other tables. One table was a man alone with his cellphone, which kept beeping incredibly loudly. Not the fault of the restaurant, but it really messed with the chill vibe here.All in all: This place overall was good, above average, but I've had much better thai food (pad thai specifically) and I was unimpressed by the place itself.
2016-03-26,5,Prompt delivery and tasty food. This is the second time I've ordered takeout and the food is excellent. I loved the curry puffs, Thai tea, and red curry (great kick!!!). This one is a keeper!
2016-03-09,4,Got the Early Bird Special that comes with a salad with peanut dressing, a choice of soup - tomyum or coconut, choice of an app, and entree - choice of meat with noodles, fried rice or pad Thai all for 15 bucks. I chose the coconut soup (with veggies instead of chicken) made with coconut milk and what tasted like fish sauce that provided a subtle salty enhancement to the normally bland tasting coconut milk. It was a nice balance that made it surprisingly tasty. Then, I had the chicken satay app, your regular standard satay. And for the entree, beef with Thai rice mixed with scallions, onions, and tomatoes. Although you get way more rice than protein, still a pretty good deal for the amount of food you get, which is just enough.
2016-02-27,2,The food was bland and unimpressive.  The pad Thai was stale with barely any protein.  I was thoroughly disappointed and will never order from here again. Subpar food aside, the restaurant staff was extremely rude over the phone without any explanation as to why delivery in Hoboken took 1.5 hours.
2016-02-23,5,It is a very cute small place with lovely and friendly waitress. The food is great! I always order massmum chicken mild spice. Can't wait to go back to this cute place.
2016-02-19,4,Hands down best Thai deliver in Hoboken. A little pricey for what it is at $11/dish but always tastes fresh and not too oily. I always get the pad Thai, fried rice, and/or chicken green curry and it never disappoints!
2016-02-13,4,Revision: I've had a few curry dishes and I've enjoyed each one - I haven't crossed T Thai off the list.
2016-01-31,4,Best Thai food in Hoboken. Dining isn't glamorous but the food is delicious and BYOB is nice as well. My husband and I went to Thailand last year and were curious how real Thai food would compare to the many Thai restaurants we eat at in the US and while of course it's not the same, this place does a really nice job especially if you compare to all other Thai places in hoboken (of course there are better options in NYC). Take out is always a quick, hot, and fresh which is great considering so many places do a disservice to their food with botching takeout. Chicken chili basil, pad Thai, Thai iced tea, and the curries are some of our faves here. Enjoy!
2016-01-25,5,Awesome food. Great service. Great lunch specials. Awesome place for lunch if you work in Hoboken.
2016-01-11,4,If you live in Hoboken, T Thai is your best bet for Thai food. My girlfriend and I usually order delivery, so I can't speak to the dining experience here. Solid Pad Thai and Pad See Ew dishes. Fairly generous portions to boot. I will order the Massaman Curry next time in an effort to see how good this place truly is.
2016-01-09,4,My fiancé and I came for dinner tonight! I had the chicken spicy basil and he had the steak salad, both were amazing!! Definitely an awesome Thai spot for date night on Hoboken!
2016-01-06,5,Delicious! I ordered the chili basil chicken which was spicy but great! Delivery took a little long but it was still hot and all fresh ingredients! Great price too!
2015-12-29,5,We have lots of favorites here. Appetizer has to be fried calamari. Kids love the chicken drunken noodle   My husband always has his spicy beef fried rice   I love my seafood drunken noodle   We try to squeeze in the grilled beef salad.  Thai tea is awesome there   Our kids always have the fried ice cream and my husband and I have our fried banana rolls with ice cream. This place doesn't break your bank. I can eat there every week.
2015-12-22,5,The chicken curry noodle soup is amazing. It has a lot of flavor and the chicken is tender. I ordered delivery and it arrived fast and hot.
2015-12-15,5,I order from here at least once a week. I highly recommend their curry noodle soup. Big portion super yummy. I've had this other places and it's never as good.As for other entrees, their pad Thai is pretty good and I've had most of the appetizers which aren't huge portions but do the job.
2015-12-09,2,Ordered through Seamless on a Wednesday night at around 7:45. Took almost 2 hours to get my food. I don't mind waiting 45 minutes, but come on! It's a Wednesday! Food was just okay, nothing to rave about.
2015-12-01,3,This place has so many negative reviews, that I decided to do mine. It seems that most of the reviews complain about customer service. I've never been there in person, but I ordered online a lot of times. Delivery takes what they say, about 45 minutes. So, well, if you know what you should wait, no reason to complain. The food is pretty honest. I wouldn't say that it is the best Thai Food I've ever had, but it is taste. Honestly, if you are in doubt, give it a try! And by the way, everybody has to keep in mind that you get what you pay for. If you want a $1000 dish in a $1.000.000 restaurant, pay for it! Cross the River, go to Eleven Madison Park and leave your paycheck there. It will worth every penny, but, spoiler alert: They do not do deliveries.
2015-11-26,1,I popped in here spur of the moment to split a Pad Thai & frankly it was nasty. I really hated it. We just paid & left. Don't come here.
2015-11-07,1,we had been coming to this restaurant for almost 5 years and the food was really good. Today we went back after a few months of absence and it was AWFUL. I ordered the chilli basil sauce and it was so salty that wasn't edible. I told the waitress about it, she took the plate back and brought it back...they had poured water on!!!...have they sold the business? fired the good chef? i don't know but at any rate, I'm n o t coming back.
2015-11-04,1,Terrible food!! Peanut butter sauce is not eatable. I ordered a delivery and could not finish eating it.
2015-11-01,5,I love this place, it's a nice intimate spot with great quality food and very good service, I look forward to coming back!
2015-10-19,1,ITS BETTER TO EAT AT HOME THAN GOING TO THIS PLACE. "SAVE YOUR MONEY"I have been to this place couple of times, this was one of my favourite place in Hoboken. But not anymore.The last time when i went there with my family friends, the experience we had was horrible. Firstly when we arrived no 1 came to us for 15mins, nobody asked us water. My husband went to the counter and informed that v are sitting, as the waitress was busy with her phone.We ordered appetisers followed by entree. When we were  finished with the appetisers no 1 replaced the used plates with fresh one's. When we asked the waitress to do so, she was very rude and without asking she started picking the plates from front of us, one of my friend had started eating in that plate. When we asked her what she is upto, she got mad at us. THAT WAS HIGHLY UNPROFESSIONAL.After that no 1 came to our table to ask whether we want anything or even to fill up our glass with water.This doesn't end here, after such pathetic service, the check came in with added 20% gratuity. I am not going to this place ever in my life.
2015-10-14,1,*AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS*Bumping down this place to 1 star, I wish there was a negative star option at Yelp!!We have been coming to T Thai for quite some time now but won't be coming back here in future after what happened with us recently here.Came here the other weekend with some close family friends during dinner hour.Place was almost empty. It took some time for the staff to realize that we came in so it took few minutes for get us seated which is fine.After we got seated for a good 15 mins nobody came to our table to ask if we needed water or we are ready to order.I went to the cash counter to call them to take our order and both staff members were busy with their phones.Eventually after placing our food arrived quickly. They expected us to use small appetizer plates for dinner as we were sharing , we requested bigger plates.One of my friends had started using the small appetizer plate for dinner , they came with bigger plates & literally took the small plate out of my friend while she was eating food.This is one most uncourteous and rude behavior I have seen in a restaurant. When we mentioned to our server she should not be doing this she instead of apologizing got mad.During the rest of the dinner time nobody came to us to ask if needed anything else or to refill water glasses.On top of this they had the audacity to put compulsory 20% gratuity.Overall a really bad experience,
2015-10-07,5,I noticed T Thai very soon after I moved here.  A small, hole-in-the wall shoppe with tables outside and a sign that says they deliver.  All the things I love.  Our first visit was quite pleasant - we sat outside enjoying the late summer sunshine. While I love basil curries and other flavors, for me the meal will be Pad Thai with chicken, no egg, extra lime.  This is what I ate in Bangkok.  This is what I ate in Koh Lanta.  This is the meal I enjoy.  For $10, you get a nice sized plate of hot noodles, savory chicken, and crisp bean sprouts.  Our second order was through YELP! as a pick up.  This meant that our order needed to stay warm until we got home - ! it was still piping hot when we finally got home and sat down to eat.  I think the order was even bigger than when we sat at the shoppe.  It was enough for two meals (lunch the next day).  If I had a complaint (and really, I don't) I would have liked a bit more green onions and peanuts and maybe some hot spicy sauce to go on top.
2015-10-04,3,Took my girl to Hoboken for her bday. We found this little hole in the wall near our hotel. The place was fairly clean and not as crowded. The food tasted fresh and served prompt. Overall good place, but the waitress didn't even asked if we wanted dessert after our entree. As soon as we finished eating she brought the bill. Just my personal thought. "Give customers a few minutes before kicking them out"
2015-09-28,4,The food is great, but in-restaurant service and delivery can be slow. BYOB and low cost makes it even better!
2015-09-26,4,Tried T Thai for the first time and we're hooked.  Everything is fresh and the the spices are bold. I wish the dishes were a little larger but with this place its quality over quantity.
2015-09-18,1,Worst Thai restaurant I've ever tried. The stuff are unfriendly. They look like very busy but they actually don't have that much customers. They will not serve you even they have seats empty unless you go and ask for it. They forgot my coconut juice at first. When I asked and it came, it's not COCONUT JUICE, it's a large ICE BRICK with coconut pieces inside. So I have to wait for it to melt. The check came very fast, even before I asked for it. I'll never come again.
2015-08-27,5,Ordered delivery on a Tuesday and it came in 45 minutes piping hot and delicious!!  Ordered the Thai basil fried rice, chicken entrée with chili basil sauce, and the Chicken green curry.  All were good but the BEST was the chicken with chili basil sauce.  I could eat this weekly!
2015-08-24,4,Great food and service! Only reason I did not give 5 stars was because there was a hair in our food. The waitress was textbook - she promptly apologized, took the remainder of the plate, and brought out a brand new plate of our order. The Basil Fried Rice was great! Will definitely come back
2015-08-23,3,solid meal for cheap. the peanut curry was good, a good serving, comes with a side salad and spring roll (whatever), the meat in the curry was weird. But overall not a bad meal
2015-08-03,1,One of the worst customer service experience I have ever encountered in my life.  I placed an order through seamless, after about 1.5 hours I called in to check where my food was and was greeted with the rudest woman on the phone.  She proceeded to tell me that they cancelled my food order an hour ago because I did not fall within the delivery boundaries. #1 if you show up on seamless with my delivery address listed, THEN IT IS YOUR FAULT THAT YOU DIDN'T CONTACT SEAMLESS TO CHANGE YOUR BOUNDARIES.  #2 I never received any cancellation notice and when I called seamless, they told me that T-Thai did not actually cancel my order at all, they just decided not to deliver to me and still charged my credit card.  #3 whoever this woman was turned this whole thing into a blame game and instead of trying to be accommodating she made it as though it was my fault and I should be the one finding a solution to this problem.VERY RUDE, DO NOT EAT HERE.  POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.
2015-07-23,5,Seating outside in this weeks great weather phenomenal. Seating inside casual. Ordered chili basil chicken and massaman chicken curry both were full of flavor and portions highly recommend
2015-07-14,5,Best Thai in hoboken! Great prices and fast delivery. Food is amazing! Try the peanut curry!
2015-07-11,1,I was very upset I spent my money on a low quality meal. The spring rolls barely had any filling (pure dough) and the duck pineapple curry was nothing to compliment.
2015-06-30,3,The food is good, however the delivery/pickup wait times are a bit excessive. On a regular weeknight, you'll have to wait approximately 45-60 mins for a pickup order. Even after we arrived, we waited at least 15 mins more to pick up just 2 entrees to go. The menu prices are a bit high, if you do pass by the restaurant they have coupon cards for online orders. I'd order here again only if I was really craving Thai..
2015-06-24,2,I ordered the chicken satay appetizers and they tasted odd. The chicken didn't taste or feel like chicken. The vegetable spring rolls lacked filling, mostly made of fried wrap. Overall disappointing. Thai tea was good but it's hard to mess that up.
2015-06-22,5,My favorite Thai place in Hoboken. I order their pad thai every time. Delivery is quick and the food is good. Prices are very reasonable and won't break your pockets. I will continue ordering from here.
2015-06-21,5,Great place, I like the seafood here, seafood Tom Yom rice noodle soup is delicious! They also open on Sundays. Excellence choice for lunch!
2015-06-17,2,Delivery was timely and the food had good flavor/potential but was ultimately waaaaay too sweet. Pad Thai tasted like I was eating dessert. I may be biased because I'm not a sweets person in general but I've never had Thai food that tastes so syrupy sweet. Hard pass on this place.
2015-04-24,3,Its a small restaurant. Decor is okay. Food is ok but I wish the amount of food each dish can be a little bit of more. I had a takeout and i was a little bit off disappointed of the size. Then I had another take out in a Thai restaurant called spice in nyc and i was so amazed of their difference.
2015-04-11,4,I'm from Seattle, so I know my Thai.  The food is consistently good to very good at T Thai, which is why I eat here at least once a week and have tried and ruled out every other Thai restaurant in Hoboken.  I've eaten Tom Yum soup at more than 50 restaurants in the US and Asia, and I consider it to be the best I've had--the criticism of it in other reviews surprised me enough to offer a dissent.
2015-03-07,2,Worst place for delivery!! Over an hour and 30 mins for an order, and when confronted we were hung up on! Rude staff that just lies!
2015-02-28,4,Tried their lunch special .... It's for 7.50... You get salad spring roll and your entree... We tried the chicken glass noodles and spicy chicken noodles both were good
2015-02-07,4,Ordered thai curries for delivery. The delivery was quick and the food was reasonably good. Will order again.
2015-01-13,4,Love T Thai! Can never go wrong with their Pad Thai. I always get either shrimp or beef. They definitely give more than enough(at last for me). The only downfall I would say with the shrimp Pad Thai is that they only give you 3 pieces of shrimp. Another favorite if mine is their pineapple fried rice. As for an appetizer, I usually get fried calamari. Very crispy and the dipping sauce goes well with it. Love the Thai ice tea! Just wish the glass was bigger lol and for dessert... mango sticky rice!
2014-12-30,4,Grabbed pickup here on a Thursday night after work. Parking situation wasn't ideal but, hey, its Hoboken. Food was ready and waiting and still warm. Portions are a good size (I was able to make two meals out of it). I got the Pad Thai which was pretty good. My only gripe is that I asked for it to be a little spicy (which was definitely acknowledged as it was handwritten on my order tag) but it there was no such addition. The dish was definitely sweet, no "kick" to speak of, but not bad - just depends on preference. I will probably go back but maybe not for that particular dish.
2014-12-08,4,Was looking for a new Thai place since other places in Hoboken have been pretty inconsistent and this place seems to fill the void. We started with the Chicken Skewers and then ordered the Green Curry and the Glass Noodles for our main course. All three dishes were above average and we look forward to future visits to explore the menu a bit more.
2014-12-05,2,I miss New York. There are so many amazing Thai restaurants just across the Hudson. Sadly, this place is not so great. I tried the pad thai, hoping that it would be good because, come on, how hard is it to mess up pad thai? Well, it was just okay.  Hoboken really needs some better Thai food!
2014-10-13,4,Solid place for a delicious quick meal. BYOB and the entrees are like 10 bucks each. You will not be disappointed by this cool little spot. If this place was open at 2am I would be a happier person on the weekends!  I will be back.
2014-09-27,4,The pad see ew is decent as are the curries. One thing I will say is the tofu is served in huge pieces and it doesn't seem like they take any time to cook it, kind of just heated up with the curry. Have gotten the massaman and it's been a little greasy but the green and panang we're good. Aside from their tofu it's pretty good and the only place I would get Thai from in Hoboken aside from Sri Thai. I would say three and a half stars but I'll go with 4
2014-09-26,3,My husband and I like trying new places. Tonight we felt like having Thai. I picked the First place that seem appealing. First time! The food was good a little on the salty side. Food took a little longer than usual, took our order then took forever to get our food out then brought the appetizer with our dinner. Didn't like that too much. Perhaps there lack of service was the business hrs. We were there 1hr before closing. Nonetheless we are willing to check out the place again, after all the menu was priced right.
2014-09-23,5,Best Thai I have had hands down. Not too oily, portions are generous, staff is courteous. My co-workers and I always have left-overs for dinner because lunch special comes with salad and a roll. The prices are great so we love coming back at least once a month for friday lunches.I might add that the entire table usually gets some sort of pad thai, but not much else, but I can tell you it's delicious!
2014-09-11,4,My go to Thai place. Pad thai is excellent. Unfortunately, have not tried much else on the menu. A few other items, but nothing that stood out like the pad thai does. Looking forward to sitting down to eat there, since it is BYOB.
2014-08-20,3,An okay Thai place. With not many Thai places around this is one of the places to go. Thai ice tea was good. Tom yum soup had nice flavor. Pad Thai noodles is too sweet, wish they can make it much more authentic and throw less sugar. Guess other folks who rave about it have a good sweet tooth. The spicy seafood fried rice was decent. Verdict - just another mediocre Thai place.
2014-08-20,4,Quality delicious Thai cuisine.  Tom yum soup was spot on.  I ordered the special which was jumbo shrimp and asparagus in a red curry sauce.  Shrimp were perfectly cooked and the curry had just the right amount of heat.  A friend ordered the crispy duck with mango salad and it was delicious.  Lychee juice was delicious, as was the Thai iced tea.  I would recommend this place to everyone.  Make sure to BYOB!!!
2014-08-14,3,The lunch special is a good price at $7.50 for a salad with peanut sauce, small egg roll, and an entree. I had both the pad thai and spicy fried noodles. In both instances, the dishes were too sweet for me.
2014-08-06,5,Big fan of T Thai, I tried lot of thai restaurants near by, so far I found it the best of the lot. Its a BYOB restaurant.Service: friendly, fastTiming: lunch @ $7.5 till 4pm Happy hour: 4pm to 7pm they offer you some combo deals. Dinner: 7pm to 10pmFood: So far tried 5 kinds of entries, Pad Thai, Crab meat fried rice & Spicy fried rice. And seriously its like I am having food at Thailand. I repeated some of the items and found consistency! Love thai iced tea.Quantity: Perfect for me ;-)Cards: They accept Amex! BUT they only deliver within Hoboken although I stay stone throw away from T Thai :-( :-(This is a MUST try!!
2014-07-28,2,Although the food was good at the time, my sister in law and I both had a terrible food poisoning experience even though we had two different entrees.  We had shrimp for appetizer, she had pad thai and I had the special frog legs.  We both were terribly sick later on in the night.  The service was good.
2014-07-27,5,Very reasonable prices and outstanding flavor.  The spicy noodles with chicken are great every time and the staff is friendly. Great lunch specials and large portions.  This place is always difficult to pass up.
2014-07-23,3,Chicken Pad Thai OK... A little on the bland side until I requested some of their chili paste... Thai tea was great.. I wish the glass was much bigger..:) overall it was OK...
2014-07-20,5,I love T Thai! Amazing lunch special - their chicken pad Thai has me spoiled - it's never nearly as good anywhere else.
2014-07-12,5,I have to admit I was never a big fan of Thai food. I started by trying chicken pad Thai during college and was hooked. T Thai has always been able to satisfy my craving whenever it pops up. I feel confident in saying it's the best Thai food in Hoboken! I can't wait to try some of their other dishes.
2014-07-10,4,Love their Chicken Pad Thai.  My friends and I come here once every two weeks or so and we love this place.  It's been a little warm inside these days but not something completely unbearable.  I've tried their crab fried rice too and that was tasty.  Also their calamari is okay, I liked it more for the sauce they served with it, a sweet/spicy chili sauce.  The last time my friends and I went we think they ran out of bean sprouts which was fine by me but I feel like they should mention that they're subbing lettuce in for bean sprouts.  I didn't think it was a huge issue though.  The music gets a little wonky in here, I think someone uses their ipod to DJ.  Still doesn't mess with the experience though.
2014-06-23,1,I wanted to give this place a good review because the food was initially good. Unfortunately, the extremely rude wait staff ruined the experience for me. Not just out waitress but even the people who came to drop off our food.But the worst thing, we found a bug in our dish (horrible to begin with but we're vegetarians so really the worst) and all we got was a haphazardly thrown out sorry as out waitress walked away. They weren't even busy, but she couldn't bother to give us the time of day.Needless to say, I will never return.
2014-06-15,3,Pretty mediocre. Ordered chicken with mixed vegetables and jasmine rice. Pretty standard affair, not too special about this place.  Ordered takeout which came quickly and the delivery person was nice and efficient.  Might try it again, but there are better Thai places in Hoboken.
2014-05-21,3,Just had some delicious pad thai, masaman curry and thai basil. Food was excellant but they have increased the prices and the portion sizes are much smaller - disappointed about that
2014-05-16,4,Big fan of their chicken pad thai. I've tried four different places for pad thai in Hoboken and this place is still my tried and true. Delivery time is varied. Sometimes they're quick and sometimes you're starving by the time they show up.
2014-05-03,4,this is the best of the thai options in hoboken. they have a decent lunch special. their pad woon sen is my favorite (clear noodles) their pad thai is a bit too sweet but it does the trick. curries are good too. I've always wanted to try the frogs legs but was too scared!
2014-04-29,4,This is my go-to Thai restaurant in Hoboken. My personal favorites are the red curry and green curry- VERY flavorful and creamy. The Pad Thai is also very good here and the portions are decent for the price.BYO is a plus and you can usually get a table on a Friday or Saturday night without a problem.
2014-04-25,4,Basil with shrimp is very tasty.  It gets crowded during lunch as there are not many tables.
2014-04-23,4,I'd give T Thai a 3.5 stars but the great service pushes it up to 4 stars. I came in for a quick dinner as I didn't want to wait long for delivery at 8:30pm and there was basically no one there. It appeared busy nonetheless due to delivery orders.I ordered beef pad kee mao and a Thai iced tea. The Thai iced tea came out almost immediately. It was what I expected but could've used less ice.The beef pad kee mao was awesome! There was just enough spice and the veggies were really fresh (ie cabbage, basil, carrots, peppers). I'd definitely order this dish again!The restaurant has about 30 seats and is nice and quaint. The lighting is relatively dark but not too dark where you can't read the menu.
2014-04-17,4,Delicious thai food for a great price. Byob is a plus . The place is more set up for take out but worth sitting down for a good meal. I had the curry chicken with peanuts , absolutely awesome. Highly recommend the Tom yum soup, it's spicy but out of this world .
2014-04-14,4,Great little Thai place located in lower Hoboken, They don't really have much of a sign though so definitely go by Yelp when you're looking for the place as the name can be hard to read especially at night.I been here a few times and the food I got were always pretty decent. The prices are on the lower side as well especially during lunch hours that they have even on weekends. And its close to the waterfront and Path so on a nice day can just have a small picnic outside as they do get sort of busy as the weather gets warmer plus its a small restaurant. Overall though this is a really nice and authentic Thai restaurant in the area. Definitely recommend it if you're a fan of Thai foods.
2014-03-25,3,Actually tasty but this is clearly a take out or delivery place. I was the only one in the restaurant and was basically ignored.  Seriously, ignored. Papaya salad was good. Chili basil chicken was excellent with brown rice. So, if you want a truly solo experience with really bad music, come ahead. If not, get their take out menu and enjoy some very good Thai while watching TV in the comfort of your own home.
2014-03-23,5,TTTTT THAIIIIII, I love you! Seriously, this place is under rated. I've come to the point where I'm here at least once a week or every other week. Why you ask?! Well let's start with this, their food is great! I always get the tom yum soup, its a spicy, lemongrass shrimp and mushroom soup. About two pieces of shrimp and if your feeling a little under the weather this will give you that boost you need. I then get the chili basil chicken. Holy smokes, this entree is mouthwatering. A little spicy but full of amazing flavor. I don't like their noodle dishes here sadly, but the entrees makes up for it and some. Also, their strawberry and sticky rice dessert is so good. It's light, satisfying, and delicious. The thing that makes T Thai even better is that they are consistent!! Their spice level is the same, your entree will taste the same and the service is great (a little slow but who cares, enjoy life a little).
2014-03-23,4,Just moved to hoboken under a month ago, haven't experienced any other thai place in Hoboken, but after many reviews on yelp compared to the other places my gf and i chose this place.Woman on phone was hard to understand but set the expectation of 45 min for delivery.  We were expecting to wait closer to 60-90 minutes, but they hit their target, and the food came hot! Wow. NO issues with the food at all, we ordered chicken satay, chicken pad thai, and a beef w chili basil sauce. All was properly in their containers, all were made to order and tasted delicious.  Wasn't the best thai I've ever had which is why I gave it 4 stars but certainly hit all spots if your in the mood for THAI and you're in hoboken.  Will def order from here next time we want thai....no need to adventure elsewhere and try others.
2014-03-23,3,About the food, it is good in this area. I got my pick-up food last time, my curry was leaking all over in the bag and on other containers. I had just a little bit curry sauce left in the bottom. Compare to the price that we pay for food, they supposed to use more secure packages or containers.
2014-03-19,4,Omg - just tried the sautéed glass noodles - delicious!   Will definitely be back.   I only ordered take out because of my job.   But the place is cute and small and usually a line during peak dinner time.  Definitely worth a try for those who like thai food.  When I try the rest of the menu,  will add more comments :-)
2014-02-25,5,Best pad Thai in Hoboken! Tip: order it with the fried duck, amazing! Place is BYO too!
2014-02-19,5,This place is not pricey but serve great food! If you want a fast meal for lunch, I definitely recommend this place. The staff is very friendly and BYOB is great. I love their lunch specials and early bird specials. I always order their Shrimp Pad Thai and its amazing every time. For desert I recommend their fried ice-cream. Their food come out fairly quickly.
2014-01-09,4,Love T Thai! The tom kha soup with coconut rice and then the sautéed glass noodles with tofu is by far my favorite meal. I order once a week. The pad Thai is also very good! I recommend you try T Thai!
2013-12-21,2,We ordered three dishes from Seamless.  Chicken pad Thai, green curry chicken, and sauteed mixed vegetable with chicken. The pad thai and curry were fine but nothing special. The mixed vegetables with  chicken was the size of a side dish and they forgot to include the rice. Won't be ordering from here again.
2013-11-30,3,Ambience is quite normal but the staff is friendly and the food is good for the options available for thai food in Hoboken
2013-09-21,4,One of the finest thai restaurants in new jersey. Thai iced tea here was amazing apart from regular dishes. Ambience and quality of service is amazing too.
2013-09-04,4,Excellent lunch valueFantastic portions and flavorsService is well above par Been coming here for years and will continue
2013-08-28,2,My roommate and I have been searching for a good thai restaurant in Hoboken for a while and thought this would be the one due to the positive reviews. Unfortunately, our food was tasteless and salty. We ordered the Red Curry and Peanut Curry as well as the Tom Kha soup. Both curry's barely had flavor and the soup was WAY TOO SALTY. Will never go back and won't recommend to anyone. Try Satay Malaysian if you are open to a slightly different menu- the menu is so big (malaysian and chinese options) and they never, ever disappoint (only wanted to try T Thai to get Red Curry since Satay doesn't have a Thai version of it).
2013-07-10,4,I have tried every lunch special , since I work half a block away. All are above average, both in quality and value. My favorites are masaman curry and pad see ew.  The green curry is also solid. The pad thai is a bit sweet for me but it's high quality. I appreciate that they serve the food very quickly during lunch and make it to order (ie spicy, or extra veggies etc). It always tastes fresh and well cooked. I don't give this place 5 stars because it did not blow me away. But it is very good thai food, and the prices are reasonable. One of my favorite lunch joints in this part of Hoboken.
2013-06-26,4,Better than average food.  Great location... near everything,  but quieter.  Outside tables are nice in fine weather.  I like the courteous service and good value for the money.  Very competitive  Hoboken lunch special.  BYOB is a huge advantage here, a nice riesling or vinho verde would be perfect.  All in all, very nice reliable thai, especially for the money.
2013-05-31,4,The green curry is so so good.  Perfect flavor especially over the coconut rice.  Have been there numerous times for lunch and a couple of times for dinner.  Great experience every time - especially the consistency of the food.  Service is very good.  The lunch specials are one of the best buys in Hoboken and you always walk out full.
2013-05-25,4,I've been coming here for over a year now at least once a week for lunch, the price is unbeatable, meal sizes are big I never walk out without a "to go bag" and pretty much ate myself through the whole lunch menu, everything is good. My fave is the Pat Thai (extra spicy) Great place!!!
2013-05-23,5,My friends & I had a Mother's Day lunch... Ordered fried frog legs, soft shell crab salad, mango salad, fried whole snapper & summer roll.. Everything was fantastic.... So yummy.... The service was attentive.. We were happy & will come back..
2013-05-21,4,Thai was pretty good here but not very spicy. Service was attentive and food came out relatively quick. We ordered the chicken peanut curry and the massaman curry beef. Both were yummy.
2013-05-13,1,Ordered Shrimp Pad Thai.  Shrimp and the Pad Thai are placed next to each other in the plate -- the chef didn't even bother to mix them together.  Shrimp is undercooked, egg in the pad Thai is definitely overcooked, and the pad Thai itself is unbearably sweet... I am a huge Thai food fan but will never come again.
2013-05-12,4,I feel hesitant about submitting a review after just one meal, and a lunch special at that. An update will follow for sure if needed. So this place is just 2 blocks from my (new) place of work but I have usually skipped it for the Malaysian place nearby that I already knew about and ordered delivery from regularly.  I ordered a Masaman curry beef and my lunchmate ordered beef in basil sauce , both lunch specials.  The lunch specials came with a small starter salad and spring roll, and both were decent. My masaman curry, ordered spicier than normal, was great.  The basil sauce dish also looked tasty.  Both dishes were well presented and the interior and exterior seating areas were also nice, thought to me, the food itself is the main consideration.  I'll be back for sure as it is a $7.50 lunch 2 minutes from my office.  I hope it becomes a go-to spot.
2013-05-03,5,This is the best Thai food I have tasted outside of Thailand! After spending a month in Thailand last summer, nothing I had in the U.S. ever came close, until this. The pad thai was absolutely perfect, the peanut curry was sublime, and the mango sticky rice was a contender for the best I've ever tasted. T Thai is such a gem. Wonderful food, unbeatable prices, and very quick and courteous service. I cannot recommend it highly enough!
2013-04-30,4,Lunch for $7.50?  Sold!  (a little extra for beef, shrimp, or squid though)I absolutely loved the spicy noodles, but then again I think spicy things are awesome.  You also get a salad and an egg roll with peanut sauce too.  It is good for groups and for many of my friend T Thai is a lunch standard.
2013-04-14,1,I called to see if my food left yet, because I realized I either needed change for a big bill or had to put it on my debit card.  She said it had left, but would take my credit card.  20 minutes later my food had not arrived.  Mind you, I'm 4 blocks away... So I called...  a few more minutes the guy arrived with my cold food.  I called to let them know it was cold and she didn't care.  She said she was sorry , and I said it would probably be the last time I ordered from there.  She said ok, like she had no desire to win my buisiness back.  Bad business .  Will not order here again.  Besides, not only were the steamed dumplings cold, they were terrible and skimpy.  I like my normal Thai place and would have ordered but wasn't at home, and it's another neighborhood.
2013-02-11,3,Ordered takeout for the first time, and it was pretty good.  It was a pleasant surprise that the food was a bit spicier than some other Thai places who seem to tone down the spiciness for an American pallette.  Bring on the heat!The red curry chicken had very good flavor but it was mostly bamboo shoots and we would have liked to have seen more (and larger) pieces of chicken.  The beef with chili basil sauce was delicious and spicy, with an ample amount of beef, but the beef was just slightly rubbery (which is the case in many asian beef dishes).  Very good though.The chicken Pad Thai was a well-thought-out dish that had a good balance of sweet and peanutty flavors.  Pad Thai is usually kind of on the border between meal and side dish, but theirs was presented a bit more like a meal, with some sprouts on the side (instead of mixed in) and even a slice of lime.  Nice touch.You get considerably less food here than most other places, which was slightly disappointing, especially since the food was tasty and we would have liked more leftovers.  That being said, we would order from here again since we enjoyed the food overall.
2013-01-28,2,This place is mediocre at best. I got the Tom Kha soup and it was awful but the Pad Thai was okay. Only Thai place I've tried in Hoboken so far but I definitely wouldn't recommend it.
2013-01-18,4,ive only ever ordered delivery from here, but its always been very good. the food always arrives on time and is steaming hot! the red curry is my favorite. the portions are generous and it hits the spot when you want some thai food, and quick!
2013-01-16,4,The portions are generous and the food is great!, great happy hour prices. BYOB.
2013-01-12,4,Great food.  My go to Thai place in Hoboken, even though it's probably the furthest from me.  The spicy noodle is always right on.  I order weekly but I have to note that the staff leaves something to be desired.  Just seems like your bothering them by showing up or ordering takeout.  Showing up a half hour before they close on a Friday night is not acceptable.
2012-12-11,4,Solid Thai with perfect lunch menu. For lunch I like the Thai fried rice, basil sauce and glass noodles are good too.You always get a salad with a tiny spring roll as a starter. I love that peanut salad sauce.
2012-08-15,1,I really hate writing bad reviews especially of a restaurant that has served my husband and I so many times.Unfortunately, my husband stopped to pick up lunch yesterday and while sitting at the table by the register noticed a bug come by and upon closer inspection it was a roach. He got up and walked over to the counter only to find another in a bucket by there. Then another woman had one on her leg while she was eating her meal.That is that, they obviously have a cleanliness problem and unfortunately we will not be dining there again.Update as of 9/24/2012 -- apparently still has the roach issue as a coworker of my husband encountered one during her lunch yesterday! T-Thai clean up your place!
2012-08-11,1,Probably the worst Thai food I've had. Service was pathetic. Our food for 6 people came in staggered in over 10 minutes. Pad Thai was super sweet. Massaman was strictly ok. Never ever try their coconut juice! Ruined my friday evening.
2012-08-07,4,This is tough because I know their food is decent but I've only been able to enjoy it once. It's rather Americanized and the menu is limited but what I ordered (the chef's special with sauteed shrimp, sea scallops, and squid) was prepared well. I wouldn't call this the best Thai I've had in Hoboken but it's definitely substantially better than a lot of the other places. Casual Thai was the absolute worst and Sri Thai has been known for, well, uncleanliness to say the least. I'd like to go back and try it again but I've already experienced my favorite Thai in Hoboken (it's the Aroy-D Thai Elephant Truck... phenomenal and incredibly authentic)However, once it gets cold out and I'd want to eat indoors again... i'm sure we'll be hitting up T Thai whenever we crave a simple pad thai and spicy coconut soup.
2012-08-06,4,I've been here so many times since my last review and 3 stars just doesn't do it justice.  I absolutely enjoy eating at this place.  Go for some unconventional Thai food!
2012-06-03,3,This was tough.  I want to give this 2 stars but 1) I know others who swear by this place and 2) there was one dish that was, as my lovely boyfriend would say, BANGIN'.Aaaand that would be the coconut chicken soup.  Sounds a little weird but is phenomenal.  The coconut milk is smooth, the chicken and its broth are salty, and there's a little hint of lemongrass and spice that made me want to finish the whole bowl (I was supposed to just have a taste because he ordered it, not me)!The negatives:  I get pretty angry when I'm looking at the menu and a waiter or waitress asks me if I'm ready to order.  I get even angrier when they do the same thing twice in two minutes.  The place wasn't packed or anything - why be pushy?The salad was decent but there wasn't much to the peanut dressing.  The spring roll tasted like it had no filling inside.  My pad thai was so sweet that I almost couldn't eat it, and the sauce seemed to have some kind of wine or other ingredient that I felt in my throat as I ate.  I hate being a picky diner, but I'm not sure what was going on in that dish.  However, his spicy beef with veggies was pretty good.  Somehow he always lucks out!Anyway, I'm granting this place 3 stars for one more reason - it's BYOB.  I'll go back since my friends love this place, but I will not be ordering the pad thai again, no siree bob!
2012-05-06,3,Okay, after a dozen more tries, I get what T Thai is all about.  This is an Americanized Thai food joint with a limited menu. What to order:Shrimp peanut curryThat's about it. If you want fried food, the calamari is good, as are the cheese puffs (they are literally american or cheddar cheese in a fried flakey puff) with spicy mayo. I've never done anything but delivery and have never had a problem.  T Thai beats out most other options in Hoboken. Sri Thai is my go-to in town but when I want thai food on a Tuesday when they're closed, these guys are a decent option.
2012-02-26,4,Yummy. Fast. Convenient. Reliable delivery. I very much appreciate that the food tastes fresh and never greasy. This has become a weekly go-to for us.
2012-02-01,5,Yum I love this place. I recommend the Panang Curry, it is SO DELICIOUS and every time I have ordered delivery, it always comes quickly and warm and I always end up craving it the rest of the week. It is less expensive than a lot of the other Thai places and they always answer the phone and are courteous. The last time I was craving Thai food I wanted to try another Thai place because I had seen good reviews and I wanted to broaden my horizons so I called the other THai restaurant on Bloomfield street (I can't think of the name @ the moment) but they never even answered their phone and a few times there was a dial tone like they were just hanging up the phone. WOW thanks. Anyways I decided to stick with what I know and like and ordered from T Thai on Hudson street and wasn't disappointed at all! This is my thai place!
2012-01-28,1,Food is only mediocre. Friend got sick after eating a bad shrimp. We had told the staff that it was bad and they had replaced it but gave no remorse about serving us spoiled food. Red curry is watered down and duck pad Thai is painfully plain. Tom yum soup is probably the only dish I enjoyed and even then I would say that the soup was also just average. Save your money and go to the Malaysian restaurant down the street.
2012-01-18,5,Food was excellent, great place for a group (they let us rent most of the space for a party). Service great.  BYOB so it worked out well for us.  Prices reasonable, and the food fresh and very good.
2012-01-14,4,having lived in NYC and patroned many Thai places, I was actually pleasantly surprised at how good T Thai was. It beats Sri Thai and other ones people raved about. I'm sure like any other restaurant, it has good and not so great days. I had the calamari, Steak salad to perfection, the pad thai with shrimp was particularly good that night, mildly sweet, and REAL pad thai noodles. Ice tea was just the right amount of condensed milk. The decor, however, is a bit depressing, with the dark maroon walls. From the outside it can look a bit discouraging. Nonetheless, good service, clean and pleasant (I went with a group of friends).
2012-01-06,1,Worst delivery service ever.Was told 30 mins on the phone. The food took over 1hr and 30 mins to arrive and then the food was cold!Go elsewhere if you are looking for takeout.
2011-12-29,4,the duck pad thai and the combination fried rice are delicious.
