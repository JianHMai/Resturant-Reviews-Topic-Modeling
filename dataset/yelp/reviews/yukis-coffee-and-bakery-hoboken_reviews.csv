2021-10-12,5,Loved the pumpkin pie the crust was perfect! Can't wait to try the other pies. The chocolate looks delicious.
2021-09-04,5,It's time I leave this place a review. We have been coming here almost every weekend for their amazing pastries and coffee. So far everything we have tried (which is 90% of the menu) has been amazing. Both the savory and sweet treats are to die for. The Nutella babka is great to bring back home as an "after treat". Hands down 5 stars!
2021-08-08,5,I ordered a few items ahead to bring home for a brunch I was hosting- the focaccia, lemon pistachio cake, and the tomato and goat cheese quiche- all was absolutely delicious and devoured! Cannot wait to try other things on the menu:)
2021-07-03,5,Whoa. Stop everything right now and go to Yuki's. This place is a diamond. Everything is super fresh and made in house. We tried:Almond chocolate croissant - A+ get itChocolate rugalach - Sooooo delicious and chocolatey Egg feta - A+ so good. Cheesy salty feta with egg on fresh bread. Wow so much yes going on. Fresh feta.Fresh pita bread - so soft and puffyWe forgot the name of the cookie we ordered but it was super soft cookie with some sort of caramel in the middle - very delicious!We also ordered a potato boureka - haven't tried yet because we were so full, but apparently it's very popular. (I also love anything with potato)With our treats, we had a regular coffee and a cappuccino - both were excellent. Our only con:The prices are a little high, but it's 100% worth it. It's not really a con, because the taste and quality match the cost.We will be back to try the challah and babka! (And will mostly be back again and again for more.)
2021-06-29,4,Stopped by Monday afternoon and was greeted so nicely by a beautiful selection of homemade treats and a very nice young girl behind the counter. I was specifically there to try the chocolate rugelach ($2) and it did not disappoint! Delicious! I also was recommended to try the Tea cake with berries ($4.50)- I'm so sad to say it wasn't my fav, I ended up throwing most of that away although beautiful to look at it was very dry. Next time I think I'll go with bread pudding slice, looked delicious! I'm looking forward to going back and trying other items! So glad to have this bakery in the area!
2021-06-09,5,Absolutely love Yuki's.  The staff is super friendly and helpful and the baked goods are amazing.  So for I've tried both the Babka and Rugelach which were home runs.  Highly recommend.
2021-05-31,3,First time there. Very nice and attentive staff. I chose the dark chocolate and pistachio babka. They said that they are known for the babkas. Sadly, the babka was quite dry and a bit bland. I was a bit surprised about this, especially for $17.
2021-05-28,5,I'm so excited to find an Israeli bakery right by my apartment! The shop is so cute and quaint, the staff is so friendly and the variety of baked goods are so delicious and fresh! Dangerous that this is 400 feet away from where I live, but super excited about it :). Will be back often!
2021-05-22,5,I went here last week and I love this bakery!! It's tucked in the back corner of Hoboken close to the 9th street light rail station. This place has a wide variety of coffees and baked goods. I went there early in the morning and it was fresh baked! I wish I could've tried everything. I ordered a classic macchiato. It was a no nonsense type drink. Hit the spot and very authentic (not the big coffee chain type but a small cup. Very authentic) Pros: -they are open from early in the morning to early evening well after other coffee shops are closed. Most other places close around 3 but I can count on them to be open when I need caffeine. -location close to the light rail is great! Not too many coffee shops operate around this area so it's nice that such a quality place is here-everything seems fresh baked and there are a lot of baked options from croissants to moreCons: I can't really think of any. The place is fantastic and I will definitely be returning.
2021-05-06,5,Love this cute little cafe! Everything is DELICIOUS from the chocolate rugelach to the tomato focaccia and even the drinks. Highly recommend the pain au chocolat - it is perfectly buttery and flakey, if you're lucky enough to get one while it's still warm - WOW you're in for a treat.  Yuki is super friendly (as are everyone else who works there), you'll definitely be back many times to support this small business :)
2021-04-15,5,I just discovered YUKI bakery and I already tried different items, Borek, bourekas, ruggulach, babka. All are amazing, and you can "taste" the care given to each one. I come for France where the standard is high when it comes to breads and pastries, and Yuki is totally on that high level. I didn't tase them yet, but just from the look of them, I can figure that the croissants and pains au chocolat are definitively of the French standards. What a treat to heave such a great bakery in Hoboken, on Monroe St; I will definitely be back!!!
2021-04-11,5,So happy to have this adorable bakery in the area! The store front is very welcoming and the inside smells like delicious baked goods. You HAVE to try an alfajore cookie, they're to die for!! I wanted to post a picture of the cookies but couldn't resist eating them immediately. I would definitely recommend stopping in for some coffee and dessert!
2021-04-05,5,I ordered the Passover Pistachio Lemon Cake and my whole family really enjoyed it as it was such a nice change from the usual Passover desserts we have. I'm so glad this bakery has opened and I can't wait to try their challah.
2021-03-29,5,I never write reviews but I just wanted to share that was The best cake I ever had in my life, I swear! The praline lemon cake.  Thank you Yuki!
2021-03-26,5,Went last week for some pastries...all were incredibly delish. The loaf of dark chocolate/pistachio babka we got had just come out of the oven and we nearly ate the entire thing on our walk home. Will be back earlier in the morning to try stuff they had sold out of!
2021-03-25,5,Challah and Babka were perfect. A very nice addition to Hoboken. Will definitely be back.
2021-03-24,4,I was very excited to see an Israeli bakery open in Hoboken, though, sadly, on the weekend afternoon I visited they were already sold out of the challah, babka, and other delicacies I had been eager to try.  However, I could not just walk away, so instead, I decided to try their versions of more mainstream treats.  Their Brownies were as buttery and fudge-like as the man behind the counter had said.  The Chocolate Chip Cookies stayed soft for days and were infused with large chunks of rich, dark chocolate.  Both of the pastries were great, but I am eager to return and try their ethnic specialties.
2021-03-20,5,YUM! We got the spinach and cheese boureka, potato boureka, and chocolate and date rugelach, and they are tasted like they were from the Israeli shuk. We also got a cappuccino and a cold brew, both great! There is also a park right around the corner where you can hang out and eat your delicious pastries. I'm not sure if they deliver in Hoboken, but if they did we would definitely be ordering some challahs and babkas for Shabbat :)
2021-03-16,5,I've been waiting for Yuki's Bakery to open for such a long time, and finally today - it happened! Everything seemed so yummy and smelled so good (even through a two layer mask ), the coffee, the freshly baked pastries... Since it was early morning and I was on the go I decided to start with a burek with cheese and spinach and a cappuccino- @ Yuki's they are serving Counter Culture Coffee which I love! Coffee was very well made and the burek was amazing! Can't wait to go back to enjoy more and to support our new community small business!
