2021-10-12,5,Absolutely love this place. I moved too far to order delivery but everytime I'm in Hoboken I have to stop by! Amazing food and Great staff. Wish I could give it 10 stars
2021-09-14,1,The guy is very rude. First of all. I have to say that. Secondly. Nothing ordered was amazing. It was all basic. I was not impressed by any of it. Everyone you call this business the guy answering the phone always talks like you are bothering him. So never even ask for anything to be done to you food like no cheese or home fries well done. I was disappointed. Won't be going back.
2021-08-04,5,Delicious pasta vodka, and their take out specials are perfect. Never been to the actual restaurant but an avid online ordered.
2021-06-18,5,Love love love this place. Is usually our go-to takeout place whenever we can't decide on dinner or lunch. It's quick and easy and everything we've had is great. Good sandwiches and paninis and convenient walk for pickup ... a hidden gem on Washington. I've seen people eating outside occasionally with bottles of wine.
2021-06-07,5,First time dining in at Gigi's since Covid and boy did I miss it!! Service was amazing and I got my food so quickly! I ordered a sandwich I saw on their Instagram which consisted of eggplant, mozzarella, and sun-dried tomatoes! The eggplant here is THE BOMB!!! Thank you gigis
2021-06-07,1,Absolutely the worst. The food is mediocre at best, but the service is hot garbage. Multiple times I've went to pick up my uber order which wasn't ready. The rude staff asks for the order number, I show them the app, then they huddle, tell me the order never came it, then suddenly print the order ticket and tell me I have to wait. I ask them to cancel as I can't wait and they get really rude.I'd give this place negative stars if I could. Never again. If the food was actually really good I could possibly overlook the service but even at a michelin restarurant you wouldn't expect to be treated like this.Pure trash...
2021-05-02,5,Staff- 10/10Food-10/10Everyone is the best that works there! Breakfast lunch dinner all so good and huge portions. Caesar salad is amazing, salmon with two sides, etc. EGG and cheeses are also amazing. dying to try their banana bread pudding
2021-04-24,5,Have tried the lunch sandwiches only, and they are great.  The pork and brie is my favorite.  Quick and high quality food.
2021-04-11,5,Just had my daughter's first birthday party with family catered by Rosticeria Da Gigi and they did not disappoint!   The food was delicious and packed up perfectly.  The sandwich trays were enormous and so good!  All of our family loved the food.
2021-04-08,5,Roast pork with apple butter sandwich should be self-explanatory. I was scrolling Uber and originally thinking I was overdue for a vegetable-only night until I saw this item. Maybe tomorrow? But I'd trust Rosticeria Da Gigi even in lower calorie brackets based on the fine repeat performance of the broccoli rabe.
2021-04-05,4,The chicken parm was very tasty, and the portion size was quite generous. The chicken breast was fresh and well-seasoned, topped with a chewy layer of cheese. There was just the right amount of marinara sauce for the chicken and penne pasta.The breading and pasta were a little more mushy than I'd have liked, but it's likely unavoidable when ordering delivery. By those standards everything was really good.
2021-03-30,5,Amazing food. Great place for lunch or dinner. Simple clean quality food. So fresh. If I was catering a party this would be my go to place. Keep up the good work
2021-03-28,4,This is a place I order from on Uber eats. They always seem to have a deal going on for "BOGO". The prices are reasonable . The food is good and the portions are okay. I usually get orange juice, blueberry muffins and a type of breakfast sandwich that's the sandwich for the week.
2021-03-06,4,Get simple food spot! Nothing too fancy, but the quality of the food is definitely there. There are so many healthy options too! I'm in love with all of the options for side dishes. I also love the broiled salmon and roast chicken. The chickpea salad side is my favorite
2021-02-02,5,One of my favorites in Hoboken. Louie is the bomb! This guy will make you Anything you want, even if it's not on the menu, and it will be delicious. Great portions. His girls are great, all friendly and attentive. Highly recommend for hearty and very good food! Thank you guys!
2021-01-08,4,Rainy Saturday night, looking for something quick for takeout. This spot thankfully had a few minutes left open and had no problems with me placing an order.Despite the plethora of options, kept it simple with a Chicken Cutlet/Mozzarella/Sun dried Tomato Sandwich ($11). Food comes out within five minutes - a massive hero with all the aforementioned ingredients layered together (and some leafy greens). Overall the sandwich is hearty and the flavors come out well. Cheese is fresh and the tomatoes were a nice add-on. Chicken itself could have been thicker, and the bread is almost stale. Otherwise, a solid meal from a quick takeout place.Considering the options here, would make another stop-by when in town.
2020-11-22,5,Ordered delivery from here. Well priced and delicious home style food! So glad to have read about this place through a local Facebook group. We ordered the chicken parm, meatballs and veal. Everything was delicious and generous portions, definitely adding this place to the rotation.
2020-10-18,4,A casual breakfast and brunch food place, open late. Very friendly staff and tasty eats. Sausage omelette with home style potatoes were perfectly satisfying, and their buttermilk pancakes have gained some local fame as the best in the area.Indoor and outdoor dining available during Covid. Front end street parking only. Enjoy!
2020-10-10,3,I guess this is a matter of opinion, but this is just about the worst sausage you could use for a breakfast sandwich, and, there was barely any on it. Didn't matter because I took it off. Otherwise, it was decent. Delivery was very fast and food was still hot so that's a bonus.
2020-10-03,4,Normally I do not leave a review after one visit. However this place rocked. The turkey sandwich with homemade mozzarella was amazing. I am a sandwich guy and this was superb. My wife had one of the fish specials. The seating is limited but the service was impeccable. An establishment that cares for the homeless and offers great food. I will be back and so should you.
2020-09-28,4,Though I had ordered breakfast delivery from Rosticeria Da Gigi several years ago, I had not reengaged with the restaurant again until recently.  We stopped there for lunch while we were walking around town, and found it the perfect spot to do just that.  The casual café was warm, inviting, and had a small dining area set-up on the sidewalk.  My boyfriend started his meal with a bowl of Chicken Noodle Soup, which contained strands of spaghetti, chunks of white meat chicken, and fresh carrots.  He found it deliciously homemade, but a tad salty.  He followed that course with a Hamburger and French fries.  The fries were well-seasoned, but could have been crispier.  He enjoyed the burger, which looked much more substantial and high quality than what I would have expected from a cute, neighborhood café.  I ordered their daily special Greek Salad, a fancier version of the original one on their regular menu.  That enhanced salad came with a ton of toppings like grilled and seasoned chicken, chickpeas, olives, feta cheese, tomatoes, roasted red peppers, and more.  Since I am someone that loves the toppings on a salad much more than the lettuce, this was perfect for me.  However, I later realized that there was supposed to be avocado included, but it had been left off. The dressing, which I believe was Green Goddess, was tangy and delicious.Rosticeria Da Gigi delighted me once again with its excellent food.  It definitely has more to offer than your standard coffeeshop or neighbor luncheonette.
2020-09-26,5,There aren't many places I give 5 stars  too but sitting here enjoying a great lunch I saw something that got me teary eyed. I was watching our waitress get a burger and a coffee for a homeless man and than inviting him to sit and enjoy a meal. It was one of the best things I have seen in a very long year of chaos, division and sad news. Restaurants and it's staff are truly remarkable people and I hope they survive this pandemic. I bow to the server who showed compassion and taught me a lesson today. Everyone matters. Thank you.
2020-09-22,5,Everything on the menu is great! The eggplant sandwich with fresh Mutz, arugula, roasted red peppers and pesto= The GOAT sandwich!
2020-09-05,2,We ordered breakfast at this place just to find they messed up our order. After  getting a refund, they messed up again giving us our sandwiches on the wrong bread and syrup with hair in it.  Food was pretty average.  Overall a little disappointing.
2020-08-22,5,Got delivery tonight of rice balls, chicken parm hero, garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli rabe. Everything was so delicious and fresh! Order also came in record time. Will definitely be ordering again!
2020-07-08,1,First time trying this place, based on the positive reviews on Yelp. Unfortunately, I had a sorely disappointing experience.Since it was my first time trying, I had asked which menu items were most popular amongst the hot plates and cold sandwiches. I was told the roasted chicken with two sides and the chicken cutlet sandwich. So I went ahead and ordered those two.Two issues: (1) it took quite some time for the items to be ready (waited a good 20-25 minutes -- mind you, this was for a 'to go' order, not delivery) (2) both the roasted chicken and the chicken cutlet sandwich were bone dry. The chicken didn't seem fresh and maybe made a day ago and reheated (...which leads me to wonder why it took so long to prepare in the first place). Honestly, chicken left out in the desert for five days would've been juicier than this one.I really wanted to like this place given the reviews (and maybe I happened to go on an off day), but I was extremely disappointed. I most likely will not be returning based on this experience.Another yelper described this place as a hit or miss. To me, this was a clear miss.
2020-07-07,5,This place is so under rated. The food is so freakin good. It's authentic home style Italian American type of food. Honestly if they revamped the menu and decor to look like a cutesy little bistro it would cleannnnn upppppp!
2020-06-03,5,Gigi is the best! So good for dining in (BYOB!), take out, and delivery. They seriously do not skimp on the portions and quality. Everything is so delicious and always cooked to perfection. Their eggplant parm is the best in Hoboken hands down.
2020-05-19,3,3.5 stars! I got the leg of lamb entree with the polenta and rice ball. The rice ball was really good and the polenta was good. The lamb was extremely underwhelming. I was expecting sliced lamb but what I got was something that looked and tasted like deli meat. I also got the cannoli for dessert it was def the highlight of my meal!
2020-02-21,5,One of the best Italian subs I've ever had! All of the ingredients were so fresh and they give you a large portion of food for a fair price.
2020-02-14,5,Always a great spot to pickup a quick sandwich at a great price. Highly recommend the Italian tuna with fresh mozzarella.
2020-01-23,4,It's been hit or miss with this place. Their pastas are great. I've also had the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich which is just so so. It's not bad but considering how many amazing bagel/ breakfast spots are around and kill the breakfast sandwich game, this place is a pass. I've also had the prosciutto sandwich which was almost not edible because the prosciutto was so firm I couldn't chew it. However, my roommate went the next day and got the same sandwich and said it was great and the meat was not nearly as tough as mine was.
2019-11-23,5,Staff is super friendly and my take out was ready in like 10 minutes , I got the chicken cutlet sandwich with fresh mozzarella , highly recommend .
2019-11-17,4,FYI - never been in the restaurant, just ordered delivery. Cheap, filling, delivers into the late hours of the night. The portion sizes are excellent. The food doesn't blow your mind but definitely satisfies whatever craving you had, and the cannolis were delicious. Recommend getting the roast beef over the leg of lamb though.
2019-10-30,2,We got uber eats from here on Sat night. Everything was utterly bland except for the chicken parm, but obviously anything with cheese is going to have flavor. Even the sweet potato was not very sweet. I didn't like the consistency either - it was mushier than any mashed sweet potato I've ever had. At least they give good portions for the cost.
2019-09-25,1,Ordered 2 hamburgers w/ fries, came w/ no toppings, small burger 2 huge buns & literally 7 French fries. Always had a pleasant experience before, so I called- Arella answered & first said sorry, we'll send a new order, then called back and said we can't do anything & will send lettuce & a tomato. What a joke!
2019-09-24,4,Ordered delivery from here tonight. Delivery was fast and everything was packed neatly. Order is correct too. I ordered an iced coffee, a cappuccino, pappardelle with chicken and Alfredo sauce, and a chicken Cobb salad. Great portion sizes for the price. The Alfredo was good. The chicken was sliced very thin reminding me of Chinese foods chicken. There are mushrooms in the Alfredo. Everything was cooked perfectly. This pappardelle pasta is FILLING! Soo worth it. The Alfredo is a little on the watery side but flavor is fine. And I wasn't happy to find some broccoli pieces in my pasta. I can't eat broccoli right now, so I just picked it out. Pasta and cappuccino arrived hot. The cappuccino is tasty but too acidic for my liking. I wouldn't get that again. I'd order other things from here again though! Yummm
2019-09-16,4,We used to order delivery a while ago and we always thought it was very good. It had been a while since our last ordered so I kind of forgot about this place. Not sure why we stopped. It was my daughter ́s birthday party last weekend and I did not feel like cooking for 40 people so I was in the market for a catering business. I never thought about them but then I read in a local FB page about how much of a success everyone had at their parties using Rosticeria Da Gigi and then I remembered. Honestly I didn ́t know they catered. I called to get an idea about what they could provide and they were very helpful and friendly while they were directing me to their website where all information was located. After getting some good pointers from them I hung up and decided to "suffer" through the website experience just to browse what they had. Well, their website is so easy and complete that I ended up placing my whole order in less than 10 minutes. I was very impressed with the user experience. The ordering process was guided by a very thorough explanation of each item. Very easy to see what you had ordered at all times and check to see if you needed more or less items to know if it was enough for all people in your party. It actually has a feature that calculates how much it would cost per person.After this, delivery. They kept me informed at all times that my order had been received, processed and ready to be delivered. They were very much on time. I was a bit worried because I placed my order to be delivered a few minutes before the party started. FOOD- Let ́s get to the important part. Lasagna was a huge hit!! I had a chance to eat some and I found it very rich and creamy. The Paninis (I think they are more focaccia bread but who cares). Amazing and still warm when they arrived. Club sandwich was filled with meat and the presentation was superb. The only thing I did not like was the chicken sandwich with mutz and sun dried tomatoes. I found it a bit dry overall. These are all comments from some of our guests and one of them was very impressed and he is 100% Sicilian!!Needless to say I was very happy with the whole experience. I will order again from them next time. I am sure of it. It wasn ́t cheap but I guess you have to pay if you want greatness.
2019-08-26,4,This tiny little place is a true gem. There is outdoor patio seating as well as a few tables inside. I strolled in Sunday morning for breakfast. There was no wait and only three other tables had diners. I had an iced black coffee. I didn't watch it get poured but however they prepared it was perfect. The coffee wasn't watered down by the ice even when I was down to the last bit. It was bitter or burnt. Just perfect. I also ordered a taylor ham, egg, & cheese on an Italian roll. And omg their Italian roll is the money maker. It was fluffy on the inside and just barely toasted on the outside so that it had a crisp bite. The grease from the fried egg soaks into the roll and slightly moistens it. It's not soggy and not dry. Needless to say, I devoured it. I'm definitely going to come back and try them out for dinner.
2019-07-09,5,Great food, good value. Portions are very generous. Their broccoli rabe is amazing. Everything was really really good and fresh
2019-06-19,1,Food is inedible. I ordered the roast turkey entree and it was submerged in gravy. The description didn't even say anything about gravy being included. Put this stuff on the side! Also the sweet potato fries- swimming in grease! So disgusting!
2019-05-02,5,Everything I've had here has been fantastic  So far I've had egg sandwiches, pasta dishes and eggplant hero.  All great!
2019-02-22,5,Just arrived for the weekend from Ohio. Breakfast is delicious, service excellent and fast. Lots of delicious looking food items in the display case. Definitely worth the stop.
2019-02-21,5,I have only ordered delivery via Seamless. Fan of their breakfasts. Usually get eggs with corned beef & French toast. Both are great. Also had their turkey club sandwich. Wonderful. Only knock I'll say is fries are unsalted and potato salad is flavorless. They could do better there. Also why can't you order potato chips - I hope they change that. Mostly everything I have tried as a meal here had been great. Also their delivery (for me) has been lightning quick - often delivered in 25-35 minutes.
2019-01-09,4,Good place to grab a quick meal. I usually grab an omelette every once in a while.Do try their homemade jelly.
2018-11-30,5,Great customer service. They had made a mistake with my delivery, not only they replaced my order but also sent a dessert along with a handwritten apology.
2018-11-25,5,This restaurant has such good food and reasonable prices, especially for the huge portions that you receive. The food is always cooked well and is ALWAYS fresh. Another thing I also like is that if there are any mistakes made they always make sure to fix them as fast as possible and make sure that the customer gets what they want. If the manager or the boss are around they always speak to the customer and try to come up with a solution, which many restaurants do not do. However, mistakes don't happen that often. Every restaurant makes mistakes sometimes, however Gigi's always makes sure to come up with a solution that works best for the customer. 10/10 recommend! The specials are to die for! The service is always very nice as well:)
2018-11-24,5,This was my first time dining in. I had the avocado toast with home fries and my Bestfriend had the grilled chicken Caesar salad. Due to the romaine recall they were able to accommodate her request with home made mix greens and iceberg lettuce. Gigi's has a very homey and comforting vibe which made us enjoy our experience. I would highly suggest coming here if you are looking to get something quick to go or to dine in with friends/family.
2018-11-24,5,Today I dined in at Gigi's with a couple of friends. This is my second time coming here and was not let down. It's a cute little restaurant that has lots of options to pick from! My friends and I all ordered omelettes and it was so delicious! The servings are big which is always a plus! The waitress was very attentive with our needs which is great with a big group of people. 10/10 would come back!
2018-11-24,1,Oops I did it again! I ordered from Gigi and once again they completely screwed up the order! My husband is on his way back with our food while my son eats alone! It's just too far off and we prefer not to eat it.We ordered:Egg White Omelet w/Bacon, Cheddar, Broccoli RabeEgg Omelet w/Bacon & SwissGrilled Ham & Cheese SandwichWe got:Egg White Omelet w/Broccoli Rabe & Swiss (no bacon?!?, wrong cheese)Egg Omelet w/Bacon & Cheddar (wrong cheese)Grilled Ham & Cheese Sandwich (wow they actually got one item right!!)I seriously don't understand what is wrong with the cook at this place??? We called back and the ticket was written correctly, it always is. But somehow when they make the food they just make something entirely different. I really just don't get itAnyone have a suggestion for good takeout omelette in Hoboken from anywhere but Gigi??
2018-11-21,1,Placed order for delivery. They never showed up. Don't answer their phone and not responding to messages. No everyone is starving and we have to wait another hour to place an order with another restaurant.
2018-10-26,5,I walked by this place for months and never stopped in until recently.  Let me tell you, they have delicious food!  A wide assortment of ready to go foods, sandwiches, cooked veggies and a lot of yummy and unique side salads.  There are healthy options available as well.  Love the salmon and quinoa salad, meatballs, chicken salad.
2018-09-19,5,Authentic Italian food is always an A+, so naturally I love this place.  I had the Italian sub which was so salty and good.But it's such a small space.  There's not enough places to sit.But if you're looking for authentic Italian food, this is a good place to go.
2018-09-07,5,Got delivery from here, arrived quickly.  Fresh, delicious Italian food, brisket is really on point.  Will definitely be exploring the rest of the menu
2018-08-22,5,Rosticeria Da Gigi is an inconspicuous deli from which most people seem to pick up food although they have some indoor seating and outdoor seating during the warmer months. I've lived by it for two years now but it's only a year ago that I ended up giving it a try. Since then I've mostly picked up food from here but also ate in for a combination of at least half a dozen times and it's yet to disappoint.The first time I had one of their special salads of the day which included spinach, blueberries, cucumbers, greek cheese along with some other ingredients. It certainly wasn't cheap but it was fresh, delicious and it managed to fill me up for a few hours. The following few times I've ordered either the eggplant parmesan (it comes with a side of your choice) or stuffed peppers (same deal with the side). Both dishes are delicious and filling and during times when I wasn't too hungry I was able to split them into two meals. The few times I ate in I found the service to be good and the waitresses to be nice. It is a very laid back place but a great place for a quick meal you don't feel like dressing up for. The consistent thing about each time I had food here is that it was fresh and tasted like they were using quality ingredients. There's no doubt I will be back.
2018-07-26,2,I have been here before and absolutely loved it, raved about it to friends and tonight I went in for the classic turkey sandwich which I've had before and loved.... but tonight, the turkey wasn't like thin sandwich meat  it was chunks of turkey with roast beef mixed in, the rolls had definitely gotten more narrow so there was hardly room for anything on the sandwich.. almost no arugula and I asked for balsamic and also got almost none and the bread was almost stale, so hard to bite and chew.. and to top it off while I was waiting for my food I heard them talking about not setting certain food places because of "bugs" I guess i'll think twice about coming back here again..
2018-07-18,5,This is one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken. Everything I've had there has been delicious. My favorite is their eggplant parm. They don't skip on the fresh mozzarella nor the portion. I also really recommend the pork and Brie panini. I've never had anything like that anywhere. It's so good
2018-07-15,5,This is my favorite restaurant in Hoboken!! The food here is amazing! You guys need to try the pasta dishes they have!
2018-07-03,1,I ordered pasta with chicken. My pasta came without the chicken, so I called and instead of them offering to resend the correct order they wanted to send just chicken. Which I was told would take an additional hour. Their ad says $2 delivery but they charge $4. So I paid $19 for pasta with sauce. Lol There are too many restaurants in the area for me to give this place my money again.
2018-06-22,1,If there were NO STAR, I would have selected that. Customer service was the worst I have ever experienced. I ordered something without peppers, apparently that is not allowed. It is not indicated anywhere on Delivery.com that a sandwich automatically comes with peppers. I called to complain, spoke to a woman who apologized and said ok we will send you a new sandwich per what you ordered. And then we received another call, from someone who said they were the owner and wanted to be sure we were satisfied. When I explained what happened he blamed me and said that is not what the options mean--very disrespectful and demeaning. And then he yelled at me saying  that he wanted "to Me to be satisfied" while simultaneously saying because I couldn't return the entire sandwich--yes, I cut it open, expecting it to be correct, even trying to deal with the error they made by picking out the peppers, then realized no, it tastes like peppers, and fed it to the dog--he said no way, we can't do anything for you. So they will take back a sandwich that was delivered and opened? What are they going to do with that? Super rude and basically the worst customer service in Hoboken. Order from any other sandwich place--as I do regularly--and your order will be correct and you will not be yelled at disrespectfully for their error.
2018-04-29,5,I've been meaning to add a review for a while. We worked with them to cater our son's baptism party and they did a phenomenal job. They were fantastic  in helping us plan what to order and how much. The delivery was exactly on time, and the food was AMAZING. Our guests kept complimenting the food and asking where it was from. We had penne vodka (theirs is my favorite), meatballs, stuffed rice balls, a sandwich tray and salad. Every single thing was fresh and delicious.
2018-04-28,5,Great home made food here. Service is so nice and I feel like I'm getting some comforting mom's cooking here. I had their chicken noodle soup when I was sick and it was the best I could find in the area. Definitely recommend this place for a casual lunch or brunch!
2018-04-09,1,I highly do not recommend ordering delivery from Rosticeria Da Gigi - there are so many reasons that this is a 1 star review. My boyfriend and I only ordered 2 sandwiches and 1 soda for dinner at 8PM, but the food took an hour to arrive to us even though we live a 10 minute drive away. I understand that restaurants can be busy and it's not always easy to deliver on time - late deliveries are forgivable if the food is good, but this was not the case at all. My sandwich (the eggplant, soppresata, mozzarella, sun dried tomato) was HORRIBLE! The bread was stale and hard to bite into - literal cardboard. The eggplant parm was SO tasteless and dry. There were barely any sundried tomatoes. The mozzarella was okay. I ended up eating the sandwich without the bread because it was that bad, but even then, I could only eat half of it. // On a more positive note... my boyfriend thought his sandwich was below average, he was not as livid as I was. Another positive note, maybe eating at the actual restaurant or ordering from the breakfast menu (which seems pretty popular) is a different story .... but I would steer clear of their delivery and don't plan on trying either of those after this experience.
2018-04-02,2,Maybe this place was hyped up too much for me but I was not impressed at all with our takeout on Sunday. I tried really hard to like it but I just couldn't.Ordered the brisket meal with two sides and I regretted it the minute I opened up my container of brisket. It was FULL of fat instead of actual meat--there was barely any meat actually. I also got the rice balls because everyone talks about them and both of my rice balls were black and completely burnt. They added the meatballs burnt side down and covered it in sauce... how convenient.  Partner got a burger (which wasn't all that bad) and got talked into ordering fries (not good to go). The tiramisu was also lacking in flavor and just tasted like a container of whipped cream.The only thing memorable thing at Gigi's was the marinara sauce that the rice balls came in. Their menu is SO extensive that it may be worth giving this place another shot but be warned...
2018-03-13,5,We are quite pleased with the food from Rosticeria Da Gigi. The Roast Chicken is excellent and is enhanced with extra gravy and cranberry sauce the we request. The broiled salmon and broiled filet of sole are also quite good.
2017-12-01,5,Great service .... nice change from regular restaurants ... had the ham egg and cheese over a delicious croissant... hash browns were truly fresh and homemade ... the ham was smoky and not processed,,, a gem of a place....we were served by Nicol ... and she was great...
2017-11-28,4,Underrated place in hoboken. Wide variety menu, fair prices and the hot pastrami sandwich rocks. Delivery also prompt
2017-11-26,5,Their tiramisu is the main reason for this 5 star review. Made in house-- it's layers are simplistic but well put. The perfect consistency of espresso soaked wafers topped with whipped mascarpone cheese with a dusting of cocoa powder truly is roller coaster for your tastebuds. Must go uptown and get some now They offer breakfast sandwiches on fresh brioche, bagels, croissants and Italian bread. Lunch options aren't limited to sandwiches they do everything from pasta to rice and meat to paninis and wraps/hero's... $15 delivery minimum  They're one of the only good "Delis" in town that's open past 6
2017-10-08,4,More like 3.5 stars. Delivery was pretty fast (I ordered at a random time Sunday afternoon). Side of meatballs was 2 huge ones, very tasty. The roast pork brie panini i expected to have apple butter based on another review but it didn't so it was terribly bland--was able to help the taste by putting some of the meatball sauce on it, then remembered i had some apple butter at home and added that to it & it worked. They really need to have something else in it otherwise it doesn't taste good. Same with patrami-swiss sandwich--they should add russian dressing or mayo or something! Plus the bread was soggy from condensation since they didn't toast it. The apple pie was tasty though also a little soggy. Overall despite the small issues I'd try other things from here in the future since the quality seems pretty good.
2017-08-07,3,I was recommended this spot by my barber as it was super close by. They offer both a breakfast and lunch menu. Their assortment of foods is very typical of a deli, I came here for breakfast however.They are a small restaurant with plenty of outside seating. They also have inside seating for those that do not want to be outside. Since I was in a rush I ordered to go and got a breakfast sandwich. The prices are pretty decent and the sandwich was solid.Overall, this place is good for a grab and go. I may make it my usual tradition to grab a breakfast sandwich after my haircut as it is close by. The food will not blow you away but the cheap prices will definitely get you full. I will definitely be back.
2017-08-05,5,My wife, 2 kids and I really didn't know what to expect as we ordered dinner here tonight.  We were literally blown away by the quality/quantity of the food, the freshness of the ingredients and the friendly/fast service.  The cost was very reasonable and we will definitely come back.  We wished we knew about this place sooner.  The menu is pretty diverse and there is a lot of flexibility in ordering sides and everything else.  Highly recommended.
2017-07-24,1,Rosticeria Da Gigi is a horrible establishment. Do not go here if you want to have good food. Only go here if you want to get ripped off. They charge $14.00 for a salad. Very poor service, very over priced, and horrible food. Do not go here
2017-07-07,5,This place far exceeded my expectations. I've lived on the same block as Rosticeria da Gigi for 3 years and it never gets old. You can pretty much get whatever you're craving and if you don't see it on the menu just ask! Everyone who works there is very nice and more than accommodating. My go to is always the eggplant parmesan. It is beyond phenomenal. Not only do you get a heaping serving of great eggplant with fresh mozzarella (non of that shredded cheese) but you also get to pick any side to accompany it. You essentially get two meals in one! So much food for an unbelievable price. I also recommend the broccoli rabe and the mozzarella garlic bread...make sure to get a side of marinara because their sauce is sooo good!
2017-06-21,5,I love Rosticeria Da Gigi! They have a diverse menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I love that they let you pick your sides for meals, and everything is quite tasty. What's even better is the staff is wonderful! You can't go wrong here!
2017-03-05,1,the food is good and  the delivery is quick but they literally can not get an order correct.  today was the last time i ordered a breakfast sandwich and it came completely wrong.  Not worth your time or patience.
2017-01-28,5,I typically only think to order from here for breakfast. However, I ordered the turkey panini the other night and I'm sad it took me this long to discover- amazing! The bread they used was out of this world delicious. Will definitely be ordering from here more often- any time of day!
2017-01-23,1,Worst carbonara ever. Never had in my life a carbonara with garlic sauce and instead of bacon another meat that had no flavor at all. Yuck!
2017-01-16,4,Rosticeria da Gigi is a small little deli/sandwich place on Washington Street. But don't let this fool you. Walking by, you wouldn't think much of it. It might be small on the outside and on the inside, but the flavor of their food is anything but small. I ordered the prosciutto and fontina panini. The prosciutto was a little chewy for my liking but it was the focaccia that it was served on, that was the real winner here. It was fresh, and perfectly toasted. I had a bite of my BF's cousin's sammie, which was chicken and sun-dried tomatoes on the focaccia, and I instantly regretted not ordering that one instead. He ordered the chicken parm dinner, which came with a side of pasta. Everything was average but it was the mozzarella cheese that really won me over. I feel like I could go in there and just order a few balls of that for lunch, if only that was socially acceptable.Trying to get to Hoboken's Mutzfest but low-key a bit sad because I just found out you need tickets, which are sold out. So if anyone has the hookup, let a sister know!
2016-12-25,3,We had their special instead of their sandwiches which I think was a mistake. So I feel like I can't give them a legit rating. So just based on the special...it's a 3 star. The Special was a lot of food and it was ok but not amazing.
2016-12-15,5,I love this place! The food is fresh, flavorful, and affordable. The staff is great. They gave my daughter some of their homemade mozz and it was unbelievable. I ended up buying some. I usually get their meatballs, paninis, broccoli rabe, and salmon. Tonight they had a tuna special and it was very fresh. They also have great salads and breakfast.
2016-11-11,2,Not a very good experience. Ordered delivery and it was beyond average. We got the chicken salad which was as bland as cardboard. The chicken cutlet sandwich was not much better. Everything seemed like it lacked salt. Needed more flavor. Idk why but just not feeling this place.
2016-10-14,4,Very good Italian comfort food, and more.  Like a good home cooked meal.  It's relatively inexpensive, and they give you a lot of food for the price.  Don't expect anything fancy here, that's not what this place is about.  Go for the pasta dishes such as the tortellini with bolognese, or the meats from the oven such as the roast turkey, roast chicken, or beef brisket.  Don't forget the rice balls on the side.  The sandwiches are generally ok, depending on what you are getting, but the dipped sandwiches are very good such as the roast beef, roast turkey, or brisket.  The burgers are meh.  The chicken fingers are a small portion but they are pretty solid.  All of the sides are pretty good.  Definitely a favorite go-to place when I'm hungry and want good food but don't feel like spending a lot of money.
2016-09-28,4,Rosticeria Da Gigi is one of the most underrated places in Hoboken. It's never packed or crowded with customers sitting as most customers order takeout.  The interior and exterior design is kind of sore on the eyes. The food though, is different story. They have some pretty interesting options. I got the lamb sandwich with mint jelly and it was fantastic. Never had anything like it before. The portion size was generous as well.  Also ordered a chicken parm sandwich and that too was very good. This is a great spot to come to if your Uptown in Hoboken and want to sit down, get a quick bite, and have some quality food.Will be coming here again in the future.
2016-09-13,5,The best food in all of Hoboken! Hidden gem! I would love it if they expanded eventually!
2016-08-30,5,Came here for the first time yesterday, had a salad great portion for the price so delicious! And the service !? Amazing My waitress danielis was so nice an attentive five stars for this place
2016-08-19,5,I have to be honest. I've lived here for 12 years and passed it everyday and never knew to stop in. Then one day out of the blue I got a delivery at 8am and that ended that quickly. The fresh mozzarella is one of the best in Hoboken and delivery is fast, consistent and darn right good.  I'm now a weekend regular.
2016-08-10,2,I am giving 2 stars because the food is great however the service is horrible. I called to order a Panini for delivery and was told I needed to add on something else to get to the $10 minimum to get it delivered even though it is a $2 dollar delivery charge but whatever. So I ordered a can of soda and when he came to deliver it first of all they went to the wrong apartment and he wasn't even there when he was calling me saying that he was there. Second of all the guy came and I had a $20 bill that I gave him for my total which was about $12. He handed me back a $5 and says that he doesn't have any more change to give me. He kept asking me if I had change and I didn't and he actually suggested I go across the street to the ATM to get change. (Which wouldn't have even helped in this situation) So I call the store and try to tell someone that I did not get my can of soda and that the delivery guy did not have the change for me and all she did was mock me and say "what do you want me to do I am working here by myself" and kept asking me over and over again what I did not receive in the order. Every time I answered her and said I did not receive my can of soda and also did not receive the proper amount of change she mocked me and just said "so you're calling here for $2?" I will not be dining with them again. What kind of business operates like that? I understand it's only a can of soda but I also didn't get proper change to basically I ended up paying $15 for a $8 panini. How is that not a good reason to call and ask for my money back? She also said she couldn't gives cash back so there's basically nothing they can do unless I want store credit which after this experience I won't be going back so that's pointless.
2016-07-15,4,Lovely little restaurant! The staff was  so nice, establishment was clean, food very tasty! I have to give 4 stars for the simple fact that I paid $18 for a salad!!!! I was not pleased. The menu showed all of their options with pricing, except the summer menu. I should have asked before ordering but alas I did not....how was my lunch more expensive than what i typically pay in the city???I think the owner should re-evaluate a bit.
2016-06-30,5,I live uptown and order from seamless all the time. I love the food. It's always prepared fresh and tasty. What I like about this place is you can eat healthy (salmon and veggies) or unhealthy (chickn parm panini) depending on your mood and both are satisfying which is rare for a restaurant to do both well. It's not fancy or anything inside but it gets the job done!
2016-06-20,5,Wonderful food and service. Had the stuffed peppers and the sweet potatoes are a must! Each time I've come here it's been consistent. Great selection and you can tell everything is homemade.
2016-06-05,4,Have ordered several times from them. Always friendly and quick service. Food delicious and heavy, tastes like homemade.
2016-06-02,5,Love the breakfast at this place! Their quiche is to die for and the fresh sausage is outrageous, I could eat that everyday for breakfast. Staff is very friendly, fast service, highly recommend.
2016-05-22,5,While I was pregnant, my husband was on the hunt for the best meatball sub in the area. We ordered a couple a week for a few weeks time. And without fail, this won as the best we could find!!We then one day came in person and they have tables outside and it tasted even better fresh. I order the chicken parm sub and it's just as good. The prices are decent too but they do upcharge for delivery in Jersey City which it gets pricey for 2 subs and tip (almost $30). But if you love meatball subs, I'd totally say it's worth it!
2016-04-20,1,This business sent us lunch menu via fax to our Business, then denied sending it. When I ordered they sent the wrong sandwich. I would have eaten it but the eggplant Parmesan was dripping in so much grease and there was mostly breading no eggplant. The sub was extremely soggy. When called the business to advise they denied sending a lunch menu to order from and then wanted me to pay for a additional sandwich after the first one was a complete greasy soggy lump! They get a Negative THREE stars.
2016-04-04,4,Been here a few times over the past few months and haven't been disappointed, delicious food at a very fair price. I will be coming back again!
2016-03-23,4,Good food, a bit pricey (for basic dishes), but highly satisfying.  Friendly service.  Don't order the Greek salad if you want traditional - it is mixed greens with a pesto-y dressing, some feta and no grape leaves.  But I should have known...  Rosticeria Da Gigi is Italian!
2016-03-11,5,Probably my favorite place to order lunch from in Hoboken. They have an extensive menu, and personally I love to order the roasted salmon lunch, which includes 2 sides. As far as sides go, I love the polenta, pesto pasta, roasted mixed vegetables, and beet salad. The roast chicken lunch is also delicious. Their delivery service is quick, and they also offer outdoor seating which is nice during nice weather. Definitely recommend for a cheap but filling lunch!
2016-02-16,5,This is our go-to delivery spot in Hoboken when we don't have time to cook, or just don't feel like cooking, but want something satisfying and healthy.  We tend to alternate between the half rotisserie chicken with two sides or the eggplant parmesan.  Both are consistently delicious.
2016-01-16,4,Love this place, I go here whenever I'm in Hoboken. Pretty quiet, uncrowded cafe. I usually get a mozzarella, sundried tomato, and avocado sandwich. Extremely tasteful. Recommended
2016-01-13,4,I've been wanting to try this place for a while! Great reviews. A beautiful day in Hoboken called for a walk uptown on Washington. Small places - it's a typical Italian deli with some seating so you can dine in our take out.
2015-12-22,4,The real deal, great panninis, great sanwhichs, service is great...not big and not fast but friendly.  Check the daily specials, meetball parm a must
2015-12-02,4,There is honestly nothing that I haven't loved about this place. It's definitely catering to a Hoboken crowd on the go since they only have 4/5 tables for seating and the majority of their orders are for take-out/delivery. I've ordered breakfast, lunch, and dinner for delivery as well as eaten here quickly before class at Stevens nearby and all the experiences have been great. Delivery is pretty quick in comparison to other places and a result, the food comes relatively warmer. Most recently, I stopped for a quick solo dinner and had the chance to talk to a lady who was either an owner, related to the owner or has just been employed there for a long time because she was very enthusiastic about their offerings and told me most of the following information with pride: Almost everything is homemade fresh daily, especially the hot entrees, sides and salads. They even make their own dressings and dipping sauces! Their turkey club sandwich, has been one of my favorites in Hoboken thus far. Love the Italians, but Gigi keeps it simple - nothing beats the fresh, thinly sliced turkey... yum! If you're in a rush and don't want to spend more than $10-15 for dinner or just want something emulating a meal that can be made in your own kitchen, then I strongly recommend giving Gigi a call.
2015-11-16,5,I work in Hoboken and dine out for lunch regularly - Gigi's is my favorite restaurant in Hoboken, and it's not even close! Great lunch specials, delicious specials, hearty salads.. I've been going 2-3 times a week for many months and don't think I've ever had a bad meal. Great service a bonus!
2015-11-15,4,My father came to visit me from Maine and he was craving a pastrami sandwich. My go-to for a deli is either Vito's or Fiore's but they were both closed. I decided to try Da Gigi after hearing good things and I'm so happy I did. My father ordered a pastrami and Swiss on a delicious, soft Italian bread. He also had an excellent side of pesto pasta. I ordered the chicken parm and -- let me tell you it was amazing. A generous helping of marinara sauce with a hearty layer of cheese served on delicious Italian bread combined to make a superb sandwich experience. I live right next to Fiore's, Delfinos, and Laourdo Bros. so I rarely have to look more than two blocks away for excellent Italian dishes. But for the best chicken parm in Hoboken, I'm heading to 916 Washington St.
2015-11-04,3,I have been for both breakfast and lunch here. Breakfast was average, but lunch was very good. For breakfast, I ordered a simple sausage, egg, and cheese on a kaiser roll. Meat/egg to bread ratio was way off (way too much bread, only one sausage link/one egg). I don't think I have ever had a breakfast sandwich with sliced sausage link in it before and while it wasn't bad tasting, I expected a bit more of it. The egg and cheese in the sandwich was surprisingly good and the kaiser roll was average. The breakfast sandwich itself was a tad overpriced at nearly $5.50. For lunch, I came here and ordered the traditional turkey, mozzarella, arugula, and roast pepper sandwich on a sub roll. Everything was fresh, delicious and satisfying. Overall, this place is good. I need to try it a few more times to really give it an accurate review. No credit/debit card minimum, unlike Vito's or Bagels on the Hudson.
2015-10-12,3,We came for lunch.  Really enjoyed the roast chicken with 2 sides.  The meatballs were excellent.  Ask for a side of gravy for chicken.Soup and salad were great.  We got the chicken noodle soup.
2015-10-11,1,We used to order from this place at least twice a week. The food was always on point, however, the past couple of times it has been atrocious. I ordered salmon and it was broken into pieces and over cooked, I ordered grilled chicken salad and they forgot to bring the dressing on the side. They don't have good customer service and don't value repeated customers. I will not be ordering from there again.
2015-10-10,5,GiGi's is GREAT!! Service is always spectacular and delivery is always fast! Never a complaint with anything my husband and I have ordered, from breakfast to seafood! Love it
2015-10-04,1,If this is what hoboken thinks is a deserved 4.5 star place, then we are in trouble.  This is a mediocre at best mexican place disguised as Italian food.  Lasagna looked like a smothered enchilada, the prepared foods were soagy and bland.  They couldn't even get a basic pastrami/swiss on rye right.  What a waste of money, although clean, the food is sub par.  should of known from the million item menu and cheap prices, you just can't defy the laws of economics...
2015-09-13,3,We got the breakfast after the amazing reviews. So disappointed. The corn beef hash was undercooked and mush. It was really inedible. I almost threw it on the pan to cook it more but was so turned off by the whole thing I couldn't eat it. The breakfast sausage was just regular Italian sausage and did not go well with the breakfast at all. The only good thing was the toast. Side note: we called after placing the order and asked them to call instead of ringing the bell upon arrival. Nope...they rang the bell...twice.
2015-09-05,4,Had a pressed Cuban sandwich that was on the special board. Very good! Their homemade roast pork was some of the best I've ever had.
2015-08-28,5,I absolutely love this place!! This is one of my "go-to" restaurants. I typically order for pick-up or delivery, but have as gone to the restaurant. The wait staff was very friendly and the service is also very fast. I always get their tortellini bolognese and two cannoli and always have enough food for two meals. So delicious!
2015-08-24,4,What a great little spot in Hoboken. I've only recently discovered this place, and it's quickly become a frequent stop for a quick lunch. The menu is more of a rough guide, as you can pretty much make up anything you want. I've been repeating the roast pork panini with Brie, apple butter, and caramelized onions. 1) the sandwich is huge. 2) it's delicious. I've also been impressed with the rolls they use on their breakfast sandwiches. Hoping this place sticks around as we've had nothing but good experiences here.
2015-08-15,4,Came here for brunch one Saturday. I had walked by this joint a number of times but never stopped. We found a nice four top inside and were treated well by a very friendly server. She was knowledgable and fun. The meal was fresh and made to order. I had the Croque Madame (which was great), my wife had the Beet & Goat Cheese Arugula salad (which I tasted and was awesome) and my folks both had the BLT with French fries. Their fries are large and hearty and freshly sliced. It's a real nice spot. Nothing fancy, just good food & people.
2015-08-15,4,Great little spot for a good, fresh meal in Hoboken. Friendly service and really tasty food made to order. Definitely will be a go to spot for us moving forward.
2015-07-20,3,My wife and I ordered takeout from here on the basis of the great reviews on Yelp.  The food was pretty mediocre and lackluster, and our spaghetti and meatballs came WITHOUT spaghetti.  The staff was very friendly and the inside of the place (while we waited for our food to be prepared) was cozy.  I'll chalk up our bad experience to takeout, and try dining in next time.
2015-07-11,4,Wow what a surprise who would have known that a humble small deli can serve better tasting food than most full service resto in Hoboken with mussels and pastas on the menu Biggies watch out you got serious competition here and from a deli at thatGood fresh food and affordable will surely come back
2015-07-03,1,I ordered them delivery for my hungry guests as some reviews said they were quick. It wasn't the case for me. 5 blocks might have been too far for them. I had to microwave the cooled food when guests were about to leave. Well,, it could be still ok if the food is very good, but not. I'd rather go with Subway's sandwiches for half price.
2015-06-29,4,YAASSSS!A friend and I met up here because the reviews were indicating it's a sure thing. We were not disappointed, BRAVO Rosticeria Da Gigi!We ordered the same thing: Lunch Special: Mozzarella, Sun-dried Tomatoes, Eggplant AND Roasted Peppers. It was a sammich/gyro/wrap and we asked for it on a bed of greens. Holy excellent flavors. Light yet large, we sat outside in the sun and shade and caught up.Oh and can we say affordable? $21 check, two drinks, two ginormous, delicious and hearty salads. BOOM!
2015-06-27,5,We've been here many times.  Always very fresh and delicious.  Tried many different items off the menu and never disappointed.  Servers are attentive and musical.  Feels like home.  Enjoy!
2015-06-18,4,Quick delivery. Food is good. They have alot of options from breakfast to vegetarian to quinoa!
2015-06-12,3,Had the roast chicken lunch special with grilled polenta and a rice ball. Good price and portions for an uptown Hoboken lunch. The chicken was good, just a bit dry towards the breast. Polenta was good and creamy. The rice ball was not so good the rice felt undercooked and the breading was overcooked. Service was nice and friendly and they didn't charge me for an Italian cookie I ordered. The cookie was mediocre though.
2015-06-10,5,Cute spot with good service and good food overall.We had some sandwiches, they were yummy.  We ordered and paid at the counter, but then the lady brought us our items with real plates and silverware and waited on us, bringing us some extra sauce, water, all that, which was nice.  I thought it was just order and pick up and you are on your own. Super good food, the focaccia bread was delicious, the avocado was fresh and ripe, and the chicken was lean and well seasoned.  Well done, super small spot, but good outdoor seating.
2015-06-09,4,Love this spot. It's not fancy, it's not one of the bloated restaurants in Hoboken where the reputation outworks the quality. It's a quiet place where you can get good food, quickly and comfortably. A nice little Italian deli where you can sit outside, relax, have a good sandwich, the yummy chocolate pudding or tiramisu and a coffee.
2015-06-04,5,Absolutely. Amazing. I love the Beet & Arugula Salad (added chicken) and my boyfriend got the Chicken Cheesteak sandwich which was great and both were definitely enough to save for later. Highly recommend lunch spot or even dinner! Cute place too :)
2015-05-25,5,I absolutely Love this place. The food is outstanding and Delicious every time my wife and I have dinner here also we always order extra for home.It's a byob so you can't go wrong.
2015-05-22,5,We found this place by accident, we were walking by and they had a free table outside so we decided to give it a try. I am so glad we did, everything we had was absolutely delicious and very high quality. It is also very cheap, it's BYOB which is great too. We had meatloaf, rigatoni with spicy sausages, grilled shrimp, everything was very very good. They make their own mozzarella which was 'to-die-for'. Also people who work there are extremely friendly. We liked it so much that went back the next day. After having dinner there we also took some sandwiches to go. Can't wait to go back!
2015-04-19,5,Hands down best take out and delivery in Hoboken. I have picked up and also had delivery. The delivery was extremely prompt and my food still piping hot. Now the food is amazing!!! And such a bargain as well! I love the carved meats and the sides. I tried the pesto pasta side for the first time today and it was since nice buttery and basilly!! I also love the roast beef, seriously melts in your mouth. The carved meats provide you with 2 sides and generous portions to boot!! If you are looking for some hearty delicious cooking look no further! I can't wait to try more items from the menu!!
2015-04-19,3,Came here on a weeknight with my bf for dinner. The lady who served us was friendly. However, as others have wrote on their reviews, it took a while for us to get our food. Was seated immediately after we entered the restaurant, but our water didn't come till 10 mins later. As for the food, we ordered a sandwich and chicken. The chicken had no taste at all so were the fries that came with it. The sandwich was alright.
2015-04-19,3,We came here for brunch one morning and left feeling disappointed with our service and experience. Our server was a small Guatemalan lady who was pleasant and friendly but just kept forgetting things and took a really long time with things. We ordered two skim lattes to start, they came out about 15 minutes after we ordered them and they were warm not hot. Now, I know I get a littlecranky without my morning cup but really?!?! We then ordered a fruit plate, eggs, corned beef hash, toast with butter and French toast. Please note the WE, I am not that big of a honey badger. The corned beef hash browns barely contained any corned beef!! What the heck?!? If I wanted regular hash browns we would have ordered those. They were okay, but nothing to recommend. The eggs were well cooked and the French toast was good. Now, the toast was unbuttered even though we specifically asked for it to be buttered. My man likes his butter. So then we asked the waitress to bring over some butter and glasses of water. Five minutes goes by and no butter and no water, we can't even seem to find her and its a small place. We eventually just got up and asked the counter girl for some butter.  A total of ten minutes later our water was dropped off at the table.. Wow. It only only about 6 tables, and only 4 were filled, they should be able to provide good service. I may try a sandwich to go from here and see if that is what they are known for.
2015-04-18,5,I have a boyfriend. His name is Papardelle Bolognese and he lives at Roticeria Da Gigi.I dream about this dish. It is often the only thing in the world I wish to consume. And I do.Beautiful sauce, meaty, delicate; fresh papardelle perfectly al dente.I love you, PB. (Oh, and the rest of the food is great, too.)
2015-04-16,5,Had dinner here with my family when we visited my son in Hoboken-- it was AMAZING!!
2015-04-14,5,Gigi's is as good as you can expect. Lia was fantanstic. She made my order right and I'll be back soon! Great mutz, great roasted meats, incredible stuffed peppers... I could go on but, suffice it to say, this is my go-to place for in-person or delivery!
2015-04-09,4,Where do I begin... Well we stopped in here after passing by it so many times and I am now wondering why it took us so long to come here.My first meal here was the Egg Salad Club. Did I forget to mention my love of egg salad and my weariness of ordering it out.  It was so tasty and the addition of avocado and bacon. Sheer genius. My son had a burger and fries and didn't leave anything on the plate.  While the decor might deter you from coming in I guarantee the meal will be amazing.  The people there are very nice as well.
2015-04-04,5,Great food.  Everything I've had here has been very good & fresh.  Service is always friendly & helpful.  What else could you want?  Decor?  It's a deli, not Del Frisco's.
2015-03-30,5,Really, really stellar Italian food for very cheap.  I had the most expensive platter on the menu (chicken parm) which was only just about $10 and filled me up for the day.  The sauce is beautiful, the chicken perfect, and the mozzarella plentiful and real.  Pasta was out of this world.  Later tried the pesto shrimp sandwich, which did not disappoint.And the tiramisu...oh the tiramisu...just mouth-wateringly perfect.  The cream was so ideal, I can only imagine what they've done with the cannoli.The place is small and is mostly counter and prep room, but don't let it turn you off.  People are really nice and the seats by the windows are relaxing and not pretentious like pretty much everywhere else on this street tries to be.  This place is most certainly worth your time.
2015-03-29,4,Their interior (and exterior storefront) leave much to be desired in terms of decor and ambience.  To be honest, the decor was the main deterrent to us entering the restaurant before despite hearing rave reviews about the food.  However, the food itself is standout and really absolutely fantastic.  The food tastes magnificently home cooked and the portions are generous.  I haven't found better flavors in Hoboken.  When eating in, the food is served piping hot and on basic white plates - no frills, just standout taste and flavor.  The food feels like its made with lots of skill and love.  Also, the prices are ridiculously good.  So happy to add this place to our food repertoire in uptown Hoboken.
2015-03-08,5,Best place for takeout in town. Real home cooked meals, at reasonable prices. Everything I have tried, has been delicious. They have a great variety to choice from as well. The brisket, broccoli rabe, chicken parm, and meatballs are a few of my favorite things on the menu.
2015-02-13,5,Another great home cooked meal.Started with and appetizer portion of stuffed calamari which was awesome. The chicken with Mutz was cooked to perfection, so tensor and moist.  My wife had the meat lasagna.  Everything also taste fresh made that day.  Eat in instead of take out, so much better.Glad they are around the corner.
2015-02-12,5,My goto sandwich spot if I'm in the area! Everything here is so good from breakfast to the dinners but the dip sandwiches and anything with peppers and onions makes me happy! Oh the brisket!
2015-01-26,4,Breakfasts are great (wish they had more omelette options sometimes...or a make your own deal)Dinners/lunch items are to die for. Great quality foods, and for what they charge it's a steal. The roasted meats are really amazing and this is the only place I've found so far where roasted turkey in delicious gravy (just like at Thanksgiving) can be ordered year-round. They offer a wide array of sides which are all very good too. I would take the fact that they appear to specialize in Italian with a grain of salt, since if I were looking for real, authentic Italian there might be other places that would come to mind first over Rosticeria..although the Italian I have had from there is great, for some reason I don't think of them as an Italian place...For me, their sweet spot is really the homestyle meats and sides. Some offerings are a bit too lightly-seasoned for my own tastes, but for most people this is probably normal.. It's probably for the better, since you can just add your own salt and pepper later.
2014-12-13,4,Healthy (by which I mean large) portioned, home cooked meals served by nice, attentive wait-staff in a small but friendly environment.  It is clear that they make many of their items from scratch and they take pride in doing so; as well they should as they do a good job.
2014-11-30,3,Giving it 3 stars with ribbons of optimism flying overhead.  We just have to have some reliably decent, Italian take out in this town. We have gone too long without it.So, the lobster roll was delicate, if not a bit meager on a fresh, brioche bun. People from Maine would consider it an "amuse bouche".  But here in Hoboken, we might be more inclined to just express gratitude for the presence of actual lobster meat, and not that polyurethane, virtual seafood, corrupting salad bars across America. Along with this, I ordered food for my soon to arrive Thanksgiving, house guests, including the pappardelle bolognese,  (surprisingly bland), some kind of ziti with vodka sauce,an eggplant parm sandwich, along with a chicken parm sandwich. The ziti with vodka sauce got devoured, while the rest is still sitting in the back of my fridge, behind the Thanksgiving leftovers.
2014-11-25,4,Initially I was going traditional Italian.But with so many of these places in Hoboken, just had to change it up a bit.Stopped in earlier today & picked up two sandwiches to go.Gotta take care of the Mrs. After looking over the menu ordered a shrimp with cilantro pesto & a lobster roll.Both were served on toasted rolls and the bread was pressed down like a Cuban sandwich would be.Now that the weather is starting to turn,they have pulled in the outdoor seating.You may find that it is a little tight inside. So come early for lunch  if you can.What's different about Gigi's? Breakfast is served along with seafood & vegetarian dish options.Which is quite a nice change for deli's around here.Also of note,dipped sandwiches are available.Prices are very reasonable compared to other deli's in Hoboken.I Would like to come back in the Spring when the weather gets nice again and sit outside for breakfast & a good cup of coffee.
2014-11-19,5,This review only relates to pick up.  I've never eaten inside the restaurant.I love this place.  I'm so glad it's only a block from my apartment because it is a godsend on nights when i don't feel like cooking.My favorite is their roast chicken.  It's tender, juicy, and just amazing.  They also have a TON of sides.  You can make your meal as healthy or as unhealthy as you want.The owner is a really nice guy and loves it when you ask for recommendations.
2014-11-19,5,Came with coworkers for lunch and everyone LOVED everything we ordered. Not s typical place I would stop but don't pass this one by. Inside is small but they also do take out and I believe they deliver.
2014-11-03,3,I don't know how this has a 4 and 1/2 star rating. I was between 2 and 3. We must have ordered the wrong thing. I came in and ordered 2 sandwiches yesterday. It took them almost half an hour to make and they were cold sandwiches! I ordered turkey and fresh moz and the turkey was really dry and the bread was the hardest bread ever. I actually saved half for lunch today hoping that the mayo and oil and vinegar would make the bread soggy so I could actually bite into it, but nope- harder than ever today! I'd say skip this place unless I'm missing something. The fresh moz was pretty good though!
2014-10-29,5,Gigi's is by far the best Italian in Hoboken. The pappardelle bolognese is my favorite thing on the menu (I order it wayyyy too often). Everything they make is homemade to the max- even their lemonade. I've also had their meatballs, eggplant rollatini, and their paninis and they are all so delicious. I could eat at Gigi's every week..and sometimes I do!I have always thought their decor/signage is a total disconnect from the vibe and food they offer - that's the only thing. It doesn't come across as a delicious Italian shop -but that's just what it is!
2014-10-22,4,I don't like the decor, the font on their logo, or the creepy gobo light that shines aforementioned logo on the sidewalk at night. But the food, the food! Lucky for me, RDG delivers!The roasted meats are my go to. Um, a massive portion of succulent, finger lickin yummy roast chicken, pork, or beast, along with 2 sides for $12?!?! Yeah, sign me up.There are prob 25 sides to choose from, including MORE MEATS! Hot sausage, meatballs, and rice balls are my faves; the marinara makes me want to lick the plate. Polenta was a creamy dream too. Skip the quinoa. Sandwiches are solid. Prosciutto mozz and sundried tomato stands out. Looking forward to trying the stuffed peppers, farro, and desserts. Maybe some day they'll remodel. Until then, delivery.com is your friend.
2014-10-19,5,Thank God for Rosticeria da Gigi being in town!! I was babysitting and ordered the pasta bolognese and turkey w two sides (broccoli rabe and garlic mash) and everything was absolutely delicious!!! The bolognese was some of the best I have ever had, the pasta was perfect hand made.  I make a damn good bolognese so I'm almost always disappointed....I was not disappointed, neither was my darling 20 month old niece!! She loved it too (and do not underestimate her food tastes because she's young: she prefers French cheese to American, eats olives for breakfast, and knows good food!)The roast turkey in gravy was delicious as was the garlic mash and broccoli rabe. Everything was perfect and total comfort food!!!!  Kind and prompt service!! Ill be back here for sure when I have no time or energy to cook which I love to do.
2014-10-13,5,Love love love this place! Food is consistently good, homemade lemonade and hibiscus is delightful, and the ambiance is just cozy and warm. Cannot say enough good things. Oh, and they deliver!
2014-09-30,4,On Sunday (09/28), right before we went to the Arts and Music Festival, my boyfriend and I decided to head here for a late brunch. Although I was a little disappointed that the breakfast/brunch menu did not have a whole lot in terms of variety, I was very impressed by the quality of the food I ordered: a toasted croissant with egg whites, served with a side of crisp bacon. The egg whites were perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the bacon was lick-your-fingers good (no greasy puddles or oil stains on the plate). My boyfriend had the corned beef hash with eggs, which he thought were good (he called it "standard brunch/breakfast fare done well").Our server was very nice and gave us plenty of time to finish our meals. Not a huge fan of the interior (kinda small), but I bet it's a great place to stop in for a quick pick-me-up during the morning rush hour.
2014-09-29,5,Two meals in two days and this place has become a favorite! It's wonderful, no matter what time of day!Dinner: The pork sandwich is outstanding! We were also told, while there, that the brisket is one of their best choices.Breakfast: Their breakfast sandwiches are HUGE and delicious! Made fresh, right on the spot, you will not be disappointed.Bathroom: It's small, and just off the kitchen, but it's there. It's clean and inviting.Everything else from my last review holds true.This place is firmly near the top of our list when considering ANY meal in Hoboken. We will always be back in the future.
2014-09-19,4,Came here to takeout dinner before heading home.. place is pretty small but service is quick and you can order online and pay on yelp.com and the order is ready 15-20 mins later. Ordered the rice balls in marinara sauce and the eggplant parm sandwich.  Both were very good and inexpensive.  Will be returning back to order other food items.
2014-09-12,1,From the week this place opened up until two months ago, this was our 'go to' restaurant. We ate there or had delivery at least three times a week.But tonight was our last time. The service and quality of food has gone down hill. There's usually something wrong with the delivery orders and the staff became increasing irritated each time we'd call about it.The owner, Mark is a wonderful guy, but we haven't seen him around for a long time. I was told that he's taken a leave. I hope he's okay, but I'm afraid his business is really suffering without his presence.Yesterday, I went to the restaurant around 4p and ordered take out. I noticed that I was over-charged alittle but let it go and left a 20% tip.When I got home and opened the bag of food, I discovered it was wrong and found no salad dressing or bread. The food which we usually order, tasted bland like the ingredients are different.Tonight we reluctantly ordered delivery from them again, hoping for some sign of the old standards. However, screwed up our address and food order.The delivery person told us to call the restaurant. We did and spoke with Brianna, who said it was our fault that we received tiramisu for dinner instead of tortellini soup and if we still wanted the soup we'd have to pay for both. We said never mind if you're content to lose us as customers, we'll part ways now. A few minutes later we received a voice message from Brianna ranting that it was our fault and we would have to pay for the soup. Our door bell rang five minutes later and the delivery person handed us our soup and salad dressing. He just shook his head in frustration knowing how many times he has delivered to us over the pass year and embarrassed about so many screwed up orders.Apparently the delivery person insisted that they correct the order and deliver it no charge. Brianna did not want to do it, so she decided to leave us a nasty voicemail.We're sad to lose this place, but the situation has gotten so bad that we can't deal with it anymore. Sorry Mark, when you return, I'd like to discuss this with you. Until then, whenever we get the urge to try Gigi's, we'll just listen to Brianna's voice message.
2014-08-30,5,Just tried this place and the waitress was so friendly. She described many of the healthy options and showed us the food inside the case. My husband and I split the mixed grain salad - it's a really good size. Fresh mixed greens topped with farro, quinoa and barley. Everything tasted fresh! WillDefinitely come back to try their other options.
2014-08-16,5,What a great place. My husband started going here with co-workers and now when we don't feel like cooking it is our go-to. He loves the brisket. Orders it almost every time. I love the arugula & beet salad. It is a generous portion and the dressing is delicious. I have stopped for coffee - perfect cup. I highly recommend giving this place a try - it is nice to have fresh food that doesn't cost a fortune.
2014-08-13,5,Excellent old school Italian deli counter, I stopped by here looking for a lunch place as I had a business meeting in Hoboken and they suggested I try this place. This joint exemplifies the secret charm of NJ. Quirky and down to earth. They make an awesome roast beef and caramelized onion dipped sandwich.  Really great ingredients in this. The nice guy at the counter told me their roast beef is made in house and gave me a delivery menu if I ever needed. While I waited, I also noticed the menu also had quite a few veggie and gluten free options for those who are inclined to that.  I scarfed down the sandwich and knowing I'd not be back here for a while, I ordered a Salami, Cappocola, Fresh Mozz, and Roast pepper hero to go for next day's lunch but I ended up eating it that night.  Absolutely delicious.
2014-08-04,4,This spot is fairly new, and open for breakfast early on weekdays so I knew I had to stop in to get a breakfast sandwich en route to work today. They seriously must do so much to-go business because I didn't even get a real coffee mug or, water glass. But that's ok. My waitress was very nice and prompt.  They kindly listened to my request to have turkey sausage ( a small patty, though), with folded scrambled eggs and American cheese on a roll.  It was nice and filling- but not overtly big (A David's down the street has huge breakfast sandwiches but they also charge accordingly). I got a nice tall to-go cup of decent/fair coffee. All in all a bit over $7 which is kind of pricey by city standards but not by Hobokes standards (breakfast sandwiches seem to be pricier).
2014-07-29,4,Great place for breakfast, you can choose any sandwich and they will make it on the spot.Service is great you go to the register order the food and then you can go sit down, they will bring the food to you. Defiantly coming back and I'm sure ill try new staff!
2014-07-21,1,Ordered the Salmon burger for lunch/takeout.  It was dry and plain but the patty itself did have flavor.  I guess you have to ask for lettuce/toppings? Oh and the bun was stale. Disappointed!!!
2014-07-16,5,My new Hoboken obsession!!!I've only been here for breakfast so far, but that will change soon because I want to try everything and at such reasonable prices, I may do just that! For breakfast, I had the croque monsieur, which was to die for. The bread, cheese, and ham are all cooked first together sandwich style and then the eggs (sunny up is best) is placed on top with more cheese, so it looks open faced. SOOO GOOD! The breakfast potatoes are also awesome and my BF would not stop raving about them!The people working here were all incredibly nice and helpful. Perfectly pleasant. Do yourself a favor and come here before the secret gets out!
2014-07-05,4,Great place! Have been here before for lunch and tasted one of the best salads in town. Today I've tried the brunch menu and was surprised again! Good place, great food and great service!
2014-06-20,4,This is an excellent choice when looking for awesome Italian food at a very reasonable price. The food deserves a 5 star rating. The restaurant is small and not very fancy. The service was outstanding and the staff was very friendly. I recommend the chicken parmigiana with a side of rigatoni with vodka sauce. Also try the linguini and clams. Top it off with the tiramisu. Highly recommended.
2014-06-01,5,After walking by this place a million times, my boyfriend and I stumbled into GiGi's post afternoon drinks. The chicken cutlet, mozz, and sun dried tomato sandwich was so good! The bread is very good as well. I would have personally added some balsamic to it, but my boyfriend love it as is. We also got the tortellini salad and lemonade. All around goodness. It was so good, we came back and got the same exact sandwich the next day. What can I say? We're creatures of habit. If I could give this place 10 stars I would. Mainly because the owner is the absolute sweetest!
2014-05-31,5,The restaurant is cramped and far from fancy, but every time I get food from here, it's like a home-cooked meal from the Sicilian grandmother I never had. Gigi's offers the authentic, Jersey-style Italian food that Hoboken is known for. Plus, it's BYO. Unclear why so many Hoboken restaurants are BYO, but I'm not asking questions.The ingredients are fresh, and the dishes are hearty. The prices are low enough that I assumed they were joking. In terms of selecting from the biblically long menu, stick with dishes you would expect on the quintessential Italian-American table: Pappardelle Bolognese, Penne alla Vodka, Eggplant Parmigiana.  The owner is a solid guy, and he clearly cares about making great food. He's the kind of person to whom I am happy to give business. As this restaurant succeeds, one of the good guys is winning.    I have been here several times for brunch as well as dinner, both eat-in and takeout. I also sampled the mozzarella and brisket sliders that Gigi's offered at Hoboken Mutz Fest. If some freak science experiment turned all the food on earth into those brisket sliders, that would be the best freak science experience of all time.
2014-05-28,5,had the roast pork an Brie panini and it was motha facking gourmet. so good and crunchy I might order another one right now. you have to try the panini it's on perfect crunchy rosemary focaccia. crumbley and crunchy and delcious.
2014-05-20,5,This is my go-to breakfast/lunch/dinner spot in Hoboken. I have never been disappointed with anything from Gigi's. I'd imagine the few bad reviews  come from delivery orders and ppl who probably haven't even been to the actual restaurant. It's a small mom & pop type joint. If you're a regular here, definitely introduce yourself to the owner. He is a great, friendly guy who always chats with me, and will remember you everytime you're there. The food is great, has high quality ingredients, made fresh, and always tastes delicious. I could literally eat here any meal of the day and be more than satisfied. Considering my personal stomach issues, I am forced to eat on the healthier side. They have many gluten free options and it's not hard to order anything healthy. The roasted meats with two sides are a great dinner option for only 12 dollars! Breakfast is also amazing! Pancakes, omelette's, oatmeal, French toast are all great. The desert's are just as good. Deliver is always timely and accurate! Definitely one of the best and highest quality places in Hoboken.
2014-05-16,5,Best restaurant for the money in Hoboken, hands down.  Always an excellent meal at a fair price.  Great, hearty Italian cooking.  Roast meats are all incredible. Pastas are fantastic.  Sides are great - def try the rice ball, it's a unique and delicious dish. It's BYOB so you save a bundle on wine. Wait staff is super-friendly, atmosphere is warm and inviting.  A great place to bring kids.  Relaxed, informal setting.  And they deliver.  Our favorite joint in Hoboken.
2014-04-15,5,My new favorite restaurant in Hoboken.  The daily roasted meat is out of this world, tender and flavorful.  I never even would've thought to get it, if the table next to us didn't highly recommend it.  The homemade pappardelle is equally amazing.  The owner is one of the nicest people I've met in Hoboken so far, you can tell how much he loves both cooking and Hoboken.  My boyfriend and I have decided to come here once a week until we've had everything on the menu. Oh and don't forget to go look at all the sides they have there on display.  We ended up getting a quinoa stuffed red pepper which was perfect.  This place will no doubt become a Hoboken institution.  Customers, even new ones like us, are treated like family.
2014-04-07,5,We decided to have my grandfather's birthday dinner catered from here.  The food was excellent.  Some of our favorites were the country chicken and brisket.  Mark was great to work with, very professional.  We had the food delivered, it was a great way to host a family get together in hoboken.  Would definitely recommend for catering your next party!
2014-04-07,5,I'm giving Gigi's a Whoohoo! because I ordered for a party of 30 people (many different entrees with chafing dishes) and Mark, the owner, personally sat with me asking about the party, recommending possible dishes - couldn't be nicer!  The food at the party was exemplary -- got raves from everyone: chicken parm, stuffed mushrooms, a couple of different pastas, great brisket, mozz, brioche rolls, cookies... and the price was very reasonable for such good stuff.
2014-04-07,5,Visiting my HoBo buddy, I stumbled in for a big, meaty sandwich, and I certainly got one. I'm partial to cured Italian offerings, and mine was stuffed with plenty of everything I could want: salami, coppacola (gabagoul!), mozzarella, roasted peppers. Service was friendly and fairly fast for a busy Saturday afternoon. THe sandwich was pure submarine heaven wrapped in tinfoil.
2014-03-18,3,A couple of times I have been here I thought the food was great.  Other times, the food was terrible.  Overall it's been inconsistent but when it's been bad, it's been really bad.  Not edible.  Still, sometimes the food has been really good...
2014-03-17,1,Last night, we ordered dinner here and were really disappointed in what we got.The Chicken Parmesan Dinner came with watery sauce and soggy, overcooked chicken. The pasta was overcooked a little too. It wasn't terrible but come on. Pasta is easy.The Ceasar Salad was drenched in dressing, making it basically inedible.The Tuna Salad - ugh... I was expecting a few slices of tuna fillet on some greens. What I got was tunafish that was reminiscent of school lunch that used to turn my stomach as a kid - on some greens.The quinoa side was cold and vinegar-y. Not appetizing.I'm not sure if this was just an off night, but we had to chuck everything and microwave some pizza. Very disappointed.
2014-03-14,1,It was my first time here and if you are hungry I recommend you go else where. There's this guy who I supposed is the owner. This guys grabs you and starts Rumbling about a million stories about his life from the 1800's and simply I'm not interested I just want my food! I was seriously trying to leave and he just kept holding me. The food is OK!
2014-03-13,4,Gave it a second try, the food is above average.  Overall I was happy with the food quality but the service falls short.  They did comp my meal after the delivery came an hour late.  I'll give them another shot.
2014-03-12,5,I thought I was done finding all the good Italian places in Hoboken but now I have to work this place into my rotation of favorite spots too.Expect to get messy if you're ordering one of the best sandwiches and expect it to be worth it. The prime rib was perfect, it fell apart as I bit into it.If you're the type of person that needs a fantasy atmosphere to enjoy a great meal this might not be the place for you but if you just want to shovel delicious food into your mouth then you have to check it out.
2014-03-06,4,Loved it!! What a great addition to Hoboken, a town which for me, is lacking in really consistent, good dining options. And I say that with love. Gigi offers good Italian food made with care. I ordered delivery. It took fifteen min more than the estimate but you get a great value for the price- lots of things come with very ample side dishes. My husband had a generous portion of penne vodka with a delish side of mutz and tomatoes. I had the eggplant parm and broccoli rabe. Very fresh rabe and not bitter in the least. Loved the eggplant too. Very solid. Overall good meal, good value. One suggestion - both dishes were just a touch heavy on the salt but nothing terrible. What a great addition to town! I look forward to dining in soon. Any place that will deliver you well executed broccoli rabe is a winner with me.
2014-03-04,5,I've been here twice now and enjoyed it very much both times. The pasta portions are very generous and tasted great (we've tried the tortellini with bolognese and the linguine with red clam sauce). I like the casual ambiance of the place. There is table service but it's extremely laid back. There are a few tables so it'll work for smaller groups but it's not really intended to be a full-on sit-down restaurant. Hoboken needs more of these places where the focus is on making honest food without pretension.
2014-03-02,1,Just ordered delivery breakfast from here. Front desk calls to let me know that delivery guy is on its way up. So I open my door to wait for him and I can hear the guy swearing as he walks down the hall trying to find my apt. He finally gets here and hands me a bag of food with half the coffee I ordered spilled in the bottom. Coffee is now dripping all over my floor and he says nothing about it. I'll update if the food is amazing and changes my opinion but at this point really unimpressed with their service for delivery.
2014-02-13,1,Was told initially that the food would be delivered in 15 minutes.  Then, they said 40.  Called back after waiting for an hour and ten minutes at which point they said the delivery man was on his way to our apartment (which is across the street).  It took another 15 minutes for the food to arrive.  It was cold and bland.  Would not order from this place again.
2014-02-09,5,"Real simple honest food" that's their slogan and it couldn't be more true. The owner and creator of all this delicious food is a 3rd generation chef. He commented how with some other places all the great flavors simply "get lost in the sauce" simple unadulterated delicious food! Everything is made in house from scratch and made fresh. Even the water is tripled filtered our orange juice was fresh squeezed. I had a fritatta "Gigi" with peppers onions zucchini, mushroom and tomato. Man was it good! The home fries it came with were red potato and cooked with peppers and onions. Got to to be the best home fries I've ever had. As I was eating my breakfast I overheard multiple customers come in and get brisket sandwhich with fresh mootz ( that they also make in house). I knew I had to get one to go for lunch later. That brisket sandwhich with fresh mootz was an incrediable combination. Out of this world! I don't live in Hoboken but was visiting friends. When I come back I will Absolutely be stopping at Rosticeria da Gigi !
2014-02-09,4,Ordered delivery of penne alla vodka (with an add-on of grilled salmon, served in a separate container) and spaghetti with white clam sauce. Both were delicious. The spaghetti dish had clams in the shell, which was a nice surprise, and the sauce was almost light - not at all salty or oily. The portions are sizable. I'll definitely order from them again.
2014-02-04,5,this place is awesome !!! owner is a solid guy!!! great food and service!! seafood salad and #15!!! you won't be disappointed.
2014-01-26,5,Delicious!  I love this new gem.  I've ordered from here twice for dinner.  First time I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and second time I ordered the pappardelle alla bolognese.  I also ordered chocolate mousse.  SO GOOD!  And a large portion, which I frankly didn't need but ate anyway because I'm a piggy.
2014-01-22,4,Rosticeria da Gigi, a name steeped in tradition and excellence, draws from a veritable wealth of classical elegance matched with hardwood flooring expertise. Too often labeled as an homage to Ben Affleck's theatric pinnacle in "Gigli," the name derives it's true essence from founder, and purveyor of Thai-amalan cuisine, Will Smith. His chart topping bacon-baster, "Gettin' Jiggy Wit It," serves as the beloved Thai-amalan national anthem. (Jiggy = Gigli in Thai-amalan) His seminal roles in films such as Wild, Wild West and his Academy Award-winning performance in Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke afforded him perspective on both cultures. Because, let's face it, Guatemalan food is the exact same thing as Mexican food. This unique cultural heritage shines both on the walls and on the page turner that is Gigi's 100% corrugated-cardboard menu. Laden with enticing offerings, powerful aromas from the cucina sweep you back to the days before your Thai-amalan independence. The caramelized 3-D Doritos served in a French Toast Crunch-encrusted cucumber bowl delight the palette and puzzle the senses. What to make of a world where puppies sit in high-chairs and Jayden is the only waiter? These are the questions posed when one opens the doors to the hallowed grounds of the former Míami. In a city oversaturated with Thai-amalan cuisine, Rosticeria da Gigi stands as a beacon of hope for the people  of this once proud nation and the icon they so dearly love.
2014-01-10,4,I have to downgrade (just by a notch). Got the polenta the other day and it was SOOO Salty (like someone had poured the bag of salt in by mistake), and of course that was the day I didn't get utensils and they put mayo on my BLT when I explicitly asked for no mayo:) Anyway. Still much love for this place just needs more consistency.
2014-01-08,4,Try it. Rosticeria Da Gigi's is a mix between a deli (small spot with fresh ingredients) and a diner (friendly, down home service). Extensive affordable menu with an array of italian delicatessen offerings. Good for spending the morning reading while you dine, leisurely chatting with friends, bringing your picky kids to choose among the loads and loads of available dishes... you cant go wrong. Taste-bud favorite: an off-the-menu orzo beef soup. Tip: start here then grab the bus (Northbound directly across the street) into NYC
2014-01-05,4,I ordered take out from Rosticeria Da Gigi on a freezing cold Friday.  I was sick but just starting to get my appetite back.  I read the great reviews for this place and decided my first foray away from soup would be from here.  I ordered the croque madame, farro, and papardelle Bolognese (figured I'd get lunch and dinner while I was at it). The croque madame was good; they kept the egg separate to maintain the integrity of the egg although I guess it was a weird thing to order as take out.  The farro was tasty and the Bolognese was really good! I was very impressed with the quality of the food for the price.  The take out arrived very speedily as well.  I would definitely eat here again to try some of their other sandwiches and pastas.
2014-01-05,5,Wow! Ordered delivery lastnight the Bolognese was simply delicious and it was enough for two people I have left overs for tomorrow. Everything tasted very fresh. I am ordering from here today for brunch I heard about the Croque Madame. I definitely highly recommend this restaurant I'm surprised I haven't heard of it before but it is definitely my new go to spot!
2014-01-02,3,Been here twice since they opened.  I cannot remember the specifics of my first order but think it was a sandwich and a pasta (lasagna maybe?) to go.  Both were okay, if they were that incredible I'd probably remember more specifics.In the last month tried the breakfast menu (sat down this time), wow.  Really well done, had the Croque Madame which was unique and excellent.  It's essentially an open face breakfast sandwich, placed on a perfect bread (sort of a long hero sandwich roll).  Also got the corned beef hash and eggs, the corned beef hash tasted so fresh, couldn't believe how nice something as mundane as corned beef and hash could be with some creativity and fresh ingredients.For breakfast this is a great addition to uptown, as my primary spot Turning Point can get overrun by the stroller crowd and waits can exceed 30 minutes at times.  If you find yourself in that situation or want something a little more casual, suggest you come to Rosticeria Da Gigi..
2013-12-29,4,Recommended by two friends, I first ordered from Gigi's a few weeks ago.  Amazed that they could get it SOOOO RIGHT!  The pasta bolognese was top notch - fresh pasta, great bolognese sauce... large portion - good enough for two and the best of all - very reasonably priced.  I reordered from them this weekend and, again, loved it.  The chicken parm was as good as it gets. Customer services also top notch - friendly, helpful and offered suggestions to alternates to add to what I ordered.  Reasonably priced, great customer services and top notch food.  A rarity in Hoboken.  A very welcome addition to this mile square town!
2013-12-28,5,Delivery arrived in 10 minutes. Food was delish! Ordered eggplant Parm sandwich and roast beef dip.  Both were awesome. The onions on the roast beef should have been a bit more caramelized, but still super yummy!
2013-12-21,5,This place has the biggest and best sandwiches in hoboken. Went for the second time today and got the smoked ham and Swiss panini. One. The bread was absolutely amazing with rosemary seasoning and two. The meat tasted so fresh. I would recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a cute little place for lunch. And the best part the prices aren't through the roof like everywhere else!! Very nice owner and awesome staff. Five stars!
2013-12-21,5,This place is a gem. Stopped for lunch on a Friday so there was no wait.  The service was very friendly.We had:Prosciutto and Fontina paniniSopressata and Provolone paniniWe added arugula and tomato to both at no extra charge.Both were served on a rosemary foccacia that was fantastic!Looking forward to going for brunch.  Especially since they open at 8am on the weekends!  So hard to find an early brunch place in Hoboken.UPDATE: Went for brunch today. Had the croque madame.  It was awesome.  Thick soft brioche, perfectly cooked.  Super yum.ANOTHER UPDATE: The french toast is perfection.
2013-12-04,5,I just ordered a home delivery of the Prosciutto Panini, the Roast Beef Panini and Croque Madame. I was a little nervous coz I wanted my eggs on the Croque Madame over easy. Past experience tells me it is always better to eat your eggs right at the restaurant rather than order it. But Gigi's got it just right!! Everything was still warm and absolutely fresh!!! Loved my meal and couldn't rave about this place more :))
2013-11-20,3,The price is right; the service is good; and the food is generally tasty.  I rounded down a half star because at breakfast they were serving polish sausage as the side sausage.  I don't mind polish sausage, but at breakfast I'd prefer a nice breakfast sausage. (Much prefer.)
2013-11-16,4,I love it when a new, non-chain little restaurant opens up on Washington Street. Rosticeria Da Gigi is a small spot that specializes in freshly made breakfast, lunch and dinner. The restaurant is 70% kitchen and 30% eating space, with a total of about 7 little tables and some counter bar stools.  There is outdoor dining and the manager hopes to continue outdoor seating with heaters during the colder months. The biggest attraction of this small spot is the freshness of the food and the reasonable prices.The temptation of small places with big menus is to lean on frozen foods, and Gigi is the opposite of that.  Everything from meatballs, pastas, stuffed peppers, steak sandwiches, etc, has a fresh look and taste to it.   Although some of the flavor and taste of the food does not hit the five star mark for me, I'm very comfortable giving a four star plus rating.Gigi has delivery, and it's very good delivery, including patient, polite phone service and quick delivery times.  Likewise, the service inside the restaurant is super-nice and professional. The owner is pretty old school, having run several Hoboken eateries throughout his life.Gigi is clearly a welcome addition to the Hoboken casual dining scene and I recommend giving them a try.
2013-10-23,5,After coming back a few more times, this place def needs an updated review. They won me over!There's this reaaaaally nice waitress that I always get. She suggested the dipped roast beef with carmelized onions and fresh mutz. Delicious. So delicious, in fact, that there was no shame in eating alone! Haha!I've also tried the roast beef and cheddar panini which was deliciously cheesy, roast beefy, and crispy! This is one of my go-to places for lunch now!FYI: why am I so obsessed with their roast beef menu items?? I never liked roast beef.. Until now!
2013-10-07,5,Oh man... this place is great!  The food is delicious, and our waitress was really nice.  I had lunch when I was there, but it's open at 8am. It's great to have another option for breakfast in Hoboken!  There just aren't enough.The Panninis are delicious!  I was worried it might not be enough food, but it was plenty.  Oh, and we were able to add greens and tomato without any extra charges.  Little things like that make you feel welcome. I can't wait to go back and try more.
2013-10-07,5,Love this place!  Haven't gotten the chance to eat here yet, only delivery.  Everything I have ordered has been terrific: rice balls, spaghetti and meatballs, pappardelle bolognese (this is amazing!), paninis, brisket, tiramisu, etc.  Prices are super fair, and the portions are really generous.  Really good value here.Delivery is fast, they always get your order right, and the people who work here are so nice.  Hoping this place succeeds in Hoboken, it's a total gem!
2013-10-03,5,I love this place. I went there every day during my NYC/Hoboken visit. Breakfast sandwiches are delicious and, at $3 a pop, it was well worth it. I had a turkey panini which was made to perfection. Melty cheese, flavorful meat, and crispy bread melded perfectly. The staff was more than friendly and attentive.
2013-09-29,2,Went to the place for the first time to grab something for lunch, wasn't too crowded (people at tables already eating). No one is behind the front counter, so I'm looking at the menu and then server comes up and asks for my order. I ask a question about an item and she doesn't know, so I'm guessing it's the owner/manager who then helps me. I ask him the question and then he goes to other tables and I'm waiting (in no rush). The server goes to take another customer's order and owner/manager comes back to take mine. I said that I wanted to ask about a sandwich and he just walked away before I could ask and that it's not good customer service. He took the menu out of my hand and told me to never come back. Umm, ok. I wasn't yelling or anything-just casual/normal talk. I know that an owner/manager can tell customers to leave but it shouldn't be over a comment about customer service. So I didn't get a chance to try their food, so I don't know how the sandwich would have been. Oh well, least there are plenty of other eateries in Hoboken.
2013-09-23,5,Frustrated with the absurd wait times of neighboring Amanda's and Elysian Cafe (both great) I decided to take a shot at this New Hidden Gem located in the vicinity ... I had the Croque monsieur and a short stack of pancakes:The Croque monsieur was simply a ham egg and cheese stacked on the best  brioche bread i've ever had and it was incredible ... All the ingredients were of the highest quality and cooked to perfection.  It also came with a side of flavorful home fries and all at a more than reasonable price.The Pancakes were also cooked perfectly with just the right amount of vanilla and an even texture of fluffiness which added to it's flawlessness.  5 Years living in Hoboken and this is probably the best brunch I've had. This place is going to blow up and I will be very sad once I can't get a seat  *The Only Downside I see is that they will have to reconfigure their inside seating arrangements to fit more people for the demand will grow in time once the secret is out. (Removal of the wall bar will create space for at least 3 more tables inside)
2013-09-23,5,Brilliant service and delicious mozzarella! Sandwiches are enormous for a lunch - either bring a friend or plan to eat the second half for dinner! Menu looks excellent, prices fair for the huge serving sizes.
2013-09-19,5,I saw the reviews on this place and decided to take the YELPERS advice and check this place out. They weren't wrong. I had the turkey sandwich which comes with turkey, fresh mozzarella, lettuce, onions, oil & vinegar. Delicious and fresh!  It comes with a side of home fries and they were also great. The portion was huge for the price (only $10).  I had to try their tiramisu after  and it was delectable. Everything from their coffee to their dessert was on point ! Go for it and give this place a try. You will be coming back.
2013-09-18,5,Delicious, fresh, creative dishes. Thank you! Finally Hoboken has a decent lunch place to go to!
2013-08-25,5,Finally, a great little Italian eatery in uptown Hoboken. Prices are fantastic for the quantity and quality of the food (~$10), and the service was excellent. I highly recommend the meat platters that come with two full-sized side dishes. Try the fresh moz/tomato salad and the rice balls!
2013-08-11,5,Go NOW, before the line extends out the door.Go NOW, before they realize what they're on to and raise the prices.Go NOW, so YOU can tell people about this place and not vice-versa.We had swordfish, garlic mashed potatoes, tomato/fresh mozzarella salad and garlic bread.  The swordfish was DIVINE.  It's the portion you expect to get for 10.95, a 3/4 inch thick steak about the size of a man's palm.  But the quality outweighs the quantity; salt, pepper and (maybe) clarified butter perfectly season the well cooked fish.  The sides are 4.95 a la carte, and it seems that those are the portions you get as accompaniment to the meat you order.  The big heap of garlic mash was outstanding, provided you enjoy garlic.  Very garlicky, and while I don't mind, I know some might.  The salad arrived in a square bowl and was a large, wonderful portion, lightly and aromatically seasoned.  The garlic bread: crunchy, chewy, buttery and garlicky.  It went great with the salad that proved too much (quantity-wise, not flavor-wise) for the fish.  The place itself looks like a deli counter with one table inside and stools at a counter against the wall.  Outside there four or five tables, with one server to attend to them all.But oh man, you'd be hard pressed to get a better quality at sit downs.  And the service is friendly and knowledgeable.  Stop here before Carlo's, after a walk along the water or whatever...just go.  NOW.
2013-08-07,4,Stopped in for dinner last night and was pleasantly surprised at the super attentive service, clean kitchen, and fantastic food. It seemed like they really had their act together being that they've only been open for a few days. We had the prosciutto and fontina panini, traditional ham, salami, prov on soft Italian bread, side of homemade farro salad--sat outside and people watched. Couldn't ask for anything more. All was delicious! Looking forward to my next meal there.
2013-07-28,4,Don't sleep on this place, because it's going to be good, real good.Rosticeria Da Gigi just opened a few days ago, and so far it's a 'soft' opening while they get everything up to speed.  They'll have a full slate of offerings come September, but for now, you can stop in and get a delicious breakfast or lunch served up by a team that really knows what they're doing.The two partners in the business have been forces behind some of Hoboken's best spots:  Luca Brasi's, and going back a few years, Hoboken House (NY Times 2 stars, on the site that's now Arthur's Steakhouse) and the Truck Stop.  Those latter two no longer exist, but were beloved in their day, and helped to usher good eating into Hoboken at a time when it was a little rougher around the edges.  If you're living here now and enjoying it, give some props to some of the people who took risks to help make the city what it is today. On to the food.  Today was my first visit, and I just got something simple, an egg sandwich, which was quite good.  Flavorful ham, egg and cheese, served on a super-fresh brioche roll.  I ordered the egg over, and it was cooked perfectly.  Not flash cooked, diner-style, so that it came out fast but tough.  No, this was cooked slower, so that it was thick, fluffy and sumptuous.  A small detail, but telling, of a kitchen that knows what it's doing.Normally I wouldn't write a review after just one visit, but I have a good feeling about this place, and I expect good things to come.  It already has the feel of a friendly neighborhood joint, and Mark (one of the partners) helps to make everyone feel at home.  Can't wait 'til they're fully up and running, and will update once I've had the chance to sample more.
