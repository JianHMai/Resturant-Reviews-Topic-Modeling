2021-10-08,5,I love boba. Whenever I'm in Hoboken-i have to stop by here. Today i picked up a  Dirty brown sugar milk tea. So yummy. We asked for it to have boba but someone wasn't paying attention because they forget to add it. The flavor is delicious regardless.
2021-08-29,1,We've come here from Las Vegas for a vacation. We stopped by a few times for the drinks, but the last time my 10 year old child wanted to use the restroom, the staff refused. HEY, OWNER..be humane, I know it's pandemic but how can you say "NO" for a 10 years old to just borrow the restroom for a second, I WON'T COME BACK AGAIN.
2021-07-02,2,I've been coming here for a while and love it but just walked up to find that the door was locked (Friday at 3:30pm) and when I knocked the employee kept ducking under the counter... no sign on the door or anything
2021-05-29,5,My favorite boba spot in jersey!! I've been drinking boba since for 20 years and I know quality! This place has the best tapioca balls ever.
2021-05-26,5,Yesterday I tried the Gong Cha Hoboken location. I had the oolong lychee tea with the bubbles and it was a refreshing drink. They have a variety of tea, and slush drinks and a variety of toppings. They can also adjust the ice and sweetness level to you liking. This place is a good place for bubble tea and they have locations located in New York and New Jersey.
2021-05-08,1,Horrible branch. They make employees work for free for more than 6 hours and later on ghost them. They also always "looking" to "hire" and make people work for free different days and proceed to ghost them.
2021-05-07,5,I love this boba place and their dirty brown sugar milk tea and Thai milk tea with boba. This location provided quick service but it's very hard to find parking if you are driving there. I get my dirty brown milk tea with light ice, 30% sugar, with plant based milk and I like it!
2021-04-25,5,Best bubble tea EVERRRRRR!!! Dirty brown sugar will always be my favorite. Used to go to the one at RU New Brunswick campus but just found out there's one right by me!
2021-03-21,5,First time ordering via Uber Eats and from Hoboken location. Used to live near Montclair location and they weren't as busy as this location. I put in order at 4:30pm and didn't arrive until 6:05pm so know for next time a side note to self -sunny spring Sunday is not the best day to order because it will take forever for 3 drinks. The flavors ordered today were all firsts-Panda milk tea includes bubble pearls in the order so a tip there you don't pay extra for the pearl topping and it had white and black pearls to the milk tea, the other new flavor is a twist of taro which is Strawberry Taro with strawberry pearls which ended up tasting like strawberry milk overpowered the taro flavor. Brown sugar matcha latte no ice and no toppings-is not too sweet and the brown sugar plays down the bitterness usually of matcha flavor. I like it!!! Either way I like Gong Cha variety of drinks much better than Kung Fu but unfortunately limited locations only in Jersey and NYC.
2021-03-08,4,Ordered the strawberry matcha, taro, and lemonade wintermelon with 100% sugar for each.I really liked the taro. I wouldn't say it's the best I've had but I would order it again if I happen to be around the area. The strawberry matcha is unique and the combination of flavors is surprisingly good.   Lastly, the lemonade wintermelon - this drink is definitely not for me. It had a weird jelly texture not suitable for people with my kind of taste buds. Will come back for the strawberry matcha on days when I crave.
2021-02-12,5,Ordered delivery and it was delivered early and order was correct.I ordered the large iced matcha tea (no milk!) with extra bubbles and no sugar, and my boyfriend wanted the large dirty brown sugar milk tea w/milk foam and bubbles, zero sugar added and light ice.Both were excellent!! He said his was the best bubble tea he's ever had! Highly recommend that drink!!The matcha was great quality. Delicious! And I love the extra bubbles! So good!! Prices are fair. We will order from here again.
2021-01-02,4,One of my favorite bubble tea brands in the tri-state area. Today, I tried grapefruit ai-yu with white pearls. It was a little too sweet even with 0% sugar but tasted great. The wait time was just under a minute.
2020-12-23,5,I love getting boba from here, it is sad how they are underrated. But I love their strawberry milk tea a lot and their winter melon with herbal jelly. I would definitely recommend trying their boba
2020-12-20,5,Authentic Asian tea house.. they make the best bubble tea in NJ area .. no kidding.. they maintain Strict COVID protocols.This places gets a big Big YAYYYY!!Reasonably priced as they source the most authentic ingredients...there are other tea shops that probably give you same menus for less $ but don't get fooled.Menu option is massive and you get what you pay for I.e delishhhh  drink. Check out other healthy tea drinks also with some really cool toppings like aloe, herbal jelly etc..Taste is consistent irrespective which gong cha you land in as they always maintain the best quality.Me and Gong cha go way back.. I used to get my oolong tea everyday for 3.5 yrs in Singapore from GOng Cha.
2020-12-02,5,Great place! Staff is super friendly here. It has become a regular spot for me and boyfriend :)
2020-10-21,1,so now i am editing my yelp review since google will not let me reply over there, the overwhelming message in your reply is that of a kindergarten cry baby, who stole your lunch money? no one has reminded you to grow up and be a man? belittle? am i dealing with a children nursery? that night i had to order two teas because the first one you made was trash, and i don't know who is the liar here, the drink returned to you was full missing two sips, based on the money i waste on you every week, least you can do is man up and own to your shortcoming of producing an undrinkable tea, what a disappointment you are, shame on you little boy
2020-10-05,5,I love Gong Cha. It's one of my favorite boba places. The shops always smell good as soon as you walk in, so you feel like it is a legit tea spot. I'm so happy there is one in Hoboken now! Tried the Earl Grey Milk Tea latte with pearls, grass jelly, and pudding. It was delicious!
2020-10-05,5,Fast and tasty! I love that you can pick the sugar and ice levels, and really customize to what you want the flavor to be like.
2020-09-16,5,Got the brown sugar boba with milk foam. My favorite boba for sure. Gong cha never dissapoints.
2020-08-23,5,Great tea. Great service--the guy remembered my order which was much appreciated. The tea can be a little sweet so no or little sugar is the way to go!
2020-08-19,5,Gong Cha is hands down one of the best boba tea chains that is available to us stateside. I will always try to go out of my way to make sure I get a gong cha tea over others because you just know that your tea will be quality, made to order, and the boba will be cooked to perfection. I love that they have a nice spread of milk and fruit teas as well as some really unique/popular drink concepts as well from their "milk foam", slushies, and "creative" drinks like yogurt and caramel! I feel like they have all their bases covered to deliver any type of drink for any mood. I love that you can always choose how much ice and sweetness level you want as well. I feel like their prices might be a bit higher than other chain stores, but if you want quality products, well... you know how the old saying goes, you get what you pay for! Definitely give Gong Cha a try if you haven't!
2020-07-29,5,I'm embarrassed to admit that I'm at Gong Cha a few times a week. I'm a legit bubble tea addict. I always get the same two drinks (dirty brown sugar milk tea and the mango slush) is I can't attest to the rest of the menu. The workers are great and they're exercising proper precautions with the pandemic.
2020-07-13,2,I Love gongcha, will give 5 stars for their tea. I have recently find out that if i check in here i should get a free topping, however this location they refuse to let me use this check in coupon. and the staff just reluctantly says " it doesn't apply here". I said i checked in here and then see this coupon, he goes"i don't know how to use it!"
2020-07-06,5,I've always loved this place but I fell 10x more in love with it after they let me order just as they were closing out. My sister and I were craving their matcha strawberry and dirty brown sugar bubble teas & they literally were so nice and gave me no trouble ordering. The drinks came out perfect too!! Uzi & Jason y'all are my saviors tonight!! Thank youuu. This won't be my last visit for sure.
2020-06-29,4,It was a nice cafe with many board game selections before the pandemic. You can't go wrong with any bubble tea really. I usually go with the brown sugar or taro flavor. Their boba balls are chewy and flavorful.
2020-06-23,5,My favorite bubble tea chain that I will always go out of my way to go to no matter what. I was so happy when this local one opened! It's in a convenient part of hoboken and I can always grab some fried chicken or a cheese steak to go with a great boba.For the boba, my favorites are the classic pearl milk tea, or if I have a sweet tooth, the dirty brown sugarmilk tea. When it's too hot and I can't handle the milk I'll go for a mango yogurt or mango shake. Other fruity ones I like include the strawberry green tea and the peach oolong with coconut jelly. Def the spot to grab some high quality bubble tea and walk across the waterfront when you're in the area.
2020-05-28,5,Got the passionfruit tea today and it was such a refreshing treat to have during the 80 degree weather we had today. Great service and great flavors. Totally would recommend coming here to anyone in the area.
2020-05-10,1,Went today to get a green tea bubble tea. First off, it's not a green tea, it was a weird color and had a bland taste. When I ordered it "blended" the guy told me " this isn't Starbucks we don't do that", instead of a simple "no ma'am sorry". I felt really degraded and humiliated. To treat customers in this manner is ridiculous, a simple question should not warrant so much attitude. Obviously I would know we are not at Starbucks, I'm at a tea house. Never going back.
2020-05-01,5,Love this place! One of the best quality bubble tea :) Has many different variations and flavors. Can customize the percentage of sugar/ice/boba you want in your drink. Quick service & hospitality, small seating area. 10/10 recommend!
2020-03-06,5,This is probably my favourite steakhouse in Hoboken.....Kidding aside, best place to get your bubble tea fix in Hoboken since they use real brewed tea and not powder.Great variety of drinks and just down Washington.
2020-03-06,5,Dirty brown sugar milk tea is the best! Perfect amount of sweetness! Uzi was great at making our drinks and was very kind and welcoming! Definitely the best boba spots in Hoboken!
2020-03-03,5,Amazing customer service, Uzi is the employee of the decade!! The bubble waffle he made was spectacular and the bubble tea has great flavor!
2020-03-03,5,The place has really pretty good bubble tea. No complaints about anything here. The staff was very friendly and super helpful. We ordered drinks for my our family and he made great suggestions on what we should get. Would definitely come back.
2020-02-14,5,I love Gong Cha and the barista with the cap is really cute! Everytime I go there he makes the best drinks.
2020-02-11,5,love this place!! ordered the mango coconut tea and it was perfect, order was quick and fresh. staff is extremely friendly, uzi and kathy are the loveliest!
2020-01-13,3,Got Taro bubble tea and it tasted so chalky and artificial, I threw it out after a few sips. Not a fan.
2019-12-21,5,whether you want a place to study or a place to relax, this is the place to go, it has an elegant cafe vibe and not to mention the most unique bubble tea flavors with a variety in customizable options, this is the place to go. Gong Cha tends to live up to the standards of good bubble tea and good staff. Everything is done with care to bring satisfaction to your taste buds. They also offer WiFi and board games to folks who want to kick back. Would recommend this spot for anyone looking for a cup of tea during this stressful holiday season
2019-10-28,5,I came in today to get my usual herbal jelly milk tea and it was so tasty!!  I like to thank the barista Uzi for making my drink and the staff for amazing customer service. I love the chill vibes in here and the different types of games provided!! AMAZING PLACEE!! 100% would recommend
2019-09-30,1,I ordered thai ice tea and green foam tea with bubbles through ubereats. Worst quality of boba. I am a big fan of bubble tea. But this place makes the worst one. Boba pearls are hard to chew and taste stale.
2019-09-10,2,We've gotten bubble tea here before and it wasn't bad. But this time, it was pretty bad. I had the strawberry matcha tea with strawberry tapioca. The tea was okay, but the tapioca was terrible. It had a weird texture and taste to it. Guess we'll just go back to Kung Fu Tea across the street (not a great option either, but better than this).
2019-08-25,5,The best bubbles I've ever had! Fresh and soft with just the right amount of chew. A plethora of topping to choose from, and many yummy drink flavors. My personal go to order is a large earl grey milk tea with extra bubbles. Staff is always friendly too
2019-08-21,5,Dirty brown sugar milk tea is amazing.The fact that you get to choose the sugar and ice level is a plus.Definitely worth trying.
2019-08-11,1,Nothing is tasteful here. It is not even like laboratory experiments taste, you can only understand the flavor with using all your senses plus 6th sense. Moreover, serving is not good, you can not eat waffle when it is rolled in the another rolled serving shape.
2019-06-24,4,The better bubble tea option in Hoboken. Seems fresher than Kung fu. Wish they had A) decaf tea options, and B) that they were open before 11. It's tea! A morning drink. I often skip going because I want something around 10 and they're not open so I go somewhere else. Very nice staff though, knowledgeable and accommodating.
2019-05-26,4,Located on the main street of Hoboken.Strawberry matcha latte with strawberry boba - their milk is not as good as Boba Guy's but still not too bad. The strawberry boba is a fun consistency - similar to nata de coco (chewy jelly).Dirty brown sugar milk tea with boba - love the salty foam at the top of the drink. Boba isn't warm/chewy as I would have liked, but still pretty ok.  Got this at 70% sugar level and still a tad too sweet. I'd go for 50% next time. There's a groupon+ deal where you can get 30% off your purchase. There's also 10% discount for paying with cash
2019-05-14,3,The boba is inconsistent, it is just another boba shop to me, there is nothing special about it. I bought the BOGO offer during when they first opened and the flavor of the tea was INCREDIBLE, one of the best I have had. After that, it went downhill, it has been very inconsistent with the flavor of the tea and it just seems to be lacking some sort of atmosphere that Kung Fu Tea across the street possesses. I really hope the franchise helps this location out more as other locations are definitely better.
2019-05-12,5,I usually go to the gong cha in garden state mall cause that's closest to me and for some reason I was really craving gong cha od and I didn't even know they opened one up in Hoboken till I passed by it looking for parking! Super friendly staff and they go into detail with how you would want your drink to be made to fit your taste buds. I went with my go to strawberry green tea with regular ice and 30% sugar and it was made perfectly. They also had a sign on the counter to try their new strawberry pearl and I got that with my drink. Tasted sooo good. My little brother also got the Oreo milk tea that he enjoyed very much. Also if you pay with cash you get a 10% off discount with your order!
2019-05-11,5,I don't know why I have gone to NYC for bubble waffles for a couple years even I could eat here. This place is awesome!! Great service and mucho tasty!!
2019-05-05,5,I've found my go-to bubble tea shop for when I need a fix.Gong Cha is by far the best bubble tea spot in all of Hoboken, and I'm so happy they opened on Washington St. The staff are friendly, knowledgeable and pretty quick at making orders. They're very popular and can get slammed at times, but I've never really had to wait long for drinks even when they're busy.You can tell a bubble tea place is good when they can nail down the basics. The milk tea at Kung Fu Tea and Vivi do not compare to Gong Cha, and Gong Cha's taro is on another level. Also, I found out that they freshly brew their tea with tea leaves instead of with powder (you can definitely tell when you drink it).I really appreciate that you can customize your drinks by choosing the sugar level, ice level and milk type. Their toppings are great, and definitely try some of the other toppings (I'm partial to their milk foam and red bean) besides the pearls.The Dirty Brown Sugar Milk Tea with that amazing milk foam is addictive and probably one of the best bubble teas that I've ever had (yes, it really is that good). And I'll be drinking a ton of their mango milk slush over the summer.
2019-04-27,1,Bad service. I will not order again. I ordered hot milk tea. But it's cold when I receive it.
2019-04-15,5,This place has been open a few months but I'm a creature of habit and go to Kung Fu tea across the street. But I recently went to Tokyo and noticed there are lines of 20+ people out the door at all the locations at all times of the day at the Gong cha Tokyo locations and decided to give this place a try. No line! (Not out the door anyway). My friend and I both got the Pearl Milk tea, 50% sugar, less ice. The tapioca was super fresh and I agree with the other reviewer that our drinks tasted less "tea"-y. Delicious all the same. I appreciate their late hours and that they're open until 10pm on a Sunday! There was only 1 girl there working and in the few minutes I was there getting my drink there was 6 customers back to back. She did a great job managing her time. I will definitely come back! PS there's free WiFi!
2019-03-31,5,I was surprised to see that this spot opened. I work a couple of blocks away and had no idea. :P Love their Earl Grey Milk Tea with Pearls. My GO-TO!
2019-03-25,4,Bummed they don't have an almond flavor but I appreciate that the sugar level can be adjusted!
2019-03-05,5,So happy to see Gong Cha here in Hoboken. I would go there all the time in Long Island. The strawberry milk tea is amazing.
2019-03-05,5,Really love this spot for bubble tea! They are unique in their milk foam which adds to the flavor of the bubble tea. Definitely recommend the Taro Milk Slush, Earl Grey Milk Tea with 3Js, and the Milk Foam Brown Sugar. I love that you can customize the sugar level, ice level, and milk options (almond, soy, regular or no milk). Definitely would return!
2019-02-05,5,I love gong cha! They are hands down my favorite milk tea chain. Their boba is always perfectly chewy and their milk tea is great! You can customize how much ice and sugar you went in the tea as well.
2019-01-31,5,Finally there's a Gong Cha in Hoboken now. I don't need to drive all the way to Edison or Garden State Mall for this. The quality and taste of the bobas are great. Also, I love how they give 10% discount for students, as long as you show them your student ID. Def my go to spot for boba now.
2019-01-21,5,Always been a fan of Gong Cha and was super excited when they opened this location. Went in today and got hot milk tea with 50% sugar and my bf got coffee with the foam milk topping. We were both very happy with our drinks and I can definitely tell mine was fresh from tea leaves/bags, not that artificial powder stuff. I'm a milk tea/bubble tea snob and Gong Cha always gives me what I want, no disappointment. Also the owners are extremely friendly! Will be back soon!
2019-01-20,4,Another bubble tea spot in Hoboken but strictly focusing on selling bubble tea compared to the other establishments, I normally test any place with taro with 30% sugar with tapioca and was pleased with the result, went back to try their pearl milk tea and would recommend this, they have WiFi and bathroom. They do accept credit card/cash. If you're a college student let them know and sign up to their membership to get free drinks when you spend over $50 there.  Not really a place to bring big crowds but enough space for like 4 people max and play cards (they do have board games). Parking and bike parking are available on Washington St. No food for sale here. Enjoy!
2019-01-20,5,I have visited this location twice already. Great flavor and variety on bubble teas and the service is fantastic A+++
2019-01-19,5,Great place! I love how friendly the employees were in helping you place your order. The place is fairly small but has a decent seating for the size of the establishment. The drinks themselves were excellent. I like the variety of toppings and add ins there are compared to king fu tea. Will be back!
2019-01-19,5,Great new bubble tea place in Hoboken!  Healthiest bubble tea option around, and the owners were extremely patient and friendly explaining all of their different drinks to us.  We had a great experience, and the bubble tea tasted great.  We will most likely be back and back often!
2019-01-16,5,Cool boba spot that just opened up in Hoboken! Super friendly staff and cozy atmosphere. Doesn't feel squished like a lot of spots in the city -- would definitely recommend the lychee oolong tea! Staff are very helpful if you don't know exactly what you want.
2019-01-16,5,The place is so nice and clean, and the staff was super friendly. The Thai bubble tea and milk tea were delicious!
2019-01-16,5,Gong cha Hoboken is finally open!!! I ordered the brown sugar milk tea, and it was probably the best tasting boba tea I've ever drank!  The tea was fresh, perfectly sweet for me at 50% sugar, and the boba is actually made fresh from scratch daily!  This is my new go to spot for boba tea whenever I am in the Hoboken area, and in my opinion tastes much better than the competition shop across the street.
2019-01-15,5,This is by far my favorite place to get bubble tea and now i have one so close to home! They have an opening offer going on till the 20th of jan for buy one get one any size and i had to go in! Everyone was super nice! Definitely recommend!
2019-01-15,5,Gong Cha Hoboken has finally opened! The grand opening date kept getting pushed back but the day has come! Come in to get buy one get one free (select) drinks until 1/20. So excited that there is another boba contender in Hoboken :D Boba are fresh and not mushy, chewier than those served at the other two boba places on Washington St. The tea is a little sweeter and less tea-ey at this Gong Cha location that the Manhattan ones seem to be, but not by much. I'd recommend half sweet unless you have a super sweet tooth!Come and support the boba scene in Hoboken!
