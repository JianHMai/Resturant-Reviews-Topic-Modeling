2021-10-28,5,Food was great. Cannot remember what I had ha ha, but my date had the ropa vieja and it was worth it. I had a spicy drink that also was good. Will go back soon for sure
2021-10-23,1,I made a reservation at La Isla on 12th Street in Hoboken for Friday, October 22, 2021. It was the last night of my sister's visit from Tulsa, OK and we were planning a very happy ending to a wonderful visit. Distance does not allow us to spend much time together and this was a very special event.I am blind and use a Seeing Eye Dog. When we reached the reservation desk, my reservation was confirmed, but the host informed me that she could not seat us inside with my dog. I said, "Yes, you can. She's a Seeing Eye Dog. The host asked that we wait a minute and a few minutes later, a man came and asked if I had a card to prove that my dog was a service animal. The law is very specific regarding service animals. The person using the service animal CANNOT be asked for ANY documentation for the animal. There are two questions that may be asked. Question One: "Does the animal assist you with a disability?" Question Two: "What TASK is the animal TRAINED to do for you?" The person CANNOT be asked what their disability is.I showed him the ADA regulations from NAGDU (National Association of Guide Dog Users) app. I specifically had him read the Federal Code about asking for documentation of the animal's status as a service animal. He was on one phone calling somebody who never answered while searching for information about service animals on his cell phone. (My sister could see what he was looking at on his phone."As the manager tried to extort documentation from me for my service animal, which is expressly forbidden under Federal code, at least five separate groups were seated as we were subjected to the humiliating experience of having our right to exist in our community questioned.After 15 minutes of being subjected to this humiliation, he agreed to seat us. We stayed and ordered our drinks and meals but being subjected to his interrogation and suspicion had cast a pall over, what should have been, the grand finale of a wonderful visit. I have been gifted with independence by the Seeing Eye Dogs that I have been teamed with for the last 20 years. Ignorant people have tried to impede my quest for independence. This night I stood my ground. We were seated and served. Management did not even offer a drink on the house for the time that my sister and I stood there while they tried to deny me full access with my guide dog.It takes only a few minutes to look up service animal regulations. This should be part of every business owner, manager, and employee's education if they plan to do business with the public.There is a cost to a person with a disability who is made to fight for his/her right to live, work, and - yes - play in the world like any other member of society. This relegates the person to a position "less than". I will no longer accept that position.I cannot comment on the food. It was probably very good, but the attempt to deny me and my guide access to the restaurant left such a bad taste in my mouth that the meal was not enjoyable. My sister lost her appetite and ate very little. Shame on La Isla!Here is the pertinent regulatory information about the two questions that can legally be asked of the service animal handler."When it is not obvious what service an animal provides, only limited inquiries are allowed. Staff may ask two questions: (1) is the dog a service animal required because of a disability, and (2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform. Staff cannot ask about the person's disability, require medical documentation, require a special identification card or training documentation for the dog, or ask that the dog demonstrate its ability to perform the work or task."I am also offering a link ADAt.gov hat details the law about service animals. ada.gov/service_animals_...
2021-10-14,5,Love the food and the ambience, staffs were very attentive and check on your table often, food was great and will be going back for more.
2021-10-08,4,October 2021 - Had the Cuban Ruben ... great sandwich, nice location and Great Service
2021-10-07,5,The best cuban food in the county. Ernesto will serve you as family. The new menu is beautiful and retains the old traditional items. I met my lady here and come with her once a week. I love this place.
2021-10-07,1,I ordered white rice beans and beef stew the rice was like chewing on rocks. The beef stew was great but the only gave me 3 pieces the beans taste like water I wouldn't recommend this place at all this isn't real Spanish food you have to go to jersey city or union city to get great Spanish food
2021-09-17,4,I've gotten take out sandwiches here before as well as dinner dining in and the food is always really good! Not to mention, pretty affordable, which can be a rarity in these parts. My favorite sandwiches are the havana club and the classic cuban.  but the havana club definitely takes first place. The chicken is grilled perfectly and I love the added avocado. Oh, and that multigrain bread is pretty fantastic! Get extra mustard for the Cuban.Some dinner favorites are the Camarones al Ajillo (shrimp in a white wine garlic sauce) and the Pescado con Chutney de Piña y Mango (salmon with mango chutney). Anything seafood is always my go to and these have been great! The shrimp is served almost in a soup (it's the sauce) so I recommend getting the rice as one of your sides. They have tables inside and out and they have a second location uptown that I haven't been to, but it looks a little more upscale where this loc is very casual. They are BYOB and I hear they do a great brunch! That will hopefully be my next visit.
2021-09-16,5,Byob with indoor and outdoor dining. This place always seems to have plenty of patrons who get well fed here. I shared the Cubano and it was great! Nice flat, crisp bread. All the ingredients were great for a sandwich. We came here on a Sunday so had to get their special of ropa vieja. There was plenty of food. We got side of rice and beans as the specials come with two sides. The entire meal was very filling. The meat was super tender.Would definitely come again.
2021-09-12,1,After going there multiple times a month, I will never go back ever!!!. After waiting at a table for 10 minutes, being ignored by all waiters, dirty water fell on my face from the ceiling. Not one employee helped me or asked if I was ok or offered a napkin to wipe the water from my face or clothes. They all just witnessed this and went back to their avoidance of customers!! F**k that place and their subpar service and dirty restaurant! Health code violations left and right!
2021-09-02,4,La Isla is right on the bustling Washington St. Their indoor space is a but small, with tables against one wall and a bunch of stools at a bar. But, they have around 7 tables outside on the sidewalk with umbrellas. If you're looking for an affordable brunch/lunch, you should check it out.They have different specials every day. Since we came on a Saturday, we got the Pollo Asado special, as well as the Media Noche pressed sandwich. The chicken was nice and not dry at all, and came with 2 sides. The sandwich was pretty good - the roast pork was dry, but the rest of the sandwich had great flavors.
2021-08-29,5,I'm a big fan. Reasonable prices, cool vibe, and good food.  It's BYO, so don't forget your drinks, but the good news is I've been here twice and just went two doors down to the Sparrow liquor store to get drinks.
2021-08-29,5,The food and atmosphere is everything you would hope it would be both I side and out. The service is great... and food shows up super fast. La Isla is also right across the street from Carlo's Bakery... just saying!
2021-07-10,2,Honestly, the worst service and the worst food I have had in Hoboken. First of all let's start with the food. Salt, seasoning, are all things you should have in a restaurant if you're going to run it especially if it's a Latin place. I am Latin and have lived in Miami all my life and this does not represent Cuba or Miami in anyway. With that being said, the service was absolutely atrocious. We had a waiter that was a Latin guy, he was also chubby with a tattoo on his left hand, he did not even give us water. He was extremely rude and did not even treat us with any sort of decency. After we asked for the check we were sitting down on the table with all the dirty plate in front of us for 20 minutes. It has really been a terrible experience. Plus, extremely expensive for what you get. The bus boy was kind enough to give us the check and once they did they did not even give us a pen to sign the check so we had to wait another five minutes to wait for a pen. Even though the service was terrible and the food was not great at all, I still gave them a good tip because I'm a decent human being. I will never come back here again!
2021-07-06,4,This is my first time back at this restaurant in a few years and the food did not disappoint. We sat outside, and order ropa vieja, roasted pork, media noche sándwich (very good but the pork was a little dry), papa rellena, and montaditos (excellent). Food: Quality is good, taste is there although I've had better Cuban food, but this is not bad at all. Portions are reasonable, but on the smaller side for the price. Service: Friendly, and very attentive. Our waitress explained the menu and provided with recommendations. Inside they have a nice set up with a few tables and the option to sit at the bar. Price: let's be honest, there only so much you can do to this type of food to elevate so that you can charge $20+ for rice and beans, and a protein. Prices are high for the quantity of food, and the quality of food. Would I go back? Sure! Maybe in a few months, but there's nothing memorable about it, just an average Cuban restaurant. Ps: the best thing I tried were the montaditos, so feel free to order them!
2021-07-03,5,The food was delicious! The ropa vieja, shrimp and as you can see from the pictures it was so good. The desserts were delicious also! The mojitos were great! The service was very nice and the waitress gave us excellent service!
2021-06-27,1,Service is terrible not the employees fault.. I had a steak sandwich seem the meet was cook with water no flavor.. i ask for cafee con leche and was not warm or hot enough. Oh well make you choice.. i wont be bak!
2021-06-21,3,I have been wanting to try this restaurant for some years now.  I decided to try it with my mom and we both enjoyed the food.  The servers are friendly and to the point.  This restaurant does not serve alcohol.
2021-06-08,4,The restaurant was much smaller than it appeared online. The ambiance is relaxed. Authentic Cuban music in the background and artwork honoring the legendary Celia Cruz, Theofolo Stevenson and other notable Cuban heros adorn the walls. The food is authentic Cuban, well seasoned and quite tasty. Portions were average to small. Only drawbacks, restroom entrance is through the kitchen, wait staff could've been a bit more attentive. Overall an enjoyable dining experience.
2021-05-30,3,I ordered a cubano sandwich, which had pulled pork, ham, pickles, and sauce on a pressed bun. The flavor was decent, but the pork was a bit dry. I wish they used a slightly fattier cut of pork, which would make the meat so much more tender and juicy.
2021-05-26,5,Wow! Probably the best Oxtail Stew I've ever eaten! I could not stop talking about the sauce and how well flavored it was. The oxtail was cooked perfectly where some of the meat was just falling off the bone. I might be eating here every Monday since it's the special for the day!All the food was delicious. I really enjoyed my dinner here and the atmosphere was great! Very family oriented and a lot of Cuban charm decorated throughout the place. Definitely a staple for me.
2021-05-21,2,The food at this place is mostly okay but overpriced. Except for the Cuban sandwich: that one is terrible AND overpriced. Two out of the four times I've ordered delivery from here they missed at least one item (they still billed it!). When I called to let them know after the 2nd time, they tried to blame me for their incompetence and were very rude. Not worth the aggravation.
2021-05-19,5,This place is a staple in Hoboken. Has always been authentic Cuban food. Great food and great service.
2021-05-11,4,This was by the clinic my parents went to. We were quickly seated outside for lunch. I had the chance to go inside, which smelled wonderfully of deliciously cooked meals. We shared some yuca fries with shaved cheese on top. They were crunchy and soft at the same time. I'm usually not a fan as yucca fries tend to be on the dryer side, but these ones were really good. They even gave me pure chopped garlic in oil as the dipping sauce. My dad had the fried chicken sandwich, which came with a side of plantain chips. The chicken sandwich was good, but nothing extraordinary. These chips were very thin and crispy with a perfect amount of salt. My mom got the chicken lunch special, which she devoured. I got the ropa vieja, which was very good as well.The prices were pretty good for lunch. I would come back again! Not quite a 5 star because no one came to refill our water. Oh and the coffee was really good! Not sure if they do refills, but I would've definitely gotten another if it offered free refills!
2021-03-28,5,I've only tried their sandwiches but really enjoyed them! Great price for the portion size, and tastes great. Would definitely recommend!
2021-03-08,5,Empanadas and potato balls are out of this world. Thought the Cuban sandwich was just ok; Pork was a little dry.
2021-03-03,5,The interior was on the upscale side. Great location for a date. The waiter was extremely generous. He knew the menu well and gave great recommendations. We tried the steak (soooo good!) and the empanadas. The Cuban soft drinks are really good a must try for sure. The cubanos were a little on the bland side but nothing a kick from the table hot sauce couldn't fix. And just the atmosphere is wonderful. Everyone was socially distant. Seemed pretty popular.
2021-03-02,5,What can I write about that hasn't already been said: A family owned business which was featured on Diners, Drive ins and Dives and making incredible Cuban food in the heart of Hoboken. Did I nail it?This was a cute diner a long time ago, now it's decorated for a casual Cuban eatery. I would have loved to sit and had the French Toast but I gotta go with the staple, El Cubano.I've had Cubano sandwiches years ago in Miami, where can you get one in New York, Havana Central? It's okkkk but I want the real deal. Well it's being served right here at La Isla Restaurant. My El Cubano was perfect. I'm sure they're adding lard to the dough, That spongy, classic bread. The marinated pork roast. Now grill and press it with ham, cheese, and pickles. La Isla Restaurant, I thank you for keeping the tradition alive and making authentic Cuban delicacies.
2021-02-06,5,I have been ordering from La Isla for years as we live across the street and am never disappointed. They have now added family meals and are favorably priced. The skirt steak and fried yucca are my favorite.
2021-01-21,5,Great food. Moderately priced. Definitely going back. Try their batidos. Made to perfection
2021-01-07,5,This is our favorite Cuban restaurant!  We like to go to both locations in Hoboken, because the food is amazing at both.  Always get a papa rellena with salsa ranchero with your order!This downtown location can fill up real quick, so if there is no available seating, also try their uptown location.
2020-12-14,5,This place was amazing! It is a small byob Cuban restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The food is very authentic, tasty, and delicious!! We were pleasantly surprised and pleased. The service was quick and easy and the experience more enjoyable! We definitely recommend this place if you want yummy authentic Cuban food!
2020-12-12,5,La Isla may look small but the flavors are BIG!! It is our go to spot in Hoboken for lunch. The papa rellena is delicious, that is our go to appetizer, I love the Croqueta Preparada sandwich.
2020-12-01,5,Best Cuban sandwiches and food in town. Staff is always so friendly too. Shout out to the cooks too for making food so delicious! Always a great experience here. Saludos!
2020-11-30,5,My family often comes to Hoboken and I highly recommend you stop here. They have amazing empanadas, especially the beef and chicken ones. It's a cute little place with a very friendly atmosphere.
2020-11-24,4,This is a tiny Cuban place which makes some really nice dishesTheir French toasts area really good and we have been ordering here for some years nowThey open really early in the morning so great options for breakfast/brunchCuba chino is really good tooYet to try lunch/dinner items...Their phone operators can be a little better-- ordering online is better..
2020-10-26,5,Funny story -- I found out about La Isla when in a cab, complaining about the lack of good Cuban food in NYC (I'm from Miami and have ~*expectations*~). The cab driver overheard me and said, "Clearly you haven't been to La Isla in Hoboken. It's the best." Well, sir, challenge accepted. I made it my mission to get over to La Isla to try their Cuban cuisine, and I was not disappointed! Is it better than Miami? No, I can't say that. BUT is it the best and most authentic Cuban I've had since moving to the city? Yes. And I've tried Cafe Habana (granted, it's a fusion restaurant), La Cubana (RIP), Sophie's, Coppelia, Cuba Restaurant (seriously, that's its name) and more. I will be back!
2020-10-06,5,Best tasty food, great delivery too!  El Cubano, plantanos, chicken empanada are some of our faves
2020-10-03,5,I had this as a take out. Ordered it and received it within 15 minute despite it being a Saturday night. I haven't had much experience with Cuban food but this had me hooked. Looking forward to go back as I do live in the area! My mother especially loved the piono (great balance of sweetness). The restaurant staff all wore masks and were extremely friendly/warming. Can't wait to come back and try more items! As a bonus - the smells coming from the kitchen made my mouth water
2020-09-27,5,Outdoor seatings are good!! The size of the Churassco seems to be much smaller than before (and about half the regular size for regular menu) on brunch. I'd come for dinner and a get a full size, if you are into it. Otherwise, Everything is Great and Satisfying!! We have been customers for many years. The food is always great, from coffee to salad, sandwiches and steak. The waiters and waitresses are friendly and nice!! We LOVE La Isla! Highly recommended!!;)
2020-09-20,5,My favorite Cuban restaurant in Hoboken. Great dishes, delivery is always on time (or even earlier than quoted). Happy that they are still around - I am sure doing my best to keep them in business with my orders.
2020-09-18,5,What a gem! Authentic Cuban fare. Food and service was top notch. Truffle yuca fries? Omg! BYOB, liquor store on same block, so convenient. Just go. Highly recommend.
2020-09-06,5,My go to place for brunch. It's funny that now because of Covid-19 they have more space available due to outdoor seating.
2020-08-31,4,Great food! Great portions! Great price! My only complaint would be the service as our waitress never returned and the busser had to tend to us. He was very pleasant. Will definitely return.
2020-08-22,2,I feel bad writing these low-rated reviews especially during Covid but I have to be true to myself. I'm sure they're just going through difficult times as the rest of the world and might have to give them a try again later...Came to a cuban place so of course I had try their classic cuban sandwich!El Cubano- 6/10. nothing special. it says garlic mojo sauce but I really didn't taste anything at all. the cuban bread was delicious though.Empanada (beef)-5/10. again nothing special, it was pretty dry and piece-y from what I remember. Had to use a lot of hot sauce.Outdoor seating available! No wait times really.Service was exceptional, I have to give them that.
2020-08-10,1,Aye Isla....where do we start? While the outdoor seating was nicely arranged, the guy who sat us didnt wipe our table with the spray disinfectant that I saw the female server using. Any ceviche served in a glass/cup feels like a rip off to me. This ceviche was really a shrimp gazpacho, watery, no lime flavor. I ordered the ropa vieja and it was the first time ive ever seen it made in a red sauce. The sauce had a smokey/pulled pork taste rather than traditional cuban beef prepared w sofrito and garlic. Although the menu says shredded flank steak, I wanted to ask if it was pork bc it had that consistency. THE RICE WAS A FAIL. No flavor, dry, just cooked well enough that the grains werent crunchy. Black beans were ok but...the horrible Pan con lechon my wife had was dry and felt like it was prepared the day before. Finally its BYOB so we couldnt even have a mojito or beer to wash the meal away.
2020-08-08,5,A cute, family-owned Cuban restaurant situated on bustling and lively Washington St! Outdoor seating first-come first-serve with indoor open for takeout and restrooms. This was my first time here and the menu had so many options. I decided to go with the Saturday daily special ($14) which was roasted pork with two sides: yellow rice and maduro! The maduro was super delicious and probably my favorite part. Wanted to try the empanadas but they looked a bit pricey. If I go again, I'll try it next time though! Waiters aren't super talkative but pretty friendly. Food comes out really fast. Overall, a great and quiet place to eat in Hoboken if you don't want to sit in the noisy bar areas.
2020-08-07,4,La Isla is a small Cuban Restaurant in Hoboken.  For appetizers here I had the beef empanada, papa rellena, and the yuca frita.  The beef empanada was packed with meat, and it was good.  But, the meat could of had more Cuban seasoning.  The yuca frita which is fried cassava with Manchego cheese was not good!  It barely had any Manchego cheese on it!  Skip that appetizer!  The best out of all 3 appetizers was the papa rellena.  It was very good!  All 3 entrees here I had were all very good!  I had the skirt steak, ropa vieja, and the beef stew.  They gave a nice piece of meat for the skirt steak, and there was not one chewy piece.  The ropa vieja was nice and tender,  and the beef stew melted in my mouth!  The beef stew was the best out of the 3 entrees I had here!  For desserts I had the tres leches, coconut mango cheesecake, and the pionono.  The tres leches was horrible!  It was not like your typical tres leches cake.  It was  over saturated with rum, and it was topped with merengue instead of its traditional whipped cream frosting.  I wish they would make the tres leches the traditional Cuban way!  Definitely skip it!  The coconut mango cheesecake was good, and the pionono was delicious!  The pionono was a sponge cake filled with dulce de leche.  If you like caramel, you will love the pionono!  It's my favorite dessert here!  Overall,  I really enjoyed the Cuban food here except for the yuca frita and the tres leches cake.  I recommend La Isla in Hoboken for Cuban food!
2020-07-22,5,This place is amazing. The food is so delicious . We ordered. Coctel de camarones crab cakes and yuca fryes with túrtufa oil just for appetizers omg it was amazing   So delicious
2020-06-29,5,One of the top restaurants in Hoboken! MUST try! I have tried all of their sandwiches so far and all of them taste great. Their sandwich bread is so crispy and cooked perfectly with butter I can just eat the bread. Cuban sandwich is still my fav. The combination of thinly sliced pickles, ham, and cheese are just spectacular. Their fried ball is good for appetizer as well. BYOB.
2020-06-24,5,This is a typical Cuban restaurant.  Great food and good service.  They sell the best potato balls stuffed with ground beef.  And very good "empanadas" beef patties.It is expensive, but it's worth it.
2020-04-29,5,Our spot for years to come! La Isla has been apart of our lives for years and it will continue on that road. My husband and I made our first visit eight years ago to celebrate our two year dating anniversary. I fell in love with their Papa Rellena on the first bite. I love Cuban cuisine and have tried many places in and out of state, and never had a Papa Rellena as delicious as La Isla's. Everything on their menu is delicious, I love their salmon in particular, while my husband prefers their churrasco. We have nothing but great things to say about La Isla!
2020-04-04,5,Awesome spot uptown. Cute, quaint, and perfect for a date night. Food is on point and feels very very authentic, made with love from the chefs.
2020-03-24,4,Kind of like an old-school small diner meets a Cuban restaurant. I might have only sat down a few times to eat. My two favorite dishes are the roasted chicken with moro (black beans, rice and pork) & the Cuban sandwich with a Papa Rellena (Potato Ball). The Cuban Sandwich is likely the best item on the menu, and if you never been here before it is the first thing you have to try. The roasted chicken doesn't sound like much, but you add in the moro there, it is fan-tastic. A must try. I have rarely, if ever, been disappointed in the dish.My only knock on the place is the customer service. If you are the owner, I implore you to work on the customer service skills of your wait staff. I often call in and they aren't very nice people - not rude - just like they couldn't care less about you. They are brusque, and cold. I'm not a first time customer going off here, I have been eating at your place for 25 years. Sit them down and have them read this. They need to be nicer. I mean I haven't walked in once and seen a smile on anyone's face or a nice greeting. Ever. The only guy I see that works pretty hard is Caesar who presses the Cuban sandwiches - and he isn't even a waiter. If I walk in, and sees im waiting a long time for a wait staff to notice me, he will jump in and help.There have been many times that I walk in and i'm treated like i'm invisible. I have to literally get their attention. So that's why I would knock it down from 5 stars to 4. They just aren't nice enough.
2020-03-05,5,New location that is much nicer than the original. Love the pork chops and fried yucca. Good selection of local draft beer and have a great happy hour during the week offering half price drinks until 7.
2020-02-22,1,Racist waitress in who works there on Saturday mornings should be disciplined! No greeting, no service and a blank stare was received by us (asian couple).  As soon as Caucasian patrons walked in, she did the exact opposite. Absolutely appalling! Please do not visit this establishment until she is removed. Very unfortunate reflection for this well known establishment.
2020-02-20,4,The comfortable and familial environment at La Isla makes it a great place to grab a casual meal any time of the day. We had a very nice breakfast. The Huevos Rancheros were delicious and flavorful. I liked the additional texture of the tortilla chip bowl. All of the ingredients were fresh, however, there was a small piece of plastic that we found in the dish. Slightly worrisome, but probably does not happen often. The French toast part of the signature stuffed French toast was delicious. Yet I felt disappointed by the stuffing. There was too much of it, making it sickly. It was supposed to be a combination of cream cheese and guava, but it tasted more like strawberry yogurt. Next time, I would go with the plain French toast. Overall, I liked the personality of the restaurant and they also had wonderful espresso drinks. I would love to go back for lunch or dinner.
2020-02-04,5,Please do yourself a favor and visit La Isla!! They make the most amazing, fluffy flavorful pancakes I've ever had. The huevos rancheros were delicious and plentiful. Their fries are not greasy, light and also amazingly delicious. Wow! What a gem. I ate everything before I could even take a pic! The service was great friendly! Will definitely be coming back.
2020-01-18,4,I went to this restauntamt with friends, after a long trip from upstate! Following one of my roomies recommendation. Food was ok! Garlic tostones were very nice, chicken soup as well! Lechón asado(day specialty ) was not that great and the black beans soup they can do it much better. The sandwich cubano was good.
2020-01-13,3,La Isla has been on my radar for years, but i was a bit let down. Specifically by the service. The majority of the staff ignored us or basically left us alone on what seemed like a pretty smooth and low-key Weds night. Just to receive water or the check seemed to take years. As for the food, i wasnt impressed. The coffee was bitter and bland. The Yucca fries were overcooked. However, i appreciated the truffle and manchego cheese on them. In fact, i think they should add more manchego ! Unfortunately, if you steer away from meat, La Isla isnt the place for you. I noticed that quickly when i saw there were few and far veggie or seafood options that didnt have some form of pork on them. However, the cuban vegetarian sandwhich was good. Loved the freshness and flavor of it. In fact, in stead of the multigrain bread i wish theyd put it on the cuban bread that all of the other sandwhiches were on. The black bean hummus is unique, i loved it, i think they should do more with it in other dishes going forward. Ill keep an eye out for any changes for La Islas menu - if i can eat anything on there, id gladly give it another shot in the future.
2020-01-08,3,Yah classic staple of hoboken idk why honestly. For breakfast the place runs well. Service is constantly flowing, orders getting pumped out quickly, food is fresh. Coffee is great. However for dinner..? Yikes. There's plenty of staff to handle the 3-4 tables they get but holy crap is it hard to get anyone to pay attention, take your order, clearl the obviously finished plates or coffee cups from the table, get to go boxes or the check. The girls behind the counter had to keep grabbing someone's attention to come to our table.Cuban sandwich was D R Y my dudes. A pickle sliced so thin I opened my sandwich twice to double check there even was one. No mustard or anything. Cheese looked stale like it was sitting cooked for a while and then reheated. The meat was flavorless and again D R Y.Yucca was good but if you're going to advertise that it comes with manchiego cheese on top then let's go for it shall we? Not this sprinkled garnish.Platano maduros were good. Again espresso at the end was good. Even if I had to literally ask 3 people to order it. Just eh. Maybe they should hire more attentive wait staff or just keep open for breakfast. As far as Cuban spots go this is low on my list. Artisano in Union City got your back if you're feelin the same disappointment I am.
2019-12-15,5,Visiting New York and Hoboken for a week, we ate a lot of tasty, cultural meals in both big and small restaurants. And then, we had breakfast (yes breakfast) at La Isla Cuban Restaurant in Hoboken, New Jersey.  We arrived early one Friday morning, tired and hungry. First, each cup of coffee is made by hand and quite excellent, rich and flavorful and hot.  Then some of us tried the Cubanciano, espresso with cinnamon and whipped cream. Probably one of the most delicious cups of coffee I've ever had.  For the meal, one in our party had steak and eggs with rice and beans. Steak was medium and perfect. Rice and beans (choice of white rice or brown rice) completed a deliciously balanced meal. Another person had the French toast (not the stuffed French toast, just French toast) and found it both fluffy and tasty. I had poached eggs and breakfast potatoes with Cuban bread toast (like a baguette).  Service was prompt and attentive. The restaurant was clean and well staffed. It was probably the best meal we had on the trip, which is saying quite a bit.
2019-12-11,5,La Isla is one of  my favorite spot in Hoboken. It is perfect for dates or catching up with a friend. Their space is limited so I wouldn't recommend this as an option for large groups. Their ropa vieja and pollo espanico (spinach) are my go-to's. If you're ordering apps, make sure you get the croquetas. Their food is authentic and the closest to home cooked Cuban food in Hoboken. AND it's BYOB!
2019-11-19,5,Absolutely love this place! Delicious food, great service, amazing prices!
2019-11-14,5,We ate breakfast here two days of our visit. Humble, quality food prepared well in a relaxing, warm atmosphere. You can't beat the price and service for what you get!Our family of 4 tried several different omelets. Their speciality ones were both very good. I was partial to the plantain omelet, the plantains were slightly sweet but you felt like you were still eating a savory breakfast. The chorizo was very good as well. Chorizo is a strong flavor so that is what you get! The side buttered cuban toast is excellent and you get a large serving of it. The breakfast sandwich is solid, I wanted a break from cheese and that hit the spot, big enough to split and eat half for a small breakfast and half for a snack in a couple hours. My son got the french toast and the warmth of the cinnamon was excellent! I also had to try the guava stuffed toast and it is everything everyone says it is. I thought it could easily be a dish that could be overly sweet, but was so happy that is wasn't over the top sweet---perfect just as it is served. Creamy inside, crisp exterior, no need for maple syrup. When we come back we will be back at La Isla!
2019-11-09,5,Miami native says this cuban food might be the best in north nj after years of looking. Black beans are my test item and they are stellar here. Everything else (picadillo, papa rellena) is worth any wait and tight tables. New regular.
2019-11-04,5,Excellent authentic Cuban Food, I have been to both the  down town Jersey City and Hoboken. Highly recommend
2019-10-10,2,Not a great experience at all. 5 servers for 2 tables. Sit down. Wait an actual 10 mins with menus closed waiting to order. Croquettes are refried and grabbed from the display case and brought to the kitchen. Churrasco steak cooked to well done despite asking for medium rare. Water never filled and never attended to after receiving food. Rice/beans/maduros were good though. Meal finished and no one giving check. Waited a bit while 5 servers chit chatted behind the counter. Eventually had to get up and ask for the check disturbing the staff from their conversation. Supposed to be easy dinner became a waste of $. The Cuban or Rumba are much better options with better atmosphere and serve drinks.
2019-10-03,4,Hoboken residents, both past and present, have spoken highly about the original La Isla, and that sold me on the spot even before I put a foot inside. It's a narrow cozy restaurant that offers homey Cuban fare not too far from the PATH station. I was disappointed that La Isla was essentially all out of their specials even though it was just a little past 7 PM on a weeknight. Oh well, you snooze, you lose I suppose.After the waiter mentioned it as one of their most popular dishes, I ordered the camarones enchilado ($19) which consisted of sauteed jumbo shrimp with onions, garlic, olives, peppers, and a Creole sauce. The two sides I selected were fried yuca and maduro; the other options were rice and beans. The shrimp were indeed jumbo, were cooked well, and were quite palatable with a touch of spice. The sides were great too. The guava and cream cheese empanada was a sweet way to cap off the meal. I wasn't sure if I could fit in a slice or something, but the pocket-sized empanada came to the rescue.  Our trio had a awesome evening here. Of course the company counts for a lot, but the delicious Cuban eats had much to do with that as well! Hope to try out the breakfast/brunch next time I'm in the area!
2019-09-28,5,This is our go-to breakfast spot. Food is always top notch and the service is friendly and quick. We love it here! the Cuban is my favorite- best Cuban I've ever had!
2019-09-22,5,Always a line to get in but well worth it! The food is incredible! Can't wait to try the uptown location.
2019-09-20,2,What a sad experience it was to come to this place. As a Cuban that recently moved to NJ and misses Miami a lot, I came to La Isla thinking that I was going to find authentic food, a warm treatment, but instead I found terrible service from the staff and food that is so far away from authentic. No one said "good morning" as my husband and I came in, no one said good bye, thanks for coming, come again, no one came to ask us if we wanted anything else, how the food was, nothing. Havana and Miami do not meet in Hoboken, nothing farther from the truth.
2019-09-17,2,Really was expecting more from this place, specially after reading all the reviews. Food was not even hot, didn't really have much flavor. When I go to a latin restaurant I really expect dishes full of flavor but they did not meet my expectations. The only good thing was the mango smoothie I had.
2019-09-07,5,Loved the brunch specials though I will recommend that one orders from the specialty cocktails and not the brunch specials. Loved the decor ...
2019-09-02,5,Absolutely amazing food , I will be back before I leave town .  We had the Empanadas and the garlic chicken . It was the best ..
2019-08-24,5,Let this be a PSA announcement about La Isla's Monday oxtail stew special. Only on this one day a week are we privileged to ordered this flavor packed and tender dish. It literally falls off the bone and has a rich taste that's a balance of cumin spice, tomatoes, onions, and oxtail. You can it for lunch or dinner, because the special runs all day, but supply may run dry by dinner. An order comes with 2 sides from a choice of beans, plantains, rice, or yuca. If you come alone, have a seat at the counter, else grab a table, but do yourself a favor and order this dish.
2019-08-09,5,I was meeting a friend in Hoboken and needed to find a good brunch restaurant. Everything seemed relatively mediocre but La Isla caught my eye. It is a very small space and first come, first serve. They offer authentic Cuban food and are very well priced. I had their churrasco and would go back and order it every time.
2019-08-02,1,This review thatI am posting today I am writing to the owner of this business. I know you were on the food Network and it's a shame what's happening to your restaurant that you put such hard work into.Your staff is horrible. I went in by myself for a late dinner and basically sat myself down. One of your waitresses who is Hispanic heavyset, I am trying to describe her I'm sorry I did not get her name I'm not trying to be critical. Totally ignored me, asked me if I was eating dinner and told me there was no food left. I asked her what do you mean there is no food left? Yes she told me we have no specials. And I told her I am here for dinner I don't want lunch specials. I had no idea what this woman was talking about. Once I set myself down she totally ignored me and not only her all the waitresses and waiters there ignored me and where taking care of everyone else that had more people in their party, but since I was there alone by myself I guess they figured they weren't going to get a good tip and they ignored me all through my meal. Finally one of the waiters comes by asked me what I wanted and I told him that I wanted the palomilla steak with white rice and black beans.  When my meal came to my table, the palomilla steak was grilled and burnt. if you are Cuban you are familiar with this cut of steak. It has no fat so you cannot put it on a grill because it will dry out. This type of steak needs to be fried in a frying pan not on a grill. Well needless to say, my steak was burnt and dry. Your beans were very good but the service is absolutely horrendous. Your staff totally ignore me through my meal. When I was ready for the bill, I had to call several people to please give me the bill so I could pay for my meal. I had to do this several times because every time I asked them for the bill they totally ignored me and kept on going. This is so sad because I am Cuban and I would like to see your business succeed. The people you have working here are horrendous and they're making you look bad. Hire a good manager that cares about your business and the quality of food they are serving and how they treat your customers. the people you have working there now are horrible and they do not care at all about your restaurant or your customers. I am sorry but I'm being blunt honest. I had been there before to dine years ago and I did not get treated like this and the food was much better. I don't know what the heck happened. I will not be coming back. And by the way you're charging $3.50 for one ham croquette. I know you're Cuban and I know that you know this price is ridiculous. Take the Fame that you made and make something good and positive of it and care for the quality of food you put out and for your customers.
2019-07-11,5,Amazing food in a really cool space that makes you feel like your in Cuba.  Service is also always good!
2019-07-02,5,Delicious food, cubans and steak sandwiches are superb.  Great iced coffee and the prices are decent. Will go back soon.
2019-06-29,2,I am Cuban and i love Cuban food! This place has good food but was very disappointed with their customer service, I asked for a morir soñando and they gave it to me a glass cup that was very small and they usually give it in a plastic cup to go which has a lot more quantity. I asked if I can replace it to go and they looked uninterested in making my request possible and told me that now the owner wants to place the beverages in a glass cup but when I looked around I saw other people with the plastic cups. Good food but bad customer service!
2019-06-03,5,My husband and I were on vacation and stumbled upon this place. The food was delicious! It taste homemade and so authentic. I even ordered arroz con leche which was also amazing!
2019-06-03,5,The food here is delicious! It's a small cozy restaurant with great authentic Cuban food. No complaints!
2019-05-27,5,Welcoming atmosphere and amazing food... What more could you ask for... Empanadas were great and the pork plate was delicious.
2019-05-25,5,La Isla is without question one of our favorite restaurants in Hoboken! Our preference is always downtown because it's byob and it's a cozy little place with some outdoor seating and an old school counter top to sit at inside. The one uptown is of equal food quality, much larger space and has a full bar. Either one you choose, you can't go wrong! The food is exceptional! Of course we have our staples that we must get when we come, but have had quite a few menu items for dinner/lunch as well as brunch and everything is great! The black bean hummus is outrageous, it comes with crispy plantain chips and never lasts more then a few minutes! Also, the yuca fritas with manchego cheese and truffle oil is so tasty. You must, must, try the tasajo con boniato!!! It was featured on diners, drive-ins and dives and is crispy shredded beef that melts in your mouth.
2019-05-21,5,My husband is obsessed with this place.  He is a foodie, and this has to be in his top 3 places that he CRAVES on a regular basis.   For quite some time I have argued out of going here, initially thinking (assuming) there are too many unhealthy options on the menu.That was until I finally gave in, and had their Avocado salad.  It may sound crazy that THAT is why I am adding 5 stars, but that also means its THAT good.  I love tomatoes (good ripe tomatoes), and the few times we have ordered from La Isla they have not disappointed with this salad - ripe tomatoes, hearty slices of avocado, a touch of red onion, and drizzle of olive oil.  Simple and perfect.My husband's go-to is the pork chop meal, which i have to admit also looks tasty.  I have also had their crab cake appetizer which is to die for - a creamy corn veggie mixture with a bit of heat, topped with two delicious crab cakes.Overall highly recommend!
2019-05-20,1,I ordered to go today and order a ceviche de camarones tostones and rice and beans the beans where hard and to top it off the ceviche has literally two shrimps cut in pieces  the tostones where soggy they put the garlic sauce in it and by the time i got home its spilled the mariquitas that go with the ceviche where burnt i will not be returning there again
2019-05-19,2,Update in 2019. Service here continues to drop day by day. The only reason people return here is for the food
2019-05-11,3,The sandwich was good! I love the fried plantains. The only downside was the staff who served us. He's not very friendly. Like he's already tired of working. Plus he gets sarcastic as well.
2019-04-27,5,Hands down one of my favorite Cuban places, it's a whole in the wall quick stop but has some seating to dine in. We went here one Saturday night and it was delicious and hearty. I am half Latina and so I'm picky with my Spanish food because I grew up eating the good stuff but this was really good.
2019-04-23,5,My family and I enjoyed the Cuban food  breakfast very much ! Friendly service and lively Spanish salsa music really added to a great experience!! We will be back for dinner soon !!
2019-04-19,5,Very good food very friendly good coffee been around  Been around for a long time it was the only Cuban restaurant in Hoboken that I've been going to for a long time and they fully very great and it desserts reasonable price to
2019-04-13,5,LOVE their food! Amazing traditional Cuban food. Their rice and beans is to die for with their fabulous sides. Last time, I ordered black beans, white rice, and a side of maduros plus tostones. The price is great also for the area.
2019-04-07,5,We love to visit places from Triple D. Guy was definitely right about this place. I can not recommend the Papa Rellenas enough!!! The Baby Arugula salad was delicious. Hidden gem in Hoboken. But if you want alcohol, bring it with you.
2019-04-06,4,authentic Cuban food. Friendly staff. And good food. Their coffee is amazing. Would also recommend the garlic shrimp.
2019-03-31,5,I love this place. The food is fresh and authentic. GET THE CUBAN SANDWICH    It's BYOB here, which (to me) is another plus, although their uptown location has another bar (I'm highly partial to BYOB spots AND their is a liquor/wine shop on the next block). At peek times there's always a wait here-good sign. It's worth the wait for delicious Cuban food. They have daily specials that do run out, unfortunately. Kind of a bummer but there are always good options in case this happens.
2019-03-30,4,Decor is nothing fancy but the food is very good, the service attentive without being obtrusive and not too noisy.   Try the grouper or braised dry cured shredded beef.  Outstanding!!!!
2019-03-30,3,I started coming here around 15 years ago- and how this restaurant had changed! I used to love to come here because back then it was quite hard to find good Cuban food. In the last five years, however, the food was a bit of a disappointment. If you are looking to try any of the daily specials, I recommend to come before 4:00 because at my most recent visit, I was looking to get a special but they were out. If you are looking for a place to eat with not such high expectations for taste, this place can meet the criteria. But for a more fancy dining experience, La Isla is not necessarily a good destination.
2019-03-29,5,Garlic chicken breast and the skirt steak are AMAZING! Everything we have here is VERY good. Love their authentic Cuban cuisine. Chef Omar is the best! I wouldn't recommend any other restaurant for Cuban cuisine. La Isla is number one! It will not disappoint. The service is always friendly and great! Small spot but well worth it.
2019-03-27,5,Small place but comfortable. We had 4 at out table which is the maximum any one table can hold. Food was delicious. Three of us had the El Cubano sandwich which was great. One had the chick dish found on the special list every day (it's that special). He said it was great. Came with rice and black beans. We shared fried plantains and they were a nice treat. Staff was very friendly and bill for the four of us at lunch was about 45. We will be back!
2019-02-19,5,Walked in and within 30 seconds, a team member named Stephanie, who even though was assisting another patron, managed  to greet me with a smile and assure that my experience was exception. I love going to this location as opposed to the downtown location, in addition to overall aesthetic, the service never disappoints. Great job Stephanie! -Matt
2019-02-08,5,And another Triple D location checked off the list (or added to the map, whatever).  La Isla is one of those reasons I enjoy driving out of my way to try these establishments I probably would never happen upon.Came in for dinner on a Wednesday night.  Coincidentally my coworker called who used to live in Hoboken, so when I said I was here he gave glowing praise, so I knew this was going to hopefully go well.Unfortunately I came in too late where the specials for the day had already been exhausted (this place gets pretty busy I could tell) so I settled on a Sopa de Pollo and then the Churrasco sandwich.Everything was pretty much great.  The soup was filled with hearty chunks of carrots & chicken, with a nice sized wedge of corn. It went well with some bread and was really good for soup. The Churrasco sandwich was the highlight though.  I've never had potato sticks on a steak sandwich, but the combination with the onions works!  Steak was cooked to order, and the seasoning was spot on.  The bread was also nice and firm able to hold what could have ended up as a mess all together.I would definitely come back here again, as there looked to be a lot of things on the menu worth giving a try.  Seeing the other reviews and photos of what they have to offer, I have no problem giving this place high marks.
2019-02-05,5,La Isla never disappoints! You can't go wrong here. The food is consistently great and love that it's byob! I'm addicted to their tostones. I'm also a coffee/espresso addict and recommend the "cubaccino"!
2019-01-30,2,Normally this is a great spot. But I would not recommend coming here before they close.. got here at 9:30 and there was no food left. Only one empanada and I was told the specials were all gone. So I ordered my normal standby ( chicken with spinach) which normally is great but todaywas completely drowning in sauce. I also ordered green beans and they were terrible, too salty and bathed in Butter :(
2019-01-24,4,Authentic Cuban cuisine that's close to home. Staff is always friendly and food is very fresh. Great coffee, Latin music. Only thing is their prices are a little steep. $3 for 1 croqueta, which means lunch or dinner can get pretty pricey. Love their downtown location though, it's pretty similar to a Cuban cafeteria like the ones in Miami. I guess being Hispanic and having lived in a heavily populated Cuban area, I know there is better Cuban food out there with fairer pricing
2019-01-22,5,Best Cuban place ever!! Please get the Stuffed French Toast during breakfast! Soo good!Location: Located in Hoboken. It is always packed. Few seatings inside but there is usually a line. Simple yet typical spanish restaurant. Service: they are so nice, patient and kind!Food: Well everything here is good! But you must order the STUFFED FRENCH TOAST: omg there is guava jelly and cheese inside the french toast! What can you asked for! So good! Only brunch tho! CUBAN SANDWICH: good tho! Cheese and pernil is a good combination! Melts into your mouth. The bread is shiny because they put butter on it and got pressed! MONTADITOS: grilled shrimp on a tostones! So delicious! TRES LECHES: this is my least favorite, just too sweet! Price rating: 5 out of 10. Not bad for good portionsEverything is good but get the Stuffed French toast!
2019-01-20,5,This place is amazing. Walking in it looks like a run down diner but the food is authentic and so tasty. I asked the waitress for a recommendation and I honestly didn't know what she said but went for it anyway. It was a creamy chicken dish that was SO DELICIOUS I can't even describe. It's also BYOB. Amazing experience!
2019-01-15,4,This is my favorite Cuban restaurant in the area.I love the food,the cozy seating and the warm service.The brunch here is spectacular and most everything is so good that I have a hard time deciding.If you can only eat one thing from here,it should be the stuffed french toast.You have to have a sweet tooth to appreciate it in its enormity but in case you dont, there is plenty of other tasty dishes to choose from.The huevos rancheros is a pretty solid dish which is another favorite, the spicy tomato sauce and eggs and black beans is a party in the mouth! The sides- the sweet plantains are a must-taste. Its been a while since I got back here since I moved out of the area but there have definitely been times when I have an indescribable craving for that French toast. I will be visiting the next time I am back in Hoboken!
2018-12-28,5,Love this place!  We went pre baby and have been several times with a 1.5 year old.  Amazing experience both times.  The food is superb, ambience is wonderful, and the people who work there, especially Alex, were so friendly and kind to us and our son.  We can't recommend it highly enough!
2018-12-28,5,Tight place, but a great twist on Cuban-American Food. Their fried yucca topped with truffles and Manchego are to die for. There hand pressed sandwiches and home made soups always hit the spot. Where do you go that makes home made soups. Their skirt steak is juicy and chimichurri is right on the mark. One of my go-to stops for certain. Their take on a key lime pie is life changing as well with that cilantro glaze, wow. Keep it up! Addicted.
2018-12-15,3,Okay at most. We were in the area and saw the good reviews on yelp. I think the reviews sounded better than the food tasted.The entree was salty, Cuban sandwich was dry and lacks flavor. Dont think I will travel here to eat but would recommend to grab a bar seat, get a cup of coffee and sing along with the staffs. The lights are dim and has a cozy vibe.
2018-12-12,5,Nice little place off the path train. The food is really good and tasty especially the beef stew, omg! Some of the best Cuban comfort food I've had for sure. Only down side is that it's small but the food is great so whatever ha! Will definitely come back!
2018-12-04,5,Small Cuban restaurant tucked into side of building on Washington Ave - first time and I'm a believer Fresh ingredients noted in specialty appetizer of day - Empanada spicy shrimp and chorizo sausage - mmm goodHad mixed beet green grilled chicken salad for diner with mango BitadoFor dessert - flan and coffee AmericanoNext time bring wine
2018-11-20,5,I've never been to Cuba but when I'm in la Isla I could swear I was there. Now that you he travel ban is back it's the closest you're gonna get, I guess. Cute old school diner feel. I hope it stays the same for eternity. Food is fantastic and coffee is magnificent
2018-11-20,5,I love Cuban food and it was a delight to dine at la Isla. I has the ropa vieja and croquetas de papa. Delicious !!! I finished my meal with a cortadito. It was definitely the highlight of my visit to Hoboken. This place is a MUST!!!!!!!!!
2018-11-10,2,Hmm.. Not what I expected! I've been to tons of Cuban restaurants and I had high hopes for this one! Limited Saturday menu with only 4 options and a Cubano sandwich. Food was ok, nothing special so so flavor, room temperature. Cups looked dirty and old.  Just felt lack luster for a $14 plate of food.  Prob not coming back to this establishment especially since other Cuban spots throw these guys under the water.
2018-11-10,2,I'd like to start with that I don't usually rate an establishment two stars. However, after the experience I've had here today (my first experience at that) they unfortunately earned this rating. Glows:-My Diet Coke was coldGrows:1. Being Latino and having visited MANY Latin restaurants in throughout NJ the food just didn't match the level that I had expected. Here's why:    -Food was room temperature - except for my maduros        they must have been kept in the fridge or something       Because they were ice cold.     -My order was given on three separate plates - very      strange.      -Ropa Vieja was super tough and chewy - felt like I       Was eating a tough steak - I gave up half way        through 2. Cups were plastic and had scratches on them. I'm not fufu or anything but it looked horrible especially for the area that they are located in. 3. Hair in my food - I didn't say anything because you know what...things happen...gross and the icing on the cake. 4. Also the kitchen isn't opened on a Saturday at 4 pm. If you want a Cuban sandwich or a choice of 4 other items this is the spot for you. All in all, I will never be coming back here. I'm not bashing just stating facts and hoping the establishment can grow from this.
2018-10-29,4,Visited here yesterday and while my heart was set on their legendary French toast I was very happy with what I ordered from the lunch menu . Great food and very friendly, fast, service. Can't wait to go again for the French toast
2018-10-21,1,All the food we ordered had too much of salt. Shredded beef and yellow rice has way too much salt. If you like salty food this is best restaurant for you. Also we ordered bread meat ball which was not served to us but charged in bill. Watch your bills..
2018-10-17,5,The best cuban food. Their takeout dinner specials are amazing and they give you great portions.
2018-10-08,5,This place is great for brunch and lunch. Perfect for small parties. About 1 block from the water and plenty of street parking all around. My family and I ordered the french toast, chicken soup, Cuban sandwich, bacon with avocado sandwich. We loved our meal, but the highlight was definitely a must order. We all found for the crumbs. They use a whole wheat batter and stuff it with creamy Berry yogurt. Delicious and the crunchy thick outside texture made is so memoriable.This place gets packed. Don't expect a long wait. The staff was amazing. We were first seated by the bar and got moved to the tables soon after. If you want authentic Cuban food this is the spot. I'll definitely be back to try their dinner entrees.
2018-10-02,4,My favorite Cuban sandwich spot in Hoboken! Prices are fair and service is nice. Sitting at the bar is the way to go, when dining for two. They have an outdoor seating as well which is better for smaller groups. The empanadas here are delicious and snack size. I've been here 4 times now and get the Cuban sandwich each time, along with a cup of the cubaccino, which is the perfect combo every time.
2018-09-30,2,Not your traditional Cuban food.  No ropa vieja or Piccadillo.   Dirty run down joint.  Tostones loaded with oil and hair found in food.  Wondering if Chef Omar sold or chef quit.  Not the Same.
2018-09-29,5,Best Cuban restaurant I've tried outside of Miami.  I had the papaya milkshake and he had the banana milkshake.  Both were fresh n tasty although mine could've been sweeter.  He had the chicken then meat empanadas which were even better than those made by a real South American mom.  My oxtail stew was very meaty and went well with the rice n beans.  Plaintains were plump and not overfried.  Very authentic lunch with attentive service.  Will be back.
2018-09-17,3,We were a group of 3 vegetarians who came here for brunch, especially the famed guava cream cheese french toast.1. The service was decent. We sat at the bar as there was some wait for the tables. Server was nice, though it was little difficult to communicate with him.2. The french toast is good for one time but never again. It is different but looked like it was deep fried. The order comes with two french toasts but I think at the end of one, you are bored enough to not eat the other one.3. We also ordered omelette which was pretty disappointing. It was supposed to have 3 veggies of my choice, but they were barely seen. Too bland and even the potatoes did not taste good4. Now the drinks - we ordered hot chocolate and that definitely was disappointing. Why do most of these places serve a nestle packet mixed with water?So yeah, if you do not eat meat, go try the famous french toast once, but that's it!
2018-09-01,4,The food is solid .. the Cuban sandwich hits the spot , service can be a bit more friendly . Would still recommend for the food .
2018-08-28,1,I came in to order a BLT for breakfast and the women who took my order was extremely rude. When returned to work I began to eat my sandwich. The food had zero taste, not even a taste a bacon. When I opened my sandwich to add hot sauce I realized that there was a few hairs. I am beyond disgusted. My co workers warned me about this place I should have listened.
2018-08-22,5,One of the best cubanos I've ever had!  They were super quick and even included little packets of Cholula for takeout.
2018-08-18,5,Bae recommended we come here and have the stuffed French toast. Bae knows what he's talking about honey!There's 2 locations in Hoboken...this one is smaller and has a dinner feel. But hold up! We sat down, ordered and had a quick chat with the waiter...immediately felt like I was on vacation in Cuba . We're off to a great start, love it  Food came fast and was eaten faster French toast was AMAZING!!!!! I couldn't eat all of it, I was stuffed...pun totally intended, ha!  Bae raved about the coffee being so damn good, it was definitely all about how it was brewed....2 cups later, he's still closing his eyes in contentment while he sips. It's small and narrow inside, but there's also a small area in the front to dine outside. Real cute...Sunday morning experience...we arrived when the doors opened and it became packed within a few minutes. Be patient, it's worth it!
2018-08-02,5,What would Hoboken be without iconic La Isla? This restaurant is second to none. Amazingly delicious food, friendly and efficient service, and distinctively Cuban music and decor. What's more, ... they truly care whether you loved your meal, and we definitely did. Such pride in their service and their food. Their daily specials are so popular that they may be out of every special for the day if you show up for a late lunch. So show up early if you have your eye on any of the specials!
2018-07-28,5,Absolutely delicious breakfast. Went here with my husband, he got the huevos rancheros and I got an omlette with spinach, plantain and queso blanco. The plantain made the omlette an amazing experience, and the potatoes thst came along with it were perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection.
2018-07-27,4,I haven't had too many Caribbean cuisine dishes so I don't have too many points of reference, but it is a very delicious introduction! This is recommended by a friend who's residing in Hoboken at the moment and also tons of positive yelp reviews. We got the plantains for appetizer and I got the chicken with garlic sauce which came with two sides. The portion is very huge, and I had enough for a second dinner the next day. Even though it was perfectly cooked, I did wish the sauce and chicken had a bit more flavor? I am not sure if the point of the dish is to be relatively mild, but I wish the sauce had more kick and spice to it. The price is also a bit more pricey than I was prepared for, although their specials looked like a really good deal. The service was above and beyond and super lovely. She took note that my friend was late and spent the night having playful banter with us. I would definitely come back again to try some of their other dishes!
2018-07-26,4,Get the coconut babitos drink. Nice quick service. Tostones and cubannsandwhiches great. Tostones w camarones and chorizo excellent but the croquettes were wonderful.  No alcohol booooo. But Mexican coke in a bottle w real sugar is a special treat too. Fran looked great but I was too full. Also had a great spinach salad with beets and Gorgonzola and nuts. Very nice. Cozy. Authentic.
2018-07-22,5,Great landmark for foodies who want something Latin in Hoboken, I love coming here and is one of my favorite spots in town. The uptown location is much more for those that want to bring family and friends in big groups. I highly recommend the pollo asado ($9/$10)chicken rice and beans which is one of their staples but if you're looking for something smaller then go with any of their specialty sandwiches (El Cubano $9 )but if you happen to go on the weekend you must try Omar's stuffed French toast $11 which was on tv against Bobby flay on FOOD TV Throwdown egg filled with strawberry  or guava cream cheese dipped in cinnamon batter with corn flakes and almonds, and I love their morir soñando $4 fresh OJ with evaporated milk and a spoon full of sugar.
2018-07-18,5,Very small place but so worth it. Food is super tasteful, the presentation is amazing and that staff is very sweet. If you want a delicious Cuban Sandwich or some yummy Cuban chicken try this place out!
2018-07-04,5,Visited La Isla based on reviews for lunch and it did not disappoint! The service was fast and friendly. The Cuban sandwich was one of the best I've ever had!
2018-06-03,4,I came here to eat for the first time yesterday for dinner with my husband. When we arrived, there were only 2 other tables occupied. We arrived at the perfect time. As soon as we sat down, one of the waiters  stopped by with a carafe of water and filled our glasses. We were thirsty because the weather was hot/humid. We placed our orders soon afterwards. I ordered 2 items from the appetizers/sides - a papa rellena (mashed potato fried and filled with seasoned ground beef) and a small order of white rice with beans. My husband ordered a Cuban sandwich and a large side of arroz con gandules (rice with pigeon peas). Our food order was ready quickly.  The food was delicious and the service was friendly. I also really enjoyed the old school salsa playing. :) The volume wasn't too loud that I had to yell to speak to my husband across the table. By the time that we were done eating, the restaurant was completely full. Because of this, it took the waiter a long time to give us our check. Not a big deal. I highly recommend La Isla for a reasonably priced restaurant with delicious food. We will be back!
2018-06-03,4,In the span of a couple visits I've tried the ropa vieja, the cubano, and the tres leches. They were all delicious. The only reason why I'm not giving them 5 stars is because on my second visit, I stood near the entrance waiting to be attended and minutes went by without any acknowledgement. I had to stop someone passing by just to get my order. It wasn't nearly as busy as my first time too. But the food is worth it.
2018-06-02,2,I know there is a bunch of positive reviews but personally I didnt really like their churrasco at all. Maybe its because im picky because im used to flavorful churrasco. I just honestly thought the food was very average i personally wouldnt come back. The place is also very small
2018-05-22,5,This is our go to Cuban restaurant, we eat here at least 2-3 times a month. If you love Cuban sandwiches this is your spot! Staff are amazing and always very friendly. This place isn't fancy, very low key, mom and pop feel. This place is not good for large groups max seating is 4 per table. If your want a more fancy place that can accommodate larger groups then check out their uptown location (which has a full bar, downtown is byob).
2018-05-16,5,Awesome food and service. Came out of state just to try this place! Must try if you're in the area!
2018-05-12,5,All I can say is yummy, yummy, yummy. We are out here from California and wanted food that we don't really have there.  Service and food was exceptional.   We did have to wait since there is not a lot of seating but well worth it. Definitely recommend it
2018-05-06,5,Tried the Cubano sandwich today and loved it....the garlic aioli is a great addition.
2018-05-02,4,La Isla is one of the favorite spots for Cuban cuisine in Jersey city, great lunch specials of around 10$ and for the evenings BYOB. We had the grilled chicken special with all Cuban sides (rice, beans, yuca, plaintains) and the mojo sauce with a strong taste of garlic. On warm days they offer some outdoor seating to enjoy the sun and watch people passing by..
2018-04-16,3,Very small hole in the wall feel which I love,  this is a good place if you just want to be low key and grab a quick bite. Maybe it was the day I went but the overall feel in the place was okay; not a friendly or happy vibe you order and you shall be served .Food : $4.50 for an empanada especially when it just made of just chicken or beef , it is not comprehensible to me ; I refused  to even order it. So instead we ordered El Basero which comes with  two poached eggs over ropa vieja with rice and beans. The other dish was the Madurai; spinach & queso omelette that is served with toast and home fries with of course for lunch a cordito .The winning dish ? El basero because the ropa Vieja was delicious , it really made the dish the beans were anything special and there seemed to be no liquor served.
2018-04-12,5,My boyfriend heard great things about La Isla, so we figured we'd try to get some food to go about 30 minutes before they closed. With that said, we assumed the food quality would be so-so since it probably wasn't freshly cooked, but the food actually turned out great.I ordered the pollo asado thigh daily special with yellow rice and maduros and my boyfriend got the cubano sandwich. We were suggested to try the chicken and beef empanadas by the staff, so we decided to add that into our order. The chicken was a little dry, but nothing some hot sauce couldn't fix. The maduros were perfect and the yellow rice even had some vegetables mixed in. Not to mention the portion was very generous for the price point ($9). My boyfriend said he had no complaints with his cubano. The empanadas were PACKED with meat, which was fantastic. I liked the flavor in the beef empanada better; I found the chicken empanada to be a little dry as well.For $28, we got a great take out dinner and speedy service. I can't wait to come back and try out their sit down service.
2018-04-08,3,La Isla is always busy, so my boyfriend and we figured we'd stop in and try the food. We weren't that taken by it, though. This may be because I don't eat meat and there were not many fish or healthy options.
2018-04-07,5,Best food in Hoboken. Simple as that ! Downtown restaurant is better food then uptown too however doesn't serve alcohol. So just bring your own to the downtown.
2018-04-01,5,Super authentic Cuban food with great prices... total hole in the wall so if you're looking for somewhere fancy, this place is not for you. But the ambiance contributes to the authentic overall experience. The Cuban sandwiches are to die for.
2018-03-26,5,Simply put, fantastic! I'm from Tampa Florida and know good Cuban food and this is really good Cuban food! I had the chicken and yellow rice and black beans and Plantains.  All excellent! Great service, made me feel right at home. Just like Tampa. Everyone must try it. Enjoy!
2018-03-20,4,If you're craving Cuban food, definitely check out La Isla. I've been meaning to go for awhile, and finally got the chance to a few weeks ago for lunch. The place is not fancy or anything, but a good lunch spot or quick dinner. My boyfriend and I split the CHURRASCO CON CHIMICHURRI (Marinated grilled skirt steak topped with chopped raw onion, served with an Argentinean style steak sauce) and the EL CUBANO sandwich. The sandwich was pretty small, but put together really well. The steak was so delicious, and the sauce was to die for. I really liked the onions that came with the dish. I usually don't like beans period, but I ate all of the beans that came as a side dish. You get two sides with an entree -- I got the beans and the rice. The rice was also spot-on. Rice + the sauce that came with the steak = magical. They have daily specials which all looks pretty great -- will have to check the place again soon!
2018-03-17,1,Terrible cold food nothing prepared fresh.Went on a Saturday afternoon not so busyWe ordered half roast chicken with sides. Nothing was prepared fresh food came out as if warmed up and made well in advance.Service slow and not consistentTourist trap spend your money else where
2018-03-11,5,As good as it gets! The Tasajo con Boniato was love at first bite for me. I couldn't believe the complexity of flavors. You can taste the time that was put into cooking the cured beef. It's salty and deeply savory but perfect in conjunction with the Cuban sweet potato and rice. It was one of the best meals I've had. This meal was featured when Guy Fieri came to the restaurant too. The restaurant is a BYOB too, which is nice.My sister ordered the pollo al Ajillo con Espinaca. It was a pretty large portion, but the garlic sauce was delicious mixed with the rice and beans. Definitely order the plantains as a side order- they were delicious!Overall, this is a wonderfully authentic Cuban restaurant in the heart of Hoboken. It's not about the size of the place or how upscale it is, when you walk into this little restaurant you know you're about to experience true Cuban gastronomy.
2018-02-26,5,One of my favorite spots I've been. The downtown location is byob and considerably smaller, but it's part of the charm. The food is authentic, affordable priced, and incredible. Any shrimp dish I've had has always exceeded expectations and the yucca is top notch.
2018-02-26,4,Great local Cuban food. Not your fancy place to have a night out, but more like a lunch date. The food is so delicious and true to their cuisine. They have lunch special during the week. Love their potato balls, and ham croquette, and stew beef.
2018-02-17,3,Average at best.  Cuban sandwich, which should be a staple, was very dry.  Empanada was OK, also a bit dry, as it had been sitting under a heat lamp right in front of me.  The above arrived in about 2 minutes but fries arrived as I asked for the check.  Not impressed at all.
2018-02-16,5,My favorite Cuban spot in town. Super low key setting and mouthwatering food. Highly recommend the sandwiches and the plantains are out of this world. If you're looking for an award winning brunch, try the Omar's French toast! It does not disappoint.
2018-01-20,5,El Balsero on Sunday brunch is the best.  I've also had the pancakes, french toast, and yogurt and fruit plate - all good.  Sit at the counter, faster and better service.  This location is much better than uptown.
2018-01-05,3,The food is pretty simple but decent enough. I had chicken soup and black bean hummus w yuca chip. The soup was tasty but the yuca was so deep-fried that i could barely eat that. It was cold there, i didnt know why they didnt turn the heat on. The good thing was the waitress was really nice and friendly.
2018-01-02,5,My fave Cuban place in the NY area. I always make sure to stop by when I'm up here from MIA. Love it!
2017-12-28,4,We decided to try this place since we were going to be traveling through nj and had seen the owner on DDD & recently on a show where he faced off against Bobby Flay and won. We're Puerto Rican and know what flavor is about and we love Cuban food. I decided to order the black bean paste that comes with plantain chips. The bean paste was very flavorful but should have been served warm instead of being served out of the refrigerator. The flavor was there, but the cold paste was not something would prefer. If I could give a suggestion, I would use little biscuits instead of the plantain chips, but overall pretty good. For dinner, I ordered the churrasco. It was Juicy and the chimmy sauce was on point. Steak was lightly charred on the top and cooked to perfection within. My cut of steak was on the thick side, but my husband's was just right. The yuca fries were by far the best I have ever had, here in the U.S. and in PR. Seriously, I would highly recommend it. The black beans were amazing that came with the rice. My husband is allergic to beans, but he said it was well worth the pain he was going to feel later. We didn't try the coffee due to the fact that we were stuffed, but about 20 people came in just for their coffee before they headed home from work. The only sort of negative thing was this one woman behind the counter. She was rude to other workers and some people that came in. She said some snippy things in Spanish and another female behind the counter made sure she took all the customers to keep her away. She even convinced a new local person to become a regular to drink their coffee. They need to get rid of that cancer in he restaurant before it does damage.The great:  Black beans, yuca fries, black bean paste (if it was warm).The good: churrasco The not so great: priceThe bad: the slightly large rude lady behind the counter
2017-12-23,5,Yummy Cuban food. Breakfast, lunch and dinner.The best empanadas.  Ropa vieja is delicious! Cuban lattes are really good, too. I prefer the downtown location because it's byob and we like to sit at the counter. But uptown is good if you have more than 4 people.
2017-12-17,3,The food is great ! But the waitress with glasses behind the bar is a horrible human being !!!! She is nasty, rude, condescending and unprofessional.  She would ignore you as much as posible  and then talk bad about ppl shes serving  in Spanish to co-workers as she also mean to them... What a Bully!!! Then she would forget your order and blame you !!
2017-12-09,1,place is garbage. put in an order togo and when my friend got there, they said the order wasnt made and they never got it. thats a lie because we called and specifically ordered 20 mins ago. 30 mins later we get the food. unacceptable. i even called to speak to a manager and all he kept saying was ok? ok? ok? i tried giving this spot numerous chances and this is the last straw. i actually have to make a yelp review? get a better staff
2017-12-06,4,Great place for breakfast and lunch! This seemed like the place to be on an early Saturday morning. We were lucky to grab a table as the others who came in after us had to sit at the bar or wait. For our entrees, we got the free style omelette and the eggs rancheros with chorizo on the side. The food was very delicious, especially the eggs rancheros. The prices were ok, neither high or low. This is definitely a neighborhood gem!
2017-12-02,5,The best! My go to breakfast spot. Always delicious and the staff is warm, welcoming and friendly! Get there early on weekends because it's impossible to get through the door for brunch.
2017-11-17,5,It's a hole in the wall.   Food is awesome.  It's always crowded. Bathroom is super small
2017-11-12,2,Food is decent but waaaaaay overpriced. You don't even get complimentary Cuban bread with meals. So many better/ affordable options 5-10 min away in North Hudson area.
2017-11-05,2,Okay Cuban food for the area.We stopped by for dinner in the area and split a beef empanada to start, the middle of which was a little cold in the middle unfortunately. My shredded beef dish was alright, the meat decent but the rice very dry. My friend's marinated strip steak was also fine, but it was certainly not medium rare as requested. It's not particularly cheap and the quality left something to be desired; I'd rather go to The Cuban up the street for a meal of this ilk in the area.
2017-11-04,5,The food was completely amazing and Sandra was the best guide for the restaurant that anyone could have.  I had El Cubano, as I love a true Cuban Sandwich, and it was the best.  My friends had Arroz con Pollo and and the Churrasco and they were awesome as well.  And, the chicken empanada was one of the best things I have had recently.  I highly recommend this place and hope to be back again soon!
2017-10-09,1,Sunday night:  empty tables but they squeezed 5 people onto a tiny table for 4.  We had to ask them for another table and it took them 10 minutes to figure out where we could sit!! Waited too long for entrees...20 minutes.  Two chicken dishes were very dry and had no taste! Thats our last meal at la isla.
2017-09-30,4,Small place but great food. I heard about the place having bad customer service but I didn't seem to get that impression, although I wouldn't say the service is exceptionally amazing. I ordered the Saturday special (Ropa Vieja) and the papa rellena for appetizer, which were served very quickly - I highly recommend the papa rellena. The portions were big and I walked away very satisfied with my meal.
2017-09-30,4,Everything was so perfect. Delicious flavor and great service. My only complaint is that the eggs were cold. But everything is amazing.
2017-09-04,4,Had dinner here last night. The dinner menu is fairly extensive and has a lot of steak, chicken and fish options. I ordered this shrimp dish with garlic sauce with rice and fried yucca. I enjoyed the meal but there could have been a few more shrimp in my opinion. Service was good and served at a perfect pace. Prices are moderate. Id visit again.
2017-09-01,1,I stopped in tonight and placed an order for two chicken meals to go. The waitress took my order then went away, got something to drink, played with her phone and came back twenty minutes later and told me they were out of chicken. I asked her why it took her twenty minutes to tell me she was out of chicken and she told me she was waiting for the rice. The whole time she was standing in front of the food! I used to like this place, the food was reasonable and the staff generous, now it's a waste.
2017-08-26,2,The service and the food were awful.  We had to ask for water 4 times.  Our waiter kept running away from our table before we could even get our requests out.  No one asked us how our food was.  As far as the food, the ceviche should not even be allowed to be called ceviche.  There were literally 2 shrimp in the entire order and it was so extremely watery that it was impossible to eat with a fork or on chips.  The chorizo had the funkiest taste that none of us could eat, but the waiters wouldn't know because they never checked to see how we liked our food.  The steak was decent, but the prices we paid for the food, portion and service, was not even close to worth the cost.With such poor service, bad food, and high prices, I really do not understand why this restaurant is so highly rated / so popular in Hoboken.  I will NOT be going back.
2017-08-23,5,Olah Cuba!On may night out in hoboken I was recommended this spot and it did impress! This is a short walk from the path / ferry and can easily be missed on washington street with all the other restaurants but this is the one you want to go to and there is some out door seating.When you walk in here it gives off that old school dinner vibe with a long bar almost the entire length of the restaurant and a few four person tables. We sat at the bar and when going over the menu everything looked amazing. The waitress was really friendly and helped us figure out what we would like best. With this being a Cuban restaurant I obviously had to go with the Cubano sandwhich which is Pulled pork, ham, swiss cheese, pickle with garlic mojo and every bite was more delicious than the next. The pulled pork and ham was juicy and full of flavor and that sanwhich was pressed to perfection. We also got the Pollo al Ajillo con Espinaca - Boneless chicken breast in garlic sauce served with sautéed spinach this was a ton of food and the that garlic sauce on the chicken gave it such a delicious flavor. To finish the meal we got coffee and it was strong and kept me going for the night!In short:- Delicious Cuban food- Fast Friendly service- I'll be back
2017-08-14,5,I've never had Cuban food before and this was AMAZING. I ordered one of the specials and my boyfriend got a sandwich. I had plenty of food but I don't think the sandwich alone was enough for him - it didn't come with any sides so we probably should have gotten some. Small space but nice staff and delicious food.
2017-07-30,3,We have been coming to the Isla for over twenty five or more years. We notice  the food taste has change a lot. It was okay but not as when Omar and his family bought over twenty one years ago. We want to pray that they return to the original food preparation. The staff is polite and considerate toward our food concerns.  If you are in Hoboken it's still a nice place to eat at good price.
2017-07-24,4,La Isla is extremely small, but the food is delicious and worth the cramped dining space. My lechon asado was so moist, perfect for anyone that loves pork. My sister ordered the garlic shrimp which was also a solid choice. I would recommend coming here on the earlier side to ensure a table. There were tables outside to for the summer. BYOB keeps the bill down!
2017-07-17,4,I've been coming to the downtown La Isla location for the past two years. As an individual who recently turned pescetarian, I have to admit that the one thing beckoning me back to life of a carnivore (aside from lamb, c'mon, I'm half Greek) is the thought of an El Cubano at La Isla. The warm layers of pork, ham, and melted swiss cheese with pickles and garlic mojo on crispy, pressed bread is the kind of stuff that haunts your dreams. As my fellow yelpers have mentioned, the serving size is generous, and half a slice with a side of yuca frita or tostones/platanos maduros is enough to leave you satisfied. One of the reasons I love the downtown location as opposed to uptown is the ambiance. The borderline cramped, yet intimate quarters, bar seating throughout, low lighting, and demeanor of the waitstaff really brings me back to all of the summers I spent in Costa Rica with my relatives for months on end. It feels like home. And yes, home was loud. While dining at La Isla, you'll find loud music, waiters and waitresses yelling orders across the restaurant in their characteristic "¡No!" shirts, and strong Cuban coffee that will have you yelling in joy too. La Isla really is a gem; you'll find authentic Cuban cuisine reminiscent of home cooked meals, as well as interesting, creative dishes. Breakfast is served Monday 7am-11am, and Saturday 7am-12pm. Sunday Brunch is from 10am to 3:45pm. One of my favorites is La Isla Huevos Rancheros: the spicy tomato sauce packs a punch and the fried tortilla shell is always crispy. With a side of black beans and rice, this meal will leave you stuffed. Both the white rice and arroz con gandules (yellow rice with pigeon peas) are delicious and I recommend that you sample both. And of course, you have to try Omar's Stuffed French Toast. Don't know what it is? The menu describes it as "egg bread filled with strawberry/guava cream cheese, dipped in cinnamon batter and coated with corn flakes and almonds". It's not too sweet, is pleasantly crispy, and is definitely satisfying. They also have daily specials throughout the week served with a choice of two sides (rice, beans, yuca, maduro). I recommend the lechon asado, aka roasted pork. It's served on monday, wednesday, saturday and sunday (5pm-9pm). While this dish is sometimes hit or miss, when it's drenched in sauce, you know you're in for a treat. Once or twice I've come and it was a little too dry for my liking, but that was because I came close to closing. Just be careful because they sometimes run out of their specials around half way through dinner time. I also recommend the camarones enchilado, cazuelita de camarones y chorizo al ajillo, churrasco con chimichurri, and seared salmon. When ordering delivery, don't get bistek de palomilla or bistek empanizado because the meat is very tough and dry, though I've yet to try either of these dishes at their restaurant. As for shakes, the batidos and morir sonando don't live up to my expectations. In Costa Rica, my abuela makes batidos with lots of fresh fruit, milk, ice, and condensed milk, lending itself to a much more natural, smooth, creamy, and refreshing drink. My favorite is a papaya batido. However, at la isla, you'll find the fruit is frozen in the frige behind the counter, and you're drink is predominantly granulated sugar; as such, you lose the natural flavor of the fruit and are overwhelmed with pure sugar. All in all, definitely give the downtown La Isla location a try. Rather than risking it with a batido, remember it BYO and that they have AMAZING coffee.
2017-07-16,5,This gem is precious! It's a little hole in the wall with delicious Cuban food. It reminds me of the authentic Spanish restaurant that cater to fast lunches. It is less food than expected but it was certainly delicious
2017-07-09,1,The food was amazing, but the female waitress ignored us at the entrance for over 10 minutes. We tried to wave, but she totally ignored us. The guys at the bar also ignored us. Really dissatisfied with the service. This happened on a Sunday evening. There were plenty of tables to sit so we decided to go up and sit in one, but the female waitress immediately came up to us and said "not here sweety" in a REALLY condescending tone. Dislike. Please work to fix this. Very dissatisfied. The short female with black hair is the absolute worst. My husband is Colombian and we heard them bad mouthing us. Extremely rude I hope the owner reads this.
2017-06-27,5,This location is great for a no frills, GOOD breakfast. I love the La Isla Breakfast sandwich and my boyfriend always gets some dish that's basically Ropa Veja with a pouched egg on top. The coffee is nice and strong and will definitely wake you up! If you're looking for a quick, good breakfast-- this is your spot.
2017-06-25,1,I've never been in a restaurant where there are empty tables, and I still had to wait 20 minutes to be seated and 15 minutes to order.  Please hire more wait staff - the one who was there was clearly over stretched, over worked, and as a result rude to customers. The food was good though - just make sure to bring some entertainment.
2017-06-22,4,Have been going to this place for Cuban food for several years now. Had a almost everything on the menu. My recent trip for brunch could have been better if the staff were much faster and more accommodating. It took us almost 40 minutes to get our food and for the waiter to bring us a wine cork opener. They were not that busy so I am not sure why such long delays.The food made up for it. Excellent spot for Cuban and brunch especially there eggs dishes. The owner needs to get some better waiters.
2017-06-20,3,The club sandwich was a disappointment. The empanada was enjoyable. The plantain appetizer was nothing i would order again. disappointed.
2017-06-18,1,Excellent food. Horrible service.I just ordered to go and overheard someone bad mouthing/cursing people out in Spanish right in front of them.If you understand Spanish, keep an ear out. If you don't, be ready to get cursed out.
2017-06-01,5,My favorite cuban spot. The food is great and the cafe con leche is awesome.
2017-05-31,5,Tiny place with the BEST Cuban food EVER! I always get the shrimp and garlic sauce or the churassco (spelling?) steak...jeez, my mouth waters just thinking about it.
2017-05-29,5,Amazing little concept food is plated very well. Its my favorite Brunch spot
2017-05-26,4,Big tastey dishes at an unexpected  side restaurant. Had a salad with oranges mango avocado and spinach. Yuca side dish was large enough to take home. Black beans and rice had mixed in pork for amazing flavor. Hole in the wall but it makes you feel like you're dining in Miami
2017-05-26,4,Whenever I wan't to feel like I'm at home and my mom is cooking for me, this is where I go. In jersey city this is the place for a great and quite true to taste Cuban food. We prefer the Downtown location to the uptown one because somehow the food is better, even though the ambiance at the uptown location is much nicer. The downtown location is fashioned after an old dinner and can be a little cramped at times. We personally like it as it gives out a homier feel. We usually order the Ropa Vieja with rice, beans and plantains, or the bistec de palomilla over onions. The tostones are incredible but be sure to ask them with garlic and butter on the side as it can be a little greasy if you don't. A cortado to close the meal is prepared expertly and tastes as it should. Service is usually quite nice as quick. Staff is friendly and know their menu. Highly recommended. We come here all the time!
2017-05-25,2,I'm a little confused by the tremendous amount of good reviews for la isla. I have been here three times and every single time I had such bad customer service experiences. Whenever I walk in, I'm ignored for at least a few minutes. It's the most awkward thing, since they have so many employees out on the floor. I even had to yell (because my normal volume wasn't enough apparently) across the bar to grab someone's attention one time I was there after waiting for five minutes at the front. I'm honestly not even sure if they have a separate host/hostess position.When dining in, it was difficult to grab the attention of our waiter and we were knocked into a few times.The two stars are for the pollo asado. I love it here with the chicken thigh and pickled onions but I think I'll stick to takeout from now on.
2017-05-14,5,It's byob. Store next block to get your brunch started the right way! Best stuffed French toast!
2017-05-14,3,Been here for lunch a few times. It's ok Cuban food. A step above Tina's in the city but not what you expect from a proper Cuban place. Lechon asado was lacking really mojo flavor. Pollo asado more flavorful mainly because of onions. Empanadas are standard. Cuban sando was nothing special.
2017-05-06,3,I'm not too sure about this place. Service is good and food is decent.  The chicken soup was my favorite.  I am cuban so maybe that's why I'm not convinced on the taste of food.  I have to say there is only one cuban in the whole eatblishment.
2017-04-24,5,Food was delicious, Miguel was our server - He was extremely professional and attentive.  Very sweet and took our order straight away.  Our food was divine, ordered a pressed chicken sandwich and the infamously addictive cuban coffee which did not disappoint.  Will be coming back indefinitely.
2017-04-22,5,This is fantastic Cuban food - the roasted chicken is super tender and seasoned nicely.  The sides of black beans and rice are huge and delicious!  Gotta get back here soon!
2017-04-17,5,La Isla is a timeless and consistent restaurant. I've been going ever since I was a little kid with my parents. My classic order has always been a beef empanada, pan con lechon (sometimes with a side of their crispy hot delicious French fries), and for dessert, their key-lime pie. Every single thing they make, including their meals like Ropa Vieja or their soups, is so tasty. Their entire staff is so nice. Definitely somewhere to visit and grab a bite to eat if you're in Hoboken, or even from New York City!!!
2017-04-12,5,Super good. Just go there.the staff was nice the food is awesome. I'm waiting till the day I get to be there again!
2017-04-11,4,Went here for the first time last night with friends. Sat outside and didn't have to wait long for a table for 3. The staff was friendly and attentive, and the food was delicious! We split the ceviche, and I had the roast chicken thigh special with rice and beans and maduras. It's also BYO, so the price was very affordable. I hope to be back to try their brunch food!
2017-04-10,4,Even though it's a bit expensive...Even for Hoboken..The food is great!!!  Must try La Croqetta preparada!!!! It's to die for... Perfect for a cheat meal..
2017-04-09,4,We had to wait for a little bit. This place was cozy and small. However, there's tons of people waiting to eat their food. I have to say the food is like homemade. The appetiser papa rellena was fantastic. We ordered withe salsa. It's full of potatoes, crunchy and crispy on the outside. The salsa was spicy but delicious. It is not our regular salsa with tomatoes. They have a daily special menu which is great. The price is a little cheaper but taste great. I ordered the shredded beef which was recommended by food network; however, it tasted too salty. The daily special, we ordered the roast pork, that taste better than special for some reason. For me, this place is authentic and home style. I recommend it and I will go back.
2017-04-09,5,The aged beef dish featured on DD&D is stellar! I'd also recommend the ceviche. Ambiance is extremely casual but the food is top notch! It's also BYOB!
2017-04-02,5,I love this place! Try the Huevos Rancheros and their cafe con leche. The eggs and beans are served in a "tortilla" bowl and is the best in town! There's not a lot of seating - it's a smaller diner style setting - so come early or be prepared for a minor wait. The food is great and the price is even better!
2017-03-25,5,Jerry makes brunch at the bar absolutely fabulous!  He is as warm and inviting as the menu options at La Isla.. by far the best dining experience in uptown Hoboken!!
2017-03-03,4,Nice place ....comfy atmosphere good food. Enjoyed the cuban sandwich last time we were there. Coffee is Outstanding!!! Only downside...Parking. Not their fault parking sucks in all of Hoboken unless you pay for a garage.  All in all a nice place will definatly be back.
2017-02-08,3,Considering I am of Cuban descent and from Miami, I have quite high expectations for my Cuban food. However, the Isla is an ok spot to fix your Cuban food cravings. My friend and I had pan con lechón, a media noche, a side of maduros and yuca fries. We didn't feel too well after eating our sandwiches, which is why I'm giving a 3 rating. We came to eat on a Sunday expecting to be able to a full plate of food (like rice and beans with eithe ropa vieja or vaca frita), but unfortunately there was only a brunch option with sandwiches and American style breakfast items. At the end of our meal we ordered cafecito, and it was so bitter! Cafecito is known to be very dulce (sweet)! It was quite disappointing. Although I wasn't a fan of the brunch options, I am interested in returning for dinner.
2017-02-04,5,Absolutely delicious flavorful Cuban food.  Highly recommended.  The yuca fries are perfection.
2017-01-28,5,Small place that has been there for many years. I have been the a hand full of times and they never disappoints. Today I had the arroz con Pollo because it's not a dish readily available where i live and I have been craving it for quite some time. Sandwiches are great here and the espresso is on point!
2017-01-26,4,Breakfast never disappoints, love the tilapia in garlic sauce on Fridays. Steak sandwich kind of boring, won't order again.
2017-01-23,4,I'm all about the island food and this place is sooooo good I'm always getting a potato ball, rice n beans with chicken or the shredded beef or pork whatever it is  (sorry I can't remember what it's called) and the Cuban sandwich. What made me want to try it out in the first place was I thought they had the fried chicken pieces but apparently it's I believe on certain days or times. It's a small place so pick and choose wisely on what day and time you go because it will be packed. I've only had one rude experience there but my friends and I ignored it because we were so starving and didn't want to leave just to find another place AND that was the first time I ever encountered rudeness there with someone I've never seen worked there before but then again I've only been there at left 4 times.
2017-01-23,5,One of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken! (Along with La Isla Uptown) The food is incredible and the waiters/waitresses are all so nice! We started off with a beef empanada and a shrimp/sausage appetizer. I respect the fact that they're able to time the food correctly because it's slightly irritating when we are still working on apps and the entrees come out. We got the boneless chicken breast in garlic sauce served with sautéed spinach which was phenomenal with a side of rice & beans. I'm craving it right now...
2017-01-20,3,Food is very good real Cuban food a bit pricey service is a little slow. They do have delivery so I suggest you order from home. Very small place Rather go to that restaurant on 11th St. it's a lot better.
2017-01-19,5,Small place but they have the BEST French toast probably in NJ.  also the papaya shake is done right here!  Gotta go here if you're in the area!
2017-01-15,5,Best food in town ., when your looking for Cuban food there is no other destination.. Recently I went to Miami and the food wasn't even close to the quality of LA ISLA .
2017-01-07,3,This is the other location on the north side of Hoboken.  Met up with a girlfriend for lunch here.  Food:  I had the media noche sandwich.  It was okay, nothing to shout about. The price was very reasonable. Service: they let us sit there for a couple hours to chat and checked up on us often enough.  There was nothing disappointing about this place but also nothing exciting.  Maybe the dinner menu is better?
2016-12-29,4,Wife and I went last night because she saw it on Dinners and Dives.  Good authentic food.  It is a really small place / dive but the food presentation is what you expect from a formal restaurant.
2016-12-29,5,A very Cuban place. The food is delicious and very homemade. The atmosphere makes you feel like you are in cuba in the middle of Hoboken . At weekends you have to make a long line to enter. You can bring your own liquor. I recommend the croquette sandwich it is delicious. The cafe is spectacular but does not offer refill. Enjoy your time.
2016-12-28,3,I was not really impressed the calamari was bland, yes I know calamari at a Cuban place but I let the wifey pick the app.  The special was a steak with truffle fries.  The truffle fries were great, but the steak was smothered with some sauce which took away from the flavor of the bone in ribeye. My wife had a fish fish which I though was a bit overcooked. I think the highlight of the dinner were the mojito s.  We had a few of those at $10 a pop. Expensive dinner for the food you get.
2016-12-27,5,Don't miss trying the papa rellena--amazingly delicious! The pollo asado dish with sweet plantains and yellow rice is delicious--not dry but recommend asking for a side of ranchera sauce for dipping or to pour over as an extra boost of flavor. A Cubaccino was a delicious cap to the meal.
2016-12-07,5,Hands down the best Cuban place in town. Love the unpretentious air around this tiny establishment. Love the Cuban sandwich (pork)!
2016-11-25,5,Stopped by for a quick late lunch and decided to sit at the bar. Ordered the papa rellena to share, an el cubano sandwich, Friday's special (beef stew) and an iced cuban latte. Wow!! I'm coming by for my daily coffee now!!! Great coffee for $3!! We really enjoyed the food here and thought they were priced reasonably. Portion is a little huge. Service is quick, no nonsense (which I love) and straight to the point! Food was quick and fresh!! Super psyched to be coming back and glad we stopped by. Told my husband I'd like to try their dinner menu soon. Come on by and enjoy some good ole Cuban food!!
2016-11-25,5,Came to Hoboken to visit Carlos bakery and yelped this little Cuban restaurant. The food was delicious!
2016-11-17,4,I am of Cuban heritage and can say this place is authentic, the flavors are on point and the food presentation is spot on! We had the papa rellena (stuffed potato) as an app and it was absolutely delicious and freshly made! Entrees we ordered ox tail and ropa vieja, black beans and sweet plantains.  The food was undoubtedly delicious!It is Hoboken though, the city where the working class were burned out of their apartments and the yuppies and suits moved in.  Having said that, expect to pay jacked up prices for standard yet good Cuban food! The place is very small which is slightly uncomfortable but since real estate is at all time premium in Hoboken, it is what it is!  The wait staff could afford to smile a bit more and because we were seated right next to the kitchen, I wasn't thrilled leaving the place smelling like food.
2016-11-17,1,Not happy with the prices. Who the heck pays 3 dollars for a croqueta. Way too expensive for the food & the place is too small & top of of the food being expensive, my croqueta had a piece of paper inside.
2016-11-11,5,Excellent Cuban food for a really great price.  I love this hidden gem.  I have brought many friends and even business clients to this place for a truly "authentic" Cuban cuisine.  It's not high end, but it's high quality.
2016-10-19,3,Good food but expensive for the daily menu, taste was alright, I would suggest to them cook less salty
2016-10-15,5,Great authentic Cuban food. Service excellent, atmosphere cosy, great music y la comida era muy delisiosa.
2016-10-13,2,Ehhhhhhhh, so I came here many years ago and remember it being really really good! Convinced my boyfriend to come have a nice "hole in the wall" dinner. Ummmm I was disappointed to say the least , our waiter didn't feel like he wanted to be there, and when we asked for recommendation he just read us the menu. I ordered the grilled chicken with spinach and cream sauce, my honey ordered vaca frita. We ordered and it was out in no more than 5 min. My chicken tasted burnt! Not grilled I couldn't taste the sauce or anything because of burnt flavor was overpowering. The vaca frita is very thin, so if it's not made fresh you can see and taste it. It was hard and dry! When the waiter asked about our food i was very honest, his response was you should of told me right away so I could have said something. I wanted to say " welllllllllll if you ever came to check on us, I would have told your miserable ass!" They took the chicken off our bill, so I threw them a bone and gave them one star. The price did not match the portions, and I didn't get the real Cuban feel I got years ago. If you want real good cheap Cuban food go to Rumba Cubana or Gran Via in Union City. At some point this place lost what made them so special, what a shame.
2016-10-04,5,I was here for lunch yesterday and OMG the salmon was orgasmic! It's the best cuban food I have ever had! I recommend you go eat there!
2016-10-02,5,Great food. Super fast service. Real authentic Cuban food. They serve one hard to find item around here: pan con mantequilla tostado (toasted Cuban bread with butter) - delicious.
2016-10-02,4,Always loved this place in when its only location was the little hole in the wall downtown. Now I prefer the uptown location where its more roomy and spacious. Food here never disappoints. Garlic chicken is amazing as are the yucca fries and the Tres Leches cake for dessert. Service can be hit or miss.
2016-09-25,5,You must sit at the bar!   The atmosphere is fantastic!  Order the Baja Vieja!  It's shredded beef flank with peppers and onion.  The black beans are very very good. The plantain chips taste homemade and go good with everything!! This place has authentic Cuban food. Enjoy!!!Came for brunch today.  This place did not disappoint!   The beef skirt steak, eggs and black beans were outstanding!Can't wait to come back again!!!!
2016-09-22,5,After having Sophie's in the city, I was craving Cuban again so I came here.Cubaccino, their Saturday chicken and rice entree special, a beef empanada, and a grilled chicken sandwich = brunch for two!The grilled chicken sandwich was so good.  They put potato sticks (bringing me back to the 90s...google it if you have to!) in the sandwich.  Top it off with some of their green hot sauce and you've got so much goodness mmmmm.Everything I had for lunch was on point.  I got to try the chicken and rice (arroz con pollo?) too.  When it first came out we wondered - where's the chicken?  They cook the chicken and then embed it inside the rice.  It's like opening a present on Christmas... SURPRISE CHICKEN!Everything is just so deliciously seasoned (salty just the way I like it) and so tender and soft.Highly recommend.  I know they have two locations, but from what I gauged the uptown location is more up-scale-y and has more of that nice table setting and tiled floor look whereas the downtown location is more of a smaller location that's more your local corner restaurant.Just a tip, if you're going during a high traffic time, make sure you write your name and party size down.  Right when you walk in there's a clipboard to your left.  There's no hostess and when it gets packed and busy, the staff is all over the place.  To be honest, you're not going here for their service and to be treated like a princess.  You're coming here for some good authentic Cuban food.  If you want service and more classy decor, try the uptown location.
2016-09-20,4,Located in a hip part of Hoboken across the river from Manhattan, La Isla is a ground floor kitchen/dining room combination that looks like a miniature truck stop diner. But despite its atmosphere, this cafe serves up quality dishes with fantastic in wonderful presentation. We started with three appetizers: Empanada de Pollo (a crescent pastry filled with a lot of chicken), Papa Rellena (Fried potato stuffed with ground beef), and Croqueta de Jamon (Croquet filled with a homemade ham filling). I was most impressed with the Papa Rellena. My entrée was Salmon Negro (Charred Salmon served on a bed of watercress with fried plantains topped with avocado purée). The avocado purée was one of the best guacamole that I've tried and the fish was cooked to perfection. I really liked how there was very little seasoning to the fish itself. The smooth texture and tarty taste of the avocado complemented the crispiness and meatiness of the salmon.If you want a quality Cuban meal, I would highly recommend La Isla Restaurant!
2016-09-19,3,Felt like the jamon croquettas could have had better ratio of meat. Especially for the price.
2016-09-15,5,THE BEST. I never had cuban food until I tried this place and I will never go back. Their papa rellena, empinadas, black bean hummus with plantain chips, steak, stuffed french toast and sweet plantains are incredible. The downtown location is BYOB and the uptown location has a bar. LOVE!
2016-09-14,4,Love La Isla downtown great food & staff ( ridiculous they no longer deliver,)Uptown same great food only they do not cook the food the same way...if you're going for brunch they do not put fruit inside pancakes as they do downtown ( lazy)They now only deliver from uptown location  $20.00 minimum delivery ---downtown never a minimum so high...  :-(
2016-09-10,4,Love this place! Their chicken soup is sensational and so addicting! They have a great selection of goodies, as well as daily specials for the week. The only reason it's not 5 stars is that sometimes the staff tends to get a little overwhelmed since it''s a tight location, but always friendly and cheerful. Overall great experience
2016-09-05,3,La Isla isn't a bad place on its own, but considering the other way better Cuban spots in Hoboken like Zafra, Cucharamama and The Cuban, I frankly have no idea why you'd eat here.I've tried the stuffed French toast and it's not bad, but you can only have a few bites before being overcome by the insane sweetness - it's almost impossible to finish because of that alone. Not sure why this dish is so 'famous' here.The other Cuban basics are... fine. Decent ropa vieja, good tostones, perfectly acceptable yuca. Don't order their churrasco though - it's dry and extremely fatty - a 4/10 at best when you can get a 9/10 version of it at any of the other Cuban places I mentioned above.Staff is usually nice, but the wait is long sometimes since the place is small. It's hard to give it less than three stars because it's decent enough, but seriously, go to one of the other Cuban places. They might be a tad pricier but the quality is leagues higher.
2016-08-28,5,5 stars for the food but 3.5 stars if I was rating the atmosphere because it's very small and tight in there ...However I am rating the food because this is authentic Cuban food and I rather have good food then eat crappy food with fancy decor everywhere lol... If you don't mind eating in a small space and want to just enjoy quality food then this is a great spot to go ... It can get very crowded because the food is so good so a few times I had to get it to go or even eat at the stools instead of a table ...But it's worth it once you get a taste of that genuine Cuban cuisine
2016-08-27,4,Deciding where to grab a quick dinner in Hoboken, finding a Cuban restaurant featured on DDD made it an easy choice. And they don't hide that fact at all. Exploring the menu, you'll quickly spot in one of the corners, a one-item section labeled, Featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. The one dish, tasajo con boniato, is a bit pricey but it lives up to the hype. It wasn't entirely filling, partly because there were no chips or snack to start the meal, but it was nonetheless an awesome choice. They didn't have sweet potato so they offered plantains instead and still, the dish didn't miss a beat. The beef was so crisp and tender, like a soft and rich beef jerky. The crispy potato straws added some textural balance, the rice provided a simple base for the beef, and the plantains infused some mushy sweetness into each bite. A really lovely and unique dish I'd highly recommend.
2016-08-26,5,Great price. Great food. My boyfriend and I decided to go here for our anniversary since he's new to the area. He loved it and is totally on the fan club now! It was also his first time trying mamey and I'm certain he's going to stop by once a week for a beverage!
2016-08-20,5,Cute little Cuban restaurant! I went on a double date there for my first time. My boyfriend and I loved it! Great portions and pretty good options. I had the chicken with spinach and a side of rice & beans. Really filling and flavorful. This spot is perfect for date night!
2016-08-20,5,Cuban food at such a reasonable price!  I love this little place in Hoboken, and its a good go to for either lunch or dinner.  The papa rellena and the Cuban sandwiches are two things you must try here.  Service is fast and friendly here as well!
2016-08-20,4,Very good, especially for brunch, but you should have a backup plan if you're coming on the weekend as it is always very busy.
2016-08-18,3,Very cozy atmosphere which I liked. Sat at the bar and brought a 6 pack of beer since its BYOB. The lady behind the counter was very sweet and offered to buy the other 4 beers in the fridge to keep cold til we were ready for them. I got the shrimp ceviche with a side of rice and beans and tres leches to-go. My ceviche was not very flavorful, I'm used to it being spicy? No? Rice and beans are hard to mess up. The tres leches has a very strong alcohol taste to it and was not that great. All in all this place is okay if you're looking for a cheap Cuban fix.
2016-08-15,5,I came here upon my travels from NYC down to PA. I walked into a bar next to where my car was parked, but only to find that the bar doesn't serve food. So the bar tender actually recommended me this place plus it was literally around the corner. So I ordered a Cuban sandwich and a fried ball filled with mashed potatoes and beef. It was all very delicious. I'd highly recommend trying this place out. It has a mom and pop feel to it and seems authentic.
2016-08-08,5,This restaurant was unreal. The decor and staff upon arrival were amazing. Straight up we got the El Cubano with extra pickles. We had a couple of appetizers to accompany our meal. The El Cubano was one of the most delcious sandwiches I have come across throughout all my travels. A highly recommended restaurant.
2016-07-29,5,La isla is literally my go to brunch spot in Hoboken. The stuffed French toast maybe the best thing I have ever ate! My husband loves the huevo rancheros! Such a cute little spot and the perfect brunch! Highly recommend!
2016-07-28,4,La Isla is a good place. The stuffed french toast is legitimate. I have always enjoyed it. Their specials are good, too. I also enjoy their cafe con leche.
2016-07-20,2,The stuffed french toast is alright. I had very high expectations when I came, but the french toast did not live up to them. It was a little dry, and I wouldn't go out of my way to have the french toast. The restaurant is also very small; I wouldn't suggest going with more than four people.
2016-07-18,4,Food is great! I had the grilled pork chops which were so tender, so good, soooo good.It's small inside and there will be a wait, especially on the weekends but worth it!
2016-07-12,5,Can't say enough about this place, the food is great! With the group I was with we shared their famous papa rellena, which is mashed potato stuffed with ground beef and fried. It was delicious, and was once showed on Food Networks drive in diners and dives. We also shared the beef and chicken empinadas that were so flavorful. For my entree I ordered the el Cubano sandwich with a side of platanos maduros, which are fried sweet plantains... Delicious! I've never had a Cubano sandwich before and I'm thrilled that I tried it. The sandwich was crispy and flavorful, and lived up to the expectation of a great Cubano sandwich! This location is their original and smaller location. There's only about 20 tables and bar seating so it is a bit tight and hard to get a table, but it has a great family vibe. I have also been to the larger location In up town Hoboken, which I suggest if your going with a large group. I would definitely recommend eating here!!
2016-07-12,4,I recently visited a friend in NJ and we went to La Isla in Hoboken. The food was pretty solid.I ordered the Boliche con Chorizo, stuffed pot roast with chorizo and red sauce, it was rich and hearty paired great with the yellow rice and black beans. Also tried the coconut shake which was sweet and cold perfect for a hot day. Finally I finished with a desert I should've not had but enjoyed every last bit of- the Coconut Mango Cheesecake very delicious, rich, and guilty. They mainly received the four star rating for the delicious cheesecake and the price-food ratio. Great portions.
2016-07-12,3,The food is great,the place is very clean and is BYOB, my only issue with this place is that the 3 times I been there the server is always rushing us, the first time he told me u had to order fast 9:15pm,the second time if I waned everything wrapped around 9:40pm and the last time 8:45pm same server told me I had to order fast because they were closing. I will be back. And yes I recommend this place. Papas rellenas,Salmón,pan con bistec are my fav.
2016-07-09,2,Mediocre food although the papa rellena was light and flakie my masitas de puerco were dry and flavorless. Attitude from the staff added to my woes. Very disappointed.
2016-07-08,5,Visiting my best friend who lives in Hoboken she suggested this place for lunch knowing how much I love Spanish cuisine. My toddlers loves the empanadas and shrimp in garlic cream sauce. I enjoyed the ropa vieja, so flavorful! This place has superb service, clean, pretty and delicious food. The music added to the ambience. Must try!
2016-07-02,3,I have to say that I expected more.  The food was good, the service weak, the atmosphere benefits from outdoor dining in good weather (otherwise not too impressive).  Also note that wine or beer are not sold by the restaurant - it is BYOB.  Fortunately, there is an excellent wine shop a few hundred feet away.I had written a much better summary of our meal but I accidently posted it to the wrong restaurant and was (properly) asked to remove it.
2016-06-21,2,I've had the cuban sandwich here a few times and each time I hope it gets better. I want it to be awesome so bad, but it's just lacking a bit. The pork isn't very well seasoned and has also been pretty fatty every time I've gotten it. All in all, their cuban just seems lacking to me.
2016-06-21,4,Had the chance to stop in Hoboken and decided to try this spot. It's very unassuming from the outside and inside a few small tables line the wall. The little kitchen in the back was bustling and several servers were working the few tables which makes me think at normal dining hours(we ate dinner at 4:30) it's busy. I don't eat meat and didn't miss it for one minute while I was eating the veggie empanadas. Absolutely delicious! The bean sauce was amazing. The service was great and the food not only delicious but served beautifully. I'd definitely go back if I had the chance.
2016-06-19,5,I ordered food by phone, cuz ordering on Grubhub doesn't work. I called around 10:55am which the breakfast hour should be closing soon. Fact, I ordered delivery for Omar's stuff toast which everything recommended on Yelp! However, the lady (who has a bit accent) who talked to me was really patient and nice!! She told me that they only delivery for lunch! But I asked her if it could possible for me to get the stuffed toast with my other order of lunch. She asked me to hold on a second, quickly she turned back and asked me whether I would mind the toast would not be warm when the food get delivered to me. I said yes and got my stuffed toast a bit warm when I got them! I ordered Omar's stuffed toast and roast chicken (thigh) with plantain and yellow rice (which the lady recommended me), and French fries. The Omar's stuffed toast is not amazing but pretty good! The filling inside the sandwich is perfectly sweetened! I wouldn't feel heavy when I finished a whole piece of stuffed toast. But 1 piece of it is very filling to me tho! The roast chicken is good, too! The yellow rice is not strongly flavoured (good thing) n not bland as all. However, in general all dishes I had here so far are not strongly flavoured by spices or sauces. The rice and chicken could have a bit stronger flavoured. Other than that, they are all good :)) I can taste the really food from here! Not too strong, but not to light! Like home food, tasted Just right!
2016-06-11,4,The food here is great & the portions are big! It's a small restaurant but it's fine, I never felt crowded. I got the pork chops & they were seasoned perfectly! My bf got the chicken in some kind of white sauce with sautéed spinach  the sauce was the sooooooo flavorful! Overall great but I like the new uptown location a little better
2016-06-06,3,i had to stop in and grab some food as I was starving & the thought of authentic Cuban food had me salivating like a dog on a hot day.  SO pulled out my Yelp app, got busy & decided on La Isla.  This is a small restaurant and it has a few tables (about 6) and counter seating.  I opted for the counter as the only available table was in the back.  I ordered the beef empanada, and pollo asado.  The boyfriend got a pork sandwich.  Ok so the expand was Amazeballs! It was sooo good.  The pollo aside was okay, but this dish calls for cooked onions, and my onions were semi cooked and soaked too long in vinegar.  It was a potent taste.  The rice was dry and the chicken was blah.  I mostly ate because i was starving.  The boyfriend hated his sandwich and was pretty upset about it.  He said it was the worse he has ever had.  I gave 3 stars because that empanada was everything.
2016-06-04,5,Omar's Stuffed French Toast is superb! Very friendly staff, cute cozy atmospehere
2016-06-04,3,We have been to La Isla for dinner several times and never been overly impressed.  But knowing everyone loves it we keep coming back.  This was our first shot at brunch.  We got the omelette with chorizo, mango and caramelized onions.  It was nothing beyond your typical omelette.  It came with Cuban toast, which was served probably 10 minutes before the dish.  Odd.  Also the toast is uber buttered.  I will say the omelette was much better put on the toast as a sandwich.  Their green habanero hot sauce is a must but warning on the level of spice.  We also ordered Omar's famous French toast. I warn you now it is A LOT.  I could only eat half a piece and could not eat the center bite with all the cream cheese.  I would have liked more of a crunch.  If you must order this I recommend splitting this dish if possible.  The service was better then previous visits but still just mediocre.
2016-06-04,4,Great place with delicious food and an awesome atmosphere.  Got there a little early, so did not have to wait.  I know they also have a big carry out business.
2016-06-02,4,One of the BEST cuban sandwiches i have ever had! Restaurant is really small and they do not take reservations but it is well worth the wait! Good for brunch and dinner plus it is BYOB! All around great place!
2016-05-30,4,Really amazing good Spanish coffee in this quaint small restaurant where you can sit by the bar and enjoy it or sit outside in front as you watch people walk by!
2016-05-27,5,You'd be hard pressed to find a better meal at an affordable price in Hoboken. La Isla has one of the best chefs in the country. Great Cuban sandwiches and coffee. Hoboken has shockingly few real good places to eat. Most restaurants (and businesses) go down in the first year. La Isla is the real deal. I try to get there early to get a table, but don't mind sitting at the old style lunch counter when I'm alone. Nice mixed and diverse crowd. A++++
2016-05-22,4,Solid Sunday brunch spot! "El balsero" -poached eggs+shredded beef on a bed of yellow rice - was filling and delicious, and the sopa de pollo hit the spot on this somewhat dreary spring day. Cafe con leche is served in oversized mugs (good for caffeine addicts like myself), and the service was friendly and solid. I'd definitely return if I were in the area!
2016-05-13,2,Ordered the Fritas today, which are 3 small chorizo and meat patties sliders. Tasted awful. The meat was burnt and dry. I didn't taste chorizo at all. I even added ketchup in the hopes of moistening up the burgers, but it didn't work at all. Drank a lot of water at lunch...I wished I had gotten something else off the menu.
2016-05-11,4,I have never gone to the other Isla, despite my best intentions, so I was psyched to finally go to this one uptown.  Coincidentally, my other friends also got a table there at the same time so we got to hang at the bar for a cocktail while waiting to be seated.  We had the ceviche which was delicious, empanadas and camarones.  Atmosphere was upscale and festive.  Like this place a lot.
2016-05-09,4,Stopped in late afternoon midweek & wow what a place.  Got the roast chicken lunch special, one of four specials, with a pick of two sides for only $12.50.   My food was in front of me in less than 3 minutes.  Fresh, hot & well presented.  I went with the yellow rice & beans as my sides.  The chicken breast was moist & flavorful, the rice & black beans spot on, but I kicked it up a bit with green yucateco hot sauce.   The sweating soon followed.  Topped it off with Cuban coffee.  Who needs Havana when you have La Isla, Hoboken baby!!
2016-05-09,3,As one of the few authentic spanish places in the area it's descent you can get better food taste quality and price wise outside of hoboken but not bad the prices could be better but considering its hoboken and the staff can be rude at times
2016-05-04,5,I have been to La Isla many times. I must say that this place is amazing! It has great authentic Cuban food at a very reasonable price. Im not saying it is on the same level as Miami/Hialeah but its close. When we got to La Isla, we were quickly seated and placed our orders. We ordered the Sweet Plantain Omelette and the "La Papa". I also order a Cuban Latte. Everything came exactly as ordered and took about 10 minutes. I also tried to order fried Yucca but they did not have any. Throughout our meal the waiter kept checking up on us and made sure we were doing well. The guys who work here are all hard workers! As for the food... WOW! It is great!. If you are new to Cuban food, please note that it can be heavy but it is definitely worth the extra calories. In addition to the food, i also enjoyed the artwork on the walls. Just as a tip for anyone coming here, come early because it gets crowded very quick! I would highly recommend La Isla to anyone looking for great Cuban food. I would rate La Isla as follows: Food is 5 Stars, Price is 4.5 Stars, Atmosphere is 4.5 Stars and Service is 4.5 Stars. The views expressed are of my own and are my true personal experience at this establishment. My personal experience may not reflect this actual establishment, their quality or someone else's experience at the establishment
2016-05-01,5,Although I've only been here a couple times and don't have a great background in Cuban cuisine, the food was absolutely delicious. Both times I had breakfast. The first time I had an egg sandwich, wasn't exactly Cuban, but it was made very well from what I can remember. I think it was because they didn't skimp on the avo! My second and most recent visit, I thoroughly enjoyed La Papa as my breakfast. It was amazing. You can't come here expecting quite a healthy meal but you WILL be satisfied! The meat in this dish is so juicy and eggs were cooked just right. I think the star of this dish was the sauce. I can't recall what it's called but it's some type of salsa, it is bonkers!! Also they serve a side of complimentary bread with your breakfasts - it's a bit crunchy and super soft inside and they add just a touch of butter. So. Good. Note to newcomers - regular coffee will always come with milk unless you specially request black! They're cubancino is slightly sweetened regular coffee with cinnamon - also very good! I would make sure to come right when they open - it's not a big place and fills up fast!
2016-05-01,3,I'd been a loyal customer since the beginning when La Isla was just a hole in the wall with amazing food at affordable prices. I recently paid a visit after many years and found the food to still be amazing. You really can't go wrong with the menu here. Just be prepared for sticker shock. For what they charge, you can go find yourself a nicer restaurant with the same if not better tasting menu. I need to discover another hole-in-the-wall or hit one of the nicer Cuban places in Hoboken.
2016-05-01,5,We stopped in her yesterday on a whim.    I ordered the Ensalada de Espinaca y Remolacha with chicken.   It was the perfect salad with flavorful chicken, chopped macadamia nuts, avocado, citrus, and a bit of blue cheese.   My husband ordered the chicken in garlic sauce - also amazing!
2016-04-29,4,My friend and I ordered the steamed yuca and veggies as sides, and beef with chorizo in tomato sauce (me) and a pulled pork sandwich (friend) as entrees. Everything was quite tasty and we enjoyed the outdoor seating.I'm allergic to gluten and was disappointed that they wouldn't make a sandwich without the bread and that some of my typical favorites (fried plantains, etc.) were made in a shared fryer.For gluten free folks, you'll have good but limited options. Also, note that sandwiches are under $10 while entrees are closer to $20.
2016-04-28,5,I am falling more and more in love with this wonderful community restaurant the more I eat here. I can make a meal of their most delicious cuban buttered bread and cafe con leche. But I never do as I can happily order everything on the menu and always over order. The bread reminds me of my grandmother's cooking in both its deliciousness and ability to bring comfort. The cafe con leche is spot on, strong, smooth, just enough milk and like the bread, also comforting, plus a great value. Their yellow rice is perhaps the best I have had anywhere, especially delicious with their moist and flavorful oxtail stew they serve on Thursdays (come for lunch as they may sell out, it's that good). The service is warm, kind, and attentive and is the highlight of the warm atmosphere imbued with salsa music and a colorful interior.
2016-04-23,5,Ropa vieja and lechón con arroz phenomenal!!!!!!!!!! The food comes out quick too so no waiting time. Plus it's byob place
2016-04-23,4,Cute little spot. Feels very authentic and love the music they always play. The Cuban latte, papa Rellena, pan cubano and choripan are delicious! Place is small so plan ahead!
2016-04-22,5,Absolutly delicious.  For breakfast the La Isla Huevos Rancheros is on par with any i have ever had and  Omar's Stuffed French Toast is top notch.  Cafe con leche is tasty and reasonable priced.  For lunch the empanadas are above average and the pap rellena is delicious. Any of the daily much specials are really good and are a good value. The staff does their job. I really could not be more pleased and I often go out of my way to eat here.
2016-04-14,5,This place rocks! La Isla is a gem on Washington Street in Hoboken. Great for brunch and/or lunch.
2016-04-10,5,La Isla is awesome. The food's really good and you can't go wrong with any option. The only thing is the seating is limited but worth the wait.
2016-04-06,4,Love this spot, one of my favorites in Hoboken. One of the best Cuban sandwiches you will find. The prices are extremely fair for Hoboken, and the ambience is fun. Their coffee is great as well, either the lattes or just coffee black you can't go wrong. The sandwich is stuffed with pork, topped with cheese, then put on the press until it is crunchy, and melty. They also have a great brunch menu. They were also featured on the food network multiple times, once with Guy, and once with Bobbby. If you are looking for a fun restaurnat with character and great food, this is it.
2016-04-05,3,Food is delicious,but I feel out of place You walk in and no one says can i help you,they just look at you as if to say,"what are you doing here. I've ordered take out a few times and always get the same treatment ."Perhaps they don't like anyone who's not hispanic and my money is no good there. I asked other non- Hispanics. And they got the same treatment as I did ,
2016-04-03,4,Delicious Cuban food in the heart of Hoboken. Great for a tasty brunch or lunch with friends and family. Love love love their papa rellena and their sandwiches are to die for. Top two sandwiches are the original Cuban and the chicken avocado sandwiches! Definitely a must try and gem in Hoboken.
2016-04-03,2,The food is outstanding but the service and attitude of management is mediocre at best. Don't get me wrong, people are friendly... they just take a really long time to serve or acknowledge you, so if you are looking to eat soon or are in a bit hurry don't come here.Also, came in today for Brunch and had the steak and eggs (really good) but wanted some additional food, but the kitchen close at 2:50pm, despite brunch being advertised until 3:00pm.Again, good food and good people, terrible service and terrible management.
2016-04-02,5,Never been here to eat but have stopped by several times to get some coffee. Definitely one of the best coffees I've had. The staff is always friendly and welcoming. Can't wait to go back and try the food.
2016-03-30,4,Plantains good.. Rice good... Beans good.. flan amazing... Love this place ;)FYI this place is byob...
2016-03-30,5,Let me be clear....we moved back to Chicago and here I sit thinking about how great the food and coffee is at La Isla.I really miss this place!!!
2016-03-26,5,1st time here....we walked in and waited by door to be greeted but after about 5 min. I asked the rude server who i tell to be seated...she didnt look at me and walked by me pointed her finger and says put your own name there... I seen her do this to all 8 people that came in...but then we sat ourselves at the diner type counter. The guys there were so nice..and gave us the best service. They were just as busy as Ms. Rude but still had a smile. So our food came and it was amazing!!! So the men service and the food over powered Ms. Rude and deserved 5 stars.
2016-03-23,4,Great spot for brunch.  The three of us each had the Ropa Vieja (skirt steak) and shared an order of pancakes which was perfect, because an order came with 3 of them.  The generous portion of skirt steak was very flavorful and tender. It came served with rice, eggs, and a side of black beans.  Tried the cubaccino drink which was a bit disappointing.
2016-03-11,4,There's Portuguese blood in my veins, but I'm pretty sure there's also Spanish blood from somewhere way back when because I can't get enough of things like Spanish rice and all its many variants. When my friend and I experienced the lunchtime munchies, I did a quick Yelp search for nearby eateries and this spot came up. Luckily, I didn't need to convince her of anything, and within five minutes, we were seated at La Isla.The Camarones Encendido + Yellow Rice and Fries sides = Jumbo shrimp sautéed in olive oil, garlic, onion, peppers, and olives. Was it delicious? Oh my, yes. Was the rice fluffy and yellow and everything my little yellow rice-loving heart desires? Many times yes. I actually think I might have had a foodgasm blackout for a couple of minutes there, as there are some missing frames every time I try to recall the scene of our meal. Oh well. Worth it.The Cuban Sandwich is as scrumptious as you would expect for a Cuban spot. The bread was perfectly crisp, the pork as succulent as jailbait, and everything else designed to make your taste buds sing opera.Service can be veeeeery slow, which is why I docked a star.
2016-03-10,5,Super delicious! I went today for the first time.  It was authentic and the service was top notch.  I felt like I was home.  If you are in the area,  please do yourself the favor.  Lunch hours are pretty busy but definitely worth it!
2016-03-09,5,La Isla is deceiving as it appears old and run down from the outside...but I have been here twice for dinner and will keep going back. The restaurant has phenomenal, authentic Cuban food.  Menu is a good size with a variety of types of food. I have had fish and beef from here and both I would order again. Portions are large and appetizers are good for sharing.  Service was great on both occasions. Of note, restaurant is BYOB.  There is very limited seating during the winter, maybe seating for about 10 people.  There is an outside area in the warmer weather that accommodates a few more people. Would definitely recommend La Isla - probably the best dinner I have had in Hoboken!
2016-03-01,4,First time here after seeing in it on TV a while back. I had Ropa Vieja, delicious and good service!
2016-02-29,4,Serendipitous visit - I was craving some rice and beans, and my friend spotted this restaurant from across the street. The name sounded vaguely like a place that would serve such a dish, so we decided to try our luck. We got here ~5 minutes before they opened on a Sunday, and were the second group in line. Within 10 minutes of being seated, the entire restaurant had filled up - tables and bar. The space is small, so either come early (like we had the luck to do) or be prepared to wait. We had no idea that this restaurant had been featured on TV, but the many posters on the wall and shout outs on the menu tipped us off soon enough. The food was good, but not mind-blowing. Papa rellena is exactly as good as you'd expect a ball of deep fried mash potato stuffed with ground beef to be (that is, very good). Chicken soup was serviceable, but I think my expectations for it were too high after having some amazing versions of the dish in Peru. Ropa vieja had a nice depth of flavor, but the meat did indeed have the texture of old clothes. Yellow rice and beans on the side greatly benefited from the addition of the green hot sauce (super spicy, be warned!). Vegetable empanada was okay, but I tend to really enjoy anything in a baked shell. We finished the meal with tres leches, which was a bit soggier than I usually like it, but the addition of rum and meringue added a nice twist to the dish.BYOB, so no drinks on the menu.Service was friendly and on top of things. Dishes came out super quickly after placing our order.
2016-02-28,4,What a brunching good time!My love and I arrived at La Isla just moments after they opened on a Sunday morning and it was a good thing we did. Minutes after we were seated and settled, there wasn't an open table in the house (save for a few counter spots). We perused the menu, ordered some velvety smooth coffee, asked for some suggestions, and we were on our way to brunchful bliss.La Isla Egg Sandwich - bacon, tomato, avocado, and red onion on multigrain toast. It was a simple sandwich but it packed a ton of flavor. Avocado makes everything a bit more sexy, no? Chorizo Omelet - complete with several different blends of cheese and some of the tastiest homefries this homegirl has ever had. Omar's Stuffed French Toast - Omar, I don't know you but you must be a flippin' genius for creating this masterpiece. Made with egg bread, stuffed with guava cream cheese, dipped in a cinnamon batter, and coated in corn flakes and almonds. This thing was crunchtastic. We took the second piece home and we polished it off the minute we walked in the door. What would it take to get my workplace cafeteria to make this dish on the regular?Cozy, unpretentious, and delish. Now I see why La Isla is a Yelp favorite. Get your hiney out of bed early and head on over for a brunch that shouldn't be missed!
2016-02-23,5,Honestly, I have only had the sandwiches here and every single one was BANGIN'! From the Cuban to chicken bacon avocado (probably not the exact name) you will not be disappointed. Also this place is a great undercover brunch spot! It's BYOB so just grab a bottle down of whatever you want to feel like and you're good. The staff is lovely and attentive without hovering over you every 5 seconds you know? Oh and that Ceviche! PERRO QUE?! Wonderful! They have generous portions so it's perfect for groups or just you and your lady/mans but it is VERY intimate so I wouldn't recommend going with more than a group of four. Above all, a great chill spot for good food and atmosphere!!!! Get it Bruh!
2016-02-20,3,So, I've never actually been here to eat a meal but I stopped there today to grab a quick snack for my toddler and I. Two chicken empanadas were $10. Talk about inflation. They were okay tasting but definitely not for that price. I can get 7 for 10 in neighboring towns. I should've known better. It was packed so I'm sure the food is tasty but those prices just turned me off. Even for Hoboken.
2016-02-18,5,Really simple review -- I really like this place. The food is terrific, the staff is super friendly, and the atmosphere is fun. I usually sit at the diner bar but there are also a few tables too.
2016-02-13,5,Totally lives up to the hype! Downtown location is small so there is always a line, but well worth the wait.  BYOB and fresh-squeezed orange juice are a perfect excuse for mimosas to enjoy with your meal!As appetizers, we ordered a Vegetable Empanada ($5.50) and the Papa Rellena ($4.50). For entrees we had the Saturday special, Arroz con Pollo ($12) and the popular Tasajo con Boniato ($21). Friendly wait staff, generous portions, and amazing food make La Isla a must visit when in Hoboken!
2016-02-07,5,Awesome brunch spot. Haven't been here for dinner yet but brunch is on point. Good portion sizes with lots of options for everyone.
2016-01-29,5,Excellent food. Glad I found this place on Yelp, it kept me out of the chain restaurant my Co worker wanted to go to.
2016-01-27,1,Don't order food for delivery. La Isla will minimize your food. You won't get what you'd usually get dine in. I've paid $19.00 for Camarillo (not including delivery) and received three pieces of shrimp with 2 ounces of sauce. The plantain on the side was 1/2 a banana.. Geez what a disappointment. I just wasted money.
2016-01-23,5,I absolutely love the food here. They have two locations in Hoboken...this one is a BYOB and is small yet very authentic and casual. The other one on 13th, has a bar and is larger and fancier. If you have a party larger than 4, I'd head over there. It's great that no matter which location you choose, the food is the same, so it just depends what type of atmosphere you want. I personally enjoy this location better because it is BYOB. I've been here where I was sat right away and I've also had times where I had to wait about 30 minutes. The food is always impressive...they have truly authentic Cuban cuisine and never make you feel rushed when you are finishing your drinks! I am gluten free and have had no issues finding great options here, they are very accommodating and friendly. For $19 you get a huge steak and 2 sides, you can't beat that in Hoboken!
2016-01-16,4,Words that I would use to describe this place are local, authentic, home made and a bit of advice would be to get a specialty coffee.Cuban Latte:  Strong, topped with whipped cream and perfectly flavored with a little spice of something that was not only original but, I couldn't put my finger on what it was.Pan con Bistec (Cuban Sandwich with Steak):  The cuban bread was crispy yet fluffy and the toppings were fresh.  The steak was a bit dry and lent to the overall dryness of the sandwich.  I wish that there had been some sort of sauce on here to tie it all in and cut out the boring.Arroz con Pollo:  This dish is where it's at.  The spices on the chicken were perfectly marinated throughout the chicken; keeping it nice and juicy after it was cooked.  The rice complimented the chicken and the fried plantains were the perfect combination of sweet and bitter.  The texture was what so many restaurants strive for but, can't achieve.  It must be where they get their plantains. from.I would advise getting here early because there is only a few tables and bar stools and it is pretty popular from what I saw.  This seems to be a family owned and operate place or at least I felt like I was dining at a families house.  So warm and welcome and excellent service from start to finish.
2016-01-12,4,Good restaurant. Very authentic Cuban food and very authentic atmosphere. The size of a small trailer with people crammed in only adds to the fun atmosphere. Fun little lunch place. Cuban is amazing.
2016-01-08,4,Papa Rellena is kind of greasy. But the crispy crust, soft potato and fragrant meat stuffing worth the risk of getting fat. The creativity of combining the ordinary potato and meat together is also terrific!
2016-01-06,5,My number one food place. There chefs and cooks are the best. perfectly made rice, beans, chicken, soups, cuban sandwiches , empanadas, and juice.
2016-01-05,5,Have only come here for breakfast, but this place is quick and delicious. The coffee (both hot & iced) is great, the Manchego, Onion & Chorizo omelette was fantastic and La Isla Egg Sandwich was tasty on the multigrain bread. Have always left satisfied and plan to return next time we're in Hoboken.
2015-12-30,5,Reminds me of the Cuban cafes I grew up on in Miami. These are few of my favorite things: cafe con leche, croquettas de jamon, the stuffed French toast, and the churasco. The food here is perfection.
2015-12-26,5,This is one of my favorite spots in Hoboken, I come here at least twice a month if not more.  They opened a second location in Uptown Hoboken, which I have not been to.The food here is always amazing, I especially love their empanadas, I'm a huge fan of the beef but the chicken is amazing as well.  It's a great little appetizer to start your meal off with.  Their lunch menu is great, my favorites are the shredded flank steak, shredded pork, and their chicken (essentially, their entire menu).  Service overall is great, make sure to get here early as there's always a little bit of a wait.
2015-12-17,4,After a business trip to NYC, I stopped in La Isla on my way out for a quick bite with a couple friends. It's two doors down from a beer & wine store, which is perfect because La Isla is a BYO. They don't seat you until your entire party is present, which was annoying, especially since it was a Tuesday evening and the restaurant was much closer to empty than it was full. I had the masitas de puerco, which consisted of fried chunks of pork with raw red onion on top. The meat was a tad chewy and didn't seem to be marinated at all, but my sides of yuca and black beans added some flavor that the meat lacked. My friends seemed to enjoy their meals more--a salad with shrimp, and smoked salmon on a black bean/rice cake with guacamole on top. For dessert, we split the tres leches cake, which was phenomenal.
2015-12-16,5,A Hoboken classic. Always great. It reminds me of the best Cuban places in Miami. I've been going here for years and I've never had disappointing food or service. Consistency and reliability are what I want in a neighborhood place. I like it all but my favorites are the simple things like fried plantains and cafe con leche.
2015-12-15,5,Not quite a hidden gem - as it was recognized on multiple TV shows - La Isla still maintains a quaint feeling. Its narrow storefront serves up some damn good Cuban sandwiches and plates. We dined al fresco mid-December thanks to this year's strange weather. It was a pleasant, appropriately slow moving experience. Start with a papa rellena - a lightly fried mashed potato and ground beef ball served with sweet salsa. It's an appetizer, but fairly large. They have excellent daily entrée specials. I forgot what it was that I ordered, but it was an excellent combination of braised beef, sweet potatoes, and rice. Very filling and delicious. I would definitely make an effort to come back for the brunch that is raved about by many.
2015-12-13,5,Wonderful dinner!  Hosted my son who lives nearby.  We ate at the counter and loved the interaction with all the employees.  This is a BYOB place so if you want to drink bring it!Recommend easily.
2015-12-11,5,La Isla makes me want to take Cuban restaurants with me to the Bay Area and sit them right next to my apartment there. La Isla prides itself on traditional Cuban fare (at least for dinner, although I have seen reviews below rave for brunch). I came here on a Thursday night with a colleague around 6:45 and to our luck, no line! We snagged a spot on the long bar. FOOD: With the sandwiches and entrees available, I do not think you can go wrong here. I think their sandwich options are good and authentic, so it can be a grab and go for the people in a rush. I got a Picadillo (Cubano, por supuesto) that's a hash of deliciousness going on it. With ground meat, vegetables, cumin, all those great spices, it's mighty tasty. I got black rice (your other choices are white and yellow) and beans to go with. The black rice is delicious with beans and meat in it as well, it's quite filling and tasty, and the beans themselves were very tasty. SERVICE: Pretty standard but attentive! Nothing to complain about here. La Isla is a great place, even featured in Diners Drive In and Dives, but still holds true to its Cuban roots. So delicious and a good one in Hoboken!
2015-12-10,4,Had a great roasted pork, ham, swiss and pickle sandwich, on this amazing sweet bread.  A nice garlic mojo to add some additional Sass.  A great place, and I understand now why people rave about this place.  Has a diner feel, not a huge place, but boy do they pack some love into their food!  Thumbs up.
2015-11-30,5,I've never had a bad meal here which is why it has remained my mainstay destination for top quality Cuban cuisine for more than 20 years
2015-11-24,4,Four of us came on a Saturday night to try out this highly recommended Cuban restaurant. In true BYOB fashion, we brought two bottles of wine and two beers to split between all of us. We ordered the ceviche, pollo empanada, and the papa rellena to start. The papa rellena was the most memorable and unique dish. The other two were forgettable. For entrees, we ordered the chicken with spinach and chorizo pot roast. The chicken with the cream sauce was great, the sauce was not too heavy but provides the right amount of creamy strength to make the chicken tasty. The chorizo dish was slightly dry. Service was fast, restaurant is slightly crowded but overall I had a very good time and would come back again!
2015-11-21,5,Just read the reviews, no need to expand.  Amazing authentic cuban food.  At least that's what they tell me.  I can tell you it is so delicious.  Not a romantic, great atmosphere type of place, but so good.  BYO.
2015-11-16,5,I've been living in Hoboken for over five years now and when I'm in the mood for the best breakfast in town, we go to La Isla. I would recommend a cafe con leche and either the La Isla breakfast sandwich or custom made omelette. The place has a truly unique Cuban feel and the servers always moving about with smiles on their faces. You will not be disappointed with your experience at La Isla!
2015-11-16,5,I love going to La Isla restaurant when I go to Hoboken, NJ.  The food are DARN  DELICIOUS. I have no regrets every time I come go there.  The waiters are pretty cool and friendly. The food is the real reason why I go.  I always order garlic chicken with black beans and Yucca.    Other foods that I have tried are dangerous delicious. I hope that the manager will re-consider to have a La Isla Restaurant in Las Vegas,NV.
2015-11-15,4,Nice Cuban food... The atmosphere is very relaxing with nice music... The black beans are fantastic... And the tostones is what you really need eat to feel at home...
2015-11-13,3,My review is more about the customer service than the food. The churrasco as always was awesome and the stuffed chicken breast was tender and tasted as it was described on the menu. After waiting for a table, we had to wait for the waitress to attend to the couple that was seated after us as they did not look typically hispanic as I do. When I asked the busboy who was to take our order he got another waiter that seemed annoyed that his conversation with one of the "natives of Hoboken" was cut short. I requested 3 drinks and was brought only 2. I waited until our food was served to ask again for the 3rd drink, which was never brought out again, but 2 waiters and the busboy were all jumping all over the place for the expresso that the table behind us ordered. I asked for the check and left before we finished. I have never felt as awful as I did tonight at a restaurant. My money is as good as theirs. How times change when our own treat us with disrespect.
2015-11-06,4,been there twice for breakfast and will go back, the Cubacinno (espresso, warm milk, whip cream and cinamon) very good. The egg dishes with plantains also good. They offer healthy options and service was good.
2015-10-28,4,One of my go-to spots for a hearty Cuban meal that wont break the bank. I don't mind waiting, and almost always there is a wait considering there are only about 5/6 tables and 15 bar stools. Once you are seated, the waiters are pretty quick getting your order in and the kitchen is pretty efficient when it comes to getting your food out. If its appropriate, get a Cuban latte. If you're walking by and want a snack, get an empanada. Brunch? Try El Balsero or Churrasco. The meat is always super flavorful, well seasoned and cooked perfectly. Gotta get the rice, beans and sweet plantains on the side to round it all out. I have seen the French Toast and heard raves about it, so if you're into a sweet breakfast, thats definitely right up your alley. Lunchtime? Go for the Cuban. It's really damn good and the garlic mojo is even better. Dinner? EVERYTHING. You just really can't go wrong with this place. My ONLY qualm, and this goes back to how quickly everything is brought out, is that some sides and popular appetizers aren't piping hot. This is a personal pet peeve, since I prefer burning my tongue over eating luke warm food. I haven't yet tried the uptown location, however it has a full bar and excepts reservations. So they are definitely catering to bigger groups. I'll be sticking to my quaint little hole in the wall as long as I can.
2015-10-22,5,Omg all sorts of YESSSS. I'm usually not a sandwich person but their grilled chicken sandwich is to die for. And their French fries are one of the best I've ever tasted. The place is very small and sometimes crowded but the food is definitely worth it. I love it.
2015-10-21,5,With the exception of my mothers homeCooked Cuban food, this is amazing feel likeYour in Miami cooking.
2015-10-16,1,Literally what has become of a small window shop hallway length store has become La Isla. A hole in the wall, split by a bar and tables up against the wall:/ so to not further wait for a table we eat outside (which tables were available bc it's cold outside 62degrees.)Let's start with a custom watercress salad w onion avocado and olive oil( my watercress salad was not cleaned up well making the salad taste tart:{ My Entree is where this gets interesting.Churrasco(skirt steak) with chimichurri fried plantains and black bean mixed with white rice and pork.Churrasco was made medium well and tasted okChimichurri SUCKED more olive oil then anythingPlantains were great ...but a bit greasyANDThe black bean rice with pork was FUCKING DISGUSTING! The rice looked presentable but as soon as you taste the pork flavor in the rice it taste like pigs grease allow as if you can breath it while you eat it. The taste the rice has taste as though you can only experience that at a butchers!This place sucked ...now my stomach is killing me as I right this review.
2015-10-14,4,Came here once and I got hooked. You must have their traditional Cuban sandwich , it brought me back memories . The only downfall they tend to run out of there Cuban sandwiches :( .
2015-10-10,5,Amazing cuban coffee/ diner this is my go to spot for authentic Cuban food. The appetizers, salads and entrées are all top notch, but the breakfast is even better. Always crowded and usually a wait but that's to be expected from here, handled well by professional staff.
2015-10-05,4,Stopped in for lunch.  This place is very authentic. We shared a beef and a chicken empanadas and they didn't disappoint.  I had the Cuban sandwich which was not the best I've had.  It was on the dry side.  My husband had the beef stew and man was it tasty.  A definite must!
2015-10-04,5,Took my girlfriend here for brunch on a Sunday. Typical Hoboken spot (a hole in the wall). This place is a must try if you're looking for authentic "Cuban" food. Food taste fresh and the flavor is on point. Place looks clean and the service is top notch. Wish they had a spot in NY. Will come here again. I had an omelette with maduros inside. Loved it. Every thing on the menu seems delicious. Their cuban coffee is "crack".....
2015-09-26,4,This place is always packed whenever I go and requires a 10-minute wait for seating. They're one of the few places on Washington Street serving breakfast, which is great if you want something more filling than Dunkin Donuts. The other reviews have already covered pretty much everything I could say. The food is great, the portions are big but not overwhelming, and the staff is very thoughtful (if extremely busy, but who can blame them?). I really enjoy their brunches: fluffy omelets, strip steak and eggs, sweet plantains, even their French toast is good.Only downside, the place is a little small. Good for a small group but anything over 3 people and you'll feel cramped.
2015-09-23,5,Came to La Isla to try Omar's Strawberry Guava cream cheese stuffed French toast. It was AMAZING and I can see why he beat out Bobby Flay. I especially liked that it was crunchy. I had a bite of my boyfriend's chorizo manchego omelet and it was also so very delicious. The eggs were perfectly done -- soft and fluffy. I would highly recommend La Isla and the prices are very reasonable!
2015-09-22,5,I love this place! Fun, fun, fun! One of my favorite restaurants anywhere, and I am an Italian gourmet cook, a hardcore "foodie" and a big wine collector. At 12th and Maxwell Lane, this is simply great Cuban food with a hip bar scene and excellent service. The crowd is a mix of young and older. In a market over served by Italian and steak restaurants, this is simply a great find. The new uptown space is airy and bright with a Cuban flair and a lively, fun crowd. They have kept the casual feel of the downtown La Isla (which is still going strong) upfront but have created a much more upscale dining area in the back. Go, order the garlic chicken (over the top) or anything else for that matter. It's all great at a reasonable price. Finally Omar, the chef, has been featured on the Food Network twice, and the owners are simply the best. Worth the boat trip from Manhattan as it is a short walk from the 14th St. NY Waterway ferry. Go and this authentic Cuban hot spot will forever be on your short list.
2015-09-21,4,When my BF was living in Hoboken, we were big on our weekend brunch game, however laziness and/or being hungover kept us more uptown versus venturing downtown and trying La Isla, which had been on his bookmarks list for forever. We headed to La Isla on the Sunday before Labor Day a little after 11 a.m., with backup brunch places in mind because of Yelp reviews that stated how crowded this spot can get. Luckily for us, there was zero wait, and we picked a table inside, immediately ordering the cafe con leche (skim for me). We picked the sweet spot of arrival time, because not even 30 minutes later, the restaurant, which is small to begin with, was PACKED. The coffee was delicious - so creamy and fresh that you don't need sugar, and will feel a little fuller after drinking one. BF ordered the famous stuffed French toast... and a side of bacon, while I settled on pancakes... and home fries. We definitely overdid it, and probably could have split that delicious French toast, stuffed with cream cheese and strawberry, drizzled in guava (that was battered with a corn flake/nut combo). It was incredible, but I could literally have about two bites of it (despite wanting more) in fear that I wouldn't be able to finish my three massive blueberry pancakes (spoiler alert, it didn't matter because I couldn't finish anyway). The food was phenomenal, and the service was also attentive and warm, without being invasive. Food arrived quickly, the staff was fast to refill glasses, ask if we wanted more coffee (yes), and drop the check at an appropriate time. All in all, awesome brunch spot and worth the wait/walk from uptown. Wish we had come here sooner!
2015-09-19,4,La Isla is one of my favorite restaurants and it has been for close to 15 years. There's really no need for me to write a lengthy review because everyone else has pretty much nailed it. Granted it's cramped and the wait can be long but I assure you that it's well worth it. I've had breakfast here more than anything else but no matter what meal I've ordered, it's been wonderful. Their coffee is the best I've ever had which says a lot considering I drink a ton of it. Even their oatmeal is fantastic. Whenever I'm in Hoboken I try to stop by. Next Sunday is the Hoboken Arts Festival and even though the line to get in with be enormous, I will gladly wait. Great, great place and absolutely worth the wait. See you soon.
2015-09-18,5,I dine here about 2 a month for breakfast.  I love the huevos rancheros, and the service is awesome.  I frequently visit with my 2 year old and they are great with her as well.  Definitely recommend.  Also, always get a side of the cuban bread.  Soooo amazing.
2015-09-15,5,AMAZING!!! The service is good but the food is even better. The roasted chicken is so good and the Bistek de Palomilla is to die for!
2015-09-14,4,I have to say this is one of the best meals I have had in a while!!  I truly believe small restaurants with a select menu provide better quality because their items are fresh and they have their recipes down to a T. With that being said, the atmosphere was super cozy and authentic. I ordered several appetizers with my friends so we could try a bit of everything and we were very content. My mail meal was the shrimp in the wine sauce called, Camarones al Ajillo- It was great!! Super flavourful and the shrimp were not over cooked nor baby size... perfect amount of food. My friends and I shared the Coconut cream cheese for dessert and it was delightful- not heavy or too sweet like many cheesecakes tend to me.  I am looking forward to going back and already decided to get my parents a gift certificate to eat here for Christmas this year.
2015-09-11,5,I got the fritas and some rice and beans and it was all so yummy. The fritas are pretty simple but they were so amazing anyways and the potato sticks inside of it added a nice crunch to the sliders. My boyfriend also got the papa rellena and it was delish!!
2015-09-06,5,La Isla. What to say. Cuban. Authentic. Great music. Great breakfast. Cheap... And I should mention a Sandra sized portion of food (in case you're wondering what that means... it's enough to fill you up if you have a beyond normal appetite). I have only been for breakfast but from what I ate, my friend got and peering eagerly at the plates of other tables the waitera brought out as they passed me by... I would think you couldn't lose ordering anything off this menu.Give it a go if you're in the area.
2015-08-31,4,Papa rellena all the way!While I have enjoyed many different dishes from there, the PR is my staple. Cheap yet rich in flavor, it is a delicious bang for your buck.  I always get at least two with my side of green sauce. The only complaint is that they are not as hot as I would like temperature wise.  While I am sure there are at proper food temperatures, it would be nice when something is made in advance you pop it in the 400 degree oven for 5 minutes.Seating can be nonexistent at peak hours so be prepared to wait or choose take out instead.
2015-08-31,4,I live right down the street from the original location at 1st and Washington and every time I've ordered/eaten here the food has been phenominal. When I first moved to Hoboken, my stepmom who is Cuban, highly recommended La Isla for its authentic Cuban food. Probably one of the only times I will say she was absolutely right... the food will not let you down - the portions are a pretty good size and will definitely fill you up. My boyfriend loved the breaded steak (El Bistek Empanizado) and I'm a huge fan of the chicken empanadas - the yellow rice and beans are a must for a side dish. The reason I only gave 4 stars is because the one time I physically ate at the restaurant, the service was comically horrible. We brought a bottle of white wine - first we asked for a bucket of ice to keep it chilled and they said they "don't do that" (hm???) - then we asked to have the bottle opened and a server literally threw a bottle opener down on the table for us to do it ourselves. Given that it is a "hole in the wall" type place I hontestly wasn't too surprised by the quality of the service, but since then I've only ordered delivery/pick-up. Not the place to go if you're looking for a nice sit down dinner (with remotely quality service).All in all, I HIGHLY recommend the food, but would suggest ordering in/picking up :) I still have to give the new location on 11th and Washington a try! I'm thinking the service may be a little better since they recently opened. We will see!
2015-08-25,5,Food was delicious, service was great.  Definitely recommend the potatoe/beef appitizer that was featured on the Food Network.  Note that its BYO, so if you want to drink make sure you bring something.
2015-08-21,3,I used to come to this place quite often as the food was good and closer to Path.However,my experience was dropped from 4 to 3 stars now.  I often ordered the steak which was dryer each time when I stopped by.  The waitress kept on forgetting my water though I was sitting right in front of her at counter.  The rice was saggy.  I really want to learn to like this place again but have a hard time to do so.Perhaps I should try it again 6 months later....
2015-08-18,5,I've lived in South Florida pretty much all of my life and tried my share of Cuban food. I can honestly say this place serves arguably the best Cuban sandwich. The pork is delicious and the mojo sauce goes with the sandwich perfectly. The stuffed french toast here is also the best. Every bite of the french toast is bursting with sweet flavor. My girlfriend and I split both and the portions were such that both of us had a very full and satisfying meal.
2015-08-15,5,I'm a frequent visitor because this place is great for lunch or dinner. Seared salmon or garlic chicken are good entrées. Their famous papa rellena app is also a must. Seating is limited due to size so it can fill up quick.
2015-08-14,2,The food was good but not the service.  They were disorganized, bringing us incomplete orders.  It was difficult to find the server and when we finally did and asked for the rice and beans that was supposed to come with the dish it seemed as if we were asking for something additional - "Oh, you want rice and beans." Hello, yes, it comes with the Churrasco.   Also my "batido" was served in a paper cup with a lid???  I wasn't ordering take out.
2015-08-11,1,They sold me a spolied Flan. When I picked it up and brought it home, took 1 bite and almost threw up in my mouth. When I called and asked them to deliver me a new one (I live 2 blocks away). I was rejected.OK, ill pick it up. So I went to go pick it up and the owner/manager was there and took a bite of my flan right in front of me and confirmed it was spoiled! I asked them "do you make it fresh?" he said yes on the phone but in person the guy told me it was the only flan they sold that day. So, don't come here expecting fresh food. Also, dont expect them to believe you when you tell them food is spoiled. The only way to prove it is if they take a bite of your food. I was EXPECTING a refund, free dessert or something...what did I get? nothing? He gave me the tres leches dessert; which I really don't like but agreed to take. The portion is way too small to justify the price.Stay away; this place is terrible. No!
2015-08-05,4,Came in for brunch and had the churrasco al caballo, huevos rancheros and their famous stuffed French toast.  The food was all delicioussss albeit all of it was a little cold.  Even with the temperature problems it tasted great, though, so I didn't care.  I also had a mango coconut batido which was insanely good.  It's a really small space so I recommend getting there early...it's tough to find a spot but they do a pretty good job of turning tables.  Not the type of place to go and relax for hours...get in, get your food and get out so that someone else can sit!
2015-08-04,4,I have tried La Isla about 4 times since I've moved to Hoboken. I have not been disappointed yet!So far I've eaten..- Churrasco con Chimichurri (this is the first dish I had, and from then I knew I was hooked!)- Masitas de Puerco (this was okay, but this was probably my least favorite thing to eat from here)- Flan de Leche Tradicional (so good!)- El Cubano (not that I've had many in my life, but this is the BEST cubano sandwich I've ever had!)- Papa Rellena (this was pretty good, and it's pretty filling, too)I've also heard good things about their breakfast items. So one day I'm going to have to come and try that. =]
2015-07-26,5,My wife and I were invited back to laIsla uptown after our poor experience. Special thanks to Andy for making it happen. Our overall experience was Excellent!! The service was beyond good. The staff was very attentive. The food was delicious. Can't wait to return.
2015-07-25,1,I've been to La Isla Restaurant quite a few times and although the food was good as always, I must say that I was a bit disappointed in the service. I went there for lunch one afternoon and although the restaurant was not packed, I couldn't help but feel rushed by my waiter. Now, I'm not one of those people who sits down and takes forever to eat so there was no reason for him to rush me. That was one reason I am giving it only one star. The second is because I was in Hoboken last night with some friends and wanted them to try the relleno de papas. Well, we had a hard time finding parking but when finally did we went straight to La Isla. We did not want to sit down and eat, we simply wanted a couple of relleno de papas. Well, we walked in at 9:48pm (they close at 10) and the heavy-set lady behind the counter rudely told us that they were closed. She didn't even bother to ask if she could help us with anything. She should not have assumed that we wanted a meal or to sit down and eat. What about if we simply wanted to purchase a bottle of water or dessert to go? We did not appreciate her being so rude and short with us. I am very big on good customer service and I've recommended La Isla to many people. I highly doubt that I will go back to this restaurant. The food is good but it's not so good that it's worth dealing with rude people. La Isla- being on Diner, Drive Ins, and Dives doesn't give you the right to be rude to your customers!
2015-07-25,5,My tastebuds are SUPER PLEASED! The food was amazing; the staff was very friendly and attentive! Random choice for early morning breakfast; we will be back!
2015-07-21,4,It's a refreshing change from your typical gentrified Hoboken establishment. (It's been a while since I've been, there may be a Starbucks inside now for all I know will update you soon!) I've never been disappointed at La Isla, fast, easy, cheap, delicious Cuban bocaditos. Authentic flavors, always on point with my palate.
2015-07-21,3,I was really excited to try this place after reading the raving reviews. I have to say its good but not amazing. Papa Rellena - 3/5Pap Rellena with the salsa ranchera (note theres a 1.00 surcharge for the salsa) - 3.5/5The salsa Ranchera is missing a kick. It's good but not great. El Cubano - 3.5/5 Bread was perfect but the pork was too dry and not flavourful at all.Roasted chicken thigh Pollo Asado with yellow rice and Black Beans - 3.5/5  Have you ever tried Sophie's in NYC because La Isla's version is like a healthy version of Sophie's. The yellow rice was not as good as Sophie's. The chicken leg was really flavorful no complaints there. The black beans was also meh compared to Sophie's.Maybe La Isla is the best restaurant in Hoboken? I don't live in Hoboken but was there for a day trip. Will I dine at this restaurant again?Yes to try the French Toast seen on the TV show Throwdown.
2015-07-20,5,STUFFED STRAWBERRY/GUAVA FRENCH TOAST!!!Just typing that made me hungry!!The spot is tiny and feels like an authentic little spot you'd find somewhere down in Miami...Everything I've had was great, my wife is Cuban and vouched for them which is rare so go go now!!Be forewarned it's a tiny place with one row of tables along the wall so be prepared to wait.
2015-07-11,2,I have to give 3 stars, because after hearing all of the raves about this place - they couldn't' serve me! I suffer from a severe mango allergy and when I explained this to our water, they wouldn't serve me.  It does make me question how clean this place really is.
2015-07-10,1,I had a terrible experience in  La isla restaurant.  I sign my name to ge a table and not only it was very hot and noisy but they kept giving my table to couples that didn't even sighn inn.  When I asked why I was waiting for so long and they were skipping names they totally ignore me.  The waiters were very disrespectful specially a heavy tall black hair mexican.  They run around like if  this is a park, very unprofecional.  I will never return to this restaurant nor will recommended to friends and family.
2015-07-10,5,Very high quality when it comes to the food. They don't skimp on anything and it shows on presentation as well as taste. Make sure you get the cafe con leche!!
2015-07-09,5,Great cuban chicken. I'm excited that the uptown location is open!
2015-07-09,5,What a hidden gem! A BYOB brunch place in Hoboken!? That's reasonably cheap and delicious!!? My only complaint is this place is TINY and waits can be long on the weekend- but it's totally worth it. The staff is unbelievably quick and friendly- who want you in and out, at the same time- not making you feel unwelcomed and rushed. The Food Network rated French Toast with guava cream cheese is out of this world. I was only able to have one piece because it is so filling and sweet- but don't worry, a friend GLADLY finished the second. So so good. Come hungry!
2015-07-08,3,Writing a review in hopes the owners will read it...Always ordered from the Washington street location. AMAZING food, great portions.Went to the new Maxwell location for dinner once and got takeout once. Much smaller portions that are not worth the $20 something meal, the shrimp with white wine and garlic sauce had no garlic at the bottom (which is my favorite part), and hardly covered the shrimp which were noticeably smaller, I asked for boiled yuca and got fried ( it's very busy at the restaurant so maybe they didn't hear me ask for boiled) and the black beans were only half filled in the container (again with the smaller portions).The downtown location needs to give the uptown location a few pointers. The location is great, the restaurant has a lively atmosphere, so it would be a shame if it didn't end up meeting the standards we're all used to from the downtown location.
2015-07-03,3,We were super excited to try the new uptown location but it was so disappointing!! We basically have a Cuban diner in prime restaurant space. The food was mediocre at best. Much better spots in Hoboken for Cuban food. We couldn't wait to try everything based on all the reviews but after we waited an hour and a half for our food, we slowly started to wonder. The food came out luke warm and was lacking something, can't put my finger on it. I guess the quality reminded me of a high end diner and I love diners but just not what we were expecting. The sangria was the worst I've ever had, tasted like cheap fruit juice, no alcohol, no fruit. Service was horrendous but will chalk that up to just opening. The restaurant itself felt institutional, and was so beyond loud that the 4 of us stopped talking bc we were screaming. They even addressed that they have a sound issue. Overall, we were expecting an authentic, fun, quality experience and we left disappointed with hopes that it gets better? Maybe we'll try again in a few months.
2015-07-01,5,On a trip to hoboken we came across this Great restaurant. Very authentic dishes and the taste is great. Me and my boyfriend arrived when it was packed, but they sat us down pretty quickly and our service was not half bad, considering how packed it was. We watched as they made the cuban sandwhich, it came out oh so crisp and filled with flavor, and for dessert we ordered mango glazed cheescake it was the perfect ending to the meal. I would definately be a regular if i lived in the area.
2015-06-28,3,This is a review only for brunch. My mother and I went to check things out with high expectations and left disappointed. The stuffed french toast was way too sweet and the juevos rancheros were tasty, but really nothing special. The only positive was the coffee - which was spectacular.
2015-06-27,4,Went for breakfast with my boyfriend both of us were very pleased he got an omelette with cheese and spinach (cheese was light fresh and fluffy.) I got Omar's stuffed french toast, which was on Throwdown with Bobby Flay, it was more of a dessert but sooo delicious! The bread was sweet and flaky and the inside was creamy. Definitely would visit again :)
2015-06-26,5,My favorite spot for Cuban (and possibly Latin American in general) food! This is a no-nonsense jewel that exemplifies what an awesome place Hoboken is for ethnic and diverse cuisine. There is hype associated with La Isla due to their feature on "diners, drive-ins, and dives" and subsequent endorsement by Guy Fieri, so it is a popular spot for visitors, but it is also a very homey spot that locals flock to 24/7. The staff are on their game and know the food they're serving well, so you can ask them if you're feeling at a loss with the menu. My personal go-to's are their great empanadas (both chicken and beef), papas rellenos (glorious deep fried balls of potato stuffed with ground beef), and killer tamales. For entrees, their chicken stew is a really tasty homestyle dish, and you can't go wrong with anything in their specials. I enjoy their platters more than the sandwiches, but the Cuban bread they use is v. good and hard to find elsewhere.
2015-06-24,5,This Place and it's food is Just Married With Flavor, Just Across the City in One Short ride in the Path ($2.75) you'd be in a Great Area with Chill avant Garde Atmosphere that has a variety of other places to enjoy after dinner or even to Explore other Restaurants (LAs Olas  restaurant just up the street, On Tuesdays have a Special deal on Tacos) , One of them is this Cuban Restaurant. Anything and everything is Super Tasty!!! Diner Drive ins and Dives was here and They Loved it too!! It's a Locals Favorite (Ropa Vieja)
2015-06-17,5,After FINALLY coming to Hoboken on a gloriously sunny day, I made my way over to La Isla and can honestly say it was one of my favorite dining experiences of the year. The restaurant is on the small side and as expected, relatively crowded when we entered. After a few moments however, we were promptly notified by the personable employees that the wait time wouldn't be more than a few minutes and thankfully we were seated shortly thereafter. After devouring the famous Papa Rellena appetizer to start and the succulent daily special (Fricasse de Pollo) a few minutes afterwards, any further words will only fail to do this place justice. Suffice it to say, La Isla represents in my opinion, perhaps the apotheosis of unpretentious home style dining in Hoboken.
2015-06-13,4,I had the grilled chicken lunch plate. Its not big so if you have a large appetite maybe you should order the Entree. The breast and wing where full of herby and garlicky flavor but it was dry. It comes with grilled garlicky onions on top and 2 sides. I had it with black beans and yucca. The beans are awesome full of flavor, the yucca is boiled and with chopped garlic on top, it was pretty tasty but I was picturing fried yucca as it doesn't specify on the menu. The white rice is just plain no spices, oil or flavor, but I like that because it combined well with everything else. I took a star away because my food was cold and they had to rewarm it and that took long. My husband had the Cuban club sandwich and he said it wasn't all that maybe because it was cold. :(*a plus this is a BYOA restaurant.
2015-06-13,1,If ur from los angeles, stay away. Food lacks flavor. Only thing i will give credit for is the black beans.  Food was also served cold.
2015-06-10,5,great food...you'll swear your mom is in the kitchen doing the cooking.(that's if you happen to be CUBAN!!)
2015-06-06,1,This is the first time ever that Yelp has failed me (and my bf). We were visiting Jersey from Manhattan and excited to try this place but everything was awful. My shrimp dish was too salty, his chicken was bland, the rice is the parboiled fake kind (he's a Dominican and rejected it), the beans were ok. Got  stomach ache afterwards. Nice staff but the food is awful.
2015-06-06,2,It may seem like an eternity, but just months ago La Isla dished out 4 and a half hours of pure, unadulterated la dicha.  My last visit, however, was just over an hour, and it was distinctly less fulfilling.  The plantains were just as delish, the papa rellena was equally as light and flaky, and the empanada was quite delectable; even the Catalan wine did its best to scintillate the senses (BYOB, of course). Sadly, it was to no avail.  As kismet would have it, some nights are meant to remain just a memory.  I should have seen this coming--the bill for four came to just under $50.  We spent a few extra minutes attempting to empty the contents of our wine bottle, which greatly displeased Victor, our waiter.   Victor requested we make space for the patrons-in-waiting.  But, amigo, surely, there's more time; we loitered by the door for 25 minutes before getting a table.  It wasn't meant to be.  People want this table, pronto--an hour was plenty of time.  Get out. The tip was still twenty percent, despite my company's protests.  Perhaps we should have ordered more food when we still had the chance.
2015-06-05,5,I'll keep it short and sweet: do yourself a favor and get the pollo asado. Great meal for a great price!
2015-06-02,2,To be fair, my review is based on the Cuban sandwich only. I had hopes for this place, but I'm disappointed to say it was the worse Cuban sandwich I've ever had. The pork was extremely dry and it appeared like someone left out the butter. Not what I expected at all. I'll give other dishes a try next time.
2015-06-02,4,Although very small place - it is very delicious. I am a BIG Cuban food lover but I ordered the Strawberry stuffed French toast because it was what everyone recommended. It was amazing. I'm not a big breakfast person and especially not French toast. I regret not ordering something more of the cuisine they're popular for. I recommend sticking to non-traditional brunch food for this reason.Must come early or make reservations (if possible) as it is very small and pretty popular. Next time I go I will be sure to go for dinner
2015-05-26,5,Beyond the expectations!  I've been wanting to visit the restaurant ever since I saw it on an episode of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  It is definitely as good as advertised!  It's located on busy Washington St in downtown Hoboken, so you know parking is a crapshoot.  We came for a Tuesday lunch so we got lucky to find a parking place within a half mile of the location.The restaurant is small and also provides outdoor seating.  The small space is maximized with varied size tables and counter seating so navigating within is tight, especially during the busy lunch rush.  The clean and quaint character exudes the qualities expected from a small family owned restaurant, delicious homemade food with friendly service.We settled on outside seating and started our lunch with their revered Papa Rellena (mashed potato stuffed with ground beef, breaded and fried) with Salsa Ranchera.  Every bit as good as advertised, and then some!  The outside was fried perfectly golden brown.  When I opened the crispy crunchy crust I arrived at a lusciously creamy mashed potato center, that was stuffed with perfectly seasoned moist tender ground beef.  The accompamying salsa ranchera complimented it wonderfully with a smoky spicy finish.  Definite crowd pleaser!Next up was the Arroz con Pollo.  Again I brought high expectations to this dish and again I was pleasantly rewarded.  It was served with the chicken submerged a ring of golden rice adorned with roasted red pepper slices and freckled with vivid bright green peas.  The golden rice was delicously tender almost to the point of being creamy.  The chicken was remarkably seasoned, very tender and still moist.  The dish struck a harmony of deep well balanced flavors and delivered a wonderful experience.  If I had to pick nits, I would prefer the chicken to be boneless although I know traditionally it is not.  I highly recommend this restaurant for both its delicious food and family like service.  I can't wait to return and experience more of their dishes.
2015-05-18,4,This place is really good. Their soup is amazing ! And so are their Cuban sandwiches ! It's a small spot and a bit pricy but it's worth it! The people are very nice also.
2015-05-16,5,I have been wanting to go here for a long time and I decided to take the train there. It's on the famous Washington Street where you can find all kinds of different restaurants, bars, etc. so I had Ropa Vieja (Shredded Flank Steak) with rice and peas and plantains. I also had Papa Rellena (mashed potato stuffed with ground beef) and then breaded and fried.
2015-05-16,3,Came by with my cousins and it was a nice. I arrived a little early but wanted to get a table since it's a very small place and constantly busy. The waiters were really rude and rushing us to order and leave. The food was good but not as amazing as some of the other reviews suggest. We ordered the shrimp ceviche with plantain chips and fried yuca (which was really good). The shrimp in garlic sauce was ok but definitely light on the garlic. I would have preferred the shrimp and sauce to come separately in a bowl since the sauce watered down the rice.The waiters were definitely rushing us out and didn't even offer us coffee or dessert. They almost swept us out with the trash. Please be a little more considerate of your patrons.
2015-05-14,4,I love La Isla.  Growing up in Hudson County I know there is a lot of good (and cheaper) Cuban food out there.  Normally, it would be hard for me to justify paying a premium just to have a meal in Hoboken but there is definitely something about La Isla that keeps me coming.  I think mostly it's the vibe.  I love/hate the cozy nature of the place.  Love it when I can find a seat but too often it is packed.  I am hoping the expansion to 12th street helps with this.  I have been here a bunch of times and have never been disappointed with a meal.  My personal favorite is shooting over for lunch and having a papa rellena along with one of their many sandwich choices.  But make sure to get there right at noon or slightly before if possible to ensure you beat the crowd.
2015-05-13,4,I'm a sucker for a cuban sandwich, BYO joints make me swoon and I can't resist a sizzling plate of plantains. Well, La Isla, I guess what I'm trying to say is me and you, we're a perfect match. The cubans here are gargantuan. One sandwich, a side of plantains and a bottle of sangria is the perfect brunch for two, and most importantly will leave room for some post-meal flan. It's a damn near perfect sandwich- crispy bread stuffed with sweet pickles and thick layers of ham, pork and swiss. Instead of mustard La Isla's condiment of choice is a garlic mojo spread, it's bursting with flavor and really makes the sandwich come alive. I've only ever ordered the El Cubano but I'll have to come in during dinner and try some of my favorite Cuban entrees like arroz con pollo or skirt steak in a chimmichurri sauce. I'm sure if the entree portion size is anything like the sandwich that the food will be spilling off the plate. This is a must try in Hoboken. Call ahead if your coming because it's pretty teeny on the inside.
2015-05-13,5,This place is small and unassuming... However, it has the down-home feel of a diner -- but for amazing CUBAN food! For brunch, I always go for the Omar's French Toast! Cannot go wrong with that! They have great daily specials as well. Great for takeout, delivery and if you can find seating, it is the best experience!
2015-05-12,3,Good food, but over priced and too packed.  The place is too tiny as well.  Perhaps you will enjoy it more for take out.
2015-05-10,5,The Churassco is always on point. Everything else I have had at this place is very well executed. Perfect dive for Cuban food.
2015-05-09,5,Me and my 20+ friends came here last wk for some incredible Cuban food. The churrasca was delish. Portions were huge and the restaurant was cozy. Everyone was satisfied!
2015-05-09,5,Croquetta was awesome. As was the media noche. Next time I am in north jersey I will definitely be back!
2015-04-30,4,Great food!  Luckily, we were able to get a spot at the bar immediately - usually I know there is a really long wait.  As an appetizer got the papa reliena - omg it was amazing!  It looks like a fried ball but inside is mashed potatoes and ground meat - you must get this when you go there!  As an entrée we got a chicken sandwich - which yes I know, a chicken sandwich at a Mexican restaurant but it was soooo good!  The bread was fresh and the chicken was nicely grilled - it was delicious!  Also got the tasajo con boniato - which was also very delicious!  Had rice and meat on top - amazing!  I definitely recommend eating at La Isla - everyone is also so friendly and great service!  P.S. It is a BYOB
2015-04-29,5,I have eaten from here on two occasions.  The first time, I ordered dinner through delivery and the second time I went to pick it up for breakfast.  Both meals I received from here were amazing.When I ordered dinner, the food was delivered very quickly and arrived hot.  I got the croqueta preparada as my main meal.  I also knew I needed to try the papa rellana and chicken empanadas.  The sandwich was so tasty and the appetizers were delicious, as well. I have had La Isla on my list of places to visit for breakfast for a long time and happened to be in downtown Hoboken and couldn't pass it by.  It was 9:00 A.M. on a Wednesday morning and it seemed like a hidden party once I got inside- it was packed!  it is a tiny spot but with the weather getting nicer, I noticed people were opting to sit outside as well, which added some space.  I had to try Omar's stuffed french toast since it appeared on the Food Network- and OH MY GOD! I am not normally a breakfast/sweets person but this was out of this world. It came with two pieces and I was only able to eat one which left me with a nice after dinner treat.  The woman who took my order was very prompt and came to take my order as soon as I walked in.I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone and I can't wait to bring my family here next time they come to visit!
2015-04-29,4,Their palomilla steak was on point along with their cheesecake surrounded with mango purée and coconut shavings.The crust was very different; sweet like caramel which worked very well w/the cheesecake. The location is small and very busy for brunch, which you may end up being on a wait list. On weekdays they only offer their famous stuffed French toast until around 11am. The way they dip the French toast with cornflakes and almonds makes it so different from other stuffed French toasts. The toast itself has such a fabulous combination of subtle flavors that really come together. It's crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. I felt it needed a little more cream cheese to better balance out the amount of strawberries in it's stuffing (this is just my opinion of course). Parking can be a nightmare during the brunch weekends. Everything tasted delicious and would recommend.
