2021-11-08,5,Very cozy and friendly environment, having top notch service by front staff which is very rare to find in Indian restaurants and best quality food with very balanced spices Try out their cocktails and other drinks mine favorite is jaljira and tamarind margaritas
2021-11-07,4,My girlfriend and I ventured to Empyrean Indian Kitchen on a Friday date night. We were greated at the door and immediately seated inside which had a classy and elegant ambiance. We started off with an order of drinks which were very tasty. While they are a bit on the expensive side, I recommend trying some of them as Empyrean is known for their indo-fusion cocktails. As an appetizer, we shared the steamed chicken momo which was phenomenal. The chicken was well cooked and we opted for the steamed version over fried to stay on the healthy side. If you're a fan of dumplings, you'll definitely like this dish. Lastly, we finished with an order of garlic naan and chicken tikla masala. The taste of the gravy was excellent and definitely hit the spot. Overall, we highly recommend Empyrean as its one of the better Indian restaurants in downtown Hoboken.
2021-10-24,4,Came to Empyrean on a Friday night with my boyfriend. The restaurant has outdoor seating but we decided to eat indoors and we loved the decor and vibes. Service was very fast as well. We were served complimentary papad and chutney and we started off with drinks. I got the Mumbai Mule and my boyfriend got the Tamarind Margarita, both were great! There were a lot of Indian fusion cocktails on the menu that looked interesting. We ordered steamed chicken momos and it was delicious, especially the sauce that came with it! As an entree we split chicken tikka masala and garlic naan and we asked for a 4/5 spice level, which they were able to meet. The dish was very flavorful and the portions were enough for two people to share. Would definitely come back again!
2021-10-23,4,I would have given them five stars but for the past couple of orders we have been getting uncooked food and dust in the food... which is not acceptable as they charge a premium for the food. When the restaurant had started they had great food and looked like they paid more attention to the cooking.
2021-10-17,5,This place is incredibly under rated. The food was unbelievably delicious. The only thing we hate is that we live in Manhattan and will have to drive now every weekend to enjoy their delicious food. It is not a fancy place at all, so don't dress up, wear your stretchy pants and sneakers, and bring the family. Excellent food, good service.
2021-10-09,5,Omg amazing food and amazing service.. our waitresses were name Mumtha and Sushma and they were super sweet..  and yes I actually asked for their names because they were so welcoming and treated us so well..  authentic Indian food I must say and full of flavors.. we had a party in our mouth... will definitely go by again with our family..
2021-10-07,5,We had cheese naan, fried chicken momos, chicken tikka masala and lamb vindaloo and absolutely everything was delicious! First time here and we will be back, service was also fantastic!
2021-10-07,5,Food was amazing! From the cheese naan to the chicken tikka massala. Flavors were packed right and nothing was overpowering. Highly recommend
2021-10-07,5,Amazing food and superb service. I highly recommend the vegetable biryani. Dal Makhani and Kadai paneer are also awesome. Be careful ordering spicy, it can get be spicy. Medium spicy works best.
2021-10-07,5,A late night dinner hunt and then you arrive at the right place to satisfy your hunger. This Indian kitchen is delicious with fine cocktails. I always have a habit of ordering the cocktail with the weirdest name and this time it was "The Gujju Misunderstood Smash". If you're a whiskey lover then this one is the drink for you with a hint of ginger, fresh mint and cucumber. My friend ordered "Somrus mango martini". A drink with its own taste, not a fan but it was okay! Coming to appetizers, ordered delicious steamed veg momos. Try this for sure if you're visiting this kitchen. For the main course ordered Tandoori roti and Paneer Kaju Makhani. Tried this combination for the first time and it was tasty. If you'll order medium it will be a bit sweeter however, you can go for the spicy one. The rice is provided on the side with curry! The ambience is perfect. Service was excellent and friendly. They make sure you get what you like and keeps on checking with you in case you've issues with the food or need anything else. Thank you for the hospitality. Kudos to the cooks for serving the delicious food!
2021-10-02,5,It was a recent find for me but I must say they have the best momos I have found in Jersey. In addition, they have their own menu of cocktails which is basically a spinoff of traditional ones. I recommend the Mumbai Mule!
2021-09-30,5,One of the best Indian restaurants I had encountered. I really enjoyed the vibe and the food was $$$$$ really very good. Don't forget the Momo please.
2021-09-28,5,We were in town only for a day, we love Indian food, but we never know what we're going to get. We travel around the country visiting different places and reviewing them. Our family of 5: a teen, a pre-teen and an 8 year old, the kids can be pretty picky, but everyone liked the food here. We ordered the chicken curry, chicken tikka masala, and the lamb roganjosh. Everything was delicious and we all had plenty. The kids loved it. We all loved their naan too. We tried the garlic naan, the onion naan and the plain one. The servers were very nice also. This restaurant is located in a very convenient place close to the train to NYC, so it was nice that we could use the bathroom before going back to NY. We noticed that gratuity was added to the check. In most states or cities around the country it's not included to groups of 5, but I guess here, it is. That's ok. I noticed some other reviewers mentioned that this restaurant is on the pricey side, and it is compared to other cities, but we assume it's "normal" for this area of the country. We would go back to this restaurant.
2021-09-24,1,Ordered (delivery) from Empyrean Indian Kitchen. Momos didn't had the spicy sauce which was a bummer and it killed our experience. The chilli chicken was bad! It had no salt and was extremely hard.Cauliflower manchurian wasn't cooked at all and had rawness to it. Worse Indo-Chinese food. This is the first time I ordered from here and looks like it would be the last time as well.
2021-09-24,4,The food was delicious (butter chicken and fried paneer momos) and inside decor is modern and very stylish. Also, all the staff are very friendly. The wait for food was kind of long but was worth it. Definitely will be going again!
2021-09-21,5,The salmon from here is amazing! Cooked perfectly every time. Food is always hot when it arrives too! The spinach and cheese is also amazing. The chicken tikka is better at karma. The mixed grill here is delicious!! Highly recommend the mix grill and the salmon. Yum! Prices are fair.
2021-09-19,5,This is a very excellent Indian restaurant that deserves more attention. The food (we ordered two curries) is excellent, very flavorful and thick. I also love the attention to detail in the food and atmosphere; the cutleries, wall decor, etc. In comparison to the other Indian restaurants in the area (I have had almost all, either through dine-ins or deliveries), this is one of the best. Will definitely come again.
2021-09-16,5,First off I would like to start by saying that I would highly recommend this place to everyone!!! First, the service was fantastic. Our waitress, Sushma, was attentive and kind. Also (I didn't catch his name), but the person who was the manager / owner (I think) also came by to check in with us to make sure everything was going well. We ate outside on their deck. They have plenty of outdoor seating that has a great relaxed ambiance. Nice lighting, music, etc! The food was wonderful as well. We got a salt lassi and a Mumbai mule for drinks. The salt lassi was tasty and the Mumbai mule was great as well! The mule was a little spicy and had a great ginger taste. For food, we got Gobi 65 as an appetizer. This was probably my favorite out of everything! Spicy, so flavorful and would highly recommend this! We got the veggie momos that were awesome as well - they had a great texture and bold flavor. Lastly, we got the chicken kali mirch that was flavorful and delicious! We were in the area by chance, but live about an hour away but we have already been planning on how / when we will be coming back :) Once again I would highly recommend this place! Thanks to the restaurant and its staff!!!
2021-09-11,5,We were  looking for best place to get some Indian curry, empyrean came up. Good ambience, we ordered cocktail which was out of this world, peanut chaat with chicken momo's were amazing. Saag & Chole are the best. Our server Sushma was friendly and very attentive. Look for Sushma when you go there...
2021-09-10,5,Amazing indian food with very reasonable price-portion ratios. The garlic naan is probably the best ive ever had, and the curries were all very delicious. Best to order one entree per person and share the meal 'family style'
2021-09-10,5,Great food and ambience. You don't need to go to jersey city to get high quality Indian food with an upscale vibe.
2021-09-09,4,Really good food and cocktails! Servers were very friendly and polite. As vegetarians, we ordered the paneer steamed momos - these were great but would've loved a tangier sauce. Our friends ordered the goat biryani which was really good - the meat was tender and very tasty. The Tandoori chicken was okay - they say it would've been great with a bit more chaat masala. The jal jeera martini and the mango chilli martini were great! We ordered the Kolhapuri martini which tasted a lot like cucumber water and didn't have much flavor. When we mentioned this to them, they quickly offered to replace it for us. Would definitely come back for the great flavors and service!
2021-09-03,5,Great service, great Indian food, great atmosphere and great hospitality what more can you ask for when you're in Jersey.
2021-09-03,3,I went to Empyrean Indian Kitchen recently with a friend. It came highly recommended and I was looking forward to our dinner. We ordered a mix grill platter and papdi chat. Their mix grill platter was delicious. It was served hot and everything was cooked to perfection! Loved it ! The only issue was that we weren't given any serving spoons (I don't want to nitpick but i was surprised they don't give you that when you order a kebab platter!). I was disappointed by their papdi chat. The papdis were soggy and that just takes away the essence of this dish... We didn't enjoy it at all. Overall, it was an okay experience. I will most likely go there and try a few other dishes that were recommended to me (although I am not sure now as Papdichat was one of them).The complimentary papad was also soggy (it was almost like a stale roti)... i wouldn't give that away to my customers if i know it is subpar. As soon as I took a bite I knew I was looking at a mixed experience. Glad we ordered their platter. 4 stars for the platter. 3 over all...
2021-08-28,5,I went here with my family and cousins and had a great experience. The food was so good and tasty. We were having a difficulty choosing what to order and Mr. Rana the manager of the restaurant was kind enough to help us. He suggested we get the tamarind margarita and the jaljira margarita with our food; he said it would go well with our order. We took the suggestion and it turned out to be a great choice, the food was so well cooked and the drinks really brought the whole thing together & to top it off the staff was so nice and friendly and the whole aura of the restaurant was very comforting. I will definitely be returning and recommending this place to my friends. 100% worth my money and I'm so pleased I found this restaurant.
2021-08-28,5,I have been here thrice & will be definitely going back more frequently! We had Khoya Kaju, Paneer, Momos, Saam Savera, Methi Malai mutter - everything was delectable. Their staff members are so welcoming & caring. Rana, the Empyrean's manager is really nice, friendly & made sure we had perfect experience as I was with 2 little girls. Their drinks & deserts options are great & very interesting. My friends & family loved everything whatever we ordered. In addition to it, love the ambiance & enjoy outdoor dining. I have also ordered online & the experience has been flawless.
2021-08-28,4,Nice food... order medium spicy, the spicy is superspicy for indian standards too... amazing lachcha paratha, pudina chilla paratha, daal, gobi manchuria, pNeer kali mirch . Few sabji  are little oily though
2021-08-27,5,Great food & drinks, amazing service and nice ambience.Their cocktails have desi touch and are quite interesting. We had paneer momos, dal makhani & gobhi manchurian - everything tasted nice! Gulab jamun was so soft, it just metled in the mouth.Our group liked everything we ordered - definitely one of the best Indian restaurant in the area.Sushma & Mamta were very sweet. Even Rana, the manager kept checking in between so we are happy. Their menu is quite extensive, but they take time in explaining what they offer.
2021-08-27,2,I went to Empyrean yesterday reading the good reviews. We ordered samosa, papdi chaat, butter chicken and chicken korma. The food was extremely average and very ordinary. The service was also quite lousy even though there weren't many customers. We had ordered two beers and had to remind our server multiple times. Overall, a very disappointing experience. Wish I would have gone to Raaz instead in Jersey City!
2021-08-26,5,I had a really nice time at Empyrean Indian Kitchen. The restaurant has pretty interiors. The food was delicious, the drinks were refreshing. What stood out was the excellent service by Mamtha and Sushma. They were attentive, sweet and knowledgeable about the entire menu. The chicken 65, chicken momos, rasmalai and gulab jamun were my favorites and we'll definitely be coming back for more!
2021-08-26,5,The place has good food and super amazing staff!! Definitely worth going for momos!!!
2021-08-25,5,Delicious food! Fresh! Good service. Yummy drinks! And amazing hospitality ! Very welcoming. We always sit outside (so I can people watch), but the inside is beautiful! Highly recommended!
2021-08-25,5,Amazing food . Probably the best food in NYC and NJ. Amazing serviceFriendly staff ! Awesome musicCan work a little on the interiors though
2021-08-20,5,It's an amazing place with delicious food. Great spot and outdoor seating. The staff and manager are so nice and welcoming. The Delhi spiced mojito is so good The Resmi kabab was next level. Highly recommended
2021-08-13,5,This is legit delicious food full of flavor. Their appetizers were finger licking good and we were scraping the dishes for the last bit of sauce. This place should be given a chance. Their marketing needs a push to get more people in the door but their food is solid. My new favorite for indian curries!
2021-08-11,5,A little on the pricey side . 1.5x per dish  . But worth it. The fish tikka/salmon sizzler was very tasty . Along with the mango somrus drink
2021-08-08,5,Everything about this spot is awesome! The food, the service, the consistency, the variety, and oh did i mention the food? we generally order in but this time we had landed after a really long flight and just drove in for a meal. Even though we reached 25 mins before close of kitchen, they were nice enough to accomodate us and served us fresh food and quick. To start we had the samosas and masala chai. For the mains we ordered Lamb Roganjosh, dal tadka and aloo gobi. We generally order the saag subzi but changed a bit today. Had no space for the dessert but their gulab jamuns are great. Along with the roti, we also had the mint paratha which was delish. All in all, we are regulars. Best Indian food in recent times. Atleast what we've had. Our server, Mamta was extremely couteous and ever smiling. Great team. Both in and out of the kitchen.
2021-08-07,4,The food is authentic and the service is fantastic!  Great addition to the Hoboken Indian joints.
2021-08-04,5,I have been here twice now and will be definitely going back more frequently as they have started DJ nights with Bollywood music on Fridays and Saturdays. We went there to try the momos and they didn't disappoint. All the tandoor dishes are very nice and served sizzling hot as they should be. Special shoutout to the Bartender Kero for amazing cocktails with an Indian touch. The drinks are as interesting as their names. The manager Rana is a warm, welcoming and friendly guy.
2021-08-01,5,It's always difficult to find great Indian food when you move to Jersey after 15+ years in Manhattan. Having said that Empyrean is hands down the best Indian I've had on this side of the river. Not only does it compete with places you'll find in the city, but in most cases, it's better.
2021-07-31,5,amazing experience. Service is great and rana really take care of us. Highly recommended !!
2021-07-29,5,A nice place to have Indian food. I did not try their curries so cannot comment on it but the mixed Grill and lachha paratha were good.
2021-07-27,5,Had dinner there on Sunday with a friend from Rajasthan who now lives in Jersey City. Really pleased in every way.The staff, service and food were tops.Walked across the street and caught the train back home after dinner.
2021-07-24,5,Loved the place! The cocktails are interesting. Do try them out.There are enough food choices to cater to a variety of pallettes. We ordered common Indian dishes and they came out really good - I would rate their quality as comparable to the best in the area.The staff was knowledgeable about the food & drinks and service was good. We were a large-ish group and everyone of us was pleased with the food, drinks, and service.
2021-07-24,3,I was really looking forward to checking this place out because a friend had recommended it. Starting with the good first - the food came in good portions and was tasty, although could have used some salt. But a few things which could have been better are - Hygiene - this is particularly important in covid times and the staff kept touching the glasses and pots where it came in contact with the food instead of holding the handle. Space/ order - The table wasn't big enough to accommodate the food we ordered and the staff didn't offer to join two tables to make it comfortably for us. The place was mostly empty. I was worried the entire time that something on our table will fall if I tried to get a serving. They also forgot our appetizer and we had to remind them when the main course came. Had the appetizer been there before the main course, may be we would have had a bit more space on the table. Dishes - We were given only one small appetizer dish which wasn't replaced for the main course. So you can imagine eating roti and the entree on a tiny dish and the confused look on our faces, thinking how nicely we could have eaten at home with a proper plate and not worrying about knocking things off our table. I must say finally the staff noticed this and offered to give us dining plates. I also didn't like that one staff was chewing something the entire time she took our order or brought us our drinks and even tried to take it away before it was finished. I hope this was a one off instance because I would have loved to order from here in future.
2021-07-19,5,I have ordered to go from this place a couple of times now. I always get the momo's and it is DELICIOUS!!! The aachar that comes with the momo is amazing!! Will definitely keep ordering!!!
2021-07-17,5,So Glad this spot opened up In Hoboken! Been here so many times as a local and hands down the  best Indian food experience- and coming from a true Indian foodie that's surrounded by options in the JC area- this says a lot for the quality. The ambience is great - good for dates too. Food is amazing. The naans are soft, curries hit the spot and chai is amazing. My husband and friends loved the Margarita options too. Service is really quick even on busy nights and everyone is so friendly. If you haven't eaten here you are missing out on something! Try their Dal Makhani and Gobi Manchurian if you are a vegetarian. Never fails.
2021-07-12,1,We often order food from Empyrean Indian Kitchen because of its quality and taste.I've recommended this place to tons of people in last couple of months, to order food from. We liked chicken biryani the most among all.But this time, it was very bad experience for us. Me and one other family ordered food but quality was not the same. Chicken biryani was too spicy and taste was also not good.I wanted to bring this to your notice, so that you can look after it. I like the food from this place in general.
2021-07-10,1,Ordered takeout - a chicken kebab and a lamb kebab. They were terrible. Looked and tasted like they were cooked in red food coloring and raw spices added on top. Calling the food from this place average would be an insult to other Indian restaurants. Why bother putting dishes under diff name if they all look identical (red color!). So disappointed.
2021-07-08,5,Amazing food.  Rana, the manager, helped me pick an amazing dish fitted to my picky taste.  Food can be either very spicy or not spicy at all, accordingvto your taste. Just talk to Rana!Will adopt this as my "to go" restaurant.
2021-07-05,5,Went in person this time after getting take out a few times - the food was excellent!!Lamb in the lamb tikka masala was very tender. We also got chicken 65 to share and it was sweet and delicious. All the food is so well spiced/seasoned.The server also noticed we ran out of rice and gave us a heaping new mini pot of rice without us even having to ask :D
2021-07-05,4,Solid Indian place with nice seating and presentation. They have a long menu, but we wish they had a lunch menu because it can be a lot of food for a high cost lunch.
2021-07-04,5,Great place to visit.The quality of the food was amazing and loved the Paneer chilli sizzler and cheese garlic naan.Also liked the Shaam Savera.the service provided by all the staff members was excellent Must recommend
2021-06-30,5,Love the Dal Makhani here! It's really the best one that I have had in my life. It's always hot, correctly spiced, and tastes great with the rice.
2021-06-28,1,Read so much good reviews but overall disappointed with the food and service. It is too pricy with not at all good food. Service is really pathetic and noone listen to you. If even you visit here, stay away from Momos. These will be the worst you would have ever tried. They dont know what chutney should be serve with Momos. We wasted our evening here just about complaining the food because it was so bad. Not going to go here ever.
2021-06-25,5,This is so far the best Indian food I have had in USA since 18 years. New vibes, nice decor with outdoor dining, good in quantity, friendly staff. I will be going here on regular basis.
2021-06-24,5,Came here one afternoon with my dad, manager was very friendly and the food was amazing. This place is extremely underrated and serves very authentic and tasty food. Definitely my favorite Indian restaurant in all of Hoboken and better than every one I've been to in Jersey City. More people need to know about this place!!!
2021-06-21,5,Visited down there with my friends, pretty good food and service. One of the best places to have Indian food as well as fancy cocktails too.Recommended to have food here.
2021-06-18,3,I didn't like the mojito, but they had good service and replaced it. It had too many jalapeños.  Large selection of food and plenty of vegetarian options. Flavor is average and prices are a bit high. Indoor seating is a bit dark. I got the Kaju Paneer Makhani and wish I chose something spicier. I thought it was odd that after asking the server how spicy my curry would be, they told me that none on the menu are spicy.Overall the taste of food didn't blow me away, but it satisfies an Indian food craving.Menu: empyreankitchen.com/main...
2021-06-18,5,This is Hoboken's fourth Indian restaurant but by far the best. It is relatively new, but if they sustain their food quality and service it will be very quickly be one of Hoboken's finest. The containers they serve food in are also unique. The location is also great, very close to the station with ample parking space.Special shoutout to Sunil (owner)? Rana (manager), Arjun, Mamta and all the staff who are energetic, polite and young.Really hope they continue treating all customers with the same care.
2021-06-14,5,Incredible food with great service; ordered through UberEats and even though the wrong order was sent. The restaurant went above and beyond and sent their staff with the right order! My go-to spot for Indian food In Hoboken!
2021-06-13,5,This is by far the best Indian food I have ever had! The food was fresh and everything tasted really good ! The drinks were good even though I thought a little kore alcohol could be added in them ! Lol. All around a good restaurant and the owner is super attentive!
2021-06-12,4,The main reason to pick this place is obviously the Momos. If you are not familiar with these then think of it as a spicier and juicier version of dumplings. Still a pretty rare sight on the desi food menu's so whenever you see one definitely go for it. The ones here are pretty decent, I counted 9 of them, with lots of filling. Haven't figured out the grainy texture though. Other items are good too. Moderately priced for the area with decent portions. They actually include rice with curries which is also rare these days. Came with eco-friendly packaging.
2021-06-12,5,I was really looking for a great Indian and Nepalese food place and Empyrean was the answer!The highlight of the meal was the vegetarian momo and the chutney was very authentic and yum!
2021-06-11,5,Went there again today and things have changed since I visited last time and it has just increased in their excellent service and we met Rana the manager and his a down to earth person very nice and professional, he took care of us and made sure that our food and service was great and omg the server(mamta) she is a gem so professional and polite i wish whenever i go there she should serve me. Excellent service by her even though she wears a mask you can feel that she is smiling and has that happy face, she enjoys her work. Thank you mamta , rana and yash. Thats why we come back here always
2021-06-09,3,To begin with, their menu is rock solid for an Indian restaurant in the Hobokken neighborhood.The non veg starters were good but the vegetarian papdi chaat had a little stale taste to it. The restaurant does have a great combination of Indian cocktails that go well with the starters.The main course was average as well. The onion kulcha had a weird and offputting taste to it.
2021-05-25,1,This update is for chow-mein only.. we asked for chowmein and fried rice.. they said that they do not have fried rice but they said they can make it for us! BIG MISTAKE!! Rice and noodles both had same vegetables and same spices.. lemon rice with lots of turmeric and salt. No sauce nothing.. same with noodles- lots of Turmeric and same four veggies- cauliflower, broccoli, peas , carrots! If you are here for curries and bread- go for it.. if you are here for indo chines- big no!PS- pictures attached without filters.. Turmeric poured in the dishes with eyes closed.
2021-04-24,4,We ordered take out and it was very good. Totally hit the spot for what we were craving. Got the saag Chana which was excellent!!Korma chicken was ok, glad we tried it but probably will try something else next time.   Chicken Marsala was very goodNaan good but a bit small. Make sure you get extra!Samosas excellent Overall this made for a great dinner and glad to have this addition to Hoboken
2021-04-19,4,Only did delivery from here, twice. Both were the same order. Lamb Biryani and Veggie Samosa. Seriously fantastic. Only "knock" is the lamb biryani needs more lamb chunks and less rice. It's $21 for the Lamb Biryani and it is 80% rice and 20% lamb. They need to fix the lamb to rice ratio. To their credit, the portion size is huge - but again, it is mostly rice.The sauce they include with the Lamb Biryani on the side is ridiculously good. I have no idea what it is - but mix that in with the biryani.The samosa are great. You get two for $6.If they add in more lamb chunks to the biryani, it gets five stars. For now, it is only four stars.
2021-04-17,4,Finally a good traditional Indian resturant in Hoboken. And it's right by the path! I've gotten take out from this spots a few times and have also dined in once. If you're dining in, I highly recommend trying their cocktails. They're very creative (and spicy) and compliments the food really well. I tried the jaljira (cumin) margarita and it was surprising really good. We Indian people love our cumin, but I never thought it'd taste good in a marg. My girlfriend got the delhi spiced mojito, and that was also very good. For food, the steamed chicken momos is a must. Honestly probably the best item on their menu, and one of the best chicken momos I've had. The meat is seasoned very well, and not too spicy, and the sauce that comes with it is amazing. Any of the tandoor meats are also very good. I've tried the mixed grill and all the meat on it was very tasty. The chaat dishes are really big, so I'd recommend ordering that if you have at least a group of 4 people to share it with. For dinner, we ordered the lamb rogan josh which was very good. Highly recommend this curry. The only thing we weren't pleased with was the lamb keema naan. There's literally no lamb in it, which we were disappointed with. But overall, all the food I've had here is pretty good and definitely will be back at some point.
2021-04-15,5,Finally got to check out this restaurant by the Hoboken path! They have a nice outdoor seating set up, hopefully I can sit there when the weather gets warmer! The interior is really nice too.The service was great. The bartender insisted we try the cocktails so we got the jaljira margarita and the delhi spiced mojito. Both were really good. For appetizers, we got the fish pakora. They were really good!For entrees, we got the tandoori chicken sizzler and the goat rogan josh with garlic and kheema naan. Everything tasted delicious; however, the kheema naan was not really kheema naan, there was barely any meat in the naan, it might as well have been a plain naan.Service started to get a bit slow after we finished our food, so we didn't end up getting dessert.Overall, I'm really happy with my experience here. The service was friendly and the flavors of the food hit the spot. Can't wait to come back and try more things on the menu!
2021-04-04,5,We dined in with our two young kids last weekend. It was a great experience! Food is amazing and so is the staff! If you haven't been, I highly recommend!!
2021-04-03,3,Great for indian street eats, not so much for main course. We loved the momos here. Will definitely go there again to have them
2021-04-03,5,We ordered - veg momos, paneer tikka, shaam savera, dal makhni, masala bhindi and bread basket for delivery! All the items were perfect in terms of spices and the quality was amazing! Looking forward to trying more items from the menu.
2021-03-29,4,Honestly I'm happy I got to try this spot, it is a very good one y'all! My friend and I decided to spend a rainy Sunday in the 2 places we've been wanting to try and this was one of them.  The restaurants is nice, neat, great ambience and food presentation (and taste) was top notch.  We started with veggie momos, I think I inhaled those bad boys in less than three seconds, took longer to bring them than for me to eat them.  We also ordered a jalapeño margarita (for my friend) which he really liked, I wasn't  a fan of the mango margarita, it tasted like medicine but honestly I'm not into drinking alcohol so that could've been why.  We also ordered the veggie byriani, paneer tikka masala and some black bean stuff that I don't remember but it was really delicious!  We enjoyed every single bit and second of it.  We had to take some to go because it was a lot of food for 2.  I strongly recommend this place, you should try it out, it's worth it!
2021-03-27,4,Ordered the masala chai, chilli tawa paneer, gobi manchurian, saag paneer, and garlic naan. All of the food was delicious and well-balanced. The garlic naan was one of the bests that I have had. The only complaint is service. We got food before getting our plates/utensils. Water refills took some time after asking. Table was full of empty dishes after asking to remove them. Overall, good food and would go back.
2021-03-19,5,Really good Indian foodPerfect portion for order inMust try chicken monos (nepalese dumplings and tandoori chicken)Going to be my go to place for Indian food. Class apart from rest.
2021-03-15,5,Bumping it up to 5 stars. We have now consistently ordered from here and seriously the place is authentic! The Bombay aloo is mind blowing...and the butter chicken too!
2021-03-13,5,I love this place! This and Karma are the best Indian restaurants in the area. This place has really good indo-Chinese dishes, which are unique to Hoboken. Very delicious food and nice restaurant. If they keep up the service and quality like Karma cafe, they will definitely be staying in business for the long hall.
2021-03-04,5,Delicious food, good quality and quantity! I will definitely be ordering again. Their chicken biryani was perfectly flavored, the chicken tandoori well seasoned and tender.
2021-02-26,4,4.5*'sMy boyfriend and I love Indian food, so we were thrilled to see a new restaurant of that type open nearby.   Empyrean Indian Kitchen was slightly different in that their fare was more Nepali, also offering momos (dumplings), chow mein, and other interesting items.  We loved that their menu was extensive, offering a breadth of traditional curries, biriyanis, and tandoori dishes as well.  Each option was available with many forms of protein, including tofu.  Since its recent opening, we have ordered delivery twice and takeout once, both of which were quick and timely.  The one time that I stopped in to pick up our food, I found the dining room relaxed, yet elegant, and I looked forward to a time when I would feel more comfortable eating there.Anyway, over the course of these few experiences, we tried a couple of dishes, but were thrilled with them and wound up repeating the majority of our order.  The Potato and Pea Samosas we had ordered seemed to actually include some kind of lamb, which might have been an error.  The inside was extremely flavorful, but the shell was a bit too fried for our liking.  The Tadka Dal was great, but VERY garlicky, which we liked, but might not appeal to other yellow lentil dish fans.  The Tofu Karahai contained steamed tofu, onion, and bell pepper, all cooked in a dry, tomato-based sauce, similar to a spice rub.  I loved that this was not a heavy broth, like with most Indian stews or curries.  Also, I would definitely suggest ordering this Mild or Medium, because the Spicy version was pretty intense.  The Garlic Tikka was a tandoori, white meat chicken dish.  The poultry chunks had been marinated in garlic, spices, and lemon juice, leaving the chicken extremely tender and flavorful; this was one of the best renditions of tandoori chicken I had ever had.  We were also thrilled that the accompanying basmati rice had been seasoned with Indian spices, leaving it a far cry from plain, boring grains.  We also tried a few types of naan, and all of the breads were flaky like croissants, but were not quite as stuffed as we would have liked.  For instance, the Peshwari Naan had a scarce amount of raisins, almonds, and coconut within its thin layers.  It still had a nice sweetness, but I wish there were more of each of the ingredients.  The Onion Kulcha was not much more filled with its chopped onions, but was delicious regardless!  The Garlic Naan was topped with a robust amount of fresh garlic, and the Chicken Naan was savory and flavorful.   Empyrean Indian Kitchen offered Indian fare that was fresh, well-seasoned, and robust, without feeling heavy or greasy.  It is a welcome addition to the Hoboken restaurant scene!
2021-02-25,1,Please could you guys just upload correct pictures on ubereats. The dish I ordered looks red gravy in the picture provided and came white. It was very much not expected the taste. Another dish I ordered was chicken chowmein which was the least I was expecting.
2021-02-23,5,Warm, cozy, clean interior. Best Indian spot in the area. Garlic naan and chicken tikka masala highly recommended. (Medium spice for those who enjoy spicy food.) Great experience all around.
2021-02-16,2,I went to this place last Friday, being new to Hoboken I was checking on yelp for good options . If you go by the ratings this is the most misleading place by far , usually after reading the reviews I make a good judgment of the restaurants. If you are a non vegetarian like I am this is not your place. We ordered chicken spicy momos , lamb seek kebab and goat rogan josh . The spicy chicken momo chutney was supposed to be spicy this was no where near to spicy and the momos did not feel like made fresh , I still did not want to make a judgement on this place knowing from the manager that the place is new and they have less staff , lamb seek kebab was ok and then my maincourse comes goat roganjosh .. I have serious questions to ask the chef , have you ever tried roganjosh ? , since when roganjosh started to have thick gravy with tomato puree ?? I am a conservative cook and eater How can a non vegetarian dish have tomato puree in its gravy ?? The sweet tangy taste that tomato leaves in every dish  cannot not be authentic Indian non vegetarian food. There are some places you still want to give a second chance to, but this place I am never ordering or going back. I have moved from NYC and some city's Indian restaurants have authentic Indian food to offer. In fact in this neighborhood I find Karma Cafe closer to Indian flavors. Being new to neighborhood my search for good restaurants is still on ..
2021-02-15,4,Checked out Yelp for new to - go places. Was skeptical in trying out a new place for a special occasion, but believe me, this.is.the.spot. I have never experienced such welcoming environment, the manger ; Jimmy was amazing.. he was so hands on with us and other guests, and he also bartended! He made us these awesome drinks that are a must try. My favorites are Mumbai mule, jaljeera margarita, bourbon sour, and many others on their special cocktail menus. The food, it was cooked well with abundance of flavor. You cannot find these flavors anywhere in Hoboken and jersey city. We ordered Kashmiri chicken, tadka dal, paneer kaju makhani, garlic naan, chicken momos, tawa paneer. Loved the portions, loved the flavors, and the total experience was just too good. Will and would recommend this to my friends and family and hope the person reading this review will go and try, you will not be disappointed.
2021-02-12,4,I enjoyed the food more than I expected - I'm a snob for going to Journal Square to get Indian food, and am generally skeptical of anything other than Italian food in Hoboken. But we were pleasantly surprised with our orders.The Indo-Chinese dishes were our favorites: crispy, tangy gobhi manchurian that paired well with the Hakka noodles. Saag paneer and daal were also well done.One star off because the bartender kept telling us about the drinks with his mask off. I prefer a policy that both customers and staff should wear masks when interacting.
2021-02-07,5,This is our new favorite india resturant in hoboken. Everything we ordered so far is very delicious and their customer service is simply amazing. Happy for this addition to hoboken!
2021-02-06,2,Simply put very average to bad Indian food. Ordered spicy chicken momo ( ordinary and left a weird taste in mouth), chili paneer ( terrible and doesn't like the dish in pic), saag Chole ( this was OK), tandoori rotis ( again disappointing). I don't know how can this be 5 star rated by others
2021-02-05,5,One of the best Indian spots in Hoboken/Jersey City. I love their cocktails. All of them are creative and unique. Mumbai Mule and Mojito are my favorite. I also like their sangria. Food is delicious too. All kababs are extremely flavorful and ground chicken momos are definitely a hit! For entree, Chicken curry and Chana masala are absolutely delicious. Oh and don't miss papdi chaat there. Lastly, combos of tea + fish pakodas, tea+ samosa are perfect for evening snack and remind me of small cafes in Mumbai
2021-02-03,4,I have ordered takeaway 3 different times in the last 3 weeks or so. The food is good and hits the right spice notes. I have ordered Chili Tawa Paneer 2x, Kadai Paneer (very good), and the Paneer kali Mitch (not good). The food quality and taste are specific to North India, with each dish having a different spice and taste, unlike other Indian restaurants in the area. However, the first two times I ordered, the food quality was better than my most recent experience, which was during Friday night rush. The food quality seemed like it was rushed and it was easily noticeable. I've enjoyed the food 2/3 times so will definitely order again especially since the taste and quality are far better than other options in Hoboken. Spicy or medium here is actually spicy so I would recommend mild if you're not into spice.
2021-02-01,5,Good food and great service!Lovely staff!Incredible flavor.
2021-02-01,5,I ordered their chicken biryani , one of the best I have eaten in a while. The quantity was perfect and it was delicious.  Would recommend ordering the chicken biryani and if you can eat spicy food , make sure you tell them to spice it up.
2021-01-31,4,I had started to like this restaurant until they delivered a completely unacceptable order. I ordered peas pulav and received this oily rice with loads of cashews. And no peas at all. And they missed packing raita in my delivery. So I was left with no option but eat white rice for dinner. Completely  disappointed! This place would have been my go-to if not for this experience.
2021-01-31,4,Have to start by saying the four star review is for the drinks and appetizers and because they're a brand new business with a lot of potential.We got the papdi chaat, fried chicken momo, and the chili tawa paneer. The papdi chaat and chicken momo were flavorful, good portions, and fresh. The paneer dish had four pieces of paneer and everything else was cauliflower and peppers. Regardless we thoroughly enjoyed the apps.We tried "THE ginger martini" (delicious and I appreciate that they make it with Bombay sapphire don't have to ask for an upgrade). My friend had the Mumbai mule and the spicy Mojito and she very much enjoyed them. The manager was very excited about the new drink menu and suggested a new drink that was not on it yet. It was a gringery drink with misunderstood whiskey. If you like sweet drinks the cocktails are for you. If you don't, make sure you ask to go light on the simple syrup or no simple syrup. Other than that for my second drink the drinks were on point. The boys tried two taj mahal for their second round and enjoyed them (they were excited that they had Indian beers). I really hope management is able to take constructive criticism. I have a few things to say that really turned the second half of our experience negative. First of all we made a 730 reservation and around 630pm we realized we're not going to make that. We tried call maybe a dozen times until we actually got there around 8pm and the phone line was busy the entire time. When we got there there were plenty of open tables so it was not a big deal at all. But if I was trying to make a reservation and no ones answering or the lines busy I would not even try. So for your sake please make sure the phone line is accessible. Then the service. We were asked about and ordered apps and drinks right away. We were enjoying ourselves so didn't think all that much of it but we weren't asked about dinner until after we were almost done with the apps and it was an hour after we sat down. We had our dinner order ready for a long time but we're just never asked. Then 5 minutes after putting our dinner order in (around 915) we were told that Hoboken is very strict about getting people out by 10pm so he just doesn't want us to think they're rushing us. Which is completely fine and understandable but please be better about taking peoples orders then. Especially when the restaurant is not even that full (although they did seem to be busy with take out orders). Now about the dinner. This is the first time I've eaten Indian food out in a very long time (my husband says in our almost 10 years together I've never taken him for Indian). There's a good reason for this. When you're Indian you have a certain expectation of spices. We ordered the chicken tikka Marsala, malai kofta, and the chicken madras curry. The portions were significantly smaller than apps (but we were pretty full by this point and didn't have much time so that was fine and it did easily feed four not too hungry adults with some left overs). The malai kofta was nothing like any malai kofta I've ever had it was spiced very differently and honestly it was bland. The chicken tikka Marsala was not spicy at all and seemed to be on the sweeter side. The madras curry was okay. The dinner food was just not anything to be excited about... it felt like it was purposely dressed down to appeal with non Indian people but I think people who enjoy Indian food are looking for authentic tasting food - like the apps!. We did meet the chef and he was a very nice guy. Lastly, the manager. He told us that he's only been on the job 2 weeks and you can tell from the second you walk in that he cares a lot. I know they're a new business still figuring things out. My  main complaint is the way he was talking to his staff and toward the end his sarcasm was also a little off putting. Maybe because we were sitting so close to the bar or because it was a stressful night but it was just unpleasant (talking down to staff is not going to motivate them to work harder for you and believe me customers don't like to see that). And please do better about keeping your mask on. The waitresses and bus people were great about it. The manager should be modeling this behavior. We were all vaccinated recently but I can imagine if this was a month ago I would have been uncomfortable at times. Outside of these few things I really think this could be a lasting business and a go to Indian food spot in Hoboken/JC which dont really have many sit down options. Will definitely order the apps take out and may be back for drinks and apps.
2021-01-30,5,Liked the food. The spice levels were mild and to my liking. The Stuffed Kulchas were filling. Also liked the food packaging in paper boxes. Overall a nice experience.
2021-01-24,5,Nepali style spiced food. Tawa chili paneer is amazing though there's less paneer in it than one expects. Chicken 65 is different but very tasty! The chowmein and Tikka masala are great too. Though I had to wait for my pick up order today (believe it was genuine system error), it was worth it for the hot and spicy food on a cold evening.
2021-01-21,5,This new Indian place has a lot to offer, food is delicious, lot of interesting options on the menu and they deliver food in bio-degradable packaging. Really loved their veg momos, seekh kebabs and chicken tikka masala. Definitely going to order again!
2021-01-18,5,Incredible! So flavorful and large portions! Delivery was fast and I appreciate that the bag was secured with a tamper-safe tape. A nice extra step in the middle of a pandemic
2021-01-17,5,Great ambience, Great food.Chili tawa paneer was surprisingly delicious unlike other restaurants, As well as chk momos & salmon tikka gravy. Jimmy is a lovely host and makes great drinks. The mumbai mule was good drink with a spicy twist. Will definitely try other interesting drink combinations in their menu. Definitely recommend this place.
2021-01-16,5,We heard of this new Indian restaurant in town across from PATH and tried it yesterday. The food was amazing!  Salmon tikka masala was flavorful and delicious, as was tender and juicy tandoori chicken. We also ordered tandoori vegetables (which I had never before seen on an Indian menu). What a treat - cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, onions and several juicy slices of paneer were wonderful, having steeped in the tandoor.  Even the raita was a step above what we have had before.  Moreover, the owner was so friendly and sweet!  We took out our meal but will definitely eat in the restaurant soon; they updated what was formerly a pizzeria into a beautiful space.  Happy to have another Indian restaurant in Hoboken, and a great one at that!
2021-01-16,5,Hands down the best Indian food in Hoboken and Jersey City area!!! We ordered pick-up and were amazed by quality and flavors of food. We came in a few days later to dine-in and were not disappointed. Very friendly staff, delicious food, generous portions. If you want great Indian food, you must absolutely try this place!
2021-01-14,4,Delighted that they have various types of momos, and all quite delicious. Hoboken has a multitude of Indian places, but this one stands out. Their packaging is environmentally friendly and they use bamboo cutlery, prices are comparable and food is great
2021-01-08,5,Tried this newly opened Indian Resturant at Hoboken  right opposite to the Hoboken terminal and the food was amazing, I tried the chicken momo which was perfectly steamed and the chicken was very flavorful came with a tomato based sauce which was amazing too. It was perfect for this cold weather. Will be definitely going back to try other dishes too.
2021-01-07,5,A lot of variety,great flavors, Huge portions Good place for some special occasions. Will order again!
2021-01-03,4,Was curious to try out this new Hoboken spot (with a rather unusual name?) and ordered a couple of appetizers - veg pakoras and chicken momos in a spicy sauce. The pakoras had gone soggy when I received my food delivery and I found them a tad bit salty, but the momos were on point! They were steamed well, the chicken filling was generous and tasty, and the sauce/gravy was delicious too, kind of like a chili chicken gravy. Would like to try out some of their other food.
2020-12-24,5,An outstanding new spot - chilli tawa paneer has a killer spice level and an impressive diversity of flavors and textures. The chat was great also; I opted for the aloo tikki version. Pro tip: the tamarind sauce from the chat can cool off the chilli heat.
