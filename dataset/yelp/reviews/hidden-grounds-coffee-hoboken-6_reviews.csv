2021-10-30,5,This place is heaven for Chai lovers :-)! Great breakfast and friendly staff. A must stop place when you are in Hoboken.
2021-10-06,5,One of the best pumpkin chai lattes! I love how many chai flavors they have. Will definitely be back to try the donuts which also looked amazing. Glad to support a women owned business. The interior decor was very photogenic as well.
2021-09-18,4,Great place for breakfast and coffee!Offers traditional as well as some more innovative food/drink options.The lavender cold brew is an interesting one - I've tried lavender ice cream before and didn't care for it, but surprisingly lavender and coffee worked out pretty well. The hint of lavender floral scent complemented the coffee flavor.The sandwiches are pretty standard.The pesto sauce on sourdough was pungent (in a good way) along with the onion - so don't get this if you plan to kiss anyone during the day lol. The sourdough texture was bit tougher than I would like though.

2021-07-27,4,My family and I tried this place out together recently and fell in love! It has such a cute and trendy vibe inside, there's greenery on the wall and light up letters. There's probably enough room to set like 20 - 30 people I'd say, which is surprising because it looks pretty small from the outside. They sell locally made art and goodies like cards, coasters, chai bags, coffees, planners etc. This place used to be called Simply Chai, and they have kept some of the items from their menu, but I do not believe they have them all or maybe they just ran out on the day that I went. I've heard the rose chai is really good - I didn't get it this time - but I will be back to try. They've got picnic tables inside to match the greenery and limited out door seating as well - 4 tables to be exact. It's the perfect place to meet someone, grab a bite or a coffee too. We ended up sitting for like 2 hours lol and no one said anything to us or bothered us. Lots of people were coming in and out with their dogs, sitting inside with them as well! As a dog owner, I really love that about this place and will be sure to bring our dog next time. The service was also super nice! They gave recommendations on what to order, tell you whats popular and what you may like based on how sweet you like your coffee. They take a few minutes to make your drink but they make it perfectly! It's like 4 to 5 dollars for a coffee, which I think is pretty standard in this area, but it's WAY bigger than your average starbucks coffee. I got the new orleans cold brew which was on the sweeter end (I like my coffee semi-sweet) without being TOO sweet. If you like your coffee bitter then I wouldn't choose this. I loved it, however! I'd be back just to get this again. It was milky without being too heavy and gave you the perfect amount of caffeine to start your morning. My aunt got the traditional cold brew, which she enjoyed -- there was not much special to it but of course it's a little more customizable (can add your own sugar, creamer etc.) and my boyfriend got the sweet caramel which I think was the sweetest of all the drinks that we ordered -- too sweet for me. OH, the bags of masala chai that they sell. OH MY goodness. Amazing. Grab one on your way out if you've never tried it! Or if you love chai. I also got a bagel with cream cheese here which was only OK. Kind of a disappointment for a Jersey bagel. It was just flat and not as dense and delicious as I was craving. My advice would be to get something else. But, I will definitely be back! 10/10 recommend trying.
2021-07-02,5,My first time here and the owners made me feel welcomed. Plus their black coffee beats out Dunkin and Starbucks! So um....yea...get over here and get your coffee life together!
2021-06-25,5,All these years later and I am still loving this spot! Up until recently, I never sampled too much of their food, just coffees really. BUT that was silly, because I got a few pastries and an incredible smoked salmon sandwich and I am already daydreaming about another lunch here. The smoked salmon sandwich was hefty. I am talking LOTS of  salmon, avocado, cream cheese, fresh basil and tomatoes and it was on really delicious grilled sourdough bread. I loveddddd it. And it came with a bag of potato chips that I didn't know how much I wanted. Because I was feeling peckish I also took home a few pastries that were staring at me from case. A little heart shaped rose lemon donut and a spinach pie. The rose lemon donut stole the show. So dense and sweet and perfect with my coffee the next day. The spinach pastry was tasty but nothing compared to everything else I tried from Hidden Grounds. Along with all of this delicious food, I also got an iced tea. It wasn't my favorite, it may have been some sort of hibiscus tea that I just wasn't feeling, but still, it was refreshing on a hot day. Other wonderful things about this shop: They are dog friendly There is plenty of space They sell little plants and other chotchkies up front There is indoor and outdoor seating Great coffees
2021-06-08,5,eduarea at the register was super sweet in helping me decide what to order and her recommendations were great!! she really knows her products. i got the bacon egg and cheese on an everything bagel and i got their sweet caramel cold brew coffee (iced) with almond milk and it was overall amazing!!! she put honey and siracha on the side for me to try it with the bagel since i was pretty unsure how i'd like it but it was good! they also have free wifi and the environment is pretty and chill, it's not too loud either so it's a great place to get some work done too. will def be returning for that and the great customer service :))
2021-05-27,5,Ordered a latte, it was bold and smooth. Made perfectly. Their donuts are adorable and really bring me back to Jackson heights with one bite. wish i lived in the neighborhood, i would be in there everyday. Def try the lemon rose donut
2021-05-20,1,Will not order from this place again as they don't fulfill your order to your specification.I ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese on a croissant and added avocado. Received it with everything except the bacon. I called in and also offered to send in the photo of their inability to do their jobs effectively. The woman who answered the phone told me to contact Ubereats, who sent me back a message that they've noted my complaint and I don't need to contact them again.In short, if you want to have a messed up order and have no responsibility taken by this place, order here.
2021-04-30,5,SuÃÅper cute. Friendly staff. Very clean. The closest thing to authentic chai as in made in a pot on the stove, stirred, strained then whisked. Donut was cute and yummy. Reminded me of a Madeline cookie. Definitely recommend.
2021-04-28,2,Love the other location in Hoboken and jersey city but unfortunately this location falls short. It actually really makes me really sad to write this one! Walked in and was about to ask a question when the phone rang and was asked if I could wait as they take the phone order first (it was fine, no worries). After that failed order it was my turn. I asked if the taro had caffeine (she said no). I decided to try that with oat milk and use my coupon/voucher. She said she didn't know how to do that and she would call the manager. I asked if this would take long, as I was double parked and in a bit of a rush so if it did no problem, I'd come back. She said I should pay now and if anything she will give me back the money in cash I was owed for the voucher. She calls the manager, makes my drink and says now she cannot do that and I can use it another time. Well, I came out of my way to get this and it expires soon... so I cannot. This is not what you told me 30seconds ago.. as I was in a rush I just left. I looked up if taro is caffeine free after this (not trusting what I was told), and it is not. I cannot even enjoy the $6 beverage I have purchased. I will not return to this location.Although she was friendly enough, please do not give your customer's false information.
2021-03-29,4,I've been wanting to try this place for a while, I just don't go to Hoboken much, not a big fan honestly but I guess good places are located here or the city.  It sucks that COVID has ruined the indoor experience, it's not the same but the service was great.  We've been wanting to try their Indian flavored doughnuts and rose chais and I'm so happy we did.  The rose chai was delicious, my friend ordered a ginger cardamom chai and it tasted so good.  They took their time to prepare, which was pretty legit and they heated up out doughnuts which was a nice touch.  The ladies gave us a free doughnut because one of the doughnuts we've ordered was the wrong one, and since there were about to close, they decided to treat us with one.  So nice!  I ate them all by the way lol.
2021-03-22,4,I came across this place a while back on Instagram and it caught my eye immediately. It also used to be called Simply Chai, so it looks like they went through a name change too.It was 8pm on a Sunday and I was in the area. I knew their donuts weren't going to be the freshest, but I figured I'd stop by since I was in the area.I got 3 donuts: Gulab Jamun Donut (~$4), Rose Lemon Donut (~$4), and Ras Malai Donut (~$4). They are definitely on the pricier end for a donut but that is to be expected when they are this unique.The Gulab Jamun Donut is what you would expect if you've had gulab jamun. You really get the essence of cardamom and saffron. The Ras Malai Donut definitely felt heavier probably due to the butter and fresh cream used and is also topped with pistachios and almonds. The Rose Lemon Donut is a Rooh Afza based donut which gives it that rose flavor. It's also topped with pistachios.My main complaint was that the donuts were cold. I took a bite of each and knew I wasn't going to enjoy it like this. I took it home and microwaved it which enhanced the taste a lot! The donuts were also not super soft like you would expect a donut to be. It has more of a cake consistency, but is just in the shape of a donut.Overall, if you enjoy Indian desserts then these donuts will be right up your ally. Personally, it was a one time thing for me. I was a bit disappointed that they weren't fresh and reminded me more of a cake than a donut. Aside from that, it was a good try!
2021-03-14,5,I've been wanting to try this spot out for awhile. I'm so glad I did! My experience was at the Hoboken location. I ordered Indian filter coffee and the Mediterranean grilled cheese. It was so delicious as spicy Mayo added a great kick and unique twist to the grilled cheese. I only wish the cheese was a bit more melted. The sandwich came with a side of chips which was a plus for me. To go, I took one of each donut: Rose Lemon, Gulab Jamun and Rasmalia. Wow, these donuts are so unique as they incorporate the flavorful taste of traditional Indian Cuisine. My favorite from the three is the Rose Lemon. Service was exceptional as well as everyone had a friendly attitude.
2021-02-06,3,Really sad to even write this review because I loveee hidden grounds and have been getting their bagels/coffees/pastries for a while...but my salmon bagel sandwich was so disappointing this morning. Was looking forward to a yummy bagel sandwich for the weekend and instead I was met with this - Thinnest amount of cream cheese and only on 1 side of the sandwich? Could barely taste the cream cheese while eating. Also salmon was a measly thin slice. Maybe I should've looked at other photos of this item on their menu? The amount of cream cheese and salmon is kinda laughable honestly. Please add more of your ingredients into your sandwiches. Nonetheless coffees and pastries are always delicious.
2021-02-04,4,I came here back in October when they were still 'Simply Chai.' The donuts just looked soooo good in the photos I had to travel over an hour to get my fix! Gulab jamun, Ras Malai, and so many more Indian inspired donuts. Those were excellent. However the Bombay sandwich was out of this world!! I would travel for that again! I found the rose latte to be overly sweet and not as photo worthy. The sandwich took extremely long to get... maybe close to 40 minutes even though it didn't seem that busy. That was a bit annoying since it was a cold day and we had been waiting outside for a long time. The interior is beautifully decorated and cozy. Come for the donuts and sandwich, skip the lattes.
2021-02-02,5,THEY HAVE THE BEST WHITE CHOCOLATE drink that i've had. super welcoming and fast. their very on top with there ig game which is so cool. i've seen this in many restaurants and coffee shops but they have a book that is open for their customers to write in. it's a way to be vulnerable to strangers you'll never meet! i love when i see this so much
2021-01-18,5,If your looking for amazing coffee options with bagel and toast options this is the spot! There safety prosecutors hit the regulations. They have no indoor dining at the moment, sadly due to covid. Other then that It's a beautiful location with there cozy decorations. (I do recommend to have more coffee related decorations...)They do provide chairs and tables outside. There staff are on top of all order and have control during rushes which is typically not common in cafes. There female barista made my husband and I feel welcomed and safe to ask question and customize our order. After me spilling my latte all over she was nice and made me a new one and cleaned the place us and insured I was okay. Such amazing costumer service. There house coffee - rosebud is amazing such bright flavor!I'm obsessed with there honey bee latte if your looking for a nice sweetened spice taste. There lavender honey is lovely if your looking for a sweet blend latte. In terms of food I do enjoy that fact that it not frozen food. They make it on the spot! I enjoyed having the option of plain, everything or sesame seed bagel... or kaiser roll. Such amazing options! I prefer to wait 2 more min to get my bagel and knowing it was made fresh and on the spot then getting any fast food where it isn't good for your body and I don't know where it came from.
2021-01-10,2,This is quite a conflicting review that I have to post. We loved simply chai for its sandwiches and the amazing falooda and chai. However, they have recently changed their menu and it is a disappointment. I cannot speak about the chai and other drinks since they might be the same. The business owners should not fix what is not broken. Their previous menu was good, it was really good. What we received today seems like a shoddy version of a makeshift sandwich with nothing in the filling and store bought chutney and sauce. The place had potential but today it was quite disappointing.To highlight some of their previous good dishes were the falooda which was amazing and the sandwiches. Alas, it was not the same recently.
2021-01-05,4,It's amazing that they're open during COVID. The ambiance is pretty chill and has a very homey atmosphere.I was initially very skeptical about gulab jamun and ras malai donuts like how do they even go together?! Absolutely loved the fusion. Very moist and cake-y donuts. They didn't feel very sweet either. The Bundt cakes were very cute as well. Though I wasn't a huge fan of the ras malai.The tea was freshly made, but I'd get the magic masala over the others (ginger tea and cardamom tea) we tried.
2021-01-02,4,This place has great service and really good food. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because they recently switched from a sourdough bread to naan bread for their sandwiches - which isn't the best medium for the type of sandwiches offered. I wish they would provide the option to choose the type of bread.
2021-01-02,1,I had originally given this place 4 stars. Revising it to 1. Place is completely fallen off. They had major quality issues when they served waffles. Now it's worse - the staff can't get the right on what goes on which order. The Avacados added to the wrong sandwich, boxes mislabeled and when I called to complain, the excuse was they are so sorry because they are busy. I'd buy that and am all for supporting establishments in these hard times but this is literally the 4th time there is some sort of an issue and I was the only one there to pick up an order so not sure it's a volume issue. Sometimes you just have to be honest and wait for the next great establishment to open shop.
2020-12-20,5,Amazing donuts! I keep coming back for more. Looking forward to all the amazing new food items they will bring! I don't understand all you one and two star reviewers.
2020-12-13,5,OMGGGG where to begin!!??! This is absolutely amazing!! So flavorful.. had the magic masala chai tea with a ras malay & gulab jamun donuts!! Yumm yumm yumm definitely worth a try!
2020-12-13,3,I came in the afternoon so there were limited options to chose from. Novel idea and flavors but things were a little to dry for me. Parkinf is street parking and was easy to find.
2020-12-13,5,Let me tell you, Simply Chai - Hoboken was epic. Simply Chai - Hoboken rocks in every way. A dish that was prepared to perfection was Burning Man Dosa. Absolutely amazing dish. I really liked it. Service was excellent and everybody working here was really nice and generous. We will be back ASAP.
2020-12-08,5,This is possibly my favorite tea place to hit.There is something incredibly unique about the spicy embrace of their teas.Pick whatever teas you want an enjoy. Heck, we practically order a flight of them.We always buy a bag masala chai and make it last. It's delicious.
2020-12-07,5,I'm kinda speechless on how amazing this place is. They support local artists, they make some of the best chai I have ever had, and the desserts were kinda mind-blowing. I am recommending this place to everyone!
2020-12-05,5,I came to this spot a while ago when they first opened and then again recently. I never realized how good well made chai could me until coming here. This place levels up so people know that the chia at dunkin and Starbucks is not it! They have a variety of different types of chai teas and alternative milk options as well. I recently had the ginger chai and it was the perfect blend of almond milk, black tea and ginger. It was what I needed on a cold rainy night. I'll definitely be back to try other ones. They also have sandwiches that I would love to try when I return. I've been a fan of Hidden Grounds in New Brunswick since my Rutgers days so I was sure simply chai would live up to the expectations.
2020-12-01,5,One of the most aesthetic cafe locations in Hoboken. I'm a big fan of this cafe in New Brunswick, but this location is beautiful. The various ornaments and decorations around the shop add artistic principles that are visually appealing.  If you have not checked this cafe out, please come here as soon as possible. Some of my favorite items from the menu are:1. Rose Chai (Chai, milk, rose petals, and rose syrup)2. Gulab Jamun Donuts (Gulab Jamun is an Indian sweet)3. Rose Pistachio Cupcakes (moist cake topped light, creamy frosty)4. Signature Falooda (Falooda is an Indian dessert loaded with milk, basil seeds, vermicelli noodles, ice cream, and a handful of pistachios)A must-try cafe with unique fusion foods. Don't forget to take a picture inside!
2020-11-23,3,I really really really wanted to like this place but it just did not meet my expectations. Maybe it was just an off day but their masala chai was wayyy too ginger-forward and lacked the flavor profile of the masala chai I'm used to. I definitely will be visiting again to try their other drinks though to give it more of a fair chance.
2020-11-22,5,Delicious chai, highly recommend the rose masala chai (I got with almond milk). They have 4 little tables outside, and very friendly service :) will be back
2020-11-16,5,Sometimes I'm smart enough to order the item that's in the title of the restaurant. This is not a place for Diet Coke. The magic masala chai was great. But I know you don't read my reviews for the beverages, so I got the spicy grilled cheese sandwich. I was so intrigued by this excellent sandwich that I wound up reading about Amul cheese in Bon Appetit and Wikipedia. I'm running out of synonyms for spicy; I probably used "incendiary" earlier this week so maybe I'll just re-use the same ones but in a Guy Fieri voice. More to the point, the green chilli and garlic chutney make this an instant classic.
2020-11-10,5,This is one of my favorite places in Hoboken. I have only gotten delivery but I am sure it is even more amazing in person. The samosa grilled cheese is out of this world, actually all their sandwiches are great. I love the attention to detail, you can tell they really care about their business.
2020-11-07,5,Due to COVID-19, I'm only able to review my experience with the order and pick up- wish I was able to sit inside and experience a nice 'dine in' cafe feel! I ordered the Through Yelp and it was super easy and convenient- located in the heart of Hoboken by the path, it offered outdoor seating on their busy street. From my quick visit, the place was very cute offering products in the middle of the store. They were probably the most organized location for Grubhub pick ups. The tables on the left had stations set up for Grubhub ordered and they were packed very neat. The two chais and donuts were available for me just in time and the donuts were super fresh. I LOVE me a good chai tea latte and their rose chai did NOT disappoint! It literally tasted like flowers and the sweetness was just perfect without an overwhelming taste of syrup. My husband ordered the lavender chai and that was just as good. I wish this place was closer to me- I'd spend all my money on their chais on the daily. I'm glad I was able to come here on a rare hot november Saturday. Parking is a bitch but if you've ever been to Hoboken, you already knew that. Will definitely be coming back here to try their hot chai's!
2020-11-02,4,So having tried simply chai a couple of more times after my disastrous first time, i can safely say that their Bombay Sandwich is delicious. Havent had anything other than their Bbay sandwich and masala omlette w avacado. Both pretty good. Bbay sandwich being my fav.
2020-10-24,2,Food was ok but the service was not. I went during Covid so they had only outdoor seating. There was only one table available but it didn't  have any chairs. The other tables were occupied. I ordered food and asked the barista if she could get me a chair. I had my daughter with me in a stroller. She said I can take one of the chairs from inside and I have to bring it back when I'm done. I'm not sure if she expected me to do all that with a baby in a stroller which she clearly saw. Am I supposed to just leave her alone while I'm lugging a chair in and out? I just stood outside until the food came and left as soon as possible. Not coming back if this is the attitude they have.
2020-10-22,4,Amazing to find a place fully dedicated to Chai including Chai donuts and with open door siting. This is true chai no joke.
2020-10-14,5,Amazing!! Highly recommend this place - i wish they made bigger sizes. I love their rose chai lattes! Super delicious and the donuts are all amazing.
2020-10-11,1,Simply Chai was OK. food prepared seemed like a series of short cuts. For example you add garam masala and pickle masala with cheese and that's your spicy grilled cheese on sour dough. You add rose flavor syrup to prepackaged chai and it becomes rose chai It is a quick fix menu, mildly creative but not healthy, it is tasty at first, but due to the packaged flavors (masala and syrups) is very acidic. Not sure if a wide range of audience would like that. I understand fusion, but I would give them an C plus for creativity, but we will not return hereThis is a poor effort in creating fusion, a little morehard work in prep, more originality and use of fresh ingredients will surely make a difference if the establishment desires to have a long term tenure
2020-10-07,5,The place is a good spot for someone missing desi chai. We ordered the Chicken Sandwich, Bombay Sandwich, Chai, and Filter Coffee. All of them were really good and would love to visit again
2020-10-03,5,First time I came here they gave me two extra pastries along with the two I ordered. Staff is always pleasant and they are super caution with COVID safety procedures. I've tried most of their donuts and cupcakes (donuts are out of this world) and I am always craving for more. I signed up to collect stars so that I can eventually get something back. I want to try the drinks there. Will update when time comes but I do not think it will disappoint :)
2020-10-02,4,Located just steps away from the Hoboken Terminal, this cafe serves several versions of chai, including, but not limited to, masala, cardamom, ginger, rose, and saffron. I've tried to make my own masala chai thanks to a recent Yelp zoominar but it just doesn't compare to the richer, deeper version here, which I enjoyed on their outdoor patio that's great for people-watching.They also have a surprisingly large menu of inexpensive small to mid-sized bites, whether samosas, sandwiches, lassis, snow cones, baked goods, or even jalapeno poppers. Something for everyone - but often with an Indian twist.Service was studious and personal too. A welcome independent alternative to, say, big-chain cafes.
2020-09-30,5,The chai is so good! We had ginger (masala) and rose with steamed oat milk and they were pretty much to die for. Also got 3 donuts but none of them are, honestly, out of this world, unless you're just a fan of cake donuts in general.
2020-09-26,3,Came in by chance. We ordered a Bombay sandwich, spicy egg sandwich, chicken tikka sandwich, ras malai donut, gulab jaman donut, rose cupcake, mango cupcake and samosas. Food was subpar. Nothing was spicy. Donuts had the same pound cake base. Masala chai was served boiling hot. Rose latte was not hot. Won't be returning
2020-09-24,5,Wow, this place is just amazing!!!' An amazing blend of Indian fusion. We wanted a quill like bite and we saw this on Yelp and had to try it. This is everything I always wanted!!! Their assortment of chai flavors is amazing!!! We decided to go with the rose chai latte and omg it was amazing!!!! The sugar content was perfect -- not too sweet at all. On a warm day outside, the coldness from the rose hit the spot! On Yelp, we saw the sandwiches and one of my favorite sandwiches growing up was a Bombay sandwich that my mom and nannie would make me. On Yelp, they did a twist and had dosa waffle bread which we were looking forward to. Unfortunately, they don't have that anymore and have sourdough bread instead. Still amazing!!! Brought me back childhood memories. Can't wait to come back to this place again!!! Will definitely be a staple to stop by at when I'm in the hoboken area.Oh also the Donuts!!!! Omg amazing flavors and such a genius idea. We tried the gulab jamun one and it was perfection. Perfect moist donut that actually tasted like a gulab jamun without the drench of sugar syrup. The sweetness was perfect. Also, many other flavors available, it was hard to pick one.
2020-09-19,5,I love all the chais, the traditional and flavored ones and the food is creative and so good!
2020-09-18,5,The service was amazing & the drinks were fantastic! I really loved the gulab jamun donut and I look forward to visiting again.
2020-09-15,5,Love simply chai. They have the best iced & hot lattes. My fav is the rose chai latte! They also have an assortment of dairy free milks which is great for me. I've never tried any of their food, but it all looks good! I also felt very safe going in and ordering during Covid. They seem to be taking the proper precautions and the employee is always wearing a mask and gloves. This place is a staple for me:)
2020-09-14,2,Subpar taste which is a bummer because I live close by and would've loved some of the ideas if they weren't mediocre. The drink is okay but the lack of interest by the barista was what did it. Came here on a date, wouldn't recommend it at all
2020-09-13,5,Awesome menu! Indian quick-eat favorites, and very creative sandwiches. We tried the Spicy Grilled Cheese, The Bombay, and the Avocado, which were all excellent. The faloodas and desserts are also great. Good service and ambience. Will definitely order again.
2020-09-13,5,The food and drinks were made fresh to order. The samosas were to die for, simply delicious. Chai tea's were delectable. The staff was super friendly and courteous. Will definitely go back.
2020-09-11,5,Went in to grab a drink late one Sunday afternoon. There was no crowd so we were able to walk right in and order. We got a hot saffron chai latte to-go. They did have outdoor seating available but we decided to stroll the nearby waterfront instead. The saffron and chai flavors worked really well together. They offer some very interesting tea combinations. Seems like they have a really creative brunch menu too. I would definitely like to try more of their items next time I'm in the area.
2020-09-07,5,This was place is actually amazing. The Masala egg sandwich is incredible and is actually spicy. The saffron chai is delicious. If you are looking for a unique breakfast / brunch option I would definitely recommend giving this place a try!
2020-08-30,1,To the Owner- Please teach some basic customer service to the person who is taking the order. I walked in to your place at 2:30PM- Aug 30th. The person taking the order said I may order the food through her or through the tablet. So we decided to order the food through the tablet. In the middle of the ordering process, the tablet timed out and deleted our cart before placing the order. So we walked up to her to place the order through her but she refused to take our order claiming that she was busy. When I went back to the tablet there was already someone placing the order and they took almost 10 mins to complete their order. When I asked her to bump our order because we were there before she refused and gave us a irresponsible reply to us. She simply said sorry with a horrible attitude but refuse to take out order. This place is really slow and if you are short of staff, hire an extra person. I saw 2 people walked out without placing the order  because this place is order. Please teach some basic customer service to your employees and tell them to apologize when they mean it or have a solution. You lost my business!
2020-08-29,5,Masala chai and the Bombay sandwiches are unbelievable!! Prefer this location vs hidden grounds - I think they are affiliated. Try the parle g cookies too Chai with oat milk is my favorite Hope they cos Ofer making the falloff dairy free too
2020-07-25,4,Great stuff but the chai were very expensive for the size and portion.Their food however, is a great deal and hence we are balancing out to a solid four stars.  Got their avocado toast with egg and masala sauce, OMG so good.  Big and soft piece of toast pulled
2020-07-25,5,Simply delicious!!! Must Try gulab jamun donuts, all the cupcakes and faloodas. I ordered from grubhub. Food was properly packed and fresh.
2020-07-25,4,I found this place via Instagram and ever since I made it a mission to make a trip out to jersey to check it out ! I love chai, and Indian desserts in the form of cupcakes and donuts, sign me up ! I ended up ordering the Rasmalai cupcake , gulab jamun donut, masala chai donut and the lemon poppy donut which is vegan and gluten free.We also ordered the chai flight, and the chai iced latte.The desserts were interesting, the Rasmalai cupcake was  good, it was light and easy to eat.The gulab jamun donut was interesting, my friend said he it tasted like a gulab jamun, but I thought it was a bit dry and I couldn't really taste it.The masala chai was great! It was moist and had a great flavor profile ! The lemon poppy was sadly a disappointment , it was super dry and hard. But the lemon poppy flavor was there!Lastly the drinks! The chai latte with oat milk was great, flavorful and light. You can't go with chai latte! We ended up getting the chai flight as well, which consisted of cardamom chai, ginger chai, and masala chai. I love chai, but all 3 of these had the same taste and smell. Which was a but disappointing.The service was great! They also have outdoor seating!
2020-07-25,5,I have been here atleast 7 times so far, hands down one of my favorite brunch spots. Their chais are always spot on- saffron and ginger are my personal favorite. Their waffle dosas are amazing as well, love the millennial ( has avocados, feta cheese, and perfect combination of honey and sriracha) and Bombay Dreams. The burning man and woman are a little too garlicky for me. Their Signature Falooda is very good as well, only downside is that you have to wait Atleast 5 minutes for the ice to melt a little into the steamed milk before drinking it. Their cafe is super cute with umbrella decor, and very well maintained.They are open for takeout and delivery right now- would highly recommend trying this place!
2020-07-24,1,Horrible service looong wait and still got wrong order. When reported to the cashier , she started arguing and said that she cant fix and had to call the managerDrinks were good but food items were horribleWorst service ever!
2020-07-22,4,Tried Bindaas Grilled with Avacodo... Unique concept..Had a good taste..  But lacked proteins or fillings for the price of it...
2020-07-21,3,Love the flavor ideas...it just isn't executed that well.Cadbury chocolate chai latte- decent. Subtle hint of chocolate, but more chai flavor. I personally was expecting a better mix. Rose Falooda- Falooda is usually syrup/ice cream/ milk/ basil seeds. This one personally was too much basil seeds and cream, less rose syrup...especially when I got the rose flavored one.Rose cupcake- yummy! def has all the rose flavor I expected and subtle pistachio flakes on top.Rasmalai cupcake- okay. kind of taste like rasmalai but also something else.The decor and seating space is super cute. Couldn't enjoy it this time due to Covid-19 but its definitely a cute coffee shop feel.Great location, right off the Hudson and PATH stops.Return? Maybe I'll give it one more try if I'm passing by. Recommend? Not sure actually. If you're in the area already and want a light snack/coffee.
2020-07-20,3,The main reason this is a 3 and not a 4 or 5 is because of consistency of food. Never had an issue with drinks, but depending on who is behind the counter the dosa's are different. I've been 6 or more times and always order the same thing, the Millennial. 2 times it's been amazing, the other four brunt or under-done, today it had avocado that was brown -- I didn't say anything to the waitress because she was swamped and seemed a bit overwhelmed. It's disappointing because I love the food concept and everything else, but it's not the cheapest meal. Also, pet peeve when places charge for condiments, I get food and labor, but why not at least include green chutney? Seems like penny pinching in the wrong places, where you could charge a bit more for waffles.
2020-07-17,5,COVID19 Status- open for outdoor seating but I would highly recommend ordering in advance if you can through Yelp.This place is worth it for me to drive to NJ from the city. The gulab jamun donut is the best thing ever! I loved and enjoyed every bite of it. The next best thing was the Ras Malai cupcake- just delicious and not too overly sweet. The Gajar Halwa cake was good too.I also tried the Masala Mac n Cheese- it was rgood but might be spicy for those who don't like too much spice. Imagine Kurkure masala on top of Mac n Cheese, that's how it tasted. We also got the Bombay Dream Dosa waffle sandwich and loved that as well.I am definitely going back to try the chai flight and Falooda!
2020-07-14,5,Love this place!! Their chais drinks and desserts are delicious! Friendly staffs and trendy decor.
2020-07-13,1,Terrible service and the portions are not worth the prices. Do not waste your money! The waffle was tasty but the rest was gross.
2020-07-12,4,Ordered delivery theought ubereats. Rasmalai cupcake ( priced 4$) had a packaging issue but was edible. Its good in flavours. My only complaint is I wish it was cooled down in fridge or something as the frosting was all over the place given the hot weather.Rose falooda (6$) is a winner. Its adequately sweet but very little icecream I felt.This place seems to have potential, so might try it again.
2020-07-12,5,What a treat! The cutest store in Hoboken. I can't wait until we can eat inside again. Rose falooda Was so freaking on a bite day. Gulab jamun donut was delicious and Amma favorite was the perfect brunch item. Dosa shaped in a waffle with Amul cheese. It was delightful. Can't wait to try thing on the menu
2020-07-09,4,Great drinks and food. The ambience was great. Great service. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a twist on your regular shmegular chai.
2020-06-24,4,This place has been on my list for a while because of its gorgeous chai hot lattes & treats, luckily it's open during covid. At my visit, no outdoor seating avail but a few days later they opened it up! Upon entering, the space is colorful with beautiful pillows & upside down hanging umbrellas that I'd love to have. At the end is living green wall and antagonizing cute cafe seating space to chill & hang. I stared at the menu for a while, unsure of what to order due to difficult choices! Since it was a hot day, rather than their special hot chai's I ordered my first ever pistachio FALOODA which has vermicelli noods with interestingly basil seeds that kinda tasted like mini bobas and ice cream! A gorgeous drink with a spoon straw to help you get every drop & speckle.For food, I got the Bombay Dreams dosa waffle with cheese, onions, cucu, tomatoes... fresh date & mint chutney with Parle G biscuits! So creative & colorful, I sprinkled what appeared to be honey roasted nuts & the textures were fanciful! I wished the waffle was toasty, but perhaps having it packed with time during transport until being opened lost it's crisp. I had to end with 2 desserts: the gulab jamun & masala chai donuts! They had their each own fragrant flavor, a bit on the dry side however exotic donuts you can't find elsewhere! I enjoyed my visit & would love to dine outside to try new things here!
2020-06-17,5,This is such a perfect place for almost any get-together! I've been here for a calligraphy workshop back around Valentine's Day and had so much fun! The ambiance is beautiful. I recently went there last week when they had launched their falooda's and it was so delicious. Amazing concept, and love the diversity! Happy to call it one of my favorite spots in Hoboken!
2020-06-13,5,Super cool vibe and very positive staff! Ooh also greaat coffee!!!! Highly recommended
2020-06-09,5,Such a cute little place! I ordered a lavender chai latte and it did not disappoint. It was fluffy, light and not overly sweet-perfect for the summer time. Also, the decor is amazing inside and out-very colorful and charming Indian vibes! Would definitely return to try more off the menu!
2020-05-22,5,I needed an afternoon pick me up to make it to the end of the work day and Simply Chai was the right call! The online ordering process through Yelp was super simple. You can watch your order each step of the way. I ordered my first Iced Chai Latte of the summer! It's a great balance of milk and chai. The menu has a ton of different options for milk and chais. Since this was my first visit I started with my go-to order. The pick up process is also simple and safe. The door is open to walk right in. You'll see tables designated for order pick up where you can wait for your order to come out. My chai was ready as soon as I walked in. The server brought it to me and I was back outside in less than a minute. I live a few blocks away and know this is going to be my go to spot for my iced chai fix this summer!
2020-05-15,4,I wasn't expecting much coming here because chai places seem to have become pretty over saturated, but this place was actually really good. It was definitely really unique, unlike other chai places. Their best food item is definitely the dosa waffles. The bread is a mixture between a dosa, and a waffle and the filling has all types of veggies, cheeses, and spices. It was really delicious. The chai however was very average, and had nothing special about it. Overall, the ambiance was awesome. Every detail of this place was definitely well thought out. There are beautiful and traditional umbrellas and other decor hanging from the ceiling, but it also has a modern twist with its light up sign. It is a good mix of traditional and modern, and this place definitely has its own style.
2020-03-10,4,Tastefully decorate chai-focused cafe pretty close to Hoboken Path station. They also serve coffee and all kind of espresso drinks. We went on a Sunday morning for brunch and ordered chai flight (include cardamom tea, ginger tea and masala tea server with little cookies) - loved the cardamom and ginger tea  , masala tea was ok. We also ordered savory Dosa waffle( waffle made of rice flour batter) to eat and really liked it. its a must visit place if you live around.
2020-02-29,5,I absolutely love this place. Chia is spectacular many different milk options and dosas are oh so yummy! The ambiance and great customer service makes me never want to leave!!  Thank you definitely a regular!
2020-02-19,5,Went with a bunch of people so got to try every chai on the list that I'd want to. I had the saffron chai & it was perfect. Not too sweet, unique, and flavorful. The rose chai was good, but its not like a rose latte, its basically rose milk tea with the rose syrup. The cardamom tea also hit the spot. I had the Bombay dreams and loved it. I love dosas as it is and making it into a waffle with a Bombay sandwich inside is genius. Straight noms. Also tried a bite of the millennial and it was amazing. Avocado and Sriracha are perfect together.My husband got the spicy bagel egg and cheese & it's good. The flavor is really from the onions inside. The ambiance is nice, very brunch like and vibrant. Has indian umbrella decor, a photo green wall, and florals. Loved this place & will definitely be back!
2020-02-12,4,Nice spot to try has good selection of chai and apps.Tastes are ok I guess not great but still good!
2020-02-08,3,If you are indian, you prob won't be impressed by the chai. Chili dosa is too  spicy and the avvacado DOsa is bland.
2020-01-26,1,Their online pictures were way beyond tempting but their food was a major disappointment. Their dosa combinations are terrible, none of the flavors go along. Plus their food seemed to be assembled and warmed rather than prepared per order.
2020-01-20,3,Good ambiance and setup for a nice afternoon hangout after lunch.  Very nice variety of food the dosa waffle should be a must try. The chai isn't great. We got three of them and they were all either chunky or burnt or flavorless/milky. The host was just busy with orders and we observed the tea as being over boiled beyond the temperature making it very hot and lose taste. Better luck next time. One employee seemed more interested to talk to another colleague rather than not focussing on the tea getting over boiled. Hence the three
2020-01-15,3,It was good 3 months before but they downgraded themselves. No more fancy serving. But they have added toasts.
2020-01-13,3,We visited Simply Chai probably as soon as it opened. I probably ordered the wrong food in there and so my experience wasn't the best. I felt the food is slightly overrated. However, I like the casual approach to theplace. It's a only a couple of minutes walk from the Hoboken Path Station. The drinks are pretty good. The accompaniments with the tea create a nostalgia of my days back in IndiaElaichi cardamom chai: A nice creamy Indian tea(Indian tea always includes milk) with the flavours of cardamom. This flavour is not appealing to everyone. The tea is thick and creamy. It is accompanied with "Little Hearts", a popular cookie in India. The tea is spicy and the cookies are sweet making it a great combinationAssam Tea:This is a water based tea. It is very similar to Breakfast tea. The aroma and flavour, both are strong. Only if you like slightly sour teas should you opt for this oneDosa waffle:Dosa batter is made of rice flour. The consistency is very much like that of a pancake mix. The rice flour mix is poured on a waffle maker to provide this Indian-Western dish. I found it a bland. There should have been some chutney/syrup with it like with a dosa/waffle.Bombay Dreams:Bombay is known for its chaat food. Chaat consists of sev(a deep fried savory snack made from gram flour), tamarind chuney, cilantro-mint chutney and raw onions. This is exactly the same. It has a rice waffle stuffed with all these ingredients. Due to so many different flavour and chutneys, one does not need a condiment with this plate. It is just enough for one person and better than the Dosa waffle
2020-01-12,4,This came up in my yelp suggestion and wanted to give it a try. On entering the cafe, I liked the ambience of this place. Decor was nice and good hangout spot to grab a chai with your friend on weekend. Coming to order, we tried Bombay Sandwich, Masala Chai and Filter coffee. Masala chai was good - probably had a little bit more milk for our preference. Bombay Toast was different and good . This is not typical one you would expect when you sell as Bombay Sandwich (usually would be toasted and 4 triangles,  which are easier to eat). My bad in trying filter coffee.Shouldn't have ordered it in a chai shop.(tasted like instant Indian coffee). There is a lot of room for improvement.Overall experience was good and might give it another shot to try few other items in menu.
2020-01-11,5,This place is literally the CUTEST coffee shop ever!I came here to do some work and I had the whole place to myself which was absolutely lovely. This place has outlets under each table which was so convenient because I was in need of a quick charge for my phone and computer! The staff was really kind and definitely very attentive when I need any help finding an outlet or getting the WiFi.I ending up getting the Saffron Chai and needed help picking which milk would go best since I didn't want whole milk and my barista recommended going with the oat milk and DAMN was it FIRE!!! I enjoyed my time here especially since it's so aesthetically pleasing to sit inside. I also enjoyed the detail in the decor which made my stay feel very homey. If I'm ever in the area I would for sure come back to this place! Also, I realized the owner is the same owner of Hidden Grounds from Rutgers NB which was pretty cool to know because I just graduated from there this year.
2020-01-11,5,first things first: thank you for the keeping the green wall and the "Good Morning Sunshine" sign.Basically I had a very complicated day and came here twice.The first time, I got a to-go order of the Saffron Chai Latte and Bombay toast. The person I got it for said it was good, and I was already going back to Hoboken... so why not try it for myself?A couple of hours later I walked in and ordered two drinks for myself (heh), the magic masala chai and the saffron chai latte of course. Andddd they were both amazing. It was the first time I had hot chai, and their signature really earned its title. The perfect spice, sweetness, and slight creaminess from the milk equals magic!!! The menu at Simply Chai has a lot of variety and twists on popular breakfast items (bagels, toasts, egg), and the extensive chai flavors is a reason to stay here all day. I can't wait to sit down and study here (aka write reviews). See you there :)
2020-01-10,5,The drinks were amazing, and the place was so warm and cozy. The server, Alex was awesome and pleasant! Definitely coming back here and recommending to my friends!!
2020-01-05,4,Just went for lunch with my family and the ambiance is so beautiful! It was a nice, chill spot with good drinks and food. We got the burning woman and Bombay dreams dosa waffles. The bombay dream tasted like a chaat in a sandwich. The burning woman was good but too garlicky. The saffron chai was really good and the rose was also good but not my favorite. Definitely want to go back to try other chais. Also a perk, when you check in on yelp, you can get a free cappuccino.
2020-01-04,4,I have been wanting to check this place out for a while and it definitely lived up to my expectations. I got the chai flight which included masala, ginger, and cardamom chai with skim milk and also got the Bombay dreams waffle. The chai was served piping hot and was full of flavor, but it was a little sweeter than I would have liked. Of the 3, the ginger chai was my favorite. The waffle was delicious and had just the right amount of toppings.
2020-01-03,5,So delicious. Worth a stop. I am a huge fan of chai and the cardamom chai is great. Have so tried the Bombay and the burning woman. I wish they did chai usinss a caffeine rooibos base as then I could stop in after 4pm  and actually get chai. To management: please consider adding a caffeine free rooibos option!!!!
2019-12-29,5,Great place to get a quick bite, their chai lattes are good (cold ones) . Also this place is good if you want to sit n talk unlike other places in hoboken which have loud music and are way too crowded . Would like to visit again ! :)
2019-12-23,5,Update: Ordered the spicy egg and cheese bagel and filter coffee for breakfast. Both were delicious. The bagel sandwich was the perfect amount of spice.
2019-12-14,2,If anybody really knows what "Chai" is, you would not drink this.. They are just using pre mix powder, and mixing in milk. Ok even if you have to do this, charging $4 plus? Tastes horrible. Akin to putting ketchup and cheddar on a piece of bread and calling it Pizza.On the Contrary, the Dosas were really good. Focus on that, remove the word Chai from your name, or get Real.
2019-12-13,2,Nice space. Love the decor. I like the chai and dosas. They taste good but aren't mind blowing. Tried their toasts and they tasted bad unfortunately. Quite pricey! They do a better job with the dosas. My biggest issues with this place include the following: 1) not a good spot for breakfast - we came in around 8:30am and the chef showed up after 9. Because of that they encouraged us to get their toasts. Not good at all. Worst toast I've had. 2) very very very slow service. The location of this place is close to public transportation. Most people come in the morning for a quick bite and drink. However, this place keeps you around for a while. If you have a job or need to be somewhere in the morning, avoid this place. There's no sense of time and respect for it here. We came in several times and nothing has changed. Chef shows up later well past the opening time. 3) i don't appreciate self service. Especially given the money I pay here. The prices are insanely high and you need to bring the food to your table? Not a good business model. 4) super empty. No one goes here. The vibe is sad. Ppl come for free coffee and that's about it. I wish them the best of luck. My spouse and I will not be back anymore. We gave this place so many chances. We have had enough.
2019-12-13,3,Recommendations: Saffron Chai with Oat Milk, Cardamom Cold BrewThe short:- small business - delicious drinks- opt for savory dosa waffles- beware of the preserved and artificial- not an ideal study spot- pricey breakfast spotThe long: So excited to see the owners of Hidden Grounds branch out into restaurant cuisine. Many businesses have rotated through this space on Hudson, each retaining the decor (namely the greenery in the back that makes for a trendy Instagram or Yelp photo). Simply Chai added additional touches, such as hanging colorful umbrellas from the ceiling, adorning family photos on the walls, and featuring a bookshelf of items for purchase. Points for the metal straws and brushes - love the eye to sustainability. I would highly recommend their Chai & Thandais, my favorite being the Saffron Chai with Oat Milk. The crushed pistachios bring out the floral saffron, and it's just so deliciously creamy. As always, I am pleased to see non-dairy alternatives. If you love coffee, my partner recommends the cardamom cold brew. The cardamom intensifies the flavors of the coffee without making it overpowering and it has a smooth finish.I recently went for a sit-down breakfast. Service was quick and kind. Be mindful that this is a self service establishment. We ordered the Burning Man and Sweet Tooth dosas. The Burning Man dosa is fittingly named - the onions and green chilis have a great kick. It paired well with the savory dosa batter. However, it left something to be desired. Though packed with a lot of heat, it lacked a variety of flavor that makes for a satisfyingly complex dish. As for the Sweet Tooth, I was disappointed. Of course, it's my fault for not realizing that mango rasna is in fact an enriched fruit powder. I didn't find that it paired well with the savory dosa batter. Perhaps additional fresh fruit would have made it a better combination. While I am sure that processed amul cheese and rasna elicit memories of childhood, for the price I would prefer fresh ingredients. For instance, I would love to see a mango chutney with fresh chopped mango and other citrus fruits.I attempted to study here after breakfast, but even with my noise cancelling headphones, I found the music to be too loud. Personal preference.In a future visit, I look forward to trying the highly reviewed Bombay Dreams and an Adrak Chai.
2019-12-12,4,A friend highly recommended this place and eventually took me there herself. So I came all the way to Hoboken from Brooklyn here even when I don't drink chai!For the Dosa waffles! We tried the Burning man and the Chaat one (forgot the name) and both were amazing!!! Burning man is true to its name , very very HOT , loved it. Favorite part is they use Amul Cheese , takes you back to India. The Chaat was very pretty tasty too, well balanced flavors. We also tried a rose chai milkshake which was too good!The concept of dosa waffle is still very interesting to me. Must try, everyone! And you will keep coming back if you live in Jersey City for sure.
2019-12-10,4,Came here for lunch the other day with my mentee and loved it here. The ambiance is absolutely beautiful - I love the decor in the restaurant, it feels very homey. It's a great place to get work done as well. I had to sit there doing work for a few hours and it was pretty convenient. A lot of outlets along one side of the wall. I ordered the Bombay Dreams Dosa Waffle and a Rose Chai. Wow, that dosa waffle was incredible. Bombay Dreams was very delicious, but also WAY spicier than I could handle. I was sniffling the whole time and chugging my rose chai to make the pain go away. It's not for the fainthearted for sure. However, if you can withstand the spice, the flavor is well worth it. Loved coming here. I'll be back to try one of their sweet dosas soon!
2019-12-10,3,Orders the millennial dosa and it wasn't bad but it was nothing amazing either. It was overpriced almost 13$ , but since it's in Hoboken I suppose that price is reasonable. If you're desi don't expect to love  this place, it's mostly for goray who want to come for the aesthetic.
2019-12-09,5,We had Bombay dreams and burning lady/woman waffles, adrak chai, and filtered coffee! The food was quite extraordinary. If you look at it, it doesn't look Indian like food. However, when you eat it, it feels like you're back on the streets of India (sudden explosion of flavors).Ambience and Customer service was really nice too!
2019-12-01,4,I visited Simply Chai this past summer shortly after their grand opening. Upon entering you will notice ample seating and a beautifully decorated restaurant (both inside and out!). You can tell they put a lot of effort into making this space aesthetically pleasing while keeping a nice cozy vibe.I ordered the hot masala chai and burning man. My friend ordered a Cold Brew Limca and Just Dosa. All of our food was very good and quite filling. The cup for my masala chai absorbed the heat from my drink and made it nearly impossible to hold. While they look pretty, I don't think those particular cups are practical. The Limca was very refreshing..I've never had a drink like that before and glad I gave it a try! Parking can be a pain (typical Hoboken). However if I'm in the area, I will return!
2019-11-26,5,I wanted to try this spot solely to see if it would be great chai and it simply did not disappoint! I had fresh ginger pieces in my chai which shows that this place only uses fresh ingredients. I loved it and I'm proud to support a new neighborhood gem.
2019-11-26,5,I got hooked on chai in college. It was an eye opening and mouth watering experience to discover chai latte! However, I've had many chais and chai lattes since, and have not been able to match my initial enthusiasm for the craft until just recently when I discovered Simply Chai - Hoboken! Upon the first sip, I immediately became nostalgic and transported to my first experience with chai. So, whenever I want to remember the old times and look ahead to a brighter day, I get my fix at Simply Chai. You should too.
2019-11-22,4,UPDATE:Immediately after posting the original 2-star review below and speaking a second time with the barista about the noise concern, I received a prompt and gracious response from the owner of Simply Chai, and the staff on the premises asked the sleeping woman to turn off her radio. Now it's super serene in here, and I can plan on coming back again when I'm in the area. THANK YOU SO MUCH. And I sincerely apologize for my implied assumption about the woman in question in my review below. That was discriminatory on my part. Thank you again. I really appreciate your attention to my concern. ORIGINAL REVIEW:Staff is allowing a woman to sleep at a table in the cafe with her radio blasting. I find this incredibly disruptive. When asked if they could turn her radio off or down, the staff replied that she's sleeping and they don't want to disturb her. So you would rather disturb ALL of your paying customers?The chai is amazing, the food is delicious, the concept is great, the decor is lovely, and the staff are lovely. I just can't see making this place a regular spot if people are allowed to blast their radios and make everyone else in the establishment listen to it. I understand a percentage of this business's profits go to housing for the homeless community and I support that. I don't support ANYONE's music or radio disturbing everyone else's air space in an establishment where almost everyone is paying to be there. Sorry, I guess I'm a capitalist and a businesswoman at the end of the day.
2019-11-18,4,A pretty novel idea with dosa waffles and chai. The waffles themself are pretty crisp, fluffy and well made. I thought the toppings were good but maybe would have preferred the waffles on its own. The chai is not truly chai but an average rendition of it. I see where they are taking it hence the 4 stars. The decor is eclectic and the space is pretty open. I would return to try the wAffles again (and probably make them at home too in the waffle iron)
2019-11-15,2,This morning the cashier was clipping her fingernails at the register. I understand it's annoying to break a nail and you want to fix it, but just excuse yourself to the restroom. I'm grossed out but giving two stars because the chai is fine. The dosa was nearly burnt but not inedible. I just prefer my dosa to not include human fingernails as a topping. :P
2019-11-10,3,SIMPLY disappointing experience NO CHAI at a CHAI place at 11:30a on a Sunday during heavy brunch traffic time!?!? Alternatively opted for the hot version of the  Saffron Milk with Matcha and when I asked for CHAI biscuits to go with it, I was asked to pay extra ‚Äç. #doubleFAILThe food is great when prepared as described on the menu, however some of toppings were missing on our 6 waffle order and some of our waffles were cold. Not sure if they were sitting in the back to get all 6 ready and served them out , but maybe worth revisiting the bussing process to get orders out as they are ready. Think the concept is great. But when you are spending close to a ~$100 on 6 waffles, 3 hot beverages and a bag of chai biscuit (yes, I had to buy a bag since I was refused the ones that should have came with my beverage) at minimum you'd expect things to be as described.
2019-11-06,5,Walked in, loved the decor, loved the friendly staff, loved that I could wander and gaze before I ordered, and that my hesitation between 2 different items started a conversation with the staff person about the taste and temperature of the items. Walked out with a hot ginger chai. It was LIFE. It made my wait for a bus hummingly heavenly. It was the kind of thing you burn your lip on, but you can't let that keep you from another sip. I will return as often as I can.
2019-11-06,5,Delighted to walk into this new sensation. A cute and elegant Indian chai shop. The latest in the trend of tri state area Indian origin restaurants going beyond the typical fare.The menu is small but satisfying. I had the ginger chai. Very legit, in taste as well as presentation. For breakfast I had the bombay dreams dosa waffle. As a former Bombayite, I approve. It's basically the insides of a typical bombay street sandwich, served between two (non-sweet) waffles made of rice and lentil batter. Delicious!Highly recommend. I'll be back often. It's just a couple of blocks from the Hoboken Terminal, so scores on accessibility too.
2019-11-04,5,Even though I miss Sunnyside Cafe (what this place used to be) for its avocado toast and acai bowls, I'm SO glad that they were able to replace it with this adorable South Indian Cafe.It's so refreshing to see an ethnic cafe amidst all the other basic espresso bars/coffee shops in Hoboken. Simply Chai serves AMAZING chai's! I got the Magic Masala Chai (flavor is great and it's served in an adorable clay pot) and wished we had the dosa. Will definitely come back for that.
2019-11-01,4,I love Simply Chai!! The decor is beautiful and makes you want to sit there and relax for a while. I have been there twice now and my go to order is Bombay Dreams Dosa waffle and Masala ChaiThe only reason I took off 1 star is because their cutlery was not clean the last time I went
2019-10-24,1,I have come here 3 times already in past month, and each time it's the same experience. Great chai and horrible dosa waffles. They always come back either too soft and this past time burnt. I asked for no cheese and was horrified watching the cook wipe it out with his bare hands. Will not come back.
2019-10-20,3,Cute atmoshpere and decorations on the inside. The chai tea is good. I went with my friend who got the rose chai and I got the saffron chai and both were delicious. I thought dosa waffles were an interesting concept. I got the mom waffle. Which was a dosa waffle that had some butter and scallions on it. Very savory. Came with coconut chutney which what I thought was going to taste lile coconut of course. But it was a green mush and spicy. Not what I expected. For 9 dollars it was way overpriced for a waffle. Waffle was crispy and thin, not very fluffy. It was good and edible not terrible, but really disappointed by the chutney. And when I asked the wait staff they didn't even offer honey or another side instead. Also when I got my chai they ran out of pistachios and I saw them run out and she was like "umm sorry". And I heard the other guy behind the counter say he would grind more so I told her that I would wait. Instead of giving me the chai without the topping I would have expected her to tell me herself it would be another minute. Wait staff definitely needs some more hospitality training.
2019-10-20,4,Loved the vibe of this place! Very cute aesthetic with plenty of tables to sit at. I got the Saffron Chai which I'd recommend. I think the drinks are on the pricier side, so I would go once in a while but would definitely recommend.
2019-10-19,5,Do not order the burning woman without cheese. Its absolutely delicious don't get me wrong, but without the cooling effect of the cheese the spice really grows and grows. Its worse than the korean spicy ramen buldakbokeumyon. I absolutely love spicy and can hold my own but this is definitely on another level. You need the cheese, do not be a fool like I was. Their chai is absolutely great as well, word of caution if you don't like starbuck's almond milk you wont like the almond milk here but their oat milk is quite good. Haven't tried the coconut milk. This place is really great 10/10.
2019-10-12,5,A cute chai based cafe serving good drinks and food with fabulous Indian themed decor.Detailed Review:Absolutely loved the Indian themed decor which gives it a hip modern cafe feel. The food and drinks served here were great and it is slightly expensive for drinks but the dosas are reasonably priced. The ambience was great, would definitely recommend the sofa seats with cushions to sit and work a few hours or spend a leisurely afternoon here.During my visit, I had tried their Rose thandaai with Bombay dreams dosa. The rose thandaai was a gently flavored rose drink which was light, delicious and very pleasant to have. It wasn't overwhelmed by sweetness or rose essence and had good balance. Magic Masala Chai was really great, not a huge chai person but it was really flavorful. The Bombay dreams waffle dosa was great, it packed a punch of flavors with the green mint and date chutneys. The Bombay dreams waffle dosa was a fusion of the classic Bombay sandwich and the savory waffles. FYI, few may find the savory dosas like the Bombay Dreams pretty spicy and be mindful. The portion sizes were great and service was just fab.Btw, they serve Little Hearts biscuits with Chai. FYI, Little Hearts is one of the most iconic Indian heart shaped biscuits/snacks from the 90s and is still pretty popular. Recommendations:Drinks: Magic Masala Chai (hot), Rose Thandaai (cold)Savory Dosas: Bombay Dreams or Burning Man
2019-10-09,4,If you are looking for authentic desi chai, you have to go to this place. TBH I went in with low expectations and order a ginger chai, it took about 10-15 minutes to get my chai as the place was crowded. The chai was perfect, and believe me i'm a big time chai critic. Extra points as the decor of this place is really chic. Next time i would love to try their dosa waffles.
2019-10-07,5,This place is so magical for the best chai tea . The front of this tea palace is warm and inviting , beautiful flowers decorate the entrance. And as you walk into the wonderland of chai dream you are greeted with the most colorful vibrant festive umbrellas !  Everyone that worksHere is so lovely and beyond helpful .My chai is just super yummy and fullOf Magical chai dreams :) it also comes in a mason jar which I love ! Thankyou simply chai for making my chai dreams come true !
2019-10-06,4,The decor here is soo cute, done tastefully with contrast but still brings in pops of culture and color.  I had the Bombay Dream dosa with the rose chai tea... the dosa varieties looked Delicous and so different.  The Bombay dream was the perfect amount of crunch and it was stuffed with cucumber, mint chutney, sweet chutney, scallions and sev. The favors were great and the rose tea was so good I wanted to chug it down.Last thing the staff/team could improve upon is the check in coupon - there are a handful of folks that dont drink chai or coffee (vice versa), the check-in coupon should apply toward a drink of your choice... not solely a cappuccino!
2019-10-05,2,We stopped by here since we haven't seen many places serving good chai. I will admit their drinks are good, not great. The place however appears to be run by a bunch of kids (especially 1 girl) who are extremely loud and constantly screaming. It is not a pleasant experience at all sitting down here. You are constantly faced with loud screams from behind the cashier. All in all, stop by here ONLY IF you are happy having a bunch of kids screaming like the world is on fire.
2019-10-05,5,Amazing place with very cute decor. The teas (chai) are very authentic tasting; and the dosa waffles are finger licking good :)
2019-09-29,5,Love this place! The ambience is so cute, perfect for a quick and casual lunch. My favorite was the Bombay dreams-it was simply chaat on a waffle, but the flavor was outstanding. I had the iced rose chai and my husband had the masala chai, both were great. I would definitely come back and recommend this spot!
2019-09-29,5,Amazing place for Indian chai lovers, Bombay dosa waffles were awesome. The cafe decor is very cute and it is in a very lively place in Hoboken
2019-09-28,5,Loved the flavors of chai and good options of Sweet and Savory dosas. Decor is so authentic and pretty. This place has become Saturday morning tradition for me and my roommate.
2019-09-24,4,I went to Simply Chai around 8:15 am on a Thursday morning. There was no line and we were able to order immediately. After ordering, are food was ready in under 10 minutes. We got one sweet (the Beignet) and one savory (The Burning Man) waffle. Both were good in their own right, but I think I personally enjoy sweet breakfast foods more. The Beignet was light and had a healthy amount of powdered sugar on it. The Burning Man had cheese, onions, and tiny jalapenÃÉos on it that gave it an unexpected but enjoyable kick (not too aggressive for any spicy averse readers). Overall good experience and would return!
2019-09-23,5,Lives up to the name "simply chai"Very good atmosphere to bring the whole fam. It offers traditional chai (hot or cold) with different/cushion beverages such as shakes with ice cream and lattes with various milk options.They also have some sweet and savory bites that include waffle dosas/ dosa waffles that come in different options to satisfy that craving with the beverage. You will also find a friendly staff and a clean environment with buy your own chai packages. Overall, great Sunday afternoon spent chit-chaaaating!
2019-09-19,5,Loved this spot! If I was to ever open a coffee shop, I'd want it to have this vibe - authentic, creative, clean, pleasant and homey. I ordered the Burning Man dosa waffle and my husband ordered the Millennial. The Burning Man was spicy (as expected) and AMAZING. The iced rose chai was legit too. The cold brew Limca could've been better but I'll take it - the bar has been set high by the other items on the menu. I genuinely hope the quality and vibe is maintained here. As an Indian, I've been dying to see Indian food go mainstream and this genius dosa waffle combo is definitely a step forward!
2019-09-09,5,Being South Indian and hearing about dosa waffles was a first for me! How have I never thought of that?! Regardless, this concept and execution is well done indeed! Nothing only did I give the food two thumbs up, but my very picky Indian mother loved it too! We went over on a Saturday morning around 11 am and there was no wait or line to order. We got the Bombay dreams dosa and it was really tasty! I debated getting it without the cheese (i don't like cheese usually) but decided to give it a try since it was Amul cheese and ended up loving it just the way it was! If you've ever had a Bombay veggie sandwich, this is exactly what you'll get when you order the Bombay dreams. It's piled high with sev and chutney and a good portion of food! (Could be shared between two people if you're not starving) I paired breakfast with a masala chai and it's truly worth the $4! Perfectly spiced and sweetened with a bonus side of little heart cookies (Indian snack biscuits)
2019-09-08,4,I really love the authentic taste of the various chai teas here. I had the ginger chai on a cold and rainy day and it was the perfect drink to make me feel warm again. I'm not as much of a fan for the waffles but only because I don't enjoy eating processed food. The ambience and service were also really great. Good place to study or go for a date!
2019-09-07,5,Really nice place. Must for chai lovers. We had burning man and the millennial. Next time I m gonna try guilty pleasure.
2019-09-01,5,This place is AWESOME! As someone who's a total sucker for tea (and being competely obsessed with chai), I love this place. Simply Chai is such an amazing addition to North Jersey - the only tea cafes are in NYC so I'm very glad this cute little place opened up! The atmosphere is super cozy and welcoming, feel free to bring a book or your laptop. I had a few of their chais and decided the masala magic was my favorite! Can't wait to come back :)
2019-08-30,2,I love chai so of course I felt inclined to check this place out. The Dosa waffles were ok in flavor but they were extremely chewy & not crispy at all. The chai taste like they pour a syrup in it & it is definitely not made in house. A waste of $15!
2019-08-29,4,Kudos to authentic Indian masala chai and dosa waffles. We Indians survive on chai and this is the best place ever happen to us in Hoboken. Ambience is pretty and quite to do your work and to hang out with friends.
2019-08-28,5,Been here twice and it's so good! The burning man waffle is my favorite. The customer service is awesome and the ambiance is great! Personally I think the savory waffles are better than the sweet ones, but I don't have too much of a sweet tooth. Overall great experience every time I have been! And I love taking my friends here too
2019-08-24,5,Loved this place! Ordered the millennial and burning man. Simple menu, delicious taste, and great service! I subbed the feta cheese on the millennial with amul cheese and it was amazing. Take each bite dipped in the honey first and then the Siracha!The burning man dosa waffle is perfect if you're craving something spicy and savory! The amul cheese on it makes the entree. The ambience is adorable. All the employees have great customer service and the decor is very cute!P.s. if you show them your yelp page you'll get a free cappuccino!
2019-08-24,4,Really liked the ambiance and the fact that it's spacious. The masala chai milkshake was delicious. I would order that again in a heartbeat. -1 star for the Bombay dreams dosa waffle. I wanted to love this, but it seemed a bit off somehow. Maybe I had unrealistic expectations that it would taste more like an actual dosa? In any event the cheese was really overpowering so if I were to order it again (and that's a big if), I would ask to hold it. It took over the texture and flavor and I could barely finish it -- which is out of character for me. This was really more of a 3 star experience, but I want them to succeed so hope they'll take the constructive criticism into account. We need more businesses in Hoboken like this, not more pizza, poke, or chains.
2019-08-23,4,Stopped in here today to try their chai teas and coffee. Service was slow. I ordered the chai flight (three of their traditional chai teas) with almond milk, an iced latte with almond milk, and I got a free cappuccino (with almond milk) from my yelp check-in (yay yelp!!). I was given the chai flight in a cute wire carrying basket. The tea cups are hot! The magic masala was the best of the three with a light spice taste. Then the ginger chai with hint of ginger taste, and then the cardamom chai. I liked the shortbread cookies it came with too. Yum! They gave me a hot latte instead of iced, whatever, I didn't bother to say anything because of my initial wait time. And I am not a fan of the coffees. The cappuccino and the latte were both too acidic for my liking. More almond milk may have helped to tone it down. The foam on the cappuccino was delicious though. And I love the presentation. The ambiance of the place is nice too. Very cute inside. The doors were open for fresh air and a cooling breeze. I ordered an iced rose chai to go. No rose petals in it. The taste was okay, very aromatic. It was refreshing.
2019-08-20,5,Loved this place, nice bright ambience, friendly service, and freshly made beverages + good variety of food.
2019-08-19,5,What an amazing find. In the heart of Hoboken commuter central, I am so glad they exist. Growing up in India, tea is hands down something very personal and nostalgia for me and they do it exactly, if not better than what I am use to. They have some amazing Dosa Waffles which is such a simple, yet extremely creative way to present something familiar. They serve Coffee from their Hidden Grounds Coffee Roastery so you already know it's going to be great. Must visit if you are in the area. It's worth spending 15-20 minutes finding a parking spot. FREE WIFI, which is always great!
2019-08-17,5,I'm so surprised that the food is amazing! Didn't know what to expect. Wow what a nice new found!
2019-08-17,4,I got to be the Super Chai Taster at Simply Chai and loved the chill vibe of this place. The menu is unique and smartly brings together Indian flavors with American food. I loved the saffron tea and rose shake (Roohafza) here. The dosa waffles are amazing too. We had burning man and bombay dreams. Both were good. With Bombay Dreams, my problem was that it had too much 'chutney' that imbalanced the flavors for me. It would be ideal to provide the chutneys on the side so we can put as much as we want.Service can definitely get little better.But super excited to have a chai place close to home. Definitely coming here again!
2019-08-17,4,I finally got a chance to come in yesterday morning and was eager to try something from the unique menu. I ended up going with an iced rose chai with oat milk- it was delicious! Also had a sampling of the millennial dosa topped with sriracha- also loved it and will definitely order next time I can stop in for longer. However, the service has room for improvement. The woman who was behind the register was far more interested in her phone than servicing the customers. It was empty other than 2 people seemingly having a meeting on their laptop. It was also well last rush hour so the lack of attention was definitely off-putting. Hope you address the service here soon as I'm looking forward to sampling the rest of the menu.
2019-08-13,5,Yes!! I love this place! We ordered the burning man dosa waffle. Super spicy. I hope they keep it this way and don't americanize the flavors (read dull it down).I love that they have amul cheese and different tandais as well!I am also stoked that I can get thumbs up (Indian version of coke)- I miss the taste!The food gives you a nostalgia of India with a fusion kick to it!We also tried the flight of chai (3 different chais) all were fantastic.I can't wait to come back!!
2019-08-12,5,The most amazing chai you will ever have!! The service here is great and the food and drinks are amazing. If you're looking for super authentic chai, this is the place to go! The dosa waffles are SO yummy. I love the Bombay dreams waffle! I am so happy that Hoboken now has such a unique space. And it's close to the pier! Definitely come here and check it out.
2019-08-05,4,We went there on a saturday morning and the place was not crowded at all.Good ambience with some Indian decor.Wr ordered the magic masala chai,saffron chai,royal saffron chai and dosa waffles(mom's favorite and Burning man).Saffron Chai was my favorite.Magic masala chai was good too.Not a big fan of royal saffron chai but my husband liked it.For the dosa waffles, mom's favorite came with a coconut chutney and it was delicious.Burning man was okay.We expected burning man to be spicy but it was not.The service was good and people were nice.
2019-08-04,4,Nothing so simple about this Chai! They have a really cool, diverse offering. From rose to pistachio to cardamom flavors - hot and iced. We tried ours iced and it was a little sweet/syrupy for me (though I never like sweet). Next time I'm going to try hot.The dosa waffle is awesome. We tried "Mom's Favorite" which comes with butter and coconut chutney. I guess I thought it would be sweet, too - but nope! Savory, fluffy, and filling. Perfectly balanced the iced chai.One note - wish the music was as chill as the space!
2019-08-01,3,Spent this morning ready to try out this new spot with a friend, drove about 25 minutes to be the first of my local friends to try this location. We went in eager to give our support to a new  chai spot and support a small community. Having walked in, we were pleasantly greeted by a barista who was kind and helpful with our order. We were in love with the personalTouches in the decor and festive umbrellas that reminded us of South Asian festivities we grew up with.We were expecting some of a warmer welcome by the owners or managers of the establishment who seemed to not pay much attention to the new customers on the first day. We inquired about the promotional drip coffee that was advertised on the instagram of the business. I was shocked that I had to ask for dripcoffee in a way where I felt like I was doing something wrong. In a cafe setting, I do expect a personal touch. However, it felt quite cold and flat. Maybe have it out on a tray for samples or something next time?It wouldn't be crazy to expect some sort of customer service from the owners or managers. I think this touch is vital for a new business, especially on the first day....The gentlemen preparing the chai went from the counter and walked passed us and went straight to his computer to do work.  I feel there were enough people in the establishment to mingle with and get a sense of welcoming from! It's a perfect time to informally gage your customers who came on the first opening day. To the orders: We got the saffron chai- iced, masala chai, Millennial Dosa, and the Sweet Tooth dosa.The masala chai came in a piping hot clay mug, traditional and cute. However the presentation was not efficient or practical. I had to wait for it to coolDown to grasp the cup without hurting my fingers.The saffron chai was a sweet blend of chai with hints of rose and could be great for someone who wants a subtle tasting chai with a new age twist.The sweet tooth came with chocolate syrup. The mix of chocolate and traditional Dosa didn't appeal to our palette. Probably because the amount of chocolate was overwhelming. We sat there wishing we had a cinnamon apple/caramel/ dosa. We loved the concept of a sweet dosa, but this was a reach.The millennial dosa comes with feta, avocado (fresh!), and a choice of honey or sriracha on the side. We enjoyed this dosa thoroughly and would definitely come back for it. Overall, it's a nice spot to catch up with friends and enjoy the ambiance. Great for someone walking by.  I appreciate the barista's kind service. I am disappointed by the apathy given to us by the owners and or managers that were overseeing today.  We walked in overly eager to congratulate and rave about the place but we ended up sitting in a quiet area catching up as old friends.
2019-08-01,5,This place is amazing.  Brought to you by the owners/partners of Hidden Grounds JC & Hoboken, I was lucky enough to meet/see them again at their newest location that has a tea (chai) forward drink menu, modern twists on an Indian food staple (dosas), and all of the straight forward crafted coffees you've come to know and love.It's conveniently located by the path, so great to pick up a quick drink or light bite on your way to work or home. I was fortunate enough to be selected as one of only 10 super tasters in advance of their grand opening (which is today, 8/1, so hurry on over! They just announced on insta that they're serving free drip coffee all day on the house!).I tried the dosa beignets, the mama's favorite I believe it was called (dosa waffle with coconut chutney made in house, and their hot Chai flight).  The waffles are super fluffy, interesting because they're savory, not too heavy, and filling at the same time (the beignets were also waffles if you're wondering ).  So the real question of how you decide between food items on the menu is what you want on your dosa waffle.I also had the privilege of trying the Chai flight-it's 3 of their signature hot chai teas (I believe made with whole milk which made them super luxe and yummy), and served in these mini clay pot-like glasses on a brass caddy.  Super cool presentation.  The magic chai was my absolute favorite (and I almost NEVER drink Chai).Go there.  Support a newly opened business.  Get the Magic Chai.  You're welcome!
