2021-11-07,2,Today we ordered the Diavolo Dolce pizza and the Baby Kale salad for pickup. As usual the pizza was good. It's one of my favorite pizzas in Hoboken.The baby Kale salad on the other hand was terrible. So bad that we had to throw it away and this is because the salad was swimming in the very sour dressing which made the entire dish very difficult to eat. Take a look at the pictures and you'll get an idea of what I'm talking about.
2021-10-27,5,Hoboken has a lot of competition when it comes to italian/pizza places and I like each in there own ways. Ambiance and quality is what comes to mind on this gem! The pizza is very delicious and you can taste the quality in the ingredients. They also are located on the very west part of hoboken which is typically less crowded and quieter than the other areas here. I love sitting in their outdoor seating at night, great place for a date to have quiet conversation too.Pro tip, they make their bread in house, order some fresh!
2021-10-23,5,Still a great place for pizza and pasta!Always enjoy the cacio e pepe and carbonara. We sometimes share as an appetizer then get a few pizzas. Red one and white one!
2021-09-19,2,Good food, horrendous service.  Rude waitresses trying to push you out the door from the moment you sit down.
2021-09-02,4,We live a block away and came here for the first time last night (at the start of hurricane Ida). We were only one of two tables in the restaurant, so service was great. The vibe inside was very cozy, and love that its BYOB. We had the mussels in white wine sauce to start - AMAZING. They gave us spoons to eat the leftover broth because it was that good. The bread they provide on the table is also incredible. We got the Cacio e Pepe, and two small pizzas: one with sopresatta and one spinach and artichoke. Both were delicious, but different. The spinach and artichoke was much lighter than we expected (in a good way) - had spinach leaves and artichoke slices on top of mozz cheese and wasn't any sort of creamy spinach and artichoke dip mix on top (which is what we expected). Pizza crust is SO thin and crispy, loved it. They even gave us a tiramisu on the house to share which is always a nice surprise at the end. That was also clearly freshly made. Can't wait to go back!
2021-08-13,1,I live in the neighborhood and wanted to give Panello a try since it's closeby. Absolutely horrible experience and food. Firstly the service was really bad , with due respect to the staff who where doing their best, they appeared to be in a rush! Don't understand when half the place is empty what's the big rush.. the food was the bigger disappointment, Also, the menu and the pricing is not consistent with the final check .. absolutely appalling and the staff is completely clueless.. again poor management ! I just saw other reviews on Yelp and I echo the same, the pasta was more like noodles with salt and pepper! Like home style Italian .. not sure from where.. Overall one of the worst experiences I have had!
2021-07-24,4,Nice owner. Nice ambiance. Pizza above average but not as good as Porta. Certainly better than dozzino .
2021-07-19,5,We would love to give 10 stars to this fabulous restaurant. We had a baby shower here, and the restaurant literally knocked itself out with great staff, super appetizers that could have been the main meal and delicious thin-crusted pizzas. We especially loved the one with truffle oil and mushrooms. They let us set up a bar, bring in our special home-made cookies, a super cake and lots of decorations and candies. The ambience is a hip industrial look, big windows, rustic tables. We are so happy there were some leftovers for the mom-to-be and husband to take home. We'll be back for sure. Thank you Panello's for making our day extra special.
2021-06-26,2,I'm not even going to do a big review on them because it's not worth the time. But ya pretty much i was hoping my cacio de Pepe would be worth the waiters bad attitude, but it  wasn't. It was noodles and pepper. No other type of flavor.
2021-06-25,1,I feel stupid supporting this place through the pandemic!Classist & not family friendly whatsoever when it comes to in person service! Ordering 1 main course at 5pm to feed my hungry toddler doesn't make me a lesser customer, who is not extended any of the several courtesies that every other table received. To top it alL I get a filthy high chair and on pointing it out, am told "at least we have high chairs"For a restaurant that is in the middle of Hoboken with 2 child care facilities, an international school and Monroe Centre literally across it, this place needs to shut shop if they don't want to entertain families/children! Keep up the attitude, you'll turn away more customers!
2021-04-25,5,Wonderful local restaurant with great food and service.  The owner really cares about his customers and makes sure they are comfortable especially during Covid times .
2021-04-17,4,My husband and I was there last night for dinner.  I must say that this place is very very good.  The ingredients used are top notch, the taste is authentic and the manager or co-owner was very engaging- from Chile.  One of the best meals I've had in a very long time.  Prices are very reasonable as well. I have no complaints and that's rare for me.  I would definitely recommend Panello.  Just loved the LePanyol.
2020-10-25,5,By far my favorite place to eat in Hoboken. The food is always fresh and delicious. The staff is friendly and accommodating, you can't go wrong. I have lived in Hoboken for 7 years and eat out a few days a week, always eager to to new places, and can't find anywhere that holds a candle to Panello's food and service.
2020-10-23,2,Honestly had a great meal a few months ago, that I talked it up to my foodie friends. Went back tonight with a group of 5, our main courses were never cooked. My fiancé had went inside to ask where they were. A few seconds later 3 pasta dishes came out then we were told 5 mins until pizzas come out. This was after the table next to us was told their pizza was forgotten and it just went in the oven and only takes 3 mins.  It was either new owners or new water or dough, but aside from the service, the food was wildly disappointing in comparison to what was served just back in August.
2020-10-23,3,Don't ask for tap water unless you know they will charge you $7.00 for a bottle of Panna. Ordered bread and butter. Charged extra for butter. Who does that? Pizza was pretty good and nice outdoor seating. No liquor license so bring your own wine
2020-10-17,2,Take out beware: We ordered a large pizza and 2 pasta dishes. We were told it was 45 minutes wait to pick up so we arrived on time. When we got there the food was cold and it had definitely been ready for a while. When we got home we saw the pasta dishes barely had any pasta. I mean you could SEE the bottom of the take out trays. $70 later, barely any food, and the owner or manager refused even a partial refund or any sort of resolve. The customer service is really lacking and the price point is waaaaaay too high when there's a ton of other great Italian places in Hoboken.
2020-10-07,5,Hands down best pizza in Hoboken although their apps, fish, and pasta specials are always amazing as well. Lots of outdoor seating in a romantic park like setting. The owners are always in the kitchen and they take pride in their food (it shows!!). BYOB
2020-08-29,5,It took a while for my Fiancé and I to give this place a try but we are so glad we did! Every single bite I had tonight was absolutely delicious. I thought the menu was limited but after reading the menu which was focused on pizza and pasta I loved how they had ~8 seafood specials.  The focaccia with olive oil and balsamic was nice and salty and sweet. The special stuffed mussels was amazing. There were 12 and we are them like oysters and we said we could literally eat 100 of these. The gnocchi with 4 cheese was very decadent and it hit the spot, and the burrata pizza with sourdough bread that was wood fired was so tastey. It was so delicious we are going to consider having our rehearsal dinner here next summer!
2020-08-26,4,Solidly delicious homemade style pasta and oven pizza.  Friendly service, with great outdoor seating.
2020-08-03,5,Amazing food, and even better service! My wife and I reached out to multiple restaurants about hosting a small post-wedding dinner just as Hoboken was opening up for outdoor dining. While most restaurants either wouldn't return our calls or weren't willing/able to think through the logistics of such a reservation (within the city's guidelines, of course), Frieda at Panello was incredibly accommodating. She went above and beyond to work with us in this time of uncertainty and gave us the perfect dinner to cap off an incredible day. In addition to their thoughtfulness, the food was fantastic! We started with a custom antipasto platter, shrimp skewers and baked artichokes. For our entre, we ordered an assortment of Pizzas (#CovidWedding) and the Penne Vodka to share. All the food was amazing, but I kid you not: the Truffle pizza was one of the best pizzas I've ever had. We'll be back for that alone, but all around, we give Panello 5 stars!
2020-07-26,5,Great food, lovely ambience (especially the outdoor dining set up) and a very kind staff. A Hoboken hidden gem!
2020-06-27,4,I love Panello's nduja (calabrese spicy sausage paste) pizza the most. It's unique and actually very spicy. Kale's crispiness gives great texture to the pizza. The only reason that it's four stars is because of price. I think it could be 1-2 bucks cheaper for what it is. It is a personal pizza not a large size pizza. Overall great!
2020-02-12,2,We had reservations here but we ended up waiting almost an hour to be seated after arriving. They threw in a free appetizer for the wait so that was good. Our pasta dish was wayyy to peppery, almost inedible. The pizza dish we ordered was pretty good but not amazing. I've definitely had better.
2020-01-16,5,Another pleasure to review after a spate of nasty places and owners (Ridgewood) excellent Panello with food, service, ambiance and value.   Another Hoboken home run Italian with naturally risen pizza and bread so beautifully done.  Also homemade pasta and nice starters   The pizza dough and bread they give you uses sour dough technique - as all the high end places are doing and was the original method.   It's not sour tho. Naturally risen product yields far more tasty and lighter bread which is pure and deep in flavor and much better for the digestion and gut. Look it up.  But the toppings and ingredients here are super fresh and top-tier so the pizzas and pastas are very much like you'd get in Italy. Also the burrata here one of the best around - served over nicely breaded eggplant.  The wide pappardelle with porcini and shitake so good, they added pan fried prosciutto which added a bit more salt than was necessary tho.  Orriechette with sausage perfect - like grandmas, and the carbonara excellent.  Salads wonderful, dressed perfectly and again, super fresh. The top off of the experience was the Canolo.  Nearly impossible to find the real deal anywhere in US even at the famous Italian pastry shops where the Canoli cream is thick like wall paper paste and far more sweet than creamy.  Not here - here just like southern Italy and Sicily where the ricotta is lightly sweetened and still creamy, milky and perfect.  And the shell is wonderfully crisp and tasty, not like the soggy toilet paper tube at many other places. To me, good canolo is almost as good as ...  - well you get the picture. Certainly sets up the mood (nothing pisses me off more than a crappy meal) - so last night was a  good nite - if you get my drift ... Lots of love in the product here. Like some other great places in Hoboken the real deal. Nice friendly staff too. Recommended.
2019-12-30,5,Panello came as a recommendation from someone I met sitting next to me on a flight to Vegas (lol!). My boyfriend and I have lived in Hoboken for 5+ years and it took us a while to give it a shot. We are sure glad we did and we continue to be impressed by the cute ambiance, fresh ingredients and creative menu that sets Panello apart in the city where there is an Italian restaurant on every corner. We love the BYO aspect and casual, but trendy, atmosphere. Great for date night and family. It's not the largest space, but they take reservations and there are long picnic tables outside that can accommodate larger groups. The pizza is phenomenal - thin crust, artisanal wood fire style - and they offer so much more than pizza. A few of our favorite dishes include the Kaleabrian pizza, bucatini carbonara and a fried artichoke appetizer we've been ordering from the specials!
2019-11-16,1,I went about a week ago , and it was last min, place to eat some pizza with my friend. We got our seat quick but the SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE, the table next to us was getting two waiters checking up on them more than us. The waitress that took our order forgot our order that the other waiter had to come and ask us again. I will not be recommending this place to none of my friends in hoboken to go there. i do give the pizza 7.0
2019-11-05,2,Overall experience is a 4/10. We got seated right away and was not given anything. Had to ask for the bread and an ice bucket for our drinks three times. We got the burrata and it was the highlight of the meal. The food was okay, slightly creamy on the sauce. The service was really what got us. They were walking around to see when we put our card down, after telling us to take our time and finish our wine. There were a few other couples in the restaurant but plenty of tables open. However, what really grinded our gears was when the waiter came over to check our wine bottle to see how much we had left when they were for another hour and 45 minutes. Overall, we will not be returning.
2019-10-27,3,I really wanted to like this place more, but it just didn't do it for me. Horrid service, they were SO understaffed on a Friday night and we had trouble getting their attention to open our wine and Also ordering our dinner. Server did not come over ONCE after we put our order in to see if we needed anything. Pizza was OK, we tried the burata and truffle mushroom. Nothing special and was a little too burnt for my liking. I had the Bolognese, it was also just OK. Not enough meat, and charged me extra for asking for a scoop of ricotta on top (who doesn't put ricotta on bolognese?????) I enjoyed my friends gnocchi in cheese sauce, but they were a tad doughy and I couldn't imagine eating a whole bowl, super heavy. With such good italian places around, I just don't think this one compares.
2019-10-17,5,The gold standard of wood fired oven pizza.Ridiculously delicious creative hand crafted recipes are to die for. Pasta and appetizers were also out of this world.Would eat here every night if I could.
2019-08-09,5,Absolutely AMAZING!My wife got gnocchi in vodka sauce and fresh mozzarella and I ordered the tortellini in some special sauce that is still making my mouth water. Overall, it was a wonderful dining experience and we cannot wait to return!
2019-08-07,1,We just finished having dinner at Panello.This is our 5th time here and the food is not the same. Maybe they changed chef. Me and my wife had the burrata for appetizer and it was really bad sour and dry inside.. not to mention the pizza it was not the same they must have changed the mozzarella it was very oily.. I'm sorry this place is not the way it used to be..
2019-08-06,5,Love this place - Best pizza and pasta in town!
2019-07-28,1,Terrible experience tonight. My husband ordered the Ribeye--Medium Rare. Came out Well. No pink at all. It was grey. We NEVER send food back but had to this time. It was the last of the Ribeyes and we were offered a different cut but my daughter and I were already part way through our meals so it wouldn't be worth it to wait. When the check came, we were surprised to see that nothing was comped from the bill. We paid $54 (incl 20% tip) for a watermelon/feta salad, rigatoni in meat sauce (completely plain, no ricotta or anything), and a kid's penne with red sauce. So we went out to eat as a family and only some of us ate and they didn't seem to care. I could have gone to Trader Joe's and made this meal myself for about $8. I get it--going out to eat is more expensive because you're paying more for everything...the service, atmosphere, etc, but when not everyone eats, doesn't that defeat the whole purpose?I waited tables for a long time and find this a ridiculous way to treat customers.
2019-07-25,5,I have been living in Hoboken for many years and Panello is my favorite place for many reasons. I come from an Italian family and whenever I'm at Panello I feel like I'm at home. The owners, and employees are all so kind and generous. The food, all of it, I've tried everything, is always phenomenal. Please do yourself a favor and let Panello become your favorite spot in Hoboken, too! What are you waiting for -- go now!
2019-07-13,5,I don't know how this place only had 4 stars. It is incredible. Every dish I have had here is so simple,  yet so wonderful. I feel that Hoboken restaurants that are in the upper echelon for taste fall short compared to this place. Stick with the pasta and you won't go wrong!The cacio peppe and the bucatini all'amatriciana (special) are fantastic.
2019-07-05,5,The pizza was superb. The pasta topped it and the branzino filet took my breath away ! A superb restaurant with a friendly vibe and great tasting food. Bring your own wine from a next door store and you will have a great evening. Promise!
2019-06-14,4,My second time here and a close friend of mine goes there often. "It's so good it's literally the best. It's quality" The staff is friendly and welcoming. Service is solid, they're on top of it. Went here as a group - they can only split it 2 ways if you have a card. Would go back and order take out. I'm a huge penne vodka lover and they perfect it.
2019-06-04,4,The best brick oven pizza in Hoboken and amazing pasta's.Also always good service and its BYOB!
2019-04-09,5,Went to Panello for the first time today and it was amazing! The restaurant is gorgeous, the decor is beautiful and it was super cozy on this rainy evening. Brian was my server today he was so friendly and super cool, I feel like we are best friends now. My entree was amazing. I had the tagliatelle oreganata it was light and fresh and so tasty. For dessert I had the cheesecake it was heaven. Can't wait to bring my family and friends here and to try the pizza next time. Thanks Panello for a great dinner!
2019-04-05,5,This is the real deal! The owner and his wife operate and do all the cooking. They understand quality ingredients and are passionate about their product and what they produce. It is hard to find restaurants that have that old school Italian cooking mentality paired with a super modern and accommodating vibe. Great for a date or a group. Bonus points - This is a BYOB
2019-03-09,4,I have been a consistent fan of Panello since I moved to Hoboken 2 years ago. The service has greatly improved and the food is always good. My one and only complaint was removing the squid ink pasta from the menu. This dish was so good, and I am very sad it's gone. I know there are a lot of other options on the menu, but I can't eat a lot of Italian due to cheese. I would really love for you to bring this back on the menu. Please!
2019-02-18,5,Very cute rustic local Italian eatery.The pizza was thin and perfectly portioned. Was quiet for a drizzly Sunday night but I would return any day of the week for that pizza!  They did have other food options I just didn't eat them. Sorry!
2019-01-03,4,I always love finding new Italian spots in Hoboken. This is such a cute place and I really loved the feel inside. It's intimate, but also a large enough space to accommodate a lot of parties. It's also BYOB, which is a plus! We started with the burrata appetizer, which was amazing! For my entree, I wanted to order the penne alla vodka, but they weren't able to make it without pancetta (I'm vegetarian). I was disappointed, but I get it. So, instead I went with the Cacio e Pepe. It wasn't the best I've had. The pepper was really overpowering, and I wouldn't order again. The pizza they were making looked delicious, so would try that next time!
2018-12-10,2,This may be my least favorite Italian restaurant in town- idk maybe it was a bad night? It's right near my building and I've been wanting to try it for months. For whatever reason I haven't but now that I did we weren't impressed. First off, when we walked in on a cold Saturday night there was condensation on all the windows/doors, it was like a sauna/greenhouse. Kinda humid and a little stuffy we figured it was busy so it must be great. We ordered the buratta pizza  - it was ok nothing special (crust was delicious however so kudos on that!) and the arugula salad. The salad had great flavor (was perfect to split) with a light lemon dressing but was kinda missing a topping, like apple slices or nuts...something crunchy. We then ordered cacio e pepe (+ pancetta), the serving was fairly large but the first few bites were just ok... quickly our tastebuds were on fire. Not spicy in a good way, almost too much so we sent it back! Ugh! I hate sending food back, I felt terrible- it was also very salty. The waitress mentioned maybe it was the pancetta? Our waitress was very accommodating and turns out the pancetta is in every pasta dish so we got the Papardelle alla panello without it- the mushrooms were cooked perfect but the dish was very oily/buttery and still a little spicy? Idk why everything was spicy.. we likely will not return. We were so bummed. I really wanted to like this place!
2018-12-05,3,I really wanted to like this place - BYOB Italian is the way to my heart. However, our meal was super $$$ despite no alcohol! Our table ordered shrimp skewers that were on the specials list - "skewers" actual meant ONE skewer with four shrimp on it for $18! What a rip off. For entrees, we had the gnocchi & eggplant parm - everyone loved the gnocchi, but the eggplant parm was BLAH. Flavorless and not as cheesy as I would've liked. The ambiance is very nice - they also didn't take reservations on the weekend though, so we waited 45 min. Overall eh experience.
2018-12-03,5,Unreal pizza. Stumbled in here on a Sunday afternoon (to my surprise there was no wait). Must try their cacio e pepe and the pizzas are phenomenal!
2018-11-05,5,WHAT A HIDDEN GEM! We just moved to Hoboken and asked a few of our friends where we should get Italian for dinner. Panello is a few blocks from our apartment and we decided to give it a go, even though none of our friends had been before. I'm so glad we did- this is our new favorite restaurant in the area and we've brought a bunch of friends with us since! The pizzas and pastas are incredible. The calcio e pepe and spaghetti with clams are to die for. In terms of "pizza," you HAVE to get the diabolo dolce. Mind you I am not a fan of white "pizza"- I was less than pleased when our waiter and my husband insisted we try this diabolo dolce "pizza." White pizza just doesn't feel like pizza, I argued. I need my red sauce, I cried. This is a flatbread, I insisted. My husband ordered it anyway. Boy, am I glad he did. The diabolo dolce is unlike anything I'd ever had. It is a must have. But I stand my ground on it really being a large circular flatbread. Their BYOB policy certainly doesn't hurt and we love the entire staff- everyone is so friendly and wants to make sure you're happy with your meal. Can not recommend this spot enough!
2018-11-04,5,Excellent service. Excellent pizza, salads and coffee! Panello is a BYOB restaurant with good  ambiance and great food.
2018-10-28,3,It was ok... I had pesto gnocchi which was too light on the pesto and heavy on the oil... wife had Napoli style pizza also ok... but not as good as urban fire in Madison and 2x the price... on the plus side this place has a cool atmosphere and is BYOW
2018-10-07,5,Panello is my FAVORITE Italian spot in Hoboken for many reasons.1. it's BYOB - who doesn't love bringing their own favorite wine to dinner to pair with an amazing Italian dinner 2. Every single homemade pasta is incredible. Their gnocchi and ravioli are my personal favorite, my mouth is literally watering thinking about them. The ravioli is made with gorgonzola and walnuts, and is in 4 cheese sauce - it's delicious! 3. Their pizza is also mouthwatering. 4. We have been and tried every dessert on their menu and have thoroughly enjoyed each and everyone. 5. It's reasonably priced!It's an absolute must if you are in Hoboken, you won't be disappointed!
2018-10-06,1,Went with a group of friends for dinner. Everything was great including the service and quality of the food. However, upon paying a nearly $300 bill, the server informed us that they wouldn't accept a credit card split because the restaurant didn't want to pay the extra fee. Thinking this was a bit ridiculous for a large bill I asked the server to reconsider her position (the server herself was just fine). She said it was the owner's position and the owner wasnt available. I reluctantly gave her a single card saying we were unhappy and asked her to pass on our discontent to the owner. As our server was processing our bill at the register the owner (an older woman) entered the restuarant and our server immediately went to her to explain our desire to split the bill. I clearly saw the owner shrug her shoulders and say she didn't care. She couldn't even be bothered to come to the table. The server came over and basically confirmed the owner wasnt interested in our complaint to split the bill. Although the meal was nice, it's clear the owner is only interested in money and not about client satisfaction. I will never return as a result. I recommend you avoid this place. The owner does not care about the customer and is only interested in money like so many unfortunate people in this world. I WILL NOT ever return.
2018-10-04,5,Panello is a hidden gem in Hoboken.  The food is excellent, the staff is warm and friendly, and the atmosphere is very inviting.  When the weather is warm it is so nice to sit outside for dinner here, especially with the new updated courtyard.  Great place for kids, too!  I am shocked by the subpar reviews I see.  I grew up with my Italian Grandma's cooking and Panello is honestly up there with real authentic, simple Italian dishes.  I've never had a dish I didn't love and I have tried many apps, entrees, & pizzas.  To name a few - anything with burrata, eggplant, meatballs, lasagna, cacio e pepe!  Now I'm hungry
2018-09-09,3,Food was very good and BYOB is great. The service and atmosphere though were unusual. I went on a Saturday night around 7, so I expected to wait a little bit. However when we got to the restaurant there were many many tables available. They would not seat us because they were waiting for larger parties that had made reservations.  One of those large parties  did not show up until after we had finished eating, and by this time there was quite a bit of people waiting for a table. Also, way too many kids .
2018-09-07,1,Unfortunately, I can no longer recommend this place.  Food is excellent and I used to get great service here, but the last 2-3 times I have eaten here have been marred by horrible service. At best, I felt like I was in a diner. At worst, service was downright rude.  Burata with eggplant came without eggplant.  A simple tomato salad came as a more expensive caprese salad.  When I mentioned it, I was told "that was what I ordered". Really?  All the appetizers came at once with our main course. Really?  Saw this around me consistently while I was there - which they pushed me out in about 60 minutes.  Really?  Get your act together and hire competent waters. Otherwise, save your money and go to a diner.  Bottom line:  Don't bother!
2018-09-07,1,Have always enjoyed their pizzas and pastas, however, their customer care has gone downhill.  We asked if their kale salad had nuts and the waiter was going to check.  Then our kale salad came out with nothing but kale and apples.  A side of walnuts, seeds, and cranberries accompanied the salad after we asked where the rest of the salad was.  The menu never included walnuts in their salad.  Finally the issue was resurrected by a conversation with the waiter who confirmed, no walnuts, just seeds- and brought out the proper toppings. It started to drizzle, so we moved inside to stay dry before the rain.  After finishing our meal and paying the bill, we poured our last glass of wine to finish.  The waiter came up to us to state that someone had made a reservation for the two seats we were sitting in and that we'd be expected to get up.  I literally hate when waiters or waitresses do this, it's so tacky.  So we chugged our wine and got up, but not before checking their website for their reservation rules.  Of course plain and clear it states that they do not take reservations for parties under 4 people.  Rude and poor customer care.  This will be my last visit to Panello.
2018-09-07,1,I have to say the pizza and pasta were pretty good. Unfortunately my bad experience here happened at the end of the night when the waiter asked us to leave because our table was "reserved" for another party of TWO. By the way, this place does NOT take reservations! So he lied.. We had finished our meal and had already paid for at this point, however, we were finishing our last glass of wine (this place is BYOB). The waiter should have been able to read this situation because he unfortunately is now the reason I will not go back to Panello.
2018-06-25,4,Great pizza and BYOB spot in west Hoboken. We love the margherita with prosciutto and the diavolo dolce. They do take out as well!
2018-03-19,2,I tried Panello for the first time on a Sunday night.  I had a reservation for 5 people at 5:30 pm which was good since there was a large party of 18 people coming at 6:00 pm which took up a lot of the seating.  Panello is off the beaten path in the Monroe Center so it's good they have a free parking lot for patrons.   I was very underwhelmed by the experience though and won't be making the trip back there anytime soon.  There are definitely more affordably priced BYO pizza spots in Hoboken (Napolis, Johnny Pepperoni, the Brick) that have bigger menus and better tasting food. When we got to the restaurant, the server immediately told us several main items that weren't available (crab cakes, lasagna, the special hangar steak, and a few more).   I was surprised to hear that the pizzas only came in a personal size - 12 inch pizza -  since the bulk of their pizzas were priced between $18 - $20 and that's very steep for a personal pie.  In addition, their pasta dishes ranged $18 - $22 and again, it was not a large portion for the cost.  They told us they had eggplant parmigiana as a special - when we asked if it came with a noodle, they said no - also surprising.  We tried the stuffed mussels and spiedini to start.  The stuffed mussels were underwhelming.  The spiedini was good. For dinner, three of us got personal pies and two got pasta dishes.  I ordered the special Burrata pizza pie ($19).   It looked and tasted identical to the Margarita pie someone else at the table ordered.  For $4 more, it wasn't worth it.   Tasted like average pizza.   Also, it was very hard to have a conversation at our table - since there was a very large party, it was very loud in the restaurant and the acoustics there are not good.    Overall, not worth the cost or the trip.
2018-03-07,1,We had a private event planned for this restaurant months in advance and when I asked the owner if I could give a deposit she said there was no need. When I circled back she emailed me to say they had another party booked. Not once did we receive a phone call or follow up. When I called the owner she just simply said that they can no longer have our event. It did not matter to her that this event was so important that we booked at the end of September for a May party. It did not matter that we have invitations printed. It did not matter that I have emails and texts confirming our party time and date. She simply did not care. She was unapologetic and completely unprofessional. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
2018-03-03,1,Service was awful waiter was clueless over ordered so ask waiter to wrap food to take home PIZZA was put on a paper plate to many other pizza place in Hoboken that will cost u less the $70 for much better service
2018-02-22,5,Delicious Italian food. Almost everything I tried was pretty good. Would recommend this place for a casual night out.
2018-01-17,5,Just had my boyfriend's surprise 30th birthday party there last Saturday and I can't say thank you enough. From the food to the service to the ambience, everything was perfect! His friends and family LOVED the the variety of food! (If you're planning a party, I recommend getting pasta AND antipasto, it was the perfect amount!). Frieda was so incredibly kind throughout the entire process. I will 100% be back for another party!
2018-01-13,4,I've lived in town for 10 years and I'm very set in my go-to spots. Long story short, Panello has been added to my rotation! Came here with a friend for dinner on a Saturday night, 7:30pm no wait. I called ahead when they opened and was told for a party of 2 no need for a reservation -- they were right! When my friend arrived a few minutes before me, they tried to seat us by the door (on a very cold January night which we declined). The guy didn't seem to understand people have an aversion to the cold, seating close to other tables isn't a problem! Fast forward-- Our server seemed like management, and he was super friendly and attentive. This is definitely a family owned business, and it shows! We tried the octopus special with potatoes, the eggplant appetizer (heavy on the garlic in a good way), and shared the Finochiella pizza with fennel, mushrooms, caramelized onions, and sausage. We ended the meal with tasty cappuccinos (trying an alcohol free January; but this place is BYOB). Next time I'll try the pasta!Ps for everyone complaining about the paper napkins, they've changed to cloth!!
2018-01-13,5,Great pastas and coffee! I would like to try their pizza next time (looks great too)... highly recommend this cute and delicious neighborhood Italian
2017-12-31,5,Hoboken has pizza in every block. This place in my opinion is the best in town. If you want to eat good Neapolitan pizza this is the place. If you want to eat fresh pasta dishes this is the place. Big fan of the owner/chef Iggy and his wife Frieda. When you interact with them you can clearly see they are enjoying they are doing. They are great hosts and the service staff is friendly and attentive. I wish them all the luck and hope to eat there more. Highly Highly recommend.
2017-12-15,2,This place started out great but recently it's gone down hill and the prices have gone uphill, I used to go here once a month and have gone with lots of people, however I went the other night with my wife and paid $60 with tax and tip for 2pizzas and a bottle of water, there are many alternative pizza joints mine will be the new Napoli's on Clinton and 2nd
2017-12-12,2,I hate to have to give bad reviews especially when it's for somewhere I have previously liked but after my most recent experience at Panello I have to...My husband and I went there for dinner on Sunday night. I noticed that they now close at 9 on Sundays so we went there at 8 o'clock. There were only a few other tables occupied when we arrived but the server wanted to seat us at a small table right next to the door (in December!) and adjoining a large and somewhat loud table. This was the worst table in a less than half full restaurant, so of course we declined it and sat elsewhere. We ordered two pizzas and a bottle of San Pellegrino, the first pizza was a special and it was excellent (the only reason this review has two stars instead of one is because of this pizza!). Then the pizza guy came over with 'our' second pizza, but it wasn't the pizza we had ordered so he went off to make the correct pizza for us. Second pizza shows up - a white pizza with fresh tomatoes, arugula and Parma ham. We have had this many times before and it has always been good, this time it was highly disappointing - there was very little tomato, the arugula was well past its prime and the Parma ham consisted of a few scraps complete with inedible rind.But the bad pizza wasn't the worst of it - from 8.30 onwards we were made to feel very unwelcome. The staff clearly wanted to close early, they started cleaning around us, scraping metal chairs across the concrete floor and whisking away our condiments while we were still eating. The female owner kept walking past our table and glaring at us making a point of staring at our food to see how much we had left - so rude! I've worked in restaurants and I get it, it's a long day, but you should never treat customers like they are in the way. You chose to give us a table and take our order, You are advertised as being open until 9, which means that you take orders until 9 and treat customers like valued guests. We weren't loitering just trying to have dinner - we had finished by 8.50 when you are still technically open for another 10 minutes.  Our bill came to $61.00 (with tax and tip) for two pizzas and a bottle of water. Prices here used to be very reasonable but they have gradually crept up, and frankly due to the way that we were treated and the poorly executed second pizza I thought that this was very overpriced.I've dined here numerous times over the past couple of years and taken lots of people there to eat but after this expensive fiasco I won't be returning.
2017-12-10,5,Amazing! 5 stars for sure! I was visiting the area with my family and we stopped in at 5pm but they were closed--the door was locked. The owner saw us attempt to come in and ran our side, opened the door and explained they weren't opening for another half hour but invited us in anyway. She couldn't of been any nicer! And to top it off, the food was amazing!!! So happy that we ate here! Great people. Great food!! Oh and very very very kid friendly! Great highchairs. Staff was amazing about getting kids food out quickly and they were super super sweet generally. Amazing!
2017-12-01,5,Very nice experience. Off the beaten path. We arrived without a reservation, but only waited 20 minutes. Everything was right on--pizzas, cacio e pepe, olives,and cannoli. BYO, which will keep the bill very manageable. EASY PARKING.
2017-11-25,5,I really love the spicy pizzas. And of course love that it's a  BYO. Nice atmosphere with the exposed pizza oven. Lately it has been getting packed here at night !
2017-11-20,5,We had such a wonderful dinner for my son's 2nd bday! The food was delicious, Frieda and the staff could not have been nicer and more accommodating, and the overall ambience was great! Can't wait to come back, especially for the eggplant and the beet salad!
2017-11-10,4,A great BYOB spot off the regular (beaten) paths of Hoboken.  The menu, including specials, were extensive; options for everyone.  We started with the pasta y fagiloi which was perfect on a cold night.  The olives and burrata appetizers were delicious starters before our pizza.  Ambiance is sweet/intimate and the wait staff was fantastic.  Great date night out and we'll be back again.
2017-11-01,4,Great find in West Hoboken. Came here with my mom visiting from out of town and we we're looking for a quick spot to eat. We were pleasantly surprised by Panello, a cute BYOB spot with a wood fired oven, exposed brick walls, low lighting = immediate mid week relaxation.As soon as we sat our wine cork was popped and bread slices and olive oil served. The Evoo was of excellent quality ( the type of olive oil provided is always a great precursor of the meal for me). We started with the beet and honey goat cheese salad which we really enjoyed and split the lasagna amatriciana as well as the pesto pizza. Everything was excellent -- nothing too traditional nor pretentious about this Italian spot. It was delicious and of good quality!
2017-10-14,5,Excellent pizza!!! Came for a private party and the food was out of this world. I will definitely be back!!
2017-10-08,1,Ordered Panello on Postmates for the first time, ordering a Diet Coke and Pizza.  The Diet Coke was $3, figuring it was a 2 liter, and upon delivery was given a can.  Talk about serious markup!!!  Thinking it was an error we called the restaurant and the rude host responds, "we're BYOB so that's why the can is $3, and if you been here you would know that (why would I know that if I'm ordering on an app?)."  What does bringing your own beer to a restaurant have to do with a $3 can of soda?!  One piece of advice, advertise on the app that it's a can not 2 liter, don't be deceptive and shady!  Will not be ordering from this restaurant again!!!
2017-09-28,5,Panello has without a doubt become my favorite local restaurant !! I am never disappointed as the service and the food are consistently top notch !! Gene was a terrific server as he greeted us instantly with such warmth and displayed a true genuine knowledge & passion for the food, wine and venue itself. I was extremely satisfied with his suggestion of the papardelle alla panello as it was one of the most delicious pasta dishes I've ever had and I come from an Italian family ! :) I will be back again and again.
2017-09-23,5,A solid pizza place, the Diavolo dolce pizza is delicious and different (white pizza, with kale, black olives, hot peppers and drizzled with a little bit of honey).  The first time I've been to this place the waiter seemed impatient & overwhelmed, the second time the service was much better.  If you like white pizza, they have a good selection.  The place is always full, but I never had to wait. This is a place for families and couples alike. There's a small outdoor area too.
2017-09-22,2,Not reccomonded for people on a budget, a few friends and I ordered one personal pizza to split and it was $20. The staff were very rude, we did arrive 15 minutes prior to closing, but they still seated us when they could have just turned us away. Terrible service but I will say the pizza was great. However good food is not the only thing that makes a good restaurant .
2017-08-27,5,Best ever. Service and food are always amazing. Panello never seems to disappoint. It's one of the best restaurants in Hoboken
2017-08-11,2,So like overall the meal wasn't too awful and I had the Speck-tacular pizza which was okay but not amazing and we had the burrata appetizer. The biggest issue was the special that my boyfriend ordered. They had a bucatini carbonara which sounded very good. When we got it though it was the definition of a bad carbonara. It was pretty much just scrambled egg pasta and not very appetizing. I'm certainly not a chef but I know that they key to carbonara is not to scramble the eggs.
2017-08-06,5,Great Food & Service! BYO Great Red Wine with the flank steak! Make sure you call ahead because most likely this place will have a wait on the weekends. Everything that passed us on the way out looked amazing so I know that I will be back to try more on the menu.
2017-07-10,4,Great, authentic Neapolitan brick oven pizzas! The crust has a nice char on the bottom which is always what you must look for. It is crispy, light and airy. Their 700+ degree oven gets it there. You really get the taste of the tomatoes and the fresh mozzarella cheese with every bite. This is the way pizza is supposed to taste folks! Iggy, the owner, was very nice and a pleasure to speak with. He's from Italy, knows his stuff, and puts out a very high quality product. Tiramisu was light and moist, not dry like many places put out. I definitely will be returning to try some of their pastas and their other pizzas.
2017-06-29,5,Our favorite restaurant in Hoboken. We're here once a week :) Owners Iggy and Frieda are so kind and warm, and their staff is as well. We love the Kale-abrian pizza, the squid ink puttanesca, the spiedini and the caccio e pepe pasta (ask to add pancetta!) BYOB, unpretentious, consistently excellent and now has a lovely outdoor patio, too!
2017-06-22,4,Good pizzas, decent pasta. The meatballs are nice. Not mind blowing but a safe choice. The owner is very kind, which is always cool.
2017-06-22,1,The worst pizza place. Went there couple of weeks ago with a friend, the waiter was very unfriendly and service was pathetic. He came to us gave the menus and left, we asked him to help us out with picking a pizza as it was our first time. He helped us as he was forced to talk and stand at our table. He didn't tell us we have to pick a sauce too as on the menu there was a heading with different sauces and we thought the sauce is always on the pizza why add more sauce. It was the waiters duty to let us know which he didn't. When the pizza came after a long wait it was burned on the sides and no sauce on it. We were shocked to see the pizza and of course without sauce it was tasteless. We asked for sauce and the waiter gave us a small tiny bowl of sauce that too after a long wait. There were garlic and crushed pepper bottles on other tables but non on ours. We again asked the waiter to gave us the bottles and again he gave it to us at least after 10 minutes wait time. I will never recommend anyone to that place. Instead of apologizing to us for the burned and without sauce pizza and bringing another pizza he gave us a bill of $25.
2017-06-18,4,Been here several times for dinner-done in house and take out (they don't deliver).  This review is for all 5-10 of those experiences.Pro's:  the food is consistently good, not too expensive, service is usually quick, and we've never been turned away due to seating.  The owner, Iggy, is always here-make sure you meet him-he's nice and make sure everyone enjoys their experience! They have a regular menu and rotating specials, think more carb-heavy options (pizza, pasta), with a few salads.  The tiramisu is AWESOME and we love the pizzas.  Mention yelp for 10% off the bill!!!Con's: not many, but there are a few things you should know:  it's BYOB, the don't take reservations, and there's only indoor seating.Worth a try if you're in the area-swing by the casual, authentic Italian mainstay!
2017-06-11,1,One of the most unsatisfying meals I've had in a long time. I would categorize the entire night as lacking any sort of flavor.We started with the beet & goat cheese salad and the frisée salad which were barely dressed but fine (actually they forgot dressing on my wife's but whatever it happens).  Then we had a capricciosa pizza which tasted like bland ricotta cheese on soggy bread. My wife ordered the oricchette with sausage and broccoli rabe - an institution at any Italian restaurant and it was just shockingly bad.  Shockingly. Bad. Over cooked floppy oricchette, medallion slices of sasauge (literally not even 1 links worth) and some broccoli rabe. I tasted it and I'm pretty sure it was just plain pasta. They claim there is olive oil but it was drown out by the water from the pasta that was not properly drained so collected at the bottom of the bowl like soup. Zero taste.We spied an affogato on the menu before we showed up. I love affogato and get it whenever available.  The meal was just so underwhelming in every course so far that we skipped dessert and left.  Not worth the ~$85 for two people which is surprising because the place had such good reviews.  Disappointing.
2017-06-10,4,Great restaurantGreat serviceGreat foodDelicious pizza and squid ink puttanesca Beautiful decor
2017-05-27,5,Delicious squid ink puttanesca and thin crust fresh pizzas! Loved it! Beautiful decor too. Wait staff were very polite and couldn't do enough for us. So nice!
2017-05-23,5,Great pizza and Spinach Gnocchi with Pesto was delicious!
2017-05-20,2,Some salt can actually bring out flavor in the food- try it out it helps!  Way too loud even for Hoboken
2017-04-21,1,This was my second visit to Panello. I will never go back...I went there for my daughter's birthday dinner after a painting party upstairs at Artevino. I Had made reservations for about 16 individuals early on a Friday afternoon.The moment I arrived I was treated as though we were a huge inconvenience.We were rushed and ignored.The owner asked if I thought we'd be quick---"like out by 7:15?" I had to bring my own plates and forks for the cake I brought.The teens in my group didn't even get napkins or silverware to use! When I wanted to order additional items from the menu it was as though I cursed them! The pizza was average and nothing compared to LaSorrentina or even Brooklyn's Pizza. I paid a lot of money for substandard everything! Everything about this place left a very bad taste in my mouth. My guests were mortified and I felt embarrassed. Never again!
2017-04-21,2,As cute and trendy as this place is, I will never return. We went there this evening for my niece's 13th birthday party --- an exciting day for a newly minted teenager. Unfortunately our memory or the early evening was soured by the fact that the owner treated us like he was  doing us a favor for letting us be there. They removed the place settings, napkins and silverware from our table as if to assume we would use our hands as utensils and clothes as napkins?  And then the icing was watching the waitress literally dump the birthday cake on the table like it was on fire and refuse to let us use their plates and utensils (because we should have brought our own)! There is no excuse for the service we received tonight. Iggi and his staff should think twice about treating paying customers like that in the future.
2017-04-17,5,I wish I could add more stars.  Hosted a group of 20 here over the past weekend and couldn't be happier with the overall experience.  I worked with Freda and the staff the week of to create a family style menu that covered all of the bases.  On the night of the party, everything was ready to go when we got there, the food was amazing, the staff was attentive, and the price was just right.  Would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking to book a place for large groups, let alone a regular dinner.
2017-04-05,5,Have had many dinners and now a few lunches here. The food is fantastic. I have never had a meal that was less than perfect. The steaks are better than any I've had in any steakhouse and the fish (bronzino) and the salmon are excellent. Pastas are wonderful. I suggest caci y pepe. I have also sampled all the pizzas and they are pure heavenly. The only one I can't eat is the one with the spicy Spanish peppers. My wife loves it but it's just too hot for me. There is also a parking lot which is an added bonus for Hoboken since I drive from out of town.
2017-03-27,5,Best paninis ever...crusty bread with yummy fillings... try roasted red pepper and mushroom... two different sandwiches... great service... will return
2017-03-26,4,I was recommended this place by a local friend as somewhere to get a quick bite before I left the area. The wait staff was great and my food came very quickly. It's not a cheap place but is pretty in line with the prices of most places around the NYC area. The food was 4/5 stars and the restaurant was clean. The only negative was how loud the place was, I could barely hear the person across from me. It was a very family friendly place though if you are looking for somewhere to go with children.
2017-03-18,3,Came here for the first time ever today.We were in a bit of a rush, but the service was very good and the food came out in 5 minutes!Everything was tasty and prices were normal for NYC/Hoboken.I have to be honest though, as nice as the food was, it's a terrible place to go if you don't have small children. It was very family friendly, more catered towards kids.If you are looking for a calm peaceful night out, I would steer clear. I feel bad leaving a three star review; but I'm 25 and it's Saturday at 8pm, crying children shouldn't be the highlight of the meal. Service was great, food was good, I think next time I'll just take the pizza to go.
2017-03-13,5,This place is simply the best Italian place in Hoboken. Love the gourmet pizzas with homemade sauce and dough and the grilled salmon dish!! We lived just across from Panello and have been visiting the restaurant since it opened a few years back. Its menu has expanded recently and we love the selection. Very friendly couple (owners) and inviting atmosphere. BYOB is definitely a plus!!
2017-02-24,4,This place is down the block from my apartment complex, so it's really easy for a quick date night without having to put too much thought in! It's really warm inside because of the brick oven so be prepared although it's awesome in the Winter time! The place is BYOB and there is a wine store next door that you can pick up beer and wine from! We ordered the salmon, it was well cooked an flavorful, the beet she goat cheese salad, hanger steak, and a pizza.The crust on the pizza was great as were the ingredients fresh. The salmon was well cooked but maybe a little under seasoned. The hanger steak came on a skewer which was surprising, I felt it was over cooked even at medium rare and didn't really have that much flavor despite the type of cut it was. Our waiter was pretty stellar and is knowledgeableabout wines and pairing with food. The prices you can't beat! Overall I was really happy with the experience !
2017-02-19,5,I have lived in the area for five years and have tried just about every Italian restaurant in the area. Tonight I did dinner here with some friends based off of several recommendations and I am very happy I found this place. I had the burrata appetizer and the bolognese lasagna, both of which I highly recommend. Everyone at our table agreed that the food was so fresh and perfectly cooked. For dessert we had the Nutella pie which was out of this world. The service was excellent, its BYOB, and the owner and chef came to our table and introduced himself. It really doesn't get better than that. Will definitely be back.
2017-02-17,5,Great BYOB restaurant for any night of the week with great food in a nice setting. The pesto shrimp pasta and margarita pizza were great. Also don't rush you in and out which is nice, great new find in the neighborhood
2017-02-02,4,Delicious wood oven pizza.  5 adults and a toddler and we were all very nicely taken care of.  Great space, lots of windows, nice atmosphere albeit loud because of high ceiling.   Had 4 different pizzas and enjoyed them all.  Baby liked the meatballs, sauce was great.  Only 1 small issue.  Brought a nice Chianti and just felt wrong in the mini juice glasses they provide.  They need to get real wine glasses. Will definitelt go back.
2017-01-26,4,Great BYOB in the neighborhood.  Thin crust pizza was very tasty.  Fresh ingredients and nice ambiance.
2017-01-22,5,I could not be happier with Panello after hosting my daughters baptism reception there (30 people).  The staff and food exceeded expectations; staff walked around non-stop offering to make any pie on the menu or whatever one of my guests dreamed up.  The pizza was top-notch, especially liked the Diavolo Dolce (hot chilies, kale, honey), and Sopressata Piccante.  Parking around back was very helpful for out of town guests.
2017-01-17,5,This is a great BYOB in Hoboken. Excellent service and delicious homemade pastas. I was seated promptly with two people at 7 pm on Friday. We shared the caprese salad- wonderful! I had the rigatoni bolognese and it was also delicious. We shared tiramisu at the end- it is a small portion but very tasty. I will definitely return!
2017-01-15,3,I ended up coming back, and the service has improved greatly. The pizza was also better than remembered. The prices are still too high in my opinion, but glad to see the kinks have been worked out.
2017-01-12,5,Delicious thin crust pizza out of a REAL wood-fired oven! Hard to find those any more. Also lots of options for those not craving a pie (but who isn't?) Great food, friendly staff and BYOB Certainly coming back!
2017-01-08,1,One word: Disappointing.  Since I live right down the street, I have given Panello a few tries.. wanting it to be good.  And both times were mediocre at best.  The food is ok.  But the service on the other hand is horrendous.  The waitress we had was rushing us the entire time.  The place was pretty empty so there was no reason for it.  Is it that crazy that a couple may actually want to enjoy a nice dinner out on a Saturday night without being rushed in and out?  Also, when clearing our appetizer plates - please don't put my used and dirty silverware on the table.  Its gross.  Give your customers new/clean silverware for their entrees.   I hope the owners take these reviews into consideration to improve Panello because it is a good location.
2017-01-03,1,Save your money.  This place not woth trying. This place will be doomed.  Restaurants in Hoboken come and go and I will wait for this restrauant to go.  We ordered Capricciosa which was ice cold soggy pizza with very little toppings. The Spinich Gnocchi seemed stored bought.  Very Gummy with very little sauce.  I doubt it was 4 cheese.  Maybe they should take a few minutes to make homemade pasta instead.  It would not be diffucult.  Their Tiramasui was very tiny and not up to par.  The little rasberry sauce was actually good.  It was way overpriced for any quality or any value.  The other reviews must be fake.
2016-12-29,1,Customer service is terrible. We tried calling twice to place an order for pick up. The first time we called the guy told us they weren't ready to take orders. The second time we called the guy was so unbelievably rude and didn't even answer the phone with a proper greeting. When we asked for the total, he turned around and said he had no idea how much each item cost and he'd figure it out later. Needless to say we didn't complete our order. My advice? Hire staff who know how to properly communicate with other human beings. This is Hoboken, not Manhattan. For those prices, good service is expected. We took our business elsewhere.
2016-12-23,4,We usually head to Panello as it's super close to our apartment. The pizza is great, but I'm never fond of the service. I always feel rushed out the door and can never fully enjoy my meal. However, the pizza and BYOB will have me back!
2016-12-08,4,I went on a busy Saturday night and felt like I was being rushed. Four stars is four the food but I knocked one off for service. The waiter kept cursing and yelling at one of the other staff members but we kept thinking it was at us. They also put other people at our table which was fine - but they were on a date and I was just with my room mate so if anything it was probably more inconvenient for them. The waiter also never brought us bread and forgot to bring the couple we were basically on a double date with their water multiple times. We ordered pizza as an appetizer and it was good but very light and thin. Both of us ordered the gnocchi with four cheeses for dinner and it was AMAZING. Seriously great food in a quiet and pretty location and the interior is nice too. I would go back - maybe when they are less busy to have a better service experience.Oh and BYOB never hurts!
2016-11-12,4,BYOB! And it's twice doors down from a liquor store. We came in early on a Tuesday, just as they were opening. We got a flatbread and a salad. Both were generous, and they served us some very nice bread while we were waiting. The service was great, even as the tables started to fill around 6. We ended up splitting the creme brûlée  cheesecake, which was a great flavor although a slightly strange texture. It's a great space. I'd definitely come back if I'm wit a few friends in the neighborhood.
2016-11-10,3,Pizza is normal , nothing to special but very light which is good when you eat pizza! The restaurant is very nice , minimal modern , but the service horrible , some details negative.. like order a bottle of water..in every restaurant they open the battle and pour water into your glass.. well ..here no...The waitress take our order and during the dinner , ( 3 people) , 2 of us finish the pizza and I was still eating , they ask to us if we are ready for dessert , logically I said not now thanks, after 1 minutes they bring at the table the check! Ok.. total 22 minutes sit at the table ..the more fast "pizza" of my life ...
2016-11-09,5,The salad was amazing !! Try the coat cheese and beet salad. The pizza (Margarita) is exceptional !! Highly recommend .
2016-10-30,5,This is a hidden Hoboken gem!!!! A great byob with lots of options to please many eaters. We started off with the margarita pizza and white pizza with sausage. Very delicious but are small so perfect for sharing as an appetizer. All dinners were served together and came hot from the kitchen!! Loved the veggie lasagna it was a special on Friday night!!! Can't wait to come back.
2016-10-23,5,The pizza was good, but slightly overpriced (nothing crazy though) and the ravioli was great. The service was bad however. The place was completely packed on a Friday night and they only had 3 waiters. Between the time to get a seat, a waiter to give us menus, the waiter to take orders, and for food to come out, it was wayyyy too long. You could see the waiters were running around like mad men and working really hard, so this was def more on management for understaffing. Like I said the food was good but nothing unbelievable where it's worth putting up with the bad service.UPDATE: I've tried updating this in the past but it doesn't allow me for some reason. The owner reached out to personally apologize which I find extremely classy and caring. That move alone bumped my rating up to 5 stars, and will def be going back.
2016-10-16,4,This place is very nice. The food was great. Service was good too plus it's byob pizza, pasta, and environment was great. A little pricey for pizza but quality of the food was great very authentic. The place is very cozy and intimate.
2016-10-08,2,I mean it was OK... but too expensive for what it is...OK the pizza was good but too pricey....and there is better pizza in Hoboken guys... Gios/Bennys I mean come on... NAPOLIS!!Same with the appetizers... just Ehhh not impressed....MY CONCLUSION : Just not impressed enough for the price that is all....  Cute atmosphere though... extra points here. and a cool wine store next door with gourmet cheeses =)
2016-09-30,2,The food was always a delight when we dine in, but hasn't been so consistent lately when we order out. The fish was undercooked, and the roasted potato wedges were cold and seemed like they'd been out for quite some time. I choose not to dine in anymore since the usual waiter is very rude to us and extremely egotistical. Wish they were as good as when they first opened.
2016-09-10,5,My very Italian friend whose mother makes some of the best Italian food I've ever had in my life proclaimed that the spinach gnocchi with cheese sauce was the best potato gnocchi she's ever had. I nearly dropped my fork. My cacio e pepe with pancetta was equally delicious though the pasta was pretty sticky. The spaghetti stuck together in small clumps which is never ideal but it still tasted great. We were feeling bold and got the soppressata pizza as an appetizer. I had half the pie and was still hungry for my entree so I don't think these are "dinner" pizzas, if you know what I mean. It was delicious but the crust is so thin that it kinda lacked substance. If you're looking for a meal type of pizza you're better off at Napoli's or Johnny Peps. For dessert, our awesome waiter gave us a Nutella pizza on the house (it was a screw up from the kitchen) and it was soooo good, probably the best Nutella pizza I've had. This place is off the beaten path if you live in the busier parts of town, but it's worth the walk.
2016-08-31,3,Nothing special and, I would say, that it's slightly overpriced. Can't really compete with Benny Tudinos.
2016-08-13,5,Excellent food; great staff with lots of attention to service and very nice location and premise. Definitely going back.
2016-08-10,5,YUM!  Byob, great pizza, friendly staff, situated in the quieter part of Hoboken..what more could you ask for?!  My boyfriend and I had the Sopressata Piccante and our friends had the Finochiella .  Both were great but I especially enjoyed the Finochiella.  I will definitely be back to try out some more of their pizzas!
2016-08-07,5,First, the owner Iggy is such a gentleman. The interior is spot on with an impressive wood-fired oven and the food couldn't be more fresh. The best antipasti plate I've had in forever and the oven gave our steak a great crust. Every olive and other vegetable was house marinated and/or house grilled, fresh mozzarella, too.
2016-07-12,1,very solid food, very nice staffBut are you kidding $7 dollar for one bottle of sparkling water..Are we in NYC or on Monroe street in Hobokenpanellopizza.com/menu
2016-07-01,2,Let me start this by saying the pizza was delicious and it's fantastic that it's BYOB. I had a great time at this restaurant.However, for the prices, it's absolutely outrageous. I ordered a pesto pasta dish with shrimp that cost $18. It was a tiny bowl of pasta with 4 tiny pieces of shrimp that was laughable for a meal itself. It was good, but for the price, completely ridiculous. The pizza was tasty as well, but again for $18 next to NYC, you might as well get a huge pie from somewhere else because this pizza would be considered a small anywhere else you go. Overall it was good food, but extremely overpriced for what it was.
2016-07-01,5,Really great service. Nice kale salad. BYOB. Good prices. Pizza was good. 5 stars for the great vibe and welcoming atmosphere. Great addition to Hoboken.
2016-06-25,4,We come to Panello every other Saturday. Our usual order is pizza or pasta. The food there is decent, pizza is delicious. The only thing that doesn't coincide with my personal preferences is tomato sauce, I find it a bit too sour.
2016-06-25,2,Service was excellent, atmosphere very warm and inviting. Unfortunately the two pasta dishes we ordered lacked flavor, quantity, proper texture, and sauce-to-noodle ratio. If I were to price-point our meal it would only value at half of what they are charging. They might be using quality ingredients but certainly are not delivering quality meals.
2016-06-06,5,After having dinner here one night my husband and I decided it would be the perfect place for our son's Christening party. Before the party I was in contact with the owner Frieda who was most accommodating and helpful. We were able to drop off all of the wine, favors, and decorations the night before and upon arrival the restaurant looked beautiful! Our guests raved about the food as well as the service. They could not stop talking about the pizzas and caccio e Pepe. Overall a wonderful experience with the owners and service!
2016-05-30,3,I wanted to love Panello but it was just OK. I got a pasta dish and the portion was very small. My boyfriend had a pizza and that was also tiny. It is very very expensive for what you get. The food was pretty good but nothing special.It is BYOB which is always a plus. But since it's so expensive you end up spending the same amount as somewhere that isn't BYOB.
2016-05-21,3,Panello was a unique experience. The food was decent- but not great. We ordered the caprese salad and eggplant for appetizers. The eggplant was very tasty but the caprese salad lacked taste. I think a house made balsamic glaze would slightly make up for that. Main: pesto pizza was okay. Being that most rave about the pizza id rather eat at grimaldis on Washington Pastas- Rigatoni Bolognese- 7/10, ravioli-8/10, house special lasagna- it was good but not for 19$. Service: I called the day before to make a reservation for 8 and a highchair- that makes 9 people. I confirmed this with them twice. They still didn't get it right. And when I told them I needed a chair when I got there the waiter told me he doesn't do reservations. It was kind of rude. Just fix the problem. Would I come back? I don't think so. It was an overall 6.5/10 experience. If your feeling adventurous and something not on Washington Ave and don't mind spending some $$$ go for it. Something that would have made me want to come back: better service. I will spend the extra bucks for great service with good/okay food.
2016-05-15,5,Love this place for date night, love the atmosphere and their pizza is absolutely delicious. This place is small but love the vibe and staff is always nice. Goat cheese salad is a must along w their eggplant starter! Would highly recommend!
2016-05-07,4,came with a friend for a low key BYO dinner and was not let down. we ordered a bunch of stuff to share and I'm glad we did because everything was great
2016-04-26,4,Came here 30 mins before closing time, but they accommodated us and informed us to order ASAP as the kitchen was closing.  Made a quick decision to split a salad and pizza with my friend. The goat cheese and beet salad was absolutely delicious!!! They were very generous with the goat cheese and the flavor with the vinaigrette was impeccable! The Margherita pizza was delicious too but the crust was kinda burnt and could have been cooked more evenly.  They have a nice patio with some seating and its BYOB, so it would be a nice spot for a small group when the weather is nice.
2016-03-27,4,BYOB, so stopped at Hoboken Wine + Cheese next store for some wine. Really loved Panello. Went with a group of 4 on Saturday night and were seated right away (it was busy but not over-crowded).  We got the antipasto and mussels in white wine sauce to start. The antipasto plate was BEAUTIFUL and tasty. The two cheeses on the plate were delicious, along with 3 meats, olives, roasted red peppers, and artichokes. Quite filling because we couldn't stop eating it. Large portion of mussels, also tasty. For dinner we split the pesto pizza and 2 pasta dishes (Cacio y Pepe and Fusilli Bolognese). The pastas were amazing and perfect according to all 4 of us at the table. The pizza however was average at best (thus the 4 star rating). I can't wait to come back on a warm night and sit on the patio!
2016-03-17,5,The food was very homie. My friend and I loved everything about the service and food. The burrata, and meat lasagna are superb. Everyone was super nice. The chef even came out to talk to us. Highly recommend this place.
2016-03-12,1,Overpriced burnt pizza. We ordered a margherita and could taste nothing but the burnt dough. What we really ordered were cigarette ashes with cheese. Save your wallet, stomach and taste buds the pain.
2016-03-10,5,I went here for a friend's birthday dinner a few weeks ago. Unfortunately, trying to get into Hoboken on a Friday night (with an incompetent Uber driver, no less) left me and many of my friends about 45 minutes late for our reservation. Panello was more than accommodating to us! They made sure to hold our table, and seated people in our party as they arrived instead of waiting until the full party was there to seat us all. Because of this, I can't say enough wonderful things about the service at Panello! Importantly, the food was also incredible. We had meatballs, a pasta dish, and a couple different pizzas. Everything was absolutely delicious. Highly recommend!
2016-01-30,5,Wonderful service! Reservation was not ready for a few minutes, but we were given dessert on the house and was checked in on several times. Everything was delicious! We had the arugula salad ( enough to split) and meatball appetizer. Pasta entrees were just as amazing, authentic, homemade taste! Overall, casual atmosphere with great service and great food!
2015-12-27,1,A very below average experience.  First all, it is overpriced for the food, especially when you can just go to Dozzinos for better pizza at a cheaper price and a much better atmosphere.  The service was not very good, had to ask for water multiple times and our pizzas were luke warm.  Overall not worth it to go here.
2015-12-21,5,This place is the real deal. Outstanding food, service and atmosphere.  The pizzas are probably top 5 in all of NJ or NJ. Very artisanal and creative.  Other dishes like the meatballs, eggplant appetizer and more were also outstanding.  Desserts just as excellent. This is a hidden gem, off the beaten path in Hoboken.  I'm loathe to write such a review for fear I won't be able to get a table next time.
2015-12-04,4,Good food. Not great service. The waiters need to smile. Ravioli over the gnocchi.I will definitely be back to try more.
2015-11-28,5,This is the best Italian food in Hoboken. Pastas are great, the pizza is great too, and the staff is very attentive. Ordered the meatball appetizer and it was very good. It came in tomato sauce which I used to dip the bread in. Pasta I got the orecchiette broccoli grave and sausage which was superb. I highly recommend coming out to this far flung corner of Hoboken to try this place.
2015-11-20,2,1. Overpriced!2. Food quality way below average (ordered Orecchiette did not finish the meal, Ravioli terrible taste if you compare with really good ones)3. Great point here is that you can bring your own wine, because they do not charge for it, but there is no wine glasses at all. I find it really wierd to drink wine not from proper glasses.4. Service, looks like they are trying their best but it's doesn't mean its on high level.
2015-11-20,5,Have slowly made this our go to spot, awesome staff, cool atmosphere.. Nice mix between upscale and casual. Perfect for a big friends group or just Jess and I.Went to Dozzinos first, got turned away at the door ( not the only time this happened ) because they were "done seating." Came up to Panello and even though they were also closing we were welcomed with open arms, and told they could sneak us in but pizza orders only. Perfect! Even the waiter, Giuseppe, recognized us from months before and took extra care of us. Such a friendly environment. Guiseppe thanks for saving the evening! Cool single speed bike! Jeff n Jess
2015-11-13,5,Food was absolutely amazing! Ordered mussels for appetizer which were fantastic.  BYO so that's a plus.  Our waitress was very helpful and we were even treated to a great dessert.  You can't go wrong with any of the pasta dishes.  Definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a nice dinner out in Hoboken.
2015-10-27,5,This place is close to being in Naples to savor the best pizza and appetizers, not to mention awesome pasta dishes! The meatballs are the best I ever had! Being born in Southern Italy I would only eat my mother's or grandmother's and believe me, these are the closest to their meatballs I ever had! The eggplant appetizer and the antipasto for two accompanied by the delicious brick oven baked bread is really outstanding..Their pasta dishes are excellent, al dente and made fresh daily...It's a little slice of heaven right here in Hoboken...the atmosphere is great, and service is excellent.  A must!
2015-10-14,5,Excellent Margherita pizza! Nice crispy crust, will definitely be going back. Good service as well.
2015-10-11,5,This place just keeps getting better. Highly recommended. Really loved the salads, the pizza, the pastas. You really can't go wrong.
2015-10-09,4,Panello you have made me so happy! We had an outstanding meal here recently. When I reviewed them nine months ago they were merely a week old and doing a great job with their range of brick oven pizzas. Since then I've been back twice and here's an excellent example of a business that's actually listening to their customers. They listened and now have an expanded pasta and salad section as well.Each of their pastas are a lesson in Italian cooking. We had the Spinach gnocchi in pesto sauce and it has to be the best pasta I've had outside of Italy. The pesto sauce was rich, but not creamy, the texture of the pasta was just so perfect. And the ingredients so fresh that you could taste them in every bite. We also sampled the Diavolo Dolce (hot pizza) and it was so GOOD -- topped with calabrian chilies, olives, kale, drizzled honey, grated pecorino cheese and so much goodness! The crust was superbly crisp, charred in the right places...we couldn't stop eating it! To top it all, my friend and I shared the Tiramisu. Happy to report that this time round, the tiramisu was absolutely exquisite. It simply melted in our mouth and had the perfect combination of sweetness and hint of bitter coffee - faultless!  The portion size of the tiramisu has been reduced, but the consistency and taste has vastly improved - do try it.  Service at Panello has been a little erratic  last few times and wish they would resolve it... you will also be paying NYC prices in Hoboken, but the warmth of this restaurant and delicious food is worth it. Oh, and they are also Byob! #gohere
2015-10-01,5,As homemade as Nonna's Sunday meatballs and pasta.Some of the best, if not the best, artisan hand tossed brick oven pizza in all of Hoboken. Thin and crispy with fresh sauce and toppings. Even the focaccia bread they give to each table is amazing - because everything in a brick oven just tastes better!The perfect rustic date night spot. BYOB The perfect menu for two involves:Plate of Italian olives - (warms up the palate and gets the juices in your mouth flowing)Order of pizza - (thin and crispy just like we enjoy it)Either a special, which included homemade chicken pate with balsamic glazed onions and gherkin pickles on the side (and/or) an order of the homemade veal meatballs topped with cheese and sauce - (save some bread for dunking)An order of fresh Pasta - (just like La Salsa della Nonna)Your only regret will be that you can't try everything in one visit. But it's ok because this will easily become one of your new favorite spots in Hudson County. We skipped Dessert again but are keeping the Nutella pizza on our "To Eat" bucket list.
2015-09-26,3,Have gone back couple more times. Since it's getting more popular, the wait time could be long if you have a party larger than 2. The mussels were not impressive although I don't blame them since it's not a Belgium place. I realized that for their portion, they are not cheap eat so not sure $$ is accurate anymore.
2015-09-23,4,I just rented out the restaurant for my daughter's 3rd birthday this past Sunday, and it was a wonderful event. Frieda, the owner was a pleasure to deal with and beyond attentive from the beginning. The staff were on top of their game for the whole party, and the food speaks for itself from all the rave reviews. They accommodated many guest requests on the spot including gluten free eggplant appetizers and pizza without cheese for one who was lactose intolerant. Many people at our party said the pizza was the best they have ever had, and since the place is so rustic and beautiful my photos on Instagram and Facebook drew attention with people asking me about the restaurant. My only complaint (and I am sure everyone has at least one when planning a party) was that the cake slices were cut extremely thin. I had 39 guests in total and splurged on a cake that feeds 50-60 and a few people mentioned after the fact that they loved the cake and assumed the slices were so small because it wasn't big enough! Not sure why that happened, but perhaps I hold some responsibility in making sure the slices were appropriate?? Either way, it was a most memorable day (and their outside seating is quite special as well) and we will definitely be back for dinner. And....it's BYOB!
2015-09-04,5,We have been here four times and each visit gets better and better. The meatballs are the best we have EVER had. The pizza is delicious and the salads are incredibly fresh. The tiramisu is amazing and the staff is exceptional. The eggplant appetizer is exceptional. The best pizza and Italian on Hoboken, PERIOD.
2015-08-24,4,One of the best pizzas in town.Panello is one of several new storefronts in the reviving Monroe Center for the Arts.   The unfinished walls and rustic-industrial look work well in the location, although the dining room layout may need some adjusting. There are three picnic tables available for outdoor dining. It's a BYOB.The menu is modest, and I look forward to sampling more. Tonight was simple: margarita pizza and an arugula salad. The salad was easily large enough to share, fresh greens, lemony and zesty, a sprinkle of fresh parmesan, very good. The wood-fired pizza has it all: great crust with perfect char, a tangy sauce and cheese topping.  The pizza is delicious, it's a medium size good enough for a 'light' dinner for two.  Prices are a little NYC high, yet I will pay extra to support a local business that focuses on quality and fresh ingredients.
2015-08-18,2,I've been to Panello twice, and the service is pretty terrible. We actually had the same waiter on both visits.  He was a bit prickly, which didn't ruin our first time, but he was incredibly rude the second time. Like, to the point where I almost considered reducing a tip, which I've never done in my life.  I always tip 20% or more.  The food is average to below average, and its overpriced.  Ambiance is nice, but there's no reason to go here with so many other excellent options in town and nearby. $18 for lukewarm, oily cacio e pepe?  I can make it better at home :-(Waste of money.  Will never go back.
2015-08-14,3,A little pricey for the portion sizes and the flavor isn't all there. Went tonight with a fairly large party and didn't really feel the love from the employees. They have a weird carriage rule that implies they aren't that family friendly. It would be nice if the wait staff was a bit warmer. It's Italian, come on. I ordered Cacio e Pepe with pancetta. The dish came and it wasn't what I would expect from that dish. Heavy on the pepper, light on the salt and not as wet as it should have been. Also they forgot the pancetta. Honestly, just very sub par. I've been a few times and I have to say it is kind of hit or miss. Definitely wish they matched the portion sizes to the prices since the prices are pretty high for pizza and pasta.
2015-08-14,4,Terrific pizzas and gnocchi (which I am not a fan of, usually).Wonderful space, with a modern / rustic theme.The waiter could have been friendlier and the tiramisu was a disappointment.
2015-08-13,5,Hands down the best pizza in the area! Wonderful food, everything is fresh, delicious and the owners are truly delightful !!! A fantastic addition to the neighborhood!!!
2015-08-10,1,We tried to have dinner with six adults and one baby. Unfortunately they could not accommodate us with the stroller (baby is 4 months), even though the place was pretty empty on a Sunday night with ample seating and space for stroller. Guess they don't need the business. Since we were not able to taste their food, I can't comment about it.
2015-07-02,5,Absolutely fantastic. Only ordered 1 pizza but wow was it good. Easy to split with another person. The menu was great. A couple next to me ordered the mushroom, cartelized onion, and sausage pizza. That's what I will get when I go back next time.
2015-06-27,1,Last night was my second try at this place and unfortunately, my experience was no better, if not worse than my first. The food is over priced for Hoboken and the portions are way too small. I'm not a real big eater, but I left hungry and had to eat an hour later because I was starving. The atmosphere could be nice if the seating arrangements were better. If you're a couple, you are forced to sit with complete strangers. There are no tables for two which I find to be utterly ridiculous.The first time I went, we were four and I felt bad for the couple at our table who had to hear us talking about stuff that was of no interest to them. Last night we were two and had to sit at a table with four strangers and honestly, everyone was uncomfortable.I had the pizza last night and it was completely underwhelming and over priced. what amounted to a personal size pizza was really not worth the price at all and it was cooked just so so. Had meatballs and while they may have been ok, 9 bucks for three little meatballs just wasn't worth it. They weren't so special.So since they obviously want to cater to groups and the kindergarten brigade, I'm done with this place.
2015-06-19,4,I wish they were open later because on our second visit to experience their awesomeness, we got there too late. A tad pricey if you're not a drinker, but to me, saving on wine at a BYO makes up for paying a little more for the food. We had the gnocchi, tortellini and sopressata pie. Pizza was the best of the 3. These are more standard pasta sizes than the huge portions most places serve. I like my pasta cooked a bit more and with a heavy hand on the sauce. Could have used some extra. We ordered the gnocchi to compare it to the four cheese gnocchi from Leo's and it was no where close. But the atmosphere,  service and perfectly cooked pizza will keep us going back...just an hour earlier. Great addition to that part of town!
2015-06-14,5,Excellent. My wife and I have lived in Hoboken for 15 years and been to Italy more than a dozen times just in that time span (famiglia). There are some really good Italian places in town, but Panello was as close to our Roman experience as we've had in the States. Mind you, we only had a Margherita pizza and the Caccio e Peppe pasta (with pancetta of course) , but both of these dishes hit the mark. If you've been to Italy and are yearning for that authentic flavor, try this place out. Was NOT inexpensive, but we always judge price vs. quality, and from that perspective (and the fact that it's BYOB) it would seem that at least some of that cost goes towards better ingredients. We'll be heading back soon I'm sure, to try more from their not extensive, but quite enticing menu.
2015-06-12,5,Hands down the best gnocchi I've ever had! Also great place to BYOB. I would recommend reservations if you have a large group on the weekends, otherwise you should be fine!
2015-05-25,5,'m a total pizza snob and this is the best pizza I've ever had outside of Italy, maybe even in Italy.  Dozinos is okay, they have interesting toppings but the dough is way too thick and salty. Panello knows how to do a great crust.  Grimaldis and some of the other pizza places make you feel like you have a gut bomb afterwards, here you feel great , you must try it.
2015-05-18,5,This is a way better alternative to Dozzinos. The staff is super friendly and informative. The menu is great - I think I've had all of the pizzas now. The meatballs are awesome, the sauce tastes very homemade. They take reservations and I've been here with many big parties and couldn't have had a better time. I can't recommend this place enough.
2015-05-17,5,Wonderful pizza and a great space. We shared the Margherita with prosciutto and also the diavolo dolce. My wife is venetian, and she thought panella was better than most from her home town!
2015-05-01,4,My wife and I visited Panello for our second time last week. The first time out, we never actually had the opportunity to eat there. But we'll get to that later. We'd been wanting to try Panello for a very long time. And when we finally tasted the food, we were not disappointed. We started out with the beet and goat cheese salad. It looked an tasted amazing. Great presentation. Perfect appetizer. We followed that up with the Burrata cheese and gasped at the portion. It was huge! Lastly, we shared a meatball pizza. It was crisp, cooked to perfection. Delicious. The only thing that prevents us from giving Panello 5 stars was our first trip there. We arrived at 9:15 on a Friday night and were told they were no longer seating people. We couldn't believe that they wouldn't let us sit down 45 minutes before posted closing time. When we went back again this week, we asked our waiter about closing and he said we'd be seated any time before 10:00. So we'll just chalk up our first experience to one bad apple who wanted to go home early -- and we'll be going back to Panello again soon!
2015-04-30,5,I could write a lengthy review, but one word sums up Panello. EXCELLENT. From the warm welcome of the staff and owners, to the decor, and especially to the pizza. Without exaggerating it is the best pizza we have every had.  I'll say it again. EXCELLENT.
2015-04-30,4,Awesome decor and design. Yummy, thin crust type of pizza. Ordered the pesto pizza and verde bianco rosso. Wish there was a bit more substance on the pizza. Maybe needed more cheese or prosciutto. Had to fold it in half to feel like I was getting a good bite. Really good flavor that I wanted more of! Excited to go back!
2015-04-27,4,Enjoyed Panello last weekend. The food was very tasty.The kale salad was large enough to split for 2, and had a lot of great flavors. There were pieces of dried fruid, a nice vinaigrette, and pieces of apple on the side. I would imagine there is a better way to garnish a salad than by quartering an apple and placing it on the side of the plate, but whatever - tasted good.We got two pizzas - the margherita and a white pizza w/ mushrooms, artichoke, sopressata... very good, and the perfect size. For two people, the salad and two pizzas were just the right amount of food. You'll either finish it all (if you are starving), or have a few slices leftover for breakfast the next day.I will say that the layout/design of the restaurant wasn't my favorite. Very plain decor (which I don't necessarily dislike), but with large ceilings and fairly bright lighting, it looks more like there just wasn't a lot of thought put into it. As others have noted, they serve with paper napkins which is just not ideal when eating something with a lot of oil/flour (pizza) with your hands (pizza). A cloth napkin could stand the test of the meal much better!All said, I definitely will return. It was pretty much in line price wise with restaurants in Hoboken, and the BYOB is certainly a ++++ in terms of saving cash and convenience.
2015-04-11,5,Returned here for a second visit on Easter Sunday.  The place was not busy at all, probably because of the holiday.  In fact, the entire town seemed rather quiet when we drove in.  We actually found a parking spot in front of the restaurant - How often does that happen in Hoboken!Now for the food.  Our three salads were fresh and tasty.  We ordered three pizzas - two red, one white.  The crust was baked to perfection.  It was light, but with enough structure to hold up under the sauce and toppings, and had just the right amount of char.  The service was attentive without being intrusive.I'm at a loss trying to understand some of the other reviews.  I think part of the problem is thwarted expectations.  If you haven't figured it out by now, this is not a place to go to if you always order "extra cheese" on your pizza.  If you're a "slice" person, stay away - you'll be disappointed, and so will your kids.  Based on the presentation and somewhat limited menu, it would appear the owners place quality and attention to detail above quantity and familiarity.  There are limited toppings (no pepperoni or anchovies), and they're distributed lightly. Not that these things (or extra cheese) are bad; they're just not within the scope of what this place appears to be trying to achieve.  That works for me, but may not for you.
2015-04-08,2,We had dinner here with friends on a Friday night and we all enjoyed ourselves.Decor: The interior isn't huge, and it is set back in Hoboken, but it's a nice place. It's brand new, so of course it's clean, and the decor is consistent with the going trend that I like to call "quasi-hipster industrial." I liked it. The massive pizza oven also keeps it toasty warm (it was a spring evening) but I can imagine it getting very warm in there come summertime. There are plenty of tables and you don't feel cramped at all.Bathroom: Nice and clean, well lit but not bright.Staff: We were seated even though we didn't have our full party with us (which I'm a fan of) and our waiter was a really nice guy. The (who I assume is) owner, an aging woman, worked every pizza and she was earning her pay - standing in front of that oven was making her sweat bullets! But knowing that she was giving each pie some love somehow made it that much better.Food: It's BYOB so luckily our friends brought a bottle of wine. We started with a salad and meatballs (both enjoyable) and then went right to the pizzas: Marinara w/ prosciutto (good, but the prosciutto was basically laid on top of the pizza like an after-thought), the special Diavolo Dolce pizza (hot but sweet, it was enjoyable), and another pie that basically looked like peperoni pizza (akak looked delicious!). For dessert we had the Neutella pizza which was very tasty.Value: All-in-all the prices are just so-so. The pizza is just so-so and I think the prices could be just a bit lower. However, you won't break your wallet giving this place a try.We had an enjoyable meal, mostly due to the company rather than the food. But this place is fine if you're looking for something different and are a fan of "Hoboken-style pizza."
2015-03-21,2,55 dollars for 2 personal pizzas, a small salad and a coke. Grimaldi's is much better. Plus if you go at the wrong time the place turns into Romper Room.
2015-03-15,3,Adorable place--warm and inviting and rustic all wrapped up into one.Exposed brick walls partially painted off white, wood tables & metal chairs, wood fired pizza oven in plain view with sitting bar nearby.BYOB.We had pizza the day before so we decided to try some appetizers.1. Meatballs:  3 decent sized balls in tomato sauce with one small slice of focaccia.  They kindly offered us extra focaccia since we were sharing everything.  Lots of garlic and spices, not too salty, tomato sauce tasty but slightly, SLIGHTLY, on the watery side. Very good.2. Eggplant: Stuffed with bread crumbs and some other items we couldn't quite identify taste-wise.  Lots of garlic.  Served on a bed of mixed greens with light balsamic dressing.   Very good.3. Spinach tortellini in 4 cheese sauce with freshly grated parmesan cheese.  Sauce = excellent. Pasta = packaged.  I know the pasta was packaged because I used to work at a restaurant nearby and we used the same exact pasta. Same size, texture, taste, everything. Delicious, though I wish they made their pasta from scratch.The con here is the pricing. They're just too expensive.  The little plates are kind of, well, little, considering the price.  If they shaved off $2-$5 for each then it would be the perfect value.  And BTW- adding cloth napkins would be a great classy addition! A thin white cheap paper napkin that soaks up oil after one use and essentially becomes useless means I need about 3-4 napkins for my meal. Cloth is so easy and goes better with their theme.Again, we didn't order pizza but the prices were also pretty high--$13-$18.  Yikes!
2015-03-07,2,Let me start by saying that food is mostly above average and service is good. But that's not saying much for Hoboken. As most food establishments here have above average food and good service. The reasons for only 2 stars is1. It's overpriced for the quality and quantity you get. 15$ for some thin dough, a Lot of sauce and barely visible cheese (yes,  pizza).  9$ for 3 small Meatballs?  Seriously? Goat cheese and beets salad was good. But in no way even close to be worth 12$. There's no real imagination there,  just beets and goat cheese. 2. Meatballs are not very good.We really wanted to like the place, as there is a lot of hype around it lately . But at the end of the day you can get a lot more for your money in Hoboken.
2015-03-02,5,Best pizza of the entire area, not only of Hoboken!!! The tomate sauce was excellent, really Italian! Perfect! I loved! The only negative point is the restaurant is too noisy, but all Hoboken restaurants are! So not that different from the others!Really recommend and will come back!
2015-02-27,5,This was our second time to Panello and we will definitely be back for more. How can you go wrong with BYOB and artisanal pizza?The staff is friendly and courteous. We were seated right away and loved the decor. It's rustic and so warm by the oven. The atmosphere was very casual, perfect for a night out.We started with the Spiedini which was Fontina cheese wrapped in prosciutto. It was delicious. We then split the Capricciosa, which is fior di latte, marinated artichoke hearts, mushrooms, sopressata and pecorino romano. The crust was so thin it was perfect! We also got a cannoli for dessert that was so good!I would highly recommend Panello. We will be back for more!
2015-02-18,4,I live right across the street from the Monroe Center and was so excited for another restaurant to open. It's a cozy spot for a nice casual dinner. The brick oven pizza is great although pricey for the size. Pasta specials are excellent. The appetizers and salads are just ok. It's BYO which is nice too! Our waiter was really excellent, and the owners are always there, they're really sweet and care a lot about their patrons.
2015-02-16,5,I've been here 4-5 times already so I feel it's time for a review.  I might be a little biased because I live nearby and there is nothing better then delicious pizza right outside your door.All of the pizza's i've tried have been incredibly good - meatballs, pesto, etc. The mozzarella is made in-house and does not dissapoint.. mmmmThe salad's as well are all very fresh and flavorful.  I usually don't care for Italian restaurant salad but Panello does it right!Lastly, their tiramisu is excellent and I somehow end up ordering it every time I come.Don't come to Panello looking for American-Italian style Pizza with lots of cheese and toppings.  Come for Neapolitan brick oven with fresh toppings and perfectly cooked crust.  I can't comment on the pasta, but the pizza here is outstanding!It's BYOB so bring a nice bottle of wine and enjoy :-)
2015-01-23,4,This place is pretty fantastic. The food quality is very good for artisan style pies and specialty, home made pastas..and salads. The ambiance is a very clean new age style (stamped concrete and open venting). If you want a sloppy pizza pie from something like Tony Baloneys then dont come here.The price is right and the food output and staff are fantastic.BYOB makes it a no brainer. Cant go wrong giving it a try. Quality is tops.
2015-01-23,1,I have been waiting for the Monroe Center to explode since I lived in Hoboken 10 years ago...so I had high hopes for Panello. Just when I thought Dozzino was the worst pizza in town followed by the highest check I are here. Staff was not friendly, pizza was not good at all and not to mention who does not have pepperoni????  I don't know where all the other reviews ate but don't bother even if it's local. Please go to Johnny Pepperoni or Napolis or even Benny Tudinos!
2015-01-18,3,We really wanted to love this place, but whoa are they wayyyy overpriced. The $15 Margarita pie looks like something off of a kids menu. And the $16 Gnocchi is more like an appetizer. I will say, the ingredients are of quality and the girl taking the order was super friendly. But $34.00 and we'r still hungry? Sadly, this will be the last time we will order here.
2015-01-18,5,A very nice and cosy experience. Service is great, food is terrific. The pizza has a real Italian style, ingredients are fresh. Once they'll add a good list of Italian wine to their menu, it will be the best. So until then, BYOB!!!
2015-01-09,5,Gives Dozzinos a run for its money. Delicious pizzas and entres and finally some place good on the back end of Hoboken! Always great specials and the owners/chefs/wait staff are freindly and knowledgeable.
2015-01-02,4,Dined here on NYE. We walked in without a reservation for a party of 4 and were still kind enough to accommodate us. The Space is super rustic and warm, a really nice addition to this part of town which really lacks a decent assortment of restaurants. Ordered the Beet/Goat Cheese, Gnocchi and Burrata Appetizers. All of them were delicious, the Beet appetizer was presented almost like a pate which was kind of cool goat cheese layers between layers of beet yummy. The Pizza dough was fresh and yummy, We tried the Margherita, Marinara and the Sausage/Mushroom. My only suggestion would be to maybe make the toppings a bit more manageable to eat?? The caramelized onions were huge in size and made it a bit unpleasant to eat with the average sized pieces of sausage and mushroom. Other than that no complaints..service was fab as well !!!
2014-12-30,4,We had a great experience here! Definitely the best of the high-end pizza places in Hoboken (of which there are waaaay too many). We really enjoyed everything we ordered except the meatballs (they were a little dry, but maybe it was an off night). Burrata was excellent, eggplant appetizer was amazing, and the pizzas were got were so good, I didn't want to stop eating. We were told every single thing on the menu is house-made, from the bread to the pasta (they usually have one on special), to the cheese, which is why they keep the menu small. You can taste the difference.The only reason I dropped a star is because the restaurant is pretty humid between the ovens and the people inside, it's a little uncomfortable-but we got used to it. And they acknowledged the problem, which makes me think they're working to improve it. Wish i could give it 4.5Service was excellent and attentive. I'll definitely be back soon!
2014-12-17,4,Went here for late dinner on a Friday night. My boyfriend and I have a standard order when we try a new brick oven pizza place - Margherita pie, side of meatballs, and salad. The meatballs were amazing. And their red sauce is spot-on. We decided to skip the margherita because the special pie sounded so great - ricotta, fresh mozzarella, and pesto. No regrets! Both cheeses and the pesto tasted super fresh and homemade.. The crust was just how it should be. As for the dropped star, the arugula salad really left something to be desired. It wasn't dressed well and was just kind of boring (I expect at least a decent vinaigrette when everything else is that good). However, the table next to us had a really nice looking burrata salad, which I think was a special. Service was a bit slow (considering we were 1 of 4 tables dining), but that's to be expected for a new restaurant. Looking forward to going back for some more meatballs and maybe next time I'll satisfy my green fix with their broccoli rabe pie ;)
2014-12-09,3,A solid three. This neighborhood in Hoboken can get a little dead so it's really nice to see new restaurants opening up. The atmosphere is cute, but the seating situation is awkward. (No tables for couples or small groups, so you'll be sharing with strangers) the food is pretty good, but the pricing is way too high for what you get. For example, a small bowl of regular olives was $6! The eggplant app was tasty, but small to share with more than two people. White Pizza was good.
2014-12-06,5,Loving this new spot, cute and quaint perfect for a cold evening with the wood burning stove providing that extra warmth and cozy feeling. Food is great, been here twice and highly recommend the meatballs and any of the pizza's! Can't wait to go back and try the Nutella pizza!
2014-12-05,5,The BEST PIZZA IN HOBOKEN. PERIOD.  Not to mention the meatballs, burrata, and all of their specials...AWESOME. It's BYOB so go next door for a six pack or bottle and Hoboken Wine and Cheese. Go there. You will not be disappointed.
2014-12-04,4,Great new Italian spot in the uptown area! Don't forget the grab a bottle of wine from the wine and cheese store next door before you walk in as it's BYOB. Panellos has a lovely cozy feel and the food is great. I urge you to try the Smash, which is basically a salad for the non salad lover, and the Soppresata pizza because let's face it, who doesn't love Soppresata. Everything else on the menu sounds delightful and I can't wait to try more.
2014-11-17,4,Enjoyed the pizza and antipasto here. Service was friendly. I would agree with a previous review, however. The prices do seem to be a smidge higher than they should be. BYOB
2014-11-09,5,Great addition to the neighborhood.  I've been here a few times and everything has been delicious.  Since they've opened they've added more small plate dishes  to the menu which I would highly recommend the meatballs and eggplant appetizer. The pizzas are baked in wood burning oven with a crispy crust and the toppings are not overpowering. When we walked in we were quickly greeted and seated.  It's BYOB which I am so glad about.
2014-11-03,4,I would give this a 5 star review if it was based just on food alone.  Maybe I'm being a little unfair critiquing the service at a new restaurant, but it took entirely too long to get someone to come and greet us when we came in.  We had a table of six and it was a solid 15 minutes before anyone offered us water or offered to open our wine bottles.  Besides that, everything was awesome.The pizzas are a little small, but they were delicious.  I loved the sauce, it was so fresh and flavorful.  Between six of us, we ordered almost every pizza.  I would say the best were the sopresatta and the fennel sausage.  We got the meatball appetizer, the eggplant and the caprese.  All a bit undersized but delicious.BYO and a good crowd off the beaten path.  Would definitely recommend it to anyone.
2014-11-02,4,Saturday night pizza night was wonderful.   Great scene, awesome service and incredible pizza and salads.  One of our favs was the margarita pizza, the sauce and crust was oh so delicious.
2014-10-27,5,We had the meatball appetizer, a goat cheese/beet small plate, and pizzas. All I can say is that everything was delicious and perfect. We also met the owners, and they really care about every detail.Amazing place and we've already told all of our friends about it. I am resisting the urge to stop writing this review and head over there right now...it's that good.
2014-10-25,5,REALLY, REALLY, GOOD!!!!Went for dinner tonight, was absolutely delicious.  One of those meals where you can't stop eating, and one thing is better than the next.  Cross between Soho loft, and tuscan farmhouse, this BYOB cranked out fresh, homemade, pizzas, salads, and small plates.  The homemade bread is unbelievably good, as was the pizza and lightly dressed salad we had.  Even though it's brand new, the place was busy with a mix of couples, families, and hipsters.  Almost don't want to give away my new "fav"!
2014-10-17,5,I am the first customer and throwing out the 5 star. Could be the best pizza in hoboken. Freshest ingredients, friendly management, and beautiful space. Can't wait to try the italian menu. Good luck and Welcome!
