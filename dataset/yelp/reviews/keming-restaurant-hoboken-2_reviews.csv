2021-08-21,5,That's right, 5 stars. Came over from the city and had some of the tastiest wonton soup I can remember, with a milky broth and hint of Szechuan zing in the dumplings. Even the good old General Tso's is perfectly breaded and the sauce has a great kick. Feel like they didn't have to be this good - but who's complaining?
2021-08-17,4,Great take out order from here. Just moved to Hoboken and was looking for a good Chinese take out spot. This is close to our apartment and was great. A little pricy but I thought the food was pretty good. Nice service on the phone and quick free delivery (over $15). I'd order from here again.
2021-08-08,5,Not pictured soup dumplings and hot + sour soup. All for under $40. Food is authentic and fresh staff is the best, order this at least 1x a week. The BEST
2021-07-26,3,Decent food Over priced Fast food chinese is honestly a better option Fast service Nice staff But wouldnt go here again for chinese food again Hot pot is probably good?
2021-06-22,3,I rarely order Chinese food but I decided on takeout from Keming since so many local food bloggers posts pics from it.  After scrolling through yelp reviews, I decided on the soup dumplings, spicy wontons, sesame chicken and chicken in garlic sauce.  Ordered over the phone and pick-up was ready quickly in 15 minutes.  Everything was still hot when we brought it home.  Soup dumplings - okay; get 6 dumplings in an orderSpicy wontons - tasty and spicy; have a good kickSesame chicken - standard mealChicken in garlic sauce - tasty; also has a good amount of kick to it The food was good and traditional takeout portions.  I did have a little bit of sticker shock though when I got the check - the total order was $51.  I didn't remember Chinese takeout being that expensive.  For that price, I'd probably opt to order a different type of food.
2021-06-13,5,I had a really great time at Keming! We came by for dinner on a Sunday night and got a bunch of dishes (including cold sesame noodles, beef and onion, and cauliflower). The cauliflower was a bit salty, but otherwise all the dishes really hit the spot. The food came out very quickly and the service was wonderful.Keming also has nice outdoor seating, with ~2 tables right by the front on the sidewalk, and around ~4 tables on a wooden platform on the street.
2021-06-04,2,I was really excited to try this place and I'm sadly disappointed.  I'll start by saying that the people are nice, the food is quick and delivered hot/fresh. The not so great parts... I ordered vegetable lo main and they basically gave me lo main with lettuce. I'm not even kidding. What a poor substitute for cabbage and the other vegetables that one would expect in vegetable lo main. To be fair I've come across approx 3 carrot strands but still, that's nothing.The shrimp and broccoli I ordered came hot but the shrimp is so over cooked it's chewy and the flavor is gone.  The sauce is very light but I would've looked past that if they hadn't overcooked the shrimp. I won't be ordering from here again sadly.
2021-05-02,3,Ordered takeout and got the sesame chicken and soup dumplings. Soup dumplings were very good. Big and filled with lots of soup that didnt spill even with takeout. The sesame chicken was ok but the texture of the chicken was not good. It was really tough and stringy. Wouldnt recommend
2021-04-29,5,Take out from Keming has never let me down and the more times I order and more things I try, the more I love. I do have to say, they have INCREDIBLE soup dumplings. Like, some of the best that I've had. They are giant, actually are filled with soup and the broth is pretty delicious. Besides the incredible soup dumplings, I can vouch for everything else on the menu too. Some other favorites have to be the fried rice, chicken and broccoli and lo mein. All so delicious all giant portions. Pick up and delivery have always been quick. I definitely plan to stop in and eat in person one of these days. If you are looking for a great Chinese food spot in Hoboken (or just around Hoboken), I couldn't recommend Keming enough.
2021-04-24,3,Flavors are good and authentic.  However, one time the fried spare ribs were delivered undercooked.
2021-04-12,5,Very good vegetable soup. Amazing chicken onion dumplings, and good music. I would recommend.
2021-04-04,4,Decent place to get your Chinese food fix! The selection is pretty wide - They have more traditional Chinese dishes as well as some of the more Americanized ones. It seems that they even have Hotpot and Mala - would come back to try those!
2021-03-26,4,One of the most authentic Chinese menus in Hoboken! Been here for an afternoon dumpling snack and for dinner - recommend the pepper steak, fried rice, beef chow fun, mapo tufu just to name a few.
2021-03-20,4,I just recently started to go to this restaurant after walking past it many times. The impetus was they just reopened seating after closing (except for delivery) during the recently ended sEvere COVID restrictions Food is excellent and ample. The dishes are different from the typical Chines I've had, richer and more complex. Service is pleasant and fast, although there are occasional language difficulties. I rarely give 5 Stars which I reserve for a restaurant the truly 'Blow me Away'. But I am considering it for Keming if their quality food and service continue on subsequent visits.
2021-03-19,5,I had the veggie lo mien and pork soup dumplings. The lo main was delicious and affordable and super light on the grease more than other restaurants. I 1000% recommend the soup dumplings they were so good I love when they break open. I had it delivered via the restaurant and it said 25-35 minutes and was at my apartment in 20. Great service!
2021-03-17,5,Great spot for authentic Chinese food. Our favorites are the soup dumplings, dan dan noodles, and hunan beef.
2021-03-08,4,Keming's Lo Mein is some of the best I've ever had. Skip the flavorless Beef & Broccoli and go for the Sesame Chicken instead. We also really enjoyed the SauteÃÅed String Beans with Minced Pork, although for the lack of pork in our order, I felt this was pretty expensive for a container that was 95% green beans at $12.99. Fast delivery arrived 20 minutes ahead of the time we were quoted and the delivery person was very nice.
2021-01-18,5,Placed a pickup order for pork soup dumplings and pork + cabbage dumplings over the phone. ETA - 20mins. It was ready on time for pickup.I may have found a new spot for soup dumplings. The dumplings were larger than other places that serve them. So that's a bang for your buck. I also love that upon pickup, they were steaming - like fresh out the steamer, not the microwave steam lol. It has a good amount of broth inside and the meat was on point. The only downside for me was the dumpling itself. It was a bit thicker than I prefer it to be. However, I will keep it at 5 stars for the overall quality and service.
2020-12-29,5,By far the best Chinese food in Hoboken. Don't miss out on the scallion pancakes (they are a popular food item and can run out if you order late!) or the sesame chicken (skip the General Tsos and get this instead). Lo mein is also very good!
2020-12-25,5,We just finished our dinner and we are SO impressed! I am so glad i found this restaurant on Christmas evening. The food was incredible. We definitely found our new go-to Chinese restaurant in town!
2020-12-11,5,Incredible! Had dinner at their outdoor dining area the other night and it was incredible. Take out is great, but the service and food was even better in person! The dumplings are great, so is the lo mein and the best scallion pancake I've ever had!
2020-11-06,3,We ordered delivery from Keming--steamed dumplings, fried dumplings, and General Tso's chicken. They called us to let us know that they "did not have fried dumplings" that night, which struck me as very odd (don't you just fry the steamed dumplings?)... so we ended up with just steamed dumplings & General Tso's. The steamed dumplings & their sauce were both great, and we'd get them again. The General Tso's chicken tasted good, but was mostly breading with little chicken. I probably wouldn't order it again.
2020-10-28,5,Delicious! My family and I've been looking for an authentic Chinese food spot in Hoboken/Weehawken and thought this was excellent Szechuan cuisine. Will def be back
2020-10-26,5,Best soup dumplings I've ever had! I've loved everything I've ordered from here so far. The lo mein, pork soup dumps, beef dumps, general tsos chicken, hunan beef, beef with broccoli all are amazing! Way better than a lot of the other Chinese spots in town. Highly recommended.
2020-10-06,5,Soup dumplings!  They are always great.  They have a very cute outside patio. Love the lo mein and other standard Americanized dishes. The shredded chicken is also pretty awesome!  As a byo, it cannot be beat!
2020-09-28,5,After three years of living in Hoboken, I've finally found the best Chinese food in the area. The juicy pork buns are absolutely delicious!
2020-09-16,5,Have been TWICE this week it was so good! The servers are attentive and friendly and the food is mouth watering. We ordered the scallion pancakes, juicy pork dumplings, and the steamed shrimp dumplings and have only been craving them since. Will be back ASAP!!
2020-08-18,4,Keming reopened with a really cute outdoor patio for COVID. The menu has many options for vegetarians. Service was really great. The food was yummy (typical Chinese dishes) and just as we ordered. We were served free ice cream at the end because the restaurant was celebrating its reopening. Social distancing and masks. Thanks!
2020-07-29,3,Solid quick Chinese / Szechuan place in Hoboken. One of the better in town if not the best. Sesame chicken and Dan Dan Noodles were good, nothing outstanding. Definitely solid
2020-06-29,2,I and my husband enjoy authentic szechuan food in nyc often so we wanted to try this place out in Hoboken. They had this "classic style" page on the back of the menu (owner told us that that's the authentic szechuan food). Last time we ordered there, we ordered Boiled sliced beef szechuan style, mala casserole assorted, and peking style noodle) It was super disappointing. Mala flavor was almost like a watered down broth so it didn't taste that spicy at all and the portion size was surprisingly small. ($25.99) Boiled sliced beef szechuan style ($17.99) was very similar to the mala casserole. I wouldn't really go here for the authentic experience.
2020-06-18,1,Before I start, I have been to here couple of times and whenever i visited, I always got the fatty beef dry hotpot. Today I ordered the fatty beef hotpot as usual, but received a totally different thing. The beef is just regular beef, not the fatty beef, bok choy is missing, the dried tofu is reallllly dry, seems like they were in the fridge for months.. this is not satisfying at all.. I called the restaurant and the person says that ingredients have never changed except for the fatty beef, but after me telling him about bok choy and other ingredients, now he says the ingredients can change..i used to like their dry hotpot, but not anymore
2020-06-16,4,Food was ready on time and was handed safely with social distancing. I underestimated the size of my four orders because they packed the containers. Will be coming back hereI ordered:House fried rice - really recommend this ! So goodHunan chicken - juicy chicken and great crunch of veggies the spice was perfect Shrimp and broccoli - good ratio of both some of the shrimp was a bit overcooked mala assorted casserole - great flavor and was my family's favorite / however the Napa cabbage used was a bit old with black spots on them. Really the only reason we're giving 4 stars
2020-06-14,5,Fave soup dumpling + veggie dumpling spot! Never had a bad experience whether dining in or delivery. Sleeper in Hoboken for sure.
2020-06-01,2,I've tried this place a few times and it's been disappointing every time.  The food has been bland and dry, for example the chicken with broccoli was terrible and had no sauce on it.  The only good thing, and the only reason I'm not giving them 1 star, is the soup dumplings.  There's not only better Chinese food in Hoboken, but this place is by far the most expensive Chinese restaurant in Hoboken.  Even if they were priced the same as the rest it wouldn't be good, but considering their ridiculous pricing I'm done giving this place more chances.
2020-05-09,5,Best General Tso's in town!! Tried take out during quarantine when nothing else was open and was pleasantly surprised! This will be my new Chinese spot in Hoboken. Dumplings and Lo Mien were fantastic as well.
2020-04-17,5,Just finished an absolutely dynamite mala casserole, so incredibly satisfying, like everything else I've eaten here.  Meant to snap it but my wife and I just attacked it with gusto!!  Filled with at least ten healthy ingredients like Napa cabbage, tofu, wooden ear mushrooms, and lotus roots, plus fatty beef and spam and wiener sausages, it has the effect of a nourishing chicken soup.
2020-03-28,5,Don't know why I waited until a quarantine to try this place - best Chinese in Hoboken. Soup dumplings are on point.
2020-02-23,4,Many posters are complaining that the Wonton soup is flavorless. Its flavorless in every Chinese restaurant ... Its a boring soup. The Hot and Sour soup was great, best I've had in a long time.
2019-10-26,3,I had a craving for soup dumplings and I'm visiting in Jersey. My husband found this place on yelp and we ordered to pick up. Dumplings were good, but nothing special. I'm just grateful I was able to have some.  I would try themAgain.
2019-10-25,1,Situated on one of the main streets in Hoboken. Quaint and romantic restaurant, that being said, let's talk about the food.I didn't want to go to adventurous with the menu because this is my first time dining in this restaurant. be aware that parking is very difficult to find and if you park before 9 p.m. you do have to pay a meter parking rate. And we go back to the food. I ordered a small wonton soup and general Tao chicken which came with a small white rice. The wonton soup had a funny flavor to it. Not the broth, the broth was just okay. The wontons had a funny taste to them. I can't put my finger on it but it was not good. General chicken dish was awful. Chicken was hard and flavorless. just not a good experience at this restaurant and it's truly a shame because location is great and it is an adorable quaint little restaurant. That being said the food is awful.I will definitely not be back to this restaurant.
2019-10-02,4,There was a problem with my delivery order.  Not a big deal, it happens.  I called and the gentleman who answered the phone was helpful and resolved it for me for next time.  He handled it very professionally and with great customer service.  Will order again.
2019-08-09,5,Love this place, family run, very warm people, consistently good food and service.Recommend their cauliflower and the sechuan style fish
2019-07-14,5,Soup Dumplings!!!!! Enough said. If you add a little sriracha to the top of one, it is literally the perfect bite. We are probably good for an order per week.
2019-06-18,5,I came here with my dad, a high school friend, and his Chinese girlfriend (who did all the ordering for us). This place is pretty legit. FOOD: We ordered a couple different things, I only know the names of a couple: steamed soup buns (yum, I love these), twice cooked pork (yum), a potato dish. Everything we had was good though! Well flavored for sure. AMBIANCE: Reasonably small place, nothing too fancy. This place is kind of weird. They have M&M's characters painted on the wall. Not sure why. Another wall has more Chinese theme painting on it that seems a bit more appropriate.SERVICE: Was good. Waiter spoke both English and Chinese, which was helpful. No complaints!OVERALL: Pretty legit Schezewan food. Would definitely come back!
2019-06-06,5,Visited Keming while visiting NYC/Hoboken.  The soup dumplings were amazing.  The broth was to die for.  Comfortable, chill atmosphere. If we lived in Hoboken we'd be eating here at least once a week.  Very friendly staff.
2019-05-23,1,Really bad Chinese. Fortune cookie was the best part of the meal. Don't get the wonton. Also, don't get the chicken house style unless you want a plate of dried peppers and chilies.
2019-05-08,5,As a native, this is the best Chinese spot in Hoboken. Good quality food for great prices. HUGE XIAO LONG BAO! I personally like the thicker dumpling dough, and there is lots of soup. All their dishes have great flavor. My go-to dishes: XLB, garlic eggplant, scallion pancake, and spicy fish in garlic sauce. Also pleasant and easy restaurant atmosphere. Mellow and not too over-the-top. Comfortable for friends/families but also maybe suitable for dates. Highly recommend!!
2019-04-14,5,Got the steamed pork buns and assorted  casserole on the front of the menu. Both were great.
2019-04-12,5,Nice service and food, good place to bring friends too. Fast delivery, probably my favorite place in town
2019-04-12,5,Best Chinese food in town. They have good choices of appetizers,  and pretty authentic Szechuan food. This the right place if you looking for some real Chinese food.A place u must go!!!highly recommend!
2019-03-23,1,I really don't recommend this place, this is the first time I eat here and also the last time, the vegetable we ordered green bean , it's not such fresh like the other Chinese restaurant, and the pork we ordered it's even come with the fur on the pork skin, it really makes me feel nauseate, it's the worst restaurant I ever tried.
2019-02-10,5,Great lunch specials, but food here is so delicious and comforting. My family and I get the wonton soup, string beans with pork, chicken lo mein and crispy chicken. This is our go to Chinese place. We love it so much!
2019-02-06,1,Ordered a takeaway as a treat for me in my wife but it was so bad we ended up disappointed and eating cereal.  The food was simply disgusting.
2019-01-28,2,Overall Keming is a very disappointing restaurant.  Their food is very under seasoned and bland.  I appreciate that they are more than just a "Chinese" restaurant, but the food is very ok.  The specialty dishes are very oily and have very little meat.  Their dumplings are probably the highlight.  They are good and occasionally you can request soup dumplings.  I have ordered and ate there several times so I do have several experiences with them.  The people who work there are very nice and they have good service, but there are better options for that kind of food.
2019-01-18,5,Things to get here: scallion pancakes and soup dumplings!!! The soup dumplings were a bit thicker than I usually get, and they were so tasty and rich! The scallion pancake was absolutely incredible, do not skip! The staff was nice and attentive, and the restaurant was cute and calm. The fried rice was okay, not exceptional, but not bad. Overall good food! Note: they don't have hot pot on week days
2019-01-17,2,Since moving to Hoboken I've been trying all a variety of Chinese restaurants in hopes of finding "the one." Sadly, my search continues after ordering from Keming.I had high hopes after a friend recommended Keming, but what I found was mushy food that lacked in flavor. Further, the portioning was terrible. I ordered shrimp with broccoli which was essentially a full head of broccoli with only 4 shrimp. I should hope that was a mistake because only putting 4 shrimp in the meal feels ridiculous. I won't be ordering from Keming again. The search continues!
2019-01-13,5,After some time to allow the restaurant to grow and get comfortable, this has become my favorite Chinese restroom this side of the Hudson.  The food and seasoning are authentic and spot on.  The service is always friendly and homeyMy husband and I have been there more than a dozen times and most of the times the food has been really great.  A good tip (which occurs with a lot of restaurants) is that visit during down time, the quality and consistency tends to be better and more focused.Some of our favorites are the Dan Dan noodles, cold spicy chicken, soupy dumplings and pan fried pork intestines.  Other solid choices are the fried whole fish (has bones), mapo tofu, stir fried eggplant and pan fried green beans.
2018-12-19,4,Ke Ming - I was sad when the sushi shop closed down, but I'm loving that Ke Ming has been added to the Hoboken restaurant list.  Most notably because they offer soup dumplings (xiao long bao) - how I love soup dumplings!   While they aren't the best soup dumplings ever, they're still hearty, comforting soup dumplings, and their dumpling sauce is great too.    I also have to give them props for bringing Hot Pot to Hoboken - now I don't need to trek into the city and wait 1hr+ for a table at favor taste when the mood hits.  They also offer more authentic Szechuan dishes than the other Chinese food places around - flavoring and spices are spot on when you want that over American Chinese food (and if you're being adventurous to try offals).  I love how friendly the guy that's always there is (owner, I think?) and can't forget that it's also BYO.
2018-12-18,3,An ok Chinese restaurant with a few authentic Chinese dishes on the menu. The dishes however are not exactly as satisfying as I would expect compared to the same dishes I've had in China. The service is attentive. The food comes out relatively quick. The other menu items are tasty enough to pass as an option for eat in. The one negative I cannot understand is that they do NOT take AMEX cards which is ridiculous.
2018-10-12,5,Hands down the best Chinese food I've ever had. I come here almost every week and am always left full and satisfied. I can't believe how low some of the ratings are becouse I've had nothing but great experiences with the food here!
2018-09-15,1,The Chicken Lo Mein noodles were overcooked, gooey, soft and tasteless - I finished 3/4 of this only because I was hungry, the rest went into trash (not worthy of saving, at all); everything else in the dish (chicken, etc.) fell victim to the same bland, miscellaneous, nothingness flavor.The broth in the Wonton Soup (I swear) tasted. like. soapy. dishwater. I tried one spoonful of the broth and then managed to put down (somehow) one wonton (which tasted like an eyeball) I immediately threw both in the trash, relieved that I ordered the $2 portion.The only saving grace of this near $20 pickup order was a six-piece tiny juicy bun order (aka soup dumplings) they were good and worth every cent.
2018-08-05,1,Bought dinner from here tonight. I got the scallion pancakes and sesame chicken. The scallion pancakes were not cooked all the way. Half crunchy and half dough. Also very greasy. The sesame chicken was not good either. The meat was very tough and chewy. Also very fatty. It gave me a bit of a stomach ache after. The meal was not cheap either. I would not recommend or buy from here again.
2018-08-04,3,Redemption-  1 more star up. The garlic ribs grew on me as I now find delicious. The soup dumplings were good as well. Love to give a 4 star but the Kung pao chicken is soupy, not cooked correctly.
2018-07-08,5,Good value for your money. Loved the juicy pork buns and scallion pancakes, and the general tso's chicken had the perfect crispy texture and taste. The service was prompt and friendly. We sat outside on a nice summer day and had a great time!
2018-06-27,4,Staffs are friendly. We ordered three dishes  and a soup for two adults and two kids to share. It was the right amount. The 1st dish was green bean and chicken. They were very accommodating by adding black bean sauce. Taste great! The 2nd was my favorite, broccoli with beef. The beef portion was small but I appreciate they use good quality of beef. You can tell by some Chinese Restaurant using too much seasoning on the beef and it taste like sponge, but Keming using beef has the real texture and taste of beef. The 3rd dish, however, was pretty weak. It was curry chicken. There many way of cooking curry. They simply use the curry power and didn't cook it for a long time. There were too much potatoes in it and the chicken is bland tasting. Overall, we like this restaurant. And we will keep going back to try new dishes!!
2018-06-22,3,I've been here multiple times and is one of two go to Chinese joints in town. It is the only place with hot pot. They have a lot of the staple Cantonese fare walnut shrimp in mayo sauce. Same flavors as Chinatown but smaller portions and a little pricier. Nothing compares to Chinatown.
2018-06-12,5,Great meal.  Walking around Hoboken looking for eat in Chinese and stopped in.Wonton soup, 4 petite egg rolls and Young Chow fried rice hit the spot.  Reasonable cost for a really tasty meal.
2018-05-29,4,Best Chinese food in all of hoboken!! The soup dumplings are decent but everything else is amazing. Pricing is a little high but the price is worth it for the good eats!
2018-05-08,5,Ordered the general tso's white meat chicken with a side of hot oil. It was phenomenal. Was real white meat chicken, with a lot of flavor and a good crisp to it. The side of hot oil is key as they don't put a ton of sauce.
2018-04-27,5,My favorite restaurant in Hoboken. So friendly and so clean. Food is unbelievable. From the soup to the chicken to the beef it is just all incredible.
2018-04-08,3,The ambience was ok as well as the food was also ok. We had ordered fried dumplings, which was fine. Coming to entree lo mein which wasn't great. Not spicy at all , we asked them to make it spicy though. Another dish was Kung Pao Chicken, very oily, very less on spices and again not spicy at all. To make it spicy you just could add chilly sauce on it. Portions are good. But this place disappointed me. It had 4 stars on yelp so was certain to have good dinner but the food didn't tempt us. The sever also didn't know much about the menu.
2018-03-11,5,Ordered delivery and it definitely hit the spot. I love salty and spicy food, so the dan dan noodle and sauteÃÅed string bean with minced pork was amazing!
2018-03-04,2,I really wanted to like this place because there's no good Chinese spots in Hoboken and the reviews looked pretty solid. We ordered Dan Dan Noodles and Dumplings (soupy). The apps were solid and I thought we were off to a good start. The dan dan noodles I've had a bunch and the flavor was very interesting. For dinner we had Pad Thai and I had the Szechuan style broiled pork that was suppose to be so hot the waiter made several remarks as if to take extreme precaution (LOL). Both entrees were disappointing and my dish was far from spicy. The quality of the ingredients in both appeared to be lacking. We barely ate our entrees. Oh well - the hunt for good Chinese in Hoboken continues ...
2018-02-20,5,Good quality and good portion. A must go place if you like Chinese food. Very authentic!!!!!
2018-02-06,3,this is a new spot in hoboken and you know I have to try all the new spots! I ordered the pork dumplings, lo mein, and general tso's chicken. This is a solid order when checking out a new asian spot ANYWHERE.The dumplings were good but I would rate them a touch gummy. You know when dumplings sometimes overcook the starch gums up and that is what happened.The lo mein wasnt bad but not the best I have had honestly. The meat in the lo meon was very fatty which was not a good sign. Flavor was ok though.Now the star of the show... the general tso chicken... I liked the kick of spice it has and the texture was on point. The chicken flavor did not come through and so I would have to put it in the 3/5 star range.Overall, the delivery was quick and ordering easy but that is typical for any asian spot. The food was a 3 out of 5 star. Would I order again... yes... am I dying to order it again... no
2018-02-04,4,If you haven't had a Mala casserole from Keming, run, don't walk over and order one. It's not a flavor I have had in a long time, not in the US prior to this. Mala laterally means numb and spicy. We ordered the assorted one. It has chicken, beef, lotus roots, tofu sheets, various other things and spam yes Chinese spam in it. And then there is the Mala flavor. No words can do it justice. It's not saucy. It's a combination of chili spicy and Sichuan peppercorns which if you happen to taste one literally gives a temporary numbing sensation on your tongue. Such comfort food on a snowy winter night. The other dishes mini juicy buns etc are decent too.
2018-02-03,2,My casserole came out in a wooden salad bowl.  Half the food I see in Yelp pics are no longer on the menu.Food tasted good, although most of it was too salty and not szechuam spicy.What's up with the M&Ms busting out of the wall for decor?
2018-02-02,5,Only authentic Chinese place in Hoboken, and therefore also the best authentic Chinese place in Hoboken. It's pretty good. Xiao Long Bao, Peking style pork ribs, string bean with minced pork, Dan Dan noodles - all good. I think they make the authentic dishes better than the obligatory Americanized dishes..so order the actual Chinese dishes and not general tso's. And don't order pad Thai, it's a Chinese place - if you want pad Thai go to T Thai downtown.
2018-01-25,1,Not a fan of this place the are very cheap with the main ingredients and charge way too much for what you actually receive in return.
2018-01-25,1,so ordered a large shrimp fried rice for 10$.No sauce in the bag? Also 5 tiny shrimps for large order? complete ripoff.there was no shrimp to be found.Never again
2018-01-24,4,Consistently great food. The sauce they use in their meals tastes like it comes from the fountain of youth. The lunch specials here are all nicely priced, and the dinner options offer an excessive amount of food most of the time, all while being very good. Nothing here has given me stomach issues unlike every other Chinese restaurant in Hoboken since the food used here seems to be of a much higher quality. Service here is hit or miss as sometimes you are not given much attention except when your food is ready. The candies at the entrance are a nice touch and offer something different. I have tried many items here from the soups to the classic style casseroles and always found it to be better than any other Chinese restaurant in Hoboken by a great amount.
2018-01-20,5,Keming is hands down the best Chinese place in Hoboken. They offer a pretty extensive menu, from chinese American to traditional Chinese. We ordered the xiaolongbao (little steam porkbuns/soup dumplings), spicy wonton, sesame chicken, and the fatty pork Mala casserole. We really enjoyed the entire meal. The best dish was the fatty pork mala casserole. It's a traditional Chinese dish, dry spices with fatty pork and a bunch of veggies. The second best dish was the sesame chicken. Good chunks of chicken and not just fried breading like you would get elsewhere. The XLB and the spicy wonton were both really good as well, our one criticism is both the wrappers were too thick. The servers were nice, a little rough around the edges but overall great. We ordered a tea that they forgot about it until we were almost done, but in hindsight they probably did us a favor as we were able to finish everything we ordered and then use the tea as palate cleanser. The decoration was interesting but it's now something to be expected of authentic Asian restaurants. The wall by the door had m&ms painted on it and the opposite wall had a mural of traditional chinese men at a banquet. I got a good laugh from this. I'll definitely be back, also it's byob, what more could you ask for.
2018-01-17,3,The food is alright here, but I do not think I could consider this place a true Szechaun place as I've had better in Flushing. I had the string beans with salty/crispy meat bits & rice lunch special and majority of what I tasted was white pepper. The redeeming quality to the string beans was that it was crunchy and not mushy. The mapo tofu was not as spicy or flavorful as I hoped it would be, and the three-cups chicken lacked the soy sauce flavors I was expecting it to have, and was almost bland against my taste buds. The cool cucumber appetizer was good and what I expected it to taste like. This place has affordable lunch specials, and they are available on weekends as well, which is nice for the locals in the area.My opinions here are most definitely biased as I've had better in queens, NY. But for the Hoboken area this place is decent.
2018-01-15,4,The food was outstanding here. This place is underrated and has excellent authentic Asian cuisine. Though I did not order the hotpot, the dishes my family and I had were very good. There are definitely some less-than-best Asian restaurants in this town, yet this was very up to par.
2018-01-13,2,The quality of food here is average and not very consistent. Last time I went one dish was super salty.
2018-01-12,1,I went to this restaurant because I noticed they were new and I was excited to try them out. I ordered beef with peppers which was was not spicy on the menu. I explained to the man at the restaurant that I was unable to eat spicy food due to my stomach and he said, "Don't worry, it won't be spicy" When I brought the meal home I received spicy beef with peppers.It was so spicy I couldn't even eat it. I ordered pan fried wontons and they were deep fried wontons... which were also dry. They didn't even include sauce. I'm sure the food isn't horrible, but this experience left a bad taste in my mouth. I brought the food back and asked for a full refund which they did - However, I was looking forward to lunch not a refund and by that point, lunch was already over. You only have one chance to make a first impression. I will not try them again.
2018-01-09,4,My friend and I were trying to decide where to dine in the area, when I remembered that I had been meaning to try the recently opened Szechuan restaurant, Keming.  I had grown to love this spicy cuisine over the past few years and was thrilled to see that I could now get it easily in Hoboken.  Despite it being one of the coldest evenings of the winter so far, the restaurant was packed on that Friday evening.  We selected a table away from the door and sat down to menus that were mainly recognizable American Chinese offerings.  However, the back of the menu included "Classic Style"  Szechuan casseroles and other authentic dishes.  Plus, if you really looked closely at the main menu, you would find adventurous ingredients like preserved egg, tripe, rice cakes, and more - rare finds in the neighborhood.We decided to indulge in their spicy offerings by sharing the Thai Hot and Sour Soup and the Dan Dan Noodles in Spicy Sauce.  We were shocked to discover that the soup was served in such a large bowl that splitting it between us was almost enough for a full meal on its own!  The spicy, aromatic broth was a bright red exclamation mark of herbs that packed a kick.  The hearty soup contained chunky vegetables, such as cabbage and tomatoes.   The Dan Dan Noodles had the perfect texture and were served in just enough chili oil to cover the pasta, but could have actually used extra to make it even more robust.  Prior to seeing the large sizes of the starters, we had also decided to split the Chicken with Eggplant and Ma Po Tofu.  The poultry entree had several large pieces of tender chicken, though I would have loved more.  The Japanese eggplant had the perfect consistency without being too mushy.  The Ma Po Tofu was the only dish that I was "eh" on.  I thought it needed more spice and richness; it just seemed rather bland, and the pork could have had more seasoning.  I also wished that they would have offered brown rice, but we were informed that they only had white.Overall, the meal contained obviously quality ingredients, served in a neat presentation and at affordable rates.  Between the friendly owner, bring-your-own beverage capabilities, and the cozy dining room with the "Happy Everything" sign on the wall, Keming created a very homey atmosphere.  I cannot wait to go back for the tripe, hot pot, soup dumplings, and to try more authentic Szechuan plates.  This is truly a welcome addition to the often humdrum Hoboken culinary scene.
2018-01-05,5,Always have a great experience when dining in.  The food is fast and fresh.  The Dan Dan noodles, wonton in spicy sauce, and the Chicken with spicy green peppers are favorites.  Definitely, a must try place for Chinese that is set apart from the rest.
2018-01-02,1,This restaurant has to be the worst dining option in all of New Jersey. If I could give them half a star, I would. We asked if they had their hot pot, and were told that the wire was not long, and only one table could get hot pot. Just downright strange. We still decided to give the place a try and ordered their chicken lo mein, pork short ribs and pork buns. The pork buns were edible. The rest were horrendous! The lo mein (it takes talent to mess up lo mein) had half a bottle of oil and 5 strands of chicken. The pork short ribs had 3 mini morsels that could be chewed among the 10 oily pieces. All in all, the only edible part of the meal was the plain white rice. This restaurant is utter rubbish.
2018-01-01,5,I was extremely dissatisfied with the Chinese food in Hoboken until (and boy am I glad) I found Keming! I ordered from here three times this week-- don't judge me! The food is fantastic! You'd be silly to go anywhere else for Chinese food!
2017-12-31,4,Very similar to a nyc style take out highly recommend the soup (pork/dumplings ($6.95), wonton with spicy sauce ($5.95)and dan dan noodles ($8.95) for appetizers, love their casseroles ($25.95)and their beef noodle soup (Szechuan, Spicy green peppers & tendon ($12.95). They are open on holidays even on New Year's Eve and they have take out, they take cash or card, parking is available but could be tough to find Thursday- Saturday nights, good luck!
2017-12-31,5,One of our most favorite restaurants! Food is delicious, service depends on how busy they are but it's justifiable. Everything from their soups to main course hits the spot. Highly recommend it!
2017-12-30,4,If there are half stars I'd like to give them a 3.5. Yes they are one of the most authentic Chinese places in town, but somehow it missed hitting the spot for me. I've been here twice and done a take out once, maybe I haven't found the favorite dish yet. For what I can remember -Good - Sesame chicken, solid but a bit too crispy and the meat is not as soft to my liking. But still recommend as I know I'm critical for my Chinese food.Shredded pork with garlic sauce, I like it but a bit too much on the sweet side. Young chow fried rice - good, but again a bit too sweet. A bit disappointing -Ma la pot - this is a very popular Chinese dish and I had high hopes for it. Non authentic Chinese place wouldn't even have  this on the menu. But I think it's over priced for what you get. I was quite surprised for how small that dish was. There were a lot of potatoes to fill in the pot which was also cut too thick for flavor to seep through. The dried tofu is a bit too hard - needs to be cooked down more. The tofu puffs are good. I barely tasted the spice. Not sure if I should've ask them to make it extra spicy but I assumed "ma la" by default should be spicy enough. But in general I like it more than other Chinese restaurants in Hoboken so I will go back and recommend for a try if you haven't been.
2017-12-23,4,Easily the most authentic Chinese food in Hoboken (I lived in China for nearly 3 years, and my wife for nearly 7), which is probably part of the reason for most of the negative reviews.  This isn't the best place to go to if you want General Tso's or chicken and broccoli, but if you're looking for cumin lamb that tastes like it would in Xinjiang, or Sichuan food that's actually made with Sichuan peppercorns, this is the place for you.    The Sichuan selections are the highlight of the menu (the only place in Hoboken you'll find mapo tofu with actual flavor), and their beef noodle soup creates the interesting combination of street flavors of Taipei with Sichuan numbing pepper.  I give them 4 stars instead of 5 because they do have lesser quality in their "standard" American Chinese dishes - they're pretty much standard takeout quality.  So if you're looking for something to compete with Precious or Lo-Fatt Chow, this isn't the place; but if you're looking for authentic mainland flavors, it's the only place in Hoboken that's even trying.
2017-12-14,1,I've been there for three times. Pricey and the food I ordered was too spicy. In the mean time, the service was bad at all. The food was ready for a long time but the waiter didn't notice me. My time was wasted and they were lack of communication. You can see the customers were way less than other Chinese restaurants. Miss the previous Thai restaurant. Second worst Chinese restaurant in Hoboken.
2017-11-20,5,Easily the best Chinese food in Hoboken. Everything is made fresh when you order it, not overly fried or beaten to death like some other places.
2017-11-18,5,A neighborhood gem in Hoboken.  This is real authentic freshly made Chinese food, not the cheap greasy Americanized Panda Express type fast food.  Each time we come here, the restaurant is full of groups of Chinese and other Asian people enjoying huge spreads of delicious food which is a good sign.  The vegetable dishes are my favorite.  Portions are large and ingredients are fresh.  The tofu mushroom dish is a must.  It is full of big fresh juicy meaty mushrooms!   One order feeds me for two meals.  My husband loves the dumplings and wontons which taste freshly made, not frozen.  Decor is simple, casual and the restaurant and bathrooms are very clean.  Real hot sauce and soy sauce are available for the table in ceramic containers, not plastic packets. I believe this is a family run place because the staff takes pride in offering excellent service.
2017-11-10,1,This was not the greatest experience.  Maybe they are having an off night but the egg drop soup was flavorless and there was some sort of ingredient in the king pao chicken that coated my mouth with what tasted like 409 cleaner and burned when I drank water.  It was disgusting.  Never going back.
2017-10-29,1,If I could give this place a half star I would. I ordered (delivery service) General Tso's chicken, egg drop soup, and fried dumplings.  I specifically asked for brown rice and received white rice instead.  General Tso's chicken usually comes with broccoli and there was literally one piece of broccoli mixed in with the chicken.  The dumplings were the wrong ones and there were no noodles( for the soup) or fortune cookies in the order.  I've never ordered Chinese food without receiving noodles or fortune cookies until now.  The food was average at best and the portion small. The delivery driver took off as I was checking the order in the bag.   All I wanted was a decent Chinese food meal on a rainy Sunday and I'm extremely disappointed,  I'll never order from this establishment again.
2017-10-15,4,The wonton dumplings here are delicious ! I've dined at the restaurant itself only once, but this is my go to for ordering in when I crave Chinese. The food has always been consistently great. The delivery is quick and the portions are perfect.
2017-10-12,5,So glad they're here , everything we have tried has been on the money. The Soup dumplings are my favorite .
2017-10-11,3,Could have been four stars if the service wasn't so poor. It's the only seemingly legit Chinese place in Hoboken.Ordered the lil pork bun (or whatever they call the item on the menu). From the name, I expected an actual PORK BUN, like the steamed, white, soft puff kind. In actuality, it's a bamboo steamer with several soup dumplings- if they could be called soup dumplings. The pork is an offputting pink, and the soup isn't so much soup but rather the unwanted juices from the meat. Usually, XLB meat is well put together and obviously cooked. This isn't the usual XLB, I guess. Also, I'm not Chinese so maybe my opinion isn't even valid...Boyfriend got the general tso's chicken and it was really good. I couldn't stop myself from stealing from his plate. Crispy, the sauce was great.The thing is, when we entered, we didn't know what to do. No welcome, no 'please wait to be seated' or even 'sit anywhere.' When we ended up sitting, we didn't get a server for a while. Drink refills (on our waters) were so hard to come by since our server was all over the place; it seems like they need more hands on deck. Also an unusual catch: I tried to order four different things on their menu, and each time, our server told us they weren't serving that particular dish. Why... is... it... there...?
2017-10-11,4,Nice Szeuchuan place. The hosts and servers were nice and friendly. The food was awesome.Fried Rice - 4.85/5Soup Dumpling -  4.65/5Fish in Szechuan oil - 4.5/5Overall a good experience !
2017-10-08,3,Had to downgrade after the last two experiences here, particularly the meal tonight. Everything was pretty tasteless- particularly the chicken lo mein and egg drop soup. Chicken lo mein smelled heavily of garlic, but otherwise very bland with almost 0 chicken or veggies. On a prior order I tried the won ton soup, this was also very bland. Hoping it was just an off night with the kitchen!
2017-10-08,5,I've gotten food at Keming twice so far, one for hot pot and once for takeout. This place is a gem for their hot pot. You can't get hot pot anywhere else in the area. They give you a choice of soup base (we chose Tom Yum, wasn't too spicy), then you pick a variety of foods you'd like to add to the soup at your leisure. We had six people, and chose the lamb, beef, cabbage, mushrooms, potato, wide vermicelli noodles (go with the thin instead), the shanghai noodles (delic), and maybe one or two other things. It was a large amount of food and we were very full. Next time I'll swap the potato for the rice cakes. We also got a seafood casserole, which is the picture on the menu, and the "juicy pork dumplings," which are soup dumplings, which stacked up pretty well to Joes Shanghai in Chinatown, which has arguably the best in New York. Everything was delicious!!I also got take out beef chow fun, made extra spicy. The noodles were perfectly cooked and full of flavor. Less take out style, closer to something you'd find in a more authentic Chinatown restaurant. I'm highly impressed with Keming and will make it a regular stop in the future.
2017-10-08,5,The only good sit-down Chinese place in Hoboken! Soup dumplings are delicious and highly recommended. Many other great dishes as well. I'm sure you can find equal or better in Chinatown or by driving further away, but I'm thankful to finally have some good Chinese food in Hoboken.
2017-10-03,1,My friends and I walked in around 6pm, and the restaurant had only one customer there. Despite it being non-busy, the servers were just chit chatting and ignored us for a good five minutes. As soon as we asked for the menu, they got annoyed and rolled their eyes at us. Seriously? I would give 0 stars for service if possible.In addition to that, we had to constantly ask for refills of water. They never came by to ask how the food was or if we needed any refills on water. By the way, the food was maybe a 1 star. Not authentic/spicy enough. At the end of our meal, we wanted to order some dessert. However, the server told us they prioritize take outs instead of the customers within the restaurant, which seems supper odd.Also, they give you a hard time if you want to split the bill with friends (each paying with their own card).Worst experience ever.
2017-09-30,3,Food is authentic but portion is small. Lunch set may not be enough food for guys. In Manhattan you'd get a lot more food with an extra $1. But there's little competition in Hoboken for authentic Chinese food, so they get to set the price. Takeout service is efficient. I called to place the order and it was ready for me in 10 mins.
2017-09-02,1,* Pan Fried Pork Dumplings - pretty good (but don't put them in sealed container for delivery, because then they become Fried Steamed Dumplings)* Little Juicy Pork Bun - This is NOT a soup dumpling, so don't confuse it, as other reviewers said it is. It's wet pork and doesn't have an appealing flavor* Wonton Soup - Flavorless* Lo Mein - This was the worst dish of all. I literally can't eat it after a few bites of trying. It's a giant plate of over-roasted garlic (and I love garlic!). The noodles are just garnish. I literally had to throw it out.
2017-09-02,4,We tried the chicken and onion dumpling, chicken fried rice, and the shredded beef with green pepper. Everything was fresh and tasted delicious. It's a BYOB. They didn't have the hot pot available when we came so will try it the next time we are here.
2017-08-27,5,Pretty authentic Chinese food. Different from take outs. It's def a good place to hang out and have a good dinner. The food here is amazing, but needa wait for a bit.
2017-08-27,5,SiChuan style Chinese food in Hoboken. Taste good, though a little bit salty. Come here regularly
2017-08-23,5,This place is awesome! Great service, and even better food at a very reasonable price.We travel 40 minutes to come here and eat their sesame chicken, or their chicken and broccoli, or their crispy beef...the list is endless! With an extensive menu, we've only scratched the surface of all the food options. They also have a $7.95 lunch menu, so you can enjoy their food at any time.There's ample seating, and the ambience is nice. If you're looking for the crispiest piece of white meat sesame chicken, this is the place for you! Can't wait for our next dinner.
2017-08-22,5,Service was great. Incredibly attentive.I got the General Tso's chicken was SO good. Portion was a little small, but the meat quality was incredible. I'll definitely be coming back to try more options...
2017-08-09,5,We got take out, the food was great and the staff super friendly. As soon as I walked in the place it smelled great. Def our new spot for Chinese food!
2017-08-03,5,This is my favorite Sichuan restaurant!! The chef is an expert of spice!!!Recommendation from Sichuaner~
2017-08-01,4,Better than your run-of-the-mill Chinese food place.  I'm no expert on Chinese but this was solid.  Unfortunately they only had a very limited Thai selection, the menu said otherwise.  However what we go was all better than average.  Looking forward to trying some other dishes at this place.
2017-07-30,1,This is some of the most disappointing Chinese food I've ever had. We ordered for pick up yesterday and had to throw a lot of it out because it was so bland and eat leftovers instead. The wonton soup was in water rather than any sort of chicken broth. The Ma Pa Tofu wasn't very spicy and the sauce was thin watery and had no other flavor. We also ordered DanDan Noodles which was basically spaghetti with very little sauce. Everything had a strange aftertaste. We went there based on the other positive reviews, but frankly I could have had better Chinese food by picking up something frozen from Trader Joe's.
2017-07-19,4,Made my way here on Sunday evening for dinner with my cousin and was seated right away. We decided to move outside after we realized they didn't have AC :/ the service was quick and the food was hot and tasty. The pork bun soup dumplings were definitely the highlight. We also got the beef and broccoli which was delicious! The only disappointing dish was the dan dan noodles. I often order this fish as Szechuan restaurants and this particular one was only flavored with hot oil. Otherwise I enjoyed the meal and may return here
2017-07-15,4,The food here very delicious. I ordered a mala casseroles seafood one dish enough for two people. This is a Sichuan restaurant where make dumplings and noodles too. It is my first time here, so I will come back to try other dishes too.
2017-07-15,4,Visited Hoboken for the heck of it and Keming has some decent reviews. Really enjoyed the Sichuan spicy seafood casserole dish - ingredients very fresh. The other stuff we ordered was good too (also fresh ingredients) but the seafood casserole stood out.  In the future, we would just specifically ask for a heavier dose of the Sichuan spice.
2017-07-09,5,My wife loves hot pot so I was excited to bring her here.  If you want a different type of Chinese food come here and try hot pot.  The chicken teriyaki scallion pancakes are awesome.
2017-07-07,4,Great authentic Szechuan cuisine. You can tell their chef/s are legit and they use fresh ingredients. I tried a few items and all were exceptional and quite tasty. I look forward to trying s few other items fro their menu. Probably my fav Chinese restaurant in the area. If you're up for new spin on your fav Chinese food classics, give this place a try!
2017-07-01,4,Unexpectedly delicious. The chicken pad Thai however did come in a sweet & sour sauce so I would specify a peanut sauce the next time. But the food was yummy and it's BYOB!
2017-06-19,5,Amazing Food & Great Service! This is AUTHENTIC Chinese food. The real deal. Not your Americanize Chinese. Every dish was phenomenal. Such unique and incredibly tasty flavors! The four of simply raved over every bite. Highly recommend the dumplings steamed or fried were excellent, the casseroles, even the Thai they included on the menu since this was a Thai food location is really well done.  The service is kind courteous and takes great care. You won't be disappointed!!! Cannot recommend it enough! Seriously I have had Chinese food all over the world and even have a close friend from Hong Kong who has taught me some dishes and has cooked for me many times and this is some of the best Chinese I have ever had. Leave you expectations of American Chinese food behind and you will be delighted!
2017-06-19,5,Amazing is the  assorted casserole. We were four and it was enough with a couple of  Appetizers. Very unusual.great sauce and not your main stream heavy American greasy Chinese.Delicate and unusual fresh flavours.We have also tried the hot pot and the Szechuan beef. Thumbs up for all.
2017-06-14,5,Accidentally went in for dinner with our daughter and husband and granddaughter. What a pleasant surprise, food was excellent, authentic, delicious, service was informative and prompt. Loved it. Will go back.
2017-06-12,1,tried repeatedly to call and order.  no answer.  then decided to walk over and order in person.  sadly, even though yelp says they are open, they are not.  even their menu says they are open 7 days a week.  nope.  disappointed after the good reviews.
2017-06-10,5,I'm Chinese and this place is legit Chinese food. I prefer Cantonese style but they have great food here for other Chinese cuisine. Start you meal with the dumplings especially the XLB soup dumplings. The fried rice is great and lots of spicy dish options. The best vegetable side dish in the town: sauteÃÅed green beans with the minced pork. Tender soft green beans and the salty minced pork go great with white rice or anything. I am a meat eater and this dish is my favorite.
2017-06-04,4,Kind of a strangely decorated place, with inspirational decor, an m&m wall painting and blue ceiling recessed lighting.  Also empty on a Sunday night.  A large family ate in the back, so they can accomodate large groups.  It doesn't seem like they have two person tables.  Weirdly enough, I think they have wifi.  We ordered the pork pan fried wontons, and were told that they're actually deep fried which was fine.  We had originally wanted the pork pan fried dumplings but they said they were out.  We also ordered the famed little juicy pork buns (aka xiao long bao) and both were yummy.  The pan fried dumplings came out hot on a plate with a sweet and sour sauce, and the soup dumplings came out in a covered bamboo steamer.  We had to ask for the soup spoons for the dumplings, which was no big deal. They were pretty goox-- a little doughy but not a huge deal when you soak them in the soupy insides and a bit of vinegar. They also accomodated our requests for extra rice (yay) since we ordered an entree to share (peking style pork rib) which had a lot of bones, a lot of fat, but was pretty tasty with it's hoisin and five spice sauce.So while the place is a teeny bit tacky, the food is good.
2017-06-01,4,Quite good Chinese place in Hoboken. The Xiaolongbao (called "Little Juicy Pork Bun" on the menu) is as good as any I've had in the US. Skin was a bit thick and would have liked more soup in the dumpling, but again very good. Lo Mein was solid and Pork Belly was absolutely excellent.  It's also BYO and there's a liquor store immediately next door, so very convenient.
2017-05-24,4,My friend recommended this restaurant to me. Environment of this restarrant is not bad. Price is reasonable, but food is not as impressive as i imaged. Some of the food is too salty, but the others are delicious. Overall, this is a good restaurant!
2017-05-15,3,We were super excited to try this place based on all the great reviews,  but quite frankly we were disappointed with the food.  Had the egg rolls,  chicken/mushroom dumplings to start whixh were both great.  The vegetable lo mein was tasty. We ordered the Kung Pao chicken and Lamb with cumin and they were both tasteless, and so so bland.  For a schezuan restaurant, we were expecting flavour and spice.
2017-05-14,5,As a Taiwanese-american in Hoboken, I struggle with finding authentic Taiwanese/Chinese food in the area. Most of the time, I drive up to Fort Lee to get my asian food fix, but today my Dad recommended going to Keming with him for lunch. Man... it was so good! We ordered the xiaolongbao (soup dumplings) and they were quite delicious. I doubt there is any other restaurant in Hoboken that will serve these things, let alone well. My dad and I are also avid lovers of spicy food and ordered the beef noodle soup and 2 more Szechuan dishes that were equally as yummy and very authentic. Next time I'm craving Chinese food I'll definitely know where to go!
2017-05-07,5,Excellent service, tasty Asian cuisine and very fair prices. I will definitely be revisiting
2017-04-24,5,Best Chinese food in Hoboken without a doubt.  I've tried all the other spots, and they're all Chinese-American fusion - nothing really authentic about them.  This spot is the closest to legit Chinese food in the area.I got delivery while at work and ordered the following:Beef Stew Noodle Soup was better than many I've tried in NYC.Soup dumplings were average at best, but the only place in Hoboken that offers them (also getting them delivered instead of fresh out the steam pot doesn't help)Cold Chicken w/ Spicy Sauce was authentic.Going to be ordering from here for Chinese going forward.EDIT: New favorites at Keming:Double Cooked PorkBoiled Sliced Fish Szechuan StyleBraised Beef Tendons Hot Pot(disclaimer: all spicy dishes for you non-spice eaters)
2017-04-22,5,Great new addition to uptown Hoboken. They have soup dumplings which they call "juicy pork buns" on the menu. Almost up to par with Dumpling man in the city, but as this is in walking distance from my apartment I'll take it over the hike to NYC any day of the week. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. Food is fresh. Can't wait to come back on a cooler day to try one of the hot pots.Also BYOB, which, as always, is a plus in my book (especially with a liquor store next door).
2017-04-20,5,Some Chinese expat friends took us here and raved about the food.  In particular, they recommended a lamb curry and spicy fish stew.  The lo mein and Chinese broccoli dishes were delicious as well.  Decent ethnic food is hard to find in Hoboken. This is a much welcome addition to the food scene in town.
2017-04-14,5,This is my favorite Chinese Szechuan in Hoboken. I got introduced to this place through a friend. On a sunny day, we went to this place with our baby. It turned out to be a great experience. We are really happy with the food and service. They are children friendly. They helped turn off the TV for our little baby who is not supposed to watch TV. We ordered chicken with spicy sauce which is a cold dish I like, very fresh; cumin lamb adding spicy (yea we love Szechuan food ); and soup dumplings. They also have Chinese herbal tea in cans, which is supposed to bring down the inner heat after the spicy or hot weather. (This part is very Chinese I know). Anyway, great place, will recommend, will go back.
2017-04-10,5,I have a store opened 3 years ago, i know how important the yelp review is for a new grand openning, totally understand how hard and how they need improvements, which always happened at setup period. so i feel bad to see a not nice review for them at beginning. from my visit today, i just feel very cozy and nice here, and taste chinese type like homemade. we fly from LA and visiting here, it is really hard to find good place to eat as hard for parking in NY or NJ. but lucky i finally made my best choice here. try them if you want REAL chinese food.
2017-04-10,1,Food overall is great.However, I have no idea what is going on at this place. Second Monday in a row that I tried to place an order for pick up. No one answers and it is 12:30pm when they advertise "Open 7 Days a Week" Mon- Sat.: 11:00am - 11:00pm Sun.: 12:00pm - 10:30pm. I finally got an answer today and they said sorry they are not open right now. WHAT!? There's no way this place is going to be successful in Hoboken if they are not open during lunch time. Not sure if this place is just trying to get everything together or what but this is so disappointing to a repeat customer.Also one time we got the lunch special on the weekend. The second time we came in to eat they said no lunch special on the weekend (also doesn't specify one way or the other on the menu). So I honestly think they make up the rules as they go.
2017-04-07,3,For a 9 o'clock on a Thursday, there were still a good few tables dining. We ordered the soup dumplings and the beef lomein. The soup dumplings taste slightly better than the frozen ones you would buy at a Chinese supermarket. The lomein is also a level better than one you'd order from a typical takeout place. I would say Keming is a good option if you want Chinese, but don't want takeout. It seems pretty authentic for the area. Plus they have a Szechuan hot pot, which I'll be back to try! Tip - BYOB! There's a liquor store right next door (but it's a bit pricy)
2017-03-25,5,Inspired to write my first Yelp review in 7 years after eating here last night!It's been a while since I've had Thai food but this place was delicious! Everything was very fresh and light! The sauces weren't heavy or overwhelming.We got 2 orders of the fatty pork buns, DELICIOUS! And chicken pad Thai was yummy, perfect amount of spice.The restaurant is new so maybe they are working out a few kinks in terms of the pace of the service so be patient, but they were so nice and food was delicious!
2017-03-23,2,Needs some work if they're going to stay open in this town. Out of a lot and was either too spicy or too bland. They were nice though :/
2017-03-19,1,Came on a Sunday night to dine in, 2 people. Both glasses on the table were dirty. Received two replacements which were also dirty. One person waiting on all of the tables. Water was given which was luke warm at best. Took 30 min to receive the appetizers (1 egg drop soup and 1 Juicy Pork Bun order, which are dumplings, not the traditional pork bun you'd be thinking of.) After the apps it took at least another 25 min to receive the entrees (Chicken with broccoli and General Tso's chicken.) Food was not good (how can you mess these two dishes up) and not worth the ridiculous wait and excruciating service for such a simple order (wish I would have listened to the other low reviews first but this place is def rated too high.)  Sincerely disappointed. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere  :(
2017-03-18,4,It appears that this place is frequented as a sit-down destination by those in the know. Also, when you do see diners inside during early evenings or at lunch, many are Chinese - which is something you might see in New York counterparts, but rarely in any of Hoboken's existing Chinese restaurants.Here are some other items worth trying. For an appetizer, try the shredded beef/pork/chicken w spicy green peppers burrito. They call it a burrito, but that's more of a best guess translation. Its really a pan fried scallion "pancake" wrapped around a delicious mixture of meat and spicy green peppers. As with many of the spicy dishes there, "spicy" is a relative term and more mild than spicy. This appetizer can serve 2, but can be shared among 4 if each takes a portion.  For entrees, try these with white rice: dry sauteed spring beans with minced pork, dry fried shredded beef.  Different, but tasty and worth trying. For more tips, check out my earlier review below.Sometimes, there is only one server, but any wait is worth it. The retail rents are so high in this town that it probably eats a lot of their margin, especially for a place without a liquor license.
2017-03-14,4,They are a relatively new restaurant in town and took over a thai place. Best chinese food in Hoboken.  Food is fresh and not greasy at all which you expect from takeout usually.  I work late hours and even up to 11pm they deliver quality.  Definitely my goto chinese spot in the Boke
2017-03-14,5,Came here last night after my friends recommended it.  For as many restaurants Hoboken has to offer, I can't seem to find a good spot to get chinese food.  This will be my new go-to.I wasn't brave enough to try one of the hot pots, but most of the people around us were ordering them.  We started with the pan fried wontons and dumplings.  The wontons were amazing; I wasn't a big fan of the dumplings but I think that's just a personal preference.  We both went with our typical order of General Tso's chicken which came with white rice.  This was different than your typical fried greasiness that you usually get from chinese takeout restaurants.  The meat in the chicken was all white and tasty.  My boyfriend didn't think it was spicy enough but now we know for next time to ask them to make his spicier.  The service was a little slow, as there was only one server for the entire restaurant but it's BYOB so we used the extra time to finish our wine.  It was very quiet inside but cutely decorated.  It's a step above your typical chinese restaurant.  Would definitely recommend to dine in.
2017-03-14,3,The food is good. You won't find this kind of food anywhere else in Hobo and it's BYOB. I docked 2 stars because the service is excruciating. They need to hire more staff. Service is very very slow because the times I've been there, there is only 1 person working the front of the house and trying to do EVERYTHING. Pls get more staff and I would come back.
2017-03-12,5,Went for hot pot lunch today and it was good. We didn't order from regular menu other than the fried pork bun so I have to come back. Service was good!
2017-03-08,4,I got dinner takeout from here one night. I believe this is the first Sichuan restaurant in Hoboken. It's a little farther north from where I am, but I'm certainly happy to see the extra diversity in this town. I don't know how often I'll order from here, but certainly an option.
2017-03-08,5,Love it. Simply love it. I was casually perusing Yelp looking for soup initially as it was a cold, rainy day in Hoboken and I wasn't in the mood to cook. What caught my attention was that they offered Xiao long bao (soup dumplings, $5.95 for six I think. They have it listed as "Little Juicy Pork Bun") and I was sold! I was also intrigued with the Mala casserole (Fatty beef, $25.95) due to watching too much Food Ranger on YouTube. When I got there around 11:30 AM, there were only about two group of people and plenty of room. I was accommodated and seated immediately. I know, I ate like a starving little piggy but I justified it by telling myself that I don't come and visit very often and I can take leftovers home and eat them for dinner....which I did because that Mala Fatty Beef Casserole was HUGE. It was a mixture of fatty beef (better than it sounds, I promise), napa cabbage, lotus roots, tripe, wood ear mushrooms (I think) and some sort of jelly-like item that I frankly couldn't identify but ate anyway. The vegetables were still crisp and fresh, just how I enjoy them. The beef was excellent in portion. The price is steep but it can feed two people....one me over two meals. The Xiao Long Bao.....best I've ever had in terms of taste. Better than Joe's Shanghai in NYC and Din Tai Fung in LA. IN MY OPINION so don't skewer me. The dumpling dough was on the thick side and wasn't folded correctly on some as on a couple of my dumplings, the dough tore and the soup ran out but the flavor of the soup and meatball was EXCELLENT. If I didn't have the mala casserole, I might have ordered two more Xiao long bao as a full meal. Definitely coming back the next time I'm in Hoboken.
2017-03-07,1,Their shrimp with vermicelli Malta casseroles ONLY contain shrimp and vermicelli!!! I have no idea why it is called Mala Casseroles if it only contain two item. The most ridiculous thing is it's priced 23.95 before tax for this one dish. I feel like I'm an idiot.
2017-03-04,4,I really love the food here. It's fantastic. I'm excited to have a spot for hot pot and soup dumplings in Hoboken. It would be great to see some service improvements to make though. Small changes could help like keeping carafes of water and menus on the table.
2017-02-26,5,Dare I say that this is the first authentic Chinese (Sichuan) restaurant in Hoboken?! They serve both Americanized Chinese food (sesame chicken, beef & broccoli, and so on) as well as Sichuan cuisine. Today was my first time here and I got the mala (mala means numbing hot) casserole with tofu sheet jelly. The cumin gave it a nice kick, but it was not unbearably spicy. My husband liked the dish and he is generally very weary of spice. He also got the xiao long bao, which he also liked a lot. I will definitely be coming back to try the Sichuan style fish & other casseroles. I'm so glad I don't have to travel to Chinatown the next time I'm craving spicy Chinese food!
2017-02-22,4,Is it politically incorrect to point out that this is the only Chinese restaurant in town frequented by the area's Chinese population?  We've been here several times.  Each time the food has been excellent.  On two occasions the service was excellent.  On the third I believe they were short-staffed in both the kitchen and on the floor.  Like some other reviewers, I recommend sticking to the "Classic Style" section of the menu as much as possible for authentic Sichuan.  The more standard Chinese restaurant fare is also quite good.
2017-02-14,1,Was really looking forward to trying this place based on all the great review here on yelp.Waited a good 10 min, no one greeted us; no host, one waiter was taking care of everything. Dirty dishes on the table and no one cleaned them up; phone kept ringing and no one answered.  We walked out of the door. Not a good experience at all.
2017-02-14,3,So overall the food is fairly tasty and I would recommend checking it out.  The fried dumplings are especially good.  But my reasons for the review and only 3 stars are   1) They don't offer or even have in their restaurant spicy Chinese mustard.  I love this stuff especially with egg rolls.   I found this very unusual.    2) Most importantly - NEVER ORDER THE WONTON SOUP.   It's really bland.  You get exactly 3 wontons in a white-ish broth and NOTHING ELSE.  No scallions, shredded pork or even crispy noodles.
2017-02-12,5,Excellent authentic Sichuan food! Mapo tofu and dry sauteÃÅed string beans were delicious.
2017-02-11,3,Placed an order for pick up on a Saturday night--- we wanted to get it delivered but for some reason they weren't offering their delivery service?We ordered: pork fried dumplings, soup dumplings, a wonton soup and the pad Thai with chicken. Wins:  the pork fried dumplings were delicious! And the pad Thai was good but I would have preferred it to be more peanut based. Also the pad Thai had a little kick to it which was fine but not sure if it's for everyone. The wonton soup didn't have much flavor and my husband was pretty disappointed. The soup dumplings were pretty good....but there's potential to improve the flavor. All in all I would come back here for those pork fried dumplings  yum!
2017-02-06,5,So good. So satisfied!The "boiled pork" sounded unappetizing but was fantastic! tender pork and some napa cabbage in a delicious broth...i could drink the liquid (and my brother-ion-law DID!) You might want to order extra rice so you can spoon the broth over it.Dumplings were yummy...steamed chicken and onion and the fried pork. We will definitely order again.
2017-02-04,4,My husband and I are so happy we finally found a respectable Chinese restaurant with fresh ingredients and authentic flavors.  Before Keming, I would only do Chinese in Chinatown NY but now that this is in town, it's my new go-to!
2017-02-03,4,I've been here on more than one occasion and I enjoyed my experiences. The food is fantastic. I enjoy the spring rolls and curries here. This is one of my favorite places to get Thai in the neighborhood.
2017-01-21,1,No veg food, all other food- chicken, pork and other things were extremely average. Wouldn't recommend this compared to other restaurants in Hoboken.
2017-01-21,5,Highly recommend Keming! BYOB and the food is excellent. Tried a hot pot for the first time, which was an experience itself. The little juicy pork buns are a great appetizer. Looking forward to trying more of the menu next time!
2017-01-18,5,This is the best Sichuan restaurant I have tried in New Jersey, period. I never thought I'd be able to say I'd like a Sichuan restaurant in NJ, but here we are. I tried Kem Restaurant delivery last night and was so pleasantly surprised by how good everything we ordered turned out. We got the Beef Mala Casserole - reminiscent of "dry pot" for those of you fans of Mala Project in Manhattan - which was a seriously delicious sauteÃÅ of different vegetables, rice cakes, thin fatty beef slices, and tofu. We also ordered the Mouth Watering Chicken Âè£Ê∞¥È∏°, dry fried string beans Âπ≤ÁÖ∏ÂõõÂ≠£Ë±Ü,and the mapo tofu È∫ªÂ©ÜË±ÜËÖê - all of these dishes were full of flavor and awesomely spicy. I'm really excited to check this restaurant out in person next time to explore more items on the menu - I'll be sure to update my post with more photos and an update once I go!
2017-01-17,4,We gave this new place a try and we were not disappointed. I honestly can't remember what this was before, but I am glad this took over. The place was a bit empty, but I don't think many know about it yet.I wanted to be adventurous and order the traditional food but I wasn't and got my standard General Tso's chicken and the wife Pad Thai. We started with the pan fried pork dumplings. All of it was absolutely delicious! The dumplings were so good as well as the sauce that went with them. They were hearty and full of flavor, not typical over fried stuff. I asked for my chicken to be extra spicy and they did not slack off, but still maintained great flavor with heat. The chicken looked appetizing and like real chicken, unlike most Chinese places in town. The sauce was delicious. The lady's pad thai was also delicious, and a massive portion. Service was pretty good and they explained the hot pot to us and answered questions. It was a little slower towards the end when we wanted to get the check but that's ok.Overall, this is so far, a much better quick Chinese option in town with what seems like real ingredients and not double fried gunk. We will definitely be back here or at least order delivery.
2017-01-16,4,Really enjoyed this meal tonight. Loved the flavors and textures of the Tofu & Fish (flounder) Casserole. Nice soup dumplings. We brought our own bottle and had a great dinner. We'll be back.
2017-01-15,4,We just tried Keming for delivery. Our small group ordered a scallion pancake, double cooked pork, Peking noodles, szechuan style boiled beef, and Hunan chicken. The person who ordered the double Cooke pork was happy but I thought everything was solidly average except for the szechuan boiled beef, which was much taster than I expected. Great broth. I am definitely planning on ordering again and trying other options.
2017-01-09,5,I've been here twice in a week and my husband 4 times. The food is so incredible. Some of the best Chinese and Szechuan food I have ever eaten (including dozens of trips to flushing, manhattan Chinatown, SF, Seattle...) and it's here in Hobo!!!! Lucky us!!! Definitely get the hot pot, the dumplings (soup, pan fried pork, all are amazing). The wonton soup has the most delicate and flavorful wontons I ever ate, and the chicken in spicy sauce is one of the most delicious things period.
2017-01-03,5,Hands down the best Chinese food in Hoboken.. I've been there several times during the past 2 weeks and enjoyed every single dish I tried..The owner is one of the nicest people you can ever meet! Keep it up, Keming!
