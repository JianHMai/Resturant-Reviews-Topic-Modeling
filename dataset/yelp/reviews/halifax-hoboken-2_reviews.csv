2021-11-01,4,Cocktails were excellent and wine was excellent as well although it would be ideal if there were more by the glass options. The appetizers were excellent-poached shrimp, oysters, cheese board. Our mains were also very good (lobster pasta, salmon, steak frites). The ambience is excellent and restaurant situated right on the waterfront overlooking the NYC skyline which is a really nice touch. I highly recommend for late night cocktails, corporate hosting or even a quiet date night spot.
2021-10-31,1,I am not even going to give this restaurant a star because it's terrible. The food is horrible and to make matters worse the service is absolutely horrific. The servers are rude. The manager was rude and condescending when I complained about the servers being rude and basically trying to rush me and my party out the door when we were not finished eating at all. Meanwhile there were empty tables that were not occupied and needed to be cleaned. It seemed like they were trying to get the group of minorities out the door. Don't go there a waste of money.
2021-10-31,1,I came for brunch and I already did not care for the food. The wings were very rubbery and everything tasted very bland. There service has also been very poor because we felt rushed during our whole brunch experience from the moment we arrived. We were given wrong information regarding food coming out and they rushed us out to prepare for dinner. I honestly would not come back here because it's no where near worth it.
2021-10-25,5,I held my 22nd birthday brunch here. I originally made the reservation for indoors but looks like they switched me to outdoors by mistake! I had a large party and outdoors was fine as the weather was beautiful- they brought the small plates for the bubbles boozy brunch in pairs- two or three at a time, and the plates got shared amongst whoever was sitting next to eaxhother- some of the small plates (like the parfait and gazpacho) came individually. The menu was so cute and the Halifax logo on the champagne glasses is so cute!
2021-10-25,5,We hosted our baby shower brunch here and everything was amazing and executed flawlessly by the team!! Food, drinks and how attentive each person was to our guests was incredible! Highly recommend hosting a private event here! Ask for Olivia Meg or marcela!!
2021-10-22,3,I really want to like this spot but I rarely leave satisfied- we ordered drinks to start and chose to select a couple dishes a la carte for brunch and not do the unlimited option. We ordered the cous cous salad- it was prob the best thing we had. We also tried deviled eggs, sliders and mac and cheese. Everything else was just OK. I wasn't really impressed. Ambience is beautiful since it's views are of the city but other than that.. I'm sad to say it.. not running back.
2021-10-18,5,We recently had a 40th Bday party at Halifax on Saturday evening 10/16 and I cant say enough about what a great experience it was. The food and drink were wonderful but most of all the staff was top notch!! Marcella and the rest were attentive, proactive and efficient. they were super nice on top of it all and absolutely made the experience 5 star. We will gladly have another event at Halifax thanks to their good food and amazing wait staff.
2021-10-07,4,The vibe is definitely very nice. Has a classy feel to it but don't feel pressured to dress up though (but doesn't hurt to not). The food itself wasnt amazing to blow my hats off but it was very well flavored.
2021-10-06,4,Came for brunch with friends and had a great time, definitely would return. Loved all the different courses and the options within each course. Particularly liked that everything was pre-portioned to be one item/serving per person, instead of serving a plate of food to split amongst yourselves - made sharing easier and much cleaner. Even though it was "unlimited" we did not get any additional food at the end - with so many courses and bites to try throughout the meal we didn't have room for any extras.Staff was accommodating and attentive - we ate outside and they moved an umbrella over to our table since it was so hot and sunny. Our champagne (and waters) was always full which was much appreciated. Make sure to get the strawberry purée foe the mimosas - the OJ was nothing special (fine, but standard) but the strawberry juice was delicious! !
2021-09-26,4,The ambiance of the restaurant is amazing. This is the perfect place for a group or intimate dining. The food is a little pricey but that is to be expected for the location. The appetizers are amazing, I will say that. I don't think you can go wrong with any choice. Unfortunately for me, I thought the entree that I ordered (lobster rigatoni) was extremely bland. No amount of added cheese could make it taste better lol. They took a while to ask if we were ready to order and the food took quite a while to come out but that was okay because our group was not in a rush. Our main waiter was very nice. There was a weird period between 7-8pm where it was extremely dark and could not see the food on our table. When we asked another waiter if we could get a few candles at our table she just said they didn't have those, although the tables indoors had candles. We asked our main waiter and he explained that the lights outdoors don't come on until 8pm. I would really give this restaurant 3.5 stars but like I said the ambiance and apps might be worth it.
2021-09-21,4,Halifax is always a great time because the ambiance is really very nice. Both the inside and outside seating are quite pretty and the location is awesome out on the river. I like this brunch because there is something for everyone to eat and enjoy and I actually think most of the small bites are pretty tasty. The French toast is always a table favorite and we always order seconds and thirds. Chicken wings and meatballs are also yummy. I also like it cause a good 65% of the brunch menu is vegetarian friendly and I'm always out with a handful of vegetarians and this place has plenty of options for them.
2021-09-04,5,Marcella and Hilda were our servers for the day and they were fantastic! We have a friend who is gluten free and she was handed food that was perfect for her allergy! Both ladies helped us out and were very personable! The &45 for bubbles and brunch was perfect, unlimited small plates and sparkling wine!  Such a fun time!!!
2021-09-01,3,Halifax has been on my list for a while and I finally headed down on a Friday for brunch to see what all of the hype was about. Parking: Difficult to find, as is most of hoboken, I would leave at least 10 minutes to find parking, download the app, pay the meter and then walk to the location. Venue:Both the inside and outside of this place are GORGEOUS. It's right on the water, you can see the entire NYC skyline from the outside. The inside also had giant glass windows, basically floor to ceiling and it made for such beautiful lighting. The seats were also literally couches with pillows towards the back, it was SO comfortable. Service:Was nice! We were a group of 25 and were still out of there under the 2 hour mark, which I think is really impressive. They remembered everyones orders, and all of the nuances, were very open to making adjustments as needed too! They came to check in on us and refill our waters and what not periodically. Drinks:I ordered the latte. It was pretty good! It was a decent size for $5.50. There was sugar and other condiments at the table to be used as needed which was nice. I like to add my own sweetener when I can so I can control the amount that goes in. Food: Forgot exactly what the dish was called, but it was a corn filled pasta with a kale pesto and tomatoes. Unfortunately, for $26, this dish was not worth it for me. I asked for red pepper flakes on the side which they brought with my order, which I really appreciated. But the pasta was a little sweet and cold and the pesto was heavy on the olive oil. All around, not my favorite pasta dish. I'm glad I tried something new here, the presentation of the dish was beautiful, but I just wish the flavor had lived up to it a little more. But if you're a fan of corn and kale pesto, maybe you would like it. The pesto - despite the slightly excess oil, was flavorful and fresh. I personally wouldn't order this again. There are limited vegetarian options at this location. The menu itself felt kind of small in general.Overall, maybe I'd go back and try the small plates! I've heard great things about those.
2021-08-30,1,Stay away. The food is just dreadful, either from purchasing poor quality or a terrible chef. The manager was very accommodating and the staff excellent. And the breakfast available shouldn't be served at a homeless shelter. Across the street, in any of the restaurants, there is excellent food.
2021-08-19,3,Ehhhhhh. We ate here twice in a month. Both times for the bottomless brunch. $32 for unlimited sparkling wine and tapas. Yes it is a great deal. The first time was with a large group. Our service was super insanely slow, even just to get water on the table. It took roughly ten to fifteen minutes to get the first dish on the table, French toast. It's one quarter of a piece of bread per person. It was quickly eaten and then we had to wait another ten to fifteen mins for the second course of food. I thought this was mainly because we had a large party. WRONG. Our second visit was the exact same way. The manager and server profusely apologized for how long we waited after we sat. We had an 11:15am reservation and didn't sit at our table until 11:45. We had company with us from Toronto, it was pretty embarrassing how long we had to wait.
2021-08-17,5,The Halifax brunch is 10/10. Ambiance 10/10. The servings are small but they spaced it out intelligently that it won't make you feel super full in the beginning. I opted in for double shot espresso instead of the unlimited champagne because I was driving but even the coffee is 10/10.I cannot wait to go back again!
2021-08-15,4,A friend and I came here to escape the heat and have some drinks. The drinks are decent. The frozen drinks are a strawberry margarita and a frose which were soooo strong. I switched to the Collins which was more refreshing and light. The drinks are kind of expensive (they ranged between 14 and 19 a piece) and I was surprised that they didn't have a happy hour but the decor was cool and the location sits right on the Hudson River.
2021-07-25,5,Amazing bottomless brunch. Very worth the price. The portions are little but they keep coming. They also tell you to tell them if your want more of something. That took some time but was worth it! I would definitely go back
2021-07-16,3,Always, wanted to try this place as I am a Hoboken local. Finally my husband bought me here as a surprise for our Anniversary back in January 2021 and then my friend bought me here for my birthday surprise in March 2021. The meals were totally different. With my husband, it was Brunch which was good, however they can definitely add more options of food in general forget vegetarian. Their cocktails itself are worth 5 stars and the view of the city is decent itself. With my friend, it was more of a cocktail evening with few apps. Yet again, they can utilize more options of food for that part too. But, cocktails cannot complain at all.Pro Tip: if you like champagne, do try their French 75 :)
2021-07-12,1,The food was great. I had lamb meatballs, mussles and pasta. One of Indian old gentleman who works there asked my friend if we were Chinese when I was gone for restroom which is so weird...  Also, the service was terrible even though the whole place is empty.
2021-07-07,4,Grabbed drinks and apps with friends here on Monday evening. Halifax has a ton of outdoor tables along River Street, so there's ample opportunity to enjoy the views of Manhattan and the Hudson River.It's a bit pricey, but that's almost expected from a hotel bar/restaurant. They offer several choices for wine by the glass (red, white, rose, and bubbles), and their cocktail menu seems to change seasonally. The blackberry rye bourbon cocktail my husband got was very flavorful and pretty strong.One of these days I'll be back to try their weekend Bubbles Brunch!
2021-07-05,3,I really wanted to like this place more than I did. I've heard mixed reviews but needed to find out for myself.Going with a large group (8 total) we were ready to go all in on a delicious dinner. We ordered apps and the waitress didn't provide guidance that should have offered. Devil eggs and meatballs came out with only enough to feed 2 or 3 guests. This was a business dinner and we were cutting eggs in half so people could taste them. We luckily ordered a few other things but having the server let us know we needed a few of each app for our group size was a miss on their end.Drinks and stemware for bottles of wine came out painfully slow and overall the food and service just did not make this a memorable meal. It seems like Halifax has all the right ingredients to create a great dining experience but it's falling flat somewhere. Hoboken lacks a bit of fine dining and this could be it but not at its current state and service
2021-06-27,5,Went to Halifax for my anniversary dinner and was not disappointed. Firstly they were accommodating because we were late because of traffic and secondly the experience was worth the trip. Our server checked on us regularly and explained everything. The food was great. Overall a great experience .
2021-05-25,2,Wanted to try this restaurant since it was listed as a farm to table. However I don't believe that.We ordered four oysters. They are overpriced for the tiny size. Wouldn't get them again unless they have a $1 happy hour like before. These little things were $3.25 EACH! If you want to charge that price, give us the big meaty ones!We also ordered the smoked fish board and Halifax burger.Service was not great at all. We sat at the bar. People crammed in. And someone was sitting RIGHT next to me. Not happy about that.The smoked fish board was small for $25. It was not worth it. The smoked pollock rillette was the best part. Everything else was ok. Love the smoke flavor but I have had MUCH better quality. The smoked mussels were canned. This was way overpriced. Never again.The Halifax burger had a delicious sauce, fresh lettuce on a sesame seed bun. Wrong bun. The burger is dense which isn't a bad thing. It's not large, it's not small. It's average burger size. Would be so much better with a brioche bun. It was toasted at least. This was all $90. Also, not worth it!!! Will we return? No, no, no.Do not recommend.
2021-05-23,3,I was looking forward to trying this spot so I made reservations for 11am. They only have two brunch times for 11 and 2pm. When I arrived I found parking easily nearby. I walked in and was sat at a good location and the view was very nice. Mack was our server and she was ok. The main issue I had was she made it clear we had a two hour unlimited brunch limit and we had to chase her down a few times to get mimosa refills while she seemed to have been paying more attention to other tables. For the unlimited brunch it was small bites and mimosas or bloody marys for $45 each which was a good deal. Some of the bites such as the wings and french toast were good but others like the poached eggs and pasta were not. The bill came to about $98 and all in all we had and ok time.
2021-05-09,1,What we just experienced was absolutely mind blowing. Took my mom here for Mother's Day brunch and the whole experience was appalling. I understand it's a busy day for them, I will always take something like that into consideration but really it doesn't excuse what we went through here. I've attached photos of the food, untouched, the way they were delivered to our table of two. Mind you that salad was to share lol - I think these images speak for themselves. Took 40 minutes to receive our food in the first place and then we were served this. We actually had to leave after the second course because we didn't eat anything and we were literally offended and nauseated.
2021-05-04,4,The food was great and the service was amazing. People here were great. Love the view and the space.
2021-04-28,5,As always, the food and service at Halifax is top notch! We had Nancy as our server both times that we dined here over the weekend. She's so sweet and made our experiences even better! Friday's dinner: - The mixed green salad is such a large portion, more like an entree portion than an appetizer. The honey-sherry vinaigrette was light but flavorful! - The deviled eggs are always a must-order for me. Just wish the portions were a little bigger! - I'd definitely order the dressed oysters again, the seaweed salad was the perfect addition to this. - The poached shrimp is such a simple dish but was probably my favorite thing we ordered. The mustard tartar was so delicious. - My mom ordered the Black Sea bass Tartar but I didn't try it. She liked it, though, and said it was a nice light appetizer. Sunday's bottomless food brunch:I've been to Halifax a million times for dinner but somehow this was my first time trying their brunch. You can do bottomless food with one bottle of sparkling wine (per person) for $39.50. The servers come around and fill up your glass throughout the meal.  We came towards the end of brunch time so some items weren't served (the deviled eggs most notably). I think you definitely get your money's worth, we left very full, but some dishes were delicious while others were a little lackluster. Our favorites were the yogurt parfait, challah French toast, smoked salmon, potato poutine, and beef sliders.
2021-04-27,5,brought my mom here for brunch and we LOVED it! marlon was a great waiter v attentive and nice. we even got a cute dessert with a nice bday message on it because of the brunch items was sold out. pass on the pasta it's not all that but get a couple plates of the meatballs, french toast and poutine!
2021-04-26,3,Yesterday l had brunch here along with five other beauties. Our server asked numerous times about every arriving, one of the ladies was parking. From my understanding she only wanted to explain the menu once. Ok-- so onto the food, we noticed things were coming out slowly in the beginning. French Toast was just flavored bread, definitely no egg of any kind. Shrimp and grits just ok, grits could have been a bit thicker. The sliders weren't hot, wings were pretty good. They did keep the bubbles flowing which was great. I think it should automatic you receive fresh flatware and plates each time. I found myself request it a few times. Will return hopefully l can give them an extra star on the next visit.
2021-04-25,5,Tried the Weekend Brunch here with Unlimited Small Plates. Food was awesome and we all loved all the options we had. Pasta dish was not so great but 1 average dish out of around 20 yummy dishes, so no complaints. Service felt a bit rushed and we were constantly reminded of the 2 Hr Time Limit which felt like an overkill, especially when they keep reminding you ever half an hour but I am assuming it's due to the limited seating.Overall a good experience and would recommend.
2021-04-25,1,I really wanted to like this place. My sister recommended it for my birthday brunch and I booked it ONE whole month in advance to secure a spot. To make an appointment, they required credit card information which I obviously provided. I called to confirm my reservation closer to the date, and they claim that they canceled my booking because my card information was not in their system. No warning whatsoever. They claimed they called me, but I was obviously not available during the time they "called" as I was not able to answer - and I did not receive any voicemail regarding a potential cancellation. For something so important, I don't understand how a simple quick voicemail with a cancellation warning / urgency to call them back wasn't sent. It honestly still boggles my mind how this happened, I was outraged and dumbfounded. I don't understand 1) how they lost my card information, 2) how I lost my reservation without any warning, and 3) why I had to pay the price for a mistake that was not mine. I was at a loss for words - I felt cheated.I was very excited to celebrate my birthday with my friends at this place, instead I was left in disarray to find another last minute reservation at another place. Thankfully I was able to find another place at the last minute with a better reservation system and had an absolute BLAST with amazing food & amazing customer service. Maybe a silver lining.To summarize... HORRIBLE experience. HORRIBLE system. HORRIBLE service. Clearly not customer-centric. Never again will I ever consider this place for any future celebrations.
2021-04-25,4,Came for Sunday brunch and yummm they bring out different courses at a time they will not switch out plates unless you ask. Parking all over in the Hoboken area. Beautiful views and the champagne was flowing all throughout the brunch.
2021-04-24,2,DOUBEL CHECK YOU BILL!I liked this restaurant based on my previous experience dining at the place. Recently I took a reservation and had a dinner with two of my friends. We were a bit earlier than the reservation so the restaurant was almost empty. We kindly asked if we can switch the table from the one at the door to another but no one came back to us. Even worse, when I looked at my bill, I found I was automatically charged a 20% service fee and the waitress didn't even mention it! This is not acceptable! If I am a careless guy, I could have paid another 15% tip.
2021-04-13,3,I went for brunch. The location is absolutely beautiful, for the most part that location is why I'm giving it 3 stars. The food is served in courses once you choose to do unlimited bottomless. You can choose to do unlimited food only but the bottomless is really what makes it worth while, and the champagne isn't even that great. The course started from best to worst, by the end of the brunch eating wasn't worth the hassle. A couple of the wait staff were very nice and then of course there are the unpleasant ones that brings the experience down. It was a cool brunch to do but I'm not in any rush to participate again.
2021-04-10,5,I've been to Halifax twice and enjoyed my food both times! For appetizers, we had Lamb Meatballs and Deviled Eggs. For dinner, I tried the pork chops, creamy kale with chicken and a carrot cake. The pork chops were tender and juicy. The kale was the best part though, it was amazing!! The scenery is nice next to the waterfront and it's even better when you can sit outside.
2021-03-13,1,Beautiful spot. Don't be fooled.... our waiter was so rude to my friends and I... we walked out! Our reservation was at 7. We didn't see a menu/ water or waiter until 727. We said to the man, where have you been we are dying to order drinks! (In a respectful yet funny way) and he made a very rude comment to us. Made us extremely uncomfortable and we just got up and left. Extremely disappointed.
2021-03-08,5,I've been to this restaurant twice now and each time the service, food, and drinks have been excellent.  This gem is the restaurant in the W hotel in Hoboken. Listen, we've all been to the trendy restaurants that are great for photo oops, but leave much to be desired when it comes to food. Well this place is definitely trendy so you'll get your cute photos, but it also delivers on the food and drinks. I really enjoy their deviled eggs and lamb meatballs as appetizers. For the entrees, they change their menu, so I can't guarantee everything that I'm about to mention will be there, but if it is, please do yourself a favor and try these dishes. The lobster pasta is delicious , the chicken dinner is delicious, and so is the  pork chop entree! My friend also ordered the creamy kale, and that kale was also "you guessed it" DELICIOUS! For dessert, you must try the pumpkin cheesecake. It came with a maple whipped cream and cranberry sauce and it was to die for! I could eat the cheesecake everyday, and I'm not a dessert person. The apple fritters are good also. I don't think anything on the menu will be bad honestly. This place is cute for a date night or to go out with friends.
2021-02-27,5,This place is amazing, Rosevelt our waiter was awesome, endless mimosas, great food, great view. I mean what else can you ask for. I'm in love I would come here all the time. I came to celebrate my daughter Amanda and she loved it. Thank you for a great experience.
2021-02-16,5,Halifax was an outstanding choice for us as a Valentine's Day dinner. I made a reservation in advance and asked for a table with a view of the city which was perfect. Valentine's Night had a prefixed menu which honestly was excellent. The food was very upscale and definitely expertly made. The cocktails were also delicious and generous with the alcohol. It's a bit pricey of place but that's why for us this was a perfect special occasion kind of place. The service fee was included and for the overall price of dinner I don't think the service fee was too high. They also charged a dollar covid fee per person. Haha Not sure why tho. Both the covid fees and service fee kinda surprised me seeing as how they didn't let us know in advance that they're thrown in the bill but that partially my fault also for not asking I think that's probably standard for places such as this. But overall awesome place I would recommend and visit again.
2021-01-25,4,A good spit for brunch in Hoboken at the W Hotel. Parking garage is right across the street since valet of the hotel is no longer available during the pandemic as of January 2021 still. Pre-fixe brunch is the way to go. Reservation is a must! Their menu is perfect with lot of seafood options, charcuterie, cheese, meat and some vegetarian dishes too.The local Hudson River trout is always so good. Mussel is a must try and any crudo dish! Hubby enjoyed his burger! They have a nice bar too, made their own Vermouth, imagine that'You can't beat the view of New York City if you reserve the right table early enough in advance!
2021-01-24,3,This place was just alright.Pros - takes reservations; good distancing between tables.The food was decent but nothing mind blowing. The prosciutto cauliflower was yummy, but my lobster rigatoni was very bland.Cocktails were strong but the flavors were not balanced well. You can tell that they just spiked the drink with a lot of alcohol (usually a plus from me) with some sweet mixers and called it a day.The highlight of the meal were the apple fritters that we had for dessert. It was doused in powdered sugar, hot and warm with chunks of real apple, and a maple butter on the side.Service, like my lobster rigatoni, was bland. The server didn't come check on us for a while after I had arrived, and did not offer my friend a drink or anything else to order while she was waiting for me. After I had asked him for a few minutes to review the drink menu, he took a long time to come back. He also never checked on us unless I flagged him down, and even flagging him down was difficult, since we weren't seated in the center of the restaurant.I'd consider coming for brunch since there are many positive reviews for brunch, but I don't think I'd make an effort to come here again.
2021-01-20,4,Great foot and fast service. Food is great but portions are a little small for the price. The view is great of the city. I recommend the steak and their dirty martini!
2021-01-17,5,Best place to go for brunch! Had the waiter Mirlon and he was the biggest sweetheart. He made the experience so nice and with while. Reasonable price for a good time and everything was delicious. 10/10 recommend!!!
2021-01-15,5,Get the five items from the fish/meat/cheese section. Do not pass go. At $25 this isn't going to replace dollar pizza in my life but it offers spectacular options I didn't expect find in the delivery era. (And in the old days I wasn't exactly the target audience for a restaurant at the W Hotel).The best of these was the maple smoked salmon, an impeccable option if you don't think "sweetness" and "fish" should be mutually exclusive items. Further surprising me that a glamorous Hoboken spot could rival a roadside Michigan shack in the flavor department, I enjoyed the rainbow trout and pollock rillettes. Also on tap were Fulper's cheddar cheese and the prosciutto-esque pork lomo.The condiments and bread were pleasant surprises - there's a fruity container and another with pickles and legit old-timey mustard. Full disclosure: I also got a burger and fries. The intent was for it to become two meals. It was slightly more than one at least.
2021-01-03,5,If you're looking for something different for your weekend brunch game, this is it! The ambiance, views and playlist are unlikely anything I've experienced in Hoboken so far. First thing to know is they offer two seatings (11:00 and 2:00). I originally wanted to schedule the 11:00, but was so thankful my friends talked me into doing the 2:00pm.  The unlimited small plates is something you don't want to rush and you'll be full for the rest of the day. You have two options for small plates. One is unlimited small plates only and the other is unlimited small plates with a bottle of sparkling wine. Both are extremely well priced! They also have a cocktail menu and had half priced bloody Mary's. We're more of mimosa drinkers, so it worked out perfectly with the sparkling wine. The plates start coming out as soon as your drink order is taken. You can try every single item and then tell your server what you'd like to have brought out again. Don't start into your favorites too early! There are so many items to try - poached eggs, poutine, waffles, sliders, the list goes on. Make sure you try all of them! We loved seeing the next dish come out and trying to determine what was our favorite. With each new plate, I swear I had a new favorite. I think I ended on the wings and yogurt parfait. What a combination, right? I loved trying so many items and the price is incredibly reasonable. This is the perfect spot when if you're looking for something different or a group of friends are in town. Highly recommend! Will be back very soon.
2020-12-30,4,Amazing views on NYC while you enjoy a very well-curated menu with seafood in a variety of ways as the Star. From cured fish to smoked, as well as fresh, everything was wonderful! The best of the bunch has to be the lobster rigatoni though! Fresh Maine lobster and a buttery rigatoni, I mean CMON.
2020-12-15,4,Nice place with beautiful view to NYC.Good spot for once,food was okay and portions are really small.
2020-12-08,5,I really enjoyed coming her. Service was great and all the food they serve is delicious. The brunch menu gives a lot of variety and you can customize how things are made. You can also order more of the tastings if you want. The champagne is really good too and they give mix in options for juices. We had Orange and peach. It was a fun time and very relaxing. I'd come here again for sure.
2020-12-05,3,First time at Halifax- was really excited to celebrate an anniversary with close friends. The food was good but the service fell flat. Courses were inconsistent in timing. Felt like the waitress neglected our table and barely acknowledged us. The bus boy on the other hand did not - he took full plates of food away from us even though we requested multiple times for him to leave us be with the food because we were still munching. One hour before the brunch ended we waved down our server to request an extra cold plate of the smoked salmon and potatoes. She never came back.... we asked closer to the end of the meal if the food was coming and we got a flat "no". Overall I think the place is lovely but the service could use some work.
2020-11-16,5,I've visited this restaurant many times and I never walk away disappointed. It's my go to place to celebrate and to take in the NYC skyline. A classy, well-stated dining locale, I highly suggest a visit, especially if you have a reason to have a special meal out. The food is unlike any other restaurant in Hoboken or Jersey City. It truly is a notch above many others. Fresh, innovative dishes await you. Service is classy and kind and the manager, Weng, could not be a more humble and accommodating person. The ambiance is clean and fresh with a modern twist. And the view, unbeatable. So they got lucky with that! Some of my favorites include: Apps- Smoked salmon flatbread- Dressed oysters - Cured and smoked fish plateMains-Barnegat sea scallops - Smoked amish chicken - Lobster rigatoni (100% one of my fav dishes ANYWHERE)Dessert- Chocolate hazelnut mousse bar- Ice creamsBrunch- unlimited bubbles brunch is a delicious party of food and a bottle of sparkling wine!Also, for COVID-19 times, they are doing a great job. Probably the most socially distant tables, plenty of outdoor space, staff are all wearing masks the correct way, and it just feels clean. So glad to still have Halifax as a dining option in Hoboken!
2020-11-05,5,This is my favorite spot in town!All of the staff are absolutely amazing, they really make you feel like family.  I've been for dinner twice, and the berkshire pork chop main course is outstanding!  My bf has tried the prime New York strip and the smoked Amish chicken which were also fantastic.  Everything was perfectly cooked and the sides complimented the proteins so nicely.  They also have a great scotch selection and awesome wine list.  I haven't been here for brunch yet, but I've heard great things about that too!
2020-11-01,2,I used to love this place. The food and drinks are still good. However they REALLY give you a hard time concerning the party size (and they blame it on a state mandate which I understand. But it's not comforting or convenient for us whatsoever)TO TOP IT OFF, they charge US a covid tax!! Like it was a our fault that COVID happened or something. Just shows how important it is to vote against mandates and rules like this. Maybe it's not their fault, but unfortunately they have to pay the price for something like this. Something to think about.
2020-10-28,4,Halifax, Hoboken. Super quiet and comfy restaurant . Liked how it was not your average crowded bustling restaurant because of COVID times. Would definitely recommend for a date night or simple meeting. Ordered two appetizers, the Meatballs and Mussels. My favorite was the mussels. The broth was cooked with onions peppers and chorizo. Pro tip: open the mussel and scoop up the broth and then eat it. Last we got the lobster rigatoni. The lobster was very acidic which balanced with the pasta sauce very well. Loved the complimentary cookies. Perfect COVID restrictions. Prime location, good eats.
2020-10-27,3,Been here 2x.  First time liked it.  Felt special.  Second time was pretty poor food and service.  Pricey for what we got.  Will third time be a charm?
2020-10-19,5,I went here for my birthday brunch and everything was amazing from the food to the unlimited champagne.  The waiters were always present to fill the glasses and to provide any other utensils, drinks, etc.  The small plates selection was delicious.  The only down side of it was that there wasn't much protection on the day I went.  Protection meaning to secure the plates, utensils and glasses they had put on the table.   On a windy day which was the day I went, glasses were pushed off the table by the wind and it took a while before someone came to clean up.  Other than that, I'd definitely come back again.
2020-10-16,5,yummy. had the smoked chicken it was delicious. had 2 dirty martinis made to perfection. waiter was pleasant and so was the busboy. view was nice and so was the ambiance.
2020-10-11,5,Have been here a few times and it's a wonderful atmosphere, service, food and menus. Lovely inside with somewhat of a simple Californian look and feel. High ceilings, light wood floor. Food: have had scallops, oysters, lobster pasta, burgers, and the list goes on. Nicely executed.
2020-10-07,4,Came here in March right before COVID for their brunch. We pretty much asked them to bring out everything on the menu and they did! The best plate was the French toast. If you want to order desert it does cost extra. We had to call the servers over to refill the champagne a couple times, but it was definitely really busy. For the location and quality of food the price was great.
2020-10-05,4,I'm continuing the high marks for Halifax. I've recently stopped in for dinner/outside dining. Tables are situated for comfortable social distancing. The service is excellent. I tried the Lobster Rigatoni for the first time and it's very impressive, worth a repeat visit. Expect perfectly-cooked pasta with chunks of lobster tail/claw meat plus trumpet mushrooms in a delicate seafood broth. It's a very nice dish. The Prime NY Strip is respectable as well, and once again, cooked perfectly to my medium request. A dash of bordelaise sauce with a side of mashed potatoes was a nice touch, but the braised cabbage didn't add much. Entrees are on the pricier side. I feel that the menu has a nice balance of offerings. All in all, it's a nice spot for outdoor (and limited indoor) dining going into the cooler months.
2020-10-03,5,Halifax is the perfect date spot. An upscale experience in which the menus are digital and the wait staff is extremely attentive. The food is over the top, ( I had the beet salad and trout) cooked to perfection. Be warned you need reservations on Friday and Saturday nights, but the rewards are the best!
2020-10-03,5,This place was fantastic! We did the bubbles brunch, $38 for unlimited food and drinks for 2 hours. They go through 4 rounds of food, dropping off so many treats! The plates are small but this is PERFECT because you can try everything. By the last round we were so full we could only take a bite or two of everything just to taste. The service was amazing. Only recommendation would be to bring sunglasses as we were directly in the sun with no umbrella. What a great place for brunch!
2020-09-26,5,I always have a great experience here. The food was delicious and my glass was never left more than half empty. We were so full that we told our server not to bring out the remaining dishes to avoid being wasteful. Dana is the best host ever!
2020-09-21,4,Really nice spot right by the water, and a great view of the city. Their drinks are really good. I was a big fan of their old fashioned. Food was pretty good too. I tried the lobster rigatoni and scallop risotto. The rigatoni could have used a little more flavor, but overall, the food was really good.
2020-09-20,1,DO NOT EAR BRUNCH HERE! I would give 0 star if I can, we wait 50 mins without any plates, already drank 2 cups coffee and 2 cups of tea, Veryyyyy slowwwwww.All I can say is it doesn't worth your time to book 1 week earlier and almost 1 hour waiting for small brunch plates, with the same amount of $$, eat anywhere you want, there are so many restaurants near riverside. It's terrible when everyone else came after me but start eating, we talked to waitress twice but still didn't get anything to eat. We end up not eating anything but leaving cash for drinks and tips lol... lol WOREST Experience ever!
2020-09-20,5,Not sure why this restaurant only has 3.5 stars because I loved it here! This restaurant definitely deserves 5 stars in all aspects. The restaurant inside is so elegant and even during covid the restaurant was only at 25% capacity with tables spaced 6 feet apart. The service was really nice and friendly too!We got the oysters, deviled eggs, poached shrimp, scallop risotto and lobster rigatoni. Each dish was so delicious, the flavors were really on point. They also gave complimentary cookies as a dessert and they were delicious. I'm so happy with my experience here and I can't wait to come again! I've heard really good things about their brunch too.
2020-09-13,2,We went to Halifax for my friends birthday dinner. You can bring your own wine but there is a charge for opening it we were told $25. AFTER the waitress opens the bottle she comes back a few minutes later and goes "actually it's going to be $60 because it's a big bottle". That is so ridiculous and absurd that they charge that to OPEN a bottle of wine. Also my friend has an allergy to nuts and the sauce on the steak had pesto in it but they told us it was salsa verde, when it tasted exactly like pesto and nothing like salsa verde. She began having a slight allergic reaction to it. The menu description did not match the item we were given & no one seem to know the right answer. The atmosphere is nice & the food was tasty but overall not a great place to go with a group for dinner.
2020-09-08,4,Nice restaurant with some outdoor seating. Food was good but not a big selection of food on the menu. The service took long but overall nice and close to the waterfront!
2020-09-06,5,Halifax is one of the best brunch places I have ever been to. Bottomless brunch and endless small plates for $38 (2 hour limit) - what a steal. The services was spectacular (shout out to my guy Marlon, he was great!). The waiters are always checking in to make sure the glasses were never empty and there was always food on the table. They brought out more than 6 different small plates for us to taste and then let us re-order which ever ones we wanted. The French toast, breakfast potatoes, and parfaits were our favorites. They also had orange juice and strawberry juice mixers for the mimosas. The view of the water was also a big plus. I will 10000% be returning here and would recommend to anyone who loves a bottomless brunch!
2020-08-27,3,3.5 starsI recently went back to Halifax for another dose of their "Bubbles Brunch", a $38 feast of unlimited small plates and sparkling wine.  We sat on the patio with a view of the river and were surrounded by others enjoying the experience as much as we were.  Our sparkling wine was continually refilled and came with small bottles of orange juice and seasonal strawberry pureé.  The food followed the same format as the last time, but the bites had been updated to reflect the warmer summer temperature.  Below is a list of the menu items with my thoughts on each in parentheses:CHILLED BITES:1.) Yogurt Parfait with spiced apple puree, almond granola, berries (A favorite - was improved by the use of vanilla-flavored yogurt.  I asked for a second, but it never arrived, so I had to take my friend's...)2.) Deviled Eggs with smoked herring, scallions, and garlic chips (Not bad, but could have used more paprika)3.) Shrimp & Orzo Salad with pickled cucumber, Fresno peppers, and snap peas (Really flavorful, light, and summery.  Tasted like there was a mild mustard dressing of some kind on it)4.) Watermelon & Tomato Gazpacho with scallions (Served in a small espresso cup.  Watermelon and tomato might go well together in a salad, but not in this cold soup.)MORNING MUNCHIES:1.) Challah French Toast with maple whipped cream and almonds (Did not try on this visit)2.) Fruit Salad of melons, pineapples, and strawberries (Fruit cut/diced too small and was not overly fresh)3.) Vegetable Frittata with pepper aioli (Another favorite - fluffy, well-seasoned, and packed with vegetables.  We ordered 2 more plates of this, but only 1 arrived) 4.) Halifax Smoked Salmon with crostini, cream cheese, scallion, and capers (Only had the salmon, which had a nice smokiness without being too fishy.  Loved the dill on salmon)AFTERNOON DELIGHTS:1.) Potato Poutine with cheddar cheese curds, chives, and sherry gravy (Delicious roasted potato chunks covered with melted cheese and not too much gravy.  Different from a typical poutine with French fries.  Greasy, but soooo tasty.)2.) Summer Vegetable Mac & Cheese with smoked gouda fondue and parmesan (Better than the cauliflower mac & cheese from the last visit, but still a bit bland)3.) BBQ Chicken Wings with spicy slaw and scallions (Did not try)4.) Chicken Meatballs with a plum glaze and scallions (Meatballs were firm, but not in a bad way. Plum glaze was delightful.)MINI SANDWICHES:1.) Beef Sliders on a brioche bun with bacon-onion marmalade and white cheddar (Delicious and much better than the last time)2.) Tomato Hummus Crostini with smoked chicken and arugula (Did not try this, but heard it was horrible.  It looked very dried out.)3.) Pork Roll & Egg was a croissant stuffed with cheddar and scrambled egg (Did not try this, but heard it was very greasy)This time we also added a dozen oysters with a champagne mignonette as an additional dish for the table.  I am not typically an oyster fan, but these ones were very fresh and not overly salty.  Lastly, we ordered cups of coffee, which were rich, bold, and flavorful.Like last time, our service was inconsistent.  We were dining during a pandemic, so I thought they would have had their act together and given us serving spoons, but, no, we had to request them.  How were we supposed to share the family-style plates otherwise?!  Also, as mentioned above, many of our dish refill requests were ignored. However, I stick by my previous assertion that this "Bubbles Brunch" is a fun activity for a group and worthy of a 3.5-star rating.
2020-08-14,1,This place is an absolute joke, between the service and the poorly prepared food me and my girlfriend left after a $200 bill and went to popeyes, yikes! Ordered a $60 bottle of wine, no ice bucket, go check how much it is retail, $8, double yikes. that's on me ultimately, but the lobster pasta was butter and pasta and hard lobster clumps, no taste, no flavor. Really an embarrassing dinner and presentation!
2020-08-01,5,Ate here twice in two days. First for dinner and then for brunch the following morning. Lovely set up outside that sits facing the water. This is a great place to grab dinner for sure. The food was delicious and the service even better. The only thing that went wrong was there was someone throwing a liquid from the roof of the W HOTEL and it was falling right ok out heads! This happened on and off for the duration of Our time sitting here. The last straw was when a few people thought it was rain because it was so much and then we looked up. We immediately stopped drinking and eating whatever we had. It's unfortunate that the manager never came out and asked if we wanted to move or needed new drinks because ours were definitely spiked with whatever extra fell in it. Even though this all happened we still came back the next day for brunch and nobody remembered us apparently. Would've been nice to maybe have gotten a discount for brunch  even though it wasn't their fault at the restarant this happened but. Oh well. Brunch was a pre fixe menu. All the options were good. I especially liked the deviled eggs.
2020-07-31,5,I came here with my boyfriend for lunch. We ordered a variety of small and large plates. The restaurant followed all the right procedures for COVID-19 which pleased us both greatly. Ten minutes into our meal, we encountered it. Sweet, savory, and a subtle yet poignant taste of citrusy delight. It was not meant to be the leading performer but a backup dancer that felt that this day was the day the world would know its name. I'm talking about the truffle honey. The truffle honey was the perfect accompaniment to our meat and cheese plate. We didn't order it. We didn't pay for it. It just appeared like a shooting star on a clear summer night. And like a star, it stole the show. The truffle honey glided onto the bread like Michelle kwan gliding across the ice at the 1992 olympics. It filled us with such delight, that we made the decision to move in together after just one bite!!! Thank you truffle honey for cutting my rent in half. 5 stars for the restaurant, 26 for the truffle honey!!!!!
2020-07-30,4,Hard times for sure these days . Very sad to see the entire beautiful restaurant (inside) empty. However they carried on and did what they could given the circumstances. Outside tables were comfortable with overhead awning as well. Menu is upscale and very well thought out. Loved the " first plates" menu. Assorted cheese plate was excellent as was the pate. Wine list very very good and reasonably priced. Main dishes were well prepared and delicious. Wait staff was cheerful and attentive. Only reason for 4 stars and not 5 was the strip steak was good but overcooked. Medium not medium rare. Highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely return.
2020-07-29,4,Went here for my birthday dinner and had a great time. Despite during a health pandemic, this restaurant keep tables at a distant. Their wines are very tasteful and food on a very upscale and small portion but side note delicious. The inside restaurant is closed to customers so you have to sit on the patio which is great as you'll have a great view of the city. I was presented this cute cake with candles.
2020-07-27,5,On both occasions I've dined at Halifax, we've experienced an upscale, attentive and well thought through experience that we're planning on revisiting on special occasions. Views of the Manhattan skyline, in a spacious and well maintained bar and restaurant, and superb flavorful food and cocktails. On the pricer side of Hoboken dining, Halifax provides value for money, eclipsing some of the tired, loud and poorly prepared foods at other establishments. Recommended for special occasions or if clients are in town.
2020-07-27,1,This is considered a higher end restaurant where one can expect quality of their food products and service. You should not expect to find a HUGE PATCH OF MOLD on the surface of your blackberry in the yogurt parfait. This is absolutely horrific and makes me scared as to what the kitchen quality check process entails. Please be careful and examine all of your food.
2020-07-12,3,I'm not one to ever have the time and energy to post reviews online but I just have to after our experience today with a server named Kevin. Absolutely the worst customer service I've experienced it's not even funny. He was just so rude the way he answered our questions like we're supposed to know these things. It was our first time here. He didn't explain to us the bubble brunch so we only thought it was just the drink that was unlimited. He never said the small plates were too. He gave us an attitude when we asked nicely if there were seats with shade as it was scorching hot that day. "You are only here for two hours." he said. He never even greeted us when we came in! He was just overall the worst server we've ever encountered. 3 stars for the food, it was good. Too bad that experience was ruined by one person. Will come back but will definitely request another server when I make a reservation!
2020-07-11,3,meh.  if there was a 3.5 star option I would give them that, but I can't give them a 4 because of dirty they did me with that lemonade lolz for food this expensive, I would've liked for it to be seasoned. it was fine, just not worth how much you're paying for it. and whew child the lemonade... it wasn't lemonade at all. i will say the service and vibe was great, and they were very accommodating. just please be careful about what you're ordering.
2020-07-02,5,My friends and I came to Halifax for Sunday brunch and it was excellent! They had ample outdoor seating and were extremely safe after opening post COVID. The service was fantastic and efficient, as usual. Their brunch menu is delicious - every single small plate tastes amazing (somehow they make the best parfait EVER). The unlimited champagne is worth the extra money - they refill champagne consistently for 90 minutes. The decor and view of the skyline is perfect - this truly is the best brunch spot in Hoboken.I highly recommend Halifax!
2020-07-02,5,We came here yesterday for a celebratory lunch and it was absolutely wonderful. The staff was super friendly, accommodating and provided great service. The food was delicious from the starters to the dessert. Could not be happier
2020-05-23,4,Been here a few times now for brunch and have always had a positive dining experience. Food and drink is unlimited for a much better price than what you would find in the city. Some of the menu items are delicious, and others are just so so. They never seem to get the Mac and cheese right (I've had three different versions), but the French toast is fabulous.
2020-04-23,5,I have been here for multiple meals Quarantine review - I got the $60 kingfisher dinner 1 bottle of wine - 2 apps - 2 entrees and dessert - amazing!! This made for a great date night in. We got the chicken and gnocchi - I think the gnocchi was the best thing. There is a significant price different by pickup over delivery through grubhub or Ubereats- if you can pick up it's much cheaper. Boozy brunch review - yum!! Service isn't the best but the unlimited food and drinks is fantastic and the quality is wonderful. Get reservations in advance!! *enjoy*
2020-04-05,5,During these times it's hard to find good takeout.  Ordered from Halifax a couple of Halifax burgers and fries for lunch.  I live right across the street from the W hotel where the Halifax is located.  I picked up the food and returned to my apartment.  The fries were fresh and hot and the burger was perfect.  Thanks the the Halifax staff for hanging in there through difficult times.  Keep up the good work and stay safe.
2020-04-01,4,Updating my previous review up to 4 stars.  Ordered takeout during the COVID situation (Kingfisher dinner for 2) and it was both excellent food and value.  You get two apps, 2 large meals, plenty of desserts, AND a bottle wine for only $50.  I was able to pick up after only 25 or 30 minutes and staff was easy to coordinate with.  HIGHLY recommend.
2020-03-31,5,Amazing amazing food. Absolutely amazing staff. Hard place to get in for Sunday Brunch but once you get in it worth it.  For dinner we were late for our flight and the manager got us our meal with in minutes.
2020-03-23,1,Overrated. Decor: Beautiful - fun music as wellFood: Awful - no flavor and gave me a stomach ache. Price: for the amount of food - worth it - if the food was good. not coming back
2020-03-15,4,I came here for brunch for my friends birthday and it is definitely a great brunch spot for large groups! The view is beautiful overlooking the river and NYC. The interior is gorgeous as well with great opportunities for pictures! The food was also great, there were so many options if you did not like one portion of the brunch. They give you little plates of everything, and mostly everything I ate and enjoyed. The only issue I have with Halifax was our reservation was for 2pm, and of course we got there a little bit early but they would not sit us until exactly 2 even though our table was ready which I thought was a little bit strange. Also they only played music during the brunch time so from 2-4 there was music but before and after there was nothing playing, it was silent, which I also thought was strange.Lastly, during the brunch it was supposed to be unlimited mimosas and food and for about 40 minutes during the 2 hour brunch they did not come to our table one to give us more of the brunch or fill our drinks. They realized their mistake and brought us shots for the whole party which really was so kind!
2020-03-14,2,My girlfriend and I went for brunch for the first time at Halifax. The atmosphere was great and the place was lovely. However, the waiting staff could use a huge improvement. Our waitress was kinda enough to explain how the brunch menu worked. She also explained to us that we had a 2 hour window for brunch and how strict they kept that schedule. We were then left to our drinks for a little over 30 minutes. At that time we notices that ALL the tables around us were already on their second course, but we hadn't received anything. We were the first ones to show up and be seated but were the last ones to get our first course. I understand that brunch is a busy time, but the dining room isn't that big and there were more than enough employees around to give each customer proper attention. The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is because the food was excellent.
2020-03-08,5,Had the breakfast and it was amazing! Great presentation and great taste! Good service as well :)
2020-03-03,5,Came here for restaurant week. Had one of the best meal I ever had: deviled eggs, pan seared trout, and an apple pear crostata for dessert. Incredible attention to each dish. Will have to try the express lunch special soon.
2020-03-02,5,Best brunch spot in Hoboken!!! So many different food options + unlimited champagne! Very classy vibe and the food is amazing. Definitely recommend coming here for brunch!
2020-02-23,4,Pretty good food when you do the unlimited brunch that they have with drinking bottomless brunch type deal. I went with my friends for a girls day and it was def a good spot.
2020-02-17,4,Came here on a Sunday for a friend's birthday brunch which included unlimited small plates and sparking wine for 2 hours at $38. Our server was nice and explained how the brunch worked as it was all of ours first time here. Everything was delicious, my favorite was probably the smoked chicken salad and challah French toast. I was really looking forward to the beef sliders and cauliflower Mac and cheese but te beef slider were cooked medium and I prefer my beef well done, the Mac and cheese was okay-could've been better. I'd definitely love to come back again for the brunch as we enjoyed the atmosphere, our servers were great and price was also reasonable. They also had two bottles of pineapple and oranges juice to make your own Bellini and mimosa which I LOVED.
2020-02-16,5,I came here for a birthday bubbles brunch and it was a blast! It is $39 for unlimited mimosas and small plates. It was so much fun that I will be having my birthday here as well. For brunch, they have a 2 hour limit (which is kind of annoying) but it's fine. The times are 11-1 or 2-4. There is a bar next door that you can hang out at if you need something to do afterwards. Anyways, some of my favorite plates were: yogurt parfait, cauliflower mac & cheese, beef sliders, and the french toast. At first I thought it was a little pricey but it is definitely worth it!
2020-02-16,2,The entrees we ordered were great, but the service was mediocre. It seemed like nearly every other table received complimentary bread and popcorn, while we were left just waiting an unreasonable amount of time to receive food/drink that we'd ordered, had to wait to even ask for the check, and even longer for payment to go through. In a city with so many options, it feels hard to justify paying so much for worse service than you'd get in other equally delicious places
2020-02-16,2,Came here for a brunch birthday and I'm a bit in between on if I want to rate higher or lower. Their menu changes week to week so check it online before you go. While their menu says you get 1 bottle of sparkling wine each, that is not actually true. Their servers walk around with bottles and top off your glass; so, you could drink more than the bottle if you keep getting refills or you could drink substantially less if you don't (the wine wasn't good in my opinion). Pros - Their manager Maria is awesome. She's super responsive and will explain everything. She sends you everything through email and will work with you on dates if needed. There are some really good menu items for brunch (see my photos for notes on everything we ate). Some of my favorites were the yogurt parfait (i was surprised), potato poutine, potato-leek soup, beef sliders, smoked chicken salad, and taylor ham egg and cheese (a little greasy but good otherwise), and the vegetable fried grains. All of the food was good or better. Nothing was terrible. Technically, "unlimited" sparkling wine. They switch up their menu so if you go back, it isn't the same thing every time. Cons - Their sparkling wine is not something I would pick ever. It's from the brand Anna. It's dry and for me, went down a little rough. The servers came around and topped off your glass which didn't help as you couldn't add the juice (orange or strawberry) to the glass; however, they were pretty attentive. I had to ask them to only fill halfway so I could mix my own glass. The food comes out slow. I understand the amount of food they are making but we felt like we were just sitting there and waiting, and waiting, and waiting. It comes out in rounds and they bring out around 3 items every 15-20 minutes. The space was gold, granted I went in winter but I should not be shivering at my table. The physical atmosphere is pretty but the vibe is dull. They had a mix of music playing but the music was at a low volume. Twice, someone went over and turned up the music for a few seconds and in those two times, the whole vibe changed for the entire room of people. Everyone got more excited and upbeat but those moments were brief as the music was quickly lowered. The place overall is clean but my friend did need to get a new glass when we got there as there was something in her champagne flute. Price - Brunch is $38 for 11 or fewer people and $39 for 12 or more. With 12 or more, you get a personalized menu and you only get to pick 10 items off their brunch menu where if you have 11 or fewer you get to sample everything, so I say leave the extra friends at home. Overall, I say the cons outweigh the pros. I may be back in the future but won't go out of my way to come here.
2020-02-11,4,I came here for brunch and loved it. It's not a regular brunch spot like a pancake house. It's one price & everything comes out family style then you can re order what you liked. I loved the parfait and french toast. The potato's and Mac and cheese was also great. I highly recommend trying them out . Only con is that they could throw in some seafood options for pescatarians or more veggie options. Beautiful ambiance.
2020-02-01,2,NOT A FAN!!! Came here to celebrate a friends birthday and left very unimpressed (ending with a side of indigestion). We were a party of 13 and ordered a variety of items off the menu. The hit of our meal was the bread (fresh Parker rolls) & the cookies (fresh baked served at the end). For starters, our group ordered the lamb meatballs (ok), the salted cod and shrimp fritters (ehhhh), shrimp cocktail (person who ordered this got a bad one and had to leave the table to spit it out), mussels (ok) & oysters.The service isn't that great  either. A few people in the group almost lost the plates they were still picking at. Hoboken definitely has much better pLaces.  Will not be back!
2020-01-27,5,The BRUNCH!!!!!! I don't even know where to start. The menu is phenomenal. Everything you get you want 6 more plates of. The service is quick with their refills and the venue is beautiful. ALSO it's excellently priced. If you haven't been already, I would definitely recommend rounding up your friends for a birthday brunch or even just a boozy Saturday and take advantage of one of the best brunches right in Hoboken.
2020-01-26,4,Celebrated my 30th birthday here a few weeks ago after a friend had heard great things about this place. It took a few weeks for me to get a reservation for brunch but the wait was worth it. My only complaint about the reservation was I booked for 11 am originally and I received a phone call the next day asking if I could change to 2pm as they over booked. My party of 4 rearranged our plans to make it for 2 but I feel as if we shouldn't have had to change our plans if they took the 11am reservation without a problem. The reservation is for 2 hours. They bring out everything in courses and at the end you can order more of what you liked. We had 2 people in my party with dietary restrictions (a vegetarian and a fish allergy) and they worked with us without a problem. The champagne glasses were never empty. Everything was delicious but my favorite item was the flourless chocolate cake bites we added to the brunch at the end. Parking is terrible in the area and when we arrived the valet parking line was insanely long. We paid for all day parking in a lot across the street but I would suggest to Uber or take a train down to avoid the parking. I certainly do plan on going back.
2020-01-22,4,We parked our car in Hoboken and took the Path to NYC. We went early so we can have a bite to eat and check out this place. My husband and I had some drinks and a few appetizers and it was perfect. We sat at the bar and met another couple that was doing the same thing. Great drinks, great appetizers/tapas menu and great company.
2020-01-19,5,I made a reservation for Halifax's brunch for my girlfriend's birthday.  I worked with Maria to get the reservation set up. She was super friendly and quick to respond to any questions I had.  From start to finish the food, drinks, and service was all excellent. We had a young man named William as our server who was on top of our table for the entire brunch.  He was very polite, super helpful, and made the experience for my girlfriend and the rest of our table amazing.  The brunch is a great deal for what you get between the food and the drinks.  The restaurant is absolutely beautiful which made the experience that much better.  I will defenitly be back in the future and I will point anyone looking for a good brunch in Hoboken to this place.
2020-01-19,5,We celebrated a friends 40th birthday last night. The night was an experience we will forever remember, thanks to the on-point service by our amazing crew at Halifax. They went the entire length to make sure our orders were taken on time, the cocktails were coming and our every need addressed promptly. Carlos was our star of the night. He took absolute care of the nut and gluten allergy needs for a couple of people and kept a hawks eye on that throughout. The view, the food, cocktails and the service was great. I also really appreciate their patience with the 8 kid's in the party whom we had to leash in a couple of times. They did it really nicely, without getting annoyed. Kids can be a pain at times, especially when they are running around other patrons who want to enjoy a quiet private dinner. There is one guy, who sang a beautiful rendition of 'Happy Birthday' on their crew...boys got talent! Thank you Halifax, and thank you Carlos, for making the event special! We will whole heartedly recommend this establishment, thanks to the people who know what service should be like. And compliments to the chef and the crew that waited on us last night.
2020-01-18,5,Had a great time celebrating a friend's 21st birthday here at Halifax. We went to get the Bubbles Brunch for $38 per person. Honestly was a bit reluctant to spend that much money for an unlimited small plates brunch but it was surprisingly worth it especially with that unlimited mimosa that's included in the brunch. They give you all the small plates in the bubbles brunch menu but they do it in rounds so you don't get overwhelmed with all the food. It probably took 3 rounds for us to go over all the small plates in the menu and by the time we're done tasting everything, we were already full and buzzed lol. I say it's worth it because for that price I was able to try every little thing and not just have to stick to one meal. They were also very attentive to my friends' allergies and meal restrictions. We also brought our own cake for our friend and the staff were more than helpful with the surprise and cake cutting. I recommend going with a group for the brunch so you can try everything. If you have less than 4 people, the brunch might be too much for you since there's a lot of of the small plates to try~We went on a Sunday and parking on the side street was free! Make sure to get there before 11am so you can find a parking spot.
2020-01-12,1,My husband and I stay at the W quite often. We have been to the Halifax for lunch and it was quite good. Word of warning don't go there Sunday morning between breakfast and brunch. They are too busy setting up for brunch to take care of any paying customers that just want breakfast. My husband and I ordered eggs with bacon and when we got it the eggs were cold and hard. The bacon was undercooked and rubbery/ greasy like it had been leftover from breakfast sitting in a hotel pan in the kitchen. Servers rarely checked in on us. Watched the bartender wipe his nose with his hand then start cutting celery without washing his hands, for what I guess was bloody Mary's. Very disappointing.
2020-01-10,5,I loved the Halifax ambiance is everything the food was incredible, the service was the best. Can't wait to go back for brunch and sometime join for dinner.
2019-12-29,5,Had my birthday brunch at this establishment. The drinks, food and service were amazing had absolutely no complaints
2019-12-04,3,BEWARE! If you make a reservation, confirm your party will sit together. I made a reservation with Halifax for 14 people two weeks in advance.When we got to the restaurant and our hostess showed us to where we'd be sitting, she said, "These are your two tables."I said, "Excuse me? We won't be sitting together?"The hostess told me that despite making a reservation two weeks in advance, there were two groups who made a reservation a month in advance so they'd have priority to the long tables. That's fine - but wouldn't you think to mention that on the phone? I had 14 people now staring me, standing around awkwardly trying to hide their disappointment that we wouldn't all be sitting together. "Can we just push these two tables together?" I asked. "No, they won't fit." (There was plenty of room.) The hostess just kept saying there was nothing she could do. It was a really disheartening experience from a place I otherwise used to love. I felt like they were trying to pull one over on me by not mentioning we wouldn't all be seated together. I mean, why would I call and make a reservation for 14 people if I didn't expect to sit together? Food wise it was all delicious except the soup. Everyone agreed it tasted like burnt cigarettes. It was disgusting.
2019-12-04,5,One of the greatest brunch locations I have been to in the area. The French toast plate was my favorite selection from their menu as it is extremely delicious. The staff were very attentive throughout our brunch making sure our requests were fulfilled. Every plate was well done and tasty. The space of the location is big enough to feel like your party is the only one. Fantastic overall!
2019-12-01,3,We've gone twice to this restaurant, located at the ground level, facing views of midtown Manhattan, of the W Hotel in Hoboken. The first time was for dinner and it was delicious. The second time was for brunch today and we didn't have the same experience. They have unlimited food and bubbles (sparkling wine) for $38, but we skipped the bubbles and paid $26 for unlimited food. They serve a bunch of small dishes, and you can repeat  as much as you like. I think you pay for the amount of food you get, more than the quality of it. Cold dishes were better than hot ones--among the hot, the fall mac and cheese was served cold and flavorless. Everything was just ok. My husband has a nut allergy and we told our waiter, who took care of that. We were told that almost all bread is infused with nuts, and for that reason they would serve my husband the filling of the sandwiches, but no bread. We were wondering, how can it be that a restaurant doesn't have a regular/plain bread option?  If you enjoy eating and want your food to taste good, please avoid brunch and head to Halifax for dinner.
2019-11-26,5,I went to Halifax with a big group and we did the bubbly brunch. It was a great experience and you get more than your money's worth! It's endless refills of champagne and small plates to share with the table of a wide variety of dishes for two hours. The food was delicious, there wasn't one plate that we didn't like. My favorite was the Mac and cheese and the deviled eggs, but truly every dish was great. The champagne you were able to make mimosas with, with either a peach or orange juice. The service was also above and beyond. They were very accommodating, friendly, and outgoing. Will definitely be back here!!!
2019-11-20,4,It's true about the service, it can be problematic. But once they are aware they remedy it and it was awesome. The food is delicious. The champagne is always topped off.
2019-11-17,1,I've never felt so unwelcome  in a restaurant by the hostess. They don't care about walk-in guests, the empty tables are just for advanced reservations. Was told we can wait for the high top table so we did then story changed that we can just sit at the bar. We just walked out and went next door and got much better treatment.
2019-11-17,1,Horrible receptionist experience! There 4, (3 Asians and one one white guy) of us that arrived 1pm at Halifax. We went to walk in and they said to wait for 20 to 25 minutes for them to entertain walk ins. So we wait and came back after 25 minutes and they told us we can use the high table or the bar for walk ins. Most tables are empty so I asked if we can just go to the regular tables but they said no. Ok, so we waited for another ten minutes for the high table to be vacated coz we don't want to sit at the bar. When we are about to sit at the high table, they suddenly told us that the high tables are gonna be used to other reservations! The restaurant is empty! And they told us in the first place that we can use the high tables and thats why we waited! Only to find out we cannot use it! Felt like we have been profiled. I've been frequenting that place but am never coming back!!!
2019-11-11,5,2 hour brunch with unlimited champagne and food. The food comes out family style and in courses. You can repeat any dishes that you liked the most. The champagne glasses were never even close to being empty, our server Mackenzie did an amazing job refilling them and was also very welcoming. We made our reservation about 2 months ago and it was so worth the wait. Reservation was for 2:00 and we were sat on time. The music was also great! I will recommend Halifax brunch to everyone! Had a great experience.
2019-11-04,2,Decided to try Halifax for a birthday dinner.  We were a table of 5 and the restaurant wasn't very busy for a Saturday night.  We ordered some appetizers to start, soups and salads, and our entrees.  The appetizers came out and were fine.  Oysters were fresh and the deviled eggs were tasty.  After apps, our entrees came to the table.  We asked our server about the soups and salads and he replied "oh sorry, would you like them now?"  Our entrees were sitting in front of us so we said, "just take them off the check."  The entrees were just ok.  The Lobster Rigatoni had only a suggestion of lobster and was not a very big portion.  I tried the Seafood Special which was described as a cassoulet but was more of a bouillabaisse.  The dish was fine but I asked another server who walked past if its possible to have some bread to soak up the broth.  She asked if I wanted the same kind of bread that came out on the table when we sat down.  I replied, "we never had bread on the table." She hurried away and returned with bread.   Finally, we decide to order coffee and dessert.  Since we were celebrating a birthday, we asked the server to please put a candle in the dessert.  He replied "No problem!"  Desserts came out and there was no candle.  The manager did send over a plate of cookies and some sort of shot (after we finished dessert and coffee) but it didn't really make up for the poor experience.  The kicker of the evening is that gratuity was added to the check.  I wont be going back and I don't recommend.
2019-11-02,1,Rude hostess- and I can't stand liars. She said the wait time would be about 2hrs because of an already underway event that only filled one half of the restaurant. She declined to show the waitlist. If too lazy to guesstimate realistically, just don't throw a wild number. She also seemed unhappy to be there. Lol
2019-10-28,3,Lunch was fine. Minus 1 star for too much salt. minus another star for the discombobulated service. but the ambiance and view are stellar.
2019-10-27,3,Did the bubbles brunch and our whole group was underwhelmed. The only fish that stood out was the French toast. So many better brunch options else where
2019-10-20,5,This place is one of the best places if you're looking to have a boozy brunch with an amazing view. The view is absolutely gorgeous and the environment is just aesthetic! Perfect place for birthdays!
2019-10-18,2,Recently went to Halifax for dinner.  The food was okay, nothing special.  The service however was terrible.  My husband explained to the waitress that he cannot eat crab so she offered to substitute the side dish that came with his order.  However when his food arrived, we were surprised to see she subbed it out with something else that contained crab.  While we tried bringing it to her attention, we did not see her for almost 20 minutes so we just ate the other food we had ordered.
2019-10-17,5,My gf took me there and I was amazed. I love it and would definitely return her again . Enjoyed the brunch special
2019-10-15,5,I. LOVE. THEIR. BRUNCH! I came here for brunch based off of a recommendation from a friend and am fangirling over this brunch. First off, the place is beautiful, very elegant and you cannot beat the New York skyline view. While $35 for a meal may sound expensive, I guarantee you it's worth unlimited small plates and an entire bottle of champagne! They bring out the entire menu, all delicious, and if you're still hungry you can order all of the food you want. The waiter was also very attentive and filled our champagne glasses before we even finished our drinks, now that's service! Can't wait to come back here :)
2019-10-08,4,Bang for your buck! A bit over $30 gets you a bottle of champagne and unlimited tapas - the amount of food is amazing compared to other "bottomless" brunches I've been to. I always recommend Halifax to those looking for a brunch spot in Hoboken. You can't beat the price, the atmosphere, and the view. I've only been once, but have been looking for a reason to return ever since. Wish they would also accommodate gluten-free folk like myself where it's a necessity - almond flour pancakes wouldn't hurt haha!
2019-09-22,3,I'm not going to lie, I had a good experience here.  The service was great, it was the night before my birthday so they made me feel special.  The food is good, we had some shrimp fritters which were really good and the salmon was delicious.  The view of this place is great because is right close to the water so it's a nice experience.  You get popcorn and bread to start but I think they gave us very little popcorn and it was party of 5.  It's tough for someone who loves popcorn to much and has to share that tiny bowl with 5 people! The amount of popcorn was more for my dog who barely even weighs 10lbs.  Also, the salmon was delicious, but the amount of food is very little for the price.  Again, it's a nice place, food is good and they even got me chocolate chip cookies and sang happy birthday to me.  I really loved that part!!!
2019-09-19,1,I contacted Halifax 4 separate times to host a private event. When the assistant general manager finally got back to me a few days after my requests, she emailed me. I immediately called her back with questions and she didn't seem thrilled I had called so I asked what the best way to contact her was. She said email so that nothing got lost as she "answers them in the order they are received" and she was often walking the floors and wouldn't want to miss a call. I emailed back and forth my questions (each time took a day to respond back to). I tried calling after that, but no one would answer. Finally, I told her we were interested in Booking the venue for the day and time she had said was available and to please let me know next steps. No response. This was a Friday. Instead Monday morning I get an email reply back answering another question in my email, but not addressing the fact that I had asked how I could reserve the date. I decided to go in person. After finally meeting with her, and her showing me the space she asks for the date again, and then proceeds to tell me she just sent a contract to someone on Saturday! I said I emailed her Friday asking to reserve the date, and her response back was she gets a lot of emails. Well then maybe email shouldn't be your preferred method. This was extremely frustrating as we had told her we were very interested before the final email. A simple courtesy of "someone else is looking at this date" etc would have been professional. Instead of an apology she told me that her original email states nothing is reserved until the contract is signed. NO kidding. I felt that the whole interaction was unprofessional. After that I contacted the general manager, and asked for him to speak with me so I could provide feedback about the process. I still have yet to receive a call or email back. So, after all that maybe I was done a favor because obviously they are not organized or easy to work with.
2019-09-14,5,Had the brunch with family and it was a great experience. Many choices of small plates with bubbles. Great service on top of that. Superb way to spend a Sunday PM. We will definitively do it again.
2019-09-05,5,This restaurant gets a five star from me!!!  The food, ambiance, and professional staff make this an easy five star to give!!!  Great bar, excellent menu and fantastic presentation!  My hat off to the chef!  Enjoy the water views and NYC skyline!  Enjoy!
2019-09-02,2,The oysters saved my experience at Halifax. I came to this restaurant for happy hour expecting to have a great time with $1 oysters and cheap drinks. As soon as our server Adam realized we were ordering just off the happy hour menu he was reluctant to serve us after many attempts to flag him down.After a dozen oysters we wanted to order more off the menu but the server never checked in to our table, until I had to yell across the room get his attention. Ended up asking for the check and the bill came out with everything full priced. asked him to fix it and he brought it back a second time with the same mistakes.Most likely will never go back to Halifax because I felt belittled from the experience.
2019-09-01,5,I had my birthday brunch celebration here...and it was amazing!! The staff was so professional & the food was delicious! The management went above and beyond to accommodate my guest and all my request...we were a party of 14 and the staff never missed a beat!! Amazing!! *love love love the French toast!!*
2019-08-31,1,I used to go here all the time then for some bizarre reason they changed their menu from the fried chicken polenta to chicken wings (their menu online still has the  fried chicken polenta so don't be deceived). My friend and I both had the wings and it got us so sick with non-stop diarrhea. Disgusting.Never again.
2019-08-31,4,Great brunch spot for a great price. View is amazing. The service wasn't bad. There's a few parking garages nearby by I was able to get parking right in the front. I highly recommend this restaurant.
2019-08-29,5,The first time I heard about brunch at the Halifax I thought, "How am I going to get full from small plates?". Then I learned that they are endless small plates AND you get everything that's on the brunch menu. At one point, I had to stop at the sliders because I was so full. Mimosas are bottomless for the two hours. Waiters/waitresses come around with champagne and fill everyone's glass to the rim and you are given two bottles of juice for the table to make a mimosa or bellini. Surprisingly, the brunch is very affordable. I've had brunch here a few times and was never disappointed. One thing I recommend is to reserve a table at least two weeks in advance. They book very quickly. Especially for large parties.
2019-08-25,3,I came here from brunch yesterday with a friend. The ambiance is beautiful with a near perfect view of NYC. We were seated promptly and our waiter came over a few minutes later.We had the unlimited brunch and also ordered oysters because, why not? The food here was very good. The standouts to me were the French toast, poutine, and the sliders. Can't speak on the sparkling wine they serve because I was on antibiotics, womp womp.Minus 1 star due to the lack of service. Had to ask multiple times for our oysters, clean plates, etc. Scarcely saw our waiter, however, it did seem like there was one gentleman continuously going around with the sparkling wine so you obviously won't go thirsty.Also, the hostesses should mention that they can validate your parking ticket on the way out. There's no need for me to walk to my car and then have to go back to the restaurant. Minus another star due to the fact they they charged my card twice. This place has a lot of potential to be 5 star but falls short due to incompetence.
2019-08-25,1,Do you like being alone on a weekend night? Then Halifax is the place for you. 8pm and only three tables occupied in the whole place. Nonetheless, it takes thirty minutes for anyone to come over. And I mean anyone -- there were no menus or water for thirty minutes. Rolls arrived finally but there weren't enough for the number of people at the table. Lackluster food, uninspired menu, and a giant bowl of popcorn. If this place hasn't shuttered within six months, I'll be surprised.
2019-08-23,5,Daniel and Paolo make this place such a great experience all around. Myself and 3 girlfriends did brunch here on Sunday morning - we didn't have reservations but we're there as soon as they opened. They made space for us and we had a great time. The good was a whole experience - we loved every dish and are absolutely coming back for more bunches! The French Toast was my favorite.
2019-08-22,5,Halifax delivered a wonderful engagement party for my fiancé and I. Our guests as well as ourselves had the best time and we appreciated how attentive Maria and Daniel were to getting our event right. Daniel took great care in making sure we were setup on time and had plenty of beverages and bites for our guests. We really enjoyed our experience and would recommend using Halifax for anyone's special event!
2019-08-18,3,Halifax in the W hotel is a pretty great All you can eat & drink brunch for $35. They keep the champagne flowing (one of those situations when you take a few sips they are already coming around to refill) served with Strawberry and Orange juices if you want to mix. There is a full menu of small plates that get served to each table- you don't select, you get all of them! As the last couple plates wrap up they come around and ask you which you would like more of- you can order as many as you want (although you'll likely be full at this point)! Some food highlights: the deviled eggs, the French toast, Beef Sliders, but everything is worth trying.This most recent time brunching here there was a 40 minute gap between being served the last 2 plates on the menu, we thought we weren't going to get them at all and had to ask 3 times. Following this we didn't really even have time to reorder the favorites although we did push for one more round of French toast to end on.Overall the deal is great, the food is good (certainly some better than others) and the service was friendly but slow on the food side.
2019-08-17,3,2.5 star marked it up to 3 for the location As a true Manhattan girl, I don't usually hang out in NJ (sorry NJ folks). But for the convenience of one of my best friends and new mom and dad, I decided to trek across the Hudson and meet them in the nicest restaurant in Hoboken.Halifax is right on the river bank at the W Hoboken. Prime location with nice manhattan view. Menu has variety options from charcuterie to seasonal salad to larger format meat dish and pasta, though don't expect to find anything interesting here. We had our eyes set mostly on the charcuterie and appetizer. Ordered a section of smoked salmon, trout, mussels. It was disappointing- how could you mess this up, you wonder? Well here we go- the fish/shellfish were ice-cold while it should have been slightly lower than room temperature; the mussels were tasteless while it should have been savory and hint of smoke; the trout was sweet while it should have been savory. We also got the steamed clams which came, couple of them were not cooked through...I lost my appetite right there. We alerted the waitress but her response was "was that a problem?". Of course it is! t was bad of fish over cooked but even worse of undercooked because that would mess up your stomach even food poisoning! She took it back and cook it again then the same plate of clams came out. This is wrong. Back on the other side of Hudson, the restaurant would have taken it away and offered something else instead. Not just Michelin Star restaurants, just any good restaurants -food and service. I didn't touch the clams till the end of dinner but didn't want to react in front of my best friend as she chose the location; 9 out of 10 times she came meet me wherever I chose in Manhattan. All I all, I am not impressed and resent even, Halifax ruined my second visit to Hoboken. I will not return.
2019-08-12,5,Hands down best brunch in Jersey City/Hoboken area. Went last Saturday with a big group (party of 12) and waiter (Salazar) & manager were very antenttive and constantly made sure everything was ok. Best service ever! Definitely recommended and definitely coming back!
2019-08-09,1,This place is a joke!! Ordered food and was told that it will be ready in 15 mins. Went to pick it up and was told that it would be another 10 mins. After waiting 25 mins more, I was told that it'll take a few more mins. What a joke. This place sucks! Why would The W be associated with this place. Not staying at this W anymore.
2019-07-30,5,We had the absolute BEST meal at Halifax overlooking the Hudson River.  I had the Ricotta Cavatelli for dinner and Vanilla Panna Cotta for desert.  My Wife had the Roman Style Gnocchi and the New York Style Cheesecake!Absolutely the best meal we have ever had.  Totally recommend those four dishes and that place.
2019-07-30,2,Planned a bridal shower at Halifax and the operation leaves much to be desired. The Assistant General Manager, who coordinated most of the planning before the day was great! However, the day of operation was somewhat embarrassing to be associated with the W Hotel. When the bridesmaids and my family arrived early to set up for the shower they were advised by the hostess (or who ever was standing at the podium) that there was no bridal shower being hosted that day. This caused so much unneeded confusion and panic. Not sure who finally clarified - but how disorganized can you be. As a hostess or whoever is greeting customers it's pretty simple to provide that person with a run of show for the day. I understand there is a switch over with parties but as a venue that throws events consistently, this is basic. Also customer service 101 .... a simple "let me look into that for you".The chef came out of the kitchen to ask about allergies at the party. What a joke ... the ENTIRE menu is allergens that can not be accommodated (nuts, dairy, gluten). Please keep in mind I already discussed these allergens with the coordinator so they should have already been aware, and was told that no adjustments can be made. And if he was double checking ... great. But it just seems foolish for a chef to come out and ask about allergens just to respond, "we can not accommodate". Its 2019 ... Halifax is so behind on the fact that MANY restaurants are making accommodations for life threatening food allergies.You are able to pick 10 items from the menu, my table never saw a couple of the food options. Also, keep in mind, food does not continuously come out, it's family style and only 2 plates of food per table were served. Myself and many others left the brunch still hungry. Only plus ... champagne was flowing constantly. The kitchen started serving food late, almost 30 min into the party. 1 min before the party was over (2 hour party) they were already kicking us out. Extremely rude considering we accommodated the restaurant's late start and horrible customer service. I would never have another party at this venue, especially considering the prices they charge. If you're going to be expecting people to pay for best in class service, you should probably master the basics.
2019-07-28,2,I'm giving Halifax two stars because the view and style of the restaurant is lovely and the food was genuinely delicious. However, much of the experience eating there was tainted by some of the worst service I've ever experienced. First, we were told we couldn't sit at a table because they had reservations coming in. We were there for 90 minutes, and about half the tables in the restaurant remained empty. Sitting at the bar was fine, except the server could not have been less hospitable. Halifax has a pre-fix option where you get the entire tasting menu plus drinks for $35 per person. It's a lengthy menu, so my mother and I were hesitant to commit to that, but our server said that was the only option for brunch, which is simply not true. Upon closer inspection of the menu, we saw that we could do the menu a la cart if we wanted to. The server was obviously trying to upsell us by not being forthcoming about that option. She also said the menu's options were small enough that it wouldn't be overwhelming. Well, we saw what the full tasting menu looked like because the couple next to us got it, and let me tell you, unless you're used to eating two to three meals in one sitting, that's WAY too much food. Once we noted that we'd like to do the menu a la cart, our server couldn't be bothered with us. She never checked in to see how our food was, we had to hail her down for waters which took 10 minutes to come. The last straw was when we asked to get what remained of our food (note: we got less than half of the menu between the two of us, and we still had food left over), and she told us they "don't wrap up leftover food for people who do a la cart." What the heck kind of crazy rule is that?? That policy is absolutely absurd and extremely wasteful because they're just going to throw that food away. Halifax managers, if you're listening, this policy is shameful, especially in this day and age where so much of the world is struggling with food insecurity (unless of course you send leftovers to a nearby homeless shelter which I doubt you do). Finally, we had to essentially yell across the bar to get our check, which was incorrect (we'd ordered two dishes that never came, but she left those on the check since she obviously had no idea whether they came or not since she never checked in). If we ever return to Halifax, it'll be for table service which, hopefully, is any level above the abysmal service at the bar.
2019-07-23,4,While I don't spend a lot of time in Hoboken, I really enjoy this brunch spot! They do bottomless bubbles and small plates. I've been for small group brunches as well a large party! It's a great vibe with Manhattan views; it's also very reasonable (I think it's $30 dollars per person with drinks). You often walk over very full and a little tipsy. Make sure you save room for the french toast!
2019-07-14,4,My husband and I currently live in Shanghai and am visiting for the summer.  I've been craving raw oysters for months now! So, we came for their dollar oysters during happy hour.  The oysters were fantastic!  They were fresh, flavorful, and plump.  It was just what I needed.With that said, it is a more upscale location, so the rest of the menu was a bit pricy.  $3 for a tiny slider.  $7 for lamb meatballs.  Not exactly friendly prices for happy hour.  The drinks were ok.  $5 wine/beer or $7 cocktails.  All in all, I enjoyed my oysters with two glasses of bubbly.  It checked off my cravings.End result: Come here for the dollar oysters!
2019-07-12,2,I went here on a date and sat outside. It took over 30 minutes to get served, there were little bugs everywhere, which i anticipated as we were outside but I thought this place being fancy may have a lamp that attracted the little critters away. The waiter had no clue what the specials were for the day and they were inconsistent with what was written on HappyHourHoboken.com. The drinks were good but overpriced and the menu does not have enough vegetarian options. There are tons of better places to eat at in Hoboken where you get a better bang for your buck.
2019-07-09,4,I've known of Halifax for awhile but mostly just for their classy looking brunches, but I'd never been. I came with my boyfriend with no reservation and got a table outside (it was a crazy beautiful night) no problem. This place is right on the water so you can't ask for a better view with your dinner. On top of the view being amazing, we had a great dinner too. We started off with wine - they have a nice big menu to select from. We started off with the steamed clams as an appetizer and honestly couldn't get enough of the broth. I mean, the clams were amazing too, but my God, I could have gone swimming in that broth. For our mains, I usually hate getting the same thing as the other person I am eating with, but the Lobster Rigatoni sounded too good and neither of us would give it up. Okay, so to be honest, I didn't love it. It was good, but not great. I needed to add quite a bit of salt, which I usually never do. My boyfriend said the same thing. It was still a tasty dish, but next time I come, I'd try something else. Our waiter was really friendly and quick and just overall awesome. For two mains and an appetizer, our bill was around 100 with tip. (We luckily had tickets for two comped glasses of wine, so that was amazing!) But it did seem like a pricey dinner, but look where you are eating. I'd always (usually) choose to pay a little more to enjoy dinner with a view like that. I'd absolutely come back and wouldn't mind trying the infamous brunch here one day soon.
2019-07-03,1,Worst place I've eaten. Service was awful, waiter bringing food out while I'm still eating appetizers, they went back and forth with my food 2x. Ambience was terrible and food was so so
2019-07-02,5,Went to have dinner here this evening with my fiance and we were so happy with the food and service. He made a reservation for us and we arrived a bit early but we got sat right away. It's a beautiful restaurant overlooking the Hudson River and NYC. For starters we had the steamed mussels that came with bread. We both have a gluten allergy so we asked for the bread not to be on there. To our surprise though when the mussels came out they came with gluten-free bread which was such a great surprise. The mussels were so tender and covered in a delicious buttery sauce with Fresno chiles that made for a great combo. I ordered the special of the day which was local blue cod panseared served with a parmesan roasted type of potato side I forgot what Ony (the server) called it. It was so well served that not only did it look good but it tasted perfect as well. The blue cod fish was so tender and it broke off in perfectly cooked pieces. My fiance ordered the seafood risotto with out the squid because that was not gluten free. He did in fact got extra clams though in replacement of the squid. The risotto was perfectly cooked and had a flavorful taste that went very well with the shrimp, clams and mussels. Ony our server was great at checking up on us and refilling our drinks when needed. It was a great date night with the view and  the weather. We will definitely be coming back to try other dishes in the future.
2019-06-28,4,My go-to spot for happy hour or brunch or dinner with my friends who live in Jersey City/Hoboken area. The menu is eclectic, but absolutely delicious. Happy hour consists of a special cocktail of the day that never fails. The service is great. Drinks are great. Food is great. There's a beautiful view of the city. It's in the W Hotel. Nice and clean and professional.
2019-06-15,5,As a party of 14 we never expected stellar service and quality food. Blake provided phenomenal service, the food exceeded expectations and overall our experience was enjoyable. They accommodated food allergies and at the same time kept the food coming. We will definitely come back and recommend for large groups.
2019-06-10,4,Large party review only:I came here this past Sunday to celebrate my cousin's bridal shower. We had the "private" party room rental for 3 hours. First off, the space is so beautiful! The restaurant faces the Hudson River - hard to see the skyline because of the street lined trees. The hotel has valet parking which is pretty pricey, but there is a deck right across that has a flat fee of $20 on weekends which is still pricey but better than the hotel. Anyways, my SIL communicated with the manager in the weeks leading up to the shower, and the manager/owner was able to provide a special menu for us since we were ALL vegetarian. The bridal shower brunch consisted of plates like Quinoa Sliders, Roasted Potatoes, Parfait, Vegetable Pasta, and about 5 other dishes!! The food was...phenomenal. It was also a 'boozy' brunch so there was champagne as well. Unlike a regular boozy brunch, our glasses were not filled continuously which was fine in this situation since we had to keep getting up (for games, announcements, etc). Although I loved the atmosphere of a shower, I felt that it was too hectic. Plus the kitchen was in the same room, so waiters would constantly be in and out of the room so it didn't feel like a private party. As for a party of this size (there were about 35 of us), I don't recommend. But, I definitely recommend for a small group or regular dining. I would LOVE to come back for a meal with just a small group of us.
2019-06-08,4,This was a great brunch. We decided on the Boozy Brunch where we received unlimited small plates and sparkling wine. The small plates are not for each individual person but for the table to share. Good thing is that they are unlimited so if you do favor one plate more than the other you can request that as an additional plate. The French toast was my favorite small plate along with the salmon and wings.
2019-06-08,5,Marcela took great care of us and the food couldn't have been better.  Carlos the manager even came over multiple times to make sure we were all good ... which we were.  Elsa gave us table and hooked us up with a beautiful window view.  Hector and Darren also both lent a hand while Marcela was busy with a full house of happy eaters.  We shall return sooner than later -- highly recommended!
2019-06-08,3,I came here for a birthday dinner with a party of 14 and overall was disappointed. Not sure if we were just unlucky and caught them on an off night or what happened. I do have to say that the food was delicious but the overall service was just very slow and seemed not very organized especially for the amount of $$$ everything was. First when we arrived for our reservation we were notified that our table wasn't ready and would have to wait, which i thought was pretty strange. To make up for this they did offer everyone a complementary glass of champagne which was very nice. After this is was all going well until it took over 45 minutes for our food to arrive. They ended up forgetting about the Lamb Meatball appetizer and then did give us a complementary appetizer. For the main meal i had the Lobster Rigatoni, which was very yummy. By the time the main meal arrived we were all so hungry that the portion sizes seemed way to small. After the whole meal everyone still seemed to be hungry and overall just disappointed. To make up for the long wait time with the food they did give us complementary cookies and made a little birthday dessert for my friend. I would have given them less stars but because they did try to make up for all the things that went wrong I went with 3 stars. I'd like to think if I came back another time it would be a better experience but not sure if I'll be coming back.
2019-06-08,1,I am REALLY surprised this is the restaurant associated with the W hotel, as every other W I have been to has a restaurant of the highest quality food and service.I came here last night to sit outside and enjoy the view of the NYC skyline. Unfortunately, this was the only good part of the night as the location is nice.The service was painfully slow, waited forever for menus, drinks, placing the order, and food. When the food came it was cold and undercooked. I ordered the steak medium rare and it came out very rare. I only ate the outside pieces which had no flavor and tasted like a garbage diner steak. It was a poor quality cut of meat, served on cold flavorless mashed potatoes. I also got a side of the asparagus "gratin" which was pathetic and not gratin at all. It had a small, sorry dollop of cheese that had a rubbery microwaved texture, and no breadcrumbs. I also don't believe the asparagus wasn't even fresh it seemed like it originally came frozen.Halifax is not fine dining by any stretch of the imagination and was a big disappointment. Hopefully, it will eventually be replaced with a restaurant worthy of being associated with the W, as I feel Halifax is bringing down its stock.
2019-06-07,5,I was sceptical to eat here for two reasons, some of the reviews were very concerning and it was a hotel restaurant. I ordered the New York Strip Steak, cooked medium.  When the steak arrived and I cut into it I found that it was cooked perfectly. Sitting on mushroom mashed potatoes it was the perfect pairing. The menu description does not do this meal justice. I know people have different expectations and could have been here on an off night, but don't let the other reviews discourage you. As for the server, it was a Friday night so I was expecting slow service.  This was not the case.  My order was taken quickly and my food was served just as fast.  The staff was very friendly and a pleasure to be around.One last comment, dine on the patio if you have the opportunity. Dining next to the river, with the cool breeze added to the total dining experience. Enjoy.
2019-06-03,3,I just had an early dinner here today with my friend. The vibe is super cute with a great view. We were seated pretty quickly but that's when things got veryyyy slow. It took us forever to get anything, whether it was water, drinks, apps, entrees, refills. I mean they seemed really understaffed because the restaurant was less than half full. Now I wish the service was better because this would've been an EASY 5 stars. The food was amazinggg! My friend had the lobster cavatappi and I had the Sea Bream. Deliciousssss! I wish I could go back right now. But yeah, if you have time and are in the area, check it out, you won't be disappointed with the food! And hopefully the service will be quicker.
2019-05-19,5,Given location and view of city it's an excellent choice. You add the fantastic food, setting and attentive staff, and you got yourself the perfect romantic spot.
2019-05-18,2,Came here with high expectations just to be completely disappointed. Waited 15 minutes before anyone came to take our order. Then - we waited 45 minutes for any of our dishes to come.  Upper management did accommodate for the inconvenience by waiving the fee but a bit too late on a planned Friday night. Probably won't be returning here.
2019-05-12,1,Unfortunately my experience here was terrible start to finish. We arrived and was told to wait despite there being a plethora of empty tables while the hostess left and other staff began rearranging the tables. We arrived on time not early or late and felt as though a table rearrangement at this time was rather odd because we were the only people waiting... waiting for that rearrangement to complete. They sat us in the steamy dining room which desperately need the AC on while we waited for a waiter. We were finally greeted with just a question of our drink order which took about 20 minutes to arrive. Other tables received bread and popcorn and we were never offered and asked when our appetizer arrived. There was one bartender working ... only one and a bar full of people and the entire dining room of drinks. I didn't fault our waiter for this but when my entree came out as something I didn't order, I was done. So many other places to go in Hoboken-save your time and money and go elsewhere!
2019-05-12,2,Called multiple times to reserve a table, was placed on a 12 minute hold then hung up on. Thought they were maybe too busy to answer since it was a Saturday morning...arrived a few minutes later and the place was only half packed. We asked for a table for 2 and looked around, seeing at least 8 open tables, and were told they were not available and we could sit at the bar. For the entire 1.5 hours we were there, no one was seated at the empty tables while we were squished in a back bar corner with the view of a plant. We decided to do bottomless brunch of small plates and mimosas. Took 25 minutes for them to bring our first mimosa, after the first round of food had already come out. We had to ask the server if we could have more food because we sat without drinks and food for ten minutes after the first plate. The food was pretty good, but the service was just not. I understand brunch can be a busy time but the wait staff did not seem to even pay us any mind. It felt like this was a tactic so we would not be able to take advantage of the bottomless drinks and food because we were waiting around most of the time.
2019-05-03,4,I say 3.5 stars. This place is definitely the place to be for brunch. Not only for the awesome vibes but the beautiful view of the city across the river. Came here with a large party for my girlfriends birthday and the place catered to us very well. We were never short on food nor drinks. Mimosas flowing and food flying it was a great time. 3.5 because of the food. The food was okay, nothing to really rave about. I really enjoyed the deviled eggs and that's about it. Everything else was so so. Good place to grab brunch I'd say, but don't expect anything special if you're a foodie.
2019-04-28,5,I had my engagement party here and I could not have been happier with the turn out! Up until the event, the coordinator was friendly, attentive, and very accommodating. The staff made us feel comfortable and provided stellar service. The food was incredible as well. It will be a day I will always remember!
2019-04-21,2,Ate brunch there today.  Wasn't brought all the food and was pushed out.  The food that I had was good.
2019-04-20,5,For years we have stayed at the W Hotel but didn't eat at their restaurant. This visit we were tired and hadn't booked any reservations so decided to try it. We were VERY pleasantly surprised! Our food was all excellent (Caesar salads, lamb meatballs, and cauliflower flatbread for starters, and seafood risotto, sea bream, and whole branzino for entrees). Our server was also terrific, friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive.Another huge plus was that we could hear each other talk! And of course there's the very nice view.We'll be back!
2019-04-18,1,I'm not sure why there is no option to put 0 stars but I guess they just don't want to hurt your feelings. Where do I start. I came in 3x a day because I was staying in the hotel. Breakfast.... a disgusting cholesterol infested joke. Everything was extremely greasy and the service was slower than any other for it being the "W hotel". The managers don't care about the guest at all and especially their staff. All I ever saw was demanding managers enforcing their own way and technique that clearly doesn't work at all. This was a Saturday mind you and I was rushed out for brunch but they didn't tell me I had a time limit when I came in at 10:30am. Then I decided let me try lunch since it's not busy and the service was way worse. An empty restaurant and no good service? No bartender either? What is going on here? Marcella was our server and I couldn't tell if I was bothering her day or she was just a miserable soul. Also she didn't understand anything that I wanted and tried to make me feel stupid about my requests? I ate a pear salad and went about my day. Decided ok.... the dinner vibe looks way better and maybe better servers are on the floor.... didn't know I would be wrong 3x in a row..... as soon as I was seated it took about 20 minutes to get my "please don't let me be misunderstood" drink..... and the server didn't know the own special besides what they were recited to say and the worst part??? The owner or the GM walking around interjecting to our servers techniques that I was very ok with thus making me unconfortable. He had a negative energy about his controlling ways around us and I saw him lecturing our server with an abrasive attitude for no reason about anything. They told me his name was Carlos and I tried to speak to him but I didn't Matter. This whole restaurant is a huge ball of negative energy and I won't be surprised if it fails. I'm sorry for the extensive review but I feel so bad for the staff and the patrons.... looks really can be deceiving.
2019-04-13,5,Such a delicious and fun brunch! We did bottomless (food and mimosas). You get OJ and strawberry juice to mix with your champagne. The champagne is good not like the cheap stuff most other places serve when you do bottomless. They bring more of the food you like the best if you ask for it. Such a kind wait staff. One of the best brunches in Hoboken.
2019-04-12,1,Food was gross and inedible. The restaurant was quite dirty and most of the staff could barely speak English.  The Chef walked through the restaurant and we attempted to stop him to inquire about the food quality.  Unfortunately, he was too busy to be bothered. Do yourself a favor, go to the hot dog cart behind this dump.  You'll thank me later.
2019-04-12,2,I went to Halifax on a Thursday night for dinner with two of my girlfriends, and overall it was a nice meal.Halifax is located in the W Hotel, so set up to be an upscale restaurant right on the water with a beautiful view of the NYC skyline.The service was good, we were honestly rushed a bit but I was with friends I haven't seen in awhile so it was taking some time to get through our courses. The cocktail menu was different, so I went with a glass of wine instead.As for the food, it's a very health conscious restaurant offering a lot of cauliflower and light options. To be honest i didn't really love the menu, and when I'm going out to eat I want to indulge so I'm personally not a huge fan of their approach. We tried the oyster and cauliflower flat bread as an appetizer which were both just okay, nothing out of the ordinary. And for the entree we got the seafood risotto which was very tasty and was my favorite part of the meal.I do not plan on going back to Halifax but I would recommend for anyone looking for an upscale atmosphere.
2019-04-08,3,One of the best breakfasts in Hoboken.... but with the worst service. Not sure it's worth coming to any more. Don't ask for ketchup for your breakfast because you won't get it (I ask every time) Also we usually have to settle our check with the bar tender because the waiter disappears. This. Happens. Every. Time.
2019-04-07,5,The queen of all the brunch lands!$35 for bottomless champagne and 16 courses with an outstanding view of the Manhattan skyline! This place is doing everything right. Our server was excellent, we were seated promptly at our reservation time, and the food was timed perfectly. 16 courses follow an appropriate timeline from light and easy, to denser and more filling. It allowed me to try items I wouldn't normally order from a regular menu. Everything was delicious including, shockingly, beet tartar on crunchy bread. You guys...I hate vegetables. That's really saying something. Yays: French toast with this amazing coffee-like whipped cream, corned beef hash in a mini pan with a perfectly poached eggNays: parking was difficult but this is Hoboken, and I thought it was weird they needed my credit card to make a reservation
2019-04-06,1,Been here a few times for brunch and had a pleasant experience. Went again today with a group of 8 and the service was horrendous. 45 minutes into sitting down for our two hour all you can eat and drink brunch we had two of the items on the menu with no more food in sight. I suspect the horrible service was due to the guaranteed service charge for a big group but today was unacceptable and I will not be returning. I was even thinking about having my bridal shower here but after seeing the service provided to big groups I will definitely be going elsewhere.
2019-04-03,3,One of the best places to dine with a view. When you enter, the restaurant is picturesque with modern and aesthetic decorations. And once you're seated, you get a great view of the Hudson River and NYC skyline.Are here for a late lunch wth a friend. We both got the Halifax Burger - very delicious and decadent. I especially liked the bacon-onion marmalade and Fresno pepper sauce. However, both burgers were extremely overcooked as me and my friend ordered medium and medium rare respectively and the burger was definitely well done. The salad accompanying the burger was a disappointment - soggy, bitter, and bland.Overall, will return for the view and another try at the menu. We came at an odd time on a weekday so service was slow and could've been better. I hope to return for a better experience.
2019-04-01,2,We couldn't get a reservation for Sunday brunch but wanted to experience the ambiance and the view anyway so chose to go for breakfast at 9:30am. I've had better breakfasts just about anywhere else; it was nothing special at all. View is great as is the atmosphere. Would definitely try it for brunch based on reviews. Bright side was it was not as expensive as hotels usually are, so all in all, it wasn't the end of the world to have a mediocre breakfast. One other note...while we were assured when making the reservation that we could stay past 11am (the start of brunch), at 11am they told us they needed our table. I am from Florida (former Hoboken resident) and my four friends drove in from four separate towns about an hour away. Luckily we went to sit in the lobby, but it was not cool getting kicked out, especially when we were told that wouldn't happen.
2019-03-31,4,Great Sunday brunch deal with unlimited tapas for $25 per person and $10 for kids.  Add $10 per person for campaign/mimosa.Staff was extra attentive with a great waterfront view.  Great find for a family of 4 here for vacation on the East Coast.  Corned beef and egg, Seafood Paella and Mushroom Mac and Cheese are must tries.
2019-03-30,5,Halifax has an excellent view by the Hoboken waterfront featuring the sparkling hudson river and locals walking along the water. Their brunch option includes an unlimited selection of small plates. It was excellent for a party because there is so much of it to go around! It also included so much flowing champagne with both orange and strawberry juices to mix in. The cuisine was fantastic and I definitely ate too much. My favorites were the maple french toast but there were healthy selections too. We were a party of 18 total people and everyone was perfectly accommodated. People were able to request more of anything we wanted. Small plates are great because you can try a lot of different types of food throughout your meal. They do set a time limit on it, but chances are nobody will be hungry before you leave
2019-03-25,5,This restaurant is amazing!!! I just held my daughter's baby shower for the Bubbles Brunch. Right from the start, the Assistant Manager, Maria, greeted us for our appointment, listened to our requests, made great suggestions, communicated efficiently and oversaw every last detail of our special day. This beautiful venue serves amazing food that looks as good as it tastes. A wonderful variety of selections and champagne poured all morning! Our guests were raving about the whole experience. The staff, servers, and everyone at the hotel are professionals. The W Hotel is a special place and I would highly recommend it. Can't wait to visit again. Thank you!
2019-03-16,4,Great place. Very good food.  Easy access in and out.  Fantastic views of NYC.  Easy access to NYC via the nearby Path station.  Good vibe.  The waitress was clearly inexperienced and could have used a shadow to help her a bit but it was not a problem.
2019-03-14,4,Came here for a friends brunch and loved the decor and rustic but super modern vibe. The server was making sure our glasses were always filled which was great and the food was non stop although in small portions. The ceviche was okay but the French toast was to die for and I'd go back for the that alone!
2019-03-09,3,Was nice, conveniently located at the hotel where we were staying in Hoboken, food and wine was good, but overpriced and service was very slow even though they weren't that busy at all.  Also, it was too bright for a dinner time setting.
2019-02-27,5,This is if not the best resturant in Hoboken. Amazing views but especially the service is espectacular. I went for Brunch where it was all reserved but the manager made accommodations and sat us down with no reservation. The place is well managed and customer service is a 10 . The food is amazing as well with endless mimosas. Don't think twice ! And enjoy brunch or any other night .
2019-02-27,4,Nice eatery attached to the W Hotel in Hoboken.  I was pleased there was on street parking and valet and onsite parking if needed.The restaurant was nicely decorated with exposed brick, square tables with comfy chairs, floor to ceiling windows with oriented to the east for views of the Hudson River and the NYC skyline. The menu had plenty of offerings for vegetarians and carnivores alike.   We enjoyed the soup of the day, the battered fish, the quinoa and kale salad, the grilled cheese.  Everyone was satisfied with the food and the portions.The service was excellent!  The waitstaff was knowledgeable and patient and gave us space to eat without unnecessary intrusion.  They helped us make some substitutions and were very helpful. There is no carpet in the dining area  and consequently sound carried loudly and the space was cool and not cozy and warm.   It was sometimes hard to hear each other speak around the table.We made a reservation very easily through the yelp app. The Hostess was lovely to deal with when we got to the restaurant. We would certainly go there to eat again.
2019-02-26,4,Ahh sooo many good things to say about Halifax! Mostly being that the setting and ambiance of the whole place made my experience great along with the company I had. Comfy chairs, high ceilings along with the exposed open windows overlooking manhattan NY. I really felt like I was having brunch brunch. Lol. Let talk about the food! My group and I all did bubbles brunch which came with unlimited small plates of whatever was on the menu and a bottle of sparkling wine. Not necessarily a bottle of wine cause the servers just came around each table and kept refilling our glass if it looked low. Also came with a bottle of guava and orange juice already on the table. To make it easy for us and the servers, they brought out all the food that was on the menu and if there was a dish that we really liked, we could just order it again. Keep in mind that brunch is only for 2 hours for whatever time you reserved it for so make sure you keep on ordering! Food! (Small plates and I mean mini) Prepare for this to be long.-yogurt parfait with strawberry rhubarb, almond granola and berries. Great starter but a little too tart imo.-fruit salad with melons, pineapple and strawberries. Fresh and we're cut up into nice small pieces. Perfect for babies or small children to eat. -arugula and squash salad made with apples, Gorgonzola and apple cider vinaigretteNot a big fan of arugula but I loved how they prepared the salad. Vinaigrette was delicious. -deviled eggs (smoked herring, scallions and garlic chips) Sooooo good. My fav dish. Yolk was so creamy! Ordered 3 plates. My bf loved it! -challah French toast topped with maple whipped cream and almonds. Another fav. Literally ordered 3 plates of it. What is in that cream sauce? Currently drooling thinking about it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND -ham and eggs (poached egg, potatoes, ham and onion) Egg was super poached and oozed out nicely after cutting it with my fork. Potatoes complimented it very well. -Halifax smoked salmon with rye toast, cream cheese, scallion and capers A nice blend of crunch, salty and smoothness in your mouth. So goooodddd.-potato poutine with cheddar cheese curds and sherry gravy Cheese kinda got hard and the potatoes were stuck together not making it have that gooey effect. Wasn't really my fav. -mushroom bisque made with creme fraiche and chivesKinda salty for my taste but my friends loved it and ordered more of it. -seafood paella with shrimp, mussels, clams, saffron and tomatoes It came in a little Chinese take out box that was so cute! Flavor was good but a little bit salty. -mushroom Mac n cheese made with smoked Gouda and leeks? It was so cheesy. I personally like it a lot. Ordered another one. Lol -beef sliders (brioche bun, bacon onion marmalade and white cheddar) Was kinda dry. Would've been perfect if cooked at medium rare -beet brioche with goat cheese and dillIt was surprisingly good. The beet was served 2 ways and gave it a good texture with the bread. -warm croissant (pancetta, jack cheese, arugula pesto, pickled peppers) Also really good. Flavors married well together. CONGRATULATIONS! You've made it to the end of the review!  If you made it this far you're a real one. All in all this place had to probably be one of the best brunches I've ever been to. A little bit pricey but well worth it in my option cause I left feeling so full. The service was great as well. Definitely recommend coming here and make sure to make a reservation if you do!
2019-02-16,5,One of my favorites for meeting with friends and date nights. I've been for breakfast, dinner, drinks and always have been very happy with the delicious food and impeccable service.  And you can't beat those views!
2019-02-14,5,*This review is for BRUNCH only*Best brunch in Hoboken if you are looking for bottomless hands down. As soon as you sit down a waiter immediately comes to the table to explain how their brunch works and asks if you are adding bottomless. For all the champagne you get, it is definitely worth it to add! The food is fantastic and you get a great portion of each item, of course you can also ask for more of your favorite. The food itself is a mix of savory and sweet and everything came out with enough timing in between so that you can enjoy each. I truly think you get your money's worth all around, not to mention the staff being super nice and very attentive. A great place to celebrate something special or just get together with friends. We were a table of four but there were plenty of large groups, as well. Highly recommend!
2019-02-11,5,I went to Halifax Sunday for brunch after staying a night at the W hotel. I have to say this brunch is an absolute must. I have been to many brunches and this is truly like no other. Basically it is unlimited food and unlimited champagne. Customer service was absolutely wonderful, very polite and nice. They were quick to bring out more plates that were requested (they bring every item on the brunch menu to the table one piece for each person and you are welcome to ask for more of whatever you really liked) don't let the 'small plates' fool you, we all left extremely stuffed and extremely satisfied. Everything is so tasty.A++++++++Was a wonderful end to my birthday weekend.
2019-02-06,2,I ordered room service from Halifax 3 nights in a row due to my busy work schedule and was disappointed every night. The prices are ridiculous for the food they give you, and the food in general is disgusting. I had the mushroom pizza which literally felt and tasted like cardboard - I could not even finish more than 2 slices. It barely had any cheese and was completely over cooked and had no flavor. The curried soup was okay but as it cooled down, you could tell it wasn't fresh. I also had the grilled cheese another night and it was too oily and full of cheese for my taste. Lastly, the flourless chocolate cake was okay which is why I give this place two stars.
2019-02-06,5,Halifax is probably the nicest restaurant in all of Hoboken! Whether you are celebrating a special occasion or just want to splurge a bit, Halifax is your place to eat in Hoboken. The cheese plate is a fantastic starter! Halifax also has delicious soups that they change up daily. For the main course, I always order one of their salads and add meat to it (their salmon is amazing!). Halifax is pretty empty during lunchtime on work days, so don't worry about making a reservation if that's when you are going. The ambiance of the restaurant is really classy, so don't dress like a bum! The river side of the restaurant is mostly glass wall, which means you can see the full New York City skyline while you eat - no complaints at all about that.
2019-02-03,4,I was here for brunch just yesterday and all in all it was a great experience. the location is lovely, stationed by the W hotel and with a beautiful view of the NYC skyline. The space felt very airy and light, and the music was low but just the right amount!We had the family style Bubbles Brunch, which was diverse and yummy. It definitely had something for everyone. I tasted almost everything on our menu and i didn't have any complaints. From the Mac and cheese, the the mushroom soup, poutine, paella and smoked salmon. Nothing out of the ordinary but great nonetheless. One thing I would say is that amount of food is not filling, but it might just be the style of brunch we chose. This is a good spot for big groups, you will have fun. The champagne was super good and everyone was tipsy at the end.
2019-01-31,5,In December I had my birthday brunch here with 20 of my girlfriends. The staff was so accommodating. (My friends are always late. ) The food was phenomenal and it just kept coming. My one girlfriend lives in Indiana and can't wait to visit so we can brunch again. I'll definitely be returning.
2019-01-26,5,You must come here for brunch. The end.  Nothing else to say. Imagine endless food and champagne.
2019-01-19,3,Food is mediocre to good service is terrible and its a shame beautiful spot great views valet parking Location couldn't be better if they tried I have lived in the area for 11 years always hoping that something good would go in there
2019-01-14,2,Hm - where to start. The two stars 'meh, I've experienced better' review fit more perfectly than a one star, because I know that Halifax has the potential to be one of the best restaurants in Hoboken (although I'm still trying to figure out what stars need to be aligned in order to experience it). I'd been here before tonight with my girlfriend on a Thursday night, and we enjoyed the meal - the scallops were excellent, the clams were decent, etc etc etc. We were hoping that we could have a repeat of a decent night tonight after enjoying some drinks in the hotel lobby - an effort that proved to be futile.With that in mind we decided to come here tonight with family for her birthday dinner and I've got to say - the service was tragically awful. The seafood? Not much better. Took 30 minutes to get drinks, lamb meatballs were cold, and the plating and bussing of the table reminded me of a toddler who sporadically moves stuff around their high chair table indiscriminately with no rhyme or reason. The mussels and the oysters were very fishy - I tried to tell her to read one famously deceased celebrity chef's late 90's article in the New Yorker before booking a 7 person birthday party at a Hoboken hotel's seafood restaurant on a Monday but hey, what do I know. Needless to say, Mr. Bourdain (RIP) was right.They clearly had the B team running the place tonight - and it showed. Cold food, not-in-the-good-way aged drinks (didn't see Angel behind the bar this time), busboys who took a plate at a time, and round after round of 4 day old seafood diminished a decent ribeye special and tasty ricotta cavatelli. The smoked chicken? Unidentifiable under the half pound of what may as well had been the vertically slanted patch of grass just outside the door where the good people of Hoboken allow their pets to relieve themselves.Sadly, the usually trusted recommendations of good friends who swore by this place will evermore go unheeded, as the erasure of a decent first date night at Halifax has been completed. Now, only the finger-crossing that we escape the next 12 hours without contracting some fringe ciguatera induced seafood poisoning remains. Truly great restaurants have a certain reliability to them - that you can pick any night of the week to stop by. That place that you get a certain pride out of recommending to a family of loved ones for a special evening. They are places that no matter what happens, you won't leave feeling disappointed - or at the least, you won't leave feeling like the food has made you nauseous. Unfortunately, Halifax does not fall into that category.
2019-01-14,4,Excellent food and amazing service... And you can't beat the view of the NYC skyline. Smoked Amish chicken with greens was quite succulent. Scallop crudo was fresh and delicately flavored. Nice lamb meatballs. Salt cod and shrimp fritters were my favorite appy.  Wait staff was perfect. Friendly, professional and with perfect timing.  Only tiny bit of criticism is that the ambient music doesn't match the vibe. Hipster music doesn't gel with the setting... Not with any romantic date or dinner with coworkers someone might otherwise enjoy.
2019-01-05,5,Went to Halifax to celebrate 3 January birthdays in our family and we had an amazing dining experience! -the weather was perfect and we had a table with a breathtaking view of NYC- the food was not only delicious but the chef had an interesting take on each dish...delicious and well presented -the staff from the person who sat us, the waiters and manager were outstanding I totally recommend Halifax for a relaxing evening out or special event.
2018-12-26,3,Food was good overall compared to the priceWe enjoyed ossobuco and lobster pasta with steamed clamsServer was little slow but was flexible and niceBut the manager i am not sure with the namevery tall african-american middle-aged guy was making the vibe in the restaurant more awkward byWalking around in the dining room talking to the random guests but only giving attentions to tables with white people( there were 2 tables with asians and rest 4 tables were white )Maybe i am sensitive than others but it was clear that only two tables including mine was out of his interestWe were never asked if everything is fine after receiving the entree' plus our water glass was empty until we asked for bottle of waterIt was just little off with everything
2018-12-22,3,I love Halifax, especially their brunch. But, please watch out if you have an allergy like me, especially to tree nuts or anything along the deadly category of allergies. My boyfriend and I went together for brunch and it was delicious! Per usual. The waiter was a sweetheart but he got one thing very wrong.He told me he was 100% positive there were no nuts in the pesto and how the chef changed the recipe due to people with nut allergies. So, I was excited and ate the bread with pesto and proscuitto (delicious). Well, it had nuts in it! Specifically, pine nuts. Thankfully not a tree nut or else I would have needed my boyfriend to stab me with my epi pen. Nonetheless, I got extremely nauseous and felt so sick due to the pine nuts. It was horrible. I took benedryl right away. All in all, always triple check and ask when you have a severe allergy that can literally kill you.Management comped my part of the bill, but that does not change the fact that I could have been put in the hospital or worse. Communication is a big thing in the restaurant business.
2018-12-17,5,Loved this spot. Great view and wall to wall windows and lots of natural light. We didn't have the buffet but ordered off the menu instead. The smoked salmon Benedict was to die for and the egg white frittata was delicious. Would highly recommend this spot for brunch to anyone visiting the area!!
2018-12-14,4,Rarely do all-you-can-eat brunches or bottomless deals pan out--either the food isn't great, or the spotty service makes the "unlimited" a hollow promise. Halifax most definitely delivers.We made reservations for a Saturday morning (highly recommend) and were seated on time.The food here is very good - winning on both quantity and quality. Plenty of options to suit everyone's liking - veg & non, conventional continental fare & more creative preparations, etc. And the staff make sure your table is always full and your glass is always topped off, an absolute pleasure.The ambiance is awesome: waterfront view of the city, trendy decor, lots of open space and natural light. Ideal for meetups or dates; probably not the best if you've got small kids or picky eaters, though.It's not on any "places to dine before you die" lists or anything, but Halifax is really good as far as bottomless brunches go. If you're in the area or a short hop away in Manhattan, it's worth heading over.
2018-11-25,5,Love the brunch at Halifax. Fun to go here with a group, great ambiance and city view, tasty good, and mimosas! What more could you ask for at brunch
2018-11-23,3,I really would have wanted to give this place 5 stars because it could have been great but the service was not the best. When u make a reservation u have to be there at that time exactly and they give you two hours. It doesn't matter if u arrive late ur reservation starts the time u make it and if ur late they they practically kick u out when ur over ur 2 hour limit. We had to ask for plates several times and they were never brought out. They took away plates we were still eating and we brought a cake to celebrate a friends birthday which they brought out late and a few of our friends were in the restroom which was incredibly rude. And we brought our own candles which they did not put on the cake when they brought it out. we had to ask them to bring the cake back, put our candles on it and bring it back out. Then regardless of their mistake they told us to leave 2 minutes after they served the cake. It could have been great but they need to improve their service
2018-11-21,5,One of the best restaurants in the New York City metropolitan area! Awesome locally fresh food (the lamb shank was from a central NJ farm, the salad was to die for),  excellent chef, friendly, attentive and courteous service,  spectacular NYC views, great value. Can't wait to return!
2018-11-17,4,The location, service and decor are great.  It's a little pricey for the area.  The food was above average but not five stars
2018-11-14,3,I had such high hopes for this place but left slightly disappointed. I made a reservation to celebrate my birthday here 3.5 weeks in advance, because I've heard how amazing brunch is. They only had two times left, which wasn't a big deal. So I picked 1:45 instead of 2:00. We were sat right away which was great and they kept the champagne flowing which I was happy about. My biggest complaint is that for the $32 bubbles brunch you are suppose to be brought every type of small plate to try. Then you can choose which ones you want more of. We never received two of those small plates and we asked 3 different staff moments, including our waiter to have them brought to our table. We never received them, despite asking multiple times and multiple people. It may not seem like a big deal but for the price I was paying I would've liked to try all that they had to offer. Besides that the food was good! I will most likely come back and hope to have a better experience, where I can try everything.
2018-11-05,4,Great place with good atmosphere and relaxed but upscale vibe. We've had some mistakes in past orders and the management and staff has been super helpful resolving and making amends. Everyplace has a mistake here and there, but those that correct like Halifax are rare and their commitment to excellent service really stands out. Deserts and wine list are the best! The only place we regularly eat out with for dinner in Hoboken and the best in town by a mile
2018-10-24,5,I have been looking to find the parsnip purée recipe that I surprisingly fell in love with here since I have a very simple pallet and normally don't enjoy "different" cuisines. But Halifax's environment is open, charming, and their waiters Paolo and Oni are an absolute joy to chat with and watch them interact.
2018-10-18,5,We just had our sons first birthday at Halifax and I have to say we were quite impressed! Their staff was beyond accommodating to all of our little needs, super friendly and very helpful! The space is fantastic super light and airy. People raved about the food! Maria the coordinator was super sweet and worked with us on everything. The tables were kept clean and waters filled (pet peeve of mine). I would def recommend this space to everyone!
2018-10-17,1,Happy Hour Review.The good. Beautiful setting with nice ambiance and a ​great view of the Manhattan skyline.The bad. The food is average at best. The Chef is one lucky guy! We ordered the happy hour wine special and they charged us 3 times per glass so be very careful with the waitresses.Recommendation: Go and experienced it by yourself and then write a review of your own experience!
2018-10-17,5,Did someone say bottomless brunch?! I came here with a bridesmaids party and we sat at their sunny corner booth that seated 9 comfortably. The place was packed with many birthdays/showers/brunch parties going on that Saturday afternoon. The interiors were beautifully done, with robin egg blue furniture and soft birchwood throughout the space. Halifax is also connected to the lovely W Hotel.The Bubbles Brunch for $32 pp meant the bubbly kept flowing and food was plentiful! We couldn't finish all the small plates set in front of us. Challah French Toast with maple whipped cream & sliced almonds was my favorite, perfectly crisp with a soft eggy innard. It begged to be doused in the light whipped cream. Gravlax on rye toast and the Deviled Eggs with paprika were classic dishes and also delicious.They offered lighter fare like the Mixed Fruits Salad and a Summer Farro Salad with tangerine slices. Nice and refreshing between bites of more savory dishes, which is ultimately what I kept going back for! Mac & Cheese with orecchiette pasta was so creamy and luscious. Beef Sliders were juicy and flavorful. The brunch was a great mix of savory and sweet, with something to please every palate.Halifax's waterfront locale is also great for an after-meal photo op. Hoboken doesn't offer as good a view as Weehawken slightly north, but still nice. It's also a great middle point for those that live in NYC and NJ to do brunch together right!
2018-10-15,3,Quite decent for the hotel... the time I went while staying in the W was enjoyable. When I went I did not have to make a reservation and was able to sit immediately. I ordered a starter of oysters and had the steak. As expected, the prices were on the higher end. But overall a good experience. I am giving 3 instead of 4 stars because I came during happy hour and was not even offered the happy hour menu which probably would've have been better since I was just by myself. I suppose you have to ask to see the happy hour menu. But it would have saved me about $25 since I paid full price for the wine. Overall was happy to try it but more likely to venture out in Hoboken rather than coming again.
2018-10-14,5,Just some of the AMAZING offerings from the brunch menu!! Went with 7 girls for a friends birthday and the service, food, drinks, ambiance was outstanding!!! Could not have asked for better. Pablo was an outstanding waiter. He also compd the birthday girls brunch, took pictures for our group and was just overall attentive. Best part? Unlimited food was $23! You can literally eat anything you'd like for 2 hours, with a view of the Hudson for $23! Bottomless brunch is $35! Recommend 100%!
2018-09-30,2,Has gone downhill the last few times we've been here. Lots of people working but took forever for someone to come and take our order. Then two simple egg dishes took at least 20 min to arrive and by the time they did the food was cold and hollandaise was curdled. Had to finally ask for silver ware (which didn't arrive until after the meals) and water. Basically not treated as customers more of a bother. It may have to do with the timing we got there just before 10am. Similar service last time we were there with the added issue of ants all over the table because of the plants that were out. Had to mention to three different waiters before someone came to help. Added a picture of how the eggs were delivered.
2018-09-20,2,The food was good but the service was SO RIDICULOUSLY SLOW. Y'all need to hire more chefs or something. We did brunch on a Sunday and you get a 2 hour limit. We shouldn't have been waiting until LITERALLY the last half hour of our time limit to get all our dishes. Ridiculosus.
2018-09-10,4,Overall great experience with their bottomless brunch. Our glasses were never empty of Prosecco, however, we did have to keep asking for the mixers. Food was absolutely amazing and they make sure to bring enough for at least everyone at your table to try one (we had 6 that day).  After you try everything, you can ask for extras of your favorites. There are definitely things on the menu that you will order multiple times and other things you could do without. Beautiful space too!
2018-09-08,5,Brunch is the best one in Hoboken. Small plates, great food, prix fixe, with unlimited seconds. Fantastic!
2018-09-05,5,Came here last Monday for my Anniversary dinner with my husband, everyone was very friendly and smiley. We order the poached shrimp appetizer which was deliciously fresh and I ordered the scallops entree and my husband the cod dish. Both were very tasty and enjoyed to the last bite. Our  server Rachel, I believe was her name was awesome.  She was very friendly, knowledgeable about the food and made our experience great. Will be back for sure!
2018-09-03,1,Good luck grabbing their attention! you'd get upset even before you get your food. Expect to wait 15 minutes until someone comes to your table and greets. The waitress seems like it was her first day, another 15 min to get your water or soda. Food wasn't even good, for my shrimp slider, the buns were soaked with oil. Took me forever to get the check, another 20 min until they PICK UP your payment. This place is a joke, can't believe a restaurant like this belongs to a hotel. Will never go back.
2018-08-26,4,Came here for dinner with my boyfriend. Service was awesome from the hostess to the waiter to the buzz-boy. Place is nice with great view and the food was delicious. We'll come back again.
2018-08-21,3,came here for dinner for our anniversary. was good but wasn't blown away. service was fast and they served warm bread/butter. drinks were good. as a person who has a nut allergy the menu was limiting as many things had pine nuts or pesto:/ i had the seafood bowl-came with a few mussels, baby shrimp and octopus. flavor was decent but I wouldve like fresh crab/lobster in the dish. wasn't terrible but wasn't amazing either.
2018-08-20,4,Came here for a brunch birthday party!! Halifax is located in the W hotel in Hoboken, literally 15 minutes from the city/world trade center about 5 minutes walk from Hoboken train station. Halifax has a beautiful waterfront view of the Hudson River. They have a prefix brunch menu that lasts for about 2 hour with unlimited champagne. They served several small portion of all different types of food. My favorite was the eggs served with scallion and a splash of red pepper. It literally melted in my mouth and left a nice after taste! Yummy!Their french toast was buttery and buried in fresh syrup. It left me wanting more.My absolute favorite was the garlic and broccoli fried rice. It was served in this little box where you can eat directly from it. They kept pouring the champagne my way!! I loved that!!The staff were bubbly and super friendly! Beautiful place to spend quality time with good friends and enjoy the splendid waterfront view on a Sunday funday!
2018-08-05,4,Great location! I luv the w and Hoboken overall to visit! Service was impeccable from the moment we walked in. Food was very flavorful and drinks refreshing. We had a great anniversary dinner.
2018-08-04,4,Went here for brunch. Purchased the 22$ all you can eat deal (my lady got the 32$ all you can eat w champagne). All i can say is BOUJIE!! I have never felt so elegant... Drake - Gods Plan played and I knew I was at the right place at the right time. It was gods plan!
2018-07-29,1,So upset with this business. Tried to celebrate my friend's birthday and called to make a reservation for two a day in advance. They informed me that they were booked and did not have reservations available however the bar was available first come first serve. Ok no prob, understandable. I SPECIFICALLY asked if we could arrive at 12.30 and wait for a bar seat. Yes they said no problem. Great! Day of my friends B Day and I called to see how long for a wait for the bar and SUDDENLY, they aren't seating anyone after noon. Nothing, no service. We went just hoping to get a seat anywhere, and their response was to many reservations at 2PM and the kitchen can't handle any more orders. Mind you it was 12:45 and the place was half empty. They REFUSED us service cause the KITCHEN can't handle serving. WHAT!!! I have worked in the restaurant business for YEARS and never would any restaurant turn away business cause the kitchen can't handle it. Maybe a wait, understandable. I even offered to be done by two and they refused. Never have I ever been refused service because the kitchen can't handle it. I wanted to show my friend a great time for her birthday and raved about this place but never again will I go there. They obviously could care less about customers. We went to Del Friscos instead which was SO much better!!! Don't do it! Go to Del Friscos!!!
2018-07-29,1,Was excited for Halifax brunch but when asking the hostess for a table she told us that the restaurant is not seating anyone for the rest of the day. There were about a dozen tables open and people getting ready to leave. They even had tables open outside but when I asked about those tables, they said "we are not sitting people there because we don't want anyone getting sunburnt". To me, it sounds like terrible management that is afraid of serving it's customers during peak hours. Will never be coming here again because of the terrible excuses to not seat someone. What kind of business are you running here?
2018-07-26,4,Across from the Hudson so the views are great. Cute/Chic/Modern interior. The food is really yummy and the menu changes often. Pretty hard to get reservations so I would recommend trying to book 2 weeks in advance for a weekend reservation. Would highly recommend as a brunch spot.
2018-07-25,4,Hit up Halifax for restaurant week lunch. I had the hazelnut salad and pork Milanese sandwich. The salad was ok but that sandwich was awesome! Crispy battered pork cutlets with sweet peppers drizzles in a mayo aioli and some great spiced home fries. The portions were very generous and I was able to take home half of it for more chowing fun later on. Great joint w a great view!
2018-07-23,3,Very disappointing changes to the menu. I ordered some staple items that I always order - clam chowder, shrimp cocktail (poached), a salad... so what happened here? Soup had no flavor at all, potatoes were hard/raw and instead of smoked ham I had anchovies and oil over the top of my soup. No salt or flavor. On to the NJ pear salad - way too salty, inedible to both parties at the table. The shrimp cocktail that was supposed to be served w a mustard tartar and cocktail was served with a green flavorless sauce, cocktail and more oil. The shrimp also had a smokey flavor. If I wanted smoke I would go to a BBQ pit. I wanted shrimp cocktail, poached, with a mustard sauce. Nice they comped it but I'm still paying $100 for a few bites of a chick pea fritter (that was good although not in the shape or texture of a "fritter") and two Smokey shrimp. Anyway, we will be avoiding Halifax for now. Update your menus so patrons don't expect their favorites here and if you want to be a smoke house then tell people you're a smokehouse. Not interested. Waiters should be better prepared to explain changes.
2018-07-23,4,Went here it last weekend with some friends.   Great spirits and house cocktails.   Service was ok but not the best.  But you cannot beat the view!!!  Good but not the best.  Worth a visit.
2018-07-21,2,Solid brunch. Great value. I wish they would let you pick so their isn't any wastage, I didn't eat some of the items because of allergies. I was never asked about allergies and it all came out anyway. Food was above average to average. Disappointing when you recognize the Trader Joe's everything bagel spice on one of the dishes. Bartender needs work. I was their 3 hrs before I got a glass of water, I asked every 45 min. I started with the bottomless, ok if you like more sugar than in prosecco. I changed and ordered a $300 bottle of wine. She never checked on me for how the food was and even said "I keep seeing your empty glass and ignoring you". She was on her phone a lot and never once smiled. I'm in the industry and super forgiving but she took it a little too far. I always tip full freight on wine (20% min) but it wasn't warranted in this case. I tipped 75% for the bottomless price and nothing on the bottle. I'm writing this because I like the concept but service needs work.
2018-07-21,1,A friend and I met for dinner a drinks here recently. We were told that the outside seating closed at 11PM, due to Hoboken law. They sat us outside around 10:25 and we waited about 15 minutes before anyone came to our table to take our order. When my friend's food finally came out, at 11PM, the manager came over to tell us that we could not eat outside. We explained to him how we waited awhile to be seated and then for someone to come and take our order and he was very apologetic and accommodating. He moved us inside and comped a glass of wine. While we sat, chatting, the staff began their clean up procedures. The manager came to our table and told us that we were welcome to stay, however the staff had duties to complete and would be working around us. When we were leaving, we both stopped in the bathroom. The wall next to the bathroom is paperthin and you can hear everything that is said in the kitchen. We heard the staff talking about us. They were saying very inappropriate and hurtful things. They commented on our looks negatively, as well as, what type of girls they thought we were (commenting that we thought we were better than other people, in more inappropriate terms). I have never felt so disrespected by an establishment before.
2018-07-20,1,Terrible place.service was rude and painfully slow. Food is average at best and not worth the pain the staff is inflicting on their customers...
2018-07-11,3,The view of the city is amazing! Unfortunately, the best part of our meal was the popcorn and bread at the start (ah-ma-zing bread and butter) and our glasses of rose. We all had fish, but the portions were tiny for the price, and it didn't seem too fresh.I'd probably go back for a drink!
2018-07-10,1,Recently came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and as soon as we walked in we were seated outside. We waited almost 15 minutes for someone to come to our table and no one ever did so we walked out. The restaurant was not that busy. They had a bridal shower going on inside and maybe 8 people sitting at the bar. The tables outside was not full, maybe 6 tables with people while the other side was empty. There is no explanations to why no one ever made it to our table. We saw 3 waiter walked by and no one ever asked if we were being taken care of. I'm really disappointed as I've been wanting to try this restaurant for months and now I will never come back.
2018-07-08,4,Very good place to eat. Came here unexpectedly and to my own luck there was no wait time. Overall great experience. I would say that the food is a little over priced but it's at the waterfront in Hoboken so I'll take that with a grain of salt. Food was great so was the staff and drinks. Music was played at a perfect level and staff came by just enough to check in on us where we didn't feel abandoned and we weren't bothered constantly.
2018-07-08,3,Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. The restaurant is very pretty with a great bar. Wooden and modern and airy. Great wine glasses :) The service was a little - slow. This was strange given then restaurant was at like 20% capacity. That said, the wine by the glass, cocktails and beer selection was on point. The food was also above average. The trout tartare was good - but too many ingredients. The lamb meatballs were excellent. The cod and shrimp fritters were solid as were he chickpea fritters. The lobster rigatoni was excellent with big fresh pieces of lobster. The lamb cavatelli was good but too salty. The Apple fritters and blueberry crumble and chocolate torte were all very good. The bread rolls were awesome. It's pricey but the food is high quality. I've heard the smoked items are good. Would have given four stars for a little more attentive and alert service. The space is beautiful and they've got valet parking.
2018-07-08,5,Really great deal with friendly waiters and great prices. You pay $32 and they give you unlimited mimosas and unlimited small portions of food. The ambiance is upscale but not to a point where you would feel uncomfortable showing up in jeans. The waiters are very nice and are good at keeping up with you and checking in. Andres is the best though, he's attentive, friendly and always ensures that we are having a great experience. I give this place 5 starts lol which I never do!
2018-07-07,3,Good but not great. Came for dinner on a quiet Tuesday night and our service was painfully slow. Took 15 minutes after we ordered to get our 2 glasses of wine. Bread and popcorn did not come out until after our appetizer was served. Just had to wait extra long for everything!All of the food we ordered was very tasty and fresh! Salad dressed perfect, and short rib cooked perfectly. Was a little deceived, however, with how the short rib was presented. We were expecting it to be hot, not cold. Overall would come back to sit outside.
2018-07-05,1,Save your money and get your meal from one of the food trucks lined up across from this restaurant (while they do leave the view relatively unobstructed, if you ignore this review and chose to eat at Halifax, I would not recommend dining al fresco unless you want to subject yourself to the constant noise and exhaust from said trucks).Our party of 7 dined here on July 4th and were sorely disappointed.  Service, while very friendly and polite, was inefficient and scattered and took way too long and this while the restaurant was at about 25% capacity.   We had to ask numerous times for bread and beverages;  some of our food didn't even make it out of the kitchen.  The waiter offered to bring us one of our apps during our main course. Pass. The food itself was also subpar.  I ordered the Butter Lettuce Salad with honey-sherry vinaigrette dressing.  I had to look long and hard for the promised hazelnuts.  I found tiny bits crouching in fear under the dry lettuce. One member of our party ordered the shoe leather, uh sorry, I mean the short ribs.  M Bethens Jr. ordered the scallops with inkhorn wheat 'risotto', herb pesto, swiss chard, pine nuts and hen of the woods mushrooms, but omitted the scallops.  What she received was something inedible that resembled pesto oatmeal without the pine nuts or mushrooms and a big, fat chard leaf resting on top, as if to hide the travesty that was below.Don't forget, $9 for a few potato wedges.  And for the coup de grace, misrepresented valet parking prices.    You'd do better off at your local Panera or Chop't.PS: The rolls were tasty.  The popcorn for the table (brought before the rolls) was way too twee for me.
2018-07-01,3,~ Free parking for two hours~ Unlimited ChampagneCame here for a brunch party! They have a pre fixed menu where they bring out small portions of all the items listed on the menu. Whichever plate you enjoy more you can always order more of it.I personally like all the small plates. The baked Mac and Cheese seemed to be my party's favorite. They give out little jars of orange juice and strawberry pure for your Champagne. I thought both mixes were good.The only thing that threw me off was the heat in the place. We weren't sure where the air conditioning was that day but boy were we hot!Staff was friendly. Bathrooms were clean. Ambiance was casual and the views were spectacular as you can see right across the Hudson River.
2018-06-29,5,We live nearby so it is our to go place if we want a nice dinner, bubble brunch or just a glass of wine! They have an excellent one choice that pairs well with the food. Service in general quite good, the menu is simple but everything tastes wonderful!
2018-06-29,4,I've eaten brunch 4 times here for their Bubbles Brunch. For the money that is being paid ($32), there is an ample amount of unlimited food and champagne--such a good deal! The quality of the food is above average. The atmosphere is busy, fun, and trendy. Great location, as well! Love the outdoor cash-bar with Adirondack chairs and corn hole.
2018-06-26,2,They tried on everything besides the flavor of the food. Unlimited food has seriously become overrated at brunch. This place was my final straw. Everything I tried on the menu from the sliders to the fried rice just lacked flavor. That bliss food gives you when it tastes good is something you won't find here. My favorite dish was probably the Yogurt Parfait. This is a pretty fancy place connected to the W hotel. C'mon ya'll, you can do better!
2018-06-20,5,I've had brunch and dinner here and both are a knock out! You get what you pay for when dining at Halifax, amazing views, nice atmosphere, and of course GREAT food. This is my second favorite place in town next to La Isla. Both completely different though. At Halifax you get fresh food and decent portions. VERY TASTY! Hoboken needs more places like this since jersey city has taken the cake for having a larger variety of good restaurants.
2018-06-19,3,The brunch was a great deal $32 per person for basically unlimited mimosas and small plates (2 hour limit). The food was OK. The best of the small plates were the deviled eggs and the French toast . I give the place 3 stars because I didn't think the customer service was something to rave about. And that's sad to me. It's such a nice atmosphere great location but overall with their blah attitude idk if I wld be dying to come back.
2018-06-18,5,While walking my dog along the waterfront I wanted to eat someplace that was more than just "burgers, quesadillas, wings" and have a GOOD meal with a nice glass of wine - preferably outside.I asked the server if a table was free, and they had one open. They were nice enough to give my dog a bowl of water, and I looked over the menu. I haven't been to Halifax in quite a while - may have even been before the name changed from Zylo. First off, love the menu. The problem I have with the majority of Hoboken restaurants is they don't veer from anything that isn't safe. I tried the steamed mussels for $14 which had saffron butter, white wine, snap peas, fresno peppers, grilled bread. The white wine and butter combined with the snap peas to create an airy crisp green veggie flavor with the peppers it had a slight pop to the taste. Really liked it since a lot of mussel dishes are often tomato based. Would definitely order this again.Looked at the mains and wanted to order just about each one. Figured i'd keep it with the seafood and go with the Maine lobster rigatoni for $32which had lobster coral butter, trumpet mushrooms, lemon. I'm not really sure what "lobster coral butter is". I know lobster. I know coral. I know butter. What the hell is lobster coral butter?Anyhow, it was still dee-licious. I have to say - they didn't skimp on the lobster. I guarantee a whole lobster tail went into this dish, and it was savory, earthy and the zest of the lemon made it so worth it. While I would order this again - I very much want to try more of the items on the menu next time.The service at the place was great, everyone was REALLY friendly to me and my dog. While the price isn't "cheap" I felt like I got what I paid for. I had two glasses of rose, a nice outdoor dinner and the service was friendly and quick. Plus they were dog friendly. I will be back. I need a few more visits before I can pass a final judgement - but very impressed so far.
2018-06-13,5,Had brunch here for the first time a couple weeks ago. Definitely make a reservation! The portions are tapas style, but they bring you a little of everything so you can try! If you want more of anything they bring more out as you please! Service was great, right on the water, and lots of natural light! Will definitely be back!
2018-06-11,4,I've come here 3 times for their Bubbles Brunch which is $32 for unlimited small plates from a menu of about 12 items. I've come in groups of 4, 7, and 9, and they do a good job of bringing out enough of each dish for everyone in your party to try. After you have tried all the dishes, you can order more of your favorites. At this point, I usually can only order 2-3 more dishes before I'm full but I definitely think it's worth $32 because i can't find any other place that has bottomless booze and food. I've had different experiences in terms of how often the waiter refills my champagne glass. Sometimes they're good about it and sometimes I find myself searching for the waiter to ask for a refill when my glass is empty. They advertise that each person gets an entire bottle of champagne but I have never felt like I've drank a whole bottle. They also give you orange juice and strawberry purée to add to your champagne.I really loved the atmosphere of the place. It's in the W hotel and the restaurant is super bright and the furniture gives it a clean and trendy feel. I had to make my reservations 3-4 weeks in advance. I have tried making them 1-2 weeks in advance before and they were completely booked, so definitely call or check availability on Yelp well in advance!
2018-06-06,4,I think the other restaurants in Hoboken need to take notes from Halifax on how to do brunch properly. They are the only restaurant to do brunch like the New York side of the Hudson. For a base price, you can do unlimited tapas/small plates of food and champagne for two hours. This ends up being a sweet deal as the place is right on the water with spectacular views. I searched all down the pier for a good spot for brunch on a Saturday in Hoboken. I ended up at Halifax with their two-hour brunch. I was a little turned off by the fact that we would be served tapas for two hours, however that quickly changed once we started eating. Their tapas menu is long and diverse. Furthermore, if you do the two-hour brunch the tapas are UNLIMITED! Our server pretty much went down the list of all the tapas and we order extra's of stuff we liked. My favorite were the french toast and the fried chicken & polenta. By the end of our two hours we not only had plenty to drink but were stuffed by all the tapas. Additionally, our server was amaze-balls. He didn't go slow with replacing our food or drinks, was very friendly, and kind. I wish I got his name but we made sure to tip well.I definitely recommend this place!
2018-05-27,5,I had my friends 30th birthday brunch here and it was fantastic. The food was great and the service as well. I was able to bring my things to decorate how I wanted and everyone was very accommodating! Brunch was great!! :)
2018-05-16,3,I have a lot of feelings about this place so bear with me. I'll do a fast review of the food first because that's what people really care about.Came for brunch on Mother's Day and the food was pretty good. I'd even say well above average. When you get the bubbles and brunch you get unlimited mimosas and every single thing on the menu. Yo then have a chance after everything is served to order more of your favorite dishes. Each dish was delicious but a bit small. Understandable though when it's all you can eat. The drinks were a bit blah but you can't expect too much from a reasonably priced brunch spot. If this review was based only of the food and drink, it would get 4 stars. For their service: it was pretty good. We got sat at a high table and the bartender was serving us while managing everyone at the bar. She did very well for balancing all of those factors. The food does come out a bit slow though, probably to eat up as much time as possible and prevent you from ordering much more. I'm not really a fan on that and it felt very obvious while waiting for a plate the size of a bread plate to come out with food.The good: since we came here for Mother's Day, we had to make a reservation because the whole restaurant was sold out. When we got there my boyfriend realized he made a reservation for the wrong day but they did their best to accommodate us anyway (at the high table) which was amazing because it saved us a complete disappointment for the day. The bad: I accidentally left my purse at the restaurant hanging on the chair at the high table. I called as soon as I realized and first had to spend LITERALLY 20 minutes trying to get in contact with the restaurant. Had to use the managers line just to get through by calling The W first and transferring. I was hung up on many times before that without even an answer. Then when I finally did get a hold of someone, I asked for them to check by the table I was sitting at and with the bartender or bussers to see if they had found it. They put me on hold for 2 minutes, came back and said nothing. They took my phone number and said they would call if they found anything Fast forward to two days later, I called the restaurant again and asked if they have found a purse, they transferred me to hotel security and who told me they had it because the bartender found it while cleaning up the table. No one ever called me and I am confident if the person I spoke to just asked my server if she had it I wouldn't have had to cancel all of my credit cards
2018-05-08,5,I give them a 5 stars for brunch. This place is perfect for a group of 4+. They have a great concept here, offering unlimited small plates & one bottle of sparkling wine for $32. The food and service are good; space, decor, and presentation are great. I found the music a little loud but you get use to it quickly plus the drinks and food will make you forget about everything that is bothering you. Note that you must make a reservation in advance, this place is quite busy.
2018-05-06,4,Love the all you can eat and drink brunch menu! Cool atmosphere and delicious bites!! Need reservations in advance!
2018-05-03,4,A nice upscale restaurant within the W hotel. I went here many years ago and wasn't impressed. Ended up going here yesterday for lunch and really enjoyed it.The servers were attentive. Prices were reasonable for a place like this. Ordered the fish and chips. The fish was surprisingly very well presented. The batter was authentic like they have it in the chippers in Ireland and England. Chips will nicely seasoned but a bit didn't hit the mark with me. The tartar sauce and apple slaw were spot on. I would come here for fish and chips again!
2018-04-16,4,I've been here twice:  Once for a Yelp Elite event, and once with coworkers for a team lunch.  I *love* the decor, spaciousness, and cleanliness of the entire place.I opted for the Fish N Chips.  The potato wedges were slightly drier than I would have liked, but they were seasoned well and still delicious.  The deep-fried fish was alright, but would have been completely tasteless without the accompanying mustard tartar, which was verrrrry delicious.  I really wanted the fennel apple slaw to help cut through the oiliness of the fish, but it was a bit thick for my liking.Many of my coworkers selected the Halifax burger (medium).  One colleague ordered a steak, which turned out to be a lot smaller than he had expected.Presentation was good for all dishes.  Staff attentiveness and overall service was A+.I'm guessing this place is a bit pricier than other restaurants in the area.  What you're paying for is the nice, fancy-ish atmosphere and decent food.  I'll definitely be back for business lunches, a date with my fiancée, or if some older relatives came into town.
2018-04-14,5,When summer comes, Halifax is one of the few fancy restaurants in Hoboken with outdoor waterfront seating and gorgeous view of Hudson river.Attaching to the W Hotel, with the breeze, the view, the location and the elegance, the vibe is unforgettable over here.We ordered the salt cod and shrimp fritters, the lamb meatballs, sea scallop, smoked Amish chicken, and ricotta cavatelli. All the dishes were delicious ~~ :The cod and shrimp fritters had the texture that's like crab cakes, with aromatic seafood taste. The lamb meatballs were so good that we ordered a second dish of it! I loved my sea scallop that was cooked perfectly, and the grilled oyster mushrooms was a nice surprise; the only drawback was the risotto due to the pesto sauce. I don't think risotto and pesto go together.Service is probably the only thing that has room for improvement.  Things that a fancy restaurant would normally provide and do would have to be asked for over here.
2018-04-09,5,Went here this past Sunday for my friends birthday brunch. It was a lot of fun. Food was good, I like how it is family style and they bring out little portions of everything. It says $32 for unlimited small plates and one bottle of sparkling wine per person but it's basically bottomless until the 2 hours from when you made the reservation is over.  The waitress was super friendly and attentive and we never had to call her over to fill up our glasses, they were always full. All in all, I really enjoyed the experience and will definitely be back.
2018-04-06,3,Halifax seems to be the go-to spot for my friends to pick for birthdays. They have a deal where you can have a personalized menu with your name all pretty on top. It's located in the W Hotel and is beautifully decorated and has a wonderful view of the NYC skyline. However, in terms of the food it's really not that great. I don't really love any of their choices of foods and it's interesting since I came here a year ago in March and I was served the exact same food essentially as I was served almost a year later. They have some basic good choices like parfaits and lox, but the other foods were paired strangely. The price is fair for unlimited brunch for 3 hours for $50, but I definitely wouldn't do that again. If it weren't for the fact it was my own sister who was celebrating her birthday, I wouldn't choose to spend that much money for food I don't like. Cool thing is I saw Cesar Millan there the day of my brunch. Of course he was carrying a dog.
2018-04-01,4,$35 brunch menu was a great and delicious deal! They bring different small plates to your table around 2 at a time. I think we had about 10-12 different dishes along with sparkling wine. It's plenty of food...I felt very full by the end of the meal and enjoyed all of the dishes they brought out.
2018-03-20,3,This place is super cute and definitely has that high end atmosphere. Went here for a Sunday brunch not super crowded. Their fixed price brunch menu wasn't great. Their unlimited apps weren't provided in abundance as expected. Some of their sliders were undercooked as well. Their mimosas were good. Champagne was always coming around which is a plus. You get what you pay for and of course the location/view.
2018-03-15,4,*Happy Hour review*I had been craving oysters for a while, so when my BF found out they have $1 oysters during happy hour, we decided to stop in one Wednesday, just before 6.Happy hour is from 4-7 and there are some apps on special, as well as $5 house wines and draft beer, and a $7 'seasonal cocktail'. We went with 20 of their oysters, and 6 of their deviled eggs ($1 each during HH). The oysters were sizable, and the mignonette it came with was nice. Some of my oysters had bits of shell in them but it wasn't too bad overall (BF said most of his had bits of shell so I guess he was a bit unlucky). The deviled eggs were perfect. Each came with a sliver of fried garlic, which added a lot of flavor.I'm not sure if I would come back for regular food, as nothing really stood out to me. But I'll definitely be back the next time I need some dollar oysters. There don't seem to be a lot of those places in Hoboken.
2018-03-12,1,Went to Halifax for brunch yesterday because I had family visiting from out of town, so I figured this would be the best place to bring them.  I was sorely mistaken.  We had reservations and were seated promptly upon arrival.  Once we sat down at our table, we opted for the $32 all you can eat and drink brunch.  However, we did not drink much at all, since our waiter was too busy flirting with the table of girls next to us, than to tend to our table.  Our food came out super slow and we had to ask for things multiple times.  By the time our third course came out, it was over 2 hours after we had sat down.  Our waiter told us that we had received all of the food that came with the brunch, however after going online to double check the brunch small plates menu, I realized he did not bring us the sliders, the fried rice, or the sandwiches, so I immediately let him know.  A half hour later, our waiter let us know that the kitchen had run out of the fried rice, but he made sure the table of girls he was flirting with had endless amounts of the fried rice, when they had sat down later than we did.  Shortly after, our sliders arrived.  We had a party of 7 people, but our waiter decided to only send out 3 sliders with buns, and 3 others without buns.  When we asked where the rest were and if he could bring out 4 more, he rolled his eyes at us.At this point we were so fed up, someone in my party found the manager and let him know that we had terrible service, not enough food, and hardly any drinks being refilled.  The manager proceeded to make excuses and did nothing to help-- not even an apology. Since he would not come around to ask if we needed anything else or more champagne, we decided to order a round of pecan pie shots from the bar.  Once they were delivered to our table, one of the shots was filled to the brim with just whipped cream, and no alcohol.  One of my family members brought the shot back up to the bar and showed the bartender.  The bartender did not apologize or make her a new shot, instead he took the shot out of her hand and said "you messed with that shot, it was not sent to your table like that" and continued making excuses while the manager watched the whole thing and said nothing.  The only person to apologize for our terrible dining experience was the hostess-- who had nothing to do with any of this.  She was very sweet and felt bad for the horrible service.  We left without a buzz and still hungry.  Don't bother coming here unless you're looking to be hungry and irritated during a 3.5 hour brunch, that should have been only 2 hours.  We will not be returning any time soon, especially since the management has to come up with excuses for having horrible customer service.
2018-03-11,5,Great brunch experience. My fiancé and I enjoyed all the unlimited small plates, especially the seafood options. I like that you get to try all of the menu options, without having to pick and choose. When we liked something slightly more in particular and ordered more of it, it came right out. The servers were very accommodating and friendly. They made sure our champagne glasses were always filled. We received window seats so we had a nice view of the city. Definitely will be back.
2018-03-07,1,It was a fun atmosphere with great decor, but I didn't like any of the food here. We had gotten the unlimited brunch deal so we were each able to try 10 different dishes, and I can't say I actually enjoyed any of them enough to have ordered it as a full portion. I guess the exception is the lox, but it was just a plate of lox....I had a great time because of the company and unlimited drinks (which weren't that unlimited since we were given a set number) of bottles), but don't think I'd choose to come back.
2018-02-25,5,This place is exceptional! I had a party of about 20 people and it exceeded my expectations. The food was amazing and the service was up to par. The managers Maria & Daniel catered to our needs & I would recommend this place to anyone. Very satisfied
2018-02-15,3,My husband and I have been here three times over the past year and a half, and this is definitely the last time that we'll ever go to Halifax. We went there last night for Valentine's Day. I made a reservation and we were quickly seated. It wasn't crowded when we arrived at 7pm. Our server was very green, or at least that's how it seemed. He was very nice but our orders were messed up. Since it was a special Valentine's Day menu, you had two choices each course. We ordered the opposite of each other so we could try everything. Our order was messed up so we got the same dish for everything. When we got our main course, it was room temperature. The beef was perfectly cooked but on the cool side. Desert was delicious. It took our server 15 minutes to get our check back to us after paying. It took forever to get the attention of any server at all when we tried to rectify the fact that our orders were wrong. Overall, a very disappointing experience. The food was delicious but not worth the horrible service that seems to surface every single time. We won't be going back.
2018-02-14,5,Best brunch in town with a great atmosphere. Only thing is you need to make a reservation in advance. Brunch consists of small plates, the selection has something for everyone.  Good service very attentive staff. It is my go to for any type of brunch celebration.
2018-02-14,3,Tried their lunch at Hudson Restaurants week. The restaurant is in the W hotel and it's pretty fancy. 3 course lunch with $18. I would say food here it's just an average. The dessert is way too sweet. Don't think I would come here if it's not Hudson restaurant week because it's way too $$$
2018-02-10,3,I've had the brunch, but haven't yet been for dinner. Many of the other posts explain brunch already, so to keep it short and sweet...if you choose the unlimited option, you get small plates and champagne for 2 hours. You don't get to choose which small plates you want, as they bring each one to the table. After you've had each plate, though, you have the option to get a second order of anything you liked.Interesting concept - I wish you could choose which ones you want from the beginning as I wasn't a fan of everything, but I do like how brunch is centered around the small plates. That's exactly why we wanted to go!  My favorite dishes were the sliders, Mac n cheese, and the chicken and waffles. Would have loved eggs benedict and bacon to be on the menu. The environment is cool, and it wasn't too crowded, so the service was on point. Worth a try, just check the menu beforehand to make sure you're on board with the menu.
2018-02-06,4,Went here on Sunday with my girlfriend. We decided to try out this spot, was recommended by one of my friends as we are foodies and always like to see what's trendy and fun. This place has both ! So let's begin shall we..... we arrived around 12:30 ( noon time ) for their brunch. Was immediately greeted by a hostess. She asked if we had a reservation and told her we didn't. They still accommodated us, which was nice. The waiter came over within the first 20 seconds and acknowledged we were there. The menu looked pretty confusing at first. However, he did come over and explain it to us. For 32.00 unlimited mimosas and unlimited small plates ! So the way it works is, the entire menu comes around putting on the table small plates of food and when done the next keep coming around. Food was 70/30. Some of the items were on point and really tasty and some were so so. Still good, but not as good as others. Hence why the 4 stars and not 5. The music was on point, but low enough to where you can still have a convo with someone and loud enough to not hear the people next to you. Only kinda wished the tables were a little bigger, between the champagne, the coffee, the water and of course the phones for the food selfies the room was tight for the food. Other than that, the salmon was on point, the Cuban sandwich beautifully cooked, eggs were cooked right, sweet meatballs could have been a little bigger ( but still delish ) we will 100% be back. There were a lot more items that I didn't mention, but I want you to be the judge.
2018-01-28,3,Delicious food dampened by a bad service experience. Came here last night (Saturday) for dinner and everything started out ok. We were seated promptly without a reservation (I live in town and the expansive seating area always has tables open) at a table with a great view. We opted for three courses, starting with cured meats and cheeses (shout out to the 3/ $16 deal). Btw, the patè - so so good. As it was my first time at Halifax (the restaurant in this W hotel location changes often) I was pleasantly surprised at the complimentary bread and popcorn. The bread was legitimately a pillowy soft biscuit and I could've cried at how yummy it was!When our appetizers were ready, we were still barely halfway through our meats and the server asked us if he could clear the food on the table. I said no, we were still working, but we condensed our plates and offered he could clear the personal decanters from our wine and the popcorn. My friend also added that we were slow eaters as we like to talk and enjoy our food. To start, I got the pear salad (turns out not a personal fav, but I wouldn't discourage others from getting it) and my friend the sea bream tartar (so light and tasty!). I still had half my salad on my plate and her fork was literally still scooping up the last bite when the server took the plate from the table. Shocked at the audacity, I said hey we are still eating and the server, Luis A, sheepishly apologized.During our entree (highly recommend the lobster rigatoni, flavorful and surprisingly not creamy), no joke a total of 4 different people checked in on our table. At first I thought oh how nice the manager cares, but by the end I was highly confused and feeling rushed out. However, THERE WERE EMPTY TABLES IN THE VENUE THE ENTIRE TIME. Even weirder? After our check came out, it took 15 minutes for the server to take our credit cards. Why the rush the entire time, then the hold up at the end? In honesty, we got 3 courses, spent almost $200 and were there from about 8pm - 9:30pm. Not overstaying if you ask me! Delicious food. Bad customer experience.
2018-01-15,4,Came here this past weekend for my friends birthday brunch... I have to say, I had a really great experience! The brunch included a 10 dish tapas style meal, with unlimited mimosas! The second we sat down, the food came rolling on in! On top of that, they really made the experience nice by personalizing my friends menus! The BLT Cheese Puffs, Potato Poutine, Challah French Toast and Yogurt Parfaits were really, really good! I also loved the aesthetic and vibe of this place... right off the lobby of the W hotel, super modern and trendy with awesome music playing and a nice sized bar. The place was flooded with young people, so I wouldn't recommend this as a "family friendly" type of brunch. The glassware was also super bougie; white opaque champagne glasses, with the champagne they used as a sponsor on them. Only thing I didn't like was the size of the plates were super tiny, you couldn't fit much on it, so you had to eat quickly before the next dish came out. Another cool thing was they had little bottles of more OJ and raspberry to add to your mimosas if you wanted a fruiter flavor! With tax and tip it came out to about $50 but you definitely get what you pay for, especially being right on the water in Hoboken! Would definitely come back!
2018-01-09,2,well, have only eaten breakfast here and it is consistently inconsistent.  I am usually there for business and usually what happens for breakfast is the rather bored host/hostess eventually greets you.   The servers are a bit more attentive.  The breakfast buffet is not that impressive.  usually the food temperatures is somewhere between room level and cool.  Food taste is a slightly better with the exception of the sliced fruit.  The fruit is usually taste old, soak, and limp.  Probably wonder why i go there?  Because the people i travel with or are meeting want to eat here.  I would skip it
2018-01-09,1,What an overpriced joke this place was.  $36 for brunch?!!!!  The eggs were cold, the salmon tasted like it was old, and the portion size definitely didn't scream "family style".  Went there for a birthday party, and they wouldn't even wrap up the cake for the birthday girl to take home.  The valet parking doesn't clearly specify that it jumps from $5 to $20 after 2 hrs.  It was also noisy, cramped, and the view wasn't "that" nice.  Screw Halifax, I'll never go back.
2018-01-04,5,Halifax is amazing. I've gone for brunch, lunch & dinner and every time the service has been outstanding and the food has been gorgeous and delicious! Plus, the lighting and ambiance is perfect. Can't forget about the gorgeous NYC skyline view!I have had several friends rave about Halifax brunch and it's hard for them to choose a different Hoboken spot. Now they have a build-your-own bloody bar and the toppings are ENDLESS. It's a little crazy, but if you love bloodies it's a must-go.
2017-12-30,5,Dude. BRUNCH?! YASSSS For $32 unlimited mimosas and small plates. Our waiter was super friendly and staggered everything nicely. They for you one of everything on the menu to taste everything. From there you can order whatever you'd like! Everything was perfect! I loved it all! I can't wait to go back
2017-12-27,2,Great view of the NYC skyline from the Hudson, decent dishes though pricey. What really put me off from this restaurant is the service. I took my family here for x-mas eve dinner and our waiter was extremely rude. I understand it is a holiday, but being rude to your customers because you don't want to work that night is no excuse. His demeanor and snotty attitude put a damper on the evening. For such high prices and attached to the W hotel, I expect better service.Edit: That night I almost booked with Ruth's Chris in Weehawken and regret not doing so. Have been there now 4 times with family and consistently a great, upscale dining experience. I recommend going here vs. Halifax.
2017-12-18,1,Came in and asked the hostess for a seat near a window, she said sure and sat me two seats over from the window... I pointed to an empty table of the same size next to the window and the hostess rolled her eyes and led me over. Then I found out that the express lunch isn't any sandwich but their chosen house sandwich. The free appetizer deal is actually only for dinner too! So I ordered off that menu, spent twice what I wanted to spend and still left hungry. Don't go!! Too many better restaurants in the area
2017-12-16,3,I was really looking forward to trying the brunch here, but after my meal today I don't know if I'd go back. For the positives, the restaurant is very open and pretty and has nice views of the Hudson. Most of the dishes were good and the price can't be beat $23 for all you can eat or $32 for unlimited sparkling wine. Now on to the problems. First I made a 11am reservation and arrived on time. The restaurant was half empty and the hostess told me they were getting our table ready. We finally got seated 15 minutes later and there was some confusion even the hostess tried to seat us at a table by the window and the manager? Came by as we sat down at our table and yelled no don't seat them there and told her that table is for someone else. Then after some confusion we got seated back at the table. Seriously, WTF it's not like I didn't have a reservation. Kinda started the meal off on a bad note. Then as soon as we sit down the waitress starts bringing out several dishes at a time even before we've had a chance to take off our coats. After the first onslaught of dishes there is a long wait for the next set of dishes and towards the end of our meal our waitress was not even around to see if we wanted anything else or even more water. We literally had to flag her down after waiting for more than 20 minutes to get her attention. The restaurant definitely needs to increase the number of servers during weekend brunch. As for the food, most were ok but nothing memorable or even worth going back for!!
2017-12-11,4,Fantastic seafood. Smoked seafood app is a must try. Scallops were perfectly cooked as was the pan fried black bass filet special. Seafood stew didn't have a ton of broth but delivered on flavor. Apple fritters and chocolate truffle torte desserts were wonderful too. Wine selection was pretty good too.
2017-12-08,4,Came for a multi course dinner but have also been to a cocktail hour here. The space is beautiful with incredible views of the New York skyline. I thought the food was good (though the charcuterie plate is a pass, nothing special). Probably not as good as the price would lead you to believe, but reasonable given the great service, prime location, and breathtaking views. Bartender was very friendly and had solid recommendations when asked. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if you're looking for a fancy dinner spot, cocktail, or Sunday brunch (make a reservation!) in Hoboken, Halifax won't lead you astray.
2017-12-03,5,Fave brunch items: bloody mary bar, croque monsieur, challah french toast.Had a great experience at their new DYO bloody mary bar during brunch. You choose your liquor, mix (bloody mary or ceasar), fixins, toppings, and rim! This is probably obvious but get bacon in it (and I really enjoyed the pickled string beans and blue cheese stuffed olives). The bloody mary itself was very good and very strong. It was actually a cocktail (as opposed to when places give you a glass of chunky cocktail sauce with a splash of vodka - hate that). Then you just sip and relax in their lovely lobby lounge area. Then eat brunch. What's not to like?
2017-11-29,3,I came here for brunch on a Sunday morning with my friends. We didn't have a reservation so we sat at the bar, which wasn't crowded and fully staffed. The hostess told us that their brunch is becoming very popular, and that people make reservations weeks in advance. I was surprised to hear that so many 20 something year olds in Hoboken are booking Sunday brunch weeks in advance as opposed to stumbling in hungry and hungover like we did. But definitely make a reservation if you want a table. Halifax has a super trendy vibe and a great view of the NYC skyline.  The space is large and very open. For somewhere between 21 and 23 (I don't remember and they appear to change their prices) dollars, you get unlimited small plates. For a little more than that, you get a bottle of champagne. Not sure if you get more or less than that, depending on your party size. That was unclear.  Actually, a lot of this menu was very unclear, which I'll get into. If you just want to order a la carte, small plates are $6 each.The way the menu reads, it seems like you can pick and choose from all the small plates and order as much or as little as you want. But in actuality, if you choose the unlimited option, they bring out all of the small plates in waves. This was very poorly explained and stressful for me, as I have food allergies. We finally understood what was going on once they started bringing everything out, but it was confusing because there were a few times where they brought out just one of something, and we had to remind them that there were 3 of us, to which we heard them mutter under their breaths "you only ordered 1."  No, we didnt order anything except say that we were doing the unlimited brunch! It was all extremely strange and confusing.  The servers were also being very literal. Like I ordered a coffee and they brought me black coffee with no sugar or cream and didn't ask me if I wanted any. The food was very delicious. It's all locally sourced. There was so much of it for a very reasonable price. It was all cooked well, and there was so much variety. They had both hot and cold plates. I wanted to give Halifax 4 stars but couldn't due to the choppy service. Nevertheless, I'd come back and recommend their brunch to others.
2017-11-27,1,Food is overpriced for advertised quality. We had to complain about the kitchen grinding pepper corn's after it had gone on for 20 minutes. They acted like we were crazy to be bothered by the sound. If you're really looking for farm to table food this isn't the place to go, take your money and support a better place.
2017-11-26,4,Happy Hour FTW!Monday - Thursday 4-8 $5 Specialty Cocktails& $5 Glasses of Vino with $1 Oysters / Clams& $15 Meat & Cheese Plates (Chefs Choice) ^^^main reason for this review^^^........ Say less. Awesome ambiance as it's right on the waterfront & boasts high ceilings with modern sharp furniture and a unique layout of tables. Bar service is typically nice- cozy and intimate. Must try the Apple Fritters with different dipping sauces for dessert. Just the right amount of sugar to cinnamon.
2017-11-18,3,I enjoyed a somewhat lovely dinner at Halifax on Saturday night, September 23.  We picked the place based on reviews.  Halifax is an excellent choice for a date night or dinner and drinks with friends.  The decor is beautiful and modern and upscale as expected for a W Hotel.  Outdoors, there is an amazing view of the water.  The food and drinks were delicious. Portions were on the normal to small side, which is fine.  Service was ok to good.Halifax has the potential to be one of the best restaurants in the Hoboken area but there was one MAJOR problem.  In fact the problem was so great I am only giving them 3 stars and I contemplated speaking to the manager to complain:  The MUSIC WAS AWFUL.  Definitely the WORST music I have ever heard in a restaurant in my life!!!  I really wish I took audio or video to prove my point.  It pretty much ruined the entire vibe of the evening.  I'm not even a music snob.  It was really bad music that you would expect to hear in an Atlantic City casino in an unidentifiable era.  They really need someone to up their music game.  Having good, non offensive music could take this place to the next level.  Everyone in my party was like "WTF, the music -----".  You never really realize how important the music is to a restaurant until you hear totally inappropriate crappy music being played at one.  If the music was better we would definitely go back here more often. I will report back the next time I visit to see if the music situation has changed...
2017-11-16,5,A favorite spot of ours for weekend brunch, a nice deal with an AYCE option+Amazing selection of breakfast and lunch plates+AYCE portions are small to allow for a varied meal+Service is prompt and easy to hail+Bathrooms are clean-Bit of a loud environment-Must make a reservation for weekend brunch, if not only bar seating is available
2017-11-15,3,Food is ok, if somewhat overpriced. The main problem is the service, it's quite slow and inattentive, even when the restaurant seems barely half full.
2017-11-12,4,I was skeptical before I came. This place has changed names a few times now and I was worried that this may be another short stay, but wow was I wrong!!We started with the squash frites and the charcuterie.  The squash frites were unique and surprisingly delicious. They were crunchy, salty, and a perfect start to the meal.I am not the biggest charcuterie person but the one I liked in particular was the smoked salmon. It was kind of like salmon jerky and went well with the different items.  One thing that would have been better is if the meat/cheese came with jams. The sweet salty combination would have made this even better.I would highly recommend ordering the cavatelli special with meat and sauce. It is very good and cooked perfectly al dente. Take a look at the picture who the waiter and order that.We also tried the salmon which was also tender and not dry. This was some superb salmon!For our sides we tried the polenta which wasnt the bed I have had. It was more like mushy porridge than creamy polenta. Seemed like they overcooked it a little. The cauliflower was good but the sides were not the star of the show here the entrees were. It is a little pricey here but the decor and view is unbelievable. You are right on the water overlooking nyc. Solid 4 star place.
2017-11-06,5,I don't normally like Hoboken. I've tried multiple times to enjoy the night life that this city is raved for, but have consistently been let down. I know this is very different from what others have experienced, but while I love me a good Sweet Caroline rave, the drunken screams are only bearable for so long. Recently however, I found the ray of sunshine in this city that is sure to have me float over from my normal Jersey City stomping ground quite often. Halifax is a gem of a brunch with high repeat appeal.Connected to the fancy shmancy W hotel and sitting right on the waterfront, Halifax's atmosphere will have you feeling like a Rockefeller on a Fashionnova budget. The high ceilings restaurant really does their brunch in beautiful ways and offers a flexible package for your early afternoon needs. My personal favorite and the only route that anybody should be choosing, is unlimited food and bottomless champagne (please note I didn't use the word mimosas on purpose) all for the pocket heavenly price of $32.The menu is simple American style food that just keep coming and coming. The experience is wonderfully presented by the servers that bring out every plate on the menu in a thoughtful order. Starting with a refreshing strawberry-rhubarb yogurt parfait and summer gazpacho with poached shrimp, moving onto a fluffy Challah-French toast and savory great potato and pouting, and finishing off with cheesy smoky chicken mac and cheese and beef sliders, these are just a few of the many plate options that will be flowed out to your table. By the end of your small plate journey, you'll definitely be asking for repeats of the French toast, poutine, and mac & cheese, along with the risotto balls and beef sliders.The bottomless champagne is poured as soon as you're nearing the end of your glass thanks to the attentive staff. In order to dilute your glass and ensure that you're able to make it to the end of your 2 hour slot, there are carafes of both orange and strawberry juice placed at your table to add that flavor and alcohol cushion.I'd argue that it's nearly impossible to find a brunch deal like this in the tri-state area. Luxury atmosphere, expedient service, fulfilling food, and boozy levels on a hundo come together to bring a successful brunch experience. If you find something that gives you a better bang for your buck, you bring it to me immediately!See more eats from my personal food journey at mobettereats.com
2017-11-06,3,Went to the Halifax for the first time. We went for brunch and I tried to make a reservation and I couldn't online. Apparently they have 2 waves of brunch which was not explained on the website. And the first wave was sold out. But there were tables free they still wouldn't seat us. So we waited for a seat at the bar. Which further would take 15 to 20 minutes. The manager came to talk to us about why we couldn't get a table. She was very nice but still didn't make sense to me. We've been waiting for about 30 minutes now for someone to get up from the bar. The manager gave us complimentary champagne while we waited which was very nice.Finally a spot opened up at the bar and we were able to do unlimited brunch which was unlimited champagne and small plates of food for 32 dollars which is such a great deal. I'm a vegetarian so I only could eat very few of them but the ones I could eat were good. My friend is allergic to sea food so we decided not to get the sea food options. They were very accommodating.  After the first round of small plates. We just wanted the French toast and potatoes which they brought out. The food comes out fast which is good too. My only problem was they should state it on the website about the brunch and reservation situation so no one ends up waiting around like we did. Also if people have dietary issues or specific dietary concerns i think they shouldn't have to pay the whole 32 especially if they aren't eating most of it. As a vegetarian my options were super limited but I did enjoy my time after the seating situation was dealt with.
2017-11-02,4,Great ambience at this chic waterfront restaurant.  We came for brunch which is essentially a buffet - they bring you everything on the menu, and you can request additional servings of your favorites.  It was really fun to try everything, and at a reasonable price.  The french toast was hands-down the b.e.s.t!  So delicious.  Note, the service was not super speedy, but it's meant for you to relax and enjoy, not eat and rush out.  Good spots for both dates and groups.
2017-10-23,3,I have mixed reviews about this place...came here on Saturday for their bottomless brunch and can't say I was too impressed....brunch is $38 plus tax plus 22% gratuity...we paid $55 per person (which included covering the birthday boy's meal and dessert)....The brunch is a family style serving of 10 small plates which you choose beforehand. The plates are unlimited for 2 hours and it includes bottomless champagne with mixers to make mimosas or a Bellini along with soft drinks, coffee and tea.   Positives:- Posh Decor- Great views of the city- Unlimited Champagne (& yes, they kept it flowing LOL)- Awesome waiter - Benjamin was our waiter, we were a party of 14 and he did his best to accommodate us, ensure our cups were always filled, and we received the food we wanted re-ordered. - I worked with Roxann to setup the reservation, she was friendly and always got back to me quickly. - $5 Valet for up to 3 hours. - My favorite dishes of the 10 small plates we selected: Potato Poutine, Croque Monsieur (the cheese sauce was crack!), and the French Toast (maple whipped cream is to die for!!) Oh! The BLT cheese pufff was a MAJOR hit at the table!Now onto the negatives:- Kitchen is ssslllooowwwww....- The food wasn't coming out fast enough, there was two times that about 15 minutes passed and no food was served. This is a problem when you're constrained to 2 hours of brunch. (I can't see this falling on our waiter because every time I put in an order, I saw he would enter it in the system.)- I requested they bring out the food in servings of 3 and they would only bring out 2 servings, sometimes 1. We're a party of 14 and it's small bites! There should be 3 plates coming out at once. We were only able to eat one bite per order.          - Cherry on top, 2 out of 10 plates weren't even served until the last 45 mins. To add insult to injury, when we reordered the French Toast, they brought out half a plate of French toast! This was everyone's favorite dish! Buzz Kill!- I forgot the name of the woman that was in charge...and I'm not even sure what the problem was, but I did see her exchange words with Benjamin and heard her clearly say "he was pissing the kitchen off". I think Benjamin was clearly doing his job and putting in our reorders. - Dishes I could've done without: Buttermilk Fried Chicken (gravy was gross & biscuit was hard), Smoked Mac & Cheese (bland and overcooked), and the Sliders (overcooked, bland and didn't taste like premium meat).My expectations for Halifax were high....Although I wasn't highly disappointed, I wasn't impressed either.
2017-10-15,4,Saturday Brunch (Bubble Bites) = unlimited small plates from the fixe menu for $23 and if you want unlimited Champagne with mixers(OJ & Strawberry puree) add $9 per person. They bring you everything on the menu unless you ask them not too. The room is wonderful and we had a table at the windows over looking NY City & Hudson River park. They have outdoor seating also. Great service. The crowd tended to be large gathering of younger women and it was loud but that did not bother me. What did hurt was COLD FOOD!!!!!!! We mentioned to the server that every item (French Toast, Eggs, Mac & cheese, BLT Cheese puffs, Chicken & biscuits), hamburger sliders, all served COLD and perhaps one item was luke warm. I know the kitchen has to prepare in advance but the took excellent, high quality food and ruined what would have been a 6 star experience. I did not want to keep complaining to the servers but will be writing to management.
2017-10-14,3,This brunch was very different.      You can have a bottomless amount of food and champagne for $31 or have each entree for $6.    You know which you are picking.      It's a little different than a buffet as the servers bring over the menu of items one after the other.    You can ask for repeats but I guarantee that you will be stuffed after the first wave.  Upon entry to the restaurant we were struck by the NYC sky line.    Our hostess tried to tell us that tables were reserved even though we made reservations......very confusing but we eventually got to sit where we wanted.      Our waiter was attentive and the service was spot on.  What was surprising was the coffee and drink was not included in the non alcohol brunch for $23.French toast a must Scrambled eggs a mustSmoked salmon a must Deviled eggs passSeafood Ceviche  okYogurt  yes yes yes Mac and Cheese.   No no no Poutine way too heavy Blt Cheese puff  yes yes yes Sliders make sure they are served hot I will note the restaurant was void of men.....it felt a little like grown up sorority reunions at many tables speckled with a few family tables.    It is loud but definitely a place I would visit again !!!!    I give it a 3 only because of how the food is served and you can't pick what you want otherwise it's a SOLID 4.25
2017-10-14,2,Made dinner reservations for a birthday and went early for Happy Hour. I called and spoke to someone the day before who seemed very professional however when we arrived there was no reservation in my name. This was on a Thursday at 4:00.The hostess was very attentive, even explained the complicated ( time limit of 2 hours & then it costs more )valet parking service. She went on to explain something about a percentage during brunch & lunch so I just stopped listening since I parked across the street.It's easier and makes more $ sense to park across the street in an independent garage. $20 for 10 hours! So, not a great start.We made our way to seating at the bar which surprisingly did not face the water. I think that was a design flaw, honestly.The staff seemed unprepared, one HH menu between three people, c'mon! Luckily, the hostess intervened and provided us with more menus. We asked for specialty drinks and the gentleman behind the bar seem to know nothing about it. We pointed to the menu and he replied "I'm not the bartender" I asked "but where is the bartender? " he's not here yet "what time is happy hour" 4 o'clock "what time does the bartender get here?" 4:30.OK now I'm scratching my head and trying not to get annoyed since it's supposed to be a happy birthday celebration. Then a very enthusiastic young woman appears and says " I can make the specialty drinks!" Great! So after a few questions, we order. Results took a while but drinks were wonderful. Then we sat waiting to put in a food order. The enthusiastic woman disappeared. Back to the " I'm not the bartender guy." We asked a few more questions about the HH offerings, put in our order and waited. And waited. Other patrons started to arrive but it was not busy at all. Finally, the food arrived! Oysters were phenomenal, deviled eggs were very plain and did not live up to the hype. Meanwhile our drinks are empty and we had to beg for service. Then Lo and behold, the "bartender" appeared and told us the drinks we had from the enthusiastic young women were a mistake, they are not HH drinks. By now, we were growing frustrated with what seemed to be a game we didn't know the rules to! After a bit of bickering about how we really came for dinner not drinks, & how we were misinformed by the previous server,he went to his manager. He came back with an attitude saying " Ok, you can have one more but only one!" Oh boy! I was flabbergasted to be spoken to in a demeaning way for something I was paying for and waiting patiently for. We got our drinks, settled down & then I noticed hot buttered popcorn in big bowls were given to several other customers. I politely asked a different server about it since it wasn't on the HH menu. He said it was complimentary. So I asked, why we didn't get any since we'd been there for 30 minutes. He returned with a tiny saucer for three people! I was not looking for a fight but felt we were invisible to this staff. The attention was given to a large group of young people, a couple with a baby, and we were just not seen for some reason!Finally, the hostess came and said your table is ready. We asked for our bill, only one round of drinks and no food was on the bill. My two friends thought they were taking it off the bill due to all the unpleasantness but I had a feeling it would be tacked on to our dinner bill. They were so happy, I was outvoted, so we didn't question it.We are seated. Who is our waiter? Yup, the "I'm not the bartender guy." He turns into the most attentive and cheerful waiter!Most of the review has been about the service because that was the biggest impression that I got. Now for the food. My friend loved the Amish chicken but to me,  it looked dry and she took a lot of it home. I had the cod and it lacked flavor but was a good size. My other friend ordered two side dishes the polenta which she liked and the cauliflower which she took home also.The biscuits were  delicious, hot and fresh ,we asked for more. We also asked for more popcorn! I had periodically reminded the staff that it was a birthday celebration and they did come through with a very strange peanut butter and jelly dessert but it was a big hit and the birthday girl was happy. Also, the menu has changed and the one dish I wanted is gone and so is the variety in desserts. Prices are what you would expect to pay to dine on the waterfront, quality however is lacking in both main courses and all experiences we had to suffer through at the Un-happy hour. And the HH food and drink was included in our dinner tab, as I had guessed,but my friends were celebrating thinking the establishment treated us for their wrongdoing!So we paid two separate times. Ugh!As a second chance, I may return just to have the $1 oysters and a non-specialty drink to avoid any kind of conflict at the bar and will not arrive at 4 o'clock even though that's when happy hour is supposed to start.
2017-10-12,5,Went for Weekday Happy HourFood - 4/5. Deviled eggs are delicious with the smoked herring adding that extra touch of umami. Beef sliders were full of flavor! The sweet & salty flavors from the marmalade and the hint of spiciness from the fresno sauce was a great combination. Oysters were fresh and I really liked their mignonette sauce. However, the salt cod & shrimp fritters were really bad; it was entirely batter and way overcooked. The batter was so overly fried that it felt like biting into a rock and the delicate seafood was so dry that I would not know what the contents were if not for the menu. All the other food were great so I think this might have been a fluke but the fritters I had were awful.Service - 4/5. The service felt a little bit rushed to take the order but it was fine otherwise.Value - 5/5. The happy hour menu has great choices and the prices are amazing. $1 oysters will always be a winner! A great spot for happy hour in Hoboken.Parking - Parking Garage/Street (Metered)
2017-10-12,2,So many swings and misses here.  Total fail and just goes to show what places in Hoboken can get away with.  Slow inattentive service with a side of 'how are all these seemingly normal item so not good?' Caesar salad?  Dry.Shrimp? Looked good, tasted bleh.Lobster pasta - poorly cooked pasta with nice but little chunks of lobster for 32 bucks - no thanksChicken - fine but no reason to go backTook forever to get any service, then took forever to get drinks, then took forever to get bread.  Server disappointed throughout the meal - gave up on even ordering dessert.Even forgetting that the menu was a bit overpriced - it just wasn't good... for any price.
2017-10-08,4,Ah maz ing! Came for dinner on Tuesday and brunch today. Brunch was my favorite. $32 for unlimited champagne and tons of smalls plates. Such a great way to try everything and whatever you love they bring more of! Perfect for a large group you can all share and test everything out. Huge selection of breakfast, lunch and dinner options on the menu. Dinner was good too,great wine selection perfect pairing with our meal. Pear salad was delicious next up were the fall grains. It was a mix of quinoa, dark and Squash, very tasty. The main dish were the short ribs...according to fellow yelper Jason, they should be gentle. These were not. They were good but I wouldn't want a whole plate of them.
2017-10-08,2,Recently my best friends Bob and Vic celebrated their 37th wedding anniversary. Being their closest friend I let them choose the place to go hace a couple of drinks over a course of meals overlooking the Manhattan skyline. They settled on Halifax, and before we knew it we were on our way there. I'm normally not superstitious but normally a sign things would not go too well began even before we arrived. The Uber driver could not find the place from the address given. It took several turns and a phone call to the location for us to finally turn on Sinatra Drive and for the driver to drop us off in front of the place which is listed as facing Hudson (it doesn't.).We begin to eat the bread (not warm, mind you) we got as we waited for our appetizers and main course and make small chat, and notice that it's taking rather long for us to get our meals. Note that we arrived to a mostly empty place. Our main course took nearly an hour and a half to arrive, they were out of several dishes, several drinks... and the desert... I've never seen such a slow, incomplete service.And then we noticed the table beside us. An Asian husband and wife.l, neither who seemed happy with the service. After a series of strained conversations with the waiter we noticed that the wife got up after seeing the bill and went to speak to either the waiter in question or whom ever was in charge. Bob and the husband made some conversation in which they both shared their anger at such a terrible service. Other tables joined in as well. When the bill arrived we saw we'd been overcharged with bloody Mary's and a dish. Needless to say we had to get up (like the Asian lady had done) and go contest the bill. We did get some "Sorry, we do apologize..." but the damage was done. We left... and we will never return. Any of the restaurants on Washington or even a block north on Sinatra drive are miles ahead of this place. Avoid. Or go at your own risk.
2017-10-04,5,Had a beautiful post Valentine's Day dinner here since hubby was traveling. This is my second visit as my first was a business meeting. Didn't take pics then of the food, but it was exceptional!On this visit we had a charcuterie, raw clams and oysters, scallops entree, and a chicken entree. Forgive me as I can't remember the names of the entrees, but they seasonally change their menu and I did not see them on its current line up. However I never forget a great meal!Charcuterie was probably one of the best I have eaten! Scallops were sumptuous with the Israeli couscous. My hubby killed his chicken entree made with currants and balsamic! Dessert was this incredible slice of chocolate ganache heaven! Did I even mention I devoured the complimentary salt n pepper popcorn or the chocolate cookies and house infused cognac?!Located in the W Hotel with valet parking, you cannot go wrong here if you are looking for some excellent fine dining! Hotel is great too! Perfect for a local weekend getaway overlooking the Hudson with views of NYC!
2017-10-04,4,Yesterday was my first time eating here. I came for dinner on Tuesday night where they have a special 5 for $29 but only on tues. You get 5 small courses w/ 5 paired tasting size wines for each one. This is a great deal for a girls night out as they tend to eat smaller portions then men. The dishes change seasonally but don't differ to much. 1st course- charcuterie & cheese board2nd course- Pear Arugula salad w/Gorgonzola and spiced nuts (my favorite course) 3rd course- Fall Grains warm squash and couscous like grain with Gouda. The bowl itself was huge with a perfectly sized food portion at the bottom.4th course- Braised Beef Short Rib w/red corn polenta and crispy sunchokes on top. The bowl was to small and made it harder to eat. You had to nearly mash the beef into the polenta. Beef was for tender and quite small but perfect size for me. 5th course- Pumpkin almond cake filled with chocolate. The cake was overwhelmed with the dark chocolate but the whipped cream with spices was delicious. I'm not a drinker so I just tasted each one with appropriate course. The parking can be tough though I found 2hr metered parking. The other options are to valet at W Hotel for $25 for 2 hrs if your dining at the Halifax.
2017-10-04,4,Halifax is in the swanky W Hotel. The restaurant has a very "clean" upscale vibe. The ambiance is very inviting and romantic. I came for dinner for their Tuesday tasting where they have 5 small plates paired with 5 different wines for $29.00. Very good deal for the quality of food, but when the say small plates, they are small! I felt the wines were perfectly paired with each plate. My favorite dishes were the cheese plate and short rib with polenta. Also, the dessert, a seasonal pumpkin cake, was the perfect bite to end the meal.It was nice to try a little bit of everything. I thought the service was very attentive and was pleased with my experience. I will be back to try their brunch.
2017-10-04,4,Thanks to Yelp for an amazing mystery dinner! Halifax has such an inviting and modern feel. Everything I tasted was amazing however I do have some feedback for some of their courses. First was their charcuterie and cheese board which was pretty amazing. It combine house made charcuterie and local cheeses and the best part was the guava paste ( guava+cheese=warm fuzzy feelings). Second was the NJ pear salad which was also pretty good however the dressing was kinda mayonaise-y for my taste. If I ordered this again at Halifax I would probably just ask for the dressing on the side or for no dressing at all! The candied pecans were a nice touch. Third was their fall grains dish which was probably my favorite since i am a huge fan of barley- and it had a risotto taste with a barley texture which I loved. Def would order the full order of this. The last kind of entree was the braised short rib dish- which I would have to say was a unique twist on what I have had in the past. Red corn polenta added a great touch to this savory dish and the beef was pull apart soft and not chewy at all. The fried sunchokes on the top were more than addicting. Last dish was a pumpkin almond cake with fresh cream which was a great small bite to end the meal. Finding the chocolate inside was a great touch but he cake itself was cooled perfectly and was light and a little sweet (for those who like a more subtle sweetness I'd recommend this dessertx100.
2017-10-03,3,This is a beautiful cleanly decorated restaurant with great food. I have to say the pear salad was my favorite along with the dessert. The staff is very friendly and the price was reasonable considering it's the W hotel. Don't forget to get your parking validated if parking at the hotel! If you make on a Tuesday the tastings menu is the way to go!!
2017-09-24,4,Excellent cocktails!  Got a few appetizers. They were tasty but portions were kind of small and pricey. atmosphere is spot on!
2017-09-24,5,Had dinner here for my bday and what an amazing choice I'd made. I definitely took a chance since I'd never been but reviews helped my decision and I'm glad they were right. Everything we had was very good. The complementary warm bread and popcorn was nice to start in case you were already starved upon arrival. The lamb meatballs were delectable. Even if you're not a fan of lamb, you'll probably like this appetizer. The cod fritters are a safe bet for anyone who likes fried seafood. The entree I got was the lobster rigatoni which was nice and light since it was not made in a cream sauce. Beware however that if you have an appetite, the regular size isn't as much as you'd think since the dish isn't deep as I assumed I might take some home since I'd already eaten a good amount of food prior. It worked out however as it left room for dessert. Went with the chocolate torte with caramel ice cream which was a pleasant way to end my bday dinner. Very interested in trying out their brunch one day as well.
2017-09-23,1,BAD SERVICE****We are sitting here, outside and have been watching every table around us get served.We've waited for the 2nd set of appetizers for over 20 minutes.We've asked politely and we're assured they were on their way.No excuse.Terrible service.Would NOT recommend.
2017-09-20,3,Came here because my boyfriend had an interview with Jet and stayed at the hotel. The NY steak was delicious, with mash potatoes with leeks and arugula. On the pricey side- but reasonable. I got the seafood stew which was okay- could have been more fresh or warm. The food was slightly lukewarm. The bread that came with the seafood stew was SO burnt- it was disgusting. When I asked for more- the waiter gave me table bread which was rolls (which is a different bread than my dinner came with). Fine...but service overall wasn't great, maybe because it was getting late on a weekday night. The dessert was very good- chocolate torte. Overall- was an okay place. Seems like brunch is good but dinner is not so great. On a side note, the view of the NYC skyline is spectacular from inside the restaurant and the inside decor was very pretty
2017-09-18,5,I've been here 4 times!  It's the ambiance, courteous/attentive staff, awesome food, and bottomless mimosas that brings me back time and time again.Halifax is located off River next to the W hotel.  Parking can be limited on Washington and the nearby cross streets so walk, uber, or take the path.  If needed you may park in River Street Garage a few steps north of Halifax.  The ambiance is casual but classy with both indoor and outdoor seating.  If the weather is right, I drop by in the late morning for some brunch, fresh air, and people watching.  Dining against the backdrop of the Hudson river and NYC skyline is the relaxing cherry on the top that earns this place its 5th star.  I most recently came here with a coworker for the brunch buffet and bottomless mimosas.  The mimosas and food were on point and the wait staff were attentive and courteous.  Bring a large group and try to sample the entire brunch buffet, otherwise definitely give the smoke salmon benedict a try.  I also had no trouble plowing through a few plates of beef sliders.  Finally, definitely take a look at the regular menu to see if there is anything you want.  The food here is generally great and I've definitely been able to finagle a few of the non-brunch items into our brunch buffet on occasion.
2017-09-15,4,Nice lunch place in Hoboken.  Upscale but won't break the bank.  Great view of the Hudson river and Manhattan skyline.  Enjoy a drink and try the cured salmon and homemade pasta.
2017-09-09,4,Very nicely decorated which you can't eat but sets the stage. Food is good. A little adventurous. Not much I could eat on the bar menu - lamb, goat cheese, shrimp. Points for waiters who remember you! On the noisy side on weekends. (Gaggles of dressed up young women. Why do some people screech!) Also sedate groups of seniors. It's in a hotel so I guess that's part of why such a mix. Great river views of Manhattan from the outside tables. Will be back for the unlimited champagne brunch. That was good, lots of variety! I'm not saying the food is exceptional it's just good. Good enough.
2017-09-06,4,Nice location and atmosphere. Came here for brunch with friends. I had salmon Benedict which was pretty good. Service was good.We were able to have a conversation, quite & clean place.I will come here again.
2017-09-05,5,Bright, airy with superb views of the New York skyline, fresh salmon and a must-do all you can eat and drink brunch where the food is ordered and not laid out to get cold on a buffet. Inspired by Nova Scotian cuisine, dining at this place inspires you to visit the actual Halifax.
2017-08-30,4,Best brunch I have ever had. Awesome atmosphere and great food. Unfortunately, our server was almost non existent. The staff there isn't the friendliest but I would recommend it for the great brunch deal.
2017-08-28,5,Finally made it here for brunch and it was fantastic!  Since we came a bit earlier, we pretty much had our pick of seating.  They have both indoor and outdoor seating options available, which was perfect as it was so nice out.First tip, skip the usual breakfast buffet and go with either the bottomless brunch option or one of the regular entree items.  You can get scrambled eggs and pastries at just about any other hotel.  Halifax has got a real kitchen going that can do much better than that.Ordered the smoked salmon Benedict and it was incredibly flavorful!  The Hollandaise was just right without getting too heavy or greasy.  There was also a bit of caramelized onion to really balance that flavor out and make it extra savory.  Portion was very nice, but I still found myself wanting to order another one because it tasted so good!The egg white frittata was tasty as well, but that smoked salmon benny really stole the show.  had the chicken sausage and it was well seasoned.  The chicken flavor really came though and it was definitely less greasy as compared to the usual pork sausage.Bloody Mary here was a steal for $6!  It was also one of the better Bloody Mary's around.  It wasn't overly acidic or salty.  Also got that nice chunk of bacon and olive in there as garnish to deepen the flavor.Gotta get back here for dinner when I have the chance.
2017-08-28,1,Worst brunch experience ever. Not sure why this place has very good reviews. Very unorganized and delay in getting food. Servers were not consistent or attentive to our needs whatsoever. In order to get better service i unfortunately had to react and get a mgr involved (this really should not happen). Ppl that came in after us got food faster than us which was NOT AT ALL RIGHT. And then of course getting items, seemed cold, dry and just not good. Server also ran my card multiple TIMES unnecessarily. AVOID THIS PLACE! I'm telling you not worth the trip, experience, or service. There's much better options.
2017-08-27,1,I was so excited to come here from hearing how great the food was and what a great experience was delivered from Halifax. However, that was not the experience I had. I did not get to try everything that was on the menu, the waitress was absolutely awful and did not care about our orders whatsoever. We tried to tell her multiple times we did not receive some of the items on the menu and just ignored us. So upset with my experience here and will not be coming back.
2017-08-24,5,Great date night spot! I came here for dinner for my boyfriends birthday and service + location was beautiful. The restaurant is next to the W hotel with a great outdoor seating to watch the sunset. I was skeptical coming to this location as I had only heard great reviews about the brunch. The dinner was even better because the Lamb meatballs: very seasoned and yummy. Salmon: favorite dish, perfectly cooked. The dish came with a sauce on top that could come separately but really balanced the meal. Ribeye: special at the time for the dinner menu and was a rare type only found in New Jersey. It's was so juicy and flavorful that I really hope whoever reads this review can order on the menu. Serving was huge and well worth the price behind it.
2017-08-21,4,If you're in the mood for a boozy brunch in the Hoboken area - this is the place to be. Recently, visited Halifax yesterday for a friend's birthday. Over the course of two hours, we were able to sample 10 different small plates  - ranging from yogurt parfaits to maple chicken buns to tomato risotto balls. All the food is quite tasty with the best benefit being able to choose which of the small plates you would like more. From other friends who have been there a couple times, the menu itself changes from time to time so you don't get too bored of the same options. Bottomless wise (2 hours), the servers does a great job of making sure your glass never gets low or completely empty. The champagne flow here definitely isn't something you have to worry about. Added bonus is the two different mixers - classic OJ or the sweet strawberry (my personal fav.) Price wise - $35 per person plus taxes and gratuity. My favorites from the brunch food wise - french toast/risotto balls/maple chicken. I'll be back soon enough.
2017-08-20,5,Nice atmosphere and decor, great food. Service was good too. Went here for a group dinner, everything was clean. (That's that first sign of a good place, if you have clean dinnerware. I've had to send back utensils at high rated restaurants before.) We ordered the lamb meatballs. I'm not a fan of lamb, but these meatballs were pretty good. The bread for the table was warm and really delicious. For mains we got the Amish smoked chicken and the Lobster rigatoni. Both meals met our expectations and tasted really good. The one thing about the menu is that there are no plant base/vegan options. Most of my diet is plant based (not a vegan), I eat animal protein occasionally. It would be great if the menu catered for plant base individuals as well as food free from allergens options. Other than that, this place was great.I liked the shots and cookies on the house at the end of our group dinner.
2017-08-19,5,Decided on the Bubbles brunch for my girlfriends birthday and it did not disappoint! The next round of food came before we had finished the last and we couldn't finish our champagne faster than they refilled it. This place is awesome and we can't wait to go back.
2017-08-19,4,After a too long morning in Weehawken Municipal Court, my client and I decided to replace that sour taste with a more pleasant one at lunch.  She had been to the W Hotel in Hoboken, NJ before, and said it was a great place to chill while overlooking the Manhattan skyline across the Hudson River.  The drive down allowed me to see how much has been done in the area to make this formerly depressed urban Jersey scene into a beautiful town.  The gentrification may have not been the best for the folks who formerly lived there, but there is no question that those who can afford the new life here, have found a great situation.  Hoboken feels more like Brooklyn now than Jersey (Not that there's anything inherently wrong with the Jerzee). We drove down the 20 minutes it took to reach the W.  Valet parking was only $5 with validated parking receipt - so much better than hunting for street parking.  Walking into the W, we immediately felt the cool relief of the air conditioned, high ceilinged, lobby.  Still, we opted to sit outside under blue canvas roof so we could enjoy the view and the street life on Sinatra Drive (Yes. Frank was born and raised here, as was my father). Many beautiful people out for a stroll this day.  Our service was friendly and efficient, with an old wine bottle filled with cool water placed on our table, and refilled as needed.  The menu was not large, but demonstrated a fairly wide and interesting description of the kitchen's capabilities.  We ordered the Quinoa Burger and Grilled Cheese combo.  Both of us tried the cold cream of asparagus soup, as our curiosity got the best of us on this warm August afternoon.  Both came with small salads nesting on the main plate. The veggie burger was large, fresh and not too tightly packed.  Nice texture and taste on a large brioche-style roll.  The grilled cheese was a pressed panini, and had the mix of cheeses oozing out the edges before they began to slowly cool and harden.  Eating the cheese as it morphed between runny goo and firm cheddar/Havarti solid was an unexpected pleasure. The bread stayed firm, crunchy and warm throughout.  Really liked this rendition of the classic sandwich. The chilled asparagus soup was interesting, but not my favorite flavor, as the taste was not what I recognized as Asparagus officinalis (garden asparagus). It wasn't unpleasant, just unexpected and a tad underwhelming.  Despite that small hiccup, Halifax is a very cool place to grab a relaxing meal.  From what I see in the other reviews, it is also a good place to hang out with friends and drinks.  I'm thinking a weekend at the W Hotel with late nights at this joint would make me very popular with my +1. Will let you know.
2017-08-18,4,I had dinner at Halifax with a friend this past week and had an amazing time from beginning to end.Cocktails: I had a tequila/prosecco/cassis drink which was delicious and my friend had a bourbon/peach/thyme drink. The cocktail menu was inventive and creative.Appetizer: we split the mussels which were DELICIOUS. Mussels were fresh, and extremely large, cooked in a delicious slightly-thick (in a good way) broth. Served with grilled bread on the side. The portion is EXTREMELY generous, and would have been plenty for a main dish.Main Dishes: My friend ordered the Maine Blue Cod and I ordered the Seafood Stew. I did not try the cod but my friend finished every bite on his plate so it must have been good! The stew was once again delicious- including shrimp, clams, scallops, mussels, squid etc. in a spicy tomato sauce. Unfortunately I could only eat about 1/3 of the dish because I was SO FULL from our appetizer, but if I could grow a second stomach I would have licked the bowl.Our waitress was extremely friendly and offered up menu suggestions that proved to be delicious. We were on the fence about ordering a side dish to split but she convinced us that what we ordered would be plenty of food. I really appreciate not being up-sold on things I don't need.The only reason for 4 stars is that there was a bit of a wait from start to finish. (We sat at 8 and did not leave until 10:30). BUT, for a Wednesday evening, I think the busyness of the restaurant bodes well for the future of Halifax. Highly recommend.
2017-08-17,1,This place has a lot of nerve charging close to $30 for a beer and a martini.  Do they think they're the Hudson Hotel? This is Hoboken.  There are a dozen places to get a beer within two blocks.  Never again.
2017-08-15,5,One of the best brunch spots I have ever been to. Their menu is fantastic and so is the location. Perfect place for a date or a large party. You get a small dish for every item on the menu, plus 2 hours of endless mimosas or bellinis. The small plates fill you up! I highly recommend this place.
2017-08-14,5,We just had brunch and it was wonderful!Loved the fact that it's a tasting and then you can repeat what you would like to have at the end.  It's a great concept as opposed to a buffet. The small plate idea is great and gives you a chance to taste many different things.  We were pretty full but the shot of gazpacho with shrimp was worth a repeat.  I don't even eat French toast but this was light and delicious along with the maple cream on top.It adds to the dining experience when not only is the food enjoyable, but the ambiance and service so all the boxes were checked. It was properly paced and the service was excellent and accommodating.  Kimberly was our waitress and she was great as well as all the servers who brought out the food.We would definitely return.  It was worth the trip from Manhattan to experience this.
2017-08-13,5,The food here is super delish. Came here on a Sunday & sat outside without any wait. Perfect view of the waterfront. I had the lobster rigatoni which was so good & my husband had the lamb which he said was just ok. Im super picky with drinks and loved the cuban redhead which had ginger whiskey. The ambiance was chill & an adult vibe..which i like because some of the restaurants along the waterfront give that frat house vibe..almost made me feel like i was in Miami. I will definitely be back here.
2017-08-07,5,I absolutely loved Halifax from beginning to end. Staff was very friendly and prompt and the decor was perfect in my opinion. Plus, nothing tops the view! We went in on Sunday for the $45 pp Brunch special. Soooo worth it. The waiters came around to our table always topping our champagne glasses off and serving food. We had many of the dishes from the menu in small portions. My favorite were the Risotto balls and French toast. The sliders were awesome too!!  Highly recommend those options! They gave us a little bit of everything and by the end of our brunch, everyone was stuffed! I will definitely be returning!
2017-08-06,2,Had the brunch with a big party. I was very unimpressed with the quality of the small plates.. pretty much all the options were bland and the champagne was very slow in pour. Definitely did not feel it was worth the brunch price. The only things I enjoyed was the French toast and the risotto balls. The mac was wet when it should've been thick, the potatoes wet excessively salty, and the yogurt was very flavorless. I was more disappointed with seeing that this was the quality of a restaurant in the W. Sorry, but I truly expected better.
2017-08-04,2,Halifax has horrendous service. They served sour wine and acted like it was an inconvenience to pour a new glass. Waited over an hour for appetizer, 20 minutes per drink, and another hour and a half for dinner. When given the check, the waiter gave me a bill for the wrong table. I approached the manager and he seemed too busy to care- worst management staff I have experienced. I'm very disappointed because the food was wonderful, but will never go back due to the horrific management and service. Manager should be fired. Good luck to the chef!
2017-08-03,1,Disappointed  the food was BLAH,...yelp listed the restaurant as #1 in the area nevertheless,:-the food was room temperature (appetizer & main dish) -Couldn't appreciate the flavor-the pasta was undercooked The best part about the meal was the dessert
2017-08-03,5,I was able to go to Halifax on a recent Saturday afternoon to enjoy their BOMB weekend brunch. The setup is that of a tasting menu with all of the brunch small plates brought out to you. You can have as much as you want and get seconds of things you like the best. We were there for a B-day party and they even had the birthday girl's name on the top of the menu cards (talk about attention to detail). The view from the front of the restaurant is wonderful (hello NYC) and did I mention that there are essentially bottomless mimosas as well? Price for 2 with tip was around 80-90 bucks and worth every penny. This is definitely worth it for a large group or just a nice treat for you and a significant other.
2017-07-30,5,I had been here for dinner before with my family, and it was a good experience. Lots of flavor, great staff. But the brunch is superb and one of my top brunch experiences. The small plates concept for brunch is very innovative with unlimited options and champagne. Great value and overall experience. I highly recommend it.
2017-07-21,4,The food was great.. served creatively.. and the space with a view of the Hudson River and the NYC skyline is amazing.Halifax makes it easy to share food with friends which is what dinning out is all about. My friend David took me there for my birthday.. we had a lot of fun picking what we would share. There are a number of "sharing plates" and you can also order a charcuterie plate picking either 3 or 5 choices from cured meats, pate, cheeses, smoked fish, etc.. Their was also least least 10 "sharing dishes" -- small plates -- on the menu which ranged from Deviled Eggs to Sea Bream Tatar.Missed ReservationsI made the reservation at Halifax the night before and arrived a few minutes before the start time. I let the hostess know my name and that I was meeting a friend. She couldn't find my reservation. I also inquired if perhaps my friend had already arrived? I made sure she had my name spelled correctly. She did seat me in one of the two dinning rooms (plus they do have an outside area), without any fuss. I texted my friend telling him I had arrived and giving him walking directions... but he told me he was already there.. the room was rather empty and I didn't see him. it turns out he was seated in the other room; i got up and found him. If not for the invention of cell phones... and text messaging we could have spent an entire night waiting for each other.Given that the reservation was for 2 people, it should have been kept open until both were seated, and/or they should have been able to look back and see prior reservations (from that same evening). There was one large table in the 2nd room, but otherwise (6:30 pm on a Tues) there was no more than 7 or 8 other tables. They should have known that there was 1 person seated alone (waiting), who was part of a party of 2 (1 of whom hadn't arrived). The service was great...  at times it was hard for me to understand the waiter... he certainly went out of his way to help us. At no time were we ever given an apology regarding the reservation and the mix-up by any of the staff. When we left the lady who had seated me was working a different station and there was a different hostess; perhaps that was part of the confusion if staff were switching or covering for each other -- still given the prices and it's location within the W Hotel -- this shouldn't have been an issue.The FoodAll of the food was good some of it great, and looked very nice on the plate. When seated at 6:30 the waiter let us know that of the two specials only 1 of each was left. With a large party already seated that made sense, but was disappointing.We started w/ Sea Bream Tartar (a generous portion): tasty, with notes of cucumber or herbs; highly recommended.Then came the charcuterie plate (five items): duck liver pate, goat and blue ewe cheeses, some smoked trout, and cured pork. It came with a bountiful amount of toast points, and accompaniments... like mustard, diced guava paste, small dried berry maybe currents and more. The pate was an ample portion served in a small glass jar. There was also a fair amount of the smoked fish. The other items (pork, and two cheeses) seemed to be esp. small portions. There certainly was plenty of food (and toast points) but I think the portions could have been 10 to 20% larger, esp. the cheeses which seemed laughably small.We ordered sharing plates: poached shrimp, lamb meatballs and deviled eggs. I am a huge fan of deviled eggs.. these were good. Well chilled and tasty.. but not particularly "deviled." They served 3 of them on the plate; not bad for an appetizer  -- but a) given that we were a party of 2 it seems oddly odd. That is the waiter could have easily asked the kitchen to round out the plate so it was evenly divisible. The waiter could have also informed us about the # of items on the plate. b) I also think it's a very odd # of items for a sharing plate that will always come up "wrong" for a table with 2 or 4 people. After our sharing plates, we ordered a smoked chicken entree which we shared along with some potato wedges. Both were tasty; I would order them again. They didn't offer to split it, nor bring fresh small plates (we used the same side plates we started with). The lamb meat balls were small and tasty and came four to the plate. I would certainly order them again. The Poached Shrimp (like the eggs) came 3 on the plate. The waiter should have told us. Unlike the other dishes however the Shrimp isn't a dish I would recommend. They were large shrimp but seemingly no different than what you might find in a typically Shrimp Cocktail. They may well have been cooked in liquid at a low temperature (poaching) but they easily could have been cooked at a slow boil and cooled in ice water. They were not over-cooked but not succulent like Thomas Keller's butter poached Lobster.For dessert we shared a strawberry short-cake made with angel food cake; no whole strawberries, small diced jam like pieces; I would not order it again.
2017-07-17,5,Went here for weekday lunch - great food and great friendly service - we selected a range of cheeses and cured meats to start.  Lovely presentation and then I had fish and chips - huge portion and the fish had a great crisp.  Our server was attentive and added to the experience.  Restaurant is great for people watching folks walking along the Hoboken promenade - highly recommmended.
2017-07-13,4,Smoked chicken was amazing. View was terrific. Service was good. Nice upscale place. Not too loud. Good for a date. Right on the waterfront
2017-07-12,5,Thank you yelp for an awesome recommendation. This place is incredible. Love the location, place, customer care and the restaurant. Our waiter Benjamin provided with best recommendations with food and drinks. Definitely coming back. Walk after the dinner next to Hudson is pretty. 5 stars for food, hospitality, location and restaurant .
2017-07-09,5,Halifax never disappoints! Love coming here, for dinner and brunch. If you are into the brunch culture, definitely check out Halifax! The "bubbles brunch" is champagne paired with unlimited small plates. So so good.
2017-07-08,3,They seemed to have a bit of an issue with their operations, but I'm going to try to not let this tint my review.The food was good, but not great. The menu did provide a good sampling, but my favorite dish was the smoked salmon and the gazpacho.Alyia was a saint.  She sat us outside with our service animal and within 20 min it got a bit sunny.  She moved us to a nice shady spot, but sadly that seemed to throw a kink into the service. We sat for for almost a half an hour without food because apparently Halifax couldn't deal with a table change.  This made us super disappointed in the establishment because they failed to deliver our dishes, however Alyia kept us calm throughout and is the only reason why I'd give this establishment another try. Note to management, your price points for the unlimited all you can eat and drink is fantastic, however, it would serve you better to have more staff outside.
2017-07-03,4,Great decor, fantastic view, and amazing food!! I will definitely be back again! I highly recommend the sea scallops and the Strawberry Shortcake for dessert (comes with pistachio iceceam). Also I'd give the bread a 9 out of 10.The only annoying thing is I called 3x to attempt to make a reservation during their business hours but no one answered the phone! I finally was able to get through the 4th time around and was able to book a reservation for the upcoming week - the hostess confirmed I had a reservation. However, I come to find out that they do not have a record of my reservation once I arrive there?!? It ended up not being a huge deal because there were ample tables outside, but I do not have patience for incompetence (sorry for not being sorry).FYI you can book a reservation on OpenTable. But the reason I had to call is because they do not allow reservations for 4+ people via OT.I'd like to come back for their brunch because I heard it's pretty good. But I guess I will have to double confirm my reservation going forward.
2017-07-03,5,Halifax is truly what dreams are made of. Came here a few weeks back for brunch after my friend took her CFA exam and we were all prepped for an aggressive day of drinking. The rest of the crowd at Halifax definitely didn't have the same agenda though. Despite our antics, the wait staff was mad cool and nice and filled up our champagne as we chugged our way through the afternoon. The food was SO good, zero clue what I was putting in my mouth but I loved every second of it. My friend's boyfriend is way boughier than the rest of us and says its the best brunch in the entire NYC area, so do yourself a favor and do brunch here or probably regret it forever
2017-06-22,1,Service was really bad. Went with a party of 4 on a Tuesday night 7PM - it was not busy.Drinks came about 5 min. after appetizers - appetizers took a long time - Food was just ok. The fritters were good.. but id say everything else was just ok. The service def. makes this place not worth it. 2nd round of drinks took about 20 min. to come.
2017-06-12,4,Good food, good service, friendly staff, average pricing for the area, street parking or valet, variety of options.
2017-06-11,2,(Tldr - waited over an hour and a half for entrees on a fairly slow night. Over charged. No discount given.)We were really looking forward to trying this place after hearing great things about their brunch, so we decided to head over for dinner last night (Saturday). Perhaps we came on an off night - but we had an unfortunate service experience.We had made a reservation for 8:30 but arrived about 20 minutes early to see if we could snag a table before then. When we walked in we noticed several (as in, a dozen or so) open tables and asked for a table for 2. The hostess told us they were booked solid for the evening. We let her know we were very early but had a reservation at 8:30 and she instantly sat us at one of the 8 open tables outside.  At the beginning, service was fairly prompt and we placed our orders (apps and entrees) by 8:20. We received our apps by about 8:45, one of which was the steamed mussels which were already cold when we received them, but we did not feel it was worth mentioning. After we finished apps we watched as the tables near us were finished and checked out. Soon we were one of only maybe 3 tables outside and inside had cleared out significantly. We sat mostly unattended until 9:35 when the hostess finally came over and asked if we needed our check. I let her know we had not yet received our entrees and she seemed genuinely concerned/confused as she had seated us an hour and a half prior. She and our waiter spoke and then checked with the kitchen, and came back to say the kitchen was very busy which was why our food had taken so long. We were a little surprised given we had watched the restaurant steadily becoming more empty, but decided to wait anyway. Our food finally came around 9:45. To their credit, our food was very tasty and our entrees at least were slightly warmer than our appetizers.When we finally got the check around 10:15 or so, our waiter did not offer anything discount off the menu (nor did we ask) but we did notice that we were charged extra for a drink that did not even appear on their drink menu. We brought it to their attention and they changed it (without apology.)We recognize that if there was kitchen back up, it certainly would not have been the fault of our waiter. However, if that had been the case it would have been appreciated if we had notice of that. Still, looking at all the other tables coming in, receiving their meals, and getting checked out all before we received our entrees made it a little hard to believe it was simply kitchen backup rather than an error in adding our orders or simply forgetting to make our plates. If that was the case, we would have been willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and returned with optimism had they been honest about it or offered some sort of courtesy discount or a free drink, anything. Sadly this was not the case, and so we're likely to take our business elsewhere and warn our fellow Hobokians to use their time and $$$$ more wisely than we did.
2017-05-28,5,I highly recommend Halifax for brunch! I came as part of a 14 person group and they had exceptional service and the the food was on point.  I consider myself a fast eater but they were bringing out more small plates than I could keep up with, and every item was delicious.  They were great about clearing the table of items once we were finished, but not so soon as to rush us.  The French toast with the maple whipped cream was hands down the best French toast I've ever had!The service was great, there's a great view of the Hudson, great food, and the bill was accurate.  I will definitely be back.
2017-05-22,5,This is a review for the Halifax brunch and for our amazing server Ashley.Hoboken has very few bottomless brunches (which has always surprised me, bros love manmosas). But Halifax, (formerly Zylo, and can't remember what before that), has come to the rescue of boozy brunches in the mile square.We came with my 2 month old and 2 other family members. It was a chilly Saturday so we sat inside. Ashley, who is just a frickin rock star came over and coached us through brunch and the array of options. It's basically $40 for unlimited small plates and champagne. Now they give you good sparkling wine, not Andre. It goes for $68 a bottle at night, so not Dom but good. The amount of food you get is staggering, even if you don't request a second of a plate. Ashley had a system and we trusted her, and she was spot on. End on the french toast...trust me..no really, don't say "I'm not listening to this jackass on yelp, I'm starting with it", no end with it. It's the dessert of the meal.We tried it all (I skipped seafood dishes), and everything was really great. Only two things I didn't love, the chicken thigh sliders and rice ball, the rice ball just needed seasoning with the filling. Everything else was delicious. The yogurt was by far the best parfait I've ever had in my life. The little ham sandwiches, so good. The cheese puff BLT, what an awesome concept.We opted for a couple seconds of things, mostly the french toast and parfait.Also, the champagne is filled and there are 3 juice bottles on the table for you to mix, match or ignore. Blueberry, Strawberry and OJ. The blueberry and strawberry were my favorite, combined they were even better.I really hope Management reads this, because Ashley is a star, she was friendly, fun and we called her coach for helping us navigate this lengthy meal. She was also training another server, good call Halifax, she should train everyone. Get a reservation cause they get booked, but come here for brunch. This makes Zylo look like Denny's.
2017-05-21,4,Great Food and Ambience, Spotty service...We were treated to the corner table for a late Saturday night dinner. Stunning views of the Hudson River and NYC skyline were a nice compliment to the beautiful decor of the restaurant. The appetizers came out first and were tasty and presented well. After a long wait the drinks came out after our apps, and were good not great. Decent cocktails however the alcohol content varied greatly between rounds.After fighting off an over-aggressive busboy who kept trying to take our plates with food still left on them, the entrees came out. I had that nights special, a seafood risotto topped with soft shell crab and it was delectable. Everyone at the table seems to enjoy there dishes as well. Compliments to the chef.5 stars for the food, 4 stars for the bartender and waitstaff.
2017-05-21,1,We had dinner last night. The service and food was horrible! First the lamb meatballs came out cold. No big deal, they brought them back and we were quickly served hot dish. Then while waiting for our dinner the waiter came over and handed us dessert menus. We haven't even had our main course yet. He was very inattentive and other waiters had to come over. Then we got our main courses. I had the special, seafood risotto. It was RICE with a whole soft shell crab  cut in half and placed on the dish. The shrimp and squid were non existent. Then my husband's gnocchi came out. It was burnt and oily. The chef who allowed this food to be served should be ashamed of themselves. All the time we were sitting there with our main course the waiter was MIA. So sad, will NEVER go back.
2017-05-20,5,This was the best brunch I've been to since moving to New York! I went with a friend I was visiting in Hoboken and we had a 2 hour time limit for all you can drink/eat. The service was impeccable and they always made sure we had bubbles in our drink! The food comes out as it's prepared and you get to try everything in the menu in little plate forms and then you can ask more of one thing afterwards. Definitely a spot for anyone who is not a picky eater!! You get to try new things you may not have picked originally so it was great! I will most definitely be coming back! Side note: you have to make a reservation before hand because it gets so busy!
2017-05-14,2,I have come to the bubbles brunch many times before so I wasn't hesitant to come again with a group of 10 for Mother's Day. Boy was I wrong? Our waitress Ashley was very cold and not friendly at all. Every question or request was met with a very short cold response. It took 30 mins for her to bring a margarita and she completely forgot to bring a sprite. It was a complete hassle to get refills on our plates even though it was all you can eat. I was so upset with the service. But of course she didn't care because her tip was already included. The food was good as always. This definitely deterred me from returning - holiday or not.
2017-05-11,4,Brunch is tapas stile ! Unlimited mini bites of the entire menu for $21 add a bottle of bubbles  $29  unlimited mimosas and yummy food #breakfast #brunch #mimosas #bubbly #bubbles #champagne #bacon #eggs #views #hoboken #yummy #foodie
2017-05-10,1,The ambiance of the restaurant was appealing.  We came in at what was apparently the end of the bartenders shift. Judging by her attitude toward us.  We had 2 rounds of drinks and tipped her generously ($30).  As we were walking out we heard her say to her co-worker "*#cking rich white brigade is leaving".  I asked her what she said and she told me "it's none your business I'm talking to my friend".  This is an upscale establishment with pretty good food and is part of the W hotel.  I've eaten here probably 6 times in the 8 months it's been open.  I've referred dozens of clients here and the colleagues I brought here tonight were all from out of town.  I can confidently say I will never enter this restaurant again and will highly advise all of my clients to do the same.  Blatant racism and poor customer service
2017-05-01,5,Great food? Yes. Great atmosphere? Yes.Great service? Blew me away!Our waitress (Ashley) was fabulous - I'm certain the food would've been able to stand on its own, but the great service really made the experience top notch.  Do yourself a favor and try the salt cod & shrimp fritters - they are to die for!!! We also tried a special appetizer that they had - a raw tuna dish - the tuna was fresh and the dish was well balanced.If you're a fan of scallops you'll be more than pleased with the scallop entree. Was extremely impressed by the service/ambiance/food (just everything) and will definitely come back next time we're in North Jersey.
2017-04-28,5,I mean... what's not to like about Halifax?Swanky vibes? CheckPosh decor? Uh huhhhh A unique menu with fresh seafood? YUPExcellent cocktails? You bet And on the Hoboken waterfront to boot. Halifax, we're going to be besties. I've been in a few times for cocktails but finally had to chance to try some eats. On Tuesday night they have a special tasting menu that comes with 5 small plates and 5 small wine pours for 29.00. The plates are small but five amounts to a pretty solid sized meal. And the pours are small but five amounts to at least 2 glasses. So for 29.00 this is a pretty solid deal, especially considering how nice of a place Halifax is.The courses included a small cheese and meat plate, salmon crudo, some green veggies (asparagus, I think?), short rib with sweet peas and a sweet strawberry biscuit with ice cream for dessert. There were a variety of pours including red, white, rose, champagne and vermouth. The standout of the meal was definitely the short rib, which was juicy and flavorful. This was also a pretty large piece of meat for a 'small plate'. The service was a bit slow, but when you're hanging out in a place like Halifax it's really hard to complain about anything. Plus, our server was incredibly sweet. I want to come back for everything. I want to come back for their bottomless brunch - it's something like 32 dollars for unlimited bubbly and small plates. I want to come back in the summer and enjoy a drink on the patio, and I want to return for a regular dinner and try out some of the entrees. I've been eyeing the lobster pasta.Halifax, you've won me over!
2017-04-25,3,Was there this past weekend with family and I could say was, "meh."We are a little later in the night and maybe that's our mistake, but the bass was thumping from the club upstairs which took a bit away from the ambiance, still a beautiful view though.Food itself was good, although for the prices paid that was what I would expect. Service was, okay. All in all i suppose I just had higher expectations for Halifax. Seems to want to be a higher end establishment when, in my opinion, it failed to differentiate itself from a Legal Seafood type chain.
2017-04-24,5,I went there with my husband on Sunday Brunch!Their brunch special is a key for success! Unlimited small plate + sparkling wine! It comes with OJ and a mixed berry sirup to make your own drink!So they bring all the plates, about 16! And then if you want more of something you can ask for it!Impressive and delicious choices!To be honest after all this food you might not even get more! I did because I am a fan of smoke salmon but that was it.They do not hesitate to refill your glass! The service was pretty much perfect.Servers + bussers. They were all very smily, super nice and pay attention to every single guests!I would say it is one of the best Brunch I ever had (Manhattan or Hoboken)Great deal, great service, great music!
2017-04-06,5,My review is very similar to the many others on here. I'll start that I came here with 9 others for brunch. The interior of this place is stunning. Especially on a nice day. With the large windows and bright inside, makes for a very happy mood setting. The brunch deal (for larger groups not sure how it works for a small party): each person gets one bottle of champagne (this can get tricky because if you don't have a good server your bottles are held captive until the waiter/waitress comes to refill your glass, and with a brunch place as popular as Halifax this could definitely happen). Regardless of whether or not your waiter comes the brunch still ends after 2 hours...Luckily our server, Hector, was so great! I know tending to a large group can be crazy but my glass was always full! No one left hungry or sober so overall brunch was a huge success :)
2017-04-03,4,Made a reservation in advance for a group of 7 with ease for a Sunday boozy brunch. Upon arriving there was a short wait as the staff was still setting up our table. It seemed like brunch was popular here as the staff looked stressed, but they remained attentive and service was on point. We all participated in the bottomless brunch- unlimited champagne (+ fresh strawberry juice, orange juice) and unlimited small plates. Overall the small plates were delicious. The food is portioned based on number of people in the party. A pleasant dining experience here. Gratuity was automatically included in our bill.
2017-03-26,4,We had a birthday brunch with 8 girls. The food and was great and varied and they kept up with the champagne. Our favorites were the risotto balls, the sliders, and the ham and cheese sandwiches. Lovely spot as well inside the W and very reasonably priced. They served our little cake we brought for us and we're very nice. Will be back again!
2017-03-26,4,Had their bubbles brunch. Awesome presentation and dining format. All plates are brought out at once and it feels like a feast. The quality of the food didn't match up unfortunately and while it wasn't disastrous I certainly feel like the taste falls behind other 4 star restaurants.
2017-03-21,5,The bottomless brunch is an abolutely amazing deal. Unlimited bubbly and delicious small plates make it an absolute must! Halifax is perfect for groups and birthdays, and the outdoor seating is perfect for summer!
2017-03-14,2,Where do I begin? I'm not one to leave reviews but this was one for the books. I came here a few weeks ago to celebrate a birthday with my son and family. We came for brunch which we had heard so much about. We were a large party so we had to go through the party planner. Our issues didn't really begin there, she was prompt and friendly and set everything up for us. We were very excited to have reserved a great spot. The day of we showed up about 10-15 minutes early. It was quite the scene, the workers were running, people everywhere, plus strange loud music. It's brunch so I understood plus the planner mentioned it would be this exact scene so it was fine. We were settled in about 20 minutes after our reservation time. But because it was a celebration we weren't to bothered. Once we got settled and started with our champagne and mixers we waited for the food to begin. And waited and waited and waited. When the food finally started coming out there wasn't enough. They were sending food to one table and then nothing to the others. My real frustrations started when I tried to get the attention of the female manager. She was obviously overwhelmed and stressed by the whole scene. She apologized and said she would bring more food right away. We kept waiting. Barely anything was coming out for our tables. We began to get more unsettled because this is a timed brunch. Is that the game they play? Pay for 2 hours and not feed anyone until it's almost done? I asked the female manager if there was someone else I could speak with. I saw her go over to an older man and he brushed her off. I kept waiting for him to stop by our tables. He introduced himself as the general manager and was probably the rudest manager I have ever encountered. In so many words he told me ma'am it's brunch that's what you get. He kept smirking and brushing it off as if it wasn't an issue. I was so floored by his handling of the situation that I let my son take it from there. The managers demeanor went from amused to uninterested. Somewhere in the mix of things they ran out of champagne. I thought it was a joke, but it absolutely was not. I have been to this restaurant many times as a Hoboken local, brunch included. Needless to say I won't be coming back. And I truly hope they reconsider some of the management they have. Beautiful location but terrible staff. Save yourself from the brunch mess.
2017-03-12,3,Made reservations for 4 and a highchair late last week and had no problem getting time for us to eat at 11:15. We were sat down immediately and were told we had 2 hours from sit down for our brunch. 3 of the 4 adults did bottomless brunch which was a plus ($32 and $23 for no alcohol). We ordered fruit and yogurt for the toddler and I was surprised it took so long to bring out. We ended up getting to try each item on the menu and most of the food was very good! Down side is that service was not organized and it food came out of kitchen sporadically. We went 15-20 minutes at a time with no food. We didn't end of leaving until 2:30. We were told Kitchen was backed up and by the end of our meal, we were given so much food at once it was hard to taste each item. The concept it unique and the price is right, the service needs a lot of work.
2017-03-01,2,Clearly, I am missing something.Based on the reviews online and the yummy menu options, I thought on a spur of the moment Saturday trip to Hoboken this would be the place! WRONG!Service: We were sat at a hightop next to the bar and were told that the bartender would be serving us, no problem, I'm cool with that.  So we're looking over the bottomless brunch options, 5 minutes goes by... ten... fifteen... finally I look at my husband and say "let's go".    No sooner does a waitress pop over, set us up with place settings and tell us the bartender will be right there. After me telling her how long we've waited she takes our order but the bartender still continues to be our main server.  She popped over a few times during the meal, not to see how we were or how our food was, but to just put in orders.  Each time we asked for the menu items sans aioli, and each time she'd repeat and acknowledge the 'sans sauce' request but every time the plate arrived guess what? aioli everywhere.  She wasn't even present for a complaint.  Worst service I have experienced, hands down.The food:  It was okay.  Perhaps the dinner options are better.  I hated that everything was slathered in a mayonaise based sauce, on top of a mayo sauce, or with a mayo sauce somewhere near it. This would be fine if somewhere under the menu options it stated what came with it, but it was always a unpleasant surprise.Bottom line:  Not even worth my time to try a second time.  Brunch left such a (literal) bad taste in my mouth that I wouldn't even give it a second chance.  Rare for me.
2017-02-25,5,Came here for happy hour and $1 oysters. Pretty fresh oysters. Ambience is classy. Passion fruit martini is a must get.
2017-02-22,4,Very nice place, food was great. We had the salmon, and the lamb bolognese pasta. Good date spot.
2017-02-19,3,Went here yesterday with my SO for date night. The restaurant was absolutely gorgeous and it ended up being a nice night, but not without a few bumps. First and foremost, our waiter looked incredibly bored and did NOT want to be there. My SO wasn't able to taste the wine before he ordered (the waiter never came back with a sample) and our apps came out before our wine did. We were waiting for the waiter to come back to put in our main course before we finished our apps, but he never did. Eventually we asked other waiters for help, which we received 10x better than our original guy. The food was OK. It was good, but not great. The starter of shrimp/cod fritters and the assorted dips were delicious! My SO ordered the lobster rigatoni while I had the chicken. The pasta was delicious and lobster fresh, but my chicken was REALLY DRY. Almost like sand. I needed an entire glass of water to choke it down. I had panna cotta for dessert and it was lovely. The ambiance made up for what the food lacked - it was really romantic and private and we'd go back, perhaps for lunch.
2017-02-19,3,This was the second time I have been here for brunch. The deal for bottomless brunch and champagne is great and definitely worth coming for. Nothing on the food menu is superior but a few things are good like the French toast and burgers. This would be a 5 star if it wasn't for the horrendous service. Throughout the meal she was non existent except to give us our check an hour early. Everything else we needed we had to go out of our way to flag someone down who was never her. You are allotted two hours for food and champagne, our service was meant to end at 1:15pm however starting at 12:55 it was easy to overhear our server telling the other staff to no longer provide us with food, water, or anything else as "our time was up and she wanted to get another table". My boyfriend ordered coffee and I asked to top off my drink at 1:05 and she stated oh your time is over I can't help you please pay and leave. I stated that it was not yet 115 and she demanded that I  show her my phone to see the time. Not only were we still customers but even if we had been over the "time limit" it is incredibly rude to behave that way. I have worked in the service industry for 5 years. Our male server in our previous experience was fantastic however this woman was one of the worst service experiences I have ever had in my life.
2017-02-19,5,I don't usually write reviews but felt I needed to after dining at Halifax.  This was one of the best meals I've had in a long time.  Started with the crispy vegetable appetizer, which was delicious.  Followed it up with the NY Strip, which was a perfectly cooked, extremely tender, amazingly tasteful piece of meat with the most delicious potato croquettes and salad on the side.  Drinks were great and was a nice atmosphere - excellent meal for a reasonable price.  Will definitely be going back.
2017-02-15,1,i don't even know where to start.We drove up and sat there waiting a couple minutes for valet, finally came around and just stared at us.. we had to ask them if they were the valet and if they could take our car. We walk in and said we had reservations for 8:30, and they told us that they were backed up from the "first seating" (there was no first seating it was just a mess) and we had to wait a couple minutes. Unfortunately that ended up being a half hour. Someone sitting at the high top next to us left angrily because nobody even asked if he wanted a drink. The manager saw that he left and sent someone over to us and we ordered drinks but never saw them. After telling the hostess we were going to leave, we finally got a table. The waitress came over and got us drinks in 5 minutes, and right after she brought us our drinks, the first waitress brought us the drinks we ordered 20 minutes before. We told her we already got drinks and weren't going to drink them, and she walked away with a sour face. We got our first appetizer before bread, had to ask for bread, and then had to wait 20 minutes before each meal. Each table around us was waiting a while too. Looking around, I saw waiters joking around, taking breaks, and overall neglecting the tables. Our reservations were for 8:30 and we didn't get to leave the restaurant before 11:30. It was a mess and a horrible choice for Valentine's Day. Speaking of, they passed out roses to certain tables and not others. Also, our waitress was barely present but got away with an included tip of 36 dollars which was completely unfair and undeserved. The included tip was probably why nobody was doing any work. It's unfortunate because the food was pretty good.
2017-02-01,4,#Halifax happy hour is a must do! They have a great selection of wines, beers, and speciality cocktails. They also have a selection of bites to enjoy. We had a Yelp event in one of their private rooms so this was my first time back in the main dining area. It's a lovely place with great views of the city. Throughout the night, the bartender was attentive, friendly, and he made a delicious (strong) gin based drink for me. I had the Corpse Reviver -classic cocktail: hendricks gin, lillete, absinthe. Priced at $14 but half off for HH (until 7 PM). The drink was strong! We shared a few items on the menu: the beef sliders, artisan cheddar cheese plate, but the winner of the night was the dessert!  I was bummed when I asked the bartender for some of the dessert items I saw on Yelp but he said the menu has changed and they were no longer offered. I settled for the Maple Creme Brûlée--candied pecan shortbread, dried cranberries. So good! When's the next happy hour trip to Halifax!? #Hoboken
2017-01-30,5,Simply blown away! This was my first brunch experience and definitely not my last! We were a large group of 15 and I dealt directly with Roxann. She was so patient with me and all of my questions, menu changes, pricing details, etc. I'm an event planner and I know how annoying clients can be when it comes to booking. She was incrediably sweet and answered all of my questions within hours of sending!This place is beautiful. We were seated in the back along the wall with an amazing view of the skyline. Champagne never stops flowing and the pear and orange juice is replenished as needed. I was able to pick 10 menu items that were served family style. They did not disappoint. My boyfriend got 3 orders of "family style" french toast - that's how delicious it was! They even added a "Happy Birthday Roe!" to the top of all the menus. If I had to make a suggestion, it would be on the bill. The price is $35 which does not include tax or tip. When I asked if tip was included with a large party, I was told it wasn't. However, when the bill came, a "service charge" was added on. If I hadn't known, I would've added an additional 20% on top. But as you can see - a small issue nonetheless lol. We paid $46 a person and I don't think you can beat it for the quanity and quality of Halifax. My friends and I can't wait to come back!!!
2017-01-27,1,I came here for my sister's birthday and am truly appalled with the service provided. I have never encountered a hostess as nasty and classless as I have here both in person and over the phone. The food is fine, but this place in general is way over-hyped. I've been treated better TSA agents.
2017-01-24,2,I've been going to the Bubbles Brunch for a couple years now, back from when Halifax was called Zylo. My friends and I celebrated numerous birthdays and other occasions there, so we've been there many times. Each time, it seems more and more restrictive. We had a great first impression when we started going... the service was amazing, the food was delivered to the table quickly, and all alcoholic beverages were included (bloody mary's, mixed drinks, even shots!), not just champagne. Then we noticed that they were cutting back on the drinks (no shots allowed), and eventually, they allowed only champagne. This was fine because unlimited food and champagne for 2 hours was still a great deal for $29. However, the service became worse and worse every time we went, and we started second-guessing going there for birthdays and events.However, I began planning my daughter's first birthday party, and had the idea to make a reservation there for our group (about 30 people). When I touched base with the event person there, Roxann, she informed me that the price for groups is $35/person for unlimited food and champagne, but I could only choose 10 items off of the menu. When I asked for clarification that not only the price is higher, but they are also limiting the food, Roxann confirmed that, yes, that is correct. (She also noted that the general price was raised to $32/person in the new year, but that the group event price was $35/person.) Since I had been a very long-time, loyal customer of the place, I asked if there was any way she could meet the $32/person price, and if so, I would make the reservation, but she was completely unwilling to budge at all on price or what they offer. Needless to say, i did not book my event there, and it left a very bad taste in my mouth. I won't be returning there under any circumstances.
2017-01-17,4,I was finally able to come for brunch at Halifax.  $22 all you can eat + $7 to add "champagne" (in reality, it's to add Cava, but any bubbles is okay with me) and they brought over orange juice and pear juice to mix with the cava as well.   Fare being offered is fairly standard brunch items, not too focused on anything nova scotian.  What's great is that they brought little portions of the entire menu for each member of the table - so everyone got to try every single item; then can order additional items as wanted.  It was a unique way to do an all you can eat brunch, and I'm happy that I didn't have to get up and wait on a buffet line.   The standouts of the afternoon was the poached egg (mmmm), the French toast, and the chicken and waffles -- and you can never go wrong with smoked salmon, bacon, or sausage.  Literally we finished everything that was brought to us and were so full at the end.  The cons: someone ordered a coffee and it was never brought to the table.  Also, the sliders they brought over were cold. It was a little daunting to get the waiter's attention - we were snuggled in the corner, so maybe it's better to have a table in the center of the floor. I wasn't in a rush, so the service woes didn't phase me too much during this brunch occasion and I'm sure I'll come back with other friends to eat, drink, and be merry.
2016-12-24,5,I love going to Halifax for brunch. We've been 5-6 times already and the food is spectacular. The all-you-can-eat tapas style brunch is the best food at the best price you can find. The staff is present and mindful and I've always had a good experience whether I'm there with one other person or as a party of 8. I also have dietary restrictions and they are always very careful to make sure I'm taken care of. I can't recommend Halifax place enough.
2016-12-18,5,This place is amazing. Went here for a birthday brunch... $29 all you can eat & drink champagne with juices for 2 hours. Most of the dishes were delicious - favorites are the french toast, mac & cheese, smoked salmon, potato fingerlings, shrimp ceviche, and deviled eggs. Can't wait to go back!!
2016-12-13,2,A disappointment ... specifically, the service.  We were a large party, with an early reservation for a special affair (so we could go upstairs and celebrate).  The service was just not good, as there were about four - five employees waiting on us, however, the drinks only arrived after continuous reminders, and when they did come, they were wrong for several of us, several times.  Look, I get that larger parties (12) take some work, but we were expected and they had plenty of staff.  Also, at least two of the servers were not good with their English, and caused for some of the confusion/delays, I suspect.  None of us knew who was taking the lead as main-server, and he/she was hard to get a hold of when things started to go wrong.  Food was good, but nothing great.  Nice ambiance, and in a good spot.I give two stars because I think they were trying to get it right, but they failed at so many attempts, and their flawed-service become a topic at the table.
2016-12-13,3,I have been here several times over the past few months for their Bubbles Brunch. Since I don't drink alcohol, we opted for the Bubbles Brunch without champagne which is about $5/pp less expensive. The Bubbles Brunch is unlimited for 2 hours, and they serve the menu items (excluding the raw bar) in 3 stages (approx. 8-10 items per round). The items include such offerings as a yogurt berry parfait, fruit salad, shrimp cerviche, ferro salad, sliders, chicken & waffles, potatoes/mushrooms, etc. Each item is served in tapas size servings based on the number of people in your party. Once you have completed eating one round, they bring the next one. You can also order any of the items you are served again if you really like it. Overall, the food is very good, although there are not as many items as I would have liked for a pescetarian like me. The reason for the 3 stars is the service is lackluster & weak at best. The waiters are not high end, not friendly or personable at all, and literally just put down the food & walk away. It is hard to get their attention when you need a refill or some other item. All in all, this is a decent place for brunch at a fair price. However, if service is your "thing", you may want to keep looking.
2016-12-12,5,My boyfriend and I have heard a lot about Halifax brunch and decided to give it a try last weekend. We walked in around 10AM on Sunday during the prime brunch rush and we were seated at their chef's table (high top table in the center of the restaurant that accommodates a number of small parties). Shortly after sitting, we placed our orders as another couple was being seated at the end of our table. After about 15 minutes of waiting, the other couple received their meals. It wasn't a big deal to us as we figured our food would follow shortly... however the waiter quickly rushed over to apologize for the wait. He explained there was a mix up in the kitchen and offered us a giant plate of pastries to hold us over. Less the 5 minutes after getting the pastries, the chef came out to deliver our dishes and sincerely apologize for the delay! Besides the excellent customer service, the food was amazing! I would almost go as far to say that this is my new favorite brunch place in Hoboken/Jersey City!To top it all off, when we finished our meal and asked for the check the waiter apologized again for the wait and said the meal was on him! It didn't seem as though we really waited than long for our food, but the waiter clearly wanted to ensure we had a good experience and we most certainly did! We will absolutely be coming ba
2016-12-11,4,After a reincarnation from the old Zylo, the place finally got it right, now a legitimate nice farm fresh new American (Canadian) type restaurant rival any of its same class competitors in Manhattan.  Everything I have had there was great, the ham adds a nice touch to the clam chowder, the drinks are fantastic, even down to the seaweed flavored popcorn is unique and delish.  Best part is probably the $1 oysters on weekdays during happy hour, east and west coast selections.  Highly recommend this place!  Nice addition to the otherwise blah mediocre restaurant scene of Hoboken.
2016-12-10,4,I was really impressed with Halifax!What a different type of restaurant.  I went on a Thursday night at 7pm and brought a client.  I made reservations and we were able to sit by the glass to enjoy the spectacular view.  As the night continued on, more and more tables filled up.I ordered the Tom Foolery to drink.  It was quite good but not as sweet as I thought it would be.  The service I will say was excellent.  Our server made a few recommendations but passionately shared that all of the food on the menu was pretty good.We started with a half dozen oysters accompanied by a side of cocktail sauce and vineger.  They gave us a small lemon wedge.  The oysters were all east coast and delicious.We also shared the Relishes and Dips.  They were absolutely delicious.  There was a ricotta one that was so creamy, a butternut squash one and an eggplant one.  I can't say I liked one more than the other they were all excellent.For my main I had the Lobster Rigatoni which was outstanding.  It wasn't heavy, had many pieces of lobster in it, had delicious mushrooms and a nice, light sauce.  The portion was plentiful.  The only comment I will say is that the service was almost a little too much... we did take our time, but we were a little bit rushed to go on to our entree course.  I had a feeling they rushed us because it was ready and they didn't want it to get cold, which is a good thing.  There were a lot of servers that gave us almost a little too much attention, so I guess I would rather have that then not enough.I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed Halifax and definitely recommend it.
2016-12-04,1,Unfortunately we were treated so poorly at Halifax that I cannot recommend it to others. We had a 7:30 dinner reservation and were kept waiting until after 8:15 to be seated. During that time, we were repeatedly ignored by the host as every other party arriving was seated immediately. When we asked what the hold up was, we were treated like an annoyance. When we were finally seated, there was no apology or explanation as to why we had to wait 45 minutes to sit down. Our brusk server rushed us into ordering, only to leave us waiting almost another 45 minutes between appetizers and entrees. The food was fine and the design of the room was beautiful, but it was hard to enjoy these aspects of our experience when we felt so disrespected by the staff. The staff is clearly untrained and the service is inefficient and unfriendly.
2016-11-22,5,I am a HUGE fan of Halifax. I had to go on a diet after leaving, but I can live with the consequences. I came here two weekends ago for a ladies' only brunch. There were 13 of us, and we had a reservation in advance. Because we were a larger group, our menu was pre-set with 10 items from the menu that we chose beforehand. Upon entering, we were greeted with our pre-set menus and champagne. There were different juices (pear, orange juice, or if you wanted to be adventurous you could mix the two together). Dining with a large group can sometimes be a daunting undertaking, but we were able to begin our morning with style and elegance.I love that the menu is served family-style. It allows you to try a little bit of everything, plus they offer unlimited refills! We also took advantage of the bottomless drinks (both for two hours). I can honestly say I enjoyed everything they brought out for us (and yes, I tried everything). From the mini sliders to the fruit bowl to the french toast, I was in heaven. I think my favorites were the smoked chicken mac & cheese and the croque monsieur (I definitely had seconds on both of those). And if I wanted more? Another order was brought out shortly after. The ambiance is great. The space is open and bright with views overlooking the NYC Skyline. When all was said and done, I paid $45 (including beverages, taxes, and gratuity). For all of the food and bubbly we were served, it was definitely worth it.
2016-11-16,1,We were really excited to check out this highly rated brunch spot in Hoboken, but unfortunately, Halifax messed up our reservation. We called four times and each time they seemed utterly confused on the reservation. Our reservation was for 15, but the first time, they noted 10. The second time we called, the  reservation was lost and we had to make another with very specific time constraints. When I go out for food, I'd rather not be rushed, but Halifax makes it clear your time is limited, and honestly, they were not nice about it. The next time we called, we ensured they had our reservation and it was for 15. The day of, when we were 10 MINUTES AWAY, simply a curious call to check in, they said the reservation was for only 10 people, and the only way they could accommodate, was to break up our birthday get together, which again, was a very rude, painful, and confusing conversation. It was my wife's birthday and they seriously made her stressed out and upset. They were not accommodating at all, and if anything, we went out of our way to help THEM. When Halifax found out we went to another place (due to other friends showing up w/o knowing the story), the manager called us and TRIED to correct the situation; however, the manager HUNG UP! Please be cautious when booking reservations because you might have to find another location in the long run. I'm sure the food is good, but the customer service is terrible.
2016-11-13,1,My friends and I were excited to try this place for my birthday.  I made reservations at the end of October for a large party of 10 on 11/12.  A couple weeks later I call to see if I can change the time and the hostess told me I didn't even have reservations.  I was confused but they put me in this time for a party of 16.  I call the day before to ensure everything is okay and set, but the hostess told me my reservation was for the wrong time so I asked them to please change it, only to have them make a big stink about it.  On Saturday I call again to let them know we were 10 mins away because we were 5 mins past our reservation time. The hostess tells me they have my table of 10 and I said it should be for 16. We go back and forth and she hands the phone to the manager. He continues to tell me that it's for 10 and he can only split us up if we want to fit all 16.  I was trying to be accommodating and say we are willing to wait to add another table, but he did not want to do this for us.  After calling 4x and having issues every single time, I decided that we were to go somewhere else and that their food was not worth the hassle they put me through. Once we were at a different restaurant and already settled down, I get a call from the manager and he told me he made a mistake and had me under two different names so they actually DID have a table for 16. I said to him that we were already settled somewhere else and that was not my mistake, but theirs- and he hung up on me.  All in all, they had me under two different names (one misspelled completely) with the same phone number and didn't put two and two together.  I hope one day they get their front of the house in check because I'm sure their food could be great.
2016-11-08,5,Let me just tell you, Ruben was great! He served during the Yelp Elite event, and my fiancé and I had the pleasure to have him as our server. Amazing amazing amazing service. Before I made my way here, I checked the menu online, and was a little bummed that the menu online was different from the current menu. There were items that they stopped serving, such as the drink, main course, and dessert, due to change of seasonal menu. I was disappointed that I didn't get to try the items I found online, but Ruben helped me out in figuring what to order.Our drinks were amazing! Fiancé got the Tom Foolery, and I got the drink from their Summer menu that they were kind enough to make. Couldn't complain about those at all. Bread and popcorn hit the table. Pretty darn good. I kind of forgot we ordered appetizers. We started out with a charcuterie plate and oysters. The charcuterie options are wonderful. The oysters were decent. The mignonette was good.On to main course. I was really really sad that I couldn't order the Sea Bass, but I ended up ordering the Seafood Stew, and I loved it. It was delicious, and the definitely not stingy with the portion. Fiancé ordered the Salmon, and loved it! Flavors complemented each other well, and was light. Both are good options from this restaurant.On to dessert. Aghhh there was a unique dessert from the summer menu that i really, really wanted to try. Butter Toffee Panna Cotta was amazing amazing amazing! We also had the Warm Apple Fritters with really unique dipping sauces.The whole experience was great, and I will come back again and again! From atmosphere, food, drinks, service... Nothing can beat my experience here!
2016-11-07,3,Went to brunch at Halifax yesterday with my wife and 2 other friends. We enjoyed the food (I might still be full), but overall, the experience was very uneven.First, on the good side. The space is absolutely gorgeous - it's modern, with lovely tones, and tons of natural light. My coat kept falling off the back of the chair, but that's a minor quibble. In addition, the actual food for the brunch was excellent. It's tasting menu-style, so they bring out a taste of everything, and you're allowed to order an unlimited amount of anything you like. Some particular highlights were the poached egg with cheddar grits, the French toast with maple cream, and the BLT cheese puffs. Overall, the food was excellent, and the mixers provided for the bubbles were top-notch.However, the service for the brunch is absolutely abysmal. It was some of the worst service I've experienced in a restaurant recently, and it cost them a full 2 stars. It took over 10 minutes to get our server's attention once our whole party was seated. After that, it took at least another 30-40 minutes to get our first plates of food, which is more than a little frustrating since the Bubbles Brunch has a 2-hour time limit. One of our friends ordered a cup of coffee that was flat-out never delivered. One of the plates - the beef sliders - came out cold, and when we pointed this out it was not replaced. Once it was time for us to leave, it took almost an hour for us to ask for the check (which we had to do twice), get it delivered, and then pay.I understand that their brunch concept can be hard to manage, especially with such a large space, but this shouldn't be an excuse. Halifax has the potential for something really special, but I can't see myself going back due to the terrible service. What a shame.
2016-11-06,1,Poor service. We went for the brunch and ordered unlimited small plates. But waited for one hour we only had four plates and there is a time limit for 2 hours! No idea why it's that slow
2016-11-03,5,Blows away the horrible restaurant here before (Zylo's).  I stay at the W a lot and avoided the restaurant because it used to be bad, but Halifax delivers the goods.  It's not overly pretentious but rather it's casually elegant.  It has a great view over the water to Manhattan.  But most importantly the food is delicious.Bibb salad was great, albeit a bit heavy on the dressing.The lobster rigatoni was probably the best lobster pasta I've ever eaten (and that's saying something).  Not too heavy because no cream, perfectly cooked lobster, mushrooms complementing the flavor but not overwhelming.  Perfect - I could have eaten this all night.Two superb drinks - Hemingway dacquiri (not that frozen junk but the real thing) and the Scarlet Letter (mmmmmmmmm) were perfect.Maria was a great waitress - attentive but not overbearing.In the past I've had the Maine cod which was also delicious.  Can't recall other dishes but they all are cooked well and blend flavors in unique but delicious ways.I'll definitely be back.
2016-11-02,4,This is probably the best brunch spot in Hoboken (a title that is akin to win a national election because of the competition; brunch is a bloodsport in this urban hamlet). The deal Halifax offers is great: for $29 you get unlimited brunch and a bottle of champagne (or $21 if you don't want champagne). The twist Halifax offers is that instead of serving big entree dishes, they do small plates instead. You can order as many as you want of whatever is on the menu. The options are vast and mostly yummy. I really enjoyed the seafood ceviche, the chicken wings and waffles, the sliders, the smoked salmon, the french toast and a few others. There's enough different choices that it should make everyone happy. What really puts it together is the environment. You're in a large opening dining room with floor to ceiling windows that give a refreshing natural light and view as you sit near the Hudson River.But just be studious in your preparation. They only allow reservations of 4 or smaller on OpenTable. Those are hard to get and you need to call in for anything bigger. Getting a seat isn't easy.
2016-10-28,5,This place is fantastic.  Great outdoor seating in the warmer months.  Make sure you try the candied smoked salmon.  You will go back for that alone..
2016-10-27,5,My fiance and I came to Halifax before a birthday party for a friend. He chooses restaurants based off of the pictures, and Halifax did not disappoint in any capacity - walking in via the street entrance, the place is stunning.We were greeted by Ruben, who ended up being our server as well, and were led to a seat by the window (ideal for people watching). More on Ruben's incredible service later, since that deserves an entire paragraph of its own. We each settled on drinks - I ordered the California Pinot Noir they had on tap ($13/glass), which was absolutely delicious. My fiance had two vodka seltzers, which he also enjoyed. Warm bread and butter was brought out, which I realize is par for the course, however this was delicious and worth noting (it may also be that I've been on a wedding diet and haven't had carbs in so long, that it's necessary to point out "worth it" carbs whenever possible). We started with the assorted relishes ($14) - a tomato based one, a ricotta (UNREAL), and a fall squash. I cannot sing the praises of these enough - each one was delicious, though the ricotta was a favorite (and one that were the place not so gorgeous, I'd be tempted to scrape the jar and eat it with a spoon). Ruben came by to see if we wanted more bread to finish up the various dips, but at that point, we figured it was best to save what was remaining of our appetites for dinner. I ordered the farro and quinoa ($21), which had golden beets, chard, and goat cheese. My fiance had the lobster rigatoni (full size, $29). My farro/quinoa was perfectly cooked, and was absolutely delicious. There were pieces of goat cheese that melted into the grains and was the perfect accompaniment to the beets and chard. It was healthy, vegetarian, and unique/delicious, which is not an easy combination to find. My fiance's lobster tasted incredibly fresh, and the pasta was beautifully cooked. The dessert menu looked amazing, but we were too full (from all the carbs) to even consider it. We will absolutely be back again, this time ready to go to town on the dessert options.I couldn't finish this review without giving Ruben the HIGHEST possible compliments. I can count on one hand the number of times we've experienced service of this level - he was there to check in (though not in an overbearing way), to offer more bread, to refill water glasses, and was so polite and accommodating that I don't even have enough of a vocabulary to extend compliments his way. He is an asset to Halifax, and a huge reason why we will return for future meals!This truly is a fantastic dining experience, the drinks, food, and service are exceptional, and convenient location of being in the W hotel (with views of the Hudson and NYC skyline) make it all the more special. Cannot wait to return! (And thank you again, Ruben, for such stellar service).
2016-10-25,5,Rueben was an excellent waiter and "David" I believe (the sommelier) was extremely helpful and they both made the meal absolutely heaven! The smoked fish platter was one of the coolest and tastiest appetizers I've ever had. GREAT SERVICE, fast and friendly people, and the food was amazing. I was extremely impressed for hotel dining!
2016-10-12,5,Me and my boi Danny posted up here a few weeks ago during the brunch rush. It was busy as all get out but we copped a few spots at the bar at around 1130, hey its brunch, its kewl to get yoru drink on b4 noon! LMFAO. The spot is popping except this girl who sat next to us and kept calling champain "bubbles." She was hellannoying. She was there wif three other peeple and kept saying "OMG unlimitied small plates and BUBBLES!" Even the nice bartender rolled her eyes everytime the Bubble Girl (think name was like Sara or Sandie) asked for more BUBBLES!!!!This girl was blown away that the memosas weren't pre-made, that she could actually pour orange and strawberry juice into her bubbles. She prolly doesn't brunch much. But me and my boi Danny do so take it from us. This brunch is hellagood. I did'nt eat just got like 10 MANmosas (that's memosa if you are a dude). My boi Danny, He got disco fries which this place calls Putin.
2016-10-11,5,Came here for dinner with visiting relatives, left satisfied and craving more. Portions were on the larger side. The chicken was perfectly cooked, tender to the point of falling off the bone and full of new interesting flavors. The salad was also a wonderful spin on caesar. Beer was a bit pricey though. Sit outside if possible though street is a bit noisy. Would return for brunch!
2016-10-09,5,What a great spot for brunch!  The unlimited brunch at this place is great!  You get to share lots of small plates and have the option of adding champagne.  The small plates vary from appetizers to brunch items to mini sandwiches.  All the food was good, though we did not get through most of it.  The restaurant is beautiful with a great location on the waterfront.  The service was excellent.  We will definitely be coming back.
