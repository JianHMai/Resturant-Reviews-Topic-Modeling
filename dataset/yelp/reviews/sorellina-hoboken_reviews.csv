2021-11-15,5,We were visiting for a few days and all we were looking for was heated outdoor seating and decent food. We were beyond happy to have found Sorellina. Terrific pasta (we had one dish with scallops and one with shrimp), excellent service, and the seating was behind the restaurant, not on the street. Couldn't have been better.
2021-11-14,5,First time having brunch and was not disappointed! When you walk in it's so warm and inviting and i especially love the details: decorative ceilings, green leather tufted booths and nice tables. Music was cool too very relaxed Sunday morning vibe. Host was so handsome and welcoming, server Paige was really sweet and friendly and our food was perfection. We had the marscopone French toast and Taylor ham and cheese spaghetti! So damn good! Will absolutely be back again. Want to try the dinner menu next.
2021-11-07,1,I made my first trip to this restaurant and the hosts were extremely racist and almost refused seating us as a table. We walked in without a reservation and they claimed they were booked for the night. When I pulled up my phone they had reservations within 30 mins of my arrival. Despite having empty tables they rather seated those without reservations ahead and didn't let us get seated till we asked numerous times. Additionally, others who were non-white were not given seating at the restaurant
2021-11-05,2,Took over 90 minutes to receive two pasta dishes. You would think that if you are charging premium prices that the service would be better. Once the food finally arrived, the portions were small relative to the price (do not bother paying $18 for 3 scallops). Poor service aside, there  are much better Italian restaurants to eat at in Hoboken.
2021-11-03,3,I had been to Sorellina once a while back just to grab a daytime cocktail.  Their Bloody Mary's were some of the best that I had ever had, so I was dying to try their cuisine as well.  I should admit that I had heard mixed reviews on the execution of their food, but also knew that their menu changed frequently with the seasons, so I thought it would warrant a chance.  My friend and I ended up there for a weeknight dinner and found the service extremely slow and inefficient.  We ordered glasses of wine, and I went with a Sparkling RoseÃÅ, which was enjoyable.  A server came around and offered us a choice of sourdough, focaccia, or semolina bread, from which I selected the semolina, one of my favorite varieties that tends to be offered less frequently.  We then opted to share the Peach Salad as a starter, but found it insanely salty.  In fact, my friend had wanted to send it back, though I convinced her to persist.  We found it odd that a salad could be so salty, but the greens and peaches were fresh despite that fact.  For my entree, I had selected the Crab Cavatelli, which was unreal!  The pasta was perfectly cooked and included a generous amount of Jonah Crab chunks that were fishy, yet flavorful, as well ripe, local cherry tomatoes, and shavings of fresh pecorino cheese.  Some diners might have found the portion a bit small, but I thought it was actually perfect, especially considering that I had had bread and salad earlier.I feel like Sorellina could be hit-or-miss, but the adorable corner restaurant with the great wine list would be worth a shot to assess for yourself.
2021-09-28,4,We didn't know when we chose this place that we'd picked such a popular spot! Without a reservation, being seated was looking doubtful, but we were able to snag two seats at the bar. This worked out well, as we were greeted by a very friendly bartender named Owen who made sure to take excellent care of us throughout the evening.At the suggestion of the couple next to us, we started with the seared scallop appetizer with ravioli and spicy carrot sauce. The scallops were seared perfectly and the sauce was unique (in a good way). I would totally order this as an entree if given the opportunity. For dinner, we ordered the crab cavatelli and the rigatoni bolognese. I was very close to ordering. a short rib pasta dish, but Owen advised the cavatelli. I was not disappointed! Literally every forkful was also full of crab. I've been thinking about it ever since. I showed a picture of my meal to a friend, and he thought my plate had been covered in cheese. That's how much crab there was! The rigatoni dish was also very good, and I stole a few noodles between bites of my own.We skipped dessert, being too full to continue, but dinner itself was enough. I would definitely recommend Sorellina to anyone looking for good Italian food in Hoboken.
2021-09-04,5,My MOH planned my bachelorette dinner here and it was PERFECT!! We did a five course wine tasting dinner and I enjoyed every wine and every bite. Fun and classy ambiance as well as good service. I hope to be back soon!!
2021-08-10,3,If I could I would give 3 1/2 I would. It's not exactly 4 stars but a not 3They have indoor and outdoor seating, and I did not make a reservation on a Saturday night and getting a table inside was no problem. The food was good, seemed very fresh. I had a crab pasta dish and the appetizers were ok. I had fried calamari and fried cheese . Menu was just a little small in my opinion. I think they could add a few more dishes. It definitely is a unique restaurant you aren't really getting classic Italian dishes but the classics with a twist. For a vegan not really sure if they would have anything to eat here. Aside from that staff was nice and attentive
2021-08-08,3,This restaurant has AMAZING food, from what I was able to order. I was so excited to be seated with a physical menu and not one I needed to download. The options are truly chef inspired and a culinary delight. Our server took our appetizer and drink order and within a few minutes returned with our drinks.. However, he then proceeded to tell us that he could not put out appetizer order in without ordering our entrees at the same time. This was a kill moment. I didn't know what I would be having at that time. We were not given the option for ordering our entrees after our appetizers. So, we ordered our appetizers and we had to end our check. I never had this happen and was more than disappointed that we could NOT order more, as the food was delicious. I hope that they are able to figure out this glitch, so that they are able to appropriately serve their future guests. I will never understand how hospitality is being controled by a "computer won't let me" attitude. After all, what good is having fantastic food, if you can't order it.
2021-07-30,5,Me & my boyfriend ate here two years ago, and we still talk about it every other week. However, I forgot to leave a review two years ago so I'm leaving right now because it is so good & I wish I had it right now.
2021-06-20,1,Completely empty restaurant both outdoor and indoor, and the hostess stated they are only taking reservations only makes zero sense. What business turns down customers, crazy..
2021-06-18,3,I'm giving this place 3 stars because tonight's dish was SO SALTY. I saw someone comment on here as well about the salt and I didn't believe it because I've come here maybe 1 and half years ago and my dish was amazing ... but today it was so salty I actually couldn't eat it. I ordered the cacio Pepe pasta, the photos on Yelp looked amazing. But like I said the salt was unbearable. I was even more frustrated because I got seated at 8:30pm and didn't get my dinner until 10:15pm. And then like I said my dish was salty. Ugh I was disappointed. However the cocktails at this place are AMAZING. I will def be back for drinks and a cheese board .. but nothing sure about the pasta
2021-06-17,1,I really hate how snobby the staff at this place is. I came there at 9:40 today after a long 12 hr working shift for a quick drink and some food/snack. I saw a lot of free tables. 3 guys at the bar were doing nothing. I asked if I can stay for a drink/food, they said of course. I was waiting for maybe 8 minutes to be seated, until one guy finally came to me to tell me they don't sit people after 9:30pm. Fine! I went to the place next block, met there my friends for drinks and took a walk after, and on my way back around 11:40 pm I saw this place still being full of people, having drinks and fun. I have one question, guys: wtf? You have to do better, if you want nice reputation, I use to come here & bring my friends with me, but never again.
2021-06-15,5,We LOVED our dinner. I'm not a big review person but I felt after a pandemic this restaurant really deserved it! Started off with the bruschetta and ordered out entrees. The Vongole was outrageous. Seriously. I ate the entire plate. My girlfriends ordered other pasta entrees and the Branzino. The service was great. I'm so happy I came tonight. I can't wait to come back!!
2021-06-08,5,Made a reservation on Friday night. Ordered cocktails and calamari to start. Calamari was perfectly fried and drinks were good. Entrees were delicious. Loved the pistachio pasta. First time we had pasta like this. And, will order again.  Our server was great too.
2021-06-01,3,Food was ok. I was honestly expecting alot more as I've been waiting to try Sorellina for a while. We went on a Tues night when it wasnt busy, but it took a while for us to get our food. We might try brunch and give it another chance
2021-04-07,5,This is by far my favorite restaurant in Hoboken! The food is always fresh and delicious. I especially love the brussel sprouts and the Cacio e Pepe. Also they have excellent cocktails. Service is top notch. I love to sit outside here. Can't wait to also try their other restaurant across the street, Sirenetta.
2021-04-05,5,Everything is always very good here, and the staff is always knowledgable and quick. We really love to sit outside for safety and fresh air, even when it's chilly -- the heaters work great!  Our ten year old loves the kids' pasta dish, and we find the pasta is always perfectly cooked. If you are looking for a top notch dining experience in Hoboken, you can't go wrong with Sorellina!
2021-03-29,1,This is a hard review for me to write. My husband and I met up with my sister for brunch. I am currently pregnant, and my sister does not know. When we arrived, she had order a mimosa and I ordered a bloody mary. Immediately after ordering, I went inside to "go to the bathroom", but instead.. flagged down the waiter to let him know, "I am pregnant, my sister does NOT know, can you please make me a virgin bloody mary." He said of course and I went back to the table. The drinks get delivered and another waiter brings me my bloody and goes, "Here is your virgin bloody mary." I take it and my sister looks at me weird.. I say, hmm that's strange, maybe they made a mistake. We continue to eat and I order a second drink, this time I say "Can I have the Pimm's Cup?" After I order, my husband now runs into the restaurant, flags down the waiter, lets him know AGAIN "My wife is pregnant, HER SISTER DOES NOT KNOW, please just make her a virgin drink but do NOT SAY it is a virgin drink." The waiter says he understands so my husband comes back to the table. Over 10 minutes go by, wondering where my drink is, and the waiter comes out saying "The drink you ordered is 75% alcohol so unfortunately, we cannot make it a virgin drink.." and I try to keep brushing him off hoping my sister does not realize, he continues to say "Do you want anything else? How about a lemonade?" The damage has been done. I then have to let my sister know I am pregnant, MUCH SOONER than I had planned, and NOT the way I wanted to. I honestly did not think this would be an issue at all, as I have seen my friends go through this multiple times. Of course, it was fun sharing the great news after the fact, but now that this happen I will never eat here again because of this memory. On top of that, my dish was extremely salty.
2021-03-24,2,This is the first bad review I've ever written, but after a second bad experience, just wanted to share to help others make a choice of where to dine. To make a long review short- note to staff, please don't ignore the back corner table of the indoor dining section. It took an hour and 45 minutes to get our meals from the time we walked in (although our luke warm meatball appetizer came out fairly quickly I will say. Besides the temperature it was good). The bread came out after that. Maybe we were forgotten about with those, maybe that's the order this restaurant does it in, I don't know (I don't remember dining somewhere I get bread after the appetizer, but hey maybe this is the way this place does it I don't know) From drinks to food ordering, the table visits were a few minuets too long in between (as you can tell, a total of hour and 45 mins to even get the meals) Admittedly my boyfriend did need a few extra minutes to look at the menu after we were told the item he wanted on the menu wasn't available, however the waiter ended up walking away into the abyss and basically forgot about us. I had to flag out waiter down for almost  everything after his initial visit. When our rigatoni bolognese and cacio e pepe finally came out they were both so salty. Sad :(I know it seems like all the rage is outside but please don't forget about this little table!
2021-03-20,5,"Is it time to go back yet?!" ...promise this will be exactly what you will say right after you leave. I went for brunch and had such a great time! The restaurant is super cute and food is perfection. For brunch I had a specialty cocktail "Spa day" (which speaks for itself) and then had the eggs with sausage and peppers. I was expecting an omelette and when the dish came out, I was happily surprised with the creation. It's a great take on a standard omelette and can't wait toTry and recreate it at home.
2021-02-12,5,Sorellina didn't disappoint! You definitely need a reservation, I came here for dinner last Friday and noticed a lot of people waiting for tables by the time we finished up around 8pm. Like most restaurants, they're asking patrons to leave after 90 minutes. I opted for the citrus spaghetti which is great if you like a lighter sauce that isn't too boring. Nice combo of lemon with Parmesan cheese. I left satisfied but not too full! Happy hour ends at 6pm. Next time I'd like to try their happy hour options or brunch!
2021-02-05,5,Delicious food & great service! Unique menu but so good & drinks are amazing. Tables are distanced
2021-01-28,2,Fairly disappointing. My fiance had wanted to try them for over a year, so we finally popped over for a bite. Service was less than mediocre and the food was .. trying to be something it isn't. We were rushed in and out when the restaurant was fairly empty and received an attitude nearly the entire time. We live three blocks away so now know why we've skipped over plenty of times. If you are gonna pay top dollar for food there's plenty of other Hoboken options!
2021-01-15,1,Had a really horrible experience here. Went for my anniversary dinner after hearing people rave about this restaurant. Going to an Italian restaurant, usually I expect a nice hot toasty fresh bread... we got cold bread with oil. We then ordered the meatballs as an appetizer, they came out cold so we sent them back. When they brought us new meatballs, they were still cold. I ordered the rigatoni bolognese and my boyfriend ordered cacio e pepe. Both dishes were cold and the portions were extremely small. We didn't want to send everything back because we were hungry at this point. The bill was almost $100 and every single thing we ordered came out cold and we actually still left hungry... I reached out to the restaurant and they made no attempt to make it right after telling them about our experience, they actually left me on read. I would never go back here, please take your money elsewhere! Much better Italian food elsewhere in Hoboken that is served hot and fresh!
2021-01-14,5,I had the best pistachio dish I have ever had here. Their food is unique and delicious and their drinks are also amazing. I will definitely be coming back to try more on their menu!
2021-01-12,4,Love the outdoor dining here - it looks so cute!! You can never go wrong with the burrata or the pesto sauce with pine nuts they had. It was a pretty atmosphere and pretty good food!
2021-01-10,5,Great food & great drinks. The pasta was absolutely amazing!! Pictured is the Cacio e Pepe and the Rigatoni Bolognese.  The hostess was very nice and sat us right away in a nice little corner outside. Very covid friendly and they have plenty of heat lamps too.
2021-01-09,5,Great drinks, great food, great vibe, and great seating during a pandemic. Exceeded expectations for the location on Washington street. I expected less on such a commercial street but they definitely earned many more visits. It's a destination which means a lot to me. The octopus was perfectly prepared as was the Squid Ink Pasta and the Steak which I usually avoid at Italian focused places, as well as in general, but our company insisted and they were right. The steak is worth a cheat day or any day. Cocktails were on point. This place deserves to be right where it is in the center of Hoboken's restaurant and retail district, but with the special honor of not being that predictable. Love it.
2021-01-06,5,I had never been to Hoboken before and Sorellina was my first stop. We came for brunch with no reservation and had no problem getting a table right away inside. We both got salads and both were really delicious. The salmon Cobb was fresh and the fish was cooked perfectly.
2020-12-23,5,Their food is amazing - delicious, fresh and innovative. And their outdoor space is so cozy, with the space heaters and parklet that blocks the wind. I know businesses have been suffering through the pandemic. This restaurant is so worthy of business. I will continue going there, and I am always hungry for more.
2020-12-22,4,I'm updating my review and good news for Paige. Aside from taking a while to greet us a get some waters the dining experience was much improved. Paige was friendly, knowledgeable and once we got rolling she paced our appetizers and dinner quite nicely. The food was great - all of us enjoyed our meals thoroughly. Such a relief and glad their rating has been restored!
2020-12-20,5,I've been to Sorellina a few times for dinner and it's always been excellent so I was really excited to try their brunch.We started with the homemade coffee cake that was moist and delicious as well as the disco tots. The disco tots were great with a good amount of cheese and a nice little dipping bowl of gravy.For brunch we had the THEC with double downed taylor ham that had a great amount of egg and a really flaky biscuit. We also had the breakfast pizza which had a good ratio of ham and egg. All of the food was great but the salad they add on the side is a little bland. I didn't enjoy it or really eat it.The holiday cocktails were also really yummy. We tried a few and each one was better than the next. My favorite would have to be the ski trip which is a rum hot chocolate that hit the spot to finish out our meal. Great brunch and will be back!
2020-12-19,1,Sat us outside with no heater and basically said deal with it. Waited 10 minutes and waiter didn't come, so left.
2020-12-19,1,Sat us at a spot outdoors without a heater in the middle of December. Asked for a different table, they denied that. Left before ordering
2020-12-18,1,I went to sorellina often since i relocated to Hoboken 3 years ago. The food was good, especially meat balls and bolognese. However, i noticed a change more recently, it has become expensive for what it is. They also seem to always be fully booked, even though it seems empty, and when i walk by 1hr later, still empty! Not sure what it is all about but i might not be the type of clientele they'd like maybe!
2020-12-16,3,Great cocktails, great vibes. It's worth going just for drinks. As for the food, everything is delicious but I'm knocking down two stars because of the limited menu and the fact that their food comes out lukewarm. Several friends have had the same experience here.  It's a shame that that's the reputation they're creating for themselves as the food has great flavor.
2020-12-15,3,Really small portions, have had better tasting food, overpriced. Meatballs not hot or tasty and charcuterie was very underwhelming. Cute Xmas decor
2020-12-14,5,A MUST VISIT SPOT IF YOU WANT DELICIOUS FOOD AND A GOOD ATMOSPHERE! Stopped by Sorellina for date night. I was surely not disappointed. The hostess was so welcoming and seated me and my boyfriend quickly and later moved us to the really nice corner booths when the table was empty. I felt safe eating there because they are taking every precaution by wearing masks, gloves, and enforcing social distancing by seating everyone apart. My waiter Kyle was extremely nice. We were served water and bread quickly. It was so soft and tasted fresh. He recommended us drinks the whole night because we aren't very knowledgeable in that area. It's amazing how he knew just what we liked! We liked it so much we got two rounds. My boyfriend drank the Austin Eastciders Rose Cider and Carton Boat Beer and I drank the Lavender Gin Fizz and Pom and Fig Martini. The gin fizz had an herbal-y taste with a sweet/bitter mix and the second tasted like candy but not overwhelmingly sweet! Perfect for the holidays. For our appetizers we got the Fried Calamari and Nonna's Meatballs. We enjoyed it so much I unfortunately forgot to take photos. It was interesting that the calamari had cranberry sauce at the bottom, but in a good way. The meatballs had ricotta, which I love so much, and never saw paired with meatballs. For our entrees my boyfriend got the Grilled Teres Major Steak and I got the Rigatoni Bolognese. We had to share  that too because they were both so tasty! Definitely revisiting.
2020-12-13,5,Had brunch on Saturday and it was amazing!!!! 3 words: Fried, Pork, Sandwich! Great decorations for the holidays made it all very comfortable and cozy. Highly recommend the Grinch and Max green bloody and the Holiday Spritz.
2020-11-28,1,Extremely disappointed! My friend reserved for Friday night, however when we got there they said they had no reservation under her name. She even showed her call history to the girl working at the front to prove that they spoke and she reserved for 4 at 7 pm. Then before even trying to resolve our issue, she told us to move so she can help the people that came after us. She was not accommodating at all even though it was an issue on their end. Ended up leaving the place and had to frantically search for other restaurants on a Friday night at the most busiest time. Thanks for ruining my friend's birthday.
2020-11-21,1,Very disappointed. 1. Got served 15 minutes after the table got after us, 2. Took forever to receive our drinks, 3. One of the group received incorrect order. All with absolutely no apologies. Definitely will not be coming back to this establishment. There are too many amazing restaurants in Hoboken to be coming back to such a place. It feels like a waste of time to be even writing this review.
2020-11-19,3,I have been here before but never for brunch. It is a simple menu with not many items which is usually a good thing. I went with Taylor ham egg and cheese on a biscuit. It was dry and tastes like something you would get at mcdonalds.  I mean that with all due respect. The Hot pork sandwich with the mustard slaw and pickles was the best thing we had.  The pork was cooked nicely. The seasoning on the outside is not that hot which I liked. The mustard slaw adds much needed acidity to cut fattiness of the dish. We also tried the toast trio and it was a funky combo. One had cream cheese with everything bagel. The other was an avocado toast and the final one was topped with a bland egg. Coffee cake for $7 was ok but nothing spectacular. For drinks we went with the natural wine and red wine. The one negative was the food took a while to come out.  There was nothing that stuck out about the food or service. Based on the overall experience, I probably won't be back for brunch.
2020-11-15,4,I've been wanting to try Sorellina since I got to Hoboken.  The atmosphere alone draws my attention anytime I'm near by. I love how they added heaters to the patio space to keep it going throughout the fall/winter. I finally got the chance to visit on a Friday night for happy hour and it did not disappoint! For starters the ambiance is stellar. This is a perfect date spot or to catch up with a friend. They have it decorated for every holiday and the outdoor patio is glittered with twinkling lights to make you feel like you're under the stars anytime you're there. Second, the safety protocols are top notch. Masks are worn by all, they have the QR code menus and hand sanitizer available. If you have a preferred seating plan (outside or inside) you can make a reservation to make sure you get what you want. We didn't have a reservation, but we're able to sit at the bar at that time. Capacity is limited inside. We felt very comfortable with the amount of people they allowed in and how spacious the seating was. Our space was cleaned before we were seated and we had plenty of space between us and the next pair of guests. And finally the drinks! Happy hour is Monday - Friday from 4:30-6:30. They have an assortment of cocktails, beers and wine available. We decided to sit at the bar and the bartenders were super knowledgeable about the menu and quick to attend to us. The drinks look as good as they taste! I'm definitely keeping Sorellina on my list of go to happy hour spots!
2020-11-11,4,The outdoor dining at Sorellina is adorable. They took proper precautions during Covid to ensure we had a safe and clean visit. However, even though we made a reservation the service was quite slow. It took almost 20 min just to gets drinks when we were nearly the only ones there at an early (5:15 reservation). The food was delicious, the drink menu was abundant and every cocktail I tried was great! Definitely recommend the braised lamb pasta.
2020-11-10,3,We almost cancelled our reservation due to the reviews on here but we couldn't because we were not in the cancellation window anymore. We showed up to our 730pm reservation and were seated right away. We ordered drinks which took longer than normal to make. The apps came out quick. Our meal took FOREVER. We might've waited an hour to get our main entree. I was hungry again by the time I got my meal. Not sure if maybe they're short staffed due to covid but we came on a Tuesday night! The food overall was good. Really enjoyed the cacio e Pepe! The pasta was very good. Would probably order take out next time.
2020-11-08,5,Sorellina is one of the best Italian restaurants in Hoboken. I am never disappointed when I dine here. Their pasta is fresh and delicious. I especially love their pistachio rigatoncini. I have never tasted anything like it and its quite unique. Their cocktails are also tasty!  Highly recommend.
2020-10-24,2,I like the decoration , however the food was ok and I find it really expensive. This is definitely not a $$ restaurant.
2020-10-19,2,ambiance: sat outside for brunch in their "streatery" the outdoor seating was beautiful and there are heaters (although I will say that the type of heathers they have really dont actually provide that much heat even though they look nice) service: our waiter was incredibly nice but service was painfully SLOW - maybe they are just under-staffed still due to the pandemic?cocktails: we kept it simple and had the bellini's & mimosa's which were great - all of the other cocktails sounded and looked great as well. food: we shared the housemade tots (normally served with spicy mayo) but we made them poutine style. The tots themselves tasted good however they were were served to us room temp which made the cheese very "meh" - for $16 felt like a rip off. Our main dishes were hot but i felt the piece of pork on the pork sandwich was too large and I personally just did not enjoy it (could just be me though) my guest with ordered the THEC on a biscuit which was also underwhelming, it was pretty bland and the egg reminded me of the egg that mcdonalds uses on their breakfast sandwiches - I felt it was missing some sort of sauce or aioli as well. overall, this was not a great experience. However, perhaps this was an off day - their dinner menu looks far better than brunch.
2020-10-17,1,Went here for brunch. The food was decent and the waitress was nice but the chef refuses to accommodate food allergies or dietary restrictions. Chef refuses to make changes to dishes even if allergies are concerned. Have never experienced such disregard for customers especially when it's an allergy that could literally cause illness/reaction.
2020-10-15,2,While the atmosphere and setting was amazing the service was a lot to be considered. Came and got seated straight away had to wait to order our food and when we ordered our appetizers and meal that took forever considering we were there early before the rush. Also but not a big deal but everyone around us got bread to start with but we got nothing! And I had to ask for the bill twice! Consider another option if you're in the area or have all the time in the world to wait.
2020-10-12,5,Excellent food and great staff. During this difficult time we were able to get a wonderful table outside. Service was on point and I felt very safe with everyone wearing masks. We enjoyed the experience so much I took my mom and my son back a week later!!
2020-10-02,5,Just had my Ist experience for lunch. I had the Shrimp Sandwich. Highly recommend it. Look forward to having diner here.
2020-09-26,3,Waited out coming here for a while because I never read or heard anything great but had to find out for myself. Finally went last night for the first time. I'd say 3/10 do not recommend. Should have listened to reviews.Everything was unbearably salty. Cheese plate was lackluster (I've literally never gotten and cheese plate and said "this is gross," until last night). Bean & beet dip had one flavor - salt. Cacio e Peppe should be called Mac & Cheese with short rib, all you taste is the short rib with minimal cacio e peppe. The All'amatriciana was probably the best once you got past the saltiness.In addition, Carlos, our water told us we had to order all of our food at once but the table of tweens next to us were able to order as they pleased, which was interesting. He also brought us the completely wrong bottle of wine -- it was opened, we tasted it, and said it was okay before we realized, so our bad there, but a restaurant with a "reputable" wine program really shouldn't be making errors like that, wasn't even a similar type of wine to what we ordered.Overall, probably will never return, would rather get food from a pizza place, it'll be better.COVID-wise, it was fine.
2020-09-17,2,Food was just ok. Chef was too arrogant to allow sauce on the side of the fish and I'm on a special diet so I had to get it as is and scrape off the sauce myself. My friend wanted no rice under her steak and they wouldn't accommodate again, so she just ate around it. When you spend a decent amount of money on food, it should be an enjoyable experience. I'll never eat there again.
2020-09-02,1,what an awful place, from the hostess who think they are royalty right down to the awful food. we ordered the halibut and the pistachio shrimp. the halibut was under cooked. the shrimp dish was whatever; something i could easily throw together. over all we are choosing not to dine there again. and the waiter pushed us to order everything on his first visit to our table so the only time we saw him again was when he brought us our food. then when i told him the halibut was under cooked his cooking expertise kicked in and told me that's the was it was supposed to be cooked. the manager didn't agree. just an all around awful experience.
2020-09-01,5,Celebrated my birthday yesterday with a lunch here and it was great! Food & cocktails were delicious, everything was appropriately socially distanced, and staff couldn't have been nicer. Definitely will be coming back!
2020-08-25,5,What a cute and chic place ! If you're like ambiance like me, then this is the place for you. The food and drinks were absolutely amazing. Servers were super attentive and I appreciated that !
2020-08-24,4,The place was aesthetically pleasing and I felt safe as they took all Social distance protocols. The house made pasta is to die for, had the pistachio pasta, really just so excellent. I didn't love the appetizers I had, could've done without them.
2020-08-19,4,I came here for dinner (and there was quite a wait ).  I had been here before and only tried some cheese and wine - seemed ok so I was looking forward to dining properly So, we tried the Cucumber salad , Halibut and a light pasta dish . All were very good with prompt and attentive service . Portions are on the smaller side for Italian ( not a bad thing ). In sum, Definitely another solid Italian option in Hoboken with nice views for people watching
2020-08-16,5,Saw this place several times recently (even though it's been here for 6 years) while driving on Washington and it was super cute! Decided to come out on a Sunday night with my family and it was perfect! Despite COVID, they have plenty of outdoor space and the service is awesome, the food was amazing! Didn't take any pictures of the food because we totally devoured it and we're having such a good time that I forgot. I was so pleased with this place on so many levels out of all the places my family and I have been to during COVID that we may make this a Sunday night tradition.
2020-08-16,5,I love Sorellina in just about every way you would evaluate a restaurant.  It's a nice looking place and I'm looking forward to when the interior will be allowed to open again, but they have done a great job setting up the outdoor seating too.  The food has been great every time I've been here and even though it's a little expensive, considering the quality I think it's worth it.  The staff is always friendly and they are wearing masks every time I come here during the pandemic.  Sorellina has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants.
2020-08-13,5,My wife and I got married this past Saturday. We were trying to find a place to eat after. It was a small ceremony with just our family, due to Covid.  We called numerous places who would not sit our family together or even at tables next to each other. We called Sorellina and they were able to sit us all together. Nicole was very kind, answered our emails quickly and even greeted us when we arrived.  She gave us a private table outside and even made place cards, with our names, date of wedding and a congratulations message.  The food was absolutely outstanding.  The service was the best service we have ever received.  They were SO nice and helpful throughout the whole meal. This is a place that we will always remember, and come to for the rest of our lives.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a beautiful restaurant, incredible service and absolutely delicious food. Thank you again for making our special day so amazing.
2020-08-10,3,My friend and I had lunch at Sorellina on a Friday afternoon.  We sat in their new streatery which is very cute - I love the umbrellas and pillows on the wood bench.   There was a pretty decent lunch crowd and service was very slow.    We ordered Aperol spritzer cocktails since they were on happy hour special for $8.  I tried the Hugo and my friend ordered the original one, but they brought her the lemon one instead.   For food, we ordered the calamari (to start) and I had the kale pesto pasta and my friend had the shrimp po-boy.    Unfortunately, they brought everything out at once - we asked our waiter and he said they don't do starters during lunch hour -  it would've been nice if he told us in advance.  The calamari was very good - I liked the sauce on the bottom (doesn't come with traditional dipping sauce).   The pasta was so so.  The shrimp po-boy was huge.   Overall, a mixed experience but the relaxed ambiance made up for some of it.
2020-08-09,4,This is the first place I've been for in-person dining since the start of the pandemic, and I felt safe with the procedures they had in place. There was adequate space between tables, hand sanitizer on the tables, and the staff had both gloves and masks. We had drinks and appetizers but for me the cocktails were the highlight. My fig and pom martini was delicious! We had two appetizers: burrata and bruschetta. The burrata was really good and refreshing and came with fruits that paired well. The bruschetta was good too, but small. It would have been nice to know in advance that there were only two, as we were a party of three.
2020-08-06,5,Been waiting to go here for quite a while and finally the stars aligned. We were sat at this cozy table in the corner under the umbrellas, trees and lights. The wine by the bottle selection was top notch and pretty decent price so we took advantage. The burrata and bruschetta was incredible. I had the Cacio E Pepe Conchiglie (highly recommend). All in all everything was well beyond expectations and I will 100% be coming back.
2020-08-03,5,Fantastic food and service. Great location near water but not on water. Highly recommend the pistachio pasta. Kitchen also accommodates food allergies well.
2020-08-02,2,First time at Sorellina and unfortunately was very disappointed. The service on this Saturday night was terrible. We had a waiter that took 15 minutes to first see us, barely spoke English and seemed very disinterested in taking our order. There was no manager to go around and check on the patrons. If you want drinks you must bring your phone to see the drink menu. Do not rely on the waiter to recite the drinks in his broken English. The food was tasty. We had the Buratta which was good but a Very Small portion for $14. The kale pesto Linguini and the Bolognese were good portions and tasty. Other waiters bring bread to the table quickly after you sit down. Not this waiter. I had to request it and he seemed annoyed at the request. Management should review its wait staff and weed out the ones that are not customer friendly. No going back any time soon.
2020-07-20,2,Meh it was ok. I wouldn't run back anytime soon. Food was decent and staff is very friendly but was a little upset with the small brunch menu options.
2020-07-13,5,This place is AMAZING. I went with my friend for an early walk-in dinner on a Saturday evening (didn't realize they were mostly reservation-only, woops, felt like a total jerk), but the hostess graciously accommodated us right away. We got a meat and cheese plate to start off with (our waiter was amazing in recommending what we might like, based on our preferences). Right as we were finishing up with the meat and cheese plate, we got hit with a TORRENTIAL DOWNPOUR. Our waiter and the busboys came out right away with table umbrellas to try to accommodate us in the rain. The rain was so bad, there was just no salvaging the situation. The manager came out (with an umbrella) and escorted us indoors. Although indoor dining is currently not permitted, we were just waiting for the rain to pass. Everyone was wearing masks (staff included), and absolutely everyone was practicing social distancing. We felt so comfortable and safe. Once the rain passed, the staff cleared and dried off our table, and we were off to have our actual dinner. We split the grilled halibut -- SO delicious. It came with grilled veggies and lots of capers in a tomato sauce. Just amazing. We were also given a round on the house, which we really appreciated. Honestly, despite the rain, such an overall pleasant dining experience. Highly recommend
2020-04-23,4,Great brunch! They occasionally do a boozy brunch that's unlimited. We got great Bellinis and mimosas. The service was great and the environment is pretty. I have been here for dinner and I thought it was overpriced but my friend said happy hour is nice here so I'm looking forward to trying that out. When this opens check it out for Sunday boozy brunch *enjoy*
2020-03-06,4,I think this spot is great for grabbing drinks and a few appetizers but nothing more than that. They put a different twist on a classic Italian cuisine which is sometimes hit or miss. However, I will always come back here for a spritz, their meatballs and the homemade ricotta toasts! Their happy hour is always great, too.
2020-02-17,5,The food is great and always a fun and lively atmosphere. I've really enjoyed everything I've ordered and have brought family and friends repeatedly. Although not a pasta dish (which are homemade and amazing), the crispy chicken entree is delicious, which I order every time.
2020-01-31,4,Sorellina offers new school Italian wine bar feeling in a town dominated by the white table cloth/red sauce offerings. Local vegetables sourced for any dish make for fresh & flavorful fare. Risky to rrecommend anything given tHe menu changes, but I really enjoyed the Burrata Bruschetta with pomegranates and walnuts & the Orzo Arancini.
2020-01-17,5,I continue to frequent this restaurant and it is so cute around the holidays with really pretty decorations. The last time I went I had the mushroom bucatini and it was unbelievable! I will get that every time now, it was seriously one of the most delicious pasta dishes I've ever had!
2020-01-16,5,$14 Flight night on Wednesday is the best! Highly recommend t for Wednesday flight night and small plates. We had the ricotta bruschetta to start and I had the cauliflower chitarra for entree, both were perfectly cooked and delicious! The serving size of the pasta was larger than I expected for a small plate style restaurant. The vibe inside is so cozy and beautifully decorated for the holidays still.
2020-01-02,4,My boyfriend and I stopped in for a drink and light food. He ordered a glass of wine and I ordered the fig and Pom martini. My drink was SO GOOD! It was so different than anything I've had before, I really loved it. We also ordered the Burrata which was delicious. Bartender was great, very attentive. So although I can't really speak for a dinner experience, my experience was really good!
2019-12-30,2,We live in the neighborhood and have been here once before for happy hour and ordered a few apps. Our first experience with the food was fine so we decided to come back for dinner. We ordered nonna's meatballs which were hard and had a sweet sauce to them and tasted very salty. The ricotta bruschetta was just fine but also very salty. We ordered the rice balls which were very salty as well. Lastly, the ceaser salad which, again, was very very salty and tasted extremely fishy. Not impressed with this place and will not be returning back.
2019-12-25,5,Such a cute and homey restaurant in Hoboken! We sat by the bar and got some appetizers and wine. The food was just delightful! The charcuterie board is a great was the start the night off! You get to choose the cheeses and meats to go on it. The meatballs were just ok. I wouldn't get them again probably. Their seasonal ravioli in pesto sauce were just amazing! Couldn't get enough of them! The service was great and waiters and bartender were very sweet and attentive. Will definitely be coming back here to try more things on the menu! Sorry for lack of pictures! The food was so great we got caught up in eating and didn't take pictures of everything.
2019-12-22,4,I've been here for both brunch and dinner. This spot is a better dinner spot for sure. Brunch items are somewhat limited in choices. If you're coming for dinner, I'd recommend the turkey bolognese and bruschetta. For brunch, the toast trio is a great plate to share. You get three seperate toasts - one with  a avocado smash, fried egg and pancetta. All three were delicious. The meat board is also very good. We did the 3 for $18 and got the prosciutto, chorizo and mushroom one. The THEC, however, is just okay. It's just a cheese omelette with four slices of ham served on a huge flatbread. There wasn't anything special about it. Of all the Italian restaurants in Hoboken, this is definitely one of the better spots to go if you're looking for some yummy pasta. Highly recommend for dinner!
2019-12-19,5,I have zero bad things to say about this place. Makes reservations as it's small. It's so cozy and cute. I could come here every week. The holiday decor is adorable. And overall the atmosphere of this restaurant is top notch. The food is 12/10. I had ordered the pistachio pasta... I WAS IN HEAVEN. The bacon was amazing. The shrimp was phenomenal. The pasta and pistachios were literally plate licking worthy. I'd come back just to get that same dish again - hopefully they don't decide to remove it off the menu in the future. Safe to say. I recommend this place!
2019-12-15,4,Came here early on a Saturday evening and was informed there would be a wait for my table. We were instructed to get a drink at the bar and wait there til the table was ready; my only complaint is that it was hard to get the bartender'a attention and both had their backs to the customers most of the time and didn't even acknowledge new guests. We had to flag down a bar back to give us a drink list. Shortly after we were seated, the table service was much better. Started off with the blood orange calamari and winter salad, both were very good; personally loved the calamari. For my main course I had the cacio e pepe which also had pork ragu, it was not like the traditional Roman dish- it was much richer in flavor and consistency. Sorellina has a great Italian menu filled with pastas wines and cheeses and the decor was very decadent for the holiday season.
2019-12-13,1,I went last winter and was unimpressed, but I wanted to give it a fair shot, so I tried it again.  The wine is poured in half serving sizes.  The waiters seem bothered to help in any way.  They have a separate bar menu from sitting at tables and will absolutely not allow anyone seated at a table to order an appetizer or drink from the bar menu.  When asked to remove a cheese that I am allergic to from an appetizer, the waiter gave an abrupt "no, we can't do that" and seemed ready to walk away before letting me decide what to order since they couldn't accommodate my food allergy.  It is not worth the headache for the price, quality or service provided.
2019-11-13,3,The food is good, but for all the hype and the price that was on the higher-end, it wasn't worth it.  We had the bruschetta to start with, which was alright - nothing to rave about. We ordered the chicken - which was great - and the Rigatoni Bolognese, which was nice but a bit on the saltier side; the pasta was way overcooked so was a little hard and dried out. Full points for the service though - both the hostess and the server were very nice and attentive. Great if you want to get a drink at the bar, but all-in-all, I had expected more.
2019-11-12,5,Beautiful spot located on Washington Street. Excellent wine options. Seasonal menus that stays up to date with trends and flavors. Great for date night, girl's night, or small group dinner. They offer brunch on Sundays.
2019-11-10,5,Delicious! The ambiance is great and food is even better. I made a reservation and had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated but they gave my friend and I a glass of Prosecco on the house. That always makes me happy!
2019-10-28,5,If you are looking to book an event look no further! We threw our engagement party at Sorellina and it was a true pleasure to work with Nicole and the whole team. Nicole was very hands on (even after my constant e-mails lol) and helped to work with us to set up everything from drinks, food, decor, logistics etc. The night of our event went so smoothly and we had tons of positive feedback from our friends about the great food and service!
2019-10-17,5,Everything about Sorellina was great, from the food to the service to the ambiance. Everything on the menu looks delicious and we definitely ordered with our eyes because we had quite a lot of food arrive at our table and had to remind ourselves that we had entries coming. To start we had the butter brushed pretzels and whipped ricotta di buffalo - would highly recommend both. The pretzels were especially good, served soft, warm, and fluffy. For entrees we go the vegetarian ricotta cavatelli and the mushroom bucatini. The cavatelli was good but the bucatini was out of this world. We were thinking about it for days afterwards. Our server was wonderful - highly knowledgeable on the menu and wine list as well as speedy and accommodating. Unfortunately I at first ordered the cavatelli without specifying I wanted the vegetarian version and it wasn't until I got my meal that I had realized, but he was quickly on top of it and had the kitchen immediately prepare another one. Can't wait to go back!
2019-10-17,5,I hosted a business dinner for 12 at Sorellina and had a great experience. The event planner worked closely with the chef and owner to set up a menu that accommodated everyone's dietary needs, including a vegan. The food was delicious and our server, Kyle, was great. The space was comfortable and the set menu allowed us to switch seats and mingle between courses.
2019-10-09,4,One of the few welcoming places for Celiac's to enjoy a plate of pasta along with some fantastic wine and drink pairings. I enjoy sitting outside in the summer, enjoying the view and filling my belly. I really also loved the salad I had as well with butter lettuce. Delightfully pleasant experience.
2019-09-29,5,Only Wine Bar in Hoboken that I love. Amazing cocktails and great deals for Tuesday night. Tuesdays is Happy hour all night and everything is half price. Food,Drinks,and Decor are really nice!
2019-09-28,3,So coming here was unexpected. We only decided to come here cause we were near by and I was craving for some pasta. However, I noticed the price was outrageous and when we ordered our appetizers which is the meatballs and salad, we didn't really enjoy them much. The meatballs were very salty and the salad was bitter, the Napoli salad. My partner ordered the Ragatoni bolognese and he didn't reallly like it much. I would say the best thing we enjoyed was the complimentary bread and Arancini. I would definitely just go there and have a glass of wine and order a couple of the anti pastas appetizers or try the cheese/salami's.
2019-09-26,5,One of my favorite spots in Hoboken. Good selection of wine and small plates. The homemade pastas are unique and delicious. For appetizers, you must try the blood orange calamari. Love how the menu rotates frequently allowing you to try something new each time.
2019-09-24,5,This is my favorite wine bar in Hoboken! I always get the turkey bolognese pasta, it is phenomenal. Their wine selection is really good too. Service is always great and the ambiance and decor in the restaurant are beautiful. I can't wait to come back for the all night happy hour on Tuesdays!
2019-09-08,2,Slow Sunday afternoon and we sat at the bar for a couple apps and a bottle of wine.  Bar service uncooperative and inattentive for no reason.  Wouldn't substitute marinara for sweet orange sauce on the side of calamari.   Was arrogant about providing bottle wine list.As a neighborhood place, they need to figure out that local regulars are their business and behave like they care.
2019-09-05,2,Very disappointed with this restaurant. Came here for my sisters birthday dinner back at the end of May and EVERYTHING we received was sooooo salty. I am a LOVER of salt, I add it to everything, and I could not eat my dish. We got 3-4 pasta dishes, steak, chicken, etc. and every single meal was just not eatable. When I let the waitress know, the manager took off 1 appetizer. Honestly, wasn't enough. Birthday dinner ruined.
2019-09-04,5,Glorious pasta, eclectic view of modern italian world in food. the effort, the hard work and dedication reflect the persona behind the scene. as well as the team. Sorellina went through some minor cosmetic changes, and the refreshing lab at te Bar, the increase of food flare, flushed by a simply reasonably priced wine menu, takes you the next level of quality. the service has improved drastically, the atmosphere is just simple exquisite, and the "Aperol Spritz" mid-day call for $6 is the greatest dealing this small town of new comers. I really experienced a great approach to service and home sense of place. I highly recommend the restaurant.
2019-08-31,1,I'm going to spare the details of horrible guest service and lackluster "Italian" cuisine. My entire experience was miserable to say the least. The food was absolutely horrendous on all account.  Calamari looked as if it had been sitting out, Cavatelli was hard as a brick! However, the Bianco Negroni was delicious. I'll never set foot back in this shack. P.S. get new chef(s).
2019-08-28,2,I came here for dinner the other night and admittedly left disappointed. While I enjoyed both my appetizer and entree, my friends meals were far less than satisfactory and the service was extremely slow (not at the fault of our waitress, I believe she was forced to cover far too many tables alone). I started with the calamari which came in a light, refreshing and sweet orange-based dressing, it was tasty and crunchy.  I finished with the Bolognese (one of my favorite dishes) and it too was nicely flavored with three different meats in the sauce and complementing spices.  Unfortunately, my friends meals were not as great. One friend ordered a mixed greens salad with fig and prosciutto that was too salty for her liking.  Also, her entree (the roasted chicken with broccoli and vegetables) came out with a sauce underneath that was way to salty to even enjoy (I gave it a taste and couldn't believe it)!  As a result, she ended up only eating a portion of the chicken and very few of the vegetables. Another friend ordered the meatballs to start which I would describe as par for the course, you'll enjoy them but you likely won't rant and rave all night. His cacio e pepe was also quite salty although it was tough to tell if it was due to the meat/pork that comes in the dish or simply being over salted. Besides the salt, the flavors of his dish were quite nice. The last dish was the pasta with shrimp, pistachio and bacon which was pretty decent but very heavy with the cream based sauce. The restaurant was crowded and the acoustics aren't great for conversation. Not to mention, our waitress was unfortunately overwhelmed with too many tables and the timing on food and drinks was far longer than it should be. Overall, I won't be going back as these are plenty of other Italian options in Hoboken.
2019-08-24,2,Came here on a Tuesday after hearing about their all night happy hour. Stopped by mainly for drinks on a nice evening so we were able to sit outside. Service was pleasant at first but then completely forgot about us after the first drink (it was not busy at all). We had to flag down multiple wait staff and the wait for the second drink itself also took way too long. Maybe I'd come back for another shot but it was definitely a less than stellar first experience.
2019-08-20,5,What can I say, I'm very confused with the overall low rating to this place, but I've been here 4x and every time I come I've had a lovely experience.  The ambiance is great, and very festive during the holidays.  The food was good, as described on the menu and they have a good selection of wine.  I would recommend for a cute date spot.
2019-08-13,4,Sorellina is now one of those spots that I go to when I want a good piece of meat. The first time I came here with my partner I had the steak with carrot mash and fried ravioli (which was more like a fried pierogi) but my goodness, it was DELICIOUS. We had basilica cocktails (made with Tito's vodka and super refreshing) and blood orange calamari! I have somewhat of a high standard for calamari, comparing it to the calamari dishes I've had in Spain, Sorellina calamari is LEGIT. Not rubbery, cooked to the perfect shade of golden and smooth as can be. I love the presentation of it. I'd give Sorellina 5 stars but the second time around I had cavatelli with snap peas  and  it was overly salty and I didn't thoroughly enjoy it. Think I would've been better off getting the steak because my mother got it the second time and it was spot on. Think that dish is the best bet!
2019-08-08,4,Sorellina was a warm welcome after the original place we were looking for was not at the address it was listed at. We were sat immediately and offered water and drinks. The atmosphere and decor were nice and made us feel at home. The server was attentive, but not overbearing. Bread and a small, complimentary bite to eat arrived shortly after our drinks and was delightful. The Caesar salads arrived shortly after and were quite tasty. Made with bib lettuce instead of romaine, the salad was fresh, salty and paired perfectly with my Peroni. The restaurant began to fill and we waited a little bit for the pasta, but it was well worth it. I chose the Cacio e Pepe Conchiglie, which consisted of milk braised pork and black pepper pasta. It was fantastic and the pork was perfectly flavored and cooked as was the pasta. Would highly recommend stopping in if you're in Hoboken and want some solid Italian food.
2019-08-03,2,I never write reviews and I never complain about service or the food, but this place was such a disappointment after months of meaning to try it I felt like this was necessary. It started off by someone bringing us water when we sat down and then we ended up waiting for an additional 10-15 minutes for a waiter to even come to the table. I actually started timing it because it was almost comical. I felt like maybe I should be proactive, but this place isn't cheap so I expected some sort of decent service. It wasn't like they were slammed, this is a summer night in Hoboken. After the long wait, my girlfriend finally made eye contact with a waiter who asked us if we were ready to order. Unfortunately, yes I was ready to order. I also could have recited the menu to him since I had looked it over a dozen times. We ordered drinks, an appetizer and our entrees all at once, because as I've mentioned this was the first time someone had come over. Our drinks and the appetizer came out without a problem. Then the entrees arrived. My ~$26 (4) baby scallops (not listed this way on the menu) and her ~$26 half a chicken. The difference in the amount of food was, again, comical. These scallops were the size of quarters. I was done eating before the waiter came over (about 2-4 minutes after the food came out) to ask how everything was. I get it. I know that it's not going to be similar portions, but this just compiled on the entire experience. With all that said, the food itself, very good with the exception of the portion difference and the miniature scallops. The service and overall experience of going to Sorellina, well below sub-par.
2019-07-27,5,Have eaten here twice and both times spot on.  Super good pasta and everything is cooked perfect.    Staff is attentive and well trained. Inside is got that cool hoboken vibe.  OK I miss Helmer's but it replacement is well worth the visit.  Price on drinks and cocktails is typical for the area.  Lots of interesting dishes if you want to go off the beaten track.
2019-07-26,5,This is not your typical boring Italian restaurant! Fresh seasonal foods mixed with creative ways of prepping and seasoning transform this place to a fine dining experience. Everything we had was amazing and the wines were incredible too!! Must try their sparkling white wine. So much better than your typical Prosecco!
2019-07-20,4,A nice spot for happy hour. I usually come here and grab a glass of wine or two before going somewhere else. Bartender was very friendly. I don't have much to say about their food, but wine is their selling point.
2019-07-12,3,This review is only based on the drinks and appetizers/antipasta. We went, sat outside and enjoyed some really good cocktails - we've been here before for some wine which was also delightful. Anyway, the jalapenÃÉo smash was awesome but I love spicy so it had my name all over it.Service was great, super nice and very attentive and huge smiles the whole time! Where they fell short was the food. We had some salami, that was great and the pan seared snap peas, also satisfying and very enjoyable. The meatballs, on the other hand, were so disappointing. We get meatballs everywhere we go, well every "Italian restaurant" mainly because we love them but also to see if anyone gets close to our grandmother's meatballs. Sadly, these were so far away from what you'd expect "Nona's meatballs" to be. They were over salted and the sauce was super sweet, such a bummer.Cute place for drinks and a small bite but the food fell short for us, unfortunately.
2019-07-05,5,My go to place at least once per week. The service and food is very special and Gabi the owner really cares. She is changing the feel of Hoboken from bar restaurant to elegant Italian food restaurant that is edgy and reasonable in price. Where have you been all my life!!
2019-06-20,2,All the food was very salty. The only good thing was the ricotta bruschetta. Not coming back.
2019-06-18,4,I've been meaning to try this place after seeing so many yummy photos of their food on Instagram, so it was a no brainer that I would treat my boyfriend for dinner as a way of celebrating a year together. I placed a reservation online and gave a note indicating our occasion.The restaurant itself is pretty, cosmopolitan, and leans into being an Italian joint that's a little more unique than the regular red sauce fare you can get in most Hoboken Italian joints. We were seated in the back, and given food and wine menus. After all, this IS a wine bar. We ended up deciding on wine based on samples that the waitstaff offered us. My boyfriend went with a smoky red, and I went with a nicely-bodied Nebbiolo.As for food, the waitstaff added a nice touch by giving us free samples of arancini balls for an amuse bouche, along with free bread (choice of foccaccia, wheat, and white). The arancini were hot and cheesy, with a nice little crunch that got us excited for the meal ahead. We ordered mushroom and ricotta bruschetta with their cacio e pepe conchiglie (HIGHLY recommended by our waiter) and their pollo alla griglia. The bruschetta was a crazy mix of textures and flavors, with soft light bread supporting the mushrooms (a mix of different mushroom blends, all full of umami flavor) and the creamy ricotta with its natural sweetness. I loved every bite. I was also really impressed with the cacio e pepe and both my boyfriend and I agreed that it was the better entree between it and the chicken. Newsflash: if you're expecting just linguini, parm, and pepper, this is not the place. First off, the pasta is shaped conchiglie style (i.e. think shells). Second, it comes with milk-braised pork. If anything, I think this take on the dish is better than the original; you can really taste the creamy parm and the kick of the pepper, and the pork just adds a little extra oomph. In contrast, the chicken, while not at all a bad dish, pales in comparison to the pasta. It was a little on the salty side, but was cooked and seasoned enough to be a juicy-enough piece of poultry. As for veggies, the cucumber, broccoli rabe, and fried spring onions were all tasty, but I would've preferred more broccoli rabe and less cucumber. Still, not a bad dish.Lastly, the service itself was solid, and I really appreciated how willing the waitstaff was to provide recommendations for every step of the meal.Overall, I'd give this 4.5 stars!
2019-06-01,3,My husband and I only had drinks and apps during happy hours as we had a couple of hours to kill, decided on Sorellina as we were passing by since they had outdoor seatings and it was beautiful weather out.  Happy hour wine selection was good, mostly Italian wine.  We ordered the lamb meatballs and it was very tender and yummy.  We also ordered the shishito peppers and prosciutto mozzarella on flatbread, sadly it was not so great.  Both were pretty tasteless.  :-(
2019-05-31,4,This place was on my list for a long time and I was super stoked to finally go and enjoy every last bite. We sat at the bar and enjoyed some deliciously suggested wine (Malbec) and IPAs. The food looked a little small portion wise, but it ended up being perfect for a non-ravenous people who were still hungry. I had the bolognese and the and had their seafood medley pasta. They change their menu seasonally and their staff are super knowledgeable. The place is a little smaller than expected, but good for intimate party sizes. It does get a little loud, and our spot at the bar was good for a less packed night.
2019-05-21,5,I love eating here. Such a classy place in Hoboken for a night out. They have top quality food with seasonal menu selections to choose from on the menu that can vary at different times of the year. Definitely the kind place where one can enjoy a cocktail and pasta dish for example not to mention starting with great bread for the table and some appetizers. There is room for groups to be seated though it is a nice environment for a date night meal. The service is excellent. The atmosphere is trendy. Also a bar area that you can sit by if that us a preference. I have enjoyed everything I have tried there so far but will need to come back soon to try everything! Always leave here full and happyRecommend that you make reservations if you can do so in advance.
2019-05-20,2,Service is so slow. Food was very salty. Salad had too much dressing. Couldn't even finish it. Flavors were to overpowering. Meatballs weren't even hot they were served cold. Meatballs had no flavor.
2019-05-19,4,We had a great meal last night at Sorellina's that was only made better by the amazing service. Kyle was our server, he made great recommendations and provided exemplary service.  We started with the fried calamari that was accompanied by a blood orange sauce. The sauce was a delicious compliment to the squid. Then we had some charcuterie, prosciutto & manchego with the mixed olives. That with the fresh bread was perfect.  For the mains we had the Saffron Bucatini and Ricotta Cavatelli. We finished with the ricotta cheesecake. The dessert was so amazing that we even took home the little piece that was left. We were too stuffed to finish it, but couldn't leave it behind!   We're not in Hoboken often, but when we go back we'll definitely come back and ask for Kyle.
2019-05-17,5,We were here visiting our daughter and had an absolutely fabulous dinner here! The restaurant is attractive and cozy, the staff attentive and friendly, and our food was wonderful! We started with the mushroom bruschetta which we all enjoyed. For entrees I had the rigatoni bolognese, others in our party had the seafood Gigli and ricotta cavatelli. All the dishes were delicious! We shared a magnum bottle of the Sorellina Montepulciano which we greatly enjoyed. We love how this restaurant is a part of the local community, on a street corner with outside seating in a nice neighborhood. We highly recommend and will return next time we visit!
2019-05-16,4,I've been wanting to come here for some time. They just released froseÃÅ, it wasn't good at all not pink enough but the cacio e Pepe was delicious
2019-05-12,5,I had an amazing time here for mothers day, my server was carlos he made sure we had everything we needed the service was impeccable and prompt. The plates here were not like a typical Italian plates; they had very unique recipes but all we tried was really good. Highly recommend also an extensive choices of wine including lambrusco. Did not get the chance to try the desserts but had some aperitifs after dinner.
2019-05-09,5,Love Sorellina! Favorite wine bar in Hoboken. The service, food and drinks are always awesome and the vibe never disappoints. Matt (the main bartender) is always super helpful and nice, which makes for an exceptional experience. Highly recommend!
2019-05-05,5,I had an excellent dinner here; sweet & sour calamari was fantastic, the cavetelli sublime and the steak perfectly prepared. Our server Kyle was super attentive and very knowledgeable the menu. Thank you Kyle!
2019-04-30,5,Greta place.  Happy hour meat ball sub was awesome. The Guanciale Bruschetta was also really good.
2019-04-30,2,Recently revisited and unfortunately disappointed! We sat at the bar and it wasn't that busy. The bartender was actually very rude and inattentive. I ordered a lambrusco and my boyfriend ordered a Kane. We had to ask for the beer three times. He was very distracted. We ordered the fried calamari and the grilled tores major steak. It took over 20 minutes for the cold fried calamari to be served. We also waited long for out medium rare steak dish which also came out cold. the carrots were delicious. The one fried potato ravioli we got with it was good! Wish there was more than one; that's not really a side that's a bite. It's not the kitchens fault both our dishes were cold. It's the server. He didn't check on us either to see if we liked any of it. Really such a shame! We will likely not return here now due to the bad service. The food and flavors were great and I don't think the prices are too bad if only the service was better.
2019-04-28,2,Who deep fries their Meatball and has the audacity to call it Nonna's meatball?!!  The only reason you deep fry a meat ball is to hide the taste of the low grade meat. So you think you're eating something relatively healthy but you're not.. it's literally loaded with an additional 30+ grams of SATURATED FAT and if you're prone to acid reflux/heartburn well good luck to you as well! No grandmother of Italian descent deep fries their meatball. I'm also sure if they told people the meatball was deep fried they would STOP ORDERING IT! But I'm sure it tastes really, really good! Our server who never greeted us or introduced himself slyly came over, poured us tap water and said "are you ready to order?" I know we're not in Manhattan but jeez, hospitality is still the same and at the very least you're setting the environment for the evening. I'll wait until Augustino's is open (unfortunately they're closed sundays) for my traditional, tasty and hospitable Italian fix.I do have to admit I had a brain fart and ordered the Arancini which I forgot (and sent back) was fried.. that was on me guys acknowledged and accepted.
2019-04-13,2,So I went here thinking it was a cute restaurant. Got deconstructed lamb lasagna and got food poisoning. The waiter was nice but Stay away
2019-04-01,5,My new fave place for Friday night happy hour! They serve an awesome sparkling white from Abruzzi that's to die for! I haven't had dinner yet, but their small bites such as rice balls are DELISH...the calamari is the BEST also...bartenders are friendly & attentive, and the bar seats have BACKS (for us ol' folks)...Glad to have stopped into this place, I wish them all the best!
2019-03-31,2,service is just so bad. after 15 minutes of zero acknowledgement by staff after being seated, we complained to host and finally got water glasses filled and drink orders taken. food isn't bad but nothing special to overcome service.  not the first time having mediocre service here either.
2019-03-30,3,Not impressed. Service left a lot to be desired - took 5+ minutes to come to the table after we were sat, negligent bussing (aka no bussing), had to constantly ask for another round of drinks and more water. Food was ok. Meatballs were bizarre; they had (and tasted only of) lemon zest yet that wasn't listed on the menu. To be completely fair the rigatoni bolognese was absolutely delicious but branzino with 3-bean salad was eh. If I come back I'm ordering the rigatoni. Can't go wrong with that deliciousness.
2019-03-17,5,Sorellina is my boyfriend and my favorite restaurant in Hoboken, hands down. We fell in love with this spot about a year ago, and find that the food is so authentic and is absolutely delicious every single time. The pasta menu keeps current and filters in new dishes once every season, which I love because I can order something new once in awhile. :) I always suggest Sorellina as a great date spot considering the atmosphere and ambiance is cozy yet chic and sophisticated, but it's truly a great spot for anyone. I always recommend getting the pasta since it's absolutely delicious and homemade. For apps, the meat and cheese board is always safe and tasty, but the meatballs and mussels are absolutely dynamite! And of course, we always get cocktails which are the perfect touch to round out the meal. It's a little pricey like everywhere in Hoboken, but I would recommend it to anyone if you don't mind spending the money!
2019-03-16,5,Awesome food, great service and fair prices. Chicken and steak dishes were very well prepared. Calamari was also very tasty with an unique sauce. Will come back!
2019-03-16,2,Less than impressed. The food was average tasting and the portions were tiny. The bartenders spent more time chatting to each other about basketball games and drink competitions than taking care of their customers. The food was slow to come out and paying took entirely too long. Unless I'm desperate, I won't return. There are many other Italian restaurants that won't treat you like an expensive inconvenience.
2019-03-03,3,Pastas were goodNapoli salad was basic -  nothing special Olives were just average tooWine glasses had dust in them even after sending it back twice. Feedback was the lint from the towel which they use to polish leaves residue which is the first time we heard something like this Entrees took long to come out Average on best
2019-03-01,3,I feel like sorellina tries really hard, but just misses the mark every time I come here. I've been here a few times for drinks, but never for food until tonight.Their wine list has always been super confusing and missing basic wine types that most people are familiar with. Can a girl just get a Sauvignon Blanc? I always end up with some wine that is just OK.For food, we started with the Caesar salad. We found the dressing overly fishy, and then found that the greens beneath the top were completely bone dry. Took 15 minutes to flag our waiter down for more dressing, which he forgot to bring multiple times. My husband had the olives, and said that the green ones were OK.For our mains, we stuck to pasta. The rigatoni bolognese and the cacio e Pepe. The rigatoni was actually really good and our fav thing of the evening. The cacio was pretty meh - if you do order this you must go in with the knowledge that this is nothing like a cacio e Pepe, even the sauce doesn't taste like it. I'm not sure why this dish is even named cacio e Pepe.Overall, we were pretty unhappy with the service since it was painfully slow, but the worst part is we asked the waiter to wrap our leftovers up and get the check, but he sandwiched the plates together as I guess he didn't hear us so we left without a whole meals worth of leftovers.  We didn't want to make a stink about it, but I'm still pretty annoyed considering the cost of the meal.Once you've had augustinos, it pretty much spoils all other Italian food. I don't think sorellina will ever be at their level!
2019-02-27,3,We made reservations for 815 on a Saturday night and were seated pretty promptly. They were turning people away so be sure to call ahead. It's very cool inside, they have a long bar with plenty of seating, standing tables, a high top and regular tables. We got a cozy spot at the high top in the window. Appetizers were a decent size. Ricotta bruschetta was $4 and served 3 of us. They also came around with a tray of bread to pick from and complimentary toasts. We really liked our waiter, he took the time to explain the wines, get samples for us and answer all of our questions. We settled on a bottle of red. The dinner menu is limited but changes seasonally I believe. Most dishes were pork based. The meatballs were a mix of meats and had a hint of lemon. They were a bit firm for my liking but had an interesting taste. Next we had the lasagna which was just ribbon noodles with a pork sauce. It was just OK. The pasta was over cooked and could have used more sauce. My friend ordered the seafood pasta which looked good, but you could smell it from a mile away. We opted out of dessert but the choices looked good. Pasta dishes ranged from $17-25.
2019-02-14,4,Absolutely, had a great time here. Spacious seating and great service made my evening enjoyable. The food was on the smaller side, but tasty.  My one negative comment is the fact bread was scarce. Had to keep asking for it. Overall nice date night place.
2019-02-10,1,Unsanitary place. Went in just to get a drink, seen a roach crossing on the floor. Also, was refused to be serviced. Claimed my drivers license was fake lol. Never again!
2019-01-26,4,The ambiance of this place is great, and in theory, it sounded like it was going to be great. However it just never was.
2019-01-06,3,Sorellina is a great little Italian restaurant in Uptown Hoboken with great pasta dishes and an assortment of other options. Although I never leave this place hungry or wishing the food was better, I have had multiple bad experiences with the service. The waitstaff is very friendly and welcoming, however they seem to have a tough time remembering orders or to serve their customers. I went on a date here a couple months ago and me and my date sat outside on a beautiful fall night in Hoboken. The only problem? Our waiter only brought us out water, took our order and then proceeded to have us wait almost an hour for our food while occasionally coming by and letting us know it was on its way out. It took us to finally get fed up and ask for the check that he THEN brought our order out in which we had to ask that he wrap it up so we can take it home. I thought it was an isolated incident and that it might have just been the victim of a somewhat busy night. Fast forward to a couple nights ago. I went with the same date to the restaurant because we really do like the food there. We both ordered our food at the bar and enjoyed a drink while we waited. My date got her plate, I thought mine would be right out. It took 15 minutes for us to finally ask where the second plate of food was in which they responded with utter shock, clearly forgetting that I had also ordered food. I ended up getting the pasta and as always it was delicious, however I do not think we will be dining here again. It is just too frustrating to go to an establishment trying to eat and walking into the place now not knowing if we will both get our food, or if we will get it at all. I gave them 3 stars because the food really is great.
2018-12-28,3,This was my second visit after an underwhelming first. Let me start off by saying both trips were equal in that you walk in and see numerous open tables but are asked to wait 45 mins to an hour because they're being held for reservations (half which didnt show). The pros of this establishment are the wines and decor. The ambiance is very mature, classy, and what you expect out of a wine bar in Hoboken. The food looks amazing on menu but flavors are completely underwhelming. My friend and I both commented how far salt and some garlic could take both our entrees. The desserts we ordered were the apple cobbler with homemade gelator and their bourbon panna cotta. The cobbler was mostly burnt. Gelato amazing. Panna cotta was a pudding due to how much alcohol was in it so it wasn't as firm as other panna cottas I've tasted. Then the bill arrives and for two women its about $166 which was on par with what we paid last time, so pricing is up there. Needless to say we've attempted at giving this place a shot but the lackluster food will keep us from coming back.
2018-12-27,4,we tried their in house made pasta, tastes really good, with details. price is reasonable with good portion so you dont need to pack it to go/ waste food.recommended!
2018-12-25,5,The food was amazing here and there service was great too. Although Chef, come on.....those compliments from the chef could have been slightly bigger or maybe more. Definitely recommend the steak and pasta. When you tell them how you want your steak, they sure make it happen. And the pasta was just unlike any other pasta you'll have in your life. All things considered, dinner for two was not expensive at all here. So I definitely highly recommend this place
2018-12-22,4,Went there for dinner on Friday. Decor war beautiful. Service was great very friendly and attentive. Food was a mix. Meatballs had a strong lemon taste that did not work. Rigatoni bolognes and CACIO E PEPE CONCHIGLIE were delicious entrees. Highly recommend those dishes. Brussel sprouts were also really good for an app. Overall good experience, will be back.
2018-12-19,5,Had dinner with my friend at Sorellina on Friday. We couldn't fault it! We wanted to check out the Christmas decorations, as the restaurant is festively decorated. We both had bruschetta which was so much bigger a portion that we imagined - we could probably have shared one, but we managed one each! The ricotta was delicious! Then both had the veal, pork and beef bolognaise. Again it was delicious, we ate every last drop. Wine was good and the server was happy to recommend an Italian wine based on other wines we liked since we weren't too familiar with Italian wines!
2018-12-17,3,I really wanted to love this place, but it is just okay for me. The decor is so beautiful, especially around the holidays. It really is a perfect date night spot and a fantastic location right on Washington. The service and experience is really nice. My main issue is the menu - I am a huge Italian fan, but I found myself having a very hard time picking something to eat. They are missing some of the Italian staples that I love to start off with for apps. A lot of the main menu items also have some strange ingredients and it put me off a bit. Our table went with Ricotta Cavatelli, Rigatoni Bolognese and Sausage Tortellini. We started with an eggplant dip. Everything was fairly tasty, but the portions are on the smaller side. We left feeling a bit eh. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to switch up their regular Italian selections and try something new!
2018-12-10,2,Was looking forward to checking this place out after I heard about the cute holiday decor. Reservations were booked and it was a 2 hour wait but luckily snagged a sit at the bar.  The place is very cozy and the decor was beautiful.  The employees were sweet and attentive.  The downfall was the food.  We ordered all apps... meatballs, rice balls, burrata and the raviolis. The meatballs were probably the worst I have ever had, I couldn't even finish them. The rice balls were delicious but cold. The burrata was nothing out of this world and the raviolis were eh. Maybe I would need to try an entree next time but not sure I'd bother.   I would come back here for a drink but not for the food. Beautiful job with the decor though.
2018-12-08,4,The food here was really good and so was the wine list. The restaurant was decorated beautifully and tastefully for Christmas. But I have to take away one star for the so so service and how COLD it was. Every time the door opened the blast of the cold weather made the night uncomfortable. They need to put a curtain or something around the door. As much as I liked the place I'm not going back until it's warm outside
2018-12-07,2,Really wanted to like this place but when the check came, we were over charged for our bottle of wine. The advertised price on signage was way less than what they charged us and they refused to honor the sign they had. The only reason I ordered that specific bottle of wine is because it was said to be on special. To the management - I would be careful with how you advertise items available at your restaurant. It then falls back on your servers and hostess to explain why the signage is incorrect.
2018-12-03,2,I went there over the weekend after seeing how nicely decorated it was for Christmas...big mistake.  The place is small therefore it is loud, also the food was overpriced.  20 dollars for 7 or 8  tortellini is unacceptable.  The apps were small, we left hungry, and got pizza down the street before going home.  Only reason I am giving two stars is for the decor.
2018-12-02,3,My husband and I love Sorellina for the food and beautiful atmosphere. It is one of our favorite places in Hoboken. We especially love sitting at the bar. However, I have to say recently we have been disappointed in the service. This Sunday we arrived at 8:45 hoping to get a quick bite and a glass of wine. When we arrived, we were told that the kitchen was closing, but we could sit at the bar. We were not greeted warmly, but love the food and noticed people were still sitting at the bar, so we decided to stay. Upon going to the bar, the bartender spoke with another waiter and said, "Did you tell them we close in ten minutes?" She did not greet us or make us feel welcome. This has happened to us a few times. I was a waiter for years and understand that it can be difficult to take customers close to closing. Had the host told us that the kitchen was closing and Sunday hours were shorter, but he hoped we would come back, we would have left happily. However, this was not the case. If you are going to seat us later, please don't make us feel unwelcome. We ended up leaving to go to a restaurant around the corner that was much more inviting. I love Sorellina and they have incredible food, however, they need to either be respectfully upfront about when the kitchen is closing, or invite customers in despite the later hour and make them feel welcome.
2018-12-02,5,Sooo cute in here ! Amazing christmas decorations inside AND out...the bartender was super friendly and accommodating.i had the aperol spritz and some home made man house focaccia to start yummmm! then for my entree i had the cavatelli chaulkfull of meat and spinach with delicious ricotta in every bite ! well worth the money in my opinion will definitely return !
2018-12-01,5,Came here for dinner.  They go all out for the holidays.  The fettuccine was amazing.  The apple cobbler with gelato is totally worth the wait.
2018-11-27,5,Im glad we've found a consistent spot to eat.  Besides the table next to us who didn't understand that they weren't the only table there, we had a great anniversary meal
2018-11-20,5,I've had some great meals here. I love their tapas selections. We usually split a variety of plates. Has a classic speakeasy look. Def sensual and luscious when appropriate
2018-11-13,3,Like to BYOB?  Enjoy cute decor?  Well this Italian-American joint is perfect for date night or hanging out with friends.  Overall, Sorellina is a great place to chill, but found the food to be a mixed bag. Snagged a last minute reservation here on a Friday night.  (I highly recommend making one because everyone and their moms show up!)Their seasonal menu changes and I appreciate that ingredients are locally sourced.  While waiting for our apps/entrees, bread service came with an option of three breads.  As for the food...- Roasted cauliflower pretzels:  when the waiter described this dish, the concept sounded really cool but this was the biggest disappointment for me.  Barely tasted any cauliflower and it ended up tasting like reheated frozen pretzels that came with a side of cheese and mustard.  Kind of pricey for what it was. - Grilled branzino: Seared and served with the fish skin on top, which is strange to eat.  Just an average dish. - Spigarello rigatoncini:  The better dish.  Get their homemade pastas!  Pasta noodles are fresh, tasty and this dish was very good. Service was very attentive and friendly.  The entrees took awhile but the kitchen was very busy that night.  All in all, this place is just okay.
2018-11-07,5,Pretty damn good place deserves 4.5 giving five to help their average. The 3.5 is too low. Home made pastas top notch, service great and friendly, lively place. Good beer and wine selection. Tiramisu was ok... will go back for sure to try all their home made pastas..
2018-10-23,2,I do like this spot but three times for me is a good test. Service, where do I start... it's terrible and so sloooow and the food can be made at the Olive Garden. I don't know what the big deal is about this spot but only thing I say to do here is Tuesday all night happy hour and eat before your arrive. Then bartender is lost and I really mean it, she doesn't know how to run a bar. My cheese plate took almost 30 minutes, I actually forgot I ordered it until it showed up! They gave me one slice a bread for it, these are not things I should ask More for...I did a pasta dish, it needed salt... I did an empanada and I sent it back. I'm walking to Madison's now to get dinner but happy to have wine on the cheap before I get there.
2018-10-07,4,This is another great slightly hidden spot in Hoboken. I went here with coworkers for dinner and it was an awesome experience. The wait staff were attentive and friendly and open to giving recommendations between dishes. We ordered 3 appetizers to share among 5 people. I had the bucatini and it was a great red sauce pasta dish. The portions for the pasta were healthy and I actually couldn't finish all of mine after the appetizers. I know my coworkers (2 guys) who ordered the scallops said the dish was quite small in terms of portion. But everyone enjoyed their entrees. I like how the wine by glass menu is separated by flavor palette rather by region or type of wine. They had a great deal $12 flight tastings of wine that my coworkers enjoyed. Will definitely try to come here again. I would definitely recommend making a reservation ahead of time it's on the smaller side and it was pretty busy when we were there with inside and outside seating.
2018-09-26,4,Loved the vibe and service here. Got two paths and two appetizers and dessert. All were great would come back! Wish there were a few more pasta options
2018-09-18,1,The staff at this establishment is extremely unprofessional, including the owner GABBY. They are not family friendly whatsoever or accommodating to children (would not let me bring my stroller inside) even though it was still early and not at all packed. The food is lackluster and waitstaff is uninformed. They are against any modifications to the menu whatsoever. Many better Italian wine bards in the area to go to instead.
2018-09-16,3,This restaurant has such great potential!!!! The menu is great, the food was tasty. We came in later on a Saturday night after being at the Pier for the day. We were respectful and extremely polite with everyone we came in contact with however - the staff peoceeded to age shame us. Let me start off with the fact that we are 25-27 year olds. No some 21 year old teenie boppers. We felt slighted in service due to these judgments. We waited to be seated for about 35 mins at the bar no problem. (Even though half the restaurant was empty which I get reservations etc) We were then sat outside and the table was very cramped so we moved it to make more room and were met with a disgruntled waiter. We were just trying to make his life easier ! And we proceeded to sit for another 20 mins without an interaction with a staff member. Its like 9pm now we should be able to at least order drinks. Again, food was good. Drinks were not great and service could be improved ! Hoping next time the staff is friendlier and more accomodating.
2018-08-26,2,The staff is very friendly and we received great service. We got the tomato bruschetta as an appetizer which was really good. But I was very very disappointed in the main course. We had a Caesar salad which had too much dressing and the flank steak! The presentation for the steak was not appetizing at all. The steak seemed as if it was from  other peoples left overs. It was just thrown on to a plate and some of the steak was well done while other parts were completely raw. The vegetables on the plate were also burned! It seemed like the food you would get at a diner on the road or a college dining hall!
2018-08-08,3,Meatballs good, gem salad good but everything was too salty. Good wine selection. Would try again but don't want to risk sodium overload.
2018-06-21,5,Going to Sorellina to start our New Jersey weekend was the best decision ever! Everything about this place was 5 star. The quality of these fresh ingredient recipes made choosing our favorite impossible. After you read all the different seasonal menu items available don't worryabout choosing as portion sizes were perfect too...so order away! Wine flight night was a great way to experience some of the best Italian wines without having be in Italy. Hoboken is lucky to have this great place in its neighborhood...sure makes me wish I lived closer!
2018-06-16,1,When you sit down at a table and need to flag the hostess to send a waiter over after 20 minutes, you know this place doesn't know what it's doing. To add insult to injury, the manager was on the floor and no action was taken to ensure guests were being taken care of. It's also a Saturday night and pretttttty empty relative to the hoboken Washington scene. Won't be back but not that it matters because this place most likely won't be around for too long.
2018-05-27,2,Underwhelming and it's too bad. Went with my friend and the service was painfully slow. I was excited to see arancini on the menu, having grown up eating my family's recipe,  I was eager to have my friend try them but was so disappointed. They were so overcooked inedible.My friend had the bolognese but it had waaaaay too much wine in the sauce. I heard the squid  ink cavatelli such was just so strangely chewy. Overall not sure I'll be back for the prices...
2018-05-25,2,Arrived at 6:15pm and waited 15 minutes to be seated outside, totally fine. Ordered cocktails at the bar, they were great, bartenders know how to make a good drink. BAD NEWS, I ordered mussels and found 4, 1 inch hairs in my tomato and mussel sauce within the first 5 minutes of eating. BEYOND DISGUSTED.  I never post yelp reviews so this was seriously disgusting, 3 of which I found prior to ingesting the mussels and one I pulled out of my cheek. The assistant manager, once confronted, was upset that I was outraged by 4 HAIRS IN MY FOOD IN 5 MINUTES of EATING, but Lets be honest i didn't give a s***, because I ate someone's hair!!!!! Blonde manager handled the situation professionally, courtesy, and for that i will come back here for cocktails in the future but BUYER BEWARE, the food is basically laced in hair. So disgusted, they comped my meal but this was absolutely the most disgusting experience I've ever had in my life.
2018-05-25,4,Sorellina has a really amazing vibe--the decor is lovely and it usually has an upbeat crowd, without being too loud and overwhelming. I came here with my roommates, so we ordered a bottle of wine and two appetizers to start: the eggplant dip and the burrata. Both were a bit disappointing. They tasted good, nothing amazing, but what really caught me off guard was how small they were. Maybe if I wasn't with 3 other people, it wouldn't have been so noticeable, but I do wish we were advised to maybe order more. For my entree I ordered the mushroom ravioli, which was amazing. I'd recommend skipping the apps and going straight to the entree
2018-05-20,1,Forgot my credit card, came back to get it and was treated really rude and aggressive by what seems to be the manager. Frustrating experience, especially after spending $100+ for dinner and leaving 30% tip.We're definitely not coming back again.*update: one of the waiters outside told me to take the side entrance and ask inside for my credit card.*
2018-05-17,3,Came here for dinner with a friend tonight. The squid ink pasta dish was fantastic, but everything else was mediocre. Probably won't be coming back, unfortunately.
2018-05-17,1,I never actually returned a meal and then got a check before this incidence. But I asked if it was easy to have gnocchi without shrimp.  They said it was fine. So instead of replacing the meal with more pasta they gave me a half portion of pasta.  I made a comment and they said they would put more pasta in it.   They made me wait fifteen minutes and came back without anymore pasta and the meal was now ice cold.   I attached a picture for the "full" plate of gnocchi.  The gnocchi was inedible.  If you can't accommodate a vegetarian request simply say so vs providing terrible service/food.  Major fail!
2018-05-11,4,The chef has put together a creative menu using local products. Incredible! They also have vegan dishes.
2018-05-11,3,Mediocre at best. Over priced. The sommelier actually asked my friend if she wanted grape juice because she asked for a non dry wine. RUDE!!! We asked our waiter for a few mins to look over the menu, 30 seconds later he came back and we asked for a few more mins. He never came back! We had to flag day be another server. RUDE!!
2018-05-02,2,Last night was my first time here. The place was very busy when we arrived. We asked for a table for 4 and the hostess said it would be about 20 minutes. She took our information and we went to the bar for a glass of wine and an appetizer. Tuesday night is all night happy hour, so that was nice! About 30 minutes later we asked the hostess if our table was ready and she said it was. I was a little annoyed that we had to go to her. We sat at a table and a waiter came over right away. He gave us water and told us what was good on the menu. Then he never came back! After sitting and waiting for another 15-20 minutes or so, we had to grab another waiter to take our order since it was now 8:45 pm and we just wanted to eat our dinner and go home. The food was pretty good, but I've had much better! Overall, I don't think I would come back here again because the service was awful!
2018-04-28,3,Really fun and aesthetically pleasing atmosphere. Great wine list, and known for their negronis (though I haven't tried). The food is pricey and not altogether worth it. The appetizers are better than the entrees. The non-pasta portions are small. The ice cream sandwiches are yummy. I recommend coming here for drinks or apparently before going further.
2018-04-07,1,I don't give one stars but this place was a huge let down. It charged premium for the smallest portions I've ever seen. The atmosphere does not match the prices at all. In my opinion it's not an upscale restaurant.  We started with a wine and cheese plate. It cost an arm and leg for average at best apps. I'm so disappointed. I will not be coming back again.
2018-04-02,5,I have had two great experiences here and both reviews are way overdue.My fianceÃÅ and I came here for Valentines Day as I had been itching to try this place out. The service, food, and ambience were all fantastic. I was nervous about how crowded it might be but they stuck to the reservations and sat us right away. I was unfamiliar with the wines and asked for the one most similar to Sauvignon Blanc. I can't remember the exact name, but the waiter's suggestion was on point (as I ended up having three glasses)! We received bread with a chickpea spread compliments of the chef, which was yummy. We started with the pretzels (yummy!!). I had the squid ink pasta which I loved and my fianceÃÅe won the clean plate award with the bucatini plate. Also, somewhat random, but I absolutely loved the music selection! It was the perfect mix of 90's with current. It made for the perfect Valentines Day.I also came for happy hour with my best friend which is a great deal. We had the lamb fingers and the flatbread, which we both loved. Definitely a great date night spot or a good place to grab a few glasses of wine and a little pre-dinner treat at their Aperitivo.
2018-03-26,4,Went here for an early Friday night dinner with my wife and son.  This is the 3rd or 4th time we've been and it seems to get better every time.  High quality pasta dishes with some very interesting twists.  The black pepper pasta with milk braised pork was amazing.  Vegetarian options are limited but my wife loved her pesto gnocchi.  They made a simple pasta with butter plate for my 7 yo who later remarked, "That pasta was money".  Not a wine expert and had no idea what the Italian wines were, but our waitress was on point with a perfect recommendation.  Solidly in the conversation of best Italian food in Hoboken.
2018-03-26,5,I don't really understand the 3.5 stars here. Sorellina is probably the best restaurant in Hoboken by far.Fresh ingredients, honest traditional dishes with a twist and great staff.I have been there 5 times and after reading some of the reviews I can only confirm the bad taste of a lot of people who cannot appreciate when they are in front of great food.Keep up the good job, Sorellina!
2018-03-04,5,Have no idea why this place gets any bad reviews. I've been here 3 times now for dinner and I've been impressed every time. I've ordered three different pasta dishes each time and they have all been very delicious. They did a good job with the atmosphere as well considering the dated German place that was here before. This is a solid spot for good Italian in Hoboken with a nice atmosphere.
2018-02-05,5,Nicole helped me plan my best friend's engagement party this past weekend and everything came out fantastic! She took the liberty of arranging the balloons and mason jars I dropped off- everything looked spectacular. The food was great! Such an amazing time! She took so much care in personalizing our special event!
2018-01-28,4,I recently went here for a friend's birthday party where we had a food and wine tasting. I thought Sorellina did an excellent job with the whole experience and the food came out at a great pace. We didn't have to wait too long between courses. Highly recommend the squid ink pasta. It was my favorite and so delicious!
2018-01-23,4,Sorrelina has taken over the likes of Helmers German Bar/ Restaurant a few years ago and are still standing in Uptown Hoboken! Their decor is bomb AF. I love the teal pillows, long bar, the contrasting in different elements in the restaurant and of course - their dishes. Although they're more on the European side in terms of serving - I absolutely love every plate I order here. Note-able dishes would be the:Cavatelli & Ragu with Pacchieri Pasta.They also make Struffoli fresh in house with a healthy drizzle of honey!*Drooling* They always have specials brewing & they have a grand selection of Italian wines & Negronis. On the pricier side, this isn't an everyday spot, but a great place for date night or just to try something with a different atmosphere in town. Bravo Sorrelina, although you mean Little Sister - you still stand tall and I can dig that ;)
2018-01-14,3,Been here for drinks only a couple times and for dinner twice.   Food is good but always something a little off.  First time pasta served a bit to al Dente even for those that like it.  Second time the lamb with mushrooms had more of a mutton taste then either the fig or mushrooms.   My steak was good and nice size.  Like they split wine list by flavor profile.   Service was okay though needed to ask Twice for wine.  Wanted to sit at bar but not next to door and they would not move a party of 6 that reserved seats down two.  Considering other options this is a good choice for upscale Italian in Hoboken.   Wish they would put candles at table to add a bit of light.
2017-12-15,3,"Meh, it's fine..." That's what I'd say if you asked me what I thought of Sorellina. I really wanted to be a fan of this place, it just didn't happen and i think it's because the food is average. With that said, my wife and I really liked the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant. Also, the house wines are good and reasonably priced. Lastly, the bartender makes a damn good Negroni. We'll probably give it another shot some time and I'll boost the rating I gave them if the food improves. Fingers crossed!
2017-12-03,3,Overall, Sorellina is a bit pricey for the quality of the food and service. However, on the upper side of Hoboken, you are paying for the atmosphere as well.  I ordered the CACIO E PEPE CONCHIGLIE (milk braised pork with black pepper pasta).  The pasta was perfectly cooked and al dente and the flavors were all there. However, I found it to be way too oily and heavy after my third bite.  I ordered a negroni cocktail to help cut through the fattiness of the pasta.  Halfway through my pasta, I notice that my entire plate had about a quarter inch of olive oil that had oozed out of the pasta.  By the end of the meal, it took about 10 minutes to wave down the waiter for the check. Probably will not be back on my own volition.
2017-12-02,4,Just had dinner here with my sister. Very cute inside. The ambiance was relaxed with sophisticated. We had several appetizer dishes and the mushroom pasta along with a few glasses of wine. Everything was very good. I'm giving them a 4/5 because I must say that the food was salty all around. Our favorite was the eggplant dip and octopus dish. We can't decide what we liked best followed by the pear Gorgonzola bruschetta. Overall, good food and decent prices for the area.
2017-11-24,2,Yet another subpar meal that the staff didn't seem interested to hear feedback on tonight. After a delicious Cauliflower Arancini appetizer: unseasoned, unsalted Brussels sprouts burrata that was more like melted mozzarella w/no hint if promised truffle followed by mushroom ragu that was not fully heated and uneven portion size as between me and my husband (minecwas teeny). My daughter's chocolate gelato was gummy and inedible. She left much of it unfinished. Our waiter said sorry but really seemed to not care. Next time, we should just go to Anthony David's!
2017-10-28,2,How do I start this off. This place has SO much potential but it comes up short. I went there with my best friend for the first time last night (I live in the area and familiar with most of the wine bars). We went on a Friday night so decided to sit at the bar to avoid the wait for a table.The bartenders were great -- and we decided to share a couple of apps to begin. We decided on the meatballs, black truffle burrata, and octopus salad. To put it short and to the point -- extremely disappointing.The meatballs were bland and somewhat cold. They were hard in the middle and lacked ANY "oomph". The octopus salad maybe had a total of 1 small tentacle cut up and was served over cabbage. CABBAGE. We literally got a bowl of cabbage with a couple pieces of octopus sprinkled on top. The burrata -- WAS SERVED HOT OVER BRUSSELS SPROUTS. Lacked ANY FLAVOR and was melted on top like mozzarella instead of its usual form. After that, we decided to not order any more food because we were turned off at that point. We pride ourselves on being "foodies" and appreciating great dishes. However, we left extremely unsatisfied and still hungry. We told one of the bartenders who offered us a free round to make up for the food -- he was great. Do yourself a favor and chose Grand Vin or Bin 14.
2017-10-20,3,Great food. Absolutely terrible service.Just seems like basic restaurant management is lacking. It's unfortunate!
2017-10-15,4,Excellent service. Very nice atmosphere! I would recommend the pasta bolognese and the squash bruschetta was excellent! Definitely would come back.
2017-10-12,5,Delicious strong coctails. Yummy food! Get the gnudi and spaghetti squash bruschetta. Go for all the pastss and breads.  Not for those on a low carb diet.
2017-10-12,4,Food is incredible! I ate the steak and the rigatoni both were excellent! The steak was cooked perfectly and had tons of flavor. The rigatoni might have been the best Italian dish I have ever had. It was very flavorful and the portion size was perfect! I would definitely recommend this restaurant!
2017-10-08,5,Celebrated my birthday here with my boyfriend and a group of my college friends. My family and I were longtime fans of Helmer's, the traditional German restaurant and bar that occupied the space where Sorellina is located from 1936 when Hoboken had a large German immigrant population right up through three years ago when Helmer's finally closed its doors on New Year's Eve 2014. I was hesitant to make reservations at Sorellina (I was feeling maybe a tad guilty that in doing so, I would be betraying the memory of Helmer's and my family's connections to "old Hoboken") however, I had driven past Sorellina several times since it opened and I thought the decor evoked the same warmth and coziness that made Helmer's so lovely. The food menu is full of vegetarian-friendly appetizers and pasta dishes which was perfect for one of our party who eats vegetarian and sometimes vegan. The drink menu had an exciting array of signature and seasonal cocktails as well as an impressive wine list. I called and made a reservation for seven people. Sorellina was extremely flexible about holding the table for us despite the fact that we were running half an hour late and the restaurant was crowded. Our server did a stellar job of making recommendations for both food and drink throughout the evening. From the small plates and snacks section of the food menu, we selected the roasted eggplant dip with corn flatbread for dipping along with two different types of bruschetta (the first being the beets with feta, honey, and pecans, and the second, the spaghetti squash, pignoli, and pumpkin seed). All three of these items were excellent and the spaghetti squash bruschetta was a particular favorite with the squash and pignoli creating a nice contrast of flavors. We also enjoyed the meatballs which were veal-based as well as a cheese and salumi board for which we selected three items - I believe the two cheeses that we chose were the pecorino and the Camembert but I can't remember for certain. For the meat, our server recommended the speck, which tasted like a leaner and less salty version of prosciutto but with similar tenderness. For entreÃÅes, all of us selected pasta dishes and we were quite pleased with our choices. Two of us ordered the cacio e pepe. In a departure from the usual long pastas used in this dish such as spaghetti, Sorellina's take on it featured conchiglie (shells). The shape of the pasta allowed the sauce to adhere nicely to it and also made it easier to eat the delicious braised pork which was perfectly cooked and pulled apart easily. Two others at the table also both ordered the mushroom farfalle which was full of complex flavors that blended together seamlessly to make a great fall pasta dish. Other items on the table included the ricotta gnudi (small, round dumpling-like pasta), the kale ravioli, the flavor of which was nicely balanced by the presence of fig in the dish, and the colorful squid ink gigli amatriciana that was reminiscent of a zuppa di peace. From the drink menu, two of us ordered the autumn spritzer, a clear cocktail that include vodka and club soda as well as a few other ingredients and was served with a cinnamon stick. Our friends also ordered wine by the glass, choosing from a broad selection of both reds and whites. Dessert included uniquely flavored gelati as well as different cakes and baked goods accompanied by a long list of apeÃÅritifs, dessert cocktails, and espresso-based drinks. Our server was happy to oblige my friends' request to add a candle to my dessert so that we could sing happy birthday. The service was characterized by attentiveness and consistency from the beginning of the meal to the end. I was extremely impressed with the quality and creativity that went into our food and would highly recommend the restaurant to anyone. The menu offers great takes on some Italian favorite while finding a nice middle ground between experimentation and tradition. We will most definitely be back! Thank you, Sorellina, for a great birthday outing!
2017-10-08,2,Upon entry to the dining area we were quite pleased with the open and free flowing design accompanied with the typical wooden feel of a wine bar.  They did a nice job shielding  the kitchen from the rest of the venue (not many places pay attention to this  A++).  We looked over the menu and decided to go with the selection of salumi,  Brussel sprouts with the duck egg yoke and the meatballs.      Salumi you can't go wrong,  the meatballs were firm and packed a punch but they ran out of the Brussel sprouts!!!    How can you run out of a dish on your menu!    Their bread is baked on premise,  which was amazing!!!! But please offer more than just one slice of heaven!       For entrees we had the pork and pepper pasta, Kale raviolis,   And the farfalle with mushrooms.     I enjoyed the pepper pasta, the sauce was smooth and different which was much appreciated.    Kale ravioli was inhaled but my wife was a little disappointed with the farfalle .      Over all scale 1-10 I would give it a 5.    Service needs to be tightened up.    The ambiance was a plus and food was good but the service took the overall rating down.
2017-09-28,2,I brought my family here for dinner tonight. I've had dinner here before a few times a couple months ago. In short, the menu changed and I understand its due to the season. The menu doesn't have an incredible selection which isn't a bad thing but how do you run out of main entree items by 8pm on a Thursday night. The wait staff very slow, not attentive. The food was not great. It also took a good while to come out. I'm not sure what happened, this place was great from what I remember. They also changed the brunch menu which I had last weekend. There wasn't anything that even felt like it resembled breakfast and I get it's an Italian restaurant but very poor selection. You're probably wondering why I came back. I didn't see the dinner not being great, gave it a second shot but I'm going to say for a place that's on the more expensive side, there are better places. The food is just not good anymore. I normally don't post, but I was disappointed this was the spot I selected to bring my family from SF to.
2017-09-11,2,For an Italian restaurant and wine bar, I was not impressed. The atmosphere was very quaint and lovely. We got right in and sat before our reservation. The drinks were expensive and overly priced. I wish there were more choices for wine. There was ONE Chianti Classico and I had to look up if it was DOCG. Now on to the food. It took nearly FOREVER to order, let alone get our appetizers and food. This made me feel like I was back in Italy. The chef brought out something delicious. Thank you for that. Our appetizer was pretty good. Loved the baratta. I think it would have been better served with a touch of prosciutto but not entirely disappointed. I ordered my FAVORITE dish cacio e pepe, which is exactly what it says it is: cheese and pepper. I was expecting something straight out of Italy, since this is an "authentic restaurant." The cacio e pepe was made with conchigli (shells)... which NEVER happens in Italy. It's always made with either a spaghetti or something similar. The chef also made this with pork. Cacio e pepe is never made with pork. EVER! Not to mention, because of health reasons, I can't have pork, so when I asked the waiter (who was extremely kind and helpful) if they could make the cacio e pepe with out the pork, the chef refused. If you're going to call yourself an authentic Italian chef, you should know the basics and do not insult our food by adding something that didn't belong.  Regardless, it's the chef's decision. I just thought it was an overkill. This was not my first experience here. I came once before and asked for take out because I didn't have time to sit down and eat a meal. The chef refused to prepare something for me to take out because it would change the quality of the food. This isn't Carbone, although it tries to be. Make the food and send me on my way. I don't think I'll be dining there again. It was a mediocre experience that is nothing like Italy. Save yourself $150 and get an Aperol Spritz somewhere else.
2017-08-28,5,I came here on Sunday night with my boyfriend and we had an excellent meal. I got the cacio de pepe, while he got the ricotto gnudi, both great. We both had a nice glass of red as well. We were pleasantly surprised when they brought out an appetizer compliments of the chef. The atmosphere was great, and we had two people taking care of us. A little confusing, but we were well taken care of. We will definitely be returning to try the rest of the menu.
2017-07-26,1,Service was really, really terrible.  I might go back for just a drink, but it's unlikely I would again subject myself to their time-bending service vortex.  Based on our limited sample of one visit, takeaways are:1. We each ordered different types of wine, and all were quite good. 2. Food was just okay.  Wasn't bad at all, but no one will think back fondly and say "I must have that again."3. Service -- from reading the other reviews here looks like I'm not alone in my view on this. If they can fix this, it will probably be a huge benefit to their business.
2017-06-27,4,Surprisingly a lot better than I thought it would be when we went here (albeit it was within a few months of opening).  We have since gone back at least once (both times for dinner, and we sat inside).  Pro's:  their pasta is amazing (try the tortellini), it wasn't too loud, they have indoor and outdoor seating, and they have a separate bar area with enough distance from/to the seated dinner area.  You can make a reservation.  Con's:  service was eh, and it's not BYOB, other than that, it's not cheap (but again the quality of the food we had was totally worth it).  Worth a try-make a reservation if you can )they get packed around dinner time especially on the weekends!
2017-06-27,1,Was seated outside with my wife immediately, had 4 different people ask us for drink orders or water. I got a glass of wine and water for the table. OK no problem. Ordered an appetizer (a roasted eggplant dip). We also ordered our entrees (2 pasta dishes). We received our appetizer after having to ask the waitress after 45 minutes (it was actually good which made us want to wait a bit longer for our entrees). Were told our food was up next. Asked multiple other times about our entree after continuing to wait. We were told they were busy and it's coming (restaurant was not very busy) soon. Someone else came over and asked if we wanted bread which we never received when we first sat down, and was so generous to offer us a single piece each. Nobody ever asked if we needed more water. We had to ask for everything here. Entrees were never served after an hour and a half so we left and got a slice of pizza at Vito's instead. I left 8 dollars on the table but I regret leaving any money at all.In an area with so many decent restaurants this one should not be worth your time. They don't value their customers so don't bother!
2017-06-23,3,First, our Appetizer was DELICIOUS. We had the bruschetta topped with asparagus. Sooo good! Service was great, no complaints there. We were excited when our food came because everything had been great up till that point but our entrees fell flat. They were underwhelming to say the least. I ordered the homemade pasta with shrimp. It was bland and over cooked. My fianceÃÅ ordered the octopus in rigatoni. He literally had one bite and wouldn't eat anymore. He said it was that bad. The octopus was too chewy, had an overly fishy taste and the sauce was bland. Overall, I personally liked the ambiance and vibe to this place. I would consider going again and just getting drinks and apps. Probably wouldn't order from the dinner menu again.
2017-05-26,2,Very mixed bag here. Cocktails were pretty nice. Service was slow at times. Rice balls were really good but then the branzino (fish itself was well cooked) was served on a salad thrown into a ball, which consisted of many raw uncooked onion halves. I could still taste onion the next day!
2017-05-26,1,ARROGANCE served!!!Let me preface this review by saying that my Husband and I eat out at least 3 times a week.  I have health issues which have caused food sensitivities and allergies.  This is the first restaurant which REFUSED to make an accommodation. The FACTS:Last year we came here a few times.  My favorite item was the eggplant parm appetizer.  Since the turn of 2017, I am unable to eat dairy.  So I ordered it without the cheese.  The server came back from the kitchen to inform me that the Chef WOULD NOT MAKE it without the cheese!!!  I could not believe my ears!  Why?  The Chef will not change any of his dishes if he feels it incomplete.  So I called the manager over, only to hear the same thing over and over again.We paid our drink tab and left.We will NEVER set foot in this restaurant again.Moral of the story:  if you have ANY need to make changes to something on the menu...DO NOT GO HERE!!!
2017-05-09,1,TERRIBLE SERVICEI have had two very mediocre dinner experiences here.  The first time the food came out freezing and nothing to write home about and the second time same story and the waitress was incredibly rude and asked us to finish our wine because they wanted to give the table to someone else.  I did come back for brunch as I live around the corner and was surprised that brunch seemed much better.  Well, I was back on Sunday for a third brunch with two friends and two kids and it was a terrible experience.  There was one other table in the entire place yet it took 30 minutes to get our drinks.  They just sat on the bar while the staff milled around in the kitchen.  It took a full hour to receive our food and when I questioned the waitress about where it was she barely even acknowledged that it was unacceptable to have to wait that long for some eggs.  When the food came out, it was again lukewarm and the poached eggs were full of water which is pretty gross.  We were told they ran out of sausage, however some appeared somehow.  Very odd.  Also, they brought frozen butter to the table which then they took back for another 20 minutes while it "thawed" so we then had somewhat thawed butter but freezing cold toast.  The biscuits were supposed to come with PB&J and instead they only came with some frozen butter as well and I was again met with astonished looks when I asked for the butter.  The restaurant looked completely staffed yet the service was unacceptable and terribly slow.  They could have cared less we were there and no consideration or apology for such terrible service. Despite a decent wine selection, I won't be back.  5 chances are enough.
2017-05-09,5,When sorellina opened I was sad to see helmers go but happy to find a place with great food, drinks and wine, but even better people. They have always treated my family like family and that I thank them. I highly recommend it for families, typically around opening. We spent our last night in the great town of Hoboken and it was the send off we needed, bittersweet.This is on the short list of must goes in a town desperate for more quality restaurants and less pub grub!
2017-05-07,1,SLOOOOW service I was here earlier today for brunch. The restaurant was almost empty. It took nearly 30 minutes to give us our drinks. 20 minutes after we ordered our food they told us there was no sausage, ok no problem but why wait 20 min. We didn't receive our food until a full hour later. My food was luke warm. I also ordered biscuits, however they gave us butter which was frozen. We then asked the staff to warm the butter. They returned 10 min later with 2 tiny pieces of butter which they warmed up. It seemed like the staff was a zombie and they made it unequivocally clear they could care less about us. I have been here several other times, however, after today it is unlikely I will return.
2017-05-07,1,These guys have a decent wine selection. Have been here a few times but this was my first time for brunch. The restaurant was pretty empty when we got there. They were finishing up with one large table. It took us about 30min to get our drinks after ordering and about an hour after that to actually get food. About 20 min after our order was placed they informed us there was no more sausage left. But...strangely enough when our food finally came there was miraculously sausage. They gave it to us on the house but still bizarre. Everything took forever from getting water to enough glasses for the 5 adults to getting juice for the kids. The food was like warm when it finally arrived and the poached eggs were watery. Probably won't be back.
2017-05-06,5,Went to this bar/Resto for the Kentucky derby with my gf. Super fun. Had a great open bar special with oysters and finger foods. A bunch of good drinks and friendly staff. Would def come back and try for dinner. Owner ever came over and said hi.
2017-05-04,2,I really wanted to love this place. The menu looks amazing and the vibe inside is good - but overall I was underwhelmed.  The service was so slow despite it not being busy.  Our cheese plate took forever to come out, once it did we were only served one roll of bread.  Our pastas sounded so good and we were starving but they were just ho-hum.  Maybe its a better place for drinks outside...
2017-05-01,5,The food is upscale, surprising as well as delicious.  Cocktails are the same.  Also, compared to similar places in Hoboken:--there is adequate space between tables, unlike bin 14 or so many others--the service is attentive but not obsequious (as at Grand Vin)--it isn't formal or stuffy, like Amanda'sAnd the decor and lighting are great.  Was very happily surprised!
2017-04-24,5,Amazing atmosphere and incredible food. Great spot for a date, dinner with friends or a quick stop at the bar. The food is creative, seasonal, often local and beyond delicious. Have the buratta!
2017-04-15,1,The cast of characters calling themselves bartenders was awful. They were wasted and obnoxious and slow. The seating at the bar was 12-15 stools and the restaurant was empty with 2 bartenders behind the bar. It took 10 minutes to get acknowledged then they served a completely wrong cocktail.
2017-04-08,3,I tried this place a couple times, unfortunately I think it's the service and staff that don't give this place enough stars. The food is pretty decent, but it is also overpriced on some items. The first time I came here with my fiance we ordered the octopus appetizer and it was about $18 for a place of few pieces :( I had a pasta bowl and my fiance had a chicken dish. They were both OK but it wasn't something we couldn't enjoy elsewhere for cheaper. The second time we were there, there were barely any customers inside, so we got a nice seat by the window. I find it weird that when you walk inside, the hostess table is all the way in the back? Anyhow, we were seated and we already knew what we wanted so we put in our orders. The pumpkin bread pudding is very yummy and that came out first. We ordered the duck egg and tuna sandwich. We waited 45 minutes to get two dishes in an barely filled restaurant so we ended up getting our food to go. The wait to get the food is ridiculous and that in itself says a lot, perhaps they need to staff up their kitchen?
2017-04-04,4,Sorellina is great but make sure to bring your wallet. Our table ordered a ton of food off the seasonally updated menu to eat family style and it was all amazing. We also tried out 3 different bottles of wine which were equally impressive. We'll be back but it'll be more of a treat rather than a casual night out.
2017-04-03,1,Don't waste your time with this place when there are so many other Hoboken restaurants with better service and food. Instead of apologizing for the long wait after we asked about our entrees, the hostess told us they purposely timed it like that (after our apps and salad came out haphazardly together and right after one another.) The food was ok (minus the burnt eggplant parm) but no where near an Amanda's, Bin14 or Anthony David's like this place is desperately trying to be and you'll find a stronger effort towards customer satisfaction at the 7-11.
2017-03-21,5,Been back a few times the past 2 months and I think its a place we will keep in the rotation.  Total 180 from the opening.  Service is now great as well as the food.  Totally impressed and the owner is doing a great job.  We live across the street and this place is great.
2017-03-17,5,New chef in the last 6 months or so has raised the food quality massively. Meat balls, radish with anchovies butter and squid chitarra are all amazing. Better than locande verde or babbo. I'm serious.
2017-03-06,1,As a local I felt guilty for not trying this place for so long. I had made the mistake of eating at Helmer's once. Lesson learned so I was glad to see a new restaurant take over. On a random Monday night I figured it was time to give it a go. One and done for me folks. Just awful. 2 entrees took around 30 mins. Must have been busy, right? A grand total of zero other patrons dining. In fact there were zero other patrons from what I could tell period. 2 people sitting at the bar, 2 more came later. Way overpriced. Tiny portions. No bread or anything for the table. My pasta was unbearably spicy hot. I'm not a bar person so I don't see myself visiting this place again. Sad because it's a great location but Hoboken seems to be setting the bar lower and lower in terms of dining. Really a shame but even in Hoboken you can do much better than Sorellina.
2017-03-05,1,I knew it was fish, it tasted fishy which Bronzino should not taste like. The fish was old and I did let management know and waiter.
2017-03-04,1,Alert:  Avoid at all costs.  Safety Issue was unresolved.  Came in to Sorellina on Thursday evening March 2, 2017.  Ordered the Bronzino fish dish and the mushroom pasta entree to share between the two of us.  Food tasted pretty good. The Bronzino does get a little overwhelmed by the cabbage, but overall decent food.  Over halfway through the meal, we made a startling discovery.  There was a piece of broken metal rod in the food almost one inch long.  We looked at each other in horror.  Did we just ingest any metal shards?  How could this happen?  A hair is one thing?  A piece of metal in the food is quite another.  I called the waiter, and he immediately took the plate and said he would talk to the chef and immediately departed never to return.  We waited for a few minutes still flabbergasted.  Finally, I signaled to a waitress to have the chef come out to talk to us.  She hesitated.  I said right now.  She said he is not here tonight.  I said whoever is responsible for the kitchen this evening, please have them come out.  She just walked away.  Eventually, I got the attention of a woman named Agnes who seemed to have some management authority.  She was very apologetic about the situation.  In retrospect, how did she know about the incident and not have approached us sooner.  Why did I have to call to her to get her to talk to us?  I was becoming angry at this point as Agnes continued to repeat herself by sorry a thousand times.  I said Agnes, just stop talking and do the right thing.  She did not know what that was.  I explained to her that this is a safety issue and to pull the dishes from customers who were already being served the same food.  Now, this is the best part.  She explained to me that because the pasta is cooked individually and separately, that there is no chance they could be serving metal to other patrons.  I couldn't take anymore of her stupidity, so I just repeated several times, just bring me the bill, as we want to leave.  The only thing that was prompt this evening was the bill.  I threw some cash down to cover it and walked out.  So, the best part?  Since we shared both plates, we think the metal was actually from the fish dish hidden in all the cabbage.  She just assumed it came from the pasta.  In Agnes' defense, she was a very nice young woman.  Unfortunately, this job is completely over her head.  So, a serious mistake was made, but how they handled it or choose not to handle it, that's what really speaks volumes.  And the kitchen, just wow.  Epic failure.  You have been warned!
2017-02-27,4,Disclaimer: this review is not all encompassing and may lack an accurate portrayal owing to the time of my visit.I came here around 4:00pm on a Saturday afternoon, just to have a glass of wine because the kitchen doesn't open until 5:00pm, I believe. The place was empty, my bf and I were the only two ppl there. We sat at the bar first then decided to sit at a table by the window, after all we had the entire place to ourselves. Also, the bartender seemed quite distant, polite but not particularly friendly which was kinda odd given that the place was empty and he had all the time to make nice. However, our server was a little more accommodating and he was quite knowledgeable about their wine selection. I wanted to start riding the roseÃÅ train a bit early but he was not quite committed to driving, however he did give me some directions as to how to get to my desired destination. Mind you, there were only three roseÃÅs on the list so I was bound to find my way. We ended up trying all three but really only liked one... I guess it's safe to say I won't be on that train again until, perhaps the summer.Overall, a large selection of wines, most of which received above average ratings, based on my wine app ( yup, I'm one of those). Efficient staff, nice space and the wines were reasonably priced given the $$$ assigned by Yelp; a different standard from Manhattan. I will definitely come back for dinner or at least for drinks when the place is in full swing to get a better perspective.Till then,Cin cin
2017-02-05,4,Great little wine bar/small plates. I really enjoyed my app and pasta dish. I think I'll become a regular here!
2017-01-28,4,My parents were visiting for a Saturday brunch in Hoboken. After finding out the original place we were going to go to had a 45 minute wait, we opted to walk around and look for something else. Luckily, we stumbled upon this restaurant.Although it was a medium sized crowd, the food (and the service) was impeccable. Out waiter was a 20-something guy who was super helpful and kind. He recommended the taylor ham dish and it did not disappoint. I was also able to try the sausage and peppers dish (also amazing) and a perfectly mild Bloody Mary. When we were on our way out, they even handed each of us complementary bread samples wrapped with a ribbon :)Definitely recommend for brunch.
2017-01-25,5,I am not sure why there are some negative reviews below - I have always had a great experience here with good service and delicious food. In fact, this is our favorite brunch spot in Hoboken! Way more cute and delicious than nearby over-hyped places in my opinion. I would highly recommend giving this place a try for brunch.
2017-01-24,3,For the most part the food was excellent with a few small exceptions. Pasta portions were quite small and don't work as entrees. They would do better to offer an optional larger portion for an entree. All told a decent place in a neighborhood starved for good options.
2017-01-22,5,I had just had the Cacio e Pepe pasta for lunch. Amazing, just to die for!!! Definitely worh it!!!
2017-01-13,4,This was a great date restaurant. Noise level allowed for conversation. Wait staff was attentive. Food was tasty. We ordered a bottle of wine. He ordered the meatballs & steak. I ordered the fettuccini (which was delish). I would say the desert menu could use a boost (hello? Could I simply have a piece of cake?) Definitely worth checking out though.
2017-01-07,2,Since my boyfriend is new to Hoboken, we decided to take a stroll around the neighborhood. We passed by Sorellina, which looked like a cute date spot. Since we had some time to kill, we decided to grab a drink.I had the Forza Negroni (Bulleit Bourbon, Sweet Vermouth, Campari) and he had the Classico Negroni (Dorothy Parker Gin, Carpano Antica Vermouth, Campari). Both tasted pretty similar and had a little too much Campari for my taste. You're probably better off sticking to a glass of vino from their wine list, which is pretty extensive and reasonably priced.Some of the appetizers stood out to us so we also ordered a bite to eat. We had the Grilled Cherrystone Clam Spiedini {with housemade chorizo, caracara orange marmalade & sourdough croutons} and Nonna's Meatballs (pomodoro braised veal & ricotta). Neither of these appetizers were good. They certainly looked appetizing but that was about it. The clams were ridiculously chewy. I even tried cutting them up into super tiny pieces but even then, it was extremely difficult to eat. The meatballs had an okay flavor but the texture was just not the way meatballs should be. I don't know what it was - maybe they ground up their meat too much but the consistency was that of a hot dog. My boyfriend compared it to a Vienna sausage.I was really hoping to like this place but if the appetizers we ordered weren't very good, I'm not sure if I would want to be back to try the mains. Guess we'll just have to find another go-to Italian spot in the neighborhood.
2017-01-03,2,I like to gauge my experience more on the front of the house then the back of the house when I am sharing my opinion of a new restaurant. So, we were celebrating our grandma's birthday (she was born and raised in Hoboken) so we thought it would be nice to try a new place close to her house. We made reservations because we were a group of 8. We got to sit right away in the front of the restaurant. The place looks nice, comfy seats, nice decor, I think they did a pretty good job with the whole place. They even have the original bar, which my grandma talked about a couple of times. Overall, it was not a terrible experience, but I did a few times laugh at some of the comments that came from our waiter throughout the entire dinner. It should be noted, that he seemed like the only person working the restaurant, so I am sure when he has more help, things go much better in terms of service. He was as attentive as possible but as more folks arrived for dinner, he seemed more and more frustrated as the evening went on, which meant our service got slower and slower as the night went on. Some things that we experienced:Most Italian restaurants put bread on the table, this place does not. We had to ask multiple times for more bread. So if you are planning on doing any carb-loading, this is not a place for you. We were told that we had to put in our entire order at the beginning of our order, when we asked if we could have some time to look over the entrees, we were told, you can take a minute and our waiter was serious, he literally came back 1 minute later. He took our appetizer away which was not finished, when we asked him if we could please have the plate of brie back with some bread, he said okay, only to come back and say we would have to pay again for the brie. We told him that he took a full piece of brie from us, he just laughed and walked away. The pasta, well, I have had better. The dessert, well, I have had better.I doubt that this place will stand the test of time in Hoboken, the prices are very high and the food is just average. I believe that most places need to have a signature dish or something that makes a customer want to come back, this place does not in my opinion have that "wow" factor just yet.
2016-12-30,1,This is a poor mans bin 14.  Take the charred eggplant off the menu please. It tastes like a cigarette and made us nauseous. The service was awful. My friend caught me up on almost two weeks of her life before someone came to take our drink order.  Then throughout the whole meal someone checked us maybe once.  We wanted to ask about a dessert menu.  Waiting about 20 min before we saw a waiter! Do yourself a favor and skip this place.
2016-12-05,2,I really, really wanted to like it here.  The place looks so adorable and cozy from the outside and it's so close to our apartment - it could have been a great addition to town.  The Yelp reviews are all over the place, so my husband and I decided to just give it a try ourselves on a recent weeknight.The atmosphere is as lovely as the outside promises, dim and cozy, with a nice bar area and table in the windows - based on atmosphere alone it would actually make a great date spot.They tout themselves as a wine bar, and they did have a large wine selection to choose from.  Most of the offering was pretty affordable too.  We ordered a bottle of Valpolicella - unfortunately, it was only ok.For dinner, we started with a charcuterie board - of the three meats on the plate, I only liked 1. The other 2 were completely unmemorable and if fact, the salami has a really unpleasant flavor.  For entrees, I had the mushroom pasta which was so salty as to be bordering on inedible and my husband had the bolognese which was ok, but nothing we couldn't have made better at home.  I did enjoy the fact that they had struffoli on the menu for dessert - I've never seen that at a restaurant before!  They were fresh and hot and delicious, but they didn't have enough honey so they weren't very sweet. Even so, they get a bonus point for this!So sadly, I would say that this is a pretty mediocre showing.  I'd go back to have a glass of wine at the bar, but not for dinner.  I have heard from friends that brunch is good though - so maybe I'll give that a try next time.
2016-12-01,4,I was overdue for trying this place. I walk by it daily. I was not expecting much, not certain why. Was I wrong. We loved everything. We shared a bunch of apps. Meatballs, octopus, bruschettas (amazing). Service was great. Atmosphere lively, but not claustrophobic. I will be back. Thank you for coming to the neighborhood and adding quality dining.
2016-11-29,5,Impressive wine list, short but oh so sweet menu that changes seasonally.  The house made pastas are amazing.  Great bar and bartenders, nice ambiance, will certainly go again!
2016-11-27,4,Second time here. Really happy with the service and food. My friends and I got the fried ricotta gnudi to start- if you're a cheese fan, get this. NOM! We were given a complimentary appetizer as well. It was some sort a butternut squash spread with bread. I ordered the grilled bistecca which came with Italian long hot peppers. DOUBLE NOM! My friends enjoyed their mushroom farfalle and the pollo alla griglia, too. Our waiter let us taste the wines we were interested in but unsure of...no whining, just wining over here. Check out Sorellina if you're in town!
2016-11-24,3,I want to start off saying the service was great. We had two people taking care of us. They were both excellent. They gave us enough time to look over the menu, which took a while. We never felt rushed. They were at tentative and friendly.The squid ink pasta dish was great. The flavor was excellent. It had this spicy kick to it after each bite, which I really enjoyed.They have a huge wine list. We had to google the bottles to figure out which one to get. We got the tami I believe. It was good.The restaurant is big enough so that you get enough space between the tables so you don't feel like you're on top of each other. Bathrooms are small though.All that being said, the branzino dish wasn't edible. It was the saltiest dish I've ever had in my life. I've never complained about salt before, but this was intense. I was going to just eat the potatoes, but they weren't cooked enough. They were too hard.I had someone else try my dish to make sure I wasn't tripping. They agreed with me though.I felt terrible. I didn't send it back. I just kinda scraped it around to look eaten. I'm hoping the chef just screwed up with my dish. I would try the restaurant again, but definitely not the branzino.
2016-11-22,5,I never write reviews, but truly loved this place so feel I need to. We ordered the fried green tomatoes (very thinly sliced, deeply fried, and paired with grilled ham), which were heavy, but delicious - definitely, don't order if you want a light meal. We also got the burrata, which was fantastic, as well. Last, we shared the squid ink pasta (new to the menu) paired with calamari. I was skeptical ordering this, as I'm not the biggest calamari lover, but ended up fighting my boyfriend for the last bites. SO yummy. Our server was very attentive and informative, despite being a busy Friday night. Admittedly, this place was a little on the pricey side (~$100 with 3 drinks), and what we ordered probably would have left us starving if we went in super hungry, but overall, it was a wonderful experience and I will definitely be back! Highly recommend as a good date or girl's night spot.
2016-10-26,4,Finally, a great Italian place in Hoboken! Given the amount of mediocre Italian joints in town, I was not anticipating food as good as this. The escarole caesar w/ white anchovies is awesome. If you like veggies, you'll love the roasted carrots and squash. The bronzino in a mustard cream sauce w/ spring onions was one of the best fish dishes I've had in recent memory. Only thing that didn't impress us was the kale/squash buccatini. Fresh homemade pasta but quite flavorless. However, the rigatoni ragu at the table next to us smelled delicious. Next time. Fried dough balls w/ banana gelato for dessert was just okay. Gelato could use more banana flavor and the dough balls were a bit too doughy.  But, I'm not a big dessert guy so who cares? Definitely going back asap to try the rigatoni.Staff is super nice, too.
2016-10-23,4,Came here for date night, the menu gives you plenty of option but not overly expansive to the point that you have trouble choosing something. The menu was seasonal, fresh, inventive. For appetizer we had zuchinni fritter with burrata, so delish and different from italiant restaurants typical appetizer options! We also had a cheese plate and the octopus app. Ive def had better octopus, serving size on the octo was also pretty measly. Our entrees themselves were a touch disappointing, my homemade cavatelli had so much potential!! but it came out room temperature :(. Overall, these people really know what they are doing, not your typical hoboken italian restaurant. looking forward to going back again and again. atmosphere: romantic, decor: chic, menu: seasonal, fresh, inventive, service: A plus, appetizers: 5 stars, entrees: 3.5 stars
2016-10-22,3,Went in last night for my wife's birthday. Overall, our experience was average at best. Great selection of wine but our meal was nothing special and definitely not worth the price. The service was also lacking. Seems like they are still working out some kinks, although I liked the creativity in the menu options and see definite potential for improvement.
2016-10-21,1,Small portions and too expensive! Not worth it when margheritas is so close by! Save your money and go there.
2016-10-17,5,We came for Brunch and were blown away by the menu and food!While there were MANY interesting choices, my husband and I both ordered the sunny-side up duck egg with mushrooms...and our intrigue were handsomely rewarded in the form of deliciousness.  The egg was perfectly done, runny inside with a firm yolk bottom and tender whites.  While the egg white was similar to that of chicken egg, however the duck yolk was spectacular.  It was very rich and the texture was a slightly thicker than regular chicken eggs.  Add some of the mushrooms with each bite gave it an interesting umami flavor or dip the breadstick given on the side.While sitting outside, we noticed a pleasant baking smell and asked our waiter where it was coming from.  We were surprised and happy to learn that they have a BAKER ON STAFF!  And that we were smelling the joys of baking...at the waiter's recommendation, we then added the bread board to our order and it was another smash!  We had the cream filled donut, walnut crumb cake, pumpkin cheesecake danish and cheddar biscuits.  ALL were fabulous!Lastly, I ordered the peach bellini, which was also delicious and the balance between the nectar and the proseco was just perfect.I am looking forward to return time and time again!!!
2016-10-12,4,I wish there were a 4.5 rating.  I had been avoiding the restaurant due to some bad initial reviews, but this was a really great dinner.   The server was very friendly and attentive.  Started off with 2 glasses of Prosecco that were very tasty.  We then had a bottle of light red wine that was also delicious.  For an appetizer we had the mixed peppers in a garlic sauce - very good and also not something I have seen on a menu before.  I had the chicken and I can honestly say it was the best chicken I have ever had - perfectly crispy skin, very flavorful and moist.  My wife had the shrimp and that was equally as good.  We also had the ice cream sandwiches for dessert and that was a fantastic closing to a great meal.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant.  A little pricey for Hoboken, but definitely worth the trip.
2016-10-12,4,Sorellina is a cute spot.  Great wine list.  Good service.  The food was good but the menu is definitely limited.  The veal meatballs were tasty but had too much of a lemon flavor which I didn't care for.  They would be a lot better without the lemon.  The best part of the meal was their homemade ice cream sandwiches for dessert.  Highly recommend!
2016-10-05,1,Dined here last night, this is the second time giving this place a shot.  The chef refused to make any accommodations to their limited menu, and frankly the menu needs some work.  We ordered veal meatballs as an appetizer, which were good minus the hint of lemon that somehow ended up in them.  Not sure if it was just bad sauce or there was some cross contamination.  Also, we found our waitress to be quite rude.  Nearing the end of our meal, she said "I will bring you the check now".  She never offered us another cocktail, or coffee etc.  Frankly, she didn't even ask if we were finished, nor did she offer if we wanted to take the remaining food home with us.  However, the pasta bolognese was not bad.Overall, absolutely positively not worth the price.  Would rather eat anywhere else in Hoboken.  Rude service, mediocre food, no substitutions (better not have allergies) and small portions. This is bound to be another failed restaurant.
2016-10-03,2,I was really excited when I found out Hoboken welcomed a new wine bar so I got a table here on a Friday night. Will admit that the staff were very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is also very nice - classy and elegant; good place for a date or catch up with friends (there were a good amount of people at the bar too). However, the food was pretty much bland. I am not really picky when it comes to food -  but I will say that the food really lacked flavor and I doubt that there were any herbs/spices in the dishes. The bill was an exorbitant amount and the wine that we got was extremely weak and disappointing ($ 44 dollar bottle of wine). If you are looking for a wine bar and some good food to snack on, Bin 14 is a much better choice. Sorellina is a little more spacious so that's a plus, but it's not the best bang for your buck.
2016-09-25,5,My friend and I went there for dinner Last night (sat). We sat at the bar. There were 3 bartenders there all very attentive and friendly and let us taste the wines we ordered. My friend ordered the octopus and salad, and I ordered the goat cavateli all were delicious and came out right away. I got my last glass of champagne on the house bc apparently no one ever ordered it so Lucas, one of the bartenders, opened a new bottle. I loved it after drinking the first glass. We asked if they can put on the Mets/Phillie game they did it for us right away! Overall we had a wonderful experience there!
2016-09-19,5,I love this restaurant and probably eat here too much. The people are nice, the food is extraordinary and there is always a new delicious wine for me to try. I am so glad it is here in Hoboken and only one block from my apartment.
2016-09-10,4,Overall a great first time experience at Sorellina. The food and service were both excellent. I highly recommend the meatballs as an app or first course. The fried rice balls were also very good. I had the Farfelle pasta with mushrooms which was excellent. My wife had the halibut which was very good. The portions were decent size. The wine options were very good .The reason for the 4 stars was the lame portions we got on the homemade gelato. For 4 bucks you should get more than a few tablespoons.  Despite that the experience was great.
2016-09-10,4,Here's the thing. The decor = awesome. The service = great. The food taste = wonderful. The portion = smaller than most. I love Italian food. Hoboken is no stranger to Italian cuisine so when a new one pops up in town, it better show its chops. My wife and I celebrated our 4th Anniversary here because we were looking forward to trying it. We were greeted and seated promptly and our eager server came right away to welcome us. With an impressive wine list and some interesting cocktails, the first impression was great. We ordered the speck and tomato bruschetta for the appetizer and while we enjoyed the taste, there weren't much tomatoes to be found on it. For our entree I went with the goat milk ravioli and my wife chose the Bolognese. Both were very flavorful but both were tiny in portion. My wife and I left and we were both still hungry. At a total price tag of around $100 for everything (including two glasses of wine and tax/tip) we hoped we would be more stuffed when we left. I mean, it is Italian right?
2016-09-02,4,Amazing food. Great meatballs and the bolognese was on point. Service very attentive. Love this place for Italian Tapas. Didn't love the cheese plate. Highly recommend coming here for a date night as the atmosphere is welcoming, classy and yet causal.
2016-08-12,4,So the food is amazing!!!!! Honestly everything we ordered tasted incredible!!! Menus 1 star cuz the bill ... A little pricy but would def come back anyways because the food was sooooo damn good.. From apps to entrees to desserts .. Yum
2016-07-31,3,For an Italian restaurant, I was disappointed when they under cooked the noodles. Flavors were good, and enjoyed Nona's meatballs.
2016-07-15,1,What can I say about this place.  Awesome location,but sucky food.  It just wasn't hitting on any level.  And by that, I mean - flavor/taste, presentation, or plate portion just wasn't there.They must be from that part of Italy where they are afraid to use any herbs or spices; it just couldn't satisfy my palate, and definitely not my children's palate.  For my  children, I ordered them an orange juice b/c they ran out of apple juice; the o.j. was fresh squeezed w/pulp so of course they hated it.  Luckily there was a convenient store next door, so hubby ran over to grab them an apple juice.  For food, I ordered them what I imagined to be the safe choice, which wasnt even on the menu, but figured what every Italian restaurant should make and/or know how to make - Spaghetti with meatballs.  There were two things wrong, okay maybe three things; the plate portion was super small, just enough for a toddler. But the flavor, OMG, bitter as hell.  The meatballs slightly sweet, but probably was the only good thing on that table tonight.  The lightly fried mussels, were so so.  The grilled octopus, eh :-/ And the ceasar salad w/anchovies, which was made up of some fresh and some browning leaves, anchovies, which tasted like they soaked in vinegar and super hard to get down.  Cocktails ordered - the Basilica and Mr. Amore. Bartendar, where was the alcohol at??? It was a damn Iced Tea and Lemonade for $12 each.  I initially ordered a glass of vino, wish I would have stuck with my first decision.  In total we spent $88 (minus the gratuity).  The service was ok, the only touch of fine dining was the manager stopping by the table to see if everything was okay.  But she had this aura about her that just seemed ingenuine and dead. The waiter was a young kid,  he came around when it mattered, like bringing the food and the check.
2016-07-10,5,Very attentive. Very nice. Very tasty. Very nice atmosphere. We came for a Sunday brunch and I really thought the menu was limited at first, but after we picked a few items for the table (biscuits, bacon, and octopus), we realized everything was rich and plenty. Main dishes were delicious and plenty big for each person. I had a breakfast frittata and I quite liked it (it was like a breakfast lasagna). Did I mention the staff was attentive?  They constantly checked on us (in a polite, non invasive way). They cared. I will come back!
2016-07-01,5,Don't walk run to this place! Everything is so good!!!! The tuna crudo, grilled octopus, bruschetta! Delicious!!!
2016-06-19,3,Came here for dinner on a Saturday night, we were a table of four. I've been super excited to try out this place since we really need more date night spots and less bar food in Hoboken. Started off with a prosecco (obviously) and a cheese and meat plate. A little disappointed with the cheese selection to be honest. I love my cheese so I wish I saw a few more options up my alley but you win some you lose some. No complaints on the meat plate. Next we ordered two octopus apps. Both came out so ridiculously burnt you couldn't even see what you were eating. Coming the restaurant business myself I wouldn't have even brought that out. The server took it back and brought us back a new order which still was so crispy it didn't taste like octopus. Next we ordered the carrots and squash both just ok. We then shared the burrata and the scallops. Burrata was excellent and the scallops were just good. The service was ok, a little on the slower side. Overall it was decent but there is definitely room for improvement. Will try it out again once they work out all the kinks considering they just opened.
2016-06-18,1,Had to wait for over an hour to get our main course and to be honest the wait wasn't worth for the food.  I've had much better dining experience for the $$ we spent on dinner. On top the staff admitted and apologized for a slow service but a little too late. Had we had plans post dinner we would have walked out while waiting for our main course! And what disappoints & angers me is them taking me for a fool with serving pasta that wasn't prepared well with no gravy or sauce in it! And I'm so upset that I'm writing this review while having my dinner at this place. Just couldn't wait! Mihir
2016-06-15,2,I'll start off my saying I'm a pretty tough critic. I work in a high end restaurant in the city under a Michelin Star chef. Upon being sat inside (the restaurant is pretty) we were greeted by the server and started on some drinks. Both of which were very good- the Basilica (vodka cocktail) and another cocktail of Gin Mare. Drinks were strong with great flavor. I'd go back here strictly for cocktails. We ordered olives and arancini to start. The olives were $6 and literally the worst, most tasteless olives I've ever had. How you can screw up olives, I'm not sure. There were maybe 9-10 giant olives on the plate of different colors and all were awful. There was none of the normal olive saltiness to them. There were maybe four small olives which tastes okay. It was bizarre. The arancini had fava beans mixed into the rice/cheese mixture- odd again. Then a duck pate was served complimentary. Neither of us ate it since of dietary preferences were never asked in the beginning and I don't eat duck. We decided not to order mains from here and just finish our cocktails. Great potential, but missing the mark. Cute decor!
2016-06-09,3,I have been here maybe 6 times. Here is an honest review based on what I've tried and the service I have experienced so far. The meat and cheese platter size was offensively sparse for the price that was charged. I have ordered it on 3 separate occasions and each time the quantity given was not consistent and generally smaller each time.The bolognase is a solid dish. Very good. No complaints there. I had the Italian cookies for desert. The priciest desert on the menu I think. And my honest feedback is that it tasted like hard store bought cookies from a supermarket. I had two bites and left the rest on the plate. They should consider removing that desert item. It is not good. Service was fine. No complaints.And lastly, I thinks it's absurd that they don't turn on the televisions. This is not fine dining. They are loosing out on business for people who want to enjoy decent meal at a bar and catch a game after work. BIN 14 has much better food and even they have two small TVs.
2016-06-07,4,There's definitely a lot of mixed reviews on this restaurant so I had to give it a try. I came here on a Saturday night. The place itself is stunning. Great space, nice lighting, and great service as well. We started with a bottle of red (not a wine drinker so not sure what it was) and it was very good to the liking of the whole table. For my appetizer I had the clam crudo oreganata. They seemed fresh and were cleaned well. A refreshing way to start the meal. My entree was the Rigatoni Bolognese with pork, veal, and beef. I really liked this dish. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the meat sauce was seasoned well and tasty. For dessert, we got homemade ice cream sandwiches. The snickerdoodle cookies were great and the ice cream was delicious. For the most part, I really enjoyed this place. Is it the best Italian food ever? No, but it's definitely worth a try and maybe you'll enjoy it more than others.
2016-05-26,4,Glad I got to try this restaurant for myself after hearing such mixed reviews.  My two girlfriends and I shared the escarole caesar salad, grilled zucchini with pine nuts and the octopus. The salad and zucchini were amazing. The fresh anchovies mixed in the salad added a delicious flavor. The zucchini was grilled nicely and the sage/pine nuts paired nicely into its marinade. I was not thrilled with the octopus, which surprised me because there were so many positive reviews and recommendations on this appetizer  It was very, very small. If you have ever been to Otto Strada, you would see why I was disappointed in the size but beyond that the the taste was basic and bland. We then shared two pastas which were fantastic. The pastas were both cooked aldenti to perfection! We had the bolognese (which i cant figure out why anyone complained about this dish). The portion size is perfect for one.... anyone who knows true Italian food knows that pasta is the premier course so if its "not enough" for you then splurge and get a second course of meat or fish. We also had the Gigli Alll' Amatriciana which was spicy, hence its name. Beautifully formed pasta shapes brought a decadence to this dish that cannot go without mentioning.We had a glass of the Orvieto wine which, as expected, was crisp and delightful.I am so glad I finally got to try this restaurant and will definitely be back very soon!!
2016-05-24,5,Excellent! Everything was delicious. Wonderful appetizers and unbelievable homemade pastas. Great service too!!
2016-05-23,5,My husband and I went last night (a Sunday) to Sorellina and all I can say is: thank god I have some place else to get high quality food (that isn't Anthony David's or Cucharamama--the only two restaurants I'll take guests to). I had intended on getting the Clam crudo appetizer but unfortunately they were sold out of it. The waitress recommended I try the Burrata while my husband got the Nonna meatballs. I don't eat meat but he seemed to enjoy them. The Burrata was DELICIOUS. I all but licked the plate! The sauce and the bean salad it came with was fantastic. For my entree, I got the scallops. The nut & jam accompaniments truly made the dish; they were an unexpected contrast to the scallops. The scallops could have been seared a touch longer, but altogether were fantastic. Additionally, what I liked was that they had craft beers on tap that I had never heard of before. My husband and I split a light, grapefruit beer. Next time I think I might try one of their small vineyard, strictly Italian, wines. The service was good & the restaurant is nicely decorated and has a decent sized outdoor space. Altogether, very pleased! (However, if you're looking for a frugal night, note: this is not it!)
2016-05-22,2,The only reason I am giving this place two stars is because the service and wine were actually fantastic. The food, however.... Trying. Too. Hard. The appetizers were pretty good. The octopus was amazing. And then...Things went downhill when the mains came out. With a nice big group, there was plenty of "seagulling" to try each other's food.  The meal presentations were sloppy and unappealing, the bolognese was bland and the seafood dishes were incredibly mediocre. I ordered the scallops. Small and over cooked and drowning in apricot jelly. And that's the nicest thing I can say about them. Someone else ordered the salmon pasta. Top 3 worst meals I've ever seen. The wine selection was fantastic. I might go back for a drink at the bar and give it another try. I will definitely avoid the cat food pasta. If you want something more upscale, the food at Bin 14 and Anthony David's is exponentially better. Come back Helmers! We miss you.
2016-05-02,4,Went to Sorellina for dinner Friday night and had a mostly good experience.  Had a reservation for 8PM and were seated within a few minutes of our arrival.  The server was pleasant and energetic - frankly, she was great!Friends ordered some of the craft beers they offer (unique beers, which they loved) and we ordered a couple appetizers - Buratta and Mussels.  The Buratta was good, but the bean salad that accompanied it was really good!  The mussels were unique (deep fried with ocra) and were also tasty; better without the marinara than with - but not spicy at all, even though menu says they are.For entrees - we ordered - Branzino - EXCELLENTPasta Bolognese - kind of blandPasta with speck and peas (forgot the actual name) - Really Good!The only real issue we had was that all of the entrees came out staggered (poor timing) with the last one (mine) coming out when others were basically done eating.  The owner/manager (??) did come over to apologize and removed my entree from the bill - they quickly addressed the issue and took care of it, kudos for that!For dessert we ordered their snickerdoodle and salted caramel ice cream sandwich - really good; and the Struffoli - ok, not great, but good for sharing!Overall a mostly positive experience, enough so I will give them another shot!
2016-04-28,4,While I'm still a bit nostalgic for the old Helmers, and part of me was hoping a German eatery would remain, Sorellina's is a fine compromise. Yes, Hoboken is overrun with Italian inspired fare, but that seems to be slowly changing and the new Italian faces are matured and discerning, hitting the right notes between classic and modern (Grand Vin and Panello's comes to mind).  A few over priced items might leave you with a bitter taste (just keep an eye out) but overall the menu and atmosphere work well in tandem. A welcome addition to a coveted uptown spot.
2016-04-23,5,This was my first time here and I will definitely be back. Wonderful atmosphere and decor, good cocktails and wine list. The pasta was delicious. The staff was friendly and attentive and every single person we met was a pleasure to speak with. That alone will bring me back to Sorellina!
2016-04-17,1,One of the worst dining experiences I've had in Hoboken (Besides the waiter, he was great and adorably genuine). We arrived at 5pm on Sunday for our reservation and saw a mostly empty inside seating area. I brought my family including a few that were visiting from out of state, since the aesthetic looked nice and we wanted to try something new. We got our drinks and 25min into sitting, we had received no bread. We only realized that we were supposed to get it once we saw a family next to us get it within minutes of arriving. I asked someone else (not our waiter) for bread and they brought one 6-inch piece of bread in a basket for a group of 10 people. We asked for another basket and received another small piece of bread.. Just enough so we all could have a single chew. We placed our orders with our waiter and then proceeded to wait 30min for appetizers to start rolling out (things like salad, etc..). An 1hr into service, 3 entrees still hadn't been served even though everyone else has finished their food. Echoing the sentiment of other reviewers, these portions are comically small and unnecessarily expensive. Half of our meals were bland, some too spicy -all around, lackluster. After having a quick talk with the owner, she let me know that they were working on the missing entrees. After voicing the other issues, she told me they don't normally get complaints about the food. It's important to remember it took all of these other things going wrong in order for me to feel like it was worth telling her any of the issues. Had it been just the food, I wouldn't have said anything.. But that doesn't mean the food was good/great or anything in between. They removed the 7 drinks from our bill as an apology (not enough to make me want to give them a second chance..). Then we noticed two appetizers on our check that we didn't order, which they had to remove.. The cherry on top!The owner didn't seem genuinely apologetic and proceeded to talk to multiple staffers while staring/pointing at me in reference. Not really something you should do in the front of house. Best of luck Sorellina!
2016-04-14,3,Well they got one thing right... The branding is excellent... But the food? The appetizers were tasty but the entrees were small and flavorless and probably too expensive for pasta quite honestly.  There are much better places in Hoboken for a dish of pasta. I would go back for some wine and apps but definitely not main course.
2016-04-04,5,Absolutely amazing! The staff was knowledgeable, attentive, and helpful. The decor and atmosphere was wonderful! The owner, Gabi Lombardi, came out and visited with us. She is extremely hands on. I highly recommend this restaurant!
2016-04-02,1,I tried this place recently and not impressed. Worst than that, why all the fake reviews??????All the raves about the best food and service, while most customers are out of state and only have used Yelp one to a few times?????? Something is wrong here
2016-04-02,4,I was disappointed to see the reviews of Sorellina so far but still was excited to try it.  Upon entrance the decor is nice and space is good for date night.  Our waitress Chelsea was great and explained the menu and theme of the restaurant to great extent. We had the olives and mozz for app.  The olives are good and I wouldnt order the mozz again.  We then shared the polenta and swordfish for dinner. The swordfish was average to above average. The Polenta was outstanding.  Our wine was delicious and there was alot of choices at varying price points.  I think this is a rival of Bin 14 and is much better.  I cant give five stars because for the price the food isnt outstanding but it is good and i would like to try different options next time.  Chelsea was a great, knowledgeable, attentive server. I would recommend Sorellina for date nights and girls night out!
2016-04-01,2,My food was just ok, limited portions for the price. The atmosphere is great but  my wine had a ton of sediment at the bottom - Yuck! You have to get an appetizer otherwise the wait is a bit long.
2016-04-01,3,Checked out this place a couple of times.  Taking over the old Helmer's spot they didn't change too much inside.  Not a bad thing it all works pretty well.Sort of a mixed bag, so I can understand both the positive and negative reviews.The cocktails I tried were great.  Some creative items made with quality ingredients.  The wine.... well between sampling and ordering 5 or 6 different glasses between the multiple visits, it was hit or miss.  Some nice selections and not less than nice selections.  The food....  Meat and Cheese plates were both good to very good, as was the branzino.  However, this is where the big problem came in.... tiny portions for the money.Four drinks, a meat plate, a cheese plate and 1 entree all split between 2 people - was over $150 with tip.  The cocktail was the only thing I'd say was great.  A $15 glass of wine was also good but for $15, it had better be.  Service was friendly and complimented the experience. Overall, though having left still a bit hungry I was a little disappointed at that price.
2016-03-29,5,Excellent food and excellent service. These people really care about your food experience. Try the roasted carrots. The sauce is delicious.
2016-03-29,5,Great bar atmosphere.  Enjoyed the Bianco Negroni to start.  All Italian wine list pairs great with the menu. Va bene!Nonna's meatballs are a must have and seasonal bruschetta are awesome.
2016-03-27,4,Given the mixed reviews, I was skeptical as to what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised with my meal at Sorellina's. I chalk up those bad reviews to the fact that it was a new joint, still trying to get their feet under themselves. It looks like they have! My partner and I sat at the bar on a week night. I really enjoyed sitting at the bar, and I thought the staff was very attentive, even as the night went on when it started to get very busy. They brought out a little sample of a crostini, along with bread. The bread was average (as in good enough to order a second basket to sop up my meal, but not mouth watering-delicious on its own), but the crostini was a nice touch. I particularly enjoyed the negroni section of the cocktail menu, from which I ordered a cocktail and really enjoyed. One of the highlights was the walnut chicory salad. Delicious, crunchy, great dressing! I will be ordering this every time. We split the kale pesto bruschetta and arancini. I've had many arancini in my day, from all over the world, and these were perfectly right. My main dish was the gnocchi. While I wasn't blown away by it, I think it was a personal preference and have nothing bad to say about the dish. Everything came out quickly, apart from the gnocchi, which we asked them to check on, and they were very apologetic about it and let us know it would be out soon. One thing people rave about is the set up and decor of the restaurant. I don't love the seating, and am confused by it, but I do love the bar area and standing tables. Those are great. I noticed a carrot dish someone ordered to my right that looked unreal, so I will be back to try that!
2016-03-25,2,Went out Thursday night w a group of 4 to check out this spot. Service was good, ambience was nice but the entreÃÅes were below average. It was over priced and not worth the $. Recommended for APPS and wine NOT main courses.
2016-03-25,3,Really enjoyed the bartender.  He was personable and charming.  Will go back to see him. But disappointed that the hostess said they didn't have any tables available for 2 hours yet we sat there waiting at the bar and LITERALLY half the restaurant was empty till she was ready to seat us.
2016-03-21,5,The grilled octopus and sopressata was some of the best I've ever had!!  In addition, the pecan pesto and burrata was worth getting 5!  We loved the cod cheeks as well, will definitely be back, a fine addition to the mile square!
2016-03-18,2,We went to Sorellina on March 18th and weren't impressed. We ate at the bar, and started with Nonna's Meatballs and the Arancini. Both were just fine, nothing special. The portion size seemed kind of puny for the cost. The bartender said that the Pappardelle Bolognese is his favorite, so we both ordered that for our entree. It was a small portion, the pasta didn't taste very homemade, and there was very little sauce/meat. All-in-all, it was a lackluster experience, sort of overpriced, and we probably won't go back.
2016-03-18,4,SO excited to see Sorellina open up in this space.  We live around the block and were very much looking forward to trying it.  Came on a Saturday for lunch and were quickly seated.  The staff was friendly and accommodating - I was very impressed with the service.  I ordered the Chittara ala Carbonara for lunch and it was very good, though a bit too heavy on the salt.  My husband was less impressed with his Pizza Rustica, which is not a "pizza" as we envisioned it but more a pie.  We shared the Arancini, which was delicious and rich.  We will be back to try more food.  What I wasn't super impressed with was that I ordered a Brooklyn Lager on draft and it was pretty flat.  Also, the pricing is a bit high for the portion size - I left somewhat hungry, which is a shame considering we spent over $80 for 2 on lunch (including drinks).  Still, Sorrellina is quite a solid addition to the neighborhood!
2016-03-18,3,Went here for dinner last week - please note the 3 stars are not reflective of the food (which is amazing)!  But it is a very very loud establishment for a wine bar.  Also, if you don't know Italian wines stick to the cocktails.  I will be back but probably just drink/eat at the bar next time.
2016-03-14,1,I was excited a new restaurant popped up in Hoboken but throughly disappointed in our experience. We ate there on a quiet night. Service was great - a little too attentive though. The food was subpar. The meatballs came out barely room temperature. The burrata with the pecan pesto was very very oily and grainy. Like they didn't take the time to properly make the pesto. My entree, pappardelle bolognese was vial. It had to of been sitting there a few days. The pasta was really thick and heavy. Did not at all taste like homemade pasta as advertised on the menu. My husband has the tortellini and it tasted old as well. Not to mention I got super sick a few hours later through the entire night.  We didn't have any alcohol and the dinner was $77. Overpriced joke. I would never eat here again and told my friends to not bother trying it. Don't waste your time either. Just go to Bin14.
2016-03-14,5,I unexpectedly found myself in Hoboken this weekend and was lucky enough to stop by Sorellina this Saturday for brunch with a few friends. We managed to order the majority of the menu, and were delighted by the consistent quality and thoughtfulness of the food. Even at 2pm, the restaurant was bustling with a mix of young brunch-ers like my friends and families; all mixed with relative ease. The open space and beautiful spring sunlight pouring through the windows opening on the main street left us with no option other than an immediate round of bloody marys. The large bar proved equal to the task of fortifying our parched lips with a well-balanced brunch classic. Service is prompt and friendly; they are rightly proud of the restaurant and the food. The menu at brunch leans towards the Italian, but with witty touches of classic southern thrown in -- biscuits with apple butter are simple but a must-order to begin your meal. We opened with the aforementioned biscuits and classic Sicilian arancini (also tasty). Brunch progressed via classic egg dishes (Frittata with pasta, which I haven't found outside of Italy, shirred eggs in a house marinara -- both delicious), and split a number of the pastas. From what I tasted, there is no wrong order on the menu. It was the type of meal that leaves one sorry to see it end; in fact, we ordered a bottle of bubbly after desert because we didn't want to leave the food, the ambiance, and the memories of an excellent brunch behind. Five stars.
2016-03-14,4,Really nice vibe. Friendly staff. Impressive wines by the glass. I really loved their salad choices. It's rare to see escarole and chicory on a menu. I will definitely be back.
2016-03-07,5,What a great experience! I came here with my family this past weekend. I love the decor of the restaurant and it has a homey feel. Our waitress was also great. She took the time to explain any questions we had and was attentive, but we never felt rushed. They have a great wine list, and my father and brother also enjoyed the many Italian craft beers they had on tap.Now for the food. We took the sharing approach and ordered a bunch of plates for the table. For appetizers, we had the arancini, carrots, octopus, and burrata. All were very good. The carrots were a standout for me. So simple, but who knew carrots could be that delicious?! For the main dishes we split a few pastas, branzino and cod cheeks. Again, all were very good, but there were two standouts for me. First, the gnocchi in a kale pesto sauce. We all sopped up the rest of the sauce with bread after! Second was the cod cheeks which was cooked perfectly, but my favorite thing on the plate was the ravioli. We asked the waitress about them and she informed us it's not even stuffed with cheese it's celery root! If these were on the menu as their own dish I would happily devour them every time! Contrary to some other reviews I didn't feel the portions were small. If you are used to eating at Olive Garden and the like, then yes, the portions are smaller. However, I felt they were the perfect amount. I would rather have quality than quantity and this was quality! We all left full and satisfied. They also update their menu with what is in season locally, and I am excited to see what additions will be made to the menu this Spring!
2016-03-06,5,Great staff, fantastic food. The ambiance is just the cherry on top of this already deliciously built cupcake! Brunch is also amazing. Yum!
2016-03-04,3,Pasta was great nicely done BUT portions are very small for the price. Skip the appetizers.
2016-03-04,5,I've gone a few times since the restaurant has opened since it's pretty easy to get there and back from Manhattan. Very good balance of class and comfort in terms of ambiance, and the food has been fantastic every time. If you like pasta, it's all made in-house...I've tried most of them and can't really pick a favorite (each one has it's own flair). The octopus is delicious even if you typically don't like seafood. The cocktails are fun but I also like to order a bottle of Lambrusco with every meal, goes well with pasta, fish, meats...everything really. Excited to try out this brunch this weekend!
2016-03-03,1,Awful.  From the start, getting wet napkins.  I have never in my life gone to a restaurant that served wet napkins.  The bartender (we sat at the bar) should not be in the restaurant business.  He had an attitude and looked miserable working there.  He did not like my replacement of the wet napkin (would have appreciated a comment).  Food- weird selection, small servings (like ridiculously small), and expensive.  Spent $75 each (shared bottle of $48 pinor noir which could get a sparrows for $9) and left hungry and blah.  Not getting my business again.  So many better places with awesome bartenders and normal, better food with real portions.
2016-02-29,3,Tried this place for the first time during the week (around 8 pm) and it was packed! Happy we made a reservation. The wine was excellent, although slightly pricey...I think the cheapest bottle was around $48 or so.The food was decent, not amazing, but what would keep me from going back is the noise level. The acoustics are not good at all and you have to yell across the table to speak to friends/family. For me, wine bars should be relaxing and laid back. This was not at all.
2016-02-29,4,Had dinner and drinks at the bar. Wine list was interesting, all Italian (I think) so many I didn't, know, but the bartender was very knowledgeable and helpful and when I asked for something closest to a Malbec, her choice didn't disappoint. The meatballs and octopus were very good. Much better way to serve octopus than the deep fried rubbery presentation that is the norm. The cod cheeks were delicious, great flavor (hazelnut?) to sauce. I was a bit leary of kale pesto on the gnocci, but it was very tasty and not overpoweringly strong as kale can be. We also tried the carbonara which I usually steer clear of, too heavy and gloppy. This was far more interesting, much lighter and had a peppery kick to it along with the traditional bacon flavor. The carrots (various colors) were roasted and served with a yogurt sauce with a lime flavoring. Sounds a bit odd, but it worked. The bread and butter were also a cut above. While not inexpensive, I don't think prices are out of line for a Hoboken restaurant. Very happy with food and service.
2016-02-28,4,Very good food. A bit pricey though and small portions. Don't come hungry but expect good food. The grilled fish and pesto gnocchi delicious just small especially the gelato for dessert. don't expect to share.
2016-02-26,5,The food was amazing and very authentic.  The wines selection is impressive and surprisingly unique.  Had a great Sicilian wine that paired well with the many small plates and pastas we shared. I also liked the ambiance-- rustic, yet elegant. All around a great and much needed addition to the Hoboken dining scene!
2016-02-26,4,Came in for dinner and drinks with a friend - we were lucky enough to snag seats at the bar. There was only one bartender on and you could see she was moving as fast as she could. It didn't take too long to get our drinks and food, which was a pleasant surprise. Yes, portions are small but all the plates we got were tasty. The veal agnolotti was DELICIOUS. They are still working out kinks but they've only been open a couple weeks. I'm looking forward to seeing how it evolves. I think it can catch the run-off from Bin 14. Hey Sorellina - Get onto opentable! And throw a couple more pieces of pasta into the pasta dishes
2016-02-25,2,Such high hopes but I was not impressed or satisfied by my experience.  I have to agree with the majority of the reviews here in regards to the portion size.  The plates here are SMALL, and while I'm all for sharing its gets to a point where 3 meatballs aren't going to cut it.  In fact the most memorable thing I ate all night was a plate of roasted carrots.  Dinner, in an "authentic Italian eatery" and the carrots were the stand out.  Sigh. You were closed for a year but the only changes that were noticeable was the blue wall couch and some light fixtures.  Oh and the counter tables that seem out of place. I have no problem paying for great food but I just didn't get it here. When you charge over 20 dollars for pasta, homemade or not please don't give me 18 gnocchi in an ok pesto. Sure it's uptown Hoboken however understand that Amanda's up the street and Madison down the street offer and 3 course prefix option for a few dollars more then your most expensive pasta.  We did not sample dessert as we were just ready to move on.  Service was fine,  it was early in their opening so they were a bit overly attentive and trying to up sell the menu but I can't knock the hustle. Overall this was a big miss. I just don't think sorrelina understands their market. After I drop 150 dollars I shouldn't have to go elsewhere for food because I am still hungry.   I might return in a few months to see if they've figured it out then again maybe not.
2016-02-19,2,We went to Sorellina the first Friday it opened. I had made reservations for 4 at 7:45pm a week in advance. Our party arrived at 7:40pm and right inside the front door for 20 minutes to be seated, again with a reservation. There is no where to stand and wait for a table because the space is so tight. The ambiance isn't that charming for a wine bar. If it was a grill it would be more appropriate. I know they did a renovation to the space, but it felt like they gave up half way. Once we sat down, we ordered wine. My friend asked the waiter what the difference was between two white wines she was deciding between. The waiter's response was "um I have no idea". Great answer for a place that is marketing themselves as a WINE bar. Moving on to the food: my husband and I shared the meatballs to start - only 3 the size of ping pong balls. They tasted more bland than frozen meatballs. When you order Italian meatballs you expect to get hearty, flavorful, juicy meatballs covered in an excess of delicious red sauce. If that is what you expect then don't order meatballs at Sorellina. Next, my husband and I shared the Carbonara ($25) as our main entree. Again, when you attend a traditional Italian restaurant you expect for the pasta dishes to be overflowing with pasta. Typically one pasta dish can feed two people. When we got the Carbonara we were surprised to find only enough pasta to feed one person, strictly one person. The flavor was actually really good and we enjoyed the 4 bites each that we got. Our friends ordered the Carbonara and the Grilled Branzino($28)  and were happy enough with their meals. They did agree that the portion for the Carbonara left you wanting as they also expected to have left overs. Our overall experience at Sorellina was lacking and we don't plan on going back. It's too pricey to for the quality and environment to keep testing. We would rather go to Bin 14 where we know that the vibe and food are both consistently strong.
2016-02-17,5,Amazing food! My group had 4 types of their pasta and all was super delicious. Service was great and I loved the atmosphere. Definitely a must try!
2016-02-15,5,What a wonderful addition to the Hoboken family. We arrived on a Saturday night and it was already packed & bustling. The staff was beyond accommodating & kind. Our waitress really knew the menu & recommended several wines as well. The food did not disappoint. The highlights of the evening were Nonnas Meatballs, the Octopus and the Cod Cheeks. Seriously, even if you don't like octopus or the idea of fish cheeks, this is your chance to cross over. Try to eat family style with your table so you can try a few dishes and don't skip dessert !
2016-02-14,3,This was a much anticipated new addition to the neighborhood that happens to fall short - the price is very high for the food/experience and the service needs a major overhaul. I live on the same block as Sorellina and since I commute to Manhattan via the 11th St bus I pass by this restaurant daily...Hence I was SO EXCITED to have a new option in uptown Hoboken and I followed the progress for what was close to a year. They published the menu ahead of time and the food looked like a major winner!! Gourmet Italian small plates is what this place is about and the decor/vibe definitely mirrors this. Unfortunately the food and service do not match up. My husband and I went the day after they had their grand opening and had an "ok" time - we got the meatballs (an Italian place has to have good meatballs?!),arancini, and a couple of pastas. The food was not its best, it took a long time to get drinks, and we were served the wrong pasta dish. However I have to say whatever pasta we got was good!I chalked it up to a new restaurant working out its kinks and we vowed to give it another go for Valentine's Day (Sunday night). Again slow service (took 30 mins for a glass of wine) and mediocre food (between this visit and the last I believe we tried most of the menu,the gnocchi was the only standout). I watched food going to the wrong tables, waiters in complete disarray- I also watched a waitress deliver three glasses of wine to a table, two with a normal pour and one which looked there was 1oz of wine in  the glass - I was shocked the customer didn't send it back!! Our waiter told us to come back when it was less busy so he can take better care of us. The wait staff here needs some major improvement, however I will say that the manager on duty was very attentive and did her best to cover what was obviously a small disaster happening around her. I really wanted this restaurant to work, I really did. Unfortunately I don't think we will be coming back for a long time, the price range ($100+ dollars for a meal) is just not doable for everyday and we don't have it in our budget to keep "experimenting". Hoping in the future this establishment can put the pieces together because it has the makings of being a great place!
2016-02-14,1,Honestly, I am so upset we wasted our Valentine's here. We waited 40 minutes before we even got our first glass of wine that we ordered 5-10 mins into our dinner. I figured okay whatever it's Valentine's Day, maybe things aren't running smoothly. For apps, we ordered nonnas meatballs and the smoked mozzarella. I will say- the meatballs were the best food we received here. I ordered the pasta with carbonara as my meal it was undercooked and extremely over salted. Overall terrible. My boyfriend got the 12oz steak and it was okay. Really fatty but still under impressed.did not stay for dessert as we were trying to RUN out of here and go home. I literally heated up a slice of pizza when i got home. If you are coming here to socialize with friends and hang and eat mediocre food- this is for you. Not Romantic at all, subpar food, just totally unimpressed. Definitely not a date spot- if I would ever come back it would be for a convenient spot uptown to catch up with someone. Not eat. Beware. I do not ever leave reviews but this was so bad, especially on Valentine's Day, you would think "let's not mess this up". It was awful. Not coming back here.
2016-02-13,2,Like the other reviewers, I really wanted to like this place, but it was really really underwhelming. Food was okay, we had the rice balls and kale pesto crostinis, both were fine.We also ordered the mussels, but never got them.  We were sitting at the bar, so we asked three different bartenders (including the one who took our order) where the mussels were, but none of them had any idea. They all said they would go check in the kitchen, but an hour later, no mussels. When we asked again, our bartender didn't offer to get the mussels, but just said that we wouldn't be charged for them.  When we got our bill, surprise, surprise, the mussels were still on there. Overall, the service was just bad. We had to ask twice to get some water, our glasses were never refilled.  It was extremely difficult to get anyone's attention, despite sitting at the bar and having three bartenders and a busboy directly in front of us.  We could see the manager and owner walking around, but they didn't seem to really be doing anything.We certainly won't be coming back. Both Stingray Lounge and Bin14 offer exponentially better food and service.
2016-02-12,5,Finally a real italian restaurant in Hoboken! I moved here from Italy 10 years ago and Sorellina is the first Hoboken restaurant truly inspired by authentic italian food. Obviously they have their own take on it and I think it's great. Even greater it is the extensive but easy to navigate all italian wine list. You can pick from staples, but I recommend to get adventurous and taste many of the indigenous grape varieties offered even by the glass! This place doesn't cut corners regarding their thoughts with the beverage program. Their selection of Italian craft beers is impressive, my favorite was the Scarliga European Double IPA from Birrificio Rurale, but I only sampled a couple. They also have a Negroni bar and I think it's a super fun way to celebrate the most famous italian cocktail. Also this place is nicely designed and welcoming, the staff is very knowledgable. For the people that complained about waiting too long on weekends....I don't quite understand the complaint, if there is no room there is no room, correct? After living in NYC for years I (unfortunately) learned that eating out was best and easiest on weekdays.
2016-02-12,5,IMPORTANT NOTE when reading these reviews: many people that weren't satisfied recommended going to "Johnny Pepperoni" instead. This is apples and oranges. Johnny Pepperoni is yet another "red sauce" restaurant in a sea of them in every town in NJ. They are the Italian version of a diner. At best the NJ red sauce resto serves as comfort food when you simply don't feel like cooking yourself -- at best. Sorellina on the other hand is for people with a more refined palate. I didn't find the food overpriced for what I got. The most important key to good Italian food is quality ingredients. They cost money. The next is skill in the kitchen. That costs a little more money as well. I'd rather pay more and love it than lead a mediocre life on a bed of fettuccine alfredo...I read a review that called the burrata "bland". Has this person ever had burrata before? There is an ocean of difference between "subtle" and "bland". If you base a life around sriracha and a salt shaker as a utensil that gets shaken at every bite, sure, you're going to find burrata bland. If you have the time and patience to treat the senses of taste and smell with the same respect you treat the senses of sight and touch then you will find this burrata dish elegant and refined. I loved it.Food-wise I also particularly loved the egg and white bean bruschetta as well as the arancini.Before we get to the wine, how about the beer?! They have EIGHT ITALIAN craft beers, 4 on tap and 4 on bottle. TRY THEM. They are nothing like domestic beers. These are food friendly beers that pair with food like -- if not better than -- wine. The staff was well versed in them so ask for recommendations.Wine-wise I was so excited to see an all Italian list. It hits regions all over the Boot, it offers some classics without compromising quality (yes, there is a Chianti Classico and a Pinot Grigio) as well as some natural/organic wines and some lesser known grape varieties at affordable prices to sample (try the Pecorino). I also read a review that said they were expensive. It's true, Barefoot and Yellowtail cost $6.99 at the local liquor store...but they aren't wine.
2016-02-07,4,Has lots of potential.  The wine list was terrific -- from all over Itally and plenty of wine by the glass was available to order.  The meat platter was really tasty and enough for two.  The main meals we had of pasta were cooked very well.  And the dessert plate of Italian cookies was generous and delicious, as was the decaf coffee.  If they can carry this through, it will be a unique Italian restaurant experience in Hoboken.  They need to control the noise level, which rose to a din at times, as well as the services, which was a bit disorganized.  I would also like them to start taking reservations and assume they will once they get an idea of the size of the clientele.  Overall, a very pleasant experience.
2016-02-07,2,We were so excited to try this place out but unfortunately, it just did not deliver.  We arrived at 6:45 as a walk in, it's a Saturday night at a new restaurant. We were told 40 mins wait, totally understandable. Well, we weren't sat until after 8:30, you do the Math. The service for drinks while waiting was soooooo slow. And it didn't get any better. I don't know if they are going for a "European" feel, but this isn't Europe. I mean, I don't want to be rushed out, but I'd like some more water, please? Definitely another drink, please. We'd like to see the dessert menu, please. Can we have our check now,.... PLEASE. It was just, ugh. And! There was SO much staff. I'm so confused. The food- we started with all three of the bruschetta options, all good. But again the service was so slow we just moved right to dinner. The pasta portions were tiny especially for the price. I had the bolognese, it was really good and actually decently portioned. Others had the veal agnolotti and it was tasty but HOLY was it a small portion.. Like, tiny. Both ladies were still hungry... For $28.00, that's disappointing. Another had the pasta in kale & pesto, she really enjoyed it but said it was unexpectedly spicy. For dessert- the Apple crumb with ice cream was yummy and the assorted cookie plate was pretty good just wished someone had walked us through what everything on the plate was. Overall, the decor and feel is nice, warm. But the staff is not attentive, a bit frazzled even. The food is mediocre for the prices. And the wine selection is, meh. When I first walked in I couldn't wait to come back with my husband but that has changed. I hope this place can work out the kinks.
2016-02-06,5,What a great addition to the Hoboken dining scene! A lovely renovation/update/ upgrade of the old Helmers space. A very attentive staff led by the owner (Gabi Lombardi)and the GM (Victor Biancamano) Our server (also Victor) was attentive and knowledgeable and very friendly.   We arrived early on a Friday night hoping to grab a quick drink at the bar, but they were already packed. No problem.. There communal tables by the bar, so we stood for a drink which was fine. Before we finished our drink the very alert hostess offered us the option of sitting down early at our table. Nice!  The menu offers a number of options as to how you eat. Interesting apps, tasty small plates/ antipasti, a variety of homemade pastas and an array of entrees. Our party took different paths.    On the antipasti side, we tried the meatballs and the polenta , plus the grilled octopus, roasted carrots, and the pecan pesto burrata. All well composed and delicious. One could make a great meal out just the antipasti... But you'd miss a lot.   In the entree category, the Branzino and the Bisteca were great presentations and extremely favorable. All the food came immediately out of the kitchen once plated. Everything that should have been was quite hot. Just no misses here and these folks have been open just 2-3 weeks. Gabi is a certified sommelier and it shows in her excellent selection of Italian wines; quite a selection across a spectrum of price options. So a lovely experience put on by real pros. We'll be back many times!
2016-02-06,3,I had a nice time here, but if I'm being honest I was a bit underwhelmed. I love love love the decor and vibe, and as they are a new restaurant they have lots of staff on hand. We arrived, put in our names, and were told to wait in the bar area until a table was available, which was totally fine with us. We ordered a bottle of wine and partook in good conversation. The wait ended up being a very very long wait, over an hour and a half. We were checked on periodically, but there did seem to be a bit of disorganization amongst the waitstaff. The "chef's compliment" hummus sticks were a nice touch, though. We ordered some cheese and charcuterie while we waited, and while the meat plate was lovely, the cheese plate was really lacking for the price. The pieces of cheese were so small, and the cheese itself really wasn't good enough to justify ordering it again. After we were finally seated we ordered food. I found it interesting how drastically the portion sizes varied on the dishes- the steak was huge, and the veal was very very small comparatively. We ordered a number of dishes (I had the grilled branzino) and they were all pretty good, but nothing was so delicious it really stuck out to me. The roasted carrots appetizer was probably my favorite part of the meal. It would be really nice if wine flights were offered, since we ended up not loving the second bottle of wine we ordered.
2016-02-01,3,The first time we had dinner it was very enjoyable.  The second time it was disappointing even though we ordered the same entrees.  The bar area was very crowded and everyone was having a good time.  I think in the future we will go for drinks and small plates.
2016-01-30,1,Very complicated restaurant and highly disappointed customer. When I arrived at the restaurant and spoke to the hostess, I was told the wait would be an hour and half to a two hour wait. I expressed my disappointment because I had called earlier to make a reservation however they would not take it because they wanted to leave "X" amount of tables open for walk-ins. I then spoke to the manager and she repeatedly said "I'm sorry you feel that way" and didn't try to make any accommodations yet they had available tables. As a new restaurant to the area, they  should show loyalty to the locals. We ended up at Augustino's for an amazing meal, atmosphere, great service and they were very accommodating finding us a table during a busy night.
2016-01-28,5,I am so excited Sorellina is finally open! I have lived across the street since Helmer's was there, and let me tell you, it was worth the wait! We opted to go family style, as we were there with a big group and wanted to try EVERYTHING! The food is light and fresh, incorporating a lot of fish, in true Southern Italian style (which is refreshing, as Hoboken is the land of heavy northern Italian chicken parm and dense penne vodka dishes). My favorite appetizer/small plate was the Octopus and Sausage skewer. The octopus had a light lemon flavor which cut the spicy sausage perfectly. MUST TRY! My favorite entree was either the Cod Cheeks or Crab Puttanesca. Both were SO GOOD! the Cod Cheeks are served with a leek and turnip ravioli in brown butter (SWOON!) and the Crab Puttanesca was delicious (they make their pasta in-house)! Now, the DRINKS! Their wine list is filled with ALL Italian wines and the owner stopped by frequently, advising me which wine paired best with which menu item. My favorite was the Chiani Classico, which the bartender advised, has been flying off the shelves. I am excited to be a new regular at Sorellina! While the space is big and open, welcoming to large groups, it would also be a great place to catch up with friends or have date night!
2016-01-27,5,If this place was a person? It might be Emeril...Upscale, refined, new Italian with a serious twist, and going to be around for a long time. If you too are fatigued by the traditional, ubiquitous Hoboken Italian restaurant then get here soon, you will not be disappointed. Food is outstandingly unique takes on Italian concepts and like nothing else I've tried with the exception of that time I dreamed I was a guest judge on Chopped. Have been here twice already and favorites so far are the meatballs, bruschetta, gnocchi, sausage and peppers, caesar salad, and carrots (I know lol carrots? but really though). Honestly can't compare this to anywhere else in Hoboken, but if you had a gun to my head I could say Bin 14; however the wines here are quite frankly, actually good (and not ones you saw at Sparrow yesterday for half the price). They did a great job with the space and intentionally preserved much of the old charm. I like that you can go either casual or for a special occasion. Saving the best part for last--which, as we all know is dessert--DEEP FRIED MFkN PASTA... I'm done.
2016-01-26,5,I'm sorry, but anybody comparing Sorellina to Johnny Pepperoni is completely missing the point - there's no comparison between the two places, IMO, other than that they're both Italian restaurants. Sorellina has a grown up, old-school, elevated Italian comfort food vibe (as opposed to Johnny Pepperoni, which has a slightly-elevated pizzeria vibe), a very nice wine list, and everything we ordered (arancini, gnocchi, crab puttanesca, and caesar salad) was excellent. Every staff member we interacted with was very pleasant, and it was just an overall very enjoyable dining experience.
2016-01-25,4,Probably more of a 3.5, but rounding up because it's a vast improvement from the depressing Helmers.  Food was solid, but nothing spectacular.  We stayed pretty safe/boring, so it will be interesting to see what the more adventurous options are like.  Just 2 apps - meatballs & rice balls - and 2 pastas - bolognese and spicy crab.  All good, but really only the crab dish was challenging and yes, still good. But better than the dozens of cheaper, low scale BYOB Italian joints? To warrant high prices? Nah.Vibe/scene is cute enough - same big bar with some extra tables next to it to stand at too, so will definitely return for drinks.  Think Bin 14 but more spacious. Booth seating elsewhere.  Will be cool in the summer too with the outdoor seating.Service was weird...they're going for more upscale but our waiter was so bored and uninterested in being there it was a bit off putting.   But food and drinks came out speedily enough so no real complaints.Wine was STELLAR! We got a $56 bottle (mid range for there) and it was fantastic.  In total, bill was $120 without tip.  All in all - food is too expensive for what you get, should def knock off $2-4 or increase portions, since the food is not amazing enough for the price tag.  Only negative, albeit a big one.  That said, this is Hoboken, land of mediocrity for a premium.  Will be most likely to come back just for drinks/snacks.
2016-01-25,5,Yumm, loved it here! We really enjoyed every appetizer, entree, and desert we ordered. However the stand outs for me were the meatballs and the truffle/veal pasta! Those two are a must. Also, save room for dessert as they are delish! I recommend the hazelnut gelato and the angle wing pastries.
2016-01-23,2,We were told it was a 30 minute wait for a table so we decided to have a drink at the bar. Two hours and many drinks later we were finally seated. The food was mediocre, even when trashed and starving. Like the other reviews said, go to Johnny Peps.
2016-01-21,5,We just tried this place and love our bartender! Great Italian beers, nice, chill! Just what Hoboken needs!
2016-01-21,2,Wanted to love this place but it just fell short. Clean and cool atmosphere and a good vibe but food was average and overpriced. Portions were small for the money. Pasta was homemade and delicious but my dish was short on sauce and meat. Clams were missing from sausage and clam pasta entree my spouse ordered. Just average and expensive. Save your money and go to Johnny Pepperoni's you'll be happier!
2016-01-20,5,So glad that Sorellina is open! Had such a great first experience. We tried several things on the menu including: the many delicious bruschetta, Nonnas meatballs, and grilled octopus! We also indulged in the carbonara, bolognese, and the steak. Getting hungry just thinking about it!
